        "text": "Kenneth Branagh gambles on musical\n\nBY JOHN BLACK\n\nCONTRIBUTING WRITER\n\nBOSTON - \"Though adjectives are spilt more about Manhattan's Biltmore\n\nWith this hotel we all are satisfied...\"\n\nâ€” Close to 20 years have passed since Kenneth Branagh, the actor-director-writer best known for bringing Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" \"Henry V,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing\") to life on the silver screen, sang those lines on stage.\n\nBut he still remembers them by heart.\n\n\"It was part of the curriculum when I was in drama school,\" he explains. \"We did a Gershwin musical called 'Lady Be Good.' I played a waiter in the chorus, with not much to do. I sang a line in a song about a hotel. That was the extent of my musical experience before this film.\"\n\nThe film he is referring to is \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" which opened the Newport Film Festival earlier this week and will play at Harvard Square Theatre in Cambridge starting Friday.\n\nIt's a blend of the bard and Broadway show tunes that Branagh not only directed, but acts, sings and dances in, too. The film, which features a cast of experienced musical veterans, such as Nathan Lane, and neophytes to the genre, such as Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Lillard (of \"Scream\" fame), is a throwback to the golden age of musicals in which the actors break into song at the drop of a hat. One minute you're listening to an actor speaking in iambic pentameter, the next you're listening to him sing \"There's No Business Like Show Business.\"\n\n'Tough sell'\n\nIt was an idea, Branagh admits, that was hard to sell from the start.\n\n\"Ten years into this (filmmaking), and I still feel it's something of a miracle that any film gets made, because it involves such a leap of faith and such a large sum of money,\" he says during a visit to Boston. \"So the idea of doing a Shakespearean play that people really don't know anything about didn't have people cheering to begin with. Then I fancy doing it as a musical, a genre that hasn't worked in any spectacular fashion for about 40 years.\n\n\"So, yeah,\" he says with a laugh, \"it was a tough sell.\"\n\nTough, but worth it, he felt. The idea of surprising people with Shakespeare has always appealed to Branagh. Doing one of the lesser-known plays freed him from having to play to an audience just sitting there waiting for the balcony scene or for the lead character to pick up a skull and talk to it. He also liked the shock value of having the bard's characters sing.\n\n\"There is a generation or two of moviegoers out there who haven't even seen a real musical on the big screen,\" he says. \"In just about any screening of this film I've been to, I've watched the reaction of the audience when people on the screen burst into song. I watch their heads turn as if they really can't believe what is happening. Sure, we lose a few people because they are shocked or appalled, but most of them buy into the idea. By the end of the second number, they are either with us or gone.\"\n\nBranagh edited the play extensively, letting the songs carry much of the plot. He's not worried about offending any purists in the audience.\n\n\"I think it's great to tinker with Shakespeare. Look what's happened over the past few years with the revival of Shakespeare on film. More than a bit of tinkering has gone on,\" he says, referring to films such as \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" an updating of \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" and \"A Thousand Acres,\" a modern adaptation of \"King Lear.\"\n\n\"If nothing else, it opens up a bit of debate and keeps the plays alive. And we're still not as bold about it as they were in the 18th century, when they changed the end of 'Romeo and Juliet' so they got married and lived happily ever after. I've never been that cheeky. My experience is that if people enjoy it or are provoked by it, they go back to the original play, which is a good thing, too.\"\n\nTips from Scorsese\n\nAs for offending fans of musicals, Branagh says he made sure to go to two experts in the field before releasing his film upon the world. He spoke to Martin Scorsese, whose made his own musical, \"New York, New York,\" back in 1977.\n\n\"Martin and I talked a lot about the practicalities of making a musical, everything from how to shoot certain sequences to how long to rehearse a number before you shoot, so the cast isn't fatigued. He was tremendously helpful.\"\n\nThe other person he consulted was Stanley Donen, director of such classic movie musicals as \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"On the Town\" and \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\" Actually, \"consulted\" may be too strong a word.\n\n\"I had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Donen, but, frankly, I was too intimidated,\" Branagh admits. \"In post production, though, (Miramax Films head) Harvey Weinstein had the idea of showing it to both Martin and Mr. Donen. We knew we were doing something unusual, and wanted to get the advice of people who have done it before. They were both very supportive.\"\n\nTheir support of the project resulted in a public stamp of approval. \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" as the poster and opening credits proclaim, is \"presented by Martin Scorsese and Stanley Donen.\"\n\nNow all that remains, Branagh says, is seeing if the general public approves of what he's done.\n\n\"It's one thing to talk about the risks and all that, but I just think I'm lucky to be doing something unusual. It's important to take risks artistically. The fear you feel is part of the experience, and it can be terribly stimulating.\"\n\nHe chuckles, and adds: \"If it really affected me, I wouldn't have done some of the films I have done in the past.\"\n\n\"When all is said and done,\" he says, \"the main thing I wanted to do with this film was put a smile on people's faces. This movie, hopefully, will superficially entertain them in a lighthearted way. When they leave, I want them to feel about the songs and the play the way they make me feel. Simply happy.\""
