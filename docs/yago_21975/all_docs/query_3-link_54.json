        "text": "Previously, I looked at Shakespearean roles played on screen by Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles. Why not make it a trilogy, I figured, and mention Kenneth Branagh.\n\nBranagh caused a sensation in 1989 with his Oscar-nominated version of HENRY V. Like his predecessors Olivier and Welles, Branagh starred in the main role and directed. His leading lady was played by his then-wife Emma Thompson, who would later receive Oscars in the best actress and screenwriting categories for other films. Additional members of the distinguished cast included Paul Scofield, Derek Jacobi and Judi Dench. Critics lauded the performances, as well as the way Branagh restructured the text by including flashbacks from two plays written earlier by Shakespeare about Henry IV.\n\nIn 1993, Branagh and Thompson paired up again in another adaptation of a Shakespearean play. This time it was the comedy MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, which featured supporting performances by Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, and Michael Keaton. Thompson’s mother, actress Phyllida Law, also had a role. Whereas HENRY V barely broke even, this film was a much bigger hit, earning $58 million on an $11 million budget.\n\nThe next production would be 1995’s OTHELLO. This time Branagh did not direct (those duties were assumed by Oliver Parker), and he did not play the lead role (it was done by Laurence Fishburne). Instead, Branagh focused on the third-billed part of Iago, and turned in a sharp villainous performance that earned him recognition by the Screen Actors Guild that year.\n\nThe following year Branagh was back in charge of directing and acting in his big screen adaptation of HAMLET. He also oversaw the script, adapted from the Bard’s original text, which earned him an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. Unfortunately, this production did not catch on at the box office, but it contains memorable performances from people like Charlton Heston, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams and Kate WInslet.\n\nThe next film was LOVE’S LABOUR’S LOST in 2000. Branagh decided to turn Shakespeare’s romantic comedy into a Hollywood musical set in the 1930s. It was a risky undertaking; and though it featured stars like Nathan Lane and Alicia Silverstone, audiences were not very receptive to the version, and it flopped badly. So badly in fact the studio (Miramax) cancelled its three-picture deal with Branagh to make more films. After such a stinging defeat, Branagh would wait until 2006 to try another Shakespearean adaptation, when he did a production of AS YOU LIKE IT. However, it also failed to connect with movie goers and as a result, Branagh has not brought any more Shakespeare to the screen."
