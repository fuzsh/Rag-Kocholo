        "text": "Since we’re already remaking every [children’s fairy tale] (http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/11/kristen-stewart-huntsman-winters-war-trailer) and [‘80s cult movie] (http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/ronda-rousey-road-house-reboot-patrick-swayze), we might as well get started on remaking all our adaptations of classic literature as well. To that end, director Kenneth Branagh will be directing a remake of the 1974 Oscar-winning film Murder on the Orient Express. And he’s cast an actor he’s very familiar with in the leading role. Yes, Branagh himself will play famed detective Hercule Poirot, beloved recurring hero in Agatha Christie’s novels and probably second only to Sherlock Holmes in the annals of literary sleuths.\n\nThis will be the ninth film in which Branagh has directed and starred, though only the second time since 2000; he directed and played the villain in 2014’s Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. The 1974 take on Orient Express, directed by Sidney Lumet, was nominated for six Academy Awards, including one for Albert Finney who played Poirot. The film was a star-studded affair — Lauren Bacall, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins — so we can hope for some fun casting announcements in the weeks to come. No word yet on who’s in line to play Ingrid Bergman’s Oscar-winning role.\n\nBranagh’s last directorial effort was this past February’s Cinderella, which remains one of 2015’s top ten domestic money-makers.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on HBO and Max to Watch Right Now\n\nStop aimlessly scrolling: We’ve got all the recommendations you need.\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nStyle\n\nEmma Corrin Felt “Free to Be Fluid” With Fashion at the Deadpool & Wolverine Premiere\n\nInside both of the star’s edgy, Cartier-adorned looks—from a Nina Ricci bodysuit on the red carpet to custom Miu Miu for the after-party, plus a top secret Marvel cameo they are “very excited for the world to see.”\n\nStyle\n\nZac Efron Recovering After Hospitalization for “Minor Swimming Incident”\n\nThe High School Musical star was rushed to an Ibiza hospital after an apparent mishap in the pool.\n\nMovies\n\nIs Twister Responsible for Getting Fleetwood Mac Back Together?\n\nAs Twisters rules the box office, we look back at how a song from the original film’s soundtrack may have brought the Rumours lineup together again.\n\nPolitics\n\nUnderestimate Kamala Harris at Your Peril\n\nWhy Team Trump is scrambling as the veep has come out swinging.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings.
