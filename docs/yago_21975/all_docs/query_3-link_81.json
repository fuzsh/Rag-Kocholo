        "text": "The late John Sessions made his name on the Channel Four tv show Whose Line is it Anyway and the breakthrough resulted in the local star becoming a well known actor in theatre, tv and film.\n\nHis last ever film appearance has now hit cinema screens as John had a small cameo role in Sir Kenneth Branagh's Belfast movie which is based on Branagh's childhood growing up in a housing district during the Northern Irish troubles in 1969. The 96 minute film has already been hailed as a must see by critics with some describing the black and white movie to be a 'masterclass'.\n\nJohn's appearance in Belfast occurs during a family trip to the theatre to see A Christmas Carol as he gives his final performance as the Belfast stage actor Joseph Tomelty playing Marley’s ghost.\n\nSee the film trailer below.\n\nSir Kenneth Branagh who is the filmmaker was good friends with John and spoke about how the Largs actor had inspired him to pen the autobiographical movie which can be seen at Premier Cinema in Saltcoats this week.\n\nThe film starts acclaimed and award winning actress Judi Dench and stars nine year old Jude Hill as the central character in an amazing movie which is already been tipped for the Oscars and Academy film awards."
