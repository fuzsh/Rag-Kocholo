        "text": "More than 35 years after he last suited up for Mississippi State, Ray Charles Costict still holds the Bulldogs' career record for tackles.\n\nAnd the memory of No. 38 in maroon and white running sideline to sideline to pummel opposing ball-carriers remains vivid to those who played with and coached him.\n\nCostict, the Moss Point native who was the SEC's defensive player of the year in 1976 and went on to play three seasons with the NFL's New England Patriots, died Tuesday at age 56. He had been living with or near his daughter in Orlando, Fla., at the time of his death, the cause of which was not immediately known.\n\n\"I never saw anybody train and work as hard as Ray Charles, or who had as much physical and mental ability as he had,\" said Bill Lee, a teammate of Costict's at both Moss Point and Mississippi State. \"I was always amazed at the guy. ... I don't know if he was the No. 1 player to ever come out of Moss Point, but by the time you got to No. 3, his name was going to be mentioned.\"\n\nCostict graduated in 1973 from Moss Point, where he was among the first black football stars following the school's integration two years earlier.\n\nCostict helped start a pipeline from Moss Point to Mississippi State, a list that included eventual Bulldogs standouts such as Lee, Gerald Jackson, Raymond Peyton, Bobby Molden, Kenny Johnson, Jackie McCorvey, Earnest Barnes, George Wonsley and Melvin Dott, among others. Bob Tyler was entering his first season as head coach in Starkville when he signed Costict and Lee, a defensive back.\n\n\"It's very hard to describe how great Ray Costict was, and not just as a football player,\" Tyler said via telephone Thursday. \"I remember hearing about him being in class one day at Mississippi State, and someone was causing a disturbance. Ray Costict stood up and said, 'I didn't come here to come to class and not be able to learn. Now sit down and we'll have a good class.' The teacher said it was an outstanding semester. Ray ruled the class and kept everybody quiet.\n\n\"But he was an incredible football player. (Moss Point) Coach Billy Miller told me, 'I've got a guy coming up through high school who is going to be outstanding,' and he was right. I coached 34 or 35 years ... and Ray Costict could close on the ball faster than any linebacker I've ever seen.\"\n\nAfter spending his freshman season at fullback, Costict moved to linebacker as a sophomore in 1974. He started three seasons on defense, registering a school-record 467 tackles and earning first-team All-SEC and second-team All-America honors as a senior in 1976.\n\nThe Bulldogs went 9-2 that season, and Costict was named by SEC coaches as the league's top defender.\n\n\"My wife (Dale) and I were with him at the banquet in Birmingham when they named him defensive player of the year,\" Tyler said. \"They handed him a trophy and he asked my wife, 'Will you keep my trophy?' And she still has it.\n\n\"He was a great leader, both in high school and with our Mississippi State teams. He probably could make a better halftime speech than I could ever make. ... We are so saddened by this.\"\n\nA bit undersized (6-0, 218) even for his era, Costict lasted until the 11th round of the 1977 NFL draft. The Patriots chose him with the 303rd overall selection, but he made an immediate impact on special teams as a rookie.\n\nKnown as \"Little Backer\" to fellow linebacker Sam Hunt's \"Big Backer,\" Costict started four games and totaled 50.5 tackles in 1978. He added 50 tackles in 1979, and was described by New England defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur in the team's 1979 media guide as \"an exceptional producer on pass coverage situations and ... a very alert player who works hard at the mental aspects of the game.\"\n\nCostict sat out the 1980 season with a knee injury and was traded to the New Orleans Saints the following offseason. But the NFL office overruled the trade due to a technicality and sent Costict back to New England.\n\nBeset by personal problems, Costict never again played for the Patriots and was waived out of the league prior to the 1981 season. He ended his playing career as a member of the USFL's New Jersey Generals in 1983.\n\nLee, a longtime assistant coach at Moss Point who recently moved back home after several years in Starkville, said he last heard from his old college roommate about five months ago.\n\n\"I talked to him on the phone and he told me he was with his daughter in Florida,\" Lee said. \"We didn't talk after that. He said he was doing good, going straight and everything. We never got a chance to see each other.\"\n\nFuneral services are set for 1 p.m. Saturday at Millender's Funeral Home chapel in Moss Point."
