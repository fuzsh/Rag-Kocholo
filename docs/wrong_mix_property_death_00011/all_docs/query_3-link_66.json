        "text": "On Friday the Wall Street Journal reported that one of the great old mansions from silent-era Hollywood has come on the market for an asking price of $13,800,000. For me, this was exciting news as I have always considered the Spanish-styled estate, located at 345 St. Pierre Road in Bel-Air, to be one of the quintessential silent movie star homes. After all, it was home to one of the quintessential silent movie stars – Colleen Moore.\n\nAlthough she may not be as well remembered today as she should be, Colleen Moore was one of the brightest and biggest stars in the Hollywood firmament of the 1920’s. A thoroughly charming and talented performer, Moore was the screen’s biggest box office draw for the years 1926-1927. By the time she had retired a wealthy woman in 1934, Moore had appeared in more than 60 productions including such major films of the day as Sally (1925); Orchids and Ermine (1927); and Lilac Time (1928). In pictures since 1916, she managed to attain full stardom with 1923’s Flaming Youth and with it she helped to usher in the era of the flapper with women everywhere copying Moore’s thoroughly modern bobbed haircut. If you have never seen a Colleen Moore film I highly recommend you rent Ella Cinders (1926). Like the exceptional Show People (1928), it is a Hollywood “in” joke chronicling Ella’s rise from hapless small town beauty contest winner to Hollywood superstardom. It’s a fun little romp and you’ll see why Moore was so popular.\n\nIronically, Moore’s highly successful career in motion pictures almost didn’t happen at all because of her eyes – you see, one was blue and the other brown. Fortunately, for all concerned they both photographed the same in black and white. However, you can guess though she probably never bought any stock in Technicolor. Moore’s biggest years of success occurred while she was under contract to First National. So large loomed Moore, she was one of the rarefied few to have that ultimate Hollywood silent era status symbol – her own specially built bungalow on the studio lot.\n\nA smart and savvy lady, even at the dizzying heights of stardom Moore never lost sight of how fickle fame can be and handled her enormous salary with great care, making sure to put most of it away for the inevitable rainy day. As such she spent the bulk of her starring career in a series of charming, but relatively modest homes in the Wilshire District, more suitable to a well-to-do banker than an internationally acclaimed movie star earning $12,500 a week.\n\nFinally, in January 1929, she decided it was time to “go Hollywood,” and she and her husband, John McCormick, First National’s VP in charge of production, purchased a grand three-acre estate in the most exclusive section of the most exclusive district of Bel-Air at 345 St. Pierre Road. The Hollywood version of the story is that Moore and her husband saw the mansion while it was still under construction and simply had to have it with a reported $250,000 involved to get the current owner, Chicago businessman C. Fred Stewart, to find his dream home elsewhere. While this sounds a bit press agenty (after all, McCormick had been a press agent before rising up the studio ladder) this was in fact how the scene played out. (Imagine a Hollywood legend that’s true!)\n\nThe not-yet-completed estate had been designed by the busiest L.A. architect you’ve probably never heard of – Theodore J. Scott. Sometimes referred to as T.J. Scott or Theo Scott, the prolific architect designed hundreds, possibly thousands, of homes throughout Southern California during the 1920’s, sometimes entire neighborhoods at a time as with Walter G. McCarty’s subdivision of the old Beverly Speedway property or H.L. Miller’s development of a large tract off Kenneth Road in Glendale that called for 1,500 Scott-designed houses. Scott was adept at all the popular “revival” styles of the period, particularly the Spanish, often employing Missionesque arched arcades/loggias running along the length of at least one section of a house. For the Stewart commission, Scott created a large two-story U-shaped residence that evoked the haciendas of the old Spanish Dons.\n\nThe fact that the house was still unfinished at the time of her purchase presented Moore with an opportunity. In her charming little memoir, Silent Star, Moore relates how she got the house tailored to her tastes. On the hunt for someone to do her bathroom she was introduced one day to a young man named Harold Grieve, husband of fellow silent star Jetta Goudal and a studio art director who had the intention of opening his own interior design business. In spite of his lack of experience, Moore went ahead and asked him to do the bathroom, but he confidently told her “Either I do your whole house, Miss Moore, or nothing.” Impressed by his chutzpah, she gave him the job and as such also giving a major boost to his nascent interior design business. Grieve would go on to a highly successful career with many famous Hollywood clients including Bing Crosby, Raoul Walsh, Hal Roach; Lily Pons; Howard Greer; Zeppo Marx; Earle C. Anthony; Irving Thalberg & Norma Shearer, among many others.\n\nMoore had such confidence in her new decorator she claimed she fired T.J. Scott and turned the completion of the house immediately over to Grieve and contractor Clarence Cox. “He pushed out walls, closed in the sixty-five foot loggia,” she related. “Off the loggia, between the U of the house, he built a large flagstone patio. At one end of the U he added a guest house, at the other end a theater. We bought another acre below the house and put in a tennis court and swimming pool with a pool in between.”\n\nThere was also a guest suite upstairs in the main house between John’s suite at one end and mine at the other, each with sitting room, bedroom and bath. In my suite there was also an office off the bedroom for my secretary.\n\nHarold did my suite in yellow and turquoise, with heavy silk pile turquoise carpeting made in China, which really did make me feel like a movie star. The bathroom was done in yellow onyx and mirrors, some of them with scenes painted behind the glass.\n\nColleen’s husband John took as great of interest as his wife in the decorating of his sanctum sanctorum and had very specific ideas on how his suite should be decorated. In spite of Moore and Grieve’s pleadings, McCormick insisted his suite be done in very dark blue. McCormick also insisted on an indulgence in what Moore called “Grand Rapids Department Store” furniture with Grieve having the unenviable task of trying to balance antiques and mass-produced items for a harmonious effect, a task he appears to have accomplished.\n\nHowever, odd colors and department store knockoffs were to be the least of Moore’s concerns over her husband. For years, McCormick had been battling alcohol addiction, a battle he continued to lose, which put more and more pressure on the marriage until it finally broke. In spite of his best efforts, including a male nurse attendant, McCormick wouldn’t, or couldn’t, beat his drinking binges and took to hiding bottles in strategically placed spots around the mansion and the three acre grounds. “As I drove up to the front door one day,” she recalled, “I saw a bottle on a string outside his bathroom window. It was hopeless.” But her decision to finally end it nearly got her killed when she asked for a divorce while he was drunk. Enraged McCormick grabbed his wife by the throat and began choking her. Had it not been for the intervention of the chauffeur, it might have truly been the end.\n\nMoore kept the Bel Air house as her property after the divorce and it became a regular gathering spot for her many famous friends with a regular round of social events both grand and intimate faithfully covered in the gossip columns of the day. When not in town for any length of time, the shrewd Moore would rent the estate out, often to notable friends. Marlene Dietrich (who Colleen claimed was the best house keeper who ever lived there) took over the house in 1934. Later the home was rented by studio executive B.P. Schulberg and then to the Countess Dorothy di Frasso. Dorothy ran with a very interesting and eclectic crowd that ranged from royalty to gangsters, the latter category included the handsome rogue Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegal who lived in the guest house for a time during di Frasso’s residence there. It was actor Bruce Cabot who was to cause Moore the most trouble, hosting a series of wild parties in his time there that not only scandalized the neighbors it brought on an international scandal when at one such soiree in 1942 Errol Flynn was accused of rape by a young lady who claimed the actor locked her in “The Blue Room.” When the horrified Moore heard the news she immediately knew two things (1) The infamous “Blue Room” was her former husband’s bedroom and (2) The girl was lying. The lock on the door had been broken for years.\n\nAfter Moore had given up her long time Bel Air base it passed into other hands including the Stack family, socially prominent California pioneers who had a son in the movie business – handsome young Robert Stack who made the house his home in the late 1950’s – 1960’s.\n\nIn 1978, the estate was purchased by Steven J. Fogel, founder of Westwood Financial who paid $1.3 million for the property. Fogel had originally purchased the grand mansion for the exact reason Colleen Moore had – to show that he had “arrived.” Now, after more than three decades in the home, Fogel told the WSJ he is ready to move on saying he will miss the memories, but not the upkeep.\n\nOver the course of time, Fogel updated and remodelled the old house and today it stands at some 13,000 square feet with 7 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. The three acres of original grounds are long gone, but the house still sits on a comfortable .66 acre lot. Fogel told the WSJ that he has preserved many of the original elements of the house including arches, the original projection room and the guest house, which is currently used as an art studio. The house is listed at $13,800,000 and is being handled by Mauricio Umansky of The Agency. Listing with many more photos can be found here.\n\nHere are a few more “Then” photos and some “Now” photos of this historic estate.\n\nYears later, when I was renting the house, Greta Garbo came to look at it. When she saw the bathroom she said, “Ah Colleen, those were the good old days.” – Colleen Moore\n\nLike the condemned prisoner it is, the old Statler Center/Statler Hilton/Omni/Wilshire Grand Hotel at the corner of Wilshire and Figueroa @ 930 Wilshire Boulevard, at this hour stoically sits awaiting its fate. Unlike any human counterparts, however, there’s no chance for a last-minute reprieve from the governor or even a last meal for that matter. Its fate is sealed and it’s only a short matter of time before the executioner arrives to make it official. (They’re saying “summer.”) Having lived in Los Angeles as long as I have, I am never surprised whenever a building is torn down, historic or not. What does surprise me, however, is how few are mourning the old hotel’s passing because it was once a such really big deal. I mean a really big deal. The largest hotel to be built in the United States since the Waldorf Astoria in 1931 it hosted movie stars, presidents (Eisenhower to Reagan) and kings as well as Pope John II; it was the venue for the 1952 Emmy Awards; it welcomed the Brooklyn Dodgers to their new home in Los Angeles; sequestered the jurors in the Rodney King Jr. trial; as well as delegates to the 1960 and 2000 Democratic National Conventions and it was once one of the “Crown Jewels” of Conrad Hilton’s mighty empire.\n\nIt had hot pink elevator doors, Googie curved glass mosaic tile-covered walls; automated luggage conveyors, an innovative “Drive In” registration feature. It had a pool resembling a “lopsided teardrop;” a wavy porte cochere declared to be “tipping its hat” to the city. It had Nixon wandering the halls (Yes, he lived there for a while); a swanky supper club called the Terrace Room where movie stars like Robert Taylor danced the night away to the tunes of Xavier Cugat; 15 ballroom/banquet/meeting rooms. Its laundry facilities could handle the equivalent of a town of 20,000; its restaurants could feed 15,000 It had air-conditioning and television sets in each of its 1,300 guest rooms, at a time when that was BIG deal; 13 stories of office space; three levels of shops; an ice skating rink; a jungle of palm trees and philodendrons indoors and out; a “cocktail garden” and 34 miles of dizzying lime, pink, eggplant, grey and mauve carpeting.\n\nFabulous Fifties-era hotels are such a rarity in the Los Angeles area (Just this and Welton Becket’s Beverly Hilton, I think) I thought for sure that when the death sentence was pronounced on what was now known as the Wilshire Grand Hotel there would be a hue and cry from all quarters to save this beloved Los Angeles landmark. The problem is though, was it a beloved Los Angeles landmark? In spite of its unique place in Los Angeles history, the Statler never seems to have caught the imagination of the city it served for nearly sixty years. Once the last word in jet age modernism, it’s now a forgotten relic about to be hauled off to the rubble heap with nary a peep of protest over its ignoble end. Now please don’t think this is in any way intended as a criticism of the preservation community or lovers of MCM architecture. It’s not. After all, look at me. I think it’s fair to say I love historic and interesting buildings, but do you know how many times I passed through the portals of that hotel? Zero. Why not? No reason in particular. I just never thought about it. And therein may lay the problem. People may have liked the Statler but they don’t seem to have ever loved it. Sure it was nice, but as the late, great Dom DeLuise said in History of the World Part I, “Nice…not thrilling, but nice.”\n\nBuilt in an age of newer, faster, better, perhaps the Statler was never intended as a hotel for the ages. Like a fancy new car, it was a showstopper until inevitably eclipsed by a fancier, newer model. It served its purpose and now it’s time for a trade in. And it is certainly getting “traded in” for something fancier and newer. Korean Air, the owner of the property, has announced plans for a mammoth new Wilshire Grand Hotel, 70 stories high, “swathed in photovoltaic lights.” The plans, by the venerable firm of A.C. Martin Partners, Inc. are still evolving, but at present they include putting the lobby on the 70th floor. (No “Drive in” lobby anymore I guess). At present, it looks to become the second tallest building in Los Angeles with a target completion date of 2017. Gee whiz. No wonder no one’s mourning the loss of the dowdy old Statler. It sounds like Mamie Eisenhower (a frequent guest BTW) in a swimsuit competition with Angelina Jolie. (There’s a visual.) Personally, I’d bet the surprising Mamie would acquit herself as well as the old Statler would if anyone had given it a good look. But nobody did (including me) and it’s all academic now.\n\nIn a way, the site at Wilshire and Figueroa makes an almost perfect metaphor for the progress Los Angeles has made over the last century and continues to make as the buildings of the previous era give way for the next. For one thing, it was originally known as Grasshopper before it became Figueroa if that tells you anything! The first structure on the site had been the gracious Italianate Victorian residence of Samuel Calvert Foy, whose daughter Mary, became the City’s first librarian. The 1872 Foy house represented the Los Angeles of the 19th Century when the City’s well-to-do had their homes lining Figueroa. Then progress pushed it aside and replaced it with a mammoth new automobile headquarters, the showroom and garage of Paul G. Hoffman Inc. and the fabulous Studebaker. Then progress kicked that to the curb and up went the Statler. Now comes the new Wilshire Grand. The mind reels as to what will replace it!\n\nLike the underappreciated friend or lover taken for granted until they leave you, the Statler has suddenly gripped me with guilt and a newfound appreciation for what it was. And I feel sad it’s going away without at least a proper sendoff. It was, as it turns out, a pretty cool place and it deserves to be remembered. So won’t you join me in raising a glass, or two, or three, in a little celebration of the short, but eventful life of the soon to be late, great Statler Center cum Statler Hilton cum Los Angeles Hilton cum Omni cum Wilshire Grand cum pile of twisted rubble. Farewell Statler! We hardly knew ye!\n\nDesigned by the venerable Chicago firm of Holabird, Root & Burgee with A.A. Nickman as associate architect. The super modern Statler, which was to be the newest and brightest link in the growing Statler Hotel chain, had been in the planning stages for more than three years before ground was officially broken in 1950. The mammoth project was originally estimated at $15,000,000-$18,000,000 and would contain 1,275 hotel rooms, three floors of shops, a three-story garage and 150,000 square feet in office space in its own thirteen story tower attached. The hotel was also providentially sited adjacent to the as-of-yet uncompleted 101 Freeway being built through downtown. For years, the Statler would advertise itself as the hotel “At the hub of the freeways.”\n\nAnd aaaway we go! July 5, 1950, the ground is broken on the $25,000,000 Statler Center with a gold-plated shovel. That’s glamorous film star Celeste Holm on the left and in the center is none other than Mary E. Foy, Los Angeles’ very first librarian, whose family’s home stood on the site from 1872 to 1921. She’s letting her nieces, Mary & Martha Fowler, get into the act as well as Arthur F. Douglas, president of Hotels Statler Corporation. California Governor and future Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Earl Warren personally operated the steam shovel. Now that’s hands on leadership! Governor Warren was later given the honor of being the first guest in the hotel’s luxurious “State Suite.”\n\nAnd up we go! For the record, the Statler Center required 7,500 tons of structural steel and 50,000 yards of concrete spread out over a floor space of 25 acres. It took more than two years to complete the mammoth project from Summer 1950 to Fall 1952.\n\nAnd we’re almost there! The wavy entrance portico was a bit of pizzazz for an otherwise rather severe exterior.\n\nAnd we’re not quite ready, but, what the heck, close enough! Projected for a June 1952 opening, the Statler project was running way behind schedule. The hotel had to open by Labor Day weekend as conventions had already been booked. As crews continued to work furiously to complete the mammoth structure, Statler management decided to throw a Hail Mary pass and unlock the doors even though the place was far from finished. At exactly 12:00 on August 6, 1952, the hotel doors were quietly unlocked with no announcements, no publicity. Almost instantly, curious crowds, hearing the news spread by word of mouth, began swarming to the hotel to see the new wonder. Within a half hour, the Statler’s only up and running restaurant, the Cafe Rouge, was filled to capacity with a line snaking out the door. Only the first three hotel floors were furnished, but as nightfall fell over the Statler, lights began popping on in an almost continuous band on those lower levels. The mighty Statler was open for business!\n\nThe Statler gets its first guest! Statler manager J.C. Meacham shakes the hand of William H. Thomas, a Cleveland/Washington D.C. attorney and the lucky first person to check in at the spanking new Statler, August 6, 1952. Clerk R.E. Pierce holds the registration card. Bellman Robert Bevans holds the well-worn satchel of Mr. Thomas, who travels an average of 100,000 miles a year on business. For the record, Bevans was a Bellman not a Bellhop. The term was banished at Statler hotels.\n\nAfter being whisked up to his room by one of the Statler’s hot pink elevators, Attorney Thomas would have likely been escorted to a room similar to this one, a Statler “Studio Room.” The studio room was a Statler feature with a daybed that was converted in early evening into a bed “unless guests plan on entertaining.” The Statler offered a variety of rooms from the studio type to conventional bedrooms to the luxurious State Suite with its own private terrace. The overreaching theme appears to have been efficiency over charm when it came to decorating. Even color shots don’t improve the situation.\n\nBut who notices the exceedingly bland decor when you have television? No one may understand this today, but having a television in your hotel room in 1952 was a very special amenity. Attorney Thomas could watch Playhouse 90 or Uncle Miltie till his heart’s content until sign off.\n\nAfter freshening up, Attorney Thomas would be ready for a night out on the town without ever having to leave the hotel complex. Thomas could start by shopping till he dropped in the Statler’s three-floor shopping arcade before wetting his whistle poolside in the hotel’s charming “Cocktail Garden” then a saunter off to one of the four Statler fine restaurants and finally, a night of hot rumba action in the swinging Terrace Room to the strains of Xavier Cugat before returning to his Studio Room. Well, that is if he had arrived two month’s later. Being the first guest was an honor to be sure, but it did have some drawbacks. None of those options were up and running yet and Attorney Thomas would had to satisfy himself at the one open Statler restaurant, the moderately priced Cafe Rouge The Statler’s official grand opening would take place several months later with events over a two-day period of October 26-27, 1952.\n\nAlthough the “gala” grand opening was actually a rather dull series of banquets, real excitement attended the inauguration of the swanky Terrace Room nightclub with a near riot breaking out that ultimately resulted in the tragic death of a security guard. While Xavier Cugat and his singing-dancing wife Abbe Lane were in mid set before the well-heeled, well-dressed, sell-out crowd, a pair of brothers, Alfonso and Victor de Casaus, got a little too rowdy and began flinging ice cubes, scoring a direct hit on Cugat. As house detectives descended, an argument ensued that quickly devolved into a melee. Suddenly, pandemonium broke out in the club with punches thrown, chairs overturned and screaming patrons running hither and yon as the brawl, which lasted for 20 minutes, literally rolled out the door and into the lobby. At some point, 66 year-old security guard, Thomas Patrick Tobin, was beaten so badly that he later died as a direct result of his injuries.\n\nWhile there were no more reported fracases breaking out at the Terrace Room, it quickly became one of 1950’s Los Angeles’ hippest hot spots with an eclectic variety of big name entertainers including Victor Borge; Billy deWolfe; Hildegarde; Dorothy Shay “The Park Avenue Hillbilly” Nelson Eddy; George Gobel; Gracie Fields; Dorothy Lamour; Ginny Simms; Carmen Cavallaro; Gogi Grant; and George Liberace, among others. Celeste Holm, a part of the hotel from its very groundbreaking, even put on an act in the Terrace Room.\n\nAlthough it was to have a nearly 60 year run, the hotel’s golden era was the 1950’s and 1960’s when it was ground zero for much action from business, politics and entertainment. Dwight D. Eisenhower became the first president of the United States to stay in the State Suite of the Statler, a hotel he was to visit a number of times both during and after his presidency. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson followed and then there was Ronald Reagan who not only was familiar with the hotel during his time as governor he had been the master of ceremonies at the “gala” 1952 Statler opening. Yet it was Richard M. Nixon, who was to become the president most closely associated with the hotel. Nixon was a frequent guest throughout the 1950’s and through his 1960 campaign for president. In 1961, after his term as vice president ended, Nixon and his family moved into the Statler while building their new home in the Trousdale Estates. And, of course, the hotel played a major role in his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1962.\n\nIn 1954, the Statler acquired a new name and a new owner when Conrad Hilton skillfully negotiated what was considered to be the largest single transaction in hotel history, with a deal for Hilton to acquire the eight Statler hotels for a reported $76,000,000. Hilton graciously declared that the name “Statler” would continue to remain with the hotels (although with “Hilton” added) in honor of Ellsworth Statler, a former bellboy, who built a hotel empire. It would remain the Statler Hilton until 1968 when it underwent yet another name change to the Los Angeles Hilton. Although the Hilton chain sold the hotel in 1983, they continued to manage the hotel all the way up until 1995 when it became for a brief period the Omni Los Angeles. In 1999, Korean Airlines, who had owned the hotel since 1989, changed it over to the Wilshire Grand.\n\nThroughout all this time the hotel remained a decent place to stay although by the time it changed over to the Wilshire Grand, the once ultra-modern Atomic age hotel was no longer looking or feeling so modern. Although they considered renovating the hotel, Korean Air ultimately decided to demolish and start completely over. In a fitting farewell, the hotel chose Richard Macias, a longtime guest who had been coming to the hotel since the 1960’s, to be the very last guest. Like the very first Statler guest in 1952, William H. Thomas, Macias was also an attorney. He checked out late on Friday December 21, 2011. It won’t be long now before the great old hotel checks out as well and Los Angeles loses another chunk of history.\n\nPhotographer Tom Barnes posted this fabulous image of part of the mosaic in the old Statler Center’s Petroleum Club on his Flickr stream. One hopes someone might be able to save some of these great mosaics before the hotel goes down, but…I’m not holding my breath. Check out Tom Barnes’ great Flickr page here.\n\nFor this installment of Blessed Buildings, we feature one of Hollywood’s most notable historic churches – the First Presbyterian @ 1760 North Gower Street. The Presbyterians were Hollywood pioneers, coming here the same year Hollywood gained it’s brief cityhood in 1903. In September of that year, the Rev. Dr. Henry A. Newell called the faithful to join him to meet in the still unfinished Masonic Hall on Highland Avenue. By December, they had officially organized with a total of 23 congregants. It was said that Dr. Newell made over 1,500 house calls, wearing out a buggy in the process, in the search for new parishioners. His efforts were a success and soon the flock was looking towards building a church structure of their own.\n\nThe Presbyterians purchased a large plot of land at the corner of Gower and Carlos Streets just below Franklin for $3,000 and built, at a cost of $15,000, a low slung, one-story plus basement structure that was so low-slung in appearance it was soon dubbed the “Presbyterian Storm Shelter.” This was always intended as a temporary structure until the funds could be found to complete the full church. And the funds were found. On November 6, 1909, the cornerstone was laid for a beautiful Gothic church structure designed by the noted Los Angeles firm of Eisen & Son, which was completed the following year.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1920’s, the congregation had grown to such an extent that plans were put in place for a new and grander structure to accommodate the rapidly growing flock. To design the new church there was really no question as to who it should be – Henry M. “H.M.” Patterson was virtually the “in house” architect when it came to Presbyterian churches in Southern California. A church member himself, Patterson would design literally dozens of Presbyterian churches from Lomita to Hemet beginning with one in his former home of Butte, Montana up until his death in 1928. For the Hollywood church, Patterson took his cue from Eisen & Son’s original and carried on with the Gothic theme faced in red brick and artificial stone except on a much grander scale. The grand new church would have seating for 1,592 spread out through the bowl-floored auditorium, choir loft, mezzanine and balcony. Pews and other interior details were finished in Philippine mahogany and an art stone known as Zenitherm for a handsome effect. The main church auditorium was to be only part of a complex that included Sunday School, study and lecture rooms, church offices and a cafeteria. The most dramatic element was to be an imposing 150-foot high Tower-steeple that would house a $25,000 set of bell chimes. Like a Hollywood super-production, costs on the church continued to rise from its original $150,000 in 1922 to more than $450,000 in 1924. But the cost was justified in the look of the beautiful new structure.\n\nDedicated on November 16, 1924, the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood immediately became one of the area’s most notable landmarks and one of its most popular churches with attendees coming not just from Hollywood but surrounding communities as well. In fact, by the 1960’s the church had grown to become the largest Presbyterian church in the world with a congregation exceeding 8,000 with nationally/internationally known pastors at its head. One of the best known, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, left the church in 1995 to become Chaplain of the United States Senate. Ogilvie was the second former pastor from Hollywood Presbyterian to be accorded the honor, the first being Dr. Richard C. Halverson. The church was also renowned for its missionary work\n\nAlthough the days of overflow crowds at the church has passed, at least at the present time, the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood remains one of Hollywood’s most visible, beautiful and historic landmarks. And for me it was a great thrill to discover that the original church structure, Eisen & Son’s charming Gothic edifice from 1910, still exists today! It was not demolished to make way for the new church, but rather, was sensitively blended by H.M. Patterson into the new structure as an annex and has been used for many years as a gymnasium. Correct me if I’m wrong (and I’m sure you will!) but this would make it the oldest extant church structure still standing in Hollywood – a real treasure of more than a century ago, even predating the arrival of the movies.\n\nThe First Presbyterian stands as one of Hollywood’s most important and historic ecclesiastical structures, but it is also an excellent example of the work of the very talented, but little remembered today, H.M. Patterson. Patterson has the unique distinction of having left a notable mark on two communities – Los Angeles (and environs) and Butte, Montana. Born in Ohio in 1862, Patterson came to Butte, Montana in 1881 at the peak of its fame as copper & silver bonanza town. Opening an architectural practice in the still wild and woolly frontier town, Patterson rose to become its most preeminent architect, bringing a sense of respectability and permanence to the town through a series of beautiful and carefully designed structures that ranged from the William Andrews Clark Jr. mansion to the First Presbyterian Church to the Mantle Block/Liberty Theater. At the turn of the Twentieth Century, Patterson relocated to Los Angeles where he would again rise to prominence becoming president of the South California chapter of the A.I.A., designing dozens of buildings throughout the Southland over the next quarter century. While Patterson is correctly remembered mostly as a church architect, he also designed many other structures including the Hotel Snow at 605 South Flower Street, schools, apartments, theaters and fine residences including one, the Rev. A.G. Fessenden Residence, that’s currently for sale. Although his church designs were mostly for the Presbyterians, Patterson did work for a variety of denominations from Jewish to Lutheran to Methodist to Episcopal. One of his best regarded works remains the beautiful edifice he designed for the First Congregational Church of Long Beach, which was completed in 1914. Patterson died on October 20, 1928 from complications resulting from a recent surgery. I thought you might enjoy a small sample of some of the work of H.M. Patterson.\n\nOne of H.M. Patterson’s earliest L.A. commissions was for the Rev. Alvah Grant Fessenden, pastor of the Grand View Presbyterian Church, which was also designed by Patterson. Located at 1051 North Avenue 64 in Highland Park and completed in 1905, the Fessenden House is currently for sale for $788, 500. More pictures of this beautiful house here.\n\nFor a very long time now I’ve wanted to highlight on the blog some of the historic properties that come up for sale in Southern California, but ADD has long gotten in the way. But since we are in lockdown for the evening here I have a little time before “lights out” so here goes. BTW there is nothing scientific about my choices, just places that caught my eye. Some might not even have any formal history per se but interested me for whatever reason. Emphasis here is of course on older places. If it works out, hopefully this can become a regular or at least semi-regular part of the blog as there are always at least a few great old places for sale out there. So please enjoy our first effort at Paradise for Sale. I can’t wait to read it myself! And you can bet that when appropriate we may have some tart commentary from the “Ladies of Paradise Leased” if they spot any spurious claims of celebrity provenance. But realtors never exaggerate so there should be no problems.\n\n2172 West Live Oak Drive – Los Feliz Terrace\n\nDesigned by Horatio W. Bishop A.I.A. for obviously successful mercantile broker Thomas J. Morris and his wife Pearl and completed in January 1934, this beautiful “celebrity owned” Mediterranean villa of 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms is currently on the market for $2,250,000. Built during one of the worst years of the Great Depression, this (originally) 11-room mansion was built for a mere $9,000 showing just how far a dollar could go in those day.. The three story house has incredible views and some great period details including beams and some great stained glass/leaded windows. Something that cheered me was that the bathrooms have not apparently been gutted, but have been “restored with rare custom tile work.”\n\nDuring the 1920’s, Horatio Bishop was the head of the architectural staff for developer J. Harvey McCarthy and, as such, left his mark down in Carthay (Center) Circle. I haven’t seen a lot of his work, but this house makes me curious for more. The broker for the listing is Stephanie Vitacco at Coldwell Banker. There’s a youtube video too here.\n\n1946 North Vine Street – Longview Tract\n\nThis Arts & Crafts style home is one of a number of really interesting and historic old houses up on Vine Street on the hill above Franklin Avenue. This house is actually the first one next to the condo complex. It appears to sit on a very large sloping lot (a third of an acre) that looks like it runs down towards Argyle. Unfortunately, I don’t know the architect yet, but I know it was built back in 1919 and was for a long time the home of former New York Congressman Thomas G. Patten. In Congress, Patten had been one of the earliest backers of the creation of the Federal Reserve system. He left the House of Representatives at the behest of President Wilson in 1917 to take of the duties of Postmaster of New York. Patten remained in this position until 1922 when his former boss as Postmaster General, Will H. Hays, sent him to Hollywood to serve as West Coast chief of the M.P.P.D.A. Patten and his wife Henrietta took up residence on Vine Street in 1922 and remained in their hillside home until Patten’s death in the house here at the age of 77 in 1939. Henrietta stayed in the house until she passed away @ 86 in September 1954.\n\nAlthough the home has undergone some inevitable changes through the decades, it looks like it still retains a great deal of vintage character. The listing states in is 3 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms in 2,574 sq. feet. It’s @ $899,000. Under a million for a third of an acre for a charming vintage Craftsman bungalow above Vine!\n\n2270 El Contento Drive –\n\nAlthough there’s a sale pending on this one, I couldn’t help but include it because I thought it was so cool. Built in 1949, the Streamline cutie reminds me of something the great Robert V. Derrah would have done. The house has 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths in just under 1,700 sq. ft. of space sited on a nice hillside lot, which gives the house some great views. There are also several terraces including one with a great outdoor fireplace. One thing sorely missing from this house is the little funicular rail that ran from the street up to the house back when it was first built. Why would they have taken that out?\n\nI thought it would be fun to read the original 1950 auction copy for the house:\n\nThis house was on the market for nearly a year before somebody snatched it up and it made several price drops from $940,000 to its latest of $715,000. It surprises me because the house is so cute, but it was a “short sale” so therein may lie the problem. The house is brokered through Century 21 and they are currently accepting backup offers. Maybe there’s still a chance! Break out the martini shaker.\n\n1300 Los Robles Place – Ganesha Hills, Pomona\n\nThis 1930 Mediterranean villa has been on and off the market over the last several years and it keeps getting my attention. I have never thought of living in Pomona before, but this house could make me a believer. If I had just seen photos of the house with no location I would have assumed it was in the Hollywood Hills. Of course, if it were, it would be considerably more than the $1,275,000 being asked for it in the Inland Empire. This house pushes nearly all my buttons when it comes to this type of house – beams, tile, wrought ironwork, arches, balconies, terraces, multiple fireplaces, tiled baths, views, pool, land, etc.\n\nToday, the house sits on 2.5 acres, but it appears to have originally been on many more and was a “family compound” of at least two houses. There is a second, slightly smaller, but no less charming “twin” right next door @ 1328 Los Robles Place. A few years ago, both were for sale at once and it would have been great to restore them as a compound. The garden paths and terraces were clearly connected. Pomona architecture and history is not my strong suit, but from what i’ve been able to gather, the houses were built by and for the Armour family, major pioneering figures in Pomona’s history. John Lester Armour designed the houses, with the bigger house for his mother and, I am assuming, the smaller for himself and his family. I personally think he did a pretty good job too!\n\nThe house has 4 bedrooms and 5 baths (3 full). At least one, I assume the Master bath, is a wonder to behold, a sunken Artesian (per listing) bath with an art glass window, that would have made De Mille proud. Another fascinating feature is in the garage of all places. It has a vintage automobile turnstile that still works. I have only seen one of these before and that was up at the old Ann Harding/Rudy Vallee estate, since lost. The concept is that one pulls their car into the garage and when it’s time to pull out again the turnstile would have turned the car around and facing outwards. A great concept and probably fun to watch! It also has a great saltwater pool that you could really do laps in.\n\nThe listing is brokered by Roxanne “Linda” Campbell of Coldwell Banker Millennium.\n\nThere are so many more than this. We will definitely try to do this again.\n\nToday we remember architect John De Lario for the fine work he did throughout the picturesque Hollywoodland development in the 1920’s. He did so many notable homes there it is easy to forget that De Lario also designed homes and businesses in other parts of the area as well (Not enough, in my opinion). In fact, one of his grandest commissions was a magnificent Italian villa designed for pioneer oilman Ralph B. Lloyd, not in Hollywoodland, but in Beverly Hills, completed in 1930.\n\nDubbed the “Father” of the famous Ventura Avenue Oil Field, Ralph B. Lloyd was an influential figure in the Southern California petroleum industry for a number of decades. Lloyd made millions in oil, but also made his mark in other fields as well including banking, real estate development and lumber up in Oregon.\n\nAlthough it was Ralph who exploited it, it appears it was his father Lewis who first discovered there was gas on their Ventura ranch and in the most dramatic way possible. A former captain in the Confederate Army, Lewis M. Lloyd had abandoned his beloved South for California during the great “Boom of the Eighties,” purchasing thousands of acres of land just outside of the historic town of Ventura. Organizing the Ventura Land and Water Company in 1887, the elder Lloyd dove earnestly into the cattle business, but it proved to be tough sledding. One day, while out on his land, Lloyd espied a brush fire. As he approached, he noticed a torch of fire billowing out of a fissure in the ground. While marveling at this strange sight the wind suddenly shifted and the flames from the surrounding grass roared menacingly at him at him at a speed neither he nor his horse could outrun. His horse was killed instantly with Lloyd barely escaping a similar fate by quickly leaping down a precipice into an adjoining canyon. It was as clear an indication as any that oil lay under the ground of the Lloyd ranch.\n\nAs surprising as it may seem today, Lewis Lloyd’s unwitting discovery of gas was not the welcome news it would be today and the elder Lloyd continued with his cattle operation. Hard as he try, however, the operation could just not turn a profit and by 1912 the venture was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was at that time that his son Ralph took over management of the ranch holdings, quickly bringing a new energy to the operation, literally as well as spiritually. The UC Berkeley-educated Ralph saw the vast potential in petroleum development and he undertook to shift the focus of the Ventura Land and Water Co. from cattle to oil leases. For a number of years he found little interest in getting major oil companies to explore his lands. When he finally succeeded the oil companies liked what they saw and he made a series of shrewd deals to drill on the family lands, which by then had grown to 8,000 acres. The result was the development of what was to become known as the Ventura Avenue Oil Field. Initial development began in 1919 and by the 1950’s, it was the 12th most productive field in the United States. Still operating today, it is estimated that a billion gallons of oil have been drawn from what was the lands of the Lloyd ranch.\n\nThis, as you might expect, made Lloyd, his family and fellow investors fabulously wealthy. Desiring a home for himself and his family befitting a man of his position, Lloyd engaged John De Lario to draw up plans for a grand estate to be built on a beautiful multi-acre view parcel he had purchased in Beverly Hills in the Ledgemont Park tract, part of the former 26-acre estate of “Borax King,” Thomas Thorkildsen, a spectacular baronial English Tudor mansion designed by Thomas Franklin Power and completed in 1913. The Thorkildsen mansion, which still contained considerable acreage, was now owned by fellow oil man Kirk B. Johnson and it is likely the two were friends.\n\nIn his design of the Lloyd mansion, De Lario pulled out all the stops creating a stunningly beautiful villa of great charm and distinction. Completed in 1930, the Lloyd mansion at 962 North Alpine Drive was a wonder to behold. Stretched out over seven levels over its lushly landscaped grounds, the home was considered one of the finest examples of this type of architecture found in all of Southern California.\n\nRalph B. Lloyd would live in his beautiful home for the remainder of his long life, sharing the house with his wife Lulu, his four daughters, and no doubt many, many servants. On June 16, 1948, Lulu Hull Lloyd passed away in the 44th year of their marriage. Eight months later, the 74 year-old Lloyd may have surprised some (or all) by taking a second trip down the aisle, marrying 51 year-old Edith Louise Nattkemper, a former school teacher who had been friends with Lloyd for some 30 years. When Lloyd died on September 9, 1953 at the age of 78, Edith came into a considerable fortune, splitting the bulk of the multi-million dollar estate with the Lloyd daughters. When Lloyd’s will was submitted to Probate on September 29, 1953, it was learned that Edith would also, in addition to the mammoth inheritance, also get $7,500 a month “family allowance.” Edith Nattkemper Lloyd was a very wealthy woman and, at 55, still young enough to enjoy it. Edith, however, had been suffering from a heart condition and less than 24 hours later she died at the Lloyd home, surviving her husband by just 21 days.\n\nWith both Ralph and Edith gone and the Lloyd children all with fine homes of their own, there was no one left in the big mansion on Alpine and it was sold. In 1958 the estate was broken up for inevitable subdivision and the beautiful Lloyd villa was taken down and replaced by a set of new homes.\n\nHis beautiful home may be gone, but Ralph B. Lloyd’s legacy has lived on in the form of considerable charitable giving, first through the Ralph B. Lloyd Foundation and then its successor of the Elizabeth Lloyd-Davis Foundation, among others. Over the decades, the Lloyd foundations have given millions to a variety of worthy causes and like the oil wells up in Ventura they are still giving and giving.\n\nLately, there’s been a passel, an absolute passel I tell you, of curiosity regarding “the staff” at Paradise Leased. Well, my dedicated cadre of helpmates are a bit publicity shy to be sure, but I think some sunshine might do them some good and a little credit where credit is due is much cheaper than a pay raise. You know the old expression that “Behind every great man there’s a great woman?” Well, I’m not a great man, not even close, so I need three great women to make a presentable showing. Fortunately, I’ve got them in the form of a trio of lovely maidens fair who are the real heart and soul behind this little venture of ours. I thank the Good Lord every day the Carnegie Library burned down in that still unexplained conflagration a few years ago thusly putting these brilliant little worker bees out of a job and making them available to little old me.\n\nAnd what wonders they are to behold at their tasks! Dedicated, forthright and unflagging in their pursuit of the true stories of historic Hollywood and its interesting architecture, the “Three Graces,” as they are affectionately called (or would be if anyone had any actual affection for them), are tireless researchers, spending their long days and often their long nights (at my request) digging through dusty old books, piles of yellowed newspaper clippings and obscure city records, to bring forth the often hidden truth to the light of day for our dear readers enjoyment. Nothing cheers my heart more than the sound of their crinoline skirts swishing about as they mutter their way through their appointed tasks while I catch up on the latest episodes of Judge Judy.\n\nGreat friends as much as great workers, these inseperable gals first met at the W.C.T.U. confab in ’74 (1874) and immediately bonded over their mutual love of Rutherford B. Hayes. A shared tragedy in the subsequent shocking, untimely and strangely coincidental deaths of their husbands by poisoned mushrooms brought them even closer. Deciding to “go west” to avoid the inevitable “embarrassing questions,” these impulsive ladies hopped the first available Butterfield Stage to “the Coast” and to what was then wild and wooly Los Angeles. After settling first at the pricey Pico House, the gals switched over to the more sensible Bella Union where they would remain until “progress” forced them to seek new quarters.. Over the next decades, progress became their sworn nemesis as they moved to, and were forced to move out of, an astonishing number of hotels and apartments including the Rex Arms; Gates; Westlake; Abbotsford; Baltic; Melrose; Westmoore; Hotel Hollywood; Mountain View; Engstrum; Crown Hill; Hershey Arms; Darby; Fremont; Pepper; Bellevue; Natick House; Melrose; Snow; Alvarado; Leighton; Lakeview; St. George; Cinnabar; Kipling; Ansonia; Abbey; Seminole; Northern; Broadway; Angelus; Lankershim; Shoreham; Ingraham; Barbara; Kaiser; Garden of Allah; Shelton Arms; Regent; Garden Court; Montecito; Bonnie Briar; Formosa; Peyton Hall; New Hollywood; and lately the Wilshire Grand. The gals are currently sequestered at the W and we are all terrified (well, not really) it might be next to be torn down.\n\nBut enough of my prattling on. Let’s let the ladies tell it themselves!\n\nDee Bunker\n\nDee may be known as the “bookworm” of the gals of Paradise Leased, but she is also the trio’s champion at Beer Pong. A Hoosier native, Dee loves collecting spoons from places she’s never been to or ever will be. She is not on the do-not-call list.\n\nTurn Ons: Title Deeds; Legible Building Permits; Corduroy; tea cozys; Lemon-scented Pledge; Mitt Romney’s hair; staring longingly out the window; anything by Will.i.am\n\nTurn Offs: Phony’s; “child proof” caps; any place that claims Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe or Rudolph Valentino lived there.\n\nBiggest Regret: Not playing the Irish Sweepstakes in 1936; posing for Playboy in 1978; Sheena Easton\n\nDora Doubter\n\nThe “Party Hearty” Paradise Leased gal. Dora is a vociferous reader who loves anything by James Patterson. She has been absolutely inconsolable over the death of Thomas Kinkaide whom she considers the greatest artist since Rembrandt.\n\nTurn Ons: Verifiable information on the people and places of vintage Hollywood; shirtless, sweaty firemen; Pontiac GTO’s; the Niagara bed; Justin Bieber; green corn tamales from El Cholo; Joe Biden\n\nTurn Offs: Long lines at Walmart; unsharpened pencils; kids today; xbox 360; the Greek debt crisis; that creepy Burger King “King”\n\nBiggest Regret: Giving herself a permanent wave while “high”\n\nNellie Naysayer\n\nThe Alpha and possibly Omega Female of the bunch, Nellie gave up a promising career in high fashion modeling for a much more rewarding life in library science. Nellie is an expert on rooting out false stories about Hollywood and squashing them like the bugs they are.\n\nTurn Ons: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nTurn Offs: Fellow human beings; life in general; the dawn; hand-operated can openers; ungrateful cats; thong underwear; the Kardashians; tearing down great old buildings for new $%^&*\n\nBiggest Regret: Not marrying Fred Harvey.\n\nSo, as you can see, I am ably assisted in the daily drudgery that is Paradise Leased. And while I continue to bask in all the glory, it is comforting to know there is so much wind beneath my wings.\n\nAnd yes guys – They’re single! And have been for a looong time.\n\nThis week’s “Blessed Building,” is one of the very first churches ever built in Los Angeles – the old St. Athanasius Protestant Episcopal Church at the corner of Temple and New High Streets at the base of Pound Cake Hill. Completed in 1865, this little church was the first permanent bastion of Episcopalianism in Los Angeles with all of ten congregants to populate it. Apparently there had been an earlier abortive attempt to establish an Episcopal parish in 1857 or 1859 (sources differ) with the organization of the parish of St. Luke’s. For whatever reason, however, the parish disbanded the following year and Episcopalianism went fallow in the City of the Angels for the duration of the Civil War. Towards the end of the conflict, a second attempt was made when a small group of Los Angeles Episcopals petitioned Bishop William I. Kip, the (first) Bishop of California, in San Francisco to please send a lay reader to conduct services for them. The Bishop heeded the call, appointing a young and dynamic 33 year-old Rev. Elias Birdsall to what was then the far flung outpost of frontier Los Angeles. Making the long and arduous trek from Indiana with his family by way of the Isthmus, Birdsall arrived in L.A. in mid-December of 1864 and began conducting services for the grateful congregation in the Odd Fellow’s Hall located in the Downey Block. Soon, however, enough funds had been gathered to build a permanent church structure. Fortunately for the Episcopalians, they really only had to build half a church as there was already a half-finished one sitting empty at the base of Pound Cake Hill. Originally started as a Presbyterian church in about 1863-1864, the incomplete structure was abandoned when the Presbyterians had run out of funds. The Episcopalians took over the property and completed the church, which they named Saint Athanasius after Saint Athanasius of Alexandria. The church quickly became known as “The Little Church on the Corner” for the possible reason that it was indeed a little church on a corner, but probably more because no one (including yours truly) seemed to be able to pronounce Saint Athanasius. Even the congregants must have had trouble and by the dawn of the 1880’s, the parish had renamed itself “St. Paul’s.”\n\nFor the next decade and a half, the Little Church on the Corner faithfully served the growing congregation until by 1882, they were making arrangements to build a handsome new Gothic edifice on Olive Street between 5th and 6th Streets. Built at a cost of $10,000 and with a capacity for 500 parishioners, the new church was a huge step up in size from the tiny one at Pound Cake Hill. The last services were held at the old church on Christmas Day 1883.\n\nThe Gothic designed church at 523 South Olive Street was home to the congregation of St. Paul’s from 1884 to 1922 and witnessed its rise from church to Pro-Cathedral to full Cathedral. Among the items placed into the cornerstone in its May 1883 laying ceremony was a Confederate States Five Dollar Bill, perhaps a reminder of the parish’s founding during the Civil War or perhaps just some old rebel parishioner who wanted to have a little rebellion built into the church’s very walls.\n\nAs fine a church as it was, St. Paul’s nonetheless could not keep pace with the mammoth growth Los Angeles was experiencing and by 1921, there were serious proposals afoot to demolish the cathedral and replace it with a new, bigger structure. However, that same year, they received a very generous offer for their land from the consortium planning on building the biggest hotel in the west (the Biltmore) on the site. The check was so big they were able to build as fine a new cathedral as they wanted on a new site and that’s exactly what they did. In February 1922, the congregation held its last service in what was now “old” St. Paul’s.\n\nTwo years later, the congregants were able to begin worshipping in their beautiful new cathedral, located at 615 South Figueroa Street, a structure of great beauty and charm designed by the powerhouse team of Johnson, Kaufmann and Coate.\n\nThe magnificent cathedral, which deserves (and will get) its own “Blessed Buildings” post would be home to the Episcopals for the next half century. One can only imagine what the original ten congregants would have said if they could have seen this elegant cathedral rising from the birth of little St. Athanasius in the 1860’s. And what would they say if they saw it demolished in the name of “progress” in 1980?\n\nAs for little old St. Athanasius, the grand daddy of St. Paul’s Cathedral, it led a productive second life as an annex to the Los Angeles County Court House, even serving for a time as the County Assessor’s Office. On April 6, 1888 it saw the founding of the Los Angeles Daily Journal, which printed its issues off an old Washington hand press. By the end of the 1880’s, the County made plans to transform Pound Cake Hill into “Court House Hill,” with the construction of Curlett, Cuthbertson & Eisen’s mammoth new red sandstone edifice crowning the hill, which meant the removal of the two structures presently on the site – the Los Angeles High School, which was physically moved across Temple to Fort Moore Hill (a story in itself!) and the little church, which wasn’t. In 1891, it was knocked down, returned to the dust from which it was born. When St. Athanasius was first built Los Angeles had a population of 5,000. By 1891, when it was demolished the population was over 100,000. The Little Church on the Corner had seen a lot of growth in its brief lifetime.\n\nToday, pretty much nothing is left of the church, the old high school, the courthouse, New High Street or even Pound Cake Hill and at the southeast corner of Temple and Spring Streets stands the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Courts Building. Or is there?…\n\nWell, there appears to be at least one remnant from old St. Athanasius that survives to this day and it’s a good one too. One the proudest elements in the otherwise modest old structure had been its bell, which had come all the way “around the Horn” by sailing ship in the 1860’s or 1850’s. (Sources differ) and which called the faithful to services each Sunday from 1865 to Christmas 1883. When the church moved to its new location on Olive Street, the old bell was given to another congregation, the Church of the Epiphany in Lincoln Heights. Completed in 1886 and located at 2808 Altura Street, the Church of the Epiphany is today the oldest Episcopal church structure in Los Angeles having outlived two St. Paul Cathedrals. The historic church was originally designed by famed church architect Ernest Coxhead and then later, in 1913, expanded and reworked by another great architect, Arthur B. Benton."
