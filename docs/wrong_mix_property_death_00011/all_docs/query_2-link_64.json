        "text": "Yes, absolutely! We can work with you to find the best combination of our spaces to best accommodate a range of capacities and event formats. Our rental options range from booking one individual space… to pairing two spaces together… to booking a full Museum buyout.\n\nOur standard venue rentals include exclusive use of the agreed upon event area(s), a dedicated Events Manager who will be with you through every stage of planning, security staff, janitorial services and basic museum engineering. Our theatre comes equipped with basic AV equipment and an A1 and A2 technician staffed for your event.\n\nCATERING: The GRAMMY Museum’s exclusive catering partner is Wolfgang Puck Catering. They work with all of our clients to create customized menus and packages that will meet and exceed your catering expectations. They deliver seasonal, personalized hospitality and are known for bringing world-class culinary experiences to every event. They will bring expertise and inspiration to your next event at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nEVENT RENTALS & DÉCOR: When it comes to your other event needs whether that be AV, florals, entertainment, furniture, decor and so on, we welcome you to work with any of your trusted contacts and companies and we look forward to meeting them if we haven’t already. The GRAMMY Museum does also work regularly with a number wonderful and reliable industry vendors and we’d be happy to provide you with suggestions upon request.\n\nIf the date is available, we would be happy to place a soft hold while the details are discussed and a contract is generated. A hold is not secure until a signed contract is returned with the required deposit. In the event that another party is interested in the venue before we receive these items, we will offer you a deadline to submit the contract and deposit before releasing the hold to the other party. If the date you requested has an existing hold, we will offer you the ability to formally challenge and the previous party will be given a deadline to contract. If they do not contract the space becomes yours and we will move to a contract.\n\nAn Event Licensing Agreement (ELA) will be issued upon client confirmation. It should be signed and returned within two weeks of receipt along with the deposit to confirm the space. An approved Certificate of Insurance (COI) will need to be provided seven days before the event date."
