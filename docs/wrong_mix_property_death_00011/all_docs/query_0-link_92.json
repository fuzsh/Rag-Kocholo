        "text": "Twelve-time Grammy-winning musician and composer Ray Charles died Thursday. He was 73.\n\nCharles died from acute liver disease at his Beverly Hills home, surrounded by family and friends, his spokesman Jerry Digney said.\n\nA legendary cross-over artist known for hits like Georgia on My Mind and What'd I Say, Charles spent his life shattering personal and musical boundaries and defying definitions.\n\nThough blind, he was a talented composer, singer and instrumentalist who dabbled in a host of musical genres, including country, jazz, big band and blues.\n\n\"I was born with music inside me,\" he wrote in his 1978 autobiography Brother Ray. \"That's the only explanation I know of.\"\n\nBorn to a poor family in segregated Georgia on September 23, 1930, Ray Charles Robinson was blind by the age of seven. He was sent to Florida's St. Augustine School for the Deaf and the Blind, where he developed his musical skills. He learned to read and write in braille and compose music in his head.\n\n\"Learning to read music in braille and play by ear helped me develop a damn good memory,\" Charles once said. \"I can sit at my desk and write a whole arrangement in my head and never touch the piano ... There's no reason for it to come out any different than the way it sounds in my head.\"\n\nBy the time he was 15, Charles was an orphan. He had also graduated from St. Augustine and soon set out on the road as a struggling professional musician in and around Florida.\n\nAfter a few years, Charles dropped his last name in deference to boxer Sugar Ray Robinson and moved to Seattle, where he became a minor celebrity locally. There, he took a young musician by the name of Quincy Jones under his wing and taught the future hit producer how to write music.\n\nCharles had a contract with Atlantic Records in the early 1950s and, in 1952, mixed gospel and rhythm 'n' blues for his song I Got a Woman. The genre was later dubbed soul and Charles hailed as the inventor. He began playing much more prestigious gigs, including Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nThough some radio stations banned 1959's What'd I Say because of suggestive moaning by his backup singers the Raeletts, the tune became Charles' first big hit. Later successes included Hit the Road Jack, I Can't Stop Loving You and Busted.\n\nCharles also turned the 1931 Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell tune Georgia On My Mind into an American standard and it became the state's official song in 1979.\n\nOver his half-century-long career, Charles won 12 Grammy Awards, nine between 1960 and 1966.\n\nThough most remember him as the smiling, swaying, sunglass-wearing musician seated behind a piano, Charles was no angel. He had a reputation as a womanizer and struggled with a heroin addiction for nearly 20 years before quitting in 1965.\n\nHe was still performing as recently as last year when, for the first time in more than 50 years of touring, he was forced to cancel a year's worth of scheduled concerts because of hip problems.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to withdraw from these shows,\" Charles said at the time. \"All my life I've been touring and performing...But the doctors insist that I stay put and mend for a while, so I'll heed their advice.\"\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer had planned to work on two new albums at his private studio while recuperating.\n\nHis last public appearance was April 30, when Los Angeles declared his studios, built in the city's centre 40 years ago, a historic landmark.\n\n\"Music's been around a long time, and there's going to be music long after Ray Charles is dead,\" Charles told the Washington Post in 1983.\n\n\"I just want to make my mark, leave something musically good behind. If it's a big record, that's the frosting on the cake, but music's the main meal.\""
