        "text": "They met in 1954 and married a year later on April 5, 1955, and were married for 22 years.\n\nRay’s drug use caused a great deal of strain in their marriage, as well as his affairs which produced a number of other children.\n\nWith Bea, Ray had three sons: Ray Jr, born in 1955; David, born in 1958; and Robert, born in 1960.\n\nHowever, his first child was a girl named Evelyn, born to him and Louise Flowers in 1949.\n\nOne of Ray’s most notorious affairs was with Margie Hendricks, one of the original Raelettes, which lasted six years.\n\nAll in all, he had six children during his marriage to Bea who were not born to her, and nine children in total during his marriage to her.\n\nRay’s youngest children were born almost 10 years apart, with Robyn being born to Gloria Moffett in 1978, and Corey being born to Mary Anne den Bok in 1987.\n\nWhile he had no more children, at the time of his death in 2004 he had been in a relationship with long-term partner Norma Pinella.\n\nRay has himself admitted how women are important to him and help him in his creative process, as well as becoming an ‘obsession.’\n\nHe told Jet magazine in 1978: “My obsession centres on women - did then (when young) and does now."
