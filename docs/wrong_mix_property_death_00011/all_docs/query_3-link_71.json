        "text": "Each state in America has its own history and unique flair. No wonder artists are often inspired by them. While some states have an official state anthem, artists have also released songs highlighting their birthplaces or favorite vacation spots. At times, these songs help make a state revered or memorable among listeners.\n\nFrom having a \"New York State of Mind\" to boasting about \"California Girls,\" here are 20 songs that mention a state in the title.\n\n1 of 20\n\n“Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia\n\nThere is no doubt that when people think of Alabama, the hit song from Lynyrd Skynyrd comes to mind. While “Sweet Home Alabama” has become a signature anthem for the state and some of its sports teams, it’s a bit hard to believe that none of the members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are actually from the state. Regardless, “Sweet Home Alabama” became the band’s biggest hit single.\n\n2 of 20\n\n“California Gurls” by Katy Perry featuring Snoop Dogg\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, Inc\n\nKaty Perry teamed up with fellow California native Snoop Dogg on their hit song “California Gurls.” The bubblegum pop production is perfect for the track as Perry and Snoop detail how no other women can compare to California girls. The song became a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n3 of 20\n\n“Arizona” by Kings of Leon\n\nPaul Morigi/WireImage\n\nThe story of Kings of Leon’s “Arizona” may be difficult to decipher lyrically. The band gave context to how the song details the band’s time going to a brothel in the state and questioning how a beautiful woman they saw ended up working there.\n\n4 of 20\n\n“Midnight Train to Georgia” by Gladys Knight and the Pips\n\nEugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Hospital for Special Surgery\n\nOne of Gladys Knight and the Pips’ most popular songs is “Midnight Train to Georgia.” The track tells the story of a man who wanted to start a new life in Los Angeles, but it didn’t work out how he hoped, so he’s making his way back to his hometown in Georgia.\n\n5 of 20\n\n“Tennessee Whiskey” by Chris Stapleton\n\nAdam Hagy/Getty Images for ABA\n\nCountry singer Chris Stapleton became a breakout star with his cover of “Tennessee Whiskey.” The intoxicating love song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n6 of 20\n\n“Hotel California” by The Eagles\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns\n\nThe Eagles’ hit song “Hotel California” draws listeners in with the smooth guitar sounds throughout the track. The song details the band's life and times of being in Los Angeles. “Hotel California” won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year.\n\n7 of 20\n\n“New York” by Ja Rule featuring Fat Joe and Jadakiss\n\nPrince Williams/FilmMagic\n\nNatives from New York usually seem to have some type of pride for their hometown. Ja Rule linked up with fellow Big Apple natives Fat Joe and Jadakiss to pay homage on their track “New York.” Produced by Cool & Dre, the song reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart.\n\n8 of 20\n\n“From Florida With Love” by Drake\n\nPrince Williams/Wireimage\n\nDrake is no stranger to releasing location tracks. In 2020, the rapper released the mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes, which featured previously leaked tracks and SoundCloud uploads. One of the standout tracks is \"From Florida With Love,\" in which the title refers to Drake being in Miami when he wrote the song.\n\n9 of 20\n\n“California Girls” by The Beach Boys\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nOn The Beach Boys’ hit song “California Girls,” the band realizes that girls from all over the country have great qualities. But there’s nothing that compares to a girl hailing from California. Like the second verse says, “I been all around this great world / And I seen all kinds of girls / Yeah, but I couldn’t wait to get back in the states / Back to the cutest girls in the world.”\n\n10 of 20\n\n“Georgia On My Mind” by Ray Charles\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nAlthough “Georgia On My Mind” was first recorded in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael, the song was made famous 30 years later with a rendition from Georgia native Ray Charles. A sweet ode to the Southern state that became the state’s official song in 1979.\n\n11 of 20\n\n“Tennessee” by Arrested Development\n\nMiranda Shen/Fotos International/Getty Images\n\nOn Arrested Development’s hit song “Tennessee,” the band details family ties and dealing with loss. On the track, the main singer asks God to guide him to another place, which ends up being Tennessee, his home state.\n\n12 of 20\n\n“Virginia” by Clipse\n\nTerence Rushin/Getty Images\n\nRap duo Clipse teamed up with The Neptunes on their debut album Lord Willin.’ One of the album's standout tracks is “Virginia,” an anthem on being a hustler in the state. Clipse and The Neptunes were born and raised in Virginia, so it’s only right for them to talk about the state they grew up in.\n\n13 of 20\n\n“New York State of Mind” by Billy Joel\n\nDerek White/Getty Images for ABA\n\nOne of Billy Joel’s signature tracks is the piano-driven “New York State of Mind.” On the track, Joel talks about how people like to take getaway trips to other cities like Miami or Hollywood, but he knows that nothing compares to New York.\n\n14 of 20\n\n“Blue Hawaii” by Elvis Presley\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nWhen listeners hear Elvis Presley’s rendition of “Blue Hawaii,” they hear that signature Hawaiian island sound. The title track was perfect for the Presley film and the soundtrack was a No. 1 smash on the Billboard 200 for 20 consecutive weeks.\n\n15 of 20\n\n“N.Y. State of Mind” by Nas\n\nDaniel Knighton/Getty Images\n\nNas paid homage to his hometown of New York on his track “N.Y. State of Mind.” Produced by DJ Premier, it was a standout track from his debut album Illmatic.\n\n16 of 20\n\n“All My Ex’s Live in Texas” by George Strait\n\nJason Kempin/Getty Images\n\nGeorge Strait’s hit single “All My Ex’s Live in Texas” tells how his ex-partners live in different parts of Texas. That’s the main reason why he doesn’t live there anymore. Strait highlights how he lives in Tennessee.\n\n17 of 20\n\n“Harleys in Hawaii” by Katy Perry\n\nJohn Shearer/Getty Images for Katy Perry\n\nKaty Perry’s “Harleys in Hawaii” is the type of song that should be added to any road trip playlist. On the track, Perry details that she wants to ride on the back of a Harley with her lover and explore a new town.\n\n18 of 20\n\n“Montana” by Justin Timberlake\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Children's Hospital Los Angeles\n\nJustin Timberlake teamed up with frequent collaborators The Neptunes on his song \"Montana.\" Although Timberlake briefly mentions the state at the end of the song, he lyrically talks about his love for his significant other.\n\n19 of 20\n\n“It Never Rains (in Southern California)” by Tony! Toni! ToneI\n\nPaul Natkin/Getty Images\n\n\"It Never Rains (in Southern California)\" is one of the more popular songs by the R&B group Tony! Toni! Tone! But don't believe the hype of the title. It does rain in the sunny state. On the track, lead singer Raphael Saadiq sings about flying to California to meet up with his lover.\n\n20 of 20\n\n“Ohio” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nJohn Shearer/WireImage\n\nIn 1970, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young released their protest song “Ohio.” The song was in reaction to the Kent State shootings that happened during that time. The song also criticized former president Richard Nixon to the point that some radio stations banned it.\n\nMya Singleton is a freelance music journalist and social strategist based in the Bay Area, with experience covering R&B and hip-hop.
