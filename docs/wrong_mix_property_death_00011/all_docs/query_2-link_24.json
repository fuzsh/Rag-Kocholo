        "text": "Trying to tell the life story of Ray Charles in an evening-length show is like trying to capture Mount Everest in a snapshot. The man was just too complicated, and his long and many-chaptered musical career too sweeping, to fit comfortably into musical theater’s constricting format.\n\nBut playwright Suzan-Lori Parks has thrown her considerable talents into just such a task. The result – a three-hour musical donnybrook called “Ray Charles Live!” – contains many of the same pleasures and frustrations as “Ray,” the 2004 biopic that drew both praise and criticism. (The movie’s producers are also behind Parks’ musical.)\n\nThe world-premiere production that opened Friday at the Pasadena Playhouse is brimming (some might say drowning) in great music: 29 songs with only two reprises among them. Director Sheldon Epps has assembled an impressive cast that’s mostly equal to the demands of Parks’ wide-ranging script and Charles’ music. The performers’ skill quotient is doubly impressive considering the top-drawer African-American talent Jason Alexander has assembled for his radically revised version of “Damn Yankees,” which is playing across town at UCLA.\n\nTo some, Parks might seem an odd choice for this project. She’s one of America’s most celebrated living playwrights, but she’s known for unconventional examinations of controversial topics. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Topdog/Underdog” is a tangled and incendiary tale of brotherly rivalry that addresses the most sensitive issues of race and poverty, and it’s typical of her work’s edgy tone. Pairing Parks with a Broadway-aimed musical is definitely a gamble of Disney/Julie Taymor proportions.\n\nTaymor, of course, combined her downtown roots with previously untapped commercial sensibilities to create “The Lion King,” a huge Broadway hit. “Ray Charles Live!” fits less comfortably into its hybrid skin. Parks wants to weave the dark side of Charles’ tumultuous life into the mix, and so we get smatterings of the “bad” Ray: his legendary cheapness, his womanizing, his 17-year heroin habit, his shoddy treatment of old friends on his way to the top.\n\nBut Parks hasn’t decided what her story’s central theme should be. Is it Ray’s redemption through music? The necessity of personal pain as a motivator for great art? The power of music to overcome racism and other ills? All of these issues are melded into Parks’ script, but they don’t form a synthesis. The show comes off as a leisurely catalog-survey through Ray Charles’ life and career, fitfully fascinating but without a through-line.\n\nAnd at just a hair under three hours, it’s long-winded. Parks is adept at fashioning satisfying beginnings and endings, but the middle of each act sags under the weight of too much exposition.\n\nStill, there’s a ton or two of fantastic music to enjoy. Parks has drawn upon a huge cross-section of Charles songs both famous and obscure: “What’d I Say,” “Leave My Woman Alone,” “Mary Ann,” “I Got a Woman.” There are also plenty of tunes by others that Charles made famous, such as “Hit the Road, Jack,” “Mess Around” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You.”\n\nParks has devised a convenient frame for her tale. After launching the evening with a spirited performance of “What’d I Say,” Charles (Brandon Victor Dixon) tells us that he’s come back from the dead to record one last album.\n\nThe event is a reckoning of sorts: each track Charles lays down, with the help of his faithful producer Tom Dowd (Matthew Benjamin) and the participation of Charles’ family, friends, colleagues and many women, recounts an event from his life. We meet his saintly mother Retha (Yvette Cason); see the drowning of his brother George and the sudden onset of Ray’s blindness. Then we’re led through a more-or-less chronological retelling of Ray’s career, from impoverished Jacksonville, Fla. bar pianist to his formative years in Seattle, a rapidly rising national reputation, his relationship with Atlantic Records’ Ahmet Ertegun (Daniel Tatar), and his eventual superstardom.\n\nAlong the way, Parks exposes Charles’ many vices: booze, heroin, self-absorption and girls, girls, girls. We learn such titillating details as his Braille Method of evaluating female comeliness (it involves the long, lingering exploration of a woman’s wrist and arm). Those who saw the film, of course, already know about such things; our familiarity with “Ray” sometimes works against Parks’ story.\n\nThough her “last session” structural conceit gives Parks the license to cherry-pick the biographical high points of Charles’ life, one wishes for a less straightforward approach that’s better at linking childhood trauma to adult behavior, early hurts with later peccadilloes and slights.\n\nMany will be willing to set aside the play’s problems, though, because this production is full of stop-the-show performances. Dixon doesn’t try for slavish imitation – his singing voice sounds nothing like Charles’ – but he captures the essence of the performer’s hipster charm. Cason delivers a stirring “Drown in My Own Tears,” but she’s by no means the only powerhouse voice in the ensemble. A clever trio version of “I Can’t Stop Loving You” showcases Ray’s women, all lamenting his frustrating combination of sexiness and sin: his wife Della B (Nikki Renee Daniels) and two of his lovers, Mary Ann Fisher and Margie Hendricks (Angela Teek and Sabrina Sloan). All are exceptional.\n\nThe entire evening offers similar embarrassments of riches. Rahn Coleman leads a 10-piece onstage band that has mastered Charles’ often tricky arrangements, from gospel to country, R&B and jazz. Choreographer Kenneth L. Roberson has come up with some dazzling ensemble numbers. The Raeletts, as costumed by Paul Tazewell, are dripping with bling and radiate the requisite come-hither vibe. Similar veteran Broadway talent has been brought to bear on all aspects of the show: set designer Riccardo Hernandez, lighting designer Donald Holder, orchestrator Harold Wheeler.\n\nWith all this raw talent orbiting the project, “Ray Charles Live!” has a chance of achieving focus and excellence. But Parks must first sit down and perform writing’s most difficult job: get busy with the red pen."
