        "text": "Charles Wayne Hendricks is the son of the late Ray Charles. His father estimates that he has at least eleven siblings from seven or more mothers.\n\nRay’s oldest child is now 73, while his youngest is 36. His first marriage was to beautician Eileen Williams, and he had been married twice.\n\nIn 1951, Ray, then 24, married Williams, but their union ended a year later in 1952. Afterward, in 1955, Della Howard Robinson, the pianist’s ex-wife, wed him again.\n\nThey had three sons, Ray Jr., David, and Robert. After 20 years together, Ray and Robinson divorced in 1977. The breakup of Ray and Robinson’s marriage was caused by Ray’s infidelity, including two paternity suits.\n\nMargie Hendricks, one of his Raeletts backup singers, bore Charles Wayne Hendricks, the Georgia native’s son.\n\nIn Harlem, Hendrix gave birth to their son, and Ray paid the bills and promised to take care of him.which he died\n\nHendricks lives a private life away from the public eye. However, he became a celebrity in 2013 when he and his half-siblings won a lawsuit to stop the termination of song rights.\n\nHendricks’ mother died when he was a young child\n\nIt was a difficult time for Charles Wayne Hendricks when his mother passed away when he was still a child. After her father fired her for having an affair with trumpeter John Hunt, she died in 1973.\n\nWhen Hendrix was still married to his second wife, Robinson, he met Ray. When Hendrix was 23 years old, she had moved to New York to live with her older sister Lula.\n\nShe slept with Ray regularly until she discovered she was pregnant. After discussing their new circumstances, they decided to keep the child.\n\nIn 1959, Hendricks was born, but his father and mother did not see him as often as they would have liked. She died after Ray fired Hendrix, leaving behind their young child.\n\nThere is no evidence that Charles Wayne Hendricks led a public life\n\nIt was Charles Wayne Hendricks’ choice to live a private life. Regina King starred in the biopic of his father, “Ray.” He might have even avoided participating. In the 2004 film, King played the role of his beloved mother.\n\nIn an interview, the Academy Award winner revealed that she didn’t know whether the crew members reached out to Hendricks, adding that he wouldn’t take part if they had.\n\nRay’s life and career, from his roots in the South to his rise to stardom during the 1950s and 1960s, are explored in the movie.\n\nHis son Hendricks was not involved in the film, but he was part of the lawsuit about the termination of song rights, which he and his siblings won.\n\nThe majority of Ray’s children (two of whom were in jail) were told they would inherit $500,000 each once he died, and years after he died, they attempted to obtain rights to his music under termination clauses under copyright law.\n\nThis proved difficult since the Ray Charles Foundation, where most of his estate was left, sued the children claiming they violated their father’s agreement. It was, however, a victory for them.\n\nA total of 11 half-siblings exist for Charles Wayne Hendricks\n\nRay Charles Robinson Jr., David Robinson, Robert Robinson, Reatha Butler, Alexandra Bertrand, Robyn Moffett, Evelyn Robinson, Raenee Robinson, Sheila Robinson, Vincent Kotchounian and Ryan Corey Robinson of Bok are all half-siblings of Charles Wayne Hendricks.\n\nRay Jr., Robert, Raenee, and Corey Hendricks were mostly involved in controversies over their famous father’s estate.\n\nAs part of a recent interview, Hendricks’ older half-brother, Ray Jr., candidly spoke about their late father. Even though he was blind, the 17-time Grammy Award winner taught him how to ride a bicycle.\n\nRay was an attentive father who loved to play chess and taught his child independence. “I think that was a driving force in his life. It had to be because of his discipline and what he was able to do,” said Ray Jr. about his iconic father. “You Don’t Know Me” is a book he wrote about the alto saxophonist. He died on June 10, 2004."
