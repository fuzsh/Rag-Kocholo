        "text": "Just last week we’ve seen another edition of the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, a Formula 1 racing event that first started back in 1929 – and it never gets old for Formula 1 fans around the world.\n\nThe Monaco Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious motor racing events in History and is also known as one of the most difficult tracks to race on, given the fact that it has many tight corners and a tunnel that racing drivers need to go through. The circuit runs through the Principality of Monaco and is held every year, with the only inactivity periods having occurred during World War Two and, a few years later, in 1949, 1951,1953 and 1954. The event has run consecutively since 1955 with most of its winners coming from the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, France and Australia.\n\nSebastien Vettel’s victory\n\nThe 2017 Monaco Grand Prix was the 75th race held in the history of the event. It took place on the 28th of May and, as always, it was preceded by three free practices that started on Thursday, the 25th of May.\n\nIn the first free practice run, Lewis Hamilton, from Great Britain, took the lead, and Sebastian Vettel, who would turn out to be the undisputed winner of this year’s Formula 1 Monaco GP, got a close second place.\n\nDuring the second free practice, victory belonged to Sebastian Vettel with Daniel Ricciardo and Kimi Räikkönen coming in in second and third place, respectively.\n\nAt the third and final free practice, Sebastian Vettel achieved first place once again, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in second and his fellow countryman Valtteri Bottas following him in third place.\n\nTeams involved and the triumph of Ferrari\n\nAt the top of the racing teams involved in this year’s Monaco Grand Prix was Scuderia Ferrari, the racing division of Ferrari. Both the winner and second place holders belong to this Italian team, that has got a long tradition in Formula 1.\n\nSergio Marchionne referred to this year’s Monaco GP as something that will be part of Ferrari’s history. Still referring to the team’s astounding success at the race, the CEO of Ferrari added: ‘Not only a victory, but a one-two finish at a Grand Prix with a tradition as glorious as Monaco, where Ferrari last won with another one-two, delivered on that occasion by Schumacher and Barrichello. My compliments to the drivers and, once again, the whole team (…).’\n\nThe second most relevant team competing at this year’s Monaco GP was the Red Bull Racing Formula One Team. Both third place winner Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, the Dutch-Belgian race driver that became the youngest driver to compete in Formula 1 at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix at the age of 17, belong to this American team, that has achieved impressive results since it first came to exist in 2004. Other teams at the race included Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, Scuderia Toto Rosso, Sahara Force India F1 Team, Haas F1 Team, McLaren Honda, Renault Sport Formula One Team, Williams Martini Racing and Sauber F1 Team.\n\nThe second most relevant team competing at this year’s Monaco GP was the Red Bull Racing Formula One Team.

There are 78 laps in each GP edition, which add up to a total of 161.734 miles race. The fastest lap raced during this year’s Monaco GP belonged to Mexican race driver Sergio Perez, 1:14.820 on lap 76.\n\nIf you’re anything like us, we’re sure you can’t wait for next year’s exciting moments at the next edition of Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nApply Now\n\nWhilst Creditplus can’t supply you with the powerful cars driven by Formula 1 legends like Vettel, we can surely supply you with a wide range of vehicles, that you can find through our extensive car search.\n\nGet in touch with our Customer Advisors today on 0800 1777 290 or apply by completing our simple, 2-minute application form, and we can find you your dream car and the best finance deal to go with it."
