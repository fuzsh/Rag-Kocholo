        "text": "A CHRONOLOGY OF GROSSE POINTE WOODS\n\n1679 Lake Sainte Claire was christened by Father Louis Hennepin, chaplain to LaSalle, because their vessel, the Griffin, entered the waters of the lake on August 12, the feast day of Sainte Claire. (See 1879)\n\n1701 Travelling by canoe, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, accompanied by soldiers and voyageurs, passed southward through Lake St. Claire on July 2. The following day he established Fort Pontchartrain on the future site of Detroit.\n\n1740 Burton’s History of Detroit states that most of the riverfront had been taken up for farms, from which we may conclude that at least part of Grosse Pointe was settled that early.\n\n1749 The French government offered farmers the incentive of free tools and stock to settle new territory surrounding Detroit.\n\n1752 The manuscript maps of Chaussegros de Lery suggest little settlement at this time beyond the Grand Marais. The big swamp extended, along the river and the lake, from the present Waterworks Park in Detroit into Grosse Pointe.\n\n1760 On November 29, Captain Francois de Bellestre formally surrendered Fort Pontchartrain to British forces led by Major Robert Rogers, thus ending French rule in Michigan.\n\n1769 French farmers with names such as Marsac, Chovin, Reneau and Bonhomme owned “ribbon farms” which extended 40 arpents (c. 1 ½ miles) inland from the lake. The portion of their land which later became Grosse Pointe Woods remained wilderness known only the Indians and the “coureurs de bois.”\n\n1796 On July 11, thirteen years after the Treaty of Paris was signed, Captain Moses Porter raised the Stars and Stripes over Detroit for the first time.\n\n1796 Though Grosse Pointe Woods continued to be a wilderness, portions of it were already claimed as part of farms belonging to members of the Tremble, Reneau, Allard, Vernier, Griffard and Bonhomme families.\n\n1796 A Land Board was instituted to determine the ownership of all private claims out to Gaukler Point.\n\n1802 For a brief period, our area was part of the Indian Territory.\n\n1805 A crucifix 20 feet high, carved by an Indian, stood on the bank of the lake just beyond Vernier Road. (See 1825)\n\n1805 Individuals with land in our area traveled to the Land Office in Detroit to establish legal ownership of their tracts as required of all landowners by an 1804 Act of Congress. These private claims were numbered in the order that they were received. Aaron Greely was employed by the government to survey all Private Claims in the Detroit area.\n\n1812 Detroit’s involvement in the War of 1812 led to General William Hull’s surrender of Fort Detroit to the British, under General Brock, on August 16. Occupying troops, hostile Indians and a lack of food made the next two years very difficult for the local population.\n\n1813 Having driven away marauding Indians, the Americans under General MacArthur entered Detroit, from which the British had recently fled, on September 27.\n\n1814 The Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, ended the War of 1812.\n\n1818 The first Great Lakes steamer, Walk-in-the-Water, docked in Detroit on August 24, thus beginning an era of expansion and settlement.\n\n1825 St. Paul Cathedral Church obtained title to part of P.C. 223, the site of the Indian Crucifix near Vernier Road and the lake. Father Francis Badin built a log structure in which to hold services. Serving all of Grosse Pointe, this church was the first parish in the region. It was the only parish until 1865. (see 1805)\n\n1827 Our area was part of Hamtramck Township which was established on April 1. Col. John Hamtramck was the U.S. troop commander at Detroit when the British evacuated at the end of the Revolutionary War. (See 1848, 1927, 1931 and 1950)\n\n1832 The first Asiatic cholera epidemic was brought to Detroit by soldiers on their way to the Black Hawk War in western Wisconsin. As other epidemics followed during the next twenty-two years, the impetus increased to settle some distance from the city.\n\n1836 On May 18, thirteen civic-minded women founded the Ladies’ Orphan Association of Detroit following a cholera epidemic. That institution became the Children’s Home of Detroit on Cook Road. (See 1951, 1986 and 2000)\n\n1837 Michigan became the 26th state on January 26. Stevens T. Mason was the first governor. (See 1927, 1929, 1941 and 1979)\n\n1848 Grosse Pointe Township was created on April 1 from the southeast portion of Hamtramck Township. It stretched from approximately St. Jean in Detroit to the Macomb County line and from Lake St. Clair to beyond Gratiot Avenue. (See 1827, 1927, 1931 and 1950)\n\n1850 Grosse Pointe was an established farming community. Between the Provencal Farm and Vernier Road were homesteads belonging to the Verniers, Allards, Tromblys and Thibaults. Beyond Vernier Road lived the Reneaus (Renauds), Allards, VanAntwerps and Robert-Johns. Because of the marshy character of the interior, most cultivation occurred near the lake. Nevertheless, property inland was being acquired by the Greiners, Salters and Joseph Campeau.\n\n1860 Before this year Vernier Road was the area’s major, and perhaps its first, road from Lake St. Clair. It is said to have been named for Jeremiah Vernier.\n\n1860 Belgians such as the Michies, Brys, Vanderbushs and Verheydens settled in the future Grosse Pointe Woods. Initially many worked as tenant farmers especially on Private Claims north of Vernier Road.\n\n1860 The Clinton Rd., later known as Mack Ave. (possible named after Col. Andrew Mack, 1782-1857), was a simple dirt road connecting inland farms with downtown Detroit.\n\n1865 On August 4, Dudley Woodbridge, son of the former governor and senator William Woodbridge, purchased the western third of P.C. 577. He named the property Belle Meade and, for health reasons, settled here as a gentleman farmer.\n\n1867 Louis L. Beaufait sold August Cook P.C. 619 farmland on October 8. This land later became the site of the Grosse Pointe Hunt Club. (See 1906 and 1911)\n\n1875 To increase drainage in the marsh along the future Chalfonte Road, the Black Marsh Ditch was deepened in the hope of creating a continuous waterway between the Milk River and the Fox Creek. Neither this nor three future attempts ever fully achieved this objective. It has been said the Indians had been able to travel by water, to avoid a rough lake, up the Milk River (entrance at our Lakefront Park), through the Black Marsh and down Fox Creek. (See 1928, 1958, 1992 [2], 1995)\n\n1879 A bicentennial celebration was held in Grosse Pointe to commemorate the christening of Lake St. Clair. The event included a sailboat regatta, speeches, poems, and songs. (See 1679)\n\n1880 On April 13, Gusselmas Vanderbush (Vanderbussche) obtained a part of P.C. 156 from Cornelia Vernier. Daniel Vanderbush acquired another parcel of similar size from the estate of Isadore Vernier. In 1898, these neighboring plots were combined under the ownership of Daniel Vanderbush. Members of the family continued to provide Grosse Pointe with fresh corn and produce from this lad well into the 1950s. The farm was the site of the future Grosse Pointe North High School. (See 1964 and 1968) The farmhouse, which was on Morningside Drive, was demolished on March 12, 1970.\n\n1881 Michael Van Antwerp purchased P.C. 156 farmland on both sides of Mack Ave. at Vernier Rd. at Vernier Rd. from his parents, Francis and Appoline (Pauline) Vernier VanAntwerp. This was the site of the future Parcells Middle School. (See 1951)\n\n1886 George S. Davis, Park Davis & Co. Vice President, bought P.C. 621 from Edmund Kearsley on February 3. By 1890 he had expanded his holdings, which he called Clairview, to Include parts of P.C. 619, 620, and 393. (See 1892)\n\n1890 One-third of land was purchased from the Louis and Matilda Cook farm on January 13 so that Fractional District 9 of Grosse Pointe and Gratiot townships could build the Cook School on Mack Ave. The cost of the property was $160,000. The one-room school, located at 20276 Mack Ave., was probably built and opened in 1890. (See 1922 and ????)\n\n1892 The Clairview Jersey Stock Farm located in the rear of the George S. Davis property was an established Grosse Pointe showplace with 28 well-equipped buildings, prize winning livestock and advanced breeding methods. (See 1886)\n\n1898 The Detroit, Lake Shore and Mt. Clemens Electric Railway began interurban rail service operations. The 26-mile route was from Detroit via Jefferson, Fisher, Grosse Pointe Blvd., Moross, Kercheval, Weir Lane, Lake Shore/Jefferson, and Crocker Blvd. into Mt. Clemens.\n\n1900 While some areas of Grosse Pointe were becoming residential, the future Grosse Pointe Woods remained primarily farmland cultivated by longtime French, Dutch, and Belgian Families: Vernier, Beaufait, Allard, VanAntwerp, Vanderbush, and Brys. They were generally truck farmers producing carrots, tomatoes and beets.\n\n1906 Frank Cook deeded over land for construction of the “highway” which is known today as Cook Rd.\n\n1911 On November 17, the Grosse Pointe Riding and Hunting Club, now known as the Grosse Pointe Hunt Club acquired the August Cook farm for its activities. Though much modified, the original brick Cook home houses the present Clubhouse. (See 1867)\n\n1911 Dr. Harry N. Torrey and his wife, Nell Ford Torrey, purchased P.C. 621. The back portion of this property came to be known as Torrey Woods.\n\n1917 The Lochmoor Club was founded on February 23. One hundred thirty-six acres were purchased for $150,000 and came mainly from the farms of Theodore Beaufait, Michael VanAntwerp, and Bellonie V. D’Hondt. The golf course opened on June 29, 1918. (See 1924, 1969)\n\n1921 The Grosse Pointe Public School System was organized and the first meeting of the new Rural Agricultural School District 31 was held on February 6, 1922. Cook School on Mack Ave. (Fractional District 39) was one of the original five schools that were consolidated. After June of\n\n1922, classes were not held in the one-room Cook School and the children were bussed to Old Kerby School on Kerby Road. (See 1890)\n\n1922 The first bus line began operating in the area that would become Grosse Pointe Woods. It started in Detroit at the end of the Mack Ave. Streetcar Line and continued out Mack to 9 Mile Rd. (then Defer Rd.) and then to Jefferson. There, it probably made connections with the Shore Line Interurban Line that ran between Mt. Clemens and Detroit. (See 1895 and 1927)\n\n1924 On February 26, the original Lochmoor Clubhouse, which was an abandoned farmhouse, was destroyed by fire early in the morning. A new Clubhouse opened in 1926. (See 1917 and 1969)\n\n1927 On January 4, the Village of Lochmoor (now the City of Grosse Pointe Woods) was incorporated. The area was formerly a part of Grosse Pointe Township. The first President was Edmund C. Vernier and the initial meeting of the governing body was held in the Detroit Motion Picture Company studio on Vernier Rd. (See 1827, 1848, 1931 and 1950)\n\n1927 The Deanhurst Bus Line connected the Village of Lochmoor with downtown Detroit. Originating in St. Clair Shores, it allowed passengers to transfer to Detroit-bound busses on Jefferson. It was also an important link with the new Grosse Pointe High School when it opened in 1928. (See 1895, 1922, and 1928)\n\n1928 Grosse Pointe High School (now Grosse Pointe South High School, located at Fisher Rd. and Grosse Pointe Blvd.) was completed and occupied on February 1.\n\n1928 A trunkline sewer and a Marter Road pumping station were constructed at a cost of 3,300,000.\n\n1928 The Renmore Golf Course was built on land owned by Dr. George L. Renaud. The golf course was just south of the Lochmoor Club. (see 1947 – St. Michael’s Church)\n\n1928 Joseph E. Beaufait was elected President of Lochmoor Village. He was the son of Theodore Beaufait. Joseph was a leader in the community and the Township. As a real estate developer, he named Lennon Street after his mother’s maiden name.
