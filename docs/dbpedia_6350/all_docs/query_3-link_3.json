Even in a rigidly regulated world like Formula 1, the most famous street circuit in the world is allowed a few variations.\n\n22 October 2000\n\nAPOTHEOSIS FOR THE SCUDERIA\n\nMalaysian GP\n\nTwo weeks after winning the Drivers’ title with Michael Schumacher at the Japanese Grand Prix, Scuderia Ferrari arrived at the Malaysian Grand Prix on 22 October for the last race on the calendar.\n\n12 March 2000\n\nTHE SCUDERIA KICKS OFF WITH A ONE-TWO FINISH\n\nAustralian GP\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix, the traditional season opener of the World Championship, is a special date on the calendar for everyone in the sport.\n\n15 May 1999\n\nSCHUMACHER OVERTAKES LAUDA\n\nMonaco GP\n\nOn 15 May 1999, the Monaco track was the setting for the fourth race of the season and everyone was expecting another episode in the saga which had dominated Formula 1 since the previous year: Michael Schumacher versus Mika Hakkinen.\n\n11 May 1997\n\nVICTORY AFTER A 16-YEAR DROUGHT\n\nMonaco GP\n\nOn 11 May 1997, the unique setting of the Principality of Monaco was all set as the backdrop to a Grand Prix which was always fascinating.\n\n11 June 1995\n\nALESI’S PERFECT BIRTHDAY\n\nCanadian GP\n\nThe Canadian Grand Prix was a much-loved event for Scuderia Ferrari, especially ever since the race was held on the semi-permanent track on the Ile Notre Dame in Montreal.\n\n31 July 1994\n\nThe end of nearly four years without a victory\n\nGerman GP\n\nThe Ferrari team, which took part in the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship, had a clear objective.\n\n26 March 1989\n\nThe revolutionary F1-89\n\nBrazilian GP\n\nThousandths of seconds can make the difference between winners and losers.

It would be the third time that the title had gone down to the wire...\n\n6 September 1964\n\nSurtees gets back in the fight for the title\n\nItalian GP\n\nThe 1964 season was one of the hardest fought in the history of Formula 1.\n\n18 June 1961\n\nFerrari clean sweep at Spa\n\nBelgian GP\n\nThe 1961 Formula 1 season would go down as one of the best ever for Scuderia Ferrari, even if it ended on a heartbreaking note.\n\n23 August 1953\n\nASCARI’S SECOND TITLE\n\nSwiss GP\n\nThree weeks on from Farina’s victory for Ferrari in Germany, it was generally expected that the world championship would be wrapped up at the Swiss GP.\n\n2 August 1953\n\nFARINA’S LAST GP\n\nGerman GP\n\nIt was Farina’s first win with Scuderia Ferrari, but it was also the last in his extraordinary career.
