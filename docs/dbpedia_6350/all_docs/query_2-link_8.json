It featured the 4th World Championship of Drivers,[1] which was contested over nine races between 18 January and 13 September 1953.[2] The season also included several non-championship races and a separate East German Championship.\n\nAs in 1952, all races counting towards the Formula One championship, except the Indianapolis 500, were held for cars complying with Formula Two regulations. A couple of non-championship races were still run under Formula One regulations.\n\nThe World Drivers' Championship was won by Alberto Ascari driving for Scuderia Ferrari.[3][4] Ascari became the first driver since the inception of the championship in 1950 to successfully defend his title. It would be his last title, as well as the last for any Italian driver, as of 2024."
