        "text": "The F1 schedule has expanded to a record 24 races for the F1 2024 season, with the calendar more packed than ever.\n\nWe have now passed the halfway point of the F1 2024 campaign, with the European season in full swing and the teams in full flow as the calendar takes in its traditional heartland, before returning to the ‘flyaway’ races later in the year.\n\nWhich race is next on the F1 schedule?\n\nRound 15: Dutch Grand Prix\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix will host the first race back after F1’s annual summer break in late August.\n\nIt has become a highlight of the season since it returned to the calendar in 2021 (it was scheduled to return in 2020 only for the pandemic to cause a year-long delay), with the passionate Dutch spectators creating a fun atmosphere at the compact, fun and deceptively tricky Zandvoort circuit.\n\nWhen is the Dutch Grand Prix?\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix will take place from Friday 23 until Sunday 25 August, with the race getting underway at 3pm local time [2pm BST] on Sunday 25 August 2024.\n\nWhere is the Dutch Grand Prix?\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix is held at the historic Zandvoort circuit, which is located on the North Sea coast and is close to Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands.\n\nThe Zandvoort layout was designed by John Hugenholtz, the same man who designed the legendary Suzuka circuit in Japan.\n\nWhile it may lack the outright driving challenge presented by Suzuka, Zandvoort shares some of its characteristics with a number of sweeping bends offering an examination of a driver’s confidence and commitment.\n\nThe highlight of the lap is arguably Turn 3, which was reconstructed ahead of F1’s return to incorporate some oval-style banking. The final corner was also been remodelled into a banked turn.\n\nZandvoort was a regular fixture on the Formula 1 World Championship between 1952 and 1985 before a 35-year hiatus.\n\nThe event’s revival has been largely credited to the success of Max Verstappen, the Red Bull driver and reigning three-time World Champion.\n\nVerstappen is unbeaten at Zandvoort since the Dutch Grand Prix returned to the calendar, winning from pole position at his home race in every season since 2021.\n\nHe will arrive at the this year’s race as the leader of the F1 2024 World Championship standings.\n\nIs the Dutch Grand Prix an F1 Sprint weekend?\n\nNo, the Sprint format will not be in place for the Dutch Grand Prix, with the next running of the Sprint set to come at the United States Grand Prix at Austin in October.\n\nFor a full rundown of the Sprint format, we have you covered right here.\n\nWhat records are in progress during the F1 season?\n\n👉 F1 2024: Head-to-head qualifying records between team-mates\n\n👉 F1 points all-time rankings: Where do Hamilton, Verstappen and Alonso feature?\n\nWhat are the F1 session times for the Belgian Grand Prix?\n\n[All times local, BST in brackets]\n\nFriday 23 August\n\nFP1: 12:30pm-1:30pm [11:30am-12:30pm]\n\nFP2: 4pm-5pm [3pm-4pm]\n\nSaturday 24 August\n\nFP3: 11:30am-12:30pm [10.30am-11.30am]\n\nQualifying: 3pm-4pm [2pm-3pm]\n\nSunday 25 August\n\nRace: 3pm [2pm] [72 laps or 120 minutes]\n\nWhich races remain on the F1 2024 schedule?\n\nRound 15: Dutch Grand Prix, Zandvoort, August 23-25\n\nRound 16: Italian Grand Prix, Monza, August 30 – September 1\n\nRound 17: Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Baku, September 13-15\n\nRound 18: Singapore Grand Prix, Marina Bay, September 20-22\n\nRound 19: United States Grand Prix, Austin, October 18-20*\n\nRound 20: Mexico City Grand Prix, Mexico City, October 25-27\n\nRound 21: Sao Paulo Grand Prix, Interlagos, November 1-3*\n\nRound 22: Las Vegas Grand Prix, Las Vegas, November 21-23\n\nRound 23: Qatar Grand Prix, Lusail, November 29 – December 1*\n\nRound 24: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Yas Marina, December 6-8\n\n[* – Denotes F1 Sprint weekend]"
