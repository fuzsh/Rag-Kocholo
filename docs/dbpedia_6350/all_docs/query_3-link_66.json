        "text": "Ferrari will send off the European campaign of the Formula 1 season in style, unveiling this week a one-off celebratory livery, complete with new overalls and race helmets, for its home Italian Grand Prix.\n\nThe success in question being marked is the team’s victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June, Ferrari’s first win at the world’s most famous endurance race since 1965.\n\nOf course in the F1 world Scuderia Ferrari has little to celebrate.\n\nWatch the Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix 2023 live and ad-break free in racing on Kayo Sports on Sunday, 3 September, at 11:00pm AEST. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\nThe 2023 season has been a disappointing one, made only more painful by the fact it started last year, the first under new regulations, not just as a championship contender but at one stage as a comfortable title leader.\n\nIts competitiveness tailed off badly though 2022, precipitating the departure of team principal Mattia Binotto and a wide-ranging team reshuffle by the hand of new boss Frédéric Vasseur.\n\nBut then this year started even worse. It had been jumped by both Mercedes and Aston Martin for outright competitiveness, and now even old foe McLaren is threatening to overhaul it in the constructors championship.\n\nPerhaps it’s the risk of finishing fifth in the constructors championship — which would be its second-worst result in more than 40 years, behind only its sixth-place finish in the Covid-affected 2020 campaign — that’s forced it to final reckon with a core truth it’s long avoided admitting to.\n\nFerrari is back in the rebuild.\n\nTHE REALISATION FINALLY DAWNS\n\nFor so long this season Ferrari has projected an air of confidence that it’s only a few upgrades or other tweaks away from resuming its rightful place as a victory contender.\n\nIt’s had a vaguely justifiable reason to as well, with the SF-23 on average the most competitive qualifying car behind Red Bull Racing.\n\nOver the first five rounds of the season Ferrari was on average 0.189 seconds behind RBR on one-lap pace, and Charles Leclerc pinched sprint and grand prix poles in Azerbaijan.\n\nBut its performance in the races has been markedly less impressive.\n\nLeclerc turned those P1 starts into podiums, but only twice more has a Ferrari driver stood on the rostrum.\n\nThe drivers say the crux of the issue is an unpredictable car platform. From corner to corner the car switches from oversteer to understeer, and those characteristics change wildly depending on the tyre compound. Sometimes the car changes attitude in the middle of corners.\n\nThat manifests itself in diabolic tyre wear, leaving the drivers helpless to defend lofty qualifying positions or move forward in races.\n\nMajor concept-changing upgrades ameliorated but didn’t eliminate these problems. Meanwhile, as the team attempts to troubleshoot its issues, it’s slipped further down the competitive order.\n\nOver the last five dry qualifying sessions — the weekend’s Dutch Grand Prix included given Q3 was dry enough for slicks — Ferrari’s gap to Red Bull Racing has ballooned to 0.498 seconds.\n\nA trend line running through the season suggests the team is falling away from pole position by around 0.015 seconds per round. It’s resultantly now behind both Mercedes and McLaren on pure-pace terms. Only Aston Martin is behind it now among the leaders.\n\nWith the fig leaf of qualifying pace blown away, the team has accepted it’s further behind on its mission to win races than first thought.\n\n“For us it’s crystal clear what we did wrong with the car and which are the weaknesses,” Ferrari head of chassis Enrico Cardile said, per Autosport.\n\n“It’s clear; it’s not a matter of understanding what we should do. Now for the future it’s a matter of delivering a good product which will cope with the targets we have.\n\n“We are not in ‘nowhere-land’. What we have to do is a matter of doing, it’s a matter of finding the right contents of the car, the right architecture for the car to achieve the target.”\n\nCardile revealed that next year’s car won’t be an evolution of this year’s machine, as the 2023 model had been of last year’s race winner.\n\nThe slate will be cleared for a fresh crack at the regulations.\n\n“It will be very different, because developing this year’s car we realised that some architectural choice we did was not right. It was constraining too much the development,” he said.\n\n“It will be a brand-new car — a different chassis with different design and a different rear end — to allow to better develop the car to achieve the targets.”\n\nThe rest of this season will be to devoted to ensuring the team deeply understands every flaw in the 2023 car to ensure the same mistakes aren’t repeated next year.\n\n‘A NEVER-ENDING PROCESS’\n\nBut a rebuild is about more than just rewriting the car. Team principal Vasseur says no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of stabilising his wayward team.\n\n“I’m not sure [Red Bull Racing] have one area in which they are so much better than everyone else,” he said, per ESPN.\n\n“It’s not a matter of [car] concept or anything like this; I think they’re performing in every single pillar of the performance — drivers, chassis, engine, aerodynamics, suspension, strategy — and that’s why we have to improve.\n\n“I think it would be a mistake to think, ‘Okay, they are much better than us in this area, let’s go for a full push on this one’. We have to try and get the best out of what we have in every single area and to do small steps everywhere.\n\n“We’re talking about a 0.2-second gap, and it’s not 0.2-seconds in aero; I think it’s more 100 times 0.002 seconds or 10 times 0.02 seconds.”\n\nFor Vasseur, the mission to improve goes beyond rearranging pieces on the chessboard, and he’s warned Ferrari fans not to expect and overnight turnaround.\n\n“For sure we’re not getting the results we were expecting, and that means like every other single team on the grid we need to be on continuously improving mindset,” he said.\n\n“The most difficult part of the job is understanding what’s going well and what is going wrong and where we can improve.\n\n“We are recruiting a lot. We have already made some internal reorganisations and we are moving forward.\n\n“We’re trying to get that last couple of tenths we are missing today, but we are in the middle of the process, and it is in fact a never-ending process.”\n\nRecruitment takes time in Formula 1, especially in the current cost-cap era, when experienced engineers are more valuable than ever. Already Ferrari has talked about securing some big names that can’t start at Maranello until next year or even 2025, meaning their impact won’t be felt until as late as 2026.\n\nBuilding a fresh-concept car also brings risks with it. Aston Martin’s big jump forward really started around halfway through last year, and it’s not quite a regular podium contender. McLaren’s step forward was likewise envisaged late in 2022.\n\nIf Ferrari is starting now, it would need all stars to align to fire from the blocks as a race winner in 2024.\n\nITALY COULD STILL BE A HAPPY(ISH) HOMECOMING\n\nIt’s a sobering message to the tifosi who’ll be piling into the Monza grandstand for this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix.\n\nThe team is already coming off the low ebb of perhaps the worst weekend of its campaign to date.\n\nZandvoort’s long medium-speed bends were kryptonite to the SF-23.\n\nOf all the teams that made it through to the dry Q3, Ferrari was comfortably the slowest, behind even the Williams.\n\nAnd while Ferrari has often stood accused of bungling its race-day performances, it executed pretty cleanly on Sunday and still ended up buried in the pack.\n\nCharles Leclerc’s long first stop waiting for his intermediate tyres was the only wrinkle, but even then that was on the driver, not the team, with the Monegasque having radioed that he was coming into the pits only as he entered the lane. Damage subsequently ended his race early.\n\nCarlos Sainz’s race was almost perfect yet somehow grimmer. The Spaniard’s strategy was flawless after his first stop, and he drove a strong and clean race but still finished fifth behind two Red Bull Racing cars, an Aston Martin and an Alpine and only just ahead of a Mercedes and a McLaren. Better strategies from some key rivals would’ve surely seen them and perhaps even a Williams ahead of him.\n\n“Honestly, today we nailed the calls except for the first stop,” he said. “But the reality is that once the race settled, we were nowhere.\n\n“I would say, after looking at the Alpine, we have the sixth-fastest car this weekend.”\n\nNo-one expects Alpine to become a regular top-five contender for the rest of the season, with both cars having qualified outside the top 10 but benefiting from good strategy. But given the field behind Red Bull Racing is as close as it’s even been, that’s not enough for the Scuderia not to be keeping an eye on its mirrors.\n\nThe good news for now, though, is that this weekend’s Autodromo Nazionale Monza should on paper be more agreeable a circuit.\n\nThe Ferrari car has reasonable straight-line performance — remember that pole in high-speed Baku, even if that was several months ago now, and it was competitive in Belgium too — and the track isn’t especially hard on tyres, with this usually being a one-stop race.\n\nCome Sunday night Ferrari’s most recent victory is still likely to be its Le Mans win from earlier in the year, but at this stage the home fans will surely take a competitive performance with the promise that things might start looking up next season."
