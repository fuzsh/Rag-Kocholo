        "text": "Lance Stroll signs contract extension with Aston Martin\n\nUpdated: Thursday 27th June. Lance Stroll will remain at Aston Martin, signing a new contract which will see him stay with the Silverstone-based team to the 2026 F1 regulation changes and beyond. Stroll’s signature means that Aston Martin will field an unchanged pair of drivers for the third consecutive year, following Fernando Alonso’s contract extension announced back in April.\n\nThe Canadian has been with Aston Martin since 2019 and has scored 11 points so far this season. \"I'm super happy to have committed to staying with the team for 2025 and beyond,” said Stroll. \"It's amazing to see how far we've come in the last five years; we've grown so much as a team and there's still so much more to look forward to.\"\n\nAston Martin Team Principal, Mike Krack, said: \"We are delighted to confirm Lance's future with Aston Martin Aramco. He has played a key role in building this team. His technical feedback, alongside his committed simulator work, has helped contribute to the continuous development of the car each season.\n\n“We look forward to creating some more incredible memories and achieving further success together.\"\n\nPierre Gasly signs a multi-year contract with Alpine\n\nUpdated: Thursday 27th June. Pierre Gasly has agreed a new contract with Alpine which will secure his future through to 2025 and beyond. Gasly, who’s contract was set to expire at the end of the 2024 season, joined Alpine in 2023 and has scored 67 points, and one podium at the Dutch Grand Prix.\n\nHe has only scored one point so far in 2024 amid a testing time for the French constructor, and tensions between Gasly and his departing team-mate Esteban Ocon have flared on track, notably in Monaco when the pair collided. However, with it confirmed that Ocon will leave at the end of the year, and the return of Flavio Briatore in an advisory capacity, it seems Alpine are now looking to the future.\n\nOn signing his new contract Gasly said: “I feel very much at home at this great team. I enjoy being a real part of both the Formula 1 project and the wider Alpine Cars vision. I’ve been officially here for over 18 months and it has always been the plan to build a long-term project with the Team.\n\n\"While on-track it’s been a challenging season so far, I remain faithful to the project and I am not going anywhere. I am happy with the changes made, the hard work, and the direction the team is taking.”\n\nAlpine Team Principal, Bruno Famin, said: “the extension of Pierre’s contract with the team is very pleasing. He is a driver with huge experience in Formula 1 and continues to show huge amounts of potential on-track.\n\n“For Alpine as a brand, he is a great ambassador and we therefore look forward to continuing our collaboration.\"\n\nTeam\n\nEngine\n\nDrivers\n\nStake\n\nFerrari\n\n77.

Logan Sargeant\n\nFlavio Briatore returns to F1 as Alpine advisor\n\nUpdated: Friday 21st June. Alpine has announced Flavio Briatore, who was Team Principal of the Enstone team during its Benetton and Renault years, will return in an advisory role. He left Renault in 2009 for his part in the ‘Crashgate’ scandal, and was initially banned indefinitely from F1 by the FIA before getting that sanction overturned in 2010.\n\nAs Executive Advisor, Briatore is expected to report directly to Renault CEO Luca da Meo, and he returns to the team just as questions are raised internally about the viability of continuing to develop Alpine’s own engine.\n\nBriatore oversaw championship triumphs for Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso at Benetton and Renault respectively, and remains part of Alonso’s management team.\n\nIn a statement, the team said: “BWT Alpine F1 Team can confirm that Flavio Briatore has been appointed by Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo as his Executive Advisor for the Formula 1 Division.\n\n“Briatore will predominantly focus on top-level areas of the team including: scouting top talents and providing insights on the driver market, challenging the existing project by assessing the current structure and advising on some strategic matters within the sport.”\n\nSergio Pérez signs new Red Bull contract until end of 2026\n\nUpdated: Wednesday 5th June. Sergio Pérez will continue to race for Red Bull in Formula 1 until at least the end of the 2026 season after signing a new two-year extension to his contract. Much speculation had surrounded the future of Pérez, with drivers including Carlos Sainz available for the coming season, and with the Mexican driver failing to win a race so far in 2024.\n\nBut that speculation was quashed with the announcement of a brand new contract. Speaking of the announcement team boss Christian Horner said: “Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo. Continuity and stability are important for the Team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.”\n\nOcon to leave Alpine F1 at the end of 2024\n\nUpdated: Monday 3rd June. Esteban Ocon will leave the Alpine F1 team at the end of the 2024 season after the pair “agreed to part ways”. Ocon’s contract was due to expire at the end of 2024 anyway, but after his collision with team-mate Pierre Gasly at the Monaco Grand Prix, team boss Bruno Famin hinted at “consequences” beyond just the loss of points in the race.\n\nOcon joined Alpine at the start of the 2019 season, and the high point of the all-French relationship was his, and the team’s, first and only Formula 1 victory at Hungary in 2021. Since then, Ocon has brought another podium at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix, to add to the one he scored at Sakhir in 2020, but as the team has slid further and further backward his relationships with various team-mates have been called into question.\n\nFirst, he clashed with Fernando Alonso, who said he was looking forward to “finally’ not working with Ocon after an incident with him in São Paulo before Alonso joined Aston Martin. More recently, his fractious relationship with Pierre Gasly, which began long before they became team-mates, has seen multiple blue on blue collisions.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement Ocon said: “It’s been a significant period of my life to be racing at this team in Formula 1. While I’ve been here for five years as a full-time racing driver, my professional career started at Enstone back when I was a teenager, so it will always be a special place for me.”\n\nFamin added: “We would like to firstly thank Esteban for his commitment to the team for the past five years. During his time, we have celebrated some fantastic moments together… We wish Esteban the very best for the next chapter of his driving career when that moment comes.”\n\nRelated Reading\n\nOcon to leave Alpine ahead of 2025 Formula 1 season\n\nRead More\n\nFernando Alonso signs Aston Martin contract extension until 2026\n\nUpdated: Friday 12th April. Fernando Alonso has signed a contract extension that will keep him at Aston Martin until the end of the 2026 Formula 1 season.\n\nAlonso joined Aston in 2023 and completed his most successful season in F1 since his days at Ferrari in 2013, scoring eight podiums on the way to fourth in the championship. The team’s performance has been less impressive so far in 2024, but the team is preparing to welcome Honda as its new engine partner from 2026, when the next era of powertrain regulations come into force.\n\nThe two-time world champion has a bleak history with the Japanese engine builder after the failed project at McLaren, but the manufacturer has since delivered world championship success for Red Bull.\n\nAston Martin’s acquisition of Honda power is something of a master stroke as the team seeks to manifest its own championship dreams. Alonso will be hoping for one last push to make himself a three-time world champion.\n\nLogan Sargeant to miss Australian Grand Prix\n\nUpdated: Friday 22nd March. Williams F1 driver Logan Sargeant will miss the Australian Grand Prix following team-mate Alex Albon’s heavy crash in practice.\n\nWilliams has chosen to prioritise the Thai racer who has brought it the bulk of its points over the last two seasons in F1. Albon was forced to miss second practice following his FP1 crash, and with Williams not having a third chassis on site in Australia the decision was taken to switch Albon into Sargeant’s car for the weekend.\n\nSpeaking of the news Sargeant said: “This is the hardest moment I can remember in my career and it’s absolutely not easy. I am however here for the team and will continue to contribute in any way that I can this weekend to maximise what we can do.”\n\nAlbon added: “I have to be totally honest and say that no driver would want to give up his seat. I would never want anything like this to happen. Logan has always been a consummate professional and a team player from day one, and this won’t be easy for him to take.\n\n“At this point though, I cannot dwell on the situation and my only job now is to maximise our potential this weekend and work with the whole team to make sure we do the best job possible.”\n\nExplaining the situation Williams Team Principal James Vowles called the lack of spare chassis “unacceptable. “It’s unacceptable in modern day Formula 1 not to have a spare chassis,” he said. “But it is a reflection of how behind we were in the winter period and an illustration of why we need to go through significant change in order to get ourselves in a better position for the future.”\n\nThanking Sargeant for his “graceful acceptance” and “dedication to the team” Vowles continued: “While Logan should not have to suffer from a mistake that he did not make, every race counts when the midfield is tighter than ever, so we have made the call based on our best potential to score points this weekend.”\n\nBearman to replace ill Sainz in Saudi Arabia\n\nUpdated: Friday 8th March at 11:35. F2 racer Oliver Bearman will replace Carlos Sainz Jr. at Ferrari for the rest of the Formula 1 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after the Spaniard was diagnosed with appendicitis.\n\nSainz will be forced to undergo surgery, in a similar manner to the way that Alex Albon was ruled out of the Italian Grand Prix in 2022. He will be replaced by 18-year-old British Ferrari junior Oliver Bearman, who took pole position for the feature race in F2 qualifying on Thursday.\n\nBearman will take over from FP3 on Friday and forego the two rounds of the F2 championship scheduled for this weekend to make his F1 debut in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs a result, the Prema team has withdrawn the pole-winning F2 car from the reaminder of the weekend.\n\nHaas F1 announces Oliver Bearman as reserve driver for 2024\n\nUpdated: Thursday 1st February. Oliver Bearman, member of the Ferrari Driver Academy, will take up duty as reserve driver for both Ferrari and Haas F1 in 2024.\n\nThe 18-year-old will be on standby for the team to fill in for one of either Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen should the need arise, alongside his commitments in Formula 2 where he will race once again for Prema.\n\nIn his new role as Haas reserve driver, Bearman will have the opportunity to take part in six Free Practice sessions throughout the 2024 season at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, Spanish Grand Prix, British Grand Prix, Hungarian Grand Prix, Mexico City Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\nHe’ll be looking to build on the experience he gained in 2023, where he drove for Ferrari in Practice for both the Mexico City and Aby Dhabi Grands Prix.\n\nBearman joins the Haas team alongside Pietro Fittipaldi, who continues his role as reserve driver from 2023.\n\nAlphaTauri to be renamed Visa Cash App RB for 2024\n\nUpdated: Wednesday 24th January. After months of speculation, finally it's been confirmed that Red Bull’s second team, formerly known first as Scuderia Toro Rosso, and then as AlphaTauri, will be rebranded yet again as Visa Cash App RB from the 2024 F1 season.\n\nCatchy it is not, but lucrative? It certainly looks as though this is a big money deal, because the Visa brand is not only providing the name for the former AlphaTauri outfit, but has also signed on as a global partner for parent Red Bull.\n\nAs a result, the Visa logo will feature on all four Red Bull cars in 2024, and the Visa colours will also be used for Red Bull’s F1 Academy entrant this season.\n\nDrivers Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda return to the newly named Visa Cash App RB team in 2024, and the livery for the new partnership will be revealed on 8th February.\n\nGuenther Steiner leaves Haas\n\nUpdated: Wednesday 10th January. After ten years at the helm, Guenther Steiner has left his role as Team Principal of Haas F1 after his contract was not renewed for the 2024 season.\n\nHe was part of the initial effort to set up the Haas team, which eventually made its F1 debut 2016, and has held the position as Team Principal for all of its eight years in the sport to date.\n\nIn the past five seasons, Haas has finished no higher than eighth in the constructors’ championship. The team finished tenth and last in 2021 and 2023, and even a move to the more experienced driver pairing of Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen did little to boost its prospects.\n\nTeam owner Gene Haas said: “It came down to performance. I'm not sitting here saying it's Guenther's fault, or anything like that, but it just seems like this was an appropriate time to make a change and try a different direction”\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s about performance. I have no interest in being tenth anymore.” He adds, “I can’t understand how we can be with all the equipment and people we have.”\n\nAyao Komatsu, previously an engineering director for the team, will step up to fill the role of Team Principal from the 2024 season.\n\nSauber team rebrands as Stake F1 Team\n\nUpdated: Thursday 4th January. The Sauber team that has raced under many guises in its 30-year history will compete as Stake F1 Team for the 2024 season.\n\nFollowing the departure of Alfa Romeo, which lent its name to the team from 2019 to the end of 2023, questions were raised over what Sauber would do while it awaits the incoming takeover by Audi in 2026. Previously, in the wake of its partnership with BMW, the team reverted to its Sauber identity, but this time it has taken on the name of a key sponsor in Stake.\n\nThe full name of the team will be Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber, but it will known from day-to-day as Stake. Kick, the other prime sponsor of the team, has claimed the naming rights for the chassis for the next two seasons. The 2024 car will be called the Kick Sauber C44.\n\nLogan Sargeant retains his seat at Williams\n\nLogan Sargeant has been confirmed as the final piece in the puzzle for the 2024 F1 grid. Williams announced he had retained his drive alongside Alex Albon after a challenging rookie season.\n\nHis place in the sport appeared to be under sever pressure through the second half of the season as he struggled to get to grips with his car in the face of a barrage of speed from his hugely impressive team-mate.\n\nHe was outqualified 22-0 by Albon in 2023, and scored only a single point at the US Grand Prix at COTA. But Williams, led by Team Principal James Vowles, had seen enough to offer Sargeant another season to prove himself.\n\nTsunoda and Ricciardo to race for AlphaTauri in 2024\n\nUpdated 25 September 2023 at 11:19: Yuki Tsunoda and Daniel Ricciardo will race in Formula 1 for Scuderia AlphaTauri in 2024. The pair have been team-mates at Red Bull’s junior team since AlphaTauri released previous driver Nyck De Vries following the British Grand Prix.\n\nAfter De Vries got his marching orders former Red Bull driver, and eight-time Grand Prix winner, Ricciardo joined as Tsunoda’s team-mate. Ricciardo has missed the last four races, and probably Qatar as well, after breaking his wrist in practice for the Dutch Grand Prix.\n\nHis spot has been filled by Liam Lawson, who has impressed in his time in Formula 1 so far, but not, it seems, enough to win the seat full-time. The decision means that Tsunoda will remain with AlphaTauri for a fourth F1 season. The Japanese has a highest finish of fourth – in the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and currently has three points to his name in 2023.\n\nPiastri remains with McLaren in F1 until 2026\n\nUpdated Friday 22 September at 15:21: Oscar Piastri will race in Formula 1 until at least the end of the 2026 season after signing a new multi-year deal with McLaren.\n\nThe Australian youngster, the subject of a legal wrangle between Alpine and McLaren last season, has faced a much simpler task in securing his seat for a second season in F1. Piastri has impressed with his performances for McLaren this year, often running more experienced team-mate Lando Norris close.\n\nHis current deal already included the 2024 season, but McLaren has moved quickly to include two more years after six points finishes which included fighting Max Verstappen for victory in the Belgian Sprint.\n\nMcLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella said: “It’s fantastic to confirm that Oscar has signed a multi-year extension with the team.\n\n“Oscar is an asset to McLaren and constantly impresses with his performance, work ethic and attitude, so it was an easy decision for the team to make.\n\n“He has already proved pivotal to the team, so it’s brilliant to have his vote of confidence as we push to win championships again in the future. I look forward to seeing him develop with us as we continue this journey together.”\n\nZhou returns to Sauber F1 for 2024\n\nUpdated: Thursday 14th September at 14:50. Zhou Guanyu will continue to race in Formula 1 with Sauber after agreeing a new contract with the Swiss team that currently races under the Alfa Romeo name.\n\nThe news means that the team's line-up will remain unchanged for a third consecutive season, with Zhou's team-mate Valtteri Bottas already signed to a multi-year deal that ends next year.\n\nWhile both will race for the same team, the name of that team for next season remains to be seen. Alfa Romeo will end its title sponsorship of Sauber at the end of the 2023 F1 season, following the team's purchase by Audi. With the Audi name not set to enter F1 until 2026, when new engine regulations will arrive, it's unclear at the moment what name Sauber will use in 2024 or 2025. We at GRR would be all for a return to the historic Swiss fan favourite.\n\nHamilton and Russell stay with Mercedes until 2025\n\nUpdated: Thursday 31st August 2023 at 16:00. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell have signed contracts to remain at Mercedes until the end of the 2025 Formula 1 season, the team has announced.\n\nHamilton’s contract had been due to run out at the end of this season, but both Hamilton and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff had made positive noises about the eight-time world champion staying for longer. Russell was believed to already have a contract for 2024, but this has been extended by an extra year.\n\nThe confirmation leaves only four spaces left to be confirmed for 2024. One at Alfa Romeo/Sauber, two at the soon-to-be-renamed AlphaTauri team, and one at Williams.\n\nWho will be racing at Red Bull?\n\nLet’s start with the 2021, 2022 and (most likely) 2023 world drivers’ champion, Max Verstappen. Unless he has a massive brain flash and decides he’s had enough of F1, he’ll be racing at Red Bull in 2023. His team-mate Sergio Pérez also has a contract but we can never be totally sure with Red Bull can we? Should his form not pick up in the coming races, anything could happen, especially with the looming form of Daniel Ricciardo waiting in the wings at AlphaTauri.\n\nWill Mercedes and Ferrari keep the same drivers in F1 2024?\n\nThis one feels almost certain to be the case. In fact, there’s only one of these four drivers yet to be under contract, and we know that negotiations to renew Sir Lewis Hamilton’s contract for next year are well underway. George Russell’s contracted until 2024 and, given he is a long-term project for the team, he’ll more than likely to stay.\n\nAt Ferrari, both Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. have contracts in place for the 2024 season. That said, unless Ferrari ups its game soon, its hungry drivers (both who see themselves as potential champions) could be turned should an ambitious team come knocking.\n\nIs Fernando Alonso staying in F1 in 2024?\n\nThe double F1 champion has a contract with Aston Martin to the end of 2024 and will most likely honour at least that. He has stated that beyond 2024 he only plans on signing single year deals until he’s ready to quit. But given the performance of the Aston Martin F1 car in 2023, and the way Alonso seems to have integrated himself into the team, it seems unlikely he’ll move.\n\nHis team-mate Lance Stroll does not have a contract for 2024 at the moment, however his father owns the team and bought into it in part to secure Lance’s F1 future there. Nevertheless, Lawrence Stroll has hinted that he wouldn’t put Lance above the health of the company, so if Stroll Jr.’s form doesn’t pick up (Alonso’s comprehensively outperformed the Canadian in 2023) don’t be 100 per cent sure he’s staying.\n\nWhat about Williams and Alpine in F1?\n\nAlex Albon is contracted to remain at Williams until the end of next season and has stated that he is happy with his role at the legendary British team. If it can keep up its promising early trajectory under new boss James Vowles there should be no reason for Albon to leave. But his performances have been eye-catching in the lacklustre blue machine, and other teams have been watching. His team-mate for 2024 is yet to be confirmed. Rookie Logan Sargent is currently in the seat, but is yet to truly convince. Whether he gets a new contract is yet to be seen.\n\nAlpine on the other hand has both of its drivers tied up to contracts until the end of 2024. Esteban Ocon has been with the team for a long time now, and it would seem odd for him to be let go. Meanwhile, Pierre Gasly was a high level pick to bring in from the Red Bull family. The bigger question is now over the future of the team. The chaos in the background, with team boss Otmar Szafnauer departing along with several others, has led to speculation on Renault’s commitment to F1. Should its Le Mans programme bear fruit faster you wonder if the plug might be pulled on F1 again.\n\nWhat will Alfa Romeo Sauber be called next year?\n\nWe don’t know. The deal for the team to be named Alfa Romeo ends at the end of 2023 and it won’t become Audi until 2026. So there’s a two-season gap to be filled before the German giant joins F1. Could it race as Sauber for a couple more seasons or will a big-name sponsor come in temporarily?\n\nEither way, Valtteri Bottas will be in the new car, which will still use Ferrari engines. What we don’t know is who his team-mate will be. Zhou Guanyu has blown a little hot and cold in his short F1 career so far, impressing at times, but also struggling to match his more experienced team-mate. That said, with the Alfa struggling for pace in 2023, Zhou is just a point behind Bottas and has finished in the points as many times. Time will tell if that is enough for the Chinese driver.\n\nWhat about AlphaTauri and Haas?\n\nTo start with, AlphaTauri F1 will no longer exist after the end of 2023. The AlphaTauri name is due to be replaced, with early speculation suggesting that the team will be called 'Hugo Boss Bulls Racing' in 2024. Yep. No comment.\n\nThis is all part of a realignment of AlphaTauri following the death of Red Bull’s founder Dietrich Mateschitz. The drinks company has elected to keep AlphaTauri rather than sell it, but is moving some of its functions to the UK to be closer to the main Red Bull team.\n\nYuki Tsunoda appears to have shown enough in 2023 to be expected to return in 2024, even though he doesn’t have a contract for the new season. Who will be alongside him is a trickier question. Daniel Ricciardo is currently in that seat, but will obviously have ambitions on the drive at the top, as will Tsunoda. The future of those Hugo Boss Bulls Racing seats in many ways depend on the future of Sergio Pérez.\n\nHaas F1 has confirmed both of its current drivers will return in 2024, which makes sense. Nico Hülkenberg has impressed strongly since he returned to F1. Showcasing the speed that led many to think he was a future world champion through the junior formula. Kevin Magnussen is a part of the furniture at Haas, even though he was given a year away in 2021. His return galvanised the team last year and his pole in Brazil will live long in the memory. That said, his form in 2023 has been iffy at best, with Hülkenberg clearly on top of the Haas tree, so Magnussen might need to up his game if he plans on remaining into 2025.\n\nWill Lando Norris stay at McLaren in 2024?\n\nYes. That’s the current answer. There really isn’t anywhere else for him to go at the moment. He’s a hot property in F1 but is sort of left in limbo until Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton decide they’ve had enough. That will be the main blocker on Lando moving to a team with championship aspirations.\n\nHis other problem at the moment is Oscar Piastri’s form. The Australian has impressed in his debut F1 season, even challenging for victory in the Sprint Race at Spa, and those performances did see some question Norris. The Brit’s recent podiums have helped to reassert him, but if Piastri keeps progressing, who knows where eyes will fall in the future.\n\nImages courtesy of Motorsport Images."
