It was also a weekend to forget for Mercedes, who suffered their first double DNF since the 2018 Austrian Grand Prix. This week, F1 will head to ‚ÄúThe Land of the Rising Sun‚Äù ‚Äî Japan!

This victory not only solidified his place in history but also surpassed his own record from the previous year, 2022, when he achieved 15 wins in a single season. Furthermore, during this season, Verstappen impressively won 10 consecutive races from May to September until Carlos Sainz of Ferrari broke his streak by winning the Singapore Grand Prix on September 17th. Following that, Verstappen has gone on to win all four subsequent races. As it stands, Verstappen boasts an outstanding season record of 16 wins out of 19 races. In the three races he didn't clinch first place, he secured a second-place finish in both the Saudi Arabian and Azerbaijan Grand Prix, and a fifth-place finish in the Singapore Grand Prix. This remarkable performance translates to an incredible 16 wins and 18 podium finishes out of 19 races this season. Verstappen's current podium percentage of 94.74% is second only to Michael Schumacher, who achieved a flawless 100% podium finish rate with 17 podiums in 17 races during the 2002 season. However, one could argue that Verstappen's season has been even more dominant, as he led an impressive 74.52% of the total laps this season, while Schumacher in 2002 only led 51.19% of the laps. With the Driver's Championship title already secured by Verstappen earlier this month during the Qatar Grand Prix, his future with Red Bull is guaranteed for the foreseeable years. In contrast, his teammate, Sergio \"Checo\" Perez, who currently holds second place in the Driver's Championship, has faced recent struggles. These challenges were exemplified in his disappointing result at his home race in Mexico City this past weekend, where he crashed during the first turn of the race, ultimately leading to his retirement (from the race). This outcome, along with his recent struggles, has raised questions about whether Checo will be offered a seat to continue alongside Verstappen in the upcoming Red Bull season in 2024.

And the world champion Lewis Hamilton, the man who, once upon a time said that I don‚Äôt inspire to be like other drivers. I inspire to be unique in my own way. And throughout his Formula 1 career, he‚Äôs definitely done that. And on the track today, he‚Äôs done things, his own way. He and the pit wall have deciding that he wants to stay out, as we have seen him done so often this season, determining his own strategy and just driving focusly. That‚Äôs it isn‚Äôt it, the dream rises. He‚Äôs made his key decisions from the cockpit, even as recently as a couple of laps ago. That‚Äôs what wins world championships. You know we‚Äôve seen many many drivers win races, you have to be good to even race in Formula 1. You have to be very good to win races. But unquestionably each one degrades. Absolutely, and he‚Äôs almost 30 seconds ahead of man in second place. Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc will share the podium with him. A podium that Lewis Hamilton will stand on the top step off. Once again, this unique year, in 2020 we are off the track. Lewis Hamilton has found his voice, and on it once again, he‚Äôs found his groove. And now he finds himself alongside Michael Schumacher as top in the record books. The world championship record is equaled. Lewis Hamilton wins the Turkish Grand Prix and is seven time the champion of the world.‚Äù The stuff that gives you goosebumps. #lewishamilton #f1 #mercedesamgf1\n\nThe 2023 Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix After 22 races this year, the last race of the Formula 1 World Championship was held in the UAE at the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2023. Just like it has been done since 2009, the race was held at the Yas Marina circuit. The track has a length of 5.281 km (3.281 miles), making it fairly long. Drivers cover a race distance of 306.183 km (190.253 miles), which is equivalent to racing for 58 laps on the circuit. Verstappen maintained his lead over Leclerc at the start of the race. On lap 17 Leclerc took the lead of the race when Verstappen pitted. And on lap 18, Tsunoda took the lead of the race when Leclerc pitted. When Tsunoda pitted on lap 23, Verstappen took the lead of the race. When Perez tried to overtake Norris for fourth place on lap 47, the two cars made contact. On lap 48, Perez successfully passed Norris but was given a five-second penalty on lap 51 for causing the collision. By lap 56, Perez, who had yet to serve his penalty, was in third place after overtaking Russell. The last pit stop of the season was on lap 57, when Sainz pitted. The last overtake of the season was when Leclerc slowed down to let Perez pass him for second place on track. He did this assuming that he would inherit second place because Perez hadn‚Äôt served his penalty. The intention of the overtake was to stop Russell, who was running in third place, from finishing within the podium places and, in doing so, help Ferrari finish ahead of Mercedes in the championship standings. Unfortunately for Leclerc, but fortunately for Mercedes, Russell finished within 3.8 seconds of Perez, which meant that Russell had successfully inherited third place in the race results despite finishing fourth on the grid. Mercedes went on to finish the season second in the championship, ahead of Ferrari by 3 points. At the end of the race, Verstappen broke the record and became the first driver to lead 1000 racing laps in a season. Verstappen finished in first place, ahead of Leclerc, and Russell.

Max Verstappen has secured his third consecutive world title in an epic sprint race at the Qatar Grand Prix. With a dominant performance throughout the season, Verstappen's victory was a mere formality, as he needed only three points to clinch the championship. Joining the ranks of racing legends like Ayrton Senna and Jackie Stewart, Verstappen has solidified his place in history as a three-time Formula One champion. His journey to this title was marked by intense battles with top drivers, including his controversial victory over Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and a fierce rivalry with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in 2022. With the powerful Red Bull team behind him, Verstappen's brilliance and speed were undeniable, making this third title a well-deserved accomplishment. However, he still has four more championships to go to match the records set by Hamilton and Michael Schumacher, who have each won seven titles. Verstappen's next goal is to level with Red Bull legend Sebastian Vettel and Frenchman Alain Prost, who both have four world championships. And let's not forget about the iconic Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio with his five titles. The title was officially handed to Verstappen when Sergio Perez crashed out during the race, leaving Verstappen only needing a top three finish to secure the championship. As the dust settles, Verstappen stands tall as a formidable force in Formula One.

Leclerc set the final day‚Äôs best lap of one minute and 30.322 seconds on the fastest C5 tyres with Mercedes‚Äô George Russell a mere 0.046 slower on the C4 tyres. Sauber‚Äôs Guanyu Zhou was third fastest, also on the C4s, with Red Bull‚Äôs triple champion Max Verstappen fourth and 0.433 off the pace. The Dutch driver, who won a record 19 races last year, was using the slower C3 tyres that will be used in next week‚Äôs season-opener at Sakhir, however. The final day of running with the new cars was halted by a dislodged drain cover at Turn 11 ‚Äî the second such incident in two days. The track action resumed after repairs with the usual lunch break dropped and the session running through to the evening under floodlights. Leclerc‚Äôs car suffered some floor damage in Thursday‚Äôs incident and Friday‚Äôs stoppage was triggered by Red Bull‚Äôs Sergio Perez. Ferrari‚Äôs Carlos Sainz had been fastest before the suspension, with the Spaniard also topping the timesheets on Thursday with the best time of testing as a whole ‚Äî a 1:29.921 effort on C4 tyres. Despite Ferrari showing good pace, and much improved tyre wear compared to last year, Red Bull continued to impress rivals with their new RB20 car. ‚ÄúI think Red Bull clearly are out in the distance,‚Äù said Mercedes‚Äô seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, with others agreeing. The record 24-race season starts in Bahrain next week, with practice on Thursday and the grand prix on Saturday as Formula One squeezes in the first two rounds in the Middle East before the start of Ramadan.
