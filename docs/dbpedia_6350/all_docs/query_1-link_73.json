        "text": "Racing, a Family Affair\n\nMike Hawthorn's life in northern England started out rather well in 1929. He was born into a well-off family, was particularly gifted at school and was eventually admitted into a reputable private university, mainly thanks to the means of his father Leslie, a former moto racer. The latter owned a high-end dealership, the famous Tourist Trophy Garage, located near the Brooklands circuit. This proximity to the world of racing and his father's passion infused Mike with the desire to hit the track, and at 21 he decided to do just that.\n\nHawthorn and his Riley made a name for themselves at the regional and national levels in 1950 and 1951. The following year, still financially supported by his father, he turned his attention to single-seaters and purchased a Formula 2 Cooper-Bristol. A star was born: he held his own against the top F1 drivers of the day at the British Grand Prix, and as a result, Enzo Ferrari signed him for the 1953 season.\n\nAt Monza in 1953, at right next to Enzo Ferrari wearing a hat, Hawthorn was a favourite of Il Commendatore.\n\nIn the Thick of It\n\nIn just a couple of years, Hawthorn had earned a seat at the table. He was tall, blonde, good-looking, charismatic and British, the perfect recipe for success. The year started out relatively well as he performed alongside two legendary world champions, Alberto Ascari and Nino Farina. Il Commendatore, Enzo Ferrari, chose Hawthorn to participate in the 24 Hours at the wheel of a magnificent 340 MM.\n\nUnfortunately, his experience at Le Mans quickly turned disastrous. In the second hour of the race during a pit stop, a mechanic informed Hawthorn the car's oil level was lower than expected and made the mistake of topping it off. No refill of that sort was permitted before the 28th lap and the car was disqualified.\n\nHawthorn kept his chin up. At the British Grand Prix one month later, he executed the most brilliant performance of his career. Struggling in fierce battles against Formula 1 icons, he stayed in the fight and faced none other than Juan Manuel Fangio in the final lap. In the end, he beat the Argentinian driver by less than a second. The crowd and press went wild for the two heroes, quickly calling the 1953 24 Hours the \"race of the century.\" Hawthorn seemed destined for greatness, but many challenges were in store. Still, with his aristocratic air, he embodied perfectly the fast and distinguished drivers of the 1950s. At that time, there were many accomplished Brits on the track, but there was only one Mike Hawthorn, known for his prowess behind the wheel, fast reactions and eccentric style.\n\nMike Hawthorn was recognised for his speed, but also for his attire: here in a green jacket, white shirt and bow tie signing autographs at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nThe Dark Years\n\nAfter returning to F1 for the 1954 season, Hawthorn suffered a serious accident at the Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily. Burns to a portion of his body exempted him from military service (an outcome that caused debate back in the U.K.). Two months later, he was absent from the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but not due to his injuries. His father Leslie had suddenly lost his life in a road accident. Devasted, Hawthorn was forced to return to England to take the helm of his father's company. Incredibly, none of these extreme setbacks kept him from the second half of the season. He followed his win at the Spanish Grand Prix with several podium finishes, ending the year third in the championship classification.\n\nYet, his relationship with the Scuderia Ferrari dimmed in early 1955. After taking over his father's dealership, he preferred to work with British teams: Jaguar for sports prototypes and Vanwall for F1. As Jaguar had proven itself quite capable at Le Mans in recent years, even winning in 1951 and 1953, Hawthorn had a good chance of victory against the formidable Mercedes driven by the likes of Fangio, Sir Stirling Moss and others.\n\nAlong with teammate Ivor Bueb in a Type D, they started off strong, up until 18:00. Another tragic accident occurred with Hawthorn in the car. He was unhurt, but was quickly deemed responsible (the official investigation exonerated him thereafter). The battle remained fierce until Mercedes withdrew from the race shortly before midnight. Jaguar stayed in, on the way to an easy one-two. Hawthorn was at the wheel across the finish line, establishing a new distance record and securing a bittersweet win.\n\nNot the happiest of victories. Here with Ivor Bueb, another talented Brit, at the finish. Sadly, Bueb died at Charade in 1959.\n\nPhone Call from an Old Friend\n\nA dark period had emerged, but Hawthorn retained his perpetual smile. He rejoined Ferrari for the end of the 1955 season, then represented BRM, Maserati and Vanwall. It was obvious he was no longer as fast, no longer as present. He did take the start in the 1956 24 Hours at the wheel of a fuel-injected Jaguar Type D, again with Ivor Bueb. The duo proved stronger than ever, Hawthorn having regained some of his moxy. He clocked the fastest free practice time and even filmed an on-board camera lap now considered iconic:\n\nRight from the outset of the race, several fan favourites were eliminated one by one. It was a true massacre among the competitors, and Hawthorn at the wheel was no exception with engine trouble preventing him from taking the lead. He headed to pit lane where Jaguar mechanics took a full hour to repair the prototype. With 21 laps lost, the top step on the podium was out of reach. Hawthorn continued to give his all, once again clocking the fastest in-race lap, and passing under the chequered flag in sixth place. The result earned him the third spot in the Sport 5.0 championship, better than nothing.\n\nPHOTO 1/2\n\nMike Hawthorn gave some of his best career performances at Le Mans. To watch him was to understand he was one of the best racing drivers in the world.\n\nAgain injured at the wheel of a Jaguar near the end of the season, it seemed as if nothing was going Hawthorn's way, until a certain Enzo Ferrari contacted him for 1957. Back in Maranello, he became fast friends with fellow countryman Peter Collins who had joined the team the previous year. Still donning his signature bow tie, he was more mature and calmer, but just as fast. He and the Ferrari armada arrived at Le Mans with the 335 S. Once again, Hawthorn dazzled the crowd. Lightning speed quickly propelled him to the top of the standings, but a long pitstop relegated the team to fifth position. His race ended when his teammate – and F1 rival – Luigi Musso broke the car's engine in the Mulsanne Straight at dusk on Saturday.\n\nHawthorn's Formula 1 season was disappointing for the most part as well. He and Collins were inseparable, going as far as to share Grand Prix bonuses. The pair had no love for Musso who represented another significant threat in the championship. In the end, Hawthorn finished fourth in the final classification and set his sights on 1958.\n\nThe Smile Finally Fades\n\nThe season got underway successfully thanks to Hawthorn's unwaivering reliability. That year, his main rival was none other than Moss, at the wheel of a Vanwall, and by mid-season though still a title contender, he was no longer a favourite. The Scuderia once again entered Hawthorn in the 24 Hours, alongside his great friend Collins. The race was a dream come true, a real battle of the titans: Moss and Aston Martin against Hawthorn and Ferrari, like in Formula 1. Moss dictated a staggering pace, and the cars were unable to keep up: a broken connecting rod ended Aston Martin's efforts, and a recalcitrant clutch slowed Hawthorn/Collins in the 250 Testa Rossa, forcing them to retire at 2:00.\n\n\" The public couldn't believe we were actually friends due to our behaviour on the track. \"\n\nSir Stirling Moss\n\nThe 1958 24 Hours was marred by rain for a solid 15 hours! That didn't stop fans from coming to watch a battle of the titans between Ferrari, Aston Martin, Porsche and Jaguar.\n\nNear the end of the F1 season at the circuit in Reims, he was headed toward an exceptional victory in a race marked by the death of the great Luigi Musso. When Hawthorn had the opportunity to gain a lap on Fangio suffering car problems, he decelerated, out of respect, to watch the Argentinian driver one last time before he retired from competition.\n\nFate soon dealt Hawthorn yet another crushing blow. At the German Grand Prix, Collins himself passed away, taking with him Hawthorn's desire to compete. In Portugal, with the mark of a true gentleman, Moss campaigned for the non-disqualification of his rival, thus leaving him in the race for the title. With only a one-point lead and thanks to Phil Hill rendering his spot in Morocco, Hawthorn was crowned the 1958 F1 world champion, the first Brit to achieve the feat.\n\n\" Mike was passionate. There aren't many truly passionate drivers. \"\n\nSir Stirling Moss\n\nShooting Star\n\nThe evening he was awarded the title, Hawthorn announced his retirement and went on to write children's books about racing. However, he had been suffering physically for some time and after a diagnosis of kidney disease, was given no more than three years to live. On 22 January 1959, just three months after his staggering announcement, Hawthorn died in a car accident in southwest London. Though the exact circumstances remain unknown, he was most likely racing F1 team owner Rob Walker at the time.\n\nMike Hawthorn was not among us very long – barely 29 years – but he left an indelible imprint on our world. He experienced glory and witnessed death from every angle. His legend will live on forever."
