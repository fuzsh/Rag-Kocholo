The number of circuits in the Netherlands: Zandvoort and Assen. Zandvoort is used predominantly for car racing and for many years was the venue for the F3 Masters, one of the most important races in the category, on a par with the Monaco Grand Prix and second only in terms of prestige to the Macau Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Assen is an iconic motorcycle racing venue, which has hosted the Dutch TT, a round of the Motorcycle World Championship, since 1949.\n\n10. The lowest place on the grid from which the Dutch GP has been won. Two drivers have done this. The first was Rene Arnoux, who won the 1983 edition in the number 28 Ferrari 126 C3. It was the Frenchman’s seventh and final Formula 1 win, his third with the Scuderia. Two years later, Niki Lauda went from tenth to first in a McLaren. For the Austrian too, it was to be the last victory of his amazing career, his 25th win. The longest climb up the order to finish on the podium falls to Jean-Pierre Beltoise, who finished second in a Matra in 1968, behind team-mate Jackie Stewart, having started 16th.\n\n18 & 19. The gradient of the banking at turns 3 and 14 at Zandvoort. By a long way, these two parabolic turns are the steepest on the F1 calendar. As a comparison, the famous Monza Parabolica, which is to be named in honour of Michele Alboreto as from the Italian Grand Prix weekend, is banked to just four degrees.\n\n26. The percentage of the Netherlands’ surface area that is below sea level. A network of dunes and dams along the coast and the banks of major rivers ensures these areas do not flood, with several pumping stations on hand to deal with excessive rain.\n\n1500. The number of bridges in Amsterdam, the Dutch capital. The city is laid out over a network of more than 90 small islands linked by a canal system that is over a hundred kilometres in length."
