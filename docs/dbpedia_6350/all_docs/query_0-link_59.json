        "text": "August 23, 1953 is Italian Alberto Ascari won 13th and his last career win Formula 1. A star Ferrari he was very mysterious during his lifetime and was unreachable at many races.\n\nDue to limited interest from car manufacturers, it was a world championship Formula 1 in years 1952 in 1953 also advertised for racing cars Formula 2. This was of course an ideal opportunity for Ferrariwhich team from Maranella she did not let go. Alberto Ascari (his trademark: blue shirt, blue helmet, small belly, heavy superstition) sitting in a race car Ferrari, began a unique series of victories. He won GP of Belgium at Spa on May 22, 1952, and has not ceased to win since.\n\nOf course, they will be good connoisseurs of history Formula 1, who are still struggling with statistics, knew how to say that it was time for the championship Formula 1 it also included a race Indy 500. But so few Americans as well as Europeans traveled to Europe Indianapolis, so we can ignore this without a guilty conscience. Ascari he won and won, to June 21, 1953, again at the race in Belgium. He has only achieved his nine wins in a row Sebastian Vettel in 2013, when he was with his Red Bullom amassed victories from the race in Belgium but all the way to Brazil.\n\nA fate for Ascaria did not provide for a leisurely rest. May 22, 1955 is in the race for GP Monaco fell with his car Lancia D50 into the port pool. Luckily he was able to save himself, but what went wrong? Ascari he said at the time that he was in control of his own Ferrari lost in braking, the race car showered the sidewalk and drove straight into the sea as a result. The braking distances later showed that the champion was desperately trying to brake. His Ferrari he broke through the then protective fence of wooden planks and fell into the sea.\n\nIt's four days later Ascari died. The exact circumstances were never clarified. Quite unusual, for a superstitious Ascaria, was the case when he tested himself in a sports car Eugenia Castellotti v Monza borrowed his helmet and asked for his race car. His reasonable statement was: “If you fall off a horse, then it is best to get back into the saddle immediately.“To this day, the legend holds that he wanted to Ascari in a bend Slut Vialone to avoid a man who crossed the path illegally. In Italy, it is still said today that it was this man who confessed to a priest on his deathbed that he was the reason for this. tragic accident. Of course, this is what is heard and said. Like the second version, that the perpetrator of this accident allegedly landed in a madhouse due to constant feelings of guilt.\n\nDeath Alberta however, it offers moving and striking parallels to the fatal accident of his father Antonia: They both died 26th in a month and they were both old 36 let. They both died four days after a severe accident and both had won before 13 Grand Prix wins. They both left their wives with two children and both died at the exit of the left fast turn. One could hardly believe these coincidences, but these are the facts that make your skin itch. But the oddities are not over. Paul Hawkins, which is years 1965, such as Alberto Ascari, fell into the sea in Monaco, also died on the 26th of the month (May) in 1969 in Oulton Park.\n\nWhen he was Ascari in a rush, not even a large one could hold him back Juan Manuel Fangio. Enzo Ferrari he once said: “If Alberto was in the lead, then it was almost impossible to catch up with him.“But the Italian had problems in his time because he strongly doubted himself, which led to absurd superstition. His longtime friend Gigi Villoresi he knew: “When we were on our way and the trail was crossed by a black cat, he immediately turned back and did not drive on that trail for the rest of his life. I have experienced this with him quite a few times. I would change my mind only if another black cat came from the left. But let’s be honest: what is the chance of that happening? That's why we drove on side roads.\"\n\nAscari, who was behind the wheel without a hint of fear, was like a pedestrian a living opposite. Before crossing the road, he did not first look closely to the left, then to the right, again to the left, and again to the right. When he was firmly convinced that he could cross the track, he did so. It almost doesn’t go more carefully. Alberto he also had a large fetish on numbers. He never competed in races on days with a number associated with the day of his father’s death. That’s why it was all the more amazing that he wanted in Monza take over the car Castellotti.\n\nAlberto Ascari he always said: “I purposely be strict with my children so they don’t love me too much. Then even the pain won’t be so great if I leave them one day.“What to say to those words? Alberta Ascari they were laid in a grave next to their father in the cemetery Cimitero Monumentale in Milan.\n\nConnoisseurs Formula 1 and the racetracks in Royal Monze Park know that after the legendary Albert Ascari appoints chicanery in front of the plane to the famous bend Parabolic.\n\nAlberta Ascari's Formula 1 career:\n\n32 Grand Prix races\n\n14 conquered pole fields\n\n12 fastest laps of the race\n\n13 wins\n\n2 world titles (1952 and 1953)"
