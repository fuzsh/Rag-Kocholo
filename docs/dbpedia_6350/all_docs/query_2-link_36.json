        "text": "1.SWITZERLAND: Sjoert Brink, Bas Drijver, Piotr Gawryś, Michał Klukowski, Fernando Piedra, Pierre Zimmermann, Krzysztof Martens (coach).\n\n2.NETHERLANDS: Simon de Wijs, Bauke Muller, Berend van den Bos, Joris van Lankveld, Ricco van Prooijen, Louk Verhees Jr, Gert-Jan Ros (npc), Ton Bakkeren (coach).\n\n3.NORWAY: Terje Aa, Christian Bakke, Boye Brogeland, Geir Helgemo, Tor Helness, Allan Livgård, Tolle Stabell (npc), Sten Bjertnes (coach).\n\n3. USA1: Eric Greco, Geoff Hampson, Ralph Katz, Bobby Levin, Nick Nickell, Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin (npc), Eric O. Kokish (coach).\n\nTo find all the details of the Championship include results, bulletins, photographs etc. please click here.\n\nThe final was one of the most thrilling on record, with the lead repeatedly changing hands. The outcome was in doubt until the end, only being decided when the Netherlands stopped short of a makeable game on the last board leaving Switzerland ahead 167-164.\n\nOf the 24 semi-finalist players this year, 13 had already won a Bermuda Bowl in the past, and 2 had won two, and Nick Nickell four. The final determined whether Piotr Gawryś or Bauke Muller would join the select club of 25 winners of three or more Bermuda Bowls.\n\nGeir Helgemo is the recordholder among current players, with a total of 18 World Championship medals. Tor Helness only has 17 – he scored his first one in 1980, but Helgemo caught up with two Junior ones. Piotr Gawryś has 14 medals. Michał Klukowski already has 10, and that includes only three junior events. Pierre Zimmermann is also already up to a medal tally of ten. Bas Drijver now has 9 medals, 3 of them gold. All but one (the 2003 junior pairs) came with Sjoert Brink who consequently has 8 medals, 3 of them gold.\n\nNick Nickell won his eighth medal, all but one (silver in the Rosenblum) in the Bermuda Bowl. After his 4 golds and 2 silvers, he now has a complete set of Bermuda Bowl medals.\n\nBoye Brogeland also has 8 world medals, three of them in junior play. Bauke Muller has eight medals, Simon de Wijs seven. Terje Aa has won his sixth medal, 5 in Bermuda Bowls, one in the World Games. He claims he has never finished lower than fourth, but then again, he has never been on a winning side. Eric Greco also has six medals, two of them in Junior teams. So has Geoff Hampson, but his Junior team medal came as a representative of Canada. Ralph Katz and Bobby Levin also have six medals. Ricco van Prooijen has won a gold and four silver medals. Louk Verhees also has 5, but there is a bronze next to his 1 gold and 3 silvers. Christian Bakke also has five medals, all previous ones from Junior events. Allan Livgård is up to his fourth bronze medal, two of them from Youth events. Berend van den Bos scored his first Medal at the senior level. He won three world titles in the Juniors, all together with Joris van Lankveld, who has an extra silver from the Junior teams in 2014. Strangely enough, this is Steve Weinstein’s first team medal, but he does have a gold and a silver from the World Open pairs.\n\nThese are not the first medals for Switzerland. Pierre Zimmermann himself scored his first two on Transnational teams while representing his native country, and Jean Besse played on the European Bermuda Bowl team of 1954.\n\n1.POLAND: Krzysztof Buras, Bartosz Chmurski, Jacek Kalita, Grzegorz Narkiewicz, Michal Nowosadzki, Piotr Tuczynski, Marek Pietrasek (npc), Marek Wojcicki (coach).\n\n2.NETHERLANDS: Simon De Wijs, Bob Drijver, Bauke Muller, Bart Nab, Ricco van Prooijen, Louk Verhees Jr., Anton Maas (npc), Ton Bakkeren (coach).\n\n3.NORWAY: Terje Aa, Boye Brogeland, Nils Kare Kvangraven, Espen Lindqvist, Allan Livgard, Ulf Haakon Tundal, Christian Venneroed (npc), Sten Bjertnes (coach).\n\nThe Championship was a great success thanks to the excellent job done by the Chinese Contract Bridge Association and the Local Organising Committee. Wuhan welcomed and hosted the event in an excellent way: the playing conditions have been splendid and the participants have taken advantage of the services which were provided. This edition of the championship was more important than in the past, because the number of the qualified teams were increased from 22 to 24 for each category and because for the first time in addition to the Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup and d’Orsi Trophy, the Wuhan Cup for the Mixed Teams was included: 96 teams, 24 per each category, representing 42 affiliated Federations competed for the titles of World Champions and for the Medals. Another reason to enjoy the championship was that, as President Thomas Bach remarked in his welcome message, in Wuhan the 20th anniversary of the recognition by the IOC of the WBF as International Federation was celebrated. Je Zhao (China), Grzegorg Narkiewicz & Krzysztof Buras (Poland) and Ulf Tundal (Norway) became World Grand Master. Poland and Netherlands played a terrific match, finally decided by a tough slam deal (board 27 reported inside) just six boards from the end. Norway defeated USA for the bronze medal.\n\nTo check all the information of this championship, please click here.\n\n1. POLAND: Piotr Gawrys, Krzysztof Jassem, Jacek Kalita, Michal Klukowski, Marcin Mazurkiewicz, Michal Nowosadzki, Piotr Walczak (NPC), Stanislaw Golebiowski (Coach).\n\n2. SWEDEN: Tommy Bergdahl, Fredrik Nyström, Johan Sylvan, Johan Upmark, Niklas Warne, Frederic Wrang, Jan Lagerman (NPC).\n\n3. USA: Vincent Demuy, Paul Fireman, John Hurd, John Kranyak, Gavin Wolpert, Joel Wooldridge, Shane Blanchard (NPC).\n\nChennai hosted one of the best World Championship in the history of the event, thanks to the impressive job done by the Bridge Federation of India in its preparation and organisation and thanks to the magnificent venue, the ITC Grand Chola. The championship will also be remembered for the withdrawal of three teams (Israel, Monaco and Germany) and the revocation of the invitation to one Polish pair (Balicki-Zmudzinski). These were brought about by a major cheating scandal that shocked the bridge world in the weeks immediately before the start of the event. However, despite the many issues at stake, the bridge was still excellent and in an exciting final Sweden charged into the lead with a huge seventh set, outscoring Poland 70-6 to take a 16.5 IMP lead. In the final set, the momentum swung the other way and Poland earned another title with a 307.5-293 victory. The Polish rising star Michal Klukowski (19 years old) won his second main World Title, after the Rosenblum Cup in Sanya, and is the youngest player ever in the history of bridge to achieve this and become a World Grand Master. The Polish victory also meant that Jacek Kalita and Marcin Mazurkiewicz became Grand Masters, as did Johan Upmark from Sweden.\n\nTo check all the information of this championship, please click here.\n\n1. ICELAND: Jon Baldursson, A alsteinn Jörgensen, Orn Arnthorsson, Gudlaugur Johansson, orlákur Jonsson, Gudmundur Arnson, Bjorn Eysteinsson (NPC).\n\n2. POLAND: Cesary Balicki, Piotr Gawrys, Krysztof Lasocki, Krysztof Martens, Marek Szymanowski, Adam Zmudzinski, Andrej Orlow (NPC).\n\n3. SWEDEN: Sven-Åke Bjerregard, Björn Fallenius, Tommy Gullberg, Anders Morath, Mats Nilsland, Per-Olov\n\nSundelin, Svante Ryman (NPC).\n\nOver the years, there have been many changes in the format of the Bermuda Bowl. The latest philosophy held is that each of the WBF Zones should participate as of right, and that plural representation should be accorded to Zones 1 and 2, which have many more players. However, the seeding of a team from each of these Zones was not universally popular, so the WBF Executive Council approved a new format for use in the NEC Bermuda Bowl staged in Yokohama in 1991. Under the new format (which applied equally to the Venice Cup) Zone 1 was allowed to enter four teams, Zone 2 three teams, Zones 3-6 two teams and Zone 7 (which has only three NBOs) one team. The 16 teams were split into two groups of eight with the top four teams from each group qualifying for the quarter-finals after a double round robin. In one of the most surprising tournaments ever, for the first time the final was played by two teams which had never before achieved the finals. Iceland squeezed through their semi-final against Sweden and then beat Poland fairly comfortably 415-376 in the final. Sweden beat Brazil in the bronze medal play-off."
