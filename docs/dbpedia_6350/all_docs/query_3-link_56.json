So you will find that the results are accompanied by notes on the cars, giving as full a record of their later lives as we can.\n\nTNF has been one of the most important homes of collaborative research on this period and I hope some of you will be able to amend and expand what we've done so far.\n\nAllen\n\nOriginally posted by GIGLEUX\n\nGP de Paris: Delage. They were not of D6-70 type. The D6-70 was the stock car. D=Delage 6= 6 cylinders 70= 70 hp. The racing cars, two prewar and five after war were issued from the stock cars but with something between 130 and 140 hp!. They are usually known as Delage 3000 but the constructor plate indicate: D6-3LS as being the type of the cars.\n\nDavid McKinney had also told me to correct the model number but I am still confused by these cars. Were they running as F1s despite only being 3 litres?\n\nOriginally posted by Allen Brown\n\nIs that certain? I have just been working through Michael's information and he told me that Ascari had a 1.5-litre Colombo engine and Villoresi had a tipo 275 Lampredi engine.\n\nDavid McKinney had also told me to correct the model number but I am still confused by these cars. Were they running as F1s despite only being 3 litres?\n\nThanks\n\nAllen\n\nOriginally posted by David McKinney\n\nYes it was, but it's an English-language site, and you'll notice all the races are given the titles by which they are familiarly known in English. There's no Grote Prijs van Nederland or anything else with a non-English title.\n\nOK, there are exceptions on the list. Grand Prix des Nations doesn't really translate - English-language reports at the time generally left it in French. I don't know why there isn't a Pau Grand Prix though\n\nAnd I'd personally be happier to see Rheims given its correct period English spelling\n\nOriginally posted by GIGLEUX\n\nBrickyard: just let me correct you about little things. Reims-Gueux (and not les Gueux is the name of the circuit). Usually the ACF GPs were raced at Reims, but when it was not the case the races on circuit were named Grand de la Marne (Marne is the name of the district around Reims). Exception, 1949 were the race was called officially GP de France.\n\nIn 1952 there was a serie of Grands Prix named Grands Prix de France: Pau, Marseille, Paris, Reims (Marne GP), Rouen (ACF GP), Les Sables d'Olonne, Saint Gaudens (Comminges GP), La Baule.\n\nAllen: it is evident I'll help you with the french names.\n\nOriginally posted by Allen Brown\n\nHaving been delving in the database, the situation regarding race titles on ORC is very mixed at the moment, depending largely on who has been compiling the race data. Here is a full list of the F1 and F2 (and equivalent libre races) currently on the site, excluding races in the UK.\n\nI'd be very happy to change any that are inappropriately anglicised.\n\nNetherlands\n\nDutch Grand Prix"
