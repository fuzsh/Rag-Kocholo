Sign up here to receive the Prime Tire newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday morning.\n\nChaotic, slippery and surprising.\n\nThese are just a few words that can be used to describe the Dutch Grand Prix qualifying sessions that featured a stop-and-go Q3 with two red flags as a narrow dry line emerged. Max Verstappen may have secured pole for his home race once again, but the grid was full of surprises behind him, like Lando Norris lining up next to him on the front row Sunday and both Williams making it into the top 10.\n\nBoth Charles Leclerc and Logan Sargeant suffered fairly hard hits in the barrier, which left them qualifying ninth and 10th, respectively. That result marked the first time an American driver has qualified in the top 10 since the 1990s. Williams may be the biggest team surprise from Saturday, but as far as drivers go, the shocker is that Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez qualified seventh, just 0.058 seconds ahead of rookie Oscar Piastri and 1.313 seconds off of Verstappen. Even Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff called the gap between the Red Bull teammates “odd” and “bizarre.”\n\nWith a partially mixed grid and a new face in the lineup, here are the six questions we’re asking ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix, which starts at 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BST Sunday.\n\nCan Verstappen make history on home soil?\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say the Dutch Grand Prix would not exist without Max Verstappen. He’s become the Netherlands’ biggest sporting superstar since soccer player Johann Cruyff in the 1970s, and is well on his way to a third world championship at record-breaking speed.\n\nThe narrative surrounding the race at Zandvoort has always been led by Verstappen. The majority of the 90,000 fans turning up each day come decked in orange. Many of them took the ‘Max Express’ train to the track from Amsterdam. All are eager to see him repeat his victories from pole in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nBut a win on Sunday would hold extra significance. It would be Verstappen’s ninth consecutive F1 win, matching the record currently held by Sebastian Vettel, who achieved the feat in 2013. Alberto Ascari also won nine in a row across 1952 and 1953, albeit interrupted by the Indianapolis 500 that he did not enter.\n\nVerstappen has never had much time for harping on records, simply focusing on doing the best job possible and soaking up the glory. Still, it’d be a huge landmark for him to reach, one that would only further speak to this being a domination unlike anything we have seen before in F1. Given how commanding the Red Bull car has been on Sundays this year, it would take something out of the norm for it not to happen and spark a big, big party tomorrow night among the home fans.\n\nWill McLaren win the ‘best of the rest’ fight?\n\nAfter coming back to Earth a tad in Belgium before the summer break, McLaren hit the ground running with Lando Norris on the front row once again and Oscar Piastri a bit further back, inP8.\n\nWith both drivers into Q3, McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown told F1.tv, “I don’t think we had much left. I think Lando felt his lap wasn’t great, but I don’t think it was six tenths (of a second) left on the table, maybe a couple tenths.” The rookie’s last lap “didn’t quite get together,” but Piastri has “been sensational.” After all, he bounced back from a Friday wreck to qualify in the top 10.\n\nIt looked like for a brief moment that Norris could snag pole position instead of Verstappen — then the Dutchman nailed his final flying lap, launching himself 0.537 seconds ahead of the McLaren. Norris estimated that he made about “three-tenths worth” of mistakes in Q3, which would have put him two-tenths off of Verstappen.\n\n“Every now and then, you hope Max makes a mistake, and he doesn’t,” Norris said during his on-track interview. “So, frustrating in a little way.”\n\nNo one can really compete against Red Bull at the moment, but a podium finish is up for grabs. Norris noted he’s “still more worried about the people behind than the car in front,” a nod towards Ferrari, Mercedes and Aston Martin. “I think we’re still pleasantly surprised by how competitive we’ve been,” Norris said. “A mixture of us taking a step forward and, you know, Aston taking, I would say, a step backward from where they were in the beginning of the season. Ferrari just not looking like they were as good as they were last year, or they were in the beginning of the season.”\n\nZandvoort does suit the MCL60, and Norris expects to challenge Verstappen for “probably two laps, then he’ll drive away. I think there’s quite a bit of tire degradation here and not our forte, let’s say. When it comes into play, we start to struggle quite a bit in certain corners. But we’ve improved the car quite a bit, I think, since Friday, so I want to be a little bit more hopeful.”\n\nSunday’s grand prix could be a critical point haul for the Woking-based team, which is 88 points behind Ferrari in the constructor standings. As Aston Martin continues to perform in a similar range and the Prancing Horse has a tricky weekend, McLaren has the chance to edge closer to being ‘best of the rest.’\n\nWhat can Albon fight for from the second row?\n\nAnswer this honestly: Who had Albon qualifying fourth at Zandvoort on their bingo card for the Dutch GP race weekend?\n\nWilliams’ FW45’s significant strength is its straight-line speed, and this track is known for its twisty, narrow layout. Even so, seeing Albon in the top 10 is not a shock. He has put Williams into point contention throughout the season, bringing home all of the team’s 11 points thanks to a P10 finish in Bahrain, P7 in Canada and P8 at Silverstone. However, qualifying fourth place for Sunday’s grand prix matches his best qualifying finish in his F1 career.\n\nAlbon’s pace was eye-catchingly competitive from the get-go, finishing in the top five in both of Friday’s practice sessions. He said Saturday, “The car felt good the first lap we drove in FP1, and normally when that happens, the others start to really chip away at it, get their car in their window. I just felt like, ‘Oh maybe we’ve hit our sweet spot early.’ We didn’t really play too much with the car since FP1, and it made me feel confident.\n\n“Then when you add confidence with a track like this, which is so narrow, so uncompromising, and at the same time, mixed conditions, wet, dry, that kind of thing, you really just need to feel at one with the car, and I have done this weekend.”\n\nThe mixed weather and headwind went in their favor. Albon said, “I think when you have these kind of conditions, it’s not always about peak downforce, it’s about having a car that’s drivable and on the limit. And our car has been all weekend.”\n\nThat being said, Albon is starting fourth with Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz and Sergio Pérez directly behind him, and Charles Leclerc not too far off. Albon said Williams hasn’t been at the “top of the speed traps” this weekend, but “actually been very, very midfield.” A podium may not be in store for Williams, but at least one points-finish is in reach, even with Sargeant starting tenth.\n\n“All the top-tier teams are around us,” Albon said. “There’s no driver that can hold them up, they’re all directly behind me, so it’s going to be a tough race.”\n\nBut the team’s pace begs the question: Is a double-points haul possible? It’ll take a clean race from Sargeant. Plus between wet or dry conditions, the rookie said he’d prefer the latter.\n\n“We had really good long run pace in the dry, and what Alex has done today, I think if it is dry, I think we’ll have a great chance to score points. We just need to hopefully rebuild, get as close as we can to where we were, personally just reset, clear my head, and go again.”\n\nAfter a mixed qualifying, will Mercedes get in the fight?\n\nMercedes had a very mixed qualifying session on Saturday. Twelve months after running Verstappen close for victory at Zandvoort, the team managed to get at the sharp end once again as George Russell qualified third. This was despite not having his tires in the right window at the start of his final lap, costing him three-tenths of a second and a possible spot on the front row.\n\nIt was a very different story for Lewis Hamilton in the sister Mercedes. Hamilton qualified 13th after being impeded late in the session by Yuki Tsunoda, who received a three-place grid drop. After the session, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said that “some need to open their eyes” and that it cost Hamilton a Q3 berth, making it “painful” to see.\n\nHamilton was a man of few words after qualifying. “We were just slow out there,” he said, claiming Tsunoda’s impeding “didn’t make any difference.” Asked if he felt confident about the race, he gave an honest “no” in response. “The car has just been difficult,” he said. “I’ll try and turn the negative from today into a positive tomorrow.”\n\nThe Mercedes car has typically fared better on Sundays than Saturdays this year, which should give Hamilton hope of getting back into the points and Russell a chance to be in contention for the podium. The pace in Hungary, where Hamilton finished fourth and Russell charged up the order, should offer some encouragement the team can fight to be second-best behind Red Bull on Sunday.\n\nCan Ferrari salvage a result from a tricky weekend?\n\nIt’s been a rough weekend so far for Ferrari. While Mercedes and McLaren look set to battle for best-of-the-rest honors, Ferrari has not once looked to be in that fight. Charles Leclerc was fortunate to make it through to Q1, complaining to his team about the run plan leaving him in traffic, and then crashed in Q3.\n\nThe fact both he and teammate Carlos Sainz made it into the top 10 was something of a surprise, given how difficult the SF-23 car has been to tame this weekend. Leclerc said the car has been “extremely difficult to drive,” particularly at Turns 1, 9 and 10, and the inconsistency that has blighted the team this year has continued. “Every time you get into the car not knowing what you are going to get,” Leclerc said. “(It) is not a situation I like.”\n\nFerrari struggled in Hungary and has tried to remedy that by running a slightly lower downforce setup at Zandvoort, a track with similar characteristics — only to struggle still and to see the car slide. We kept seeing Leclerc, in particular, having to save small slides going through the banking.\n\nA decent haul of points will naturally be the target for Ferrari in the race, especially with Sainz up in sixth. But there’s not a lot to suggest it will have the long-run pace to properly fight against the McLaren or Mercedes cars, making the Dutch GP a case of damage limitation for the Scuderia.\n\nWhat can fans expect from Liam Lawson in his F1 race debut?\n\nA new face will be on Sunday’s grid after Daniel Ricciardo broke a metacarpal bone in his left hand on Friday, leaving AlphaTauri searching for someone to fill the Australian’s seat this weekend. Red Bull junior driver Liam Lawson replaced Ricciardo and will start his F1 race debut from the back of the grid.\n\nThe New Zealander qualified P20 after a tricky Saturday with wet-dry conditions. He said in the team’s recap, “During qualifying, I was feeling comfortable, and like I was gaining a lot, but then it rained again, and I expected the grip to drop, but I was surprised by how high it stayed, so for sure, I didn’t maximize everything. I feel comfortable in the car, but with these conditions, it’s tricky to learn this track in the car.”\n\nIt’s baptism by fire for Lawson this weekend as he navigates a challenging Zandvoort track that leaves little room for error. It’s bumpier in some areas and narrower in others, and then there’s the matter of banking, where drivers can take different lines in Turn 3, for example. If it stays completely dry on Sunday, it’ll be learning from scratch for the 21-year-old, who hasn’t driven in fully dry conditions or completed longer runs on dry tire compounds in this car yet.\n\nNyck de Vries may have scored points in his F1 debut with Williams in 2022, but that shouldn’t be expected of Lawson in the AT04. It’s good testing for him and to show the Red Bull family what he can do.\n\n“He did a good job, making no mistakes and bringing the car home,” Guillaume Dezoteux, AlphaTauri’s head of vehicle performance, said in the team’s recap. “There is definitely still a lot to come from him.”\n\n(Lead image of Max Verstappen: ANP via Getty Images)"
