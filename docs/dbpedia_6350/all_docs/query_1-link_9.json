        "text": "Scuderia Ferrari are the longest serving team in Formula One, having raced in every single championship since the beginning in 1950.\n\nFerrari and Formula One have a long standing relationship and are synonymous with one another. Scuderia Ferrari is without a doubt one of the most well known and recognised brands in the world. The world famous team has had outstanding talent associated with its team throughout the years with greats like Michael Schumacher and Niki Lauda. Although the team hasn’t had a world title in recent years, it is still one of the most decorated teams in Formula One history with 16 Constructors Championships to its name. A Formula One race wouldn’t be right without the bright red Scuderia Ferrari racing on its tracks.\n\nAbout Scuderia Ferrari\n\nThe Scuderia Ferrari team was founded by Enzo Ferrari. In 1947, Ferrari began building their own cars and supplying their own engines. Ferrari has supplied engines to many F1 teams throughout the years. As of 2022, Haas F1 Team and Alfa Romeo Racing use the Ferrari engines.\n\nThe Italian Grand Prix in Monza is regarded as Scuderia Ferrari’s home race. Every year Monza is turned into a sea of red Ferrari fans awaiting their team’s victory. Scuderia Ferrari’s drivers have brought home an impressive 15 Drivers’ Championship. Tifosi is the name given the Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 supporters. Ferrari are the longest serving and most successful Formula One team taking part in over 1000 Grand Prix and holding many world records in F1.\n\nIn the past few years, Scuderia Ferrari has struggled to keep up with the big names of F1 such as Mercedes, Red Bull Racing and McLaren. However, 2022 has seen big improvements, with the team having their most successful year in two years.\n\nFerrari 2022 F1 Car\n\nFerrari F1-75 is Ferrari’s Formula One car for the 2022 season and it has performed very well in the season so far. Ferrari’s drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz have been a very strong pairing winning Grand Prix and making podiums throughout the season. Ferrari’s newly designed car in accordance with changed regulations is named F1-75 to reflect the teams 75 years in the F1. Team principal, Mattia Binotto described the F1-75 as “aggressive” and “brave”. Some changes made to the car were the removal of pylons, the front and rear wheels and tyres were increased to 18″ and the addition of an innovative combustion engine.\n\nFerrari F1 Drivers’ Champions\n\nWith over 70 years in Formula 1, the team known as “The Prancing Horse” has had many drivers come through its ranks. Drivers Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen had huge success with Ferrari, all winning at least one World Drivers’ Championship Title.\n\nNiki Lauda\n\nNiki Lauda won two Drivers’ Championships with Ferrari in 1975 and 1977. During his time with Scuderia Ferrari, Lauda suffered a terrible crash at Nürburgring in 1976 which nearly left him for dead. Lauda suffered desperate burns after his car burst into flames and the driver fell into a coma shortly after. Incredibly, Lauda returned to the 1976 F1 Championship six weeks later, only missing two races. Although, Lauda lost the Championship title to James Hunt by one point, he went on to win the Drivers and Constructors Championship the following year for his final season with Ferrari.\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio was an Argentine Formula One driver who won the World Drivers’ Championship five times in his career, dominating the first 10 years of Formula One. He is the only driver to win the World Championship with four different Formula One teams, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Maserati and Scuderia Ferrari. Fangio was also the oldest driver in the majority of the Grand Prix’s he raced in, not starting his career until he was in his late 30s. Fangio only raced in seven Grand Prix races for Ferrari, winning five of them during his one season with the Italian team.\n\nAlberto Ascari\n\nAlberto Ascari was Ferrari’s first Formula 1 World Champion. Alberto Ascari was an Italian racing driver that not only competed in Formula One but also had a career in motorcycle racing before. Ascari won two consecutive World Championship titles in 1952 and 1953 for Scuderia Ferrari. Alberto Ascari is the first and last Italian to date to achieve such success in Ferrari and Formula 1. Ascari was Ferrari’s only back-to-back World Champion until Schumacher broke this record with his F1 Ferrari success from 2000-2003.\n\nMike Hawthorn\n\nMike Hawthorn was a British racing driver that joined Scuderia Ferrari in 1953. In his first season with the Italian Formula one team, Hawthorn placed first at the French Grand Prix and finished in fourth place in the Championship at the end of the season. In 1958, Hawthorn finally found victory winning his first World Championship in his career. Incredibly, Hawthorn only won one race in 1958 but because of his second place points and one victory he managed to gain enough to take home the title for Ferrari. He was the first British driver to win a World Championship in Formula 1 and for Ferrari.\n\nJohn Surtees\n\nJohn Surtees was both a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and F1 driver. After having a very successful career in motorcycling, winning seven Grand Prix World Championships in two classes, 500cc and 350cc, Surtees decided to make the move to Formula 1. In 1963, Sutrees joined Scuderia Ferrari and made quite the name for himself winning the German Grand Prix in his debut season.\n\nHis second season with Ferrari resulted in even more victory with John Surtees winning the Formula 1 World Championship in 1964. This monumentos win made John Surtees the first and only person to have won both two and four wheel World Championships. He was also the second and as of today the last British Ferrari driver to win the World Champion.\n\nKimi Räikkönen\n\nKimi Räikkönen, nicknamed “The Iceman” because of his cool and reserved demeanour, is a F1 driver from Finland. In his debut season with Ferrari, Räikkönen won the F1 World Championship title. To date, this is the last World Championship for Scuderia Ferrari. In the space of 11 years, Räikkönen raced with Scuderia Ferrari for 8 years. Räikkönen signed with Ferrari in 2007 for three seasons and signed again in 2014, with his Ferrari F1 career lasting another five seasons.\n\nPhil Hill\n\nPhil Hill was an American Formula One driver who joined Scuderia Ferrari in 1959. In his first season with Ferrari, Phil Hill placed fourth in the Drivers’ Championship. Hill was the first and only American born driver to win the F1 World Drivers’ Championship. Unfortunately, Hill’s victory was surrounded by sadness. During the Grand Prix, Ferrari home race at Monza, teammates Phil Hill and Count Wolfgang von Trips battled it out to win the World Champion title. In a terrible accident, von Trips car crashed into the crowd, fatally killing himself and spectators, leading Hill to win the Championship by one point.\n\nJody Scheckter\n\nJody Scheckter raced for Scuderia Ferrari from 1979-1980. Jody Scheckter’s debut season for Ferrari was very successful with many podiums and win leading him to win the Drivers’ Championship. This victory made him the first and to date only South African driver to win the Formula One World Championship. Scheckter’s second season wasn’t as smooth sailing and the Scuderia Ferrari driver failed to defend his title and was probably a deciding factor in the South African drivers’ retirement form the motorsport.\n\nMichael Schumacher\n\nLast on the list but by no means least is Michael Schumacher. Without a doubt, the most successful and famous driver to have raced for Scuderia Ferrari is Michael Schumacher. The German driver brought Ferraris its most victorious period of racing in the early 2000’s. He won more races during his time with Ferrari than any other driver with a total of 72 wins. He has also had the most pole positions with 58, most Formula One podiums with 116 and the most fastest laps during his time with Ferrari with a total of 53. He won seven Drivers’ Championships during his Formula One career, with five consecutive wins with Ferrari.\n\nSchumacher won his first Drivers’ Championship in 1994 with Benetton after a season which involved a two-race ban and collisions with competitor Damon Hill Schumacher, driver for Rothmans Williams Renault. Schumacher defended his title in 1995. He was the youngest F1 driver to win back to back drivers’ championships until Sebastian Vettel broke this record.\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Scuderia Ferrari and helped them come second in the Constructors Championship. Between 2000 and 2004, Schumacher had a winning streak, winning the Drivers’ Championship and Constructors Championship for Ferrari for five consecutive years. 2003 saw Schumacher beat the record that Fangio set by winning his sixth Drivers’ Championship.\n\nMichael Schumacher’s son, Mick Schumacher has also made a career for himself in Formula 1, following in his father’s footsteps. Mick Schumacher signed with Haas Formula One Team in 2021 after winning the 2020 Formula 2 Championship. Below is a trailer clip of the Netflix documentary “Schumacher” which gives a great account of the F1 drivers life before his devastating skiing accident in 2013 that put him in a coma and has left him with life changing injuries.\n\nScuderia Ferrari F1 2022 Drivers\n\nCharles Leclerc\n\nCharles Leclerc, Monegasque born driver, has had long connections to the Scuderia Ferrari team, taking part in the Ferrari Driver Academy when he was younger. Charles Leclerc made it into Formula One when he won the Formula 2, 2017 season. Leclerc made his debut with Ferrari in 2019. Leclerc had a very successful first season, winning two races, seven pole positions and ten podiums. The driver from Monaco finished in fourth place in the World Championship that same year.\n\nThat year Charles Leclerc also became the second-youngest driver to qualify on pole position in F1 at Bahrain Grand Prix and he also won his first Grand Prix in Belgium that same year. Charles Leclerc also became the youngest driver to win the Pole Trophy for most poles in his first season with Scuderia Ferrari. The 24 year old was offered a four year season contract with Ferrari, a huge achievement considering majority of contracts in Formula One are two years. In 2022, Charles Leclerc has already beaten his 2019 success with an impressive three victories and eight pole positions, and the season is still not over. Charles Leclerc placed second in the Drivers Championship 2022.\n\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\n\nCarlos Sainz Jr. has made quite the name for himself since he joined Formula One in 2015, racing for Toro Rosso. The Spanish driver is the son of World Rally Champion, Carlos Sainz. The pressure of his father’s legacy has not taken its toll on Sainz Jr. who is quite the ‘smooth operator’ on the track. Although, Carlos’ F1 career with Toro Rosso didn’t begin very smoothly.\n\nThe Spaniard finished in 15th and 12th position in the Drivers’ Championship for his first two years. During his third season with Toro Rosso, Carlos moved to Renault where he finished in seventh position in 2017. Carlos Sainz Jr. then went on to be signed by McLaren, whom he raced for in 2019 and 2020. Sainz Jrs. performance with McLaren caught the attention of Scuderia Ferrari for the 2021 season. In his first year with Ferrari, Sainz Jr claimed four podiums and placed fifth in the Drivers’ Championship, two positions ahead of his teammate Leclerc. In 2022, Carlos got his first win with Ferrari at the British Grand Prix.\n\nBoth Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. are signed on to Ferrari until the end of the 2024 season. The duo have performed very well with pole positions, 1-2 finishes and many podiums in 2022. It will be exciting to see what else they can achieve in the seasons to come.\n\nScuderia Ferrari: Timeline of Victories\n\n1951\n\nIn 1951, Jose Froilan Gonzalez wins the British Grand Prix at Silverstone marking Ferrari’s first ever victory in Formula 1.\n\n1952-1953\n\nItalian driver Alberto Ascari wins Ferrari’s first ever Drivers’ Championship in 1952 and wins his second one in 1953.
