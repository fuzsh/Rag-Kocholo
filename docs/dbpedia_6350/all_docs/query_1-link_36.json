        "text": "Hawthorn in chassis No. 0320AM, while running second behind 0318AM pulled into the pits just after completing the 12th lap to have his brakes checked. In the pits the brakes were bled for safety and the reservoir topped off. An obscure pre-war Le Mans rule stipulated that no fluids (oil, water etc...) could be added until at least 28 laps were completed. This highly dangerous rule was protested by Ferrari and, for the 1954 race, thrown out. However with the 1953 race over, there was nothing Ferrari could do.\n\nShortly after the completion of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both 0320AM and 0322AM had their engines bored out to 4.5 liters making them full 375MMs. (0318AM had been fitted with an experimental 4.5 engine just prior to the 24 Hours of Le Mans race). It should be noted that these three 375MMs and a lone 375MM Vignale Spyder, chassis No. 0286AM were all fitted with a variation of the ex-Grand Prix developed 4.5 liter engine that utilized a bore and stroke of 80.0mm x 74.5mm for a total displacement of 4494 cc. Factory records identify that these engines produced 384 bhp at 7500 rpm. Subsequent Customer 375MM Berlinettas and Spyders utilized an all new short stroke engine of 84mm x 68 mm for a total displacement of 4523cc. This second generation short stroke engine produced 340 bhp at a lower 7000 rpm."
