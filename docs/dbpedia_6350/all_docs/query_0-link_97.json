        "text": "From Michael to Max, what a change​​​​ ​​\n\n​​\n\nIn the first 12 GPs of the season, Max Verstappen has scored 314 points out of a maximum of 336, the equivalent of 93.45%. Only Alberto Ascari in 1952 and 1953 and Jim Clark in 1963 and 1965 have succeeded in ending a year in Formula 1 with a higher percentage and only because of the elimination system qualifying format in place at the time.\n\nIn the championships without elimination, Michael Schumacher holds the record and in 2002 in a Ferrari with a Brembo brake system scored 144 points out of 170, the equivalent of 84.71%. At the time, carbon brake discs had just 72 ventilation holes all arranged in one row with a 10 mm diameter compared with the over 1000 holes with a 3 mm diameter on the present-day single-seaters.\n\n6 corners in a row where the brakes are used\n\nThe Formula 1 drivers use their brakes on 9 of the 14 turns on the Dutch track: from turn 8 to turn 13, the brakes are vital whereas from turn 4 to turn 7, they are never used. On one lap, the drivers use their brakes for a total of 11.3 seconds which amounts to 16% of the entire GP race.\n\nThe extremely smooth flowing of the track is confirmed by the presence of only 1 turn where braking lasts more than 2 seconds and just 4 turns with a stopping distance of only 55 meters (180.4 feet). Three braking moments, on the other hand, require a load on the brake pedal of over 100 kg (220 lb) and yet from the start to the finish, each driver exerts a force of 61.5 metric tons, almost the same as the Austrian GP.\n\n191 km/h (118.6 mph) less with 141 kg (310.9 lb) of load ​ ​​​​\n\nOf the 9 braking sections at the Dutch GP, 2 are classified as highly demanding on the brakes, 3 are of medium difficulty and the remaining 4 are light.\n\nThe most difficult braking is on the first turn because the cars come off a 1.1 km (0.69 mile) straight with no braking on the last turn. The single-seaters hit the brakes at 310 km/h (192 mph) and drop to 118 km/h (73 mph) in just 119 meters (390.4 feet).\n\nTo do this, the drivers brake for 2.28 seconds, applying a load of 141 kg (310.9 lb) on the brake pedal and experiencing 4.7G of deceleration.\n\nAnd what about the video games? ​​\n\nTackling Corner 1 on the Circuit Zandvoort in the Formula 1 video game is fairly easy: start braking as soon as you pass the 100 m sign.\n\nMove down into 3rd gear and gradually move over onto the inside so that you just touch the curb without going up onto it.\n\nSince it is a hairpin, there is no need to open the throttle immediately; wait a few seconds and make sure you discharge the braking torque when coming out of the turn. ​"
