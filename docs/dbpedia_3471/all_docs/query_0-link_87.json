        "text": "6. The Image of Victory\n\nThe 2021 movie Image of Victory is about the battle for the southern Israeli Kibbutz Nitzanim and its surrender to Egyptian forces during the War of Independence in 1948. It was directed by Avi Nesher, one of Israel’s most famous cinematographers.\n\nThe title relates to the mission of a young Egyptian journalist to capture the image of Egyptian victory over the kibbutz, and offers an ambitious, and beautiful, glimpse to the troubles and difficulties of both warring parties. In light of the current war, this could be particularly sad to watch.\n\n7. The Wedding Plan\n\nThe Wedding Plan centers around a story that could happen, even if only on film, only in Israel. Michal is a single Jewish Orthodox woman who is determined to get married. So determined, that the wedding hall is booked and everything is in place – apart from the groom. That part, Noa leaves in God’s hands.\n\nOn her way to find her match, Michal encounters all sorts of people, including her favorite secular popstar, who for a moment becomes viable husband material. The cast include some of Israel’s best actors, including Noa Koler (Checkout, see below) in the lead role. Not exactly a romantic comedy, but both romantic and funny.\n\n8. Forgiveness\n\nAlso in the only-in-Israel category, Forgiveness is a wacky movie about friends in crime who parted ways badly when one of them went to jail for bank robbery and the other managed to escape. Upon meeting years later, the friend who got away asks for the forgiveness of the one who didn’t, but things don’t end well. There’s romance, war and even the British Royal Dance Academy involved, in a fun and fast-paced movie packed with stellar actors.\n\n9. Checkout\n\nTaking wacky to a completely new level is Checkout, one of the hit TV shows in Israel in recent years. The show follows the antics taking place at a fictional supermarket, focusing on its employees and customers, and is so very funny because each of the characters is one you’ve encountered millions of times, now distilled to their quirky, annoying or unique essence.\n\nThe show’s cast is a roll call of Israel’s finest comedic actors, and while the plotline might seem very place-oriented, the story it tells is utterly universal.\n\n10. Fauda\n\nLast but not least, this list would not be complete without Fauda. The hit TV show, which captivated audiences all around the globe, manages to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a complex, non-obvious way without glossing over its violence and ugliness while still retaining an action-packed, fun beat and array of hugely likeable characters from both sides."
