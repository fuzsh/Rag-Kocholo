        "text": "After Léontine is Léa. Léa is the second series documented in Cinema’s First Nasty Women. It appears that she had more than three films, though that’s all we get here. What is included is a real grab bag of shorts that don’t feel like they’re from the same thing. The first is a little on the realism side, the second an ensemble you could imagine is about a series of buffoonish couples, and the third surreal. It’s hard to believe these were intended for the same series, especially with the second not featuring Léa prominently. Then again, Léontine had almost this amount of variety. There still were more noticeable constants due to having most of her films, fifteen. These Léa films are incredibly varied in terms of quality, sometimes there’s good ideas and sometimes really poor ones.\n\nLéa sui pattini aka Léa on Rollerskates (1911) is essentially Léa falling over on roller skates. Too little is done with the idea, though the ending is good. Léa lacks a personality, being a vessel that silly things happen to. If she had an identity, that could liven up this basic time-killer. Léa’s house looks like Léontine’s. Maybe they’re the same one? Overall, this is pretty much just one basic joke, which isn’t too painful due to how short it is. Léa’s falling isn’t great, but it suggests a desire to be a clown force in her own right.\n\nNothing really happens in Riposo festivo aka A Lively Day Off (1912). It goes through the motions of the story that lead to the end, with little forward drive. The ending is also far too predictable. A more significant problem is that the only characters that get much comedic material are two men. The women aren’t, other than when they briefly pester the men just as basically as women would in your average silent comedy. The character of Léa is often off to the background, doing nothing as desperately basic antics consume the screen. The story or humor aren’t exactly stellar, even on their own merits.\n\nLastly, there’s Léa bambola aka Léa as a Doll (1913). Finally we get a woman showing some identity and comedic ability. Léa is very fun here, committed to pretending to be a doll for ridiculous reasons. There’s some lovely absurdities here and Léa has a chance to show off her funny falling and her being lit up at the end of the short, acting like an explosive actual human being. The core idea and some elements are also good, like having a doll sign an important legal document, and everyone accepting a doll even could do such a thing. A criticism is that there could’ve been more done with this premise than was, though what we get is pretty solid, especially with the ending of Léa just loving life.\n\nSPOILERS for Léa on Rollerskates\n\nPeople chasing after our lead, but they go slowly because they’re in skates is pretty amusing. Léa being attached to a car at the end by the angry bystanders is a great way to end this one-joke half-reeler. A group of “straight man” characters running after the leading lady is very Léontine. It’s an interesting twist for them to actually catch her, and for what they do to be a charming bit of wackiness. This short suggests a character who ends up being a failure in situations. She literally is sent away when she wasn’t even intentionally knocking people over. Hopefully more shorts explored this element, taking it further. The Doll episode would be even more satisfying as she’d be fighting back against imposing forces.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe formula of these half-reel comedies was getting stale with Léontine. Léa continues a lot of those tropes, generally falling below Léontine. Just like her, Léa does have some good moments, with Léa as a Doll being the best short so far. The little bits of characterization in the first short and a bit more, tandem with better gags, in the third suggests there might be some quality Léa out there somewhere, wherein perhaps it’s a great shame we pretty much only have fragments here.\n\nCinema’s First Nasty Women is a triumphant Blu-ray box set that collects a large sum of old comedies – comedies that, you guessed, feature female comedians prominently. The first of many collected works is the Léontine series. The fifteen featured films detail a raucous girl that delights in chaos and destruction. This premise is of course open to including the funniest thing you’ve ever seen or something very middle of the road. Many popular silent comedies have a similar premise, notably Charlie Chaplin’s Keystone work. The contrast of using a young girl instead of what’s supposed to be a middle aged man does give more potential to this series. Many of these shorts are half-reelers. What you’d hope is that they pack an extremely mean punch before quickly concluding, using the limited timeframe to be concise. Unfortunately, ideas either don’t have enough time to develop or there’s too little of an idea, with that five or so minutes being far too inessential.\n\nThere is a common formula. “Léontine goes in public and is destructive, affected people run after her, repeat until a whole bunch of people are after her.” Her tricks are not very different or interesting from each other, so it can be tedious to watch all of these. The first available short, Léontine deviant trottin aka Léontine Becomes an Errand Girl (1910), is representative of this. It’s one of the more uneventful, though it is incomplete. There are strangely many needless intertitles. Who thought that and the moral at the end were a good idea? Fortunately, neither stick around. Another trope is the townsfolk being way too animated or extremely idiotic, such as in Les malices de Léontine aka Léontine’s Pranks (1912).\n\nThere are sometimes little bits that suggest the brilliance these could’ve been. Many of these films have beautiful backgrounds, with lived-in buildings and rich lighting. Les Ficelles de Léontine aka Léontine Pulls the Strings (1910) is a good example, with the episode otherwise a standard runaround. Léontine en apprentissage aka Léontine’s Apprenticeship (1910) features our lead fighting some boys. That is a great moment to give her some personality. Despite that, this short is lacking in moments you could even call jokes. Léontine goes into a room and destroys something in it. Fortunately, when black paint is dumped on her, there aren’t any racial gags that would date the film.\n\nLéontine s’envole aka Léontine Gets Carried Away (1911) has a great twist, though the development of the story and the gags themselves are among the most plain. The ending is pretty dull. The pun in the title is very smirkable. The prime example of this issue is in La pile électrique de Léontine aka Léontine’s Battery (1910), which has a box that can electrocute people, topped off with a good special effect, and an even better ending. Regardless, the short is very formulaic, mostly being one joke and more damningly the lead does very little. You could imagine basically anyone serving her role here.\n\nSpeaking of which, what of Léontine’s personality? Sadly, she often just laughs at the destruction she causes or sets up said destruction. She could have things like a unique walk or fall (which the aforementioned Chaplin had) or any personality beyond a generative force that destroys people’s things and gives them something to run at. To illustrate my point, during Ventilateur breveté aka The New Air Fan (1911), I thought I might’ve played the wrong short due to not seeing Léontine. She’s one of the few bicyclists. She doesn’t even do anything chaotic, as it’s not suggested she was purposely trying to blow people away with the fan. Save for a shot of her at the end, you could show this to someone that’s seen some of this series and they wouldn’t think this was a Léontine film due to her being filmed from a distance for most of it. She doesn’t act wild, just simply rides her bike. This is also one of the better shorts, with the gags having some escalation. It is relatively predictable, but is still amusing due to an absurd premise and a little escalation, especially with that great theremin score.\n\nProbably the weakest of these is Rosalie et Léontine vont au théâtre aka Rosalie and Léontine Go to the Theater (1911). Having a friend that’s just as destructive as the leading lady is a great idea, with them able to be more of a force as a duo, yet they are confined to a theater where they are reasonably static and get up to what you’d expect, they’re loud and make messes. Rosalie is so undistinguished, with jokes not even playing off of the duo element or her as an individual, making you wonder why she’s here. As is typical, there’s no real development to the humor.\n\nIn Un ravalement précipité aka A Hasty Renovation (1911), Léontine is pretty ordered and not destructive, as if someone forgot who this character was. She and the other cast members do very little, and thus don’t get laughs. There’s once again this strange issue of there not even really being jokes often. Too much cleaning. It’s a lot more fun to see a fearless Léontine, so this film is a least favorite. It’s amusing to think this was set right after she had an episode of destroying everything. It’s not fun to see Léontine worried about the consequences of her actions.\n\nDespite these negatives, the series does roughly improve. It seems possible they understood some of these criticisms and sought to fix them. In Léontine enfant terrible aka Léontine, the Troublemaker (1911), Léontine is more charming in how much effort she puts into being destructive. Her facial expressions paint her as someone who seems determined. The gags are a little more inventive than usually, with it not always being obvious what she’ll do. Still, the series could be doing more, trying to be as outrageous as possible, but this is still decent.\n\nLe bateau de Léontine aka Léontine’s Boat (1911) is glorious chaos. This one utilizes a simple premise effectively. Gags escalate, with things getting crazier and crazier. You don’t expect it to go as far as it does. Léontine does very little, but this short demands less of her than usual as the premise does have her “careless destructor” stamp in its DNA and it’s such a good premise. All topped with the name of the short being so hilariously understated. This is just about a “one joke” film, but it’s quite short and that joke has slight variations and extremely strong visuals. It’s fun to just imagine it being filmed and how much destruction had to be done. Léontine’s Boat is very outrageous.\n\nAmour et musique aka Love and Music (1911) finally gives Léontine a really funny introduction to the story, with her adopting a musical instrument. The score is great, perfectly portraying her silliness. Despite this, this is one of the less eventful outings. Tragically, Léontine ultimately softens. In Léontine garde la maison aka Léontine Keeps House (1912), Léontine seems to have the best of intentions, but is just careless. That being said, this is a simple premise, which married to a few twists makes it one of the best shorts here, though due to the character shift, it’s a lot less lovable.\n\nThe listed last short for this character in the box set is La peur des ombres aka Fear of Shadows (1911). The lived-in backgrounds are just beautiful to look at, as are the darkly lit scenes, making a sharp setting for the bumbling cops. They at one point physically pull on terrified women. In a realistic scenario, they’d just tell them whatever they’re trying to show them, but because this is silent a visual way to convey that is needed. The twist is very good. Despite the fact that the main character of this series barely appears, the more ambitious filming style makes this the best short here. It would be funny if the advertising for this episode made no mention of Léontine, so her appearance would be more of a surprise.\n\nLéontine en vacances aka Léontine on Vacation (1910) has a gloriously chaotic score (for a middling installment). So many of the scores for these films really amplify the experience. I would imagine that the people doing them have a good understanding of the energy the lead resonates, due to having a slightly unsettling feel. To nitpick, these films are not presented on the set in order, which seems like it’d be an obvious thing to do.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nIt’s not fun to see Léontine lose, as she does in installments like Léontine on Vacation. She’s supposed to be a challenge to society. If society wins, then that’s too boring. You can see people get in trouble for breaking the rules everywhere.\n\nThere are some interesting themes. In Léontine Pulls the Strings, the townspeople, thinking a scarecrow is Léontine, beat it. It’s a little more understandable how Léontine would become like how she is if this is the environment she was brought up in. Léontine on Vacation suggests that Léontine’s family doesn’t know she’s a troublemaker, as she’s allowed to roam around. Maybe they don’t care? At least some of her family do expressly mind her behavior, though no one in this series seems to know who she is, as if she wouldn’t have a reputation. In Léontine’s Pranks, a woman’s skirt falls off and instead of putting it on, she chases after Léontine. This goes to show how crazed these characters often are to get Léontine, at the cost of disobeying social order. As an aside, I wonder if it wasn’t supposed to fall off and when it did, the actress improvised?\n\nFavorite gags include in Pulls the Strings, where Léontine tricks a man before beating him with an object. The ending of Léontine’s Battery, where she evades capture by electrocuting authority figures. The New Air Fan starts with a good visual set piece, then there’s things like some people wanting to cool off, only for the fans to come and blow them away. At the end, a car with those fans comes out and blows the bicyclists away. In Léontine Keeps House, none of the townspeople check if they’re giving our hero the right kid and dog, further showcasing the lack of any sane minds. There’s something extremely charming about the ending, where Léontine is surrounded by dogs and babies. Léontine randomly falling in love in Love and Music, especially with a funny man, is amusingly absurd. Hopefully this isn’t supposed to be a “taming”. It works better as just being the most unexpected thing to happen, not a straight usage of this tired trope.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhile the character of Léontine is praised for being a challenge to authority, she does often pick on random people who aren’t doing anything wrong, just living their lives. This isn’t a critique, but this can go to show how characters like this can be exaggerated to be as thought out and interesting as possible, when it was really more about the comedy. It’s great historical films like these are being preserved. Despite my many criticisms, these vignettes should be available for those interested to see, at least as proof that comedy wasn’t as male-dominated as some might think. The shorts I like are Léontine, the Troublemaker; Léontine’s Boat; and Fear of Shadows. None of these three, or the others, are anything essential or brilliant, but those three have the greatest density of quality laughs.\n\nThe Madcap Laughs is the first Syd Barrett solo album, though as far as I’m concerned it’s the second. Madcap is a far more sensible follow-up to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn than A Saucerful of Secrets was. Despite this, Madcap is in many ways a subversion from what you might’ve expected. Instead of getting the type of production on tracks like “Jugband Blues”, you get a much more simplistic style at times, including many pure folk tracks. At the same time, you get some band tracks. Those band tracks, while often keeping at least a toe in folk, have psychedelic elements that make them feel like Pink Floyd, with a big omission being the keyboard. “No Man’s Land”, “Here I Go”, “Late Night”, and especially “Octopus” all seem like a keyboard away from being on a hypothetical Floyd album that follows Piper. Even “Golden Hair”’s light touches make it seem like a reasonable fit. “No Good Trying” and “Love You” of course do have keys, but the different style of keyboardist Mike Ratledge is apparent.\n\nThe lyrics are often magically nonsensical, though still make their point just as strong or stronger than more straightforward ones. “Yes you’re spinning around and around in a car with electric lights flashing very fast…” This quality is especially noticeable on the love songs. “Terrapin” is sung slowly with a psychedelic entrancing guitar. “Well, oh baby, my hairs on end about you.” captures the track’s vibe well. That all being said, the song would’ve been a better side-a closer. It’s quite long. “No Good Trying” shows Syd’s still great at doing jam tracks, feeling like it could’ve been a new direction for him that combines the free and lucid Pink Floyd with a more jazz-esque group like Soft Machine. “Love You” captures the spirit of slightly manic and very hard to explain falling-into-love. It’s a lovely lighthearted romper. This ‘love for life’ style is so joyful that it’s sad Syd didn’t do it more. “No Man’s Land” is the half-way point between the last two songs, it’s got great rocking out and feels like an extension of Floyd.\n\n“Dark Globe” overtly discusses Syd’s depression and disillusionment. Arguably we were led into this by the garble at the end of the previous track. That could be seen as the entrance into the darker Syd. Globe seems to be about Syd falling to his death and asking if he’d be missed, with a heart wrenching and angsty vocal. While the next track, “Here I Go”, is on the surface another fluffier cut, Syd’s voice is cold, like he’s trying to relive a teenage experience after feeling emotionally broken. In fact, the song was written in 1965, when he first started writing music. It ends with a great mini-jam. That’s not the most exciting way to end side-a. Side-b’s opener would’ve been a better choice.\n\n“Octopus” is rightfully the most well known track here. Its lyrics describe a mythical fairytale land. The line, “close our eyes to the octopus ride” suggests a darker subject, that you should ignore something approaching in favor of something unbelievable. Syd’s voice then gets colder as he sings about being “lost in the woods”. The lyrics continue to take baby steps into darkness, as does the vocal, which becomes more and more strained, like it needs air. This striking metaphor for Syd creeps under the surface, with the double-tracked vocals and other effects amplifying the otherworldliness. This track is the one you should hear from this album if you only do one and is my favorite.\n\n“Golden Hair” is another highlight, imitating the style of “spacious instrumentals” with Syd’s slow strumming and singing. The lyrics are fantastic, like a bedtime story being read to you. That being said, Syd didn’t write them. This is yet more of a look into his interest in fairy tales and poetry. There’s a sudden transition to the more simplistic “Long Gone”. As if to be an antithesis to the earlier love songs, this one is about a romance crumbling. That cold style of “just singing and guitar” goes on for four tracks. They are understandably very personal and intimidating. The nonsense lyrics now feel like they’re being sung by a man who’s really lost it. To apply a “concept” to the album, it could be about a man who has a relationship he loves, it ends, can’t accept it and lets it consume his mind, with him thinking about the good and bad times and in the case of Hair, a poem from his youth. This is represented in lines like, “You feel me away far too empty, oh so alone. I want to go home. Oh, find me inside of a nocturne – the blonde.” As he loses it more, the lyrics become more strange.\n\nWhile these four songs are great, they don’t mesh so well with the others due to stylistic differences. It would’ve been nice to get a full album of mostly or all band tracks and another of mostly or all folk tracks. The studio chatter also does remove from the experience, pulling you out of the spell you’re put under. The final track, “Late Night”, is unsettling, with passionate lyrics and a sound atmosphere. The lyrics are very innocent, being about missing a girl and her kisses. The stress in his voice, lines like, “when the rooftops shone dark”, and considering what we’ve just heard make this seem like it’s about a suicide. Still, maybe you can get away with sending this to someone you’re into without the context of what’s come before, as the lyrics are very romantic.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe quiet sounds tying off the record might be considered lacking in comparison to the “bigger” “Bike” track of Piper, though it does thematically fit with what The Madcap Laughs is going for. It doesn’t want to blow you out. The biggest strength and weakness is how Syd it is. As a Syd fan, it can be a lot, though it’s still so flavorful and captivating. A non-Syd fan might not be able to appreciate it beyond a few out of context cuts, as it’s like listening to someone’s disturbed thoughts.\n\n1970 yielded some fantastic songs for Pink Floyd (and especially for Syd Barrett, but that’s for another day). They have quite a lot of leftovers, possibly due to working on the Zabriskie Point movie and expecting a vinyl release that never came. Hopefully these weren’t too close to how they were supposed to sound, as much of what’s here is forgettable and ill-thought out. That would be more acceptable if these were barely getting off the ground. There’s a track like “Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up”, which actually got released and seems like just a less cohesive or well-worked version of “Careful with That Axe, Eugene”. There was already a released studio and live version. They couldn’t have put in another? 51 seems like a highlight reel of bits of Eugene. “On the Highway” is a particular favorite outtake, which wasn’t released at the time.\n\nThere are many inconsequential jams, which seem to have missed being fully realized. If recorders were more common in the early 60s-1967 version of the band, maybe we’d get stuff like this, pleasant noodling? “Alan’s Blues” is one, showcasing a more traditional rock guitar solo. As much can be said for “Just Another Twelve Bar”. “Love Scene (Version 5)” is when the noodling got more tiresome (don’t listen to these all in one sitting), with it going on with “Love Scene (Version 6)”. “Libest Spacement Monitor” and “More Blues” have some good interplay, like between the guitar and keyboard, but are inconsequential.\n\n“Oenone” just seems like someone, probably Richard Wright, playing around with sounds for possible use of backing a song. “Love Scene (Version 4)” is a pleasant keyboard number. It might not be so bad to have on in the background. “The Violent Sequence”, aka “Us and Them (Richard Wright Demo)” is another track of that sort. While this is definitely on the right track, it feels incomplete and poorly performed, like Rick was just testing out ideas. Of course, this would later become a very nice and finished song.\n\n“Country Song” is more finished-sounding, but like one of the throwaways from an album like More. The vocal is very weak, as if everyone’s sick of it. “Richard Are You Ready Yet?” is too low quality to make out much. It’s not even really a song, strange it’s considered one by fans. “Instrumental Improvisations 1, 2, 3” is incoherent playing and vocalizing. It might’ve been fun to be playing there, but not so much to listen to.\n\nSome of the better tracks include “Rain in the Country”. It has a great light guitar sound, though it goes on forever, not being very interesting beyond the beginning. As much can be said for “Heart Beat, Pig Meat”. The repetitive percussion is at first very captivating, being quite unique. The rhythm and beat are reasonably sharp, though the novelty soon wears off. “Embryo (From Picnic – A Breath of Fresh Air)” feels low effort, like a computer generated Pink Floyd song. It has that whisper voice, the drum tapping in the background, and things of that sort. In terms of how good it is, it’s dead average.\n\n“Long Blues” has a good groove and doesn’t quite feel its length, but it lacks a certain spark, like a drive to keep you invested. “Fingal’s Cave” is one of the finest tracks here. It has a good otherworldly quality to it. That being said, what’s with the moaning and sex noises? They’re really uncomfortable. There’s a four minute version that’s just some atmospheric sounds and a much punchier two minute version, which is by far the best, getting to the point of this little jam. The reason this article starts in December 1969 is because I forgot to include “The Merry Xmas Song” last time. It’s very funny, like the sort of novelty track that sometimes is on 60s rock records. Nick has some joy in his voice and in general everyone seems to be having a good time. It’s hard not to love. We got a Pink Floyd Christmas song!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhat is or isn’t worthwhile here is up to the individual. Personally, the Syd band did no wrong, even with their live instrumentals. He had a certain spark. If you feel that way about this lineup, you might love everything here. If not, a lot of this is tedious, but ‘tis the nature of these rare recordings.\n\nPink Floyd seem unable to escape soundtracks for too long. Such efforts are interesting as their music often puts strong emphasis on being cohesive in their own right. Even the Roger solo soundtrack Music from The Body was partially rerecorded so it’d be more cohesive as an album. Yet, More, the mostly unreleased Zabriskie Point recordings, and Obscured by Clouds are like filler installments. The other records are intended to be heavy-hitters while these suffer from not being able to experience half of what it’s going for as it’s supplemental to visuals. There are many great soundtrack albums, so it’s not like a record can’t serve both purposes.\n\nEven if you take these songs as a collection of stray tracks, which would set better expectations than expecting a concept album off the back of three others, they’re inconsistent. Even if you set the deck in this album’s favor, it is sometimes difficult to get past the very manufactured sound. Take the opener, “Obscured by Clouds”, which feels extremely synthesized. A big guitar part then awkwardly shoots out. The vocals are pretty ridiculous and low effort on some tracks, like “Burning Bridges”. Rick seems particularly sleepy. Let him rest! The harmonized vocals will put you to sleep!\n\n“The Gold It’s in the…” is reasonably stupid due to it being offbeat. Still, it has some energy and is fun. About as much can be said for “Wot’s… Uh the Deal?”, except David Gilmour seems more invested in his vocal. The guitar solo does kind of sound like the average of every guitar solo ever, but it’s charming, possibly as Gilly seems proud of this one. “Childhood’s End” is even more formulaic and we get more tired David. “Free Four” is not very Pink Floyd, seeming possibly inspired by the Beatles or other bands that have more hippie whimsey. It seems like a more concrete idea than the tracks here that just seem like incidental music. This style of “slightly-off pop rock” could’ve made for a cool concept album, one that would possibly parody tropes of such music. That idea could also probably do great backing a movie, so it’s a shame those really good moments are quite fleeting.\n\n“Mudmen”’s guitar solo shrieks, possibly as if it’s extremely epic or impactful. It’s just laughable, especially when coming unexpectedly, like it’s there to satisfy a formula. The first three instrumentals seem almost interchangeable with jam sessions by your average rock band. “Stay” is extremely hokey, feeling like a disposable love song with extremely generic backing and lyrics. The guitar solo is ungodly tacky. This is the weakest cut here, feeling like either a mandate or like a dare to make a track like this. It being about a guy that can’t remember a girl’s name is funny. That suggests it’s supposed to be a parody of these sorts of songs. If it is, it’s simply too convincing as the genuine article. “Absolutely Curtains” has a nice ethereal opening. It’s a really novel piece that doesn’t feel too long. The vocals are pretty poor, though, with one or two specifically feeling unsuited. That summarizes the lack of care for this whole record.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNone of these songs are great, though some are quite enjoyable. There is a half-braindead rock excess at times, like on “The Gold It’s in the…”, “Wot’s… Uh the Deal?”, and “Free Four”. All escape being so bad they’re good due to the fluidity of the group and some passion, especially on the jammy Four. “Absolutely Curtains” has a really good idea that is mostly done well. Its downfalls don’t dampen it too much. Obscured by Clouds certainly could’ve done more than it manages to, but it’s worth at least a single listen for those interested. Of all the bad or inconsistent Floyd albums beforehand, which almost all have been, this one doesn’t get too low, though it strives for less.\n\nFor the record, “Mudmen” and Wot’s were the only two tracks I really liked last time I heard this, but now my views have changed a bit.\n\nWho knew Roger Waters ASMR folk music would be so captivating?\n\nMusic from The Body, almost certainly accidentally, demonstrates Roger yet again doing something Syd Barrett did first, folk music. This is essentially his first solo album. Apparently he was involved with every track, but I can’t say for sure. What is known is he has relatively few writing credits or vocals. What he does get he uses well. Despite how rough his voice often is, he can be so soft and gentle here that it’s near angelic. The guitar playing is also so pretty and pleasant. This folk styling suits him well. His lyrics about childhood and later environmental issues make for powerful contrast. The latter material is especially strong in light of modern problems. “Breathe” is perhaps my favorite track here.\n\nThe instrumentals by Ron Geesin, which dominate the album, are mixed-to-poor. The first track is disgusting, containing farts and burps and sounds of that sort. The first song on each side of the album are the weakest, sounding like a random assortment of noises. The b-side opener is annoying in such a way that suggests the two were trying to irritate. Many of the instrumentals feel directionless on their own, though they would probably make a lot more sense as soundtrack music, which they were made for. As is, they sometimes seem to never end.\n\nWhile the tracks are often very hectic, being a cacophony of noise, some tracks are very melodic, like “Old Folks Ascension” and “Piddle in Perspex”. Tracks like those are sometimes boring and insignificant, while something like “More Than Seven Dwarfs in Penis-Land” is either filler or intentionally crude. A good balance between experimental and structured is sometimes captured, like on “The Womb Bit”, “Embryo Thought”, “Dance of the Red Corpuscles”, “Bed-Time-Dream-Clime”, and “Sea Shell and Soft Stone”. The first and last feature a Waters co-write. Those tracks feel fluid and mark what could’ve been a solid direction for Pink Floyd to go in (and did in a way). The first three would’ve worked as one big piece. “Bed-Time-Dream-Clime” is a favorite, due to some lovely guitar playing.\n\nSide-b seems to have some of the lesser instrumentals. The second last of which is a particular lowlight. “Mrs. Throat Goes Walking”’s vocal sounds also seem designed to irritate. “Sea Shell and Soft Stone” features good orchestration. An alternate version of the music that puts it right after “Sea Shell and Stone”, from around the start of side-a uses it better. They tie together very strongly, Soft escalating the former song. Soft ends like it’d be the last track, then it isn’t. The beginning of the actual last is a nice surprise. “Give Birth to a Smile” feels like a traditional rock song. It features Pink Floyd backing, so that makes sense. It doesn’t match the avant-garde or folk material before, as it’s the only rock track. It is about as good as the folk material, though the lack of Roger’s intense vocal puts it slightly below.\n\nThe film versions of the Roger songs are generally better, but Smile‘s studio version is more cohesive and benefits from crisper quality. The female backing singers are really good. The film versions have more sound effects, which adds to the world Roger is creating. They’re wisely kept simple, with things like birds chirping. The soundtrack versions are still very solid, but less special and less impactful due to the lack of that added element. “Roger’s Proposition”, which was only in the film, is more hippie junk. It’s like you got him stoned and asked him to talk about whatever that could be passably related to the rest of the album.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAs has been a theme, Pink Floyd material that wasn’t on their albums was better than their albums. That being said, the Roger tracks would almost definitely not work with a band. If they were put on a Floyd album as they are, that might seem too strange as it wouldn’t really be Floyd. It would’ve benefited the group to get in whatever mindset they needed to make songs of this quality. The Geesin cuts are definitely a niche. If this was to be constructed for the sake of a Floyd fan, it would’ve been nice to get a Roger-led EP with these tracks on it. This marks an oddity for him, due to his reasonably different voice that makes him hard to identify at points. Those are just about the ones that are strong enough for repeat listening.\n\nStars of Bedlam: The Rise & Fall of the Marx Brothers is a fascinating read that details exactly what it says on the tin. The writer, who goes by “the Holy Bee”, details the story of the brothers from when their parents were born, and more extensively when Chico and Groucho began their careers, from around 1905 all the way to about 1930. You’ll note that that’s not when the brothers broke up (Depending on how you look at it, it’d be 1941, 1949, or 1961; I’d go with the first). Part 7 of this eleven-part story is when things get much brisker. Admittedly, that is essentially “the point”. As the Holy Bee states, the “rise” from 1905-1930 is not so well documented, with the only recordings of the group being the first two movies, Too Many Kisses, and a little home movie footage; the earliest of which is from 1925.\n\nStarting around the start of the movies, other history books pick up and continue on, probably because we can actually see what they’re referring to. Even then, the “fall” isn’t covered so much either. The coverage of the Marx Brothers’ poor later films have the excuse of being something you can watch, thus that’s why the old plays are covered in detail, while the movies are in much less. However, the eleventh and final installment covers about thirty years, starting with the beginning of the brothers’ last film, Love Happy. There’s a decent amount of 60s and 70s material, and a lot of 50s, because they were tv stars. While you could say, “But that stuff is viewable!”, the behind the scenes stories aren’t so documented and a good chunk of the tv content is indeed missing or unavailable.\n\nThe first six parts make you hunger for more of the brothers, especially from that timeframe. “Why couldn’t television or the internet have been around, at least sound cameras, so the Marxes youthful anarchy could be viewable?” Some have speculated that a lot of their greatest moments are on the stage and are lost to documentation. Even if they were replicated in the movies, there would be factors working against them being as good or accurate. While each part of this biography is reasonably long, time isn’t wasted, with lots of juicy information that details our understanding of what this group would’ve been like. One favorite is James Beury and the $10,000 story, which seems like it was taken from a comedy. Zeppo apparently was briefly working with the group in 1914 and 1915, which is sometimes overlooked. It’d be nice to know why, especially as he’d later hang around sketchy characters.\n\nThere’s little on what Gummo was like on stage. Maybe the info here is all that we got, but if not there should’ve been more included? We get excerpts from an interview where Gummo basically says it was right for him to be removed from the act. He is funny there, so more of that interview would probably be worth including, for the sake of giving him a presence. At least we know he can get a laugh in how he discusses himself.\n\nPast 1930, you get a good understanding of how the brothers deal with different egos, who often have power; movie producers, directors, women, responsibilities of being a public figure. It seems that if the brothers were well to do financially and never had to worry about money, Room Service could’ve been their last film. We get a little on how they felt about having to go on, especially Groucho. Groucho can seem very sad in his older years, battling loneliness and the public image of being a character he’s grown beyond. His self destructive behavior apparently drove people away, but the specifics should be there. Did he say or do anything different from one wife to another? Was there a final straw? If so, what was it? Did he have moments of extreme weakness? If so, what? One really good story not in here was that the solo film Copacabana was reasonably successful, with people emphasizing him being a duo with Carmen Miranda. It seems Groucho didn’t want to be in a group and didn’t continue a potentially very lucrative career path. Why he wouldn’t in detail would’ve been a fascinating read, at least mention that incident.\n\nThe Holy Bee essentially doing reviews of the movies does feel out of place, especially after so many installments pre-anything to review, but that might be worthwhile to their fanbase. The series generally takes an objective look at the brothers, not being opinionated. The reviews can at times drown out the biographical part and once there are no more movies, the last segment is somewhat bullet point. Perhaps they didn’t feel anything was worth adding? A 2014 biography of theirs called Zeppo = Zero? A Totally Unexamined Life covers many tidbits not in Stars of Bedlam. Maybe they were excluded because they were already there, but the consequence is that Zeppo does seem strangely absent, especially because his dedicated post was reasonably quick and brisk.\n\nWhen Groucho dies, that’s essentially treated as the end of this story, with Zeppo’s later death almost a footnote. Despite Gummo and Zeppo’s lack of attention, Minnie did get a reasonable amount of coverage when she was alive. There’s a photo to commemorate Minnie, Frenchie, and the three main brothers when they go, but not for Gummo, Zeppo, and Margaret Dumont. The quality of Holy Bee’s writing is demonstrated due to how heartbreaking it is to get to the point where everyone is falling under poor health and ultimately dying. Based on this look into their lives, those deaths feel personal, especially as the three main brothers were all working the year before their passing.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFor a Marx fan, Stars of Bedlam: The Rise & Fall of the Marx Brothers is definitely worth a read, as is Zeppo = Zero? A Totally Unexamined Life, which perhaps should be read as a spiritual twelfth part, due to covering the end of the life of the last lasting Marx brother. Despite some spelling mistakes and other mentioned criticisms, it does collect so many goodies, both stories and high quality photos.\n\nThere’s some nice information on the dates and roles of people that worked with the Marxes, sometimes considered at the time to be just as important and starring in the act as the brothers themselves. I will flex my love of graphs and include a table of membership. This article was not my only source for it and there could be inaccuracies.\n\nHumor Risk (1921)\n\nDespite what people say, this is a great, great film. Zeppo’s dance number and Harpo’s harp solo are only some of the many highlights. You don’t even mind that the latter one is completely silent. I think I still prefer its sequel, A Night on the Balcony Floor (shame those bellends didn’t trust us to know what a mezzanine was).\n\nThe Paramount trailers\n\nParamount pretty boldly calls the Marx Brothers the funniest men on Earth after they made two films. Animal Crackers is called “Cocoa-nuttier than ever”. Amusingly, Zeppo doesn’t appear in Monkey Business’ trailer’s scenes from the movie. To be fair, Chico and Harpo aren’t shown doing anything funny, only a bit of music. My favorite part was when we saw the brothers in chairs facing away from the camera, then a wipe transitions them to now looking at it. The Duck Soup trailer is gloriously manic, just like the movie. If I watched the trailer back then without having seen a Marx movie, I’d really want to see it. I could not find trailers for the other two films.\n\n1930s studio shorts\n\nThe old short films that basically serve to say, “These are the stars we have!” are a fun novelty, though the smaller the dose the better. They are admittedly boring, despite being valuable historical artifacts. Sometimes an announcer cracks a lame joke. In Hollywood on Parade B-5, Fredric March and Chico Marx seem to be having a lot of fun. Everyone else, not so much. In the “Search for Beauty” contest, some of the girls come off as pretty awkward. As would later be done in Copacabana, the song “Go West, Young Man” is mentioned. Chico’s costume is the best by far. What was the point of Wonderland of California? It doesn’t even showcase stars. The camera records things that feel completely random. Seeing 30s color footage of Animal Crackers is quite the treat, though.\n\nLa Fiesta de Santa Barbara visually looks quite good. There’s also some nice music. It is a little silly that a short about a non-white place would feature a white singer. It will not be the last short here to mention this being a place where “Men are men”. What does that have to do with anything? It also won’t be the last to mention Jack Benny. Ted Healy acts like he’s trying to steal the show. He was unsuccessful. A favorite bit of the short is when someone thinks he was in A Night at the Opera. He also says the movie features the four Marx Brothers, instead of three. To my pleasant surprise, Chester Conklin and Buster Keaton appear in this film. This is more of a Buster movie than anyone else. He gets a few fun moments, like looking for the bell he’s supposed to ring and the final joke. His vocal is very wooden, despite being an adept speaker in his sound movies. The film’s Marx connection is a few seconds near the beginning of Harpo (who does essentially nothing).\n\nSunday Night at The Trocadero is pretty bourgie. Groucho doesn’t get to be funny, though you do see him without a real or fake mustache. A guy does what would pass as a JFK impression. The Joe E. Brown joke is a favorite, while the blackface bit is not. The movie got a vocal laugh from me with, “One of you boys will be left to pay the check, while the other takes her home. Or maybe the girl will have to pay the check, while the boys take each other home.”\n\n1930s miscellaneous\n\nIn “Wallace Kelly Movie Collection”, we get a cameo from Groucho’s book, Beds. In 1933, we get some nice bits of the four Brothers at an event (sourced from The Unknown Marx Brothers). That, and especially Groucho, Harpo, and Jackie Cooper’s go kart race really deserves to be restored and made more accessible. “Harpo Marx returns from stay in Russia” is a lot of fun. It’s only a minute and it features Harpo doing some typical shticks. It’s very amusing, though the women chasing isn’t my cup of tea.\n\nThe MGM (& Room Service) trailers\n\nIt’s great we got the brothers roaring in place of Leo the Lion preserved in the A Night at the Opera trailer. Harpo’s bit is especially good. Sadly, the trailer spoils the Stateroom scene. A Day at the Races uses footage from the very end of the movie. Room Service’s trailer spoils the movie. Groucho’s first scene in the Go West trailer is better than in the movie. There’s more comedic punch here. The introductions to the Marx Brothers in these trailers is reminiscent of the opening credits of the Paramounts, with their faces matched to their names in a punchy sequence. It’d be nice if the MGMs had this more interesting style in the movies.\n\nIt’s amazingly ironic when a man mentions that Sarah Bernhardt had announced her retirement over ten times, with the trailer then asserting that the featured film, The Big Store, will be the brothers’ last. Of course, it turned out to be their third last. This almost seems like a Marx joke, that they’d essentially have this punchline setup here that would years later be paid off with the release of A Night in Casablanca. Groucho calls it their “first farewell picture”. Store’s trailer is probably the best trailer of the lot due to the brothers filming new footage for it.\n\n1940s studio shorts\n\nThe Miracle of Sound is in its own right a pretty quality short. It’s a charming and concise way to discuss sound technology. Not that it’s super technical or detailed, but for what it is it shines above the other studio shorts by being more focused on communicating a specific thing. The brothers are only represented by a little bit of Go West footage. It’s fun to hear things about controlling the volume of the actors’ voices. One film is noted to be “Happily Starring… Joan Crawford”.\n\n1940s miscellaneous\n\nHarpo got around doing little appearances. War Bond Rally (1943) features a few nice seconds of Harpo being silly. He’s only around briefly, and within the first few seconds. Stage Door Canteen has a fun Harpo cameo, with him doing a few of his bits (just like in the earlier “Russia” clip). The All-Star Bond Rally looks gorgeous, having a noir look. There’s also a special effect of photos of women talking that’s very convincing. No clue how they did that. Bob Hope is pretty dreadfully unfunny here, but he does get a good line roasting Bing Crosby. Crosby’s singing is also terrible, why not get anyone else to sing it? That being said, the song itself is no classic. Frank Sinatra does a great job at his. Harpo’s harp solo is beautifully melodic, well matching the tone of that dark visual aesthetic. He seems more proficient than in the Marx movies. This is possibly his greatest visually recorded solo of the 20s-40s.\n\nGroucho singing “O The Desert O The Prairie” with Carole Landis is such a fun clip. Their energy is infectious. It’s unfortunate the quality is poor and they’re both looking at scripts, though they don’t act like they’re tiredly shooting off lines. “Chico Marx (1947)” is pretty nothing. Chico’s performance of “Matilda” is sadly very short in A Year to Remember. It’s a fun piece. The audio quality also leaves something to be desired. In his apparent first television appearance, Chico does a Love Happy bit pretty much just as it’s done in the movie. In 1949 newsreel footage, he gets a laugh or two.\n\nPost-MGM trailers\n\nA Night in Casablanca’s trailer also contains spoilers for some reason. It’s odd that the trailer for a movie like Copacabana would claim to be one of the greatest comedies ever, as if anyone would actually believe that. That’d cause audiences to be annoyed when it obviously fails that incredibly high standard. It’s nice seeing some of the footage in Love Happy not on the Blu-ray. The ending of the trailer does include some personal favorite bits from the film.\n\nBill Marx’ presentation of Home Movies\n\nIt’s so special seeing video footage that pre-dates The Cocoanuts. Hopefully earlier footage is found. The best bit in this collection is some video and audio of Harpo playing the harp, sadly it’s partially interrupted by Bill. Another highlight is Harpo doing play performances. He does a bit from A Night in Casablanca with his son. You might be able to infer that my least favorite part is when Harpo appears to lift up women’s dresses in a situation where their only real recourse is to laugh it off. To give him the benefit of the doubt, that whole bit could’ve been scripted. If not, that’s extremely creepy. More home movie footage not in that specific DVD release includes more tennis with Charlie Chaplin, early color Groucho, the three brothers relaxing in costume, and more of Harpo’s Moscow harp solo.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOver the course of all this footage is a secret Harpo short. In La Fiesta de Santa Barbara, he’s vacationing and later is at a presentation in War Bond Rally. He arrives home in Harpo Marx returns from stay in Russia. Once back, he does his normal shtick in Stage Door Canteen, where he runs off, he then runs into The All-Star Bond Rally. You could say afterwards he presents scenes with his brothers from The Big Store or while “vacationing”, he got into the misadventure he did in Too Many Kisses.\n\nThe necessity of seeing these shorts can be debated. They obviously have an appeal to fans. If you’re desperate for more Marx, they’re worth a look. Sometimes you’re only getting seconds or scenes from their movies. For the record, it appears that the brothers’ only appearance in Hollywood Out-takes and Rare Footage (1983) is their lion roaring from the Opera trailer.\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets has a big issue of feeling like a compilation, lacking its own identity. We get three Roger Waters tracks that suit his style, a giant band track that destroys any possible flow, two quaint Richard Wright numbers that don’t mesh with the Waters-domination, and more strangely a Syd Barrett song tacked on at the end. This is all after last album’s Syd-domination. It’s as if Waters, Wright, and Barrett all did solo albums and one-three of each were pulled for this. Considering the various quality outtakes, they could’ve made something more consistent. In terms of the songs on their own merits, they’re a mixed bag.\n\nThe album starts strong with the funky bass opening, with the other instruments coming in for a quick freakout. David Gilmour’s vocal on “Let There Be More Light” is reasonably pleasant and imposing, Rick and Roger’s on the verses is just ridiculous, coming off a little goofy. The track overall goes in predictable directions, and seems to want to make a bolder impression than it actually can. “Remember a Day” feels like a trip to the past, like it could’ve been an outtake from their first album… and it is! It seems to strive to be a pleasant filler track, with some keyboard tapping by Richard Wright and light guitar by Syd Barrett. That particular gruesome twosome always had a way to liven up the band’s recordings, and here is no exception. Its psychedelic touches are sometimes a little silly, but this little trip is still well produced and managed.\n\n“Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun” is the Roger Waters epic. This avant-garde work has many little sounds and touches, flourishing in expressing itself through celestas and timpanis and overall feeling like a trip to the sun. “Corporal Clegg” seems like an attempt to be everything. There’s a shot at melodic-style vocals, coarser vocals, wild instrumentation, light instrumentation, not wanting to stay focused on an idea. The lyrics aren’t too bad. A favorite is, “Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream.” There’s also the infamous kazoo, which is extremely lovable due to how over the top it is. That being said, that and other developments here seem like they should be backing a song about a carnival, not an anti-war song. A contrast isn’t really painted, due to the aforementioned issue of eclecticism. That kazoo demands attention away from the lyrics or anything that might’ve been an intended focus. It’s now “the Kazoo song”.\n\n“A Saucerful of Secrets” shows the band flexing their creative muscles with a series of instrumentals that showcase various instruments and ideas, without overusing any. Rick’s keyboard is a favorite (especially at the end), as is the drums underlining a freakout. There was a thorough concept to this track. If there wasn’t, you might imagine the group throwing extra elements in in an attempt to make it “bigger”. “See-Saw” has every trope in the book for psychedelic ballads, including a singer that sounds bored out of their mind.\n\n“Jugband Blues” is the last Barrett-penned track for Floyd. It features reflexive lyrics about his disillusionment with the other bandmates. The backing track demonstrates this, with the drumming sometimes bashing away like a nervous tick. While there are many instruments awkwardly playing together, they aren’t overdone. The awkwardness serves to make this strangely captivating and melodic, and they fit with the lyrics of someone feeling slightly crazy. One highlight is when the vocal “La-la-la”s break into that collage, with that vocal eventually taking over. The brass returns, playing something that could pass as a quaint marching song, but subtly off, making it near-disturbing. They’re cut off early, being replaced with the hollow and removed voice of Syd, like he’s exhausted and upset by a lack of purpose. The lyrics as a whole paint a picture of someone trying to be normal on a surface level, but cracking under internal pressures. “And the sea isn’t green and I love the queen.”\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe difference between tracks like Remember and Sun vs. Light and See-Saw is the former has a natural chemistry between the band and instrumentation that suggests passion in the details, “Where do we put this or that element?” The others almost seem like computer generated psychedelia. Take the crammed in vocals on Light for example. The three tracks with Syd on them fare much better. This album as a whole would’ve been more cohesive with the unused Syd songs included. In fact, due to the emotional nature and unique execution of Jugband, it is for my money the greatest Pink Floyd song ever."
