        "text": "It's been difficult to get back into the swing of things, especially since we're short on funds given how last season went with Hollywood shut down. That said, we're feeling a swing of summer energy coming so... watch out? stay tuned? cross fingers? Though we reviewed quite a few indies, docs, and festival entries, we've given mainstream stuff short shrift other than the beautifully made but maddeningly soft Cruella, the wondrously exuberant In the Heights, and the utterly lame Thunder Force. We'll be shocked if a worse movie arrives this year than the latter, which is sad since it's so easy to root for both of its leading actresses in a general career sense.\n\nWithout further ado let's get started on the catch-up (and fill out that review page) with four movies you probably saw that we didn't talk about. Let's fix that in the comment section...\n\nBARB & STAR GO TO VISTA DEL MAR (Josh Greenbaum)\n\nAt 107 minutes Barb and Star comes close to understanding how fast comedies should be. Close but not quite. How can we get modern comedy directors to pick up the pace? Otherwise all the elements are here for a keeper. It's supremely silly, the actors are having a great time, and a few of the bits are inspired. My favourite elements were the brutally regimented non-sequitors of the \"discussion\" club, the evil scientist opening scene, the guffaw worthy stacked-up post-coital shot, and any time Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristen Wiig) would kind of forget everyone and everything else was around (and by extension the movie) with their endlessly verbal best friendship. Kristen Wiig is a quadruple threat here as producer/co-writer/and double-dipped in acting (hero & villain) and continues to be a national treasure. (Technically speaking this was eligible for last season's Oscars but for us it's a 2021 film. But, you know, it's a purposely very silly comedy which is Oscar's least favourite kind of movie; they even like horror movies more!) B+/B\n\nTHE CONJURING: THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT (Michael Chaves)\n\nWhile naysayers are correct that this isn't as good as the first two Conjuring films, that doesn't mean it is without good moments. The prologue is in media res tense with two inspired visual beats: those invisible claw marks in real time and the showerhead fingers. I shuddered typing both just now. The morgue scene later in the movie was just as intense with a snappy scare line \"it works both directions\", uttered with genre finesse by Vera Farmiga. As for the raison d'etre of the series, the happy working marriage of Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) is shorthand at this point which is both for better (reliable!) and worse (too easy to coast on). Three films in though we still get a kick out of Vera's stuffy ultra-modest wardrobe with high collars. Pity that the climax isn't as scary as the opening since the movie feels frontloaded as a result. C+\n\nA QUIET PLACE PART 2 (John Krasinski) Despite the fact that the first film ended on a cliff-hanger it was an incongruously complete viewing experience. In other words we would have been satisfied had no sequel followed. Despite its superfluous nature, the sequel is happily just as well acted and viscerally compelling as the original, never wasting time on exposition (the bane of so many genre movies). Krasinski's decision to begin with a flashback, not to where we left off but before the events of the first film, is smart. You're immediately thrown off balance while it's also providing you exactly what you came to see: People running from scary aliens on the rampage! You're reminded of all this family lost and how resilient they always were during a pulse-pounding action sequence. He's really quite a good action/thriller director.\n\nThe narrative weight in the sequel has shifted from the parents to the deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds, now 18) who is a freshly compelling protagonist. Cillian Murphy, who would have been the hero if this were made in earlier decades, is her dour but capable muscle on the side, a former neighbor they run into by chance while running away from certain death. It's all very swift (97 minutes!) and engaging. There's one sound-to-visual cut, which kicks off the finale, that is genuinely chilling/thrilling and the stuff mainstream movie blockbusters are made of. Still, two flaws are hard to look. First, Noah Jupe's character is saddled with some terribly unmotivated stupidity in order to provoke half of the two simultaneous climaxes. Second, the fate of Djimon Hounsou in the other half is problematic to say the least, given horror tropes. But all in all this is a very fun popcorn-devouring good time. B+"
