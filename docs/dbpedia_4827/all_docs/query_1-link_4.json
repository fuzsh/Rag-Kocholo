The 11 Aug 1923 Camera identified Leigh Smith as assistant director, R. L. Selander as camera assistant, Kathryn Craig as the script girl, and Hope Loring and Drury Lighton as the persons in charge of continuity.\n\nAccording to the 25 Aug 1923 Camera, the company had a difficult time finding a snake for a scene that required a reptile coiled up in a mailbox. Two crewmen went looking for a garter snake or black snake but came up empty after a three-day search. “Then someone remembered a Snake Drug Store down by the waterfront that had snakes in the window for a sign, and dashed down, only to find that prohibition agents had closed the store for selling moonshine. At last a revenue officer was induced to unseal the door so a snake could be borrowed, and the scene was shot.”\n\nThe 1 Sep 1923 Camera reported that after completing studio work in late Aug or early Sep, the cast and crew “set sail in a three-masted coasting schooner for two weeks at sea, to ...\n\nMore Less\n\nAn item in the 14 Jul 1923 Camera mentioned that Max Graf was set to “begin work at once on preparations for the actual shooting of the company's next picture, which will be a big sea story, with an all-star cast, and the title is ‘Half-Dollar Bill.’” A week later, the 21 Jul 1923 Camera reported that studio work on the film, still being called Half Dollar Bill (this time listed without a hyphen), was set to take place on 1 Aug 1923 at the Pacific Studios at San Mateo, CA.

The actors’ final studio scene before the journey entailed a “free-for-all fight” between the actors Mitchell Lewis, Raymond Hatton, William Carleton, George MacQuarrie, “and two or three dogs all mixed up in the fracas.”\n\nFilming ended a week earlier, the 22 Sep 1923 Camera reported, and the movie was currently being edited and titled at the Pacific Studios in San Mateo.\n\nThe 29 Dec 1923 Camera noted that the film had its world premiere at San Francisco's Warfield Theater the previous Saturday (either 15 or 22 Dec). Almost the entire cast, including Little Frankie Darrow and the dogs “Irish” and “Cameo,” were on hand. Irish was stolen a few days later during a theater appearance, but later recovered in Daly City, south of San Francisco, and returned to his master.\n\nLess\n\nMcTeague, captain of the Grampus, finds a baby boy with half of a dollar bill pinned to his shirt.
