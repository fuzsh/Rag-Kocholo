With Nilsson's signature, reference No. 176, and the insignia of photographer Walter Frederick Seely from the negative to the bottom of the image. Nilsson was born in Ystad, Sweden and emigrated at 17 to the US, where she began working as a fashion model. She made her film debut in \"Molly Pitcher\" (1911), and made several films with Kalem Studios before freelancing with Goldwyn, Famous Players, Metro, and First National. She was best known for \"Seven Keys to Baldpate\" (1917), \"Miss Nobody\" (1926), and \"The Greater Glory\" (1926). As with many of her contemporaries, her career faded with the advent of sound film. 8 x 10 inches. Very Good, with some creases at the right margin. - Original photograph of Anna Q. Nilsson, circa 1920s",
