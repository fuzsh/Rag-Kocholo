        "text": "HEMET, Calif., Feb. 12 (AP) —Anna Q. Nilsson, Swedishborn film actress, died yesterday in Hemet Convalescent Hospital, where she had been living for about a year. The hospital gave her age as 85 and said there were believed to be surviving relatives in Sweden.\n\nStarted on Stage\n\nMiss Nilsson was the first of the Swedish blondes to attain stardom in Hollywood. Yet the only one of her pictures recognized as memorable was the last—“Sunset Boulevard” (1950), in which she played herself.\n\nBorn in Ystad, Sweden, she had had stage experience before she made her bow in American films opposite Wallace Reid, in “The Love Burglar” in 1919. She “ably assist ed” him, a New York Times review said, in foiling an underworld villain played by Wallace Beery.\n\nShe appeared in two more releases that year, “Her Kingdom of Dreams” and “Soldiers of Fortune.” In 1920, William S. Hart, director as well as star of “The Toll Gate,” picked her as leading lady. The Times reviewer called her “competent,” but added that she “would approach genuineness as his heroine if she did not use a Broadway make‐up in her scenes of primitive life on the Mexican border.”\n\nAmong her four films in 1923 was “Hollywood,” one of the first satires on film life, directed by James Cruze. In 1924 she had the lead in a similar venture, “Inez of Hollywood,” in which her co‐actors included Mary Astor and Lewis Stone.\n\nHer, career suffered a brief setback when her back was injured in a riding accident late in 1925. This came a few weeks after her divorce from J. Marshall Gunnerson, a shoe manu lacturer, to whom she had been married in 1923. But she was back in form for “Midnight Lovers” (1926), in which she was paired with Lewis Stone as an aviator's bride. After a spate of pictures in 1927 and 1928, she was sidelined again when she broke a hip in a fall from a, horse.\n\nIn the all‐sound world of the nineteen‐thirties, Miss Nilsson came back in “The World, Changes,” starring Paul Muni, and “Prison Farm,” in which, she played a matron. She had al supporting role in “The Great! Man's Lady” (1942) and played Loretta Young's Swedish‐immigrant mother in the successful “The Farmer's Daughter” in 1947. Later that year she ap, peared in “Cynthia,” starring the rising teen‐age actress Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nHer farewell appearance was with Buster Keaton and other contemporaries playing themselves in cameo parts in “Sunset Boulevard.”"
