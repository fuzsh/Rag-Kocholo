All three types of bank notes circulated togetherthey can be easily identified by the different color Treasury seals and serial numbers the familiar Federal Reserve Notes are green, while the United States Note was red and the Silver Certificate was blue.  The most unusual and most rarely-seen of the three types of bank notes was the  2 United States Note.   It features a portrait of Thomas Jefferson on the front and a view of Jefferson   s home, Monticello, on the back.   The red seal is on the right side of the front.The  2 United States Note was last made in the series of 1963 and has been out of issue for more than 40 years.   It is a fascinating and seldom seen piece of American history.Over the last 60 years,red seal 2 United States Notes have disappeared from circulation.   For decades, the only bank notes made for circulation have been the Federal Reserve Notes and on the rare occasions when United States Notes turn up at banks, they are sent to the Treasury and destroyed.This  2 United States Note is in beautiful hand-selected collector condition.  Silver Certificate bank notes once circulated alongside other types of currency such as Federal Reserve Notes. Each Silver Certificate was backed by its face value in Silver Dollars or silver bullion in the United States Treasury, and holders of the notes could actually exchange them for the silver.   The last Silver Certificate ever issued was the Series of 1957  1 Silver Certificate. Unlike todays Federal Reserve Notes that have green Treasury seals and serial numbers, Silver Certificates have distinctive blue Treasury seals and blue serial numbers. Silver Certificates were last redeemable for silver until June 24, 1968, but they remain legal tender.   Most of these historic  1 Silver Certificates were worn out or destroyed in circulation half a century ago or more. If redeemed at a bank today, Silver Certificates are destroyed by the government. As a result, very few exist in any condition. Like modern  1 bills, the  1 Silver Certificate features the familiar portrait of George Washington by artist Gilbert Stuart.  Specially protected and comes with a Certificate of Authenticity.",
