        "text": "“I haven’t been nominated for too many things in my life,” said Godana. “So that felt really good. I’ve really been trying to work on my leadership skills, and to come out of my shell more. Being part of MiMS has really helped me in that area - getting out of my comfort zone and being around people. Usually, I don’t go to places where I don’t already know the people. Before, I didn’t really trust people.\n\nGrowing up, I really just learned to keep to myself because I had experiences that caused me to lose trust in people. My twin sister and I were born in a refugee camp in Nairobi, Kenya. My parents left Ethiopia before I was born because we are Oromo and we were treated poorly. I don’t even know the whole story, but I know there was civil strife and not many opportunities, and my dad had always dreamed of coming to America. He moved to Seattle not long after we were born, but my mom did not want to leave her family. My parents separated and my mom moved back to Ethiopia - but did not bring me and my sister. I think we stayed with family friends until my dad sent for us, when we were five. How did my mother let us go? Did she think we would have a better life? What was going through her mind?\n\nMy mom passed away when I was thirteen - before I ever saw her again. I have a lot of unanswered questions - questions I’ve tried hard to suppress all these years. She did send some gifts and call us sometimes - that makes me think she thought about us. Growing up with my dad, there was very little emotion. Our relationship wasn’t very open - I think it’s just how he was raised. I tried to ask my dad these questions a few times but he clearly didn’t want to talk about it, so I stopped. Maybe I didn’t even want to know the answers.\n\nOur neighborhood in Seattle was very diverse, immigrants from around the world, and I appreciate that, but my sister and I were the only Oromo in our school. I liked school up until about middle school. That’s when I started drinking and smoking weed. I had a lot of anxiety as a kid, and drinking and smoking helped. Early in high school a friend convinced me to try the cross country team, and I actually really enjoyed that for a few months. But then I got in with a bad crowd and stopped showing up. By the time I was 14-15 I just stopped coming home a lot - I would be gone for weeks at a time. I got expelled from a few schools, and by that point my dad - who worked in a laundromat for many years - had just sort of given up trying with me.\n\nBy what should’ve been my senior year in high school I had just stopped going and was working at an Autozone, and making good money, so I didn’t think I needed school. Around then I decided to leave Seattle and go to Los Angeles. I had been on a trip to California when I was younger and always thought about moving there one day. But I was arrested for a robbery soon after I got there - it’s a complicated story, but I was definitely hanging out with bad people - and I ended up in jail for six months. Jail in Southern California - it was awful.\n\nHonestly, after that point, there are a lot of blanks in my story because I am still working on saying them out loud. There have been years of jail and treatment programs. I haven’t even told a lot of my story to my sponsor - it’s an important part of the twelve steps, and I know I need to do it. And I know I will get there. But one thing I know - I am trying hard to be a totally different man.\n\nI have been here to Union Gospel Mission before, but I wasn’t ready. I have a 13 year old daughter, and when she was eight months old I got into an accident while under the influence while she was in the car. You’d have thought that would’ve done it for me, but no. I have a stepson whose own father was murdered. He calls me dad, and while I love that now, at first it was so much pressure - here is another child to fail.\n\nI wanted to sign up again this year because I made a promise to myself and my friend that I would finish the marathon. I was running already when I started with MiMS, training for Grandma's Marathon. The Run Mentors knew this and gave me training pointers, encouragement, and some took the extra time to run a few more miles with me after the team runs. Those extra motivational words of encouragement really made the difference in my training and thought process when the real day of running the marathon came. I even voiced about how I didn't have transportation or lodging set up for Grandma's and quietly behind the scenes, people took care of those blind spots for me and things got situated.\n\nRunning with MiMS has been a tremendous boost to my recovery. I remember how, at the beginning of March, I was running solo almost every day and thinking, “OMG this is such a lonely sport.” I was more used to the kind of sport that had teammates and oppositional players. In running, the opposition is oneself, the weather, the road conditions, car drivers … and loose dogs!\n\nI remember I couldn't wait for April 19, the first run with the Nokomis Team. Once I started running with MiMS, it reminded me of the days of long ago in the Army where there were 40 of us running in formation … everyone working and supporting each other to finish the run. This new-found sense of team made me want to show up every time to run with the team because not only can I draw upon the energy of the group, but give that same kind of energy back to those that need it.\n\nI’ve always wanted to be there for my friends, my family. That’s part of why I went into the military too. I was born in a war zone. I remember at the age of four, dead bodies being flown in around me. I saw death and destruction. My dad was a CIA trained member of the US Army stationed in Vietnam. I remember hearing his war stories and seeing his military scars. My dad used to have me stand at attention since I was really small.\n\nBut my father passed away when I was nine. I had to step up and help raise my brothers and sisters. I always knew I was different than the other kids. I had to grow up fast and I started rebelling against societal norms - and not in a positive way. I thought with my fists. They used to call me ‘Black Wolf’. Even though I was smart, I had a hard time fitting in and we moved often, switching schools every year.\n\nWhen I graduated high school, I married my high school sweetheart. I had an offer to attend college in La Crosse, Wisconsin but did not accept it. I was the oldest child, and I don’t think my mom really understood the offer and what it could be. A week after turning down the scholarship, I signed the papers to join the Army. For me, it was a way to take control of what I experienced as a kid. I enlisted as a medic. I knew when I joined the Army that I didn’t want to join the combat side of things - I didn’t want to cause any more death.\n\nAfter completing basic service, I attended Army Advanced Individual Training (AIT) School at Fort Sam Houston and earned an EMT certification. I was the top of my class. That experience helped me grow up, learn discipline, and respect the uniform. I watched the last three graduation groups get deployed and I was ready. There were 300 of us. We had the going to war mentality and were all going above and beyond because we were thinking, ‘He might be working on me’.\n\nI was disappointed that I didn’t get deployed to Iraq. I went to Ft. Carson to work as part of the medical detachment team. There, I trained as an air assault medic and made it my goal to learn the records of the hundreds of military service men and women serving in the engineer battalion.\n\nFor me, transitioning out of the Army, it took about six or seven months before I was able to fully incorporate back into civilian life. My challenge when I first got out was getting up early and wondering, what do I do? Looking at the uniforms that were still hung there and then looking at my civilian clothes and putting them back on. Trying to just say, “ok, that’s done”.\n\n“Why are you smiling?”\n\nOn a recent Tuesday morning run at Team Southside, this was Resident Member Bill’s response to the Question of the Day: “What question do people always ask you?”\n\n“I tell them I am smiling because I am so happy to be here. To be alive, to be free, to be with all of you. I have my whole life ahead of me.”\n\nAt age 56, it could be considered unusual to feel as though your whole life is ahead of you. But for Bill, who spent the past 16 years in prison, these past few weeks in the halfway house have been the start of a whole new life. He is, he believes, a completely different person than the man who went in nearly two decades ago. The person he is today has never been alive in this world, a whole new world to him. And that concept has him at one excited, grateful, and filled with anxiety.\n\n“I was not a good person. In fact I was a horrible human being. I walked all over people. But I also lost everyone. My parents were great, but I was adopted, and to be honest that really messed with me. I always felt … off, different. When I was a young man, just turned 18, I met my birth mother - and I also met two half-siblings, children that she kept. I knew one of them! This was extremely hard for me - yes, she told me she couldn’t afford to keep me, and it’s true they grew up much poorer than I had. But I would’ve rather had that than to be the one pushed aside, given away. I had a lot of anger about that, anger I didn’t deal with in a healthy way.\n\nI was a high school dropout, but I worked my way up to becoming a very successful businessman. I started out racing cars in my youth, and that lead to being a car salesman, and then I kept rising up. By age 32 I had started my own company. I let my ego drive me, and I made a lot of enemies. I was a jerk, and I walked all over people, and I lost my business contacts and my friends. The breaking point was when I was asked to speak at a conference, and when I got up to speak people walked out. Everyone hated me.\n\nI hesitate to share this, because I still struggle with people’s opinion of me. But I think it’s important to share, especially when it comes to mental health. I hit a low point, and I tried to commit suicide. Unfortunately, my attempt didn’t hurt just me, it hurt other people, and I can’t ever take that back. And as a result, I received a twenty year prison sentence.\n\nMy sentence began in 2007. I decided on day one to improve myself - working out, learning a trade - but the truth is I was still an asshole. I was playing tough guy. It wasn’t until 2016 that I really changed. I had a friend who was going to be singing at Christmas mass, so I decided to go - to heckle him, really. But that night at chapel something just changed inside me. I was always the guy who said “I didn’t come to prison to find God,” but that night he found me. That is when things really changed for me.\n\nA few years later, we had a chance to hear a victim’s family talk about the impact the crime had had on their lives, and when they were done speaking I asked them if there was anything someone like me could do to make things better. One of the family members told me that I could share my own story with others in hopes that it would make a difference, and at that point I decided I would do what I could to talk to as many people I could.\n\nWhen I was preparing to be released from prison I was armed with a lot of misinformation and I was prepared for the worst. The only thing you know about the outside when you are in comes from people who have left prison, and then returned. So many guys return, and their experience in the outside world wasn’t good - so they spread a lot of negativity and fear. “No one will help you out there.” You don’t hear from the guys who made it.\n\nMy experience of reentry, so far, has had its ups and downs - there are certainly challenges - but I have found that the world is less scary, and that people are more willing to help me and accept me than I anticipated. So I started a blog about my experience mainly for all the guys still inside who think the world out here will be awful to them. I want to give them hope where I didn’t have much. I will keep it real, share my struggles but also the so many wonderful, positive things I have found. I hope this blog not only gives hope to the men still in prison, but also helps people who have never been to prison better understand what reentry is like.\n\nWhat has helped my reentry the most? Faith, my mentor, Mile in My Shoes. I have embraced MiMS as my family. I couldn’t imagine doing this without you all.”\n\nPlease check out Bill’s blog on his reentry experience here and share with others - inside and out!\n\n“I had a relatively normal childhood in rural Minnesota. Close family, and I was into sports - gymnastics, track and field, soccer, all the things. But when I was 15, I started dating an older guy and sneaking around. The relationship changed a lot of things for me very quickly.\n\nMy boyfriend sold drugs, gave me alcohol - it was just a lot more than I bargained for. But I was a teenage girl in love, so I went along with it. Then one weekend, my boyfriend and his friends broke into some cabins and were caught by the police. I was along and considered an accomplice and, as a minor, I was sent to a ‘girls’ home’. I called my boyfriend and begged him to come and get me out, and he hung up on me. I was devastated. I loved him, and he made me feel worthless. That’s around when I developed an eating disorder.\n\nStrictly controlling my eating was a way to deal with my problems. I had lost control of everything else. I was defeated, and I had no self-worth. I stopped feeling hunger for what it was, I didn’t know how to enjoy food - this would go on for 15 years. When I returned home after nine months, I went back to my boyfriend, and right back into everything. I was partying and I started doing drugs. But honestly, the eating disorder was still the most detrimental to me, because it was easier to hide.\n\nI managed to graduate from high school and start college, but I was still living with my boyfriend and now we were selling drugs to other college kids. At 19, we got busted by the police - I now had a record. Two months later I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMy baby girl motivated me to be healthy, even before she was born. I broke up with her father and quit smoking, drinking, and I was actually eating regularly. For almost five years it was just me and her, making our way together.\n\nWhen she was five, I started dating someone who was addicted to painkillers. Just like an eating disorder, painkillers can provide a distraction - pushing down those feelings of not being good enough. I felt such relief the first time - I wasn’t thinking about food or eating anymore. I’d been prescribed them in the past when I got my wisdom teeth removed, so I didn’t think of them the way I did other drugs. But I had gone on a trip with my family and after a few days I got so sick, and I didn’t know why. I called my boyfriend and he said well yeah, you’re addicted to painkillers and you are withdrawing. In that moment my world shattered. Any motivation or goals pushing me forward was gone. I should’ve told my family - things could have been different. But shame keeps you quiet.\n\nFor awhile, I managed to keep my life together enough while using the painkillers. But it was to the point where I was spending almost thousands each month on painkillers, so I started selling to keep up my habit. You know, you get on this train you never meant to get on, and now you’re going 100 miles an hour and it feels like if you try to jump off you will die. My life was at the point where the pain of my reality, it seemed, outweighed the pain of living the life of an addict. When you use drugs, you’re just trying to prolong your existence at that moment. You are desperate to get out of the spot you are at. I would use [drugs], go to bed, wake up in withdrawal, and use again.\n\nI wanted to quit so badly - I moved home, away from my boyfriend, but addiction follows you everywhere you go. And the way I saw the world had changed. Being numb, pushing all of the horrible feelings down. I would struggle to stay sober, try to be happy and keep people around so I wouldn’t be alone. Not understanding what’s missing, and trying to be a mom at the same time. I lost my daughter, went back to jail, started using heroin and then meth. My world had crumbled and I couldn’t crawl out.\n\nIn 2018, I ended up getting a virus in my heart from shooting up bad meth and I was in a coma for over a month. I should’ve died. After I awoke, I couldn’t walk - and I was facing eleven felony charges. This was a new level of low. I was in the hospital for four and a half months learning how to walk again, but also shooting up [in the hospital]. I shot heroin the day I got out. But I got to the point where the drugs didn’t get me high anymore. You don’t believe the day will come, but it did. I had this revelation moment, this epiphany where God was like “Are you serious?” The next day I entered treatment.\n\nI had a lot of work to do. I had a walker, and not having my legs was a big deal. I had to prove to myself that I wasn’t going to die being out in the world. I wasn’t sure my legs would ever work again. But I did a lot of work there, physically and mentally. I started to experience things like joy. I hadn’t realized that I hadn’t had that before. I didn’t know that the eating disorder, and then the drugs, had wiped that from my life. There were relapses, and the joy was stolen for awhile. But I always knew I wanted that back.\n\nWhen I got to Teen Challenge, it took a long time to believe that people would want to be my friend. I joined Mile in My Shoes because I didn’t have a healthy relationship with working out, I was very unkind to my body and I was very unkind to myself, overall. Getting out there took a lot of self-talk and I really had to give myself a lot of grace. The mental battle with that is real, because one of the biggest triggers for women is their body. So when I was given the opportunity to do MiMS, that was a really healthy way for me to learn how to cope with things. I probably scared some of the Mentors because I would be struggling and distraught and I can remember just yelling!\n\nBy the time I was twenty I had two daughters and a son on the way, and I knew this life was not something I could continue forever. I started getting into cars - buying them at auctions, fixing them up and selling them. It wasn’t as lucrative but it as legit, and I felt good about working at something honest and getting out of my past life. I could relax a little.\n\nOne night, the brother of my girlfriend was in trouble - he’d gotten jumped and needed help. He was family, so I went to help him, and ended up fighting the guy, and unfortunately, that person unintentionally passed away.\n\nI didn’t try to fight it - I took a plea deal for 17 years, but the judge ended up giving me 30 years. I was 22 years old. I’d never been to prison. I didn’t even have a concept of what 30 years meant or what was ahead of me.\n\nGoing to prison was like growing up in the streets all over again. Inside, I was involved with a lot of the same people I’d known on the outside. Getting back in it with them, it gave me a sense of purpose and belonging. I was a frontliner again inside just like I had been on the outside. I was being tested all the time. I probably spent a total of three full years in segregation, not allowed to leave my cell for anything. I was young, I had 30 years to do which seemed like a lifetime.\n\nI did decide, though, that I was going to take this time to educate myself. I started working on my GED, and got into classes in carpentry and cabinetry, and achieved several certifications. I started cutting people’s hair, and ended up getting my barber’s certificate which was a year and a half program.\n\nIn April of this year I was released to the re-entry center to complete my last year. Being in a halfway house, in the “in between” is really difficult. You’re not in but you’re not out. And wow, a lot has changed in 20 years. Everyone is on their phones now. What is acceptable and what is not has changed so much. I see people from my old neighborhood and it motivates me to do better. So, I continue to build my new circle in regards, to moving along in life.\n\nI ran a bit in prison but always just a few miles. When I started running with this team, I was struck by the camaraderie right away. But more than that, this team gave me a sense of something new - a sense of a new way of living. For the half [marathon] I ran with Glenn and Kate, and did you know they are scientists?? And we were cool with one another and I’m like whoa, this is NOT who I would’ve been friends with before. This is completely different for me.\n\nThis past weekend, I ran a half marathon, which I would never have considered doing before. But the Mentors told me I was a strong runner, and then [fellow Resident] Robert, he was like I’m an old man, I can’t do this but you can - go out there and get it. This old guy’s telling me I gotta do it so I had to!\n\nBecause of running with Mile in My Shoes, I was able to get connected with Stilo Cutz, where I work now as a barber. When I needed the tools to start, you connected me to Small Sums to get what I needed. My life is so different now. Now I don’t stay out late because I gotta go home - I gotta work or run in the morning. It feels good to not be always looking over your shoulder.\n\nI brag about Mile in My Shoes to people. I have a 22 year old son, and I am going to get him to come to a run with me soon, to show him this different way. I know you say this organization isn’t big, but damn …. I sure feel like I’m a part of something big.”\n\nInterested in helping Byrd reach his goals? You can support him by contributing to him directly on CashApp, where his profile is: $Juniorcrich.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday morning, Team Southside Resident Member Antonyo was awarded a new running jacket as thanks for recruiting a group of new Members from inside the reentry center. After accepting the jacket, he turned to address the new runners: “It is great to see all of you new guys out here, you bring a great energy. But, I also want to see you all out here in a few weeks, a few months. Things [in your life] will start to get more difficult, and it might get harder to stick with this. If you need to take a break for a day, then take a day. Don’t take a month. This group will be the biggest support you have over the next few months. When I started a few months ago, I was walking most of the time. Now I am running most of the time. These people are here to walk with you, or do whatever you need to do. So do yourselves a favor and stick with Mile in My Shoes.”\n\nAntonyo joined Team Southside in April, and completed his first 5K at the Downtown Run Around in June. Now an Alumni, Antonyo, a natural leader, is at the heart of this team. As he grows in his own running, he’s become a guide for other new Members.\n\n“For me, growing up was rough. I had no father figure. My mom was a full-blown addict. This was the 80s and early 90s, in the middle of the crack epidemic. I have four younger siblings, I was the oldest, and we moved around alot. My mom, though, she always made sure we had what we needed - housing, clothes, food - we were never on the streets. We may not have had what we wanted, but we had what we needed. I never felt like I was on the backburner.\n\nI started selling drugs by the time I was ten. My mom knew, but she wasn’t in a position to do anything about it. I developed a reputation pretty early on - set myself apart because I was willing to do whatever it took. When you grow up with anger, you do what needs to be done without thinking about the consequences, without remorse even. I had my first gun at 13.\n\nWhen I was a young teenager, I started doing something - I started just calling people randomly in the phone book. I’d just opened a page, point to a number and call. From maybe age 12 to 17. I just needed someone to talk to, honestly, and it’s easier to talk to someone that you don’t know. People would pick up the phone and I’d just ask them if they’d mind listening to me, I needed to get some stuff off my chest. Some people would want to meet me, maybe they wanted to help, but I didn’t do that. Some would just tell me to keep my head up. Kids just need someone to listen to them. That’s why I want to work with youth - I know what would’ve helped me when I was young. My probation officers, they gave me a lot of speeches, but they never really listened.\n\nI was in and out of juvenile “camps” and programs a lot as a teenager. When I was 15, I left St. Paul and went to Peoria, IL - I ran, basically, from the cops after an incident - to where I’d discovered my dad lived. I’d had no contact with my father, but I had no place else to go. You know what my dad asked me when I got there, after all this time? He said ‘I heard you’ve been selling weed. You got some for me?’ That really hurt me.\n\nI went from selling drugs to trafficking drugs across state lines to guns. I never used drugs, except for weed - I saw what it did to my mom, aunties, even my grandma - so I did well. I didn’t have the problems that so many others have. I was selling for the rush, for the money. I was addicted to the money the way that others are addicted to the drugs. I bought all the things I didn’t have as a kid. I bought my first house at 16 - in cash, no deed, I didn’t know anything about that, I didn’t know any better.\n\nAt 18, I had my first daughter. This made me wonder if I should quit. But at this point, I was able to buy things that my family never had. What was my other option? I wouldn’t have even had the first idea how to go about getting a job. I only knew one way of life. People can go so quickly from good to bad, you know? In an instant. But it doesn’t work the other way around.\n\nAs I got older, nothing really changed - I only started to get in worse trouble. The cops knew my first and last name. My life became always having to look over my shoulder - it’s the worst feeling in the world. I had other children by now, and I’d gotten tired of being targeted. I’d done well enough, so I stopped selling anything but weed. But, the police considered me a public risk, and a high-speed chase in 2008 ended in a sentence of 7 years.\n\nI was locked up at 29 years old. The day I entered prison, I told myself I was done. When I get out, no more drugs, no more guns. I committed to becoming better, to changing my life. I had been addicted to the streets, to the lifestyle. I had respect from the streets. But now I wanted respect from myself.\n\nPrison was like walking into a whole other world. I had to do it, but I would not recommend it! Federal prison was more dangerous [than state] - we were really told right away we had to fend for ourselves. Prison was also very segregated, which was new for me. Promoting racism is a way to keep control, to keep groups pitted against one another - that way they won’t cooperate. So in prison all these years, I was only around other Blacks. People would never run together like we do here [at Mile in My Shoes] on the inside. Running with our team now gives me hope. Often I am the only Black person running in our group. But do I feel strange? No, because unlike many people out there, the people in this group are not judging me by my skin but by my character. People who care about getting to know ME, and what I think about things.\n\nMile in My Shoes has been a big change for me. Not just the running, but being around people who really don’t understand what it’s like to be me or be from where I am from - but who want to know me. I love running with the team because it’s all these professional people who care and don’t judge. I mean, what makes Run Mentors wake up in the morning and say “Let’s see if we can get some convicts out here to run with us?” Y’all treat everyone the same. You don’t just give some people hugs, you give every person hugs.\n\nAn early morning in May, Alumni Member and Team Coach Tom addressed the Members of Team Sally, gathered in a circle around him: “Remember on your run today - compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today. And this applies to running and recovery. If I start looking at others, well that’s when it gets easy to start drinking again. If I look back to a year ago, I was literally suicidal. And look where I am today. That’s big. Only compare yourself to yourself. Now let’s go!” The crowd of twenty or so gathers around him, counts down “3-2-1 Mile in My Shoes WOO!” and takes off running down 10th street towards the river.\n\nTom is an Alumni Member of Team Sally, and this spring became both a Run Mentor as well as the first MiMS Alumni Member to become a member of the “Core Team” - the leadership team that runs each team site - when he became the team coach. The group of Members he now coaches are in a very similar place to where he was one year ago, when he was a client at Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center, aka “the Sally”.\n\n“I’m a valedictorian college dropout alcoholic welder. I had a normal youth, other than that I never felt like I fit in. I was always labeled the ‘smart kid’ - I got a score of 31 on my ACTs - but I was actually a complete moron about the world, when it came to a lot of things that matter. I started drinking in high school because it helped me feel like I fit in. Because of my grades, it was always just assumed I would go to college - I never considered another option. But things got worse when I got to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was supposed to pick a major, but nothing appealed to me, nothing excited me. I hated sitting in classes, I had no direction. I was drinking maybe 12-18 beers a day, and I had started hiding my drinking at this point. Drinking culture was prevalent, but I was still worried about people knowing how much I actually drank. I started staying in my room and drinking all day, and things got so bad I eventually dropped out.\n\nMy brother was a crane operator for a company that erected grain elevators, so I went to work with him. It was very intimidating - all these big men doing a trade I knew nothing about. I was out of my comfort zone. But after a year of proving myself, they made me a foreman. While working there, I was living out of a hotel room roughly seven months a year, drinking excessively every day. I managed to function well enough, though, and this went on for about four years. I was in a relationship at that time, and we had a son named Kai. I was offered a job as a Project Manager around then, and since I wanted to be able to provide for and spend time with him, I took it even though it was an office job. Things in the relationship weren’t great, and I stupidly thought if we had a kid, or we had a house, or if I got her a car, things would be fixed. I could throw money at it, instead of dealing with the problems.\n\nIt was a big mistake. I like to move around and do shit with my hands. Around this time I switched from beer to vodka, and my relationship ended. I had another short-lived relationship - we even went to Vegas and got married - but things were going downhill fast. I told my job I needed time off to address my drinking, and that became more time. I sold my house. My marriage was over by the beginning of 2019 (4 months after getting married), I moved in with my mom, was depressed and drank all day long. I didn’t even want to get better at that point - I wanted it to end. I even bought two guns with a plan to kill myself (my mom had found the first one), but I was too afraid. I wish I could tell you I didn’t do it because of my kid but I can’t - I was just too afraid I wouldn’t do it right. I finally ended up in the hospital, where a counselor came and told me about the Sally. So I decided to go. I followed the program and the rules, but my heart wasn’t in it - I wasn’t ready. Two months after I completed, I was drinking again.\n\nI went back and tried again, but this only lasted a few months. At this point, there was a conversation about giving up the rights to my son and my brother was progressing well in life. I was jealous of his success. I left with plans to have one last hurrah before killing myself, only to find myself alone in a hotel room, drunk and miserable. I went to stay with my mom when my plan fell through. Once at my mom's, I could only fall asleep by fantasizing about ways to kill myself- that was how I found any semblance of peace. My mom finally said “This has to change, you need to do something.” So I went back to the Sally a few days before Christmas - no way was I gonna make it through Christmas at home. This time, something clicked. I got a good sponsor and started practicing gratitude. I accepted the spiritual aspect of recovery. I stopped comparing myself to others. I had been meaning to start working out but couldn’t find motivation. Then I heard about Mile in My Shoes, how a team was about to open at the Sally. I needed the external accountability, so I decided to join.\n\nI’ve listened to podcasts about ultrarunners, and the mental benefits that come from running - the mental strength to break through walls and all of that. I’d never been a runner or an athlete of any sort. Hated running with a passion! But I joined because I knew I needed the emotional benefits, and it turned out I just hated running alone - I needed other people.\n\nNot one person in the Mile in My Shoes group had a bad attitude, that’s what I recall the most about starting - everyone was so positive. When you are in a residential rehab program, it sort of feels like you are not even part of society. Getting to go out and run with “normal” people was a big deal. I would tell people about my past, about being an alcoholic, and not a single person ever responded negatively. I’ve struggled my whole life with other’s perceptions of me - I’m working on that - but I want to live an honest life. It’s helped me to be a more honest person, and now I’ve been open with others, like at my brother’s wedding, because by being open I have the potential to help others.\n\nI came to Fargo from Las Vegas, my hometown, three years ago to try and reestablish a relationship with my two little boys (now age 8 and 10) who had moved here with their mom. I’d been an absent father their whole lives, and using drugs honestly made it easy to become and then stay uninvolved. I’ve been an addict since I was a teenager. I was not on a good path in Vegas - headed towards prison or death, really - and after a brush with a jail sentence, I called my boys’ mom up and asked her if I came to Fargo, if she would help me to get back on my feet. I stole scrap metal to pay for my bus ticket to get here - I was determined to turn things around in a new place. I realize now that while I had it in my head to do right, I didn’t have the tools to do it. After just a few weeks here I was back using, and she got hooked again as well. Eventually, my boys were placed in foster care and to make a long story short, the next few years were spent getting treatment, getting the kids back, and then returning to the spiral of addiction, burglary, etc. I've had a really difficult time breaking this cycle of addiction, depression and criminal activity. This past March I violated parole and was sent to prison, and released to Centre in June of this year.\n\nWhen I was sent to prison in March, I was at a very low point. My brother had just passed away, I’d lost my kids again, and my girlfriend Jyssica was pregnant and I knew I’d not be able to be there for her or maybe even the baby. I’d ballooned to over 300 pounds, and I was not comfortable in my own skin. For awhile I simply succumbed to depression. I was afraid I might lose Jyssica and my daughter and I was determined to not let that happen - I knew I needed to do something different, but I needed help. Then, I met two guys in prison who helped me start turning things around. They worked out, and they convinced me to start, too. They dragged me out, and were supportive and encouraging - they made me feel good about who I was and wanted to become, and they didn’t let up. We measured out this tiny circle to run around - you had to run around it so many times to make even one mile, 5280 feet - like 100 times! That’s how I started running. One mile turned into two turned into three, and my weight started to come off. They serve pretty much only carbs in prison, but I would trade people anything I had for their vegetables. There was nothing to do in there but exercise, and it was the best way I could’ve spent my time.\n\nSo it was an easy decision to join Mile in My Shoes?\n\nWell, by the time the MiMS team started up at Centre, I’d been here for a few months and had more or less stopped running completely. I’d started smoking again as soon as I got out, and my health started to really backslide. I saw the fliers posted for the group, but it was my case manager Jason who convinced me to try it. So I decided to join, because running had been my getaway, my time to focus on myself.\n\nWas the team what you expected?\n\nRight away I was a bit thrown because we were told not to come out with earbuds, that the team was about talking to one another, and that made me nervous because I’d always run with music. But in prison you’re running around in tiny baby laps, no scenery or ups and downs or people. Running with MiMS out in the world is totally different. But very soon I got to know people like Dave - I told him during one of our first runs that I wanted to run a half marathon by the time my daughter was born, and he shows up at the next run with this training plan he’s written out for me. That man thought about me, and took out his time for me, and he didn’t have to. I thought, “I’m just an inmate. Just a felon.” He didn’t have to do that for me, and that made a big impression.\n\nHas being part of the team changed you?\n\nI can’t even express to you how much this has changed my life. The change in my confidence and self image - I mean, I talk better, think better, I have better hygiene, I’ve become pro-social. I’m now the supervisor at my job, and I’ve helped a MiMS teammate get a job where I work. It has really changed everything. When people see me running with MiMS, they come up to me and ask me about it. They can’t believe I was recently 300 pounds. I have gotten other people to join the group. I’ve become the person for others what those two fellow inmates were for me.\n\nWhen we are out running, people honk their horns and it feels crazy to be a part of this group doing something so good and healthy. This whole pro social thing has changed my life. Without running I would not be successful, I would not be hanging out with all these positive people. Some of these mentors know my life at this point, and they root me on. Honestly I think MiMS is going to help me get paroled sooner. I don’t really have bad days anymore. I have bad moments, but not days, thanks to running. I still have to get my boys back, and I now believe I will be successful.\n\nIs there a specific goal you are proud of achieving?\n\nI just got my ten run shirt - that was a very big deal for me, a big milestone. I actually gave it to my girlfriend to put away for me because I don’t want nothing happening to that shirt! When I get to the Thanksgiving Day race, it will be my teammates who get me across the finish line. I lean on them. The guys who finish a run first, they circle back and run me in. They come and get me. That means so much to me. I substitute MiMS for drugs now. People notice a glow about me, and it’s because of this. When I leave Centre, I will be coming back to run and this is what is going to keep me successful this time. This is the best choice I’ve ever made in my life - well, this and staying off of Facebook haha.\n\nAnything else you want to say?\n\nWill you mail me a copy of this story? I want to put it in my daughter’s baby book. I am very proud of where I am at.\n\nMeet Frizell, Team Higher Ground Minneapolis Alumni\n\nFrizell started running with Mile in My Shoes in the summer of 2019, a few months after arriving at Higher Ground Minneapolis. His consistent presence, big smile and enthusiasm for his teammates quickly made him the de-facto team captain. Since March of this year, Frizell has been residing at a hotel in Bloomington, where he and other aged 60+ Higher Ground guests were moved due to Covid-19 concerns. Frizell “sat down” with Run Mentor Laura B. in the week following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police to discuss the realities of Covid, racial injustice, and his experience with MiMS.\n\nNote: You will notice that the term “Negro” is used throughout this article, which is the term used and preferred by Frizell. Out of respect for how Frizell self-identifies and to retain the authenticity of his words, MiMS made the decision to retain his wording.\n\nLaura: This has been a really stressful week, on top of a bunch of stressful weeks with the quarantine. How are you doing?\n\nFrizell: I’m doing good. Really can’t complain. I went three miles this morning, and it was good. Moving every day keeps my blood pressure normal and that’s very good.\n\nWhere are you living?\n\nRight now I’m living at the Holiday Inn in Bloomington. I was living at the Higher Ground shelter but [because of Covid-19] they moved me to the hotel because I’m over 60 years old. I’ll tell you this, never let a crisis go to waste. They’ve got these hotels, the hospitality industry is gone, so these hotels still carry their official names but Hennepin County is housing us in the hotel. We get meals, maid service once a week, we get literally the same service that a hotel guest would receive. There are 200 rooms here and all the rooms are full.\n\nI’m out here in Bloomington so I’m good. I don’t have to worry about everything happening on the street. We’re in a very safe, secure environment. But the busses haven’t been running since [two weeks ago] Thursday and I really need to get downtown to take care of some business, so I hope they are running again soon. All the businesses that burned down on Lake St and Hiawatha and Minnehaha and Cedar, all those businesses are gone and I use that neighborhood a lot for the things I need. Two places where I do business at are going to be down permanently. All those restaurants down there, they’re gone. The pawn shop, I normally stop in down there. There was a computer there that I was going to get. I had discussed purchasing it with the manager and he said for me to wait because he was going to mark it down. And now the whole thing is gone.\n\nPlus now all those jobs at all those businesses are gone. And many of the people that work in that area are Negro, at least 40% of the people working around there. And if the small businesses aren’t hiring people, there’s no jobs. It’s those small businesses that produce the economic opportunities.\n\nI notice you don’t refer to yourself as “Black” or “African-American” which I typically hear.\n\nI use the word Negro, I don’t want to use the word Black. There are so many types of people who are classified as Black, but we are not all the same. Black people were the first to enslave other Blacks, technically, but while we are cousins, we were not the same people. I am a descendant of slaves, and I want to use a term that reflects that community. Jesse Jackson came up with the term African-American in 1988, and I don’t like that either. Of all the terms we have been called through my lifetime, Negro is more true to what we are - it comes from a Spanish word for Black but meaning “people of God” in the scripture. And if you talk to people and they tell you “people don’t use that term anymore,” you can give them my name and my phone number, I’ll be happy to set them straight!\n\nGot it! So back to the businesses that have been affected, what else has changed?\n\nA problem is that the people who patronize those businesses, they normally walk or ride the bus to get there. Now they have to go further away from home to do their shopping and business. The Target there is where a lot of people in the neighborhood get their fresh produce. They have those fruit cups and salad bowls, you could go in and get healthy food to eat. At the Target or at that Cub Foods. Now you gotta go some good distance to get fresh produce. As for me, I could go by that Target during the day and get some fresh fruit or a small salad.\n\nAnd the post office is gone. I never imagined seeing something like this.\n\nMe either. I was a child under ten during the 60’s, and I did see a lot of burned-out stuff then. But I never thought I would see it here in Minneapolis or in the state of Minnesota, or as an adult.\n\nI have degrees in German and Accounting. To my largest benefit has been studying German philosophy and history. That was my favorite, I studied all that and I learned a lot by doing that. It helped me a lot in the workplace, both philosophy and accounting. Understanding the history of the people that you’re dealing with is essential. A lot of times when I talk with people, I know more about their history than they do. And if you don’t know your history, you’re going to do what you’ve always done. Most people have the same moral and spiritual beliefs of their people had 4000 years ago. So you have to know your history in order to communicate intelligently with your fellow man. The main issue with we Negros in America is, we don’t know our history. We don’t know our history because we can study about every group on earth - their philosophers, heroes, poets, musicians - but we aren’t taught anything about our history. Our history lessons don’t start in 1492 BCE when they should, but they start on the shores of America in 1685.\n\nWhen you see the same kind of violence happening now as you remember from your childhood, what kind of memories does it bring back to you?\n\nBack then it was really more racism and discrimination based against us having any kind of success. It really set us back so we wouldn’t be able to vote, and they destroyed the Negro businesses so we wouldn’t have an economic base. Sort of Wall Street in reverse. Here in Minnesota, as always when you have this, this time the enemies of this country are the same people who were enemies during that time. They want to destroy our Negro middle class and also make sure they destroy our neighborhoods. That group does not want us to prevail at anything. The whole thing is done to destroy the middle class in America. That is the only stumbling block to slavery of the world, period. The middle class stands between the outright enslavement of the planet, right here in America. If they can do that they can simultaneously break the Negro communities too.\n\nWe never have been compensated for slavery. That’s something that’s never been done. That’s been a real problem. Officially, slavery started April 1, 1555 when Captain Sir John Hawkins sailed a ship named Jesus around the continent of Africa looking for Africans who would be sold into slavery. Initially from the 1500’s when they started trading slaves in the Caribbean, they would just bring over the men. They would work the men to death so most of us died before we were 35 years old. Then they started also bringing over women, and boys and girls. That turned into centuries of physical, psychological, mental, and spiritual trauma. That went until 1865 when the Civil War ended.\n\nWe should have had counseling starting then, to deal with and heal the trauma. Remember, we did not have any literacy. If anyone was found teaching you to read, both of you would be lynched – both the person teaching you, and the person wanting to learn to read. We didn’t know nothing about voting. We were supposed to have all the rights under the Constitution but our divine rights were not upheld. And, we were not given any tools, or any money. We couldn’t do anything further but continue to be slaves, which continued basically up until 1965. We had no spiritual training, and no training of our own history. When something happens, the way we voice our thoughts is through aggression, because we haven’t been given any other way. And that’s not productive.\n\nHere is an example of why you have to know your history, to understand what is going on now. Back in the 1930’s [during the Great Depression], they passed benefits to help people who were unemployed. But those benefits were not available to us, and we had the highest rate of unemployment in the country. We were unemployed at three times the numbers of whites but we were not allowed to even apply for those benefits. The assistance passed during the Depression, those benefits were not available to us. If you had inquired about it, you would have been lynched for your efforts. They were giving out farm loans and home loans in the 1930’s. One Negro asked for the money for his farm and the amount that he should have got was $200, they put him in jail for applying for the money.\n\nWhen we started participating in the Welfare benefits in 1965, in the truce between Dr King and President Johnson, we got all the food stamps and all the welfare that was passed back in the 1930’s, they allowed us to access to that. But they also put some restrictions on it. For a person to get the aid, there could not be an able-bodied male in the house over the age of 17. If there was any man in the house, whether it was a son, a grandson, or whoever, then that house would not qualify for aid. That was the beginning of the destruction of Negro families.\n\nRemember, technically we got the right to vote shortly after June 1, 1865 but we couldn’t vote because of poll taxes or they wouldn’t let you get to the polls, and they would lynch you for trying to vote. There was no protection. We had rights, theoretically, but they were never enforced. And it is still going on. That’s the reason for all this with George Floyd. What’s happening is the anger, the frustration, the oppression, the racism, of the last 150 years. This is coming to a head. In the instant that happens you have 150 years of history coming to a head at once.\n\nWhere do you see the way forward?\n\nThat’s a good question. There’s not going to be a shortcut. There’s not going to be a shortcut. There’s not going to be a shortcut. The problem really has to be solved by the white folks because they are the ones that started this problem by bringing us forcefully to this country and then denying us our rights. This problem does have to be addressed and one day will be addressed, or this country will fall flat.\n\nNumber one, we have to be taught our history. We need to be reintroduced to our original language. We need to be given an associate degree-level education, or at least a high school level education. We need to be taught our culture, we need to be taught our religion. And in this process we need housing and health insurance.\n\nLet’s talk about Mile in My Shoes. How did you first get involved?\n\nA friend of mine named Jesse was after me to go running for about two months. So one day I went and signed up. After that it was about two weeks before I made it to a run. I started running because I wanted to improve my health. That’s why I went into the shelter, I wanted to improve my health – my diabetes, my blood pressure. The diabetic medicine is between $600 and $800 a month. The blood pressure medicine is $200 a month. And who can afford that? When I run, I am able to control my blood pressure along with an herbal supplement well enough so I could stop taking the medicine! The running and my diet helps that. With MiMS, my numbers got consistently better. My blood sugar is under control now too. I feel better now than I have in ten years.\n\nAre you doing one of the virtual MiMS teams this summer?\n\nOh yes! I’m with Matt and Amakoe and Ashley.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to for this summer?\n\nI’m going to do the 5K race in August. I’ll be training all this month and July.\n\nYou’re training for the Downtown Run Around? What is going to be a challenge for your training this summer?\n\nI’m going to train for the 10K but I’m going to run the 5K. [laughs] I told [another Run Mentor] Ben, he does those 100-mile races and all that crap, and I told him “Ben, you can have that crap.”\n\nHave you set a special goal for the race?\n\nI’m going to try and beat my last time. It was 58 or 59 minutes. I’m going to try and do at least 45 minutes for the 5K. One good thing about running is when you drink a lot of water like I do you get all the toxins out and you can think better.\n\nI think running kind of oxygenates your brain so you can think more clearly.\n\nYes, it does. You have to be able to think and when you get your body in physical shape, you expand all your options. That’s what MiMS does. MiMS can put a person on the path to recovery, if they stick to it. Also, the running also really diminished my depression by at least 50 to 60 percent.\n\nSounds like you’re a lifelong runner now.\n\nOh, yes.\n\nYou’ve been with MiMS for awhile, and have had the chance to run quite a lot. What’s one of your moments that stands out or a favorite memory?\n\nNumber one, I ran my first official race, which is the Drumstick Dash. That was the first regulation race I ever ran. That was last year on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThat was a cold morning. What kept you going through that cold race?\n\nJenny! Jenny was my mentor.\n\nShe wasn’t going to let you quit.\n\nNo [laughs]. Quite frankly, she was not.\n\nSounds like Jenny was a good run mentor for you. What makes a good run mentor?\n\nThey realize, I am 66 years old. They are sensitive to the needs that I can’t run like a young person. They are cognizant of the fact that I need to take baby steps first and not overexert myself.\n\nThey tune into what you need?\n\nAbsolutely, yes.\n\nWhat is your other favorite memory?\n\nThe other one is the banquet. It was good getting to see all the people that were there. One of the guests, Will [Leer\"], he and his wife [Aisha Praught Leer] are elite runners from Colorado and they’re supporters of MiMS. I think that’s very noble. These are people that improve our lives every day, and we don’t even know they exist.\n\nFrizell, I wish you best of luck with your 45 minute 5K this summer. And thank you for your insights about history - it spotlights how I need to learn more about the historical context we live in and how it has shaped and defined this past few weeks’ events. I’ll be checking out some of the reading lists that have been circulating and, of course, having more conversations like these with my Mile in My Shoes teammates. “See” you in August!\n\nIn Their Own Words: Life in the Time of Corona\n\nMile in My Shoes Team VOA Southside Alumni Members share how COVID-19 has affected their work and personal lives, and discuss what life must be like for people still in prison.\n\nJoin a typical Mile in My Shoes circle-up, and you’ll find yourself arm-linked with people who do all types of work - graphic designer, baker, financial consultant, engineer, teacher, physical therapist, barber, stay-at-home parent, hospital manager, warehouse laborer, truck driver. And while the heart of MiMS is focusing on what makes us all similar, this global pandemic highlights how different our ability to “shelter in place” and “social distance” - in short, keep ourselves and our families’ safe - can be. In order to help the greater MiMS community gain a better understanding of some of the unique challenges Covid-19 has brought to men & women in reentry, MiMS’ Run Mentor Laura B spoke with five Alumni of Team Southside about how this pandemic and stay-at-home order has affected their employment, working conditions and their personal lives, as well as their thoughts on the challenges facing people currently in prison.\n\nLaura: Between the five of you, you represent manufacturing work (a foundry, a recycling plant, and food production) and the service industry (a restaurant chef and a barber). For those of you who are still working, have you been able to telecommute, or do you have to go into work?\n\nHardy: In a job like I have with physical actions, not just moving electrons, we can’t telecommute. I’m glad to be working though.\n\nJesse: It’s not like you can telecommute in to make [the food]. You’ve got to go into work. We’re doing everything we can to stay open because we don’t get paid if we shut down. And we have been slammed with orders.\n\nLaura: How has the way you work been affected?\n\nJesse: I am tired. Tired, tired, tired. My hands are extremely sore, they’re starting to crack open because it’s constant, constant hand washing and sanitizing. Any free time we have where we’re not busting our ass keeping the machines running, we’re cleaning stuff. The last couple weeks it’s been pretty harsh.\n\nAlso, even though our orders have increased, we are working with a third fewer people, so we are busy as hell. We usually have temps who help package stuff so we can keep the machines running, but we don’t have the temp service coming anymore. They were an uncontrolled variable. It’s safer not to have them there. There’s times when I’m doing five or six different jobs. It’s rough because we’ve had so much more to do because of the Corona virus, but it’s better than not working.\n\nHardy : My facility has also laid a lot of people off. They use a lot of contract temporary employees, and most of them were laid off. I’m fortunate that I’m expecting to be able to keep working, but even so my hours were cut back.\n\nLaura: Are you able to social distance where you work? Do you feel safe?\n\nJason: I work in a foundry, so due to OSHA regulations, everybody already had to wear a N95 mask regardless of Covid-19. When we’re working we pretty much stand side-by-side, but everybody is wearing earplugs, mask, safety glasses, a hat, and is fully dressed in fire-retardant clothing. For a person to pass it to someone in the foundry would be pretty tough. I don’t know what we’ll do if the foundry can’t keep getting the N95 masks though. We can not reuse the masks. I know we are struggling to get them, and if we run out I think a lot of the guys won’t be able to work.\n\nJesse: Where I work there’s a lot of tasks where we just can’t be six feet apart. When you’re in a situation like how the line is set up, there’s only so much you can do because sometimes you have to be in close quarters to get stuff to work. We try to stay as far as we can out of people’s way but there’s some spots where you just have to be a little bit closer.\n\nLaura: What about other time spent at work, are there accommodations made there?\n\nJason: In the locker room and break room, guys are sitting far apart enough to maintain distance. It’s good to see, because you get around a group of guys who are true blue collar workers and you might not think they’re paying attention [to Covid-19 safety warnings], but they are. Some people think blue collar workers in this industry either have that “we’re invincible” or “that’s never going to affect me” kind of thing, but they are conscious of it.\n\nLaura: What about the two of you who aren’t working? How are you doing?\n\nMark: I got laid off right away, on March 17. I was working as a banquet chef at a nice white tablecloth restaurant and they had to shut the doors. My wife and I have enough to live on in our savings and my wife is still employed, so we are doing ok. We have everything we need and we don’t need to buy anything new. Also I have health insurance through my wife’s job, so that’s another way I’m in a very fortunate place compared to so many people. I qualify for $150 a week for unemployment. You can’t live on that! That’s not enough to even pay rent. If I didn’t have my wife’s income then I wouldn’t be able to make it.\n\nShane: I also got laid off right away. I’m a barber and my income is now zero dollars. There is no help for me as a person with a state license to cut hair in a barber shop. I’m still paying for my license, fees, rent, taxes, but there is no unemployment available for me since I am self-employed. How can you just shut me down for no one knows how many weeks? I look at the stimulus package, but I make $1000 a week, what the hell is a $1200 check going to do for me? My mind is one-track right now, just wanting to get back to work and make money.\n\nLaura: Do you have any other income streams?\n\nShane: I’ve been doing rounds once a week to customers who I’ve been serving for years. I wear gloves and a mask, and I make a couple hundred dollars, but I put myself at risk. I’ve taken a lot of precautions [not to catch Covid-19] but I figure at 44 [years old], I’m ok.\n\nI also teach at a barber school in St Cloud, but we had to close the school for now. That means I don’t get paid, the students can’t take their tests to get their barber license, and we can’t pay our rent so it looks like we are going to lose our lease because the landlord is not going to give us any break. We just don’t have any income coming in because half the income would be tuition from the students and the other half comes from the public who come in for haircuts from the students.\n\nLaura: How else has social distancing and the shutdowns affected all of you?\n\nHardy: I use public transit [bus] getting to and from work. That has been more restricted lately – they just passed a measure limiting the bus to 10 riders at a time. On top of that the timing has switched to Saturday schedules all the time. So there are fewer buses, and fewer people allowed on the buses that do come. Depending on the route, if you can’t get on the bus the next one could be an hour later, which would seriously hinder someone trying to get to work. You can’t call your boss and say “I’m going to be late because I couldn’t get on the bus.” Now that the weather is getting a little better, I can use my bike to get to work and back but it’s about 15 miles each way. I’m glad to be off the bus even though it seems a little far on the bike.\n\nJason: With the library being closed, there goes my Internet access. I don’t have Internet at home so I have a hard time staying informed on news. I have the basic TV channels, so I try to catch news reports on TV. That’s the only thing I can do.\n\nHardy: I don’t have the Internet at home either. I have a small portable radio, so in the morning I listen to NPR to stay informed.\n\nJesse: With the library closed, I don’t have Internet either.\n\nLaura: So most of you don’t have Internet access. Without the Internet and your usual activities on pause, it must be hard to stay informed about what’s going on and to feel connected.\n\nHardy: I am just getting snippets of information from my sister. I’ve been trying to figure out the graphs and where we are in the rise of infections. I realize it’s going to get worse before we’re over the bad part.\n\nJason: The big problem with this is that I feel really isolated. I can’t do anything that I would normally be doing. I miss MiMS for that reason too, it’s my social thing that I do.\n\nShane: I feel very worked up and isolated. I’m very outgoing, and I have a job where you see a lot of people in a day. I miss the connection with MiMS while we can’t run. When I’m around MiMS my compassionate side comes out, and I’m a little bankrupt on compassion right now. It’s a really scary time. It is very emotionally exhausting, to be doing nothing.\n\nMark: Yeah, sheltering in place for me is otherwise known as hanging out at home and doing nothing. The sad reality of my life, having been incarcerated so recently for five years, is that this is very normal to me. I had a great job when I was incarcerated. I was the clerk for the laundry, doing all the paperwork. But otherwise I had nothing to do all day. The job gave me a routine to follow in the morning. I’d go to work, then I’d come back and go for a walk in the afternoon. I’ve been walking and running a lot in my neighborhood now too, but besides that I am sitting around all day doing nothing.\n\nLaura: So for people who are in prison now, what do you think it is like?\n\nMark: Right now, being incarcerated would be so scary. They’ve already had three deaths from Corona in the facility that I was at in Ohio. You have to understand the living conditions there. It’s like a big gymnasium with 20’ ceilings, and everything is concrete. Imagine an office where everyone sits in a cubicle. Except at the facility, the walls are concrete and do not go all the way to the ceiling – they are only 5’ high. So if you are sleeping on the top bunk you are at the same height as the wall, with another bunk in the other cube but right next to you. If you roll off the bunk you are going to roll right into the cube next to you. When you think about that and the conditions of how this virus is spreading, there is absolutely no way that the virus could be contained in that environment. Especially now that we know that asymptomatic carriers are out there and can spread it just as easily as someone who is exhibiting symptoms. There’s absolutely no way that the Bureau of Prisons is going to be able to prevent the spread of this. In one housing unit there could be 120 guys, and if your neighbor coughs, it’s going right into your cube. Each cube is about 8x10 and has two and sometimes three men.\n\nLaura: What do you think about the discussions to release some people early, as a way to control the spread of the virus in the prisons?\n\nShane: I’ve seen those articles. It sounds good but we’re talking about people who have no resources, no money, no jobs, no treatment, no health care. Unless they have a family or money there isn’t shit for them to come home to. That’s why I like MiMS so much, it brings people into a fold who have burnt their bridges with their family, and helps them start to rebuild. But for most of these people there’s no safety net or support to catch them or for most of them, anywhere to go.\n\nMark: I 100% agree. For people like me – who have a stable home and a support network to return to, a place to go, food in the refrigerator, a place where they can pick up where they left off – I think that’s great. The thing that concerns me is that I met a number of men who had a better life when they were inside the prison than they had outside. They were homeless, unemployed, illiterate, and worse. There were so many men that I met, that if the BOP called them into the office and said “OK, pack up your stuff, you’re leaving next week,” that would be a huge burden on these men because they have no place to go. Some of these men who are getting early released will be kicked out on the street, and I’m worried about their safety and well-being. I haven’t heard anything ensuring that once these men leave the facility, they will be taken care of in the sense of a stable place to live. I met enough men like that [when I was in prison] that the first thing I thought of when I started seeing news that people were going to be released, was that those men will be in a total panic at the thought of being released. Getting out of prison is a good thing but there’s other facets to think about.\n\nLaura: For everyone, no matter what your situation, there is so much anxiety and uncertainty right now. How do you feel about where you are now and for the future?\n\nJason: When we got notice that the foundry is an essential employer, it was a quite a weight lifted off my shoulders. I was worried that we might have to shut down, and I was concerned about missing a paycheck, and maybe even more than one, while we were closed. My thoughts go out to the people in the community who aren’t working. I worry about whether the economy will rebound, whether the local businesses will come back. It’s such a mess that I’ve never heard of. We tend to think we’re on the top of the food chain, and then something we can’t even see can actually kill us.\n\nShane: My girlfriend is an optometrist and she just got furloughed after having that job for 20 years, because she is “not essential.” How can eyeglasses not be “essential”? And who knows if their shop is even going to be a thing [after this]? The shop sells high-end eyeglass frames. Will there still be a market for them when all this dust settles? What luxury items will people still be able to afford? I put myself in a good position as a barber. A haircut is the essential luxury item, because people will figure out how to pay for a good haircut. I’m in a recession-proof industry.\n\nI have a cushion of money saved but lots of people don’t have that. It’s sink or swim for everyone. Do you sink or can you swim? What can I go without? What are my needs and wants? This is going to hugely fracture society. You thought there was a separation of “haves” and “have nots” before – it’s going to be terrible now. I don’t know what will happen if things don’t go back [to normal] soon. I’m worried anxiety among people is going to get to a blowing point. This has opened my eyes to a lot of abuses and neglect in the system. I’m also worried about how are we going to pay for all this?\n\nHardy: I get worried too, but I’m blessed and very fortunate to be in the situation I’m in. I have a full pantry, a bank account, I have work to go to, and I have friends I can contact over the phone and by text. The weather is getting better so I can get outside a little more and get exercise. I think it’s going to get worse before it gets better. I’d rather they shut things down now for a shorter time, than it be worse later and have to shut down longer to get things under control.\n\nLaura: Before we go, can you tell me anything that has uplifted you lately?\n\nHardy: I was cheered when I saw a photo Ben [MiMS Southside Core Team Mentor] posted of himself post-run in the VOA parking lot. I miss MiMS and I miss running. My pants are getting tighter so I need to get back out there. I hope to see everyone again soon and well.\n\nJesse joined Team Southside in June of 2018 after almost six years in prison. After being released from the VOA reentry center in April of 2019, Jesse continued to return each week to run with his team. He’s run nearly a dozen races with MiMS, from 5Ks to several half-marathons (City of Lakes and the Torchlight 5k are his favorites) and is looking forward to returning as soon as he can to his role of Alumni Mentor.\n\nLaura B first joined Mile in My Shoes in the summer of 2018, answering a call for mentors to help with Twin Cities Marathon distance training. Since then, Laura has become an integral part of the MiMS family, serving as the Team Southside Race Coordinator, on the MiMSies committee, and most recently as the chair of the 2020 Downtown Run Around planning committee.\n\nLaura: How long have you been with MiMS?\n\nJesse: I came in in April or May of 2018. And we are on the best MiMS team ever. Southside!\n\nLaura: Why is Southside the best team?\n\nJesse: The energy of the people. I’m an introvert and I’m not a huge people-person, but I’ve met some people that I’ll remember a long time. You meet a lot of great people there. We have a special energy and buzz going on. And we even have a lot of alumni mentors who come back to keep running.\n\nLaura: Yeah, that is one thing I like about Southside and that I’ve learned from running with the group: Sometimes I don’t even know who’s an alum and who’s a mentor. One guy showed up one time and was running with us, and I didn’t even know that he had been a Resident, I just thought he was running with us. That question didn’t even occur to me, I didn’t even think about it. We just run.\n\nJesse: When I was at the VOA, it wasn’t the hardest time of my life but it was an extremely stressful and difficult time coming out of prison and trying to adapt. Just the energy and the willingness to get out and do something that the [MiMS] group brought was great. That’s why I’m an Alumni Mentor and why I keep trying to come back. I know how bad it can be and I want to give back to these people and help them out too, the way the group helped me.\n\nLaura: What were some of the ways that MiMS helped you?\n\nJesse: It got me out and socially interactive with more people and experiencing more of the Twin Cities area. Getting to talk with actual people, not other prisoners, people with completely different backgrounds, coming from different areas of business or religion or beliefs. The fact that they all had the same high energy level.\n\nLaura: How did you decide to join the team?\n\nJesse: A few years before when I was in prison, I was already trying to lose weight and get healthy, and I started running a little bit. I got out and was in there the first week and Ben [longtime Team Southside Run Mentor] came down during my orientation. He was like, “Hey we’ve got this amazing group. We go do this run stuff.” And I thought, “You know what? That sounds like a lot of shit.” Then Ben started talking it up but the first thought I had was “That is way too much work, even though I want to get out and do stuff.” Then I thought “Screw it, I’m going to do it. This guy’s got a lot of energy, he’s so positive, I’m going to sign up.”\n\nI did and I haven’t looked back. He got me, he hooked me. I don’t always necessarily see eye to eye with him, the way he sees a lot of things, but I really respect him and enjoy talking with him and being around him. He’s a great guy. I’m glad he’s the one that came to invite me.\n\nLaura: One thing I like about the runs is getting the chance to talk to people about all different kinds of topics and I don’t always see eye to eye with them, but I’ve always learned something new about them or the world or it’s revealed to me something that I should be questioning about what I thought.\n\nJesse: There’s so many people that seem to think that “this person and you have had basically the same experiences, so you guys should understand each other.” But even if you’ve been in that person’s shoes, you still don’t. You can get a good idea but you don’t totally understand. A lot of people in MiMS can see the broader picture, or try their best to. They try not to be putting people in groups, like “these people all were in prison so they all think this way or behave this way,” they see more of the person. They see the commonalities between everyone but see us as a person.\n\nI recall things more through feelings than actual memories. I feel happiness that someone is willing to see or listen to my point of view as separate from everybody else’s. Like when you and I were at the dome in Eden Prairie with the team this winter, and we just walked and talked for awhile. You’re willing to listen and talk through things with me. Days like that make things so much better.\n\nLaura: I was wondering if you could comment, from your experience with the VOA and the prison system, what are some of the ways COVID-19 might be affecting the guys that people might not understand or realize? What are some of the concerns that they might be facing personally?\n\nJesse: It would be a lot of family things, when complete cities are shut down and you’ve only got so much contact with the outside because you can only have so many minutes a month phone-wise, that can make it incredibly hard. [While in prison] I was in more of a medical center, so we had a lot more of the people who are disabled or elderly. To me that would be extremely scary considering how quickly this stuff spreads and how negatively it affects the elderly. If you’re sitting there in prison and you’re not doing good health-wise the way it is, and the next thing you’ve got this thing blowing through. I’m sure there’s a lot of people that are expecting to die in prison because of this. That’s got to be a huge stressor.\n\nEven if you’re healthy, it can still affect you. When you’re living in a place packed with three to four people in a 10x12 room, you’re expecting to get sick. It’s WHEN, not IF. That’s got to be a shitty feeling. At least here on the outside I might be able to do something to not get sick or at least not get it for a long time. There, you know it’s coming. It’s like looking at a semi coming at you. And you can’t do anything about it. It’s a small space, you can’t separate six feet, there’s no room for it. It’s like telling sardines to move an inch apart.\n\nLaura: At the VOA, they’re not allowed to go out or have visitors, they can only go to work.\n\nIf they can’t get out to get their personal items, even something like a Q-tip is amazing. Those creature comforts like that are crazy.\n\nLaura: Those things that you need to have to take care of yourself, that we might take for granted?\n\nJesse: Nobody thinks much about a Q-tip until you don’t have one and can’t get one.\n\nI think that the VOA might be even harder because you’ve got a little bit more freedom but you’re still stuck there, you’re still looking up at that semi truck of coronavirus coming in. A lot of the times it felt worse being in the VOA than it did being in prison. I really feel bad for them [people currently in reentry] because you get resigned in prison because there’s not a lot of choices. Then you feel like being in the halfway house you would have more options. And then not having them would be hard. And even in prison on the worst days you can still go outside and do something.\n\nLaura: You’ve been facing an injury, you would much rather be running but you keep coming to MiMS even though you’re walking right now. How did you get up and come out at 7 am on that cold morning?\n\nJesse: There’s a handful of things. The motivation behind the fact that even on the worst days when I’ve felt my absolute shittiest, and I don’t want to do a damn thing, I’ve never gone out for a run and said “I wish I hadn’t done that.” I’ve always felt better after a run no matter what the weather conditions are or anything. Even those days where it’s a blizzard snowing and we went out and ran anyways – it’s great. The fact that I appreciate so much what MiMS has done for me, that there’s still people going out to run and the least I feel like I can do is go out and help and support the other people going through what I did at the halfway house. I know how much it helps. I used to run with headphones all the time and I can’t run with music anymore. Even if I’m running by myself, I have to have my headphones out and I’m listening and enjoying my situation where I’m at in life.\n\nLaura: Touching on your injury, you’ve been facing that since around August last year. You were training for the marathon and then you got plantar fasciitis. That’s an injury so many runners have faced and is so frustrating. What have you found challenging about it and what has been successful for you in dealing with it?\n\nJesse: Challenging, I’m obviously a person who sets a goal, even a small goal, and I hate not being able to complete it when I know I can. Being so close to running the marathon and not doing it was very devastating. I actually think I was so focused on the goal that I ignored the signs from my body and I hurt my foot more than plantar fasciitis.\n\nLaura: The emotional part when you’re injured is almost harder than the physical part. You’re used to keeping yourself fit and you get that satisfaction from meeting your goals, and it helps relieve stress. Have you found other ways to meet those emotional needs?\n\nJesse: It is hard. I’ve been trying to walk on Sundays. I redoubled my efforts at work. That’s about the only outlet I have right now without damaging myself more. That’s about it. I don’t have a lot of other physical outlets right now. I do have a jigsaw puzzle sitting on the table and I’ve been trying to read more.\n\nLaura: We’ve talked before about your journey, of a person who was not at the weight you wanted to be at and the challenges you faced making some changes. Would you like to talk about that?\n\nJesse: Sure, I’m proud of what I did. I had a lot of bored eating and stress eating and a sedentary lifestyle, just getting too complacent. I drank way too much, I was a pretty heavy alcoholic. And all that added up. I still worked every day, made my money, and didn’t do much else. I kept getting fatter and fatter. Surprisingly I didn’t get diabetes, but I almost wrecked my liver. All this happened and my dad died while I was waiting to get sentenced and go to prison, that was a huge stressor. Getting as heavy as I did, I started to have a lot of health problems. My feet and legs would start swelling and I was in constant pain. My joints were going to hell. I was up to 320 pounds. When I got locked up I was like, “I can’t do it anymore.” The first day where I walked one lap around the track I was so impressed with myself. It wasn’t even a third of a mile, but I was so happy that I made that one lap. I thought, “I can do this.” I always set really small goals, really realistic goals. I wasn’t like planning to drop 120 pounds and being ripped or anything like that. I was trying to take everything as realistic as I could. I thought, “I’m here for six years and I’m going to make myself better.” I followed that and slowly but surely lost a whole bunch of weight. Every pound I lost I felt a whole lot better.\n\nLaura: You said there were times you hit plateaus. How did you motivate yourself through the plateaus?\n\nJesse: I set really small goals so plateaus were never that long. There were so many people throughout my life before prison that would want something super amazingly far away and then they try to go for it and then get mad when it didn’t happen and quit. That’s the kind of person I am too, I realized that if I set a goal and didn’t reach it, that I’d be depressed and quit. So I always set super small goals so I’d keep on trying. If I was stuck at three laps around the track, my next goal would be four laps around the track. Not six because I know I can do four, I just have to push myself a little harder. I kept on going like that. I never did anything ridiculously huge. Everything was manageable, everything was reasonable. I never went on a straight diet where I said “I’m going to eat super healthy, I’m going to cut out everything.” From day one of doing all that I said, “I’m going to eat my cookies, I’m going to drink my pop. I’m going to enjoy that and I’m not going to be miserable. ” I think that’s one thing that stops a lot of people because they get miserable because they can’t have stuff they enjoy, instead of doing it in moderation.\n\nMeghan, how did you end up at Higher Ground St. Paul?\n\nDuring the four years prior to getting to HG I moved a total of 28 times. I lived all over, trying out different ways to make things work. About a year and a half ago I heard about Dorothy Day Center (now Higher Ground) but I didn’t want to accept that I was running out of options. Also I had two cats and I really didn’t want to give them up - I had one for 12 years. I moved in with my sister for awhile, but eventually I knew I had to get it together on my own - I said to myself “Meghan you’re almost 38 years old, you need to get yourself together.” So I surrendered my cats and I showed up at Higher Ground St. Paul. I had no idea how much help I would be able to get here. I really needed a foundation, a place to be grounded, and I found that here. .\n\nWhy did you decide to join Mile in My Shoes?\n\nWhen I first got to Higher Ground I was in the first floor shelter, on a mat on the floor. Then I got a bunk and a locker which made a huge difference, but I still had to be out every day at 8am and carry a lot of my stuff with me. Rachel (Alumni Member) tried to convince me to join the team at that time, but I just wasn’t ready for it. After a few months, thanks to the help of staff and my willingness to put myself out there and admit that I needed help, I got my own place up on the fourth floor. That was so exciting, I just couldn’t stop smiling. Having my own place was huge for my mental health - privacy, no cameras, space to have art supplies and express myself that way.\n\nAround that time, I started seeing two MiMS members, Terry and Steph, coming back from MiMS runs and the way they acted and talked about it really motivated me to join the team. I’ve never been a runner but I thought if they are capable of this, maybe so am I. I saw them getting so much out of it, they were always running around and so happy and moving forward. I thought “I want that. I want to be able to run - not from my problems, not from my past, but to help me deal with things and move forward.” I never saw myself as a runner but it feels so good to know that I am capable of this. It makes me realize I am capable of a lot of things.\n\nLast year, when I joined, I was struggling to come consistently - and I’m not afraid to say it was somewhat due to struggles with mental health. Terry would come to get me up and I’d say “not today.” But things have gotten better this year and I’ve been able to come almost every run! My goal was not to force myself to make it EVERY morning, but to take every morning as a new chance - I told myself “tomorrow morning I will try.” I had to keep telling myself “Dude GET UP you want to do this!” Now my ass is up at 4:30am every MiMS run morning and it’s so easy now! The team really motivates me and being capable to wake up on my own is really awesome.\n\nThe camaraderie and energy is amazing. It’s like nothing else - the best way to start your day! Running and art are my life now. And meds help, too! That has helped me able to get back consistently. I really don’t know where I would be without Terry & the rest of the MiMS team.\n\nWhat has been the best part about being part of the team?\n\nOh man - that’s a lot of things! Seeing everyone when I turn the corner onto the square in the morning. Having something to look forward to. The mentors are always asking how I am doing - you guys REALLY care and I’ve never really had that before. And I am getting in great shape! I can balance now doing quad stretches. I’m like “HEY look at me!”\n\nI’m also really close with my parents now - because I have been able to make these strides. They can’t stop telling me how proud of me they are. And I am proud of myself I can actually say that now. I love the life I have now!\n\nWhat has been the most challenging part?\n\nSometimes I struggle with comparing myself to others on the team - that was challenging. The mentors have really helped me get over that - being really positive and making a big deal out of my accomplishments. I really love the mentors.\n\nWhat is one goal you have set for yourself?\n\nThe Drumstick Dash 10K! That will be my longest race. My first 5K was Torchlight. I was super sick that day, had a bad head cold but I was like “I am going to do this.” It was a LOT of people so that was unexpected and it was a lot of process. But when the gun went off, I looked at my mentors and was like “Shit let’s do this!” My mentors Meg & Heidi supported me to much that day. It was huge to cross the finish line. I don’t even know how to describe how that felt - it was such an “OH MY GOD” moment to cross! And then I collapsed. ;-)\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\n\nI see a lot for myself in the next five years. I’ll definitely keep this running thing up - I will always come back and run with MiMS. I’d love to do art and have my own studio, and to go back to school for graphic design. I also want to DJ. I have big goals for myself, this is just the beginning.\n\nWhat has been your favorite moment with Mile in My Shoes thus far?\n\nKelly joined Mile in My Shoes in late August of 2018 and reached Alumni status less than two months later, reaching twenty runs in record time. In fact, Kelly did not miss one run during his entire season with Team VOA SS, achieving perfect attendance. He became Team Captain in October, and continues to lead the team during winter runs now that the official season has come to a close. Kelly will soon be moving out of VOA and into his own place - just down Lake Street, so he can continue to run with his team.\n\nBelow is a transcript from the speech Kelly gave at the MiMSies on December 4, 2018.\n\nI initially joined Mile in my Shoes just to keep my cardio up until I could start going to the gym again. Then after a few runs and getting to know some of the people I realized it was much bigger than that. The groups positive attitudes and willingness to treat me/us like actual people; the seed was planted.\n\nMy experiences with Mile In my shoes is only 3 months old… but what a great 3 months! I have done things in this group I never thought I could do: I ran a 6:45 mile, multiple runs of 4+ miles, ran uphill and downhill, over the river and through the woods, ran when it was raining, ran when it was sunny, ran when it was so cold my eyelashes froze to my hat, ran my first ever official timed event; the Drumstick Dash 5K on Thanksgiving and I did a crossfit workout that had me sore for 4 days. With this group I have pushed myself in ways I never thought I could. And not just physically, but also mentally and emotionally.\n\nEmotionally, I had to open up to a group of people I knew nothing about. They were a running group and that is about all I knew. But I soon realized it the same for them; They knew nothing about me, but also they are much more than just a running group. I’ve run with everyone in the group at least once and some more than once, but with every run I found myself becoming more and more comfortable until I finally told the group my love of twizzlers and confessed my not-so-ashamed to admit it love of Kelly Clarkson music.\n\nMentally, well… no one likes an alarm yelling at you at 5am. But to realise what you are about to do at 6am takes a lot of mental toughness. Especially when its cold or raining. We are all blurry eyed. The old saying “misery loves company” should almost be our morning run motto. But it is worth it every single time. Every morning when you have to crawl out of bed, lace up your running shoes and face the world makes you more prepared to face the challenges of the day.\n\nPersonally, I had to overcome some mental blocks. I’ll be the first to tell you I am not a leader. I am the guy in the back taking directions and following other people. When I was asked to take the Team Captain position I was very hesitant. “ I can’t do this” I thought to myself. But the more I thought about it the more I knew I had to do it. I had to open myself up to trying new things and pushing myself mentally. So, I did it and it has been great. It has helped me out in so many ways. To being more assertive in everyday life to being able to stand up here and give this speech. If not for the opportunity to be the Captain, I would not be standing up here tonight.\n\nAs some of the Run Mentors know, I lost my parents pretty close together. My Mother died May 6th 2018. I was 17 days from getting out of prison after doing almost 11 years and I called home one Sunday and my Father tells me my Mom died in a house fire. My initial reaction was shock. I was speechless.\n\nThe backstory with my Mom is we had a falling out back in 2013. She was still drinking after years and years of struggling to kick it. She was lying about what was going on in her life. About her health and living situations. I was 29 years old. I dealt with her stuff for so long I was fed up. I thought I need to do something drastic to pull her up. So I wrote her a long heartfelt letter. Filled with things I had been holding back for years. Hoping this was the way to break her from her funk. The letter I received back I can not repeat in this because kids may read it. I figured it was hopeless after that. My Mom always use to use the saying, “ Love you warts and all.” And some of you may be thinking how could I do this to my mother. Let me say first; I loved my Mom. With all my heart. But there comes a time when you just can’t take anymore. The Last time I saw my Mother was July 4th, 2009 at a visit in prison. Letting my Mom go like that is a decision I have to live with the rest of my life.\n\nI lost my Father shortly after I was released from prison [and staying at VOA]. Somewhere around 50 days actually. July 15th 2018. He had been battling Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for a good 10 years. Losing my Father was the hardest thing I ever went through. I would do a million years in prison just to have him back. He was the #1 supporter after my arrest. The only one who consistently came to visit me even when I got sent down to eastern Texas. I called him every Sunday. During football season we would talk trash about each other’s teams with me being a Vikings fan and him a Packers fan. I miss him like crazy and if he was still around he would have been my guest at the MiMSies. If not for him I would not have come out of prison as well as I did.\n\nI haven’t told many people this story. One Sunday in the middle of September i woke up at the halfway house, grabbed my phone and dialed my Dad’s number… only to realize after the first ring that he was not going to pick up ever again. So, what did I do? I got dressed, laced up my running shoes and ran. I only get an hour to run but I swear I ran 10 miles. I ran the 4 mile run and up and down Lake Street about 4 times. When I got done I felt I could do it all again but I also felt better. It helped me clear my head of all the pain I was experiencing at that time. It helped me heal.\n\nI know if my parents were still alive they would be extremely proud of what I have accomplished after getting out and all the goals I have achieved since joining this group.\n\nOne of my all time favorite moments with Mile in my Shoes, and life in general, is the Saturday morning run we had when it was about 8 degrees outside. Ben, Laura, Yem, and myself. We ran down to the Lock & Dam #1 on the Mississippi river. Laura talked us into running down the hill. We did and came upon this beautiful scene of fog over the river and the sun peaking just up over the trees. (show the picture if we can) I had a moment of complete happiness. All the noise in my head and all the troubles in the world disappeared for about 5 seconds. In that moment, Even though I still had a GPS monitor on my leg, I felt free. It was a moment I will never forget. Than reality punched me in the face when I remembered we had to run back up the hill. Just one of my many great experiences with Mile in My Shoes.\n\nThe goals I have accomplished with this group are vast so I will just touch on a few. My single mile time was the first goal I achieved. I had this goal when I started running back in 2015 but was never able to achieve it. I told [Run Mentor] Justin the morning of the timed mile “ I want to go as fast as possible” - anything over 7 minutes and I was going to be disappointed. So we ran. Justin is a freaking gazelle. I’m huffing and puffing at 3/4th of a mile and Justin isn’t even breathing hard. I ran a 6 minute and 45 second mile. I am very proud of that accomplishment. Running more than 4 miles. This was more of a personal goal I didn’t tell anyone about. My first Saturday run we ran 6 miles. A very windy day and a route with a bunch of hills. We got to the east side of the bridge over the Mississippi and I lost my legs. I told Jason right before we got back to the bank parking lot where I lost my legs. But I just kept pushing. Finally, my 5K time. When I first started running with the group I decided the Drumstick Dash was going to be my first event. I ran some approximate 5K’s before but nothing ever official. My goal was 23 minutes. My pacer was Whitney and she was very helpful. Telling me not to start out too quickly, which we kind of did. First mile was a 7:14. Maybe it was the cold or the excitement of the event, but my legs felt heavy and about 1.5 miles into the run I got a stitch in my side, but I couldn’t stop. Whitney would not have let me. So, I pushed through. I thought about all the runs and all the people cheering me on. I ran a 23 minute and 12 second first-ever 5K. And that was on a bad day! But this is what this group does. It makes you push yourself and achieve things you never thought you could. All of these goals would not have happened without this group.\n\nMile in My Shoes has changed my life in so many ways. The first is giving me the confidence to stand up here in front of a large group of people, most of whom I don’t know, and give this speech. Four months ago I wouldn’t do this. It has giving me the courage to be a leader. To challenge myself and push my limits. This group has changed me into the person I am today, a better (and faster) person.\n\nWhile all of the Mile in my Shoes members are important, there are a few I want to thank personally.\n\nFirst, Whitney: Thank you for pacing me at the Drumstick Dash. If not for you I would have stopped and failed to achieve my goal. Whitney was actually the person who asked if I wanted to give this speech. I was thinking of asking anyway so it all kind of worked out in the end. Thank you Whitney.\n\nBen: You are inspiring. You came from dark times and now bring so much light to this world. You inspire, you challenge, and you embrace everyone around you. I am so happy I get to run with you and share in these experiences with you. Thank you Ben.\n\nFinally, Mishka. Without you none of this happens. You guys have created something amazing. You have helped so many people achieve goals they never thought possible and pushed so many people to do things they never thought they could do. I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say; Thank you!\n\nWith that I will close.. It has been an honor running with this group and I look forward to years of more running, hundreds of goals accomplished, and thousands of lives changed. Thank you.\n\nMeet Earl, Alumni Member Team Higher Ground Minneapolis\n\nJennifer (pictured at right above) was one of the first VOA Reentry Center residents in Roseville to sign up for Mile in My Shoes, and several of her fellow members credit her encouragement as the reason they joined the team. The team's Resident Manager, Mike J, says of Jennifer: \"She’s our only resident to have been at every run, and comes out that door every morning with a smile. She’s come up with thoughtful questions of the day on the spot, encouraged several of her fellow residents to join MiMS, and fights for advocacy within the community. We have 15 residents, but dunno what we’d do without Jen.\" Find out more about Jennifer by reading our interview with her!\n\nHow did you get to VOA?\n\nWhere do I even start... from childhood?! LOL! To make a long story short: 17+ years of trauma, drug abuse, and a major alcohol problem is what led me to work release at the VOA. As a result of trauma endured at an early age, I never knew or was taught a healthy way to deal with my emotions and trauma.\n\nThe only way I knew how to cope with everything I buried deep inside was to drink and use [drugs]. After a ten-year relationship fell apart I started drinking very heavily - since I was a bartender this was an easy thing to do. I didn't know how to be alone after [the breakup] and I got into an extremely unhealthy rebound relationship that was so mentally, verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive I couldn't find a way out.\n\nI know what you are thinking...why would you stay? Well, when your self-esteem is so low and you don't have a relationship with God you truly think and feel that this is as good as it will ever be...
