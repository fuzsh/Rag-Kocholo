Her superb voice and supreme stage presence were praised by critics and audiences alike, bringing her international recognition as the world’s leading dramatic soprano and a legendary interpreter of especially Wagner, Strauss and Puccini.  Birgit Nilsson made her operatic […]",

        "text": "On 9 October 1946, Birgit made her opera debut at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm in the role of Agathe in Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz. It was an unexpected replacement with only three days notice. To learn an entire part in three days was not easy but Birgit had a talent for learning, with absolute pitch and a good visual memory. Despite her nervousness, little time for preparation and lack of encouragement from the conductor, she received brilliant reviews.\n\n“It was well advised to allow the young singer Birgit Nilsson from Scania to make her debut as Agathe in Der Freischütz on Wednesday … Birgit Nilsson performed with an assurance and artistic balance one does not expect of a debutante. She has a fresh Nordic resonance, a clear top and a fine mezzo timbre in the low voice indicating a dramatic soprano. It is not often that a beautiful voice is accompanied by intelligence but such depth of expression and musical phrasing such as Birgit Nilsson’s must come from within; it cannot be learned.” – Ingmar Bengtsson, Svenska Dagbladet, October 10, 1946.\n\nIrrespective of critical acclaim, the head of the Opera was still not convinced of Birgit’s talent. She performed Agathe just three times before the original singer returned and it took another year before she was given a second chance.\n\nIn October 1947, Birgit was once again asked to replace an ailing singer at short notice as Lady Macbeth, on the invitation of conductor, Fritz Busch. The performance was a success and received brilliant reviews. ”It was a fine role, this Lady, and I longed for every performance like a child does for Christmas”, said Birgit. Lady Macbeth became Birgit Nilsson’s breakthrough.\n\nThe trajectory of Birgit Nilsson’s career gained speed as she became the star performer of the Royal Swedish Opera. Her first operatic appearance abroad came in 1951 when she performed Elettra in Mozart’s Idomeneo at Glyndebourne.\n\nHer debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1954 was a turning point; she would be a regular performer there for more than 25 years. It was followed by Elsa in Wagner‘s Lohengrin at the Bayreuth Festival in 1954, then her first Brünnhilde in a complete Ring cycle at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1955.\n\nIn 1958 she sang the title role of Puccini’s Turandot at the season opening at La Scala in Milan, making history as the first non-Italian singer to be given such an honour.\n\nIn 1959 she made front page news on the New York Times with her performance of Isolde at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\nThroughout the 1960’s and 70’s Birgit Nilsson performed at all the major opera houses and was heralded the world over. Her career lasted almost forty years. For some twenty-five years – from the late Fifities to the early Eighties – she was the dominant force in the dramatic / heroic soprano repertoire and undisputed “Queen of Wagnerians” of her generation, one of the all-time Greats in the history of opera.\n\nArguably the last of the “true” Wagnerians, she was by no means limited to Wagner. Her Isolde and Brünnhilde together with Salome, Elektra, Dyer’s Wife and Turandot were often collectively referred to as the “Nilsson repertoire”.\n\nDuring the course of her career, Birgit Nilsson had almost 30 roles in her repertoire. Some of her most famous were Wagner’s Isolde and Brünnhilde, Strauss’ Elektra and Salome, Puccini’s Turandot and Tosca, and Verdi’s Lady Macbeth.\n\nShe also created strong interpretations as Aida and Feldmarschallin in Der Rosenkavalier and her repertoire additionally included roles ranging from Donna Anna (Don Giovanni), Lisa (Pique Dame) and Judith (Duke Bluebeard’s Castle) to contemporary works such as Penelope in Liebermann’s opera of the same name.\n\nBirgit Nilsson made almost all of her role debuts at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. Exceptions were Elettra in Mozart’s Idomeneo, Leonore in Beethoven’s Fidelio and Amelia in Verdi’s Un ballo in maschera. Her debut role was Agathe in Der Freischütz in 1946 and her last new role was Die Färberin in Die Frau ohne Schatten 1975.\n\nHer final opera performance was in Frankfurt in 1982 in the role of Elektra and her last public concert followed two years later. Neither occasions were marked by official farewell celebrations as, in her typically understated way, Birgit Nilsson did not tell anyone it was her final performance until after she had left the stage.\n\nFollowing her 1953 Stockholm role debut, Birgit Nilsson performed Isolde 208 times on stage – including 35 times at Bayreuth, 33 at the New York Metropolitan Opera, 31 at the Vienna State Opera and 25 at the Royal Swedish Opera.\n\nShe considered Isolde to be one of the most complex and demanding characters to perform in the operatic literature and the one that was the most dramatically varied. “You are never finished with Isolde” she said, noting that there were always different dimensions to discover with each new performance.\n\nBirgit Nilsson first performed Isolde internationally in 1954 at the Basel Opera and Vienna State Opera, followed one year later by her debut at Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. It was also the role in which she made her debut in a new production at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959. The opening night became a high point in her career and featured on the front page of the New York Times: ”the Swedish soprano assumed one of the most demanding roles in the repertory and charged it with power and exaltation. With a voice of extraordinary size, suppleness and brilliance, she dominated the stage and the performance. Isolde’s fury and Isolde’s passion were as consuming as cataclysms of nature.”\n\nReviewing her performance in another new production of Tristan und Isolde in 1971, the New York Times commented “Empires can rise and fall, but not Miss Nilsson. She is a constant, the empress in her field.”\n\nBirgit Nilsson was one of only three artists in the history of the Metropolitan Opera to have two new productions of the same work especially mounted for her.\n\n”Mild und leise” from Tristan und Isolde recorded at the Festival d’Orange in 1973. Conductor: Karl Böhm\n\nhttps://birgitnilsson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Track-11-Mild-und-Leise.mp3\n\nIn 1954 Birgit Nilsson sang her first Salome at the Royal Swedish Opera and the success was sensational. In her memoirs she recalls “Salome mania was rampant in Stockholm. At the opera the rarely seen “Sold Out” light was switched on for every performance. Myrstedts Carpet Corner christened a new rug “Salome” which sold like hot cakes.”\n\nOffers flooded in and Birgit Nilsson went on to perform Salome in many of the international opera houses including Munich, Milan and Vienna. It was the only role she actually ever requested to sing, following Rudolf Bing’s offer that she choose a role for the Metropolitan in 1965. Karl Böhm conducted and it became a legendary New York performance.\n\n“Despite forebodings in some minds, including mine, that our leading Brünnhilde might not make the ideal Salome, Birgit Nilsson’s appearance in the title role of Richard Strauss’s shocker at the Metropolitan was a total triumph. I have never heard the role so magnificently sung. What surprised me, though, was that I have seldom seen it so magnificently acted … As for the famous Dance of the Seven Veils, it was done as tastefully and convincingly as circumstances permitted. After all, how many full-voiced dramatic sopranos have really brought off this dance in such a way as to give the illusion of teen-age agility? – New Yorker, 1965\n\nBirgit wrote ”When I finally had, so to speak, Salome ’under my skin’ she became one of my favorite roles. It is not as long as Elektra and perhaps not as strenuous, as far as singing is concerned. But on the other hand Salome has to perform the Dance of the Seven Veils.”\n\n“Ah, ich habe Deinen Mund geküsst …” from Salome recorded at the New York, Metropolitan Opera in 1965. Conductor: Karl Böhm\n\nhttps://birgitnilsson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CD-12-Track-10-Ich-habe-Deinen-Mund-gekusst.mp3\n\nBirgit Nilsson’s debut in the title role of Verdi’s opera in 1947 at the Royal Swedish Opera was her breakthrough moment. Reviewing the performance the Svenska Dagbladet commented “to awaken one day and be famous is a fortune given to very few … the young singer can without exaggeration, include herself in this select group as the Friday newspapers have simply showered her with praise on her debut as Lady Macbeth.”\n\n“I myself was delighted to be unanimously acclaimed in the next day’s newspapers” wrote Birgit in her memoirs. “The only negative thing written was that I had too beautiful a voice for Verdi’s ideal of Lady Macbeth … Had Verdi for one moment truly desired the singer to have a character voice, without cultivation, he would surely have written different music for her. In fact the role is one of the most diva-demanding in all Italian opera. It requires a beautiful voice with vocal refinement, one that cannot devolve into a raw devil’s voice.”\n\nNoted Italian music critic, Elvio Giudici, paid tribute to Birgit Nilsson’s characterisation of this role in Birgit Nilsson 100, An Homage: “Lady Macbeth, in my opinion, remained one of Birgit Nilsson’s greatest masterpieces …. the tremendous voice of Nilsson produced sounds of a spectacular facility and clarity, both aimed at an expressive nuance. She knew Lady Macbeth well from other places, having tackled her since 1948 in Stockholm under the direction of Busch, but having thoroughly rethought her specifically for the Scala engagement, which would be followed barely a month after by one in New York. Hence the precise articulation; an ability to communicate the sense of each phrase through the most nuanced interplay of dynamics and intensity and a commendable job with Italian diction, all things that precede a palette of colour and accents.”\n\n1946 – Debut Royal Opera Stockholm as Agathe in Der Freischütz / conductor L.
