If you have any of these half dollar silver coins their value could be thousands of dollars.\n\nAt Coinfully we are big fans of early silver half dollars and want to share our enthusiasm with you.\n\nIf you have any silver half dollars in your collection and are curious about their value, reach out to us for afree coin appraisal on any silver half dollar you have.\n\nYou can also download our free instant value guide and explore for yourself as to whether you might be sitting on some serious value in your silver half dollars.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at our top ten silver fifty cent pieces struck before 1916.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1796 and 1797 Silver Half Dollars\n\nThe honor of the single rarest years for half silver dollars produced at the Philadelphia Mint goes to the 1796 and 1797 issues.\n\nThere are two varieties of 1796: 15 stars and the rarer 16 stars.\n\nWhile all 1797 silver half dollars show 15 stars on the obverse. Between the two years, the mint produced less than 4,000. An average quality piece could be worth as much as $50,000.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1796 and 1797 Silver Half Dollars\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1794 Half Silver Dollar\n\nThe 1794 Half Silver Dollar is the very first year of issue for a fifty cent coin (230 years old in 2024 and counting!).\n\nSlightly over 23,000 were made and while not all that scarce in the very low grades (i.e., Poor to Fine), this is a truly rare coin in any grade higher than AU50.\n\nA price record for this date was set in 2023 when the finest known sold for $1,800,000.\n\nEven a pretty rough low grade 1794 is worth at least $1,000-2,000+ so make sure to let our expert numismatics buyers know if you have any in you collection. If a family member passed on a collection with silver half dollars, we’re happy to give you some price options for your inherited coin collection.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1794 Half Silver Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1838-O Half Dollar\n\nSilver half dollar researchers believe that a total of 20 coins dated 1838-O were made. These silver half dollars were distributed to VIP’s and dignitaries in honor of the opening of the new mint in New Orleans.\n\nAll were made as Proof or Specimen coins and today around half of the original mintage has been accounted for.\n\nThe last example to sell at auction brought slightly over $500,000. This silver half dollar can certainly rightfully claim its long-held status as a Classic Rarity.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1838-O Half Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1853-O No Arrows Silver Half Dollar\n\nDue to huge discoveries of precious metals in the American West and a large rise in the prices of silver and gold, the weight of the silver half dollar was reduced in 1853 from 13.36 grams to 12.44 grams.\n\nTo distinguish these new coins from the old, they placed Arrows at the date (in both 1853 and 1854) and Rays around the eagle (in 1853 only). Several coins were struck using the old design, but no one knows why.\n\nToday these are among the rarest silver half dollars of any type produced in the US. There are just four known and you own the fifth, you can expect us to write you a fat six-figure check!\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1853-O No Arrows Silver Half Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1870-CC\n\nThe 1870-CC half dollar is very scarce in all grades with most of the existing coins showing considerable wear.\n\nThe Carson City mint opened in 1870 and four silver denominations were produced: twenty cent pieces, quarters, half dollars, and silver dollars. If you own a lower grade coin, it is likely valued in the $2,500-5,000 range. If your coin is approaching the Uncirculated level, it could be worth $50,000 or more.\n\nThe current record price for an 1870-CC half dollar is $172,500 for a coin graded MS62.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1870-CC\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1878-S Silver Half Dollar\n\nThe 1878-S silver half dollars were an afterthought with only 12,000 made as focus in 1878 began to shift towards the now collectable Morgan Silver Dollars.\n\nIt is believed that around 50-60 are known today and there is a possibility you might have one. (Check your coin carefully as the mint mark on the reverse is TINY).\n\nLow grade coins are currently selling in the $30,000+ range while the single finest known (graded MS66 by PCGS) brought a strong $288,000 at an auction in 2020.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1878-S Silver Half Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1892-O Micro O Half Dollar\n\nA small number of 1892-O half dollars were made which used a mint mark punch from the dime instead of from the half dollar.\n\nYou’ll have to look very carefully to see it (over the right side of the D in DOLLAR) but it should be visible even on lower grade coins. Values range from around $1,500 to over $100,000 so this is an issue where condition is extremely important.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1892-O Micro O Half Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1873 Open 3 Half Silver Dollar\n\nThe very rare 1873 Open 3 silver half dollar is identified by the balls of the 3 looking more more spread apart.\n\nNearly every 1873 Arrows silver half dollar has a Close 3 in the date. This is distinguishable by this digit having an appearance more like an 8 than a 3.\n\nThe Open 3 is easy to miss but your Coinfully buyer will let you know if you’ve hit the jackpot with your coin. We’ll write you a check for $3,000+ for a decent Extremely Fine coin and if you have a coin that we feel is close to MS60, you can expect a check for at least $15,000-20,000.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1873 Open 3 Half Silver Dollar\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1817/4 Half Dollars\n\nOnly about a dozen or so 1817/4 silver half dollars are known, making them many times rarer than the well-known 1815/2 half dollars mentioned below.\n\nThe single finest known 1817/4 half dollar, graded AU53 by PCGS, sold for $359,000 back in 2009. It is interesting that a few of these have been discovered by non-collectors who were given a coin collection by their parents or grandparents while another was found in a bed of dirt when a garden was being excavated.\n\nIf you have a genuine 1817/4 half dollar you can expect Coinfully to write you a six-figure check for your numismatic treasure.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1817/4 Half Dollars\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\n1815 Silver Half Dollars\n\nThough made in vast quantities, the single rarest Capped Bust silver half dollar is the coveted 1815.\n\nA lower grade 1815 half dollar will probably net you around $1,000-2,000 while an Uncirculated example could be worth as much as $100,000+.\n\nIt is interesting to note that all silver half dollars dated 1815 are actually 1815/2 overdates which is the result of a shortage of new dies at the Mint in 1815 due to war-time conditions.\n\nQuick Breakdown: 1815 Silver Half Dollars\n\nImage Credit: Professional Coin Grading Service\n\nTypes of Pre-1916 Silver Half Dollars\n\nThere are several different types of silver half dollars in the over one hundred years between 1794 and 1916. All with their own value and history.\n\nPre-1916 Silver Half Dollar Names and Years Minted\n\nBust: 1796-1839\n\nDraped Bust: 1796-1807\n\nCapped Bust: 1807-1839\n\nSeated: 1839-1891\n\nBarber: 1892-1915\n\nAll the names of these silver half dollars refer to the design on the face sides of the coins.\n\nMints in the United States of America also used the same coin designs as the silver half dollar coins on the silver half dimes, dimes, quarters, and dollar coins (until replaced by the Morgan Silver Dollar).\n\nThe value of some of the other coins with the same designs are worth a lot more than their face value. For example, from the same time and mint, a silver dime’s value could exceed $100.\n\nSilver Half Dollar Mints Pre-1916\n\nBoth Draped and Capped Bust silver half dollars were exclusively minted in Philadelphia\n\nHowever, 20 Capped Bust Proofs were minted in New Orleans to honor the opening of the new mint\n\nSeated Liberty silver half dollars were minted in Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Carson City\n\nBarber silver half dollars were minted in New Orleans, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Denver\n\nTo tell which United States Mint your silver half dollar came from, look for these letters on the tail side of the coin:\n\nCC: Carson City Mint\n\nD: Denver Mint\n\nO: New Orleans Mint\n\nS: San Francisco Mint\n\nCoins minted in Philadelphia do not have any mint marks\n\nSeated Liberty’s mint mark is below the olive branch in the eagle’s talons.\n\nThe Baber silver half dollar mint mark is located underneath the heraldic eagle’s tail.\n\nSince the Bust silver half dollars were minted in Philadelphia, you do not need to look for a mint mark on either side of the coin. However, if you have one of the 20 proof coins from New Orleans, you can see an “O” on the head side of the coin above the year minted.\n\nHow Much Silver is in a Silver Half Dollar?\n\nHalf dollar coin’s silver percentage depends on the year it was minted.\n\nBetween 1794 and 1839, the Bust silver half dollars contained 89.24% silver. Starting with the Seated and continuing with the Barber, silver half dollars were made of 90% silver.\n\nThe silver in half dollars stayed at 90% from 1839 to 1965 when it was dropped to 40% silver and became copper nickel clad.\n\nHow Much is a Silver Half Dollar Worth?\n\nYour silver fifty cent piece’s value is in its condition.\n\nWhen it comes to the worth of any coin how it looks significantly affects its price. Silver half dollars prices and coins are no different.\n\nBeing 230 years old, how silver half dollars look and feel after having been circulated coins adds to their value.\n\nIf you are not sure what condition your silver half dollars are in consider getting it graded or taking it to an expert appraiser to get an idea and see how much it is worth.\n\nWhat If My Silver Half Dollar Has a Different Face?\n\nSilver half dollars minted after 1915 do have different faces than the ones listed.\n\nIf you have any Walking Liberty half dollars, Franklin half dollars, or Kennedy half dollars they were minted after the coins on this list. But that does not mean that they do not have value, hang on to those coins.\n\nIf you are curious about the price of your post 1915 silver half dollars or want to check on the price of any pre 1916 silver fifty cent coins that you own, reach out for a free at-home or online appraisal from our experts.\n\nIf you end up wanting to sell your coins to us, it’s an easy and straightforward process.\n\nOtherwise, we hope you found this article valuable and informative!"
