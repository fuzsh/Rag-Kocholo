        "text": "More: Fred Hartsook (1876–1930)\n\nFred Hartsook was an American photographer born in Indiana in 1876. He became interested in photography at a young age and began working as a professional photographer in his early twenties. Hartsook was known for his portraits of prominent people, including politicians, business leaders and celebrities. Hartsook's work was characterised by his ability to capture the essence of his subjects. He used natural light and simple backgrounds to create portraits that were both elegant and intimate. His photographs were published in numerous magazines and newspapers, including Vanity Fair, Collier's Weekly and The New York Times. In addition to his portrait work, Hartsook was also an accomplished landscape photographer. He travelled extensively throughout the United States, capturing the beauty of the country's natural landscapes. His photographs were exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the country. Hartsook died in 1930 at the age of 54. Despite his relatively short career, he left a legacy of exceptional photography that continues to inspire and influence photographers today."
