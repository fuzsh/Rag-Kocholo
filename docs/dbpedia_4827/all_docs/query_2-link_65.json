        "text": "A little extra cash always comes in handy and some lucky people could be sitting on a small fortune without even realizing it. Coin and currency collectors in North America are willing to pay up to $150,000 for a rare $1 bill which features a printing error. A batch of dollar bills with errors came off the printing presses in 2014 and again in 2016 - on both occasions, the mistake went unnoticed at the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the notes went into circulation.\n\nHow many $1 bills worth $150,000 are currently in circulation?\n\nAccording to information gathered by TyC Sports, there are approximately 6.4 million dollar bills which were issued with duplicate serial numbers and now avid currency collectors are seeking matching pairs.\n\nThe first batch of dollar bills with the serial number error was issued by the federal bank in New York state in 2014. Curiously, another identical run with the same error was issued by the Washington DC facility two years later.\n\n$1 bills with errors which sell for $150,000: How do I know if I have one?\n\nUp until now, only nine pairs of dollar bills with matching serial numbers have turned up which means that there must be millions still in circulation in the United States and, probably all over the world too.\n\nTo find out whether you have a $1 bill with the printing errors from 2014 and 2016, you need to closely look for several key characteristics. First of all, if it is a 2013 Series note, it must feature the large stamp of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with a capital ‘B’ in the centre - this can be found on the left side of the note. Secondly, the serial number (printed in green, which appears underneath the Federal Reserve Bank stamp) must end with a small, five-pointed star ★. And lastly, the serial numbers to look out for are from B00000001★ to B00250000★ and from B03200001★ to B09600000★."
