        "text": "In November, the United States commemorated the 60th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, who was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. One of the smaller impacts of JFK’s assassination is that the government put his image on half dollar coins beginning in 1964. Those coins permanently replaced the Benjamin Franklin 50-cent pieces, thus limiting the supply of the Franklin half dollars and contributing to current values that run into six figures.\n\n$2,000 Quarter?

They were the last U.S. half dollar series struck entirely in 90% silver. The Kennedy half dollars that followed were made as 90% silver circulating coins for one year only. Beginning in 1965, the JFK coins were converted to cheaper copper-silver clad. Six years later, they switched again to copper-nickel clad.\n\nAs for Benjamin Franklin — he was a humble sort who may not have wanted to have his image on a U.S. coin, according to the CoinValueChecker site. But a 20th century director of the U.S. Mint was a Franklin admirer and lobbied to have him on the 50-cent coin.\n\nYour $20 Bill May Be Worth More Than You Think: How To Look Up the Serial Number\n\nMost Franklin Half Dollars Aren’t Worth Big Bucks\n\nThere aren’t many Franklin half dollars that are considered rare or even scarce by collectors — but as Gainesville Coins noted, there are several “conditional” rarities and varieties that are worth searching out. These can range in value from a few hundred dollars each to several thousand dollars and more. One of the highest prices paid came in 2018, when a 1958 Full Bell Line Franklin half dollar sold for $129,500.\n\nHere are 13 Franklin half dollars that have sold for at least five figures, according to CoinValueChecker.\n\n1961 Proof DDR Franklin Half Dollar: $14,400.\n\n1963 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $85,188.\n\n1953-S Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $69,000.\n\n1958 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $129,250.\n\n1949-S Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $31,725.\n\n1948 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $28,750.\n\n1955 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $14,100.\n\n1952 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $42,300.\n\n1951-S Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $30,550.\n\n1950 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $39,600.\n\n1960 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $28,200.\n\n1954-D Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $21,275.\n\n1962 Full Bell Line Franklin Half Dollar: $17,825.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n10 Things Boomers Should Consider Selling in Retirement\n\n11 Uncommon Investments That Can Actually Make You A Lot of Money\n\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nHow to Earn an Extra $500 a Year on Your Savings"
