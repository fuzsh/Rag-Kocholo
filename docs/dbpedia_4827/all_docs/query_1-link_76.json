        "text": "Buffalo News Preview of HUNDRED DAYS\n\nPosted on July 15, 2024\n\nIn MusicalFare's 'Hundred Days,' Love Lives Imitate Art for Real-life Acting Couple by Melinda Miller\n\n(Buffalo News, 7/11/24)\n\nThe musical “Hundred Days,” making its Western New York premiere at MusicalFare Theatre, is the story of a pair of married musicians, named Abigail and Shaun. The music is a rich folk-rock Celtic-y mix, as though Simon & Garfunkel are playing with Mumford & Sons.\n\n“Hundred Days” also is the creation of a pair of real-life married musicians named Abigail and Shaun, who performed in the original show, which became a bit of a hit a few years ago.\n\nThe question is, can “Hundred Days,” a partially fictionalized version of the love story of the real Abigail and Shaun Bengson, maintain its emotional spark without the Bengsons at its center? What could compare to the energy of a husband and wife, together on stage, singing their way through the highs and lows and secrets of a genuine relationship?\n\nMusicalFare may have a solution with the performers playing its versions of Abigail and Shaun – Samantha Sugarman and Nick Stevens.\n\nSugarman and Stevens are not married in real life, but we are calling it “close enough”: Their wedding will be exactly three weeks after the show ends its run on Aug. 4.\n\nMusicalFare Executive Director Randy Kramer said that Susan Drozd, who directs “Hundred Days,” called the unplanned casting coup “kismet.” Kismet: Fate, or destiny; a power that determines future events.\n\nProducers weren’t expecting to find a local theater couple to play the show’s fictional couple; in fact, they weren’t even trying. So, how did the soon-to-be newlyweds wind up here?\n\n“Randy reached out to me first about the show,” said Stevens, a known quantity for having performed with MusicalFare before, most recently in “Once.” Even so, it didn’t work. “I thanked him, but I thought I was just too busy.”\n\nHowever, Drozd later encouraged Stevens to reconsider. “That’s when I started listening to (the soundtrack) at home,” he said. “I was playing it around the house, and that’s how Sam kind of got into it. She liked it.”\n\nThe third time MusicalFare called, Stevens said “Yes!” He also suggested they consider his fiancée, Samantha, for Abigail. A singer-songwriter-musician herself, he said, “Sam had a feel for the role already.”\n\nThey auditioned together with scenes from the show, and in a key scene the chemistry was obvious. As Stevens observed, “It went well.”\n\n“Stories don’t often come around again in life, especially multiple times,” Stevens said, and Sugarman continues “so when it does, it’s usually a sign!”\n\nLife is not totally imitating art here. The characters in the show, like the real-life Bengsons, meet, fall in love and marry within three weeks. Stevens and Sugarman said they have been together more than seven years, and engaged for more than a year. (Wedding prep is part of the “busy” that initially led Stevens to turn down the show at first.)\n\nHowever, both couples did meet sort of artistically. According to their press, the Bengsons met during a band get-together, hit it off and immediately started seeing each other.\n\nStevens and Sugarman met at Jewish Repertory Theatre, where Stevens was performing with Saul Elkin in “Visiting Mr. Green,” a two-hander about a young man court-assigned to assist an older fellow. “It was the night I had all my friends come (to the show), because that way I got a group rate on the tickets,” Stevens recalled, “and Sam was sitting right behind them. Every time I looked over at them, I couldn’t help noticing her.”\n\nElkin also noticed something was up. “He was the best wingman,” Stevens said, laughing. “My character in the show was gay, but in the talk-back after the show Saul let everyone (e.g. Sam) know that I am not.”\n\n“I thought he was great,” Sugarman said. “I thought ‘He’s soo cute!’ ” It turned out she knew one of Sam’s friends from high school, who briefly introduced the two after the show. Stevens later asked his friend for Sugarman’s number and took it from there.\n\nStevens has been acting for years, but this is Sugarman’s first time onstage as anyone other than herself. Still, she’s a natural for the part. The show centers around a band in rehearsal and plays right to her musical strengths.\n\nThe hard part, they agreed, is the stamina required to drive the emotional narrative of the story arc, a narrative that resonates with them and that they think will resonate with the audience.\n\nThe premise is, after a medical emergency, the possibility comes up that Abigail and Shaun have only a hundred days left together.\n\n“This was totally in her (Abigail’s) head,” Sugarman explains. “All about her dreams, her fears … The theme is the feel of time, the meaning of time … of noticing life’s details.\n\n“The string of life is made of those moments, no matter how long it is. You need to hold onto them,” she said.\n\n“There’s that Tim McGraw song ‘Live Like You Were Dying,’ except you realize it takes a lot to come to terms with the reality of a relationship, the ugliness, the baggage, the person’s history,” he said. “The message is that you can’t let fear control your life. If you’ve found someone to love, to spend your life with, live it to the hilt.”\n\nThrough Aug. 4 at MusicalFare Theater on the Daemen University Campus, 4380 Main St., Amherst. In addition to Nick Stevens and Samantha Sugarman, the show stars Anna Krempholtz, Theresa Quinn, Kevin Stevens and Jay Wollin. Running time is about 90 minutes; free parking is available onsite. Tickets, including fees, are $55; $20 for students with ID; $30 for those younger than 30.\n\nEditorial & Op-Ed Regarding Our New Theatre from The Buffalo News and the Amherst Bee\n\nPosted on April 17, 2024\n\nWe ask for your support TODAY in both writings and verbal exchanges for MusicalFare as we become, over the next 30 years, an even greater cultural and economic engine for the Town of Amherst. Please note that both pieces below were published on 4/17/24 in their respective publications.\n\nEDITORIAL from The Buffalo News Editorial Board\n\nWorth the Cost\n\nRelocation and expansion of MusicalFare will be an asset to Amherst's taxpayers\n\nThere's a lot to break down regarding the opposition of some Amherst residents to the town's plan to subsidize construction of a new MusicalFare Theatre at the former Westwood Country Club.\n\nThe plan is certainly expensive – and also likely to pay handsome dividends. Nevertheless, opponents have every right to push for a referendum on the issue, regardless of the strength of their case.\n\nBut they fail when they complain that the town is making decisions by \"fiat.\" Indeed, it's a ludicrous charge. Across the country, we elect office holders to make those kinds of decisions. Whether any particular decision is sound – or popular – is a separate question, but voting for a project as the law allows is hardly a fiat. It's democracy at work. Opponents can try to defeat this one by exercising their own democratic prerogatives: by voting it down in a referendum or electing new representatives – or both.\n\nThe plan certainly comes at a fraught moment, with town leaders having just implemented an 11.4% tax increase. So large an increase will always get the attention of the people whose wallets it affects. But the plan to build a new MusicalFare theater works to the town's advantage, financially as well as socially.\n\nThe Town Board voted in April to borrow up to $11 million toward the construction of a new building for the theater company. Backers believe the new theater planned for the Amherst Central Park development, will help to transform the former Westwood Country Club into a cultural and recreational hub.\n\n\"It is a public good and it will be incredible the value that it holds decades down the road,\" Deputy Supervisor Shawn Lavin told a reporter.\n\nThe Town Board in February approved a 30-year, rent-free lease for MusicalFare, which agreed to pay $3.3 million toward the estimated $10 million theater. The town is covering the rest of the cost of the 15,000-square-foot building, which would be available for other public uses. Given the organization's annual economic impact of $2.8 million, estimates are that the new, larger facility could produce an impact of up to $4 million a year or $120 million over 30 years. And, even if it's less, it's still a win.\n\nIt's too bad this is coming at such a difficult moment in the town, but MuiscalFare is a valuable municipal asset. The project is worthy of the town's support.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nOp-Ed in the The Amherst Bee:\n\nDoes the new MusicalFare Theatre deserve your support?\n\nby RANDY KRAMER Artistic/Executive Director MusicalFare Theatre | on April 17, 2024\n\nThere has been vocal opposition from a small group of residents to the Town of Amherst’s support of the new MusicalFare Theatre. I believe many of the objections are not based on facts. No 2024 tax dollars will be used toward this project. The new MusicalFare Theatre will be owned by the Town of Amherst and will create a $120 million economic impact during its 30-year lease. Isn’t that a benefit to our community that deserves a $6.66 million investment? In 2023 MusicalFare employed 138 local personnel with a total payroll of $889,155. MusicalFare dollars also purchased from local businesses lumber for sets, costume materials, insurance, office supplies, printing and much more. Our economic impact in WNY is currently $2.8 million a year. It will increase substantially when MusicalFare moves from its current 136-seat theater to its new 220-seat home.\n\nMusicalFare is a public, not a private, entity. The Buffalo Bills are a private entity. Our tax returns and audited financials are public record. We are by far the largest producing theater in Western New York. Shea’s is a presenting theater. When we were informed by Daemen University in 2018 that our lease would not be renewed after 2025, we began investigating all possible new locations in Western New York. We had meetings with multiple developers and with Canterbury Woods. (Canterbury Woods new performance space is a wonderful facility but it is unable to host large musical theater productions as it lacks offstage wings and support space.) The Town of Amherst, recognizing that we were a 30 year+ Amherst company with approximately half of our patrons coming from their community, met with us to ensure that they would not lose this public asset. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2020, kept our operations going through COVID by offering dozens of live-streamed events (for which we received an award from the Amherst Chamber of Commerce), and finalized a lease in early 2024 with an extensive public benefits agreement, including free tickets when available to Amherst middle and high school students.\n\nMusicalFare will be paying the Town of Amherst $3.33 million by the opening of the new theater. To stay within the town’s $10 million project budget we have eliminated backstage office, storage and rehearsal space. MusicalFare will be taking on new expenses for these off-site rentals as well as the payment for all utilities in the new theater. These costs amount to the equivalent of $150,000 a year in rent over the 30-year term of the lease. To date we have raised $2.6 million in pledges and commitments in our “silent” campaign and will begin our public campaign this summer.\n\nNo other theater company in WNY offers as many performances as MusicalFare. We will be offering a full schedule of musicals and cabarets in the new theater. I ask you to support our efforts as we endeavor over the next 30 years to become an even greater cultural and economic engine for the Town of Amherst.\n\nFACT VS. FICTION ABOUT MUSICALFARE’S NEW THEATRE\n\nPosted on April 4, 2024\n\nFACT VS. FICTION ABOUT MUSICALFARE’S NEW THEATRE\n\nThere has been a lot of false information spread by a small group of Amherst residents about the new MusicalFare Theatre. In the following, we will clarify the facts from the fiction about this exciting new project for our Amherst community.\n\nFICTION: MUSICALFARE IS ONLY PAYING $1 A YEAR FOR THE NEW THEATRE\n\nFACT: MusicalFare is responsible for 1/3 of the overall cost of the 10 million dollar theatre and will be paying the Town of Amherst 3.3 million dollars toward the project. MusicalFare will also be assuming tens of thousands of annual new costs for utilities, insurance and offsite rental of office, rehearsals and storage spaces.\n\nFICTION: MUSICALFARE IS A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION\n\nFACT: MusicalFare is a 501c3 not-for-profit charity. (The Buffalo Bills are a private organization.) No one owns MusicalFare or directly profits from it. Our financial records, tax returns and audited financials are all public record.\n\nFICTION: THE 2024 AMHERST TAX INCREASE WAS DUE TO MUSICALFARE’S NEW THEATRE.\n\nFACT: No 2024 tax dollars were used toward the new theatre. A bond was approved in March 2024 by the Amherst Town Board for the costs of the new theatre. No payments on this bond will occur in 2024.\n\nFICTION: THE TOWN OF AMHERST CAN’T AFFORD TO INVEST IN MUSICALFARE THEATRE.\n\nFACT: MusicalFare currently has a 2.8 million dollar annual economic impact. We hired 138 employees in 2023. In the new and enlarged theatre our economic impact will conservatively grow to 4 million dollars a year. That’s a 120 million dollar impact over the 30 years of our lease in return for an investment by the Town of Amherst of 6.66 million dollars.\n\nFICTION: MUSICALFARE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ITS SHARE OF THE COSTS.\n\nFACT: MusicalFare has currently raised 2.7 million dollars in pledges and commitments from its “silent” campaign. The public campaign will begin in Summer 2024.\n\nFICTION: MUSICALFARE HAS INSISTED ON SOLE CONTROL OF A PUBLICLY FUNDED BUILDING.\n\nFACT: MusicalFare produces over 200 performances a year. Our lease stipulates that we will work with the Town of Amherst on their events at the theatre. MusicalFare is also offering free tickets, when available, to all Amherst middle and high school students and is creating a special “Mornings at MusicalFare” performance for each production for residents who don’t want to drive at night or for whom a morning performance time is preferable. We are working very hard to ensure the new theatre can be attended by all Amherst residents and becomes a community resource.\n\nMusicalFare is a 30-plus year Amherst Arts organization which produces the highest quality theatre in an intimate setting that differentiates us from Shea’s. Keeping MusicalFare in Amherst continues Amherst’s ascent as a cultural center for the Arts.\n\nBuffalo News Article: \"New MusicalFare Theater to be built in Amherst Central Park\"\n\nPosted on February 28, 2024\n\nNew MusicalFare Theater to be built in Amherst Central Park\n\nby Mark Sommer, The Buffalo News, 2/28/24\n\nOne of Western New York’s leading producing theater companies will move into a new $10 million, 15,000-square-foot theater built by the Town of Amherst.\n\nThe Amherst Town Board on Monday night unanimously approved a 30-year, rent-free lease for MusicalFare Theatre near the former Westwood Country Club clubhouse.\n\nMusicalFare will be responsible for one-third of the construction cost and utilities.\n\nThe theater, now on the Daemen University campus, is expected to open in September 2025 for the start of the 2025-26 season. Groundbreaking will occur by this summer.\n\n“MusicalFare is already rooted here in the community, so it’s just a natural fit,” Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa told The Buffalo News on Tuesday. “I’m thrilled to have them as a centerpiece for us. Everyone involved is just wonderfully talented in terms of operations and understanding how to connect with the community.”\n\nRandall Kramer, MusicalFare’s co-founder, artistic and executive director, said the theater has operated on the Daemen campus, also in Amherst, since 1991, and is thrilled by the move to the new Amherst Central Park.\n\n“I think it’s a great investment for the town because they can create a really world-class theater – a small regional theater but of very high quality,” Kramer said. “If we can be successful in making it a real community gathering place, then that’s the kind of thing that starts to give communities a soul.”\n\nMany Amherst residents enjoy and support the arts – about 50% of MusicalFare’s ticket buyers are from there – but the town has few performance spaces, with only one other professional theater company, O’Connell & Company at 4110 Bailey Ave.\n\nThat’s why Kulpa suggested to Kramer that the theater company consider relocating to the center of Amherst.\n\nThe theater will sit on 170 acres that belonged to the Westwood Country Club. The town acquired the site at North Forest Road and Sheridan Drive last April. The theater is being designed by David Schoell, of Natural Architecture in Hamburg, with engineering by Wendel Companies in Williamsville.\n\n“Amherst is redefining itself regionally, and as part of that we are putting park spaces and cultural performances in the limelight,” Kulpa said.\n\nThe new building, at the southern end of the park where Kulpa hopes to add other cultural offerings, will allow the main stage to expand from its current 136 seats to 220. Plans call for eight to 10 rows that will fan out from the front of the stage, rather than being straight across, as they are now. The cabaret will expand from 97 seats to 120, with an expanded bar space.\n\n“We want to still keep things intimate, because we keep hearing from everybody that that’s what keeps MusicalFare special,” Kramer said.\n\nMusicalFare was founded in 1990 and the following year began staging the first of more than 200 musical productions to date at its current home at Daemen.\n\n“They had a building that was unoccupied, and after a number of years we were bringing 25,000 people through the campus to see it, and they thought that was a great marketing,” Kramer said. “Former president Marty Anisman used to call us ‘Daemen’s football team.’”\n\nThree expansions took place over the years, with lobby carpeting and expanded seating in 2001, the addition of a backstage scene shop and reconfigured backstage dressing rooms in 2008, and a cabaret, full-service bar and box office added in 2014.\n\nThe cabaret and more spacious bar area, Kramer said, “changed the entire experience” by giving patrons a reason to come early and not feel crowded, and to stay after the show to hear music. It dramatically boosted concession sales and other revenue. Kramer plans to reprise that experience, only with more space and fast-prepped foods including sandwiches and pizza at the new theater.\n\nDaemen President Gary Olson notified Kramer in August 2018 that the landlocked university wanted to take over the use of the building after the 10-year lease expires in 2025.\n\nThe decision to bring MusicalFare to Amherst Central Park wasn’t without detractors.\n\nSome expressed concern about the potential for noise and heavier traffic that could disturb people who live near the park. The theater won’t be built near residences and the 220-seat theater will draw fewer people than the 400-member country club once did, theater representatives have said.\n\nA non-compete clause in the contract, which prevents other theater companies from performing indoor performances in the park, also rubbed some people the wrong way.\n\nKramer said theater performances can be performed outside and “we support that 100%,” but after putting $3.3 million into the building, the company felt it was only fair that they had exclusive rights to its theatrical use.\n\nKulpa said he agreed after examining leases structured similarly and signed between the City of Buffalo and Shea’s Performing Arts Center and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as community theaters including the Public Theatre in New York City.\n\nAnother clause allows middle and high school students to be able to sit in unsold seats for free if they arrive a half hour before curtain.\n\nA clause will also require one Friday morning performance during the run of a show for seniors and others who might find it harder to get to evening performances.\n\nThe town will have use of the theater for community events when not in use by the theater.\n\nKramer plans to offer more than 200 shows a year. He is excited the new theater will beckon visitors from a busy intersection. The current site is tucked into the back of the Daemen campus, and signs aren’t permitted.\n\n“I can’t wait to see what we do in there,” Kramer said. “We’ve been in spaces that had resources, but not to have it be our own and be able able to count on it.”\n\nKramer said $1.9 million of the $3.3 million has been pledged or received to date. He expressed confidence the theater company will meet its target by September 2025.\n\nOriginal architectural drawings called for rehearsal, office and storage space that are no longer in the plan, he said, so the company looks to raise another $700,000 to cover those costs.\n\nMusicalFare plans to launch a public capital campaign to raise the additional $2.1 million when the groundbreaking occurs.\n\nMusicalFare's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Outreach (DEIO) and Land Acknowledgement Statements\n\nPosted on July 10, 2023\n\nMusicalFare Theatre Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Outreach (DEIO) Statement\n\nUpdated July 2023\n\nMusicalFare Theatre is driven by the transformative power of music and arts, and we understand that inclusive, equitable and diverse stories and storytellers are instrumental in helping our Western New York theater community thrive. At MusicalFare Theatre, all are welcome and celebrated regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, education, or ability.\n\nWe are not neutral. Hate is not welcome here. We believe Black Lives Matter. We believe LGBTQIA+ lives matter. We reject anti-Semitism and anti-Asian hate. We reject white supremacy and any forms of racial, cultural, societal, and political oppression, and we support the ongoing fight for equity.\n\nWe also recognize the systemic inequalities in the arts and know that our words are only as valuable as their accompanying actions. We pledge to be constant learners and will strive to create a culture of listening and self-challenge.\n\nWe as an organization cannot fulfill our mission and truly commit to our core values unless all voices are protected and elevated equally. We are committed to standing together with, listening to, and elevating the diverse experiences, viewpoints, and voices of our community – onstage, on our creative and administrative staff, and on our board – now and always.\n\nMusicalFare Theatre’s DEIO Efforts:\n\n2021: MusicalFare launched a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committee as part of our capacity planning, which is dedicated to developing and sustaining concrete DEI policies and actions to help move us all forward.\n\n2022: MusicalFare hired Davida Tolbert as the organization's DEIO Coordinator and MusicalFare implemented DEI selection framework for the upcoming 2023 season.\n\n2023: Relationship started with Resource Council of WNY. Financial support was given through MusicalFare audiences to the Red Ribbon campaign, multiple meetings were held and plans are being formulated for MusicalFare to work with after school students and possibly seniors.\n\nCurrently, MusicalFare has already begun to establish new relationships and partnerships within the WNY community to build upon our desire to present opportunities for growth, inclusivity, advocacy for members of our community who have been excluded and/or underserved, togetherness and equality.\n\nOur Land Acknowledgement Statement:\n\nIt is with gratitude and humility that we acknowledge that we are working, performing, and gathering on the ancestral homelands of the Haudenosaunee people, who are the indigenous peoples of this land. We acknowledge the Haudenosaunee as the original caretakers of this land, and honor the sovereignty of the 6 Nations—Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca and Tuscarora, and their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. We show our respect for treaties made on this land and deep regret for the mistakes both past, and present.\n\nWe acknowledge that an overwhelming number of us are using technologies not available or accessible in present day indigenous communities.\n\nWe will strive to do the necessary work to ensure that MusicalFare becomes a more inclusive space for all, and to never cease our ongoing learning in the spirit of collaboration and reconciliation. Nya: Weh. Thank you.\n\nBuffalo News Article - MusicalFare Theatre: Postponed Shows Get New Life\n\nPosted on September 7, 2021\n\nBy Janelle Harb - The Buffalo News - 9/3/21\n\nAfter a year of virtual cabarets, MusicalFare Theatre opens its 2021-2022 season with four previously postponed shows and a new musical.\n\n“Camelot,” the new addition and first show of the season, was chosen because of its inherent protocol friendliness. “The composers and main authors of the show rewrote the show to a smaller cast so it can be done with eight people,” said MusicalFare's Marketing Director Doug Weyand.\n\n“We wanted to go and make it a production that’s relevant to our time, so we have very diverse casting,” Weyand said. “[We’re] staying true to our mission statement at the same time as providing high quality musical theater entertainment.”\n\nThe other musicals include the astounding true story “All Is Calm,” the topical “American Rhapsody,” the comedy “The Other Josh Cohen” and 2014 Tony award-winner for best musical, “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder.”\n\n“All the shows in the season, none of them have large casts,” Weyand said, citing that the maximum number of cast members in a show is 10. “Sometimes we would normally do shows that have like 25 people in them, but we’re taking it slow with people coming back to the theater.”\n\nWeyand recounted how the audition process induced emotions among returning players. “Everyone was just like ‘oh my God, I’m so happy to be here, I’m so happy to be auditioning’ and actors hate auditioning,” Weyand laughed. “People were like tearing up at auditions, it just felt so good to sing in front of people again.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, MusicalFare pivoted to a digital format through use of the cabaret space in its lobby for more than 30 livestreamed performances. “We used to do little cabaret performances on weekends where there wasn’t a mainstage show,” Weyand said. “Because of [the shutdown], we did them as livestreams and we basically turned our entire cabaret space into a television studio.”\n\nThe space went from having a one-camera livestream setup to now six, including overhead and moving cameras. “Our upcoming cabarets now will be in-person and livestreamed so we’ll be combining those two things,” Weyand said, which audiences can once again expect to see between mainstage musicals.\n\nWeyand emphasized the unspoken bond that live theater creates and society is currently missing. “It’s one of the very few things where you can communally get together with people who you don’t know necessarily and you can laugh or cry and have an emotional response,” Weyand said. “It’s something that everyone needs in their lives, it’s enriching, and it’s communal, and it’s just flat-out fun.”"
