        "text": "I live in Visitacion Valley which is a neighborhod in San Francisco. We have a building that was originally a hotel where legend has it that Ten Nights in a Bar Room and Half Dollar Bill were filmed with the star Anna Q. Nilsson. We were wondering how we can try to verify this?\n\nAlso, another neighborhood nearby is called Little Hollywood and legend has it that the \"stars\" would take the train to SF and stay in a house that Buster Keaton owned here...this would have to be the mid-late 20's.\n\nDo you know we could research this? A small group of local history people want to start an Anna Q. Nilsson fan club...and need more info...Thanks, Edie"
