Nilsson was still a teenager when she began earning money to finance a trip to New York. Arriving in the city in 1907, she was spotted in front of Carnegie Hall by artist Carol Bickwith who asked the blonde beauty to pose for him. Nilsson subsequently gained some prominence as the Stanlow Poster Girl, which led to work as a photographer's model. In 1911, she signed with the Kalem Company, one of the early movie crews in New York, and that year made her debut in Molly Pitcher. Nilsson's career remained in high gear until 1925, when she shattered her hip in a horseback-riding accident. She endured three surgeries and a long recuperation before she was able to walk again, and her career suffered as a result. \"At first I was heartbroken that my career was ended but I get over things very quickly,\" she said later. Nilsson made an easy transition into a more prosaic life, taking up travel and charity work. In 1933, she began accepting bit parts in talkies, although she found the industry much changed. \"Everything was so different from when I had worked before and I never had much confidence in myself.\" She nonetheless continued to accept occasional cameos, including one playing herself in Sunset Boulevard (1950). Her last role was a bit in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954). Nilsson, who had two brief marriages, spent her later years in a senior citizen project in Sun City, California, where she enjoyed some celebrity as a film personality.\n\nsources:\n\nKatz, Ephraim.
