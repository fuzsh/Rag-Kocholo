        "text": "Mabel Normand, as everybody knows, lived out her early years on Staten Island. However, her spiritual home was across the water on Manhattan. The two places are vastly different, with Manhattan being a lively, brightly lit place, and Staten Island drearily suburban. It appears that Mabel found the place somewhat depressing, although it was probably there that she honed her horse-riding skills, and she wasn’t alone, for movie cowboy, William S. Hart, also learned to ride, not on the western range, but on Staten Island. Mabel also claimed that she acquired her aquatic skills on the island. This sounds like an idyllic life, especially as Mabel’s family circumstances were quite unlike those of the other later-to-be stars, like the Pickfords, and the Gishes, who squatted in crumby lodgings or railway stations, as they travelled the theatrical circuits, across the United States. Mabel resided in quite a nice house, in leafy New Brighton, where the neighbours partook of afternoon tea, and twitched the chintz curtains, often. From what we can gather, referring to what Mabel later said, she was not happy among all this suburbanism, although her father, Claude, was entertainments officer at The Home For Old Seaman. He organised plays for the ex-sailors, and it is highly likely that Mabel played some small part in them, or played the piano, at which she was, apparently, very good. She seems to have been happiest going off on the bike, which she stole from her brother, and swimming and diving in the Hudson river (it is said). Mabel stated, in later years, that she had few friends, most of whom were, in fact, her siblings’ friends. “Although I understood them, they did not understand me” Said the future Queen Bee. Something of a loner, then, and almost certainly a dreamer, dreaming of the bright lights across the water, and perhaps, from what her theatrical/musician father told her, stardom on the stage.\n\nEventually, aged fourteen, Mabel finally landed in Manhattan, not in the theatre, but, as some say, in the pattern department of a big store. The story goes that Mabel’s mother found her the job of packing knitting patterns, but the manageress found her so pretty that she sent her to a commercial artist used by the store, and she became a model. Another story is that somehow Mabel became acquainted with Alice Joyce, a future Hollywood star, then working as a model. In this case, Mabel got into modelling via Alice. One thing seems obvious, though, and that is that Alice and Mabel became good friends, but, as Alice was three years older, she can be seen as Mabel’s mentor. Mabel always made a point, in later interviews, of stressing that she continued to live at home, on Staten Island, travelling every day, by subway and ferry, to and from Central Manhattan. This is an arduous and mind-numbing daily journey, and indeed, in her book on the early movie industry, Mrs D.W. Griffith claims that girls from outlying areas of New York, chose to live in Manhattan, when working in the movies. In later journalistic articles, it is specified that Mabel lived with Alice Joyce. It is, then, quite believable that the two shared an apartment, although there might have been another model involved as well, by the name of Anna Q. Nilsson. Both Anna and Alice can be described as ‘runaways’, having absconded from their homes in Sweden and Kansas City respectively. Anna came to the U.S. via the Folies Begere in Paris, and we can imagine that both girls were worldly-wise and wilful in nature. We might posit that the formerly quiet, respectful Mabel transformed to the version that the world later knew, as a result of contact with Anna and Alice. As will become apparent, however, Mabel was also to take social cues from elsewhere.\n\nThe three girls worked for a number of commercial artists – Charles Dana Gibson, James Montgomery Flagg, and Penrhyn Stanlaws, among others. That’s right, they were all Gibson Girls, and all appeared on magazine covers. Mabel, speaking about life as a model in later years, said she earned $1.50 ($37.50 today) for a morning session and the same for an afternoon session. Sometimes she would forego lunch, and do a photographic session. The pay was not fantastic, but, as Mabel explained, the artists were very kind, and sometimes gave them the Parisian-styled dresses they modelled. Mabel tells, also, that she used to massage one old artist’s arthritic legs for him, which, of course, raises some eyebrows. Eventually, Alice decided to try the new-fangled ‘flickers’ (movies), where the pay was a little higher. Soon Anna joined her at Kalem studios, and eventually Mabel chanced her arm, and walked into the studio. However, when she watched Alice perform, she was seeing a star at work, for Alice had quickly risen up the ranks. If this unnerved Mabel, she had no time to dwell on it, for she was grabbed for extra work, and sent off to be a puritan out on location, where she was chased up hill and down dale by Indians. Brow-beaten, perhaps, Mabel withdrew back to the artists, for there seemed to be little chance of stardom, or even half-decent roles. Eventually, she ran into an old friend who was working at the Biograph studio, under the direction of the great D.W. Griffith. The friend thought Mabel was ideal for Griffith, as she was incredibly slim, and ‘the genius’ was always short of dark girls to complement his army of blonds. Unlike Kalem, Griffith only occasionally made cowboy pictures, which was fine by Mabel, who seemed to like his overly-romanticised films.\n\nMabel’s entry into Biograph in late 1910, was recorded by Mary Pickford in her newspaper column in 1916. Mabel had been sat in a dressing room waiting to see Griffith, when Mary passed by. She was taken aback to see an unbelievably pretty dark-haired girl sitting there. Knowing that Griffith compartmentalised his actresses, Mary immediately realised that she was a rare beauty that could fulfil roles that the blond girls could not. She also knew that new girls left alone often lost their nerve and ran off, so she was pretty desperate to get Griffith to her. The description of a dark-haired girl, with big brown eyes, a Gibson Girl quiff, and three-inch eyelashes got his interest, and Mabel was hired.\n\nMabel soon found that she’d got herself into a menagerie, of sorts. The studio was a three-storey brownstone mansion, with the stages installed in the former ballroom. Dressing rooms and storage areas were scattered throughout the building, and all was pervaded by the din of two hundred people chattering away while working, eating, or simply lounging on the staircases – only Griffith had a chair. This was Mabel’s kind of place, for at heart, she was a ‘people-person’ and here she felt at ease. She was later to say:\n\n“Nothing interesting happened in my life, until I got into motion pictures.”\n\nIf Mabel was interested in the creatures of the menagerie, strutting would-be starlets, heart-throbs, he-men and the like, then they were even more fascinated by her. A dark-haired girl, without a blond wig was, indeed, a rarity, and those fluttering eyelashes! She was soon three-deep with heart-throbs and he-men, but also girls, amazed at her ability to attract, and hold, the men’s attention. However, they soon learned that there was more to Mabel than a pretty face. At the end of 1910, nevertheless, Mabel found herself side-lined, along with other incipient stars, when the Biograph company left New York to winter in California. Mabel was still in training, and the company only took those with long experience, that is, only the theatrical players.\n\nMabel did not return to modelling, but travelled farther afield to Brooklyn, and the Vitagraph studio. Coming from the Griffith studio, she commanded no little respect, and brim-full of confidence, she soon made an impact. Comedian John Bunny, saw this now exuberant and vivacious girl around the studio, and just knew that he had to cast her in his films. This is where Mabel’s career took off. On the screen, the effervescent Mabel became a favourite, but she was even more favoured around the studio. Young actresses admired her animated, but reckless ways. Stage-mothers also loved her, but looked at her with some circumspection, and especially her unbridled fraternisation with the men. They warned their girls not to copy Mabel’s ways, but of course it was hopeless. Possibly, Mabel sought digs in Flatbush, rather than travel daily across the East River, but we have no information on this. Unfortunately for Mabel, the studio owners were strict quakers, and one of her antics raised their eyebrows, and star or not, she was fired. There are many versions as to what the ‘antic’ was, and so we will not dwell on this point. Suffice to say that Vitagraph’s owner, J.S. Blackton was happy to attend the dedication and opening of the Mabel Normand Soundstage in 1940. Mabel, though, hadn’t quite toned down her act, for she lasted at the Reliance Studio a mere four hours, director Harold Reid (father of Wally) having to “let her go due to unacceptable behaviour.” By this time, Biograph was back in town, and Mabel made her way to 11 East Fourteenth Street. Now, if Mabel the star was born at Vitagraph ‘the legend’ was born in that brownstone building, but also in the wilds of upstate New York, Fort Lee, New Jersey, Long Island, and on the Jersey Shore, as far down as Atlantic City. In these places, as Mrs Griffith told it, “Mabel began to daredevil.” Diving off high cliffs, swimming rapids, and riding bucking broncos were all in a day’s work for the Biograph Girl. Other times, she played a vamp, or as Mary Pickford put it:\n\n“Being dark ….. she played the flashing-eyed creature of temperament, whose very looks were stilettos in your heart, and whose movements undulated like a snake crawling through the brush.”\n\nHowever, while holding court among her followers, she would sometimes notice an uncouth oaf, lounging against a pillar, grinning at her. She’d learnt of this guy the previous year. His name was Mack Sennett, a country boy from the Canadian outback, and the advice was to steer clear of this half-Irish madman, who had never so much (again according to Mrs Griffith) bought a girl a milk-shake. Soon, nonetheless, Sennett left his leaning post. He had been appointed comedy director of the studio, and had now lost his reticence, so approached Mabel with some swagger, and armed with a diamond bracelet. Now, Sennett had no innate interest in girls, but he knew he must have a leading lady in his comedies. Mabel, it has to be said, was tabled as the best in the comedy business at that time, and having opened her eyes with the diamonds, he went to Griffith and asked for Mabel’s fair hand, or at least he asked to share her with him. Unfortunately, as Mabel later recounted, Griffith agreed. The later King of Comedy had a script just right for the daredevil Mabel. She would don a very tight swimsuit and a story would be woven around her. Called ‘The Diving Girl’, the picture was a huge success. Modern swimsuits were just coming in, and the girls that wore them, mostly athletes, were heroines. No doubt the likes of Charlie Chaplin would be glad to meet the Diving Girl, and eventually he did, way out west. It is noticeable in the film, that Mabel’s legs are covered, and indeed, Griffith caused a huge ruckus, when he asked Mabel and Mary to appear on screen with bare legs – it just wasn’t done, back in the day. A Californian girl, by the name of Harriet Quimby, making good in New York, often visited the studio. Quite a gal was Harriet, an epitome of the liberated female, a talented screen-writer and flyer — the first woman to fly the English Channel and the first to hold a U.S. pilot’s licence. Harriet always arrived in a plush Pierce-Arrow limousine, looking a million dollars in her furs and diamonds. There can be little doubt that Mabel took note, and elements of Harriet can be seen in the later Keystone Girl [see Footnote].\n\nMabel continued oscillating between drama and comedy through 1911, and into 1912, when the company made pictures around Los Angeles. Biograph made a huge number of seminal pictures out west, with Mabel in a fair number of them.\n\nAt the end of Biograph’s 1912 sojourn in the west, Mabel decided to throw in her hand with Mack Sennett and the newly formed Keystone company. By all accounts, this caused a certain amount of panic among the players, as the scheme was bound to fail. Mary Pickford was devastated, and explained to Mabel how she’d quit Biograph for another new-start studio, which quickly failed, leaving her to return to Biograph, crestfallen and her credibility severely tarnished. Blanche Sweet, her grandmother, and the various stage-mothers tried to hold Mabel back, although it seems they might have had selfish reasons for doing so – she would have left an unbearable vacuum behind her. However, Mabel did take the plunge, the advantages of Keystone being $125-a-week, and being the sole leading lady. And so it was that Mabel left the bright lights of Manhattan, for the tinder dry dust bowl they call Los Angeles. So it was, also, that Mabel became the first U.S. movie star to live permanently in the City of Angels – what did Mabel think about that? To be honest, we do not know, for Mabel never recorded her thoughts on the matter. No doubt she shed a few tears, over leaving New York and her friends, Mabel’s only companions now being grey-haired middle-aged men, most of whom were married. However, the next few years were ones of relentless hard work and long days, trying to get the studio off the ground – there was little room for sentimentality. In fact it would be almost two years before Mabel hit New York again. On her vacation back east, she was hailed as the big star that she had become, and creeping covertly into her homeland, Staten Island, she was ‘captured’ by the Mayor of New Brighton, who insisted on parading her through the streets in an open-top limousine. It was here, in Manhattan, that she took advantage of the Flerda photographic studios, and had some publicity shots carried out. Naturally, Mabel was not the only ‘Hollywooder’ in town, as those that had become prisoners of the studios when they moved west, were keen to get back east, as often as possible. At any one time, the Pickford, Gish and Talmadge families could be found in Manhattan, along with a plethora of other stars, and all shared the social contacts they had in the city. In a way, they were ex-pats (of L.A.) living abroad (in New York), although, in another way, they were returning New Yorkers.\n\nMabel returned many times to Manhattan, although it is unclear as to whether she went every time to Staten Island. Often she would depart the social scene, and stifling city for the resort town of Huntington, on Long Island. It was in early 1916, that Mabel was in the east to make films at the Triangle/New York Motion Pictures studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Mabel, of course, could never live in Jersey, and had an apartment near Central Park, Manhattan, which shows how wedded she was to the city, as the journey to Fort Lee was tedious and arduous, requiring an awkward trip on the ferry across the Hudson. When her time was up at Fort Lee, she refused to return west, and sat in Manhattan, offering her services to any New York studio that had the requisite funds to employ her. To cut a long story short, she ended up with her own studio in East Hollywood. A year later, and the studio had collapsed along with the Triangle group, and Mabel fled back to Manhattan. She soon had a party scene going on there, and it transpired that she had signed for Sam Goldwyn, but had decided to do a ‘1916’ and put herself up for auction. Mack Sennett decided to make a bid for Mabel, but Goldwyn obtained a court injunction, preventing her from signing for anyone else. Sennett tried to ‘starve’ Goldwyn out, by sending solicitors to increase Mabel’s contract price to unheard of levels. The attempt failed, and Mabel was soon in Goldwyn’s glass-covered, Fort Lee studio. For Mabel, the joy of being in Manhattan was slightly marred by the awkward journey across the river, but this was not to last, for the studio was soon relocated in Los Angeles. Not too problematic, as her friends were located for much of the year in the Hollywood area, and it was also an opportunity for Mabel to reacquaint herself with Charlie Chaplin, who had a studio on the site.\n\nIt was in 1920 that Sam Goldwyn ran into financial difficulties, and began to jettison stars, but he dearly wanted to keep hold of Mabel, and had thoughts of loaning her out. On hearing this, Chaplin went into a kind of panic, thinking Mabel could end up in an unsuitable studio, and it seems he sent word to Mack Sennett. Chaplin brought a message to Goldwyn that Sennett was willing to pay $30,000 to borrow Mabel for one picture. After some dodging around, Sam accepted the offer, and off went Mabel. Not that she was happy about this, but Mack promised her a 25% cut of the net profits of the film, and agreed to spend $260,000 making it. Now, Mabel had been ill, it is said with the Spanish Influenza, and Sennett and the director F. Richard Jones, suggested she take a few weeks holiday, before the shoot began. Mabel elected to head east to Manhattan, but she did not hit the normal social scene, but the bohemian scene in Greenwich Village, where, it is said, she lived on cress and cabbage water for several weeks. Whether correct, or not, she was ready to return and shoot ‘Molly O’.\n\nShooting had just ended, when Labour Day weekend chimed in, and Hollywood cleared out, the stars heading for San Francisco, Catalina Island, or for those between pictures, New York. Roscoe Arbuckle held a party at the St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, where an actress called Virginia Rappe died. All hell broke loose in the press, as journalists scrutinised the movie stars morals. Some bright sparks remembered that a certain Mabel Normand had been close to ‘Fatty’ – wasn’t it likely that Mabel was in ‘Frisco’ that night, and wasn’t it possible that she was at the party? The search was on for Mabel, but she was nowhere to be found. After several days, she surfaced in Manhattan, declaring that the whole Rappe thing was a mystery to her. Was Mabel ever in San Francisco on that night? No-one knows, but with ‘Molly O’ just about finished, it was likely that she would have fled to the east. We use the word ‘fled’ because it seems clear that Mabel was not completely happy with working once more with Sennett. Clearly, she was completely at home in Manhattan, and indeed, she drew a lot of attention there. So much so that she upped sticks again, and moved out to Long Island, where she stayed with old friends, Raymond Hitchcock and wife. The press were happy to visit her there, when allowed to, which was quite often, due to Molly O’ being premiered in Manhattan in early December. You can never have too much publicity. Of course, it was no real problem to drive over to Manhattan for functions, arriving in the Hitchcock’s fabulous Rolls Royce car. The party in the east was ended by Mack Sennett, who wanted Mabel back, for the premiere at his Mission Theatre in Los Angeles. Mack thought this to be far more beneficial than any Broadway showing, so Mabel must return to the dust bowl. Well, Mack got his premiere, attended by every producer and director in the business. Very important was the presence of the drama producers, like Griffith and Paramount Studio, for this film was no straight comedy, it was a drama, and billed as such. Now Sennett could shrug off is reputation of making amusing, but rough and ready pictures. Ex-Griffith girl Mabel, had been essential to this success, but Mack had clearly thought everything through, and realised that Mabel had become a treasure in the field of drama. Money was no object, in regards to the number of private detectives put on Mabel’s tail. Word came that she was getting close to a Paramount director called Wm. Desmond Taylor, and Mack knew that he was a ‘fixer’ at his studio. Mack further got suspicious when his star-of-stars started to behave very formally with him. She attended a Christmas party at Sennett’s house, but turned up with Taylor, and left within minutes. Producer/star protocol had been broken, and Mack was livid. A few weeks later, and Taylor was found – shot dead. As Mack Sennett later said “Who shot Wm. Desmond Taylor? I don’t know.” Taylor’s butler said that Mabel did the deed, because Taylor failed to get her into Paramount. Police dismissed this, but believed Mabel knew the killer. The case was never resolved, but Sennett remained a suspect until the case was stood down in the 1950s. Who did shoot Wm. Desmond Taylor?\n\nAlthough Mabel was not suspected of killing anyone, the newspapers had a field day with the story, and Mabel was at the centre of it all. “A little Arbuckle in petticoats” The press said. The studio had already begun the filming of ‘Suzanna’, Mabel being ferried to and from location in a blacked-out car. Mabel’s first thought must have been to run for New York, but the film shoot kept her in the west, where she abandoned her besieged West 7th Street home, for an out of the way house in Altadena. As the ferocity of the attacks on her increased, Mabel decided that New York was not far enough, and booked a European tour. As Suzanna was released, and Will Hays, former Postmaster General, hit L.A. to clean the town up, Mabel was on the train with her entourage, heading to New York. However, Los Angeles police had preceded her, and were combing Manhattan for the Hollywood refugee. Several days were spent searching for Mabel, but the last they saw of her she was waving at them from the RMS Aquitania.\n\n“I have no dispute with the authorities, and was available any time they wanted to question me” She said to the press hordes that had stormed the ship. Did Mabel intend leaving for good? Probably not, for the days of stars leaving to work in Old Blighty were still a decade away. In any event, Mabel was gone a good few months, and returned to New York, not to silence but to the chorus of the baying press pack. Mabel had decided to stay in Manhattan, perhaps forever. Telegrams from Mack Sennett, who was planning a new Mabel picture went unanswered. Flustered, Mack called her long distance on a number he’d managed to discover some place. Someone answered and said they’d find Mabel. There were champagne glasses clinking in the background.\n\n“Hello, who is it?” a voice came back.\n\n“It’s me, Mack.”\n\n“Mack who?”\n\n“Mack Sennett, of course.”\n\n“That’s what they all say, buster, now get lost.”\n\nThe phone went dead. That device never came back on line, leaving Mack to interrogate friends, in an effort to get addresses. It was hopeless, and such a shame, as Mack’s screenplay was especially written for Mabel, would bring her out of the doghouse, and of course, make him a multi-millionaire. He had to get a star, but none of the established actresses would touch it. It was Mabel’s film, and she should star in it. In desperation, he took a stock company actress called Phyllis Haver, and decided she would do. Unfortunately, Phyllis, a sweet-looking blond, had the appearance and actions of someone that had stepped out of a Keystone slapstick movie. Director F. Richard Jones, after three weeks shooting, told Mack “It’s hopeless boss, she just cannot get the nuances, appears contrived.” The newspapers had just issued the news about the new film, called ‘Extra Girl’. Out of the blue, there came a call – from Mabel. She was furious, someone was starring in her picture, and she wanted that role, or else. What the ‘or else’ was we do not know, but perhaps she intended to give certain information to the authorities. As far as Mack was concerned this was great news, and Mabel soon arrived in L.A., “Gay as a wisp” according to The King of Comedy. The film was seen as a success, and Mabel began a nation-wide promotional tour. Her friend, Edna Purviance had less success with her first solo film (without Chaplin) and it seems Mabel provided her with some support and comfort. They met for a New Year’s Day drink at the apartment of Courtland Dines, supposed fiancé of Edna. In brief, Mabel’s chauffeur rushed into the apartment and shot Dines, and we will skip the mass of detail, which has been set out in previous articles. The press, naturally, pulled out their long-knives, and viscously attacked Mabel in their columns.\n\nThey had been waiting for this chance since the Taylor affair had fizzled out. This time, Mabel stayed put, having decided to tough it out. At the trial of the chauffer, Mabel railed from the witness box, and just about put the judge on trial. Mack Sennett melted into the background, as Mabel set out to discover who had hired the shooting chauffeur. Her secretary denied any knowledge of this, and said the chauffeur had been sent along by the Pierce-Arrow Company, from whom Mabel had bought a new car. Some people thought that Mack Sennett had sent the guy, just to make sure Mabel did not hitch up with a millionaire, like Dines, then put her feet up. This was all supposition of course, but the main thing to deal with now, was the fact that the press were implying that Mabel was a New York good-time girl, partying in Los Angeles. Her Hollywood friends thought she should make some commitment in Los Angeles, buy a house and settle down. So, rather than go back to Manhattan, Mabel bought a pile in Beverly Hills, and kind of retired. The retirement lasted a month, before it was suggested she go on a nationwide stage tour. Building on her fame in the movies, she could play to packed houses, and get a sizeable pension pot together. Indeed, many of the silent actresses, by 1925, were looking to do something similar, in lieu of marrying a millionaire. Well, if Mabel thought she was heading for New York, she was wrong. Although the show played to packed audiences across the country, the critics were scathing, as Mabel’s voice could not be heard beyond the orchestra. Therefore, there was little chance of the show hitting Broadway. She did, nonetheless, pocket a million dollars, some say two million, which was a nice little nest egg.\n\nIf Mabel had completely retired, then she would have headed back to Manhattan. Her friends, it was true, were in Los Angeles, although they were frequent visitors to New York. The U.S. movie industry was now almost entirely in L.A. or Florida, which were the places she needed to be seen in, if she ever wanted to return to films. In brief, Mabel attended and held Hollywood parties, attended many premieres, and eventually made some films for Hal Roach. A possibility with MGM fell through, when Mabel became very sick, in 1929. Mabel died in early 1930, her roots and family being in New York. We might think that the city would be her last resting place, but very quickly Hollywood took over the body of their favourite daughter, found someone to give up their tomb, and, against Mabel’s wishes, organised a massive funeral for which the entire movie industry shut down for its entire duration. A symbolic end for the Silent Movie Era, and although Mabel is interred in The Calvary Mausoleum, Los Angeles, her heart must surely be in New York, and specifically in Manhattan.\n\nFootnote:\n\nMrs Griffith tells an interesting story in her book. She and Mr Griffith had known Harriet back in San Francisco, in 1905. A few years later, Harriet visited them in their rundown New York flat, in the days before DWG made it as a director. After the visit, DWG watched her step into her chauffeur-driven limousine, then fell back into his chair, exclaiming “My god, she’s a success!”\n\nBibliography\n\nBehind the Screen by Samuel Goldwyn (1923).\n\nKing of Comedy by Mack Sennett (1954).\n\nLove, Laughter and tears: My Hollywood Story by Adela Rogers St. Johns (1978).\n\nMabelescent: Which Athough Unclassified Typifies the Normand Naivete.
