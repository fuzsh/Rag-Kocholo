        "text": "I agree with the others. Hit ALL banks! Don't just try getting boxes. Ask for any and all halves in the bank. You obviously have to go in with cash in-hand. When/if they ask, how many you want?........you say \"I'll Take Them All!\" Most banks don't want them and want to get rid of them. And don't just hit banks you have accounts at. Like I said, ALL banks.\n\nOne of the first things you have to say: \"I Will Not Return Them\" You have to find a dump bank somewhere.\n\nRemember; it's not what you say, it's how you say it. If you're lucky, some banks will order you boxes \"without\" having an account. If you find a bank that will help you, a dozen donuts will go a long way! Trust me, they will remember you and help you the next time. It's all about establishing a relationship.\n\nIf you hit some banks several months ago, that said no because you need a account. Go back today. There could very well be new tellers or managers there today that are now be willing to help you. It's happened to me more then once!\n\nI'm doing the same thing you're doing but with dollars coins. I have dollar coins coming out of my butt!.....Why?... because no one wants them and they are easy to get. Boxes, random rolls and loose coins in tellers trays, etc..\n\nIf they ask, don't be afraid to tell the tellers what you're doing with the coins or what you're looking for. Many tellers have expressed an interest in what exactly I'm doing with them. Again, don't be afraid to tell them. You just might create a new collector.\n\nI walked into a Navy Federal Credit Union about 8 months ago. They couldn't/wouldn't help me because I wasn't an account holder. I went back 2 months later. I had this young kid/teller guy, (I say kid, probably 30/35 years old ðŸ˜‚) he said; no problem, how many do you want? The guy gave me a box!! I couldn't believe it!! I've been getting a box a week ever since. Keeping my fingers crossed. ðŸ¤ž The donuts thing helped tremendously!\n\nTaking it to another level..... this guy took a real interest in exactly what I was doing and what I was looking for. One day I brought in a slabbed speared eagle and the Cherrypicker's guide (the one with the estimate price guide), to show him. His eyes popped out of his head and he went slack jaw! Seeing his reaction was worth every second!!\n\nI have several speared eagles. I put one in a 2x2 flip and marked/identified it. I put it in an envelope with a short note thanking him. He was so excited. He couldn't believe it! The other tellers came over to his work station to see. The entire Credit Union (including some customers) were looking at it. It's been easy sailing ever since.\n\nHappy hunting!\n\nInteresting topic. I have been hitting banks and credit unions like mad lately - with gas prices and grocery prices going up people are digging into stuff they have been hanging on to for awhile and turning it in to banks and credit unions. The economy going down the toilet bowl churns out goodies that get back to banks.\n\nIn the last week I have gotten 220 Ike dollars, mostly BU 1972 and 1972-D, 60 rolls of half dollars ie $600 face. The rolls were rather productive - the very last roll I opened was a veritable jackpot - there was only one clad half in the roll, a 1971 - the other 19 coins were all dated 1965-1969. Other rolls had more 40% and one had a 1964 90%. Also found a small error on a bicentennial half - a minor clip.\n\nThe teller that sold me the $600 asked me if I was bringing back the ones I didn't want. I haven't visited that branch in years and she didn't know me. My response was, \"are you sure you want them back? I'm planning on sending the castoffs out of state and hopefully you'll never see them again\" She thanked me, they do not like having to count these things in the vault especially when they sit there sometimes for months."
