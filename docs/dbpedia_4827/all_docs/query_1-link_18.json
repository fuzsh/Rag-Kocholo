        "text": "In her last picture, \"The Humming Bird,\" the dainty, dark-eyed Gloria Swanson impersonated an Apache, which naturally restricted her chances to satisfy her taste for finery. It was a good story, but she was limited to a single gown. This week, however, she blazes forth in her full sartorial glory and makes up for any deficiency of splendor in a previous effort. She is to be seen at the Rivoli in a film called \"A Society Scandal,\" translated to the screen from Alfred Sutro's play, \"The Laughing Lady,\" which was presented on the stage about a year ago with Ethel Barrymore.Clothes seem to inspire Miss Swanson and she performs with marked ability in this picture. In a few scenes she appears in a gown richly bordered with white fur. Her other costumes are too numerous to describe, but they provoke admiration. Forrest Halsey did a good piece of work in adapting this vehicle, and it is also splendidly directed by Allan Dwan, who has curbed his penchant for colossal settings. There are some truly, beautiful stagings in this production, which is a tribute to the Astoria studios. But there are certain close-ups, in which Miss Swanson appears almost matronly, to which too much time is given.In some parts this story is undoubtedly frivolous, but it is produced so lavishly that it is always pleasing. It is a plausible narrative, which is an intense relief from the usual movie hokum.One sees drawing rooms that really look like what they are meant to be. And one is constantly moved to murmurs of admiration for other settings, which are not huge but faithful in their representation.Miss Swanson plays the rôle of the fascinating and careless Mrs. Colbert, who has a fickle swain, who demands everything of his wife and expects her to find out nothing wrong about him. Harrison Peters adores Mrs. Colbert, and one night after \"a nightcap too many,\" he enters her abode. Mrs. Colbert's mother-in-law, a meddlesome old creature, sends word of the worst to her son.The divorce trial ensues. Daniel Farr, a young lawyer, engaged by the husband, takes such a bitter dislike to Mrs. Colbert, that his clever verbal attack on her causes the husband to win the case.One of the many good scenes is where the lawyer, played by Rod La Rocque, visits Mrs. Colbert, after her good name has been blackened. He has been to see her before, but on this occasion Mrs. Colbert, eager for revenge, tears the arm of her gown, ruffles her hair, pulls Farr's necktie off and effaces the parting from his usually well-combed hair. Then she screams for help. All this happens just when young Farr is anticipating his election as District Attorney on the strength of the fine summing up he made in the divorce trial. So it is undoubtedly an awkward predicament for a young lawyer in which to be placed. Mrs. Colbert tells Farr that she was innocent and he convicted her, and that he is innocent but will be convicted in the eyes of everybody.Farr has announced how much he disliked her type, but before this attack he was gradually becoming her devoted slave, apparently without being quite aware of it.There is prior to this scene the sight of a dinner to which Mrs. Colbert goes, in spite of the warning that Farr is going to be there. Mr. Dwan had pictured this beautifully, and the subtitles in this sequence are excellent. One of them is \"Soup.\" Another is \"The Roast,\" and the scenes show how Mrs. Colbert is progressing in her efforts to wheedle affection from the handsome young lawyer. His discomfort is extraordinarily well portrayed.This is an entertainment well worthy of better class pictures, and one to which one can look forward as an evening of delight. Mr. La Rocque is composed and careful as the young lawyer. Ricardo Cortez gives a pleasing performance of the love-smitten young man, and Allan Simpson is capable as Colbert.Mrs. Thelma Converse, sister of Mrs. Reginald C. Vanderbilt, plays a minor rôle in this production.Dr. Lee De Forest gives two further demonstrations of his phonofilm at the Rivoli, in which he illustrates the value of this invention, which so far is not perfect, but at the same time most interesting. Chauncey Depew is seen seated in a chair, and he proceeds to talk for about four minutes on \"Memories of Lincoln.\" One can hear every word he utters, which is remarkable considering the age of this statesman. It was interesting to note that when he coughed it was also heard from the screen. The voice is well synchronized with the action of Mr. Depew's lips. In fact the chief weakness of this remarkable invention is that the sound comes from the sides of the screen, and not from the lips. However, there are moments when one loses sight of this defect by the sheer interest one feels in what the speaker utters. This is one of the first efforts to obtain the picture and speech of famous men. Dr. Frank Crane was also shown giving a talk on \"Happiness,\" which was interesting.\n\nA Social Revenge.A SOCIETY SCANDAL, with Gloria Swanson, Rod La Rocque, Ricardo Cortez, Allan Simpson, Mrs. Ida Waterman, Mrs. Thelma Converse, Fraser Coalter, Catherine Proctor, Wilfred Donovan, Yvonne Hughes, Catherine Coleburn, Marie Shelton, Dorothy Stokes, Cornelius Keefe and others, adapted from Alfred Sutro's play. \"The Laughing Lady,\" directed by Allan Dwan; \"Covered Wagon Medley\"; \"Memories of Lincoln,\" with Chauncey Depew in Dr. De Forest's Phonofilm. At the Rivoli.\"Flowing Gold\" fills one with amazement at the amount of movie hokum that can be packed into eight reels. This oily, lurid, muddy affair is being exhibited at the Strand this week, the title being another name for oil. The theme is propitious in view of the Teapot Dome disclosures.Improbable as it is, the first half of this picture is entertaining, as the atmosphere is fairly well depicted. There are the sleds for the muddy thoroughfares, spouting oil wells which bring infinite joy to the heroine and her father, and a virile adventurer. One smiles at what one is told in this section of the story, wondering how far things will go. The excellent fortune of the man who reaches town with only a flat dime is interesting, especially when he is mistaken for a wealthy capitalist and is entrusted with jewelry worth a king's ransom.The mud is used for comedy, as is to be expected, so when a portly woman tumbles into the mire she reaches out and strikes a man who she believes to be responsible for her humiliating experience.Milton Sills plays the rô1e of Calvin Gray, a victim of a superior officer in the army. Gray is pictured arriving in Dallas and taking the Governor's suite in the hotel, knowing that he has only a dime in his pocket. Fortune smiles upon him and he is asked to take the jewels to the Briskow family, alluded to as Texas nesters, and who apparently need gems more than they do clothes. Gray is held up en route, and as both highwaymen have pistols it seems as if the jewels are going to change hands long before they reach their destination. But Gray is a resourceful individual and when the bandits least expect it he squirts tear gas into their faces, with the result that he escapes with the valuables. The villain, it is revealed, has enlisted the scoundrels, and he is the officer who was responsible for Gray's dishonorable discharge from the army.All this one enjoys chiefly because Gray is an engaging, it reckless, adventurer. Without a dollar to bless himself with, he signs a check and puts a dollar tip on it for the waiter. He leans over the cigar counter, plucks out a healthy bunch of cigars, which he distributes to admirers who believe him to be an important person, and tells the clerk to charge them to his room. He is an athletic J. Rufus Wallingford.But when one comes to the second half of the picture, it is too much for anybody, Buddy Briskow (John Roche), a simple-minded youth, suddenly realizing the great wealth the oil well has brought, falls in love with a plump, peroxide blonde. Gray, who is called upon to do a lot in this picture, soon discovers that this young woman is an adventuress known to a fast crowd as \"the suicide blonde.\" When she realizes that her history is known she pulls out a vial, supposed to contain poison, and does her little act, which this time brings only laughter from the other characters.The last section of this film is the most impossible, for not only are Gray and Allegheny Briskow (Anna Q. Nilsson) caught in a torrential flood and an oil well struck by lightning, but the shack is rooted up and it floats along, so that the couple have to climb on the roof. One would think that that would be enough, but Mr. Grasse has thought up an additional horror by flinging the couple into the raging waters, then covered with blazing oil.Anna Q. Nilsson fills her part competently. Mr. Sills is sympathetic, but he ought to be cast in more plausible stories, as his ability is worth something better than is offered in \"Flowing Gold.\" Those who can bear with hokum may find this picture an average entertainment.\n\nFLOWING GOLD, with Anna Q. Nilsson, Milton Sills, Alice Calhoun, Craufurd Kent, John Roche, Cissy Fitzgerald, Josephine Crowell, Bert Woodruff, Charles Sellon and others, adapted from Rex Beach's story, directed by Joseph De Grasse; \"Famous Composers' Series;\" \"Moment musicale the ballet corps.\" Serenade sung by Ruth Arden; \"Marche Militaire,\" danced by Anatole Bourman and the ensemble. At the Strand."
