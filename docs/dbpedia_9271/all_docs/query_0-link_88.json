        "text": "Happy Friday Metalheads! Today, we remember Slayer guitarist, Jeff Hannemann, who’s birthday would have been this coming Sunday, but sadly passed away in 2013 at 49 due to liver failure.\n\nJeffrey John “Jeff” Hanneman met Kerry King in 1981 while auditioning for another band and approached him about playing together and forming their own band. King, who was in agreement with Hanneman, introduced drummer Dave Lombardo to Hanneman and after recruiting bassist/vocalist Tom Araya, Slayer was born. The band often played covers of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs at clubs and parties. During a show at the Woodstock Club, Slayer were noticed by Metal Blade Records founder, Brian Slagel, who asked them to record an original song for his Metal Massacre III compilation. The song “Aggressive Perfector” led to a recording contract with Metal Blade Records.\n\nJeff contributed both musically and lyrically to every Slayer album and wrote the songs “Raining Blood”, “War Ensemble”, “South of Heaven”, “Seasons in the Abyss” and “Angel of Death.” Jeff was a huge fan of early heavy metal and punk music and sported a DK (Dead Kennedys) symbol, as well as the likeness of Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten on his guitar. ESP also released a signature Jeff Hanneman model guitar, based on his Jackson Soloist. In 2011, Jeff had contracted necrotizing fasciitis which forced him to take a hiatus from Slayer and while the band had announced that he had recovered from the disease, he was still not well enough to return to Slayer. His death sent shockwaves through the metal community and changed the face of metal forever.\n\nAs a longtime Slayer fan who grew up in the 80’s when I first heard Slayer I was hooked. The first time I heard “Show No Mercy” and “Chemical Warfare”, there was no doubt in my mind that Slayer would achieve the success they have attained and beyond. If you went to any metal club, you would hear “SLAYER” chanted at least once or twice during the night and Slayer shows always have some very intense mosh pits. Rest in peace Jeff, you left us way too soon and the legacy you left the metal world will live on forever!!\n\nCHECK OUT SLAYER FROM STUDIO 54 IN NYC ON THE COMBAT TOUR FROM 1985\n\nHappy Friday Metalheads! Hope you had a great week! Today we’re stepping back in time to 1983 to the self-titled debut album by Suicidal Tendencies for the track “Institutionalized.”\n\nThis was the only single to be released off this album, but it is one of their most popular songs and is always on the setlist for their shows. The video depicts Mike being misunderstood by his parents and friends and while his parents decide to take matters into their own hands to get him help, he assures us that he’s okay and he’ll figure it out, he just wants a Pepsi.\n\nMike’s parents are portrayed by actors Jack Nance known for his roles in many of David Lynch’s movies including Eraserhead, Dune and Blue Velvet to name a few and Mary Woronov, a renowned actress, author and painter, who has appeared in several movies and television shows and worked with the late Andy Warhol.\n\nSuicial Tendencies started out as a punk band but crossed over to thrash metal in the mid 80’s. The song “Institutionalized” has been used in several movies and video games and has been covered by several bands including Ice T’s Body Count on their 2014 album “Manslaughter” billed as “Institutionalized 2014.” Check out the original video below and if you look at the video closely, you’ll see a guest appearance by a member of Slayer. Let me know in comments below who you see.\n\nSUICIDAL TENDENCIES – INSTITUTIONALIZED\n\nHappy Friday Metalheads. Hope you all had a great week. For today’s rewind I’m going to revisit a post on one of my all time favorite bands called Hades. Formed in 1978 by guitarist Dan Lorenzo, Hades began playing the circuit and released their 7″ EP “Deliver Us From Evil” in 1982. After a few lineup changes, the band handed out some demos and rehearsal tapes throughout the underground scene and interviewed with some local fanzines in the NY/NJ area to get their name out.\n\nHades was then soon heard on the Megaforce compilation “Born To Metalize” and Metal Blade’s “Metal Massacre VI.” This led to Torrid Records signing the band and the label released their first full-length album “Resisting Success” in 1987. The album recorded in New Jersey showcases Hades talent, great vocals, blistering guitars and songs that keep you hooked in from the first track “The Leaders?” all the way to the 3 part “Masque of the Red Death.” In 1988, they released their second full length album “If At First You Don’t Succeed” which led to opening slots on tours with Slayer, Anthrax, Overkill, Megadeth and Testament to name a few as well as shows at different venues including the now defunct L’amour Brooklyn and The Chance in Poughkeepsie, NY.\n\nHades left for their first European tour in 1989, but unfortunately it was to be their last. Tensions between the band members caused the band to break up and members Dan Lorenzo and Alan Tecchio formed Non Fiction while drummer Tom Coombs ended up joining Doro Pesch’s band. Jimmy Schulman went on to lend his services to a few bands and Ed Fuhrman became involved with martial arts but eventually decided to return to music.\n\nIn 1991, Hades released “Live On Location” which was taped at the now defunct Studio One in New Jersey for their first reunion show. The band went on to release “Exist to Resist” in 1996 which contained a mix of old and new songs. Metal Blade quickly signed Hades and consequently released “$avior Self” in 1998. This led to a performance at Wacken Open Air in 2000 where they were joined by Jimmy Schulman on bass and Ron Lipinicki on drums. However after the release of “Damnation” in 2001, Hades once again broke up and the members went on to various musical projects.\n\nIn 2004, Mausoleum Records re-released the first two Hades albums and Cruz Del Sur released the DVD “Bootlegged in Boston 1988” in 2009. Several reunion shows have since taken place in their native New Jersey, and a second DVD “Hades: Re-United and Re-Ignited” of their reunion show at Dingbatz in Clifton, New Jersey was released in 2010.\n\nThe first time I heard Hades was about 10 years ago when a friend of mine was playing “Live On Location” and from the minute I heard The Leaders? I was blown away. Check out the video below from a show from 2001 in Erie, PA. A classic indeed.\n\nToday we take a trip back to 1988 to the second album by San Francisco’s Forbidden called “Twisted Into Form” for the track “Step By Step.”\n\nThe video was in constant rotation on MTV’s Headbanger’s Ball and with the addition of guitarist Tim Calvert, the album turned out to be more melodic from their first album. The lineup includes Russ Anderson – vocals, Tim Calvert and Craig Locicero – guitars, Matt Camacho – bass and Paul Bostaph (Testament, Slayer, Exodus) – drums. The band released two more albums before disbanding in 1997 with Bostaph joining Slayer. They reunited in 2001 under their original name Forbidden Evil for Thrash of the Titans, the benefit concert for Chuck Billy and Chuck Schuldiner from the band Death (who sadly passed away from cancer, a few months after the concert) and again in 2007.\n\nForbidden has not performed or released any new material since 2012, however guitarist Craig Locicero stated in an interview that they are still under contract with Nuclear Blast, however, while there are no plans to do anything, never say never.\n\nCHECK OUT THE VIDEO BELOW FOR “STEP BY STEP”\n\nHappy Friday Metalheads. Hope you all had a great week. Yesterday I posted a blog about a new interview with Dan Lorenzo on “It’s All About the Riff” which you can re-read here.\n\nFor today’s Metal Rewind I’ve resurrected the post I did last year on one of my all-time favorite bands called Hades founded by Dan. Formed in 1978, Hades began playing the circuit and released their 7″ EP “Deliver Us From Evil” in 1982. After a few lineup changes, the band handed out some demos and rehearsal tapes throughout the underground scene and interviewed with some local fanzines in the NY/NJ area to get their name out.\n\nHades was then soon heard on the Megaforce compilation “Born To Metalize” and Metal Blade’s “Metal Massacre VI.” This led to Torrid Records signing the band and the label released their first full-length album “Resisting Success” in 1987.

Currently, Dan and Jimmy Schulman are in Vessel of Light along with Ron Lipnicki and Nathan Opposition. Alan Tecchio is working on several solo projects and the rest of the band are working on several different projects on their own.\n\nThe first time I heard Hades was about 10 years ago when a friend was playing “Live On Location” and from the minute I heard “The Leaders?” I was blown away.
