        "text": "Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel just announced a new book, Swing of the Blade: More Stories from Metal Blade Records.\n\nThe book is the follow-up to Brian Slagel’s 2017 book For the Sake of Heaviness, which takes a look at how Slagel, as a California teen with a passion for metal built the label into what it is today. The new book features more anecdotes, bands, and insights from Slagel on the early days of metal.\n\nThe book also features a foreword from Kerry King, and like Slagel’s previous work, is part memoir, part inside look at a metal business. He goes into detail about the label’s dealings with bands such as Metallica, Armored Saint, King Diamond, and more, throughout the last 40 years.\n\nMetal Blade Records was initially founded in LA in 1982, and since then, have helped launch bands like Metallica, Slayer, Armored Saint, Fates Warning, GWAR, Cannibal Corpse, Amon Amarth, Whitechapel, The Black Dahlia Murder, Cattle Decapitation, and many more.\n\nAmazon‘s pre-orders for Swing of the Blade: More Stories from Metal Blade Records are now live HERE:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Swing-Blade-Stories-Metal-Records/dp/B0BQZMTJY1/\n\nIn support of the book, Metal Blade Records will be launching their own exclusive preorder bundle that will include a bookmark, patch, 40th anniversary medal, and signed bookplate, for a limited time only."
