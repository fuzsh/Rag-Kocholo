        "text": "...and the best stories are told in chapters. Formed to release albums from the burgeoning California metal scene in the '80s, Metal Blade, over these last 40 years, has persevered by always staying with the times, capturing the cutting edge of metal as it splintered and evolved into many disparate strands. This Anthology charts the label's deep catalog of the most cutting, powerful metal albums of all time, with eight albums taking you from Metal Blade's scrappy '80s to the chart-topping '10s, with points in-between. Released with a podcast that tells the story of Metal Blade from the label's artists and founder to guide you on this four week journey through these hard-hitting albums.\n\nEngineered to Shred\n\nTOP-TIER AUDIO MASTERING\n\nThe eight albums in this Anthology were lacquered from the highest-quality digital sources by Barry Grint at Alchemy Mastering at AIR and pressed on 180g splatter vinyl at GZ. Housed in heavyweight direct-to-board jackets, these albums sound, look, and feel as heavy as ever.\n\nExclusive Podcast & Liner Notes\n\nGet the Metal Blade Story From People Who Were There\n\nOur podcast series features interviews with Metal Blade founder Brian Slagel, and many of the bands behind the albums in this VMP Anthology. Hosted by metal writer J. Bennett.\n\nIncluded in this box you’ll find a very special liner notes booklet, written by J. Bennett, with interviews with Brian Slagel, the founder of the label. The booklet also comes with photos of the bands featured, from Metal Blade’s archives."
