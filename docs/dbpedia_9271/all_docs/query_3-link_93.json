He also managed banks in Holyoke, Colorado, Strasburg, Colorado, and Thermopolis, Wyoming.\n\nBeyond his wife and family, his greatest passions were hunting, fishing, golf, camping, and painting. His hunting and fishing pursuits took him all over the world, including Alaska, Canada, Mexico, and several countries in Africa.\n\nHe was blessed with a magnetism that drew people to him because he was genuinely interested in their lives and not judgemental.
