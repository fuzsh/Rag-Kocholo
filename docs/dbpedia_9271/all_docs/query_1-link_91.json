Over eight episodes, we’ll celebrate the re-release of The Black Album (“Enter Sandman,” “Nothing Else Matters”), and the incredible band that made it. This is more than a “Making Of” look at the album. It’s the story of James, Lars, and Kirk — not just how the album got made, but why.\n\nThrough four studio albums, Metallica established themselves as the most successful and respected band in metal.
