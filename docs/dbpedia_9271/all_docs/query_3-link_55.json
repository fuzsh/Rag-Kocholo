        "text": "Funeral Services will be on Friday, February 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM at the Church of Christ in Sargent, NE with Pastor Marty Robbins officiating. Burial will follow in the Gates Cemetery at Gates, NE. Memorials are suggested to the Church of Christ Building Fund. A visitation will take place on Thursday, February 15th from 4:00 to 6:00 pm at the Church of Christ in Sargent. Govier Brothers Mortuary are in charge of arrangements. Online condolences may be left at www.govierbrothers.com\n\nMelvin Slagle was born May 3, 1929, in Sargent to Ralph and Naoma (Huffman) Slagle. He passed away on February 10, 2024, at Bryan Memorial in Lincoln at the age of 94. Melvin graduated from Sargent Public School in 1947. In May of 1950, he married Jeanette (Gibson), and they had two children, Cheryl and Mark.\n\nMelvin was hard-working and determined. When he was interested in a subject, he studied it and asked questions. Melvin and Jeanette, along with Mark, developed and improved their Angus herd over the years they were in business. Melvin was a visionary cattleman, and seeing the need for larger Angus cattle, bought a selection of cows from LeRoy Erdmann that carried these traits. In 1982, ’83, and ’84, they won the Grand Champion Angus Carload at the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado. The summers were spent farming and caring for the cattle, and in the winter, they settled a ½ mile south of their home in their sale barn, calving out their herd.\n\nFor a time, Melvin partnered with both Cheryl and Bernard Ritchie and Mark in agriculture. While in his 50s, Melvin “retired” and moved off the ranch west of Sargent. This allowed Melvin and Jeanette the opportunity to travel, but Melvin remained very involved in the activities on the ranch. They later built a vacation home in Ouray, CO. They loved the mountains. In 2002, they built their last home on the river near Walworth to return to the country where he was the happiest.\n\nMelvin served as a mentor to area people getting started in farming and cattle. He loved strategizing on all aspects of agriculture from developing land, farming practices, adding pivots, picking out bulls, watching the markets, and attending sales. Melvin was a director of the Sargent Irrigation District for many years and a lifetime member of the American Angus Association. He had a creative side and would spend hours working on a pottery wheel, making everything from coffee cups to vases to pie plates to serving dishes. He would create the pieces, and Jeanette would add decorative details. His pottery pieces are truly works of art. They gifted many pieces to his family and friends.\n\nMelvin’s faith deepened while attending the Church of Christ in Sargent, and he accepted Jesus as his Savior. He was actively exploring options for a new Fellowship Hall for the church at the time of his passing. Memorials are suggested to the Sargent Church of Christ for the Building Fund. Melvin was preceded in death by his parents, brother Don Slagle, son Mark Slagle, and great-grandson Ty Vincent. He is survived by his wife - Jeanette, daughter - Cheryl (Bernard) Ritchie, daughter-in-law - Kristin Slagle; 7 grandchildren – Angela (Scott Dixon) Vincent, Brian (Leah) Ritchie, Renee (Monte) Taylor, Corri (Spencer) Keefe, Bridget Slagle, Vivian Slagle, Melissa Slagle; 9 great-grandchildren – David (Oceane) Vincent, Wade (Savannah) Vincent, Lucy (Justin) Machard, Andrew (Elena) Ritchie, Chandler (Sadie) Ritchie, Callie Hansen, Jackson (Abby) Taylor, Quinten Taylor, Kaelyn Taylor and 4 great-great-grandchildren – Aiden Ritchie, Oliver Taylor, Logan Ritchie, and soon to arrive - Baby Taylor."
