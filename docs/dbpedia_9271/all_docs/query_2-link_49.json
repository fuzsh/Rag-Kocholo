        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from The Metallica Report on Spotify. The week of August 23, 2023 on The Metallica Report...  Steffan and Renee check in with Robert for his thoughts on night one in Texas, just moments after he left the incredibly energetic AT&T Stadium! And with LA on the M72 horizon, the West Side native talks about his upbringing steeped in beach and skate culture and his later-found appreciation for the East Side.  Next, we stay in LA but flash back to Metallica’s early days with Metal Blade Records president, Brian Slagel, for a first-hand account of the excitement (and errors!) surrounding the band’s first break. And finally, we hear the first installment of our newest feature, Crew Tips, kicking off with Foster, the woman who transforms backstage at each venue into the band’s home away from home.  The Metallica Report - your official, weekly guide for all things Metallica, straight from the source. New episode every Wednesday.
