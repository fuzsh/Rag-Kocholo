        "text": "Mike was born and raised in The Bronx, NY. He has worked in film, video, and television production since the late 90's, working at the Howard Stern Show for eight years and starting his own production company, M.A.S. Productions Inc. Mike has filmed and edited music videos for John Carpenter, Fozzy, and Charred Walls of the Damned. He also filmed John Russo's latest feature, My Uncle John is a Zombie.\n\n​Being a fan of both heavy metal and horror, Mike felt it was time to make a documentary exploring the reasons why the two genres go hand in hand. For The History of Metal and Horror, Mike also serves as producer, writer, director of photography, and editor.\n\nSocials: @themetalhorror\n\nVeteran actor and horror/sci-fi genre icon Michael Berryman is a native of Los Angeles, California. He was born prematurely with Hydrochrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia, a rare condition leaving him with no sweat glands, hair, fingernails or teeth. Michael's father was renowned neurosurgeon Sloan Berryman and his mother, Barbara, was a Registered Nurse. Michael as a young child had extensive cranial reconstruction @ Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. Michael took all these challenges and turned them into a golden career in film and television, thanks to legendary film director George Pal discovering Michael (who at the time owned and worked at a gift shop/art gallery in Venice, California.)\n\nGeorge Pal cast Michael in the Western DOC SAVAGE, then shortly after that Milos Forman cast Michael in the Academy Award winning film ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.\n\nBerryman went on to star as PLUTO in Wes Craven's cult classic THE HILL'S HAVE EYES. Additionally, Berryman has appeared in such films as WEIRD SCIENCE, STAR TREK IV, ARMED RESPONSE, CUT AND RUN, SOLAR CRISIS, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, etc. He also has appeared in more main-stream roles, such as the comedy SPY HARD and family favorite SCOOBY DOO. Michael's many television credits include TALES FROM THE CRYPT and X FILES. Michael Berryman portrays a gamut of characters, ranging from evil, dangerous and creepy to wise, gentle, sage, mystical, whimsical, comedic and even angels. Michael is an adored favorite of horror and sci-fi movie fans worldwide.\n\nMichael and his wife Patty own and run a farm in Northern California where he and his wife have walnut, apple, pear, cherry, persimmon and plum orchards, where they also raise their beloved horses. Michael enjoys baking fresh fruit pies.\n\nMost recently, Michael stars with Edward Furlong in the feature film BELOW ZERO, as well as horror/ thrillers EREBUS, SELF STORAGE, starring opposite Eric Roberts, RED AND YELLA KILL A FELLA, ARMY OF THE DAMNED and the horror/comedy SMOTHERED. Michael will also star in the television series HELL HUNTERS (based on the popular comic book) as well as the series HELL’S KITTY.\n\nMANAGER: Judy Fox 310/277-9393 judyfoxptm@msn.com\n\nKnights of The Black, an extreme Metal band from The Bronx, New York, consists of fanatical fans of both extreme music and the world of horror alike. Each member is a veteran to both their instrument as well as the New York Metal scene, having been in New York musical outfits ranging from Irate, Afflitus, and The Judas Syndrome. The bands members are: Phil “Vibez” (Vocals; Formerly of Irate/The Judas Syndrome), Tom “Warchild” Tulotta (Bass; Founder of Metal Jacket, formerly of Afflitus/The Judas Syndrome), Nando “Redrum” (Lead Guitar; formerly of Irate/Dawgrum and previous collaborations with MOP) and Jay “Vibez” (Lead Guitar). Having officially been founded in 2020, the group of artists seek to pay homage to the realm of horror films through loud, fast, and technically inclined metal majesty.\n\nWith the band mostly having grown up in the ‘80s, they are no strangers to the golden era of both mainstream and independent sources of horror/sci-fi films. Half of the band also annually attend cons/festivals such as Monster Mania, Connecticut Horrorfest, New Jersey Horror Con, Film Festival, and more. The combination of growing up with love and passion for the most intense and iconic terrors in film, as well as the knowledge gained from the insight shared from many of the movie’s actors, fuel a major influence on the band's musical works. Music by the band is now featured in The History of Metal and Horror.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/knightsoftheblack/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/knightsoftheblack"
