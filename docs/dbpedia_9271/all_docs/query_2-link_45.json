        "text": "Lars biography - Chapter 3\n\nForming Metallica\n\nIn England, Lars had experienced heavy metal—the music, the atmosphere and the people behind it. His motivation was stronger than ever, his focus sharpened all the same. Having finally given up on a tennis or any other top-level sport career, Lars could start a band with a good conscience. There was also a cultural dimension—or mission, even—to it for the young man: the spread of heavy metal in its essence. It was decidedly lacking at the moment in the US, particularly in the Los Angeles area.\n\nWhen Lars returned “home” to California, he was kindled with a spark to finally have a band started. There was just one detail to take care of: schooling.\n\n“Having been in Europe and England for three months and been so close to Diamond Head and Motorhead, I was really pumped up. I was fucking ready to go back and make a band,” Lars confirms. “But there was still the school issue. There were like 4 or 5 schools in the county we lived in, and among them was a so-called continuation school for all those who didn’t fit in or couldn’t go to the other schools. It was called Back Bay High School—and the cool thing about it was that you could have your own schedule. You had all those things to pass, learn and deal with, but you could make it more or less run by your own schedule, and that suited me quite perfectly. So I could go to Back Bay High School to get an high school diploma while still keeping up with the other things I was keen on.\n\nSo then I sat there and I thought, ‘What the hell do I do now!?’”\n\nThe answer to that question would (almost) give itself.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Lars’s good friend Brian Slagel had also spent his summer surrounded by heavy metal, albeit with a more concrete and creative direction. Slagel worked daily in an ordinary record store, but also worked for his favorite music to gain widespread support from the indies. In his spare time, Slagel was the redactor of fanzine “The New Heavy Metal Review” and promoted the local club shows. In addition to that, he was working on a project that would integrate elements from all of his pursuits—a compilation with new young american metal bands. Slagel had made an agreement with a few distributors that if he could get enough relevant bands and songs together, the compilation Metal Massacre I on Brian Slagel’s own label, Metal Blade Records, would be possible.\n\nLars Ulrich: “I was going around saying that now I \"played in a band” and everything, and he was thinking of doing a compilation LP with the coolest new bands in L.A., which of course were few. He promised me a spot on the compilation he intended to make if I ever put a band together.\n\nSo now I had to get something up and running. Today there’s a lot of underground stuff with self-produced albums, but back then it was a major thing to just get on an album.“\n\nWhen Lars heard of Brian Slagel’s Metal Massacre project, he responded promptly. He had this idea that others may also find it essential to get on a record, and this way, maybe could he lure this very shy and reluctant James Hetfield into forming a band together. In any case, Lars promised Slagel he would form \"a band” and have an original song for the Metal Massacre album, which was a requirement for all the bands participating. Slagel promised in turn to reserve a spot on the record for “Lars’s band”.\n\nThen, Lars called James Hetfield.\n\n“Yeah, I thought there was something about that James Hetfield guy,” Lars says, “so I called him and said: 'My friend has a reserved spot on his record, if I can put a band together. So if you want, we form a band, write a song, then our band gets on the album. And then we take it from there!’\n\nEverything James had done with Hugh Tanner had fallen apart, so Hetfield was ready to try and do something new. James had graduated high school in June and simultaneously moved in with bassist Ron McGovney up in Norwalk, where they rehearsed. We started hanging out together every day in October '81.\n\nThe falling cymbal had been forgotten—or was at least just a minor detail,” Lars adds.\n\nDespite his skepticism about the little man with the funny accent and the loose cymbal, it would have been very difficult to get around such an opportunity for James, a young and avid metal fan, who like Lars grew up listening to heavy metal since childhood.\n\nWhen James Hetfield (born August 3rd 1963) was about eight years old, he sneaked into his brother David’s room to listen to the first Black Sabbath LP, which really caused the curious little James to be drawn to the dark forces of metal.\n\nJames Hetfield spoke about Black Sabbath with this author: “It’s the best album in the entire world. Hehe. The cover, which I love, scared my sister senseless. And that music… My brother, who’s ten years older than me, had his own room with his own vinyl player. So I always sneaked in there and took this album out, put it on—got me into trouble. Many people wouldn’t have that in their home. I remember I had some friends visiting, we listened to the album and one of them said: 'Uh, did your mom really give you permission to like Black Sabbath?’ Haha. But Tony Iommi can write those really heavy riffs. For me he’s the ultimate guitar player.” (Mix nr. 4, April 1997)\n\nIn 1978, his brother took James to his first concert—Aerosmith and AC/DC—and the 15 year old James seriously enjoyed the experience, no less than the noise from the fans. He wanted to do this more than anything in the world.\n\nWhen he was little, James learned how to play the piano with his mother. He tried some different instruments later on, sneaking into the family garage where his brother rehearsed. Schooling gave him his first guitar, a Gibson SG that he painted black so it looked like the guitar of his hero, Tony Iommi. As a kid, James began to play in a band called Obsession, with friends from the Downey East Middle School in the L.A. district of Downey. James later played in bands such as Phantom Lord or Leather Charm, primarily playing cover songs (both with Hugh Tanner on guitar, and the latter with Ron McGovney on bass). Gradually, however, James started wanting to write his own songs rather than just hammer through the otherwise good Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy classics, but his bandmates didn’t share that desire to compose original songs.\n\nAnd that’s when Lars came into the picture–he was okay with original songs, and the two guys shared music magazines and sources of inspiration. Lars took care of the agreement with the record company. It didn’t matter that much to James that this 'Lars Oilrig’ probably had more enthusiasm and determination than technique and talent.\n\nThe two teenagers were obviously different, on a social and personal level: Lars grew up in an artistic, free and bohemian home in Hellerup–while James, who grew up in L.A., was the son of a country-music-loving truck driver from Nebraska and an artistically gifted but very religious mother who–out of love–often took her son with her to church, even if he’d rather have spent his Sunday under the covers.\n\nLars still had both his parents, lively parents with great vision, and great activities. James went through a traumatic childhood–his father leaving the house, followed by James’s many conflicts with his sister and, shortly before he met Lars, the early death of their sick mother. James was still just a kid that a dead mother and tragedy filled with guilty feelings which will characterize him many years later (which was kind of reflected on in different Metallica songs, we’ll go back to this later). James thus spent his teenage years living with his brother David, leaving the house after graduating high school and–as previously stated–moving with bassist Ron McGovney.\n\nSo the behavioral and socio-cultural differences between the two young men were obvious enough. But Lars and James were still able to get along thanks to the shared enjoyment in their first concrete musical task: writing a song for the Metal Massacre album.\n\n“We wrote that song, 'Hit The Lights’,” Lars says. “It was a combination of two things: a song James had written back when he was in Leather Charm, and an outro–in the second half of the song–that I had once composed in a week or two with some rookies I had matches with. So we put 'Hit The Lights’ together, and recorded it in Ron McGovney’s house.”\n\nA characteristic of Lars and James’s recent behavior was to put the bassist slightly on the side in this rather spontaneously formed band.\n\n“Ron may have not been officially in the band, but when he was there he could play bass and hang out with us,” Lars comments, confirming that the one playing bass on the first version of 'Hit The Lights’ was James. James couldn’t play the solo for the song, though. Back then, he wasn’t so focused on his guitar playing, and put more energy and work into his singing. So the band had to get hold of someone to play the solo, essential on a heavy metal composition. Like most things in this project, it was done spontaneously. Lars and James met guitarist Lloyd Grant on their way to Brian Slagel’s studio, and asked him to record a solo.\n\n“Yeah, he came over,” Lars confirms. “He played his solo, and it was good enough. So we gave the tape to Brian Slagel.”\n\nBrian Slagel was impressed with what he heard: “Wow, it was really amazing. I couldn’t believe what they’d done together,” was Brian’s first spontaneous reaction (Chris Crocker, “The Frayed Ends Of Metal”, 1993) to the speeded up discharge of energy, the fastest part of Metal Massacre.\n\nYet there was a slight problem with the production of “Hit The Lights”. Brian had to spend 50 dollars more from his small budget on a technician who could adjust the scraped sound of the song. Lars was his friend, though, and Brian actually seemed to feel really good about the track.\n\n“It was really 'garage’,” Lars remembers. “Compared to the other bands it sounded like crap, but there really was some energy and some honesty that made up for the lack of technique. 'Production’–that was a really big word back then, he he!”\n\nNow he was in charge of a small, last-resort group. A band name was absolutely necessary to be part of the compilation, and Lars quickly had very good suggestions. The legend says–and it ’s actually close to the truth–that Lars had been hanging out with a metal fan from San Francisco named Ron Quitana, who was working hard to put together a heavy metal fanzine. Ron showed Lars his list of (im)possible names for the fanzine, and among those was the visionary name “Metallica”–not for the fanzine, but Lars’s own band (if he’d ever put that in motion, one beautiful day). Lars was nice enough to also suggest a name to Ron, “Metal Mania”.\n\nAnd so those were the names of the metal underground projects on the American West Coast–and Metallica fans can probably rejoice about the choice of name for the band. Not only because the name Metallica was so heavy, but also because a couple of other names on Ron Quitana’s list were horrifying choices such as Bleeder, Blitzer, Grinder or Thunderfuck, and the latter was–for a short period–Lars’s favorite.\n\nBut the band’s name, Metallica–that was something new. So new, it was printed as “Mettallica” on the Metal Massacre I record. The newest members’ names were also misspelled; Lloyd Grant was “Llyod Grant” and Ron McGovney was “Ron McGouney”. They couldn’t do anything about it, though.\n\nBrian Slagel explains (in Putterford & Russell, “Metallica: A Visual Documentary”): “All I could do was shrug, apologize to the guys and send it as it was. I had spent my $2000, or whatever it cost, I’d spent everything on the album, and that was it. Of course I didn’t think it was important then.”\n\nThe band still lacked the most important element for any respectable heavy metal band, however: live performances. Line-up-wise, Metallica was not quite into place. Lars and James had already set themselves as the central axis of the band, while Ron McGovney took position on the sidelines, and Lloyd Grant had merely been a hired hand. In an attempt to get their first gig, Metallica recorded their first demo tape, which consisted of “Hit The Lights” and two covers of Lars’s beloved NWOBHM-scene: “Killing Time” (Sweet Savage) and “Let It Loose” (Savage).\n\n“Lloyd played the solos on that first demo tape before we got ourselves a solo guitarist. So he was partly in Metallica, but he really couldn’t keep up rhythm-wise,” Lars comments.\n\nJames really wanted to stick to his role of singer rather than guitarist. He would only play rhythm guitar until he and Lars found capable replacement. Again the ads in The Recycler were there to help mister Hetfield and Ulrich.\n\nLars turns back the clock to January/February 1982: “One day my phone rang, and it was some guy called Dave Mustaine who’d seen our ad in The Recycler. We were still looking for a guitarist.\n\nAnd Dave Mustaine…he was just straight-forward: 'I have all my gear, I’m really good, I have my own driver, I have my own photographer, and I have…’\n\nHe blurted it all, blah blah blah, then I called James and I said: 'We have to meet this guy because he sounds like he’s out of his mind but in a good way, you know!’\n\nDave came up to Norwalk with all his gear. He was very likeable, and he was very charming. At the time most of us were shy 18-year-old boys who hadn’t been with any girl yet, he he…and it’s true, I even lost my virginity to one of his ex-girlfriends!\n\nWe were such losers. We were starting to be real heavy metal boys with rivet bracelets, but Hetfield especially was so fucking shy. Dave had chest hair, looked good, was a potdealer in Huntington Beach and he had a whole crowd around him. He’d already been in a band called Panic. They played a few gigs and had a little bit of a following. So when Dave got in the band, the level suddenly went up. My mom thought he was beautiful. He talked to her very easily and was really charming. 'How are you doing, Ms. Ulrich?’\n\nAt the time, Hetfield still couldn’t look people in the eye, he was really shy and had such a hard acne it left scars all over his face. And Ron McGovney wasn’t really star material, he he. And here comes Mustaine with his chest hair and his gumption.\n\nHe was great, with his own amp, a pair of guitars and shit. He didn’t know Diamond head, but he was very attentive and learned new things easily. I made him listen to \"Am I Evil” and he got it in ten minutes. He learned it completely backwards and upside down. He really had a natural talent for playing guitar and a will to understand things. He understood downpicking, which no one in the US knew about.\n\nPersonally, it was a little weird during the first few months. I lived in Newport Beach, and he lived 10 minutes from me in Huntington Beach, so I had to pick him up everyday. Everytime I came by and picked him up at his apartment, so he waited with his court. He was sitting on the sofa inside his apartment, and there was that crowd of like ten people around him. He was like a mini-Scarface. He just sat there and sold his various bags of pot.\n\nIt was a little strange for James and me initially, because clearly Dave had joined our band, but when I came over, he said to his court: 'This is my new drummer, Lars!’ I didn’t really get it. He also said 'My band Metallica!’ Wow!\n\nThere was something cool about him, he really had a personality. And charisma. He had all sorts of chicks around him, and my mother had a little crush on him.\n\nSo we sat and I drowned him in NWOBHM music. But it was also one of my first encounters with some of the more conservative tendencies in the US. Me and James were totally obsessed with Venom, whose album came out in Autumn 81, and so I went to give the record to Dave, but he didn’t want it…it was Satanism! He was kinda scared–at first. But aside from Venom, all the music I played for him was totally cool.“\n\nWith this charismatic red-haired guy (born on September 13th, 1961 in La Mesa, California), his great enthusiasm for heavy metal and his solid grip on guitar playing, Metallica could not only have solos on their Diamond Head tracks, but also expand their compositional horizons and look forward to their first concert.\n\nIt was pretty difficult to assert themselves as a force of heavy metal in Los Angeles in the year 1982–even with the solo-playing and energetic Mustaine in the line-up. The problem in Los Angeles back then was that the hard rock scene had become more and more dominated by the melodious, glam-rock oriented wave of softer heavy metal. It was hard to get a gig in town, partly because most clubs demanded that bands played original material, partly because Metallica’s music was too fast and punk for metal clubs, and too metal for punk clubs (these diverging elements would very soon emerge as a highly successful symbiosis). Metallica solved the first problem, however, by not telling anyone that their set–apart from \"Hit The Lights”–consisted of covers from bands like Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, or Sweet Savage–all bands that no one outside of the NWOBHM inner circle knew about yet. The other problem–to get a club gig–was solved thanks to a massive network and by jumping on the first occasion that presented itself. And the first time was on March 14th, 1982, at RadioCity in Anaheim. A debut show that started unintentionally comically when Dave broke a string during the opening number, “Hit The Lights”, and all of the inexperienced band went backstage to get his problem fixed.\n\nThe schematic Lars wrote in his log, a green school booklet called “Gigs With Metallica”, what impression Metallica’s first show left on him: “1st gig ever. Very nervous. Only band. Dave broke a string on the first song. Played so-so!!! Went down pretty good.”\n\nLater in the log, it says that “around 75” spectators saw the nine-tracks-long set (each and every one of these about 75 enthusiasts probably later acknowledged their presence with a certain pride). Lars also noted that the band received a payment of $15 for their debut gig.\n\nSome time later, Lars’s heroes, the English NWOBHM stars Saxon, needed a support act for their two headliner shows at the legendary rock club Whisky A Go-Go on Sunset Boulevard, at the west end of Hollywood. Metallica showed up, not intimidated by their first negative performance in Anaheim. They played their two support sets on the same day.\n\nThe log book recounts the first show: “Supporting SAXON. No soundcheck. Sound was awful. Dave out of tune all the time. Played great myself, but the band as a whole sucked. Went down ok.” And for the other set: “Supporting SAXON. Great sound this time. Dave and me played great. Ron & James so-so. Went down pretty good. Had a good time, but never met SAXON.”\n\nA little month later, Metallica played for 50 people at The Concert Factory in Costa Mesa, halfway between downtown L.A. and San Diego. Metallica appeared as a quintet for the first time, as a friend named Brad Parker played rhythm guitar, but without much success. For the next gig at Lars’s school, Backbay High in Costa Mesa–in the auditorium, during the students’ lunch break–Metallica was once again a quartet. The notes from that night don’t talk about a memorable evening, though. The page for May 25th, 1982, was marked by bad vibes: “Absolutely a day to forget!! Played like shit went down like shit and sounded like shit. Really awful.”\n\nThe shows in Anaheim, Hollywood and Costa Mesa had not given Metallica an explosive start in live performances, but those gigs certainly didn’t crush their ambition, and before long, the always ambitious and aggressive Lars Ulrich was on Brian Slagel’s heels. Lars thought Metallica definitely had to make a whole album. Brian disagreed. He had enough work running his record label, but also had a low cash income (partly because Metal Massacre I was to be released on June 14th, 1982–in 4500 copies) and thus couldn’t finance an album production estimated at $8000. Instead, Lars and Metallica had to moderate their ambition a bit, and follow the more natural path to an album production and record company deal–that is, through a demo tape.\n\nOr rather a decent one. After Dave Mustaine’s arrival, Metallica had recorded yet another demo tape, this time with a series of compositions, on the so-called Power Metal demo (named after the demo network attached to Lars’s business card “Metallica – Power Metal”).\n\nBut a new and well-produced–or at least decent–demo would also cost money. With good help from fate, though, Metallica got their studio time paid elsewhere. A punk-enthusiast named Kenny Kane, from the independant record company High Velocity, had listened to a recording of one of Metallica’s performances. It proved to be good enough for Kenny Kane, who wanted to produce fast, crude, clattering “punk noise” EPs. Kane, however, was disappointed when he heard the finished recording from the studio. These songs sounded “too heavy metal” to him, and why didn’t they record the songs he’d heard live??\n\n“Well, they were just some covers,” the band said.\n\nWell, the studio had already been paid, so Metallica could just take their newly demo tape home with them, while High Velocity Records dropped the publication of the proposed EP.\n\nAnd that demo tape was good enough to take home–and send around the world. And it really began for Lars Ulrich and his band Metallica in the month of July 1982.\n\nAn Oath to Heavy Metal\n\nThe music on Metallica’s demo tape was pretty fast. Six original riff-based, raw, agressive songs played at a frantic pace, with references to both Diamond Head and Motorhead, either musically or in the titles which bore the imprint of the four guys’ oath to heavy metal as an enjoyable manifestation: “Motorbreath”, “Seek And Destroy”, “Jump In The Fire”, “Phantom Lord” and the gung heavy metal anthem “Metal Militia”. Obviously, there was also “Hit The Lights”, with a new solo from Dave Mustaine.\n\nInspiration from NWOBHM music was clear in Metallica’s first compositions and their fast tempo, but Metallica was also beginning to work with a whole new inspiration–not from England, but from Royal Copenhagen, where a certain Kim Bendix Petersen (aka singer and composer “King Diamond”) from Hvidovre Street and René Krolmark (aka guitar player and composer “Hank Shermann”) had begun to create a completely new and groundbreaking kind of heavy metal.\n\nLars Ulrich says: “The funny thing is that Heavy Metal Ken sent me some demos from some guys who made the album 1980. They were called Brats, and in 1981 they started to become Mercyful Fate. In 1981, Ken was their manager (and found the band’s name), so I got the demos sent to me, and those were really, really something. It was a blend of Judas Priest and other heavy stuff, and we just thought it was really cool. Mercyful Fate, Motorhead, Diamond Head and Venom–they were our kernel of inspiration then.\n\nWhile 'Motorbreath’ was more inspired by Motorhead, 'Seek And Destroy’ was the first appreciative nod to Mercyful Fate. It was inspired by Mercyful Fate early songs like 'Doomed By The Living Dead’ and 'Corpse Without Soul’.”\n\nIt was the definitive demo tape, so Metallica began to take shape, composition and style, and the handful of frantic songs were assembled under the title of No Life Til Leather, like in the first sentence of the very first song (apart from James’s initial “Woooarw”, of course): “No life til leather/we’re gonna kick some ass tonight/We got the metal madness/when our fans start screaming/its right/when we start to rock/we never want to stop again,” and then the echoing chorus with James’s shrill voice: “Hit The Lights…Hit The Lights…Hit The Lights”.\n\nMetal, the music, the lifestyle and the ecstasy, was the centerpiece in every second of No Life Til Leather. With that demo tape, a well-oiled and well-known pivot started in the band: the aggressive promotional and marketing machine, personified in Lars Ulrich. He would simply distribute the tape in any place where there were metal fans who could pass the word–or tape a copy–and maybe even mention the tape and the band in some metal magazine (or fanzine). These were Lars’s efforts to spread the word about Metallica back in 1982. More than enough to score a record deal. However, the first real laudatory Metallica article had already been published in the month of April 1982, after the release of the Power Metal demo, in the fanzine Metal Mania (which could have been named “Metallica”).\n\n“Metallica have the potential to become U.S. metal gods,” journalist Patrick Scott wrote in an article in June 82, but this prophecy was mostly based on inspiration from an enthusiastic and friendly heavy metal-talk in the home of the talkative, enthusiastic Metallica drummer and spokesman–rather than on the music from the demo tapes.\n\nIn his campaign to spread the word about Metallica and the No Life Til Leather demo, Lars had by no means forgotten his metal hearth of the past few years: Copenhagen, and Ken Anthony in particular, who unconsciously helped inspire a band that he didn’t even know existed. The two Danish metal fans kept in touch roughly all the same despite the distance, but Ken was still terribly surprised when Lars called him to tell him about his latest musical passion.\n\n“We were talking on the phone one day, when he told me he was going to start playing music and got himself a drum kit. 'Yeah!? That’s awesome!’, I thought. And another day Lars called me and said: 'Hey, we’ve made a demo tape, wanna hear it?’ I said I’d like to, and I didn’t have it yet, No Life Til Leather. So he sent the tape to me with the words: 'My band–Metallica.’\n\nIt was very surprising to me. Drummer?? I didn’t think he could play drums, and I had no idea he had any sense of rhythm. We could freak out and play air guitar or air drums at my house, but that was it. And to even start a band…!?”\n\nOutside of the inner circle, ie. Brian Slagel and the local metal crow, Lars had actually been quite discreet about his interest in drums and his band ambitions. Ken Anthony wasn’t the only one to be surprised by Lars’s sudden activity in Metallica. During his stay with his idols Diamond Head, Lars hadn’t mentioned anything about his desire to play in a band, and at that time, he only had his first jam with James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner.\n\n“The funny thing is, he never said anything about starting a band, at the time,” Diamond Head guitarist Brian Tatler remembers (in Putterford & Russell, “Metallica: A Visual Documentary”, 1992). “(…) he used to talk about tennis all the time, and he never stopped talking about the bands he liked, but he never said anything about Metallica.”\n\nWhich underlines the significant degree of spontaneity in the concept of “Metallica”. It was indeed after his stay in England in summer 1981 that Lars really got the taste for himself to do something with drums and drum sticks. With music.\n\nWell, in the summer of 1982, the rumor about Lars and Metallica reached all the way to the tennis courts of Phistersvej in Hellerup. Stein Ulrich remembers playing with his uncle/godfather Torben one day, “and some people would come up to Torben and say: 'We heard Lars started to play music?’ When he was coming out of the locker room, they would ask him: 'Torben, you’re an old musician, you know your stuff, are those boys any good?’ To which Torben answered: 'Yeaaaah…yeaaaah…but the one who plays bass should play another instrument!’”\n\nIt was a truly good point from the old jazz-enthusiast and critic, who through the years would become his son’s judge for many early or pre-Metallica compositions. Ron was in fact the weakest link in the otherwise more and more powerful quartet, and only a few months would pass before Lars and James would find an alternative to the somewhat unmotivated and unengaged McGovney.\n\nNow, Metallica’s leading duo had new ideas for the line-up. James had previously chosen to play rhythm guitar until the band hired a second rhythm guitarist, so he could stay fully focused on his vocals. The issues were different in summer 1982, though.\n\nLars outlines the band’s thinking at that time: “What happened is that when James first started playing rhythm guitar, he was comfortable with it. It suited him so well, he had so much talent, and him and Mustaine were just so great together. So James said: ’Fuck it! Instead of me running around and singing, let’s try to find another singer! I play rhythm guitar, so I’ll be just like Malcolm Young or Rudolph Schenker.’\n\nSo for a few months in late summer 1982, we weren’t looking for a guitarist but a lead singer! We tried a few–no one famous, only local fans.\n\nAnd there was Armored Saint, the only other band in L.A. that played heavy metal our way. They were mostly inspired by Judas Priest and Iron Maiden and were more melodic than us, but they still were a little louder and heavier than the other bands. We played some gigs with them, and they were fucking funny. They had a singer called John Bush, and we thought he was brilliant. So we actually tried for several months to tell John that he should get his finger out of his ass and join the right heavy metal band instead of running around in some knight armor, and all that other shit they did in Armored Saint. But he didn’t want to hear any of it, because Armored Saint was bigger than us in L.A., and we actually supported them a few times. But we knew who were the real heavy metal guys there, so we didn’t care. We just told John he should join our band, but he didn’t want to. So Hetfield just kept on singing.”\n\nInstead of the addition of a new singer, two other gigs affected Metallica’s career path in the late summer 1982: one in the Hollywood club Whiskey A Go-Go, the other a spontaneous performance in the San Francisco club The Stone. The latter first.\n\n“Brian Slagel had lined up three bands to play in San Francisco, to promote the Metal Massacre record. And one of the three Metal Massacre bands, Cirith Ungol, cancelled 11 hours before,” Lars says.\n\n“We were nothing, we were just a joke, but Brian called us one or two days before the show, because he assumed we would be dumb enough to do whatever he wanted us to do: 'Do you guys wanna go up to San Francisco and open the show?’ We said 'yes!’, and that was simply lifechanging.\n\nThere we went and played in front 2-300 heavy metal freaks in San Francisco, and suddenly there was…WOW! People who knew the songs we were playing! There was a scene with people in denim jackets with badges and black Iron Maiden shirts instead of all that shit down in L.A. At that time, all that glam shit was starting in L.A.\n\nWhen we went off stage after 40 minutes, it had been like a lifechanging experience, and so we suddenly were all about San Francisco. It was the first time something of that level happened, so we started booking gigs up in San Francisco every month,” Lars remembers rather happily.\n\nAfter the groundbreaking concert, Metallica’s first real after-show party started. The band wasn’t busy driving the Ulrich’s light brown Pacer and the rented U-Haul trailer with their music gear home to Los Angeles. They stole a case of beer, and held a party in their little hotel, Sam Wong’s, a few blocks away from The Stone. Earlier in the day, the Metallica members had been arrested for wading around with open beer cans in hands, so the party stayed indoors. At the hotel, fan got autographs and took pictures, and Metallica sold their “Young Metal Attack” t-shirts.\n\nFurthermore, the gig at The Stone gave Metallica a positive concert review. In Northwest Metal #2, Brian Lew first wrote: “This was the night! The heaviest band of the U.S. of A., Metallica, rampaged into the City By The Bay and spred more havoc than the 1906 earthquake! (…) Their sheer intensity was incredible! Fusing the pile driving madness of Motorhead and Venom with their own insanity, the band devastated their audience with a non-stop, fast, and ultra-furious set of Heavy Metal.”\n\nIn his log, Lars enthusiastically noted: “First real great gig. Real 'bangers, real fans, real encores. Had a great fuckin weekend. Fucked up a lot on stage!!”\n\nMetal fans from the traditionally liberal and hippie town had embraced Metallica’s metal with banging heads and open arms. In L.A., the metal scene was dominated by the softer glam rock culture, while San Francisco was becoming the hotbed of heavy metal in America.\n\nAnd there was more to come. Almost silmutaneously with Metallica’s first show there, San Francisco revealed the charismatic bassist Cliff Burton to the drunk duo of James and Lars, during one of their countless evenings in Hollywood’s rock clubs.\n\nLars Ulrich: “We were at Whisky A Go-Go for the 'San Francisco Heavy Metal Night’, and one of the three bands playing that night was called Trauma. There we see that freak playing bass and headbanging. James and I had never seen anything like that. We weren’t down there to look for a bassist, but there began the hunt for Cliff Burton. The hunting was done a few months later.”\n\nThe indomitable and extroverted Lars immediately contacted the long-haired, wild and talented Cliff and suggested a “rehearsal” with Metallica, but Cliff was still focused on his commitment to Trauma in San Francisco. Thus Metallica had every reason to urgently book several shows in San Francisco, and Lars took care of notifying Cliff of their next appearance, this time at a “Metal Monday Night” concert on October 18th.\n\n“In November, we played a few gigs in San Francisco,” Lars says. “It was the legendary tour where we played an extra gig at Mabuhey Gardens (a club in downtown San Francisco, where actor Robin Williams had his first headlining stand-up in 1978, later a club for punk and new wave). And it was then that we began to fuck girls who came to the concerts. It was all really fun. So we learned to know that whole scene with hundreds of heavy metal fans.\n\nI remember an afterparty in some hotel on Lombard Street, where me and Dave Mustaine scored a few chicks together. It was the first time I was in a pile of bodies, there was someone on the bed, someone on the other bed, someone in the corner and someone in the closet. It was one of those times we would have only one motel room, then woke up the next morning with 20 people sleeping on the floor.\n\nBut it was just like a dream…it was just so cool. It was everything we’ve ever dreamed of and more.”\n\nThere were other problems around the corner, though. Not everyone shared the dream–or rather, not everyone was included in the dream.\n\nLars: “I don’t really remember what happened, but I think it was Ron McGovney’s girlfriend who overheard a conversation between me and James where we said something about Cliff. Anyway she was there and told Ron. He was all upset when he found out me and James had talked about Cliff behind his back. He got angry, said 'fuck you!’ and then he left. It was in the beginning of December, and Cliff hadn’t said yes yet, but I was really fighting for him, calling him every fucking day. The intensive he-must-join-our-band-now campaign had started.\n\nWhen McGovney left the band, Hetfield was kicked out of their house, so he moved in with Dave Mustaine down in Huntington Beach. We didn’t rehearse or anything. But between Christmas and the New Year '82, I finally convinced Cliff to come jam with us, so around the 27, 28 December, we went up to El Cerrito. We jammed in Mark Whitaker’s living room. He was the manager of Exodus, whom we had become good friends with and who had opened for us a few times in one of those Metal Monday shows. Mark was one of the King Shit guys, and me, James and Mustaine were allowed to stay up there for a few days. So then we had our jam with Cliff, and had a great time.\n\nWe went back to L.A., and after the New Year, Cliff called me and said he was in. I remember the conversation as if it was yesterday: 'Okay, I’ll join your band if you move to San Francisco. That’s the only condition!’ 'Okay,’ I said. 'We’ll be there in five weeks. I have to earn some cash and score some carpets!’”\n\nHalfway through the first jam session with Cliff, “Seek And Destroy”, neither Lars, James or Dave doubted that Cliff was the right man for Metallica–and that San Francisco would ultimately be the right base for the band. Cliff’s positive feedback was therefore the best news for Lars, James and Mustaine, who still had some things to do in L.A. before they could return to San Francisco.\n\nLars: “We had no place to rehearse or anything, so in January/February 1983, I had two routes for the morning newspaper. One was in the condo-complex, where I lived, and they were replacing all the large rugs. I remember James and Mustaine were out for a week going with me. We had James’s truck with us, and we grabbed all those used carpets which were thrown away in some giant containers.\n\nWe’d made a deal with Mark Whitaker, that if he became our manager, me and James could live together in one of his bedrooms. There was no room for Mustaine, he was kind of still…the 'outsider’. So Dave rented a room at Cliff’s grandmother’s instead.\n\nSo we threw all the used carpets and shit into the truck and in the middle of February, we moved to San Francisco. I waved my parents goodbye, and it was actually the first time I moved away from home.”\n\nLars’s farewell to his parents also meant a split in the little family who had been together since the frosty 2nd day of Christmas 1963 in Copenhagen.\n\nLars: “When I left, my father actually left too, and that weighed down on my mother. She had assumed they would grow old together and all that. So that periode was especially weird for her, with both me and my father suddenly leaving. It was very hard.\n\nI couldn’t really understand at the time, and perhaps wasn’t really aware of it. My dad thought that he had the responsability to provide for the family while the family was there, and while I was part of the family. The way I see it, it was understood that once I left home–which happened then–he wouldn’t be responsible for anything anymore. He had many other interests, with all his Buddhist studies and all those things he had begun to take an interest in.\n\nMy mom kept living in Newport Beach for a while, then moved around the region. She had friends there, and lived with one or another, perhaps hoping that I’d come back, or that Torben would come back at some point. It was a difficult time for her. I was so blind to all of that, it wasn’t something I understood as a 19 year old.\n\nI was just…going forward, 'now we should fucking start going around with Metallica!’ and all that.”\n\nTorben and Lone Ulrich never officially divorced, but Torben moved in with the nearly 30 years younger journalist from Seattle, Washington, Molly Martin. But his parents “always managed to remain friends,” Lars says.\n\nRecord Deal\n\nLars celebrated his 19th birthday on Christmas, and in the mid-February 1983 the only child finally left the nest permanently–and now found himself in some kind of collective. They named their new home “The Metallimansion”, a little house on a quiet street, more specifically at 3132 Carlson Blvd. in El Cerrito, north from the university of Berkeley (a district that was also the base for the bustling East Bay underground punk scene, with The Dead Kennedys in the lead).\n\nThe house’s garage, where they rehearsed, was decorated with used carpets and the obligatory egg trays. The walls were also decorated with Motorhead posters and hundreds of other metal posters. A Tuborg plate was placed opposite the doorframe in the living room, which was also the band’s party room.\n\nIn the Metallimansion there was constant rehearsing, jamming, partying, drinking–and writing. With Cliff Burton in the band, Metallica now consisted of four guys, each with his own creative input. Cliff contributed significantly, thanks to his basic musical background and knowledge of music theory and harmony.\n\nWhile Lars was eating chips and listening to NWOBHM records in Brondbyvester, and while the British punk revolution stole the headlines all over the world, the 16 year old student and bassist Clifford Lee Burton (born on February 10th 1962 in Castro Valley, California, the son of Ray, a highway engineer, and Jan Burton, a teacher/educator) was introduced to all sorts of musical styles—from classical to jazz–by a music teacher called Steve Doherty. The quiet but nice and friendly Cliff was always extremely attentive and prepared when he showed up for these music classes at his school, Castro Valley High, which he graduated from in 1980. Perhaps the most telling and really quite touching story about this young music freak originates from when he worked at the local motorized equipment rental store, Castro Valley Rentals. One morning, Cliff switched on all the lawnmowers and directed them as if they were an orchestra. It was at Castro Valley Rentals that Cliff, the youngest worker, got a lot of flack from his colleagues, partly because of his long hair. They never angered Cliff, who just smiled and answered that “someday he’d make money off his hair”.\n\nCliff wanted to be a musician, and joined the previously mentioned band Trauma immediately after his high school graduation. In high school, Cliff had already been in the band EZ Street, along with guitarist Jim Martin (later in Faith No More) and drummer Mike Bordin (later in Faith No More and Ozzy Osbourne, and a stand-in in the later reunited Black Sabbath). EZ Street played covers of classic bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Rolling Stones, beside their own tentative compositions.\n\nFrom their first meeting in 1978, Jim Martin was one of Cliff’s most important musical and social acquaintances. Along with a drummer named Dave Donato, they often jammed together in a deserted place in downtown San Francisco called Maxwell Ranch. It was an enjoyable haven for the three boys who could have beer, pot and long, long jam sessions there.\n\nThere was a lot of music in Cliff’s life, but no music touched him more deeply than the horror punk band The Misfits, whose logo he had tattooed on his arm. When he sat in his car and listened to his Misfits tapes, Cliff was always going crazy, pounding away at the steering wheel and spitting, screaming, headbanging his way through traffic. Sure, he loved his rock, his punk and his heavy metal, but he also loved Weather Report bassist Jaco Pastorius, and thought for certain that “Bach is God” (the classical composer, not the crazy frontman of Metallica’s later contemporary Skid Row). Cliff was also a fan of horror novelist H.P. Lovecraft, who wrote a series of horror novels in the 20’s and the 30’s. A literary input that would put its distinct stamp on some of the early songs.\n\nAs a person and as a musician, Cliff was exactly what Lars and James had been looking for. With this new line-up, Metallica triumphed at The Stone with two performances, on March 5th and 19th 1983, the last of which was immortalized by the first video recording of Metallica.\n\nAnd yet there was an emerging problem in the band: Dave Mustaine. He was responsible for the guitar solos and many of the things said on stage when the band performed; he was also the leader when it came to getting drunk, which of course happened pretty often with the band, but Mustaine always crossed the line. He was typically violent when everyone else was in a good mood, and often had fights with James–for personal reasons more than music disagreements.\n\nOne evening of March saw Lars chatting with James and Mark Whitaker, who had put Exodus’s latest demo tape in the frequently used player of the Metallimansion. Lars and James were well aware of Exodus, who had opened for Metallica a few times, but during the conversation Lars’s trained metal ears suddenly caught the well-timed guitar solos above Exodus’s fast and aggressive metal rhythms. His focus shifted immediately to the tape in the player. Lars and James agreed: this one guitarist, Kirk Hammett, had something special when it came to fast and aggressive heavy metal, the one Metallica played themselves.\n\n“It was pretty clear that fucking Kirk Hammett had something,” Lars recalls. “There was a really cool melodic side to his guitar-playing, the Schenker and UFO kind, and he seemed very reliable. There was nothing negative about him.”\n\nHowever, a little month would pass before Kirk would meet Lars and James and join Metallica.\n\nDave Mustaine knew nothing about it, but Metallica was definitely on its way for yet another line-up change.\n\nBut how was the band doing in the underground metal scene after Lars’s careful and ambitious distribution of the No Life 'Til Leather demo?\n\nAt home in his metal record shop, Ken Anthony grinned over his young heavy metal protégé now being in “his band” Metallica. In addition to his job at the metal shop, Ken Anthony was active himself–not as a musician, but as a manager for young Danish metal bands like Pretty Maids and the previously mentioned Brats and Mercyful Fate, among others. Ken distributed his bands’ demo tapes to record companies, and many of them actually scored a record deal. He had therefore built up a lot of knowledge and a solid network in the heavy metal world. However, Ken knew there was no way he had the money to involve himself commercially with a band with Metallica’s potential. Instead he contacted Denmark’s biggest heavy metal promoter at the time, Erik Thomsen.\n\n“I told him he should be careful, because there was a band with a Dane coming from the US that was going to be huge. But Erik didn’t believe it,” Ken Anthony recalls.\n\nInstead the demo tape caught the attention of a former stock broker who lived outside of New York City. His name was Jonny Zazula. Jonny Zazula (better known as “Jonny Z”) and his wife of many years, Marsha, were both tired of the Wall Street race and wanted to devote themselves to a more relaxed and fruitful life with a certain kind of personal fulfillment. The couple had made a deal with a record shop in The Route 18 Indoor Market in East Brunswick, New Jersey, where the two veteran music fans were allowed to have their own little in one corner of the shop. Jonny Z had played music himself, and Marsha had a great record collection. They both had their youth during the big rock revolution of the 60’s and had long been fans of pioneering rock bands like The Doors, The Grateful Dead and MC5, and of jazz artists like Chick Corea and George Benson. Soon the Zazula couple’s musical tastes would change and go in a much heavier direction.\n\nThe couple started with $180 worth of LPs on their shelf (ie. 21 LPs), but seven months later, they had for $80,000 worth of records in their business, now better known as “Rock'n'Roll Heaven”. Instead of focusing on the mainstream records than anybody could buy nationwide, the Zazulas chose to focus on heavy metal, especially from Europe. Rock'n'Roll Heaven thus quickly became known as heavy metal heaven for the hundreds of young metal fans who had nowhere else to go to buy their music or hang out, get some info and meet other fans. The old stock broker had simply established the East Coast’s leading product in heavy metal culture.\n\nThe couple’s entrepeneurship and interest in all the uprising and raw metal music grew gradually, and they got new ideas. Soon Jonny Z was also known as the booker of metal shows from New Jersey, from Manhattan to Brooklyn, and in his zeal Jonny even talked a little about the possibility of self-publishing some music, maybe even starting to be a manager for metal bands.\n\nThe record store was still there, though. The fans who came by to buy the latest albums liked to hang out in the cozy atmosphere, listen to some heavy music and share the latest infos from the scene. One afternoon, one of these customers came into the store with a tape. That fan had most likely bought the tape during a trip to California, and he found the music so phenomenal he just had to play it for the Zazulas in Rock'n'Roll Heaven.\n\nThe legend says Jonny Z promptly ran out of the store to find a phone booth and start the hunt for this obviously unsigned band. Legend also says Jonny Z then passed on his interest in Metallica to his old buddy and fanzine-editor Ron Quintana, who gave the heads up to Lars and the band in their Metallimansion, where there was a cool poster of guitarist Michael Schenker, but not a single phone.\n\nA good but overly dramatized account of this important part of Metallica’s career. At least Lars Ulrich remembers Jonny Z had no particular difficulty getting hold of him.\n\n“We had a phone in the Metallimansion, but there might have been some periods where the bill wasn’t paid, ha ha ha. But generally, when we had a phone it wasn’t super impossible to reach us,” Lars says, and continues with his version of their road to a record deal.\n\n“When Jonny Z called, he was really hooked on two things: he wanted us on the East Coast to play some concerts, and he wanted us on the East Coast for a possible record. We were fucking ready to travel a bit, and what made us even more interested was that he was going to have Venom come over and play in New York in April. We were big Venom fans.\n\nAt that time we were doing good in tape-trading and started getting fan mail from the East Coast. So we were totally hooked on getting started over there, and that Jonny Z guy sounded like a very interesting person. It was a chance we took. We hadn’t had a contract or anything.”\n\nMetallica was short on money but had plenty of ambition thanks to the good response No Life Til Leather and Jonny Z in particular had given them. The choice was obvious enough. On April 1st [note: Kirk says he got the call from the east coast on this date, so…they probably rented that U-Haul a bit earlier than that], the band rented a U-Haul and headed to the other side of America, more specifically to The Music Building in Queens, over 4,726 km away from the Metallimansion in El Cerrito.\n\nLars Ulrich: “Jonny Z had sent us some money–very little money, but just enough to rent a U-Haul and throw all of our stuff in it. In the back of the van, which was probably 5 to 6 feet long, we had our gear, suitcases and some cheap mattresses. It wasn’t posh at all. James and Dave were sitting up front and driving, while Cliff, Mark Whitaker and I were lying down and sleeping on those mattresses in the back, around all of our Marshall amps and my drum set. The only way we could get in and out was when the others opened the tailgate. We spent 12 hours in darkness as we drove away, with Cliff’s lighter as the only source of light. So we had some exciting and happy days from San Francisco to New York.”\n\nThere were also days where James, Lars, Cliff and Mark were pissed at the band’s troublemaker. Dave Mustaine was pretty drunk, even if he had to drive. In his drunkenness, he even drove the van into a snowdrift and picked up a fight with Mark.\n\nLars: “It was on this trip from West Coast to East Coast that we saw the darker side of Dave Mustaine, and where we decided that perhaps he was too unpredictable and too wild with his drinking and all those things. On one of the first days we met with Jonny Z, I had to tell him that perhaps he’d have to pay a trip back out of the East Coast for the band, or just one member of the band, because we thought we’d probably have to fire Dave.”\n\nThere was also another “practical problem”. The Zazula couple already had a few bands that occupied the space with the couple’s two children. Metallica initially moved into The Music Building, sharing the rehearsal room with a local New York band, Anthrax, which they very quickly became very good friends with. Anthrax helped their poor metal counterparts with a heater, a refrigerator, and sometimes a little food. Furthermore, the narcotics going around the district of The Music Building weren’t a big attraction to the band.\n\nTheir heavy metal ambitions were definitely based on a low budget accomodation, especially for a young guy who was used to Hellerup and the rest of the world, but the semi-miserable life in the MusicBuilding was not the most pressing problem for Lars and his now more hopeful band, Metallica. After a Sunday night support show for bands Vanderberg and The Rods, there was no more question as to Mustaine’s future in the band. They had to get rid of the rambunctious Dave. But who was going to tell him? The next morning they chose James, who poked the sleeping Dave’s shoulder and woke him up with the harsh words: “We’ve decided…you’re not in the band anymore!” There were two hours before the first Greyhound Bus would leave for the West, and there was no reason for a long farewell. They all moved on.\n\nLars explains the sad, but necessary episode: “Sometimes he was just a little wild, and what would happen if he ever was confronted with something he didn’t see coming? So we decided it was better to wake him up early and then put him on a Greyhound bus back to San Francisco as soon as possible before he fully grasped what the hell was going on. So, he was just thrown out of the band, and had to sulk in a fucking bus for three days instead of a four hour flight. But we had no money for tickets at the time.\n\nI was the closest to Dave and had perhaps the closest friendship with him, and I thought it would be too difficult for me to tell him. Cliff was the new guy and had only been with the band for five or six weeks, so he wasn’t qualified to say what we had to say. So James was chosen to handle it, but we were all together with him. There was no way James was doing it alone.”\n\nIt was a sad situation for Lars, James, Cliff and Mark, however, especially for Lars and James who experienced more than a year together with Dave, who had provided a solid kick forward with his experience and his umistakable guitar talent. Not much creativity and humor filled the gang’s day, who all went sightseeing in Manhattan and got drunk with the beverage that would hold on through all the shifting line-ups: vodka.\n\nBut Metallica also had some luck on their side–and good timing. The band’s preferred choice for a guitar player, Kirk Hammett, was ready to take his chance. His life in the band Exodus wasn’t bad, but he considered flying over to New York to record an album with Metallica was the perfect career step to take. Kirk landed in the evening of the same day Dave left, and Kirk’s audition in the MusicBuilding was a mere formality. A few weeks earlier, Lars and James had appropriately arranged for Kirk to get the No Life Til Leather demo, and felt quite certain that Kirk’s nature, music preferences and guitar playing would match well with Metallica’s chemistry and vision. And they were right.\n\n“Kirk arrived with his guitar and his Marshall amp, and we jammed with him the same day Dave had been kicked out. The first song we played was Seek And Destroy, and halfway through the solo James and I looked at each other, nodded simultaneously, and so it was done.\n\nKirk wasn’t in when we threw Mustaine out. He was clearly the first option, and we were very, very confident that it would work out, but he wasn’t in before the jam on Monday evening, where we gave each other thumbs up and asked him if he would join the band,” Lars adds.\n\nKirk Hammet’s jam debut was great, and less than a week later, he debuted on stage with Metallica in Dover, New Jersey.\n\nKirk was also the only Frisco native in the line-up (born on November 18th 1962 in San Francisco, California). He grew up with some older relatives living the hippie life in the notorious Haight-Astbury district in downtown San Francisco, and with the big music names from that period like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and The Grateful Dead. At 15 year old, Kirk began to play guitar, and there he found his identity in 70s hard rock bands like Thin Lizzy, Kiss and UFO. Later, Kirk was into the Sex Pistols and the violent punk music, but also had virtuoso Joe Satriani as a teacher, so Kirk could usefully seek the perfect symbiosis between melody, technique, speed and aggressiveness. In 1981, he formed his first band, Legend, who later became Exodus.\n\nLike James, Kirk comes from a divorced family. Kirk’s father was a drunk, and he often hit Kirk and Kirk’s mother. On his 16th birthday, all he got from his father was a huge kick in the ass. Kirk’s father left the house shortly after, and his mother had to fight hard to raise Kirk and his sister. When he was 10, Kirk was sexually abused by his neighbor. Guitar playing was therefore a definite therapy for Kirk, and all the traumatic experiences led him to mostly channel all his anger on the aggressive and hard heavy metal music.\n\nMetallica had written most of the material for their first album, mostly based on the songs from No Life Til Leather. Now it was about rehearsing well for the band’s song catalog in the MusicBuilding, and in the interest of the band’s upcoming gigs on the East Coast. Meanwhile, Jonny Z found an available studio for the recording. A guy called Joey DeMaio, bassist in one of Jonny Z’s New York bands, Manowar, recommended a studio in the city of Rochester, New York, near the Canada border, best known for George Eastman and his Kodak Film. The studio was called “Music America”, and was much cheaper than the local but very expensive studios in Manhattan. The huge hall on the second floor of Music America matched Lars’s drum sound perfectly, because “Lars had an opaque drum sound”, Jonny Z then shared in his study.\n\nWhile the young and hard drumming metal fan beat the drums up in the hall, Jonny Z was asked to take care of the budget back home in New Jersey. While Music America and its owner, producer Paul Curcio, were cheaper than the New York-based setups, not everything was that inexpensive. Metallica recorded their album in six weeks until the end May, and at home in Rock'n'Roll Heaven, all the excess money from the record sales went to the album production in Rochester. The Zazulas had really taken a chance with this band, but had also miscalculated in terms of album sales. Numerous meetings with talent scouts and A&R people from all sorts of record labels ended with nothing. It became obvious to Jonny Z that he would have to pay for the release of Metallica’s album himself.\n\nEstablishment of his own record label had never been part of Jonny Z’s otherwise voluminous plan, but now there was no turning back. He launched Megaforce “for this one album’s sake”. Fortunately for Jonny Z–and Lars and his band–Megaforce Records had contact with two benevolent distributors: Relativity in the US and the new British heavy metal company, Music For Nations, which had been launched a year before with a release from the New York band Virgin Steele. However, the former had a problem with the album title the young hotheads had come up with after the discharge of energy in Rochester: Metal Up Your Ass.\n\nOriginally a working title, the band was now sure it was their final choice. They stood firm, but the time had also come for Lars and his band Metallica to learn a little about the real conditions of the music industry. The message was clear: the record could under no circumstances be titled Metal Up Your Ass, nor the suggested compromise M.U.Y.A or any other unsolicited suggestions. A fiery Cliff then bitterly expressed his feelings about the restrictive distributors: “Kill 'em all, man…just kill 'em all.”\n\nThere was the title. Kill 'Em All.\n\nKill 'Em All came out in the month of July, with a logo designed by James Hetfield and with an uncensored line in the notes: Metal Up Your Ass. The album consisted of nine songs (including further developments of the six tracks from No Life 'Til Leather) and a solid bass solo from Cliff. It was riff-based heavy metal with fast song after fast song, mixed with tempo shifts and fiery solos as soon as there was room for them, with a lyrical universe that was one big statement on Metallica’s love for heavy metal, which they felt had been neglected in the US scene.\n\nGlobally, there were people with the same observations as Lars and Metallica. In less than two weeks, close to 20,000 copies of Kill Em All were sold, which was totally unheard of for an independant realease.\n\n“We used the first nine songs we’ve ever written on this album, and we will use the next nine for the next album, and so on. That’s Metallica’s plan for world domination,” was said with great enthusiasm and a lot of youthful playfulness from Lars, who was going to talk almost incessantly about Metallica.\n\nLars was obviously right with his witty statements about “world domination”. Over time, it wouldn’t be that easy with the songs and the recordings, and to battle for world domination in the media, in meetings with the record companies, in rehearsal, in the studio (for months, then for years), on the phone, by fax from home (sometimes), on the road, in Vancouver and all over the world.\n\nBut Lars was ready for it all–and he had his inexhaustible commitment and firm determination, which were important assets. And most importantly, he finally had a complete band in summer of 1983."
