        "text": "Amar Singh College (Urdu: امر سنگھ کالج سرینگر, Kashmiri: اَمرسنگھ ژاٹٕھل سِرینگر) is an academic & professional college in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is the second oldest college in the Kashmir Valley after Sri Pratap College. It was established in November 1913 as Amar Singh Technical Institute, to teach willing students art, culture, and basics like masonry and carpentry. It was formally opened on 29 May 1914 by Maharaja Pratap Singh. In June 1942, the Technical Institute was converted into Amar Singh College through bifurcation of Sri Pratap College commemorating the name of the father of Hari Singh, the then Maharaja of Kashmir. The College was recognized by University Grants Commission of India (UGC) in June 1972. The College is accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council [NAAC] with B++ Grade. LOCATION The college is located in Wazir Bagh, in the city of Srinagar (74o-48 `N latitude, 34o-03 `E longitude and 1589m altitude). It is spread over 35 hectares of land divided into a large play ground, parks, gardens, and an infrastructural area. At present, the college has multiple academic buildings making a total built-up area of about 30000m2. This includes the glorious heritage building, representing the finest blend of Anglo-Indian architecture, constructed in 1910 for running a technical institute. Presently it houses chemistry department, teaching staff room, UGC, IQAC Cell, NSS and NCC rooms, besides having six lecture theaters and three large halls for the conduct of examinations. The heritage building had got damages during earthquake in 2005 and devastating flood in September 2014. However, it was repaired and restored to its actual look in 2017-18 by J&K Government through INTAC. Read More"
