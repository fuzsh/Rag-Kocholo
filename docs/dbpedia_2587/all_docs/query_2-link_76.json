Editorial Note In viewof the wide rangeand complexityofthe transliteration systems which exist for Arabic, Persian and Turkish, as well as for Urdu and other languages of the sub continent, it has been decided to maintain theauthor's original versionsofIslamicnames throughout.Thispolicy also enables the reader to see a more accurate representation of the forms of the names as they have developed in the different areas of the Muslim world.\n\n4. Author’s Note on the Transliteration The orientalist will discover a discrepancy in the transliteration of compound names, and will find Sharafad-din and 'Abdul Latifinstead of either Sbarafad-din and 'Abd al-Latifor Sharafud din and 'Abdul Latif. The reason for this inconsistency is that in common parlance names with ad-din are usually shortened to the first constituent element: Shihdb, or Shihabi, while the constructions with 'Abd are very often split up into 'Abdul and Latif, which frequently appear as independent names. I therefore consider it more practical to use a 'mixed' transliteration than the 'correct' one. As for Turkish names, they are usually given in the modem Turkish alphabet unless they areattestedin classicalsources.Themainchanges in the modem transcription are the following: i = C; ch = f; sh = Sh = i.q = k-, shorta isfrequentlypronounced asa shorte, the dipthong au rendered as ev,- d at the end of the word or in reduplication becomes t. Thus, Khalid appears as Halit, falal ad-din as Celalettin, Taufiq as Tevfik, Aqqush as Akku$. In the examples given in the text, A, P, Tdenote Arabic, Persian and Turkish respectively.\n\n5. Introduction One of the first Arabic stones I read as a teenager was this: Sharik ibn al-A'war entered Mu'awiya’s presence. He was ugly, so Mu'awiya said to him: ‘You are really ugly, but a beautiful person is better than an ugly one; you are Shorik. 'companion’, - but God has no companion; and your father is al-a'war, 'one- eyed', but a sound person is better than the one-eyed, how then did you come to rule your tribe!' He answered: 'You are Miiawiya - and what is miiawiya but a bitch that howls and make dogs howl! And you are the son of $akhr, 'rock', but the plain is better than the rock, andyou are the descendantof Harb, 'war', but peace is better than war; and you are the descendant of Umayya, and what is umayya but 'a slave girl’ in the diminu­ tive! How did you become the Commander of the Faithful!'1 This story contains a number of important ingredients for the study of names and shows the importance people ascribed and continue to ascribe to proper names. The name is part of the person; rather, it is really the person; therefore, to know someone's name means to have power over that person. Did not God teach Adam the names of all thingssothat hemight'ruleoverthem'! Names mustnot bementioned in the caseofgreat people and women; and Arabic, PersianandTurkish poets have never ceased singing of their beloved's beauty, but rarely without adding: '1 shall not tell her/his name!' Names are surrounded by a taboo; they carry baraka, blessing power, but can also be used for magic.1 Everywhere one finds that by calling a child by the name of a saint or a hero (including film stars!) parents hope to transfer some of the noble qualities, the heroism or beauty of their patron to the child, and thus to make him participate in the patron's greatness. To change one's name means indeed to change one's identity: and hence the importance of a change of name in the case of conversion. Names can tell much about the likes and dislikes of people, about fashions and trends, about religious and political predilections, and thus a study of the nomenclature in any society is highly revealing. It is, at the same time, a never-ending task. As Leone Caetani stated at the beginning of his Onomasticon Arabicum,1 one could as well compose a complete dictionary of Arabic since almost every word has appeared, at some point in history, as a proper name. The same can be said for the Persian and Turkish areas, and for Muslim India. However, certain patterns can be discovered, and we shall try to give a modest survey of types of names as they occur in the world of Islam. ix\n\n6. INTRODUCTION As early as 1854 the French scholar Garcin de Tassy remarked that one of the problems that embarrass those who want to occupy them­ selves with the history of the Muslim East, is the sheer quantity of names, surnames and honorific titles which one and the same person bears.' Indeed, at times one may become impatient when confronted with a full-fledged line of names - especially when they have to be catalogued: under which heading should one list Najib ad-din Abu HaffUmar ibn Muhammad ibn al-Bayfar ar-Razi, to give a perfectly normal Arabic example? And where does one find Khan Bahadur Nabibakhsh Ahmad Khan lamali1. Anotherproblem which isespeciallylikelytoconfusethe non-orien­ talist reader is the transcription of names, which is becoming more and more difficult with the growing number of Oriental scholars writ- mg in European languages and adapting their names to English or French style. The large numberof immigrants from the Muslim world - Turks, Arabs, Persians, Afghans, Pakistanis and so on - with their strange sounding names offer another challenge to Western people. The untutored reader of a newspaper or of a survey of Islamic history or literature would probably be quite surprised to learn that Qdsim, Qassem, Gassem, Gacem, Kafim, Casern, Kasim and Ghasim are all in fact the same name, but transcribed differently, and how could he know, when opening a Flench or Turkish publication, or a German or English one, that the word dawla 'state', which forms the second part of so many titles, can also appear as daula, dowle, dovleh, devlet or daulatl Who understands why one Ikram ul-Haqq can delete the first part of his name and appear in the telephone directoryas Mr Huq. Haq, Haqq, Haque, Hakl The Turkish way of transcribing Arabic and Persian words is particularly difficult for a foreigner to understand: Taufiq appears as Tevfik. Khalidas Halit, etc. A further problem arises as speakers of non-Arabic languages are often unable to pronounce correctly the Arabic letter d, adeep d, and like to change it intoz: thus Ramadan becomes Ramazan in the Persian-Turkishareas. Since many Indian languagesexchange / andz as wellass and sh, we mayencounter Ramadan in Bengal or Gujarat as Ramjan. Murtada a* Murtazd and Murtaja, and so on. The confusion between s and sh and the difficulty in pronouncing the hard Arabic kh correctly leads in India to transcrip­ tions like Ghousbux for Ghauthbakhsh. The sharp Arabic h is some­ times lost, so that Fatlj 'Alt becomes Fatali, and some short vowels disappear altogether: Sulayman can become Sliman, and Abu Bakr appears in North Africa in French transcription as Boubker. Even an Orientalist will probably take a deep breath before recognizing the great medieval saint Abu Madyan in the name Boumedienne The farther we are from the heartlands of Islam the more difficult\n\n7. INTRODUCTION is it to identify certain names. Among my Turkish friends there are some whose names are still an enigma to me, although I have learned that Mugiil was nothing but an abbreviation of Omtnii Giilsum, the Arabic Umm Kulthum, and one wonders why a pretty girl is called Samina, 'the fat one', until one realizes that only the transliteration of the Indian pronounciadon of thamina (the precious one| causes this mishap. There is nodearth of bookson Islamicnames. Inclassicaltimesnumer­ ous authors dealt with names, though mainly in connection with the correctpronounciationoftransmittersofProphetictraditions;and they compiled extensive works on nisbas and kunyas and other parts of an Arabic name. Every historical work offers an almost endless number ofnames and new combinations, in whatever Islamic language it may be written or with whichever period and country it may be dealing. Leone Caetani's monumental Onomasticon was nevercompleted, but its first volume offers a most useful survey of types of names with numerous examples. The old articles by Garcin de Tassy and Barbier de Meynard in the Journal Asiatique are still worth reading and give an excellent surveyof non-Arabic names aswell. StudiesbyArab scho­ lars like H. al-Basha, with his extensive collection of names and titles, or I. Samarra'i's small but useful survey of Islamic names are good tools for the researcher; and studies in the nomenclature of a certain area, like P. Marty's rich article on Tunisian onomastics, are most welcome. Several papers about the development in modem Turkey exist, and a great number of special studies have been devoted to indi­ vidual problems. Excellent guides are the articles on ism, kunya, and lakab in the new edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam. This book does not aim at an exhaustive treatment of names. We neither offer statistics, as A. K. Bihniya has done in his survey of tens of thousands of modem Persian names, nor do we try to draw parallels with developments in otherculturalareas, temptingasthis might have been. Our aim is to offer some guidelines for the general reader, which may contain some interesting material for the orientalists as well. Muchofthematerial istakenfrommodemsourcessuchasnewspapers, telephonedirectories(includingthatofNorth Yemen),andfromdiscus­ sions with numerous friends in Muslim countries. A wide collection of Turkish names, which I gathered in Ankara between 1954 and 1959, has been used; as has my unpublished study of Mamluk names. Many friends have answered my questions and contributed stories about names. Among them I must gratefully mention Di Ziauddin A. Shakeb, of Hyderabad and London, who told me numerous stories and quotedagreat numberofexamplesfrom theDeccaniMuslimtradition. xi\n\n8. INTRODUCTION. The late Sharif ul-Hasan of Islamabad was another important source of information; he himself was keenly interested in names and family ties in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent. Dr. Shams-Anwari Husayni of Cologne kindly infbrmed me about some Persian traditions and guided me to important new Persian publications about Iranian nomenclature. Oner Onder of Bonn helped me with official lists of Turkish names from the Turkish consulate. Professor Ali S. Asani of Harvard contributed interestingremarks about Isma'ili names in India and East Africa, and Professor Stefan Wild of Bonn answered some intricate questions about Arabicdialectical names. Professor Wolfhart Heinrichs and Dr Alma Giese, Harvard, were kind enough to read the whole manuscript and to offer valuable suggestions. My warm thanks are due to all these friends as well as to the many un named people who, even by passing remarks, helped clarify one point or another.\n\n9. I The Structure of a ‘Name Islamic names are formed according to a strict pattern, at least in the classical period of Arab civilization. The relevant articles in the Ency­ clopediaofIslamallowacomprehensivesurveyofthetraditionalforms and many remarks apply also to the customs of non-Arabs. Each name consists - in the sequence usually applied - of the kunya, that is the name Abu x (father of so-and-sol, or Umm x (mother of so-and-so); the actual ism, that is the personal name (sometimes enlarged by a laqab with ad-din}-, then the nasab, one's relation to one's forefathers; then thenisba, pointingtoone'snativeplace,nationalorreligiousallegiance and the like, and finally the laqab (nickname), which later tended to develop into a proper name, or a family or clan name which could also be an honorific designation. Thus, a man might be called Abu'l- Mahasin (Jamal ad-din) Yusuf ibn Abi Yusuf Ya'qub al-Makki al-Han- bali az-Zayyat. Often, the laqab with ad-din precedes all other names. Weshall discussthesenamesbrieflyaccordingtotheirforms, including Persian and Turkish usages, and then examine their peculiarities in more detail. For the sake of convenience we begin not with the kunya but with the ism. Ism or 'alam.1 The proper name, ism, can consist of an adjective in anyof itsdifferent forms, including participle or elative; of a noun (either concrete or abstract); or of a verb. Full sentences, as known in Hebrew names like Jonathan |Yahweh has given), do not occur in Arabic isms. Verbs of incomplete action are used in Arabic; in other languages full verbal forms such as the imperative, or the past tense are also found. Some Arabic isms are fully declinable (having three grammatical cases), like 'Amrun-, othershaveonlytwo case-endingssuch as’Umaru and those that are originally verbs of incomplete action, like Yazidu. Some appear with the definite article: al-Hasan. In other cases the usage admits of both definite and indefinite forms, for example, one would address al-Hasan as Yd Hasan. A peculiarity of classical Arabic names is that a number of male names have a feminine form, such as Mu'awiya, al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, 'Urwa and many more. In some cases, such as al-Hdrith and Haritha. masculine and feminine forms for males exist side by side.1 Qur'inic and historical isms are frequent and compounds abound, 1\n\n10. THE STRUCTURE OF A'NAME' especially of 'abd'slave' with Allah orone of the Divine names. Other combinations of nouns with Allah (or a Divine name) like 'Ata Allah, 'God's gift', appear in great variety, particulary in the Muslim East. Many Persian and \"riirkish names were incorporated into Arabic nomenclature in the course of time; and Arabic, (especially Islamic) names found their way into all non-Arabic Muslim languages, especi­ ally in the upper classes. Among the adjectives used in isms every conceivable form occurs. The active participleof the 1 verbal form, fa’ll, such as Khalid, 'remain­ ing', Nazim, 'arranging' occurs, further the form fail, like Said, 'happy', Zakiy, 'pure', or, more emphatically, Sa'ud, 'very happy’, further, thepassiveparticiple ofform I, asin Mas'ud, 'happy'orMahfuf, 'preserved', and of form II like Muzaffar, 'victorious' or Munawwar, 'enlightened'. These latter forms are often used for both sexes. The active participle of form IV is also common, asin Muhsin, 'beneficient' or Mu'in, 'helping'. Very widespread are adjectives of the form afal which denote either the comparative/superlative as in As'ad, 'happier, most happy' or else signifycoloursand physical deficiencies, likeAsmar, ‘blackish brown', or A'rai, 'lame'. These have the feminine form fa'la: Samra'. The use of adjectives for isms is common in Persian and Turkish as well: Narmin 'soft', Bihtar 'better' (P|, or Jen 'cheerful', Kutlu 'happy' (T|. Among the concrete nouns, animal isms abound, partly for the animal'scharacteristicsor, in some cases, when theanimal mentioned was the first thing seen after the baby's birth. To what extent old totemistic ideas survive, is an open question. Lions are especially fre­ quent:’ Asad, Ghadanfar, Haydar, Layth, Usama, Qirgham, Shibl> in Persian Shir, Shirzad, in Turkish Arslan. So too are Fahd (cheetah), Namir, Nimr. Qablan (T) 'leopard', Babur (T) Tiger'. The bull, thaur, is also represented in Arabic names but occurs more frequently in Turkish as bughd with a great variety of compounds like Altun-, Gdmu;-, Kutlu-, Demir-bugha (Gold, Silver, Lucky, Iron-Bull respec­ tively). Foxes, tha'lab and wolves, dhi'b, sirhan or aus, are again better represented inTurkish where Mru, kurt, bozkurt(grey wolf)wereoften used. Bseisa (= busaysa) 'kitten' is found even among Bedouins, and one wonders why someone might have been connected with vermin such as dharr 'minute ant', al-mazin 'ant'segg’, al-furay'a 'little louse' or burghuth ’flea)' Birds, especially predatory ones, are good omens for a brave boy, and the eagle, 'uqab, or its chick, al-haytham, and the falcon, saqar, alqufdmiy, appear in Arabic as does 'ikrima, the dove. They are apparently an even more important part of Turkish names, where various types of hawks and falcons abound: sunqur, balban. 2\n\n11. THE STRUCTURE OF A 'NAME' tughan, (ddgan). tughril, tarlan, turgut - often specified by aq- (ak) 'white' like Aqdoghan, or qara (kara) 'black', qarasonqut. The Persian shdhin, baz, and shdhbaz belong here too. All these names are known among Indian Muslims, but in the Subcontinent one findsalso smaller indigenous birds like turn (parrot) or mina, the blackish meena bird. Just as there seems to be no restriction in the use of animal names, plants too are used as isms both in classical and modem times,* be it the bitter colocinth, hanza/a or 'alqama-, the watermelon, biffikh, or any kind of potherb like bashes, fennel, orkumin, cuminseed (modem Tunisia). Names of flowers and tender plants are mainly given to women as we shall see in chapter IV. All nature served the Muslims for names, beginning with the sun (shams: Shemissa is still in use in Tunis) and aftab, khurshid (P) or Gun, giiney (T) - to the moon {badr is the full moon, mah (P) and ay (T) occur often in combinations). Stars in general - najm, akhtar (P), yildiz (T)-areused. Sotooaresinglestarsandconstellations, especially Suhayl (Canopus), or the Pleiades Ithurayyd). The horizon (u/uq), the sky, (asuman (P)J, mountains (fabal. dag (T|), the ocean (balir, darya (P), deniz, engin (T)), rain lyagmur (T)|, or lightning fbarq) (A), fimfek, yfldirlm (T)| and many more are bestowed on children. In many cases, theiroriginal meaning is nowadaysforgottenand theyareused because of their connection with a famous hero, such as the name Hamza (the Prophet's uncleandheroofa widespread saga) whoseoriginal meaning, namely 'bean', nobody is likely to remember. Indeed, if one were to tell peopletheoriginal meaningofmanymuch-lovednamestheymight well be rather shocked? Household goods are also used for isms. Ibn Qutayba, in the ninth century, mentions amongothers salm (a bucket with one handle), haff (leatherbasket), bakrai (coffee-pot)and, more elevated, an-nadr(Gold). Besides concrete names, abstract nounsare also often used fornaming children? They may point to virtues, like Faill 'Virtue', or to good wishes, like Salama 'Wellbeing', Na;r also with an article: \"Victory'. Almost every form of verbal noun could be used in this category, and some of them are commonly used for both men and women. We find forms such as in Taufiq 'success', Iqbal 'good fortune', Tawaddud 'Love', Irtidd 'Contentment'. Other forms include Rifat 'Elevation' and 'Ifmat 'Chastity, sinlessness', Bahiat 'Splendour', Nufrat'Victory', Wadad 'Love'. Again many of them are used for both sexes. Abstract nouns are of course not lacking in non-Arabic languages, like Umid(P) \"Hope'orArmaghan{P}'Gift', Ugur'Goodluck'orErtem (T) 'Virtue’. Present-tense verbs appear in Arabic as isms’ like Yazid 'he increases', Ya’ish 'he lives'. In Turkish, negatives occur like qaymaz 3\n\n12. THE STRUCTURE OF 4'NAME' ‘he does not slide', which can also be interpreted as the participle 'not sliding’; and we find imperatives like Guven Trust!' or Gungdr 'See the sun’. Positive forms are also common, like Yener 'he vanquishes, vanquishing’, as weiras optatives: Dursun 'May he stay'. Most tenses of the past are found in names like Aydogdu or Aydogmuf a moon was bom’, Iltutmif 'he grasped the land', and many more. bouble names were formerly rare. Carcin de Tassy claims that in India only sayyids used them,\" but it seems that they occur nowadays in all parts of the Islamic world, and among all strata of society. They sometimes lead to strange combinations such as Babak Husayn or Yad Allah Gayumarth in Iran, where parents have tried to prove their allegiance to both the Islamic and the ancient Persian tradition; such mixed namesoccuralso whenthe parentscomefrom differentreligious backgrounds.9 Kunya or agnomen10 Thekunya, agnomen isthedesignationofapersonasfather, abu (abou, bu, abo, genitive abi, accusative aba] or 'mother', umm, of so-and-so. Frahn in his study of the titles and cognomens of the Golden Horde (Kazan 1814) called it a hyionymicon, 'connected with a son's name'. On the other hand, as the kunya precedes the given name, Kosegarten called it Vorname, ‘first name’. More studies have been devoted to the kunya in its different forms than to any other part of Muslim names. It is possible that originally theintention tohonour someone by calling him or her after the firstborn son gave rise to the use of the kunya or, if the person was still young, the hope that they might be blessed with a child, especially a son. It may also be that the kunya was sometimes used to avoid pronouncing the given-name which is surrounded by a taboo: as a secondary name it was not considered to be a real part of the person, and hence to know it did not imply any danger for the bearer.\" The fact that the term isderived from the same root as kinaya (indirect expression), seems to point to the deeper meaning of the kunya. It may be that for this very reason many women are known only by their kunya. In some parts of the Islamic wqrld, such as rural areas of Pakistan, husband and wife do not address each other by their proper names (isms) at all, but rather as Father of X or Mother of Z; or they prefer to avoid any name and use only a personal pronoun when speaking to each other (turn, dp 'you'). The use of the given-name was in any case considered improper, and thus the kunya was mentioned when one wished to honour someone (at-takniya takrima). It is therefore considered rather bad taste to use the kunya when speaking of oneself; and the refusal to be called by one's kunya is regarded as a sign of modesty. 4\n\n13. THE STRUCTURE OF A NAME Here aproblem arose forthe theologians: if the kunyawasanhonori­ fic name, why then was the Prophet's worst enemy called (Qur'an, Sura 111) Abu Lahab 'Father of Flame’, that is, with a kunya’ (similar to Abu lahl, Father of ignorance, the other outstanding enemy of the young Muslim community!. The Quranic commentator, az- Zamakhshari, explains the use of the kunya in this case by claiming that it is used as in names Abu'l-khayr. Abu'sh-sharr ’Father of good, orofevil'as implyingthatAbuLahabwasdestinedforhellfire. Another interpretation claims that God in the Qur'an addressed His friends by their proper names, ism, like 'O Yahya, O Daud!' while the kunya was reserved for His enemies. As the kunya was meant as honour it was not customary in early Islam togive it to non-Arabs or to slaves. It was therefore aremarkable event when the Christian physician libra'll ibn Bukhtishu’ after suc­ cessfully treating the ninth-century caliph al-Ma'mun, was granted a kunya by the grateful patient; this kunya wasAbu 'Isa. Thiscombina­ tion - Abu 'Isa libra'll — sounds very odd, as if Gabriel were Jesus' father. Indeed, the very kunya Abu 'Isa was disputed, as Jesus had no human father, and the caliph 'Umar had strongly disapproved of its usage; but even a leading traditionist {muhaddith), at-Tirmidhi, did not object to being called by this kunya.\" The kunya was not to be used for socially inferior people, nor was it proper to address respected persons by their given name. This is reflected inananecdoteintheKitabal-aghaniofAbu'l Farajal-I;fahani, the famous tenth-century collection of stories and poems. The singer Ibrahim al-Mausili was admired by crafty Iblis (Satan, who exclaimed: 'Ahsant yd Ibrahim!' (Well done, Ibrahim!,. Then, in the words of the incensed musician, 'my wrath increased and 1 said: First of all he entered my room without permission and wanted me to sing for him, and then he called me by my proper name |ism| and not by my kunya (as would have been correct)!' But such are the ways of the devil.. . The kunya need not refer only to a son; many cases of abu with a feminine name are known from the first generations in Islam: Abu Ruqayya Tamim ad-Dari. Abu Layla, Abu Rihana and so on because ■onewas proud tohonour daughters and not, like the pre-Islamic Arabs, bury them alive.\"1 Names such as Sulma bint Abi Sulma show that the kunya indeed pointed to real daughters. Some kunyas were used so often that they turned into proper names: for example Abu Bakr, which figures in biographical dictionaries under Abu, not under another name to which it has been added as a kunya. Some people had more than one kunya, 'one for war and one for peace’, or kunyas that were used in different countries.1* This was considered to be a mark of dignity, as in the case of the eighth-century 5\n\n14. THE STRUCTURE OF A INAME' 'Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid who was called Abu la'far and Abu Muhammad.\" Even people without children were oftengiven akunya although the caliph 'Umar |ruled 634-44), always very strict, disap­ proved of one Shu'ayb being called Abu Yabyd - ‘and you have no son’.“Nawawi, however, devotesa wholechaptertothe permissibility of inventing a kunya for a childless person: was not 'A'isha, the Prophet's young, childless wife called Umm 'Abdallah1.\" That might refer to her relation with her nephew or, according to another version, to a miscarriage; for stillborn children were also given a name. As slavesgenerally had no kunya, it wasa sign ofgratitudeorrespect for a faithful slave if his owner granted him one: when the caliph al-Mahdi |ruled 775-85) manumitted his slave, the poet Nusayb, he married him to a girl and called him Abu'l-jafna (Father of the girl with curly hair).1' In the course of time certain kunyas were attached to certain proper names. Apersoncalled 'Ali wouldprobablyalsobenamedAbu'l-Hasan or Abu’l-Husayn-, Abu 'Ali al-Husayn also occurs. An Ibrahim was likely to be called Abu Ishaq (Isaac) or Abu Ismd\"il(Ishmael) in conso­ nance with the historical sons of Ibrahim lAbraham). 'Umar is often combined with Abu Hafs, as the caliph 'Umar's daughter Hafsa was married to the Prophet (the caliph himself, however, had the kunyas Abu 'Abdallah and Abu Layla). A man called Ayyub (Job) may receive the kunya Abu'f-fabr ‘Father of patience' in remembrance of lob's patient suffering. Onecaninvent fittingcombinationslikeAbu'n-najm Badr 'Father of the star, Full Moon', or Abu’l-baqd Khalid 'Father of eternity, eternal' where both parts of the name point to duration and eternity; or the kunya can bederived from the same root as the proper name (ism): Abu'l-'izz 'Abdul 'Aziz. These latter combinations, how­ ever, led to a different type of kunya, for the kunya was often used to express not only a reality - the existence of a child - but also wishes and blessings for the parents' happiness and the child's progress. The famous tenth-century litterateur as-$ahib Ibn 'Abbad sent a letter to an 'Alid to whom a son had been born: 'and his name, ism, be 'Ali so that God may exalt, yu'alli, his memory, and his kjinya should be Abu'l-Hasan, so that God may better, yuhsin, his affairs!'1’ Although Abu'l-Hasan is a normal kunya for any 'Ali after the example of 'Ali ibn AbiTilib, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, 'All's son al-Hasan, yet Ibn 'Abbad interpreted the name as an expression of hoped-for success. Such metaphorical kunyas, to use Caetani's term, are frequent, and Kosegarten fittingly translates them with high-sounding Latin terms: Abu’l-futub 'Pater victoriarium - father of victories', Abu'l-Mahasin 'Pater virtutes - father of virtues' etc. One often finds Abu'l-barakdt 6\n\n15. THE STRUCTURE OF A 'NAME' ‘father of blessings', Abu'l/araiofjoy', Abu'l-yumn of happiness' etc. Such kunyas seems to be restricted to urban circles and are little known amongBedouins, as Casket's studies prove.“ In many cases the use of the definite article is fluctuating; the article being often con­ nected with metaphorical kunyas: Abu Nasr is 'father of Na?r‘, while Abu'n-nafr is 'father of victory'. The kunya is sometimes shortened to bu: Abu Ishaq (fatherof Isaac, becomes Bushdq: or it appears in the accusative as Abd, Ba, thus in South Arabia and Iran Abu Yazid becomes Bayazid, and Abu Dhan turns into Badharr. In North Africa, Abu'I can be contracted to Bel: Abu'i-Hasan becomes Bel Hasan.\" Some kunyasaredisputed. Wemen­ tionedAbu'Isa 'fatherof Jesus'; buttheProphet's kunya, Abu'l-Qdsim, also poses a problem; it should not be applied when the person is called Muhammad. 'All's kunya, Abu Turdb 'father of dust', has been inter­ preteddifferently bypiousShiitesandtheearlyadversariesofthe fourth caliph.21 There is another aspect to the kunya as well. It 'reveals intellectual or moral qualitiesordefects, physical peculiarities, thecustom of wear­ ingspecific garmentsorotherobjects, thehabitualcompanyofanimals, orparticular taste, or incidents in the person’s life.'“ The most famous representativeofthis typeofkunya isAbu Hurayra, 'Fatherofakitten', Muhammad's companion around whose kunya numerous stories were woven; but one may also think of the Arab poet Abu'l-'Atdhiya (748- 825/61, 'Father of craziness'. This type of kunya has often assumed all the characteristics of the laqab or nickname; in fact, the word kunya has lately come to designate family names, as in modem Damascus, or what formerly would have been called a laqab (as in the Maghrib).12 If someone is called Abu’d-dawaniq, 'Father of farthings’, as was an 'Abbasid caliph, it points to his miserliness. Abu 'asida (Bou asside) can be someone who is fond of the sweet dish 'afida or at whose birth much 'a^ida was cooked and distributed to the poor.15 A man in a Syrian village was calledAbu 'izdm, 'Fatherof bones', because he regu­ larlystole chickens to feed his children.14Bou ras (Abiio's) is someone with a large head; Aburaqiba [Bourghiba] someone with an unusually long or short neck; Borjel (Abu rijl) a person with a deformed foot, ri/1; while Abu khashab 'Father of wood' may be someone with a wooden leg.1' One can call one’s child Bu Dinar for good fortune or because a piece of gold was found when he was bom. Amazingly, the kunya Abu /ahi 'Father of ignorance', known from the Prophet's days, is today found inYemen, as isAbu'aft ‘Fatherofdifficulty’. Thiskindof kunya is rarely applied to women, as their outstanding characteristics were not knownoutsidetheirhome; buttheymayhavetheirownnicknames inside the women's quarters. 7\n\n16. THE STRUCTURE OF A NAME' The kunya as a means of characterising persons and things is fre­ quently used for animals, such as Abu Hufayn (father of the little fortress) for the fox, or Umm arba' wa arba 'in (Mother of forty-four) for the centipede, but this usage need not concern us here.” In recent times there has been an increasing tendency in Orientalist circles todesignate as kunya not only the names fohned withAbu and Umm but also those with ibn (son of). This use is found even in the great eighteenth-century dictionaries like the Taj al-'arus, but should be avoided.” Terms of relationship other than abu and umm belong to the category of nasab and form a special class of names, to which we now turn. Nasab - 'lineage'.” The nasabexpresses the relation of a son oradaughtertohis/herfather or mother and is expressed in Arabic byibn. bin for males, ibnat. bint for females, in the plural banu (genitive bani) and banal respectively. Sibling relationships, brother, akhu (genitive akhi) and sister, ukht, also fall under this category. Someone may be called akbu X if his brother or sister is a well-known personality, as in the case of 'Umar akhu al-luwayriyya umm al-mu‘minin, the brotherofJuwayriyya, one of the Prophet's wives, or Ibn akhiash-Shaffi, ‘the son of (the famous jurist) ash-Shafi'is brother', i.e., his nephew. Many persons in Islamic history are known by their nasab: Ibn Sind (980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (1126-98), to mention the most familiar ones. They appear in Western sources as Avicenna and Averroes. The twelfth-century physician AvenzoarofSeville isofthefamilyofIbn Zuhr; theAvencerragefamily of Granada are the Ibn as-Sarraj. Sometimes the father's kunya is the point of reference: Ibn Abi Layla, or Umayya ibn Abi Umayya for example. Often, the nasab refersnot to the fatheror mother but toa moredistant ancestor, especi­ ally when it expresses a profession like Ibn as-Sa'ati 'Son of the clockmaker', Ibn az-Zayyat 'Son of the oil-man' or Ibn al-Fand 'Son of the notary'. It can also be formed with the father's or ancestor's nickname, laqab, as in Ibn as-sikkit 'Son of the taciturn man' or Ibn Dhi'l-lihya 'Son of the bearded man'. If a child is bom of non-Muslim parents, one speaks of Ibn or Bint 'Abdallah. That is valid for most slavestoo, includingthemilitaryslaves(Mamluks), iatheMiddleAges. If the father was unknown a person could be called 'son of his father', like the famous governor Ziyad ibn Abihi in early Umayyad history,- or else he would be called after his mother. This latter custom, however, is also found when the mother was noted for special traits, for instance when she was a foreigner. That is the case with 'All ibn Abi Talib's son from a slave girl, who became 8\n\n17. t THE STRUCTURE OF A 'NAME' known asMuhammadibn al-Hanafiyya, thesonofa woman belonging to the Hanifa tribe. Similarly we find Ibn al-Qutiyya or Ibn ar- Rumiyya, 'Son of the Visigothic, or, Byzantine woman'. Inpolygamous families, one of the wives might be remarkable in some way, so that her children would be' named after her, as in the case of Marwan ibn al-Hakam knownas Ibnaz-Zarqa’'Sonoftheblue-eyed woman'. Alter­ natively, the maternal family might be more important that the pater­ nal line, asin the case of Ibn Bint al-A'azz whose maternalgrandfather, al-A'azz. was a vizier, or Ibn ukht Ghanun 'son of Ghanim's sister'. The thirteenth-century Seljuq historian Ibn Bibi is called after his mother. Bibi al-munaijima, 'the lady astronomer'. Sometimes one finds simply Ibn as-sitt or Ibn al-mar'a, 'son of the lady’, or, ‘of the woman', or full names, like Ibn Maryam 'Son of Mary' or professional names like Ibn ad-dayd 'Son of the wetnurse'.1' Forfurther extension of thenasab one may use the term sibt, 'grand­ son through the daughter' as in the historian Sibt Ibn al-Iauzi, whose mother was a daughter of the famous twelfth-century lawyer and theologian Ibn al-|auziand who was even called by theTurkish epithet Qizoghlu, 'the girl’s son’. In sayyid families in non-Arabic areas we find Sibf-i Hasan (descendant of Hasan) or Sibt-i rasul (descendant of the Prophet). Sometimes the word al-hafid (the grandson) is used, especially when two scholars, ornotables, bear the same name: Hasan ibn 'All ibn Hasan al-hafid. The plural banu, often also in the genitive Bani, Bni, is used for a familyoraclan, asBanu Isra'fl, 'thechildrenofIsrael'orBanu Umayya, 'the Umayyads'. The word survives also in Persian family names like Banu'azizi or Banifdtima. Among the Arabs, al (family) is frequently found, like Al Hashim, Al Sa'ud or Al Sabah. This alcan be shortened and then looks like the Arabic definite article as in Al'umar. In Indo­ Pakistani names one encounters Al-t Ahmad, 'Ahmad's family', to In North Africa the word mild, (pl. aulad, uladl is used instead of ibn, like Si (from sayyidi, 'my lord') Hamza wuld Si Ahmad. Walad. 'son', is also used in Iran, sometimes even as a proper name. Among the Berbers one finds ait, at, eyt, it as in Ait Ahmad, and the family of the Glad Tahir may appear as Ittahirdn. In modem Arabic the ibn is often left out, and Ahmad ‘Ali is likely to be Ahmad ibn 'Ali, which can make a proper analysis of names difficult. As for Persian nasab, the most common way is to connect the son's name with that of the father by the i of the izafeti e.g. Husayn-i Mansur. As this i is not written, forms like Husayn Mansur emerge, and as in the Arabic Ahmad 'Ali the father's name isoften understood tobe part of theson's name - Husayn ibn Mansur al-Haliaj is usually known as Mansur in 9\n\n18. THE STRUCTURE OF A 'NAME' non-Arabic areas. In India, one observes the tendency to drop the i of the izafet in most cases The Persian pisar (son) is rarely used in names, but the form pur occurs, as in Nadirpiir or Piir-i Bahd, the corresponding feminine is dukht, 'daughter', known to us from Turandot, that is, Turandukhl In Persian families andcountries under Persian influence the relation­ ship is usually expressed by the suffix -zada: e.g. Muftizdda (Son of the Mufti), lamalzdda, Taqizdda. This is common among Indian Mus­ lims, and is mostly found with titles, like Nawwabzada. Pirzdda Women are then distinguished by the Hindi feminine ending -i, and thus names like Mubarakzadi (daughter of Mubarakl appear. InTurkeyzade isoften used in leadingfamilies likethe Kdpruluzade or'Ashiqpdsbazdde. or with professions as m Helvacizade, ‘son of the sweetmeat confectioner'. It alternateshoweverwith the Turkish suffix oglu and thus we have the famous folk hero Koroflu 'Son ofthe blind one', themedieval rulingfamily oftheRamazanoglu, orthe Yazicioglu, 'Son of the scribe'. For individuals, oglan (son) was used in former times, as the names of folk poets like Karacodglan show. Families might also simply use the plural to express their common ancestry- Agzibuyiikler are those descended from someone with the nickname ogzfbuyiik, 'with a big mouth'. With the introduction of family-names in Turkey in 1934, many families dropped the traditional suffixes or changed the -oglu into -gd a Necatizade or Necatioilu might become a Necatigil, a Siyavufoglu. Siyavufgil. The suffix -soy (family), is likewise used in family names, as in Cebesoy, related tocebe (harness) and probably abbreviated from cebeci. harnessmaker In Pakistan, especially in Sind, the ending potra, -pota expresses the nasab in a family unit: the Daudpdtds are descendants of one Da'ud. Among the Pathans in Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier, the relevant suffixes for members of a clan denved from one ancestor are ■zay, like Yusufzay, Saddozay. Popalzay (which suffix is dropped in modem times for practical reasons) or, in the case of larger clan units, the suffix is -khel, like 'Isdkbel, Midnkhel or Kakdkhel. Nisba or ‘relation’ The msba refers to the place of birth, residence or origin It is formed in Arabic by adding -lyyun (fl, fem. -iyyatun (iyya) tiPthe place-name or the tribal namp- Hashim — al-Hashimi; Baghdad —al-Raghdddiyya (fora womanfrom that city). Apersoncanhave severalmsbas Muham mad ad-Dimisbqial-Kufi would be originally from Damascus but set­ tled and became famous in Kufa. Some names form irregular aisbas,\" especially those with a long i in the second syllable, which is replaced by a short a: a man from the 10\n\n19.

Irregularitiesoccur, especiallyin foreign names: the Persian cities Rayy and Marw form their nisbas as Razi and Marwazi respec­ tively, Yasi in Turkistan gives Yasawi, Herat not only Herat! but usu­ allyHarawi. The numerousnisbas which have beencarefullycollected by Muslim scholars in works like Sam'ani’s Kitab al-ansdb, reveal the extent of Islamic expansion at particular moments: scholars with the nisba asb-Sbatibi(Xativa in Spain) and al-Fargbaru (from the Farghana in Central Asia), as-Sindbi |from the lower Indus valleyl and at-Tar- nishi (from Tortosa), al-Bukbari (from Bukhara) and at-Tatwani[from Tetuan), az-Zabidi (from Zabid in Yemen) and ash-Shahjahandbadi (from Dehli) show the centers of Islamic culture-even though anisba mightbebomegenerationsaftertheancestorhadlefthisoriginalhome. There are still Landoulsi, 'Andalusian' in Tunisia!” Nisbas can also denote someone's religious or legal persuasion: a follower of the school of Ibn Hanbal is a Hanbali, an adherent of the doctrines of the Mu'tazila, a Mu'tazili) a Shiite believing in the twelve Imams is an Ithna\"ashari (Twelver), and a mystic dealing with the philosophy of illumination, ishraq, an Ishraqi. The nisbas are often derived from professions in the plural: qawaririis someonewho makes glass bottles, kawakibi someone who produces a special kind of nail. These names developed into real family names.11 The nisba can also refer to a proper name or parts of it, meaning ‘belongingtoso-and-so', like BakrifromAbuBakr, Rabimifrom‘Abdur Rahim, Fakbrifrom Fakhraddin, and one might adopt a nisba in order to show one's admiration for a certain hero, as theIndian scholar Shibli (d. 1914) took the nisba Nu'mani out of respect for the great medieval jurist Abu Hanifa Nu'man. The Sufis (the word itself is a nisba from Suf, 'wool') point to their spiritual allegiance by choosing the name of their fraternity like al-Qadiri, ash-Shadhili, or the name of their mas­ ter, Rebmani (from one ‘Abdur Rahman in modem India). No nisba was formed from the Prophet's name, and his descendants through Fatima and her husband ‘Ali are called 'Alawi, i.e. Alids, or in special cases Fafirnii and they add al-Hasani or al-Husayni to their proper names to show from which grandson of the Prophet they descend. Sometimes a nisba points to a custom of the bearer and is thus close to a nickname, as in the case of Ibn al-Bismilli, whose father, a sailor, wouldconstantlysay Bismilldb, 'In thenameofGod',andwastherefore sumamed al-Bismilii.u In compound names, nisbas are formed that take into consideration only certain letters of the original name: a person from Hisn Kayfa (in 1!\n\n20. THE STRUCTURE OF A NAME' Eastern Turkey) would be al-Ha^kafi-, one finds also al-Bu'aqli, from Abu ’Aql, and in the Middle Ages forms like al-'Abdurrahman! were usedbecause'Abdur Rahman was no longerseenasa genitiveconstruc­ tion. Nisbas from professions were equally ungrammatical - someone who was both a qadi and an amir could be called a/Qddamiri. In modem times, when manynisbashavebecome rial familynames, women consequently use the masculine form and call themselves Muna al-'Alamior Magda Nuwayhi, since the nisba is nolonger alive. In Ir>n a longi is used to form the nisba, like Itfahani, Tabrizi, so that the forms coincide with the Arabic nisba. In Turkey the nisba ending, mainly from place names, isIi, which followsTurkish vowel harmony: Ankarali, Izmirli. Istanbullu. In Indo-Pakistan one will find theending wala, (fem. wdli] todenote the same: Poonawala is a man from Poona, Dehliwali, a woman from Dehli, Idpanwala a merchant in Karachi who trades predominantly with |apan. The Sindhi equivalent is -ward, wari. Laqab. nickname.3* The most colourful type of names are the nicknames, laqab, pl. alqdb. As a classical Arabic verse claims: Rarely do your eyes see a man whose inner meaning is not - if you only think! — in his laqab'*’ A laqab is given to a person to distinguish him from others who bear the same name, be it by age, status, or outward appearance. It can be honorific, [tashrifi] or for purposes of identification, (ta'rifl, but also deprecating, for taskhif-, in this case it is usually called nabaf. The ancient Arabs apparently excelled in inventing nasty alqdb for their enemies, for even the Qur'an warns them not to use pejorative sou­ briquets: la tanabazu bi'1-alqdb! (Sura 49/11). The custom of honouring someone by a specific name is traced back by Qalqashandi to the prophets, for Abraham was called KhalilAllah, 'God's friend', and Moses, Kalim Allah, 'the one addressed by God'. The Prophet Muhammad himself became known as al-Amin, ’the trustworthy one', Abu Bakr as a$-$iddiq, 'the most truthful one', and ’Umar as al-Faruq 'the discerning one'. Alqdb very often point to physical characteristics, sach as al-abraf, 'the leper', or al-lahiz, 'the goggle-eyed one', the laqab of the famous ’Abbasid polymath. They can be derived from a profession, as an-Naj- jar, 'the mason'; from religious customs, as az-Zahid, 'the ascetic'; or from an unusual expressionofwhich the individual wasfond. Incidents ■ in one's life could also result in nicknames, as in the famous case of the pre-Islamic poet Ta'abbata Sharran, 'he carried something evil 12\n\n21. THE STRUCTURE OF A NAME under his arm' (which is interpreted as the demoness he carried off in the desert|. As becomes evident from this example, alqab can consist of a full sentence. Somealqab weregiven toattractgood luck; thusa'blackmalodorous slave' was called Kafur, 'camphor'. (Incidentally, the most famous Kafur in Arabic history had the kunya Abu'l-misk, 'father of musk'.) Other alqab were opprobrious in order to avert the evil eye: the caliph al-Mutawakkil has an extremely beautiful slave girl whom he called al-qabiha, 'the ugly one'. It was possible to be called by different alqab in different places, as in the case of the mystic al-Hallaj, a fact that was confusing for the Government of Baghdad?’ Many alqab developed later into family names, like the Iraqi family al-Mala'ika, 'the angels', whose laqab was given to them because of their unity and kindness,11or the Turkish family Peyniryemezgil, 'clan ofhim \"who doesnot eat cheese'\". Among those which developed into family names are the alqab in non-Arab countries which define the bearer's clan or tribe, such as Barias among the Turcomans, Awan in the Punjab, or Afshdr among the Persians. It was even possible to bestow alaqab posthumously: whenHanzala wasslain in the battleofUhud(625 A.D.I the Prophet calledout ‘ghasil al-mala'ika, washed by the angels', for the martyr does not require the normal ritual bath before burial. The different kinds of alqab will be analyzed in more detail in Chapter V. 13\n\n22. II 'Born on Friday’ - the Naming of a Child 'OnDoomsday you will.be called by your names and the names of your fathers - so chose beautiful |or, graceful) names!'1 Thus said the Prophet, who also regarded messengers with a handsome face and a graceful name as a favourable auspice. It is therefore not surprising to find the word Adiguzel (T) His name is beautiful' as a proper name in Malatya. According to another Prophetic tradition, the father has three obligations toward his son: to teach him to write, toselecta goodname for him, and to marry him off when he comes of age.1 The Prophet's pronouncement was directed against the ancientArab custom of calling sons by frightening or harsh names like Harb (War|, $akhr (Rock), Murra (Bitterness), or by names that were given to the child after the first object seen at the time of its birth. Who would like to be called Qunfudh (Hedgehog)’’ Likewise, names given to children on account of theirpersonal characteristics, as isparticularlycommon among the Bedouins and in rural areas in general, were and often still are, appalling: Suwayyid. Suwaydan or Asyud (from the root aswad, black) point to the infant's swarthy looks; Gleimid(= iulaymid] com­ pares the child to a small round pebble, Gredhi (- juraydi] to a 'young rat’. Such names would be used in an urban environment only as a descriptive laqab. Asoutward signsaresupposedtoreflect theinnercondition, children bearing such names were certainly unfortunate, for a beautiful name — so one thought — was also the expression of a beautiful character: adigiizel tadigiizel. Whose name is nice, his taste is also nice’, as the Turkish proverb has it. The name also has the important function of binding the child into the family unit? And thus boys were in many cases called after a deceasedgrandfather, girls afteragrandmother. Ifthegrandmotherwas alive, she might select the granddaughter's name. Among the Arab tribes in early times the maternal grandfather's name was often given to a son. The classical reference for this custom is the statement of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, whose maternal grandfather bore the name Asad 'lion'. In his father's absence his mother called the newborn child by a related name, as he himself stated: 'And I am the one whose mother called him Haydara 'lion'.' After the father's return the name was then chaged to 'Ali. According to Shia tradition, Abu falib had prayed near • the mount Abu Qubays for a name for his son and was given a tablet with emerald script in which 'Ali, 'who will become highest, a'la\" was 14\n\n23. ■BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMING OF A CHILD written.’ That the custom of naming a boy after his grandfather con­ tinuedisevident from theentriesinthebiographicaldictionarieswhere one may find numerous Ahmad ibn 'Umar ibn Ahmad and similar genealogies. Often, a noun denoting'successor' is given alongwith the father'sorgrandfather's name, such asKhalaf, Makhluf, Yakhlaf. Now­ adays, the grandfather's name has often become a family name: 'Umar ibn 'All ibn Mustafa becomes 'U. Mujfa/a. In women's names one can also see this tendency to adopt the grandfather's name: Umm Khalid bint Khalidshows that a woman named hersonafter herfather. Rarely, several children bear the same ancestor's name: Husayn ibn 'All ibn Abi Talib called all his sons 'All; the middle one, sumamed Zayn al-‘abidin, continued the line of the Shia imams. Sometimes a deceased uncle or aunt's name was given: the father's name appears only and not very often, when he died before the boy wasbom. Theonlyexception is Muhammad, anamewhichevery male Muslim should bear; but one avoided naming too many individuals in a family by the same name, and evenwhen a boybore his grandfather's name he would often be called by a nickname, as was customary for example in Tashqurghan.* In Turkey, and it is probably true for most other areas, the midwife gives the child a religious name, orgbbek adi (umbilical name] while cutting the umbilical cord. Three days later the so-called ezan adi is given while reciting three times the adhan, the call to prayer, and whispering the name thrice into the child's right ear. Alternatively, the official name is givenduring the \"aqiqa on the sixth day after birth: the hadith collected by Nawawi recommend the seventh day.’ People oftenseekthe mostblessedhourforperformingthisact,and the official name is usually chosen and given by a venerable personality such as an elderly member of the family. In Turkey the name-giving used to be the right only of the husband's family, in some Sindhi and Gujarati families the father's sister gives the name. A religious leader or, in rural areas, the landlord or owner of the village, was asked to name the child, orelse an employee'spatron. Badauni, thesixteenth-century Mughal historian, tells howhe brought hisnewbornsontothe Emperor Akbar, asking for a blessed name, and as the emperor was reciting duringthose days the invocation YdHadi, 'OThou thatGuidest Right!' hecalled theboy'AbdulHddi. When Badauni returned home the imam urged him to have the whole Qur'an recited to ensure a long life for the boy, but as he did not follow this advice the child died soon after­ wards. Akbar also predicted the birth of the three sons of his comman­ der-in-chief, the Khankhanan \"Abdur Rahim, and gave them Persian nameseven beforetheywerebom.\" This, indeed, isnot unusualespeci­ allyin Shiacircles, foritissaidthat theProphet namedFatima’sunborn 15\n\n24. 'BORN ON FRIDAY.' - THE NAM1NC OF A CHILD childMubsin; but shehad amiscarriage.However, accordingtopopular opinion, the child at least had a name and could not accuse his parents at Doomsday of having left him without a proper name.\" Among Ismailis the Aga Khan is often asked when visiting a place to select names for the children of pregnant women, and he gives them a male or female name for the future baby. Although the father's actual name is generally not used for a son, he may be given a name that is somehow related to the paternal name. Thus when the father is Ibrahim, the son is likely to be called Isma'il or Ishaq, a Da'ud's son would probably be Sulayman orviceversa, and similarly with Ya'qub and Yusuf, or Yahya and Zakariya. Often brothers are all called after the Qur'anic prophets if the father bears the name of a prophet. A similar harmony can be achieved with names consisting of 'abd 'slave of' - and one of the Divine names: 'Abdul 'Afim 'slave of the Mighty' son of 'Abdul Qawiy 'slave of the Strong'. In non-Arabic countries this could lead to the invention of quite non­ sensical names, provided they rhymed nicely: in Hyderabad/Deccan one 'Abduf $amad called his son 'Abdul Gunbad. 'slave of the dome’ Igunbad is a Persian word). Names with ad-din are used in the same way: Husam ad-din (Sword of religionl son of Sinan ad-din (Spear of religion). Ghuldm Murtazd son of Ghuldm Mutfafa belongs to this category,and on a less lofty level the Mughal name Qabldn Beg ibn Shir Beg. 'Mr Leopard son of Mr Lion.' The record for this type of recurring pattern comes from the Deccan, where a gentleman by the name of Abu’l-mahdkim Muhammad Il/san Afzalad-din Yunus 'Ab­ dul Muhit Shahid Allah Khan Basil had seven sons whose names were all constructed like his, so that one of them was Abu'l-mabasin MuhammadMuhsin Rashidad-din Musa'AbdulMuhfi'UbaydAllah Khan Dhakir.11 On the otherhandthesons'namesmay followthe samegrammatical patternas thatof the father: thesons of'Inayat Khan appearas Wilayat, Hidayat-, Shuid'at-. Kardmdt- and Saldmot Khan! Or else the names are formed from the same root letters: Latd'if son of Latif. In some families the initial letterwas usedforgenerations, as in the royal Ghaz- navid house with Maudud ibn Mas'ud ibn Mahmud (all passive parti­ ciples).1' To call children by rhyming or related names is ifl any case quite common - whether it is the classical combination of Hasan, Husayn, and Muhsin, or 'Amr, 'Umayr, and 'Amir. Thus, Amir Payinda Khan of Kabul in the nineteenth century called all his sons from one wife by compounds of dll, ‘heart’: Purdil, Sherdil, Kohandil, Mihrdil Khan. In a pious Bengali family we find Nural-huda. ‘lightofrightguidance', Shams ad- duhd, 'Sun of the morning light', Badr ad-du/a, 'Full moon 16\n\n25. 'BORN ON FRIDAY- - THB NAMING OF A CHILD of the darkness', and Khayr al-buda. 'Best guidance’, with high-sound­ ing expressions alluding to Qur'anic verses. Two Pakistani musician brothers are called Badr ad-din and Qamar ad-din, ‘full moon' and 'moon of religion' respectively. A recent book on child-rearing in Tur­ key even offers appropriate names for twins: two girls might be called Serab (sarab) and Mehtap Imahtab), 'Mirage' and ’Moonlight’, two boys, Bdlent and Levent, High' and 'Young hero', or Kutlu and Mutiu, both meaning 'happy, fortunate'. In thecase ofboy andgirl twins, their names can be taken from classical love-stories, like Kerem and Asli, or consist of combinations like Alev and Ate}, 'Flame' and 'Fire'.1* As these names reflect the cultural interests of the parents they are likely to change from time to time. At different times different names are fashionable, partly because of popular figures ofthe time who have such names and partly for aesthetic reasons. As formerly the heroesof the faith orof early Islamic history were referred toin favourite names, it is nowoften political slogans and catchwords. ATurkish girl'sname was Anayasa 'Constitution', and Nidal and Kifah, meaning 'snatching away'and 'fight', appeared in EgyptduringtheArab-Israeli war.Triplets bom in Izmir, Turkey, were called Hurriyet, Ubuwet.and Musavat (Arabic: hurriyat, ukhuwwat. musdwat). 'Freedom, Fraternity, Equal­ ity'. Political figures lend their names to children, thus Menderes or his first name, Adnan, occurred frequently during the late 'fifties in Turkeywhereabout thesametimetripletsinEgyptwere named Gamal (Carnal 'Abdun Nasir), Nehru and Tito.'* Asin the West movie stars and singers- like Elvis - are commemor­ ated inhundredsofnames, soactresses and singerslike Umm Kulthum are now among the cultural heroes of youngfamilies, and in more than one family known to me a boy was called after a film star whom his motheradmired while expectinghim. Thus a westernized Ismaili fam­ ily called their son Omar -a name otherwise avoided by Shiites-after the actor Omar Sharif, and among the Turkish workers in Germany famous football players are name-giving models. At present, there is on the one hand agrowingtendency to invent new names foreuphonic reasons (as in Egypt the girls' names Hiyam or Siham, which actually means a camel's disease),\" or to adopt Western names into the Islamic pattern and, with the mobility typical of our time, parents choose names which are easy to pronounce for foreigners and do not carry a negative or ugly meaning in English or German.\" A Turkish boy with the beautiful name Ufuk (ufuq 'Horizon') would probably suffer terri­ bly in an English-speaking country. There are, however, still families in the PersiAnate world which aspire to a high style in names and call their children Firdausior Sa'di after thetwogreat Persianpoets, thenumberofIqbalsinIndo*Pakistan 17\n\n26. 'BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMING OF A CHILD in homage to the greatphilosopherpoet Iqbal (1877-1938) isquite large, and recently, in the tendency to emphasize the Islamic heritage, classical Islamic namesorhigh-sounding compoundsare again becom­ ing more popular. The joy over the birth of a child, particularly a son, is expressed in all Islamiclanguages with namesthatcorrespondexactlytoourTheodore, 'God-given'. In classical Arabic, 'Ata' Allah, 'Aflyat Allah or Hibat Alldh, all meaning 'God's gift’, are common, an Egyptian girl in our day is called Minnat Alldh, 'The gratitude owed to God'. This type of name seems even more widespread in the Persian and Turkish areas. Persians will use dad, 'he gave', and call a boy Allah-dad, Ilah dad or Khuda-dad, all meaning 'God gave',- itoccursalsoin combinationwith one of the Divine names: Rahman-dad. Rahim-dad, and even $abur- dad. One can also substitute -bakhsh 'gift' for dad (in Pakistan this is often spelled bux), and form names like Alldh Bakhsh. Ilahibakhsh or even, with the old Persian word for God, Yazddnbakhsh. In Turkish the idea of 'given' is expressed by the verbal form virdS, bird!, berdi, 'he gave', in regionally varying pronounciation: Alldh herds, AllahvirdS and often with one of the Divine names such as HaqqverdS. KhdliqbirdS, /abbarbirdS, Subl/dnverdS. The combination with the Persian noun is also found: KhuddberdS, but predominant is the purely Turkish TaghribirdS(taghribeing the Arabictransliteration oftheTurkish tangri, tengri}. Names like MengubirtS, 'The Eternal has given' belong to this category. Allahberen, 'God is giving', occurs in Iran in Turkish families. In the Indian languages like Urdu, Sindhi and Panjabi the same prin­ ciple is followed, with Indian verbs replacing the Persian or Turkish ones: Alldh-diya, Rahim-dina, Dhani-dina. Alldh vardyd '— has brought', Alldh-rakhiyd, '- has placed' or Sa'in dSno The Noble One has given' express the same feelingofgratitude as does the North Afri­ can /dbu Alldh (= id'a bihi Alldh], 'God has brought him.'“ But what, one wonders, is the story of someone called Diw-dad, 'given by a demon’? Is he a distant relative of Ibn linnS, 'Son of a jinn'! The feeling of gratitude expressed in such names is not always directed toward the creator; it may be that the Prophet, a Shia imam or a saint is considered to have helped the parents wfio were waiting forachild.: 'Afa'Muhammador'Afa'Husaynare not rarein the Middle East; Dad-'AIS, Ikram 'AIS 'Kindness of 'All' or Haydarbakhsh belong to the Shia nomenclature. Nabibakhsh 'Gift of the Prophet’ is quite common in Pakistan, while Ghauth-bakhsh, 'Gift of The Help' (i.e., 'Abdul Qddir Gilani), and Qalandar-bakhsh /La'l Shahbaz Qalandar of Sehwanl point to the saint whose intercession was requested to 18\n\n27. ■BORN ON FRIDAY’ - THE NAMING OF A CHILD obtain a son. Nur-bakhsh 'Gift of the Light' occurs in the Shia Persian Sufi tradition. Another type of name expressing gratitude are compounds with wordslikefadl(TPfail]‘favor, grace'and the name ofGod, the Prophet, or an imam; they rank from Fadi Allah, Fadi al- Ghani, -ar-Razzdq, ■al-Mannan and Fail Rabbi |cf. Sura 27/40) to Fail Ahmad and Fail 'Ali (sometimes abbreviated to Fazli], One may place here also names beginning with ihsan, 'beneficence', like Ihsan rabbi or Ihsan-i haqq, which are used, like those beginning with 'indyat 'providence' or in'dm 'kindgift', mainly in Indo-Pakistan. There, one encounters not only 'Inayat ar-rahman or -ar-rahim but even'Inayat-i Kibriya, 'Providenceof theDivineGlory'. In'dm ul-haqq and combinations with luff 'kindness' belong to the same category. Here too, the name Allah can be replaced by one of the Most Beautiful Names: LutfAllah ILuffullah). Luffal-Barietc. Even the wordfayd (P fayi) ‘emanation, overflowing grace' is used, as in Fayi ar-rahman. Not only the parents' gratitude to God and the Prophet, or a saint, is expressed in names but also the hope for a long and happy life, for the Prophet urged his community to use names of good augury. Barakat 'Blessings', Sa'adat felicity', Zafar \"Victory' may be chosen. In the Persianate world one will find - for both sexes - combinations with khush, 'nice', like Khush-hal 'happy', Kbusbdil 'of happy heart' or else with bib 'good', like Bihzad 'Well bom', Bihruz or Ruzbih 'Good day’, Bihnam 'Ofgoodname', aswell asNdmvar 'famous', Kamrdn 'Success­ ful' or Farrukhzad ’Of happy birth'. In Turkish, combinations with quf, ’happiness’ are known from ancient times, like quflugh (modem Kudu) 'happy', or U/jur (Good luck). Aykut and Gunkut, (Happy moon and Happy Sun, or, Happy Day) are more recent variants. In former times, a Turkish boy might be greeted as Aydogmuf. Arslandogmuf, or Gundogmuf - The moon a lion -, a sun is bom' and wishes for his future life were expressed in heroic names like Korkmas (qorqmaz) 'Fearless', Orkmez 'he does not shy away', Yilmaz 'unyielding'. And when the founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur, was preparing to conquer the north-west of India, he called his son Hinddl, Take India'. In this connection one may mention the custom of giving military names to boys: in Eastern Anatolia names like Asker'soldier', Binbashi'Major', Alay 'Regiment' can be found; and Okumuf‘Someonewhocanread,'certainlyexpresses a wish.“ In Arabic, expecially in countries that formed part of the Ottoman Empire, Turkish titles like Basha, or Shalabi (- felebi), 'Nobleman'canbefound. Theyallaremeant toensureagloriousfuture for the child; and if after a long series of boys a long-awaited girl is 19\n\n28. BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMINC OF A CHILD bom, she may be called Masarrat, 'Joy' or, in all languages, 'Wish' Munya (A), Arzu or Arman (P) or Dilek (T). However, despite all these good wishes expressed in their names small children died all too frequently. As in the West 'earthy' names were sometimes used for a child bom after many deaths, (cf as Erdmuthe. Erdmannin German) in order to bind the little soul to the earth before it can fly away, so the Muslims have a number of names which were originally meant to secure a child's life. There are also some customs to protect a child thus endangered. For example the child may be called by a name from roots meaning 'to live', such as Yahya |from hayya, 'to live'), Ya'mur (from 'amara 'to flourish') or Ya'isb and the wellknown feminine 'A'isha (from 'ysh 'to live'). The combination Abu’l-baqd Ya'ish is particularly strong, as baqa means 'remaining, duration'; Yabqa, 'he remains', from this same root also occurs. In the Persianate areas one finds /avid 'eternal', or Manda 're­ mained', while among the Turks Ya$ar (yashar) “he lives' and even Olmez (he does not die, immortal) occur, verbal forms from durmak 'to remain', are frequent, like Duran 'remaining', Dursun 'he/she may remain' or Durmuj 'has remained'. In the Indian environment, the root ii, 'to live', serves the same purpose - lid, /inun. /iwa, /una and their feminine counterparts Jian, /indo, fini, fiwi are used in the Punjab.” A good Muslim custom is to name the child 'abd, 'servant of-' with one of those Divine names that point to eternity of life, like 'Abdul Hayy,of the Living', 'Abdul Baqi, of the Everlasting' or 'Abdud Da'im,of the Ever-remaining', etc. One would also avoid giving the child the name of a family member or friend who has tragically died, and if someone in a group bears the name of an individual who has prematurely died one says in Konya: 'His name is the same, his age may not be the same'.M Instead of giving a child, for whose survival one fears, a strong and positive name, one can also do the contrary, that is, call it by an oppro­ brious name to cheat theevilspiritsthat surround itandwant tosnatch it away. In Arabic one finds Yamut, Tamut, 'he/she dies', in the Punjab Machbai, 'Child of death'. In Tunis a name like Chebinou (“ shay' baynahu) 'what is common between him (and a jinn)' is used15 while among the Turks a child bom after many children have died is often calledAdsiz, 'without name', because as longas thechild hasno name, nobody can practice black magic against it.“ (cf. Balasim = bila ism, 'without name' in Southern Iraqi. In classical Arabic tradition names like Murr, 'bitter', Kalb, \"Dog' or Harb, 'war' weresupposed tofrighten thejinnandarestillusedinTunisiaand elsewheredespitetheProphet's aversion to such names, likewise, names derived from the root ghlb, 'tobevictorious’, can be used toemphasizethat thechildwillovercome 20\n\n29. BORN ON FRIDAY- - THE NAMING OF A CHILD the evil spirits. As one often dresses up little boys in girls' clothes to distract the interest of the jinns, so one may also give them the ugliest possible names, for instance Zibalah, 'Garbage' (Egypt, or Gonahra. 'Dunghill' (Punjabi- Chilra, 'Louse', occurs also in the Punjab.” Kishile, 'a piece of rough woollen cloth by which a pack animal's face is covered' (Khuzistan), belongs to this very widespread category.\" And while Buldqi, 'Nose-ring' (the sign of the married woman in northern India, is a perfectly honourable name for a woman it has a very negative connotation when given to a boy.” Among the ntes to ensure the life of an infant there is an interesting Tunisian custom which is also connected with names: a parent begs at the doors of forty men by the name of Muhammad and buys a new dress from the money thus acquired, which supposedly protects the baby.” In the Punjab and elsewhere the infant is given to a faqir and then begged backas a kind ofalms. Children who have undergone such a ceremony can then be called Ghulam Bhik, 'Servant of the beggar’ or Khayrati ('Alms',. The child can also be given away immediately afterbirth and bought back forafew cowriesorcoins, which is reflected in names like Bechai 'Sold' (Punjab, or Satkandi 'Seven cowries' (id.| In Turkeya woman wasonce called Bejbine, 'Forfive thousand'. Simi­ lar customs are known from Bengal and Afghanistan. In Tashqurgan in northern Afghanistan, a child that is considered to be in danger is passed between the jawbones of a wolf and thengiven the name 'Wolf', gorg (P) or bdrum.” It is a moot question whether one should give a baby bom next after a deceased child the name of the dead one, or avoid it,- both customs are found - unless the new baby is simply called 'Substitute', 'iyad or 'autf.a Should the familybe afflicted by misfortune afterachild's birth, one tends tochange itsname afterconsultingwith religiousspecialists; the same is done in Turkish areas, especially Istanbul, when a child is nervous, naughty, or difficult to handle because (so one thinks] 'its name is too heavy forit'.“ An easy way to remember a child’s birthday or at least the season during which it was bom, is to give it a name that indicates the day or time of the year; just as we know people called Noel, Dominique, 'bom on Sunday', or Apnl. The names of the months serve the same purpose. Ramadan (Ramzan, Ramjan, diminutive Rumaydanl, theholy month of fasting, is particularly blessed and therefore often remembered in names. Rajab, Sha'ban and Muharram occur likewise owing to their religious significance, while $afar Ias in $afar Khoja. Safar Bey] reminds the Shiites of the fortieth day after Imam Husayn's martyrdom, and the Muslims in general of the beginning of the 21\n\n30. BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMING OF A CHILD Prophet's last illness. Children bom in Ramadan may be called $d'im (f. $a'ima, 'fasting’) or Ruza (P), Oruf (Tj, 'Fast'; and I remember a Turkish woman called Sa'ime Oruf. The name Shahr Allah, 'God's month', can also be used for a child bom in Ramadan. The name of the month can be combined with other names, like Ramjan 'All (Gujarat, Bengal); and the Persian, and even more Indo-Muslim, ten­ dency to add ad-din, 'of the religion’ to every conceivable noun leads to forms like Rajab ad-din or Sha'ban al-milla [milla religiouscom­ munity).1* In the Persianate areas Mihrican be used for a woman bom in the month of Mihr, September, and numerous are names for both sexes connected with Adhar, March-April. An Indian woman's name Laylatulqadr, shows clearly her birthday in the sacred night of Ramadan, and so does Mr Ramzan Idi's name. It is a special joy when a child is bom on one of the two feasts (’id), especially on the 'id ul-fijrat the endof the fastingmonth. Thusnames like 'Idu, Ido (Panjabi), EidMuhammad(Baluchistan), al-'Aid. Bel-Aid, al-'Ayyad. 'Ayyadi, or 'Ayyada (North Africa) occur frequently and so does the Turkish equivalent of 'Id, Bayram. If a boy is bom on the 'id al-adha. 'the Feast of offering', during the pilgrimage season, he may be called Baqr'idi (Punjabi; and Qurbanverdi \"The Sacrifice has given' is found amongTurks in Iran. A Hajj |Tunis), Hdjji(Iran) or Hajjigeldi, The pilgrim came' (T), is bom in the month of Dhu’lhijja or when the pilgrims return from the hajj to Mecca. Children bom on the Prophet's birthday, milad an nabi, on 12Rabi' al-awwal, may be named Maulud (T Mevlut), Mauludiyya. Miloud (Tunis), and a birthday on the day of the Prophet's heavenly journey, mfraj, on 27 Rajab, can result in names like Mi'raj (also transcribed Mehraj) or Mi'raj ad-din (Pakistan). If the child is bom in mid-Sha'ban, in the laylat al-bara’a, he may be called Berat (T), while the name 'Asbur(f. 'AshuraBegum) may indicatethebirthon the tenthofMuhar­ ram, 'Ashura day. Children bom on the death anniversary of a saint, 'urs (lit. 'marriage', viz. ofthe soul with God)appearsometimes as'Urs or 'Ursdn, and when the birth happened in a period when a certain shrine was visited, the child's name may be Ziyarat, 'Pious visit'. In areas under Persian influence, Nauruz, 'New Year', the vernal equinox, occurs frequently. The days of the week can also be used as names:*a child bom on Friday may be called /urn'a (Cuma) or (P) Adina. while Thursday lends its name to Khamis. Khamisu Khan. Khamsi (Swahili) or, for a girl, Khemisse 1= khamisa)\" InTashqurghan, on the otherhand, Thursday is never used as a name as it implies bad luck.“ Wednesday, arba'a. appears in North African names as Raba' or Larbeh, while Saturday's children can be Sebti or Sabbati. In Iran 1 found one Pir Yakshanbahi, 22\n\n31. 'BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMING OF A CHILD from yakshanbah. 'Sunday'. It is even simpler to remember the season of the birth, especially in rural areas, as is evident from Enno Littmann's remark that a Bedouin boy by name of Fallah, 'Fellah', was bom when the fellahin were ploughing. *’ Already in ancient Arabia names like Rab'ior Sayfi, ‘Of the spring' or ‘the summer' respectively, were used {always without the definite article), and among the names collected in Tunis all four seasons are represented: Rab'i, Sifi {from fayf, 'summer'), Kharifi {au­ tumn) and Chatoui (= shitawi, from shita', 'winter'). Matir is an Arab child bom on a rainy day (from ipafor: tain) and Littmann found a numberof names in the southern Hauran which recalled therare event of snow: Thalj. Thalli. Thallai, Thdlii. Thalia.” Again, some memor­ able event of the year can be preserved in a name: a child in the Punjab bomduringafaminemaybecalledAkdli,”andarecent,moreenioyable occasion was the late Aga Khan's Diamond Jubilee, which resulted in numerous young Ismailis called Diamond: the same happened during his Platinum Jubilee, so that a number of Platinum are found in the Ismaili community. Insomecountries, especiallyinIndia, children are sometimes named according to the astrological requirements of the hour of birth.*0 As each hour has a ruling planet the name should ideally begin with one of the planet's letters. If a boy is bom in the hour ruled by the moon, qamar, he should be called Qamar ad-din, or else by using the last letter of qamar, names like Rahim-bakhsh can be constructed; if it is a girl, Rabi'a or Rafi'a would be auspicious, for someone under the influenceofMars, Mirrikh. appropriate names would beMirdnbakhsh, Maryam, Khayrulldh and Khadija, and so on. This tradition is still alive: a young Indian friend of mine, bom on 7 Safar, bears the name Kdzim, as this is the day of Imam Musa al-Kazim, but he uses his astrological name Tdlib. Another person's name was recently changed by his Sufi master into a lucky astrological name.*1. A number of personal names have geographical connotations. The reason for calling a child by a geographical name is not always clear: is a Mecca Beg or Madina Khan bom in that place, or do the parents merely hope that he will reach the sacred place! Mecca as the surname of people who performed the pilgrimage, or underwent a miraculous adventure during their journey to the holy city, is attested from India. Names like Dimisbq Khan or Ghazni Khan seem to point out the native place, but the name Najaf (Nazaf in India) shows clearly that the person was the scion of a pious Shiite family who either had per­ formed the pilgrimage tothis sacred burialplace of'Ali in Iraq, orhoped that their child might be blessed with such a visit. One finds Hijaz Khan and, among theQaraqoyunlu Turcomans, Mifr, 'Egypt' Beg Con-\n\n32. BORN ON FRIDAY' - THE NAMING OF A CHILD nections with the birthplace are clear in the case of the Bedouin girl Nfeyid, ’little sand-desert', who was bonrin the Nefud desert.*’. On the other hand, Darya Khan, 'sea, big river', may have been called thus for his generosity or greatness. It seems that geographical names are used more frequently for women than for men r perhaps because the Arabic ard, 'earth, ground' is a feminine word. As Dunya, 'this world', Kayhan (P), 'world' and Kishwar |P| ’land’ are used for women, the names of specific areas also occur: Sistdn Khanim, Iran. 'Iraq or Turan Khatun are still found in the Middle East; and as in Iran a Tehran Bibi can be found, in Tunisia Tunis and Tourzeur appear in women's names.*\" Medina has become a woman's name in Bengal because the heroine of a medieval romance issocalled. InTurkey namesofrivers are found: Tuna, 'Danube', Dijla, Dicle, Tigris' and Idil, 'Volga' were quite fashionable in the 1940s. In modem Iran one could even encounter girls by the name of Amrika, 'America'.\n\n33. Ill Help from God - Religious Name-Giving One can imagine my shock when I read one morning in the Pakistan Times theheadline: 'Nasrum Minallah diesinroadmishap.'Howcould Nafrun min Allah, 'Help from God' (here spelled according to the Qur’anic pronunciation with an assimilated m) be connected with any mishap at all? The poor man, so I understood then, was one of the numerous Mus­ lims whose elders open the Qur'an at random to select their child's name; and theireyehadfallenonSura61/13.Thiscustomiswidespread in the Indian subcontinent and in other, predominantly non-Arab, countries; and in many cases it leads to strange combinations, as the parents usuallydo not know enoughArabic to understand the implica­ tions of certain expressions. The biographer of the eighteenth-century Indian poet and scholar Azad Bilgrami tells us that one day someone knocked at Azad's door in Aurangabad and when asked his name, replied: 'Ba'du bi'd-din', whereupon the scholar refused to talk to him because of the evil connotation of the words |Sura 95/7: 'And what makesyou deny after that the ludgmentV). The hero of Sarshar's Urdu novel Fasana-i Azad bears the name Mirza A-lam nashrah, 'Did We not open |your breast]?' (Sura 94/1), which may well have been taken from life; and a Turkish author's name is Uzlifat, 'brought near' (Sura 81/13: 'When Paradise is brought near'). Names like Shams wa'd-duha 'Sun and moming-light' (Sura 91/1), an-najm ath-thaqib, The radiant star' (Sura 86/3) and al 'urwat al- wuthqa. 'the firmest handle' (Sura 2/157 and 37/21) occur; however, when fabrun iamil. 'Fine patience' (Sura 12/59) isgiven to an Egyptian girl the implied meaning may also be that there are already too many daughters in the family? Women with names like Asra, ‘He journeyed by night'(Sura 17/1)or Yusrd, 'Ease' (Sura 87/8,92/7) canalso befound. Aninterestingdevelopment is that ofNafuh, derivedfrom theQur'anic expression taubatan na^uhan 'sincere repentance' (Sura 66/8) which appears already in Rumi's Mathnavi as the name of the mischievous servant in the ladies' bath who then 'repented sincerely'? People called A'udhu, '1 seek refuge’ exist, and Qul huwa Allah 'Say: He is God' (Sura 112/1) is the ancestor of a Shia sayyid family, while Bismillah 'in the name of God', Insha Allah 'if God wills’ and Masha' Allah (the latter, in Egypt, also feminine)1occur quite frequently among Pathans, but also now and then in other parts of the Muslim world - as in the case of the Jewish astromomer Manasseh who adopted,-in the early 25\n\n34. HELP FROM GOD- - RELIGIOUS NAME-GIVING Middle Ages, the name Mdsha'Alldh Lately it has become fashionable in Egypt and probably in most Islamic countries to name children after concepts taken from the Qur'an like Rafraf (Sura 55/76), Istabraq, or Sundus, the ‘brocade’ mentioned in Sura 76/21 and elsewhere: the latter name is, incidentally, also found in Anatolia . There is still another method to avail oneself of the power of the Qur'an to bless: instead of taking a word or sentence, one takes the firstletterofthe page openedtodetermine thechild's name. Theactual name is then often formed to constitute a sequence to the father's name; eg., when the father is Shardfat 'All and the first word on the page isdhakirin, the letterdh determinesthe name, and the baby could be called Dhabanat 'All or some similar form. This method however can lead to the formation of meaningless names in a population of non-Arab background, verbs can even be used as nouns: as in a case in Hyderabad where one 'AbdunNaim tookthe Qur’anic wordnuqim, \"We establish' (Sura 18/105) to form his son's name which he wanted to rhyme with na'im - and the boy was called 'Abdun Nuqim 'the slave of We establish’ Qur'amc expressions occur also in nicknames, the Persian Sufi Naim ad-din Kubra obtained his soubriquet Kubra from the expression at-tammat alkubra, ‘the greatest disaster' (Sura 79/34). An often-quoted baditb states that 'the names which God loves best are 'Abdullah and 'Abdur Rahman’ ‘ These two indeed occur very fre­ quently in the Muslim world. The word 'abd can be connected with any of the ninety-nine Most Beautiful Names of God, and the combin­ ation appears in transcription as 'Abdul-, Abdal, 'Abd a!-, Abdel. In many cases, the ' (the Arabic letter 'nyn| is not marked in the translit­ eration, and the rule that the 1 of the Arabic definite article should be assimilated to the so-called sun-letters (t, th. d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ?, d. t>?> 1 and n) is often violated, the correct pronounciation is in such cases 'Abdur Rahim. 'Abdus Sabur, etc. Sometimes Divine names which are not given in the generally accepted lists printed at the beginning of modem copies of the Qur'an can be found,' for example 'Abdul lamil, relating to the hadith that 'God is beautiful, iamil, and loves beauty', or 'Abdul Akbar, which points to the beginning of the call to prayer, Alldhu akbar, 'God is greater [than anything) \"Parents will, of course, ordinarily chose one of the iamali or lutfi Divine names, that is, one that expresses God's kindness and mercy (Zarif. rahim, wadud), forgiveness (ghafur, ghaffar) or generosity (korim). Thus, names like 'Abdul Lafifor 'AbdulGhaffarbyfaroutweightheothercombinations, although some lalali, i.e. ‘majestic’ names like iabbar or qahbar are alsocommonly used. ThenameoftheAmerican basketballplayer Karim 26\n\n35. ■HELP FROM COD’ - RELIGIOUS NAME GIVING 'Abdullabbar, iscertainlyfittingasit pointsboth tohisgiganticsuture and his relianceonTheOverpoweringOne. AnotherAmericanconvert, a painter, selected the name 'Abdul Mufawwir, 'slave of the One That Gives Forms'. But nobodywouldcall his son 'Abdul Mumitor-Khafid, 'slave of Him Who Slays' or'- Who Lowers.' As with other types of names, certain compounds are favoured in specific areas. Thus, 'Abdur Raqib and 'Abdul Kdfi are frequent in modem Yemen. Sometimes the normal form of the Divine names is slightly changedso thathafiz insteadofthe normalhafiz,majidinstead of majid is found: e.g 'Abdul Majid. Comparatively rare are combin­ ations with more abstract Divine names, such as Abduz Zahir, 'slave ofthe Outwardly Manifested', and evenrarerstill isitscontrast'Abdul Batin, of the Inner Hidden'. Likewise 'Abdul Awwal (of the First) occurs at times, while 'Abdul Akhir, '— of the Last’ is rarely, if ever, used. Emphasis is laid on God's unity and unicity, and the simple 'Abdullah is separated into 'AbdulIlah, 'slave of the God'. God's posi­ tion as theonlyobject ofpraise appearsin nameslike 'AbdulMahmud, 'slave of the Praised One'. 'Abd rabbihi, 'slave of his Lord' or even 'Abd rabb an-nabiy of the Prophet's Lord' can be found. 'Abduhu, 'His slave' is, however, generally accepted as being a name of the Prophet and therefore frequent |cf. Sura 17/1, 53/9). (See p. 31.) In the catagory called by Caetani ’pseudo-theophoric names'* the Divine name is replaced by an abstract noun: 'Abdus Subhdn, derived from the exclamation Subhdn Alldh! 'Glorified be God!' belongs here and, even more, names like 'Abdud Din or 'Abdul Burhan, 'slave of the religion' or 'of the proof'; 'Abdul Fath, which occurred especially in Qajar Iran 11721-1925), may have the connoution of fathun qarib, ‘and near victory' (Sura 63/13) which is so often found in Shia inscrip­ tions. That a contemporary Christian theologian who worksforChris­ tian-Muslim dialogue should have adopted the pseudonym 'Abd at- tafahum, 'Slave of mutual understanding', is highly fitting. (Inciden­ tally, among Christians, names like 'Abdul Masih or 'Abduf Salib, 'slave of Christ' or 'of the cross' are in quite frequent use. These compounds which contain one of the Divine names are regarded as bearing a special sanctity: The Mughal emperorHumayun, who never uttered the name of God or the Prophet unless in a state of ritual purity, would address people by such names as 'Abdul to avoid a desecration of the Divine name.’ 'Abdul is nowdays frequently used among Muslims, even in the assimilated form: young 'Abdu?

'HELP FROM GOD’ - RELIGIOUS NAME-GIVING bear one of the Prophet's names, is particularly efficacious * The diminutive of 'abd is 'ubayd, but it seems to be formed almost exclusively from 'Abdullah -hence the numerous'Ubaydullahs. Usu­ ally, it is the Divine name that undergoes a change for hypocoristic purposes, suchasJabburfrom'AbdulJabbar, Jannii\" from'Abdu?$ani'.’ The feminine equivalent is amat, 'slave girl', like the frequentAmatul Karim, often shortened to Karima . This kind of abbreviation corresponds to the tendency to leave out the 'abd completely and to invent formslikeHaqqifrom ‘Abdul Haqq, 'Abdi from 'Abdullah, or Hamid from 'Abdul Hamid. The witty jour­ nalist Shorish Kashmiri, seated during a conference in Lahore between Justice S. A. Rahman and Khwaja A. Rahim, joked about his good for­ tune to 'be placed between Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahirri. It is neverthe­ less somewhat weird, and should shock every pious Muslim, to see in modem telephone directoriessomany Divinenames appearingasfam­ ily names, like Haq IHaque, Huq etc.], Wahid, Chaffar etc, or to listen to a telephone conversation between Qudrat-i-Khuda [God's might) and Ghuldm Nabi (servant of the Prophet) which begins with 'Khuda (God) speaking’, and then 'Here is Nabi (the prophet) speaking.. The word 'abd should be used exclusively with Divine names. How­ ever, mainly in non-Arab countries, it has been and still is used with the names of the Prophet (e.g., like 'Abdur Rasul. 'Abdun Nabi), or the names of Shia imams like 'Abdur Rida, 'Abdul Mahdi. The Saudi authorities -so 1 have been told - will force pilgrims with such names to change them into combinations such as 'Abd rabb ar-Ridd which are theologically more acceptable forms. To express one's status as servant of the Prophet or the imam one should use either the Arabic ghuldm 'servant', like Ghuldm Rasul, or a Persian or Turkish word like banda, qul, quli ('slave'). Interestingly, these latter words are also combined with Divine names in non-Arab areas. In pre-Safavid Iran, 'Abdullah was changed in Khuddbanda,\" while the Turkish qul appears somewhat later to form names like Alldbquli, Rahmanquli. Qadirquli etc. In Central Asia one can even find Maulanaqul, 'slave of our Lord'. Another hadith urges the faithful: 'Call your children by the names of the prophetsI’)11and itgoeson tostate that the most disgraceful names for a believer are Harb, 'War', and Murra, 'Bitterness' and that people named Malik will have to suffer on Doomsday as there is nopossessor, malik, but God. Despite this wellknown tradition, the caliph \"Umar (634-44) opposed the use of prophets' names, perhaps out of fear lest they be disgraced by constant use, yet, many of the Prophet's compan­ ions called their sons by the names of messengers mentioned in the 28\n\n37.

One can still find all thetwenty-eight Qur'anicprophets either with their full namesorderivatives, although some of them, like Hud, are now comparatively rare. Thanks to the veneration due to Abraham (Ibrahim) as the ancestor of the Arabs and first builder of the Kaaba, his name ts dear to the pious, and so is his surname Khalil Allah, 'God's Friend', often only Khalil. (In the same way a common abbreviation of Ibrahim is Ibish, sometimes also Ibbo.) Abraham's sons Isma'il Dhabih Allah, 'Slaughtered by God' and Ishaq |Isaac) appear often, andso does Ya'qub (Jacob) and hisson Yusuf(Joseph), sometimescalled Kan'an (T Kenan}, the epitome of beauty. Musa, the KalimAllah, 'Addressed by God' is among the favourite names; his father-in-law Shu'ayb is also re­ presented (especially in India) as are Ayyub (Job), the patient sufferer, Nuh (Noah), Da'ud and Sulayman. Thus, from Adam to 'Isa (Jesus, even with the appellation Masih, 'Christ') and his relatives Zakariyd and Yahya(John the Baptist) everyprophet is found in Muslim nomen­ clature, including Ilyas and Idris, who are supposed to have entered Paradise alive. The mysterious prophet-saint al-Khaiiir (Khidr, Khizir, Hizir}, the guide of the wayfarers and genius of greenery and rivers, also lends his name to boys. As in the Christian tradition names of angels are used, although there is a difference of opinion whether or not this is permissible. There are certainly people called after the archangels Mika'il (Michael) or fibrd'il. Jibril (Gabriel). In Persian the simple Firishta, 'angel', appears, and Melek [mal'ak} 'angel' is a com­ mon name for Turkish women. The gatekeeper of Paradise, Ridwan (developed out of 'God's pleasure', ridwan, without which no one can enter Paradise) gives his name to men and, with a feminine ending, to women: Ridwana. If the names of earlier prophets are surrounded by an aura of blessing and protective power, how much more is the name ofthe final Prophet bound to bring blessing to those who bear it!” 'Your name is beautiful, you yourself are beautiful, Muhammad,' sings a medieval Turkish poet and expresses well the feeling inspired by this name. 'It would not hurt any of you if in his house were one or two Muhammad',” said the Prophet himself; who also reportedly stated, 'If someone has four sons and does not call any of them by my name, he has wronged me.'1’ Did not ahadith qudsi, an extra-Qur'anic revelation, promise that everyone who is called Muhammad will enter Paradise! And is it not said that angels come to the house in which a Muhammad dwells! One expects the Prophet to be mysteriously con­ nected with those who share his name. Busiri, the thirteenth-century authorofthe Burda, themost famousArabicencomiumo«theProphet, 29\n\n38. HELP FROM COD' - RELIGIOUS NAME GIVING expresses this idea when, smitten with illness, he says toward the end of his poem: For since I have been given the name of Muhammad, he has for me an obligation. He, who is most perfect in fulfilling all his duties among the creatures. . For the Prophet would certainly help an ailing person who is named after him. Besides this deep trust in the efficacy of the Prophet's name there was also a profound sense of awe and respect which induced some people never to pronounce the name of Muhammad unless in a state ofritual purity. Asthesixteenth-century Indo-Persian poet\"Urfi sings: A thousand times I wash my mouth with musk and with rose water. And still, to speak your name is absolute impudence!11 If a boy is called Muhammad and has to be scolded, or if a grown-up Muhammad is a liar ora thief, what is to be done lest the blessed name be polluted? One way out is to vocalize the consonants somewhat differently, eg., as Mihammad. Mahammad, Mub (mainly in North Africa) or Mehmed in Turkey, where the full name is reserved for 'our Lord the Prophet' (peygamber efendimiz], Forms like Mdmd in West Africa, Memo among the Kurds or just a simple Mim are also used.1' Thenameof the Messenger, however, shouldnever bementionedwith­ out adding the formula of blessing or an honorific title to it.1’ In this connection it is revealing that the Bengali librarian Saif-ul-Islam remarks in his notes concerning the cataloguingof Muslim names that as 'most Muslims would object to an entry under the Prophet's name, the entry should be made under the element directly preceding it, e.g. under Nur Muhammad, Dewan Muhammad, etc.'” Such concern is apparently not felt when dealing with Divine names such as Haq, Rahman etc., as we saw earlier. It seems that in the course of time Muhammad was generally augmented by other names, such as MuhammadAkhtar. Muhammad Hamidullah, etc., or used to form the second part of compounds as in Adina Muhammad, Yar Muhammad, etc.“ There was also another way to secure the blessings df the Prophet's name, for Muhammad was not his only name. The Muslims surround their beloved Prophet with numerous names, often ninety-nine ascor­ responding to the ninety-nine Divine Names, and these asma'sharifa, 'noble names', are nowadays often printed at the end of copies of the Qur'an. Some authors enumerate more than two thousand names for the Prophet,manyofwhicharedevelopedoutofQur'anic expressions. 30\n\n39. HELP FROM GOD' - RELIGIOUS NAME-CIVING The very root hmd with its connotation of laud and praise, which lies at the root of the word Muhammad, 'the richly praised one', is thought to establish a special link between the Prophetand the Praised One, al-mahmud, that is God. Mahmud is however also understood as one of the names of the Prophet and can be used in its feminine formMahmuda, whileMuhammad, thoughaproperpassiveparticiple, occurs in the feminine, Muhammada, only on some very early tombstones and then neveragain. In Indian Islam, however, a feminine Muhammad! occurs. From the same root hmd is derived Ahmad, Muhammad's eternal and heavenly name, by which he is mentioned in Sura 61/5 as the 'most praiseworthy' one who will complete the Divine revelation. It is this name Ahmad, which led to daring mystical speculations: in an extra Qur anic word, God describes Himself as Ahmad bila mim, 'Ahmad without the m' that is Ahad, 'One'. The root hmd belongs in general to the favourites in Arabic nomen­ clature. Besides the names just mentioned, one finds Ifamid, ‘praising*, and its intensive Hammad, 'much praising'. AlHamid, 'the Praised', belongs tothe Divine Names and'Abdul-Hamid, with itsabbreviation Hamid, is commonly used, along wih the feminine Hamida. Out of these classical forms numerous derivationsdevelop such as Hammud, Hammuda or Hammadi. Hamdi, Hamdan, Hamdun. and Hamdin. the diminutive Humayd and its enlargement Humayddn, besides Hamiddn and HamdiSi and in North Africa one finds Humaydud, Hamdid, HamdudandHammadu, tomentiononlythefrequentforms. The Prophet is mentioned as 'abduhu, 'His slave' in the two import­ ant visionary accounts of Sura 17/1 and 53/10, and therefore, 'Abduhu. Abduh has become a propername. Themysterious letters at the begin­ ning of Sura 20, Taha, and Sura 36, Yasin, are interpreted as Divine addresses to the Prophet and therefore used as names which are well- known even in the remotest areas of the Islamic world, be it in Gilgit or in the northern Deccan. Theirfirst useas propernames may go back to non-Arab countries: Yasin occurs, to my knowledge, first in Herat in the tenth century. The letters Hamim at the beginning of Suras 40 to 46 are sometimes interpreted as habibi Muhammad, 'My beloved friend Muhammad' and have therefore entered Muslim nomenclature, as have the Divine addresses at the beginning of Sura 73 and Sura 74: two Indian brothers by the names of Muzzammil, 'the wrapped one' andMuddaththir, 'thecoveredone'areMuslimtheologiansintheUSA.

Eminor, inWestAfrica, Lamina, becamefavourite names along with the feminine Amina (not to be confused with the name of the Prophet's mother, Amina) In a well-known tradition the Prophet's beauty is described by Umm Ma'shar whose barren sheep he had mysteriously milked, and the Per­ sian poet Sa'di has poetically transformed the qualities mentioned in her record in his famous line: wasimun qasimun jasimun nasim Elegant, well shaped, noble, and graceful. These epithets can be found, though not too often, as proper names: iasim forms the compound lasim ad-din (Bengal).11 In rare cases one finds Rasul. Rasul, 'Messenger', as a proper name, or even the somewhat daring combination Muhammad Rasul Allah |Deccan).“ In Bengal I encountered someone called, like the Prophet, Khayrulbashar, 'the best of mankind'. Nur al-huda, 'light of right gui­ dance' occurs also, even - most surprisingly - as a woman's name. Shockinglyenough, itwas the Malaysianwomanswimmingchampion who was called that!13 Many believershave wanted toexpress theirdevotion to the Prophet by thanking him for the gift of a son: Fadi ar-rasul 'Kindness of the Messenger' or, in the East, Rasulbakhsh 'gift of the Messenger', Ahmad-bakhsh, Nabibakhsh 'gift of Ahmad, of the Prophet'. And although the combmation of 'abd with any name but that of God is theologically objectionable, 'Abd an-nabi and 'Abd ar-rasul occur, mainly in the East. But forms like Ghulam Rasul 'servant of the Messenger', Gbulam Yasin of Yasin' or Gbulam Sarwar of the leader', are more common. UnderTurkish influence, Muhammad-quli orPayghambar-qulare not rare. In the Subcontinent thename Gbulam 'Arabi occurs, for 'Arabi, 'the Arab' is, like Makki. Madini, Hdshimi. Abfahi, a surname of the Prophet. The Arab background of Islam is particularly important for the Muslims in the Subcontinent, hence the use of combinations with these epithets. As 'love of the Prophet flows in the veins of his cftmmumty like blood’,11 as Iqbal wrote, names expressing this love can also be found, again mainly in the eastern parts of the Muslim world: Ahmad-yar or Muhammadyar, Dost-Muhammad or Muhammad-ddst-, but instead of these somewhat neutral words for 'friend' one encounters also Muhibb an-nabi 'lover of the Prophet' and 'Ashiq Muhammad, ‘infatuated with Muhammad'.
