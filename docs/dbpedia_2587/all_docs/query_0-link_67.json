        "text": "SRINAGAR: The Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Delhi has raised the monthly relief package for Kashmiri migrant families in the city from Rs 10,000 to Rs 27,000 per month, India Today reported.\n\nThe Adhoc Monthly Relief (AMR), initiated in 1989-90 to aid displaced Kashmiri families, currently benefits 2,000 families. However, due to a surge in family members, this figure is expected to rise by around 70 percent.\n\nOfficials have made Aadhaar data linkage mandatory for eligible AMR recipients, with relief payments exclusively processed through the Aadhaar-based system.\n\nThe AMR presently allocates Rs 3,250 per person per month, capped at a family of four, with the Delhi government contributing Rs 1,000 and the Union government providing Rs 2,250. The total monthly expenditure for this programme is approximately Rs 2.5 crore."
