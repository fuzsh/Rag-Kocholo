        "text": "October 23, 2015\n\nI bought this book as part of pre-release on Amazon. I am glad Sajad wrote this book and this book was published. It is pretty damning account of life in Kashmir under 'Indian occupation'as Sajid never fails to point out.\n\nI loved the book for the story it had to tell and the artwork. It is drawn as woodcarving painting style; a befitting choice since his father was an artisan who earned his living from creating beautiful wood carvings. He has drawn all characters as humanoid Hangul deer, a nod to Maus, and as he explains that it is as endangered a species as a Kashmiri.\n\nI have several years ago lamented that I wish Joe Sacco did a non-partisan comic on Kashmir. (https://twitter.com/_alps/status/1126...) It seems that is how idea was first proposed to Sajad as he writes in the book. It is hard to be non-partisan if you are a Kashmiri who grew up in tyranny of a constant army presence, and yet I would say Sajad has done his best to be non-partisan. This is perhaps first autobiographical account from a Kashmiri Sunni where he admits yes, religion has led several separatist factions to look to Pakistan and they were forced to flee. My biggest grouse with Basharat Peer's Curfewed Night'was no mention of Kashmiri exodus. However, in his aim to be non-partisan, Sajad does weave the urban legend about governor Jagmohan into the narrative. To be fair, he mentions both sides of the story. Rahul Pandita, in his 'Our Moon has blood clots' had lamented when we don't deny Kunan Phosphora, why do you deny Kashmiri exodus. And he categorically stated that despite losing his home, he doesn't support tyranny of army since 'I have lost my home, not my humanity.'Humanity is there in Sajad's story; it is not written as a Kashmiri sob story.\n\nSajad describes his growing up years in Kashmir amidst crackdowns, shut schools or schools setup in houses abandoned by Pandits with walls that are bullet-ridden. Sajad's coming of age moment is when he draws political cartoons for local newspaper at the age of 13. As expected, it does draw the ire of army who can't arrest him since he is underage. He is later invited to India Habitat Centre where during a bomb blast he is arrested from cyber cafe on mere suspicion of the citizens since he was browsing for Kashmir news and emailing his cartoon for the day to the newspaper. Sajad also weaves in history of Kashmir, invasion by several rulers/plunderers. As cartoonist, he has drawn comics against separatists who aren't united and keep calling each other 'traitor' out of their rivalry. He writes about his first loves and how they peter out since they are in Kashmir. It is a story worth reading, my heart goes out when he mentions how hard it was get his mother to hospital during a curfew. The daily fear of untoward.\n\nJust as I will Kashmiris to receive justice, I wish someday someone will also present a view of army personnel. It can't be easy to leave your home to be posted in a difficult terrain where you are reviled by all residents and shot at by militants (they exist, don't they?). I am sure there are honorable army men who do try to do the right thing against all corruption and misuse of power. Someday I hope they would also be relieved of this duty in the name of the country. May peace prevail.\n\nJuly 4, 2019\n\nMaus + Joe Sacco + Kashmir = Munnu\n\nExcellent work. Highly recommended.\n\nMaus influence:\n\nAll Kashmiri people are portrayed as hangul (Kashmiri stag) which is an endangered species. Rest of the characters are regular human beings [One can easily find RK Laxman in a couple of frames :)]\n\nJoe Sacco influence:\n\nPersonal interviews of surviving victims; references of Sacco's Palestine and The Fixer.\n\nThere are references of the author reading Palestine 20 times.\n\nThe similarities ends there. Rest is bringing up the Kashmir conflict and presenting a slice of it in the form of author's own personal life.\n\nLoved the light throw in of cultural references in the form of objects in Munnu's room - bedtime reading of Manto's story Titawal Ka Kutta, posters of rockstars, some music CDs\\DVDs etc.\n\nConceptually its not something new. But the execution was marvelous making it one of the best Indian graphic novel!\n\nJuly 4, 2016\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a story to get the message across. As a kid, I was always taught that Kashmir is a part of India and Pakistan wants to take over it. It was unanimously decided that Kashmir did want to be a part of India. Reading Munnu opened my eyes to the actual reality of the situation.\n\nMunnu is my first graphic novel and I simply loved it. The book is beautifully illustrated. I love how much detail Sajad has put into each and every sketch. Moreover, I love how we, as readers, can see the evolution of the novel. I was so curious from the beginning as to why humans depicted in the novel have faces like deer (Hangul to be precise). I grew more curious when I saw that the Indian army, foreigners etc. were depicted with normal human heads. It is only towards the end of the story that you get to read and understand the reason behind it, which somehow makes you bond a bit better with the author/cartoonist and making you feel as if you were on the journey along him.\n\nThe book revolves around the political history of Kashmir from the 90's to 2010's, and is a great way to get a glimpse into the actual lives of people from Kashmir. I really think the world needs to read this.\n\nMarch 6, 2016\n\nTo narrate the painful history of contemporary Kashmir is a challenge in and of itself, to do it through the form of a graphic novel is a feat. Sajad's graphic novel is remarkable for its everydayness and universality as well as its staggering account of growing up in Kashmir during the armed rebellion. Everything about this graphic novel is so well thought out, the use of the \"hangul\" (endangered deer) to represent Kashmiris, the way in which he narrates the political alongside the personal, and even the way he is able to critique issues/complexes within Kashmiri society, without undermining the struggle for freedom. The art form is spectacular - the depictions of particular landscapes and architecture, the way in which he deftly moves from one panel to the next, the attention to detail. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to teach about Kashmir - would be incredibly fascinating for students to engage with the multiple themes it uncovers.\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nA desi version of Art Spiegel's Maus! A hard hitting true story tempered down so it doesn't get too graphic for a graphic novel - the irony. We have often heard the Indian version of Kashmir events, the Pakistani version of Kashmir events, Malik Sajad provides the Kashmiri version of the events. History unfortunately is all about versions rather than the singularity, and Malik beautifully captures the culture, the hardships the common man faces in a war torn region always in a heightened security state. The fact he used a distinct design style similar to the wood panel work that his father did in real life, it adds a unique touch and feel to this book. I was about to say a great Indian graphic novel but that would be injustice to Malik Sajad. This is a great Kashmiri graphic novel painting their lives in their eyes and good introduction to this beautiful place that Amr Khusrao once quoted - \"if there is paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.\n\nNovember 25, 2016\n\nIts heartening to see a graphic novel by an Indian artist, and that too one which is of good quality. An autobiographical account of the author's childhood and the years growing up in Kashmir during the period of unrest and how he comes to be influenced by it to hone his craft. Told from the perspective of a Kashmiri Muslim, this book seems like the other side of the story of Our moon has blood clots which was another autobiographical account of a Kashmiri Pandit author.\n\nOne can see the inspiration that is drawn from some of the most famous graphic novels, especially those dealing with conflicts and international human rights crisis. The art style is reminiscent of The Complete Maus, using anthropomorphic animals (in this case, the Kashmiri red deer, Hangul, mice and cats in case of Maus) to portray the characters. The way the protagonist showcases his childhood with its innocence and curiosity is pretty reminiscent of The Complete Persepolis. And the way the novel is used to show the atrocities and condition of the people is something straight out of Palastine. The author even meta references that he read Palastine and gets inspired to write a similar one to highlight the Kashmir issue.\n\nIs it the most unbiased book about the issue? That would be a no. However, does it do a good job at highlighting the actual problems at the ground level? Yes, definitely.\n\nThe good part about it is that it shows the historical perspective to the conflict, which many people aren't fully aware of and which really puts things in perspective to understand the inherent complexity of the issue and the harrowing circumstances under which it was borne.\n\nThe art style is good, especially in wide angle shots and the artist excels in creating wide landscapes. However I would have liked it even better if the individual characters were drawn more clearly, highlighting their expressions as a story which is very emotional, it deserves to be portrayed well. He does use negative space well in some of the parts, and some clarity in the faces would have made it better.\n\nOctober 25, 2016\n\nWhen the story begin, I wasn't much involved and I was wondering what would be in store as this book has been highly recommended by all those who have read it. As you go further into the story, you realize that as an Indian, you know very less about Kashmir. Munnu gives an insight into the everyday lives of the civilians living a very crippled life in Kashmir. While the narrative is against India, you cannot but feel sorry for the condition of the Kashmiris living there. The author has also presented the side of Kashmiri Pandits who have suffered equally in this everyday battle that has plagued their home place. Representing the story in a graphic novel was a brilliant idea as it makes you relive what the author and others have suffered. A must read book!\n\nJune 1, 2016\n\nI want to give this book a million stars but goodreads only allows 5. This is my favourite book I have read so far this year. It should be a compulsory educational book because the world needs to know about Kashmir. I highly recommend you to read this, you won't regret it.\n\nFull review: https://mybookzoo.wordpress.com/2016/...\n\nJune 16, 2020\n\nI come across so much stuff that's pseudo, pretentious, half-assed, shallow, self-involved, unexperienced, over-intellectualised, over-stylized, wannabe want-to-be claptrap.\n\nThis, is pure. Lots of anger, lots of energy, and you might disagree with the politics, but it comes from an undeniably honest and passionate place.\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nImagine waking up to gunshots and explosions while living your life in destitute and destruction;\n\nImagine growing up in shackles of repression, voiding your happiness with bouts of depression;\n\nImagine being born a prisoner of misery where your enemies dictate your land's history;\n\nImagine being harassed by the people who swore to protect, while they kill, rape, destroy with every misstep;\n\nImagine longing eternally for freedom from pain, while the media twists your story for their own gain;\n\nImagine traveling to any place within your country, while fellow citizens look at you with malice and scrutiny;\n\nImagine being overwhelmed by the injustice, and a word aloud gets you killed by those you trusted;\n\nImagine the words being pulled out of your mouth, as the truth simmers within without a sound;\n\nImagine being born in a land that is beautiful as heaven, but thanks to politics it is further from a haven;\n\nImagine your brothers turn traitors for their own gain, while they witness their own people being slain;\n\nImagine your grand culture crumbling to dust, while ages of dictators rape your land with lust;\n\nImagine your sole existence causes people to be angered, while one by one your people become endangered;\n\nImagine you wake up everyday hoping not to die, and praying for your loved ones to still be alive;\n\nImagine you being denied the basics of rights, and they label you a terrorist when you stand and fight;\n\nNow imagine our ignorance, blind eyes and deaf ears, while our fellow brothers and sisters fight to live for a few more years!\n\nWhen will this horror, discrimination and injustice end, let's hold hands and fight together with our friends!\n\nMunnu, A boy from Kashmir is a semi auto-biographical graphic novel that focuses on the day-to-day life of the people living in Srinagar and sheds light, an own voice dictation, of the horrors that they face. I went on ahead to read more about the land and discovered that they, like the rest of the country are in the grips of the pandemic. But unlike other parts of the country, there isn't much done towards helping them. I found this fundraiser for Kashmir on Ketto. Adding it to the link my bio for those interested in lending a helping hand!\n\nI highly recommend it and request you get your copy soon and read it and educate yourselves. Learn about it from someone who's experienced it rather than the third person stories that are twisted to suit their own needs. Learning about Kashmir's history is one of the best ways we can learn the truth and stand up for them against the injustice they experience everyday.\n\nJanuary 8, 2021\n\non form: Sajad has been a political cartoonist since the age of 14 (!). maybe back in his newspaper he got paid by the volume of ink he could consume, which is why he has portrayed all Kashmiri characters (ie the bulk majority) as stags, black outlines filled-in with ink strokes, but not allowed the luxury of a solid black fill, or the clarity afforded by outlines. possibly it's deliberate, but IMHO it's very distracting. Inside the comic Sajad notes Joe Sacco as an influence, but he doesnt come close to the emotions Sacco can capture through the varied depictions of faces - nearly all of Sajad's faces are snouts of Hanguls, with their diamond eyes struggling to shoulder the entire face's burden.\n\non matter: this is clearly unique, i cant recall any work from a contemporary Kashmiri author on Kashmir (except maybe Aga Shahid's), let alone a cartoonist's; and hence (much as Sajad might hate it) a representative work - and treated thus, it's eye opening what he has to say. I was surprised at the vehemence with which Sajad has insisted that Indian forces are 'occupying' Kashmir, and barring one kind comment on the army, shown the Indian police as torturing the populace in varied ways - mass killings of young children, fake encounters, rampant corruption, prejudice against local populace, hardships on everyday life imposed by curfews etc. He asks for independence for Kashmir, or atleast asking the people about it in a fair fashion, but glosses over the difficult politics around a sensitive matter such as this. 'Indians' are reduced to being invaders from a different country (India), and Pakistan is only mentioned in the context of the 1948 war where 'local tribesmen' ventured into Kashmir and reached what's now the LoC.\n\nMaintaining some distance and commenting on what various local and international players think or have thought about an issue as complex as Kashmir is hard, but Sajad doesn't profess to tackle that - he offers his own story: the story of a politically motivated teenager who works for the region's most prestigious newspaper but takes his ailing mother to the hospital on his bike, is lovestruck by a visiting Western filmmaker, and dreams that his favourite brother is dead. In doing so, he comments on how the buildings are full of bloodstains and bullet holes, and how he's accused of being a terrorist when bomb blasts rock India's capital when he's once visiting it.\n\nTl;dr - read about one guy's life in Kashmir.\n\nFebruary 12, 2016\n\nRead a graphic novel after real long time. Wonderfully illustrated book with Kashmiris represented as Hangul deer ( wild red deer ) - Gives a true portrait of life in Kashmir from the 90s onwards against the backdrop of militancy, the Pandit exodus, military occupancy. ( Inspired by Maus by Art Speigelman ). Highly recommended read\n\nOctober 13, 2016\n\nEmbrace the inevitable process of aging, but ditch the process of growing up. You might manage a happy ending without having to become a hero or a spiteful monster.\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\n4,5\n\nI'm not that into graphic novels, this is only the second one I read, but I have to say that they can hit you as much as a book does.\n\nI already knew about the occupation of Kashmir, but I didn't know that it was lasting since such a long time and I didn't know that Indian soldiers could commit such terrible tortures, rapes and killings.\n\nUnfortunately, the Kashmiri situation is not that known in the world, so I would recommend everyone to read this graphic novel. It is not well known also because the Indian government has control over the Kashmiri telecommunications and it happens often that they just cut down internet or any communication with the outer world.\n\nThe drawings, despite being black and white, and all the Kashmiri are portrait the same way (as hanguls, red deers that are endangered in Kashmir), are powerful too and they are able to transmit emotions.\n\nFebruary 9, 2021\n\nThis book made me realize how little I understand the problem of Kashmir. Munnu is a beautifully illustrated autobiographical novel, where the author takes us on his life's journey putting together the politics and his personal account depicting the disruptions in daily life of the Kashmiris. It gives a picture of growing up in Kashmir amidst conflict and curfews, under constant military occupation.\n\nAs an Indian reader, the account certainly feels lopsided with the Indian army clearly being the villain. But I cannot blame the author here; with continuous crackdowns, encounters and struggles for basic services like education and medical facilities due to curfews, living in constant fear, they are vulnerable and terrified lot. The militants or so called revolutionaries further manipulate the psyche with their propaganda for ulterior political motives with hardly any concern for the needs of locals. An honest kashmiri is sandwiched between the army and the militants, and is under scrutiny from both.\n\nBesides the politics & hardships, the book also showcases the warmth of a tightly knit Kashmiri family, snippets of its culture and history, the beautiful wooden houses, art and love. Representing the Kashmiri's as an endangered species 'Hangul' is very clever indeed.\n\nI would definitely applaud the effort put in by the author for putting his side of the story out in the world.\n\nApril 27, 2022\n\n\"Some thinkers say that history is a fiction or that the fate of every living or non-living thing was set in stone millions or billions of years ago by The Almighty. Whatever the truth, God and the historians were certainly cruel for not adding a few pages of happy ending to Kashmir's story.\"\n\nOctober 31, 2019\n\nHow much does an outsider really know about the Hangul, the endangered species whose natural habitat is wrecked by the army and deforestation?\n\nMunnu: A Boy From Kashmir is a heart-wrenching story from the blood-stained pages of Kashmir under occupation, of lives lived and lost in a habitat similarly wrecked by the fault lines of nationhood — which is sadly all but its own. Malik Sajad draws from his own experiences of growing up amidst conflict, convolution and curfew in the valley to sketch a story that is part bildungsroman blossoming from the age of 7, part recollection of Kashmir's rich cultural history and origin myths, and also a terrifying description of daily life in the valley amidst the warzone ignited from the 1990s. With a style influenced (with due credit within) by Art Spiegelman's Maus and Joe Sacco's Palestine, this book focuses on the struggles in India-occupied-Kashmir and the desire for self-determination and a restoration of normalcy.\n\nBeautifully illustrated and impactfully narrated, Munnu is the first graphic novel (a medium of choice for talking about conflict zones in recent literary history) to spring from Kashmir. It is a voice of the interminable personal resistance of the author in his journey to becoming an artist and cartoonist — one can spot homage to the Indian cartoonist R K Laxman in some frames! — while grounded in the passionate fight of a people to make their cause known to the world.\n\nIt is incredibly haunting to read about the anger against the non-involvement of Kashmir in the deliberations, wars and decisions about its future against the backdrop of India's abrogation of Article 370 recently. On the 88th day of Indian blackout politics in Kashmir, Sajad's descriptions of the curfews, 'identification parades', staged encounters and other terrible acts of the Indian Army resound with painful, violent urgency for the voices of Kashmiris to be heard. Munnu also talks about corrupt cracks in the resistance movement, the ambivalence of the international community, and the role of the press in Kashmir. The pathos of a people colonised over and over, deprived of their own language — Kashmiris at prohibited from using te Kashmiri tongue in schools — and will haunts every panel on every page.\n\nIndeed, Munnu: A Boy From Kashmir provides one with the lived experiences and perspectives of those directly affected by the political violence in Kashmir. It is an incredibly important book deserving of the widespread attention and aid that Kashmiris have so long been deprived of.\n\nAugust 26, 2019\n\n3.5/5 The story of Munnu (the author) told in the style of iconic graphic novel “Maus” using Hanguls (endangered Kashmiri deer) to depict Kashmiris. Another inspiration mentioned by the author is Joe Sacco but his artwork was many notches above the author’s. Infact stumbled upon Sacco’s Palestine today in the library and his drawings are so sharp ! I could hardly differentiate between the Kashmiri characters.\n\nAs an autobiography, it brings out the daily trauma of living in the presence of the Indian army. One really feels for children like Munnu who have their education disrupted again and again. Indian police is known for behaving inhumanly and according to the book, the army too was not much better. But wonder if the author put the cart before the horse ? The army were there because of the militancy and not the other way round. The militants are also to be blamed for overshadowing the childhoods with violence and brutality ?\n\nAlso, think the effect of the theocratic nature of the “freedom movement” on daily lives was described only in passing. What is life without arts and cinema ? Or how is society with such repression of women and minorities ?\n\nArticles 370/35A were aborgated recently and there was again a lot of talk about winning Kashmiri hearts. This book talks a lot about listening to grievances. Maybe for once Kashmiris need to apply this and listen to the rest of India.\n\nJuly 18, 2020\n\nMunnu: A boy from Kashmir- is based on the life of the author, Sajad (aka Munnu), and is a coming of age story of a man in one of the most disputed regions in the world- Kashmir.\n\nThe story revolves around Munnu- an inquisitive and artistic kid, who has a flair for drawing. What started as a nascent interest in calligraphy and etching designs on wood-pieces for Munnu, transforms into professional competency for which Munnu receives widespread acclaim in sketching and drawing, which is crucial in shaping his life and lifestory. His entire journey has been mapped with the struggle for liberation of Kashmir and oppression of Kashmiris by the Indian armed forces in the background.\n\nThe author, in this book (which derives inspiration from the all time classic Maus by Art Spiegleman), describes the continual atrocities faced by Kashmiris in the India Occupied Kashmir. Through his own life story, he addresses the day-to-day problems as well as age long continuing carnage faced by apolitical civilians of the valley, who just want peace. One of my favorite illustrations was the 'Footnotes' Section which covers in brief the history of pre-90s era Kashmir. The artwork in this section, as well as the entire book, is a masterclass and the author's attention to detail is second to none\n\nMy inspiration to read this book was to know more about the history of Kashmir and gain perspective of the natives on this much troubled issue. This graphic novel is a jigsaw-puzzle piece of the former (only to be complemented by other accounts of Kashmir), but it most certainly one of the best pieces for the latter. The simple writing and beautiful illustrations made the book so powerful and gripping that I finished it in one sitting. The ending too, is very strong and is reflective of the the quandary that is Kashmir.\n\nVerdict- 5/5\n\nIt is one of the best graphic novels I have ever read and would recommend it to everyone!\n\nOctober 26, 2020\n\n\"The world's progress only meant new innovations in the techniques of torture and documentation. Only a prisoner can console his fellow prisoner to keep up his hopes for victory. After all, how can one expect justice from the gallows of injustice?\"\n\nRATING: 4.5/5\n\nIn Art Spiegelman's Maus, Jews are depicted as mice (using and overturning a popular racial caricature of that time). Germans appear as cats, & Poles as pigs. This postmodern anthropomorphic technique gives him space to explore the subject of the Holocaust in a rich artistic medium in a wholly new way. Moreover, the text-heavy panels drawn in black-and-white help in strengthening the narrative. While there are obvious issues with Spiegelman's work, chiefly reinforcing the stereotypes it sought to break, it remains important and has brought critical attention to the graphic novel as a genre. Malik Sajad takes a page out of his notebook and uses similar ideas in his book. The Hangul or the Red Stag Deer, the national animal of Kashmir, is very endangered because its habitat has been wrecked by the army as well as deforestation. Humanoid Hangul without many differentiating characteristics stand-in for Kashmiri people, everyone else is drawn human.\n\nSajad was suggested to emulate the work of Joe Sacco, another famous writer who uses graphic novelist as a journalistic medium, in a book about Kashmir. For the most part, this book strives to be non-partisan. But then how long can neutrality be maintained when you grow up and live in such a turbulent setting? Inspired by his own life, Sajad tells the story of an entire people living under occupation, a constant siege, through the eyes of a boy and his family. He gives us bite-sized portions of history, little nuggets that fire your curiosity and lead to a yearning to know more. The depiction of quotidian life easily transports the reader within the pages of the book, right beside Munnu who takes you on the journey.\n\nBy making Kashmiris inhuman, he strangely reinforces their inherent humanity and accentuates their rich cultural heritage and traditions. He shows the Indian presence like it is, but he also doesn't shy away from depicting the Separatists and how they are plagued by rifts and factionalism. He focuses on the forced exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits as well, talking of the myriad effects of their continued absence in the valley. He is adept at highlighting the personal and the political, how they easily intersect in Kashmir where upheavals are commonplace, yet the people have not resigned themselves to their fate and continue to rebel against it in their own ways. I highly recommend this to everyone.\n\nAfter the events of last year, the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, Kashmir will never be the same. Even after 73 years of independence, the Kashmiri people have no say in how they live, how they are governed. The stipulations of Kashmir joining the Union have been left on the wayside, never mind the under-handed way it joined the country in the first place. All of us must be very vocal about Kashmiris having the fundamental right to self-determination. Only they have the sole right to decide how they exist.\n\nMay 29, 2018\n\n4.5 STARS!!\n\nI really enjoy reading memoirs that are written as graphic novels. That added visual feature is such a great way to develop an instant picture of the time, place and feel being described, the details and character expressions conveying more than words sometimes do.\n\nMunnu is the third and probably last book I will be reading on the Kashmir issue, at least this year. But it marks a perfect conclusion to my attempt at trying to understand the human side of the Kashmir situation more deeply.\n\nThe book is a semi-autographical coming-of-age story of a young boy growing up in Kashmir through the peak of the armed conflict. What I found very interesting was that the author depicts all Kashmiris as the Hangul Deer, or the Kashmir Red Stag, which is now an endangered species, due to the destruction of most of their habitat and poaching, and everyone else is shown as human. It is a clever metaphor and the symbolism couldn't have been more apt.\n\nThe chapters covering Munnu's younger years were the most enjoyable, which is nearly half the book, with some really sweet laugh out loud moments interspersed in the tense lives of the artisan family.\n\nMy favourite is one is a hilariously innocent conversation between Munnu and his older classmate after they see two dogs mating.\n\nBut there is no shying away from death, loss and tragedy and how it affected the psyche of parents or gave young children episodes of PTSD. As Munnu grows up and becomes an adult, innocence is lost and \"life\" takes over, which is essentially a day to day struggle to remain out of trouble while navigating through numerous check posts and curfews. And that is where the story loses its charm... and why I couldn't rate it a full 5.\n\nA must read for sure.\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nThere are two people mentioned in this caption: Munna, a boy from Kashmir and the reader, a girl from India.\n\nMunnu's daily life is filled with uncertainty, his safety is always a thing of question; while the reader's daily life is uneventful, but filled with the unquestionable certainty that she is safe.\n\nMunnu's education is hindered from time to time; while the reader completed her education without any problems.\n\nMunnu had been witness to strife, clashes, murders, crackdowns from a young age; while the reader had led a comparatively sheltered life.\n\nMunnu grew up in fear of the army; while the reader grew up looking at the army as her and her people's saviours.\n\nMunnu lived in a state that wanted total freedom from the country that controlled it; while the reader grew up with the belief that all the states of India were in total harmony with each other.\n\nMunnu grew up with a national identity crisis; while the reader was secure about her national identity and never had to question it, ever.\n\nMunnu grew up looking at India as its opressor; while the reader was taught that the whole of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, lived under the motto Unity in Diversity.\n\nMunnu and the reader were born in different states of the same country but one saw the other as a fellow countryman while the other saw them as a citizen of their oppressing country.\n\nThis fracture between the thoughts, lives, experiences of two people supposedly hailing from the same country that was so clearly outlined in the book almost feels like a whiplash in literary form.\n\nThis book will make you want to question everything that you've ever been taught, check your biases and privileges and will make you hope for a better outcome for the Kashmiris, regardless of whether they see you as a fellow countryman or not.\n\nThe illustrations in this book were reminiscent of Maus, in that it followed the same theme of representing the oppressed people, in this case the Kashmiris, in animal form- a Hangul deer which is an endangered species indigenous to Kashmir.\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nAbsolutely gut wrenching. The simple prose, detailed art, and bone chilling stories of Kashmir create a fascinatingly blistering picture of India occupied Kashmir. This autobiographical series of mini comics tell the tale of Sajad, a young boy growing up in post Partition Kashmir and his journey to becoming a political cartoonist. This book does not shy away from the truth and portrays the traumatic incidents from his childhood from sexual abuse by the Indian army to the harsh realities of his curfew ridden adolescence. Sajad has a uniquely sincere yet biting voice in his commentary, providing a new and deeper perspective to the chaos of the conflict over Kashmir. This book plainly illustrates what the mass media often shies away from portraying, the blatant horror and war crimes committed by the Indian army. Every Indian, nay every Human Being, should read this book to understand the extent of the travesties taking place in Kashmir and question their own role in abetting these violations of human right, I know that I am doing that now.\n\nSeptember 17, 2021\n\nWhat a book.\n\nIt is easily one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. There were moments in the book when I was biting my fingernails in the anticipation of something terrible, only to find out that my worst imagination was not even close to what Munnu lived through - the cruelty that was inflicted upon him by the fascist regime.\n\nBut it is true. People are more complicated than the roles they are assigned in stories. And I cannot possibly comment on how the fascist regime - clearly and frustratingly suffering from a mental disorder - mangled an entire heavenly state in the name of faith.\n\nWhat I can, however, marvel at is Munnu's capacity to self-teach, work hard, and learn and unlearn him upbringing to accomplish an illustrious life after no positive environment whatsoever. It is not only inspirational, it is miraculous.\n\nAugust 15, 2020\n\nVery evocative of Maus and Palestine, although I wish the author had added more commentary on the history of Kashmir.\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\n“Some thinkers say that History is fiction, or that the fate of every living or non-living thing was set in stone millions or billions of years ago by the Almighty, whatever the truth, God and the Historians were certainly cruel for not adding a few pages of Happy ending to Kashmir’s story.”\n\nMost of us are just given a unilateral perspective on the situation in Kashmir. By Media, by our leaders, teachers, and even our parents, we are told that Kashmir is ours and Pakistan is trying to capture it. We are told that everyone who tries to rebel for an independent Kashmir was a terrorist. It is often very difficult to unlearn things that have been implanted in our brains like words on stone but going into this, I tried to keep an open mind.\n\nThe book is about a boy, growing up in Kashmir. But growing up in Kashmir meant growing up with the constant fear and trauma of losing a loved one. The land of Kashmir is often said to be heaven on Earth but obviously, for Munnu and a lot of other kids like him, growing up amongst violence and cruelty, it was no heaven.\n\nI am only a teenager and am still trying to formulate my own views and judgment about the world. I don’t know a lot of things but if there is one thing this book convinced me of, it’s that humans are not the smartest creatures in the world. In fact, they are the most flawed and materialistic of all.\n\nIt is impossible to pass an objective judgment on the situation in Kashmir without doing injustice to one or the other group. The way I see it is everyone was a convict and everyone was a victim. It was good to get an untold perspective but in the end, Munnu was an individualistic perspective that is bound to be coloured in its own biases. In this sense, the individuality of Munnu or Sajad Malik obviously led to the loss of individuality of others like the Indian Army.\n\n“A survivor could only bury his guilt by calling those who were not so lucky ‘Martyrs’! Numbness buried a lot of pain.”\n\nThere are multiple perspectives that could be employed while analysing this work but I think taking a humanistic perspective is a more holistic way to go about it. This is one of the saddest books I have ever read because it is a reminder of how, in pursuit of materialism, we fail each other as human beings miserably and subject each other to unimaginable pain and suffering. After this, I cannot but scoff at all the people taking pride in saying things like “Kashmir hamara h” and “Kashmir India ka taj h.” But then again, hubris is the most common failing in most of the tragedies in history, fictional or otherwise. And I am more convinced than ever that if humans were to go extinct, it would not be by means of natural destruction but by killing each other. But that would be poetic justice, wouldn’t it?\n\nMarch 24, 2020\n\nI should have thought twice before giving this one 5 stars. It does make you love the protagonist, after all; he will probably garner more wrath than appreciation from the typical Indian TV Audience.\n\nThe art in the graphic novel is spell-binding. The detail needs a thick lens to appreciate fully. The content needs wide arms to accept; I did, and it was warm.\n\nRead the book for a look at how it feels from the point of view of a little child in a strife ridden Kashmir. Read the book to understand the nightmare that such a society thrusts on people - a society that allows no expression and no room for movement in its social or economic fabric. It's harrowing and depressing. But at the same time, there are sparks of brightness in the form of innocence that pierces through the grimness that is curfews.\n\nThe part with the complicated history and the navigation through the mess of adolescence and adulthood with a new job is intricately illustrated by Sajad. I thought I knew his backyard and understood his angst through each of his panels.\n\nRead the book. Look at it. Look at the Hangul's eyes in the panels. They have lines of hope, anger, passion, confusion and a strange indifference about the chaos that surrounds them. The Kashmir story is not black and white, but this black and white grey chronicle is quite something. It's beautiful.\n\nMarch 4, 2019\n\nFor fans of Joe Sacco, Art Spiegelman and Marjane Satrapi 'Munnu' joins a prestigious collection of non-fiction comic strips revealing the hidden truths surrounding conflict ridden areas.\n\nBefore this book, Kashmir was a place I knew nothing about; historically or culturally. I feel Malik's tale (based on his own childhood experiences and achievements) has helped unveil a part of the world I was truly ignorant about.\n\nThe absolutely heart rending monstrosities the Kashmiri people have had to endure for hundreds of years is truly barbaric. Stripped of their independence and sold from one country to another like an unwanted second home, they have had their identity suppressed and their desire for independence ignored by the entirety of the world stage. Malik paints a picture of a childhood so alien to my own I can barely comprehend it. To be accustomed to death and destruction at every turn, to beg for ones life, the right to exist on a daily basis, it is not something I have ever had to encounter and would wish on no-one. However, amongst all the turmoil there is light. Munnu's family are his beacon, his people and his country's future his driving force as a childhood love of art turns into a political tool used to express his distress at what Kashmir and its citizens have become. Forcing the ugly truth of the situation upon the world becomes his bread and butter.\n\nThis is truly a masterpiece.\n\nMay 5, 2018\n\n\"Embrace the inevitable process of aging, but ditch the process of growing up. You might manage a happy ending without having to become a hero or a spiteful monster.\"\n\nA must read for every Indian. Like most, I wasn't aware of the history of Kashmir and this haunting coming-of-age story of a Kashmiri boy does well to teach me the same. Inspired by Joe Sacco and Art Spiegelman's works, this graphic novel also acts a non-fiction portrayal of some heinous atrocities committed in a geographical location. The disruptive effects of years of armed struggles between Indian army and militants on the daily life of civilians is heart wrenching.\n\n\"Forget history, it only rationalises the punishment you have been sentenced to.\"\n\nSometimes, it is unfair to expect the people who are experiencing the worst of humanity to step outside their frame of reference and present an equitable picture. The onus is on the readers to find more stories and perspectives to add to it.\n\nSo while I might not agree completely with the political views expressed by the author, I can't deny that it has been a great read and along with other books on the Kashmir issue like 'Our Moon has blood clots' by Rahul Pandita and to some extent 'Curfewed Night' by Bashrat Peer, this book forms the beginner's guide to understanding the whole Kashmir issue."
