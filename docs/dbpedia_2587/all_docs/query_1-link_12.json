        "text": "Update: Last week, I stepped aside as the CEO of GreyOrange. After founding and leading GreyOrange for 12 years and running Team AcYut for 4 years before that, I have decided to take a break! A lot of you have asked me what I intend to do next, so I thought I would post it here to both share and take suggestions on how I can improve the list. I envision this sabbatical around 4 themes : Health, Learning, Bucket list, and Giving back Health: Although I started focusing on health a couple of years ago, the main theme is to take time to recharge my physical, mental and spiritual self. Learning: For people that know me, this is a big one and the focus here is to meet and learn from outside supply chain and robotics. I have a couple of Finance courses lined up on coursera; need suggestions on AI. I would love to also help people think through problems/ideas, Product development and GTM so I can learn. I also plan on watching the entire Mahabharata Series ( 290 episodes) since I am tired of being quoted the Mahabharata and now I need to know :). Bucket list: I have 4-5 crazy things to knock off my bucket list - taking a super long train journey, working as front-line staff at McD ( will replace this with Doordash or Lyft ), 10 Day Vipassana etc. Giving Back: In addition to the above personal pursuits, I would like to give back to the community while learning and exploring new things before embarking on my next adventure. Over the last 5-6 years, as GreyOrange became bigger and bigger, life got busier and busier. I significantly decreased my speaking engagements at events and colleges to share our learnings and I want to give time to this. I recently taught a short course on product management and thoroughly enjoyed it, and intend to teach more courses. I will also increase the amount of time I have been spending on advising startups. I get so much energy doing this, so I plan to do more of this before life gets busy again :). Please let me know if you have any other suggestions for ways to give back. I am convinced that GreyOrange would not have gotten this far without the countless people who assisted and taught me along the way, and I intend to contribute further in similar ways. Lastly, I want to spend time with family and friends, as it is something that took a bit of a backseat over the last few years, given the demands of the job. I look forward to doing 'purpose-less coffee' catch ups. Current plan is to be in the following cities over the next couple of months, so do DM or comment if you are in town and would love to meet : SF, Seattle, Boston, Delhi, Bangalore and of course NY (home). #sabbatical #health #learning #giveback #bucketlist #startup #bitspilani"
