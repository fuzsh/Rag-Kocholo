        "text": "Æthelmearc, Kingdom of. Acceptance of transfer of heraldic title Seedling Pursuivant from the Kingdom of the East.\n\nArabella MacGrath. Device. Quarterly azure and Or, two fleurs-de-lys azure.\n\nNice device!\n\nBastiano di Iacopo. Name and device. Vert, a wine amphora and a chief rayonny Or.\n\nCellach mac Toimín. Name and device. Gules, a crossbow argent within an orle of pheons Or.\n\nDeryk Archer. Name and device. Per pale sable and Or, a goblet between three pheons counterchanged.\n\nEleanor Elizabeth Burgar. Device. Per bend azure and gules, on a bend cotised Or four wagon wheels proper.\n\nFranz Belgraunde die Mus. Name change from Franz Belgrand die Mus.\n\nThe byname Belgraunde is grandfathered to the submitter as it is the registered byname of his father, whose SCA name is Francois Belgraunde (registered in December 1995).\n\nHis previous name, Franz Belgrand die Mus, is released.\n\nGareth Craig. Name and device. Argent, a badger rampant sable between three standing balances vert.\n\nThe submitter requested authenticity for 16th C Scotland/Wales. Lacking evidence that the name Gareth was used in Scotland or Wales in period, we were unable to make this name authentic for the submitter's desired culture.\n\nThe badger was originally blazoned as sable marked argent, but it is predominantly sable with only a few small argent details. We generally do not blazon a charge as \"marked\" when the marking details are so small. In addition, we might mistakenly give the impression that large portions of the badger (such as its underside) are argent, which might lead to emblazons that have inadequate contrast with the argent field.\n\nGünther Schwarzrose. Device. Gules, on a pale engrailed argent a rose sable.\n\nNice device, with a nice cant on the surname!\n\nGwilym ap Dafydd. Name and device. Per pale argent and vert, three suns counterchanged within a bordure sable mulletty argent.\n\nJohann Schülein. Name and device. Gules, on a bend bretessed argent three triangles sable.\n\nThe triangles were originally blazoned as palewise inverted. However, most members of the College perceived these as being in the default bendwise posture for charges on a bend. Such bendwise triangles would have one point aligned with the bend and pointing towards dexter chief, which is very visually similar to the design with the triangles palewise inverted. We have therefore blazoned the device to match the way that most viewers perceive the armory.\n\nJohann Wulfeken. Name and device. Argent, on a chevron gules between three wolf's heads erased sable three chess rooks argent.\n\nSubmitted as Johann Wülfken, the submitter requested authenticity for German. Bahlow (s.n. Wulf(f)) dates Sivert Wulfeken to 1267. We have changed the byname to this form in order to meet the submitter's request for authenticity.\n\nKaterina McGilledoroughe. Device. Vert, a panther sejant head to dexter argent spotted sable within a bordure argent.\n\nTable 3 of the Glossary of Terms indicates that the panther (which is to say, the default \"English-style\" heraldic panther) is guardant by default. As a result we must explicitly state that this panther has its head to dexter. Note that the Continental panther does not have an SCA default posture.\n\nPlease note that the discussions of the panther's default posture in the Pictorial Dictionary in the SCA have been superceded by the listing in the Glossary, which has been available for some years.\n\nLochlainn mac Faoláin Bháin. Name and device. Per pale azure and argent, a chevron between three wolf's heads erased counterchanged.\n\nSubmitted as Lochlainn mac Faoláin Bhain, Gaelic names are registerable with accents either used or omitted consistently. As there was an accent in the element Faoláin, we have added the missing accent to final element of this name.\n\nThere was some discussion about whether the element Bháin should include lenition, or whether it should not include lenition and take the form Báin. The \"Annals of the Four Masters\", vol. 4, (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100005D/), entry M1453.6, lists an example of the byname Bán 'white' used as a descriptive byname for a man's father: Eoghan mac Domhnaill Bháin Ui Raighilligh. As this example has the descriptive byname lenited, we have registered it in the lenitied form Bháin.\n\nLorenz Butterman. Device. Per saltire indented sable and erminois.\n\nRhydderich Hael, Barony of the. Order name Order of the Golden Bee (see RETURNS for badge).\n\nRioghnach ny Rise. Name and device. Argent, two domestic cats sejant addorsed tails entwined sable between in pale two roses proper.\n\nSubmitted as Rioghnach ni Rose, the submitter requested authenticity for \"Irish/English\" and allowed minor changes. In period, a Gaelic woman's name would have been written entirely in Gaelic or entirely in Anglicized Irish depending upon the language of the record in which her name was recorded.\n\nThe byname ni Rose was submitted as an Anglicized Irish form of the byname inghean Roiss, where Roiss was intended to be a genitive form of the Gaelic masculine name Rosa. However, Roiss is not a genitive form of Rosa. Instead, the genitive form of Rosa in late period is simply Rosa. The \"Annals of the Four Masters\", vol. 5, (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100005E/) shows an example of this genitive in entry M1518.2, which lists Aedh mac Rosa mic Tomais Óicc Még Uidhir in the year 1518.\n\nFor the most part, period Anglicized Irish forms of names use English spelling conventions of the time to represent the sound of Gaelic names. The difficult part of constructing period Anglicized Irish forms of names is determining how the English or Anglicized Irish spelling conventions of that time would have rendered the sound of a name. In this case, there is an example of -rosa in a byname. Woulfe (p. 513 s.n. Ó Dubhrosa) dates the Anglicized Irish form O Dubrise to temp. Elizabeth I-James I. This example supports Rise as a period Anglicized Irish form of the Gaelic Rosa.\n\nRegarding the use of ni in Anglicized Irish, there are some gray-area documents that show examples of this type of construction. John O'Donovan, ed., Annals of Ireland, by the Four Masters, vol. 6, p. 2446, lists a transcription of the will of Daniell O'Donovane dated to 1629. This document mentions Juane Ny Teige O'Donovane, the daughter of my sonne Teige O'Donovane. The same page lists a transcription of the will of Teige O'Donovane dated to 1639. In this document, Teige lists his daughters: Joane ny Teige, Ellen ny Teige, Eilene ny Teige, Shilie ny Teige, and Honora ny Teige. These examples support Ny [Anglicized Irish form of father's given name] and ny [Anglicized Irish form of father's given name] as byname forms for women in Anglicized Irish. Therefore, Ny Rise and ny Rise are plausible period Anglicized Irish forms of the submitted byname. As the latter is the closer of these to the submitted byname, we have used that form in registering this name in order to partially meet the submitter's request for authenticity.\n\nA fully Gaelic form of this name would be Rioghnach inghean Rosa. As the submitter only allowed minor changes, we were unable to change this name to a fully Gaelic form in order to meet the submitter's request for authenticity.\n\nRobert of Worcester. Name and device. Purpure, a bend argent between two crosses couped Or within a bordure argent.\n\nGood name!\n\nRose Thorne. Device. Gules, a rabbit sejant contourny regardant and a chief dovetailed argent.\n\nThomas von Hessen. Name and device. Or, issuant from a chevron inverted gules a demi-bull azure.\n\nMost demi-quadrupeds (including winged demi-quadrupeds, such as demi-griffins) are erect in period armory. Erect appears to be the default posture for such charges in the real world. Therefore, erect should be the default posture for demi-quadrupeds in the SCA.\n\nWolfgang Güntherssohn. Name and device. Per pale gules and sable, three wolves' teeth issuant from sinister Or.\n\nSubmitted as Wolfgang Günthersohn, the byname Günthersohn was submitted as a constructed byname. Brechenmacher lists a number of examples of this type of name, including: (s.n. Sohn) Henrich Adrians Sohn dated to 1580, (s.n. Jakobsen) Drewes, Jacoppes son zu Lübeck dated to 1335, (s.n. Friedrich) Chuonnrat Friderichs sun zu Hottingen dated to 1313, and (s.n. Wilhelmsen) Jakob Wilhelmes sohne dated to 1526. These examples demonstrate that this construction existed in period. They also show that the expected form would have an s added to the end of the father's name, forming a patronymic such as Günthers sohn. Brechenmacher (s.n. Wolterssohn) also shows an example of the sohn 'son' element appended to the end of the patronym: Jasper Wolterszoen 1573. This example supports a construction such as Güntherssohn. We have changed the submitted byname to this form in order to follow period examples in order to register this name.\n\nAné{zv}ka z Ro{zv}mitála. Badge. (Fieldless) A fret couped argent.\n\nShe has a letter of permission to conflict with Meredudd Brangwyn, Per saltire gules and pean, a fret argent.\n\nCelestria Monelyght le Dragon. Device. Argent, a dragon passant contourny gules and on a chief embattled vert a mullet between an increscent and a decrescent argent.\n\nChandranath Mitra. Badge. (Fieldless) An escutcheon Or.\n\nOne commenter asked whether we should protect the \"naval signal flag for the letter Q: Or\", and, if so, whether this badge conflicts with it. That commenter also suggested that all the signal flags deserve protection.\n\nAs an administrative note, we expect that the members of the College should provide documentation with any requests for the SCA to protect particular pieces of real-world armory. Unfortunately, this letter of comment does not provide any documentation in support of this request for protection, either for the specific signal flag for Q or for signal flags in general.\n\nWe did some research and found that Whitney Smith's Flags describes the International Signal Flags and Pennants on p. 86, and shows a square Or flag representing the letter Q. However, it is important to note that the contents of the signal flag listing implies strongly that the shape of the signal flags is significant, not just the armory on the flags. The signal flags have a number of different shapes. Some flags which have different shapes, but which otherwise \"bear the same armorial display\", have different meanings: both the flags for the letter T and the number 3 bear the same \"armory\" (Per pale gules and azure, a pale argent), but they differ in shape (the letter T flag is square, and the number 3 flag is a long pennant with the tip couped flat.) None of the flags are shaped like escutcheons, which is the shape of this fieldless badge.\n\nThe identity of armory does not depend on the shape on which the armory is displayed. A period coat of arms or badge may be displayed on many different shapes (or, in the case of a fieldless badge, on no underlying shape at all) without losing its identifiability. Signal flags do not have this characteristic. We thus agree with Laurel's initial reaction that \"signal flags are not armory.\"\n\nSignal flags do not appear to fall into any of the categories of real-world insignia protected in the Administrative Handbook. They are not Armory of Significant Geographical Locations Outside the Society, Significant Personal and Corporate Armory from Outside the Society, or Copyrighted Images, Trademarks, Military Insignia, etc. They therefore do not requre protection in the SCA Armorial and Ordinary under the current provisions of the Administrative Handbook.\n\nIn addition, Laurel Clerk has done research showing that the current \"International\" signal flags are neither an ancient nor a universal system of vexillogical communications. At this time, the definitions of signal flags do not fully agree between the \"International\" signal flags, the NATO signal flags, and the U.S. Navy's signal flags. The meanings of the signal flags have changed significantly even in the past 50 years. The flag for the letter \"J\", in 1951, also meant \"I am going to send a message by semaphore\". In 1969 it meant \"I am on fire and have dangerous cargo on board; keep well clear of me.\" There is thus no compelling reason to believe that the current signal flags have some special status as insignia that should cause us to consider adding them to the currently existing categories of protected items.\n\nDarius of the Bells. Badge. (Fieldless) A mullet of four points within and conjoined to an annulet Or.\n\nHe has a letter of permission to conflict with the household badge of Walter de Witte, Sable, a compass rose Or.\n\nDesirata Dupré of Dragonsfire Tor. Name and device. Purpure, three escarbuncles Or.\n\nSubmitted as Désirée Dupré of Dragonsfire Tor, no documentation was presented and none was found that Désirée was used in period. As the submitter allows any changes, we have changed this name to the form Desirata (which Withycombe, p. 83 s.n. Désirée, dates to 1210-12, 1302, and 1316) in order to register this name.\n\nSimon Piroska. Device. Per bend sinister sable and gules, a pawprint bendwise sinister argent.\n\nTimothy of Glastinbury. Badge. (Fieldless) A billet argent.\n\nThis does not conflict with the badge of Rowena of Jorvik, (Fieldless) A delf argent pierced two and two. There is one CD for fieldlessness and another for the sizeable piercing. As noted in the LoAR of December 1999, \"After much thought, we decided that piercing is worth a CD when drawn large enough to be equivalent to adding a tertiary charge, as it is done here; i.e. when it is clearly visible and takes up much of the space available to it.\"\n\nAldred Bertand. Name and device. Vert, on a bend between a goutte and a Latin cross bottony argent three roses gules.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Flower of the Desert.\n\nSubmitted as Order of the Desert Flower, no documentation was submitted and none was found that a toponymic would have been used as an adjective in an order name in period. Lacking such evidence, this name was not registerable as submitted.\n\nMeradudd Cethin's article \"Project Ordensnamen OR What do you mean that the Anceint[sic] and Venerable Order of the Most Holy and Righteous Wombat's Toenail isn't period?\" (http://www.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/names/order/) dates the order name Star of the Noble House to 1351. This shows one example of a period order name constructed as [Item] of [Generic toponymic]. There are many period order names constructed as [Item] of [Placename] and many generic toponymics used in order names (most famously Temple and Hospital). Therefore, order names in the pattern [Item] of [Generic toponymic] are registerable, assuming that the item and generic toponymic are appropriate. Therefore, as the submitters allow any changes, we have changed this order name to Order of the Flower of the Desert in order to register this name.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Pilgrim of the Desert.\n\nSubmitted as Order of the Desert Pilgrim, no documentation was submitted and none was found that a toponymic would have been used as an adjective in an order name in period. Lacking such evidence, this name was not registerable as submitted.\n\nAs the submitters allow any changes, we have changed this order name to Order of the Pilgrim of the Desert in order to register this name.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Scarab and badge. Or, a scarab beetle vert and a bordure indented azure.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Star of the Desert and badge. Per fess indented azure and argent, in chief four mullets of four points elongated palewise Or and in base a sun in splendor azure.\n\nSubmitted as Order of the Desert Star, no documentation was submitted and none was found that a toponymic would have been used as an adjective in an order name in period. Lacking such evidence, this name was not registerable as submitted.\n\nMeradudd Cethin's article \"Project Ordensnamen OR What do you mean that the Anceint[sic] and Venerable Order of the Most Holy and Righteous Wombat's Toenail isn't period?\" (http://www.sca.org/heraldry/laurel/names/order/) dates the order name Star of the Noble House to 1351. This shows one example of a period order name constructed as [Item] of [Generic toponymic]. There are many period order names constructed as [Item] of [Placename] and many generic toponymics used in order names (most famously Temple and Hospital). Therefore, order names in the pattern [Item] of [Generic toponymic] are registerable, assuming that the item and generic toponymic are appropriate. Therefore, as the submitters allow any changes, we have changed this order name to Order of the Star of the Desert in order to register this name.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Badge (see RETURNS for order name Order of the Radiant Servants). Argent, a sun in splendor per saltire Or and azure and a bordure indented azure.\n\nAylwin Wyllowe. Device. Per chevron sable and vert, a bordure argent charged with three triquetras vert.\n\nBrigit of Tir Ysgithr. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Per bend purpure and Or, a butterfly Or and three columbines purpure slipped and leaved vert.\n\nSubmitted under the name Brigit inghean ui Chumaráin.\n\nClara of Mons Tonitrus. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Purpure, an increscent and on a chief embattled argent three increscents purpure.\n\nSubmitted under the name Clara de La Mare.\n\nClarastella MacGregor. Name.\n\nDiek Rabynovich. Name.\n\nDragos de la Severin. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Dragos Severin, Severin was documented as the name of a Romanian town. Commentary provided for a submission earlier this year showed that locative bynames in Romanian in period typically used de la before the name of the town:\n\nSubmitted as Pavla Satu Marin, the LoI submitted Satu Marin as \"a noun-based toponymic intended to mean 'Person of/from Satu-Mare'\" and asked for assistance from the College for determining a proper construction for this byname. Nebuly provided information regarding period forms for bynames based on the location Satu Mare:\n\nThe town of Satu Mare is mentioned in records dating from 1072 (Giurescu, p52). Judging by names in the chronology of rulers in the back of the book, locatives in Romanian may be formed as de la [placename] or [placename] + -escu. Since I do not know the grammar rules for adding-escu (or for creating its feminine form), and I have previously found period records using de la, I recommend Pavla de la Satu Mare as the best form for registration. [Pavla de la Satu Mare, March 2003 LoAR, Æthelmearc-A]\n\nUsing the information provided by Nebuly, we have changed this byname to de la Severin in order to register this name.\n\nEdric Longfellow. Badge. (Fieldless) Two stalks of barley in saltire within and conjoined to an annulet Or.\n\nEdric Longfellow. Household name Haus Tagestërne and badge. (Fieldless) A mullet of four points gyronny sable and argent within and conjoined to an annulet argent.\n\nSubmitted as Tagstern, this submission had a number of problems. This household name was submitted as a constructed word using the modern German words tag 'day' and stern 'star'. No evidence was provided that tagstern is a word in modern German, much less a word used in period. Examples were cited for construction patterns for English inn sign names. However, evidence of a pattern in English is not evidence for the same pattern in German.\n\nMetron Ariston found an Old High German dictionary online that lists tagestërne as a word in Middle High German:\n\nThe German parallel formation shown in Bahlow (Deutsches Namenlexikon, s.n. Stern), though undated, is Morgenstern. However, a quick look at the net found an on-line PDF version of an Old High German dictionary where under the letter T at www.koeblergerhard.de/germanistischewoerterbuecher/althochdeutscheswoerterbuch/ahdT.pdf I found the following entry: \"tagessterno* 1, ahd., sw. M. (n): nhd. Morgenstern; ne. morning star; ÜG.: lat. (sidus lucis) N, stella diei N; Hw.: s. tagasterno*; Q.: N (1000); I.: Lüs. lat. Stella diei; E.: s. tag, sterno; W.: s. mhd. tagestërne, sw. M., Morgenstern; nhd. Tagesstern, M., Tagstern, DW 21, 72, 85\".\n\nThis entry shows that tagestërne is equivalent to Morgenstern. Aryanhwy merch Catmael found Morgenstern as an undated surname in Bahlow:\n\nBahlow s.n. Morgen says \"Morgenstern [morning star] (freq.) can also be interpreted as a house name. <Leydestern> 1327: the Pole Star.\"\n\nBrechenmacher (p. 286 s.n. Morgenstern) dates Dietrich M. to 1374 and Heinrich M. to 1460, showing forms of Morgenstern were used as surnames in period.\n\nGiven the examples of Leydestern and Morgenstern dated to period, combined with the dictionary entry showing tagestërne as a Middle High German word with the same meaning as Morgenstern, it is plausible that Tagestërne could have been used as a surname in period.\n\nAs submitted, this household name included no designator, which is required for registration. The LoI noted:\n\nIf required, the household indicator Haus may be added to the name (e.g., Tagsternhaus); this follows the naming practices seen in Hoffbrauhaus, a German brewery dated back to 1160 A.D. (http://www.hofbrauhaus-freising.de/).\n\nHowever, the element -haus in this example is not used in the manner of a designator. Koira explains:\n\nAlso, _haus_ in Hofbräuhaus_ is not what we'd call a designator; rather, _Bräuhaus_ is the German word for Brewery, and the entire three-part compound glosses to _Royal Brewery_.\n\nA household name formed from this hypothetical surname Tagestërne would take the form Haus Tagestërne. We have changed this household name to this form in order to register this name.\n\nFinbarr Mathgamain mac Conchobair and Aífe Fael ingen Brénainn. Badge. Azure semy of compass stars, on a flame Or a crescent azure.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to have less overlap between the compass stars and the flames. In period armory, primary charges do at times overlap the surrounding strewn charges. However, because of the complex outline of this (period style) flame, and the fact that it is tinctured identically to the strewn charges which it overlaps, the overlap compromises the identfiability of both charge groups.\n\nGallant O'Driscole. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nSubmitted as Gallant O'Driscoll, the submitter requested authenticity for Irish. Gallant was documented as an English given name dating to 1210. Lacking evidence that it was used in Ireland in period, we were unable to make this name authentic according to the submitter's request.\n\nNo evidence was provided to support O'Driscoll as an Anglicized Irish form used in period. Woulfe (p. 507 s.n. Ó Drisceóil) dates the Anglicized Irish form O Driscole to temp. Elizabeth I-James I. Anglicized Irish forms of Gaelic bynames in late period sometimes appeared with a space after O and sometimes with an apostrophe. Therefore, O'Driscole is a plausible Anglicized Irish form in late period. We have changed the byname to this form to partially meet the submitter's request for authenticity and to register this name.\n\nGavin Skot of Stirling. Name and device. Sable, in pale two swords in saltire argent and a standing balance Or.\n\nHeleyne Scot of Motherwell. Name and device. Argent, in pale three thistles vert headed purpure between flaunches vert.\n\nAs noted in the February 2003 LoAR, \"The 'head' of the thistle is comprised of a ball of sepals with a tuft of petals at the top.\"\n\nIvan Petrovich. Device. Argent a pall inverted gules between two turtles and a single-horned anvil reversed sable.\n\nThe originally provided blazon was incorrect, and the Kingdom did not provide a letter of correction. However, enough commenters mentioned that they researched this submission under the correct tinctures and charges that we do not need to pend this for further conflict research.\n\nKathy of Tir Ysgithr. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Argent, a tulip bendwise purpure slipped vert within a bordure indented purpure.\n\nThe tulip was originally blazoned as a Turkish tulip. However, this appears to be a reasonable variant of the standard tulip and needs not be explicitly blazoned. This particular stylization of a tulip is found in period Middle Eastern art.\n\nSubmitted under the name Johari al-Noori.\n\nLachlan McBean. Device. Argent, a bird's leg erased bendwise sinister sable sustaining a thistle bendwise proper.\n\nThis submission was pended from the January 2003 LoAR due to an incorrectly described tincture: the bird's leg was blazoned as proper. Note that a generic bird does not have a defined proper tincture.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the head of the thistle proper correctly. Both in the heraldic default and in nature, the round ball of sepals is green, and is topped with a tuft of petals which may be either purpure (as in this submission) or gules.\n\nNatal'ia Diekova zhena Rabynovicha. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Natal'ia Dieka zhena Raynovicha, the form showed that this name was submitted as Natal'ia Dieka zhena Rabynovicha. We have made this correction.\n\nThe submitter has a letter of permission for her name to presume a relationship with Diek Rabynovich, registered earlier in this LoAR. When indicating a 'wife of' relationship in a woman's name in Russian in period, her husband's given name takes on the same form as it would in a patronymic. For example, Wickenden (3rd ed., p. 202 s.n. Mariia) dates Mar'itsa Fedorova zhena Neelova to 1538-9. Therefore, a name meaning that Natal'ia is the wife of Diek Rabynovich would take the form Natal'ia Diekova zhena Rabynovicha. We have made this correction in order to register this name.\n\nSláine O'Connor. Device. Gules, a frog and a chief dovetailed Or.\n\n'Abd al-Salam of Saint Artemas. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Argent, in sinister chief a mullet between the horns of a decrescent vert and a gore azure.\n\nSubmitted under the name Sharif 'Abd al-Salam ibn Salah.\n\nAdekin Caradoc. Name.\n\nAgnarr Kl{oe}ngsson. Name and device. Quarterly vert and azure, a griffin argent and a lion Or combattant.\n\nA'ishah bint Rashid al-Andalusi. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nListed on the LoI as 'A'isha bint Rashid al Andalusi, this name appeared on the forms as A'ishah bint Rashid al Andalusi. She requested an authentic name for the Middle East.\n\nThere are a variety of different ways to transliterate Arabic into English. We register any of them, only requiring that a single transliteration system be used for the entire name. al-Jamal observed:\n\nCommon transliterations of the name of Muhammad's daughter include: 'A'isha A'isha, Ayisha, and Ayesha. A'ishah should be equally acceptable.\n\nWe have therefore returned the name to its submitted form.\n\nAs submitted, the byname al Andalusi says that Rashid is from al-Andalus, not A'ishah. If she is the one from al-Andalus, the correct form is al-Andalusiyyah. We have not made this change, as either meaning is acceptable. However, we have added a hyphen between the article and the byname, as it is generally used in transcriptions of Arabic.\n\nAlfric Alfricson. Device. Per fess gules and vert, a tower argent between three roosters Or.\n\nAngels, Barony of the. Order name Order of the Seraph.\n\nSubmitted as Companions of the Seraph, the designator Companions does not clearly indicate that an entity is an order. As the last registration of Companions as a designator was in 1981, Companions is not SCA-compatible as a designator. We have changed the designator to Order in order to register this name.\n\nThis ruling only affects the registerability of Companions as a designator. Members of an order may be described as Companions of that order.\n\nWhile, as a new submission, this would probably conflict with the Swedish Order of the Seraphim, the conflict is grandfathered to the group, as Seraph Pursuivant was registered to the West in April 1981 for this barony's use, and transferred to Caid in August 1987. (In the past, heraldic titles for branches were required to be registered to their kingdom.)\n\nBalthazar van der Brugghe. Name and device. Argent, in pale a cloud sable and a bridge of one span gules masoned argent and a base wavy azure.\n\nSubmitted as Balthazar van Bruges, it appeared on the forms as Balthazar van der Bruges. The byname appears to combine elements of two distinct locative bynames used in Flanders: the Dutch van der Brugghe 'of/from the bridge' and the French de Bruges 'of/from Bruges.' The completely Dutch form of the latter would be van Brugge.\n\nDuring the commentary period, Cresent was in contact with the submitter regarding the options that commenters had found regarding this byname. Crescent noted in her commentary that the submitter preferred the form van der Brugge, with van Brugge as a secondary choice. As van der Brugghe is only one character from the submitter's preferred form, we have changed the byname to this form in order to register this name.\n\nBarrett of Muchelney. Name and device. Barry argent and gules, a lion sable within a bordure gules.\n\nBifru-Styrr Aðalbertsson. Name change from Albert of Greywater.\n\nHis previous name, Albert of Greywater, is retained as an alternate name.\n\nBrion Dargan. Name and device. Argent, two dragons combattant sable maintaining between them a step-cut gemstone palewise gules all within a bordure sable.\n\nCaoilfhionn inghean Amhlaoibh. Device. Argent, in pale two cauldrons and in fess two cats rampant sable.\n\nThe submitter blazoned the cats as rampant, but Kingdom reblazoned them as sejant erect. These cats are in an acceptable period depiction of rampant, and so we have returned the blazon to the original form. Each cat has its body positioned palewise, with its dexter foreleg pointing towards dexter chief, its sinister foreleg and dexter hindleg pointing to dexter, and its sinister hindleg pointing towards dexter base, so that all four legs are separated from each other. A number of period depictions of rampant animals and monsters resemble these cats, although as a general rule, rampant animals are usually drawn so that their sinister hindlegs point to base or even a bit towards sinister base. For discussion of this issue (with illustrations) see the Proceedings of the Knowne World Heraldic & Scribal Symposium (Trimaris A.S. XXIX 1994), \"On the Origins and Development of the Sejant Erect Posture\" by Zenobia Naphtali, particularly pp. 19-20.\n\nThis distinction between rampant and sejant erect is an issue of correctly re-creating the emblazon, not of difference. No evidence has yet been presented that the rampant and sejant erect postures would have been considered distinct in period: in fact, it does not appear that the sejant erect posture was described in period blazon (as discussed further in the 1994 article cited above). Thus, period practice appears to agree with the visually-based precedent in the LoAR of June 1992 (symposium), which stated: \"By SCA precedent, there's no difference between rampant and sejant erect. The only real change is the placement of a hind leg.\"\n\nCaroline Marie de Fontenailles. Device change. Azure, on a pale between two fleurs-de-lis argent an iris azure slipped and leaved vert all within a triple tressure argent.\n\nThe pale is within and conjoined to the inside of the triple tressure. This is the SCA default for an ordinary within an orle or tressure, per the LoAR of August 2001:\n\nIt is standard SCA practice for an ordinary within an orle or double tressure to stop at the inside of the surrounding charge, as per the reblazon of Rouland Carre's arms in January 1991:\n\nRouland Carre. Device. Argent, on a bend cotised azure within an orle gules, in chief a Latin cross argent.\n\n...In the real world, both the \"throughout\" and the \"within and conjoined to\" combinations of ordinaries and orles/double tressures may be found, without a clear default. David Lindsay of the Mount's 1542 roll of arms gives five examples of ordinaries combined with double tressures flory counterflory. There is support for both designs in this book: with the ordinary throughout, and with the ordinary within and conjoined to the double tressure flory counterflory.\n\nHer previous device, Sable, on a pale doubly endorsed argent, an iris azure slipped and leaved vert, is released.\n\nChristgaen von Köln. Name and device. Argent crusilly formy, a bordure sable.\n\nNice device! The SCA has been fairly consistent about reblazoning a group of more than eight charges that evenly covers a field or underlying charge as a group of strewn charges. We have thus reblazoned this device from the original blazon of ten crosses formy to crusilly formy. We note that should this device be drawn on another shape for heraldic display, such as a rectangular banner or a round shield, the submitter will quite likely find that a different number of charges will fill the space better.\n\nColin ap Llywarch. Device. Per pale argent and vert, two wyverns combattant counterchanged.\n\nDavid of the Wode. Name.\n\nSubmitted as David of the woods, no documentation was presented nor could any be found supporting the use of the word woods in a byname, as opposed to the singular wood. In addition, all dated forms of this byname had the Wood element capitalized. We have therefore changed the byname to a form dated to 1285 in Reaney and Wilson (s.n. Wood).\n\nDimitrii Serev. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Dimitrii Seryi, the submitter requested authenticity for 16th C Russia. Therefore, we have changed the byname from the nominative form to the patronymic form.\n\nDisa blat{o,}nn. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nListed on the LoI as Disa blatonn, this name was submitted as Disa Blatonn. The byname was changed at Kingdom to lowercase the byname to match standard transliteration conventions. However, the documented form of this byname is blat{o,}nn. While Old Norse names may be registered with or without accents, other diacritical marks cannot be omitted without documentation. Therefore, we have changed the o in the byname to {o,} (o-ogonek) in order to register this name.\n\nElena verch Gwalchmai. Device. Vert, a falcon argent within a bordure argent semy of triquetras vert.\n\nGalen de Leon. Name change from Galen the Clumsy.\n\nHis previous name, Galen the Clumsy, is released.\n\nGalen of Kildromy. Name and device. Argent, a wyvern erect contourny vert maintaining a sword inverted sable, a ford proper.\n\nJacob ffrayser. Name and device. Sable, a scorpion and on a chief indented argent a snake glissant vert.\n\nJohn Blod. Name and device. Sable, three lozenges conjoined in fess within an orle argent.\n\nGood name!\n\nJonathan Drake of Skye. Badge. (Fieldless) A sinister wing terminating in a hand argent sustaining a sabre bendwise sable.\n\nKevin Daniel Madoc. Device. Checky purpure and argent, on a chief sable a horse courant argent.\n\nKhalid of Dun Or. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Per fess azure and vert, a crux ansata and in chief a scimitar fesswise edge to chief argent.\n\nSubmitted under the name Khalid al-Adami 'Abd al-Aziz.\n\nKolfinna in kyrra. Name and device. Purpure, a squirrel rampant argent between three acorns Or and a bordure embattled argent.\n\nKolfinna k{o,}ttr. Switch of primary and alternate names Ciana Masina della Luna and badge. (Fieldless) A maiden maintaining a crescent and sustaining a spear argent.\n\nKolfinna k{o,}ttr (formerly her alternate name) is now her primary name. Ciana Masina della Luna (formerly her primary name) is now her alternate name.\n\nLeah of Sandy Stream. Name change from Kolli Benason.\n\nThe byname of Sandy Stream was documented as a constructed byname. However, no evidence was provided that stream was used as an element in placenames.\n\nSandy is a placename, dated as Sandeie to 1086 in Mills (s.n. Sandy). There is a pattern of English placenames created by appending surnames to existing placenames. Examples of this include Chilton Foliot 1221 (Mills, p. 78 s.n. Chilton), Northone Brun c. 1266 (Mills, p. 244 s.n. Norton), and Saunford Peverel 1275 (Mills, p. 284 s.n. Sampford). As Stream is a surname, dated to 1279 in the form ate Streme (Reaney & Wilson, s.n. Stream), a location Sandy located on or near an estate owned by the Stream family could come to be known as Sandy Stream.\n\nHer previous name, Kolli Benason, is released.\n\nLicia Solari. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Licia da Solari, this name was submitted as Licia de Solaria and changed at Kingdom to correct the locative byname to the form found in Fucilla. However, Fucilla gives modern forms; all examples found by the College of Solari in Italian in period appear without a preposition. Therefore, we have dropped da in order to match period examples of this surname and register this name.\n\nLot Ramirez. Name and device. Per chevron rayonny argent and azure, two crescents and a mullet of six points elongated to base counterchanged.\n\nLyonnete la cousturiere. Name.\n\nMarisse vanden Berghe. Name.\n\nMarius of Calydon. Name.\n\nMat of Forth Castle. Household name House Grenefot and badge. (Fieldless) The sole of a human foot vert.\n\nThe College felt strongly that, given the artwork in the emblazon, this was the depiction of a sole of a foot rather than a footprint. There were no suggestions made in the commentary about how to blazon the plantar view of a foot. Based on the discussions in Parker's A Glossary of Terms used in Heraldry and Woodward's A Treatise on Heraldry British and Foreign, it appears that human feet are in profile by default, so this posture must be explicitly blazoned. Woodward does cite (without a date) the arms of Voet in Flanders as, Azure, three human feet, the soles alone appearing, proper. We considered this blazon when creating the blazon for this badge.\n\nMat of Forth Castle and Adekin Caradoc. Household name Gwely Caradoc.\n\nListed on the LoI as Clann Caradoc, this name was submitted as Clan Caradoc. The LoI stated that \"The submitters note that 'If Clan is unacceptable, please change to correct Welsh designator.'\"\n\nRfS III.1.a requires linguistic consistency in a name phrase. As a household name is a single name phrase, the entire household name must be in a single language.\n\nAs Caradoc is Welsh, it may not be used with Clann, which is Gaelic, or with Clan, which is Scots or Anglicized Irish. Harpy provided information regarding a word in Welsh that has a close meaning to clan:\n\nIn my research, the type of name that seems to correspond best to the Gaelic \"clan\", in the sense of a group of closely-related individuals with mutual legal and economic obligations, uses the element \"gwely\", which literally means \"bed\", but in this context means \"a group of closely-related individuals who hold land in common (also the land held by such a group)\". These group/place names are normally constructed as \"gwely <personal name of common ancestor>\" where the ancestor may be identified by a given name or a full personal name or much more rarely by some other descriptor.\n\nSome examples of this type of name from the mid 14th century rental in the Black Book of St. Davids include:\n\ngwele Cradoc ap Duryn~\n\ngwele Ieuan ap Kediuor\n\ngwele Gwylbrid'\n\ngwele redwyth'\n\nHarpy explained that the form gwele found in the examples below is a non-standard spelling used in this source, and that the standard spelling for this time period would be gwely. She also provided the correct form of this household name using Gwely as a designator:\n\nGwely Caradoc (the near descendents of Caradoc who hold land in common, also the land they hold)\n\nAs the submitters allow any changes, we have changed this household name to Gwely Caradoc as recommended by Harpy to make this name completely Welsh in order to register this name.\n\nMax Erich von Baden. Name (see RETURNS for badge).\n\nNote: Max is his legal given name and Erich is his legal middle name. As Erich is, by type, a given name, it may be used in a given name position in this name.\n\nMegen Paget. Name change from Meghan Fiona Paget.\n\nHer previous name, Meghan Fiona Paget, is released.\n\nMikael Wynter. Name.\n\nMora de Buchanan. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nMora Gowe. Name and device. Per fess purpure and vert, two stags trippant counter-trippant Or.\n\nNicola da Lipari. Device. Vert, a griffin and on a chief dovetailed Or three mullets vert.\n\nThis device does not conflict with the Canton of Griffin's Keep, Vert, a griffin segreant and on a chief embattled Or a laurel wreath vert, because the canton's device was released in December 1989.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw fewer and larger repeats of the complex line on the chief.\n\nObedia la calavera. Name and device. Sable, three chevronels and on a chief argent three fleurs-de-lys gules.\n\nOttavia Spadera. Device. Quarterly gules and purpure, a gyno-sphinx couchant contourny within a bordure rayonny Or.\n\nRachel of Sandy Stream. Name and device. Argent, a schnecke issuant from sinister chief and in dexter chief a seeblatt purpure.\n\nThe byname of Sandy Stream was documented as a constructed byname. However, no evidence was provided that stream was used as an element in placenames.\n\nSandy is a placename, dated as Sandeie to 1086 in Mills (s.n. Sandy). There is a pattern of English placenames created by appending surnames to existing placenames. Examples of this include Chilton Foliot 1221 (Mills, p. 78 s.n. Chilton), Northone Brun c. 1266 (Mills, p. 244 s.n. Norton), and Saunford Peverel 1275 (Mills, p. 284 s.n. Sampford). As Stream is a surname, dated to 1279 in the form ate Streme (Reaney & Wilson, s.n. Stream), a location Sandy located on or near an estate owned by the Stream family could come to be known as Sandy Stream.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the schnecke so that it is more centered on the field. The curl of the schnecke should extend both above and below the center point of the field.\n\nRobert James Buchanan. Name and device. Vert, a cross between in bend a triskele and a tower Or.\n\nRosa Maria da Cosenza. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Rosa Maria di Cosenza, the particle used with in locative bynames in Italian is da, not di. We have made this change.\n\nSiobhán inghean an Chamsroin. Device. Per pale gules and purpure, three triquetras argent.\n\nSören Nielsen. Device. Sable, a winged tree blasted and eradicated and in chief four crescents argent.\n\nSouth Crossewaie, College of. Branch name.\n\nSubmitted as College of Southern Crossewaies, this name had two problems.\n\nFirst, while evidence was offered that the adjective southern was used as a word, no evidence was presented, nor could any be found, that an English placename would be formed by adding Southern, rather than South, to the name of an existing placename. We have changed Southern to South in order to register this name.\n\nSecond, no evidence was presented nor could any be found for the use of the plural -waies in a placename. The single period OED citation of crosse-waies, dated to 1590, clearly refers to multiple locations, not a single place. Lacking evidence that the plural -waies would be used in an English placename, we have changed the plural Crossewaies to the singular Crossewaie in order to register this name.\n\nSteffen von Ostdorf. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Steffan von Ostdorf, both the forms and the documentation showed the given name as Steffen. We have made this correction.\n\nUlrich von Kallenberg. Name.\n\nValeria Tertia Alexandrina. Device. Argent, a pall inverted vert between three annulets gules.\n\nWalter Ribelinck. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Walter Riebling, the submitted form is too close to his legal name, Walter Riebli. Section III.A.9 of the Administrative Handbook requires that an SCA name must differ from a submitter's legal name. In this case, the only difference is the added consonant cluster at the end of an unemphasized syllable. Similarly small changes have previously been ruled insufficient. However, other different forms of the same name are dated to period; Bartold Ribelinck is dated to 1524 in Brechenmacher (s.n. Ribeling). This form adds a syllable to the submitter's legal name, as well as changing the final syllable. Therefore, it is sufficiently different from the submitter's legal surname to allow registration of this name. We have, therefore, made this change.\n\nWilliam de Cameron. Name and device. Sable, a fess ermine.\n\nNice (yea, magnificent) device!\n\nAndrew of Marion Glen. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name). Per fess Or and sable, a bull's head cabossed and a sun in its splendor counterchanged.\n\nSubmitted under the name Andrew MacLeod.\n\nBesina da Verona. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Besina Daverona, the submission form had the entire name capitalized and it is unclear whether or not there is a space between DA and VERONA. However, the attached Pennsic consultation worksheet clearly showed the byname as da Verona. As this form matches the submitted documentation, we have changed the byname to this form.\n\nCelestine Albret de Morat. Badge. Quarterly vert and argent, a flame Or between in bend two spear tips argent and in bend sinister two hearts gules.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the spear tips so that they are clearly spearpoints, rather than lozenges. Spear tips are drawn with a more pronounced attachment (ferrule) at the bottom of the charge, and are more elongated than the charges drawn here.\n\nCorwyn Ambrose. Name and device. Per pall sable vert and argent, in base an increscent argent and a dragon passant gules.\n\nThere was some question whether this name was sounded too similar to Corwin of Amber from Roger Zelazny's Amber novels. The byname of Amber is a locative byname. The byname Ambrose is a patronymic byname. These bynames do not have the same origin and so must be evaluated solely by whether they are significantly different in both sound and appearance. The two bynames have sufficient difference in appearance, so the issue is whether there is sufficient difference between the sound of the bynames.\n\nIgnoring of, there is the final syllable is different between Ambrose and Amber. The level of difference is similar to the difference between the given names Conor and Conan which were ruled clear in 1996 (Conan MacPherson, April 1996 LoAR). The Gaelic name Conán is pronounced approximately \"KUHN-an\", rather than \"KOH-nan\", the pronunciation of the hero of Conan the Barbarian. So the first syllable in the Gaelic Conán is pronounced the same as the first syllable in Conor, which means that the second syllables in these names contribute the significant difference necessary to clear these two names. The difference beween the second syllables in Conan and Conor is smaller than the difference between the second syllables in Ambrose and Amber. Therefore, the byname Ambrose does not conflict with the byname of Amber.\n\nDinara Torzhokskaia. Name and device. Per chevron gules and vert, a pall inverted between two horseshoes inverted and a horse's head couped argent.\n\nSubmitted as Dinara Torzhok, the submitter requested authenticity for Russian and allowed minor changes.\n\nTorzhok was documented as a period location in Russia. However, unmodified placenames were not used as bynames in Russian. Instead, the name of the place was modified in one of several ways. A recent ruling discussed this issue with Novgorod as the placename in question:\n\nLocative bynames can take different forms in Russian, including nouns, patronymics, and adjectives. Wickenden (3rd edition, pp. xxviii - xxvix) lists a thorough description of these constructions. A summary of the more common forms is provided below. Quoted text is from this section of Wickenden. Forms constructed according to these rules are in parenthesis.\n\nNouns: \"a noun formed from the place name, usually meaning 'inhabitant of' or 'citizen of'.\" (Novgorodets)\n\nPatronymics: \"Literally these 'patronymics' would be translated as 'son/daughter of <place name>', as if the city was the father of the person.\" Wickenden uses Novgorod as an example in this entry where he gives the patronymic form as Novgorodtsev and says of it that it means \"'son of Novgorodets' or literally 'son of a Novgorodite'\". Pennon found a dated example of this type of byname: \"According the Dictionary or Period Russian names; Paul Goldschmidt, <http://www.sca.org/heraldry/paul/zgrammar.html>; s.n. Toponyms: dates Sidor Novgorodov (15th Century) [Gra 276] (\"from Novgorod\");\"\n\nAdjectives: \"'the person of <place name>' or 'the <place name>-ish person.' The person is described as being colored by his/her place of birth, bearing the place (as a Russian would say) in their soul.\" (Novgorodskii, Novgorodskoi Novgorodskyi, Novgorodskogo)\n\nAs the adjectival form is the form most commonly associated with locative bynames in Russian, we have changed the submitted byname of Novgorod to the form Novgorodskii to meet the submitter's request to translated the byname into Russian. [Jurik Novgorodskii, July 2003 LoAR, Atenveldt-A]\n\nIn this case, Nebuly provided the appropriate locative bynames formed from the placename Torzhok; the noun form being Torzhoketsa, the patronymic form being Torzhokova (as noted on the LoI), and the adjectival form being Torzhokskaia. As in the example cited above, we have changed this byname to the adjectival form in order to register this name.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the bottom part of the pall inverted a bit higher on the field so that there is more room for the horse's head in base.\n\nFrederich Kober von Rostock. Name and device. Quarterly gules and argent, two bulls passant guardant argent.\n\nSubmitted as Fredrick Kober von Rostock, the submitter requested authenticity for 14th to 15th C German and allowed minor changes. Fredrick was documented as a Low German form while the remainder of the name was documented as High German. In period, a person with this name would have had their name written in Low German or in High German depending upon the language in which their name was recorded. We have registered this name in a fully High German form in order to meet the submitter's request for authenticity.\n\nFriða Sørkvisdóttir. Name and device. Per fess sable and vert, in bend three suns Or.\n\nSubmitted as Friða Sørkvirsdóttir, the patronymic Sørkvirsdóttir was not correctly formed. The patronymic byname formed from the masculine given name Sørkvir is Sørkvisdóttir. We have made this correction.\n\nGavin d'Orleans. Name.\n\nPeter Larcombe the Merchant. Name change from holding name Peter the Merchant.\n\nNote: Larcombe is his legal middle name.\n\nPierre Vorman de Saint Germain. Name (see PENDS for device).\n\nSubmitted as Pierre von Vorman RaKogscy de Saint Germain, there were a number of issues with this name.\n\nSeveral elements of this name were submitted under the Legal Name Allowance. The submitted documentation states that the submitter's legal name is Pierre von Vorman Philosephales d'St. Germain. However, no photocopy of documentation (such as a driver's license) was received by the Laurel office supporting this as the submitter's legal name. Lacking such supporting documentation, this name must be evaluated without benefit of the Legal Name Allowance.\n\nAs submitted, this combined French (Pierre and de Saint Germain), German (von Vorman), and Hungarian (RaKogscy) in a single name. Lacking evidence that there was a time and place that these three languages would have been spoken at the same time, this combination violates RfS III.1, which states in part, \"Each name as a whole should be compatible with the culture of a single time and place.\"\n\nNo documentation was provided and none was found that the byname von Vorman is plausible as a German byname in period. Nebuly explains:\n\nThe element Vorman is a German byname meaning \"man who lives by the ford\", which means that it would not take the preposition von, since Vorman is a description of a person and not the name of a place.\n\nLacking evidence that the byname Vorman would have included the particle von in period, we have dropped this element in order to register this name.\n\nNo documentation was presented and none was found that RaKogscy is a plausible period form. Nebuly explains:\n\nThe element RaKogscy does not appear in Bahlow, and despite the LoI association, it does not derive from the Polish town of Rakow. It appears to be a fanciful spelling of the name Ragoczy, used in the [Chelsea Quinn] Yarbro [vampire] novels. This byname is Hungarian (all vampires are ultimately Hungarian, aren't they?), and it derives either from Ragyócí or Rákóci.\n\nLacking support for the form RaKogscy, and lacking evidence that French, German, and Hungarian would plausibly be combined in a name in period, we have dropped this element in order to register this name.\n\nThe form Pierre Vorman de Saint Germain also avoids conflict with the submitter's possible mundane use name of Pierre von Vorman d'St. Germain by removal of the element von.\n\nTir Briste, Shire of. Device change. Per saltire argent and vert, a laurel wreath and on a chief sable three mullets of eight points argent.\n\nTheir previous device, Per pale sable and vert, on a plate within a laurel wreath argent a tree proper, is maintained as ancient arms per section II.D.2 of the Administrative Handbook, which states \"If a branch changes its arms, it may retain the old arms under the designation 'Ancient Arms.'\".\n\nPlease advise the shire to draw the laurel wreath with less of a gap between the arms at the top. \"A laurel wreath should have a round shape, rather than a \"U\" or \"V\" shape, and they should be completely closed, or almost completely closed, at the top\" (LoAR November 2002, p.18)\n\nTustan le Blanc. Name.\n\nGood name!\n\nZofeia Iul'iana Iastrebova zhena. Name and device. Or, on a pile engrailed vert in chief a lion dormant contourny Or.\n\nSubmitted as Zofeia Iul'iana zhena Iastreyeva, the submitter requested authenticity for Russian and allowed minor changes.\n\nThe given names Zofeia and Iul'iana are both Christian names rather than native Slavic names. When two given names were used in Russian in period, one name was a native Slavic name and the other was a Christian baptismal name. Therefore, the combination of Zofeia and Iul'iana in this name is not authentic. Using two Christian given names in Russian was ruled registerable, though a weirdness, in the June 1997 LoAR. As the submitter does not allow major changes, we were unable to drop one of these given names in order to meet her request for authenticity.\n\nThe byname element Iastreyeva was not correctly constructed. Nebuly explains:\n\n[T]he element Iastreyeva is undocumented. The documented form is Iastrebova or Iastrebtsova, and there is no evidence presented for the b to become a y. Secondly, the word zhena, which indicates that she is a wife, should follow the name of her husband as in the examples given by Wickenden on pp xxvi-xxvii.\n\nWe have changed Iastreyeva to Iastrebova as noted by Nebuly.\n\nThe byname zhena Iastrebova is a single name phrase consisting of the elements zhena 'wife' and Iastrebova. All examples of this type of byname that were found by the College had the element zhena 'wife' after the element referring to her husband's given name. Therefore, the construction Iastrebova zhena, not zhena Iastrebova, is supported by these examples.\n\nWhile changing the order of name phrases in a name is a major change, changing where a particle appears within a name phrase is a minor change. This level of change is similar to dropping a particle (such as mac) in a name phrase, which is a minor change, while dropping the entire phrase is a major change. Therefore, we have placed zhena after Iastrebova in this byname in order to register this name.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw deeper and fewer engrailings on the pile.\n\nMinamoto Genkurô Tanekagé. Name and badge. Gyronny of sixteen argent and sable, a bordure counterchanged.\n\nThe submitted yobina Genkurô uses a non-standard transliteration. The term romanji is used to describe Japanese words rendered using a Roman character set. There are several standard transliteration systems used in writing romanji. Any of these transliteration systems may be used in an SCA name, but one transliteration system must be used throughout the entire name.\n\nGenkurô uses the Hepburn system for transliteration. However, the Hepburn system uses a macron over letters rather than a caret. Therefore, this name is correctly written as Genkur{o-} using the Hepburn system, not Genkurô. As macrons can be difficult to render in publishing, they are often left off. Hence T{o-}ky{o-} is rendered as Tokyo. Solveig Throndardottír, in her book Name Construction in Medieval Japan (NCMJ) uses a modified Hepburn system that would render this name as Genkurou. Therefore, this yobina is registerable as Genkur{o-}, Genkuro, or Genkurou, depending upon which transliteration system the submitter chooses to use.\n\nNo support was found for the accent on the final letter of Tanekagé. Also, no evidence was found that Tanekage is a plausible masculine nanori either in period or modernly. The submitter documented the kanji characters for Tane 'offspring' and kage 'shadow' from Edward of Effingham's \"Online Japanese Miscellany\" (http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/Miscellany/Names.html). The character the submitter indicated for kage is found in NCMJ (2nd ed., p. 180 s.n. Bright/Magnificent). Regarding this character, Solveig states that \"when used in personal names, this character appears [to] mean 'bright' and 'magnificent' and not 'shadow' as the permissible Chinese reading for this character in personal names represents 'bright' and not 'shadow'\". The character the submitter indicated for tane is found in NCMJ (pp. 204-205 s.n. Blood Heir).\n\nWhile many different kanji characters appear in medieval Japanese names, not all combinations are plausible. Names were formed from kanji combinations that made sense to the medieval Japanese mind. To determine whether a hypothetical combination is plausible, it is useful to compare it to documented names. There are three names that combine a kanji character meaning 'bright' with the kanji character for 'Blood Heir': Akitane (Bright + Blood Heir) dated to 1332, Masatane (Clear/Bright + Blood Heir) dated to 1600, and Mitsutane (Bright/Shining + Blood Heir) dated to 1600. In each of these cases, the element meaning 'Blood Heir' comes second. Therefore, Kagetane would be a plausible nanori while Tanekage is not.\n\nWhen two kanji characters are combined to form a name element, they are viewed as a single name element. Changing their order would be similar to changing a specific given name in a name submission to a completely different (though, perhaps, similar sounding) name. A parallel case would be the Old English names Bealdwine and Winebeald found in Searle. Both names are formed from the themes beald and wine. However, they are two different names. Similarly, changing the nanori in this submission from Tanekage to Kagetane would be a major change, which the submitter does not allow.\n\nThe badge conflicts with Wulfgar Neumann, registered in September 2002, Gyronny sable and argent, a bordure counterchanged. The SCA gives no difference between gyronny of sixteen and the default gyronny of eight, although we usually note the distinction between the two types of gyronny in blazon. There is no difference for changing the order of the tinctures in gyronny fields per RfS X.4.a and the SCA has traditionally extended this lack of difference to gyronny charges. There are thus no CDs between these two pieces of armory.\n\nHis device has been registered under the holding name Kevin of Sentinels' Keep.\n\nStephen Other. Device. Azure, a sword the blade fimbriated of flame proper within a bordure erminois.\n\nWe have reblazoned the sword blade to be fimbriated of flames proper rather than enflamed proper (as in the LoI), as it more clearly describes the emblazon. Here, the blade is entirely surrounded by tongues of flame radiating out from the sword. At no point does the sword blade touch the field. The small tongues of flame follow the outline of the blade closely, giving the appearance of outlining (or \"fimbriating\") the sword blade with flame.\n\nThe Letter of Intent stated, albeit without documentation, that the depiction of the sword in this emblazon was \"not all that different from enflamed objects one occasionally sees in religious paintings.\" Even if documentation were produced for swords with this appearance in period paintings, that does not guarantee the design's acceptability in heraldry. RfS VII.2 states \"Use of an element in period art does not guarantee its acceptability for armory. Use of the Greek key design, which was common in period decorative art, never carried over into armory.\" In order to document this design for use in SCA heraldry, it is necessary to produce examples of this sort of enflaming in period heraldry.\n\nThis submission therefore has a stylistic problem that is equivalent to the problem described in the following return from the April 1999 LoAR. Please advise the submitter to read this previous return closely, as it describes how we expect period enflamed objects in heraldry to be drawn, as well as why the drawing found here does not meet those expectations.\n\nThis submission suffers from the same problem which resulted in a return to Walram von Laufenberg (Fieldless) a flame gules, winged argent, surmounted by the blade of a sword proper in the May 1998 LoAR. At that time we said:\n\n\"While blazoned on the LoI as (Fieldless) between a pair of wings argent a sword blade proper enflamed gules., we have reblazoned to more accurately reflect the emblazon, as \"Period enflamed has a few gouttes of flame scattered around the edge of the charge being enflamed. Where the flame completedly surrounds an object, that object is said to be 'on a flame'. (Da'ud ibn Auda, LoAR May 1992, p. 26). \"We don't permit flaming fimbriation in Society armory.\" (Bruce Draconarius of Mistholme, 24 July 1993 Cover Letter, (with the June 1993 LoAR), p. 5-6.\"\n\nWe see no reason to overturn our ruling, and we are returning this for the same reason.\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Radiant Servants.\n\nNo documentation was provided and none was found that Order of the Radiant Servants follows a period pattern of order names as required by RfS III.2.b.ii, which states in part that \"Names of orders and awards must follow the patterns of the names of period orders and awards.\" Siren explains:\n\n[I]n describing a pattern <adjective noun> and combining order names based on charges and order names based on religious artifacts in that pattern, Meredudd and Kwellend-Njal did us a bit of a disservice. There are really two distinct patterns. One is <color+charge>; in form these are like inn sign names. The other is complex desciptions of items of religious significance, using adjectives like \"Precious\" and \"Holy.\" [...] Only a few order names do not fit in one of these two groups. Of them, a few fit the pattern <adj+knights>, where the adjective is really what we might call the order name (Knights Templar, Golden Knights, etc.). [T]he order names following this pattern either use a geographical location, a color adjective, or a trait such as \"poor.\" The one more abstract example is <Angelical Knights>, which is again a religious reference. I'm not sure how <Radiant> is justifiable given these examples.\n\nAs noted by Siren, the adjectives used to describe groups of people do not include attributes such as Radiant. Lacking evidence that Radiant Servants follows a period pattern used for order names, this order name is not registerable.\n\nBrigit inghean ui Chumaráin. Name.\n\nThe byname inghean ui Chumaráin was submitted as a feminine form of Ó Cumaráin, which was documented from MacLysaght (p. 35 s.n. Cameron). No documentation was provided and none was found that the name Ó Cumaráin existed in period. Lacking such evidence, the submitted byname is not registerable.\n\nAs the submitter only allows minor changes, and changing the language of the byname is a major change, we were unable to change this name from the Irish Gaelic inghean ui Chumaráin to the Scots Cameron in order to register this name.\n\nHer armory has been registered under the holding name Brigit of Tir Ysgithr.\n\nClara de La Mare. Name.\n\nEna Weshen-eskey gav. Name.\n\nThis name combines an Anglicized Irish feminine given name with a Romany placename. However, no evidence was provided showing that Anglicized Irish and Romany were spoken in the same location in the same time period. Lacking such evidence, this lingual mix is not registerable as it does not meet RfS III.1, which states in part \"As a rule of thumb, languages should be used together only if there was substantial contact between the cultures that spoke those languages [...] Each name as a whole should be compatible with the culture of a single time and place.\" Lacking evidence that Anglicized Irish speakers and Romany speakers had substantial contact in period, this combination is not registerable.\n\nAdditionally, there were problems with each element in this name.\n\nThe information provided in the LoI for Ena was:\n\nEna is found in Withycombe (3rd edition, p. 104) as a semi-Anglicization of the Irish feminine and masculine given name Eithne; O Corrain and Maguire corroborate this under Eithne (pp. 84-5), citing anglicized forms as Anne, Annie and Ena.\n\nHowever, this information does not support Ena as a period Anglicization of the Gaelic feminine given name Eithne. As noted by Metron Ariston:\n\nThe anglicization noted in Ó Corráin and Maguire is undated and probably quite late. Withycombe's citation indicates that this anglicization became popular with the birth of an English princess in 1887 which is hardly evidence for period usage.\n\nLacking evidence that Ena is a period Anglicized Irish form of the Gaelic Eithne, it is not registerable.\n\nWeshen-eskey gav was documented as the Romany name for Epping, England. However, no evidence was found that this name dates to period. Further, no evidence was found that locative bynames were used in Romany in period. Either of these issues would be sufficient reason for return of this byname.\n\nAs the submitter allows any changes, this name would be registerable as Eithne of Epping. However, it was generally felt that these changes were more substantial than is generally expected in a major change. Therefore, we are returning this name.\n\nGallant O'Driscole. Device. Per chevron vert and argent, two double-bitted axes argent and a compass rose sable.\n\nIn the full-sized emblazon, the annulet portion of the compass rose is drawn unacceptably thin: it is not an annulet but a single very thin line (one fine tip pen width wide on the full-sized form.) This is a reason for return in itself, as RfS VII.7.a requires that \"Elements must be recognizable solely from their appearance\", and elements drawn with such thin lines are too thin to be recognized.\n\nThere was a significant discrepancy between the full-sized emblazon and the mini-emblazon. The mini-emblazon showed the compass star with a normally drawn annulet. In addition, the proportions of the per chevron field were different between the full-sized and mini-emblazons, although both depictions of a per chevron field are acceptable.\n\nA significant discrepancy between the full-sized and mini-emblazon can be reason for return in itself, and is certainly a reason for return when the mini-emblazon's depiction masks a significant style issue with the armory on the full-sized emblazon. The Administrative Handbook requirements for preparation of letters of intent state that \"An accurate representation of each piece of submitted armory shall be included on the letter of intent.\" The Cover Letter for the April 2002 LoAR stated:\n\nIn the last few months, there have been cases where the mini-emblazon included with the Letter of Intent did not accurately represent the emblazon on the submission form. If the emblazon does not match the form, the CoA cannot produce useful commentary, which in turn does not allow a decision on that item. The CoA has enough to review without commenting on the \"wrong\" item. A mismatch between the LoI emblazon and what is on the submission form can be reason for administrative return. If you produce LoIs, please double-check that the mini-emblazons on your letters are a good representation of the emblazons on the submission forms.\n\nJohari al-Noori. Name.\n\nNo documentation was presented and none was found to support Johari as a name used in period. Further, no documentation was presented for the byname al-Noori at all. and the College found no evidence that it is a period byname. Lacking evidence that these name elements were used in period, this name is not registerable.\n\nHer armory has been registered under the holding name Kathy of Tir Ysgithr.\n\nA'ishah bint Rashid al-Andalusi. Device. Gules, two peacocks respectant Or.\n\nPeacocks are close by default, with their tails extending behind them, and closed up (rather than being fanned out). The SCA has blazoned some peacocks close as pavonated to base (indicating that the tail points downwards), but the exact orientation of the tail of a peacock close is an artistic choice rather than a heraldic distinction. A peacock close could legitimately be drawn with the tail pointing straight behind the peacock, to base, or even somewhat towards the chief, as long as the tail is not fanned out. The exact orientation of the tail of a peacock close thus does not need to be explicitly blazoned and is not worth difference. A peacock in his pride, which is affronty with its tail fanned out and held up behind its body, must be explicitly blazoned. There is a posture CD between a peacock close and a peacock in his pride.\n\nBecause there is no difference between a default peacock and a peacock pavonated to base, the device conflicts with Gorandookht Mamigonian, Gules, two peacocks pavonated to base respectant and a pomegranate Or. There is only one CD for removing the pomegranate.\n\nThe peacock tails in this emblazon are held so that they point behind the peacocks and the end of each tail curves to chief. This is a Byzantine and Eastern stylization of a peacock. Some members of the College felt that the identifiability of the peacocks had been diminished by the unusual tail depiction. Although we feel that these peacocks are adequately recognizable in a Western artistic context, please advise the submitter to be careful to draw the peacocks so that they are clearly identifiable in the context of Western heraldic art.\n\nWe also note that the submitter has drawn the peacocks' tails with substantial amounts of detail in argent, vert, and sable. Please advise the submitter to draw the tails of the Or peacocks so that they are more predominantly Or.\n\nAnastasia de Ravenna MacEwan. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Anastasia MacEwan da Ravenna, this name was submitted as Anastasia de Ravenna MacEwan. The order of the bynames was changed at Kingdom to follow period examples of names having a surname first, followed by a locative byname. The form indicates that the submitter accepts only minor changes, and no indication was given on the LoI that the submitter was contacted and that she permitted reversing these bynames. Lacking evidence that the submitter allowed major changes, or specifically allowed the switch of the order of these bynames, this change should not have been made.\n\nHowever, without this change, the name is not registerable. There is no evidence that patronymic bynames such as MacEwan appeared after locative bynames such as da Ravenna in either Scots or Italian. Therefore, this name must be returned.\n\nAngels, Barony of the. Badge redesignation for Order of the Halo. Gules, a lyre Or within two wings conjoined argent.\n\nThe name for the Order of the Halo was returned in the June 2003 LoAR. We cannot therefore associate this badge with the returned name.\n\nChristina O'Cleary and Anderewe Hawkewood. Badge. (Fieldless) A demon's head cabossed gules jessant of an arrow Or.\n\nAll the members of the College who commented on this submission indicated that the artistic style of the demon's head was overly cartoonish and overly modern style. RfS VIII.4.d, \"Modern Style\", states that \"Charges may not ...be patterned after comic book art.\" We also note that the particular type of this head affronty is obscured by its extreme grimace.\n\nDisa blat{o,}nn. Device. Quarterly azure and sable, on a mullet of eight points argent a harp sable.\n\nConflict with Fine of Clare, Per pale azure and gules, on a sun argent an estoile of eight rays sable. There is one CD for changing the field. There is no difference between a sun and a mullet of eight points per the following precedent: \"There is ... nothing for the difference between a sun and a multi-pointed mullet\" (LoAR May 1998, p. 28). Mullets are not eligible for RfS X.4.j.ii per the following precedent: \"There is one CD for fieldlessness, but as the mullets are not simple charges, there is no CD for changing the type only of the tertiary. (LoAR June 1994, p.15). Thus, there is no difference for changing the type only of the tertiary charge.\n\nErich von Drachenholz. Badge for Die Roten Dracken Kompanie. Per bend sinister rayonny argent and gules, a dragon salient contourny gules.\n\nConflict with a badge of Graidhne ni Ruaidh, (Fieldless) A dragon rampant to sinister gules maintaining a straight trumpet Or. There is one CD for fieldlessness. There is no difference for the change to the dragon's location on the field in comparison to a fieldless badge. There is no posture difference between rampant to sinister and salient contourny. There is no difference for removing the maintained charge.\n\nThis also conflicts with the device of Wilfred de Ackelonde, Per pale vert and argent, a dragon contourny gules. There is one CD for changing the field. A dragon contourny is rampant to sinister, so again, there is no difference between rampant to sinister and salient contourny. There is no difference for the location of the dragon on the field. The gules dragon in Erich's badge may not overlap the gules portion of the field and thus must be placed entirely on the argent portion of the field, in dexter chief. Therefore the move of the dragon from the center of the field (as in Wilfred's armory) is \"caused by other changes to the design\" (the change to the field) and thus is not worth difference by RfS X.4.g.\n\nKhalid al-Adami 'Abd al-Aziz. Name.\n\nThis name has the form [given name] [byname] [given name]. Lacking evidence that this construction is plausible in period, it is not registerable. al-Jamal describes the issues with this name:\n\nKhalid is a well-documented period masculine given name, found in the names of Abu Khalid al-Khurasani; Abu Khalid ibn 'Amr ibn Khalid al-Wasiti; Khalid ibn Barmak, and a bunch of others.\n\nAl-Adami is another documentably period name, found in the name of Abu Sa'id Sahl ibn Ziyad al-Adami (from the Fihrist of al-Nadim, a translation of a 10th Century source, vol. 2, p. 1088).\n\n'Abd al-Aziz, \"servant of the Almighty\", is another well-documented period name, with many, many examples.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with the grammar. The form here is <given name> + <byname> + <given name>, a form not found in Arabic naming practices. The smallest change that I can recommend (and it's not what I would call a minor change) would be to make Khalid the son of 'Abd al-Aziz and to move the byname to the usual terminal position: Khalid ibn 'Abd al-Aziz al-Adami. [...] The other change that might be made, which is also a major change, would be to drop 'Abd al-Aziz, making him Khalid al-Adami.\n\nAs the submitter does not allow major changes, we are unable to make either of the changes suggested by al-Jamal in order to register this name.\n\nHis armory has been registered under the holding name Khalid of Dun Or.\n\nMax Erich von Baden. Badge. Per pale gules and sable, a sword Or surmounted by a skull argent.\n\nThe submission was withdrawn by the submitter.\n\nMealla Caimbeul. Name.\n\nMealla is the modern form of Mella, which Ó Corráin & Maguire state was the name of the mother of Saint Manchán of Lemanaghan. Precedent states that the names of people mentioned in saints' legends are not registerable:\n\nÓ Corráin & Maguire (p. 46 s.n. Cassair) gives this as the name of a holy virgin included in the legend of Saint Kevin. No evidence has been found that this name was used by humans in period. Names of saints are registerable, regardless of whether they are apocryphal or not. This policy is due to the practice in many cultures (though not in Gaelic) of naming children for saints. (For more details, see the Cover Letter for the September 2001 LoAR.) As Cassair was not herself a saint and the name has not been documented as having been otherwise used in period, it falls into the category of a legendary name and is not registerable. [Cassair Warwick, 02/02, R-Atlantia]\n\nSimilarly, as Mealla was not herself a saint and the name has not been documented as having been otherwise used in period, it falls into the category of a legendary name and is not registerable.\n\nMora de Buchanan. Device. Per chevron purpure and vert, a winged owl's head cabossed and in chief a crescent argent.\n\nSome members of the College did not find the owl's head as drawn here to be identifiable. We note that this is a very stylized depiction of an owl's head, without a clearly drawn beak or eyes.\n\nThose members of the College who were able to identify the owl's head all perceived this \"winged owl's head cabossed\" as a depiction of an owl flying straight out of the shield towards the viewer. While the SCA does register many winged objects, such as winged swords, they generally cannot be perceived as anything other than a winged object. When one adds wings to a bird's head cabossed, one does not perceive a winged bird's head, but one perceives an entire bird seen flying towards the viewer, which is to say, a bird volant affronty. Previous precedent notes that \"The posture volant affronty has been ruled unsuitable for use in heraldry on at least two occasions ... on the grounds that it is \"inherently unidentifiable\"... in those case[s] the returns involved birds... [This return was of a demi-pegasus.]\" (LoAR February 1998 p. 18).\n\nPleae advise the submitter that, if she plans to resubmit using an owl's head, she should draw it as a more standard heraldic owl's head to avoid the identifiability problems in this submission.\n\nMuirenn ingen meic Martain. Device. Per fess vert and sable, issuant from a vol argent a sinister hand argent.\n\nConflict with Francois le Féroce, Per chevron vert and argent, in chief two wings addorsed argent. There is one CD for changing the field. The wings \"addorsed\" are effectively displayed and separated, and are not different from two similar wings conjoined into a vol. The hand in this submission is effectively maintained by the vol and its addition is not worth difference. There is no difference for the location of the wings on the field. The argent wings in Francois' badge may not overlap the argent portion of the field and thus must be placed entirely on the vert portion of the field, in chief. Because the placement of the wings in Francois' armory is forced by the field (\"caused by other changes to the design\"), it is thus is not worth difference by RfS X.4.g.\n\nNinian of Man. Name change from holding name Kay of Starhaven.\n\nThis conflicts with Saint Ninian, a 4th C saint best known for his role in the Christianizing of Scotland, who has his own entry in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica under the header Ninian, St. The article \"Divided by Sea but Joined by Kin\" (in Isle of Man Family History Society Journal, vol. 2, no. 2, April 1980) states that \"St. Ninian... appears in an early record as Mancennus which probably means that he was of Manx blood...\".\n\nTherefore, Saint Ninian was known by a Latin name that meant Ninian of Man. As we protect historical personal names in all of the forms in which they commonly appear, this form of his name is protected as well.\n\nSharif 'Abd al-Salam ibn Salah. Name.\n\nThis name has several problems. Sharif was documented as a given name found in Azieza Hamid's The Book of Muslim Names. However, no evidence could be found that Sharif was used as a given name in period.\n\nAdditionally, Sharif is a title. Al-Jamal states \"[t]he title sharif is used by the real descendants of the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima's son Hasan...\" RfS VI.1 states in part:\n\nTitles like Earl and Duke generally may not be used as Society names, even if the title is the submitters legal name. Names documented to have been used in period may be used, even if they were derived from titles, provided there is no suggestion of territorial claim or explicit assertion of rank. For example, Regina the Laundress is acceptable but Regina of Germany is not.\n\nIn any resubmission, evidence must be presented that Sharif was used as a given name in period. Lacking such evidence, it is not registerable as a given name.\n\nThe forms asserted that Shereif was the submitter's legal name, but no documentation of this fact was included as required when submitting a name element under the Legal Name Allowance. Were such documentation provided, Shereif would not be registerable, even under the Legal Name Allowance. Shereif is a variant of Sharif and so is a name that was a title in period, not a personal name. As such, it falls into the same category as Earl and Duke, noted in RfS VI.1 cited above, and is not registerable.\n\nIn any resubmission containing a form of Sharif, evidence must be presented that Sharif was used as a given name in period, or it may not be registered, even under the Legal Name Allowance in the form Sherief.\n\nAs submitted, this name had two given names: Sharif (which was submitted as a given name rather than a title) and 'Abd al-Salam. No evidence has been found for the use of two given names in Arabic. Lacking such evidence, two given names are not registerable in an Arabic name. As the submitter does not allow major changes, we cannot drop one of the given names in order to register this name.\n\nHis armory has been registered under the holding name 'Abd al-Salam of Saint Artemas.\n\nGabriel Ximenez de Malaga. Badge. (Fieldless) A wolf courant argent.\n\nThe badge conflicts with a badge of Isabel the Mad, (Fieldless) A greyhound courant argent, collared vert, for the same reasons stated in the previous return for conflict with this badge in the August 2002 LoAR. The submitter included a copy of e-mail from Isabel the Mad, which gave permission to conflict, but the e-mail was not signed with an actual signature. The Administrative Handbook section IV.C.3 requires a signature to a letter of permission to conflict:\n\nPermission to Conflict - If permission to conflict has been granted, a written statement of permission must be included, signed by the owner of the conflicting item with both Society Name and name used outside the Society. (See Appendix D for a standard form for granting permission to conflict.)\n\nIn this month of \"spoofed\" e-mails courtesy of the computer virus de jour (where the apparent sender of the e-mail was not in fact the real sender of the e-mail) it seems appropriate to reaffirm current precedent on this topic, as stated in the LoAR of November 2001:\n\nUnfortunately, the letter of permission provided is not valid. According to the Administrative Handbook, section IV.C.3, a written statement of permission must be included, signed by the owner of the conflicting item with both Society Name and name used outside the Society. The letter provided was not signed. Note that a signature is not a computer generated line of typescript giving the name of the submitter, it is a handwritten signature or a copy thereof. Perhaps in the future we might wish to consider e-mail headers, or electronic signatures, as valid signatures. However, it is worth noting that neither of these were present in this letter of permission either.\n\nJawar al-Ifriqi. Device. Or, in pale an increscent vert and an Eye of Horus sable all within a bordure vert.\n\nThis submission must be returned for use of an eye of Horus, which is an artistic design incompatible with heraldry and thus unregisterable per RfS VII.2. To quote previous precedent:\n\nThe Eye of Horus is an abstract symbol or combination of symbols whose meaning was not understood by Europeans in the SCA period. Unlike the Eye of Horus, the occasional word or letter found in medieval and Renaissance heraldry were part of the languages and symbolic iconography of Europe. Nor is this symbol a reasonable heraldic depiction of an eye; a heraldic eye is a solid charge where the Eye of Horus is depicted as a thin line. As such, this belongs to the category of artistic designs which are not compatible with heraldry. (LoAR August 2001)\n\nLoch Meadhonach, Shire of. Device. Azure, five plates in annulo within a laurel wreath and a chief embattled Or.\n\nThis submission uses a \"V-shaped\" laurel wreath, which is not a registerable design. Previous precedent notes that \"A laurel wreath should have a round shape, rather than a 'U' or 'V' shape, and they should be completely closed, or almost completely closed, at the top. Laurel wreaths in the shape submitted here have been considered sufficient reason for return in the past.\" (LoAR December 2001, pp. 22-23). Note that while their previous submission, returned in April 2002 for lack of a petition, had an identical blazon, it did not have an identical emblazon. That submission used a standard round laurel wreath. Therefore, this stylistic issue did not arise on that previous submission.\n\nIn addition, we still have not received an acceptable petition of support. We have received a petition which consists of a piece of paper which describes the device being submitted (very accurately and completely) but the signatures are on a separate piece of paper which has been cut off halfway down the sheet and then taped to the description paper. As noted in the LoAR of November 2001, \"As with real-world petitions, the signatures should be on the same piece of paper as a clear description of the item being supported by the petition.\" You wouldn't want your bank to cash a check which had a snipped separate piece of paper with the signature taped onto the check - the same principle applies here.\n\nLastly, Administrative Handbook section IV.C.5 states \"In the case of branches with no ruling noble, this support may be demonstrated by a petition of a majority of the populace and officers or by a petition of the seneschal and at least three-quarters of the other local officers.\" The signatures provided here do not indicate which (if any) officers have signed the petition. As a result it is difficult to determine if a majority of the populace and officers - or the seneschal and at least three-quarters of the other local officers - have signed the signature list. The format of the petition is also unclear about whether the signatures shows both SCA and real names of the submitters - or just SCA names. It is thus hard to determine how many people have signed the petition.\n\nThorfinnr Hrafnahamaringr. Name change from holding name Thorfinn of Deodar.\n\nNo documentation was presented, and none was found, that Hrafnahamaringr is a reasonable byname in Old Norse. This element was documented from Academy of Saint Gabriel Report 390 (http://www.s-gabriel.org/390). This report was written in 1997 and is one of the older Academy reports. A warning has been added to the top that states, \"Some of the Academy's early reports contain errors that we haven't yet corrected. Please use it with caution.\" Regarding the submitted byname, this report states:\n\nIf you're attached to the word \"ravenhammer\" and don't care about what it actually means, there is a way to use it. \"hamarr\" was a word for \"a hammer-shaped crag, a crag standing out like an anvil.\" It's common in place names throughout Iceland and Norway. \"Hrafn\" is also found in placenames in the same area. Thus, it would be possible to create a place-name \"Hrafnahamarr,\" or \"raven's crag.\" You could be \"Thorfinnr at Hrafnahamri,\" which means \"Thorfinn at Raven's Crag.\" You could also use the name \"Thorfinnr Hrafnahamaringr,\" which translates roughly as \"Thorfinn Ravencragger.\"\n\nThis report contains no indication regarding where the information given above was found. Additionally, there is no indication that the element hamarr appeared in placenames in period. Given both of these issues, the submitted report is not sufficient to support Hrafnahamaringr as a plausible period byname in Old Norse.\n\nAuguste Valason. Name.\n\nThe College only found one example of the name Auguste dated close to period. Aryanhwy merch Catmael's article \"French Names from 1601\" (http://www.ellipsis.cx/~liana/names/french1601.html) lists the name August as appearing once, and the form Auguste as appearing once, in the source document. The College was unable to find any evidence that this name was used in France earlier than this time.\n\nTherefore, this name combines a French given name dated to 1601 with an Old Norse byname. As Valason is documented from Old Norse sources that record names used before approximately 1100, this name has one weirdness for a temporal disparity of greater than 300 years.\n\nThis submission did not provide information regarding the level of contact between French speakers and Old Norse speakers. Depending upon the level of contact between speakers of these languages, combining French and Old Norse in a name is either a weirdness or not registerable. Either status, when combined with the temporal disparity, is cause for return in this name. Therefore, we are declining to rule on whether the combination of French and Old Norse in a name is a weirdness or unregisterable at this time. We would ask the College to consider this issue, that they may offer advice if this combination is submitted in the future.\n\nHis armory has been registered under the holding name Auguste of Ben Dunfirth.\n\nEaldormere, Kingdom of. Award name change to Award of the Orion from Award of Orion.\n\nNo forms were received for this name submission.\n\nAdditionally, a change from Award of Orion to Award of the Orion changes the structure of this name and requires documentation supporting Award of the Orion as a plausible order name following a period pattern as required by RfS III.2.b.ii, which states that \"Names of orders and awards must follow the patterns of the names of period orders and awards.\" No such documentation was submitted.\n\nGina il Castello del Drago. Device. Or, perched atop a visored helm a dragon statant purpure.\n\nThe College uniformly had difficulty identifying the sort of helm depicted in the emblazon. None of the members of the College felt that this depicted a visored helm, and were not able to identify a type of helm which resembled this emblazon (although the helm incorporates some design elements which may be seen in various sorts of period helmets.) Without documentation for this helmet, this must be returned for violating RfS VII.3, \"Period Artifacts\", which states that \"Artifacts that were known in the period and domain of the Society may be registered in armory, provided they are depicted in their period forms.\"\n\nThe College also felt strongly that the dragon on the helm was not identifiable as a dragon. This must therefore be returned for violating RfS VII.7.a, which states that \"Elements must be recognizable solely from their appearance.\"\n\nNote that this submitter's name was returned in March 2003. Any armory resubmission will need to be accompanied with another name submission.\n\nLachlan MacLean. Device. Azure, six daggers conjoined at the pommels points outwards proper within an orle Or.\n\nThe device conflicts with Kilic ibn Sungur ibn al-Kazganci al-Turhani, Sable, a sheaf of five swords argent within an orle Or. There is one CD for changing the field. Normally, there would be a CD for changing the orientation of the swords, from points to chief to points outwards. However, the visual similarity between these two agglomerations of swords is too strong to give a second CD per RfS X.5. The fact that the hilts on Lachlan's armory are all in the center, and the ones in Kilic's armory are all in base, would give difference for sword posture if the emblazons were drawn correctly. However, in both of these emblazons, the sword hilts are visually insignificant. Thus, these two groups of swords appear to be groups of pointed sticks argent conjoined in the center (six and ten sticks, respectively). There is not enough visual difference between these two groups to consider the armory clear under X.5."
