        "text": "Srinagar, Oct 19 : In a significant development, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, VK Saxena, has given approval for a substantial increase in the Adhoc Monthly Relief (AMR) for Kashmiri migrant families residing in the national capital. The relief amount has been raised by a staggering 170%, from the previous Rs 10,000 per month to a substantial Rs 27,000 per month.\n\nThis decision as per News Agency Kashmir Scroll comes after a long gap of 14 years since the last increase in 2007 when the amount was doubled from its original value of Rs 5,000 per family. The initial relief rate had been established back in 1995, and this recent hike aims to address the changing economic circumstances faced by Kashmiri migrant families living in Delhi.\n\nAn official told News Agency Kashmir Scroll that to ensure transparency and streamline the process, officials have declared that Aadhaar seeding of data for eligible family members will be mandatory for availing the AMR.\n\nHe said, the relief payment will now be facilitated exclusively through the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System, enhancing efficiency and reducing potential loopholes.\n\nAs per data available with New Agency Kashmir Scroll, around 2,000 families receive the AMR in Delhi, with the monthly expenditure incurred for this purpose amounting to Rs 2.5 crore.(KS)"
