Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena has approved a major increase in the Adhoc Monthly Relief (AMR) granted to Kashmiri migrant families living in the national capital. This decision sees the monthly relief shoot up from a sum of ₹10,000 to ₹27,000. This initiative comes as an effort to ease the financial burdens on these families who fled their homes during the insurgency in the Kashmir valley.

Updated AMR Scheme

The updated AMR, an improvement of nearly 170%, comes after a gap of about 16 years. Earlier in 2007, the allowance was doubled to ₹10,000 per family from the initial ₹5,000 that was set in 1995. This relief is dispensed under the central government’s Security Related Expenditure (Relief & Rehabilitation) Scheme. As part of the scheme, aid is provided to families adversely affected by the militancy.

The ₹27,000 aid package is broken down into a payment of ₹3,250 per person per month, capped at a maximum of four individuals in a family. The Government of NCT of Delhi contributes ₹1,000 out of this sum, while ₹2,250 is borne by the Government of India, with the expenses recouped by the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs).

An important stipulation added to this provision is that family members eligible for AMR must complete their Aadhaar seeding process. Deliverance of the aid will be done exclusively through the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System.

The Beneficiaries

Officials have declared that nearly 2,000 families based in Delhi are the recipients of the AMR. This has led to a monthly outflow of approximately ₹2.5 crore from the government’s coffers. However, the number of beneficiaries is predicted to surge by roughly 70% with an increment in the number of family members or “units”.

“AMR is provided to the J&K migrants under the “Security Related Expenditure (Relief & Rehabilitation)” introduced by the Central Government in 1989-90, for supporting the relief and rehabilitation of those who were uprooted from the Kashmir valley during the militancy. In Delhi, AMR is provided to the migrant families registered by GNCTD during 1990-93.” – Official Statement
