        "text": "Inaugural Address. “Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.”\n\nMessage to Chairman Khrushchev Concerning the Meaning of Events in Cuba. “While refraining from military intervention in Cuba, the people of the United States do not conceal their admiration for Cuban patriots who wish to see a democratic system in an independent Cuba. The United States government can take no action to stifle the spirit of liberty.”\n\nIn Address before American Society of Newspaper Editors, addresses the Cuban fiasco. “. . . we will not accept Mr. Castro's attempts to blame this nation for the hatred which his onetime supporters now regard his repression.”. . . “We dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deeper struggle. We dare not fail to grasp the new concepts, the new tools, the new sense of urgency we will need to combat it--whether in Cuba or South Viet-Nam.”\n\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress, Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs. Speaks at length about confronting “adversaries of freedom” at home and abroad. Calls for increased defense spending and spending on civil defense. Concludes with a call for landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth before the end of the decade.\n\nRemarks Upon Signing the Housing Act. “This bill is the most important and far-reaching Federal legislation in the field of housing since the enactment of the Housing Act of 1949.”\n\nNews Conference, Among other topics, discusses talks in Geneva, which the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom adjourned on 01/29/1962 after attempting to reach an agreement on a nuclear test ban. No agreement was reached.\n\nRemarks following the flight of John Glenn who orbited earth in the Friendship 7. “. . . this is the new ocean, and I believe the United States must sail on it and be in a position second to none.”\n\nAddress to the American People on Nuclear Testing and Disarmament. In a nationally broadcast address, discusses Soviet resumption of nuclear tests and announces that the US will conduct a series of tests, both underground and in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. The tests are necessary to assure that the Soviets do not achieve nuclear superiority.\n\nIn a News Conference, criticizes at length, in what became known as “jawboning,” a proposed increase in steel prices. “. . . the American people will find it hard, as I do, to accept a situation in which a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility can show such utter contempt for the interests of 185 million Americans.” A few days later the steel companies reversed course.\n\nThe Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) adopt what is known as the “Port Huron Statement.” The SDS becomes a leader in anti-war, anti-capitalist protest. “. . . we seek the establishment of a democracy of individual participation governed by two central aims: that the individual share in those social decisions determining the quality and direction of his life; that society be organized to encourage independence in men and provide the media for their common participation.”\n\nFollowing considerable litigation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Meredith v. Fair held that Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett was in contempt of court for blocking the registration of an African-American student, James Meredith at the University of Mississippi.\n\nBy Proclamation, directs Mississippi officials to comply with court orders. By Executive Order directs the Secretary of Defense to take all appropriate steps to enforce the court order. And in a televised address to the nation, explains his actions. He states, “Neither Mississippi nor any other southern State deserves to be charged with all the accumulated wrongs of the last 100 years of race relations.”\n\nReport to the American People on the Soviet Arms buildup in Cuba. In a televised speech, reveals that he has received “unmistakable evidence” of offensive missile sites in Cuba. Accuses the Soviets of deliberate deception. Announces that a strict quarantine on shipping offensive weapons to Cuba.\n\nIn George Wallace’s Inaugural Address as Governor of Alabama, he proclaims, “Let us rise to the call of freedom-loving blood that is in us and send our answer to the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the South. In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny. . .[sic]and I say. . .segregation now . . . segregation tomorrow. . .segregation forever.”\n\nIn Gideon v. Wainwright, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of right to counsel applies to criminal defendants in state courts because of the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nJailed for his role in the Birmingham demonstrations, Martin Luther King writes his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.”\n\nDelivers Commencement Address at American University, where he speaks about establishing a nuclear test ban treaty and announces his sincere desire to make peace with the Soviet Union. The speech leads to an effort to increase communication between the two nations.\n\nThrough Executive Order, directs the Secretary of Defense to insure the integration of the University of Alabama. This was pursuant to a Proclamation of the same date commanding the Governor of Alabama to cease undermining the laws and the Constitution of the United States.

It cannot be met by repressive police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is a time to act in the Congress. . . “\n\nStatement about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. At the 250,000-strong march advocating for rights for African Americans, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers his “I Have a Dream Speech.” Activists meet with Kennedy to urge him to take action on reform.\n\nPresident Diem of Vietnam is deposed in a coup and later executed. The US government knew of the planned coup but did not attempt to stop it, apparently not foreseeing that Diem would be killed.\n\nRemarks at the Breakfast of the Forth Worth Chamber of Commerce. “. . . on three occasions in the last 3 years the United States has had a direct confrontation. No one can say when it will come again. No one expects that our life will be easy, certainly not in this decade, and perhaps not in this century.”"
