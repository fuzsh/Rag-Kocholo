        "text": "The following is a timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy from January 1, 1963, to November 22, 1963, upon his assassination and death.\n\nJanuary 10 – President Kennedy meets with President-elect Juan Bosch of the Dominican Republic.\n\nJanuary 11 – President Kennedy meets with Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz and AFL–CIO President George Meany.\n\nJanuary 12 – President Kennedy announces the appointment of David L. Lawrence as Chairman of the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing. Kennedy also appoints Phil N. Bornstein as Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\nJanuary 14 – President Kennedy delivers his third (and final) State of the Union address.\n\nJanuary 31 – President Kennedy selects Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. for United States Undersecretary of Commerce.[1] RFK denies government pressure is preventing Teamster union officials from getting their required bonds.[2] President Kennedy sends a message to Capitol Hill for the government to pay the cotton trade to increase sales of domestic cotton alongside the government paying the feed grain and dairy farmers to not produce.[3]\n\nFebruary 10 – The President and the First Lady attend the revue Beyond the Fringe in New York City.\n\nFebruary 20 – In a letter to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, President Kennedy denies clemency to Victor Feguer, a convicted murderer.[4]\n\nMarch 15 – Victor Feguer is executed after Kennedy's February 20 denial of clemency. The execution marks the last federal execution until the execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001.\n\nMarch 18–20 – President Kennedy makes the seventh international trip of his presidency, travelling to San José, Costa Rica, where he attends the Conference of Presidents of the Central American Republics.[5]\n\nJune 10 – President Kennedy delivers the commencement address at American University in Washington, D.C. This was the beginning of a series of speeches JFK made to promote peace with the Soviet Union. In the Peace Speech, JFK broke with tradition in two ways. First, by asking Americans to examine their attitudes toward Russians, and second by speaking about Russians as people, just like us. \"And every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet Union, toward the course of the Cold War and toward freedom and peace here at home... No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements--in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage...We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we all are mortal.\"[6]\n\nJune 11 – President Kennedy delivers the Civil Rights Address in the aftermath of the Birmingham campaign and recent Stand in the Schoolhouse Door incident and further calls for legislation to enact a civil rights bill.\n\nJune 23-July 2 – Kennedy makes the eighth international trip of his presidency.[5]\n\nJune 23–25 – Visits Cologne, Frankfurt, and Wiesbaden, West Germany; also holds meetings with West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and other officials.\n\nJune 26 – Visits West Berlin and delivers his now-famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech advocating representative democracy and capitalism as a replacement for communist regimes around the world.\n\nJune 26–29 – Visits Dublin, Wexford, Cork, Galway, and Limerick, Ireland and visits his ancestral home; also addresses the Oireachtas (parliament).\n\nJune 29–30 – Travels to the United Kingdom for an informal visit with British Harold Macmillan at his home in West Sussex, England.\n\nJuly 1–2 – Travels to Naples and Rome, Italy, where he meets with Italian President Antonio Segni, and NATO officials. Segni paid tribute to JFK for his Peace Speech and JFK reiterated it. Italy was in a hot debate about whether or not to make a center-left coalition with the Socialist Party and the Christian Democrats. The Christian Democrats had received monthly payments from the CIA to make sure communists did not win the elections since 1948, and the CIA was against this. Kennedy was for the center-left coalition, and the CIA undermined him by contradicting what he said to Italian leaders in the days following his visit.[7]\n\nJuly 2 – Has an audience with the newly elected Pope Paul VI at the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City.\n\nJuly 24 – President Kennedy meets with a group of Boys Nation senators, including future U.S. President Bill Clinton, at the White House.[8]\n\nAugust 7 – Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, President and Mrs. Kennedy's third child, is born (five and a half weeks prematurely) at the Otis Air Force Base Hospital in Bourne, Massachusetts.

Kennedy Memorial Highway a month later following his assassination.[16] On this same day, JFK privately informed Lyndon Johnson that he was not going to be vice president on the ticket. He told his secretary, Evelyn Lincoln that \"he needed a vice president \"who believes as I do.\"[17]\n\nNovember 18 – President Kennedy travels to Tampa, Florida.
