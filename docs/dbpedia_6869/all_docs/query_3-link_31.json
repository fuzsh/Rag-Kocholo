        "text": "The Cuban missile crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union closer to nuclear war than any other event during the Cold War. President John F.

In a memoir published one year after his assassination, Robert Kennedy reveals the inner workings of the ExCom as it worked to avert nuclear war.\n\nDanger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First Fifty Years (1988).

Ted Sorensen, Kennedy’s speechwriter and one of his closest advisers, devotes a chapter to Kennedy’s decisions during the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nScholars and journalists have explored the crisis in great depth. Here are some of the best:\n\nEssence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis (1971, 1999). Harvard University professor Graham Allison wrote the classic political science study of the Cuban missile crisis in 1971, which he updated after the end of the cold war with the help of University of Virginia professor Philip Zelikow. Essence of Decision is one of the best-selling political science books of all time, and it remains a must-read for students of international relations and political science.\n\nOne Hell of a Gamble: Khrushchev, Castro, and Kennedy, 1958-1964 (1998). Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali explore the Soviet side of the crisis, using internal Kremlin documents to explore the Soviet leadership’s decision-making process throughout the crisis.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962: A National Security Archive Documents Reader (1999). Laurence Chang and Peter Kornbluh offer up a blow-by-blow account of the crisis using declassified government documents from before, during, and after the crisis.\n\nAverting ’The Final Failure’: John F. Kennedy and the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis Meetings (2003). Sheldon M. Stern, an historian with more than two decades of service at the Kennedy Presidential Library, surveys the crisis through the ExCom meetings, highlighting what individual officials did as well as the broader themes that emerged during the crisis.\n\nOne Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War (2008). Michael Dobbs, a long-time foreign correspondent for the Washington Post, describes the series of near-misses and almost-catastrophes that illustrate just how close the world came to nuclear war.\n\nThe Armageddon Letters: Kennedy, Khruschev, Castro in the Cuban Missile Crisis (2012). James Blight and Janet Lang dramatize the crisis through the letters that Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro wrote, and in doing so highlight the role that the Cubans played in the crisis.\n\nThe Fourteenth Day: JFK and the Aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis (2012). David Coleman looks beyond the agreement that Kennedy and Khrushchev struck on October 28, 1962 to remove Soviet missiles in Cuba and examines the challenges JFK confronted in making sure that the deal was in fact carried out.\n\nTwo movies have been filmed about the Cuban missile crisis. The Missiles of October , which was released in 1974 and stars William Devane and Ralph Bellamy among others, was based on Robert Kennedy’s posthumous memoir, Thirteen Days. Hollywood’s first crack at the Cuban missile crisis was shot on video tape to give it a “you-are-there crispness,” but it misses some of the crisis’s critical events because they weren’t known at the time the film was shot. Thirteen Days, which was released in 2000 and starred Kevin Costner, has more of a big-budget Hollywood feel. Although it is based on more recent scholarship, the movie has some historical inaccuracies. University of Virginia historian and Cuban missile crisis expert Philip Zelikow says, however, that it is “accurate where it counts.”\n\nMore on:\n\nUnited States\n\nNonproliferation, Arms Control, and Disarmament\n\nIf you don’t trust how Hollywood portrays the events of October 1962, you can take advantage of one of the things that makes the Cuban missile crisis so unusual, and so attractive to scholars and journalists: President Kennedy secretly taped the meetings he had with his advisers in the White House. Almost none of his advisers knew that their remarks were being taped, so we have a frank, fly-on-the-wall view of their deliberations. Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow collected the transcripts of the secret tapes in The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis (2002). You can listen to audio clips of the meetings online at the National Security Archive.\n\nPBS commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis by airing two sixty-minute special programs: The Cuban Missile Crisis: Three Men Go to War and Secrets of the Dead: “The Man Who Saved the World”, both of which debuted on October 23, 2012.\n\nThe Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard created a website to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary. The website offers historical context for the crisis, including information on the people involved, primary documents, and lessons learned.\n\nThe National Security Archive at the George Washington University commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the crisis by creating a website that includes declassified documents, audio clips, photographs, and chronologies."
