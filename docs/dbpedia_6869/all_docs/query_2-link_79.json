        "text": "The Supreme Court rules (by 9-0 vote in New York Times v. Sullivan) that freedom of speech limited the ability of public figures from suing the press for libel. This decision was reached after the police commissioner of Montgomery sued the New York Times for libel after publishing a piece with factual errors.\n\nRemarks to a Group of Civil Rights Leaders. ”. . . laws and government are, at best, coarse instruments for remolding social institutions or illuminating the dark places of the human heart. . . [or] the thousands of incidents of discrimination and hatred which give the lie to what is learned there in the classroom.”\n\nCongress passes the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution—which extended the wartime powers of the US President. \"Congress approves and supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression.\"\n\nRemarks in Oklahoma. “We don't want our American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys. We don't want to get involved in a nation with 700 million people and get tied down in a land war in Asia.”\n\nStatement by the President on the Situation in Selma, Alabama. “I am certain Americans everywhere join in deploring the brutality with which a number of Negro citizens of Alabama were treated when they sought to dramatize their deep and sincere interest in attaining the precious right to vote.”\n\nPresident’s News Conference. “The promise of America is a simple promise: Every person shall share in the blessings of this land. And they shall share on the basis of their merits as a person. They shall not be judged by their color or by their beliefs, or by their religion, or by where they were born, or the neighborhood in which they live.”\n\nSpecial Message to the Congress on the Right to Vote. “. . . eight years of litigation has made it clear that the prompt and fair registration of qualified Negro citizens cannot be achieved under present legislation in the face of consistent defiance of the laws of Congress or the command of the Constitution.”\n\nSpecial Message to Congress: \"We Shall Overcome.\" In a televised address, Johnson spoke of the need for equal rights. “This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose. The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: \"All men are created equal\"--\"government by consent of the governed\"--\"give me liberty or give me death.\" Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories. In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives.”\n\nAddress at Johns Hopkins University: “Peace Without Conquest.” Pledges to honor the commitments of prior presidents to the people of South Vietnam, but will engage in “unconditional discussion” of peace. Promises a vast economic development program for all of Vietnam if “peaceful cooperation” can be achieved. This was widely seen as a shift in US policy.\n\nThe Watts Race Riots break out in the Watts Neighborhood and the surrounding Los Angeles Area. This occurred after a 21-year-old African American man was arrested and rumors spread that the police kicked a pregnant woman during the confrontation. The incident caused over forty million dollars in damages and forced the National Guard to send 14,000 troops to suppress the violence.\n\nRemarks on Signing the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act (HEA) was to increase resources for colleges and universities and provide financial aid to students pursuing postsecondary education. The HEA promotes access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic background. it governs student-aid programs, federal assistance to colleges, and oversight of teacher training. Subject to reauthorization every five years.\n\nTwenty-Fifth Amendment is ratified, clarifying that if the president dies, resign, or is removed from office, then the vice president would fill his vacancy. If the office of vice president becomes vacant, the President may appoint a new vice president.\n\nThe Supreme Court rules 9-0 in Loving v. Virginia that anti- miscegenation laws in Virginia were unconstitutional because they violated the 14th Amendment. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\"\n\nFollowing criticism of the Vietnam War, domestic unrest, and Robert Kennedy’s campaign announcement, President Johnson reveals in a nationally televised address that he will not run for reelection. Announces unilateral halt to military action north of the demilitarized zone and a willingness to enter peace talks with the North Vietnamese.\n\nIn the Mexico City Olympics, Americans John Carlos and Tommie Smith win the Gold and Bronze medals for the 200-meter dash. They both raise their fists during the national anthem in protest against violence and inequality against African-Americans. The following day, both men were stripped of their Olympic medals and sent home."
