Also includes an index to Volumes I - XV.\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolumes XVI—XXVI - These volumes contain reproductions of exhibits received into evidence by the Commission. The exhibits received in connection with testimony before the Commission are printed first, arranged in numerical order from 1 to 1053. Next are printed exhibits received in connection with depositions or affidavits, arranged alphabetically by name of witness, and then numerically— e.g., Adams Exhibits Nos. 1-, Baker Exhibits Nos. 1-22. Finally are printed other materials relied upon by the Commission, consisting principally of investigative reports by law enforcement agencies, arranged in numerical order beginning with 1054. Each volume begins with a table of contents—a descriptive listing of the exhibits in the volume and the page or pages on which each exhibit is printed.\n\nThe numbering of the exhibits received in testimony before the Commission is not completely consecutive; the unused numbers are noted in the table of contents. Also, various systems of designation were used in connection with deposition and affidavit exhibits, so that the designation of some of these exhibits begins either with a letter or a number higher than 1—e.g., Jones Exhibits A-C, Smith Exhibits Nos. 5000-5006.\n\nAlmost all of the reproductions contained in the exhibit volumes consist of photographs of the exhibits. The legibility of many documentary exhibits is poor, because some exhibits were copies rather than originals and many others were discolored when tested for fingerprints. In some cases where legibility was particularly bad, the contents of the document have been typed out, and reproduced together with a miniature photograph of the exhibit. A few exhibits of negligible relevance were not reproduced because of their length or for reasons of taste. The omissions are described in the tables of contents. In a very small number of cases, names, dates, or numbers have been deleted from exhibits for security reasons or for the protection of named individuals.\n\nVolume XVI - Exhibits 1 to 391\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XVII - Exhibits 329 to 884\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XVIII - Exhibits 885 to 1053\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XIX - Exhibits Allen to Fuqua\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XX - Exhibits Gallagher to Oliver\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXI - Exhibits Paine to Yarborough\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXII - Exhibits 1054 to 1512\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXIII - Exhibits 1513 to 1975\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXIV - Exhibits 1976 to 2189\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXV - Exhibits 2190 to 2651\n\nPDF Details\n\nVolume XXVI - Exhibits 2652 to 3154\n\nPDF Details\n\nOther Related Resources\n\nPrinting of the eulogies to the late President John F.
