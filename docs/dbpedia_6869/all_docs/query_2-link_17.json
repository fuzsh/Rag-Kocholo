        "text": "Pres. John F. Kennedy believed that his Republican opponent in the 1964 U.S. presidential election would be Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Kennedy was convinced that he could bury Goldwater under an avalanche of votes. One obstacle to his success was a feud in Vice Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson’s home state of Texas between Gov. John B. Connally, Jr., and Sen. Ralph Yarborough, both Democrats. To present a show of unity, Kennedy decided to tour the state with both men. Kennedy began the tour—with his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Johnson—on November 21, 1963, in San Antonio, with visits to Houston and Forth Worth that same day. The next day they flew to Dallas. While Kennedy was riding in an open limousine in downtown Dallas on his way to give a speech, he was shot and killed. (Connally was also gravely wounded; however, he recovered.) Although Kennedy did not survive to see the presidential election of 1964, his prediction was correct: Goldwater did, in fact, run for president."
