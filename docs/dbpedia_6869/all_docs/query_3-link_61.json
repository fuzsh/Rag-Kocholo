        "text": "WASHINGTON -- It could have been the start of a war the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nFilms and history books have documented the the hair's-width margin that separated the United States and the Soviet Union from nuclear conflict during 13 days in October 1962, the height of the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nBut a speech drafted by U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and newly released to the public, throws what may be the starkest light yet on just how close the sides came to starting World War III.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, with a heavy heart, and in necessary fulfillment of my oath of office, I have ordered -- and the United States Air Force has now carried out -- military operations with conventional weapons only, to remove a major nuclear weapons build-up from the soil of Cuba,\" Kennedy was to begin.\n\nThis speech is the highlight of an archive containing nearly 3,000 pages of notes, transcripts, and other documents kept by Robert Kennedy, the president's brother and close adviser.\n\nIt was posted online by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum last week to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the crisis.\n\nThe newly released material offers a fascinating glimpse of the limited options open to the U.S. leader during the tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n\"What this document reminds us, vividly, is that if President Kennedy had felt forced to choose what to do in the first 48 or 72 hours after the U.S. discovered the Soviet Union sneaking nuclear-tipped missiles into Cuba, he would have conducted an air strike on those missiles, as the speech tries to justify,\" says Graham Allison, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University and an expert on the Cuban missile crisis.\n\n\"We would have the seen the chain of events that would have initiated. Down that path we would have come to nuclear war.\"\n\nNail-Biting Diplomacy\n\nKennedy's speech, of course, was never delivered. The U.S. leader instead enacted a naval blockade of Cuba and as the world held its breath, the approaching Soviet ships turned back.\n\nBut Kennedy also came close to ordering a strike after the blockade to prevent the missiles that were spotted by the United States from becoming operational.\n\nWATCH: Kennedy announces a naval blockade of Cuba"
