President Joe Biden's administration released some previously classified documents related to the assassination in December of last year and a second batch is set to be released on December 15 of this year.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nIn conjunction with the anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, here's a rundown of the most important moments from that day:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday, November 22, 1963, 12:30 a.m.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald and his wife Marina are not living together. While Oswald lives in a boarding house at 1026 N. Beckley Ave. in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Texas, Marina Oswald is living with Ruth Paine in Irving, Texas.\n\nUnlike most weeks, Lee has showed up on Thursday evening instead of Friday evening. At 12:30 a.m., Marina notices that Lee is still awake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6:30 a.m.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald gets out of bed after a restless night and gets ready for work. Before he leaves the house, he takes off his wedding ring and leaves it in a cup on top of Marina's dresser. He takes $170 out of his wallet and leaves it with his wedding ring.\n\nHe gets a ride into work at the Texas School Book Depository with Buell Wesley Fraizer. He is carrying something long and tells Fraizer they're curtain rods for his room in the boarding house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7 a.m.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy is at the Hotel Texas getting ready for his day. He will give a speech outside the hotel, give a speech to the Chamber of Commerce inside, and then leave Fort Worth for Dallas.\n\nAfter a motorcade through Dallas and a speech at the Trade Mart, the Kennedy's will travel with the Johnson's to Austin and then to the Johnson Ranch for a weekend of rest.\n\nKennedy has just picked up The Dallas Morning News. He sees the infamous \"black border\" ad which accusing him of treason. He also sees a prediction from Richard Nixon that Kennedy will be dropping Johnson from the ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10 a.m.\n\nAs the weather starts clearing up, advance secret service agent Win Lawson has decided to take the bubbletop off the presidential limo.\n\nKennedy has made it clear that he wants to be accessible to the people. He wants the bubbletop off as much as possible and does not want secret service agents on the back on his limo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nKennedy returns to his suite in the Hotel Texas and prepares to leave for Dallas. He remarks to Jackie \"you know, last night would have been a hell of a night to assassinate a president\" in reference to their late night motorcade through Fort Worth.\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nMultiple co-workers see Oswald on the first floor of the book depository eating lunch. Simultaneously, the motorcade leaves Love Field to begin the motorcade through Dallas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nKennedy makes his first of many stops to shake hands with groups of people waiting to meet him, delaying the motorcade by five minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:29 p.m.\n\nThe president's limo turns onto Elm Street. The first shot is fired, missing the president.\n\nA fragment from the bullet or debris from the street hit James Tauge, who is watching the motorcade in Dealey Plaza.\n\nA man is standing near the Stemmons Freeway sign with an opened umbrella, giving rise to the \"umbrella man\" conspiracy theory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe second shot is fired, causing Kennedy to go into Thornburn's position. This is a common neurological response to spinal damage.\n\nThe third shot is fired, hitting the president on the back, right side of his head, causing a portion of his head behind his right ear to blow out. Right after the third shot is fired, Sheriff Bill Decker orders Dallas police officers to the railroad tracks behind the fence on the Grassy Knoll.\n\nOswald gets a Coca Cola from the soda machine in the book depository and starts walking out of the buildings after being stopped briefly by Dallas police officer Marrion Baker. Oswald walks past NBC's Robert MacNeil, who is looking for a phone to call in the shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nThe presidential limo arrives at Parkland Memorial Hospital where \"24740, white male\" suffering from a gunshot wound is admitted and brought to trauma room 1.\n\nSecret service agent Roy Kellerman, who is in charge in Dallas, calls the head of secret service Jerry Behn to report that JFK has been hit.\n\nDr. Charles Crenshaw enters and notes there is a large wound on the back of the president's head as well as a small hole in his throat. They use this hole to perform a tracheotomy in order to open up Kennedy's airway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nOswald gets onto a bus seven blocks from the Texas School Book Depository. The bus isn't moving much because of traffic in Dealey Plaza.\n\nShortly after boarding, he gets off and gets into a cab driven by William H. Whaley, which he takes back to his boarding house where he changes and gets his pistol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12:57 p.m.:\n\nFather Oscar Huber arrives at the hospital. Kennedy aide Ken O'Donnell tells secret service agent Clint Hill to order a casket from somewhere nearby.\n\nThe president is already technically dead, but Jackie is worried about him receiving his Catholic last rites before he has died. Just after Huber performs them, Dr. Kemp Clark pronounces Kennedy dead. Admiral Dr. George Burkley officially pronounces Kennedy dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nAfter being told to patrol the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Officer J.D. Tippit speaks to someone who fits Oswald's description. Shortly after, police hear a civilian on the police radio line saying, \"It's a police officer. Someone shot him.\"\n\n1:26 p.m.\n\nVice President Lyndon B. Johnson leaves Parkland for Air Force One. As he and Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson are leaving, she sees the flags drop to half mast. Assistant White House Press Secretary Mac Kilduff confirms Kennedy's death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nOswald runs into a movie theater that is playing the film \"War is Hell.\" He is seen sneaking in, and police start to search the theater. The lights are raised and officer Nick McDonald spots Oswald in the seats.\n\nMcDonald walks up to Oswald who says, \"This is it!\" and pulls out a revolver. As they fight, officer McDonald gets his finger in front of the pistol's hammer so the gun will not fire. Oswald punches an officer in the face and the officer punches back, giving Oswald a black eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2 p.m.\n\nSecret service agent Roy Kellerman gets into an argument with Dallas Country medical examiner Dr. Earl Rose. The Kennedy party wants his body put in a casket and want to leave the hospital.\n\nAt this point, killing a president is not a federal offense. Because of this, the medical examiner argues that the autopsy has to be performed before the body is taken from Dallas. Johnson orders the body to be released, but the ME refuses. Finally, he is overridden by Dallas district attorney Henry Wade, who only agrees to release the body if Admiral Dr. Burkley, Kennedy's private physician, promises to stay with the body until it is put in the casket for the final time.\n\nSimultaneously, Johnson phones grief-stricken Robert Kennedy, the president's younger brother and the Attorney General, to find out what his legal options are about taking the oath of office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2:07 p.m.\n\nKennedy's body leaves Parkland Hospital bound for Love Field.

I haven't done anything to be ashamed of.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2:38 p.m.\n\nThe president's body has been loaded to Air Force One with much difficulty. The casket they got from the funeral home was too wide for the plane door, and they had to break some of the handles off.\n\nDespite what conspiracy theorists say, the damage to the casket was caused by the secret service, not the casket being opened and the body being altered. Deputy Attorney General Nick Katzenbach spoke to people in Washington to get the correct oath of office.\n\nDespite having trouble reading his writing, he dictates the oath of office and Johnson becomes the 36th president of the United States. He is the first president to be sworn in by a woman, Judge Sarah T. Hughes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3 p.m.\n\nOswald's first interrogation has started. The police take paraffin tests of his hands and face to determine if he has fired a gun. The test of the hands comes back positive. They have only charged him with the killing of Officer Tippit.

Edgar Hoover called RFK to tell him \"we have the man.\"\n\nOswald waits for his first lineup with Helene Markham, the witness to Tippit's murder. While waiting, Oswald is searched and five bullet cartridges are found in his pocket.\n\nJack Ruby, who owns The Carousel Club, stops by the police station for the first time. Since many of the officers frequent the club, he is familiar with quite a few people and is able to walk around the police station freely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nDoctors from trauma room one fill out forms stating what they observed in the emergency room. The conflicting reports from the doctors leads to confusion and distrust.\n\nDr. Marion Jenkins says there was a large hole on the right side of Kennedy's head so large, the cerebellum had protruded from the wound.\n\nDr. James Carrico, the first doctor to enter the trauma room, noted a large wound located in the right occipito-parietal area and one small penetrating wound in the middle of the neck.\n\nDr. Charles Baxter said the right temporal and occipital bones were missing and the brain was on the table. Dr. Kemp Clark, who pronounced Kennedy dead, noted two external wounds.\n\nBoth the cerebral and cerebella tissue were extruding from the wound. Dr. McClelland stated that \"the cause of death was due to a massive head and brain injury from a gunshot wound of the left temple.\" Dr. Marion Jenkins later supported this statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6 p.m. ET\n\nAir Force One arrives at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Among many others, waiting for the plane were Robert Kennedy, Robert McNamara, and General Maxwell Taylor.\n\nJackie Kennedy has requested that the secret service agents who carried her husband onto the plane as well as \"his friends\" carry him off the plane. She has also requested that secret service agent and driver Bill Greer drive the ambulance with the coffin to Bethesda Naval Hospital.\n\nRobert Kennedy has rushed onto the plane to find Jackie. He puts his arm around her and quietly says \"Hi, Jackie. I'm here.\"\n\nWhen they get into the ambulance with the casket, Jackie recounts the motorcade, the shooting, and aftermath in detail to RFK.\n\nLyndon Johnson makes his first statement on TV as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6:20 p.m. CT\n\nOswald's second interrogation starts in Captain Fritz's office.

McWatters says that Oswald was wearing a jacket, though the Warren Commission (which investigated the assassination) said he was not. Also, later when testifying to the Warren Commission, McWatters says he was wrong in selecting Oswald in the lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7 p.m. ET:\n\nJackie Kennedy and Robert Kennedy enter Bethesda Naval Hospital. RFK stops to sign the order for the autopsy of his brother. They are taken to a VIP suite on the 17th floor of the hospital while the autopsy is performed.\n\nGeneral Godfrey McHugh has stopped Admiral Calvin Galloway, who has assembled a team to perform the autopsy. McHugh tells Galloway that the autopsy and embalming should be done by his team and that \"Mrs. Kennedy doesn't want an undertaker.\" Galloway responds, \"We don't have the facilities. I highly recommend a funeral parlor.\" When asked if it's possible, he says, \"It's not impossible. It's difficult though. And it might be unsatisfactory.\"\n\nSargent Shriver, the president's brother-in-law, prepares the White House to receive Kennedy's body and for it to lay in repose. He has covered the building in black bunting and, at the request of Jackie Kennedy, has gotten books and documents so he can make the White House look like it did when Lincoln died and laid in repose in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7:10 p.m. CT:\n\nCaptain Fritz has questioned Marina Oswald, and Ruth and Michael Paine.

Oswald is later arrested and brought back in for questioning.\n\n11 p.m. ET:\n\nAfter it began at 8:15 p.m. under the charge of Commander J.J. Humes, Kennedy's autopsy is concluded.
