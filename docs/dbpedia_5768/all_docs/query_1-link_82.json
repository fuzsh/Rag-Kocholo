        "text": "1 Success. 2006's Back to Black led to six Grammy Award nominations and five wins, tying the record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night. Winehouse was the first British singer to scoop five Grammy Awards.\n\n2 Depression. She was a diagnosed manic depressive, yet refused to take medication.\n\nIn pictures: Amy Winehouse\n\nThe life and times of Amy Winehouse\n\n3 Luck. Winehouse wanted to get married in Las Vegas and see the dancing girls there but not to go gambling, \"Because I'm not very lucky,\" she said.\n\n4 No sugar-coating. As a guest on TV programmes including Never Mind the Buzzcocks and chat shows hosted by Charlotte Church and Russell Brand she always gave as good as she got. A platform where clever men usually outwit each other and female guests can sometimes struggle to be heard, she was always on form. When asked if she'd like to work with Katie Melua, she replied: \"I'd rather have cat Aids, thank you.\"\n\n5 A musician's muse. In 2008, Bryan Adams wrote a song for Winehouse, Flower Grown Wild, after he let her stay at his Caribbean home over a New Year break. It was a specific warning to the troubled singer that her addictive ways were a flirtation with death. Winehouse was said to be so touched by the song, she agreed to perform it with Adams on his tour later that year — a promise, like so many in her tragically abbreviated career, that was never kept.\n\n6 Unique art. Her old school tattoos of naked women. Never one to stick within the \"limits of society\" Winehouse embraced art in her own unique way.\n\n7 Movie life-saver. The cover she did of Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow for Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was about the only thing which made the film bearable.\n\n8 Real music. Her songs were her true autobiography. Songs such as You Know I'm No Good and Love is a Losing Game provide as good an insight into Winehouse's life as any book could offer.\n\n9 Humble. Mark Ronson, the producer responsible for bringing out so many of the great moments on Back to Black, said of Winehouse: \"She doesn't want to be lavished. She doesn't want people gushing over her. She just can't get anything out of it — even on the day her own album goes platinum.\"\n\n10 Fashion icon. Winehouse's distinctive style made her a muse for fashion designers such as Karl Lagerfeld. At London Fashion Week in 2007, ladies with beehives in every shape and height strutted down the catwalk in Amy-style clothing. Lagerfeld said: \"She is a beautiful, gifted artist. And I very much like her hairdo. I took it as an inspiration. Because, in fact, it was also Brigitte Bardot's hairdo in the late '50s and '60s. And now Amy has made it her own style.\"\n\n11 Early signs of stardom. Aged 10, Winehouse founded a short-lived rap group called Sweet ‘n' Sour. \"I was sour, of course,\" she said.\n\n12 Loyal. Winehouse stood by Blake Fielder-Civil, who was arrested for an attack on a pub manager, throughout his trial, often blowing kisses at him from the court's public gallery and wearing a heart-shaped pin labelled \"Blake\" in her hair at concerts. They divorced in 2009.\n\n13 insecure. \"I'm a musician; I'm not a model,\" she said on her 2007 concert DVD, I Told You I Was Trouble. \"The more insecure I felt, the more I'd drink. The more insecure I feel, the bigger my hair has to be.\"\n\n14 Blunt as a spoon. Winehouse was famously blunt in her assessment of her peers, once describing Dido's (below) sound as \"background music — the background to death\" and saying of pop princess Kylie Minogue, \"she's not an artist ... she's a pony\".\n\n15 Hair hive. She made the beehive fashionable again. Fans around the world followed suit and for a number of years it wasn't just a style recreated for fancy dress parties.\n\n16 Strong eyes. Eye make-up will never be the same again. The strong, sweeping black eye flicks were reinvented and haven't died a death just yet.\n\n17 Legs. What skirt? Who will ever forget those micro-mini skirts?\n\n18 That smokey voice. Winehouse often won comparison with some of the great female singers such as Sarah Vaughan and Nina Simone.\n\n19 Honest. Back To Black, which sold 1.85 million copies in 2007 alone, detailed her split from Blake Fielder-Civil, describing, in the title track, how his abandonment of her had led to depression. In her most famous song, Rehab, she sang of drinking so heavily that people \"tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no\".\n\n20 All that jazz. Winehouse was discovered while performing with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra and signed to a division of 19 Management, the media empire of Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller, which led to her being signed by Island Records. NYJO — we owe you big time!\n\n21 Sell out to fall out. Even during her 2007 US tour, which was marred by shambolic performances as she staggered around the stage, too drunk to remember her own lyrics, Winehouse still sold out giant concert arenas. The pattern continued: more performances, more forgotten lyrics… but people still came, including her performance Dubai in February.\n\n22 Rock bottom. Last month, she was booed off the stage during her first show in Belgrade. The tour was cancelled and Winehouse was packed off to The Priory, a rehab facility.\n\n23 An inspiration to others. British singer Adele credits Winehouse's success in the US for making her and fellow British singer Duffy's journey to the US \"a bit smoother\". American singer Lady Gaga credited Winehouse with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts. She appeared to be using a metaphorical analogy to explain that Winehouse made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success.\n\n24 More to come. American singer Tony Bennett (below) picked Winehouse and several other artists to duet with him on his forthcoming album Duets II, which is scheduled for release on September 20. So we haven't heard the last of her yet.\n\n25 good cause. Winehouse joined a campaign to stop a block of flats being built beside the George Tavern, a famous London East End music venue. Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot's lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive. In 2008, as part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April issue of Easy Living magazine.\n\n26 Style. Winehouse collaborated on a 17-piece fashion collection with the Fred Perry label, which was released for sale in October 2010. The collection consists of \"vintage-inspired\" looks including capri pants, a bowling dress, a trench coat, pencil skirts, a long-line argyle sweater and a pink-and-black checkerboard-printed collared shirt."
