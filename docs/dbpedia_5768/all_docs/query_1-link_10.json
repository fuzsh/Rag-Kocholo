        "text": "Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 â€“ 23 July 2011) was an English singer and songwriter. She was known for her deep, expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, rhythm and blues and jazz.\n\nA member of the National Youth Jazz Orchestra during her youth, Winehouse's influences were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and soon recorded a number of songs before signing a publishing deal with EMI. She also formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, was released in 2003. Produced mainly by Remi, many of the album's songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, were co-written by Winehouse.\n\nFrank was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The song \"Stronger Than Me\" won her the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. Winehouse's follow-up album, Back to Black (2006), was an international success. At the 2007 Brit Awards it was nominated for British Album of the Year, and she received the award for British Female Solo Artist. The song \"Rehab\" won her a second Ivor Novello Award. At the 50th Grammy Awards in 2008, she won five awards, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night and becoming the first British woman to win five Grammys, including three of the General Field \"Big Four\" Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (for \"Rehab\"), as well as Best Pop Vocal Album..."
