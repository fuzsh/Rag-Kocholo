        "text": "11 years after her death people are still talking about Amy Winehouse and how much of a loss it was to the music industry as a whole. The story of Amy Winehouse is a tough one with many focusing on the ugly aspect of her life and career, however through the darkness there is still so much that should be celebrated, wether it be the records that she broke within the music industry, or the multitude of other artists she would go on to inspire for the past 15+ years. In this article we take a look back at the life and career of the late, great, and forever missed Amy Winehouse.\n\n*Important Note: I will only be covering Amy Winehouse’s music career and backstory that is directly involved with her music.\n\nA Little Girl With A Dream In London:\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse was born on September 14th, 1983, in Enfield London England. She had a father named Mitchell Winehouse, a mother named Janis Winehouse, and an older brother named Alex Winehouse. She would grow up in a Jewish household although she would go on to say in interviews later in life that she wasn't a practicing Jew. Her parents would go on to divorce when Winehouse was 9 years old.\n\nWinehouse would go on to say that she developed her love of music at a young age from her grandmother being a singer back in the day and showing her a wide variety of Jazz music. Her love of Jazz would only get stronger when she would develop the habit to sing Frank Sinatra songs she learned from her Dad in school when she got in trouble.\n\nShe would attend many of arts and theatre schools through the duration of her teenage years mostly due to a lack of effort and Winehouse’s desire to focus on music. She would go on to start writing her own songs at the age of 14 and start singing for local Jazz Bands. In 2000 she would be scouted to be a vocalist for The National Youth Jazz Orchestra, where she would work for two years before getting signed to a management company after her best friend Tyler James sent a demo of her singing behind her back.\n\nThe Industry Secret Gets Out Of The Bag:\n\nAmy Winehouse’s debut in the music industry would happen on October 6th, 2003 with the release of ‘Stronger Than Me’. The song would end up being the lead single to her 2003 album ‘Frank’. ‘Stronger Than Me’ would be Winehouse’s lowest charting single through the duration of her career, with the song reaching number 71 on the UK charts.\n\n‘Frank’ would be released on October 20th, 2003. Since its released the album has charted in 24 countries and peak at #13 in the UK and #33 in the US. The album would have a runtime of 59 minutes and feature 11 original tracks and 2 covers. ‘Frank’ would end up featuring 4 singles. Where each song would chart well in both the UK and US. Every original song on the album would be written by Winehouse, with topics of life struggles, and the desire to succeed in music common themes of the album.\n\nThe album would be received well with fans and critiques alike with many praising Winehouse for her vocals range and songwriting abilities. She would end up being nominated for two BRIT awards, become shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, and end up winning the Ivor Novello Award from her efforts on the album. In 2022 the album would earn 3 Platinum RIAA titles.\n\nFun Fact: ‘Frank’ was not available in hardcopy for for most countries up until 2004–2007 after she signed a deal with Universal Music. Because of this Amy Winehouse didn't seen much chart and RIAA success for the album until the late 2000’s and early 2010’s. Where the album would become the most successful after her death in 2011. It is unknown why Island records made so little copies of the album, but in a 2004 interview with The Observer she would express dissatisfaction for the album and go on to say :\n\n“Some things on this album make me go to a little place that’s fucking bitter. I’ve never heard the album from start to finish. I don’t have it in my house. Well, the marketing was fucked, the promotion was terrible. Everything was a shambles. It’s frustrating, because you work with so many idiots — but they’re nice idiots. So you can’t be like, “You’re an idiot.” They know that they’re idiots.\n\nWorld Wide Fame With Back To Black:\n\nRumblings fora second album came about in May 2006, when Mark Ronson (record producer) obtained demos of the songs ‘You Know I’m No Good’ and ‘Rehab’. He would go on to play the songs on his NYC radio show and received an overwhelming amount of positive response to the songs. Winehouse would go on to develop a working relationship with Ronson in the following months and ask him to produce some songs on the next record. For the next five months Winehouse would bounce between Miami, New York, and London to get the album done. Winehouse would write every song on the record, while Ronson and Remi worked on the production.\n\nThe lead single to the record; ‘Rehab’, would be released on October 23rd, 2006. The song would go on to chart in 25 different countries, it would peak at #7 in the UK and #9 in the US. The song would gain universal acclaim for being one of the best and most personal songs of Winehouse’s career. In a 2011 interview Mark Ronson would go on to say that the song came about after Winehouse got in an heated discussion with her father over the severity of her drug addiction (which was still kept private to the world at this point in time). At the time many thought that the song was a sort of uplifting I don’t give af song, however when you look back at the song and know what we know about her death, some many feel uneasy while listening to the song.\n\n‘Back To Black’ was released on October 27th, 2006. The album would feature 11 songs and have a runtime of 35 minutes. The album would end up charting in 28 different countries, and reach #1 in 18 of those countries. She would end up earning a total of 75 RIAA Platinum titles and have the most sales for a UK artist in this century so far.\n\n‘Back To Black’ would gain worldwide acclaim and be regarded as one of the best albums of the 2000’s. Many praised Winehouse for her honest and relatable songs about heartbreak, toxic relationships, and substance abuse. However the album which at one point in time was supposed to be a release for Winehouse to discuss her personal life tuned into the key for said personal life to flood out into the public eye.\n\nBack To Black Deluxe:\n\nThe deluxe edition of ‘Back To Black’ was released on November 5th, 2007. It would feature anywhere between 7–8 tracks (depending on region), the most notable being the song ‘Valerie’.\n\nPromotion For ‘Back To Black’:\n\nBetween late 2006 to mid 2007 Winehouse would make sporadic appearances around the world to promote the album. Many of these appearances were done through music festival performances. Her most notable performances was at the 2007 Glastonbury festival, and the 2007 Chicago Lollapalooza.\n\nAt this period of time the general public was starting to get some insight into her private life, but her demons wouldn’t fully show themselves until the ‘Back To Black’ tour a couple of months later. On the ‘Back To Black’ tour (which would span 17 dates) would end up getting cancelled after only two shows due to Winehouse getting boed off stage for being highly intoxicated on stage. She would then go on to apologies for her fans and refrain from public appearances until the following years Grammys.\n\nA Break From The Studio:\n\nBetween 2008–2010 Winehouse would take a break from the recording studio and make sporadic appearances for different festivals and musical events in countries such as St. Lucia, Brazil, and Dubai. Around this time her private life would come to the forefront of her career and her public image and press mostly focused on making fun of the artist instead of be informative or offer help and comfort for her toxic relationships and addiction issues.\n\nIn 2009 she would go on to create her own record label named Lioness Records. She would go on to sign four artist, with the most notable being Dionne Bromfield. Three records would be released under the label.\n\nFun Fact: The Lioness Label was named after a necklace of a lioness Winehouse’s grandmother gave her as a child.\n\nIn 2010 it was confirmed by Island records that Winehouse was working on a new album and that Ronson and Remi would both be co-producing the record. No date was ever announced for the supposed third album but the original date was said to be in January 2011, but for many of reasons both with Winehouse herself and the label, the record was pushed back to an unnamed date.\n\nThe Death Of Amy Winehouse:\n\nOn July 23rd, 2011, Amy Winehouse was found dead in her London home. Her death was confirmed days later when a couriers inquest done on her body confirmed that she died due to accidental alcohol overdose, she was only 27 years old.\n\nBoth celebrities and fans alike would pay tribute to the artist through concerts, visuals, and by having every single one of her songs chart cohesively the weeks following her death. Artists such as Green Day and Mark Ronson would go on to dedicate and name songs and albums after the artist.\n\nSince her death in 2011, her family had started the Amy Winehouse foundation; a foundation dedicated towards helping young people who suffer from addiction issues. They have also helped produce a multitude of Amy Winehouse related documentaries which most notably include: ‘Amy’ (2015), ‘Amy Winehouse-Back To Black’ (2018), and ‘Reclaiming Amy’ (2021). With her parents permission Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi would release a posthumous album in Winehouse’s honour.\n\nLioness: Hidden Treasures:\n\nOn September 14th, 2011, the first single titled ‘Body and Soul’ with Tony Bennett was released. This recording was said to be the last song Winehouse ever recorded.\n\nOn December 2nd, 2011, ‘Lioness: Hidden Treasures’ was released. It features 12 tracks that included original songs, covers, and demos. The album would chart in 29 countries peak at #1 in 8 countries and earn a total of 18 RIAA Platinum titles. This album would represent what would have been for the third album and Winehouse’s career as a whole."
