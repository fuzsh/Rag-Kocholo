        "text": "The voice behind the 2007 tracks “Valerie” and “Back to Black” was a rising star, the illustrious, Grammy Award-winning Amy Winehouse. The singer, who found success with her sophomore album, Back to Black (2006), is the subject of the recent musical/drama film of the same name. Released to theaters on May 17, it has once again shined a spotlight on these Amy Winehouse songs and the singer who was lost far too soon.\n\nAlso known for her iconic hairstyle and classic cat eye makeup, Amy Winehouse found success again following Back to Black when she provided the vocals for the song “Valerie,” featured on the 2007 album Version from her producer, Mark Ronson. This is easily the most recognizable song by the artist and remains very popular today.\n\nBack to Black was recently named No. 8 on Apple’s 100 Best Albums list, also coming in at No. 33 on Rolling Stone’s roundup of 500 Greatest Albums. On top of that, it won the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nAmy Winehouse would record two more studio albums before her untimely death from alcohol consumption on July 23, 2011 at age 27. Celebrate her memory by checking out these intriguing Amy Winehouse songs.\n\n8. “Body and Soul” Feat. Tony Bennett\n\nThis Grammy-winning song has an amazing backstory to it as well as a sad truth. When Amy Winehouse got the opportunity to perform with Tony Bennett, the nerves kicked in, but he attempted to provide some reassurance that actually helped a great deal.\n\n“She was very nervous to perform, but I said, ‘You know, it sounds like you’re influenced by Dinah Washington.’ And all of the sudden, her whole life changed.” Bennett explained that Winehouse confirmed Dinah Washington was in fact her inspiration and that she was born with the gift to sing jazz.\n\nA chilling fact about this collaboration with Bennett is that “Body and Soul” was Winehouse’s final studio recording, the session taking place only four months before her death. The song was a part of the singer’s posthumous compilation album, Lioness: Hidden Treasures, which was released on what would have been her 28th birthday.\n\n7. “Me & Mr. Jones”: Amy Winehouse songs\n\n“Me & Mr. Jones” focuses on Winehouse’s relationship with Nasir Jones, best known as the artist Nas. Winehouse even shared that this song, which is from the Back to Black album, was her favorite one to perform. The pair only met in person once, and several times over Skype, as Winehouse died not too long after their encounter. But the song lives on to tell the tale of their strong bond.\n\n6. “Stronger Than Me”\n\n“Stronger Than Me” details an on-and-off relationship between Winehouse and an ex, with the lyrics explaining that he should be stronger, tougher and manlier. Although its lyrics sparked a bit of controversy, it remains one of the great Amy Winehouse songs.\n\nThere are actually two versions: an extended take released on her debut album, Frank (2003), which features an intro of scat (vocal jazz without words at all); and an edited one which omits the introduction.\n\n5. “Tears Dry on Their Own”: Amy Winehouse songs\n\nAnother very recognizable song from Winehouse’s discography is “Tears Dry on Their Own.” The singer shared in an interview, “I was with someone that I couldn’t really be with and I knew it wouldn’t last. But I think because I knew it couldn’t last, it’s kinda like saying, ‘I’m upset, but I know I’ll get over it,’ I guess.”\n\nAlthough the song was originally supposed to have a slower tempo, “Tears Dry on Their Own” became a more upbeat, Motown type of hit. The track even includes bits from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”\n\n4. “Rehab”\n\nThis song took home three Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. As the lead single on her sophomore album, “Rehab” is a rather upbeat detailing of Winehouse refusing to check herself into rehab for alcohol and drug addiction.\n\nThe song has a rather sad truth behind it in that her addictions would, as noted, ultimately be the cause of her death. And while Winehouse did indeed check into rehab not too long after its release, she left just prior to the 50th Annual Grammys, where she was so acclaimed.\n\n3. “You Know I’m No Good”: Amy Winehouse songs\n\nThis track details Winehouse’s infidelity to a partner and puts the blame on her drug and alcohol use. Released on Back to Black, “You Know I’m No Good” is one of the quintessential Amy Winehouse songs and features her insane contralto vocals, making her one of the rarest types of female vocalists.\n\n2. “Back to Black”\n\nThis song details Winehouse’s life after a boyfriend left her to go back to an ex-girlfriend. “Back to Black” was the third single released from the album and sold over a million copies in the UK alone. Ronson explained that the tune was created in record time. “The song – it took me about one night to lay the foundation of that track and then Amy wrote the lyrics and the melody especially fast, so it was like half a day, and then we probably recorded the rhythm track in three hours.”\n\n1. “Valerie”: Amy Winehouse songs\n\nThis groovy hit, which was originally put out by The Zutons, has a bit of a different backstory than listeners of the Winehouse cover version first thought. “Valerie” was written by David McCabe, lead vocalist of The Zutons, who based it on a woman named Valerie Star, a makeup artist he was in a relationship with at the time. Inspiration for the lyrics came after the real Valerie was arrested on the way to visiting him.\n\nHaving produced Back to Black, Mark Ronson credits Winehouse for putting his name on the map, first with Back to Black and then with “Valerie.”"
