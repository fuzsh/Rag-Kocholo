        "text": "VOICE OVER: Lisa Yang\n\nScript written by Tiffany Ezuma\n\nTop 10 Amy Winehouse Songs\n\nSubscribe: ‪http://www.youtube.com/c/MsMojo?sub_confirmation=1‬‬‬‬\n\nShe was a vocal powerhouse. Amy Winehouse's career may have been short lived but her legacy lives on. In this countdown we take a look at ten of her best songs including Just Friends, Love is a Losing Game, In My Bed, Stronger than Me, Valerie, Rehab, Wake Up Alone, and Me and Mr. Jones.\n\nSpecial thanks to our users lilmaur19, mac121mr0 and John MasterFall for submitting the idea on our Interactive Suggestion Tool at http://www.MsMojo.tv\n\n#10: “Just Friends”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nOne of her more relaxed songs, Amy ruminates over whether she and her unnamed lover will ever be “just friends.” It’s not the same old heartache and turmoil present on most of her tracks but rather, a subtle observation that there’s always something going on between her and this guy. The melody has a distinctly reggae feel that pairs nicely with the vocal riffs Amy performs on the track. The horn section gives it a casual feel, making it an easy song for listeners to dance and vibe to. In other words, it’s a great song for anyone who’s ever used “it’s complicated” to describe a relationship.\n\n#9: “F*** Me Pumps”\n\nFrank (2003)\n\nOne of Amy’s funniest songs, this track is the final single from her debut album Frank. In it, Amy describes a woman who is dressed to the nines and out to meet a baller; she’s wearing her sexiest pumps, which mean business. Amy describes a typical night out for this stereotypical gold-digger and pokes a bit of fun at the situation. Her vocals are as sweet as honey, and her playful personality comes through her vintage style. A radio friendly version called “Pumps” was also released but the unedited track reigns supreme.\n\n#8: “Love Is a Losing Game”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nThroughout her short career, Amy had covered the topic of troubled love time and time again but somehow this track feels fresh. She compares love to losing a game of cards and gambling with your heart. The song is softer than some of her other tracks but it still has a powerful punch; it’s simplicity makes listeners stop and reflect, and the comparison to a card game is an apt one. With it, Amy shows that you don’t need much to construct an unforgettable ballad. Other artists have recognized its greatness too, with covers by the late Prince, and Sam Smith gaining popularity as well.\n\n#7: “In My Bed”\n\nFrank (2003)\n\nAmy’s out to get hers in this seductive jam. In the third single from her debut album, Amy sings about wanting nothing more than someone to hook up with and not wanting to commit to anything more serious. It’s a statement of independence and confidence, and a breath of fresh air for a Winehouse track. With her lyrics, she invokes imagery of ships passing in the night, letting her lover know that their arrangement is fleeting. She claims her sexuality and has fun with it, in a way that feels authentic to who Amy was a person.\n\n#6: “Stronger Than Me”\n\nFrank (2003)\n\nThe first single of Amy’s career, “Stronger Than Me” is often overlooked next to her later, more mainstream hits. Written by Amy and producer Salaam Remi, this tune is about Amy’s rocky relationship with an older man. It’s a clever tune with Amy questioning her lover’s masculinity and calling him a “lady boy” while suggesting he get a grip. At the same time, she shows off her R&B chops and early promise in her songwriting capabilities, capturing what it’s like to be in a relationship on the brink of collapse. Despite only reaching the 71st spot on the UK Singles Chart, it won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song Musically and Lyrically in 2004.\n\n#5: “Tears Dry on Their Own”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nKnown for her love of 1960s Motown, Amy and her producers interpolated the classic Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” to serve as the foundation for this song’s beat. With the up-tempo rhythm, the song becomes an empowered break-up anthem as Amy vows that she’ll get over her lover’s abandonment. Like many of her other hits, it’s sassy and in your face, with Amy belting out the chorus. The original version of this song was performed as more of a ballad and which was finally released posthumously on 2011’s Lioness: Hidden Treasures album.\n\n#4: “Valerie”\n\nVersion (2007)\n\nRecorded for Mark Ronson’s 2007 album Version, “Valerie” has become one of the best-selling singles of Amy’s career. Unlike most of her songs, it’s a cover of a song by the English indie rock band, The Zutons. The power of Amy’s voice is undeniable as she wails about the titular Valerie. It’s an exciting departure from some of Amy’s more somber songs, giving new life to the songstress. A slower version of the tune was featured on the deluxe edition of “Back to Black,” but the faster one is infinitely more memorable.\n\n#3: “You Know I’m No Good”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nSung over a slinking baseline and backed by a lively horn section, this song is Amy’s bad girl anthem as she warns a lover that she’s no good. The tune stays in your head, with the joyful chaos of the horns repeating itself until you’re forced to groove to it. This song is the perfect mix of fun and despair as Amy switches from rhyming “Roger Moore” and “door” to crying on the kitchen floor. In addition to the original, there’s a remix featuring the Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah that packs an equally powerful punch.\n\n#2: “Rehab”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nArguably Amy’s most well-known song, it served as her breakthrough hit introducing her to international audiences. “Rehab” is one of her most upbeat songs, which has the singer crooning about refusing treatment for alcohol addiction. It was actually inspired by true events, when her management team begged her to seek treatment and Winehouse’s father didn’t believe she truly needed to go. Co-written with friend and frequent collaborator, producer Mark Ronson, the tune is an R&B anthem that pokes fun at a serious subject. It served as her first top ten Billboard hit and earned the singer three Grammys.\n\nBefore we unveil our number one pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n“Me & Mr. Jones”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\n“Wake Up Alone”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\n#1: “Back to Black”\n\nBack to Black (2006)\n\nLike a true artist, Amy drew from her own life and pain to craft her song lyrics. Inspired by her tumultuous relationship with husband Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy wrote this iconic song after Blake left her for an ex. She’s on her A game as she uses the phrase “back to black” as a metaphor for her substance abuse and depression. Amy’s voice is always emotive, but in this song especially you can hear the heartache and despair at being left alone. There’s a lot of darkness in this song but there’s beauty and truth in her heartbreak that allows listeners to relate, making it one of Amy’s signature songs.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
