        "text": "Amy Winehouse is up for a Brit Award, nearly five years after her death.\n\nHer nomination for best British female puts her up against Adele, which guarantees headlines.\n\nIt is a great story. But how did Amy even get nominated? Is there a chance this was manufactured by Brits' organisers to ensure people talk about the awards?\n\nThey insist that the selection process is totally transparent and that's not the reason she's made it onto the list.\n\nThere was no new material but she is still a genuine contender, according to a statement given to Newsbeat from the Brits.\n\nIt says: \"Amy's able to be nominated for British female solo artist because her album Amy (Original Soundtrack Album) was released and went into the Top 40 between 21 July 2014 and 10 December 2015 - the eligibility period.\"\n\nSo Amy gets in because of a soundtrack.\n\nBut Adele can also count herself lucky.\n\nHer album was released in November, weeks after the usual cut-off point for eligibility.\n\nBut this year, organisers shifted that date to December.\n\nThat's a sensible move - as it would've been a bit odd to have the Brits without the biggest-selling artist in the world.\n\nThere was certainly a bit of surprise at the nominations...\n\nTweet that questions why Amy was chosen., external\n\nTweet asking how Amy got chosen over Selena and Demi., external\n\nPeople like the idea of a shadowy bunch of music bosses, chomping on huge cigars and coming up with a list of whoever they want.\n\nBut it's not like that.\n\nFirst, the Official Charts Company works out how many albums are eligible for nomination. This year, it's 510.\n\nThe whole process is checked by the Electoral Reform Services, which also keeps tabs on the General Election.\n\nThat album list is then sent to the Brits Voting Academy."
