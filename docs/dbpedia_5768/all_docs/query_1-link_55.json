This past summer back home for an extended period of time (in what seems like the first time in four years) has been very refreshing, rejuvenating, nerve-wrecking and overwhelming all at the same time.\n\nThough, I am very excited for what’s to come. I’m 22, have nothing holding me back or down and have a large body of experiences to head straight on into the real world… Where do I go?!\n\nBut, I’d love to know what you all hope to hear from me: more vlogs, cover songs, music video projects? It seems that my mind is all over the place and interests everywhere, that I need to focus on channeling my strengths in order to be effective, organized and able to bring you something amazing.\n\nBut…\n\nIf I have learned anything in life–from the late Amy and a dear friend of mine–it is that this is a very short life that we live and we ought to live only for beautiful, meaningful moments. Do what you love, love what you do, and share your gifts and talents with the world… You never know whose soul you may touch.\n\n“Since I’ve come on home, well my body’s been a mess…”"
