        "text": "One of the very best singers and songwriters of the present age, and will be remembered for her music.\n\nHope there’s some decent demo’s of the third album. But I’d say her life was one big car crash for the last four years, and we will be lucky to get anything.\n\nTUG. Horses for courses. But ‘Back to Black’ is a modern classic.\n\nNowhere is it in anyway related or could it even be compared to The Doors, The Stones, Nirvana or even Janis Joplin.\n\nIt’s a fricking insult to music to make such a comparison.\n\nShe made crap chart music and a few tabloid headlines, the only surprise is she got there ahead of Pete Doherty!\n\nEDIT: Comparing Jimi Hendrix to Amy Winehouse??? Mother of jaysus!!!\n\nShockin isn’t it.\n\nJust goes to show how shit music is these days.\n\nTalented she was no doubt but fuck me she stands out in that list.\n\nAnd not in a good way mind.\n\nAnd i thought Larry was nuts with his Stone Roses bashin the other week.\n\nAs I said, horses for courses. Fair enough, Hendrix was a much bigger loss, but Joplin and Morrison are over-rated anyway…\n\nAnyway, just because she sold records doesn’t mean she’s crap. Those of us into our soul music would’ve considered her one of the better female singers of recent years. Sure, it was based on sixties, girl-group soul, but so bloody what? It was well-written, performed and recorded.\n\nI actually strongly disagree with this. She will be remembered for her very self destructive life, and not for her music and I can’t consider her one of the very best singers and songwriters of the present age.\n\nI’m sorry for her family. Someone dying young is never edifying. But she was nothing special on the music front in my view.\n\nFew tabloid stars are relevant when they’ve passed. FWIW I can’t name one song by Pete Doherty.\n\nGranted Amy was one, but she does have a decent album, and a unique voice. Granted the songs aren’t up to the standard of Burt Bacharach or Motown, and better singers were a dime a dozen in the sixties. But it was refreshing to hear good new soul music, especially in the midst of x-factor, rap and boy bands that have dominated for the last few years.\n\nSad news about one so young,regardless of your opinion on her music. It’s sad because it seemed like an inevitabablity and nobody could stop it.That’s a real shame. She did have some good songs and I would distinguish her from the X-factor type dross that pervades the music scene these days.\n\n“Love is a losing game” for example was really good,but it’s all a matter of taste.\n\nPS:\n\nThe Doors were/are monumenatlly overrated.Nirvana were quality.\n\nShe had an ok voice before she started smoking crack. But I agree that there was nothing particularly interesting or original about her music. A few decent singles do not a musical legend make. Part of her problem is that the music press were telling her she was a legend by the time she was 21 and unfortunately she started to believe them.\n\nFor a brief second I thought you said Craig David. Anyway, I kind of agree with the basic point. Amy Winehouse had some talent as a vocalist, but the sad truth is that we saw very little of it even when she was alive. Like a lot of other overated musicians who did themselves in, she had few decent songs, but truth is that she didn’t bring anything new to music. I really wish that mainstream music would stop glorifying mentally-ill musicians as deities, (Kurt Cobain, Jeff Buckley, etc.) who in reality didn’t bring as much to music as other living musicians.\n\nRIP Amy Winehouse - I hope others with mental health and substance addicition issues can learn from her death."
