        "text": "Guitar gods have nothing on guitar goddesses. For about a hundred years now, women have been doing some of the best, coolest and most interesting guitar playing around. From elemental folk and blues to boundary-pushing metal and R&B. Below are 20 awesome female guitarists and their essential recordings. Of course, there are more than 20 guitar greats who are women. Think of this list as a starting point and shred your way out from here.\n\nPeggy Jones, aka Lady Bo Her primal rhythm playing with Bo Diddley danced along the borders of blues and rock. Start with: Propulsive 1950s singles “Hey! Bo Diddley!” and “Road Runner.”\n\nLita Ford Lightning-bolt licks with bad-girl badassses The Runaways and later as an MTV metal queen. Start with: Immortal 1976 Runaways single “Cherry Bomb” and 1988 solo album “Lita,” which boasts the revelers anthem “Kiss Me Deadly.”\n\nJune Millington Bluesy, hot classic-rock fretwork with pioneering all-female ’70s band Fanny. Start with: Excellent 1971 Fanny album “Charity Ball.”\n\nJoni Mitchell Alternate-tuning acoustic tapestries that mesmerized guitar legends from Jimmy Page to Prince. Start With: Game-changing early ’70s LPs “Ladies of the Canyon” and “Blue.”\n\nBonnie Raitt The smokiest, sultriest slide guitar tone and phrasing ever. Start with: 1989 hit “Thing Called Love” and her duet with blues king John Lee Hooker on his “I’m in the Mood” remake from the same year.\n\nVicki Peterson British Invasion melody and classic twang filtered through ’80s Los Angeles attitude. Start with: The Bangles’ 1982 self-titled EP and 1984 single “Hero Takes A Fall.”\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe A trailblazer of early electric guitar, Tharpe cooked a spirited stew of blues, gospel and jazz. Start with: Her sting and swing on 1940s track “That’s All.”\n\nMaybelle Carter Folk fingerstylist’s “Carter scratch” right hand technique - in which the thumb plucks a bassline while other fingers play melodies - is a pivotal building block for bluegrass and country. Start with: The Carter Family’s soulful 1928 signature version of traditional song “Wildwood Flower.”\n\nNancy Wilson The supreme sorceress of intertwining acoustic and electric guitars into dragon-slayer rock. Start with: “Dreamboat Annie,” the 1975 debut album from Heart, the band boasting, of course, sister Ann Wilson’s sky-kissing vocals.\n\nPoison Ivy, aka Kristy Wallace Twisted surf slash and rockabilly saunter into The Cramps’ dark, campy underground rock. Start with: The Cramps’ 1979 debut EP “Gravest Hits.”\n\nH.E.R. Generational multifaceted talent laces psych-blues guitar into her Grammy winning R&B and pop. Start with: Slinky 2020 single “Hold On,” and H.E.R.’s live performances amplify the six-string heroics from the studio releases.\n\nJennifer Batten Subatomic two-hand fretboard tapping and reality-bending shred, talents which have gained her employment with the likes of Michael Jackson and Jeff Beck. Start with: Batten’s blistering 1992 version of “Flight of the Bumble Bee” and late ‘80s/early ‘90 live clips with MJ.\n\nKaki King Experimental composer, laser-sharp player pushing the limits of fingerstyle and percussive technique. Start with: Shapeshifting 2003 album “Everybody Loves You.”\n\nWendy Melvoin Funk-glam rhythm guitar for everyone from Prince to Sheryl Crow to Glen Campbell. Start with: Prince and the Revolution’s neon masterpiece album “Purple Rain.”\n\nJan Kuehnemund Her hummable solos helped all-female hard-rockers Vixen reach “Dial MTV” masses. Start with: Vixen’s polished 1988 self-titled debut LP, featuring the fantastic Richard Marx-penned single “Edge of a Broken Heart.”\n\nBrittany Howard Future-soul chemtrails and art-school chords. Start with: The garage-buzz break on 2019 solo track “He Loves Me,” her former band Alabama Shakes’ 2015 “Sound & Color” album and glam-punk side project “Thunderbitch.”\n\nSt. Vincent Post-modern anti-guitar and iconoclast-pop compositions. Start with: The bionic fretwork on 2011 LP “Strange Mercy.”\n\nOrianthi Blazing guitarist from Australia is a go-to onstage foil for headliners like Carrie Underwood, Michael Jackson and Alice Cooper, and a bona fide star on her own. Start with: The posthumous MJ film “Michael Jackson’s This Is It,” YouTube live clips from her Alice era and defiant 2010 solo track “According To You.”\n\nNita Strauss After Orianthi left Alice Cooper’s touring band around 2014, the shock rock legend replaced her with another standout. Whereas her predecessor was more blues-based, Nita Strauss is a streamlined shredder. Start with: Strauss’ feature that leads into live versions of Cooper’s pop-metal classic “Poison,” and her 2018 solo album “Controlled Chaos” which harkens back to ’80s guitar instrumental classics by her heroes Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.\n\nMemphis Minnie Jazz-nimble country-blues filigree and leads. Start with: “When The Levee Breaks,” Minnie’s 1929 collabo with singer Kansas Joe McCoy that Led Zeppelin rebooted with Valhalla wallop for “Led Zeppelin IV.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe top 10 solo stars to play guitar for ever\n\nWhat do the L.A. Rams and Alice Cooper have in common? Guitar shredder Nita Strauss"
