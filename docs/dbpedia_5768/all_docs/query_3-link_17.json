        "text": "The sound. The look. The songs. The drama. Together, they were all part of the musical phenomenon that was 2006's Back To Black, the second album fromAmy Winehouse. The British neo-soul singer teamed with producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi to create a release that irresistibly combined masterful jazz-inflected vocals, deeply personal lyrics and retro-R&B grooves. Five of the album's tracks were released as singles, but it was the first, \"Rehab,\" that almost singlehandedly transformed Winehouse from a popular singer to a worldwide celebrity, and the song's slyly humorous acknowledgment of personal demons firmly established her iconoclastic legend.\n\nBack To Black earned the diminutive Winehouse a massive night at the milestone 50th GRAMMY Awards. She garnered Best New Artist honors, the album was named Best Pop Vocal Album and \"Rehab\" earned wins for Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. (Back To Black was also nominated for Album Of The Year, but lost out to Herbie Hancock's River: The Joni Letters).\n\nSadly, Back To Black was Winehouse's final album: She died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 at age 27. However, her music and legacy endure, evidenced by the success of the riveting 2015 documentary, Amy. Here are 10 lesser-known facts you might not know about Back To Black, an album that remains unique and compelling:\n\n1. Ronson, then an unestablished producer, and Winehouse sparked an immediate connection.\n\n\"I didn't really know anything about her until she showed up,\" Ronson said in a deleted scene from the documentary Amy. \"I just asked her what kind of record she wanted to make. And she played me things like the Shangri-Las that I wasn't really familiar with. â€¦ She was instantly so cool. I liked her in the first five minutes.\" Overnight, Ronson created a demo for \"Back To Black.\" Upon hearing it the next day, Winehouse was \"over the moon\" with what she heard. Ronson would ultimately produce six of the album's tracks and earn Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical honors at the 50th GRAMMY Awards.\n\n2. Back To Black is quite literally a break-up album.\n\nWinehouse wrote the songs for the album in the months following an acrimonious parting with then-boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil. In Amy, she is heard explaining that she needed to create \"something good out of something bad.\" She and Fielder-Civil later reconciled and married in 2007. (The couple divorced in 2009.)\n\n3. \"Rehab\" is indeed autobiographical.\n\nIn 2005 Winehouse's manager Nick Shymansky pleaded with her to check into a rehab facility, and she said she would if her father thought it was a good idea. Arrangements were made, but Mitch Winehouse told his daughter he didn't think she needed treatment. When Amy Winehouse relayed this story to producer Ronson a year later, adding a 'No, no, no' for emphasis, he encouraged her to put it all in a song.\n\n4. \"Rehab\" gives shout outs to two of Winehouse's musical heroes.\n\nThe lyrics to the song contain the lines \"I'd rather be at home with Ray\" and \"There's nothing you can teach me that I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway,\" references to artists Winehouse held in high regard. \"Ray\" is the inimitable Ray Charles and \"Mr. Hathaway\" is Donny Hathaway, the soul singer whose hits include the 1972 GRAMMY-winning duet with Roberta Flack, \"Where Is The Love.\" In performance, Winehouse sometimes substituted \"Blake\" for \"Ray,\" in reference to Fielder-Civil.\n\n5. \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" is built on top of a Motown classic.\n\nProducer Remi thought the album needed something up-tempo and suggested that Winehouse set her slower, sadder conception of this song against a backing track based on the Nick Ashford/Valerie Simpson classic \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" which was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell for the Tamla/Motown label and was later a solo hit for Diana Ross.\n\n6. You can actually watch footage of Winehouse recording the album's title track.\n\nIt's rare to have cameras capture the magic moment when a hit comes to life in a studio, but a friend of Winehouse's backing band happened to be shooting random footage in the New York studio where she was recording, and filmed her singing a devastating take of \"Back To Black.\" (When finished, Winehouse says, \"Ooh, it's a bit upsetting at the end, isn't it?\"). The footage can be seen in Amy.\n\n7. Winehouse didn't meet her backing band until the album was finished.\n\nSix of Back To Black's 11 songs, including \"Rehab,\" were given a retro feel courtesy of musical backing by members of the Dap-Kings, a New York-based funk/soul band who backed vocalist Sharon Jones. Ronson worked with Winehouse and the Dap-Kings separately in London and New York, and the singer didn't meet the band until promotions for the album began. The Dap-Kings did play live engagements with Winehouse, including her first U.S. tour and TV appearances on \"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno\" and \"Late Show With David Letterman.\"\n\n8. Winehouse was scheduled to perform live on the 50th GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nWinehouse was invited to perform onstage at Staples Center in Los Angeles for the 50th GRAMMY telecast, but the U.S. government initially denied her a work visa to make the trip. By the time that decision was reversed, it was too late to make travel plans. Instead, Winehouse and her band set up in a London theater and performed \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good\" via satellite.\n\n9. Winehouse received a GRAMMY from a personal idol with whom she would win a posthumous GRAMMY.\n\nAn avid Tony Bennett fan, Winehouse was stunned and delighted when it was Bennett who announced \"Rehab\" as the Record Of The Year winner. Winehouse's last recording was a duet with Bennett, a cover of the standard \"Body And Soul\" for Bennett's Duets II album. Winehouse died on July 23, 2011, before the release of Duets II. The song netted Bennett and Winehouse a GRAMMY for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for 2011.\n\n10. Back To Black put Amy Winehouse in the GRAMMY history books.\n\nWinehouse's five wins for 2007 set a record at the time for the most GRAMMYs won by a female British artist. Adele has since broken the record, earning six GRAMMYs for 2011.\n\n(Chuck Crisafulli is an L.A.-based journalist and author whose most recent works include Go To Hell: A Heated History Of The Underworld, Me And A Guy Named Elvis, Elvis: My Best Man, and Running With The Champ: My Forty-Year Friendship With Muhammad Ali.)\n\nDanielle Brooks\n\nTwo years into her memorable run as prisoner Taystee in \"Orange Is the New Black,\" Danielle Brooks proved her talents extended far beyond the walls of the Litchfield penitentiary with an acclaimed turn in the 2015 Broadway revival of The Color Purple. After the Juilliard graduate picked up a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in 2016, she became a GRAMMY winner in 2017, when the cast won Best Musical Theater Album.\n\nThe all-singing, all-dancing film adaptation of the Alice Walker novel earned Brooks her first Academy Award nod, too. For she once again stole the show in its Hollywood transfer as the strong-minded Sofia, a character first played on the big screen by Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nBradley Cooper spent six years practicing conducting just six minutes of music for his portrayal of legendary composer Leonard Bernstein in acclaimed biopic Maestro. And the multi-talent's admirable commitment paid off when he received Academy Award nods for Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, and Best Actor.\n\nCooper was also nominated in the latter two categories, along with Best Adapted Screenplay, five years ago for another musical, A Star Is Born, and earned two GRAMMYs for the same project. In 2019, he shared Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with Lady Gaga for \"Shallow,\" the spellbinding ballad which also picked up a Record Of The Year nod. A year later, the same film triumphed in Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nLike Batiste, Billie Eilish has made an impressive GRAMMYs run in a short span of time. The alt-pop phenomenon has already picked up nine awards from 25 nominations (and she's only just turned 22!). And at her first GRAMMYs just four years ago, Eilish already cemented herself in GRAMMY history: not only did she become just the second artist to claim Best New Artist and Record, Song, and Album Of the Year, but she became the youngest artist to do so at 18 years old.\n\nEilish added to her GRAMMY legacy with two more wins at the 2024 ceremony, for \"What Was I Made For?\" [From The Motion Picture *Barbie*], which won the star her second golden gramophones for Song Of The Year and Best Song Written For Visual Media; her James Bond theme, \"No Time To Die,\" won the latter in 2021.\n\n\"What Was I Made For?\" â€” played during the poignant scene where Margot Robbie's titular character meets her creator â€” has also enamored Oscar voters. In fact, it's the predicted favorite to clinch Best Original Song, which \"No Time to Die\" helped Eilish claim in 2022.\n\nLudwig GÃ¶ransson\n\nLudwig GÃ¶ransson is predicted to win his second Best Original Score Oscar this year thanks to his suitably intense arrangements for Oppenheimer; his first win came in 2019 for Black Panther. The Swedish composer has already won Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for the same projects at the GRAMMYs.\n\nBut it's in the realm of socially conscious hip-hop where GÃ¶ransson has been a GRAMMYs awards trailblazer. Childish Gambino's \"This Is America,\" a powerful state of the nation address which he co-produced, picked up both Song and Record Of The Year at the 2019 ceremony â€” marking the first time a rap track had won either accolade. GÃ¶ransson's fruitful partnership with Gambino has also seen him receive nods for Album Of The Year and Best R&B Song.\n\nFinneas O'Connell\n\nFinneas O'Connell might have eight fewer GRAMMY nominations than his sister (Billie Eilish), but he does have one more win under his belt. Indeed, having masterminded Eilish's blockbuster breakthrough, 2019's When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, and hit the studio with artists such as Tate McRae, Camila Cabello, and Selena Gomez, the Californian picked up Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical at the 2020 ceremony. (Alongside the nine golden gramophones he's shared with his younger sibling â€” and primary collaborator â€” that takes his overall tally up to 10.)\n\nAs a co-writer on Eilish's James Bond theme \"No Time to Die,\" Finneas and his sis will have two Oscars a piece should their co-written song, \"What Was I Made For?\" [From The Motion Picture Barbie], win Best Original Song as predicted.\n\nMark Ronson\n\nMark Ronson first caught GRAMMYs attention for his behind-the-scenes efforts, winning Best Pop Vocal Album, Record Of The Year, and Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical in 2008 for his work on Amy Winehouse's seminal Back to Black. But eight years later, he scooped two GRAMMYs for his very own throwback, the Bruno Mars-featuring \"Uptown Funk,\" and in 2019, picked up Best Dance Recording as part of the supergroup Silk City alongside Diplo and Dua Lipa.\n\nRonson and Lipa were once again nominated together at the 2024 GRAMMYs for their global chart-topper, \"Dance the Night\" [From The Motion Picture Barbie], which didn't receive a Best Original Song Academy Award nod. The DJ-turned-hitmaker still notched an Oscar nomination, though, thanks to a different Barbie number he co-wrote: the Ryan Gosling-sung \"I'm Just Ken.\"\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nHere's a staggering fact: Martin Scorsese, widely regarded as one of the finest filmmakers in Hollywood history, has as many GRAMMYs to his celebrated name as he does Oscars: one.\n\nThe auteur received his GRAMMY in 2006, when his Bob Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, won in the Best Long Form Music Video Category. (He had been nominated the previous two years, in the same Category in 2005 for his PBS series Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues: A Musical Journey, and in the Best Compilation Soundtrack Album For A Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media Category in 2004 for Gangs Of New York.)\n\nHis sole Best Director victory at the Academy Awards came not for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas, but for his 2006 remake of The Departed in what many interpreted as a career win. He earned his tenth nomination in the coveted category at the 2024 Oscars, for Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nDiane Warren\n\nDiane Warren is responsible for some of the all-time great movie power ballads: see the late '90s holy trinity of Celine Dion's \"Because You Loved Me,\" LeAnn Rimes' \"How Do I Live,\" and Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss A Thing.\" However, the prolific songwriter has never won an Oscar outright (she was awarded an honorary one in 2022). She has another shot at the 2024 Oscars thanks to Becky G's \"The Fire Inside\" from the Cheetos-inspired Flamin' Hot, which earned Warren her 15th Best Original Song nomination.\n\nThe songwriting dynamo has received the same number of nods at the GRAMMYs, and celebrated a win in 1997, when \"Because You Loved Me\" (from 1996's Up, Close and Personal) took home Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\nJohn Williams\n\nWhere to start with John Williams? The veteran composer received his 54th Academy Award nod this year, with his work on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny recognized in Best Original Score. He remains second only to Walt Disney for the most Oscar nominations ever, he's the only individual to be recognized across seven decades in a row (his first came back in 1968 for Valley of the Dolls), and he became the oldest nominee ever in 2023 â€” a record which he topped again this year at 91.\n\nAnd Williams has been even more successful at the GRAMMYS, picking up a remarkable 26 golden gramophones from 76 nominations. His latest came only last month when \"Helena's Theme,\" the piece of music composed for Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character in Dial of Destiny, was crowned Best Instrumental Composition.\n\nDan Wilson\n\nDan Wilson picked up the first of his six GRAMMY nominations with his own band Semisonic's anthemic \"Closing Time.\" But following the alt-rock trio's initial split in 2001, all of his other nods have been for his work as an in-demand songwriter. Wilson has won two of the General Field GRAMMYs, first for Song Of The Year for Dixie Chicks' \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" in 2006 and Album Of The Year for his work on Adele's 21 in 2012.\n\nAnd he added a third GRAMMY to his trophy haul this year, as his co-written Chris Stapleton track \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song. Thanks to his contribution to the aforementioned Batiste ballad, the hitmaker can also now call himself an Oscar nominee, too.\n\nAndrew Wyatt\n\nRonson co-produced and co-wrote \"I'm Just Ken\" [From The Motion Picture Barbie] with longtime collaborator Andrew Wyatt. The pair won the 2019 Best Original Song Oscar for their co-write on A Star Is Born cut \"Shallow,\" and also picked up Best Song Written for Visual Media with the same tearjerker (alongside Cooper) at the GRAMMYs.\n\nWyatt, who first found fame as one-third of electronic trio Miike Snow before launching a solo career, has also enjoyed a taste of GRAMMY recognition elsewhere. The New Yorker's first nod came in 2012 when Bruno Mars' \"Grenade,\" the emotive heartbreak anthem that counted him as one of six songwriters, was nominated for Song Of The Year.\n\n10 Must-See Moments From The 2024 GRAMMYs: Taylor Swift Makes History, Billy Joel & Tracy Chapman Return, Boygenius Manifest Childhood Dreams"
