        "text": "“Amy Winehouse was a very old soul in a very young body,” said Nick Gatfield, the man who secured her first record deal. Winehouse, a self-confessed vintage obsessive, drew heavily from the 1950s and ‘60s in both her style and sound. Among her most significant influences were old-school girl bands like The Shangri-Las.\n\nREAD MORE: Student, 25, dies after electric shock from leaning on food truck at music festival\n\nWinehouse’s deep love for bygone eras was intimately connected to her family, where music was a shared passion. Growing up in a tight-knit household, her grandmother, Nan, played a pivotal role in shaping her musical tastes.\n\nNan, who had been part of London’s vibrant music scene, dating jazz club owner Ronnie Scott and embodying the ultimate pin-up girl, imparted a rich musical education to Winehouse. Their home resonated with the sounds of classic songs, sung by her, her father, and her grandmother. By 2000, when she joined the National Youth Jazz Orchestra as its first female vocalist, Winehouse was already performing standards by Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, and Minnie Ripperton.\n\nIn an interview, Winehouse revealed her preference for older music, stating, “I just like the old stuff. It’s all quite dramatic and atmospheric.\n\nYou’d have an entire story in song.” This storytelling quality drew her to The Shangri-Las, a 1960s girl group known for their theatrical, character-driven lyrics and dynamic soundscapes. Songs like “The Leader Of The Pack” and “Give Him A Great Big Kiss” exemplified their ability to create vivid, narrative worlds within their music, a style that captivated Winehouse.\n\n“I love the drama, I love the atmosphere, I love the sound effects,” Winehouse said, acknowledging the profound influence The Shangri-Las had on her. This influence was especially evident in her album Back to Black, where the girl group’s storytelling and atmospheric elements were key inspirations.\n\nShe admired their song “I Can Never Go Home Anymore,” calling it the most depressing song ever, and found solace in it during personal heartbreaks.\n\nMark Ronson, who worked closely with Winehouse, noted that her affinity for The Shangri-Las was a significant part of her persona. “She said she liked to go out to bars and clubs and play snooker with her boyfriend and listen to The Shangri-Las,” he recalled. This influence was so profound that Winehouse would often incorporate The Shangri-Las’ 1965 track “Remember (Walking in the Sand)” into her live performances, seamlessly blending it with her own song, “Back to Black.”\n\nThe impact of The Shangri-Las on Winehouse’s music is evident throughout her work. The doo-wop piano intro of “Back to Black,” the call-and-response jovialness of “Rehab,” and the melodramatic ballads “Wake Up Alone” and “Love Is A Losing Game” all bear the hallmark of the girl band’s style.\n\n“I listen to music that is of our time and I just get angry,” Winehouse once said, expressing her contentment with her nostalgic influences. By drawing from the jazz acts and girl bands of the past, Winehouse crafted timeless anthems that continue to resonate with contemporary and future audiences."
