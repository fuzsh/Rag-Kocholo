        "text": "This was a thankless task. Not only are there countless female guitarists who have shaped the course of rock ‘n’ roll, from Poison Ivy to Joni Mitchell, but there are also numerous ways to measure a ‘great’ guitarist. It’s easy to focus on virtuosity, but that degrades guitar playing to a mere technical pursuit. For me, the best guitarist is not the one with the fastest fingers but the one who helps the listener forget that what they’re listening to is basically a resonant amalgamation of steel and wood.\n\nFor that reason, this list includes guitarists from various backgrounds. Whether it be blues, classic rock, country, folk or jazz, every kind of guitarist is represented. What they all have in common is that they honed their craft in a male-dominated industry that frequently ignores the work of female musicians.\n\nThe artists you will find below have been selected not simply for their skill but also for their legacy. The music industry has always given space to women, but it has always been claustrophobic; a cupboard under the stairs. While male musicians have historically been celebrated for their ability to push the envelope, female musicians are often told that their success will come from adhering to a standard set for them by their male peers.\n\nMany of the musicians below were selected because they refused to comply with those standards, using their music to expand women’s roles on stage and in the studio. Others were picked simply because they play better than anyone else. So, without further ado, here are our favourite female guitarists of all time.\n\nThe 15 best female guitarists of all time:\n\n15. Belinda Butcher\n\nBest known for her work with shoegaze pioneers My Bloody Valentine, Belinda Butcher was regarded as an outsider even by those closest to her. At the height of punk – ironically, one of the most tribal and totalitarian genres – she was listening to music from the 1920s and experimenting with the lush, textured guitar style so essential to albums like Isn’t Anything and Loveless.\n\nWhile her guitar playing has long been overshadowed by that of her bandmate Kevin Shields, Butcher’s playing has had a marked influence on today’s leading female guitarist. Talking to Fender, Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan said: “She’s this huge figure in my songwriting and in my life. I don’t wanna call her ‘in the shadows’, but she is in the shadows.”\n\n14. Adrianne Lenker\n\nBorn in 1991 and raised in a Christian cult until she was six, Adrianne Lenker is the vocalist and lead songwriter for Big Thief, a group who have been blurring the line between Americana, folk, punk, post-rock and countless other genres for many years now.\n\nHer skill as an acoustic guitarist has been an essential factor in Big Theif’s rise to fame, with her use of unusual plucked rhythms and alternative tunings lending the band a certain leftfield edge. In all her songs, there’s a real sense of unity between her and the guitar. She’s played acoustic guitar since she was a child and currently plays a Collings electric semi-hollow body with P90 pickups. She also has a Martin cutaway and a 12-string ‘72 Martin acoustic.\n\n13. Elizabeth Cotton:\n\nBorn in 1893, the great Libba Cotten was an entirely self-taught, left-handed blues guitarist who, like Jimi Hendrix, played a right-handed guitar upside down. This unusual positioning meant that she could hit the bass notes with her fingers and palsy the melody with her thumb, giving birth to the rhythmic stride style known as “Cotten picking”\n\nCotten’s first instrument was the banjo, which she borrowed from her right-handed brother and was forced to play upside down. She played the guitar all through her childhood but didn’t begin recording her songs until she was in her 60s, having been discovered by the Seeger family (yep, the family of Pete Seeger) while she was working as their housekeeper.\n\n12. Odetta\n\nWidely regarded as the voice of the Civil Rights movement, Odetta rose to prominence during the American folk revival of the 1950s and ‘60s and influenced many of its most notable performers, including Joan Baez, Mavis Staples and Bob Dylan. While her sound is unequivocally connected to her impressive vocals, she was also a master guitarist.\n\nOdetta pioneered the double-thumb ‘Odetta strum” technique and wrote some of the most powerful songs of the Civil Rights era before going on to pen funk-laden anthems like ‘Hit or Miss’ and ‘Every Night’ in the 1970s. A real legend.\n\n11. Tracy Chapman\n\nAuthor of the late ‘80s road anthem ‘Fast Car’, Tracy Chapman, is best known as a songwriter, but her guitar playing was just as instrumental to her overnight success. Discovered in 1985 and promptly signed to Elektra, her music is at once intimate, confessional and socially conscious.\n\nLike Adrienna Lenker, Chapman’s style reflects a near-symbiotic relationship between player and instrument, with the simplicity of her four-chord structures often belying the intricacy of her arrangements.\n\n10. Naoko Yamano – Shonen Knife\n\nShonen Knife was famously one of Kurt Cobain’s favourite bands. He once said that women were the future of rock music, and Naoko Yamano, Shonen’s lead singer and guitarist, proves just how right he was.\n\nYamano formed Shonen knife with her sister Atsuko and her friend Michie Nakatani in Osaka 1981. With Naoko’s DIY punk guitar lines at the helm, the trio demonstrated that alternative music didn’t have to be all doom and gloom. And that it could embrace elements of pop while still being subversive.\n\n9. Nancy Wilson\n\nHeart’s Nancy Wilson is undoubtedly one of the most pioneering guitarists of the 1970s. A virtuoso from age ten, Wilson’s playing was one of the most ingenious and creative aspects of Heart’s immensely popular style. She was also the group’s lead singer on occasion, offering up her vocals for some of the group’s most beloved hits, including ‘These Dreams’.\n\nAt a time when female guitarists were few and far between, Wilson demonstrated that women were more than capable of competing with posturing stadium rockers like Jimmy Page, Richie Blackmore, and David Gilmour.\n\n8. Poison Ivy\n\nPoison Ivy made playing in a rock band look like living inside one of Oscar Wilde’s absinthe-induced fever dreams. While her bandmate and husband, Lux Interior, lurched around on stage, she stood stock-still, staring out at the audience through her mess of red hair, the very image of Bohemia.\n\nConstantly thrashing away at her low-slung hollow-body guitar, Ivy was the perfect foil to Lux’s glam-laden stage persona. Where Lux is almost sadomasochistic in his servitude to the crowd, Poison Ivy is completely non-plussed by the audience’s gaze. For her, nothing else mattered beyond the guitar in her hands.\n\n7. Brittany Howard\n\nThe world was introduced to Howard through Alabama Shakes, whose breakthrough single ‘Hold On’ soundtracked the summer of 2012. Clutching her beloved Gibson SG, Howard clearly owes a debt to rock ‘n’ roll pioneer Sister Rosetta Tharpe, whose voice and dexterous fretwork was given new life in Alabama Shakes’ gravelly, sun-drenched recordings.\n\nBut it is perhaps ‘Gimme All Your Love’ that truly demonstrates Howard’s astonishing virtuosity. Blending soulful chord progressions with near-Stravinskian rhythmic complexity, her playing on that single from Sound & Colour is the work of a player who has spent a lifetime honing their craft. Oh yeah, and she plays it all while singing some of the most astonishing vocal lines imaginable.\n\n6. Joan Jett\n\nJoan Jett gets a hard time from classic rock enthusiasts. Just think about how red-faced and bewildered Ted Nugent got when he read Rolling Stone had named the former Blackhearts frontperson one of their best guitarist of all time.\n\nThe usual argument is that Jett shouldn’t be included on this list because she didn’t write her biggest hit. And whilst It’s true that ‘I Love Rock And Roll’ was originally written by The Arrows, Jett is responsible for many other (and arguably better) riffs. Take ‘Activity Grrrl’ or The Runaways’ ‘Cherry Bomb’, both of which are infinitely more carnal and technically stunning than the track she is best known for.\n\n5. Viv Albertine\n\nAs the iconic lead guitarist of The Slits, Viv Albertine reminded the music industry that women couldn’t just play the guitar but that they could be pioneers of their craft. Her unique playing on tracks like ‘Typical Girls,’ for example, still sounds unlike anything before or since. Viv was always completely idiosyncratic.\n\nFor Albertine, the guitar came to symbolise the potential of individual expression. “When I picked up the guitar,” she once said, “You know it was probably almost the equivalent of how powerful some psychos [feel] when they pick up a gun. What I’ve made that guitar do for me is amazing. I’ve painted a whole life for me that I would’ve had. I never mastered it in terms of technical ability, but I did manage to create my own sound.”\n\n4. Joni Mitchell\n\nWhile it’s Mitchell’s voice that gets the most praise, her guitar playing is an even more essential aspect of her all-consuming sound. Without those intricate fingerstyle guitar parts on songs like ‘Little Green’ or the loose strums on ‘Big Yellow Taxi’, the spell Mitchell’s songcraft seeks to cast over its audience would likely bounce back unabsorbed.\n\nThe warmth and breadth of Mitchell’s guitar arrangments are largely down to her use of alternate tunings, especially open E and D, the latter of which allowed her to craft guitar lines that are far more resonant and mellow than they would be in standard tuning. They also allow her to move around the fretboard in usually inaccessible ways, giving her chord progressions that signature fluidity.\n\n3. Lianne La Havas\n\nLianne La Havas exploded onto the scene in the early 2010s with a finely crafted blend of neo-soul, jazz, and alt-folk. Boasting mellifluous vocals and gently-plucked jazz guitar, La Havas’ recordings are always a feast for the ears.\n\nHer debut Is Your Love Big Enough? harked back to the tender sounds of Sharon Stone and Nina Simone, while embracing the influence of more contemporary acts like Lauryn Hill and Laura Marling. As the years have passed, she’s stayed true to those original influences but continues to move towards a more jazz-focused and groove-laden sound. Take her 2020 single ‘Bittersweet’, which sees the singer evoke the breakbeat spirit of Erykah Badu and Robert Glasper to astonishing effect.\n\n2. Peggy Jones\n\nAlthough her name is rarely mentioned, Bo Diddley’s rhythm guitarist, Peggy Jones, laid the foundation for the female rock guitarist. Born in Harlem in 1940, Jones started out as a dancer but, after teaching herself guitar at the age of 15, swiftly fell in love with the instrument and joined a local doo-wop group.\n\nAfter meeting the famed guitarist backstage at the Apollo Theater, Jones began recording with Bo Diddley in 1957 and appeared on many of his best-known songs, including ‘Aztec’, which Peggy wrote and played every guitar part on. While Jones was known as ‘Lady Bo’ onstage, she always maintained a sense of independence, recording her own material without any assistance and eventually forming her own group, The Jewels, after leaving Bo Diddley’s band in 1961.\n\n1. Sister Rosetta Tharpe\n\nHow could Sister Rosetta not top this list? Tharpe basically invented the rock ‘n’ roll guitar and so deserves nothing less than the number one spot. After moving to New York in the 1930s, she soaked up the creative energy of the Harlem Renaissance and went on to establish herself as one of the most celebrated blues musicians of her day.\n\nUsing her hammer-claw guitar packing to evoke the stride piano style of Scott Joplin, Tharpe bought a whole new level of virtuosity to the blues. Coupled with a no-fucks-given attitude and messianic stage presence, she became something of a template for rock ‘n’ roll musicians for years to come – whether those who adopted her style knew it or not."
