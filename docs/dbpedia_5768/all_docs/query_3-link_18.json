        "text": "In the wake of singer Amy Winehouse‘s untimely death, the jazz-influenced crooner’s second album 2007 Back to Black shot to number one on the iTunes chart Saturday.\n\nDespite her short-lived musical career (she only released two studio albums, and the fate of her much-delayed third album now rests in the hands of her parents Mitch and Janis), Winehouse managed to create a number of classics. Many in the entertainment and music worlds — including Russell Brand, Adele, Katy Perry and Kelly Clarkson — have spoken out about the scope of her talent and influence since news broke of her death early Saturday.\n\nSTORY: Amy Winehouse Remembered: A Unique Artist Gone Too Soon, But Not Forgotten\n\n1. “Rehab” Winehouse’s most commercial hit was also the one that hit closest to home for the addiction-addled singer. No exploration of her musical library would be complete without listening to her sing the lyrics “They tried to make me go to rehab but I said ‘No, no, no.'” Though the song, which won the Grammy for song and record of the year in 2008, once had a tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s message may now be forever changed to one of sadness.\n\n2. “You Know I’m No Good” The singer’s second-most downloaded song tells the story of an unfaithful lover who gets caught cheating with her ex-boyfriend. “I cheated myself, like I knew I would,” she sings. “I told ya I was trouble, yeah you know that I’m no good.”\n\nSTORY: Amy Winehouse Joins Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin in ’27 Club’\n\n3. “Back to Black” The title track for Winehouse’s 2007 album is among her most popular. The song, which deals with a devastating break-up (many of the album’s songs were inspired by her tumultuous relationship with ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil), has over 10,000 downloads according to SoundScan.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths\n\n4. “Valerie” Winehouse collaborated with pal and Back to Black producer Mark Ronson on this cover The Zutons’ 2006 hit song. Ronson, who included the song on his 2008 album Version (it was also featured on Winehouse’s Back to Black: B-Sides), has said he was a little hesitant about recording a Winehouse rendition of the song so soon after its release. “I wasn’t sure how it would work, but she went into the studio and tried it,” he has said. “I loved it.”\n\nSTORY: Amy Winehouse’s Death: What Hollywood is Saying"
