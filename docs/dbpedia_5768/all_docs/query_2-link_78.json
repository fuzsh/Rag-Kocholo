        "text": "When you’re first starting out as a musician, the most important thing is to not get discouraged with your progress. Every musician started right where you are now, and they achieved mastery of their instrument through years of practice. And you know what? You can do the exact same thing!\n\nDon’t believe me? Well, why don’t you read up on how some of the most famous musicians in the world got their start? What you find may surprise you!\n\nAlso, we’re going to add in the first song each musician on this learned when we can manage to find it. It’s not brought up all that often, but the choices that these musicians and/or their teachers made can be really interesting. However, if you can track down (and cite!) any of the first songs learned by the musicians on this list let us know and we’ll add them in!\n\n33 Famous Guitarists - Their First Guitar and How They Learned\n\nBrian May\n\nFirst Guitar: Spanish-style guitar of unknown origin.\n\nFirst Band: 1984\n\nHow He Learned: Self taught, though he did take formal music lessons in his youth\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nA heartwarming story, Brian May actually built his first electric guitar (which he would go on to use with Queen) with his dad. It was intentionally designed to allow feedback after May was inspired by the playing of Jeff Beck. He also received a Spanish style acoustic guitar as a birthday present, though he quickly wanted to move on to an instrument more suited towards the type of music he wanted to play.\n\nKurt Cobain\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown electric, though likely a Harmony or Sears budget model.\n\nFirst Band: Fecal Matter\n\nHow He Learned: Approximately one month’s worth of guitar lessons.\n\nFirst Song: Back In Black by AC/DC\n\nKurt Cobain received his first guitar as a 14th birthday present from an uncle. In his words: “As soon as I got my guitar, I just became so obsessed with it.” Unfortunately, even Cobain himself couldn’t recall the exact model of the guitar he started on.\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown model that was a gift from his uncle.\n\nFirst Band: Unknown, though he’s had a long friendship with a fellow U.K. musician “Passenger”.\n\nHow He Learned: Unknown, but he reportedly started singing in his local church choir at the age of four.\n\nFirst Song: Layla by Eric Clapton\n\nThough he hasn’t spoken much on his first guitar, Ed Sheeran has largely been playing Martin acoustics since his mid-teens. Sheeran has stated that he started recording music in 2005, and even moved to London in 2008 to pursue his career.\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nFirst Guitar: While his first guitar is unknown, he had both a 12-string Takamine as well as an SRV Signature Stratocaster.\n\nFirst Band: Villanova Junction.\n\nHow He Learned: Largely self-taught, though he later enrolled at the Berklee College of Music and received a partial scholarship.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nLike any other Blues guitar player, John Mayer was heavily inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan. In fact, his first electric guitar was actually a used 1996 SRV Stratocaster that he purchased using the money he earned from working in a local gas station.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nFirst Guitar: His father purchased him a $5 acoustic in addition to a Supro Ozark 1560S a year later.\n\nFirst Band: The subject is debated, but it was either the Velvetones or the Rocking Kings.\n\nHow He Learned: Jimi learned by ear in addition to seeking advice from local musicians.\n\nFirst Song: The theme from “Peter Gunn”\n\nArguably the most influential guitar player of all time, Jimi Hendrix has left a legacy that will last as long as rock and roll itself. Starting the guitar at the age of 15, this musician quickly earned a name for himself playing gigs on the chitlin’ circuit until his own career took off in the mid-60s.\n\nJack White\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown\n\nFirst Band: The Upholsters\n\nHow He Learned: Unknown, though it’s incredibly likely he was self taught.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nBorn to a family of ten children, Jack White (birth name John Anthony Gillis) played the instruments abandoned by his older siblings. In interviews, he recounted how he not only played drums, but keyboards/piano in addition to the electric guitar.\n\nAlex Turner\n\nFirst Guitar: An unknown model purchased for him in 2001 by his parents. David Turner, his father, taught music at local schools.\n\nFirst Band: Arctic Monkeys\n\nHow He Learned: In interviews, Alex Turner has said him and Jamie Cook learned chords from an Oasis chord book. \"All I could play was A minor and E minor,\" claims Turner. It’s also rumored his friend Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age) has been making an effort to teach Cook and Turner more advanced lead work.\n\nFirst Song: Reportedly Turner and Cook learned to play the James Bond theme song, and since they learned chords out of an Oasis chord book, it can be assumed they played a handful of Oasis tunes.\n\nThe U.K.’s answer to the Black Keys, the Arctic Monkeys have experienced what can only be described as meteoritic. The band’s front-man, Alex Turner grew up next to the band’s lead guitar player Jamie Cook. The duo actually dropped out of school at 16 to pursue their musical aspirations, and formed the Arctic Monkeys in 2002.\n\nSlash\n\nFirst Guitar: Spanish style with one string, and it reportedly took him a while to figure out how to string it.\n\nFirst Band: Tidus Sloan\n\nHow He Learned: He was located at a local music school for a short time, though he soon abandoned that in favor of teaching himself.\n\nFirst Song: Tangerine by Led Zeppelin\n\nOne of the few men alive who can still rock a top hat, Slash has inspired millions of guitar players around the world. He was also the lead guitar player for Guns N’ Roses, a band that achieved worldwide success in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong\n\nFirst Guitar: Fernandes Stratocaster\n\nFirst Band: Sweet Children\n\nHow He Learned: Guitar lessons.\n\nFirst Song: Look For Love\n\nPunk turned rock and roll superhero, Billie Joe Armstrong is the front-man of the incredibly influential band Green Day. He started playing guitar at age 11 and purchased his first guitar from his teacher. The band’s albums have covered everything from folk and punk to a full-on rock opera, and the group continues to perform sold-out shows all over the country.\n\nEddie Van Halen\n\nFirst Guitar: Hand-Made Frakenstrat.\n\nFirst Band: Genesis (The name was quickly changed to Mammoth).\n\nHow He Learned: Eddie learned by ear, though he had a background in classical music.\n\nFirst Song: Walk Don’t Run by the Ventures\n\nBorn Edward Lodewijk van Halen, this Dutch-born musician is easily one of the most unique guitar players to come out of the 80s. Interestingly, Eddie actually started out as a classic piano player. And like Brian May, Eddie’s first guitar was actually a hand-made instrument that he used as an alternative to purchasing a higher-end (and more expensive) model.\n\nBuckethead\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown\n\nFirst Band: Class-X\n\nHow He Learned: Buckethead took lessons from a wide variety of instructors at his local music store, including Paul Gilbert.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nKnown for his distinctive attire and blazingly fast lead guitar work, Buckethead shreds the guitar in a way no other man (or bucket) can. Though he’s known more for his work in progressive metal, his studio work includes everything ranging from bluegrass to ambient and avant-garde music.\n\nJames Bay\n\nFirst Guitar: Spanish style classical, though he quickly traded up to an Epiphone Les Paul Special II\n\nFirst Band: Performs solo or with backing musicians.\n\nHow He Learned: YouTube videos.\n\nFirst Song: Stand By Me by Ben E King\n\nAn English singer-songwriter, Bay was inspired to play guitar after hearing Eric Clapton’s Layla. Bay is also one of the few musicians who was neither self nor privately taught, instead learning how to play the guitar from YouTube videos.\n\nSt. Vincent\n\nFirst Guitar: Three-Quarter-Sized classical guitar.\n\nFirst Band: Polyphonic Spree\n\nHow She Learned: Guitar lessons.\n\nFirst Song: Aqualung by Jethro Tull\n\nSt. Vincent started playing guitar at the age of twelve, having picked up her first guitar at a local shop. The instrument was sold to her by a man named Tony Hyatt, who she referred to as “a great guitar hero kind of guy”. When she was learning to play the guitar, she started out by learning Jethro Tull songs.\n\nJoe Satriani\n\nFirst Guitar: White Hagstrom III\n\nFirst Band: The Squares\n\nHow He Learned: Self taught, but eventually went on to take lessons from several musical luminaries.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown, though he learned tracks from the Rolling Stones to Johnny Winter off of his family’s record collection by ear prior to pursuing formal music education.\n\nHaving toured with both Mick Jagger and Deep Purple, in addition to having taught Steve Vai and Kirk Hammett, Joe Satriani is arguably the musician who caused the recent generation of “shredder” guitarists. Joe Satriani also studied under jazz guitarist Billy Bauer as well as the reclusive Lennie Tristano.\n\nZakk Wylde\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown, but he did have a 1980s SG Firebrand Deluxe he used throughout his teens.\n\nFirst Band: Stone Henge\n\nHow He Learned: According to various sources Wylde spent 12 hours a day practicing throughout the majority of high-school. He also spent a short amount of time taking classical guitar lessons.\n\nFirst Song: Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple\n\nThe former lead guitar player for Ozzy Osbourne, Zakk Wylde’s career is like something out of a dream. He played local gigs with his first two bands Stone Henge and Zyris, eventually sending in an audition tape to Ozzy Osbourne in 1987. He landed the gig, and was quickly whisked off into a life of fame just two years after graduating high-school.\n\nJoe Bonamassa\n\nFirst Guitar: Yamaha Classical\n\nFirst Band: Smokin’ Joe Bonamassa\n\nHow He Learned: He reportedly started at age four, and though he recounts taking a few lessons in his youth he was largely self-taught.\n\nFirst Song: Further on Up the Road by Bobby “Blue” Bland\n\nJoe Bonamassa is undoubtedly a living guitar god. When he was twelve he opened up for B.B. King as well as gigging around western New York and Pennsylvania. His career didn’t peak there either, between 2002 and 2007 Joe had three different albums that hit #1 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nCarlos Santana\n\nFirst Guitar: Gibson Fully-Hollow Archtop, purchased for him by his father in Tijuana.\n\nFirst Band: Santana Blues Band\n\nHow He Learned: His father was actually his first teacher, though he reportedly honed his craft playing on the streets and in the strip clubs of Tijuana.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nRaised in Tijuana and the son of a mariachi musician, Carlos Santana is easily one of the most flexible guitar players to ever reach widespread acclaim. His music shows not only his South American heritage, but also blends the old-school blues of B.B. King with Jazz and world music.\n\nJoe Perry\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown acoustic model purchased for Perry by his parents between 1961 and 1962.\n\nFirst Band: The Jam Band\n\nHow He Learned: He learned by ear off of records.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nOne of the founding members of Aerosmith, Joe Perry is one of the highest regarded guitarists in all of rock and roll. Though he didn’t come from a musical family (and in fact his first career aspiration was to be a marine biologist), Joe Perry persevered and practiced until he could rock out with the best of them.\n\nMike Campbell\n\nFirst Guitar: Harmony acoustic archtop.\n\nFirst Band: Dead or Alive\n\nHow He Learned: Self-taught with assistance from music education books.\n\nFirst Song: Baby Let Me Follow You Down by Bob Dylan\n\nBest known for his work with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mike Campbell is easily one of the defining voices of Americana guitar. Campbell met Petty through a mutual friend, and the two went on to form the band Mudcrutch. After a disillusioning experience with an L.A. record label, Campbell then went on to join Petty as the lead guitar player in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nJohn Petrucci\n\nFirst Guitar: Cheap acoustic of unknown origin.\n\nFirst Band: Majesty, name later changed to Dream Theater.\n\nHow He Learned: Self-taught for several years though he pursued a more advanced musical education at Berklee College of Music.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nA founding member of the progressive metal band Dream Theater, John Petrucci is arguably one of the most creative guitarists in recent memory. Petrucci has garnered widespread acclaim during his work with Dream Theater, including being named as one of the “Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time” by GuitarOne magazine.\n\nJohnny Marr\n\nFirst Guitar: Cheap guitar (likely a small scale acoustic intended for children) purchased in Manchester in 1967.\n\nFirst Band: Paris Valentinos\n\nHow He Learned: He was largely self-taught, though his mother did assist with his music education in his youth.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nKnown for his distinctive “jangly” guitar tone, Johnny Marr could easily be considered the face of New Wave guitar playing. Like a lot of guitar players, Marr started gigging fairly young. He actually played his first gig at 13 with his band Paris Valentinos.\n\nJ Mascis\n\nFirst Guitar: Fender Jazzmaster\n\nFirst Band: Deep Wound\n\nHow He Learned: Unknown\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nKnown for his work with Dinosaur Jr., J Mascis is often described as one of the main figureheads of grunge. J Mascis has always leaned towards heavier genres of music, and even started gigging with the short-lived hardcore band Deep Wound when he was just 17.\n\nThe Edge\n\nFirst Guitar: “Learner’s” classical guitar.\n\nFirst Band: U2\n\nHow He Learned: The Edge received both guitar and piano lessons at St. Andrew’s National School.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nBorn in Essex, England to a Welsh family, The Edge is best known as the lead guitar player of U2. Always making the effort to innovate, The Edge has experimented with a wide variety of different genres including American roots music, industrial rock, and alternative rock.\n\nDimebag Darrell\n\nFirst Guitar: Hondo Les Paul Copy\n\nFirst Band: Pantera\n\nHow He Learned: Unknown, though considering his father was a fairly well-known country musician (Jerry Abbott), he likely had some influence on his son’s musical education.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nLike a lot of guitar players, Dimebag picked up the instrument at a fairly young age. Though he first wanted a BMX bike, his parents purchased a Hondo Les Paul copy for him when he was twelve. The young Darrell then went on to win a series of local guitar competitions and was eventually awarded a Dean ML. In fact, he was actually banned from competing in local contests because of how advanced his skills were.\n\nBB King\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown model that he either purchased on his own for $15.00 or was purchased for him by blues legend Bukka White.\n\nFirst Band: Famous St. John’s\n\nHow He Learned: He was self-taught.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nBorn the son of sharecroppers, B.B. King was a titan of American blues music. Though he came from incredibly humble origins, his records would go on to inspire almost every blues musician that followed him. And though the man may not be with us anymore, the legacy of extreme kindness and generosity in addition to an excellent body of work he’s left behind will ensure that he’s never forgotten.\n\nSteve Vai\n\nFirst Guitar: Unknown instrument purchased from childhood friend Richard Jankowski for $5 dollars.\n\nFirst Band: The Ohio Express\n\nHow He Learned: He was self-taught for his first year as a guitar player and then he went on to take lessons from Joe Satriani.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nBorn in Carle Place, New York, Steve Vai has proven himself to be an extraordinary guitarist. At 19, he mailed Frank Zappa a complete transcription of Zappa’s “The Black Page” along with a tape of his playing. He was then hired by Zappa to transcribe a number of his songs, a job which later led to Vai being invited to become a full member of the band.\n\nJimmy Page\n\nFirst Guitar: Futurama Grazioso\n\nFirst Band: The Crusaders\n\nHow He Learned: Page took a few lessons in Kingston, but he was largely self-taught.\n\nFirst Song: Unknown\n\nThe Godfather of modern rock, Jimmy Page has inspired guitarists ranging from Johnny Ramone to Brian May.
