        "text": "Not to say this only because she is dead but i honestly think she is not just a great artist but the greatest female artist ever. And when I say one, I don’t mean top 10, I mean top 3. Everything she has done in the short span of her career has been the greatest ever. With just her singles, she turned the world upside down. Back to black and rehab continue to have a significant influence on music today. The impact and longevity of her career are still evident in 2022.\n\nI find it to be one of the most amazing things ever that her music is still getting more sales and streams than ever even if she is dead. Another thing Amy Winehouse did with her music that not a lot of artists can say now is that everything you hear she created and produced. I mean everything. She had a huge part in composing her music and she wrote every single song in her albums. Even in her debut album, all the songs were written, composed, and performed by her alone.\n\nDespite her young age, she had a very soulful voice. In my opinion she is the queen of soul. Im not saying this to compare 2 amazing female vocalists. However, i do feel like she had more soul in her voice then Aretha Franklin, and Whitney Houston…Am I saying she could sing better then them 2 ? No, what I am saying is that her voice told a story, and told a better story than Whitney or Aretha.\n\nBefore anybody says thats racist because thats how some of yall do its just a fact that she had more soul in her voice than the great. They had the technique, but she had that EMOTION. And let’s not ignore her voice yet, because her voice is very powerful. First of all she is a contralto, and that alone should tell you a lot.\n\nEven when she was a contralto she had range, heavy range too. I feel that she could reach lower notes with more ease than she could reach the 3rd octave. She could support notes all the way to the 6th octave too. That’s impressive. Her voice was not silky, but it was still warm, and she had a very dark ring to her voice.\n\nHer voice is comparable to a smoother version of Billie Holiday. She took a lot of inspiration from Janis Joplin, and in my opinion she was a better singer than Amy Winehouse. She set the standard for the female industry. In terms of her debut album, her second album and ultimately, her last album, she certainly left a huge impression on a lot of the female musicians that we have now when it comes to their music."
