        "text": "Amy Winehouse, the beehived soul-jazz diva whose self-destructive habits overshadowed a distinctive musical talent, was found dead Saturday in her London home, police said. She was 27.\n\nWinehouse shot to fame with the album \"Back to Black,\" whose blend of jazz, soul, rock and classic pop was a global hit. It won five Grammys and made Winehouse - with her black beehive hairdo and old-fashioned sailor tattoos - one of music's most recognizable stars.\n\nPolice confirmed that a 27-year-old female was pronounced dead at the home in Camden Square northern London; the cause of death was not immediately known. London Ambulance Services said Winehouse had died before the two ambulance crews it sent arrived at the scene.\n\n\"I didn't go out looking to be famous,\" Winehouse told the Associated Press when \"Back to Black\" was released. \"I'm just a musician.\"\n\nBut in the end, the music was overshadowed by fame, and by Winehouse's demons. Tabloids lapped up the erratic stage appearances, drunken fights, stints in hospital and rehab clinics. Performances became shambling, stumbling train wrecks, watched around the world on the Internet.\n\nBorn in 1983 to taxi driver Mitch Winehouse and his pharmacist wife Janis, Winehouse grew up in the north London suburbs, and was set on a showbiz career from an early age. When she was 10, she and a friend formed a rap group, Sweet 'n' Sour - Winehouse was Sour - that she later described as \"the little white Jewish Salt 'n' Pepa.\"\n\nShe attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, a factory for British music and acting moppets, later went to the Brit School, a performing arts academy in the \"Fame\" mold, and was originally signed to \"Pop Idol\" svengali Simon Fuller's 19 Management.\n\nBut Winehouse was never a packaged teen star, and always resisted being pigeonholed.\n\nHer jazz-influenced 2003 debut album, \"Frank,\" was critically praised and sold well in Britain. It earned Winehouse an Ivor Novello songwriting award, two Brit nominations and a spot on the shortlist for the Mercury Music Prize.\n\nBut Winehouse soon expressed dissatisfaction with the disc, saying she was \"only 80 percent behind\" the album.\n\n\"Frank\" was followed by a slump during which Winehouse broke up with her boyfriend, suffered a long period of writer's block and, she later said, smoked a lot of marijuana.\n\n\"I had writer's block for so long,\" she said in 2007. \"And as a writer, your self-worth is literally based on the last thing you wrote. .. I used to think, 'What happened to me?'\n\n\"At one point it had been two years since the last record and (the record company) actually said to me, 'Do you even want to make another record?' I was like, 'I swear it's coming.' I said to them, 'Once I start writing I will write and write and write. But I just have to start it.'\"\n\nThe album she eventually produced was a sensation.\n\nReleased in Britain in the fall of 2006, \"Back to Black\" brought Winehouse global fame. Working with producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi and soul-funk group the Dap-Kings, Winehouse fused soul, jazz, doo-wop and, above all, a love of the girl-groups of the early 1960s with lyrical tales of romantic obsession and emotional excess.\n\n\"Back to Black\" was released in the United States in March 2007 and went on to win five Grammy awards, including song and record of the year for \"Rehab.\"\n\nMusic critic John Aizlewood attributed her trans-Atlantic success to a fantastic voice and a genuinely original sound.\n\n\"A lot of British bands fail in America because they give America something Americans do better - that's why most British hip-hop has failed,\" he said. \"But they won't have come across anything quite like Amy Winehouse.\"\n\nWinehouse's rise was helped by her distinctive look - black beehive of hair, thickly lined cat eyes, girly tattoos - and her tart tongue.\n\nShe was famously blunt in her assessment of her peers, once describing Dido's sound as \"background music - the background to death\" and saying of pop princess Kylie Minogue, \"she's not an artist ... she's a pony.\"\n\nThe songs on \"Black to Black\" detailed breakups and breakdowns with a similar frankness. Lyrically, as in life, Winehouse wore her heart on her sleeve.\n\n\"I listen to a lot of '60s music, but society is different now,\" Winehouse said in 2007. \"I'm a young woman and I'm going to write about what I know.\"\n\nEven then, Winehouse's performances were sometimes shambolic, and she admitted she is \"a terrible drunk.\"\n\nIncreasingly, her personal life began to overshadow her career.\n\nShe acknowledged struggling with eating disorders and told a newspaper that she had been diagnosed as manic depressive but refused to take medication. Soon accounts of her erratic behavior, canceled concerts and drink- and drug-fueled nights began to multiply.\n\nPhotographs caught her unsteady on her feet or vacant-eyed, and she appeared unhealthily thin, with scabs on her face and marks on her arms.\n\nThere were embarrassing videos released to the world on the Internet. One showed an addled Winehouse and Babyshambles singer Pete Doherty playing with newborn mice. Another, for which Winehouse apologized, showed her singing a racist ditty to the tune of a children's song.\n\nWinehouse's managers went to increasingly desperate lengths to keep the wayward star on the straight and narrow. Before a June 2011 concert in Belgrade - the first stop on a planned European comeback tour - her hotel was stripped of booze. It did no good,\n\nAn addled Winehouse swayed and slurred her way through barely recognizable songs, as her band played gamely and the audience jeered and booed.\n\nWinehouse flew home. Her management canceled the tour, saying Winehouse would take sine time off to recover.\n\nThough she was often reported to be working on new material, fans got tired of waiting for the much-promised followup to \"Back to Black.\"\n\nOccasional bits of recording saw the light of day. Her rendition of The Zutons' \"Valerie\" was a highlight of producer Mark Ronson's 2007 album \"Version,\" and she recorded the pop classic \"It's My Party\" for the 2010 Quincy Jones album \"Q: Soul Bossa Nostra.\"\n\nBut other recording projects with Ronson, one of the architects of the success of \"Back to Black,\" came to nothing.\n\nShe also had run-ins with the law. In April 2008, Winehouse was cautioned by police for assault after she slapped a man during a raucous night out.\n\nThe same year she was investigated by police, although not charged, after a tabloid newspaper published a video that appeared to show her smoking crack cocaine.\n\nIn 2010, Winehouse pleaded guilty to assaulting a theater manager who asked her to leave a family Christmas show because she'd had too much to drink. She was given a fine and a warning to stay out of trouble by a judge who praised her for trying to clean up her act.\n\nIn May 2007 in Miami, she married music industry hanger-on Blake Fielder-Civil, but the honeymoon was brief. That November, Fielder-Civil was arrested for an attack on a pub manager the year before. Fielder-Civil later pleaded guilty to assaulting barman James King and then offering him 200,000 pounds (US$400,000) to keep quiet about it.\n\nWinehouse stood by \"my Blake\" throughout his trial, often blowing kisses at him from the court's public gallery and wearing a heart-shaped pin labeled \"Blake\" in her hair at concerts. But British newspapers reported extramarital affairs while Fielder-Civil was behind bars.\n\nThey divorced in 2009.\n\nWinehouse's health often appeared fragile. In June 2008 and again in April 2010, she was taken to hospital and treated for injuries after fainting and falling at home.\n\nHer father said she had developed the lung disease emphysema from smoking cigarettes and crack, although her spokeswoman later said Winehouse only had \"early signs of what could lead to emphysema.\"\n\nShe left the hospital to perform at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday concert in Hyde Park in June 2008, and at the Glastonbury festival the next day, where she received a rousing reception but scuffled with a member of the crowd. Then it was back to a London clinic for treatment, continuing the cycle of music, excess and recuperation that marked her career."
