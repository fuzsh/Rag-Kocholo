Female musicians are no longer a rarity but rather the norm.\n\nIn the next few years, we can expect more female guitarists in rock bands or solo performers who craft their own songs and release albums. However, as for famous female guitarists from the past or present, you may struggle to name more than three or four; if any at all. Why's that? Because the music industry has been male-dominated for years.\n\nWhile we all know and love famous male guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, or Santana, but, are you familiar with the talent of female guitarists such as Kaki King, Jennifer Batten, Joan Jett, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, or Nita Strauss?\n\nWithout further delay, in today's article, with the purpose of improving everyone's musical culture, let's take a look at the most recognisable and talented female guitarists of all time along with some of their classic sound styles and their unique musical work.\n\nSearch for guitar lessons here on superprof\n\nThe best Guitar tutors available\n\n5 (50 reviews)\n\nKieran\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (47 reviews)\n\nAndy\n\n£34\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (51 reviews)\n\nChristina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (24 reviews)\n\nMathew\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (29 reviews)\n\nDespina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nRussell\n\n£40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (13 reviews)\n\nElias\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (44 reviews)\n\nMartin\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (50 reviews)\n\nKieran\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (47 reviews)\n\nAndy\n\n£34\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (51 reviews)\n\nChristina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (24 reviews)\n\nMathew\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (29 reviews)\n\nDespina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nRussell\n\n£40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (13 reviews)\n\nElias\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (44 reviews)\n\nMartin\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nJennifer Batten\n\nTalented and passionate, Jennifer Batten made a name for herself by becoming the official guitarist for Mickael Jackson World Tours in the 1990s. Batten only worked for Jackson throughout the 90s but this was enough to create a name for herself and established a lucrative career.\n\nAs we know, Michael Jackson was known for his energetic dance solos that were accompanied by loud tunes and legendary guitar solos such as the one from the song Beat It. Jennifer Batten mastered the Beat It solo among others and became a noteworthy person in the world of music.\n\nHistory will know Batten as a pioneer in the world of rock'n'roll. In a male-dominated field, Jennifer Batten was able to break through and find success. She is a great example for female guitarists today since she is seen as a trailblazer.\n\nIn 1998, she was also found on Jeff Beck's tours and during his studio sessions. At age 64, Batten continues to play the guitar.\n\nOrianthi Panagaris\n\nTalent and passion for the guitar at a young age are necessary if you are to be successful and that is the case with Orianthi Panagaris. She joined the Alice Cooper group for three years at a very young age. Because of her impressive resume of jamming with well-known guitar players and her great playing abilities, she was selected by Michael Jackson for the This Is It World Tour. Unfortunately, the King of Pop died before the world tour started.\n\nPanagaris, from Australia, is only 37 years old and still continues to perform songs in front of large audiences today. Experts appreciate Orianthi's talent because she knows how to do everything from playing other bands' music to composing and collaborating with other virtuoso guitarists such as Steve Vai.\n\nOrianthi is a talent to be reckoned with and her career will continue to blossom in the years to come.\n\nKaori Muraji\n\nWhile the two previously mentioned artists specialise in the genre of rock n roll, Kaori Muraji is a Japanese classical guitarist. She has gained worldwide recognition and has produced multiple albums that showcase her impressive talent.\n\nKaori Muraji signed with British record label Decca Records (the notorious recording label that turned down The Beatles when they first auditioned). She started the guitar at the age of three and took regular classes. She was supported to pursue her talent by her father and she made her professional debut at the age of 15 by releasing her first album that showcased her work.\n\nShe retired from the world of recording music in 2010. Nonetheless, she is still very open to making appearances at venues, lectures, and concerts. Kaori Muraji has left an important legacy for classical guitarists, but also for women who are considering the option of following their dreams to become professional guitarists in jazz, blues, rock, or classical music.\n\nLearn about good guitar lessons here.\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nWhile not solely known as a guitarist but rather as one of the best female acoustic singers of all time, Joni Mitchell's songs were often accompanied by her playing the guitar. Her talent for singing, songwriting, and playing the acoustic guitar is noteworthy.\n\nMany musical experts have commented that Joni Mitchell's sound was truly unique and that she created her own style of music while composing and jamming out on her guitar.\n\nMitchell is in her late 70s now but she still continues to be one of music's biggest stars and best female guitarists. Mitchell's guitar melodies are learned by thousands of new guitar players every year.\n\nThe best Guitar tutors available\n\n5 (50 reviews)\n\nKieran\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (47 reviews)\n\nAndy\n\n£34\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (51 reviews)\n\nChristina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (24 reviews)\n\nMathew\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (29 reviews)\n\nDespina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nRussell\n\n£40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (13 reviews)\n\nElias\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (44 reviews)\n\nMartin\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (50 reviews)\n\nKieran\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (47 reviews)\n\nAndy\n\n£34\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (51 reviews)\n\nChristina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (24 reviews)\n\nMathew\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (29 reviews)\n\nDespina\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nRussell\n\n£40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (13 reviews)\n\nElias\n\n£30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (44 reviews)\n\nMartin\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nGabriela Quintero\n\nWidely known and loved in Mexico, you may have heard of Gabriela Quintero from the famous duo Rodrigo y Gabriela.

Gabriela is recognized for her perseverance, her high standards, her fluidity, and her precision with both the right and left hands.
