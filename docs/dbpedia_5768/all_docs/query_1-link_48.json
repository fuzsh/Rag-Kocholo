        "text": "Almost lost amidst the predictable jokes that she should have gone to “Rehab,” the Internet preaching about how she brought it on herself and the eerie significance of another musician dead at 27 is the fact that Amy Winehouse was an incredibly talented young woman.\n\nHer death on Saturday was shocking, not because it was necessarily unexpected given her lifestyle and history, but because here was another artist taken from us far too soon.\n\n?Beneath the tattoos, the hair, the disheveled public appearances, the tabloid headlines, the legal issues and the drug scandals was a singer and songwriter who delivered one of the best albums of the last decade and who made a major impact on the neo-soul/blues movement so prevalent on the charts today.\n\nA singer and songwriter who, under different circumstances, could have been one of the all-time greats.\n\n“You go back to her, and I go back to black,” she sang on the title track of her 2006 breakthrough album, “Back to Black.” A seemingly simple line, but incredibly powerful, given what we know now.\n\n\"She was a wordsmith. When people have that incredible ability to write songs that affect people, it's a rare quality,\" said Fairless Hills native Sue Mansour, lead singer of Philadelphia rock band Soraia. \"She did something that wasn't so safe. These weren't standard pop songs she was doing. But she broke through in that market and had a voice that fit what she was doing.\"\n\nWinehouse's death hit especially hard for Mansour, who has struggled with addiction herself in the past.\n\n\"I've been really upset with the horrible things people have been saying about her on Facebook,\" Mansour said. \"They've been really disrespectful. You can't really judge somebody without knowing them.\"\n\nPerhaps no performer was as obviously — and proudly — influenced by Winehouse as fellow Brit Adele, who succeeded her as best new artist winner at the 2009 Grammy Awards. The “Rolling in the Deep” singer shared her thoughts about Winehouse on her website in a blog post titled “Amy Flies in Paradise.”\n\n“Amy paved the way for artists like me and made people excited about British music again whilst being fearlessly hilarious and blasé about the whole thing,” Adele wrote. “I don’t think she ever realized just how brilliant she was and how important she is, but that just makes her even more charming.\n\n“Although I’m incredibly sad about Amy passing I’m also reminded of how immensely proud of her I am, as well and grateful to be inspired by her.”\n\nAdele also commented on Winehouse’s lyrics, which cut to your core even if you weren’t a 20-something woman coping with drug and alcohol problems.\n\n“We believed every word she wrote, and it would sink in deep when she sang them,” Adele wrote.\n\nNewtown's Gina Sicilia, a talented young blues singer who recently released her third album, \"Can't Control Myself,\" is another artist obviously influenced by Winehouse. The album includes an original song, \"Addicted,\" that could have been written about Winehouse (although it wasn't).\n\n\"She definitely inspired me,\" said Sicilia, 26. \"Amy essentially started a new trend and brought British neo-soul to the mainstream. She paved the way for Adele, Duffy and inspired so many other artists, myself included.\n\n\"I think it's so sad and tragic that such a phenomenal talent like her was a victim of her own demons. It's tragic that she didn't get help or couldn't be helped. But I hope people remember her for her talent, and not the other stuff. I hope she leaves behind a positive legacy and that years from now, even after such a short career, people remember her for her music and talent. I hope they don't look back and remember her for her drug problems.\"\n\nCertainly, her musical resume is a solid one. Grammy voters often don’t get it right, but they did (almost) in 2008, when Winehouse won five of the six categories for which she was nominated, including best new artist, best pop vocal album for “Back to Black” and record and song of the year for “Rehab.”\n\n“Back to Black” also deserved album of the year, losing to Herbie Hancock’s “River: The Joni Letters” in one of the biggest surprises of the night. Still, Winehouse had become only the fifth woman to win five Grammys in a single night and the first British woman to do so, and, after her memorable, sultry performance from a remote stage in England that night (visa issues prevented her from attending the ceremony in Los Angeles), you had to think — perhaps naively — that things were looking up.\n\nInstead, the Grammys turned out to be the peak of a career that had begun with so much promise. Before “Back to Black,” she earned widespread critical acclaim in Britain for her 2003 debut album, “Frank.”\n\nSoon, though, the music became the last thing people wanted to talk about when it came to Winehouse. But her music is the gift that she has left to the world, and that — not the tabloid fodder — should be her legacy.\n\nIn the days since her death, famous friends and collaborators have spoken out to remind the world of her talent.\n\nTony Bennett was the last person to work with her, recording the pop standard “Body and Soul” with Winehouse at Abbey Road Studios in London in March.\n\n“She was an extraordinary musician with a rare intuition as a vocalist and I am truly devastated that her exceptional talent has come to such an early end,” he said in a statement to Us Weekly. “She was a lovely and intelligent person, and when we recorded together she gave a soulful and extraordinary performance.”\n\nBritish actor/comedian Russell Brand, who has dealt with substance abuse issues himself, wrote on his website that Winehouse “wasn’t just some hapless wannabe, yet another pissed-up nit who was never gonna make it, nor was she even a 10-a-penny chanteuse enjoying her 15 minutes. She was an (expletive) genius.”\n\nYou can argue with the “genius” label but you can’t dismiss her talent, and Internet posters ridiculing her inclusion in the dead-at-27 music club (Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain) are short-changing Winehouse as an artist.\n\nAll of those other musicians are remembered far more for their talent than their substance-abuse issues, and that, too, is how the world should remember Amy Winehouse — not as some kind of a tabloid freak show but as a young woman who managed to create a small but impressive catalog of music during her too-short, too-troubled time on earth.\n\n\"She was a perfect example of a suffering artist,\" Mansour said. \"To be able to share that suffering is rare, but she shared her pain, which was a gift to a lot of people.\n\n\"It's really upsetting. It could have happened to me, could have happened to a lot of people. But maybe she's at peace now. She certainly wasn't here. Either way, she was an amazing artist.\"\n\nAndy Vineberg can be reached at 215-949-4135 or avineberg@phillyburbs.com. Follow Andy on Twitter at advineberg"
