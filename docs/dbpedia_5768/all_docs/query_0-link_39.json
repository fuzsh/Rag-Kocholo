        "text": "It's been more than five years since Amy Winehouse's biopic was first announced, and now the first teaser for the Sam Taylor-Johnson-directed film has arrived.\n\nCalled Back to Black, named after the famed singer's breakthrough 2006 album, the film has the blessing of the Winehouse estate, and will be released in April.\n\nThe biopic, which tells the story of the Grammy award-winning musical sensation, who tragically died in 2011 from alcohol poising, aged 27, is being written by Matt Greenhalgh, directed by Taylor-Johnson and produced by Alison Owen, Debra Hayward and Tracey Seaward on behalf of Studiocanal. And taking on the titular role? None other than Industry breakout star, Marisa Abela.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Amy Winehouse upcoming biopic Back to Black:\n\nWhat is the Amy Winehouse Back to Black film about?\n\nBack to Black will look at the life of North London-born singer Winehouse, who started off by making a name for herself in the world of jazz, before rising to Grammy award-winning status, with hit songs such as 'Rehab' and, of course, 'Back to Black'.\n\nThat's before she tragically died in her late twenties, after an arduous battle with drugs and alcohol.\n\nIs the Amy Winehouse Back to Black the first feature film to be produced?\n\nYes. While Hollywood has tried to tell her story with myriad projects having been partially dreamt up, including one from Lotus Entertainment with Noomi Rapace, none have moved forward.\n\nThe 2015 critically acclaimed A24 documentary Amy, however, won an Oscar.\n\nWho will play Amy Winehouse in the Back to Black film?\n\nAs per Deadline, numerous actors auditioned for the coveted part of playing Winehouse, but it was Abela who 'blew away execs and Taylor-Johnson' from the get-go. Abela is best known for her breakout role in BBC hit Industry, and her cameo in Greta Gerwig's 2023 film, Barbie.\n\nThe first images from Back To Black, which began filming in London in January 2023 showed Abela looking like the spitting image of Amy Winehouse. The actor is seen with Winehouse's signature 'beehive' hairstyle, gold hoop earrings and tattoos in a recreation of one of the late singer's most recognisable photos.\n\nAbela also posted her own tribute to Amy Winehouse via Instagram, including photos of her standing beside a gigantic mural of the late singer and a close-up of her in costume wearing Winehouse's signature chunky gold jewellery (and lip piercing). The actor captioned the post: '“And for London. This is for London. Cause Camden Town ain’t burnin down”. I love you, Amy. ❤️'\n\nWho will star in the Amy Winehouse in the Back to Black film?\n\nStarring alongside Abela in the film are Lesley Manville, who stars as Amy’s grandmother, Cynthia (whose name was inked on her right arm), and Jack O’Connell, who plays Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy's husband from 2007-2009.\n\nWhat other films has Sam Taylor-Johnson worked on?\n\nBritish filmmaker Taylor-Johnson is known for helping build the Fifty Shades franchise, which includes Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.\n\nShe directed the first film, which after 10 days dominated the UK box office, having grossed £25.24m and overtaking the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street (£22.70m) for the biggest 18 certificate film at the time.\n\nIn recent years, she worked on drama thriller series Gypsy and solely directed psychological drama A Million Little Pieces. She was also behind two episodes of last year's sci-fi fantasy drama Solos, of which starred Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway and Helen Mirren.\n\nWhat is Amy Winehouse best known for?\n\nThe singer catapulted to superstardom status after her multi Grammy Award-winning album Back to Black.\n\nHer distinctive jazz voice mesmerised many, and she was known for singing about her intense love life.\n\nAs much as she was known for her indigenous talent, her turbulent life, which heavily involved drugs and alcohol, was all over the media.\n\nHer tragic death left her fans heartbroken."
