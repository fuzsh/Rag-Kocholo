Many are accomplished vocalists, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists as well. Since female guitarists aren’t featured as prominently as men because there are fewer of them, it’s important to highlight a few extraordinary guitar players who happen to be women.\n\nEach one includes information, a video and a link to the artist’s website. The list is not in any particular order. It is also not a complete list as there are so many great female musicians past and present that all of them simply could not be included. Your suggestions are welcomed.\n\nIf you’re interested in ‘Women Who Shaped the Blues’ see the article here.\n\nBonnie Raitt\n\nMore than a bestselling artist and highly respected blues, roots, Americana guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, Bonnie Raitt is an institution in American music.
