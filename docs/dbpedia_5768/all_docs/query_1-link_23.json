        "text": "When Amy Winehouse released Back To Black in October 2006, it was a sonic revelation. The beehive-wearing singer’s second full-length blended modern themes with the Shangri-Las sound, crafting something that seemed at once both effortlessly timeless and perfectly timed.\n\nKicking off with smash single \"Rehab\" before blasting into swinging bangers like \"Me & Mr. Jones,\" \"Love Is A Losing Game,\" and \"You Know I’m No Good,\" Black To Black has sold over 16 million copies worldwide to date and is the 12th best-selling record of all time in the United Kingdom. It was nominated for six GRAMMY Awards and won five: Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Pop Vocal Album.\n\nWinehouse accepted her golden gramophones via remote link from London due to visa problems. At the time, Winehouse set the record for the most GRAMMYs won by a female British artist in a single year, though that record has since been broken by Adele, who won six in 2011.\n\nWritten in the wake of a break-up with on-again, off-again flame Blake Fielder-Civil, Black To Black explores heartbreak, grief, and infidelity, as well as substance abuse, isolation, and various traumas. Following her death in 2011, Back To Black became Winehouse’s most enduring legacy. It remains a revealingly soulful message in a bottle, floating forever on the waves.\n\nWith the May 17 release of Sam Taylor-Johnson’s new (and questionably crafted) Winehouse biopic, also titled Back To Black, it's the perfect time to reflect on the album that not only charmed listeners but changed the state of a lot of popular music over the course of just 11 songs. Here are five ways that Back To Black influenced music today.\n\nShe Heralded The Arrival Of The Alt Pop Star\n\nWhen Amy Winehouse hit the stage, people remarked on her big voice. She had classic, old-time torch singer pipes, like Sarah Vaughn or Etta Jones, capable of belting out odes to lost love, unrequited dreams, and crushing breakups. And while those types of singers had been around before Winehouse, they didn’t always get the chance — or grace required — to make their kind of music, with labels and producers often seeking work that was more poppy, hook-packed, or modern.\n\nThe success of Back To Black changed that, with artists like Duffy, Adele, and even Lady Gaga drawing more eyes in the wake of Winehouse’s overwhelming success. Both Duffy and Adele released their debut projects in 2007, the year after Back To Black, bringing their big, British sound to the masses. Amy Winehouse's look and sound showed other aspiring singers that they could be different and transgressive without losing appeal.\n\nBefore she signed to Interscope in 2007, \"nobody knew who I was and I had no fans, no record label,\" Gaga told Rolling Stone in 2011. \"Everybody, when they met me, said I wasn’t pretty enough or that my voice was too low or strange. They had nowhere to put me. And then I saw [Amy Winehouse] in Rolling Stone and I saw her live. I just remember thinking ‘well, they found somewhere to put Amy…’\"\n\nIf an artist like Winehouse — who was making records and rocking styles that seemed far outside the norm — could break through, then who’s to say someone else as bold or brassy wouldn’t do just as well?\n\nIt Encouraged Other Torch Singers In The New Millenium\n\nBack To Black might have sounded fun, with swinging cuts about saying \"no\" to rehab and being bad news that could seem lighthearted to the casual listener. Dig a little deeper, though, and it’s clear Winehouse is going through some real romantic tumult.\n\nBefore Back To Black was released, Fielder-Civil had left Winehouse to get back together with an old girlfriend, and singer felt that she needed to create something good out of all those bad feelings. Songs like \"Love Is A Losing Game\" and \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" speak to her fragile emotional state during the making of the record, and to how much she missed Fielder-Civil. The two would later marry, though the couple divorced in 2009.\n\nToday, young pop singers like Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, and Selena Gomez are lauded for their songs about breakups, boyfriends, and the emotional damage inflicted by callous lovers. While Winehouse certainly wasn’t the first to sing about a broken heart, she was undoubtedly one of the best.\n\nIt Created A Bit Of Ronsonmania\n\nThough Mark Ronson was already a fairly successful artist and producer in his own right before he teamed with Winehouse to write and co-produce much of Back To Black, his cred was positively stratospheric after the album's release. Though portions of Back To Black were actually produced by Salaam Remi (who’d previously worked with Winehouse on Frank and who was reportedly working on a follow-up album with her at the time of her death), Ronson got the lion’s share of credit for the record’s sound — perhaps thanks to his his GRAMMY win for Best Pop Vocal Album. Winehouse would even go on to guest on his own Version record, which featured the singer's ever-popular cover of \"Valerie.\"\n\nIn the years that followed, Ronson went on to not only produce and make his own funky, genre-bending records, but also to work with acts like Adele, ASAP Rocky, and Paul McCartney, all of whom seemingly wanted a little of the retro soul Ronson could bring. He got huge acclaim for the funk-pop boogie cut \"Uptown Funk,\" which he wrote and released under his own name with help from Bruno Mars, and has pushed into film as well, writing and producing over-the-top tracks like A Star Is Born’s \"Shallow\" and Barbie’s \"I’m Just Ken.\" To date, he’s been nominated for 17 GRAMMY Awards, winning eight.\n\nRonson has always acknowledged Winehouse’s role in his success, as well, telling \"BBC Breakfast\" in 2010, \"I've always been really candid about saying that Amy is the reason I am on the map. If it wasn't for the success of Back To Black, no one would have cared too much about Version.\"\n\nAmy Showcased The Artist As An Individual\n\nWhen the GRAMMY Museum hosted its \"Beyond Black - The Style of Amy Winehouse\" exhibit in 2020, Museum Curator and Director of Exhibitions Nicholas Vega called the singer's sartorial influence \"undeniable.\" Whether it was her beehive, her bold eyeliner, or her fitted dresses, artists and fans had adopted elements of Winehouse’s Back To Black style into their own fashion repertoire. And though it’s the look we associate most with Winehouse, it was actually one she had truly developed while making the record, amping up her Frank-era low-slung jeans, tank tops, and polo shirts with darker eyeliner and much bigger hair, as well as flirty dresses, vibrant bras, and heels.\n\n\"Her stylist and friends were influential in helping her develop her look, but ultimately Amy took bits and pieces of trends and styles that she admired to create her own look,\" Vega told GRAMMY.com in 2020. While rock ‘n’ rollers have always leaned into genre-bending styles, Winehouse’s grit is notable in the pop world, where artists typically have a bit more of a sheen. These days, artists like Miley Cyrus, Billie Eillish, and Demi Lovato are willing to let their fans see a bit more of the grit — thanks, no doubt, to the doors Winehouse opened.\n\nWinehouse also opened the door to the beauty salon and the tattoo studio, pushing boundaries with not just her 14 different vintage-inspired tattoos — which have become almost de rigeur these days in entertainment — but also with her signature beehive-like bouffant, which hadn’t really been seen on a popular artist since the ‘60s.It’s a frequent look for contemporary pop divas, popping up on artists like Ariana Grande, Lana Del Rey, and Dua Lipa.\n\nThe Dap-Kings Got The Flowers They Deserved\n\nSix of Back To Black’s 11 songs, including \"Rehab,\" got their \"retro\" sound via backing from the Dap-Kings, a Brooklyn-based soul act Ronson recruited for the project.\n\nWhile Winehouse’s lyrics were mostly laid down in London, the Dap-Kings did their parts in New York. Ronson told GRAMMY.com in 2023 that the Dap-Kings \"brought ['Rehab'] to life,\" saying, \"I felt like I was floating because I couldn’t believe anybody could still make that drum sound in 2006.\" Winehouse and the Dap-Kings met months later after the record was released, and recorded \"Valerie.\" The band later backed Winehouse on her U.S. tour.\n\nThough the Dap-Kings were known in hip musical circles for their work with late-to-success soul sensation Sharon Jones, Back To Black’s immense success buoyed the listening public’s interest in soul music and the Dap-Kings' own profile (not to mention that of their label, Daptone Records).\n\n\"Soul music never went away and soul lovers never went away, but they’re just kind of closeted because they didn’t think it was commercially viable,\" Dap-Kings guitarist Binky Griptite said in the book It Ain't Retro: Daptone Records & The 21st Century Soul Revolution. \"Then, when Amy’s record hit, all the undercover soul fans are like, I’m free. And then that’s when everybody’s like, Oh, there’s money in it now.\"\n\nThe success of Back To Black also seems to have firmly cemented the Dap-Kings in Ronson’s Rolodex, with the group’s drummer Homer Steinweiss, multi-instrumentalist Leon Michaels, trumpeter Dave Guy, and guitarist/producer Tom Brenneck appearing on many of his projects; the Dap-Kings' horns got prominent placement in \"Uptown Funk.\"\n\nAmy Exposed The Darker Side Of Overwhelming Success\n\nFour years after Winehouse died, a documentary about her life was released. Asif Kapadia’s Amy became an instant rock-doc classic, detailing not only Winehouse’s upbringing, but also her struggles with fame and addiction. It won 30 awards after release, including Best Documentary Feature at the 88th Academy Awards and Best Music Film at the 58th GRAMMY Awards.\n\nIt also made a lot of people angry — not for how it portrayed Winehouse, but for how she was made to feel, whether by the British press or by people she considered close. The film documented Winehouse’s struggles with bulimia, self-harm, and depression, and left fans and artists alike feeling heartbroken all over again about the singer’s passing.\n\nThe documentary also let fans in on what life was really like for Winehouse, and potentially for other artists in the public eye. British rapper Stormzy summed it up well in 2016 when he told i-D, \"I saw the [documentary, Amy] – it got me flipping angry... [Amy’s story] struck a chord with me in the sense that, as a creative, it looks like on the outside, that it’s very ‘go studio, make a hit, go and perform it around the world, champagne in the club, loads of girls’. But the graft and the emotional strain of being a musician is very hard. No one ever sees that part.\"\n\nThese days, perhaps because of Winehouse’s plight or documentaries like Amy, the music-loving population seems far more inclined to give their favorite singers a little grace, whether it’s advocating for the end of Britney Spears’ conservatorship or sympathizing with Demi Lovato’s personal struggles. Even the biggest pop stars are still people, and Amy really drove that point home.\n\nWe Only Said Goodbye With Words: Remembering Amy Winehouse 10 Years Later\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy has announced a series of exhibits for 2024 at the Paley Museum in New York City, the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles, and the Gary Nader Art Centre in Miami.\n\n\"For 25 years we have had the immense privilege of celebrating excellence in Latin music, accompanying our music creators in their successes worldwide.

We are thrilled to bring together art and music in such a dynamic fashion, highlighting the synergy between these two powerful expressions of creativity,\" said Gary Nader, founder of the Gary Nader Art Centre.\n\nThe Latest News About Latin Music\n\nLos Lonely Boys Resurrected: The Sibling Rockers Talk Their New Album, Return To The Road & Family Magic\n\nOn 'Mirada,' Ivan Cornejo Redefines The Sound Of Sad Sierreño And Helps Fans Heal Through Music\n\n7 Artists Bringing Reggaeton Mexa To The World: El Malilla, Bellakath & More\n\nRevisiting 'Re': How Café Tacvba’s 1994 Masterpiece Changed Mexican Music Forever\n\nThe Latin Recording Academy Announces 2024 Special Awards Recipients: Los Ángeles Azules, Draco Rosa, Albita, Lolita Flores & More\n\nIn 2005, South Korean producer and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk (aka \"hitman\" Bang) founded Bit Hit Entertainment. Only eight years later, he finished assembling what would come to be the label’s groundbreaking boy group, BTS. The rest is history, now chronicled in \"HYBE: We Believe In Music,\" the first full-floor K-pop exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum, which runs through Sept. 15.\n\nFollowing the success of Bit Hit’s premier act, and that of other artists under acquired labels SOURCE MUSIC and PLEDIS Entertainment, the company eventually evolved to become HYBE in 2021. \"I think HYBE is very special in that they have gone beyond being just a K-pop company,\" says Kelsey Goelz, curator of the exhibit. \"They have many different sub labels. They’ve come to America and gotten involved in the music business here, and then they’re also working in AI and gaming.\"\n\nBut beyond its global presence, one of K-pop’s ever-captivating elements is the sheer amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making it possible, even when HYBE artists like ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM make it look easy. There’s a core humanity to this work ethic and dogged tenacity — to the level of artistry in general — that speaks to K-pop fans around the world.\n\nWhile HYBE’s growth shows no signs of slowing down yet, the GRAMMY Museum exhibit takes a look back on the entertainment company’s legacy thus far. Read on for the five things we learned from the \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" exhibit.\n\nAll photos Courtesy of the Recording Academy™️/photo by Rebecca Sapp, Getty Images© 2024.\n\nIn A Decade, BTS Built Themselves IntoA Global Phenomenon\n\nLet’s start with a history lesson: despite being around for almost a decade, HYBE’s story begins in earnest with the formation of one of K-pop’s breakthrough acts, BTS, in 2013. (At that point, the company was still a standalone label.) Led by rapper RM, the seven boys hopped off a yellow school bus with a bratty, adolescent attitude — and that’s where the GRAMMY Museum’s exhibit picks up.\n\nThere’s a lot that happened between then and their seven Billboard No. 1s. Luckily, a wallpapered timeline breaks down all the major global highlights: the first U.S. tour, their UNICEF campaign, a landmark performance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and the announcement of BTS as TIME’s 2020 Entertainer of the Year, to name just a few.\n\nSitting in the middle of the museum floor is a glass case of polaroids — in them, Jin, Suga, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook toss up peace signs while sporting novelty hats designed to look like BTS’s lightstick. Nostalgic and deeply silly, these photos date back to 2017 and 2018, serving as a reminder of the colossal strides BTS has taken in the intervening years.\n\nLearn more: Breaking Down Every Solo Act From BTS: Singles, Debut Albums & What's Next For The Septet\n\nIt Takes A Village To Make A K-Pop Music Video\n\nWhen K-pop music videos are delivered to fans, they’re already finished products. Behind the curtain, it’s hard work to make them polished and perfect. Collected ‘fits and accessories throughout the exhibit get you up close and personal with creative details; then, to showcase the costumes in action, they’re paired with screens that play the finalized MVs.\n\nEach customized artifact is an expression of its respective group’s individuality, from ENHYPEN’s King of Pop-inspired \"Sweet Venom\" ensembles to BOYNEXTDOOR’s slouchy cabbie caps. Other standouts include belts and chains from &TEAM’s angsty \"Samidare,\" fromis_9’s opera-ready \"#menow\" jewels, and chunky necklaces featured in ILLIT’s runaway single \"Magnetic.\"\n\nEverything Comes Back To The Music\n\nHYBE’s proffered ethos is \"we believe in music\" — this motto gives the special exhibit its name, while also serving as a mission statement.\n\nIn a series of recorded interviews on view in the exhibit, HYBE’s idol songwriters share their process for and perspective on making music. The main takeaway: Inspiration comes in different forms. While writing, BTS’s j-hope pictures ideas as tree branches that sprout outward, while RM sees his rap verses as a realized world to live inside.\n\nLiterally, too, their lyrics mark the passage of time. If you’ve ever wondered why Suga circles back to motifs across the years, the rapper has all the answers for you here.\n\nThere’s also a conversation with WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, one of the K-pop industry’s most prolific idol composers with more than 150 credits to his name. It’s a penchant for plain language, he says, that makes the lyrics he writes really sing; the band’s beloved B-side \"Hug,\" for example, gets its potency from everyday words and phrases. TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s Yeonjun likewise fills visitors in on the origin story behind co-written \"Maze in the Mirror,\" a misty reflection of their tough trainee days.\n\nThis isn’t to say they haven’t had help, of course. Nearby, clips of HYBE producers Pdogg, BUMZU, and ZICO, settled in their respective studios, walk us through how the instrumentals for songs like BTS’s \"ON\" and SEVENTEEN’s \"Lilili Yabbay\" came to be. Peruse at your leisure — for those curious about the creation of K-pop’s biggest hits, this corner of the exhibit could easily take up the better part of a trip.\n\nFans Make K-Pop Special\n\nTo some fans, K-pop is more than just the music. As a sincere few explain in an exhibit video, K-pop is something that has profoundly touched their lives, providing the basis for genuine friendships and community. Fans get to give a little bit of this positive energy back to their idols, particularly through online platforms like HYBE’s Weverse, where users can interact directly with artists. \"I don’t think there’s another genre like K-pop that allows and enables that communication,\" Goetz, the curator, tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nIn true form, the GRAMMY Museum offers an interactive experience. At the exhibit’s opening event, fans posed next to their idols (digitally) in a photo booth, yelled K-pop’s national anthem into prop mics, and hit the dance floor with perfect renditions of LE SSERAFIM’s \"Perfect Nights\" choreography.\n\nBefore heading out, visitors could leave a mark of their own on the exhibit: after writing a message to their favorite artist via pastel Post-its and baby No. 2 pencils, fans loudly and proudly displayed them on the walls.\n\nHYBE’s Story Is Just Getting Started\n\nAccording to another timeline, the story so far has three chapters. There was the era of Big Hit Entertainment, when BTS came into the picture; then, the establishment of HYBE, with its many labels. Finally, as the U.S. and Latin America enter the fold, we’re in the end game. Representing this future is L.A.-based girl group KATSEYE, a collaboration with Geffen Records and the most recent inclusion to HYBE’s roster.\n\nBut K-pop hasn’t entirely let go of its \"K\" just yet, if the special guests for the exhibit’s launch were any indication. As the sun set over the GRAMMY Museum’s rooftop terrace, rookie boy group TWS kicked things off; before performing high-energy five songs back to back, the six boys charmed the audience by cutely cruising through a moderated conversation in English and Korean.\n\nAs the exhibit reveals, there’s a reason HYBE — and K-pop — went global in the first place. On top of the spectacle, their success has everything to do with the work that goes into making the effort seem effortless. Audiences root for real people, and that's what makes them keep coming back.\n\nMore K-Pop News\n\nGet To Know KATSEYE: The Global Girl Group Styled After K-Pop Superstars\n\n5 Takeaways From The GRAMMY Museum’s \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" Exhibit\n\nKCON L.A. 2024: 7 Highlights From NCT 127, ZEROBASEONE, NMIXX & More\n\nKCON L.A. 2024 Returns: Get Ready With This Playlist Featuring NCT 127, Zerobaseone, ENHYPEN, Zico & More\n\nATEEZ’s First U.S. Stadium Show Was A Triumph & Testament To Their Growth"
