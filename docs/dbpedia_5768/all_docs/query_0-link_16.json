        "text": "I don’t think I’m going to be at all famous, I don’t think I could handle it. I would probably go mad.[1]\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse (previously Amy Jade Civil; September 14, 1983 - July 23, 2011) was a Jewish-English singer-songwriter. Those outside of genre still recognize her for her hit single \"Rehab\", released as a single for the Back To Black album in 2006, which has since received a variety of Grammy Awards in celebration. Throughout her career, she was noted to be a sporadic artist with admirable confidence and a tumultuous love life, alongside her overt issues with substance abuse. The late singer passed in 2011 due to the latter, although her legacy lives on in the hearts of many to this day. The story of Amy is one which cannot be compressed, as it is lengthy and emotional. This article helps to organize the known facts of her life and the effects which still pursue in modern ages.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBorn Amy Jade Winehouse on September 14th, 1983, in Gordon Hill, Enfield,[2] her parents, Mitchell Winehouse and Janis Winehouse, were a window panel installer and taxi driver; and a pharmacist.[3] Her great-great-grandfather emigrated from Minsk, Belarus to London in 1891.[4] She had an older brother named Alex and the family lived in the Southgate area of London where she attended both primary and secondary school.[5][2][6][7] Amy's maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians and her interest in jazz was influenced by her paternal grandmother and parents.[8] Her parents separated when she was only nine years old, and so, she lived with her mother in Whetstone, London and stayed with her father in Hatfield Heath, Essex on weekends.[9] She attended the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School for four years and was later reported to have been expelled from the Sylvia Young Theatre School,[10][11] however, these claims were denied by both Sylvia Young and Mitch Winehouse.[12] She also attended the Mount School, Mill Hill and the BRIT School in Selhurst, Croydon but dropped out at age 16.[13][14] Amy bought her first guitar at 14 and began writing music shortly after.[15] She worked as an entertainment journalist and also sang with a local group called the Bolsha Band.[15] In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra and was influenced by Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington.[16] Her best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A&R person.[17]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2002–2005: Career beginnings with Frank[]\n\nIn 2002, Amy had created a variety of demo tracks with the hope of pitching to record labels.[18][19] In 2002, she would ultimately sign to Island Records.
