        "text": "Helping Hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,526\n\nI played a gig last night, with my new (and previous as well) bassist Rita (the angsty, tempermental \"knome\") and we had a GREAT GIG! The female drummer of our new project showed up (her name is Greta) and she's just as cute as a button and no bigger than a minute. So anyway, Rita's all over that! I think her gf was a little nervous. So in the meantime, I get a hold of the guitar player, and she is PUMPED. We have:\n\n1. Seasoned musicians\n\n2. A practice space\n\n3. A PA and lights\n\n4. Men who will willingly hump the gear and run sound.\n\n5. Club owners who are in our faces to book a gig!\n\nI'm at this gig, with my guitar player who has stood behind me for two years while we found the right players to fit...and it's hard for us to book, and the girl band has owners BEGGING to book us and we haven't even jammed yet! I did make an internal promise to be faithful to my root band...that the girl band was a side project. It's gonna be tough though...seeing as how just being all-female brings about a feeding frenzy amongst club owners.\n\nHey, I learned that by tuning the guitar in a \"drop D\" you practically don't need your left hand anymore!\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/pollyhager\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/polly.wilmot\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/rockcandycincy\n\nYou're supposed to be grooving as hard as you can, all of the time. - Stephen Gaskin\n\nHelping Hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,526\n\nMarc, let me know and we'll meet up for a drink. Hey, we can see Bob Cushing gig! Iffin the girl band is up and running by then (should be) I can bring a demo of a couple of songs. We're set to jam on Sunday. I'm keeping fingers and toes crossed. This IS all females we're talking about. I will say this. The guitar player has quite a few songs she's written. Wouldn't it be something if we actually went somewhere with this?\n\nI came from my second guitar lesson today. I'm learning the strumming for \"Barracuda\". Man, what a bear of a song that is! Every time I pick up the guitar to play though, whatever I'm practicing is easier, so I guess I'm making progress. My dream was always to play rythm guitar in a rock band in addition to singing.\n\nOkay, I have to lose 30 pounds.\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/pollyhager\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/polly.wilmot\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/rockcandycincy\n\nYou're supposed to be grooving as hard as you can, all of the time. - Stephen Gaskin\n\nTop 40 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 6,403\n\nPolly, If your band (or you, for that matter) can use any of the stuff I've written, feel free to have at it. Remember, just 'cause a guy's singing it (if you can call what I do singing) doesn't mean a guy has to.\n\nIt sounds like you've got a really fun thing going there.\n\njoe\n\nSerious Contributor\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 570\n\nMAB said:\n\n\"If you think back to your youth, when you were 15-21, did you embrace and go crazy over people in their 40's or 50's? Of course not..\"\n\nWrong! I did.. I LOVED Merle Haggard back then and Buck Owens.. it didn't matter to me how old they were.. I thought they were amazing. I don't think it did matter back then to people like it seems to be a \"problem\" or \"issue\" now.\n\nWell, I wouldn't call myself a \"great\" guitar player... I can't play lead guitar, but I am pretty confident with my acoustic playing. I can play bass good enough to possibly \"fill in\" for someone if need be. I'm getting older so I am going to try and \"rock\" while I still can! ha.

They are all GREAT musicians.\n\nAbsolutely. About thirty years ago, I saw Louise Mandrell and her band perform in Laurel, Indiana, at auction barn that doubled as a performance hall. Including my parents and myself, there were less than a dozen people in the audience, but Louise and the band played like they had a crowd of thousands.\n\nKevin Edward Rose\n\nCeltic, Americana, whatever the folk.\n\nHailed by Performing Songwriter magazine as a \"valued subscriber\".\n\nMore music sold than Elvis and the Beatles combined!*\n\nhttp://www.KevinEdwardRose.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/KevinEdwardRose\n\nTop 50 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,427\n\nLikes: 16\n\nQuam,\n\nYou are a rare example. Usually when almost all people are in that age bracket, they are repelled by the music of their parents.That is the reason for punk, rap, hip-hop, and each successive generation creates something different from what there parents listened to.\n\nI liked Buck Owens too at that age.Why? Because he had a televison show called Hee Haw that had a bunch of good looking women on it.\n\nMost people,whether they are general consumers, or grow up to be musicians, look to their own age group or that of just above it for their initial musical leanings. If that didn't happen, there would have never been an \"American Bandstand\" Tiger Beat, or Teen Beat\" magazine and the shifts in musical trends over the years.\n\nThe Beatles would have never gotten out of playing Skiffle music and Elvis would have been singing gospel. Every generation rejects the music of their parents in masse. And while some of us might have enjoyed that and later embraced it (classic rock is now one of the top formats out there) the mainstream of society,which is the primary buying public, hence what is marketed to by record companies, television and movie studios, commercials, usually rejects what comes before them and go their own way. That is nature.\n\nMAB\n\nLast edited by Marc Barnette; 01:10 PM.\n\nHelping Hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,526\n\nPat Benetar and Blondie are rockin' it up in Cincinnati tonight! They are in their 50's at least. Guess who's opening for them? THE DONNAS!!! I can't go. I'm just sick over it. I wouldn't want to go anyway, unless I was 3 rows or closer to the stage...appropriate stalker proximity for The Donnas. I imagine Pat Benetar and Blondie were their idols. It must be a rush for them to be on the same bill.\n\nMarc, I'll make it to your luncheon. Let me know.\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/pollyhager\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/polly.wilmot\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/rockcandycincy\n\nYou're supposed to be grooving as hard as you can, all of the time. - Stephen Gaskin\n\nTop 50 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,427\n\nLikes: 16\n\nHey Polly,\n\nI am actually headlining the festival Friday night the 11th. I don't know where the stage is going to be. I will be there all the next day. I will be doing private consulations out of my hotel room the next day. (NOT LIKE that, my girlfriend is with me!!!LOL!) but will be meeting with people. As soon as I kind of know the \"lay of the land\" I will name a place we can eat lunch and talk.\n\nWill have my lap top with me and be corresponding as much as possible. Will PM you with my number before I am coming up there.\n\nMAB\n\nHelping Hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,526\n\nWell heck, I'll just come out and see ya Friday night if that's better. If you're not too busy I'll come up and say \"hi\" for a few. I might be playing a private party (acoustic) Saturday, not sure what time. Anyway, let me know what time you go on Friday night.\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/pollyhager\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/polly.wilmot\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/rockcandycincy\n\nYou're supposed to be grooving as hard as you can, all of the time. - Stephen Gaskin\n\nTop 50 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,427\n\nLikes: 16\n\nPolly,\n\nThat would be great. I would think I play around 7:00-8:00. Not really sure since they are changing the format a bit from the past years. Can't wait to see you and after I finish we will all have a drink (or ten) and hang out. I LOVE to meet people in person after knowing them a bit on stage. Do me a favor and bring me a CD of your stuff. (I'll buy it of course) I don't get to many listening sites because frankly I do music all day long and don't go to things for \"fun\" but I do want to know what you are into and if there is any way I can help you, let me know.\n\nI would really like you to meet some of the NSAI members I work with up there. I think you might find some good writers to interact with.\n\nMAB\n\nTop 100 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,401\n\nJust wanted to mention that, my carpal tunnel is much better these days because I no longer work in a newspaper office on the computer all day. And I took lessons to learn how to play with a pick after years of finger picking. And I changed from a big classical guitar to a little Martin with steel strings. I also get regular massages and work to keep the tension in my neck, arms & shoulders down... this, over time, is helping to heal. I can finger pick again now, but not for too long. I try to break it up with strumming.\n\nI decided a while ago to write a couple thousand words a day on my book, and by the fourth or fifth day my carpal tunnel was coming back. So I stick to around 700 words.\n\nVikki Flawith: Songwriter/Composer, Singer/Voice Teacher\n\n12Feb10- *NEW BLOG: \"BE YOUR OWN GURU ;)\"\n\nMY STORY & MY MUSIC: http://www.vikkiflawith.com\n\nBe a FAN: http://www.reverbnation.com/vikkiflawith\n\nCasual Observer\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 4\n\nHi Jean,\n\nI am relatively new to JP. I am a bass player/songwriter who is fronting my own band. I sing while I play the bass (including slap/funk). Epiphanette (www.epiphanette.com) is the first band that I have fronted -- my experience comprises mostly backing up other bands of various genres. It's been very challenging, but I'm glad I'm finally able to get my ideas/concepts/songs out there.\n\nThanks for the post!\n\nTikitok\n\nSerious Contributor\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 195\n\nHey Jean,\n\nboy there are alot of post to read here... finally got to the last one.( for now)\n\nanyway,\n\nI am a singer/ songwriter/ guitar player.\n\nI started playing guitar at age 11 and singing since I was in 2nd grade, went thru all the chourus levels in highschool, began writing songs at 14, and performing them at 15. I have played at a few large venues ( over 30,000) mostly small ones, kind of got out of pursuing my music ( out of frustration) and got into massage therapy, ( I can help you with that carpel tunnel)\n\nnow that I have a solid massage buisness ( 14 years) I am realling feeling the pull to get back into my music and write and play. so here I am joining communities like JPF and starting all over again. but I love music, will play and write till I croak.\n\nmy website is\n\nwww.sharlashore.com\n\nif your interested.\n\nLast edited by sharla1; 01:37 AM.\n\nhttp://www.sharlashore.com\n\nmember ASCAP\n\nall songs copywrited.\n\nCasual Observer\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 1\n\nHey all,\n\nThis is my first post at JPF. Found it while searching for something else. I've gotta say, I fall in that young age bracket (21 here), and I love the music of past generations. I'd say it's actually more common amongst me and my friends than you may believe!\n\nSome of my favourite musicians are Fleetwood Mac, Crosby Stills & Nash, Carole King, Karen Dalton, Neil Young, Cat Stevens, Simon & G, John Lennon--you get the idea. I also love a lot of 80s new wave like New Order & Joy Division, the Cure, etc.\n\nThat being said, I love plenty of music from my own generation as well.\n\nI've been playing guitar for 8 years. I started playing in local bands when I was about 15, and did a good deal of D.I.Y. touring around the country between 16-19. Nothing fancy, but it was still fun to see the country without having to pay! An adventure for us, certainly.\n\nMore recently I've been just doing my own thing because of work/travel that I do, but you can check it out here:\n\nhttp://myspace.com/parlours\n\nRight now those are just a handful of demos we recorded in our house over a handful of days, but I'll be recording a proper full length soon after the new year. But yes. Lady here & a music maker as well. I quite enjoy playing anything I can get my hands on: acoustic, electric, ukulele, banjo, bells, synths, rhodes - you name it."
