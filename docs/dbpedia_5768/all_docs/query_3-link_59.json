        "text": "While Winehouse’s story has been told before in tabloid pages and documentaries like 2015′s “Amy,” the new biopic “Back to Black” aims to showcase the six-time Grammy winner’s life and legacy in a different light, using the lyrics of her music as a guide. Abela and director Sam Taylor-Johnson “didn’t want to demonize or sanitize” Winehouse or her story — the “Valerie” singer publicly struggled with addiction and died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 — and relied on the songs of her two albums “Frank” and “Back to Black” to “tell her story authentically.”\n\n“Amy’s story is Amy’s story: there were drugs and there was alcohol and there was love and there was loss,” said Abela. “All of these things needed to exist, but the most important story that Sam wanted to tell was the story of a young artist.”\n\n“Once she made the decision to tell the story through the album, then she kind of let the music dictate what was being told at any given time,” she added.\n\n“I felt like it was time to come back to her and come back to the music and be with her creatively, sort of in her soul, if you’d like,” said Taylor-Johnson, noting discussions she had with screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh on making the movie a “musical, but not a musical-musical.”\n\nTaylor-Johnson revealed that the track “Tears Dry on Their Own” from Winehouse’s “Back to Black” album was the song that served as the film’s thematic north star because it encapsulated Winehouse’s ability to bring “upbeat” vibes with her music, while also putting her “heartbreak and pain” on full display.\n\n“Like all great singer-songwriters, they kill you, make your heart break with what they’re saying,” Taylor-Johnson said. “But at the same time, you’re enjoying and loving and moving and feeling.”\n\nSongs like “Tears Dry on Their Own” or “Love Is a Losing Game” informed how the filmmakers portrayed Winehouse’s relationships as well, in particular, her tumultuous marriage with Fielder-Civil, her ex-husband, played in the biopic by Jack O’Connell.\n\n“It’s so clear that there’s been a sort of huge shift in her relationship to herself, in relation to men especially,” Abela said of Winehouse’s songs on her second album. “It makes sense to me which album came first. She’s got all the bravado of a teenager in ‘Frank,’ and then she experiences a lot of love and a lot of loss, and then we get the album ‘Back to Black.’”\n\nFinding the right person to play Winehouse was no easy feat, as many auditioned for the role, often wearing over-the-top outfits like caricatures of the late singer. Abela stood out to Taylor-Johnson because she came into the audition just as her normal, quiet self.\n\n“When I first met her, she did not present herself as what I now know her to be,” Taylor-Johnson said. “She was very sweet, quite shy, and very straightforward, and just didn’t have the energy that I thought I might need for Amy.”\n\n“I then got her back for a read-through and she did this massive transitional shift within her,” she added. “Until then, everyone had been an impersonation, and Marisa just came in and did this thing where she suddenly inhabited her.”\n\nAbela proved she could not only embody Winehouse’s look, but her sound as well. Despite not being a singer, Abela blew Taylor-Johnson and the crew away with her voice, and she sings all the songs herself in the movie.\n\n“It’s sort of mildly ridiculously miraculous,” Taylor-Johnson said of discovering Abela’s singing talent. “None of us, at all, expected that from the beginning.”\n\nAlthough Abela is grateful for all the rave reviews of her musical talents in “Back to Black,” don’t expect the 27-year-old actress to make singing a second career.\n\n“I’m not a singer in any way,” Abela said. “I don’t feel compelled to sing again other than in the shower.”\n\nAbela may not have interest in following Winehouse’s musical footsteps, but she has found herself in a similar position of being a young star on the rise who’s quickly gaining the attention of fans and the media. During a recent press junket in Los Angeles, Abela endured a marathon of 57 interviews, a testament to the performer’s growing stardom.\n\nThe actress admitted that she’s in a “slightly more fortunate” position than Winehouse when it comes to media attention, as she’s not being hounded by paparazzi all day and night like the late singer.\n\n“If I don’t want to share anything about my own life, I don’t have to,” said Abela. “Whereas Amy was writing from personal experience, and I think the more that you give of yourself, the more people feel entitled to it. I think that’s a lesson I’ve potentially learned from this experience. Boundaries are important.”\n\nWinehouse’s relationship with the media gets the spotlight in “Back to Black,” as well, offering a window into how her tussles with paparazzi affected her work and connections with others. Taylor-Johnson felt it was important to look back on these moments to reevaluate how we consume that type of voyeuristic celebrity content.\n\n“I could look up any given day and see a picture of her taken from 5, 10, 15 different angles,” Taylor-Johnson said. “We just see this one picture and just see her in a desperate, vulnerable state. When you see that it’s from varying angles, you get the sense that she’s never on her own and she’s always with a crowd of big guys with lenses.”\n\n“That was one of the things that unsettled me more than anything,” she added, noting how readers at the time could see “her decline, daily, through tabloids.”\n\nLooking back at Winehouse’s struggles, successes, and impact on music, Taylor-Johnson thinks the singer has left a musical legacy in the vein of Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and Janis Joplin.\n\n“It’s rare to have such an authentic voice,” Taylor-Johnson said, adding that the album “Back to Black” will “stand the test of time.”\n\nAbela believes Winehouse’s ability to connect with listeners on such a deep level is why she’ll go down as one of music’s all time greats.\n\n“That’s what’s incredible about her music, the honesty, the authenticity, the rawness,” Abela said. “I think that’s why people connect so deeply and profoundly with it. How does she know exactly how I’m feeling?”\n\n“Back to Black” opens in theaters May 17."
