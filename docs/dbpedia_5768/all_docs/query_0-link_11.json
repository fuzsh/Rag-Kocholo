        "text": "At this rate, Amy Winehouse may yet end up better known for her music than her extra-curricular excesses. After stealing the show at the Mercurys despite missing out on the top prize, the singer last night scored a double triumph, claiming the best female prize at the Mobo awards and the Vodafone Live Music awards. After keeping organisers guessing, she turned up to perform Tears Dry On Their Own and Me and Mr Jones.\n\nFor once it was another habitual no-show who dominated debate at the O2 arena, playing host to the Mobo awards for the first time. US rapper 50 Cent, who had been slated to appear at both events but pulled out at the last minute after losing his high-profile US chart battle with Kanye West, had insult added to injury. Having claimed he would retire if West's Graduation beat his Curtis album to the Billboard number one slot on Sunday, which it did with ease, the New York rapper was also beaten by his rival in the best hip hop category.\n\nWinehouse, the subject of fierce tabloid scrutiny since an apparent overdose, had been nominated in four categories. In the absence of the big transatlantic draw, it was left to the homegrown singers such as Winehouse, the returning Craig David, Kano and former Sugababe Mutya Buena to entertain the crowd. Winehouse, heavily influenced by Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, triumphed over Joss Stone, Jamelia, Beverley Knight and last year's winner, Corinne Bailey Rae.\n\nThe awards, presented by Shaggy and Jamelia, attempt to tread a fine line between attracting the big international names required to satisfy the watching live and TV audience and nurturing British talent.\n\nNe-Yo, the latest US R&B sensation to make a bid for global success, won both the best song prize, for Because of You, and the best R&B award.\n\nThe gritty Dizzee Rascal, whose third album, Maths + English, was also nominated for the Mercury prize, was named best British male. N Dubz, a Camden-based hip-hop trio who became favourites on urban music TV station Channel U following a string of self-funded releases and have recently signed to a major label, were surprise winners in the best UK newcomer category.\n\nThe awards, broadcast live by the BBC, have endured despite the ups and downs of the British black music scene. Originally launched by entrepreneur Kanya King with a bank loan after she perceived a lack of mainstream recognition for music of black origin, they are now in their twelfth year. British jazz artist Soweto Kinch triumphed in his category, while teenage US star Sean Kingston, currently number one with Beautiful Girls, won the reggae prize.\n\nThe Mobos have attracted controversy down the years. They have been accused of honouring homophobic reggae stars and being either too commercial or too wilfully obtuse. After a year of renewed debate about the links between rap music and gun crime, the organisers were keen to play up the event's positivity. Earlier this year the Mobo organisation hailed 10 rappers, including British artists Sway, Akala and Estelle as well as US stars Jay Z and Kanye West, for being good role models. It also launched the Mobo Foundation, designed to address barriers facing ethnic minority candidates seeking employment in the music industry, and a music trade association that will work in partnership with existing music business trade associations.\n\nIn an increasingly crowded music awards calendar, the second Vodafone Live Music awards also took place last night. Dreamed up by the mobile phone network to reflect the booming popularity of live music, the awards' other winners included Mika (best live male), Arctic Monkeys (best live act), the Police (best live return) and the Killers (best international live act). Like other mobile phone networks and youth brands, Vodafone is trying to associate itself with music as a way to target the hearts and minds of potential customers.\n\nOne of the most popular winners, however, was the recipient of an award designed to honour the unsung heroes of the live scene. Having lugged heavy monitors for the Stone Roses, minded Bez's maracas in the Madchester heyday of the Happy Mondays and tuned guitars for baggy heroes James since 1989, one Geoff Buckley was rewarded with the roadie of the year prize."
