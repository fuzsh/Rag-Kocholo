Amy Winehouse was an English singer and songwriter known for deep, soulful voice and musical style which mixed multiple genres. In 2008, she won five Grammy awards in a single night for her second album, Back To Black (2006).

Amy's troubling personal life and recurring battles with drug addiction, self-harm, and eating disorders colored some of her best work. Her personal struggles endeared her to her fans who could relate to her vulnerability and fight against adversity. The singer was always open about her bisexuality; friends reported her to have said: "There is something about being with a woman that is very satisfying. I don't care what people think about me being bi — I do what feels good.”

Winehouse died in 2011 at age 27 of alcohol poisoning. While her life was tragically cut short, her music lives on. VH1 ranked her 26th on their list of 100 Greatest Women in Music.
