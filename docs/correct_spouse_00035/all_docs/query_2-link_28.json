        "text": "2022 January Report*\n\n26 Femicides and 28 Suspicious Female Deaths in January\n\nThe fight to stop femicides in Turkey has been going on for 12 years. As the platform, since we identified the need, we have been disclosing femicide data to the public since 2010. The Ministry of Interior, on the other hand, distorts the facts by saying femicide data were prepared incorrectly, instead of explaining how many women were killed, why, how and by whom. Along with explaining the reality of femicide and suspicious femicide deaths, it is the duty of the state to implement concrete solutions to stop femicides. We will continue to fight for the mobilization of all relevant ministries and mechanisms to fulfil this task.\n\nThe reason behind 13 femicides could not be determined\n\nThis month, 26 femicides were committed, and 28 women were found suspiciously dead. The reason behind 13 of the 26 femicides could not be determined. 11 women were killed on the pretext of wanting a divorce, refusing to reconcile, refusing to marry, or rejecting a relationship. 1 woman was killed on the pretext of hatred and 1 woman was killed on economic pretexts. The inability to determine why 13 women were killed is the result of violence against women and femicides being rendered invisible. Unless it is determined by whom and why women were killed, unless a fair trial is conducted and the suspects, accused, and murderers are given deterrent punishments and preventive measures implemented, violence continues to increase in size.\n\nBy whom were the women killed?\n\nOf the 26 women killed on January, 13 were killed by their husbands, 5 by someone they knew, 3 by their former partner, 2 by their son, 1 by her partner and 1 by her relative. The relationship between the women and the perpetrator in one 1 of the femicides could not be determined.\n\nWomen were mostly killed in their homes\n\n15 women were killed at their home, 4 in the middle of the street, 2 at their workplace, 2 in a car and 1 in a restaurant. The location of 2 of the femicides could not be determined. 58% of women killed this month were killed in their homes.\n\nWomen were mostly killed with firearms\n\n13 of the women killed this month were killed by firearms, 7 by sharp objects, 3 by drowning and 3 by being beaten.\n\nThe employment status of women still cannot be determined\n\nIt is very hard to determine the employment status of women. We believe that this important data should be considered by the members of the press. According to the data obtained this month, 7 of the women were working at a workplace, but the employment status of 19 of the women was unidentified.\n\nWithout equality, without eliminating poverty, you can’t touch alimony\n\nWith the 6th judicial package, a change in alimony is being planned. Alimony is a right given to the parties driven into poverty after divorce. This means it is not only given to women but to everyone that gets driven into poverty after a divorce. It is a fact that alimony is generally given to women. However, this shows due to gender inequality it is generally women who get driven into poverty. Besides that, not every woman who applies for alimony can gain that right and even if they do, the amount of money is usually not enough for them to even pay their bills. Also, women can’t receive the alimony regularly, which is their right. Gender inequality makes women dependent even on a very small amount of alimony. The alimony regulation that is being discussed may increase the risk of women being trapped in a marriage in a country where women are killed for wanting a divorce. The regulation suggests the duration of the alimony be limited to the duration of the marriage, and after that, the money will be given by the government. The government must first find a solution for women who have problems receiving their rightful alimony. First, policies must be developed to overcome gender inequality and poverty.\n\nWe hear that another regulation coming with the 6th judicial reform package is a peacemaking system for divorces. We must state that peacemaking is only applicable between equals. Peacemaking is not possible in a system where there are so many unequal power relations and women are being killed for wanting a divorce. Just like they withdrew from the Istanbul Convention for 7% of the population, the government is listening to invalid so-called victimizations and to please a handful of men is deepening gender inequality.\n\nThe Chief Prosecutor of the Council of State: It is against the Law\n\nThe Chief Prosecutor of the Council of State, ElmasMucukgil, expressed his opinion that the decision of the president to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention is against the law and the decision should be annulled. In a judicial system where so many unlawful decisions are being taken, this statement by the Chief Prosecutor of the Council of State is very significant for the process. As stated by the Chief Prosecutor, the Istanbul Convention and Law 6251 is still in effect.\n\nAfter the announcement of the withdrawal of the convention, in the squares, the streets and all areas of resistance, we explained that this decision, taken overnight by a single person, was illegal and we will continue to do so. We will not give up on the Istanbul Convention: We will implement the constitution, the law and the convention.\n\nNot a “joke”, a Femicide\n\nIn the YağmurÖnüt case, the perpetrator was sentenced for deliberate killing with possible intent with a “good conduct” reduction. Although this reduction will be objected to, it is as a result of our 6-year long fight that it was revealed that the perpetrator tried to cover up the murder as an accident by saying “we were joking”; it is not a joke, it is a femicide.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior announced that there was 1 unsolved murder in 2021. According to the 2021 Femicide Data Report we published, 217 suspicious female deaths occurred last year. We would like to ask the Ministry of Interior about the deaths of 217 women, which were left suspicious. It was not even revealed whether the suspicious deaths of 217 women were murders or not. There is no effective investigation and prosecution regarding the suspicious deaths of women. As with the example of YağmurÖnüt, the suspicious deaths of women are revealed through our fight. We will not allow any woman’s death to be left suspicious, and we will continue to fight until every suspicious death is revealed.\n\nFreedoms Cannot Be Restricted with Public Mandates\n\nThe Turkish president recently issued a public mandate restricting freedom of expression. The mandate states that necessary sanctions will be placed for press and publishing activities that do not comply with “national and moral” values. Of course, we know this mandate is not a coincidence but a step towards restricting freedoms.\n\nThis month, we saw that women in the public eye were attacked because of their clothes, songs, and words. Firstly, Gülşen was accused of “immorality” due to an outfit she wore during her performance and was subjected to social lynching. Later, the president targeted Sezen Aksu regarding a song she wrote stating: “It is our duty to cut off the tongues that talk against Adam if necessary.” Following this, journalist Sedef Kabaş was detained on charges of insulting the president for her words on a live broadcast.\n\nIn addition, this month Ezgi Mola and SerenaySarıkaya filed a complaint about people who have been threatening and harassing them for a long time. Many women could have been saved if the political power, which tried to rule the country with mandates, had used its power to protect women instead of using it against those who express their opinions.\n\n2 years later, we are still asking: Where is GülistanDoku?\n\nIt has been 2 years since GülistanDoku disappeared. Gülistan’s family started a sit-in protest in front of the Tunceli Courthouse. Our members of Tunceli Women’s Council and Elazığ Women’s Council were also in front of the courthouse with Gülistan’s family. GülistanDoku’s family will never walk alone in their fight.\n\nOn the other hand, EnginYücel, the stepfather of ZeynelAbakarov, the prime suspect behind GülistanDoku’s disappearance, was sentenced for sharing information about Gülistan, which he obtained while he was a police officer. Likewise, the lawyer who presented the personal information of ŞuleÇet as evidence of suicidal tendencies was given a prison sentence. In Ceren Damar’s case, the court accepted the indictment against VahitBıçak, the lawyer of the perpetrator, who made unfounded allegations about Ceren. These decisions are precedents won against those who seek every possible way to prevent the perpetrators from being punished. We will not allow women’s private lives to be questioned in the courts.\n\nThose who do not protect women are responsible for the femicides.\n\nThis month, Dilara Yıldız and RaziyeOskay were killed on the same day by the men they used to be with. Both women had filed numerous complaints against the perpetrators and had restraining orders. While women use all means available to protect themselves from possible perpetrators, the authorities do not protect women. ÖmürErez was killed by Rahmi Uygun, the man who has been harassing her at the Family Health Center where she worked. It was revealed that the perpetrator had a loaded criminal record. If the authorities had fulfilled their duties, had an effective investigation process been carried out, and had the perpetrators been given the necessary punishments, Dilara, Raziye and Ömür could have been among us right now.\n\nIs action being taken against officials who do not fulfil their duties, and is the process carried out effectively even when it is taken? A decision of non-prosecution was given in the investigation of the police officers who did not enter the apartment while ŞebnemŞirin was inside with the perpetrator, claiming “nobody responded” when they knocked on the door.\n\nPresident of the Supreme Court Mehmet Akarca said,“An illusion is being created as if femicides are only happening in Turkey”. We will not allow you to normalize femicide with such a discourse. Both the authorities who do not punish the negligence of public officials and those who try to normalize femicides are responsible for femicides.\n\nLabourer Women’s Assemblies: Hugo Boss Give Workers Their Compensation, Take Back the Slander\n\nWe issued a press statement with our member MevlüdeÜnal and Tekstil-İş Union at the Gaziemir Free Zone, where Hugo Boss factory is located and where she has been working as a sewing operator for 17 years. MevlüdeÜnal was fired from Hugo Boss with an alleged charge of stealing in order not to pay compensation. Mevlüde was first exposed to mobbing for not fulfilling the arbitrary demands of the newly arrived supervisor. After her job post was changed, she was dismissed from her job without even getting to defend herself. To prevent her from getting her compensation she had accumulated for 17 years, it was claimed that there was a product with the Hugo Boss label in her bag. We will continue to fight for Mevlüde to retrieve her usurped right to compensation and for the company to take back the slander they have made in order not to pay compensation.\n\nLaw No. 6284 and Its Results\n\nLaw No. 6284 which regulates many measures against perpetrators such as expulsion and close protection and gives women many rights from financial empowerment to changing their identity information; and which came into force as a result of years of fighting of women’s organizations, protects women if implemented effectively. The enactment of Law No. 6284, which was brought to protect women and prevent violence, became possible after signing the Istanbul Convention.\n\nIn Uşak, general practitioner BarışYağcı, who was previously penalized for killing a stray dog with a firearm and for arson under the influence of alcohol, sexually assaulted 21-year-old Yağmur G., whom he had examined, after he put her to sleep with medication.\n\nIt was found out that SedefnurÇağlar, who fell from the window of her friend’s 7th floor house in Kocaeli, remained on the ground for 12 minutes after she fell and no one from the house went to help her.\n\nIn the PınarGültekin case, the prosecutor gave the notion: He demanded aggravated life imprisonment for the accused CemalMetinAvcı for the charge of deliberate killing and tormenting purposely and with monstrous feeling. It was revealed in the previous report that PınarGültekin was burned while she was still alive. This situation became definite with the Forensic Medicine Report that came at the last hearing.\n\nIn Istanbul, in the case regarding the injury of NurtaçCanan, who was shot 5 times with a gun by her husband RagıpCanan, whom she wanted to divorce, the court acquitted the perpetrator of the charges “deprivation of liberty” and “threat with a gun”, and sentenced him to 9 years in prison for “deliberately wounding a spouse with a gun”. Although Nurtaç brought the decision to the Court of Appeal, the court found this sentence appropriate and rejected her application.\n\nIn Zonguldak, 16-year-old Damla Demir committed suicide after leaving a note saying that her neighbour M.K. sexually assaulted her. Although the DNA samples taken from Damla’s nails matched with M.K.’s, he was released under house arrest.\n\nIn the case of Rabia Naz Vatan, who died suspiciously, two prosecutors were given a warning due to deficient investigation. The prosecutor’s office had previously given a verdict of non-prosecution into the investigation of Rabia Naz’s suspicious death.\n\nA decision of non-prosecution has been given on the case in which police officers came to the door but decided not to enter the house stating “there is no sound coming from the home“where 25-year-old Şebnem was stabbed to death by Furkan Zıpıncı in the house of the perpetrator in Denizli.\n\nSpecialized sergeant TalipKorcan, who sexually assaulted two children in Van and was being charged with “sexual assault of children”, was given a decision of non-prosecution and was released at the case’s first hearing.\n\nAll these examples show how vital the full and effective implementation of the Istanbul Convention and 6824 is for women. For the effective protection of women, injunctions should be implemented, the process should be followed, all units of the state should protect women’s rights, and public officials who do not fulfil their duties should not be left unpunished.\n\nSuspicious women deaths should be enlightened immediately\n\nAs we have been explaining in our reports for a while, during the pandemic, there is a very serious increase in the number of suspicious female deaths, presented as suicides or natural deaths and in the number of women found suspiciously dead. Unfortunately, shedding light on suspicious women deaths can be even more difficult than femicides. It is necessary to reveal whether women were killed, whether they were killed by accident, whether women were killed on the basis of their gender (whether it was femicide), whether they committed suicide or whether they were driven to suicide.\n\nAs soon as possible, the suspicious deaths of 28 women that took place in January should be enlightened. Actions that need to be taken in this regard are quite clear; the decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention should be reversed, the protection law numbered 6284, and the Istanbul Convention should be implemented effectively and holistically by all institutions and organizations. Investigations into suspicious female deaths should be carefully examined and concluded quickly.\n\nIn Konya, 20-year-old MelikeŞahin lost her life after falling from the 4th floor of the apartment of her partner Kadir Yallagöz.\n\nAdileKılınç, 22-year-old, lost her life after falling from the balcony of her house on the 4th floor in Gaziantep. ÇağrıŞaşmaz, who was at home at the time, was arrested.\n\nIn Şanlıurfa, 30-year-old Nesibe Alas, mother of 5 children, was found shot in the back of her neck.\n\nIn Denizli, 21-year-old AyşegülMeciwas found dead in the flat she shared with 2 flatmates.\n\nIn Ankara, 26-year-old ŞevvalAbanoz was found dead in an abandoned hospital building. Şevval, who was severely injured after falling from the 3rd floor of the building, froze to death there where she remained inquired for a long time. It was learned that Şevval had gotten married 3 months ago, and her family stated that the man she married used violence against her.\n\nIn Istanbul, 30-year-old KübraEce lost her life after falling from the 4th floor. 7 people who were in the house were arrested.\n\nIn Kırıkkale, 35-year-old HayriyeUlusoy, mother of two, was found dead in a dam.\n\nWhat happened regarding women in the month of January?\n\nIn Ireland, 23-year-old Ashley Murphy was killed while she was jogging. People of Ireland gathered in the squares for her. There were also protests for Ashley in America too. However, the perpetrator is still unknown.\n\nThe Spanish government announced they will register femicide data. Since 2003, Spain had been recording murders of women as gender-based murders if there was proof of a relationship between the woman and the perpetrator. Starting from Saturday the 1st of January, the definition of gender-based murder has been widened to include any murder of a woman or child where gender played a part.\n\nAfghan women continue to resist the Taliban rule. The Taliban soldiers, who broke into the door of the house of an Afghan woman who participated in the protests, arrested the woman and her four sisters. On the 20th of January, Taliban forces sprayed tear gas at a group of women protesting at Kabul University to demand the right to work and study.\n\nMalta announced they will acknowledge femicides as a specific type of crime. They also stated that the law enforcement needed “a reform from the ground up in the way femicides are investigated”, with investigators and prosecutors needing special training to handle such cases.\n\nThe rising number of femicides in Kosovo garnered reactions. Women urged the Kosovo institutions to get more serious regarding these cases.\n\nThe stories of the life struggles of the 26 women who were killed in January\n\nIn the case of EsraHankulu, 25, who was found dead on the 5th of August 2021 in Ankara, the prosecutor gave a notion. In the notion which was based on the forensic medicine report, the prosecutor noting that Ümitcan Uygun was at the house, said, “As can be understood from the reports received and the statements of the defendants, it has been determined that the victim vomited and her consciousness deteriorated within 1 hour after the blows she got to her body and that in this way, the victim Hankulu was killed by Ümitcan Uygun.”\n\nIn Van, 47-year-old Zeynep Şengüler was shot and killed by Mehmet VeysiŞengüler, the man she was married to, on the pretext of jealousy. In his statement, the perpetrator stated that he had been planning the murder for a long time.\n\nIn Istanbul, 44-year-old NerminCelep was beaten in the middle of the street and then stabbed to death in a taxi by Ramazan Su, the man she was with. It turned out that Ramazan Su had a track record of previous crimes such as “deliberate injury”, “injury by negligence”, “sexual assault”, and “maltreatment”.\n\nIn Istanbul, GülbeyazOruçgüney was stabbed to death by Orhan Oruçgüney, her son.\n\nIn Denizli, 69-year-old SafiyeGülkaya was shot with a rifle by CaferGülkaya, the man she was married to. The perpetrator was arrested.\n\nIn Gaziantep, 40-year-old NurcanKartal, mother of three, was stabbed 11 times by NurettinKartal, the man she was married to. Nurcan lost her struggle for life in the hospital. The perpetrator was detained.\n\nEdanur Demir, 17, who was working in a cafe in Antalya, was shot dead with a pistol. In his statement, the perpetrator Semih Melih D. said, “We were joking with Edanur. I wanted to make a joke with the pistol. She said, ‘I am not afraid of the pistol.’So I turned the muzzle to the foot first and then the head and pressed the trigger. I didn’t know it would be like this”.\n\nIn Istanbul, 28-year-old lawyer Dilara Yıldız was killed with a firearm while having dinner in a restaurant by OktayDönmez, the man she used to be with, on the pretext that she did not agree to get together with him. It turned out that Dilara Yıldız had complained about the perpetrator many times and had a restraining order against him.\n\nIn Istanbul, 37-year-old Safura Gulistan was shot dead with a firearm by Galip Gulistan, the father of the man she was married to. Seven suspects related to her murder were referred to the courthouse. It was noted that the suspects took the decision of ‘execution’ after a decision taken by their family council on an allegation of cheating.\n\nIn Mersin, 24-year-old RaziyeOskay was shot with a pistol in the middle of the street by Barış Can Uçuk, the man she refused. It was learned that Raziye had been exposed to threats and psychological violence for years, she had complained many times about the perpetrator and had a restraining order against him.\n\nIt was revealed that 22-year-old Rim A., who was pregnant, was killed and buried in the land behind their house by Nasır A., the man she was married to. The perpetrator and his relatives who tried to conceal the incident were detained.\n\nIn Bursa, 31-year-old Gözde Korku was shot dead with a firearm by Orcay Korku, the man she was married to, on the pretext of jealousy. The perpetrator tried to commit suicide with the same gun.\n\nIn Ankara, 30-year-old Özge Nur Tekin was beaten to death on the back with a rolling pin 100 times by the man she was married to, under the direction of the religious merchant Erdal Kaya.\n\nIt was revealed that 38-year-old SinemKaraboğa, who was filed missing six months ago in İzmir, was strangled to death by Ferhat Karaboğa, the man she was married to, on the pretext of jealousy. The murder came to light three years later, after the perpetrator’s confession.\n\nIn Adıyaman, 25-year-old CananIşık, mother of two, was stabbed to death in the middle of the street by MahmutIşık, the man she was in the process of divorce. It was learned that CananIşık, who decided to leave several times, returned to MahmutIşık after the family elders intervened. CananIşık, who was subjected to violence three months ago, took her two children and settled in the Women’s Shelter and filed a lawsuit to divorce MahmutIşık in December.\n\nIn Istanbul, 47-year-old HanpaşaÖzbek was strangled with plastic handcuffs by İsmail Özbek, the man she was married to. He called the police and reported himself, saying, “I killed my wife, come get me”.\n\nIn Ankara, 35-year-old FundaKoyuncu was stabbed to death by Recep Koyuncu, the man she was married to. The perpetrator was detained.\n\nIn Antalya, 57-year-old SaadetTutkanç was strangled to death and her body hidden in a chest at the house by VuralYılmaz, her acquaintance. The incident, which took place on the 17th of December, came to light when the perpetrator confessed on the 5th of January. The perpetrator was arrested.\n\nIn Tekirdağ, 22-year-old EsraUstaoğulları was killed with a gun in front of her children by İlkerUstaoğlu, the man she was married to.

In his initial statement, the perpetrator claimed that he found his mother at home covered in blood. The perpetrator, who had arranged the house and had taken his mother’s gold and money to make it seem like a burglary, confessed to his crime in cross-examination and was arrested.\n\nIn Izmir, 48-year-old GünayÖzyıldız was stabbed to death as she was entering her apartment by Ömer Al. The perpetrator was arrested and sent to prison.\n\n*Our Report: It includes news about violence against women reflected in the press each month, about details on cases, recent events and the women’s movement. We compile the news reflected in the press and the applications that come directly to us, reach a number and prepare our report within this framework. We handle, bring together and evaluate our Femicide Report according to the concept of femicide. In other words, the conceptualization of femicide is; “the killing or forcing into suicide by a man of a woman, from embryo to fetus, baby to child, adult to elderly, simply because of their gender or on the pretext of their actions contrary to the gender stereotypes. Femicides should not be perceived merely as murders in which people of the female sex are killed. In these murders committed with hatred, what is attacked is the identity of the woman herself”"
