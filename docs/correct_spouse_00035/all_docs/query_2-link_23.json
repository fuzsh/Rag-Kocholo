        "text": "The run-up to Christmas in London is always a magical time of year, so hosting a cocktail to celebrate the launch of my new homewares brand made this season even more special. The venue, a members-only favorite on Charles Street called Mark’s Club, sparkled with Christmas lights, baubles, and perfectly decorated mantlepieces.\n\nGlitter reindeer, velvet napkin ring bows, and Christmas tree plates were laid on immaculate white starched tablecloths ready for guests to come and see my new collections. An array of white and green berries, ranunculus, and lisianthus arrived from Flowerbx, impeccably arranged and adding much beauty to our festive tablescapes. Finally, our mint green candles were lit, and my husband started playing Christmas carols on the piano. We were well and truly ready to celebrate!\n\nFriends and family came from far and wide and I was so touched by their support. Poppy Delevingne looked magical in a pair of glittery trousers as did Tatiana Santo-Domingo and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece in heavenly frocks. My sweet mother and sister, who had helped me lay the tables hours earlier, looked chic in black tuxedos while I went for an Alessandra Rich “little white dress” with Choo heels and a Chanel tote.\n\nCharlotte Dellal and Emilia Wickstead gossiped away over sesame seared tuna (the canapès at Mark’s Club are delicious) while Lady Mary Charteris, Nina Flohr, and Arizona Muse caught up over Champagne on the terrace.\n\nAll too soon, the evening had come to an end, and I did feel sad it was all over. But at the same time, grateful for an evening I would never forget. Launching a new brand is always pretty scary, but having the support of loved ones, in the most exquisite setting of Mark’s Club, was all I could have wished for. Thank you, all—you know who you are."
