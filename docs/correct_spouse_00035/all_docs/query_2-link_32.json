        "text": "The life of a young computer systems analyst is thrown into turmoil when, after arriving in Istanbul to start a new job, she finds her credit cards useless, her bank account empty, and her identity stolen.\n\n“The Net 2.0” is a sequel that lacks originality in its plot and premise from its predecessor, “The Net,” which stars Sandra Bullock instead of Nikki DeLoach. Relying on a similar plot premise, “The Net 2.0” just takes place in a different country. Nikki DeLoach is Hope Cassidy, a computer analyst that leaves behind her partner to take on a new job in Istanbul where she is promised a time of adventure and excitement for her seemingly mundane life. However, things are turned quickly into a sour situation as her identity gets stolen and she falls victim to an elaborate plan of being framed for crimes that she did not commit. While the switch in scenery might be enough to create some excitement, the approach to the film genre and overall plot had no innovation.\n\nNikki DeLoach carries a different presence than Sandra Bullock, but it’s one that fails to incite the kindred spirit of the-girl-next-door. While “The Net” preserves a vulnerable back story for its young protagonist, “The Net 2.0” fails to flesh out any details that would make Nikki DeLoach’s portrayal of Hope Cassidy as likable. Instead, Hope Cassidy comes across as impulsive and immature – both clear flaws that fail to bring together a comprehensive narrative of survival through computer intelligence. DeLoach as Cassidy is mundane to watch and lacks the character growth that allows the audience to get invested in the film and its premise.\n\n“The Net 2.0” also fails to put together a plot premise that makes sense. It’s hard to believe that such a large syndicate of hackers looking to embezzle money against the Russian mafia would go out of their way to secretly recruit an archetype of the classic American girl to frame. It makes it that much harder to believe that Hope Cassidy survived till the very end – escaping jail through a random encounter with an undercover flight attendant, who apparently knew what trouble would befall Cassidy in Istanbul. Rather than being developed with nuance and social commentary, “The Net 2.0” is a mess of plot turns, attempting to retain the attention of the audience but fails to do so due to its outlandish coincidences that render the film with a strong reminder that it is just a film.\n\nWhile the Blu-ray re-release of “The Net” series can be a dive into the ’90s and their relationship with the unknown capacity of computer technology, the audience is better off indulging in only the first film, “The Net,” and leaving “The Net 2.0” behind.\n\nNow available on Blu-ray from Mill Creek Entertainment"
