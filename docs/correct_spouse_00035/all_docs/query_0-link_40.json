        "text": "68 journalists and 27* distributors welcomed the year 2013 in prison. All are imprisoned for connections with a ‘terrorist organisation’ within the scope of the Anti-Terror Law (TMK) and the Turkish Penal Code (TCK). Forty-nine out of 68 journalists and all 27 distributors are from the Kurdish media.\n\nThese journalists and distributors are generally being accused with “creating a media for the illegal organisation.” Ordinary journalism activities - such as “following news,” “criticizing the government,” and “working for the Kurdish media,” – are, in general, being considered and defined as offenses.\n\nAmong alleged offenses are, \"committing an offense on behalf of the group, without being a member of that group” and/or \"knowingly and willingly assisting a group although not being in the hierarchical structure of the group.” Some journalists are on trial for \"setting up an armed or unarmed group,\" \"motivating and commanding it,\" or \"being a member of it.\" The courts have already delivered verdicts in some of these trials.\n\nJournalist Murders / Trials\n\nThe Hrant Dink murder\n\nApplication to the Council of Europe: The Dink family applied to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decisions. In its application, the Dink family argued that the real perpetrators of the murder have not been penalised. Hrant Dink was killed in front of the Agos newspaper on 19 January 2007 in the Şişli district of İstanbul (6 December).\n\nThe Prosecutor was changed: The Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) appointed Hikmet Usta, who was the trial prosecutor of the Hrant Dink trial, as the Bakırköy Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor (3 December). Within the framework of the appeals process, Usta was investigating the connection between the Dink murder and the Zirve Publishing House massacre.\n\nChief auditor Ömeroğlu: Mehmet Nihat Önderoğlu, who was the person to examine the file in which Hrant Dink was being charged based on Article 301, and who was the person to sign the decision to punish Dink, was elected as Turkey’s first Public Chief-Auditor (Ombudsman) (27 November).\n\nSuspicion of connections with Zirve massacre: According to the news reports about the Dink murder, evidence has been discovered that the Dink Murder and the Zirve Publishing House massacres may have been committed by connected groups. It was found out that Prosecutor Muammer Akkaş will be acting upon receiving the awaited formal document (25 October).\n\nDemand for the reversal of the decision: The lawyers of the Dink family demanded that the Trabzon 1st High Criminal Court’s decision to reject the joinder of two cases in Trabzon about Ali Öz - the Trabzon Provincial Paramilitary Police Regiment Commander of the time - is overturned (20 October). A legal action had previously been brought against Öz and seven officials of the Intelligence Department at the Trabzon 2nd Criminal Court of Peace for ‘neglect of duty’ because they did not prevent the Dink murder. As this trial continued, a second lawsuit was brought against Öz at the Trabzon 1st High Criminal Court.\n\nSecrecy demand at the Constitutional Court: The lawyers of the Dink family objected to the secrecy decision on the investigation about the Hrant Dink murder carried out by the İstanbul Specially Authorised Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor for the last five years. The objection was rejected (11 October). The lawyers will appeal to the Constitutional Court.\n\nSamast's membership in an organisation: Dink's murderer Ogün Samast is standing trial at the İstanbul 2nd Juvenile High Criminal Court for 'membership in a terrorist organisation.' The bills of indictment of the Ergenekon and Action Plan Against Reactionary Forces cases have reached the court. The court rejected a request to demand the list of base stations and telephone numbers held by the Telecommunications Communications Directorate (TİB), on grounds that the continuing \"Hrant Dink murder investigation\" is confidential. The court decided to wait for the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals. Previously, the İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court had given a ruling regarding the case (18 September). The next hearing was scheduled for 31 January 2013.\n\nDuring the previous hearing, the court had decided to wait for the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals (26 April). The İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court had acquitted the defendants, including Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel, from charges of membership in a terrorist organisation citing lack of evidence.\n\nSamast was fined for threatening: The İstanbul 35th Criminal Court of Peace handed down a punitive fine that corresponds to 30 days to Ogün Samast, who is the murderer of Agos newspaper’s editor-in-chief Hrant Dink, for saying, “Only 5 years to go, we will meet again,” to Hosrof Dink. Samast received a punitive fine of 600 Turkish Liras (about 260 euros) - 20 Liras (about 9 euros) for each day, for ‘threatening.’ The fine was not postponed (28 June).\n\nThe Dink file is with the Supreme Court of Appeals: The case file regarding the Dink murder was sent to the Supreme Court of Appeals after the reasoned decision of the İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court reached the parties of the case (6 June). The court had made a ruling during the hearing on 17 January 2011, and had announced its reasoned decision about a month later.\n\nReasoned decision in the Dink murder: The reasoned decision of the Dink murder has been announced. The İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court, in its decision, stated that, \"It is not possible in penal law, to make a conviction for charges of a terrorist organisation, without any evidence, and merely by means of a logical interpretation. Even if there is such an organisation, it has not been possible to determine where, when and with what purpose it was established \" (23 February).\n\nSamast's penalty became final: The Supreme Court of Appeals upheld a prison sentence of 22 years and 10 months handed down to Ogün Samast in the Dink murder case (21 March). At the trial held at the İstanbul 2nd Juvenile High Criminal Court, Samast was sentenced to a total of 22 years and 10 months in prison for ‘felonious wilful murder’ (Article 82/1-a of TCK) and 'unauthorised possession of arms (Law No: 6136 on Firearms). Samast is expected to serve two thirds of his prison sentence in line with the Law on Criminal Execution. Samast will remain in prison for another 10 years and 8 months.\n\nDink family’s objections were rejected: The Dink family had objected to the verdict of non-prosecution about the two agents from the National Intelligence Organization (MİT), who allegedly had ‘warned’ Hrant Dink at the İstanbul Office of the Governor. The Sincan 1st High Criminal Court rejected the objection (10 March).\n\nNew trial against Cerrah and Güler: The lawyers of the Dink family submitted a letter of application to the İstanbul Office of the Vice Chief Public Prosecutor, and stated that, along with Muammer Güler, Celalettin Cerrah and 22 others, other officials of the Trabzon Provincial Paramilitary Police Command and Trabzon and İstanbul Police Headquarters, and the officials of the Intelligence Department of the Security General Directorate are all suspects in the murder (14 February). The letter of application did not contain the name these officials.\n\nİğci was acquitted: No charges were brought against Coşkun İğci, who was one of the 19 defendants of the Dink murder case and who had been released pending the outcome of the trial. İğci was acquitted during the hearing at the İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court (13 February).\n\nThe Hrant Dink murder decision: The court reached a verdict on the Dink murder case on the 25th hearing. All defendants being charged with crimes related with a terrorist organisation were acquitted. Yasin Hayal was sentenced to life in prison in solitary confinement and with no possibility of parole, for 'soliciting another person to wilfully commit a murder’ (Articles 37, 38, 82/1 of the TCK). Separately, Hayal was sentenced to three months in prison for threatening Orhan Pamuk and a year in prison for ‘unauthorised possession of arms.’ Erhan Tuncel, who was being charged with ‘membership in an armed terrorist organization’ and ‘soliciting another person to commit a murder,’ was acquitted. He was handed down a prison sentence of 10 years and 6 months for the bombing of Mc Donald’s, but then was released. Osman Hayal was acquitted of both charges. Salih Hacisalihoğlu was sentenced to two months and 15 days in prison for 'unauthorised possession of bullets.’ Ersin Yolcu and Ahmet İskender were sentenced to 12 years and six months in prison each, for ‘assisting in a felonious murder.’ İskender was sentenced to a year in prison for ‘unauthorised possession of arms’ (17 January). The Supreme Court of Appeals will decide whether the verdict about Hacisalihoğlu, Yolcu and İskender will be implemented. No verdict was reached about Yasin Hayal's uncle, Coşkun İğci. Prosecutor Hikmet Usta is taking the court decision to the Supreme Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Cihan Hayırsevener case\n\nGüney Marmara'da Yaşam (‘Life in Southern Marmara’) newspaper’s chief editor Cihan Hayırsevener was killed on 18 December 2009. During the sixth hearing at the İstanbul 10th Specially Authorised High Criminal Court, the request of 18 defendants - including three, who had been arrested pending the outcome of the trial (İhsan Kuruoğlu - the founder of the İlk Haber (‘First News’) Newspaper, Engin Arıcan – the newspaper’s publication adviser and Serkan Erakkuş, who is being charged with murder) - to have the files on ‘conspiring to rig the bids in a public tender’ and ‘murder’ separated, was rejected. The panel of judges were also changed (22 November). The next hearing was scheduled for 26 February 2013.\n\nDuring the fifth hearing of the Hayırsevener trial, the defendants’ demand to be released had been rejected. Kuruoğlu, who is being charged with instigating the murder, was taken out of the courtroom (28 August). During the fourth hearing, anonymous witness Bandırma had explained how Erakkuş, who pulled the trigger, killed Hayırsevener (22 May). During the third hearing, the court had decided to listen to the anonymous witness (28 February).\n\nHayırsevener was killed on 18 December 2009, while walking on the street in Bandırma, soon after publishing articles on the corruption in the public tenders of the municipality in October 2009.\n\nThe defendants are being charged with 'establishing an organisation to serve personal interests,' 'membership in an illegal organisation,' 'conspiring to rig the bids in a public tender,' and 'felonious and wilful homicide.’\n\nThe Musa Anter murder\n\nHamit Yıldırım, who allegedly is the gunman in the murder of the Kurdish writer Musa Anter, was arrested in Şırnak. Lawyer Mehmet Emin Aktar drew attention to the fact that this person had not been arrested for years, despite the fact that there was a criminal complaint against him. Mehmet Emin Aktar is the lawyer of Orhan Miroğlu, who was together with Anter during the incident, and who was injured. He is also the head of the Diyarbakır Bar Association. Aktar demanded that the investigation does not remain limited with Yıldırım, and questioned who protected Yıldırım, where he was protected, and how he was protected (2 July).\n\nImprisoned Journalists\n\nClick for a table of imprisoned journalists.\n\nSixty-eight journalists and 27 distributors all welcomed the month of January in prison. All journalists and distributors have been imprisoned for connections with an 'organisation,' within the scope of the Anti-Terror Law (TMK) and the Turkish Penal Code (TCK).\n\nForty-nine out of 68 journalists are in prison because of trials related to 'Kurdistan Union of Communities-Turkey' (KCK), 'PKK' and 'DYG'; six are in prison because of trials related to 'Ergenekon'; four are in prison because of trials related to the 'Marxist Leninist Communist Party' (MLKP); four are in prison because of trials related to the 'Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front' (DHKP-C); one is in prison because of a trial related to OdaTV; one is in prison because of a trial related to the 'Resistance Movement;' one is in prison because of a trial related to the ‘Revolutionary Camp;’ and one is in prison because of a trial related to the Turkish Islamic militant group İBDA-C.
