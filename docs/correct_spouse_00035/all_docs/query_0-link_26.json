        "text": "Turkey’s TV drama industry has made a quantum leap in the past decade and exported many of its dramas (dizis) to more than a hundred countries. Turkey has become the world’s second-biggest TV drama exporter after the USA in 2016. The dizi industry’s transnationalization is attributable to the tireless efforts and unique features of its associated creative industry. However, the industry has some deep problems. This paper seeks to shed light on the challenges that the Turkish TV drama industry faces. The author has conducted in-depth interviews with Producers, Directors, Scenarists, Actors and Distributors. Their replies reveal the basic characteristics and difficulties of the dizi industry and provide clues as to what needs to be done to sustain and build upon the Turkish TV drama industry’s export success.\n\nWhen celebrated Turkish TV series, Kuzey Güney (Ay Yapım, 2011 – 2013) started to be broadcast on a mainstream Turkish television channel Kanal D, a rumour appeared that it was adapted from the American television miniseries, Rich Man, Poor Man, aired in 1976 on the ABC television channel. Although there was no official information that Kuzey Güney was adapted from Rich Man, Poor Man the similarities were hard to miss. This article questions how the process of transnational format adaptation works in Turkish television by analysing Kuzey Güney (Ay Yapım, 2011 – 2013) as a case study. After briefly explaining the Turkish television industry’s encounter with the TV series format throughout its history, the article questions how foreign TV series were used as inspirational materials, ready to be adapted and produced domestically as a common practice. The article analyses Kuzey Güney by particularly focusing on the stylistic, intertextual and cultural dynamics that are activated in its creation.\n\nTürkiye has grabbed the world's attention in the last three decades for its strategic use of soft power as an instrument of cultural diplomacy. Buoyed by relative economic success in the post-Cold War period, the new ruling elites of Türkiye used Islamic practices and value-system, particularly its Ottoman past, as tools of the soft power in cultural diplomacy. Turkish dizis (television series), particularly those based on historical figures, have played a critical role in the nation branding exercise of Türkiye. These dizis have not only created a soft spot for the country, and boosted its tourism, but it also helped the government, particularly President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan project himself as a leader with potentials to lead the Muslim world or Ummah. This article assesses the role of Turkish dizis as a soft power instrument in cultural diplomacy and the nation branding of Türkiye. Interestingly, Turkish dizis were primarily produced for domestic consumption, and were not necessarily targeting foreign audience, at least in the beginning. Thus, they perform the dual function of molding public opinion within the country, while also helping create a positive image about Türkiye and its past among the foreign audience. But nostalgia of the past alone is not sufficient, if not complemented by reciprocal actions on the ground.\n\nTelevision series is one of the production types that has a wide audience in the broadcasting industry. Turkish series have a rising value that are received with a great interest both in national and international scale. In this study, how the series İstanbullu Gelin (La Novia de Estambul) presents cultural codes by creating a universal context, will be analyzed. With both its nomination for an international award and its formal features differentiation in the Turkish series industry, İstanbullu Gelin was chosen as a sample of the study. Following a survey, it is revealed that the viewers of İstanbullu Gelin are encoding the cultural codes . The study investigates which cultural codes exist , how these codes are received, how to create a universal context beyond the national in İstanbullu Gelin by conducting a questionnaire with open ended and closed ended questions, a technique that was made using the/a descriptive study method. The aim of this study is to describe how Turkish cultural values are received and how the audience gave meaning to the cultural codes through the television series and to determine of the existence of cultural codes in İstanbullu Gelin and the universal representation of these cultural codes. The method of the study is qualitative research that provides descriptive data for the topic of study and also the questionnaire technique is made use of in the study. In the study, the sample group is created to represent strong ability and it is targeted to gather systematic data through the obtained data. It is revealed that maternity and being a peer are equally sacred and most of the participants think that family, relatives and children are Turkish cultural values."
