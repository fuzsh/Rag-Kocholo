The story takes place in Unkapanı Records Market, which was once the heart of the music market. The legendary bazaar has started to leave behind its golden age.

(2006) | IMDb: 7.5\n\nWe are once again together with an Ezel Akay movie on our list of Haluk Bilginer movies. Centering two iconic figures in Turkish comedy history, Hacivat and Karagöz, the film offers an entertaining and fairy-tale-like spectacle in the truest sense of the word. 14. In the story, which takes place in Bursa in the 19th century, Hacivat and Karagöz are two workers working in the construction of the mosque built in the name of Orhan Gazi. These two are funny characters who are constantly bickering with each other. Moreover, their amusing demeanor attracted the attention of the people around, especially the other workers working in the construction.\n\nHacivat and Karagöz, whose fame spread to wider circles in a short time, began to perform in some meetings and entertainments. Everything seems to be fine, but in fact, this fame is the beginning of their disaster. Bursa was a city of critical importance at that time. It is also dangerous to make humor in the city where power struggles are fierce. Because Hacivat and Karagöz’s humor is not only entertaining, but also contains satire and ridicule. This satire and sarcasm begin to create disturbances over time.\n\nHacivat and Karagöz, who are loved by everyone and whose performances are watched with laughter, soon become people whom no one likes. The duo, who are in more and more danger to become the victims of the political and religious interests in the city, do not hesitate to speak their words no matter what. This leads them to a tragic end.\n\nDirector: Ezel Akay\n\nOther actors: Beyazıt Öztürk, Sebnem Dönmez, Güven Kıraç\n\n2) Hibernation (2014) | IMDb: 8.1\n\nIt’s time for one of the most special films of our Haluk Bilginer movies list. The film, which made Turkey proud by winning the Palme d’Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, also hosts one of Haluk Bilginer’s most special performances. A retired theater actor, Aydın moves to Cappadocia to retire. Here he starts to run a hotel inherited from his father.\n\nAt first everything is going well. Aydın has created a life routine for himself in the hotel. Sometimes he writes a column for the newspaper, and sometimes he works to write the theater history book he has always dreamed of. However, as time progresses, this order and peace begin to deteriorate. Winter has started to make its effects felt. Aydın has to spend more time with his wife Nihal and sister Necla.\n\nNihal is much younger than Aydın and has been cold to Aydın for a long time. Necla, on the other hand, moved in with Aydın and Nihal after her divorce from her husband. At the same time, he is depressed with the effect of this divorce and falling into a void. Aydın wants to get away from the problems he has with his wife and sister, and from his relations with the other inhabitants of the town he is in contact with.\n\nHaluk Bilginer, 47th with his role in the movie.

Innocence, which is remembered with the above line, is still considered by most of the authorities and moviegoers as the best film of successful director Zeki Demirkubuz.
