We are not afraid to take risks and think outside the box.\n\nOPENNESS: We believe in being direct and straight-to-the-point in our way of communication and this is precisely where we draw a strong line between success and failure. In addition, innovation and self-development require constant openness by bringing new ideas, methods, or changes to our horizon at all times.\n\nDIVERSITY: We naturally coexist under the same roof, believing in the same dream, walking the same path regardless of ethnicity, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, and social beliefs.\n\nYOUTHFULNESS: We are agile. We are dynamic. We are enthusiastic. We are here, UNITED! Our soul and core values are surrounded by a uniquely structured dynamic feel where we learn, grow and prosper TOGETHER.\n\nCustomer-oriented: We don't just deliver for our customers but also exceed their expectations.\n\nSelf-development: We constantly grow ourselves and help each other grow as well through our collective passion for learning.\n\nDiversity: We value diversity and inclusiveness formed with a family spirit as genuine as it could get.\n\nOpen communication: We believe in open communication and this is how we form our teams and base our relationships on.\n\nHaving an open mind: We create fun and always keep an open mind for our people and surroundings.\n\nBeing unique and having fun: We find joy in the work we create which could sometimes come with a little tweak of weirdness.\n\nDetermination: We are highly determined to ethically do whatever it takes to reach our goals.\n\nSimplicity: We take simplicity quite seriously in every step and process we follow.\n\nModesty: We have always been modest and always will be.\n\nUnity: We are here, UNITED!\n\nSelim Dervish\n\nFounder\n\nSelim Dervish is the Founder and Director of Academia United.
