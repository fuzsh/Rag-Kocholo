        "text": "290\n\nThe Yasak Elma series, which is the top of the ratings on Monday evenings, is a production that the audience loves with its intrigue-filled story and comedy-rich events. The series is highly appreciated with the performances of the actors, with its story that both surprises and bursts into laughter every week, making the audience say, ‘This is not all!’.\n\nBerk Oktay, who joined the series in the 4th season together with Eda Ece and Şevval Sam, who have been in the lead roles of the series since the first day, and Biran Damla Yılmaz and Murat Aygen, who came in the 5th season, are showing successful acting.

The name Handan Kılıç reminded the audience of another memory! It is a matter of curiosity what kind of bond exists between Nadir Kılıç and Handan Kılıç, the biggest enemy of Halit, brought to life by Talat Bulut! In addition to the possibility of being purely a coincidence, the audience speculates that Handan is Nadir’s sister…\n\nLet’s see what Handan Kılıç, who has just joined the series, will bring to the lives of Ender and Yıldız characters. We will watch and see…"
