        "text": "Webb's Vietnam War novel \"Fields of Fire,\" published in 1978, is generally recognized as one of the best to result from that war.\n\nWebb writes from direct experience. After graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, he attended Marine Corps officer training, graduating first in his class. He served as a platoon and company commander, and was awarded the Navy Cross, the Silver Star Medal, two Bronze Star Medals and two Purple hearts.\n\nAs presidential contender, he can address problems of national security and defense from the perspective of actual experience in the inferno of war. Polls long-term show the Republicans are generally favored over the Democrats in this dimension. Win or lose, Webb can help right the imbalance."
