The experiences of many of us former Platoon Leaders and\n\nlater\n\n> Company Commanders or Advisors, is right on target from the continual\n\n> replacement of seniors to the loss of young peers and subordinates.\n\nHis\n\n> descriptions of our daily activities is also much as I recall it to\n\nhave\n\n> been. Perhaps, for well known individuals like Webb and Ollie North,\n\ntheir\n\n> one tour experiences are embedded in their minds, much more so than\n\nthe\n\nmany\n\n> of us who went there two or more times. Maybe, some of us have more\n\nthat\n\nwe\n\n> wish to forget or ignore from the past. But this writing is a very\n\nwell\n\n> written reminder of our time over there. Thanks Mr. Webb, for both the\n\ngood\n\n> and the bad remembrances, and for the credit given the troops who\n\nreally\n\ndid\n\n> the vast majority of the real fighting..-Stolz sends-\n\n>\n\n> Heroes of the Vietnam Generation\n\n>\n\n> By James Webb\n\n>\n\n> The rapidly disappearing cohort of Americans that endured the Great\n\n> Depression and then fought World War II is receiving quite a send-off\n\nfrom\n\n> the leading lights of the so-called 60s generation. Tom Brokaw has\n\npublished\n\n> two oral histories of \"The Greatest Generation\" that feature ordinary\n\npeople\n\n> doing their duty and suggests that such conduct was historically\n\nunique.\n\n>\n\n> Chris Matthews of \"Hardball\" is fond of writing columns praising the\n\nNavy\n\n> service of his father while castigating his own baby boomer generation\n\nfor\n\n> its alleged softness and lack of struggle. William Bennett gave a\n\nstartling\n\n> condescending speech at the Naval Academy a few years ago comparing\n\nthe\n\n> heroism of the \"D-Day Generation\" to the drugs-and-sex nihilism of the\n\n> \"Woodstock Generation.\" And Steven Spielberg, in promoting his film\n\n\"Saving\n\n> Private Ryan,\" was careful to justify his portrayals of soldiers in\n\naction\n\n> based on the supposedly unique nature of World War II.\n\n>\n\n> An irony is at work here. Lest we forget, the World War II generation\n\nnow\n\n> being lionized also brought us the Vietnam War, a conflict which\n\ntoday's\n\n> most conspicuous voices by and large opposed, and in which few of them\n\n> served. The \"best an brightest\" of the Vietnam age group once made\n\nheadlines\n\n> by castigating their parents for bringing about the war in which they\n\nwould\n\n> not fight, which as become the war they refuse to remember.\n\n>\n\n> Pundits back then invented a term for this animus: the \"generation\n\ngap.\"\n\n> Long, plaintive articles and even books were written examining its\n\n> manifestations. Campus leaders, who claimed precocious wisdom through\n\nthe\n\n> magical process of reading a few controversial books, urged fellow\n\nbaby\n\n> boomers not to trust anyone over 30. Their elders who had survived the\n\n> Depression and fought the largest war in history were looked down upon\n\nas\n\n> shallow, materialistic, and out of touch.\n\n>\n\n> Those of us who grew up, on the other side of the **et line from\n\nthat\n\n> era's counter-culture can't help but feel a little leery of this\n\nsudden\n\n> gush of appreciation for our elders from the leading lights of the old\n\n> counter-culture. Then and now, the national conversation has proceeded\n\n> from the dubious assumption that those who cam of age during Vietnam\n\nare a\n\n> unified generation in the same sense as their parents were, and thus\n\nare\n\n> capable of being spoken for through these fickle elites.\n\n>\n\n> In truth, the \"Vietnam generation\" is a misnomer. Those who came of\n\nage\n\n> during that war are permanently divided by different reactions to a\n\nwhole\n\n> range of counter-cultural agendas, and nothing divides them more\n\ndeeply\n\nthan\n\n> the personal ramifications of the war itself. The sizable portion of\n\nthe\n\n> Vietnam age group who declined to support the counter-cultural agenda,\n\nand\n\n> especially the men and women who opted to serve in the military during\n\nthe\n\n> Vietnam War, are quite different from their peers who for decades have\n\n> claimed to speak for them. In fact, they are much like the World War\n\nII\n\n> generation itself. For them, Woodstock was a side show, college\n\nprotestors\n\n> were spoiled brats who would have benefited from having to work a few\n\njobs\n\n> in order to pay their tuition, and Vietnam represented not an\n\nintellectual\n\n> exercise in draft avoidance, or protest marches but a battlefield that\n\nwas\n\n> just as brutal as those their fathers faced in World War II and Korea.\n\n>\n\n> Few who served during Vietnam ever complained of a generation gap. The\n\nmen\n\n> who fought World War II were their heroes and role models. They\n\nhonored\n\n> their father's service by emulating it, and largely agreed with their\n\n> father's wisdom in attempting to stop Communism's reach in Southeast\n\nAsia.\n\n>\n\n> The most accurate poll of their attitudes (Harris, 1980) showed that\n\n91\n\n> percent were glad they'd served their country, 74 percent enjoyed\n\ntheir\n\ntime\n\n> in the service, and 89 percent agreed with the statement that \"our\n\ntroops\n\n> were asked to fight in a war which our political leaders in Washington\n\nwould\n\n> not let them win.\" And most importantly, the castigation they received\n\nupon\n\n> returning home was not from the World War II generation, but from the\n\nvery\n\n> elites in their age group who supposedly spoke for them.\n\n>\n\n> Nine million men served in the military during Vietnam War, three\n\nmillion\n\nof\n\n> whom went to the Vietnam Theater. Contrary to popular mythology,\n\ntwo-thirds\n\n> of these were volunteers, and 73 percent of those who died were\n\nvolunteers.\n\n> While some attention has been paid recently to the plight of our\n\nprisoners\n\n> of war, most of whom were pilots; there has been little recognition of\n\nhow\n\n> brutal the war was for those who fought it on the ground.\n\n>\n\n> Dropped onto the enemy's terrain 12,000 miles away from home,\n\nAmerica's\n\n> citizen-soldiers performed with a tenacity and quality that may never\n\nbe\n\n> truly understood. Those who believe the war was fought incompletely on\n\na\n\n> tactical level should consider Hanoi's recent admission that 1.4\n\nmillion\n\nof\n\n> its soldiers died on the battlefield, compared to 58,000 total U.S.\n\ndead.\n\n>\n\n> Those who believe that it was a \"dirty little war\" where the bombs did\n\nall\n\n> the work might contemplate that is was the most costly war the U.S.\n\nMarine\n\n> Corps has ever fought-five times as many dead as World War I, three\n\ntimes\n\nas\n\n> many dead as in Korea, and more total killed and wounded than in all\n\nof\n\n> World War II.\n\n>\n\n> Significantly, these sacrifices were being made at a time the United\n\nStates\n\n> was deeply divided over our effort in Vietnam. The baby-boom\n\ngeneration\n\nhad\n\n> cracked apart along class lines as America's young men were making\n\n> difficult, life-or-death choices about serving. The better academic\n\n> institutions became focal points for vitriolic protest against the\n\nwar,\n\nwith\n\n> few of their graduates going into the military. Harvard College, which\n\nhad\n\n> lost 691 alumni in World War II, lost a total of 12 men in Vietnam\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\n> classes of 1962 through 1972 combined. Those classes at Princeton lost\n\nsix,\n\n> at MIT two. The media turned ever more hostile. And frequently the\n\nreward\n\n> for a young man's having gone through the trauma of combat was to be\n\ngreeted\n\n> by his peers with studied indifference of outright hostility.\n\n>\n\n> What is a hero? My heroes are the young men who faced the issues of\n\nwar\n\nand\n\n> possible death, and then weighed those concerns against obligations to\n\ntheir\n\n> country. Citizen-soldiers who interrupted their personal and\n\nprofessional\n\n> lives at their most formative stage, in the timeless phrase of the\n\n> Confederate Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, \"not for fame of\n\n> reward, not for place of for rank, but in simple obedience to duty, as\n\nthey\n\n> understood it.\" Who suffered loneliness, disease, and wounds with an\n\n> often-contagious Ã©lan. And who deserve a far better place in history\n\nthan\n\n> that now offered them by the so-called spokesman of our so-called\n\n> generation.\n\n>\n\n> Mr. Brokaw, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Spielberg, meet my Marines.\n\n> 1969 was an odd year to be in Vietnam. Second only to 1968 in terms of\n\n> American casualties, it was the year made famous by Hamburger Hill, as\n\nwell\n\n> as the gut-wrenching Life cover story showing pictures of 242\n\nAmericans\n\nwho\n\n> had been killed in one average week of fighting. Back home, it was the\n\nyear\n\n> of Woodstock, and of numerous anti-war rallies that culminated in the\n\n> Moratorium march on Washington. The My Lai massacre hit the papers and\n\nwas\n\n> seized upon the anti-war movement as the emblematic moment of the war.\n\n> Lyndon Johnson left Washington in utter humiliation.\n\n>\n\n> Richard Nixon entered the scene, destined for an even worse fate. In\n\nthe\n\nAn\n\n> Hoa Basin southwest of Danang, the Fifth Marine Regiment was in its\n\nthird\n\n> year of continuous combat operations. Combat is an unpredictable and\n\ninexact\n\n> environment, but we were well led. As a rifle platoon and company\n\ncommander,\n\n> I served under a succession of three regimental commanders who had cut\n\ntheir\n\n> teeth in World War II, and four different battalion commanders, three\n\nof\n\n> whom had seen combat in Korea. The company commanders were typically\n\n> captains on their second combat tour in Vietnam, or young first\n\nlieutenants\n\n> like myself who were given companies after many months of \"bush time\"\n\nas\n\n> platoon commanders in he Basin's tough and unforgiving environs.\n\n>\n\n> The Basin was one of the most heavily contested areas in Vietnam, its\n\ntorn,\n\n> cratered earth offering every sort of wartime possibility. In the\n\n> mountains just to the west, not far from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the\n\nNorth\n\n> Vietnamese Army operated an infantry division from an area called Base\n\nArea\n\n> 112. In the valleys of the Basin, main-force Viet Cong battalions\n\nwhose\n\n> ranks were 80 percent North Vietnamese Army regulars moved against the\n\n> Americans every day. Local Viet Cong units sniped and harassed.\n\nRidgelines\n\n> and paddy dikes were laced with sophisticated bobby traps of every\n\nsize,\n\n> from a hand grenade to a 250-pound bomb. The villages sat in the rice\n\n> paddies and tree lines like individual fortresses, crisscrossed with\n\nthe\n\n> trenches and spider holes, their homes sporting bunkers capable of\n\nsurviving\n\n> direct hits from large-caliber artillery shells. The Viet Cong\n\n> infrastructure was intricate and permeating. Except for the old and\n\nthe\n\nvery\n\n> young, villagers who did not side with the Communists had either been\n\nkilled\n\n> or driven out to the government controlled enclaves near Danang.\n\n>\n\n> In the rifle companies, we spent the endless months patrolling\n\nridgelines\n\n> and villages and mountains, far away from any notion of tents, barbed\n\nwire,\n\n> hot food, or electricity. Luxuries were limited to what would fit\n\ninside\n\n> one's pack, which after a few \"humps\" usually boiled down to\n\nletter-writing\n\n> material, towel, soap, toothbrush, poncho liner, and a small\n\ntransistor\n\n> radio.\n\n>\n\n> We moved through the boiling heat with 60 pounds of weapons and gear,\n\n> causing a typical Marine to drop 20 percent of his body weight while\n\nin\n\nthe\n\n> bush. When we stopped we dug chest-deep fighting holes and slit\n\ntrenches\n\nfor\n\n> toilets. We slept on the ground under makeshift poncho hooches, and\n\nwhen\n\nit\n\n> rained we usually took our hooches down because wet ponchos shined\n\nunder\n\n> illumination flares, making great targets. Sleep itself was fitful,\n\nnever\n\n> more than an hour or two at a stretch for months at a time as we mixed\n\n> daytime patrolling with night-time ambushes, listening posts, foxhole\n\nduty,\n\n> and radio watches. Ringworm, hookworm, malaria, and dysentery were\n\ncommon,\n\n> as was trench foot when the monsoons came. Respite was rotating back\n\nto\n\nthe\n\n> mud-filled regimental combat base at An Hoa for four or five days,\n\nwhere\n\n> rocket and mortar attacks were frequent and our troops manned\n\ndefensive\n\n> bunkers at night. Which makes it kind of hard to get excited about\n\ntales\n\nof\n\n> Woodstock, or camping at the Vineyard during summer break.\n\n>\n\n> We had been told while training that Marine officers in the rifle\n\ncompanies\n\n> had an 85 percent probability of being killed or wounded, and the\n\nexperience\n\n> of \"Dying Delta,\" as our company was known, bore that out. Of the\n\nofficers\n\n> in the bush when I arrived, our company commander was wounded, the\n\nweapons\n\n> platoon commander wounded, the first platoon commander was killed, the\n\n> second platoon commander was wounded twice, and I, commanding the\n\nthird\n\n> platoons fared no better. Two of my original three-squad leaders were\n\n> killed, and the third shot in the stomach. My platoon sergeant was\n\nseverely\n\n> wounded, as was my right guide. By the time I left, my platoon I had\n\ngone\n\n> through six radio operators, five of them casualties.\n\n>\n\n> These figures were hardly unique; in fact, they were typical. Many\n\nother\n\n> units; for instance, those who fought the hill battles around Khe\n\nSanh, or\n\n> were with the famed Walking Dead of the Ninth Marine Regiment, or were\n\nin\n\n> the battle of Hue City or at Dai Do, had it far worse.\n\n>\n\n> When I remember those days and the very young men who spent them with\n\nme,\n\nI\n\n> am continually amazed, for these were mostly recent civilians barley\n\nout\n\nof\n\n> high school, called up from the cities and the farms to do their year\n\nin\n\n> hell and he return. Visions haunt me every day, not of the nightmares\n\nof\n\nwar\n\n> but of the steady consistency with which my Marines faced their\n\n> responsibilities, and of how uncomplaining most of them were in the\n\nface\n\nof\n\n> constant danger. The salty, battle-hardened 20-year-olds teaching\n\ngreen\n\n> 19-year-olds the intricate lessons of the hostile battlefield. The\n\nunerring\n\n> skill of the young squad leaders as we moved through unfamiliar\n\nvillages\n\nand\n\n> weed-choked trails in the black of night. The quick certainty when a\n\nfellow\n\n> Marine was wounded and needed help. Their willingness to risk their\n\nlives\n\nto\n\n> save other Marines in peril. To this day it stuns me that their own\n\n> countrymen have so completely missed the story of their service, lost\n\nin\n\nthe\n\n> bitter confusion of the war itself.\n\n>\n\n> Like every military unit throughout history we had occasional\n\nlaggards,\n\n> cowards, and complainers. But in the aggregate, these Marines were the\n\n> finest people I have ever been around. It has been my privilege to\n\nkeep up\n\n> with many of them over the years since we all came home.
