        "text": "Dear Ms. Noah,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe are unaware of a comprehensive list of every Silver Star recipient. There are partial lists available on various military and unofficial memorial websites:\n\nThe Department of Defense maintains a list of all U.S. Army Silver Star recipients since September 11, 2001: Army - Silver Star.\n\nThe Hall of Valor Project has incomplete lists of Silver Star recipients from WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and other conflicts: Silver Star Recipients.\n\nHome of Heroes also has a list of Silver Star recipients from various conflicts and service branches: Home of Heroes - Silver Star.\n\nWe searched the National Archives online catalog and located the Award Cards, 1942-1963 series in Record Group 64. This is a fully digitized collection of index cards specifying awards given to an individual that served in the Army Air Force and Air Force during World War II, Korea, and the pre-Vietnam era. The awards include the Silver Star and other personal medals for valor, gallantry, and meritorious service.\n\nIf you are searching for awards given to a specific individual, we suggest that you request a copy of their Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). OMPFs and individual medical reports for those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces who were separated from the service before October 2002 are in the custody of NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis. In many cases where Army and Army Air Corps personnel records were destroyed in the 1973 fire, proof of service can be provided from other records such as morning reports, payrolls, and military orders, and a certificate of military service will be issued. Navy and Marine Corps OMPFs were not affected by the fire. Please complete a GSA Standard Form 180 and mail it to NARA's National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel Records), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. For more information see Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NPRC is closed except for emergencies. Currently, NPRC will continue servicing requests ONLY associated with medical treatments, burials, and homeless veterans seeking admittance to a homeless shelter. If your request is urgent, please see Emergency Requests and Deadlines. Please refrain from submitting non-emergency requests such as replacement medals, administrative corrections, or records research until NPRC returns to pre-COVID staffing levels. Please check archives.gov/veterans for updates to the NPRC operating hours and status. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your research!"
