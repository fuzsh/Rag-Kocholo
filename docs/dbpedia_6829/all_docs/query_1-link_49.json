        "text": "Leasing Information\n\nRolling Mill Hill, the former home of Metro General Hospital and Metro’s government vehicle fleet center (the “trolley barns”), is located on a bluff just south of Broadway and Korean Veterans Boulevard.\n\nRolling Mill Hill is a locally designated landmark and at its heart are the hospital buildings and trolley barns, which the community insisted on preserving and adaptively reusing. The first hospital structure, a Victorian-style building dating to the 1890s, has been converted for residential use, along with a 1930s art-deco style building. The trolley barns, which have been entered on the National Register of Historic Places, were converted to office and commercial space. The historic smokestack, which is visible from several points downtown and to the east, also has been preserved and will continue to serve as a landmark and icon for the area.\n\nGrowing a neighborhood\n\nThe two converted residential buildings (the preserved Victorian and Art Deco hospital structures) and a third newly constructed building contain 72 high-end condominium units with amenities including 9- and 10-foot ceilings, massive windows with spectacular views, granite surfaces, hardwoods and other similar features. (Prospective tenants can call the condominium leasing office at 615-401-6670.)\n\nRevitalizing Rutledge Hill\n\nThe cleanup and development of Rolling Mill Hill is part of a larger rebirth of Rutledge Hill, one of Nashville’s first “suburban” neighborhoods dating from the early 1800s. A new state-of-the-art Nashville Children’s Theatre, a new government complex named for former Mayor Richard Fulton, and the new Nashville Fire Department Headquarters all have arrived. An awakening retail scene on Hermitage Avenue includes new operators such as Crema Coffee and the Copper Kettle, combined with long-established business such as the Hermitage Café, Batter’s Box, U.S. Community Credit Union and Cardwell’s Market."
