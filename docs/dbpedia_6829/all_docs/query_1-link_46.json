        "text": "After graduation from TMI and West Point, Douglas MacArthur went to the violence-torn Philippines in the days after the conclusion of the Philippine Insurrection. Traveling the Far East, he became familiar with the Japanese military and culture. In 1914, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor for bravery while performing reconnaissance behind Mexican lines during the United States’ expedition in Vera Cruz, Mexico. During World War I, MacArthur served with the 42nd Division and was credited with naming in the “Rainbow” Division because the division recruited its members nationwide. Serving as the division chief of staff and as a brigade commander, he led from the front. He led initial patrols into German lines and went “over the top” as first man out of the trenches attacking into “no man’s land.” MacArthur was awarded numerous U.S. and foreign awards for valor and was wounded twice.\n\nAfter the war, MacArthur became the Superintendent of West Point and came to be known as the Father of Modern West Point. There he initiated summer training at military installations, modernized the curriculum, started intramural sports, and curtailed hazing. In 1928, he led the U.S. Olympic Team to Amsterdam. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover appointed MacArthur as the youngest Chief of Staff of the Army in history. It was under the Hoover Administration the General MacArthur started to become controversial. When thousands of veterans protested conditions during the Great Depression by camping in Washington, D.C., President Hoover ordered regular army troops to evict them. General MacArthur took personal responsibility for the mission. Afterwards, some credited MacArthur with saving the country from communist agitators among the protesters while others vilified him for exceeding his authority and for dealing harshly with needy veterans.\n\nAlthough President Franklin D. Roosevelt kept MacArthur as the Chief of Staff of the Army, these two would also clash. The President intended to cut the military budget. MacArthur went to the White House threatening to resign and take his case to the people because he believed the cuts would result in a loss in the next war. FDR relented, and the military budget was not cut. FDR called MacArthur “the conscience of America” and America’s “best general and worst politician.” Upon retirement from the Army, MacArthur was named military adviser to the Philippines as the threat of Japanese militarism loomed ominously in Asia. The Philippine Commonwealth named him as Field Marshal.\n\nSix months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR recalled MacArthur to active duty to command the Philippine and United States’ forces. Despite improvements in training and equipment, the Philippine Army and United States’ small force was no match for the Japanese. General MacArthur led a valiant but hopeless defense of the Philippines against Japanese forces. Falling back to Bataan Peninsula nd Corregidor Island, General MacArthur begged for reinforcements, but none were sent. As the Philippine and United States’ forces—short on ammunition and disease-ridden—came close to being overwhelmed, MacArthur was ordered to leave the Philippines and lead the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. Departing by a PT boat he proceeded to Australia (PT boat flag in TMI library).\n\nFrom there, General MacArthur’s strategy centered on island hopping and bypassing Japanese strongholds en route back to liberation of the Philippines. His words, “I shall return,” became a battle cry of allied forces. General MacArthur’s strategy was in sharp contrast to that of the Central Pacific where frontal assaults against heavily defended strongholds cost heavy Marine Corps’ casualties. Many credit General MacArthur’s strategy with saving thousands of allied lives. In 1945, MacArthur returned to the Philippines and marched into Manila.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, General MacArthur assumed powers as Supreme Commander Allied Forces and accepted the Japanese surrender on the USS MISSOURI. He personally oversaw the rebuilding of Japan. A new constitution, land reforms, freedom of the press, trade unions, and women’s right to vote were radical introductions to the Japanese culture. His impact on peace in Asia, especially the refocusing of Japan from samurai to entrepreneur, is felt today and will be felt for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn 1950, with the invasion of South Korea by the communist North, General MacArthur again took command, this time of all United Nations forces. His landings at Inchon behind enemy lines are considered a brilliant military maneuver that saved an allied force on the brink of defeat in the defense of the Pusan Perimeter. Under his leadership, UN forces drove North Korean troops back to the Chinese border along the Yalu River. At that time, China entered the war by launching a massive counterattack caught the UN forces that catching UN forces by surprise.\n\nGeneral MacArthur wanted to blockade China, bomb enemy supply lines in China, and use Chinese nationalist troops in the war. Disagreements over strategy led to a sharp division between MacArthur and President Truman. Ultimately, President Truman relieved MacArthur of his command. Despite the setback, General MacArthur was given a hero’s welcome throughout the United States. In a farewell speech to Congress, MacArthur made the now famous observation that, “old soldiers never die—they just fade away.”\n\nEarliest Years in Uniform\n\nBefore Douglas MacArthur attended West Point he was one of the original 49 cadets enrolled at West Texas Military Academy (WTMA) during its first year, 1893-1894. WTMA has since become Texas Military Institute which still carries on its traditions in San Antonio, Texas. The schools first Headmaster, Rev. Allen Burleson, said MacArthur was the, \"Brightest student he had ever known,\" not withstanding the thousands he had over his lifetime. Douglas was said to be a wizard at mathematics, knew history \"up-side-down,\" and talked about famous men \"As if they were his friends.\" He was a sponge for knowledge with a photographic memory. His grade point average as a freshman was 96.3, as a sophomore 95.15, as a junior 96.3, and as a senior 97.33. In mathematics, his last two years, he earned a 97.65% and 99.07%. As a junior and senior he was awarded medals for both the highest scholarship and military achievement. Years later, General MacArthur would write that TMI gave him \"A desire to know, a seeking for reason why, a search for the truth.\" TMI prepared him well for the academic challenges of West Point. He achieved a record 93.33 % on the West Point exam (the next highest score 77.9%). At West Point, his grade point average was 98.14 and in several courses he was the only cadet ever to score a perfect 100%.\n\nDouglas was not only a scholar, he was also selected as First Sergeant of A Company his senior year at TMI, a position of significant responsibility in the small cadet corps. His classmates credit TMI with his decision to become a soldier. Again, TMI prepared him well. According to a West Point classmate, \"He entered West Point and instead of being a confused plebe, he was in many ways a veteran soldier.\" MacArthur went on to command the Corps at West Point. At TMI, he became a servant leader. He led by example and cared for those he led and his leaders. TMI's reputation for collegiate scholarship was started in part because of this concern for others. In the spring of 1896, Cadet MacArthur was taking exams seated behind Cadet Charles Quinn '96, the Battalion Adjutant. Quinn's exam results would determine if he would continue on to college. The questions toward the end of the exam became more difficult, Quinn became discouraged, placed his exam in the trash, and left. MacArthur, seeing this, pulled the test out and put it on the teacher's desk. Days later, results were announced and Quinn had passed. Cadet Quinn went on to Purdue, graduated with honors at the head of his class and became the first TMI alumnus to receive a college diploma.\n\nDouglas MacArthur was also an athlete. He captained the tennis team and in baseball, played shortstop. On the football team he was the team captain and quarterback. TMI played one team with a particularly nasty reputation for dirty tricks on the field. Douglas asked the opposing team how they would like to play, by the rules as gentlemen, or otherwise TMI was ready to give as tough as they got. The opposing team played the cleanest game ever and lost. Douglas always showed a fighting spirit for everything, whether it was in the classroom, on the drill or athletic fields.\n\nAccording to his classmates, Douglas was a \"regular fellow\" and was liked by every member of his class and teammates. He attended the school dances and girls counted him a \"prize,\" but in other ways he was different. He knew how to be at ease when the rest of the students were self-conscious. Despite his military assignments, Douglas returned to TMI three times after graduation. He visited as a lieutenant in 1911, as the youngest Chief of Staff of the Army in 1939, and finally as retiring General of the Army in 1951. General Douglas MacArthur said upon his visit in 1951, \"This is where I started, and I thank a merciful God that I am able to come back to the school again.\"\n\nTo date, TMI has produced since MacArthur’s graduation thirteen other general officers, two congressmen, two bishops, two university presidents as well as five Distinguished Serve Cross recipients. The general’s statue stands to the right side of the formation area of the Cadet Corps where he symbolically watches over the Corps. Cadet are required to salute the statue daily.\n\nIn 1954 he took command of the Division Trains and later commanded Combat Command “B” of the 2nd Armored Division in Germany. Between 1955 and 1957 he was the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, US Army Europe and NATO’s Central Army Group.\n\nReturning to the United States, General Haines became the Chief Plans Division, Plans and Policy (J-5) of the Joint Chief of Staff. In 1960, he became the Assistant Division Commander for the 2nd Armor Division. Taking command of the division he led the 2nd Armor Division during the Cuban Missile Crisis that included the movement from Fort Hood to positions in Florida and Georgia. In 1961, General Haines headed the board, which revamped army wide logistic structure.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1965, General Haines was the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Force Development, Department of the Army. Promoted to Lieutenant General he took command of III Corps and Fort Hood in March 1965. During 1966 he chaired the “Haines Board” which revamped army wide officer schooling system. In 1967 he was awarded his fourth star, promoted to the rank of general and sworn in as Vice Chief of Staff, United States Army. The next year General Haines was named as the Commander in Chief US Army Pacific. This was the height of the Vietnam War and army forces in Korea, Japan, Hawaii, Philippines, Okinawa and Thailand came under his oversight.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1973, General Haines commanded the United States Army Continental Army Command as well as the US Army Readiness Command and US Army Forces Atlantic. His command numbered 650,000 active and reserve army personal and 100,000 civilian employees. After 37 year of active duty General Haines retired on 31 January 1973.\n\nDuring his retirement as a Distinguished Eagle Scout he has held key positions with the Alamo Boy Scout Area Council for over twenty years. He is a lifetime member of the Board of Trustees of TMI. A frequent speaker at a variety of business, service clubs and churches, he is a committed Christian who is active at the parish to national level. General Haines is a graduate of the Armed Forces Staff College, Army War College and National War College. His decorations include the Combat Infantry Badge, Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with two oak Leaf clusters, Bronze Star, the Czechoslovakian Medal for Merit, order of the Crown of Italy and Italian War Cross of War for Merit. The Distinguished Reserve Drill Instructor of the Year Award is named in his honor.\n\nGeneral Haines was married to the former Sally Swift who died in 2003. She was the daughter of a fifth generation army officer. His two sons graduated from West Point to include LTC (ret) William Haines, TMI Class of 1961."
