        "meta_description": "Jim Webb in 2015Former U.S. Senator Jim Webb declared his candidacy for the Democratic presidential primary on July 2, 2015.Webb was born in Missouri and grew up in a military family, attending more than a dozen schools across the United States and in England. After attending the University of Southern California on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship, Webb earned a spot at the U.S. Naval Academy.After graduation from Annapolis, he attended the Marine Corps Officer training school and graduated first in his class. He then served as a platoon commander in Vietnam, earning the Navy Cross for heroism, as well as the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. The injuries he sustained in Vietnam led to a medical retirement from the service. He then earned his law degree at Georgetown.Webb worked on the staff of the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs and in the mid- 1980's, served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. In 1987, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy, but resigned after a year in protest over Reagan Administration's plan to reduce the size of the Navy.In 2005, a campaign to draft Webb for a Senate run in Virginia spurred him to enter the race. After winning the Democractic primary, he fought a contentious campaign against Republican incumbent George Allen and won by a slim margin. While in the Senate, Webb served on several committees, including Armed Services and Foreign Relations. He did not seek re-election in 2012.",
