        "meta_description": "Tonight’s guest is my friend Jim Webb. Jim is a former war photographer, Marine, and journalist. Jim and I met during his stint working for @blackriflecoffee at @coffeeordiemag. And from there, we hit it off with our shared love for baseball and military history. \n\n\nEpisode 33 features a discussion about Jim’s life story from childhood to present day, including his fondest memories alongside his dad James Webb Sr. — who famously authored Fields of Fire about his time serving as a Marine in the Vietnam War. Jim’s dad later became Secretary of the US Navy and has had an instrumental influence on his life. Jim discusses fishing trips alongside his dad’s Vietnam War buddies and how he continues the family tradition with his Marine teammates. Next, Jim shares what it was like as a war photographer — leaving Penn State early to journey to Afghanistan alongside his dad, ultimately to take a detour on the trip back home to Vietnam to walk the same patrol routes his dad once walked decades before. Ironically, Jim would later join the same exact unit he covered as a war photographer in Afghanistan, except serving as a Marine for a tour in Iraq.\n\n\nTowards the end of the show, we nerd out on some baseball history, including the iconic Pizza Affair at Fenway Park that’s enshrined in @redsox lore; how @bluemoonbrewco became a ballpark beer; and, how some of baseball’s greatest stars left their prime years behind to fight in war and conflict i.e. Teddy Ballgame, Jerry Coleman, and Ty Cobb.\n\nFollow Late Night History on Instagram and make sure to leave a rating of a 5-star review.",

Nick mostly grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and had a full-ride golf scholarship to Arizona State University, but lost it all after a costly mistake following the state finals. He then enlisted in the US Army and served in the Global War on Terror between 2005 and 2013. He served three tours, two to Iraq, and one in Afghanistan. He worked as both a machine gunner and a sniper. After the military, Nick served as a government contractor. All together, Nick spent a totaled 47 total months deployed.\n\nToday, Nick is the creative director for URT, a lifestyle brand in San Diego, California, as well as the C4 Foundation, a nonprofit named after the late Chuck Keating IV, who was killed in action in Iraq fighting ISIS. The C4 Foundation supports active-duty Navy SEALs and their families by providing a refuge via a ranch retreat to decompress from military service. Reach out to Nick at his company Krupto Strategic Media.\n\nEpisode 44 History Highlights:\n\n1). The infamous dive bar in Tucson, Arizona, known as The Meet Rack. It made headlines for the debauchery that occurred there. However, all walks of life entered this seedy establishment, including students from University of Arizona, tourists curious to see if the hype read in newspapers was real, and sometimes, even celebrities like Arnold Schwartzenneger, Burt Reynolds, and Elvis.\n\n2). Nick's first deployment to Iraq where his unit, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment (1/26) became the hardest hit unit — 36 casualties — since Vietnam. The 15-month tour supported the SEAL Teams, including SEAL Team 3 (the same platoon twice) and SEAL Team 5. Here, Nick tells us about providing security with a M249 SAW machine gun and a claymore on the ground level of a multi-story house where the SEALs engaged combatants from the roof.\n\n3). SKTs or Small Kill Teams in Iraq. Two Army snipers on the roof, while Nick with the machine gun and claymore mine providing security. These missions emboldened Nick to become an Army sniper.\n\n4). History of the term \"sniper\" as well as the origin of Ghillie suits.\n\n5). Sniper operations in Afghanistan and stay behind teams.\n\n6). Photographs Nick captured from Iraq that were published in Esquire, which would prove impactful later in life as a professional photographer.\n\n7). A rip-the-band-aid-off look into Nick's difficult journey returning from war and the realities that veterans of the GWOT faced without a support system.\n\n8).

Bruce “Doc” Norton served two tours to Vietnam as a member of USMC Force Recon.

Danny is a former US Army forward observer, serial entrepreneur, and nonprofit founder doing great things for the military and first responder communities.\n\nDanny and I first met many years ago when I was writing profiles for One More Wave, a nonprofit founded by former Navy SEALs that provides veterans customized surf equipment and community. Since then, we became fast friends for our shared passions of sports, tacos, and history.\n\nHistory Highlights Episode 42:\n\n1). Danny’s military family lineage that dates back to the American Revolution.\n\n2). 9/11 experiences and how that event changed the trajectory of his life.\n\n3). Remembering Jared Monti, who served as a US Army forward observer with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan, and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Country music singer, Lee Brice, later sang “I Drive Your Truck,” about Monti’s dad, Paul. The song became so popular it was voted Song of the Year at the Country Music Awards in 2013.\n\n4).

While we certainly cover some of Stephen’s life story, including his time in the British military, the bulk of the discussion is about his inspiring grandfather, Freddy Spencer Chapman.\n\nEpisode 41 History Highlights:\n\n1). The Shetland Bus — a lifeline for Norwegian citizens escaping Nazi oppression and a highway for British Special Operations Executive (SOE) officers linking up with Norwegian commandos for sabotage operations. For more info, read this article published in 2019.\n\n2). Freddy Spencer Chapman’s “Living Dangerously” book series, which includes his 1930 polar exploration in Greenland, which aimed to uncover an air route between North America and Europe by way of the Arctic.\n\n3). Stephen tells us about his personal experiences meeting the Dalai Lama. Freddy previously made a diplomatic mission to Tibet in 1936.\n\n4). Freddy’s 3 ½ years in the Malaysia jungle fighting and evading the Japanese as a member of British SOE’s Force 136. (Read more here: ⁠To Hell and Back Again: The Epic Adventures of British Commando Freddy Spencer Chapman⁠).\n\n5). “The Mad Fortnight” — Freddy and two other SOE commandos launched offensive action against the Japanese. They developed tactics to move as a small team and traveled at night along the Japanese supply lines. The SOE commandos would position themselves so one person would engage the enemy — often with IEDs, sticky bombs, and grenades — as a distraction and a second commando would move to another position to make them appear larger than they were. The three commandos wrecked 7 trains, cut a railway line in 60 pieces, and killed scores of enemy troops. In the end, the Japanese thought this was a battalion of men and sent regiments of soldiers to find them.\n\n6). Freddy’s legacy and The Chapman’s Challenge adventure race held annually in Malaysia. The race follows part of the route Freddy took to escape the jungle and get picked up by submarine.\n\n7). History of the Parachute Regiment.\n\n8). History of the Red Devils and tribute to the late Dean “Waldo” Walton.\n\n9).

Tonight, Bob tells us about how he was awarded the Silver Star with MACV-SOG; his extensive experiences with Detachment-A; and his time with the CIA in Thailand.\n\nEpisode history highlights:\n\n1). B-56 Project Sigma, explanation of MACV-SOG’s Recon and Hatchet Teams, and Bob’s Silver Star (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXYgQ4tvYE&t=22s)\n\n2). Lodge Act soldiers — Eastern Europeans who volunteered for Army Special Forces and in return would receive their US citizenship. Note: Some of these soldiers would become Distinguished Members of the Regiment i.e. the Green Beret Hall of Fame.\n\n3). Detachment-A in Berlin — https://detachment-a.org/ — the Cold War clandestine unit tasked with “stay behind” operations in Berlin in the event of a Soviet Union invasion.\n\n4). Fascinating tradecraft used throughout the 1960s like invisible ink, how to blend in as an American in Germany, and use of tabletop 3D models stashed in ceilings, which were miniature replicas of real targets. Additionally, Bob talks about OSS/CIA-developed cigarette lighters that fired a .22 bullet.\n\n5). Sketchy nature of locking-out of a WWII-era submarine in Greece.\n\n6). CIA in Thailand in the 1970s and Air America.\n\n7). Driving a flatbed truck on fire and loaded with ammunition off a CIA base in Thailand.

Plug Uglies — a now closed Irish pub in Baltimore, Maryland, named after old-timey firefighter gangs that used to start fires and get into street fights.\n\n2). Family lineage in the US military.\n\n3). Mac’s passion for books from an early age, which would prove useful as a writer and journalist years later.\n\n4). Awesome history associated with Mac’s unit, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines (2/8), which includes a tale about the first ever Medal of Honor recipient’s action captured on video (many confuse Air Force CCT John Chapman’s action in Afghanistan as the first).\n\n5). The humorous tales of the wiggling hedgehog and “the smoking crab” in Afghanistan (YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1bEDH4bwHI).\n\n6).

Lesser known service of the Army Combat Engineers alongside the Naval Combat Demolition Units on D-Day\n\n3). Mike’s EOD experiences in Vietnam/Cambodia\n\n4).

Join Matt in this special, two-part episode featuring Ret. Marine Col. Eddie Ray, one of only two Navy Cross recipients from the Gulf War. In part 1, we delve into Eddie’s unique life journey leading to the Gulf War. From his formative years in LA to his stint as a college football player at the University of Washington alongside the future NFL Hall of Fame QB Warren Moon to his early days as an enlisted Marine and junior officer, we uncover the intriguing chapters of Eddie’s life. The episode is packed with a lot of exciting history and lessons learned. Notably, a training mission that went awry and how Eddie established himself as a leader. Additionally, Eddie shares how he became involved with the Marines Light Armored Vehicles. At the time, the assignment was considered “The Kiss of Death” for an officer’s career, mainly because nobody understood how to operate the unproven LAVs.\n\nOf course, that reputation would change under Eddie, where he combined football-inspired plays with military tactics for the battlefield. But you’ll hear all about that in Part 2.

Rob has personally led or participated within six separate new military organizations, including two national strategic planning elements, and a first-of-its-kind organization to collect and integrate battlefield intelligence to identify and disable terrorist networks. In a three year period, this new team elevated the success rate of SEAL missions from 35% to 91%.\n\nWe dive into the gamut of Naval Special Warfare history across the Global War on Terror, including the establishment of SEAL Team 7 and why all veterans of that team owe Rob a green beer for putting the commissioning date on St. Paddy’s Day. We also cover the reasoning for the creation of the Cultural Engagement Units, which relied heavily on the MAVNI program; and various other topics such as women in combat, SEALs in media, and working at the White House.\n\nTonight’s guest is Doug Patteson, a 10-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, or simply put, the CIA. On this episode we cover Doug’s fascinating ancestral family history of Texans, which include both his grandfather's military service in WWII. For the majority of the show, we discuss all things espionage, including Doug’s legendary mentors (like Dick Holm on episode 27), his three overseas tours, what it was like to recruit a spy, and his opinion on the greatest movies that capture the reality of the job. Naturally, we also dig into the peculiar food Doug had to eat to gain the trust of a potential asset (i.e. a still-beating snake heart in a shot glass). Later, we cover the extraordinary life story of Peter Ortiz, among other OSS legends. Towards the end, Doug shares the impactful work he’s doing for the James Foley Foundation. Follow Doug at @TexasSpyDad, as well as @ingloriousamateurs (which is a brand that helps educate common folk like the most of us about the world of espionage) on Instagram.\n\nTonight’s guest is my friend Jim Webb. Jim is a former war photographer, Marine, and journalist. Jim and I met during his stint working for @blackriflecoffee at @coffeeordiemag. And from there, we hit it off with our shared love for baseball and military history.\n\nEpisode 33 features a discussion about Jim’s life story from childhood to present day, including his fondest memories alongside his dad James Webb Sr. — who famously authored Fields of Fire about his time serving as a Marine in the Vietnam War. Jim’s dad later became Secretary of the US Navy and has had an instrumental influence on his life. Jim discusses fishing trips alongside his dad’s Vietnam War buddies and how he continues the family tradition with his Marine teammates. Next, Jim shares what it was like as a war photographer — leaving Penn State early to journey to Afghanistan alongside his dad, ultimately to take a detour on the trip back home to Vietnam to walk the same patrol routes his dad once walked decades before. Ironically, Jim would later join the same exact unit he covered as a war photographer in Afghanistan, except serving as a Marine for a tour in Iraq.\n\nTowards the end of the show, we nerd out on some baseball history, including the iconic Pizza Affair at Fenway Park that’s enshrined in @redsox lore; how @bluemoonbrewco became a ballpark beer; and, how some of baseball’s greatest stars left their prime years behind to fight in war and conflict i.e. Teddy Ballgame, Jerry Coleman, and Ty Cobb.\n\nFollow Late Night History on Instagram and make sure to leave a rating of a 5-star review.\n\nTonight’s guest is Bill Walter — a former Air Force AC-130 gunship Aerial Gunner who has been inducted into both the Air Commando Hall of Fame, as well as the SOCOM Hall of Fame.In this episode we discuss the broad history of the AC-130 gunship, including its involvement in the Vietnam War and then later the many missions in which Bill himself personally has flown between 1978 and 2005. We discuss his experiences from Grenada and Panama to Bosnia and even Mogadishu BEFORE AND AFTER the famous Black Hawk Down saga.\n\nIf you’re curious about the history of gunships — this is the episode for you.\n\nIf you’re looking for lesser known trivial stuff, we also geek out on some food and drink history — like how Bill’s squadron had a beer machine. All the labels were changed to match an ammunition nickname, like 40 millimeter was Budweiser and so forth. He also has a very comical Halloween candy story that has a wild historical significance that I don’t think can be topped.\n\nLater in the episode, Bill shares how he helped develop the MOAB (Mo-Ab) — The Mother of All Bombs — which was famously used in Afghanistan with devastating effects. So without further ado, here is episode 32 with Bill Walter.\n\nBuy Bill's Ghostrider books documenting the history of the AC-130 gunship from 1968-1995.\n\nTonight we have a returning guest: former Navy SEAL Kirby Horrell. Kirby first appeared on the podcast back in 2021 (Episode 9) and we covered his early life as well as his combat experiences in the Vietnam War.\n\nThis time, Kirby shares his life after Vietnam, including founding several successful business ventures, returning to active-duty to serve a career in the SEAL Teams, and various anecdotes from his time in the teams. These include evacuating US embassies in Africa; developing the MK46 and MK48 machine guns; and living on a boat in Hawaii — which every waterman, including me, envies — using his paddleboard to get to work every morning. Since he was working with the SDVs, he regularly surfed for PT 🏄🏼‍♂️.\n\nLater in the episode, Kirby shares his involvement with the non-profit Saved In America, which is doing noble work to recover missing or runaway children across the country. Saved In America is a team of former Navy SEALs, former police officers, and private investigators who have safely located more than 250 children (with more than half rescued before being trafficked).\n\nTonight’s guest of the Late Night History podcast is Merryl Tengesdal.\n\nMerryl is a trailblazer in the world of aviation as she is, at this time, the only Black woman to ever fly the U-2 “Dragon Lady” spy plane. The U-2 spy plane has conducted high-altitude reconnaissance missions for the US since the 1950s and in the last 10-plus years has achieved a 97% mission success rate. The U-2 is unique in that it requires all pilots to wear specialized pressure suits to fly at altitude — which essentially makes them look more like astronauts than aviators in their single-seat cockpit.\n\nWe discuss Merryl’s life story from childhood to present day. Throughout the episode Merryl shares interesting anecdotes throughout her 13 years flying the U-2, including missions, often 8 hours or more, across five combat deployments.\n\nShe also tells us about the complicated nature of eating and drinking while in the cockpit. These meals come in toothpaste-like tubes and have some wild flavors like Zapplesauce, which is caffeinated, and even New England Clam Chowda — which as a Massachusetts guy, doesn’t sound too appetizing even for me.\n\nMerryl is the author of her memoir Shatter The Sky and has many additional anecdotes within those pages, including more detail about the humorous story she shares on here about chauffeuring Steven Spielberg to observe a landing of the Dragon Lady for the movie Bridge of Spies.\n\nYou can reach out to Merryl by visiting her website: https://merryltengesdal.com/\n\nTonight’s guests are Harold Dunnigan and Duncan Smith. Harold was born on Oct. 11, 1930, in Fall River, Massachusetts, and was raised in Santa Monica, California. He enjoyed surfing at Malibu Beach alongside surfing heroes Buzzy Trent, Matt Kivlin, and Peter Cole, then later became Santa Monica Lifeguard. In 1950, he joined the Navy and graduated from UDTR/A class 6 — for you young bucks, that’s BUD/S class 6. Harold would serve during the Korean War with UDT-1 and after the war enrolled in the UDT/SEAL reserve program. He would remain there for many years, including being recalled to active duty as an elderly SEAL during the Gulf War in the 1990s. He used to crush guys in PT and even participated in two water training jumps at the age of 60. Harold is also an avid reader and felt it was important to be well-read. He’s mentored many children and young adults as a school administrator and lifeguard. Some of Harold’s students went on to create the famous Baywatch series as well as the movie Predator. Duncan served more than 30 years in the SEAL Teams before retiring as a captain. Duncan is instrumental in bringing Harold’s story to this podcast as it took much convincing to get Harold to open up about his time in the Navy. While we mostly focus on Harold’s life story, Duncan adds great points throughout the conversation, including discussing an interesting book tradition that’s developed into a prized memento. At the end of the show, Duncan shares his important work with the SEAL Family Foundation and what they do to support SEALs and their families. Here is Episode 29 with Harold Dunnigan and Duncan Smith.\n\nTonight’s guest is with Dick Holm, a former paramilitary officer, operations officer, and station chief with the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nDick served 35 years with the CIA under 13 directors and is the recipient of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal — an award given to CIA personnel for extraordinary achievements in service. Dick is also the author of the memoir: The Craft We Chose: My Life in the CIA.\n\nFor the most part, we discuss Dick’s extraordinary life while working for the CIA between the 1960s and 1990s. We cover his fascinating work in Laos as a paramilitary officer, then later Dick’s remarkable story of survival after being severely wounded in a plane crash in the Congo. As a result of the crash, Dick was burned over 35% of his body, including his face and hands. He even lost one eye in surgery.\n\nDespite this, Dick would continue to serve at CIA, including critical assignments like running operations into China from Hong Kong, founding the Counter Terrorism Group (known today as the Counter Terrorism Mission Center), and serving multiple station chief positions throughout his career.\n\nThe Late Night History podcast returns in 2023 with Cmdr. Robert “RJ” Thomas. RJ served 32 years in the US Navy (30 of those years within Naval Special Warfare). In this episode we discuss RJ’s life story. It began growing up hunting on his family’s cattle ranch in central California. He had always wanted to become a US Navy frogman, but back in the early 1960s, one had to go to the fleet before arriving at UDT training. Eventually, RJ would pass UDT training and become a frogman. After that, he moved to SEAL Team 2 and deployed to Vietnam. At the time, he was among the best shooters in the Navy. His skills were tested after his helicopter was shot down and he had to defend the crash site with only a M1911 handgun. He would be recommended for the Medal of Honor, however, the award was downgraded to the Navy Cross. Additionally, we also cover the history of Naval Special Warfare through RJ’s eyes. We discussed his tours with UDT-22, his experiences with SEAL Team 2, and later, his career as an officer. Beyond his deployments, RJ is also a distinguished competitive shooter and was instrumental in the development of the SEAL sniper courses as well the .50 caliber sniper rifles, .300 win mags, and other SEAL Team specific gear. This is an episode that you don’t want to miss!\n\nTonight’s guest is with Bill Flavin, a retired Army Special Forces colonel with 55 years of experience working for the Department of Defense.\n\nBill has lived an extraordinary life and has a wealth of experience when it comes to war and peace.\n\nAs we do on this show we start chronologically. Bill briefly shares how his famous parents steered him away from life in Hollywood. Bill's mom, Lucile Browne, starred in movies alongside John Wayne, while Bill’s dad, James Flavin, was a character actor. James went to West Point and Bill decided he’d follow that military path too.\n\nWe discuss Bill’s extended tour to Vietnam and combat experiences in Cambodia. We also talk about his unique career within Army Special Forces, including leading a team for a program called Project Greenlight. This team operated during the Cold War and, according to Bill, was more of a psychological unit over anything. These Green Berets trained with nuclear weapons and their job was to insert behind enemy lines with mini nukes to take high value targets in the event of World War III.\n\nThankfully, the nukes were never used.\n\nTowards the end of the show, we discuss Bill’s work with NATO peacekeeping operations. This includes his role in the Balkans hunting PIFWCs in the 90s to flying into Afghanistan with FedEx for on the ground stability assessments in 2002. We close with Bill’s powerful War Peace & Justice Symposium focusing on moral injury.\n\nLearn more about the War Justice Peace Symposium here: https://www.warpeacejustice.org\n\nFollow Late Night History on Instagram: @latenighthistory\n\nTonight’s guest on the Late Night History podcast is John Wolfram.\n\nJohn is a former US Navy frogman with two combat tours to Vietnam. In between his tours, John was selected to participate in the famous mission to recover the Apollo 11 astronauts from the ocean after they had just completed the world’s first Moon landing. John shares the stories in great detail.\n\nHowever, we also talk about other frogman-specific history, including a famous instructor named Vince Olivera. John attended UDTRA — the predecessor name to BUD/S or SEAL training — class 44 and has fond memories of going through training. He remembers Olivera as a tobacco-chewing, cigar-smoking, mean-mugged frogman who had “God” written across his T-shirt. Hear what John had to say about him.\n\nSome other highlights include SERE school, wearing blue jeans in ‘Nam, and animals John kept as pets on his combat tours. Of course, to keep with tradition, we discuss the fascinating beer and food John had during the war. Towards the end of the episode, John shares his impactful missionary work returning to Vietnam years after the war ended.\n\nThis is an episode that you do not want to miss!\n\nFor those interested, I recommend grabbing John’s memoir — Splashdown: The Rescue of a Navy Frogman\n\nAlso checkout John’s YouTube for some cool pictures from his life.\n\nTonight's episode of the Late Night History podcast welcomes Remi Adeleke. Remi has lived quite the inspirational life.\n\nWe cover his childhood born into Nigerian royalty and how he lost everything and had to move to the Bronx with his mother and start a new life. We discuss how Remi went from hustling in the streets in the Bronx to achieving his dream in becoming a US Navy SEAL. He went from not knowing how to swim to enduring three Navy SEAL Hell Weeks and spending about 8 years at West Coast-based SEAL Teams.\n\nAfter three combat deployments, Remi transitioned out of the Navy in 2016 and has found success in Hollywood working alongside Transformers director Michael Bay to even producing his own short film called The Unexpected.\n\nThe Unexpected will release on Sept. 30, 2022, on Remi's YouTube Channel and is expected to be made into its own featured film. Remi is also the author of the book Transformed: A Navy SEAL's Unlikely Journey From the Throne of Africa, to the Streets of the Bronx, to Defying the Odds.\n\nFollow Remi on IG: @remiadeleke\n\nFollow LNH on IG: @latenighthistory\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Tim Clemente and other FBI agents from the Washington Field Office SWAT team were at Naval Special Warfare Development Group — more widely known as SEAL Team SIX — training in their kill house (also called shoot house). One of Tim's agents alerted him to the developments happening in New York City with early reports indicating a small plane had struck the World Trade Center. Tim's FBI team and several Navy SEALs switched the TV to a live CNN broadcast showing the North Tower on fire. Moments later, the operators watched in horror as the second plane slammed into the WTC's South Tower. Tim tells the remarkable story of responding to the terrorist attacks that day. Along the way, Tim witnessed several small acts of heroism. Following the attacks on 9/11, Tim's team participated in what later became the largest criminal investigation in history.\n\nRead the story here: An FBI Agent's Unforgettable Journey to the Pentagon on 9/11\n\nListen to Tim Clemente's Audible Original podcast titled After The Fall about the FBI's investigation following 9/11.\n\nToday’s episode is with Chris Ryan whose name may ring a bell if you’re interested in the history of the British Special Air Service otherwise known as the SAS. These days, Chris stays busy writing novels with storylines and characters based on the SAS. His portfolio contains more than 74 novels, which have been made into popular TV series. But perhaps what he’s most known for is his role with Bravo Two Zero, the fateful British SAS team that was compromised in Iraq in 1991 during the Gulf War. Chris wrote a book from his perspective of how the events transpired called “The One That Got Away,” which describes the longest escape and evasion in British SAS history.\n\nIn this episode, we lightly touch on those details. Instead, we cover British SAS history, Chris’s time at the German Alpine Guide’s Course in Germany, and the fascinating application of pink camouflage on the so-called Pink Panther, which were land rovers used by the SAS.\n\nFollow Chris Ryan on Twitter: @exsaschrisryan and Instagram: @exsaschrisryan.\n\nFind his books on Amazon.\n\nMy next guest is someone I profiled for a print story published in the summer 2022 limited edition issue of Coffee or Die Magazine. The story inside the magazine is called “The Great Adventure”: Neal McCallum’s 46 Years of Dedicated Service to Uncle Sam.\n\nSome inside baseball for ya, in December 2021, I went to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to cover the 80th anniversary of the attacks. I wrote a couple dispatches and met some interesting people, including former NFL linebacker Donnie Edwards, who played for the Kansas City Chiefs and, at the time, the San Diego Chargers. He now runs Best Defense Foundation where he brings World War II veterans back to their battlefields. Donnie introduced me to Neal.\n\nAt the time, I was only privy to Neal’s background as a US Marine having served during the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. But after speaking with him on numerous occasions, I later learned Neal had accomplished far more than I initially perceived.\n\nAfter World War II, Neal became one of the very first Sky Marshalls in the 1970s in an effort to combat the growing problem of plane hijackings so he helped enforce new anti-piracy laws. We also briefly cover Neal’s 20 years as a criminal investigator for US Customs — you can read about his big cases (which, a link will be in the description) as well as Neal’s government work with the US State Department in the 80s in Russia.\n\nFollow on Instagram: @latenighthistory\n\nPhil Marshall is the author of 18 and counting books about the history and heroism of Dustoff huey pilots in the Vietnam War. He is also a Dustoff pilot himself who was wounded during a daring nighttime mission sent to rescue three seriously wounded Americans.\n\nDustoff was the callsign for the green Huey helicopters with the Red Cross often painted on the nose or the side of the aircraft to signify its role as a medical emergency platform. They’d fly day and night, unarmed without door guns and without night vision, into hot landing zones to rescue wounded soldiers, civilians, children, and even animals. Sometimes they were shot down or crashed. If the pilots and aircrew survived death and weren’t rescued, they were either executed on the spot or taken to a prisoner of war camp to endure brutal interrogation techniques and torture.\n\nDespite this possibility, Dustoff teams always answered the call.\n\nPhil is planning to open the world's first Huey Museum in Indiana, United States.\n\nBuy Phil's books on Amazon\n\nThis episode is pretty remarkable. I interviewed author and publisher, Mick Prodger, alongside Vito Cellini — who has lived a TV-series-worthy life. Vito was born in New York City and raised in Italy. He became street tough as a gangster by the time World War II kicked off and was conscripted into the Italian Army. Upon learning the Italians would fight against the Americans, Vito had deserted, and went to join the now legendary Tito’s Partisans in Yugoslavia to fight against the Nazis.\n\nTowards the end of the war, Vito worked as a fixer for the Office of Strategic Services or OSS — the precursor to the CIA — as well as the British Special Operations Executive or SOE. During this period, Vito says he carried out “dirty work” — which meant taking out criminals operating the sophisticated black markets that stole and resold war supplies like weapons, vehicle parts, medicine from Allied shipments near Italian ports.\n\nAfter the war, Vito moved back to the US, where he became a prolific inventor and gun manufacturer with 19 patents to his name, including Cellini Stabilizers, which according to Vito, “made shooting a .45 feel like shooting a .22.” His clients and friends were Army Delta Force legends like Walter Shumate and Dick Meadows.\n\nVito has been involved in some pretty crazy and shady events throughout history.\n\nIn the 70s and 80s, Vito’s life reads like a spy novel. He was embroiled in the assassination of a high profile journalist while advising Nicaragua's President; he negotiated deals with the Italian Mafia in Naples on behalf of the US government; and he carried a machine gun on hunting trips to Mexico alongside Ruben Zuno, a very powerful member of the Guadalajara cartel who was later believed to be involved in the murder of a DEA agent.\n\nVito turns 99-years-old on August 14th and Mick tells me he is still driving — like an Italian — plays poker and goes hunting.\n\nWe couldn’t possibly cover everything in this interview. So treat this next hour or so to hear the man himself share his story. And if you’re curious in the finer details, you can read about Vito’s extraordinary life in his book Cellini: Freedom Fighter\n\nFollow on Instagram: @latenighthistory\n\nEpisode 14 of the Late Night History podcast, your host Matt Fratus interviews former Navy SEAL officer Jim Hawes. About a year and some change ago, I interviewed Jim while he was in Botswana on business. The connection was spotty at best, so we re-recorded this episode here and mostly discuss Jim's career where he had a cup of coffee at SEAL Team 2 before he took an assignment with MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. We touch on going through BUD/S — then called UDT/R with class 29 on the East Coast — and early SEAL history. We also briefly covered smokejumpers in Vietnam who were recruited by the CIA to perform resupply missions.\n\nAfterward, we go into Jim's unique role in the Congo during the Cold War. While working with the CIA, Jim had the difficult task of recruiting a mercenary navy. He pulled prime talent from brutal British soldiers of fortune underneath the famed Mike Hoare. He also received assistance from the heroic Cuban veterans from Brigade 2506 who participated in the failed Bay of Pigs. This mission ultimately chased Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara out of Africa.\n\nJim is the first Navy SEAL officer to appear on the Late Night History podcast — although he certainly won't be the last.\n\nFor 50 years, Jim never spoke publicly about his time in the Congo as the mission remained classified until the 2010s. In 2018, he authored Cold War Navy SEAL: My Story of Che Guevara, War in the Congo, and the Communist Threat in Africa.\n\nFollow @LateNightHistory on Instagram for nightly stories about war, people, food, crime, sports, and culture!\n\nFor kickass history content visit www.latenighthistory.com\n\nEpisode 12 of the Late Night History podcast welcomes a true living legend: Bob Charest. Bob Charest is a distinguished member of the US Army Special Forces Regiment aka the Green Beret Hall of Fame. Charest served in the US Army between 1956 and 1981 and completed two tours during the Vietnam War; the first with Army Special Forces and the second with MACV-SOG.\n\nHe ran Recon and Hatchet Teams. Recon Teams typically had two Americans and four indigenous troops, while Hatchet Teams were much larger assault forces consisting of about 19 people. On one of these missions, Charest was nominated for the Silver Star. Although the nomination was downgraded to the Bronze Star with Valor, Bob recently received news that his \"missing Silver Star\" was approved and his service record corrected.\n\nIn his hall of fame career, Charest also notably served two stints with a previously classified Cold War stay-behind unit in Berlin called Detachment-A. We briefly discussed this, but will do a more in-depth dive covering this unit's history in a stand-alone episode. Please visit Bob's website to learn more about Detachment-A: https://detachment-a.org\n\nJoin 13K followers of Late Night History on Instagram: ⁠⁠https://www.instagram.com/latenighthistory/⁠⁠\n\n10% Discount Code using MATTFRATUS at HR4K’s store.
