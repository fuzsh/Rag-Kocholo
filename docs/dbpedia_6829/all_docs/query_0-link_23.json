        "text": "Jim Webb is one of those people who has been successful at a lot of things.\n\nHe has earned Vietnam War commendations. He has written books. He has been elected to the Senate. He has written a screenplay.\n\nBut there are two areas where the Democratic senator from Virginia finds himself with unfinished business. One is convincing Americans that the United States put forth what he sees as a herculean effort in the Vietnam War. The other is working to maintain a good diplomatic relationship with today's Vietnam.\n\nSince 1991, Webb, 66, has returned every year to Southeast Asia to establish and strengthen business relationships. As a lawyer, he also does pro bono work with Vietnamese Americans.\n\nHe has four daughters, a stepdaughter and a son. He lives in Falls Church, Va., with his wife, Hong Le Webb, who is from Vietnam.\n\n\"Since I've been here in the Senate, one of the five or six most important objectives we've laid down was re-establishing a relationship with Vietnam as one of the strategically important countries in Southeast Asia,\" says Webb, who chairs the Senate East Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittee and is on the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services committees.\n\nWebb says he subscribes to the beliefs of Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of Singapore. \"(He) made a comment that the American effort in Vietnam, even though we were not successful in preserving an incipient democracy, nonetheless slowed down a movement in East and Southeast Asia and allowed all these colonial movements all around to mature politically and to establish systems that you're seeing today.\"\n\nThe Vietnam War and its justification have been sensitive topics for Webb.\n\n\"The United States military has been vastly underappreciated in terms of the quality of its performance and also in terms of the viciousness of the war,\" he says.\n\nWebb was born in St. Joseph, Mo., and because his father was an Air Force officer, the family moved around often â€” about 20 houses by the time he graduated from high school, he says.\n\nHe earned a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps scholarship that he used to enter the University of Southern California. One year later, he entered the United States Naval Academy.\n\nAfter graduation in 1968, he accepted a commission in the Marine Corps. He finished first in his officers training class and was a rifle platoon and company commander. He earned two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, a Silver Star and the Navy Cross for his service in the An Hoa Basin. In one incident, he uncovered three enemy bunkers and hidden intelligence documents, and he captured enemy soldiers. He left the Marine Corps in 1972.\n\nAfter Vietnam, Webb was the first assistant secretary of Defense for reserve affairs from May 1984 to April 1987 and secretary of the Navy from May 1987 to February 1988, both under President Reagan.\n\nHe'll retire from the Senate after this year.\n\n\"There's no inconsistency in my view in having fought there and, at the same time, continuing to work to get this relationship where it needs to be.\""
