Stafford, United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy as a Radio Operator, Second Platoon, Company B, First Reconnaissance Battalion, FIRST Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Central Command, in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, on 7 April 2004. In Al Anbar Province, Iraq, Corporal Stafford's platoon was on a patrol when sixty insurgents ambushed them from well-fortified positions. When his team executed immediate action to flank the enemy machine gun positions, Corporal Stafford dismounted his vehicle and, while under enemy machine gun and small arms fire charged forward across a shallow canal and up a berm. After silencing the first enemy position, he was ordered to go back over the berm and support the withdrawal of another team. With disregard for his own safety, he assaulted over the berm under withering enemy fire for a second time, and single-handedly neutralized two insurgents at point-blank range. As he pushed forward, he came upon another insurgent preparing to throw a hand grenade, and immediately warned his two teammates to take cover. The enemy grenade exploded without causing injury to his Marines. Corporal Stafford continued to lead the assault, and destroyed the enemy emplacement. Corporal Stafford's personal heroism, indomitable spirit, and heroic devotion to duty were an inspiration to those with whom he served. By his bold leadership, wise judgment, and complete dedication to duty, Corporal Stafford reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\"\n\nMORE: Bay Area Silver Star recipient protected fellow Marines with 'complete disregard for his own safety'\n\nFive men received Silver Stars after the battle. Corporal Stafford’s Captain, Brent Morel, was the only soldier killed that day. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross."
