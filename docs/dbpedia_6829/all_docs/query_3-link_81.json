        "text": "1. Description: A Gold star, 1 inches in circumscribing diameter with a laurel wreath encircling rays from the center and a 3/16 inch diameter silver star superimposed in the center. The pendant is suspended from a rectangular shaped metal loop with rounded corners. The reverse has the inscription \"FOR GALLANTRY IN ACTION\".\n\n2. Ribbon: The ribbon is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 3/32 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118; 3/64 inch White 67101; 7/32 inch Ultramarine Blue; 7/32 inch White; 7/32 inch Old Glory Red 67156 (center stripe); 7/32 inch White; 7/32 inch Ultramarine Blue; 3/64 inch White; and 3/32 inch Ultramarine Blue.\n\n3. Criteria: The Silver Star is awarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the U.S. Army, is cited for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The required gallantry, while of a lesser degree than that required for award of the Distinguished Service Cross, must nevertheless have been performed with marked distinction. Soldiers who received a citation for gallantry in action during World War I may apply to have the citation converted to the Silver Star Medal.\n\n4. Components: The following are authorized components of the Silver Star Medal:\n\na. Decoration (regular size): MIL-D-3943/11. NSN for decoration set: 8455-00-269-5758. Individual medal: 8455-00-246-3834.\n\nb. Decoration (miniature size): MIL-D-3943/11. NSN 8455-00-996-5013.\n\nc. Ribbon: MIL-R-11589/136. NSN 8455-00-252-9953.\n\nd. Lapel Button: MIL-L-11484/9. NSN 8455-00-253-0819.\n\n5. Background: a. The Citation Star was established as a result of an Act of Congress on July 9, 1918 (65th Congress, Sess II, Chapter 143, page 873) and was promulgated in War Department Bulletin No. 43 dated 1918. It was retroactive to include those cited for gallantry in action in previous campaigns back to the Spanish-American War. Per letter from General Jervey, Office of the Chief of Staff, dated February 26, 1926, is quoted in part: The Secretary of War directs as follows - The following is the amended version of paragraph 187 of Army Regulation: \"No more than one Medal of Honor or one Distinguished Service Cross or one Distinguished Service Medal shall be issued to any one person, but for each succeeding or act sufficient to justify the award of a Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service Cross or Distinguished Service Medal, respectively, a bronze oak leaf cluster, shall be issued in lieu thereof; and for each citation of an officer or enlisted man for gallantry in action, published in orders from headquarters of a force commanded by a general officer, not warranting the issue of a Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross or Distinguished Service Medal, he shall wear a silver star, 3/16 inch in diameter, as prescribed in Uniform Regulations.\" Army Regulation 600-40, paragraph 48, September 27, 1921, specified that the Citation Star would be worn above the clasp, on the ribbon of the service medal for the campaign for service in which the citations were given.\n\nb. On July 19, 1932, the Secretary of War approved the Silver Star medal to replace the Citation Star. This design placed the Citation Star on a bronze pendant suspended from the ribbon design. The star was no longer attached to a service or campaign ribbon.\n\nc. Authorization for the Silver Star was placed into law by an Act of Congress for the Navy on August 7, 1942 and an Act of Congress for the Army on December 15, 1942. The primary reason for congressional authorization was the desire to award the medal to civilians as well as the Army. The current statutory authorization for the Silver Star Medal is Title 10, United States Code, Section 3746.\n\nd. Order of precedence and wear of decorations is contained in Army Regulation 670-1. Policy for awards, approving authority, supply, and issue of decorations is contained in Army Regulation 600-8-22.\n\nArmy & AF wear a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for subsequent awards. Navy, USMC & CG wear a Gold Star for each subsequent award.\n\nA. For U.S. Army (Section 3746, title 10, U.S.C. (reference (jjj))) and U.S. Air Force Service (Section 8746, title 10, U.S.C. (reference (kkk))).members, authorized through \"An Act to Establish the Army Silver Star Medal,\" December 15, 1942. For U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Service members, authorized by Act of Congress, August 7, 1942 (Public Law 702). The Army Silver Star was originally known as the \"Citation Star\" and authorized by the same Legislation which established the Distinguished Service Cross, July 9, 1918. In 1942, the Citation Star was replaced by the Silver Star.\n\nB. Awarded pursuant to Section 3746 of 10 U, S. C.(reference @j)) (U.S. Army Service members), Section 6244 of reference (ill) (U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, or U.S. Coast Guard Service members), and Section 8746 of reference (kkk), (U.S. Air Force Service members). The Silver Star may be awarded to any individual--military, civilian, or foreign--who, while serving in any capacity with the Armed Forces of the United States, distinguishes himself or herself by gallantry in action under any of the following circumstances:\n\nAgainst an enemy of the United States. While engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party."
