        "text": "Overview[]\n\nJim Webb is an American military officer and politician. He has resided in the United States Atlantic Remnant for many years.\n\nPre-Doomsday[]\n\nJames Henry Webb Jr. was born in St. Joseph, Missouri in 1946 into a military family that frequently moved around the country (and England at one point) due to his father's service in the US Air Force. Webb's family's legacy in the military goes back much further: Webb's Scots-Irish ancestors immigrated to the American colonies from Ulster, and his family members fought in every American war since the American Revolution. Webb decided to continue the family legacy, and enlisted in the US Marines, after attending the University of Southern California on a Naval ROTC scholarship and attending the US Naval Academy.\n\nWebb served his country in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972. He was eventually decorated with the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts for his service. Webb's wounds from the war with shrapnel in his knee, kidney, and head, resulting in his removal from the field.\n\nUpon his return from Vietnam, he was assigned to be an instructor for the Officer Candidates School (OCS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He then served in the Secretary of the Navy's office for the remainder of his active duty.\n\nAfter his military service was over, Webb attending Georgetown Law and simulataneously became a writer and wrote several nonfiction books and novels, generally focusing on national defense and the lives of American servicemen. He wrote his first book, Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy, while still at Georgetown.\n\nWebb's writing career led into freelance journalism as well, eventually attracting the attention of the prestigious MacNeill/Lehrer NewsHour on PBS. The NewsHour sent him on assignment in September 1983 to cover the US military's experience in Lebanon during the ongoing civil war.\n\nThat's where he would be on Doomsday.\n\nDoomsday: Lebanon[]\n\nWebb had arrived in Beirut just before Doomsday, to cover local events for PBS's MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.\n\nOn September 26, 1983, the Marine unit that Webb was embedded with suddenly received a frantic alert from their commanders warning them of what was going on.\n\nAmerican Odyssey[]\n\nFaced with the unenviable situation of being trapped in hostile territory with no hope of reinforcements coming, the Multinational Force took two immediate steps: 1. securing its bases, personnel, and any civilians from their home countries (such as reporters like Webb, and the US Congressional delegation), and 2. Immediately begin plans for evacuation. The MNF was confident it could defend itself and its bases for as long as it took to get organized, but its leaders knew the Iranian-backed enemy forces would soon seize the opportunity to go on the offensive, and the MNF leaders had little hope of being able to deter them and accomplish their original mission now that it was patently obvious that reinforcements would never come. There was also a strong desire among the rank-and-file to try to secure the remnants of their home countries as best as they could, if they could return.\n\nThus began a long odyssey to return the MNF personnel to their homelands if possible, or to at least find them a safe harbor if they were unable to return home. Many years later, Webb would write about this experience in an autobiographical work called American Odyssey.\n\nThe MNF fleet's first stop was in Israel. The Israeli government greeted them warmly and was happy to have allied forces arrive in the area, hoping it could deter any enemies. That said, Israel already had its own problems to deal with as a result of the war, and the MNF didn't plan to stay long. The MNF fleet stayed long enough to help the Israelis secure their country before shipping out into Mediterranean again. During this time, Jim Webb helped advise the Israeli military, while writing down his observations of life in the area was like post-Doomsday.\n\nThe next stop for the MNF fleet was at Alexandria, Egypt. In September and October of 1983, there had been clashes between tourists from NATO-aligned countries vs. Warsaw Pact aligned countries, until the Egyptian government decided to house the tourists from NATO countries at Alexandria (while those from Warsaw Pact countries were housed at Port Said). The MNF fleet leaders hoped to rescue the stranded Western tourists and help repatriate them.\n\nAt first, the Alexandria expedition seemed to be going well. Vessels from the fleet moored in the harbor while some crewmen reached out to local authorities. Eventually, the stranded Western tourists were allowed to begin moving to the harbor. However, there were some elements in the local crowd at the harbor that began harassing the American and European tourists, blaming them for Doomsday. The jeers soon escalated into shoving, then fighting. Soon, a massive brawl broke out in the harbor. Webb himself leaped into the fray to help defend the tourists. Alexandrian police hurried over to break up the riot, and ordered the Westerners to quickly finish boarding the naval vessels and leave.\n\nThe MNF fleet quickly pulled out of Alexandria harbor and headed due west.\n\nNear the straits of Gibraltar, the MNF fleet encountered a Soviet naval force. A fight broke out and the MNF managed to win the day, sinking two Soviet vessels and damaging others.\n\nArriving in the USAR[]\n\nSeveral months after leaving Israel, after undergoing various challenges en route, the MNF fleet finally arrived in friendly waters in the friendly harbors of the US Virgin Islands. The leaders of the remnant US Atlantic Fleet were thrilled to receive the fresh infusion of vessels, personnel, and friendly US and Allied civilians. The commanders of the MNF vessels saluted the US Navy admirals as they boarded to greet them, and the commander of the lead MNF vessel formally turned them over to US Atlantic Command.\n\nWebb continued serving in the Navy throughout the 1990s, before finally retiring in 2002.\n\nUSAR Politics[]\n\nSoon after, Webb entered politics, entering a race to represent a neighborhood on Saint Thomas in the USAR Assembly, running as a moderate Democrat. The district Webb was running in had a heavy presence of refugees from the mainland, composed mainly of former tourists who had been stranded after Doomsday, as well as mainlanders who had been evacuated from Florida, and even some of the civilians Webb had played a role in rescuing back in Egypt. Webb won the election handily and began his career in USAR politics.\n\nWebb's primary goals in the legislature included anti-poverty efforts (endearing him to the USAR's residents in the poorer neighborhoods) as well as continued efforts to refurbish the Atlantic Fleet's vessels. In 2012, Webb was one of the strongest proponents for the successful referendum to reunite with the reemerging US mainland.\n\nIn 2016, Jim Webb was selected by the USAR Governor to be the islands' non-voting delegate to the US Congress in Torrington.\n\n{{1983: Doomsday))"
