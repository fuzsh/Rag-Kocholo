        "text": "BATTLE SHIP gray clouds lay at anchor in the Annapolis sky. On the Severn River, beyond the parade ground where the Secretary of the Navy, James H. Webb Jr., stood at attention, sailboats sauntered by. Midshipmen passed in review, dark sleeves and starched white trousers swinging in unison to the martial beat of the Marine Corps Hymn. The scene mirrored precisely the prologue to ''A Sense of Honor,'' a novel written by Webb seven years ago about this same United States Naval Academy: ''The drums begin. You can hear them, like a million heartbeats from the deepest corner of your own insides.'' Vintage James Webb - military imagery punctuated by masculine cliche.\n\nAnd not without irony, because Webb's relationship with the military has been a bruising one, ever since he joined the Annapolis class of 1968. As the Navy's new civilian leader, the latest berth in a voyage that has already made him a decorated combat veteran, a lawyer, a best-selling novelist and an award-winning journalist, he is at the helm of a military institution that has nurtured but never quite satisfied him.\n\nOn this day, he was at Annapolis to deliver a stern lecture on leadership to the young men and women who will, in their turn, run the Navy.\n\n''Somewhere in the bitter confusion of the Vietnam era, when the military was being torn apart by vicious criticism,'' he told them after the parade, ''this institution apparently either lost its guts or its esteem.'' Annapolis, he believed, had lowered its standards, and the recovery would not be painless. Training would be toughened, he told them; the honor code would be strengthened. He was going to make these young people fight for their place in the Navy's leadership.\n\n''As Dirty Harry might say: 'I know what you're thinking - is this guy getting ready to tighten up, or what?' And my answer,'' said Webb, his voice echoing ominously through the school's cavernous gymnasium as his audience of middies shifted uneasily in their seats, ''is, well, yeah, I guess so.'' The fight seems to define\n\nWebb. It is not just the time, 20 years ago, when he lost a campus championship boxing bout to a classmate named Oliver L. North, that shaped him, nor the firefights in Vietnam.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
