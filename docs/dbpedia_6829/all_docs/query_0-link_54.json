        "text": "“The sweep of this wonderful book makes it the alpha and omega of the Cold War’s truest children. It begins with pride and patriotism that comes from living with warrior fathers and ends with illusion dispelled by a bloody little war in Vietnam. It’s a brilliant personal recollection that also brings alive a forgotten period of American history.”\n\n– Wall Street Journal\n\n“Webb is a terrific writer, a great war novelist…a compelling book.”\n\n– TIME\n\n“An eloquent military memoir”\n\n– Kirkus Reviews\n\n“Webb writes not only of his life but also, of course, the forces and people who shaped him. He describes his memoir as “a love story — love of family, love of country, love of service” — and he supports those words with the candor and grace of this readable and revealing memoir.”\n\n– Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\n“I Heard My Country Calling is emblematic of many other Americans’ life stories, reflecting a sense of honor and patriotism that thankfully knows no generational bounds.”\n\n– Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\n\n“I Heard My Country Calling rings with unvarnished dictums . . . Without flinching, he tells us of the grisliness and heroism he witnessed as a Marine in Vietnam. . . . his narrative offers an inside, no-punches-held look at the life of a man to whom independence was more important than money or power. . . . riveting.”\n\n– Washington Independent Review of Books\n\n“Deeply moving . . . a delightful, mentally therapeutic, and engulfing book.”\n\n– Military Review\n\n“A fascinating account of [Webb’s] early life. . . . anintensely personal narrative that traces his development from sometime-studentto Naval Academy Midshipman, Marine officer, novelist, and political figure. .. . Fellow military brats will take particular delight in his description oftaking to the road with an impatient father and three siblings jammed into an automobile’sback seat . . . Webb’s wonderfully written book is more than a personalaccount; it is the story of a patriotic American who “heard his country calling.”\n\n– U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings Magazine"
