It is the highest award for combat valor that is not unique to any specific branch; it has been bestowed by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marines. It may be given by any one of the individual services to not only their own members, but to members of other branches of service, foreign allies, and even to civilians for \"gallantry in action\" in support of combat missions of the United States military.\n\nListed below are links to the recipients and their citations by branch of service."
