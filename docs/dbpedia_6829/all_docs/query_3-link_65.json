        "text": "Three Silver Stars were earned during a hard fight in Afghanistan last year. Two Army Special Forces soldiers and one Air Force Pararescueman received the nationâ€™s third-highest award for extreme valor while under fire in Afghanistan.\n\nThe 7th Special Forces Group team fought against what Army officials described as an elite Taliban unit, which they encountered by accident in a small Afghan village. During the ensuing eight-hour engagement, the American team lost its contact with its supporting element, which operated the vehicles, and had to walk for almost a mile while under constant enemy fire before reaching relative safety. The three commandos who received the Silver Stars were pivotal in saving the lives of their teammates during the firefight.\n\nThe three Silver Stars werenâ€™t the only medals awarded. Troops from the 7th SFGâ€™s 1st Battalion also received six Bronze Stars for Valor, three Army Commendation Medals with Valor devices, and four Purple Hearts. The Battalion itself received the Meritorious Unit Citation for its contribution in the fight against the Taliban during that six-month deployment (July 2019-January 2020).\n\nCommand Sergeant Major Brock Buddies, the senior enlisted leader of 1st Battalion, said that â€œthe event is humbling. Every year we remember the men and women of this formation, their legacy and acts of heroism.â€\n\nCongress established the Silver Star in the closing months of the First World War.\n\nDonâ€™t be surprised that and Air Force Pararescueman was on an Army Special Forces team. After Pararescuemen finish their selection and training pipeline â€“ a more than two-years affair â€“ they get assigned to either a Guardian Angel or Special Tactics/Warfare squadron. Guardian Angel squadrons primarily focus on combat search and rescue (CSAR) and personnel recovery (PR). Indeed, PJs are the only unit in the Department of Defense to be specifically trained and equipped for those mission sets. On the other hand, Pararescuemen who get assigned to a Special Tactics/Warfare squadron are often individually attached to other Special Operations units. PJs, being world-class combat medics, often fill out or complement the combat medic spot on Navy SEAL platoon, Ranger platoon, or, as in the case of this action, a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA).\n\nThe past year had been quite tough on the 7th SFG. In February, an ODA from the 7th SFG was ambushed, suffering two killed in action and several wounded. The action took place a few weeks before the signing of the peace treaty with the Taliban.\n\nLieutenant General Francis Beaudette, the commanding officer of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) presented the awards.\n\nâ€œThe actions of the warriors we are recognizing today speak volumes about them as individuals,â€ he said during the ceremony. â€œThey also clearly reflect the families and communities that shaped these men,â€ he was quoted saying during the closed event. â€œEven if they cannot be here physically â€” thank you for what your families do to support you every day.â€\n\nThe 7th SFG operates mainly in Central and South America. Green Berets assigned to the â€œRed Legion,â€ the nickname of the unit, become experts in the cultures and countries of their area of operations. This is key to mission success since Special Forces soldiers work with and through their partner forces."
