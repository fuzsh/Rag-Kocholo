Senator Jim Webb (D-VA) who served in Vietnam with the Fifth Marine Regiment presented the Bronze Star Medal to Warrant Officer Phillip O’Donnell, U.S. Army (Ret.), a Stafford Virginia resident and Vietnam veteran who served in both the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. Warrant Officer O’Donnell served as a pilot in the 336th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopters), stationed at Soc Trang, Republic of Vietnam, from January 1970 to January 1971. Although he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service by the Army during that assignment, the decoration was never presented as the result of an administrative oversight. March 12, 2010. Senator Webb’s office has been working with the Army on his behalf since January to assist in verifying O’Donnell’s eligibility for the award. Following a review of its available historical records and all documentation provided by Warrant Officer O’Donnell, the Army confirmed the award of the Bronze Star Medal was authorized. Editor’s Note: Senator Webb is a Vietnam veteran, having served with the Fifth Marine Regiment, where as a rifle platoon and company commander in the infamous An Hoa Basin west of Danang he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Silver Star Medal, two Bronze Star Medals, and two Purple Hearts. He currently serves on the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Veterans Affairs.Russell Senate Office Building (CQ Roll Call via AP Images)"
