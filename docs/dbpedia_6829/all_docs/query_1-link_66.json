Coviello, USPHS, an Assistant Surgeon who was assigned to the Coast Guard.\n\nA \"Monumental\" Task -- Part I\n\nEach year from Memorial Day to Independence Day, our nation remembers its heritage and military heroes with ceremonies and celebrations. In addition, monuments from coast to coast testify to Americans' heroic but often forgotten deeds. Unfortunately, some of these monuments are also forgotten. One such example that I had never heard of but stumbled upon in 1993, is the Alaska Veterans Memorial on George Parks Highway between Anchorage and Fairbanks. There, in the Alaskan wilderness, was a unique concrete memorial - five massive sculpted upright concrete slabs honoring each branch of our Armed Forces. So, knowing there were more monuments out there like this, The Reservist has been advertising for Coast Guard Monuments Across the USA since December 1995. In addition to contacting every district's public affairs office, we asked you, our readers, to submit USCG monuments from your local area - from your hometown village squares, cemeteries and local Coast Guard units. I found that \"ask and you shall receive\" was an understatement as I compiled a list of over 50 Coast Guard monuments. Even though our reader response was outstanding, I know there are probably more Coast Guard monuments out there that were not submitted or that we do not know about. Nevertheless, because I didn't want to cram all 50 plus monuments into a few pages with tiny photos, I decided to publish this special monuments feature over two issues. And so, Part I of \"Coast Guard Monuments Across the USA\" are primarily monuments on the east coast. Next month, we'll include the rest of the monument submissions.\n\n- Edward J. Kruska\n\nPA1, USCGR, Editor, May, 1996\n\nUSCG Bicentennial Monument\n\nNewburyport, MA\n\nThis monument was dedicated by the City of Newburyport, Mass. on Aug. 4, 1989, in anticipation of the celebration of the 200th birthday of the Coast Guard. In attendance was then-Commandant ADM Paul Yost, the Secretary of Transportation, the First District Commander and a host of dignitaries.\n\nNewburyport is the birthplace of the Coast Guard. The first Revenue Cutter Massachusetts was launched upriver at MacKay Shipyard, not far from where this monument stands on the waterfront behind the maritime museum.\n\n- William V. McGoldrick\n\nHampton, N.H.\n\nJohn Foster William Headstone\n\nBoston, MA\n\nWhile following Boston's \"Freedom Trail\" a few years ago, my family was exploring the Old Granery Burying Ground on Tremont Street and happened upon the grave of John Foster Williams. He was selected by George Washington to command the first U.S. Revenue Cutter Massachusetts. The Federal Building that houses the First Coast Guard District is named in his honor.\n\n- Lisa M. Kruska\n\nAlexandria, Va.\n\nAmerican Seaplane NC-4 Plaque\n\nPlymouth, MA\n\nThe Coast Guard shares a unique place in aviation, American and world history. A plaque placed at the Plymouth harbor by the Borough of Plymouth says: This tablet was erected by the Plymouth Borough Council to commemorate the arrival on the 31st day of May 1919 of the American Seaplane NC-4, in Plymouth Sound, on the completion of the first transatlantic flight, and the reception by the mayor of Plymouth of the Commander Pilots and crew on their landing at the Barbican.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the Coast Guard? Among the six-man crew making the first transatlantic flight was LT Elmer F. Stone, first Coast Guard Aviator, and one of two pilots aboard the NC-4 that landed in Plymouth, England. Stone is not identified with a USCG after his name although four of the six crew have USN after their names. ENS H.C. Rood, also aboard, was not listed as either USN or USCG but as radio operator.\n\n- CAPT Ken Depperman, USCG (Ret.)\n\nScituate, Mass.\n\nMount Tom Memorial\n\nHolyoke, MA\n\nOn July 9, 1946, a B-17 Bomber with 25 servicemen, including [14] Coast Guardsmen, returning from Goose Bay, Labrador, to Westover Air Force Base slammed into Mount Tom in Holyoke, located in western Massachusetts. All aboard perished. The crash site went unmarked until 1994 when someone piled rocks there as a memorial. Local resident Norman Cote noticed the rock memorial and persuaded local officials to establish a permanent monument. And so, 50 years after the tragedy, a monument was constructed at the crash site. A 50th anniversary memorial service and monument dedication [was scheduled for Saturday, July 6, 1996.]\n\n-CAPT Tom O'Hara, USCGR (Ret.)\n\nWayland, Mass.\n\nCoast Guard Academy\n\nNew London, CT\n\nBertholf Plaza\n\nCompleted in 1992, the plaza is named for Ellisworth P. Bertholf, the first Commandant of the modern-day Coast Guard. The plaza is the site of several plaques commemorating Coast Guard personnel who served in war-time.\n\nRobert Crown Park\n\nCrown Park is named for CAPT Robert Crown, USN (Ret.), a past president of the Navy League.

He was originally buried in Lubec, Maine, but in 1975 his burial site was threatened by modernization. The Corps of Cadets sailed the Barque Eagle to Lubec where his remains were exhumed and laid to rest at the Academy.\n\nUSCG World War II Monument\n\nNew York, NY\n\nA Coast Guard World War II monument is located in Lower Manhattan's Battery Park in New York City, near the ferry that takes Coasties to Governors Island. Every Memorial Day for at least the last 20 years, USCG American Legion Post No. 719, along with Coast Guardsmen from Governors Island, have had a ceremony here for our fallen Coast Guardsmen. Last year, this monument made the front page of the N.Y. Daily News around Memorial Day. The monument cost $18,000 when completed in the late 1940s. The sculptor was CPO Norman Thomas, USCG. Contractor was National Sculpture Services of New York.\n\n- CDR William J. Farrell, USCGR (Ret.)\n\nBayside, N.Y.\n\nDimitri Fedotoff White Headstone\n\nValley Forge, PA\n\nThough the modern port security unit came into being in the early 1980s, the PSU concept can actually be traced back to WWII. Early in the war, the threat of sabotage and enemy subversive action was strong. Something had to be done. Enter Dimitri Fedotoff White and Donald F. Jenks, who co-developed plans for a Volunteer Port Security Force (VPSF) at Captain of the Port (COTP) Philadelphia. Following implementation of the White-Jenks plan in 1942, more than a thousand volunteers performed security functions on the docks, wharves and waterfront in support of the war effort. The largest port security force in the U.S., Philadelphia's efforts were soon imitated by other COTPs. Dimitri Fedotoff White, born in Kronstadt, Russia Oct. 27, 1889 - emigrated to the U.S. following World War I during which he had served as a lieutenant commander in the Russian Imperial Navy, and as a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy. White is mentioned in Malcolm Willoughby's The U.S. Coast Guard in WWII. White died Nov. 21, 1950 and is buried at Valley Forge National Park's Washington Memorial Chapel outside Philadelphia. My father, Brig. Gen. Richard Stinson, is rector of the chapel and is shown in the photo at left.\n\n- By PSC Peter A. Stinson, USCGR\n\nPortsmouth, Va.\n\nDouglas A. Munro and World War II Monuments\n\nCoast Guard Training Center, Cape May, NJ\n\nA visitor to the Coast Guard Training Center at Cape May, N.J. can find at least two monuments to Coast Guard heroes. Douglas A. Munro, the Coast Guard's only Medal of Honor recipient is honored near Munro Hall with a statue that was dedicated in November, 1989. Also, Coast Guardsmen who served in World War II are remembered on the plaza outside the physical fitness complex with a replica of the monument in New York's Battery Park (see above left). Also at Cape May, one can find the ship's bell from the decommissioned CGC Cherokee, located in front of the base administration building. This bell was obtained recently and replaced a U.S. Lighthouse Service bell.\n\n- CWO3 Bill Carson\n\nTRACEN Cape May, N.J.\n\n- MK1 Ralph Maddocks\n\nUSCGR, Pennsville, N.J.\n\nWWII Patrol Frigate Monument\n\nCoast Guard Yard, Curtis Bay, MD\n\nPatrol frigates were conceived as all-purpose gunships and their design was a refinement of the British \"River Class\" frigate. They were 308-feet long and performed convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), shore support fire, anti-aircraft (AA) screen and ocean station duties in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters of Operation during World War II. Fifteen thousand Coast Guard personnel crewed 75 WWII patrol frigates. Patrol frigates were well-armed, with three three-inch 50-caliber deck guns, two twin-40 mm Bofors and eight single 20-mm Oerlikons for AA screen. ASW weapons included a Hedgehog mortar, eight depth charge throwers, two depth charge racks aft and a ram bow. Typical wartime crew size totalled about 200. Not one of them was lost during the war, attesting to the seamanship skills, leadership and combat readiness of the Coast Guard officers and men who sailed in them. In addition to the one shown here (yes, that's me pointing to the USS Orange [PF-43], which I served aboard as a Watertender Fireman in 1945-46), there are two other monuments to the patrol frigates dedicated by the Patrol Frigate Reunion Association - one at Alameda, Calif. and another will be dedicated at the CG Academy on Sept. 6, 1996 by members of the PFRA during their annual reunion in Boston.\n\nCAPT George L. Sutton, USCGR (Ret.)\n\nUnited States Navy Memorial\n\nWashington, DC\n\nThe Coast Guard is honored on one of the 22 bronze relief plaques at the U.S. Navy Memorial, located on Pennsylvania Avenue (below) in our nation's capital. The 36-by-32 inch relief (right) shows the Coast Guard doing what it does best - making rescues at sea of civilian sailors and recreational boaters in distress. This bronze relief was sponsored by past and present members of the Coast Guard, with contributions from the Chief Petty Officers Association and other private donors.\n\n- CAPT Thomas Coldwell, USN (Ret.)\n\nU.S. Navy Memorial\n\nVietnam Veterans Memorial\n\nWashington, DC\n\nAmong the 58,196 names etched on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (Wall) in our nation's capital are seven Coast Guardsman. The wall, dedicated in 1982, cost $8.5 million and is located adjacent to the Lincoln Memorial. It has become a major attraction for locals and visitors alike. The names, hometowns and other pertinent information of the seven Coast Guardsman are listed according to date of casualty.\n\n- Libby Hatch\n\nCoast Guardsmen Listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial\n\nName; Hometown; Rank; Rating; Age; Date of Death; Panel; Line\n\nDavid Charles Brostrom; Los Altos, CA; LTJG; 25; 08/11/66; 09E; 126\n\nJerry Phillips; Corpus Christ, TX; EN2; 27; 08/11/66; 09E; 128\n\nJack Columbus Rittichier; Barberton, OH; LT; 34; 06/09/68; 58W; 014\n\nHeriberto Segovia Hernandez; San Antonio, TX; FN; 20; 12/05/68; 37W; 046\n\nMorris Sampson Beeson; Pitkins, LA; ENC; 37; 03/22/69; 28W; 008\n\nMichael Harris Painter; Moscow, ID; EN1; 26; 08/08/69; 20W; 115\n\nMichael Ward Kirkpatrick; Gainesville, FL; LTJG; 25; 08/09/69; 20W; 119\n\nNavy and Marine Memorial\n\nArlington, VA\n\nFor many years, the \"Navy and Marine Memorial Dedicated to Americans Lost at Sea\" was referred to as the Coast Guard monument. The memorial was used as a backdrop for the Chief Petty Officers 75th birthday salute in the August 1995 Reservist (inset). It stands 35 feet tall and is 30 feet long, and was sculpted in aluminum by Ernest Begni del Piatta. It consists of seven sea gulls in flight above the crest of a wave and stands on a green granite base. Under an Act of Congress passed on Feb. 16, 1924, it was erected, without cost to the United States, by the Navy and Marine Memorial Association for $335,630. A Joint Resolution approved June 26, 1934, authorized the erection on public grounds in the city of Washington, D.C. Congress appropriated $13,000 for the transportation and placement of the monument, which was dedicated Oct. 18, 1934. The Report of the 68th Congress stated that \"this memorial is intended as a monument to our national life on the sea and to be affectionately dedicated to the thousands of Americans who have gone down in the sea whose destiny is so closely linked with our naval and maritime services....\" It also honors those who are still offering their lives in the performance of heroic deeds upon the waters of the world. The Coast Guard unveiled a plaque (left) here during the Coast Guard's Bicentennial in 1990.\n\n- CAPT John Bruce, USCG (Ret.)\n\nBethesda, Md.\n\nCoast Guard Monument\n\nArlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA\n\nThe Coast Guard monument at Arlington National Cemetery (Section 4), is made of white marble and is pyramid-shaped. It stands 12-feet high and was dedicated May 23, 1928 as a tribute to the Coast Guardsmen who lost their lives in World War I. The foundation and pyramid are suggestive of rocks standing in the sea along the coast, or marks of danger to navigation and represent the service ideals of steadfastness and endurance. The front of the monument has the USCG emblem on it and a sea gull, symbolic of the Coast Guard's watchful untiring spirit. The names of those in the Coast Guard who lost their lives in World War I are inscribed on the monument. The southeast side is dedicated to CGC Tampa, sunk by an enemy submarine in Bristol Channel Sept. 26, 1918. All 115 on board were lost. The northwest side is dedicated to CGC Seneca, which lost 11 Coast Guardsmen while endeavoring to salvage the torpedoed British Steamer Wellington in the Bay of Biscay Sept. 17, 1918. The architect was George Howe and the sculptor was Gaston Lachaise. Carved on the foundation: Thy Way Is In The Sea.\n\n- Arlington National Cemetery Historian\n\nUSS Serpens Memorial\n\nArlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA\n\nWhen the Coast Guard-manned USS Serpens (AKA-97) exploded and sank Jan. 29, 1945 at Lunga Beach, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, it marked the largest single disaster suffered by the Coast Guard in World War II. Only two survived the blast, while 250, including 193 Coast Guardsmen, were lost. The Serpens Monument in Section 34 at Arlington is octagon-shaped and has inscribed upon it an alphabetical listing of the deceased servicemen's names, rank and branch of service. It marks the second largest mass grave at Arlington. At the monument dedication Nov. 16, 1950, VADM Merlin O'Neill, then-USCG Commandant remarked, \"we cannot undo the past...but we can ensure...that these men shall be respected and honored forever.\"\n\n- CG Historian\n\nWaesche, Cowart, Hull Headstones\n\nArlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA\n\nJust a short walk from the pyramid-shaped Coast Guard Monument at Arlington are several graves of Coast Guard veterans. Probably the most well-known Coast Guardsman buried there is ADM Russell R. Waesche, Commandant from 1936-1946. His wife, Agnes R. Waesche, is buried alongside him. Also interred at Arlington is VADM Kenneth K. Cowart, who served as the last Coast Guard Chief Engineer from 1950-1958 and was laid to rest March 14, 1996. His headstone says: \"Coast Guard For'er.\" Buried alongside him is his wife, Adah Hatch Cowart. CG Reservist CAPT Earl B. Hull, 1881-1955, is also buried at Arlington alongside his wife, Althea B. Finn. There are many other Coast Guardsmen buried at Arlington, which is currently compiling data on numbers of service members interred there from each branch of the military.\n\n- Reservist Magazine\n\nA \"Monumental\" Task -- Part II\n\nWe're back this month [June, 1996] with a continuation of our feature on \"Coast Guard Monuments Across the USA.\" As I mentioned last month, our readers sent us over 50 USCG monument entries, and I decided to publish them over two issues. Part I depicted Coast Guard monuments primarily located in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. In this issue, you'll notice we move all around the nation, beginning with a few monuments from the north and midwest, move to the south and Gulf Coast and finally, go west! We think you'll find some of the stories behind these monuments fascinating. Our front cover this month, shown uncropped at left, was taken in 1991 (the CGR's 50th anniversary year) at the CGC Escanaba National Memorial Service in Grand Haven, Mich. The service was held, as it is every year, during the week of Aug. 4 (the Coast Guard's birthday) at the annual Coast Guard Festival. CGC Escanaba sank June 13, 1943, off southern Greenland with the loss of 101 crew...there were only two survivors. It was the second worst loss of life suffered by the Coast Guard in World War II. At far left is Escanaba survivor SN Ray O'Malley. For those of you who contributed to this two-part feature on our CG monuments, thank you!\n\nEdward J. Kruska\n\nPA1, USCGR, Editor\n\nAncient Order of Pterodactyl\n\nGloucester, MA\n\nThe Ancient Order of Pterodactyl is a group of active and retired CG aviators and air crewmen. Their plaque, overlooking Gloucester Harbor, is attached to a large boulder and is a tribute to the first USCG air station. It reads: \"In honor of the men who established Coast Guard aviation in May of 1925 on Ten Pound Island in Gloucester Harbor, home of the first continuously operating Coast Guard air station. Growth in operations and aircraft size forced a move to Salem, Mass. in 1935 and again to Cape Cod in 1970.\"\n\nCPO Tom Guthlein\n\nStation Gloucester, Mass.\n\nUSCG Legacy Monuments\n\nGovernors Island, NY\n\nAs probably everyone has heard by now, the Coast Guard is departing Governors Island as part of streamlining. To commemorate the Coast Guard's 31-year stay on the New York harbor island, the Coast Guard recently placed four monuments at each compass point on the island. The west monument, shown at right, is a tribute to area lighthouses. The east monument is a WWI and WWII remembrance of USCG involvement in the N.Y. area, while the south monument honors those from New York who fought for our nation's freedom. Finally, the north monument, facing lower Manhattan, is a tribute to the \"cradle of Coast Guard history,\" remembering Alexander Hamilton and our nation's First Congress, then-convened in N.Y. City, which passed legislation establishing the \"Revenue Marine,\" Aug. 4, 1790.\n\nLT John Shallman\n\nLANTAREA Public Affairs\n\nArmed Forces Memorial\n\nWilson, NY\n\nThis monument is located at the Wilson Historical Museum in my village of Wilson, N.Y., a harbor village of 1,200 on Lake Ontario. I drill at Coast Guard Station Niagara, Youngstown, N.Y., 12 miles away. I know this monument is not entirely a Coast Guard monument, but you very rarely see an all-CG monument in small villages. Still, I am glad the Coast Guard was not left out as it has in others I've seen.\n\nBM1 Gary S. Pettit\n\nUSCGR, Wilson, N.Y.\n\nFaces of Freedom\n\nSlovan, PA\n\nWe thought you'd like to see what a little town in Pennsylvania did for its 16 heroes who were killed during World War I and II. The people of Slovan (located west of Pittsburgh) are very proud of their local heroes and monuments shown here. One of the 16 is Coast Guardsman Seaman 2nd Class Marko Yaksic (top row, fourth from left; inset at right). Yaksic, 20, was killed Sept. 25, 1942, during the invasion on Vella Lavella, Solomon Islands while aboard LST 167. He is buried in Hickory Cemetery. There is also a mural of our Faces of Freedom in our local VFW, Barto Post 6553 (left). My son, Mike Dugas, currently in the Coast Guard, is the sailor shown saluting the mural. It was created by Susan Renee Schott, an art teacher from nearby Burgettstown, Pa.\n\nSteve M. Dugas\n\nSlovan, Pa.\n\nOhio Historical Marker\n\nCamp Perry, OH\n\nI'm one of the historians here at Camp Perry, Ohio, where the Coast Guard has done a lot of training for port security units. In October of 1995, we had an Ohio historical marker placed here at Camp Perry, within a stone's throw of Lake Erie. It reads, \"Additionally, in 1990, United States Coast Guard Reservists trained here in preparation for the Persian Gulf War.\" The text for the marker was written by another Camp Perry historian, Virgil Gordon, which I then typed up. It was exciting to finally see the fruits of our labor.\n\nAnna Bovia\n\nCamp Perry, Ohio\n\nArmed Forces Monuments\n\nDearborn County, IN\n\nLawrenceburg, in southeastern Indiana, population 4,400, is the Dearborn County seat. Outside the courthouse are a number of monuments dedicated to our Armed Forces, including one dedicated to the Coast Guard (left). It reads: \"Formed to guard the coasts against smugglers.

They maintain transmitting stations that send navigation signals all over the world.\"\n\nCWO3 Jay Enginger\n\nMSD Cincinnati\n\nUSCG Inland Lifesaving Station\n\nLouisville, KY\n\nOn Sept. 24, 1993, the Louisville Area World War II Coast Guard Committee dedicated two bronze plaques aboard the old Coast Guard Inland Lifesaving Station (below right). The plaques commemorate both the continuous operation of the Coast Guard station from 1880 to 1972 (the last inland floating lifeboat station in the Coast Guard) and the efforts of \"citizen-reservists\" in Louisville during World War II. The station now serves as the offices for the Steamboat Belle of Louisville (left of station in photo above).\n\nLCDR Chuck Polk, USCGR\n\nCGHQ (G-WTR-2), Louisville native\n\nCain Hall & Plaque\n\nRTC Yorktown, VA\n\nLT Colleen Cain was a Coast Guard Reservist who became the CG's first female HH-52A pilot in June 1979. On Jan. 7, 1982, while stationed at AIRSTA Barbers Point, Hawaii, the helicopter she was co-piloting responded to a distress call from a fishing vessel in stormy weather. The helo crashed into the side of a mountain in the Wailua Valley of Molokai, Hawaii. Cain, along with two other crew members, CDR Buzz Johnson and ASM David Thompson were killed. Cain Hall, a 100-room residence hall at RTC Yorktown, was dedicated in her memory Oct. 25, 1985. The Cain family also unveiled a bronze plaque outside the entrance to Cain Hall at the dedication (see photo above). A plaque honoring the three Coast Guardsmen is in the Barbers Point Club in Hawaii. Another plaque honoring Cain is among those at the International Forest of Friendship, Atchison, Kan. An article on Cain appeared in the March 1996 Reservist.\n\nReservist Staff\n\nCGC Cuyahoga Memorial\n\nYorktown, VA\n\nWhen CGC Cuyahoga collided with the Argentine motor vessel Santa Cruz near the mouth of the Potomac River in Virginia Oct. 20, 1978, 10 Coast Guardsman and one Indonesian naval officer died. This monument at RTC honors them.\n\nReservist Staff\n\nCanfield Plaque, Painting & Trophy\n\nRTC Yorktown, VA\n\nCongressman Gordon Canfield of New Jersey, considered the father of the CGR, introduced legislation to create the Coast Guard Reserve in 1941. To honor him, RTC Yorktown dedicated Canfield Hall in 1984. It was the first CG facility to be named after a member of Congress. The photo above right is a reproduction from the September / October 1984 Reservist showing the Canfield Hall plaque and a painting of Gordon Canfield, both unveiled at the 1984 dedication. At left is then-RADM James C. Irwin, then-Chief, Office of Readiness & Reserve, Mrs. Dorothy Canfield, second from right, and then-CAPT John N. Faigle, right, who later served as Chief, Office of Readiness & Reserve. In the photo at right is the Gordon Canfield Trophy, permanently displayed at the Reserve Officers Association Minuteman Building in Washington, D.C. For many years, the trophy was awarded to the nation's best reserve unit.\n\nLT Dave Allen, USCGR\n\nCGHQ (G-WTR-2), Alexandria, Va.\n\nUSLHS Bell Monument\n\nSeaman Bernt Riise Memorial\n\nCharleston, SC\n\nAt Base Charleston, we have two monuments. The top photo shows a U.S. Lighthouse Service bell from 1923 mounted on a concrete slab. Flanking the bell are the father-son Coast Guard team of BMCS Tom Gelwicks, Sr., left, and BMC Tom Gelwicks, Jr. The other memorial is the Bernt Riise memorial headstone. Riise was a seaman aboard the Revenue Cutter Yamacraw, who drowned at sea in 1909. The memorial stone depicted at left was found in 1982, five feet underground while digging a grave in the oldest section of Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. Originally erected by his shipmates, the memorial was recovered and placed permanently at Base Charleston as a final resting place for Seaman Riise.\n\nBMCS Thomas Gelwicks, USCG (Ret.)\n\nYN1 T. Roberts, USCGR\n\nFlagler College CGR Display\n\nSt. Augustine, FL\n\nSt. Augustine is considered by many to be the birthplace of the CGR. One of the first classes to graduate from Reserve officer training did so at St. Augustine in May 1941 at the converted Ponce de Leon Hotel, now Flagler College. From 1942-45, thousands of young recruits received their \"boot\" and advanced training at what was certainly one of the most unusual training stations of WWII. A visitor to Flagler College today will find a permanent display recognizing USCG WWII training activities (see photo above). The display includes plaques presented to the college by various groups. These plaques include Coast Guard Reserve 50th anniversary and CGR emblem plaques, two engravings and one 4-by-5 inch plaque mounted on the front center of the display which reads: \"Site of U.S. Coast Guard Training Station and Related Activities During World War II 1942-45.\" Other magazine articles and photos round out the display.\n\nTom King, Archivist, Flagler College\n\nSt. Augustine, Fla.\n\nDouglas Munro Memorial\n\nCrystal River, FL\n\nBMCM John \"Jocko\" Mahoney, left in photo, and CWO4 George Senn, USCGR (Ret.), right, were guests of the Yankeetown Coast Guard Station at the Sept. 27, 1995 dedication of the Douglas A. Munro monument honoring the Coast Guard's only Medal of Honor winner. This 5,500-pound granite monument is located in the park at the rear of Crystal River City Hall.

The E-2C was at mission's end and returning when the crew reported a fire in the port engine. It crashed in a cow pasture one-quarter mile from the runway, taking with it the four-man crew. Over 1,500 members of the CG family made contributions for St. Augustine's City Hall Square monument (below left). It was dedicated Aug. 23, 1991. Another plaque honoring the four was placed near St. Augustine lighthouse (below).\n\nLT John Shallman\n\nLANTAREA PAO\n\nCGC Blackthorn Monuments (WLB-391)\n\nSt. Petersburg, Fla. and Galveston, TX\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 28, 1980, CGC Blackthorn (WLB-391) collided with the tanker Capricorn in Tampa Bay, Fla., near the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Homeported in Galveston, Blackthorn had just completed an extensive yard period in the Tampa area and had many crew members who had never sailed aboard the vessel. The incident claimed the lives of 23 Coast Guardsmen. A 6,000-pound monument commemorating the sinking is located at the Sunshine Skyway bridge north base rest area. The monument points out the location where Blackthorn and Capricorn collided. All 23 Coast Guardsmen are listed on the 5-foot wide by 8-foot tall monument, dedicated in 1981. It was constructed of gray granite with polished face, chipped sides and back to provide the desired degree of maintenance-free permanence. The Florida Legislature named the wayside parks at each end of the Skyway Bridge \"Blackthorn Memorial Park.\" At Base Galveston, a buoy contains a commemorative plaque and is lit permanently. It looks out over Galveston Bay (right photos).\n\nMK1 Donald Kessel, Bradenton, Fla.\n\nBM1 David Devine, ANT Galveston\n\nWhite Alder Memorial Park\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nI had only been in the Coast Guard Reserve 16 months when I performed my first ADT at Base New Orleans. These photos, taken in December 1970 of the White Alder Memorial, are located on the base . CGC White Alder collided with the Formosan freighter Helena Dec. 7, 1968. The memorial is dedicated to 17 Coast Guardsmen who were killed in the collision.\n\nLCDR Chuck Polk, USCGR\n\nCommandant (G-WTR-2)\n\nAnthony L. Oneto Memorial Room\n\nEl Paso, TX\n\nDuring WWII, Anthony Oneto served as a CG Reserve officer aboard USS Cavalier. On March 11, 1947, while serving with the U.S. Border Patrol, Oneto was shot in the head four times at Indio, Calif. by a man attempting to smuggle four illegal aliens. Oneto, 30, died of the gunshots instantly. He is honored at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum & Library in El Paso with a room named after him. American Legion Post 812 in Los Angeles is also named in his honor.\n\nCWO4 T.

Stone Statue\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nCoast Guard Air Station San Diego pays tribute to the USCG's first aviator, CDR Elmer Stone, with this statue. He also was one of the crew of the Navy NC-4 that made the first transatlantic flight May 31, 1919. A plaque and montage of photos of him and fellow aviators hangs next to the plaque.\n\nCAPT William N. Taylor\n\nUSCGR (Ret.), San Diego\n\nWorld War II Patrol Frigate Monument\n\nCoast Guard Island, Alameda, CA\n\nAs a member of the Patrol Frigate Reunion Association (PFRA) and a plank owner of USS Albuquerque PF-7, I was one of the speakers at the Aug. 10, 1994 dedication ceremonies of the Patrol Frigate Monument located on Munro Circle at CG Island. The 75 Coast Guard-manned frigates of WWII are listed on the monument and are accompanied by the newly-completed flagstone and ship's bell.\n\nDavid Hendrickson\n\nFresno, Calif.\n\nEd's note: Two other monuments are dedicated to the patrol frigates - one of which was published in last month's Reservist (located at Curtis Bay, Md.); the other will be dedicated Sept. 6 at the CG Academy during the PFRA reunion in Boston.\n\nHumanitarian Mission Sculpture\n\nCoast Guard Island, Alameda, CA\n\nIn April 1979, then-PA1 Chester L. \"Chet\" Spaulding thought CG Island needed some dimensional art (sculpture). So, Spaulding, now a reserve chief and self-taught sculptor, drew a sketch of what became the \"Humanitarian Mission,\" a bronze sculpture that rests in Building 14's main entrance foyer (right). His command and CGHQ commissioned Spaulding to sculpt it slightly less than half life-size for casting in bronze. The statue's basic features were modeled from photos of Spaulding's shipmates: SK1 Grace Parmelee, CWO4 Andrew Gregorich and LTJG Kenneth Thysell. The final bronze was made at Nordhammer Art Foundry in Oakland. After only ten months of work, the sculpture was unveiled Jan. 25, 1980.\n\nPA2 Darrell Wilson & PA2 David Angle, USCG\n\n11th CG District Public Affairs (North Region)\n\nPort Chicago National Memorial\n\nConcord, CA\n\nOn July 17, 1944, in one of the worst stateside disasters of WWII, 320 Navy, Coast Guard, Marine and civilian dock workers died when the SS E.A. Bryan and S.S. Quinault Victory exploded at Port Chicago. Almost all of the men killed were African-Americans. Five Coast Guardsmen were manning a fire barge nearby and perished in the blast. Fifty years later, July 17, 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated and the five Coast Guardsmen's names are listed (above): MM1 W. Degryce, BM1 P. Broda, MM3 E. Portz, SN C. Riley and SA J. Sullivan. Behind the monument is LCDR S. Danschuk, USCG, and PS2 Scott Kendrick, USCGR. Port Chicago was torn down in 1968, but to this day, the cause of the disaster remains a mystery.\n\nPAC R. Cabral, USCGR, San Francisco\n\nEd's note: See March 1995 Reservist for Port Chicago feature.\n\nColumbia River Bar Memorial\n\nAstoria, OR\n\nThe Columbia River Bar is one of the most treacherous in the nation, if not the world. The monument in nearby Astoria honors nine Coast Guardsmen who paid the ultimate sacrifice including five from the MLB Triumph in 1961, three from UTB 41332 in 1977 and MK1 Charles W. Sexton in 1991.\n\nLT Mike White\n\nCape Disapp., Wash.\n\nCape Disappointment Plaque\n\nStation Cape Disappointment, WA\n\nThis plaque is mounted on a boulder at Station Cape D. and says: \"A memorial to all those Coast Guardsmen who made the supreme sacrifice that others might live, 1961-1982.

It says, \"Dedicated to the United States Life Saving Service, the United States Coast Guard, and those who lost their lives in service.\" Nine names are listed.\n\nLT Mike White\n\nCape Disappointment, Wash.\n\nEd's note: A larger photo of this monument is on the cover of this monuments section, p. 7.\n\nDouglas A. Munro Gravesite\n\nCGCVA 50th Munro Monument\n\nCle Elum, WA\n\nOur Coast Guard's only Medal of Honor recipient, Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro, is interred in the Veterans' section, Laurel Hills Cemetery in Cle Elum. His mother, LT Edith Munro, a WWII SPAR, (see November 1994 Reservist), is interred next to her son. The Coast Guard Combat Veterans Association dedicated a monument here Sept. 27, 1992, to commemorate 50 years since Munro's heroic actions and ultimate sacrifice at Guadalcanal.\n\nC. E. Kermen\n\nSouth Cle Elum, Wash.\n\nArmed Forces Memorial\n\nWenatchee, WA\n\nA few years ago, a veterans' memorial was erected at the convention center here in Wenatchee. I noticed right away that the USCG seal was left off. Time went by and I dropped the issue. Then, about a year ago, another CG Reservist, PS2 Harvey Gjesdal moved to town, and he noticed the deletion and was pretty outraged. He started a letter-writing campaign and contacted veterans' groups, senators and representatives. Because of his efforts, the Coast Guard emblem was finally added to the monument. As you look at the photo (above), you'll notice the emblem is centered beneath the other services' emblems. Standing next to the monument is PS2 Gjesdal, a reservist with me at Station Seattle, who is also a Deputy Sheriff for Douglas County, Wash.\n\nBMC C. M. Buick, USCGR\n\nWenatchee, Wash.\n\nUSCG Bering Sea Patrol Monument\n\nDutch Harbor, Unalaska, AK\n\nThis monument is located at Dutch Harbor in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. It was dedicated by the Coast Guard and people of Alaska on our service's bicentennial, Aug. 4, 1990. It is a tribute to the Bering Sea Patrol - those United States Revenue Cutter Service sailors who sacrificed much for Alaska and their nation.\n\nM. L. Rinehart\n\nBaltimore, Md.\n\nHula Dancer / Bathing Beauty\n\nSand Island, Base Honolulu, HI\n\nThe \"Hula Dancer\" and \"Bathing Beauty\" statues were constructed by Italian POW Alfredo Giusti during WWII to honor the women back home, waiting for the prisoners' return. Giusti was interned at a camp located on Sand Island, now the site of CG Base Honolulu. Nearly 5,000 POW's were interned between 1944-46 on Sand Island and other camps on Oahu. Today, the statues (restored in 1995) grace the entrance to the new Florence Ebersole Smith Administration Building at Base Honolulu (photo above).\n\nLCDR R.M. Dielh and MST1 R.U. Klarmann\n\nBase Honolulu, Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nAnchor Memorial\n\nBase Honolulu, HI\n\nBase Honolulu's anchor memorial is the USCG's first monument to recognize all sailors and ships lost in operations during World War II. It was dedicated Sept. 2, 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of V-J Day and the end of the war. The memorial consists of a 15-foot white anchor circumscribed by a ring of copper plates listing the names of over 900 sailors killed in action. Inside the circle are two pedestals and a large brass bell. The pedestals contain plaques which list all USCG ships lost in action and explain the memorial's symbolism. The bell was rung during the dedication, attended by ADM Robert E. Kramek, Commandant, and MCPO-CG Rick Trent, to honor those Coast Guardsmen who perished in WWII. In addition, the foundation of the bell contains a time capsule which will be opened in 50 years.\n\nLCDR R.M. Dielh and MST1 R.U. Klarmann\n\nBase Honolulu, Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nHeroes of the Coast Guard\n\nSamuel W. Allison\n\nLieutenant Samuel W. Allison, USCGR, was awarded the Silver Star during World War II for: \"conspicuous gallantry in action as Commanding Officer of USS LCI(L)-326 during amphibious landings on the French coast June 6, 1944. Displaying superb seamanship and dauntless courage, Lieutenant Allison successfully landed units of the Army, then stood off the beach for salvage duty. Realizing that the services of a control boat were urgently needed, he volunteered for this assignment and, in the face of concentrated shell fire and constant threat of exploding mines, effectively directed boat traffic throughout the remainder of the initial assault.\"\n\nHenry M. Anthony\n\nAnthony began his naval career in 1920 as an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy, and saw service aboard submarines. After transferring to the Coast Guard, he specialized in breaking rumrunner codes. Beginning in 1935, Anthony had formed a close association with Navy's Pacific Fleet intelligence officers in Hawaii and had devoted much time to breaking simple Japanese \"tuna clipper\" codes, meanwhile teaching himself Japanese -- the Coast Guard has always been on a shoe-string budget and would not pay for language classes -- so Anthony, on his own initiative, learned Japanese. He boarded all Japanese merchant vessels calling at Hawaii, on the pretext of searching for smuggled narcotics but in reality to check their routings and other sailing data. Over the years, Anthony became an authority on the Japanese merchant marine. During World War II, the Navy ordered Anthony to command a unit of the Pacific Fleet that concentrated on breaking the codes for the Japanese merchant fleet--which permitted U.S. submarines to decimate the Japanese merchant fleet during the war.\n\nRichard A. Arrighi\n\nEnsign Richard A. Arrighi, USCGR, an officer on board the cutter Escanaba, was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal on 18 August 1943, during rescue operations off Greenland on 3 February 1943. After the troopship Dorchester was torpedoed, Arrighi was the first to go over the side as a \"retriever.\" During the early hours of the rescue operations, one lifeboat, was contacted which was in fair condition. This boat had picked up the other survivors and was fairly crowded. As the lifeboat was made fast to Escanaba's side, one of its helpless members fell in between the cutter and the lifeboat. This poor man was covered with oil and the men in the lifeboat simply could not extricate him from his perilous position. ENS Arrighi, who was working in the water at the time, swam in between the boat and the ship, pulled the man out so that he would not be crushed, held him up so that a line could be put around him and helped the men in the boat get him on aboard. Arrighi was in grave danger of being himself crushed between the boat and the ship's side, but due to his disregard of his own safety and to his quick action he was spared, only to lose his life in June when Escanaba blew up. Arrighi was in and out of the water rescuing survivors, working in the dark with a rough sea running and quitting only when his, rubber suit became worn and filled with water. After that he had to be hauled on board and treated for exposure.\n\nRoss Bell\n\nLieutenant (j.g.) Ross Bell was the executive officer of the cutter, CGC Point Welcome during a tour of duty on Operation Market Time in the Republic of Vietnam. In a tragic \"friendly fire\" incident, several U.S. Air Force aircraft mistakenly attacked Point Welcome while she was on patrol during the night of 11 August 1966. With the death of the commanding officer, Lieutenant (j.g.) David Brostrom, LTJG Bell assumed command of the cutter despite being seriously wounded by the fire that killed Brostrom. He continued to exercise command until his wounds forced his relief by BMC Richard Patterson. For his actions, LTJG Bell was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nEllsworth Price Bertholf\n\nCaptain Ellsworth Price Bertholf was the first commandant of the Coast Guard. He joined the Revenue Cutter Service in 1885, beginning a long and distinguished career. While serving on the revenue cutter Bear he participated in the Point Barrow-Overland Relief Expedition of 1897-1898. Congress awarded him a Gold Medal of Honor for his actions on that expedition. He was instrumental in implementing the merger of the U.S. Life-Saving Service and the Revenue Cutter Service to form the Coast Guard in 1915.\n\nWilliam H. Best\n\nWater Tender William H. Best, a crewman of the CGC Seneca on convoy duty during the First World War, was posthumously awarded a Navy Cross \"for services in attempting to save the British merchant steamer Wellington after she had been torpedoed by a German submarine, and who lost his life when the Wellington foundered on September 17, 1918.\"\n\nFrederick C. Billard\n\nRear Admiral Frederick C. Billard served as the commandant of the Coast Guard from 1924 through his death in 1932. He was a veteran of the First World War and was awarded the Navy Cross for his service in that conflict. He oversaw the service’s expansion during the enforcement of Prohibition and reinforced the Coast Guard’s traditional tasks as well. He worked well with Congress and the Treasury Department and was loved throughout the service. Robert Johnson, in his history of the Coast Guard entitled Guardians of the Sea, wrote of Billard that \"he must rank with the greatest commandants of the Coast Guard.\"\n\nBenjamin Bottoms\n\nARM1c Benjamin Bottoms was a Coast Guard radio operator assigned to the cutter Northland's aircraft on the Greenland Patrol during World War II. He was killed when his aircraft, piloted by LT John Pritchard, crashed while attempting to rescue a downed Army Air Force B-17 crew in Greenland.\n\nWilliam L. Boyce\n\nActing Machinist William L. Boyce was a member of the crew of the cutter Seneca during the First World War. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal \"for his actions while attempting to save the torpedoed British merchant steamer Wellington, which subsequently foundered.\" Boyce was killed during the attempt.\n\nJoseph R. Bridge\n\nAviation Ordnanceman 1/c Joseph R. Bridge was posthumously awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal \"for heroic daring during a sea rescue on 18 January 1953.\" Bridge was a crewman on board a Coast Guard PBM that crashed offshore of mainland China while conducting a rescue of the crew of a Navy reconnaissance aircraft that had been shot down. He was killed in the crash.\n\nDavid Brostrom\n\nLieutenant (j.g.) David Brostrom was the commanding officer of the cutter Point Welcome during a tour of duty with Operation Market Time in the Republic of Vietnam. In a tragic \"friendly fire\" incident, several U.S. Air Force aircraft mistakenly attacked the Point Welcome while she was on patrol during the night of 11 August 1966. As soon as the Point Welcome was illuminated by flares dropped by the Air Force aircraft, he raced to the bridge, calling out orders to his crew. He was killed as he reached the bridge.\n\nFletcher W. Brown\n\nFirst Lieutenant Fletcher W. Brown, an officer on board the cutter Seneca on convoy duty during the First World War, was awarded a Navy Cross \"for heroic and distinguished service as the commander of a volunteer crew that attempted to save the British merchant steamer Wellington after she had been torpedoed by a German submarine. They persisted in that attempt until the Wellington foundered on 17 September 1918. \"\n\nNathan Bruckenthal\n\nOn April 25, 2004, Damage Controlman Third Class Nathan Bruckenthal, USCG, from Smithtown, New York, and two U. S. Navy sailors were killed in the line of duty while conducting maritime intercept operations in the North Arabian Gulf. He and six other coalition sailors attempted to board a small boat near the Iraqi Khawr Al Amaya Oil Terminal. As they boarded the boat it exploded. Petty Officer Bruckenthal died later from injuries sustained in the explosion. Petty Officer Bruckenthal was the first Coast Guardsman killed in action since the Vietnam War. He was assigned to Tactical Law Enforcement South in Miami, Florida and deployed with Coast Guard Patrol Forces Southwest Asia aboard the USS Firebolt. This was his second deployment to the Arabian Gulf for Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nRichard L. Burke\n\nCaptain Richard L. Burke was a Coast Guard aviation pioneer who participated in numerous rescues and ensured that aviation would play a central role in Coast Guard operations. He earned his wings in 1931 and immediately became one of the best Coast Guard pilots of the time, specializing in open-ocean rescues while flying Coast Guard flying boats. In 1933 he made the first open-ocean rescue ever in a Douglas RD Dolphin, a feat for which President Franklin Roosevelt awarded him the first of two Distinguished Flying Crosses he earned during his career. He was also awarded a Silver Lifesaving Medal for another daring open-ocean rescue flight. He became the commanding officer of Air Station Cape May in 1933 and served there until 1940 where he currently served as the chief pilot for Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau. He later served as the commanding officer of Air Station Elizabeth City during the Second World War, where he was responsible for saving dozens of lives of seamen from torpedoed merchant ships. After the war he served as the Air-Sea Rescue Officer for the Eastern Sea Frontier Headquarters, coordinating the air-sea rescue activities of all of the armed services of the U.S. He then served as the Chief, Aviation Division of the Coast Guard.\n\nJohn Cahoone\n\nCaptain John Cahoone commanded the revenue cutter Vigilant during its engagement with the British privateer Dart during the War of 1812. The Dart had preyed upon Yankee shipping in Long Island Sound for some time, taking 20 to 30 vessels. She appeared off Newport on 4 October 1813 with two freshly caught prizes, and this braggadocio proved her undoing. Capt. Cahoone took 20 Navy volunteers on board to augment his regular crew and made sail to engage the brazen Britisher. Vigilant boldly sailed well within gun range of the more heavily armed sloop and loosed a broadside, which stunned the privateer. A boarding party from the revenue cutter quickly scrambled aboard the enemy vessel as she brushed alongside her quarry and quickly carried the Briton. Vigilant lost two men in the engagement, both of whom fell into the water and drowned while attempting to board.\n\nHugh George Campbell\n\nHugh George Campbell was born in South Carolina in 1760 and, in 1775 he volunteered to serve on board the Defense, the first man-of-war commissioned by the council of South Carolina in the Revolutionary War. He began his career in the Revenue Cutter Service in 1791, when he received an appointment as first mate on board the revenue cutter South Carolina. By 1798, he was promoted to master and served with great distinction in the Quasi-War with France. As captain of the cutter Eagle, Campbell captured more enemy vessels than any other cutter captain and most other navy captains. In the summer of 1799, the U.S. Navy appointed him “master commandant” and by the fall of 1800 he was commissioned a captain in the navy. He later enjoyed a distinguished naval career as a senior captain commanding the USS Constellation and USS Constitution. During the War of 1812, he commanded a fleet of gunboats out of St. Marys, Georgia, which captured some of the first enemy vessels of the war. He died in 1820, during an overland trip from Charleston, S.C., to Washington, D.C.\n\nFrancis Cartigan\n\nCaptain Francis Cartigan commanded the revenue cutter Alabama during the Revenue Marine Services attempt to rid the Gulf of Mexico of pirates. He and his crew, with the assistance of the revenue cutter Louisiana, destroyed a pirate rendezvous point on Breton Island in 1820.\n\nWilliam H. Cashman\n\nOn 9 March 1928 a pulling surfboat with nine men aboard, under the command of Boatswain's Mate First Class William Cashman, got underway from the Manomet Life-Saving to go to the rescue of the steamer Robert E. Lee. The Lee had grounded on Mary Ann Rocks in a heavy gale. While returning to the station the surfboat capsized due to extremely heavy seas, spilling all nine men into the water. Six were rescued but \"Captain\" Cashman, Surfman Frank W. Griswold, and Surfman Edward R. Stark perished in the line of duty in the freezing water. During the on-going search and rescue operations all 236 passengers and crew from the Robert E. Lee were saved.\n\nWilliam P. Chadwick\n\nKeeper William P. Chadwick of the Green Island Lifeboat Station in New Jersey was awarded the Gold Lifesaving medal for the rescue of the crew of the schooner George Taulane on 3 February 1880. Even after suffering a debilitating injury from flying debris, Chadwick directed the repeated efforts to save the crew of the broken Taulane. Finally after 5 Â½ hours, Chadwick’s men were able to erect a breeches buoy. Within a half-hour all of the Taulane’s crew were safely ashore.\n\nGarner J. Churchill\n\nChief Warrant Officer (Boatswain) Garner J. Churchill of Humboldt Bay Lifeboat Station, California, was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for the rescue of the sinking vessel Rena. His crew, however, were only awarded Silver Life-Saving medals, and he refused to accept his gold medal unless the crew also received the gold medal. The Department proved to be unwilling to change the award, and he therefore took the lesser Silver Lifesaving Medal along with his crew. His son noted that he took the Silver Life-Saving Medal because \"he felt that he had done no more than his men.\" During the Second World War, while attempting to rescue the crew of a torpedoed freighter in a 36-foot motor life boat, he evaded and narrowly escaped attack from a Japanese submarine.\n\nPaul L. Clark\n\nF 1/c Paul Leaman Clark was awarded a Navy Cross, one of only six awarded to Coast Guardsmen during World War II, for his actions during the invasion of North Africa in November 1942. His citation reads: \"For extraordinary heroism while serving as engineer of a landing boat attached to the USS JOSEPH T. DICKMAN during the assault on and occupation of French Morocco from November 8 to 11, 1942. When a hostile plane strafed his boat with machinegun fire, mortally wounding the bow man and severely injuring the coxswain, Clark with quick initiative immediately withdrew from the beach. Speeding toward the USS PALMER, he placed the wounded men aboard and, although his craft was riddled by enemy bullets, courageously returned to his station at the beach.\"\n\nMalachi Corbell, Keeper\n\nKeeper Malachi Corbell saved two African-American fishermen whose boat capsized near Caffey's Inlet, North Carolina. In June, 1877 he was awarded a Silver Lifesaving Medal, becoming the first member of the U.S. Life-Saving Service to earn one of the newly instituted Treasury Department life-saving medals.\n\nT. James Crotty\n\nLieutenant T. James Crotty was an expert on mine recovery and served with United States forces in the Philippines at the start of the Second World War. There he carried out special demolition work during the retreat of American and Filipino forces from Bataan to Corregidor. He then served as the executive officer of the USS Quail, which swept clear channels to the island and also bombarded Japanese forces on Bataan. Crotty was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army after the surrender of Corregidor in May 1942. He died later that fall of diphtheria. He was one of only three Coast Guardsmen held as prisoners of war during the 20th century.\n\nJoseph L. Crowe, Jr.\n\nCaptain Joseph L. Crowe, Jr., was a noted Coast Guard aviator responsible for numerous rescues during peacetime and war and for his abilities as a leader, planner, and pilot. From 1971 to 1972, Crowe served as an exchange pilot with the Air Force's 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in Vietnam, flying numerous combat search and rescue missions. In June, 1971, he flew a combat rescue mission behind enemy lines to rescue successfully two downed airmen. Another combat rescue mission took place in April, 1972, when Crowe attempted to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton, USAF, who was made famous in the book Bat 21 (by William C. Anderson). Due to heavy enemy fire that riddled his HH-53C \"Super Jolly,\" however, Crowe was forced to abort the rescue and barely made it back to base. He planned the operation that led to the successful rescue of American and South Vietnamese personnel trapped in Quang Tri during May, 1972. Crowe earned the Frederick L. Feinberg Award of the American Helicopter Society for his daring rescue in 1976 of seven men who were trapped on the bow section of sinking tanker Spartan Lady 145 miles south of Martha's Vineyard during an intense storm. He later commanded Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod for two tours of duty. Crowe was awarded three Distinguished Flying Crosses and nine Air Medals during his Coast Guard career.\n\nEdgar A. Culbertson\n\nBM1 Edgar A. Culbertson perished in the line of duty while trying to save three brothers who had been swept off the jetty of the Duluth Entry North Breakwater Light on the night of 30 April 1967. He was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal. Two other Coast Guardsmen who participated in the rescue attempt, FN Ron Prei and BM2 Richard Callahan, survived and were also awarded the Coast Guard Medal.\n\nJohn A. Cullen\n\nJohn A. Cullen was awarded the Legion of Merit for discovering and reporting the first landing of German saboteurs on the United States coast, 13 June 1942. His timely report alerted authorities to the presence of Nazi saboteurs on U.S. soil and was instrumental in leading to their capture of the entire 8-man sabotage team within two weeks. Ultimately Cullen’s actions resulted in the foiling of OPERATION PASTORIOUS, the code-name for the German operation, before the German operatives could carry out their mission.\n\nBenjamin B. Dailey\n\nKeeper Benjamin B. Dailey was the keeper of the Cape Hatteras Lifeboat Station in North Carolina who was awarded the Gold Lifesaving medal after rescuing 9 men from the foundering ship Ephraim Williams on 22 December 1884. In one of the most daring rescues by the Life-Saving Service since its organization, Dailey’s 7-man crew pulled for two hours through a heavy sea to reach the vessel five miles offshore. Only by relying on his expert boat-handling skills was Dailey able to bring all the survivors and his crew back to safety.\n\nCharles Walter David, Jr.\n\nStewards-Mate First Class Charles Walter David, Jr., was an African American Coast Guardsman who served on board the cutter Comanche during World War II. When the Comanche came to the aid of the survivors of the torpedoed transport Dorchester in the frigid waters off Greenland, David volunteered to dive overboard to help rescue those in need--practicing the newly devised \"rescue retriever\" technique. David repeatedly dived overboard in the water to save several men. He even saved the life of the Comanche's executive officer, LT Robert W. Anderson, when Anderson became unable to pull himself out of the water due to exposure. David died a few days later from hypothermia contracted during his heroic efforts. He was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his bravery.\n\nWarren T. Deyampert\n\nSteward's Mate Third Class Warren T. Deyampert was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. Deyampert, a crewman aboard the cutter Escanaba, took part in that cutter's rescue of the survivors of the torpedoed transport Dorchester off Greenland on 3 February 1943. He worked between three and four hours in the water during darkness, pulling rafts in close to the ship, securing them with lines from the ship, securing bowlines about the survivors so that they could be hauled aboard Escanaba, and at times keeping helpless survivors afloat until they could put lines about them. They were often in danger of being crushed by the life rafts as they brought them close to the ship's side. Deyampert stuck with a single floating survivor as he drifted astern under the counter, in order to keep him clear of the propeller, just in case it turned. He disregarded this danger to himself, in order that the survivor might be kept clear of it. Deyampert perished later that year when Escanaba exploded and sank.\n\nCharles L. Duke\n\nEnsign Charles L. Duke carried out one of the more remarkable arrests ever conducted by the Coast Guard during the enforcement of Prohibition. While on patrol in New York harbor, he single-handedly captured the freighter Greypoint and its crew of 22 in a daring and heroic act. The freighter carried over a half-million dollars worth of illegal liquor on board.\n\nDwight H. Dexter\n\nDwight Dexter served as the commander of the small boat pool at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal from the first days of the invasion until November, 1942 after being assigned to the staff of the Commander of the Transport Group, South Pacific. He also served as Douglas Munro's commanding officer. Dexter was awarded the Silver Star for his actions at Guadalcanal.\n\nLance A. Eagan\n\nLance Eagan earned his wings in 1965 first flew HH-52A helicopters along with HU-16E amphibians out of Coast Guard Air Station Brooklyn before being among the first group of Coast Guard aviators to volunteer to serve in Vietnam with the US Air Force Force's 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron flying rescue missions. He made numerous combat rescues during his tour and by the end of his Coast Guard aviation career he was awarded the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal (with 10 oak leaf clusters), a Combat Action Ribbon, two Letters of Commendation, Presidential Unit Citation, National Defense Medal (with 4 bronze stars) and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross (with palm).\n\nWalter B. Eberle\n\nFirst Assistant Keeper Walter B. Eberle, assigned to the Whale Rock Light Station in Rhode Island, remained at his post on the night of 21 September 1938 when a hurricane hit the northeast coast. Eberle was killed when the lighthouse was swept out to sea. He was a US Navy veteran, a master diver, and the father of six children. His body was never recovered.\n\nRussell Elam\n\nCook Elam Russell, of the cutter Seneca on convoy duty during the First World War, was posthumously awarded a Navy Cross \"for services in attempting to save the British merchant steamer Wellington after she had been torpedoed by a German submarine, and who lost his life when the Wellington foundered on September 17, 1918.\"\n\nFrank A. Erickson\n\nFrank A. Erickson was an aviation pioneer who led the Coast Guard's acquisition and development of rotary-wing aircraft. He was instrumental in convincing the armed services of both the U.S. and Great Britain of the helicopter's potential, particularly for search and rescue and combat operations, risking his career in openly supporting what was then an untried and unproven technology. Erickson first earned his wings in 1935 and made his first open-ocean rescue the following year while assigned to Air Station Miami. He piloted amphibian aircraft attached to three of the newly commissioned 327-foot cutters in an experiment that tested combined aircraft-cutter operations. He was then ordered to the Sikorsky Aircraft Company's plant at Bridgeport, CT, for training in the new helicopters being manufactured there, forming the first Coast Guard Helicopter Detachment. He was designated as Coast Guard Helicopter Pilot No. 1 and became an instructor. He organized and trained pilots who participated in the joint U.S. and British evaluation trials held on board the SS Daghestan in November 1943 to ascertain the feasibility of helicopter flight operations aboard ships at sea. He also trained 102 helicopter pilots and 225 mechanics, including personnel from the Army Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and the British Army, Royal Air Force and Navy. On 3 January 1944 he flew the first ever rescue flight by helicopter when he piloted a Sikorsky HNS-1, carrying two cases of blood plasma, from New York City to Sandy Hook, NJ, during a violent storm, for the treatment of Navy crewmen from the destroyer USS Turner, which had exploded and burned off New York Harbor. He developed equipment such as the power hoist, rescue slings and baskets, floats that permitted helicopters to land on water and techniques like landing and taking off from vessels at sea and hovering in all weather and wind conditions. These advances furthered the utility of the helicopter, leading to its acceptance and use around the globe. Erickson's impact on the development of the helicopter in all its uses is beyond estimation.\n\nLouis C. Etheridge, Jr.\n\nA well-known example of African American military expertise was the crew of stewards that manned a battle station on the cutter Campbell, which rammed and sank a German submarine on February 22, 1943. SD 1/c Louis C. Etheridge, Jr., captain of the Campbell's African American gun crew, was presented the Bronze Star medal (with a combat citation) on February 25, 1952, and a personal letter of congratulations from the Commandant. The gun crew earned medals for \"heroic achievement.\"\n\nRichard Etheridge\n\nCaptain Richard Etheridge became the first African-American to command a Life-Saving station when the service appointed him as the keeper of the Pea Island Life-Saving Station in North Carolina in 1880. The Revenue Cutter Service officer who recommended his appointment, First Lieutenant Charles F. Shoemaker, noted that Etheridge was \"one of the best surfmen on this part of the coast of North Carolina.\" Soon after Etheridge's appointment, the station burned down. Determined to execute his duties with expert commitment, Etheridge supervised the construction of a new station on the original site. He also developed rigorous lifesaving drills that enabled his crew to tackle all lifesaving tasks. His station earned the reputation of \"one of the tautest on the Carolina Coast,\" with its keeper well-known as one of the most courageous and ingenious lifesavers in the Service. On October 11, 1896, Etheridge's rigorous training drills proved to be invaluable. The three-masted schooner, the E.S. Newman, was caught in a terrifying storm. The vessel came ashore on the beach two miles south of the Pea Island station. The storm was so severe that Etheridge had suspended normal beach patrols that day. But the alert eyes of surfman Theodore Meekins saw the first distress flare and he immediately notified Etheridge. Etheridge gathered his crew and launched the surfboat. Battling the strong tide and sweeping currents, the dedicated lifesavers struggled to make their way to a point opposite the schooner, only to find there was no dry land. The daring, quick-witted Etheridge tied two of his strongest surfmen together and connected them to shore by a long line. They fought their way through the roaring breakers and finally reached the schooner. The seemingly inexhaustible Pea Island crewmembers journeyed through the perilous waters ten times and rescued the entire crew of the E.S. Newman. For this rescue the crew, including Etheridge, were recently awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal by the Coast Guard.\n\nRay Evans\n\nPetty Officer (later Commander) Raymond J. Evans was awarded a Navy Cross for his actions at the Matanikau River, Guadalcanal on 27 September 1942. Along with his friend and shipmate Douglas Munro, Evans participated in the rescue and evacuation of elements of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, who were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lewis B. \"Chesty\" Puller, from behind enemy lines while under fire.\n\nManuel Ferreira\n\nManuel Ferreria served as a lighthouse keeper for seven different lighthouses during his career, which spanned from 1908 through 1946. He was known as \"one of the grand old men of Hawaiian lighthouse lore.\" In 1919 he rescued the crew of a Japanese fishing trawler when that vessel ran aground off Barber's Point, Hawaii, where he served as a keeper. He was instrumental in saving the schooner Bianca and its crew in 1923 when the ship lost its sails and was in danger of smashing on a reef. Ferreira was unable to launch the lighthouse skiff due to the high surf conditions. Instead, he ran three miles to the nearest telephone and called for assistance. The USS Sunadin was dispatched and reached the wallowing schooner just in time to tow it to safety.\n\nFlorence Ebersole Smith Finch\n\nFlorence Finch enlisted in the Coast Guard Women's Reserve (SPARs) during World War II after first escaping imprisonment by the Japanese. She was captured in the Philippines in October, 1944 after serving with the Filipino resistance and assisting U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war. She was liberated by Allied forces during the invasion of the Philippines and after returning to the U.S., she joined the SPARs. She was the first woman to receive the Pacific Theatre Campaign ribbon. She was also presented with the U.S. Medal of Freedom.\n\nJoel Hilton Fisher\n\nLCDR Joel Fisher was attached to the G-5 Intelligence Division of the U.S. Army during World War II. He joined the Coast Guard after being turned down from enlisting in the Army due to poor eyesight. He was commissioned ensign in 1942. After carrying out assignments in Alaska he was assigned to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). There he was assigned as Chief, Foreign Exchange and Property Control Section, Financial Branch of G-5 SHAEF. He commanded a 75-man task force assigned to locate and recover stolen valuables taken by German forces during the war, including millions of dollars worth of art, gold, silver and gemstones. They travelled with front-line combat units as Allied armies advanced on Germany.\n\nWilliam Ray Flores\n\nSA William Ray \"Billy\" Flores died in the line of duty while saving the lives of many of his shipmates when his cutter, the Blackthorn, collided with the tanker Capricorn, on January 28, 1980. The Blackthorn and the tanker Capricorn collided near the entrance to Tampa Bay, Florida. The Blackthorn capsized before all the cutter’s crew could abandon ship. Twenty-seven of Flores’ shipmates did escape the sinking ship. After the ships collided Flores and another crewmember threw lifejackets to their shipmates who had jumped into the water. Later, when his companion abandoned ship as the Blackthorn began to submerge, Flores -- who was less than a year out of boot camp--remained behind and used his own belt to strap open the lifejacket locker door, allowing additional lifejackets to float to the surface. Even after most crewmembers abandoned ship, the 19-year-old Flores remained aboard to assist trapped shipmates and to comfort those who were injured and disoriented. He was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal.\n\nGene R. Gislason\n\nLieutenant Gene R. Gislason was awarded the Silver Star: \"For outstanding heroism as Commanding Officer of the USS LCI(L)-94, while landing assault troops in Normandy June 6, 1944. He successfully directed his ship through numerous beach obstacles to the proper beach, discharged his troops and retracted while his ship was seriously damaged from heavy enemy fire. Ship's communications, engine telegraph and electric steering were disabled by direct hits on the pilothouse which killed three crewmen, and one screw and shaft were rendered inoperative by beach obstacles. By his coolness under fire and excellent seamanship, Lieutenant Gislason overcame these difficulties and brought his ship off the beach on hand steering and one screw. He later supervised repairs and in four hours enabled the LCI(L) to remain operative in the assault area for three weeks.\"\n\nWillis J. Goff\n\nGunner's Mate First Class Willis Jerry Goff, a crewman on board the cutter Point Banks on patrol in Vietnam, was awarded the Silver Star for \"his heroic courage and gallantry in action while engaged in armed conflict against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong aggressors in the Republic of Vietnam on Jan. 22, 1969.\" He and fellow Point Banks crewman EN2 Larry D. Villarreal volunteered to man the cutter's launch to rescue a group of nine South Vietnamese soldiers who were trapped along a beach by two Viet Cong platoons. Under continuous enemy fire, they made two landings on the beach to rescue successfully all of the South Vietnamese soldiers. His citation read, in part: \". . .with courageous disregard for their own safety, Petty Officer Goff and his fellow crewmember were able to rescue nine South Vietnamese Army personnel who would have met almost certain death or capture without the assistance of the two Coast Guardsmen. Petty Officer Goff's outstanding heroism, professionalism, and devotion to duty and to his fellow man were in the highest traditions of the United States Naval Services.\"\n\nCharles C. Goodwin\n\nKeeper Charles C. Goodwin of the Cleveland, Ohio Lifeboat station was awarded the Gold Lifesaving medal after he rescued 29 people from 3 ships on the nights of 31 October, 1 November, and 11 November 1884, each time during a horrific gale.\n\nStewart Ross Graham\n\nCommander Stewart Graham, USCG, was an aviation pioneer and trailblazer. He, along with Captain Frank Erickson, were instrumental in developing the helicopter as a search and rescue platform. Additionally, Graham carries the distinction of having made a number of helicopter \"firsts\": he became the first helicopter pilot to take off and land on a ship at sea; the first to perform a nighttime medevac by helicopter; the first to make a transcontinental helicopter flight; and the first to use a helicopter hoist to rescue survivors from a foundering ship. He was also instrumental in developing equipment such as the power hoist, and rescue slings and baskets that permitted helicopters to conduct rescues. He developed techniques utilizing that equipment in all weather and wind conditions, thereby making the helicopter the premiere SAR aircraft that it is today. Graham's impact on the development of the helicopter in all its uses is beyond estimation.\n\nFrank W. Griswold\n\nOn 9 March 1928 a pulling surfboat with nine men aboard, under the command of Boatswain's Mate First Class William Cashman, got underway from the Manomet Life-Saving to go to the rescue of the steamer Robert E. Lee. The Lee had grounded on Mary Ann Rocks in a heavy gale. While returning to the station the surfboat capsized due to extremely heavy seas, spilling all nine men into the water. Six were rescued but \"Captain\" Cashman, Surfman Frank W. Griswold, and Surfman Edward R. Stark perished in the line of duty in the freezing water. During the on-going search and rescue operations all 236 passengers and crew from the Robert E. Lee were saved.\n\nWilliam Ham\n\nWilliam Ham was a very aggressive cutter captain during the War of 1812. As commander of the Norfolk-based cutter Jefferson, he took by force the British schooner Patriot on June 25, 1812. This event took place just a week after the proclamation of war and was the first American maritime capture of the conflict. On April 12, 1813, four Royal Navy barges captured the American schooner Flight. With volunteer militia on board Jefferson, Ham ran down three of the barges, capturing over sixty British officers and enlisted men and freeing the captain and crew of the American merchantman. Together with the cutter Gallatin, the Jefferson also participated in the wartime seizure of the British merchant vessels General Blake, Active and Georgiana.\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nSecretary of the Treasury and Continental Army veteran Alexander Hamilton's first task when he joined President George Washington's cabinet was to put the finances of the young American republic in order. Hamilton realized that tariffs on imported goods were the primary means of generating revenue and that smugglers were inhibiting the collection of these funds. As such, he proposed the construction of 10 cutters to safeguard revenue by combating smuggling. On 4 August 1790 Congress authorized the construction of these vessels and for his foresight Hamilton is regarded as the \"Father of the Coast Guard.\"\n\nWinfield J. Hammond\n\nChief Aviation Electronicsman Winfield J. Hammond was posthumously awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for heroic daring during a sea rescue on 18 January 1953. Hammond was a crewman on board a Coast Guard PBM that crashed offshore of mainland China while conducting a rescue of the crew of a Navy reconnaissance aircraft that had been shot down. He was killed in the crash.\n\nMarcus A. Hanna\n\nMarcus A. Hanna was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while serving in the Union Army during the Civil War. On 4 July 1863 at Port Hudson, Louisiana, Hanna \"voluntarily exposed himself to heavy enemy fire\" to get water for his comrades. After the war Hanna served as the principal keeper of the Cape Elizabeth Light Station, located near Portland, Maine. On 28 January 1885 he rescued two men from the wrecked schooner Australia and for this action was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal. As such, Hanna is the only individual to have been awarded both the Medal of Honor and the Gold Lifesaving Medal.\n\nGlen Livingston Harris\n\nSurfman Glen Livingston Harris was awarded a Silver Star by Admiral Chester Nimitz for his combat actions during the invasion of Guadalcanal. He participated in the first wave landings at Tulagi Island. His citation reads: \"For distinguishing himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity in action during the landings on Tulagi Island, whose boat with seven others, constituted the first assault wave. He landed his embarked troops and then made repeated trips during that day and the following two days, in spite of heavy enemy fire, to effect the landing of equipment, ammunition and supplies, and on September 8 he made a landing against a Japanese force at Taivu Point, Guadalcanal Island; thereby materially contributing to the successful operations in which the enemy were defeated. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\" Vice Admiral Russell R. Waesche, Commandant of the Coast Guard, also promoted him to Machinist's Mate, Second Class.\n\nFrederick T. Hatch\n\nSurfman Frederick Hatch was a two-time winner of the Gold Lifesaving Medal. He earned his first award while serving in the Life-Saving Service and the second while serving as a keeper in the Lighthouse Service.\n\nMike Healy\n\nMichael A. \"Hell-Roaring Mike\" Healy, the son of a slave, served a distinguished career as the Captain of the United States’ most famous cutter, USRC Bear he saved hundreds of men. In 1890 he initiated the successful program which transferred herds of reindeer from Siberia to Alaska in order to help feed the native Alaskan population. In addition to this humanitarian effort, Healy was the service’s foremost Arctic navigator and he maintained American laws in Alaska in the absence of established courts.\n\nHenry G. Hemingway\n\nCaptain Henry Hemingway had a distinguished career, primarily at sea. He saw service as a line officer aboard the famous cutter Rush on the Bering Sea Patrol and McCulloch as well as the Morrill during the Mont Blanc disaster in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He served as the gunnery officer aboard the USS San Diego during World War I and survived the torpedoing of that warship by the U-156. He commanded the cutter Snohomish in 1923 during a search-and-rescue case off Port Angeles that defied belief and earned him the Gold Lifesaving Medal for his actions in saving the entire crew of the SS Nika during a gale.\n\nCoit T. Hendley\n\nLieutenant, junior grade Coit Hendley was awarded the Silver Star: \"For heroism as Commanding Officer of the USS LCI(L)-85 while landing assault troops in Normandy, France, June 6, 1944. Lieutenant Hendley successfully landed his troops despite the mining of his vessel, fire in three compartments and a concentration of enemy fire while unloading. His courage and seamanship in directing repairs and retracting from the beach resulted in saving the lives of many wounded aboard.\"\n\nHeriberto Hernandez\n\nFireman Heriberto Hernandez was killed in action while carrying out a reconnaissance mission on the Rach Nang River in South Vietnam while in a small boat from his cutter, CGC Point Cypress. Two other Coast Guardsmen with him were wounded but survived. For his bravery as he faced the enemy, Hernandez was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart Medal and the Bronze Star Medal with the Combat “V” device. \"'Skill, courage under enemy fire, and devotion to duty:' Bronze Star Medal Recipient Heriberto \"Eddie\" Hernandez and Coast Guard Smallboat Operations in Vietnam” by Dr. William Thiesen, The Quarterdeck Log, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Summer 2013).\n\nMaster Benjamin Hiller\n\nAs master of the cutter Pickering, Benjamin Hiller established quite a reputation as a combat captain in the Quasi-War with France. Pickering’s battle with the French privateer l’Egypte Conquise serves as a testament to Hiller’s bravery in the face of tremendous odds. In early October 1799, the French sent the most powerful privateer in the West Indies on a mission to capture Pickering. With between fourteen and eighteen nine-and six-pound cannon, and double-manned with between 175 and 250 men, the privateer out-gunned and out-manned Pickering’s defenses of fourteen four-pounders and a crew of less than one hundred. Termed by witnesses as “severe,” the nine-hour duel occurred around October 8th, 1799. It continued for five hours, ceased for an hour and re-commenced for three additional hours after which the privateer struck its colors and surrendered.\n\nHiller compiled an impressive record as master of the Pickering. Between early 1799 and the summer of 1800, his cutter captured over fifteen vessels. These included a French merchant vessel valued at $100,000 (in 1799 dollars) and at least ten prize vessels the French had captured. This figure also included five French privateers, a number of which rivaled Pickering’s fighting strength. Pickering disappeared with all hands in a violent storm in September 1800, in which the frigate USS Insurgente was also lost with all hands.\n\nJames A. Hirshfield\n\nVice-Admiral James Hirshfield had a remarkable career in the Coast Guard. He is perhaps best remembered for his actions during a convoy battle on the North Atlantic during the Second World War while he commanded the cutter Campbell. The Campbell engaged six U-boats and sank a seventh all in the period of two days. Hirshfield earned the Navy Cross for his actions, one of only six such awards given to Coast Guardsmen during that conflict.\n\nCalvin Hooper\n\nCalvin Hooper was a long-time captain in the Bering Sea and was the first commanding officer of the Bering Sea Patrol. He served as the commanding officer of the revenue cutter Corwin when that cutter became the first to cruise systematically in the Arctic Ocean in 1880.\n\nTerrell Horne III\n\nOn 2 December 2012 Chief Boatswain's Mate Terrell Horne, III, the Executive Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Cutter Halibut, was killed in the line of duty while conducting maritime law enforcement operations off the coast of California. He sustained fatal injuries when the small boat he was on was rammed by a vessel being operated by drug smuggling criminals. One of Horne’s final actions was to push a fellow crewmember out of the way before the smuggling vessel collided with the Coast Guard small boat, thereby giving his life to save his shipmates. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Senior Chief Petty Officer and awarded the Coast Guard Medal.\n\nDonald R. Horsley\n\nMaster Chief Boatswains Mate Donald Robert Horsley served the Coast Guard though 44 years of continuous service from age 17 to 62, enlisting on 4 August 1942. He served on active duty for 44 years, four months, and 27 days. His career spanned three wars, and saw service on board 34 vessels. During the Vietnam War, BMCM Horsley served 41 months as the senior enlisted person assigned to Division 13, Coast Guard Squadron One out of Cat Lo, Republic of Vietnam. This Division of 82-foot patrol boats was tasked with the maritime interdiction of the reinforcement and re-supply of Communist forces fighting in South Vietnam. During this assignment, BMCM Horsley was awarded the Bronze Star with a Combat \"V\". After Vietnam, Horsley served throughout the Pacific, including assignments on board the seagoing tender Basswood and as the Officer-in-Charge of the Coast Guard Buoy Depot on Guam. In 1976, he was assigned as the Officer-in- Charge on board the river tender Wyaconda, out of Dubuque, Iowa. He returned to sea on board the cutter Sherman and was transferred to Morgenthau when Sherman was decommissioned in early 1986. At his retirement ceremony in January 1987, Horsley was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nGeorge F. Hutchinson\n\nLieutenant, junior grade George F. Hutchinson was awarded the Silver Star: \"For gallantry in action against the enemy as Commanding Officer of the USS LCI(L)-83 while landing assault troops in Normandy, France, June 6, 1944. Lieutenant Hutchinson directed his ship to the beach through heavily mined obstacle while under heavy enemy fire that caused numerous Army casualties, successfully unloaded troops after the ship was mined and remained with the ship effecting repairs that enabled it to come off the beach on the next tide.\"\n\nMiles H. Imlay\n\nCaptain Miles H. Imlay commanded a flotilla of Coast Guard landing vessels in all major amphibious invasions in the European Theater of operations during the Second World War, including the invasion of occupied France at Normandy. He was the second in command of one of the three invasion groups that landed at Omaha Beach on the morning of June 6, 1944 and sailed off the beaches during the day directing incoming landing craft to their correct landing places, continually under enemy fire. He later assumed command of that force after the assault group commander returned to England. He was instrumental in restoring operations off Normandy after the storms of late June wrecked the artificial harbors created off the invasion beaches. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on D-Day and also earned the Legion of Merit for his actions at the invasion of Sicily and a gold star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit for his role during the invasion of Salerno, Italy.\n\nJoshua James\n\nCaptain Joshua James served for his entire adult life as a life-saver. Beginning with the Massachusetts Humane Society at age 15, he ended his career in the Life-Saving Service at age 74 when he died while still serving at his Point Allerton Life-Saving station. During that career he earned almost every medal available for bravery and the Life-Saving Service Superintendent, Sumner Kimball, wrote \"Captain Joshua James was probably the most celebrated life-saver in the world.\"\n\nDavid H. Jarvis\n\nDavid Henry Jarvis was appointed to the Revenue Cutter Service in 1881, and served until his retirement as a captain in 1905. He spent the majority of his career in Alaska and the Bering Sea. His most famous adventure came during an expedition to save the men of a whaling fleet that had become trapped in the ice off Point Barrow, Alaska, during the winter of 1897-1898. Jarvis, then a first-lieutenant, led a three-man rescue team consisting of Second-Lieutenant Ellsworth P. Bertholf and Doctor J.S. Call of the U. S. Public Health Service, with a herd of about 400 reindeer across 1,500 miles of tundra and pack-ice to Point Barrow. They arrived after a journey of 99 days and thereby saved over 300 men from starvation. They had completed the longest rescue mission ever undertaken in Coast Guard history. On 28 June 1902, Congress, in response to a request from President William McKinley to recognize officially what he called a \"victory of peace,\" awarded Gold Medals of Honor to Jarvis and the other two members of what became known as the Overland Relief Expedition.\n\nMaurice Jester\n\nLieutenant Commander Maurice Jester was the commanding officer of the cutter Icarus that attacked and sank the more heavily armed U-352 off the coast of North Carolina during the Second World War. The Navy awarded Jester the Navy Cross for his actions in sinking the Nazi submarine, the second U-boat sunk by U.S. forces during the war.\n\nClifford Johnson\n\nPetty Officer Clifford Johnson was on liberty at the Coconut Grove Lounge in Boston on the night of 28 November 1942 when the lounge caught fire. Over 490 persons perished in what was one of the worst fires in the nation's history. Petty Officer Johnson repeatedly risked his life by entering the fire on four occasions to pull victims from the flames, receiving severe burns over his body. He spent over two years in the hospital recovering from his injuries.\n\nJerome G. Kiah\n\nKeeper Jerome G. Kiah, keeper of the Point Aux Barques, Michigan, Lifeboat Station, was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for his gallant attempt to rescue people on board the scow J.H. Magruder in 1880. His boat capsized and he was the only survivor. He later became a district superintendent.\n\nSumner I. Kimball\n\nSumner Increase Kimball was the man most responsible for organizing the U.S. Life-Saving Service, established in 1878. He served as its head for its entire existence through its merger with the Revenue Cutter Service in 1915. He also served as the civilian head of the Revenue Marine Bureau within the Department of the Treasury, and so was intimately connected to both the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life-Saving Service, the fore-bears of the present day Coast Guard. In 1877 he established a School of Instruction whereby the service selected and trained its own officer replacements, the fore-runner of the Coast Guard Academy.\n\nMichael Kirkpatrick\n\nLieutenant (j.g.)
