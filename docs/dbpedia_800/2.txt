CLAIRE VOYANT

LOVE IS BLIND

ALBUM METROPOLIS, ACCESSION RELEASE: OCTOBER 15, 2002 REVIEW: NOVEMBER 21, 2002

Claire Voyant is a relatively new experience for me. Before this album, I had only heard the remixes on "Time Again", where artists like Front 242, VNV Nation and Assemblage 23 successfully reworked their songs. Now it's time for me to hear their own sound, and indeed they have quite a distinct style.

This trio consists of Chris Ross, Ben Fargen and Victoria Lloyd, and they make mostly soft music with lush electronics and almost U2-like guitars. Victoria has a very flexible and emotional voice, and gives the band much of its flavour.

It took me some listens to get into the album, as some tracks seemed a little uneventful and pointless. Most songs have grown on me now, even though some still doesn't do anything for me. My favourite tune is the powerful "Silence", with a massive chorus soaring upwards with every chord change. Listen to it loud. I want to turn the volume up now but I can't since my neighbours will probably not agree with my wish. Then again, I think more people should hear this album.

I really don't know what to compare this album with, but perhaps the new material from Delerium is a pointer, or perhaps Conjure One. Bah, don't compare it, just listen to it and enjoy it. By now you're wondering "why the low score then?". Well, that comes from the above mentioned filler tracks. But don't let that keep you from getting this album.
