Blurb: A look into Claire Voyant’s past that shows the band’s youth was anything but awkward.

Originally released in 1995, Claire Voyant’s debut album has been re-released by Metropolis Records, offering a look back at the early days of this excellent ethereal trio. When held up alongside Claire Voyant’s 2009 album Lustre, this self-titled debut understandably pales in comparison, but it offers an interesting opportunity to see how the band has grown through the years while still maintaining their overall original vision and style.

The smooth and intoxicating darkwave rhythms lay out a wonderful web for Victoria Lloyd’s engaging and haunting voice to dance upon and ensnare the listener. Tracks like “Her” and “Deep” best show off Lloyd’s voice as it melds with the subtle guitar and synth work. Unfortunately, it also becomes apparent in this early work that there is a bit too much reliance on Lloyd’s voice. Much of the album, though still unquestionably lovely and relaxing, suffers from some overly subdued composition with the majority of the hooks to be found originating from Lloyd’s voice. This leads to several of the later tracks blending together a bit too much and failing to really generate a unique identity. That being said, it does show an aspect that Claire Voyant has improved on over the years with musical arrangements that now rival Lloyd’s voice in beauty.

This is actually the fourth time this album has been released, and it’s easy to understand why; Claire Voyant’s debut does not even remotely show its age and could quite easily be mistaken for a new release. Though it does suffer from tracks that bleed together a tad too much and an overreliance on vocal hooks, it is still a lovely, otherworldly album that offers an opportunity for fans to appreciate the bands recent work even more.
