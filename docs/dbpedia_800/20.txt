Claire Voyant, originally just simply Sorceress, is a minor character in the Power Master series, first appearing in Power Master 1: A Strange Journey.

Biography

Claire is a woman born on May 26, 1910 somewhere in the Land of Telbed[1], being 98 years old during the events of Power Master 1: A Strange Journey and Power Master: A Strange Journey MV. True to her name, she is a sorceress capable of magical powers. So far, she is seen to be capable of transformation, strength boosting, and foresight. When she calls upon her powers of foresight in Power Master: A Strange Journey MV, the ground rumbles as Claire has to call up an immense amount of power.

Power Master 1: A Strange Journey

In Power Master 1: A Strange Journey, the Sorceress can only be found if the player accepts Brianna's quest in the Town of Iora. To find her, the player must exit the Land of Moneo through the passage just above the Town of Eora and continue until they reach her hut.

The Sorceress used to be Brianna's master until Brianna rebelled against her. According to Brianna, the sorceress is evil, often using her powers for her own benefits and without the consent of others[2]. However, the Sorceress claims that Brianna is the bad one and that Brianna is deceiving the player. Apparently, Brianna tried to turn the Sorceress into something and take the Sorceress's magic for herself[3].

In order for the Sorceress to use magic, she talks backwards, an example being "KCAB MROFSNART!" a.k.a., "TRANSFORM BACK!". This is similar to the Zatanna and Zatara characters from the DC Universe.

Please do not add false or speculative information to the section and please site your sources.

Additionally, once the game is released, this section may need reorganizing.

In Power Master: A Strange Journey MV, Claire can be found in the Town of Tora, in the house to the southwest of town. When spoken to from across the counter, Clair will give updates on the number of quests the player has to complete and hints for Treasure Chambers. If all of the quests have been cleared, Clair gives the player Magic Armor. If all the Treasure Chambers have been found, Clair gives the player a Heal-All Mega Life Vial.

While Brianna has yet to appear in the game, she was adjusted to be Claire's daughter, though no spouse is listed in Claire's album.
