        "text": "Songs that fit the vibes of the Avengers in Age of Ultron\n\nBruce Banner (The Hulk)- Lover/loner by nightly ~The lyrics in this song is definitely why I chose it. I mean talking about the ‘other guy’ and being lonely, it literally screams dr. Banner~\n\nTony Stark (Ironman)- Up town funk by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars ~I love this song comes in my head every time I see Tony being sarcastic with Pepper or working on one of his projects~\n\nClint Barton (Hawkeye)- Home by Micheal Bublé ~I keep thinking that this is what Clint says to himself everytime and just like the song he longs to go home to his wife and kids~\n\nWanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch)- Stand in the rain by Superchick ~I love the beat and tone of this vibe and the lyrics definitely Wanda. I feel like nobody actually acknowledges how much pain she’s actually been through ~\n\nSteve Rogers (Captain America)- See You Again by Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth ~this one is obviously about Steve and Bucky and their lost friendship ~\n\nNatasha Romanoff (Black Widow)- Castle by Halsey ~I just discovered this song recently and wow Black Widow vibes. It’s so powerful and dark and mysterious, the tone is definitely so Natasha ~\n\nSam Wilson (The Falcon)- Louisiana Hero by Henry Jackman ~I think it’s pretty obvious why I chose this song ;)~\n\nThor Odinson (Thor)- Thunderstruck AC/DC ~ Okay to be honest I didn’t have to think about this for too long ~"
