        "text": "The new LP comes with instructions on how to listen to it.\n\nNot even ten days have gone by since Jeff Mills released ‘Think Again’, his first record of the year and the veteran DJ and producer is already dropping his second one. This time, under the title ‘The Clairvoyant’, he is releasing a triple LP on his own Axis Records.\n\nComprised of 15 tracks, the album comes with precise instructions on how to be listened to, and that the artist himself has shared in the following text:\n\n‘A clairvoyant is a person who claims to have a supernatural ability to perceive events in the future or beyond normal sensory contact. The album is played in the manner of a metaphysical séance and should be listened to in a dark, candle-lit room. A quiet space, free from outside noise, chatter or conversation, and other visual distractions. The album should be heard in its entirety, cover to cover.’\n\nJeff Mills’ ‘The Clairvoyant’ will be out February 26th via Axis Records. Listen to some snippets and check out the tracklist & artwork below.\n\nTracklist:"
