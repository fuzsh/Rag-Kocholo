I believe / You live fear won't change a word for destiny / But you rain, you reign over my heart and everything /  / All that I have ever known / Are the pieces of blue in the shadows / It's like I think I was immune to the pieces of me / In the sun and in the shadow /  / Tonight the wounded heart's deafening / You live here / Won't change a word... / So just believe /  /",
