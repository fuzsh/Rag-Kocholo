        "text": "At long last, ‘Aitu’ from Suzanne’s band, Melodyguild, is available on Bandcamp for your streaming and downloading pleasure. Check it out on the Projekt Bandcamp page.\n\nAITU by Melodyguild\n\nA DJ in Los Angeles recently mentioned to me how much he loves this EP from Suzanne Perry – vocalist from Love Spirals Downwards. Hard to believe it’s been 12+ years since I released it on Projekt, but there ya go! Time…. time keeps on rushing bye.\n\nReleased in 2008 — the only post-FLUX release with her vocals on multiple tracks — AITU is a lovely shoegazer portent of a band that was never to be…\n\nSam of Projekt\n\nThe CD of this maxi-single released by Projekt is out of print.\n\nOnce again, Love Spirals Downwards’ vocalist, Suzanne Perry, and Lovespirals vocalist, Anji Bee, have collaborated with John Zorko of Falling You. ‘Shine’ is the first of his albums to be released by Projekt, who are offering a limited edition CD as well as a digital release.\n\nShine by Falling You\n\nSuzanne Perry discuses “Until the Stars Align,” her contribution to Shine. “Creatively, the ingenues that live in John and I connect. Getting a song from him is always surprising as he manages to weave an unexpected intergalactic sounding sound. Sometimes I don’t know what to do with these sounds to be honest, but I’ve grown fond of them and have come to know them as Zorkoesque. What did I think of when creating this song? As it has always been for me, it’s not been about thinking or connecting the sounds to the world as it is in these fleeting moments. But I recall thinking about the night sky. The lyrics for ‘Until the Stars Align’ were written mostly by Cris Miller.”\n\nProjekt.com\n\nCris Miller, as you may recall, collaborated with Suzanne first in 2004 on a cover of “Sally’s Song” for the Projekt Holiday Single 2 maxi-CD under the name Melodyguild. Also known as Silver Screen, Miller contributed vocals as well as lyrics to the Falling You cut, making him perhaps the first male vocalist featured by John Zorko.\n\nClub Violane, “LA’s only shoegazer & dream pop party,” recently returned after a 2 year hiatus to celebrate a visit from one of its beloved founders, DJ Wednesday. Everyone came out including Suzanne, as well as Drew Pluta (formerly of Arcanta) and Rodney Rodriguez (formerly of The Von Trapps), both of whom performed with LSD at our last concert. We also met up with Tom of Mira, whom I don’t think I’ve seen since Lovespirals toured with them in 2002.\n\nThere’s a cool video about Club Violaine reopening on YouTube:\n\nIt has been a dozen years since Love Spirals Downwards founder, Ryan Lum, recorded his ambient drum & bass rendition of the classic Christmas song, “The Little Drummer Boy,” and at long last, it is finally available for sale! Originally conceived and recorded in 1999 for the Projekt Records holiday music series, Excelsis, this recording has never been properly released. This was the last song that Suzanne Perry contributed vocals to, and it’s sound is very reminiscent of the band’s final album, ‘Flux.’ Like the 1999 Lovespirals song, “Beatitude,” it features jazzy Rhodes piano by guest musician, Gabriel D. Vine, of Monkey Bars.\n\nOver the past decade, 2 versions of this cover song have been floating around the internet under different titles; there’s the polished aforementioned vocal version as well as an earlier demo mix which features vinyl vocal samples from a classic old-school Christmas record. This demo mix is stripped down, with more emphasis on Ryan’s funky live bassline, and less use of synth pads. Both versions are quite catchy and a fun addition to anyone’s holiday music library. Pick up the 2 track single for just $2 in the high quality digital audio format of your choice from the newly launched Lovespirals Bandcamp Store.\n\nLittle Drummer Boy (Single) by Love Spirals Downwards\n\nSpecial Thanks to our friend, Susan Jennings, for her 1998 band photograph used as the cover art!\n\nThe 2-time NAR Lifestyle Music Award winning musical project, Falling You, just released a new album entitled, Adore, on Magnatune. Enigmatic band founder and producer, John Michael Zorko, has long worked with a revolving cast of talented and varied female vocalists including Lovespirals Downwards own Suzanne Perry, Victoria Lloyd (of Claire Voyant and Mono Chrome), Dru Allen (of Mirabilis and This Ascension), Erica Mulkey (AKA Unwoman), and Shikhee (of Android Lust) — just to name a few.\n\nIn her first appearance with Falling You, Lovespirals’ vocalist, Anji Bee, contributes lyrics and vocals to the ambient opening track, “Blessed,” penned about her relationship with bandmate, Ryan Lum, who engineered and recorded her vocal tracks.\n\nSuzanne contributed lyrics and vocals to the album’s second track, “Champagne.” With its summery dream pop feel, this collaboration brings to mind her work with Melodyguild. Suzanne had previously been featured on Falling You’s 2006 album, Human, and 2008 album, Faith.\n\nLong time friend of Love Spirals Downwards, Lovespirals, Anji Bee, and Falling You, Ken Lee (of Eleven Shadows), mixed and mastered the songs of Adore alongside John at his Blueberry Buddha Recording Studios.\n\nAdore by Falling You Continue reading New Falling You Album Featuring Suzanne and Anji Out Now →\n\nDo you remember when the X-Files had that episode with the Chupacabra? Well, it made a big impact on Love Spirals Downwards back in the day. Suzanne commented on its spooky power in this infamous story told live on-stage at the Projekt Festival on 8/1/1997, held at The Vic Theatre in Chicago, IL. Classic Suz stage banter!\n\nRead Ryan’s original post about ProjektFest 1997 mentioning the rowdy crowd issue. There’s some great performance photographs, as well.\n\nLove Spirals Downwards’ vocalist, Suzanne Perry, has contributed to two songs on the new Falling You album, Faith. You might be able to guess from the titles alone which tracks she penned, but as the featured artists are not listed, hers are “The End Before the Winds” and “And the Rain Comes in Waves.”\n\nCheck it out now on Magnatune.\n\nFeaturing incredible performances by Suzanne Perry (Love Spirals Downwards), Amanda Kramer (The Golden Palominos), Shikhee (Android Lust) and other Falling You favorites, ‘faith’ continues in the dark ambient / heavenly voices / ethereal style of ‘human’ and ‘touch’, while adding subtle industrial elements. Exploring what we humans do when life’s experiences shake the foundations of whatever beliefs we hold, ‘faith’ asks the question, ‘What do we do when everything crumbles around us?’\n\nMagnatune\n\nFaith by Falling You\n\nNow Faith by Falling You is also on Bandcamp.\n\nLove Spirals Downwards’ singer, Suzanne Perry, appears on one song of the latest Falling You album, Human. “An Angel Ameliorate” is very ambient and sad with Suzy’s classic glossolalia style lyrics. To the best of my knowledge, this is her first released work since Melodyguild’s cover of “Sally’s Song” on the Projekt Holiday Single 2. You can check out the track for free from Magnatune here.\n\nUPDATE: this won Best Vocal Album of 2006 from New Age Reporter. Congrats!\n\nHuman by Falling You\n\nThe album is now available on Bandcamp!"
