        "text": "(Mystic Comics#4/6) - During a séance to summon the spirit of the recently deceased Mr. Wagler, Satan took possession of the medium, Madam Claire Voyant. Angry and unhappy with the results, the Wagler family decided to leave. Under the influence of Satan, Claire Voyant placed the curse of Satan on the departing family. Later and unknown to her, Satan caused the Wagler family�s car to veer out of control and crash into an embankment, killing Mrs. Wagler, and her daughter, Patricia. The only survivor of the crash was James Wagler who became influenced by Satan to seek revenge on Claire Voyant who had cursed them. With a gun in hand, James Wagler made his way to Claire Voyant's home and confronted her. After accusing her of being responsible for the death of his mother and sister, he shot her in cold blood. As Claire Voyant lay dying, she vowed to come back and James Wagler then quickly departed.\n\nHer body and soul now in Hell, she was brought back to life by Satan who performed a mystic ritual that turned Claire Voyant into his new servant to expedite and courier the souls of evil men on Earth back to his realm. Satan sent her back to Earth to seek revenge on her murderer and she found James Wagler alone on a dock. The Black Widow placed her hand to his forehead and with a flash of fire and brimstone, James Wagler died with a black widow brand burnt into the spot where he was touched.\n\n(Mystic Comics I#5/4) - \"Satan\" next sent the Black Widow to fetch the soul of Garvey Lang, a mobster who had hijacked a train and stole $250,000. Using her ability to become invisible, she showed up at the mobster’s hideout and mentally influenced one of his men to turn on Garvey Lang. Garvey Lang shot his former henchman dead. She next influenced Garvey Lang into killing another of his men by placing a mental suggestion that he was being cheated out of the money he had just stolen. The next evening, during a masquerade party hosted by Garvey Lang, the Black Widow made her appearance. Captivated by her beauty, Garvey Lang decided to leave with her to a more private location to further his advances. Much to his surprise, Garvey Lang was quickly killed by her death touch, consigning his soul to \"Satan\".\n\n(Mystic Comics I#7/3) - \"Satan\", unwilling to wait for the souls of weapons manufacturers Lewis and Sykes, sent Black Widow to obtain them. The matter was expedited when it became clear they were selling munitions to both the Axis powers and Allied forces. The Black Widow appeared in their office disguised and approached them for a secretarial job. Alone with the two men, she revealed herself as the Black Widow and killed Lewis with her touch of death. Sykes quickly tried to make his escape and used a gun to shoot her. The gun proved useless and he then tried to douse her with chemicals that forced her to temporarily halt her advance. Getting up off the floor, she used her cape to detain Sykes. A single touch was sufficient to send the evil one to Hades as well.\n\n(USA Comics I#5/2) - The Black Widow was once again sent to fetch the soul of an evil hitman named Karl Koodamore who profited from the murder of others. After he succeeded in killing the actor called John Marriman while performing onstage, the Black Widow appeared and killed one of his henchmen who had just committed the murderous deed. Karl Koodamore then ordered his other henchmen to shoot her down but this proved ineffectual and she chased him to a nearby office. He made his escape by car and ordered another of his men to stay behind to deal with her. Unable to stop the Black Widow with bullets, the frightened man turned the gun on himself and committed suicide. Later while out on a country road, the Black Widow appeared in front of Karl Koodamore’s speeding car. He tried to run her over but somehow miscalculated and crashed to his doom over a cliff into a swiftly flowing river below. Her task complete, the Black Widow returned to Hades to await her next mission.\n\n(All Select Comics I#1/5) - Satan next sent her to acquire the soul of Ogor, an evil faith healer and charlatan who had become rich by taking money from others who believed he could help them using his fake powers. As Ogor was leaving town, the Black Widow once again tried to dispense her form of justice but Ogor instantly died from heart failure. Before returning to Hell, the Black Widow (acting out of pity or kindness) mystically regenerated the amputated leg of a boy called Pepito who was one of Ogor's final victims he had promised to heal.\n\n(Marvel Knights: Spider-Man#9 (fb)) - The Black Widow was shown to have been active during the 1940s alongside other heroes from the Golden Age.\n\n(Marvels#1) - During WWII, the Black Widow took part in an assault on a Nazi fortress, flying in alongside various other costumed heroes.\n\n(The Twelve: Spearhead#1 (fb)) - Black Widow worked with the Allied military forces to fight the Nazis in Europe. In one recorded case, she went ahead of the main force and entered a bunker outside the German town of Tillet. By the time the allies stormed the place, the Widow had already single-handedly slaughtered all the Nazis present. Wiping the blood off her hands with the swastika flag, she calmly explained that the whole country had offered its soul up to her master and that she had come to collect.\n\n(The Twelve I#1) - On Wednesday April 25th, 1945, the Allies began their final assault on Berlin. Black Widow and eleven other vigilantes, led by the precognitive Master Mind Excello, went into the largely abandoned headquarters of the SS to check on possible snipers or other opposition. The search took them to an underground lab facility which actually turned out to be a trap. Once they were all inside, the doors closed and a special knockout gas was pumped in. SS officers hurried in to put the heroes in freezing tubes, planning to study and dissect these \"supermen\" after the war so they could turn the next generation of Nazis into a true master race.\n\n(The Twelve I#1 - BTS) - The SS officers hadn't counted on the Russian army reaching strategic parts of Berlin before the allied forces. The Russians captured and executed the SS officers responsible for keeping the Widow and the other heroes on ice.\n\n(The Twelve I#12 - BTS) - All the heroes were bombarded by the continuous cybernetic thought waves of the robot Electro who was desperate and alone after the impenetrable bunker cut off his connection to its inventor Philo Zog. Eventually, he'd form a bond with the android Dynamic Man, but the continued exposure to Electro's brainwaves left Excello and all the other heroes present uniquely capable of connecting with Electro.\n\n(The Twelve I#8 - BTS) - Because the Widow was stuck in suspended animation, \"Satan\" had no means of claiming the souls of the people who had sold them to him in exchange for favors. The result was a sizable backlog of evil men and women escaping their just fate.\n\n(The Twelve I#1 - BTS) - In recent years a German construction crew accidentally unearthed the underground facility where the heroes were being kept. The American authorities were informed and quickly took charge of the situation, bringing everyone back to the United States where they were revived and led to believe it was still the 1940s in an attempt to gently accommodate them to having been asleep for the past 60 years.\n\n(The Twelve I#1) - Phantom Reporter and Captain Wonder eventually saw through the ruse, forcing the military to inform the others of their current predicament as well. Black Widow and her compatriots all agreed with the army's offer to help them get adjusted so they could be what they were before: heroes serving their country in its hour of need.\n\n(The Twelve I#2) - Black Widow and the others moved to a luxurious mansion outside of New York supplied and funded by the army. They were welcomed by their liaison Colonel Dexter who informed them they were welcome to stay there rent- and expense free for 12 months while they got their bearings in this new world. Already feeling \"Satan\" reaching out to her, the Widow kept to herself in her room. She was briefly visited by the Phantom Reporter who had taken an instant liking to the gorgeous vigilante and noticed she looked troubled. She gently rebuffed his offer for help, thanking him for his kindness but telling him there were some deals that never expire, only when you do. Later that night, with the Moon high in the sky, the Widow was overcome by the calling of \"Satan\" and finally replied. Assuring him she'd heard and felt him and that nothing had changed about their deal. Voyant told her master she was once again his instrument of vengeance, belonging to him and no one else. \"Satan\" stroked her face in response.\n\n(The Twelve I#3) - The next morning, Phantom Reporter went to check on Claire and was surprised when she revealed she didn't need sleep. Sensing something was very wrong with her, he nevertheless flirted with the gorgeous Widow, offering to make her some breakfast which she accepted. At the end of the day, when the Reporter was meeting with Daily Bugle editor Samuel Kingston, the Widow looked in on them from her bedroom window. Even later still, it was the Reporter who saw Claire fly off into the night, curious to know what she was doing when the rest of the world slept. Acting on orders from \"Satan\", the Black Widow sought out Simon Dexter, breaking into his fancy New York City apartment to announce that the payment on his soul was long overdue. She then proceeded to slaughter the man to make sure \"Satan\" got what he was owed.\n\n(The Twelve I#4) - The following morning, around noon, Black Widow was still in bed sleeping when the Phantom Reporter peeked into her room to see what she was up to. A little while later, she overheard police officers coming by to see Laughing Mask. They then talked to the Reporter about the inexplicable murder of one Simon Dexter who was killed even though there were no signs of breaking or entering. Later that same day, the Widow briefly attended a going-away party thrown for Master Mind Excello who had used his vast personal fortune to buy an estate in Upstate New York. At the party, a slightly inebriated Phantom Reporter tried to chat her up, claiming they had so much in common and that they should date. Coldly, the Widow turned him down, stating that he knew nothing about her and that if he was smart, he'd keep it that way. She then walked off, leaving the embarrassed Reporter behind. A few hours later, Black Widow visited a goth-themed gay-friendly New York City nightclub where she felt instantly at home and caught the eye of quite a few female patrons.\n\n(The Twelve I#5 (fb) - BTS) - The Widow spent days away from the mansion she shared with the other 1940s heroes, which led the Phantom Reporter and the Laughing Mask to conclude that she'd found something more to her liking. This annoyed the Reporter, who was still harboring feelings for the mysterious heroine. At the same time, the Widow kept carrying out missions for \"Satan\", leaving behind a bloody trail of inexplicable murders that the NYPD started to investigate.\n\n(The Twelve I#6 (fb) - BTS) - Making the underground gay bar her new hangout, Claire eventually became close to a goth girl called Laura who was infatuated and fascinated with her, feeling the much older Voyant acted and felt like she belonged to the scene even before there was a scene.\n\n(The Twelve I#6) - Laura desperately tried to convince Claire to stay and not leave around midnight like she usually did, sometimes even disappearing for days afterwards. Laura was ready to follow her wherever she went, figuring that whatever it was she was into couldn't be too bad. With a grim look of reluctant resolution on her face, Voyant assured her lover that it really was that bad. Before Laura could introduce Claire to her friend Steffie, the Black Widow had already teleported away to claim \"Satan\"'s next victim. Not too long afterwards, having killed again, the blood-covered Black Widow sat around the maimed corpses of her victims with tears in her eyes, lamenting her damnable eternal chore.\n\n(The Twelve I#7 - BTS) - Investigating the brutal and bloody massacre of all the patrons of the Manhattan gay bar The Rail And Balls, Phantom Reporter couldn't help but suspect the Black Widow might be responsible for the killings.\n\n(The Twelve I#7) - Later that day, when the sun began to set, Claire was once again sleeping in her bed at the mansion. When she woke up, she discovered the Phantom Reporter in the chair next to her bed, a gun primed at her and eager to know more about her little midnight trips.\n\n(The Twelve I#8) - Unimpressed by the Phantom Reporter's gun or threats, the Black Widow nevertheless recounted her origins and current status as servant of \"Satan\" on Earth, only killing those who were wicked and truly deserved death. She claimed this meant she had nothing to do with the murders he was investigating, only to show off her massive mystical powers to convince him she was telling the truth because neither the Reporter or his bullets were a threat to her. She then dispelled another rumor for him: yes, her touch was lethal, but only when she wished it. To prove it, she caressed his face before telling him to go because she was about to do some things he should not want to see (presumably, she went out to kill some more for \"Satan\").\n\n(The Twelve I#9) - After returning home from her latest mission, Black Widow couldn't help but notice the Phantom Reporter tapping away at his typewriter all through the night and for most of the morning. When he even skipped breakfast, she decided to surprise him by bringing some coffee and toast to his room which amazed him to no end. Before they could discuss her sudden change of heart, they were drawn downstairs by the arrival of Master Mind Excello whose precognitive powers had told him he was vitally needed there for a crucial event, though he wasn't sure what it would be. Some time later, Black Widow remained at the mansion with the others while the Phantom Reporter left to investigate the brutal murder of their fellow 1940s vigilante associate the Blue Blade (the Reporter decided not to tell anyone where he was going and upon investigating, quickly learned the Blade had been killed by Dynamic Man who had been remote controlling the lethal killer robot Electro to prevent the swashbuckler from revealing he'd used Electro to cause the bloodbath in the gay bar).\n\n(The Twelve I#10) - After Blue Blade's death had become public knowledge, Black Widow, along with the surviving 1940s heroes, gathered at the mansion to hear the Phantom Reporter and Master Mind Excello's stunning proof that the robot Electro wasn't responsible for his death. Slowly establishing the evidence, they revealed the overly zealous, moral Dynamic Man was the true culprit and a sexless android to boot. Infuriated his true, inhuman origin was uncovered, the superbly powerful creature vowed to kill every last one of them.\n\n(The Twelve I#11) - Dynamic Man attacked his former companions, grabbing the Black Widow who found her touch of death had no effect on the synthetic creature. She was saved by the strong Rockman who punched the naked android through the nearest wall. Enraged, Dynamic Man used his vast strength to smash the support beams of the house causing the structure to collapse on his former allies. Thanks to Rockman's strength, everyone escaped unscathed even though Rockman himself seemingly perished underneath the vast amount of rubble. Black Widow remained behind by the ruins along with Mister E, the Witness and Laughing Mask while the others went to deal with the Dynamic Man. The next day, after Dynamic Man had been destroyed by the Phantom Reporter (who had inherited Fiery Mask's fire powers when the android killed him), she joined him and Master Mind Excello for a trip into the ruins of their mansion to look for Rockman. All they discovered was a hole that went at least a mile deep until it caved in on itself. A few days later, she attended the funeral of the Fiery Mask, also known as Jack Castle."
