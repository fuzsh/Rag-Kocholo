I quite like them and don't think they ripoff anyone. wouldn't say that their sound is darker than the cocteau twins. in fact, the only cocteau twins album that love spirals downwards is really similar to is victorialand. love spirals downwards goes for the acoustic-ethereal sound. very fragile, very pretty. i think i prefer idylls, but i have not listened to ardor enough to really have a strong picture of its sound in my mind yet. (woj@smoe.org)\n\nThis is flowing, ethereal music with flowing, ethereal vocals. Anyone who is enthralled by angelic, ethereal, alternative music will experience a corner of heaven when they hear this. They are not just cocteau twins wannabes (anymore than Mozart was a Bach wannabe). (vickie@enteract.com)\n\nLove Spirals Downwards sounds more like the cocteau twins (circa Treasure) than The Moon Seven Times does. I guess Love Spirals Downwards is a little gloomier than cocteau twins (despair must be a prerequisite to get signed to Projekt records). As for accessibility, if you are used to one band, you'll understand where the other is coming from. (dbucak@netaxs.com)\n\nI rather like the way love spirals downwards sounds like a subdued cocteau twins. very pleasant music. (clsriram@phoenix.Princeton.EDU)\n\nThere's quite a bit from Projekt that I like, though it tends to be stuff I have to be in the right mood for. I have a number of discs from Love Spirals Downwards, Black Tape for a Blue Girl and Lycia, and there's something to like about all of them, though I think Love Spirals Downwards is overall the strongest. (larnep@pathfinder.com)\n\nComments about live performance:\n\nThey started off doing trip-hop versions of a couple of songs—\"Sideways Forest\" and an unrecorded one. The rest of the set was acoustic and bare. The focus—Suzanne Perry's crystalline voice. While enjoyable (they included a great cover of a Mojave 3 song), it was a bit too languid for the crowd. I heard them again with a more attentive crowd at a music store shortly after. There they moved from pseudo-Eastern (\"Mediterranea\"), romantic airs (\"Love's Labour's Lost\") to a more Mazzy Star-ish feel. They seem to encompass all styles of ethereal music. (ethereal_lad@livejournal.com)\n\nRecommended first album:\n\nIdylls or Ardor, or Temporal for a beginning sampler.\n\nRecordings:\n\nIdylls (1992)\n\nArdor (1996)\n\nSideways Forest EP (1996)\n\nEver (1996)\n\nflux (1998)\n\nTemporal (compilation, 2000)\n\nLive (live, digital only, 2014)\n\nIdylls\n\nRelease info:\n\n1992—Projekt—36\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide in U.S.\n\nEcto priority:\n\nEssential for lovers of ethereal music\n\nGroup members:\n\nRyan Lum—guitar, bass, keyboard, sampling & programming, vocal arrangements, lyrics, engineering, production\n\nSuzanne Perry—vocals, lyrics\n\nGuest artists:\n\nJeff Stone—congas, shakers\n\nProduced by:\n\nRyan Lum\n\nComments:\n\nWhile these are songs with lyrics they seem the be mood pieces and not clearly differentiated from song to song. (woj@smoe.org)\n\nOne of the most beautiful, shimmering, ethereal albums I've ever heard. So highly recommended to ethereal fans that the recommendation scale breaks into tiny pieces! (vickie@enteract.com)\n\nIf you don't own this you should make acquiring it a very top priority. This is the most fulfilling *first* listen to a disk I've had since Sarah McLachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy debuted in my player a while ago. It's cocteau twinsish in a sense, but much much *prettier* and more *listenable* on first listen. Not as rough as cocteau twins is sometimes. Excellent, excellent, excellent. The best ethereal CD I've heard (and this is truly ethereal.) An absolute ecto-must-have. (mjmjminla@yahoo.com)\n\nnot as immediate as Ardor but still good. (cjmacs@micronet.net)\n\nI have Idylls, which I like a lot. (neal)\n\nIdylls is similar to Ardor but not as floating, more upbeat and percussive. While I like it, I still like Ardor best. (Marion)\n\nArdor\n\nRelease info:\n\n1996—Projekt—51\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide in U.S.\n\nEcto priority:\n\nEssential for lovers of ethereal music\n\nGroup members:\n\nRyan Lum—guitar, bass, keyboard, sampling & programming, vocal arrangements, lyrics, engineering\n\nSuzanne Perry—vocals, lyrics\n\nGuest artists:\n\nJennifer Ryan Fuller—vocals, lyrics\n\nProduced by:\n\nRyan Lum\n\nComments:\n\nThis is just beautiful. Dark, melodic, floating.... At some points the music is more Cocteau Twins than the Cocteau Twins themselves (I keep hearing bits from Treasure and Victorialand on this CD), and the floating vocals are well, floatingly beautiful. Angelic? (Marion)\n\ni have both of their first two albums, and would strongly advocate both. however, if you have to choose, i think ardor is a bit better. both are really pretty, but i think it has both a darker and a richer sound. (clsriram@phoenix.Princeton.EDU)\n\nEver\n\nRelease info:\n\n1996—Projekt—71\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide in U.S.\n\nEcto priority:\n\nFor those who liked the earlier albums\n\nGroup members:\n\nRyan Lum—guitar, bass, keyboard, sampling & programming, vocal arrangements, lyrics, engineering\n\nSuzanne Perry—vocals, lyrics\n\nGuest artists:\n\nProduced by:\n\nRyan Lum\n\nComments:\n\nIt is quite good, though it doesn't really measure up to their 2 earlier releases. it is pretty and ethereal and all that, but there are some songs where the electronic/ambient aspect is a little too heavy and doesn't really go with the overriding style. it is decent, but no particular songs stick with me as yet. (clsriram@phoenix.Princeton.EDU)\n\nflux\n\nRelease info:\n\n1998—Projekt—85\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide in U.S.\n\nEcto priority:\n\nFor lovers of ethereal pop/rock\n\nGroup members:\n\nRyan Lum—guitar, bass, keyboard, sampling & programming, vocal arrangements, lyrics, engineering, production\n\nSuzanne Perry—vocals, lyrics\n\nGuests artists:\n\nKristen Perry-Gow—vocals, lyrics\n\nJennifer Ryan Fuller—vocals\n\nRodney Rodriguez—nylon string guitar\n\nProduced by:\n\nRyan Lum\n\nComments:\n\nInteresting—this is a little rockier than their previous work. It still sounds very much like their earlier work, but a little more foreground-sounding. Suzanne Perry's voice is still stunning, and Ryan Lum's music still dreamy but overall the sound is a touch more lively. For some reason this just doesn't seem as compelling as their earlier work. Still, it is lovely. (Neile)\n\ni had seen some of the blurbs for this record which sang high praises, which, i guess, got my expectations up. it's not a *bad* record, but ethereal vocals over shimmery guitars and a drum machine aren't *that* novel and some songs don't really click. maybe i'm more turned off by the hype than by the record. hmmm. (woj@smoe.org)\n\nTemporal\n\nRelease info:\n\n2000—Projekt—Projekt 97\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide in U.S.\n\nEcto priority:\n\nRecommended\n\nGroup members:\n\nRyan Lum—guitar, bass, keyboard, sampling & programming, vocal arrangements, lyrics, engineering, production\n\nSuzanne Perry—vocals, lyrics\n\nGuest artists:\n\nKristen Perry-Gow—vocals, lyrics Jennifer Ryan Fuller—vocals, lyrics Rodney Rodriguez—nylon string guitar Jeff Stone—congas, shakers Doron Orenstein—saxophone\n\nProduced by:\n\nRyan Lum\n\nComments:\n\nThis is subtitled \"a collection of music past & present.\" It consists of 7 previously released tracks from their earlier albums, as well as 6 tracks \"previously unavailable on any love spirals downwards album\", of these, 2 are remixes, 1 is a live track, and 3 are rarities from singles and samplers. A good introduction to their work, or an extension of their catalogue for fans.
