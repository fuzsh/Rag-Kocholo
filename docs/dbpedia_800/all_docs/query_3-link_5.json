        "meta_description": "Lustre by Claire Voyant, released 22 September 2009\n\n1. Lustre\n2. Shine\n3. Into Oblivion\n4. Another Day (The Subtle Thief Of Youth)\n5. Mercurial\n6. Painted Gold\n7. Lost\n8. Flicker\n9. Broadcast\n10. Washaway\n\nLustre, shows a dramatic overall improvement in their musical compositions and a maturity in their lyrics. From the opening title track, the album grabs you and doesn&#39;t let go like a long lost love. Each track is beautifully written and accentuated by Victoria Lloyd&#39;s amazing vocals, but just because the music sounds beautiful, it doesn&#39;t mean that every song is a happy one. Lustre weaves a rich emotional tapestry of the human spirit, but its up to you to decide what it means to you.",
