        "text": "Robbie Robertson, legendary guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of The Band, released his fifth solo album, How To Become Clairvoyant, in his native Canada this week. It’s out in the US on 5 April and the UK and EU on 12 April. It’s loaded with guest musicians, including Eric Clapton, who performs on 7 of the album’s 12 tracks. Rolling Stone gave it four-stars and Goldmine raved, “this soulful record is Robertson’s best yet.”\n\nComing 13 years after his last solo album, other album guests include Steve Winwood, Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails, How To Destroy Angels), Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) and Robert Randolph. Renowned session drummer Jim Keltner took part in the recording sessions, as did Shar White and Michelle John, backing vocalists in Eric Clapton’s touring band since 2004. Pino Palladino (bass) and Ian Thomas (drums), who toured with Clapton in 2008, make up the rhythm section on the bulk of the tracks. Robertson co-produced the album with Marius de Vries, his long-time collaborator.\n\nIn the current issue of Rolling Stone (14 April 2011), Robertson discusses his collaboration and friendship with Clapton and more in a feature interview. For the first-time in over a decade, he’ll also make two high-profile U.S. TV appearances to promote the album. Robertson will perform the album’s first single, “He Don’t Live Here No More,” on The Late Show with David Letterman (CBS-TV) on 5 April and will be on The View (ABC-TV) on 6 April. NPR – National Public Radio – is currently streaming the album in its entirety. You can listen to individual songs here or the full album here until 4 April.\n\n429 Records will be issuing several different editions of the album. The Japanese edition of How To Become Clairvoyant will have a bonus demo version of “Won’t Be Back” with Eric Clapton. There will also be a deluxe double disc package featuring demos of “The Right Mistake” (Demo Version); “He Don’t Live Here No More” (Demo Version); “Fear Of Falling” (Demo Version); “This Is Where I Get Off” (Demo Version); “Madame X” (Demo Version) and “Houdini” (Demo Version). The last track is an outtake and all also feature Clapton. In the US, the deluxe edition will be available exclusively at Best Buy for a month beginning 5 April. A two-disc, gatefold edition of How To Become Clairvoyant on 180-gram vinyl and a limited edition collector’s set with 10 bonus tracks, a DVD with three multi-track mixes, a 70-page, full-color book with album artwork, lithographs and additional art will also be available.\n\nAs a member of The Band, Robertson has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall Of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. He is also a member of the Candian Songwriters Hall Of Fame.\n\nHOW TO BECOME CLAIRVOYANT – ROBBIE ROBERTSON\n\nProduced by Marius de Vries and Robbie Robertson\n\n01. Straight Down The Line\n\n02.
