        "text": "Praise\n\n\"Looking for a grown-up fairy tale? Almost more of a modern day, new age fairy tale than what I usually expect when I pick up some ‘Chick Lit’. Despite how far out there it was, though, I stayed up half the night so I could finish the book in one sitting. Great characters; the main character had that perfect balance of flawed and lovable.\"\n\n-Amazon Review\n\n\"A Buoyant Claire Voyant. Though some frequent flyers might fear their lives ending on an airplane, not many expect that mid-air is where their new lives might begin, but that is what happens to beautiful, self-absorbed, and unemployed fanny model, Claire Green. This is a wonderful story-although be warned that it’s also quite addictive-like the old potato chip commercial, you can’t read just one page. I found myself unable to stop reading, no matter how late the hour, or how early I had to get up. Claire never expects that when her flight takes off, what she’s left behind is not just her family, her friends and her life – but also the person she’d always thought she’d been. CLAIRE VOYANT is not only about her search for identity, and the chance meeting with a stranger who will completely change her life’s direction, but also about the ways in which we are actually all connected, and how flexible the notion of “family” really can be. This is a fabulous book – funny, warm, hopeful and wise. It takes everything you though you knew about family, dismantles it, and then puts it back together with the strongest and sweetest of glues. I loved this book and I can’t recommend it highly enough. Cheers, Saralee Rosenberg, for your insightful, generous, and loving new novel.\"\n\n-Amazon Review"
