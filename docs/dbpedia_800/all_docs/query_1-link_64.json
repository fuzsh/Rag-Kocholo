        "text": "More than three decades on, Love Spirals Downwards founder, Ryan Lum, continues to reinvent himself, creating captivating music that merges disparate genres with his signature use of guitar and female vocals. With “Noumenon” the ethereal sounds of dream pop blend seamlessly with elements of ambient electronica and trap, showcasing Lum’s ability to transcend traditional musical boundaries. This new track features his wife Anji’s sensual yet airy vocals layered over skittering beats, dramatic guitar, and lush, atmospheric production, creating a sonic landscape that is both immersive and evocative. Lyrically “Noumenon” delves into themes of emotional disillusionment and the struggle to carry on amidst feelings of isolation and pain, encapsulated in the refrain “Love is just a noumenon.” This introspective depth complements the song’s rich sound, exemplifying the timeless quality of Lovespirals’ music and proving that Lum’s creative evolution is far from over.\n\n“Noumenon” and “Noumenon (Drum n Bass Mix)” are available on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and many other streaming music services worldwide, while the “Guitar Focus Instrumental Mix” is exclusive to the 3-song downloadable release on Bandcamp.\n\nNoumenon (Single) by Lovespirals\n\nAdditionally, Lovespirals have released two edits of a music video for the “Noumenon” Original Version and “Noumenon (Drum n Bass Mix)” on YouTube, as well as a new episode of their Chillin’ with Lovespirals podcast where they discuss the new single, plus the ‘Flux’ vinyl reissue and more band news. Check it all out at YouTube.com/LovespiralsOfficial.\n\nCheck out “This Ain’t Love (Lovespirals Remix)” on the brand new Projekt Records release by Alan Elettronico, ‘Electronic Mind (Deluxe Edition).’ I had a lot of fun working on this mix with Anji and am excited that both the artist and label like it enough to make it the main single on both Bandcamp and Spotify. It’s good to be back with a new song after a long break.\n\nElectric Mind (Deluxe Edition) by Alan Elettronico\n\nLovespirals return to their darker hued roots with a new digital single. “The Call” shares some of the retro-90’s shoe gazer/dream pop vibes of their last full-length album, ‘Life Goes On,’ highlighting the lush guitar work Ryan Lum is known for. His soaring solo could easily have been plucked from the 1994, Ardor. Hypnotic bass and upbeat drums drive this melancholic song with an unexpected groove, while his wife Anji’s signature blend of earthy low voice and soaring ethereal harmonies lift your soul. Cover photo by Susan Jennings, the band’s longtime photographer who was actually behind the band being discovered by Projekt Records in 1991.\n\n‘The Call (Single)’ was released July 1, 2022 on all digital platforms including Bandcamp, Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Mp3, Tidal, Pandora and Apple Music.\n\nThe Call (Single) by Lovespirals\n\nLovespirals 3-song single, ‘Smile,’ is out NOW on all digital platforms including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Mp3, Tidal, YouTube, Deezer and Bandcamp. In addition to the brand new title track, ‘Smile’ features the moody song “Why Not Today,” that was previously only available on Bandcamp. All three songs continue the band’s tradition of working new influences into their signature dream pop sound. While a much lighter offering that 2018’s Life Goes On, there’s still a good deal of melancholy amidst the deceptively light, retro-esque, jazz and blues inflected indie pop tunes. Cover art by Tom Pathe, longtime friend of bandleader, Ryan Lum, and photographer for the 1992 debut album, Idylls.\n\nSmile – Single by Lovespirals\n\nProjekt Records founder, Sam Rosenthal of Black Tape for a Blue Girl, just released a new album to commemorate what would have been Timothy Leary’s 100th birthday. Entitled Tim, where are you now?, this collaborative album features many special guests, including Lovespirals, Steve Roach, Erik Wøllo, Mike VanPortfleet of Lycia, Brian Viglione of The Dresden Dolls, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Reggie Watts, and more. Be sure to check out “Starseed,” featuring classic ambient guitar leads from LSD band founder, Ryan Lum, as well as “PSY PHI love means High Fidelity” featuring both Ryan and Anji Lum alongside Byron Metcalf, Martin Bowes, and Rosenthal. Seems fitting to be part of an album dedicated to “the guru of LSD” created by the owner of the label that gave Love Spirals Downwards it’s start!\n\nThe CD is currently in preorder on Bandcamp, where you can alternatively purchase a digital download on the “Name Your Price” deal (meaning you can pay $0 if you want…), and it’s also available to stream on all digital platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube.\n\nTim, where are you now? by Sam Rosenthal & Projekt Artists\n\nAfter 6 years of hard work – and having experienced some of the most life changing years of my life – Lovespirals‘ 5th album is finally out. This one is dedicated to the fans of my earlier work from the Projekt Records years; you won’t be disappointed. Buy/stream/listen on all your favorite sites or buy it directly from us on our Bandcamp store. Limited edition 4-panel eco-wallet CDs with a matching pin are still available at the time of writing. You can also check out ‘Life Goes On’ via Pandora and give a thumbs up to your fave tracks!\n\n“Stunning… Gorgeous… Some of Ryan Lum’s best work as a songwriter and musician.. Haunting and ethereal. Absolutely Anji Bee’s most nuanced vocals… beautiful and sultry.” — Matt Rowe, MusicTAP\n\n&amp;lt;a href=”http://lovespirals.bandcamp.com/album/life-goes-on”&amp;gt;Life Goes On by Lovespirals&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n\nMusicTap made a little write up about our very soon to be released album, Life Goes On.\n\nSince 1992, the genesis of the current Lovespirals began a recording career as Love Spirals Downwards (Ryan Lum and Suzanne Perry) with four exquisite recordings (Idylls – 1992, Ardor – 1994, Ever – 1996, Flux – 1998), all on Projekt Records. After a short hiatus, the band regathered with a new vocalist by the name of Anji Bee, and released four additional excellent sets (Windblown Kiss – 2002, Free & Easy – 2005, Long Way From Home – 2007, Future Past – 2010) as Lovespirals. After a long, long break from recording as a duo (Anji Bee released a solo album, Love Me Leave Me, back in 2013), the Lovespirals iteration will deliver their fifth album, Life Goes On, with a collection of ten new songs written by the pair. Having been a fan from the beginning, I’m excited for this new collection of music from Ryan and Anji.\n\n— Matt Rowe\n\nHead over to MusicTap to read the full article.\n\nPart Dream Pop, part Americana, the new single from Lovespirals is considerably more upbeat than it’s predecessor, “Brother Against Brother.” Bandleader, Ryan Lum, juxtaposes driving blues riffs and dreamy shoegazer guitar, finding a delicious balance between his earlier Love Spirals Downwards work and more recent Lovespirals work. His wife Anji’s vocals exude a confidence born from years of familiarity with the material, with a lovely harmony of her natural earthy tone and haunting upper register.\n\nHeartstrings [Single] by Lovespirals\n\n“Heartstrings” is a high point in the tracklisting for Lovespirals’ upcoming 5th album and a celebration of the duo’s creative connection. The music video, created by the band themselves, is a beautiful representation of the song, shot during the height of California’s wildflower season. With 3 years experience shooting, editing and producing videos for their YouTube channel, Happy Healthy Vegan, this artistic couple have created what is surely their best and most professional looking music video to date.\n\nBuy the new single & music video on Lovespirals’ Bandcamp to help fund the band’s upcoming 5th album\n\nThe first new single from Lovespirals since their 2010 album Future Past marks a return to form for band founder Ryan Lum. Lum burst onto the American dream pop scene in 1991 as Love Spirals Downwards on the Projekt label, quickly establishing himself as one of the best ethereal producers and guitarists in the genre. “Brother Against Brother” is a swirling, ambient, folk-tinged dream pop track featuring heavily effected ethereal guitar and female vocals by bandmate Anji Bee. You can grab the digital single from Bandcamp or watch the official music video on YouTube.\n\nBrother Against Brother (Single) by Lovespirals\n\nBuy the 2-song single at http://lovespirals.bandcamp.com"
