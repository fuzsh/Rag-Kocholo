        "text": "So basically she's got 3 different modes. You can switch into each by ending combo with light attack. The Bleed one regens health based on damage inflicted on sp2. Poison power steals on sp2. Incinerate does extra burst damage on sp2. And when she's in each phase, she's immune to each of those effects. For example, if I am in bleed phase, I will be immune to bleed. This makes her great for lots of nodes, such as Biohazard. You inflict these dot effects if you use medium as last combo hit. 3 bleeds/incinerates/poisons are inflicted based if you use a heavy attack. This makes her great for Diss Track. Next, she works very well if your opponent is immune to stun, bleed, incinerate, or poison. If your opponent is immune to the DOT or stun you are inflicting, you gain a Clairvoyance Charge and gain power. This way you can spam sp2 much faster. If you have 20 Clairvoyance charges, you cannot gain any power through the DOT/Stun immune power gain. Each Clairvoyance Charge nullifies one buff while hitting somebody, or while getting hit. These Clairvoyance Charges can deal extra damage on sp3, and it hits pretty hard. Another awesome thing, sp2 inflicts buff immunity which removes all buffs and future buffs until buff immunity expires (you gain a lot of power). Her sp1 inflicts 3 DOT effects based on phase. A cool trick to know, if you use sp3 (activates Death Touch) and sp2, you regen double health, double power steal, and double burst damage for each phase. Her awakened ability is not necessary, but I will explain what it does. After you use your sp3, you gain a Death Touch passive. If you are going to be knocked out while Death Touch is active, you will regen 5% to 25% health (based on sig). Overall, she is a very versatile champ that can take on tons of situations. I would recommend suicides, but I have a 5r5 and don't run them but she still wrecks.\n\nSorry for the messy post, I was in a bit of a hurry. Hope it helped!"
