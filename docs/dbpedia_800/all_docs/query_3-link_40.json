        "text": "“Introducing the strangest, most terrifying character in action picture magazines – the Black Widow. You’ve heard of the black widow spider – that evil creature whose bite spells doom. Now start the adventures of another black widow – a human tool of Satan whose very touch means death !”\n\nContext\n\nThis is “Claire Voyant”, the first Black Widow at Marvel Comics. Which, back then, still was Timely Comics.\n\nShe appeared in August of 1940. The Widow was a provocative, controversial character by the standards of these days. In some respects, she evoked Fantomah.\n\nThe Widow fully returned in the The Twelve Limited Series, in 2008. Here we’ll only cover the material *before* that. Though one illustration — with the cool Veronica Lake look — is from The Twelve.\n\nFor orientation among the Black Widow characters (and similar), see our guide to our Black Widow character profiles.\n\nBackground\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nThe Black Widow wields the “power of evil”. Meaning that :\n\nThese are the more common effects. She can wield infernal magic to do many other things, but these are less frequent.\n\nDespite the source of her magic, it doesn’t have to be used for evil purposes. For instance, the Widow could magically heal a child.\n\nShe moves in mysterious ways\n\nThe Widow does much of her work as an ethereal presence. She would thus espy, influence people, and shadow her prey as an invisible and intangible spirit.\n\nThis allows her to act ominous and almost unstoppable. Like a nightmare the Widow is impossible to lose. She can appear anywhere, and seems to know everything.\n\nSomehow, the existence of the Black Widow is known to all evil criminals. All of them are terrified of her.\n\nShe also possesses a formidable presence and personal magnetism.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nAs often on writeups.org, the sub-section titles in this entry are song lyrics. It’s from one of my Rolling Stones favs (from the 1997 Bridges to Babylon).\n\nAnd of course, as I happen across them whilst copy-editing this profile, I have the song stuck in me head.\n\nAnd so shall thee. Mayhap.\n\nHistory (part 1)\n\nClaire Voyant was a medium. She conducted séancesParanormal ceremony to talk to the dead. to contact the spirit of dead relatives of her clients.\n\nIn 1940, she allegedly attempted to contact the spirit of one Mr. Wagler.\n\nSomething went wrong during the séance. Ms. Voyant was influenced by “Satan” to put a curse on the Wagler family. Her customers left in outrage at her witch-like imprecations.\n\nTragedy\n\nOn the way home, the Waglers’ car swerved and crashed.\n\nMrs. Wagler died outright. James Wagler was unscathed, his fiancée (or perhaps wife) Patricia was killed.\n\nUnhinged with grief and prodded by “Satan” James Wagler blamed the curse uttered by the crazed medium. He broke into Claire Voyant’s home and shot her dead.\n\nSatisfied with how his plan had come together, “Satan” swept in to collect the dead medium. Once back home, he turned Claire Voyant into his newest servant, the Black Widow.\n\nHe then let her return to Earth for a brief time – to kill James Wagler with her widow’s touch.\n\nAs she returned, “Satan” explained what her mission was :\n\n“On the upper world are mortal creatures whose hearts are blackened with wickedness and corruption. You, the Black Widow, will bring their evil souls to me !”\n\nPleased to meet you, hope you guess my name\n\nIn the Marvel Universe, “Satan” has been used as an alias by sundry demons of varying power. They usually do that to augment their clout with mortals.\n\nThe best-known impostors are actually extremely powerful netherlords in their own right. Such as Mephisto, Satannish, Lucifer or Marduk Kurios (the father of the Son of Satan).\n\nGiven the general style of “Satan” in the Black Widow stories, my bet would be Mephisto.\n\nThe Widow’s job is to bring “Satan” strong corrupted souls. This wouldn’t make sense for the Christian figure. Those souls would likely be his anyway, and grabbing them early violates the free will and redemption thing.\n\nOn the other hand, it matches known interests and strategies of Mephisto.\n\nHistory (part 2)\n\nThe Black Widow was next sent after the soul of crime boss Garvey Lang.\n\nShe influenced one of his henchmen to rebel against him, so Lang shot him.\n\nThe Widow then manipulated another criminal to give the impression that he had betrayed Lang. The boss murdered him too.\n\nFrom there the hellbent belle infiltrated a masked ball. She let her beauty tempt Lang into flirting with her and taking her aside.\n\nThey then both took their masks off. The Black Widow turned her pupils into skulls that claimed the soul of the horrified Lang.\n\nAnd could you stand the torture\n\n“Satan” then spotted two more men who were so evil that he would not wait for their souls.\n\nThese were Lewis and Sykes, at Groome Ammunitions. They planned to sell ammunition to both the Axis and the Allies.\n\n(Apparently the Netherlords support the Allies, and consider that betraying America is one of the gravest sins. Let’s not think about what this implies).\n\nClaire Voyant applied to become a secretary at Groome. The lecherous profiteers hired her on the spot. She revealed herself as the Black Widow once she was alone with Lewis, and killed him with a touch.\n\nSykes then came in. He instantly recognised her, and fled in terror to barricade himself in his office. But the Widow passed through the door like intangible mist, ignoring his gunfire.\n\nHe hurled chemicals at her, which seemed to hurt the agent of Hell for a bit. But she then threw her cape over Sykes, killing him.\n\nAnd could you stand the pain\n\nThe Widow was then sent after Karl Koodamore, the head of Murder Unlimited. “Satan” stated that this man was almost as evil as he was, and thus an upstart.\n\n(“Murder Unlimited” is a reference to the real-world Murder Incorporated gang of the 1930s).\n\nKoodamore’s killers had recently murdered a famous thespianAn actor – usually a theatre one.. The late actor had been seeing the wife of Koodamore’s current client.\n\nThe infernal beauty killed two thugs, then stalked Koodamore. A Murder Unlimited hitman committed suicide rather than let her touch him.\n\nA terrified Koodamore drove straight away for hours. However, the Black Widow just appeared in the middle of the road. The mobster tried to run her down, only to drive his car over a cliff.\n\nWhen you’re burning in the flames\n\nIn late 1942, the Black Widow seemingly joined an Allied raid on a Nazi stronghold, led by the Invaders.\n\nMy No-Prize HypothesisA made-up explanation to plug a plot hole. is that it was psychological warfare, with a female operative wearing a Black Widow costume.\n\nPresumably, the hope was that the Nazis would be suitably terrified. Given the unholy terror the Widow inspired in “men of evil” who inexplicably recognised her on sight, this was worth a try.\n\nThere is also one confirmed impostor. During a time travel mission, Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) disguised herself as the Black Widow to lower paradox friction.\n\nAnd I do believe in miracles\n\nIn 1943, “Satan” noticed a particularly evil man named Ogor.\n\nOgor pretended to be a mystical healer. He forbade people from seeing real doctors while they paid him. This led to the death of many a mark.\n\nBut the father of a young patient got wise to him. Ogor murdered this man, and immediately left town with the fortune he had made there.\n\nThe Black Widow soon caught up with Ogor, who died of a heart attack.\n\nBefore returning to Hell, the Black Widow snuck into the sick orphan’s house. Due to Ogor’s machinations, it was too late for conventional medicine to save the boy’s legs. But she used her infernal powers to heal the kid.\n\nAnd I want to save my soul\n\nA woman who… looked vaguely like the Black Widow was seen in a flashback. During the late Golden AgeSuper-hero comics from the late 1930s to the early 1950s., she took down a gang along with :\n\nOfficially this woman was the real McCoy, but this seems… dubious.\n\nPerhaps the Allied operative seen in 1942 continued to work with mystery men. Perhaps she used the Black Widow’s guise to terrify criminals. Who are, I’m told, a superstitious and cowardly lot !\n\nDescription\n\nThe Widow wears a dark purple long-sleeved legless leotard with a spider design on the stomach. Her cape design consists of wide blue and green vertical (yes, vertical) stripes.\n\nHer dark high-heeled boots are the same color as her leotard, and have a spiky yellow fringe. Her face is oddly spooky, with pale skin drawn against her skull and lots of eye-shadow.\n\nHer costume and exact appearance changed as she went through artists. Many of these illustrations were unusual for the times as they emphasised her curves and naughty bits. Such as the underlit breasts in the first picture.\n\nThe more modern illustration (below) is the 2007 visual recreation of the character by Chris Weston .\n\nPersonality\n\nThe Black Widow is an obedient servitor of “Satan”.\n\nHer first goal is to give her target a pervasive sense that everything is cursed. That some kind of grave retribution is coming. They must understand that they are about to be punished for their sins.\n\nThus, she will set the stage up by manipulating events and people. This will likely goad her target into committing more sins. She may also slay a few secondary targets as part of this setup.\n\nThen she moves in for the kill.\n\nYet sometimes, the Black Widow just barges in and kills her main victim. There may be factual or mystical reasons for this. Or perhaps she just handles the mission according to her mood.\n\nBetween missions, she apparently just lounges around in a Dante-style Hell like a bored 1940s movie star.\n\nAnd I know that I’m a sinner\n\nThe Black Widow claimed to be helping the “oppressed on Earth” by getting them “rid of the evil element !”. Her actions are indeed that of a killer vigilante rather than those of an agent of evil.\n\nOdder still, the Widow openly admits her agenda of lethal justice to “Satan”. But the Hell-lord does not seem to mind as long as the mission is accomplished.\n\nEven gratuitous acts of goodness on the Widow’s part are fine by him, as long as he gets the soul he ordered.\n\nQuotes\n\n“Vengeance has been mine… the master calls – I must return !”\n\n“Here is your kiss — the kiss of death !! Satan will see you soon !”\n\n“Evil one, I claim your soul for Satan !”\n\n“And so, the Black Widow is going to take your evil, merciless soul to the place it belongs — are you ready ? Lewis — come !”\n\n“And now… you must pay for your heinous crimes !! The Black Widow will not be cheated !”\n\n(Breaking the fourth wall ) “I’m not on Earth now, but as soon as I learn of evil which must be met with quick punishment, I shall travel the great distance and return to your people to treat them to — death !”\n\n“And so, I’ll bring my cargo to Hades ! But let the evildoer beware… for wherever he strikes… there he will feel the deadly sting of the Black Widow !”\n\nRelated articles on Writeups.org\n\nSource of Character: Timely comics."
