        "text": "Daunik Lazro, Kristoff K Roll, Sophie Agnel: Quartet Un Peu Tendre\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Daunik Lazro, Kristoff K Roll, Sophie Agnel (@)\n\nTitle: Quartet Un Peu Tendre\n\nFormat: CD\n\nLabel: Fou (@)\n\nRated:\n\n\"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" might be the most misleading album title of the year. What at first glance promises a gentle, perhaps even tender exploration of sound, quickly reveals itself as a ferocious assault on conventional musicality. It’s the kind of record that dares you to listen, dares you to find the beauty amidst the chaos, and laughs in your face if you think you've figured it out.\n\nThe album features a lineup of avant-garde veterans: Daunik Lazro on baritone saxophone, Sophie Agnel on piano, and the duo Kristoff K. Roll (Carole Rieussec and J-Kristoff Camps) handling electro-acoustic devices. If you’re familiar with these names, you already know that you’re not in for a smooth ride. Lazro, a stalwart of the French free jazz scene, brings his usual brand of bracing, guttural saxophone work that feels as if it’s tearing at the very fabric of sound itself. Agnel, on the other hand, isn’t content to simply \"play\" the piano — she interrogates it, manipulates it, and ultimately bends it to her will. Meanwhile, Kristoff K. Roll weave a tapestry of unpredictable, often unnerving sounds that challenge your very notion of what constitutes music.\n\nThe opening track, “Au Départ C’est Une Photo”, is a sprawling 31-minute odyssey that defies easy categorization. It begins with an eerie quietude—Agnel’s piano notes scatter like raindrops on a tin roof, while Lazro’s saxophone hums ominously in the background. Just when you think you’ve settled into a groove, the electro-acoustic elements creep in, turning the serene into something profoundly unsettling. It’s as if the musicians are constantly at odds with each other, each one vying for control, yet somehow creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe second piece, “L’Hiver Sera Chaud”, clocks in at just under 41 minutes and is no less demanding. This is the sound of winter as imagined by a mind teetering on the brink—bleak, cold, but with the occasional burst of unexpected warmth. Lazro’s saxophone work here is especially notable; he conjures sounds that range from the abrasive to the plaintive, all while Agnel’s piano provides a counterpoint that is as dissonant as it is compelling. The electro-acoustic elements by Kristoff K Roll, meanwhile, feel less like an accompaniment and more like an omnipresent force, shaping the entire listening experience in ways that are both subtle and overt.\n\nTo say this album isn’t for everyone is an understatement. This is music that demands your full attention, and even then, it’s likely to leave you feeling disoriented and perhaps a little uneasy. But for those willing to engage with it on its own terms, \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" offers a deeply rewarding experience. It’s the musical equivalent of staring into the void—what you find there is entirely up to you.\n\nComparisons to other avant-garde stalwarts like Anthony Braxton or the electro-acoustic explorations of Luc Ferrari are inevitable, but \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" carves out its own niche in the experimental landscape. It’s an album that, much like the artists involved, refuses to be pigeonholed, constantly shifting and evolving with each listen. Just when you think you’ve got it figured out, it throws another curveball your way, challenging your preconceptions and forcing you to reassess what you thought you knew about music.\n\nIn a world where much of what passes for experimental music feels like it’s trying too hard to be different, \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" feels refreshingly genuine in its disregard for convention. It’s not trying to be difficult; it just is. And that, perhaps, is what makes it so compelling.\n\nSo, is \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" an easy listen? Absolutely not. But is it worth your time? If you’re willing to dive deep into the world of avant-garde improvisation and let go of your expectations, the answer is a resounding yes. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.\n\nJarl: Isolation colours\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Jarl (@)\n\nTitle: Isolation colours\n\nFormat: CD + Download\n\nLabel: Zoharum (http://zoharum.com/) (@)\n\nRated:\n\nErik Jarl's \"Isolation Colours\" is a chilling odyssey through the spectral landscape of human emotion, viewed through the cold lens of isolation. In this album, Jarl continues to evolve his sound, building on the deeply immersive, often unsettling atmospheres he crafted in previous works like \"Turbulence\" and \"Hypnosis\". This time, however, he delves even deeper into the abyss, offering an experience that is as much a psychological journey as it is a sonic one.\n\nThe album consists of seven tracks, each named after a color or shade, suggesting a thematic exploration of how isolation alters perception. The opener, \"Circle 1 - Grey Scale One\", sets the tone with a soundscape that feels like the aural equivalent of a foggy morning: dense, impenetrable, and tinged with a melancholic haze. The use of analog synthesizers here, as throughout the album, is masterful — creating a sense of space that is at once expansive and suffocating. This isn’t music to comfort; it’s music to confront.\n\n“Circle 2 - Blue Grey (Livid)” extends this bleakness into a 14-minute descent into what can only be described as the auditory manifestation of a depressive episode. Jarl’s ability to evoke emotion through sound is on full display, as he layers textures that oscillate between hypnotic and harrowing. It’s as if he’s inviting you to sit in the discomfort, to explore the nuance of each shade of grey-blue that colors the mind in isolation.\n\nWhat’s striking about \"Isolation Colours\" is how it balances its hypnotic qualities with an undercurrent of unease. Tracks like “Circle 3 - Blue” might initially lull the listener into a trance, but there’s always something lurking beneath — a dissonance that keeps you from fully drifting away. It’s a testament to Jarl’s skill that he can maintain this tension across the album’s lengthy tracks without it ever feeling monotonous. Instead, each track becomes a different shade of the same bleak landscape, revealing new textures and emotions with every listen.\n\nPerhaps the most disorienting piece is “Circle 4 - Blindness”, a brief interlude that strips away color entirely, leaving the listener in a void. It’s a stark reminder of the album’s central theme: isolation is not just a loss of connection but a loss of sensory input, a numbing of the mind and spirit.\n\nIn comparison to his earlier works, \"Isolation Colours\" is more introspective, almost claustrophobic in its intensity. Whereas \"Misophonia\" was an assault on the senses, this album is more insidious, burrowing into your psyche and unsettling you in quieter, more subtle ways. The soundscapes are less aggressive but more haunting, leaving a lasting impression long after the final track fades.\n\nHowever, the album is not without its moments of clarity. “Circle 6 - White” offers a brief respite from the gloom, with a sound that’s lighter, almost ethereal. But even here, there’s an underlying tension, as if Jarl is reminding us that isolation is never entirely peaceful—that even in moments of calm, there’s an edge, a sense of impending return to darkness.\n\nI can say that \"Isolation Colours\" is a masterclass in ambient sound design, offering a deeply immersive exploration of the emotional and sensory effects of isolation. It’s not an easy listen — nor is it meant to be — but for those willing to dive into its depths, it’s a rewarding, if unsettling, experience. Jarl has once again proven himself to be a unique voice in the world of experimental music, capable of evoking profound emotion through his meticulously crafted soundscapes.\n\nFor those familiar with Jarl’s previous work, this album is a natural progression — more introspective and perhaps more challenging, but ultimately just as rewarding. Newcomers, however, might find themselves adrift in its cold, color-coded sea. Proceed with caution, but proceed nonetheless.\n\nAJNA: Inevitable Mortality\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: AJNA\n\nTitle: Inevitable Mortality\n\nFormat: CDx2 (double CD)\n\nLabel: Zoharum (http://zoharum.com/) (@)\n\nRated:\n\nAJNA, the project helmed by New York-based Chris F, has always been a name whispered with reverence in the shadowy corridors of dark ambient music. With \"Inevitable Mortality\", AJNA returns to the scene with a 2CD edition that expands on its already cult-favorite predecessor, adding six previously unreleased compositions to the original release. This edition, remastered by Chris Sigdell (of B°TONG fame), offers a more comprehensive exploration of AJNA’s dense and atmospheric soundscapes.\n\nLet’s not mince words: \"Inevitable Mortality\" is not here to uplift your spirits. Instead, it drags you down to the murky depths of human existence, where despair is not an option but an inevitability. The album’s opener, the eponymous “Inevitable Mortality”, sets the tone with its slowly unfolding layers of brooding drones. It’s as if AJNA is reminding us that, yes, life is fleeting, and no, you can’t escape its dark end. And why would you want to? The track’s haunting beauty lies in its ability to make you embrace the very thing you dread.\n\nThe addition of tracks like “A Tragic Landscape” and its follow-up, “A Tragic Landscape II (Deeper Solitude)”, only deepen the album’s melancholic allure. The titles alone should tell you everything you need to know — this is music for the soul’s darker nights. The tracks meander through bleak sonic terrains, where the only companions are distant, echoing drones and the occasional whispered sound, reminding one of the isolationist tendencies of Lustmord or the desolate soundscapes of Thomas Köner.\n\nThe fact that this album was initially released in a micro-edition of just 50 CDR copies adds a layer of mystique, as if AJNA's creations are sacred relics meant only for the chosen few. Fortunately, this extended edit, with its new graphic design and broader distribution, makes the experience accessible to a wider audience—but the sense of intimacy and exclusivity remains.\n\nMusically, AJNA walks the tightrope between the ominous and the introspective. Tracks like “Starvation” and “Hour of Affliction” aren’t merely background music; they demand your full attention, pulling you into their world whether you’re ready or not. The use of subtle, organic sounds — echoes of winds, faint rustles, and distant rumbles — creates an almost tactile sense of space, a signature of AJNA’s work. These elements ensure that the album doesn’t just play in your ears but seeps into your very psyche, a hallmark of the best dark ambient works.\n\nComparisons to other dark ambient heavyweights are inevitable. Like his contemporaries on labels such as Cryo Chamber and Cyclic Law, AJNA’s sound design is immaculate, rich with texture and depth. Yet, where some artists might lean into horror or outright dread, AJNA’s compositions are more philosophical, pondering the inevitability of decay and the transient nature of all things.\n\nFor those familiar with AJNA’s work, this is a must-have, adding further depth to his already impressive discography. And for newcomers, it’s a formidable introduction to an artist who understands that sometimes, the darkest places are where we find the most profound truths. So, turn off the lights, close your eyes, and let AJNA guide you through the void.\n\nThis album isn't just another addition to the dark ambient genre — it's a meditation on existence itself, crafted by an artist who seems to know the weight of every shadow and the echo of every silence.\n\nBarabba: Primo Tempo\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Barabba (@)\n\nTitle: Primo Tempo\n\nFormat: Download Only (MP3 + Lossless)\n\nLabel: Peyote Vibes\n\nRated:\n\nAnother release buried by tons of other stuff, that missed to get into my headphones and inspire some words. Better later than never! From the moment you hit play on \"Primo Tempo\", the debut album by the Italian trio Barabba, you get the distinct feeling that you're stepping into an eccentric cinematic universe — one where melancholic humor and biting introspection dance together awkwardly, but with undeniable chemistry. This six-track collection is a rollercoaster ride through the psyche, featuring everything from sardonic musings on self-identity to wry observations about the absurdity of life. It's like eavesdropping on a particularly philosophical conversation at a dingy bar, where the lights are dim and the air is thick with a smoky, existential haze.\n\nThe album’s opener, “Un Altro”, immediately sets the tone with its desire to be “another” — a sentiment that anyone who’s ever looked in the mirror and sighed can relate to. The lyrics oscillate between self-deprecation and a strange kind of defiant pride, as if Barabba is saying, “Sure, I might be a mess, but at least I’m my mess.” The song is a perfect introduction to the band’s ironic and choosy lyrical style, where every word seems to be carefully selected for maximum impact, yet delivered with a casual shrug that suggests they don’t really care if you get it or not.\n\nMoving on to “Bastare a me stesso”, featuring Paco Sangrado and Serena Abrami, the mood deepens. The track’s exploration of loneliness and self-sufficiency feels like a late-night confession, shared after one too many drinks. The contrast between the yearning lyrics and the slightly detached delivery creates a delicious tension—Barabba seems almost amused by their own misery, as if they’re fully aware of the melodrama and leaning into it with a smirk. It’s a bit like if Morrissey suddenly developed a sense of humor, and it’s absolutely delightful.\n\n“Momo”, with its baritone sax contributions from Tommaso Uncini, injects a jazzy unease into the mix, capturing the jittery energy of a protagonist constantly on the run—from demons, from himself, or maybe from the weight of his own thoughts. It’s here that Barabba’s cinematic aspirations come into full view, with the track playing out like a noir thriller, where the hero is forever trapped in a shadowy world of his own making.\n\nWhen you reach “Quei Due”, featuring Giovanni Succi and lyrics by Marco Drago, the album takes a turn into darker, more introspective territory. This is Barabba at their most poignant, reflecting on past relationships with a mix of wistfulness and resigned acceptance. The song captures the awkwardness of running into an old flame—both the nostalgia for what was and the stark realization of why it didn’t last. The collaboration with Succi is a masterstroke, adding an extra layer of emotional complexity to the track.\n\nThe album closes with “Bianco Natale”, a sardonic twist on the traditional holiday sentiment. It’s a perfect encapsulation of Barabba’s ability to take something familiar and turn it on its head, revealing the bitter truths hidden beneath the surface. If you’ve ever found yourself rolling your eyes at the forced cheerfulness of the holiday season, this track will resonate with you on a deep, almost uncomfortable level.\n\nIn terms of production, Riccardo Franconi and Nicola Amici have crafted an album that feels raw yet polished, with every note and effect serving to enhance the lyrical content rather than overshadow it. The guest contributions are seamlessly integrated, adding variety without distracting from the trio’s core vision.\n\n\"Primo Tempo\" is an album that feels both intimate and grand — a paradox that Barabba navigates with remarkable skill. It’s the sound of a band unafraid to expose their vulnerabilities, yet fully aware of the absurdity of it all. Fans of Italian indie music with a taste for the ironic and the introspective will find much to love here. For those new to Barabba, this album is a perfect introduction — a “primo tempo” that promises even more depth and complexity in whatever follows.\n\nIn a music landscape often dominated by polished but empty and often banal productions, \"Primo Tempo\" stands out as a refreshing reminder that sometimes, the best art comes from simply telling it like it is — albeit with a knowing wink and a sly grin."
