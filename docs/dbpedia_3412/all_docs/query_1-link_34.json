        "text": "Scenario: You're at the court of King Henry VIII and come face-to-face with the monarch.\n\nContext And Personality: The fact that King Henry VIII of England had six wives is well known, as is his determination to get what he wanted from the church. As King Henry navigated the tumultuous political and religious waters of 16th-century Europe, he bounced around a lot.\n\nHe desperately fought to end his first marriage, and he split from the Catholic Church to do it. Henry's second marriage ended in the beheading of his wife, Anne Boleyn, amid accusations of adultery and threats on his life. Henry's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, wasn't attractive enough for him so he divorced her, while his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, was also beheaded for betraying her king. If Henry didn't like what he was faced with, he was not afraid to simply get rid of it.\n\nThere are theories about why Henry VIII became increasingly disagreeable later in his life. A jousting accident in 1544 left him unable to take part in sports. He definitely suffered a leg injury in the accident and may have experienced head trauma, as well. Leg ulcers caused Henry great pain and some of the medications used may have introduced lead into his system - impacting his brain function and bringing on behavioral issues.\n\nOutcome: Smile and nod... just smile and nod.\n\nScenario: Queen Elizabeth I whispers to you about her latest suitor.\n\nContext And Personality: There was no paucity of men who tried to woo Queen Elizabeth I during the 17th century. Dukes and earls from England and France were among the top contenders for her hand in marriage, with King Philip II of Spain and King Eric XIV of Sweden among those who vied for the queen.\n\nIn the end, Elizabeth declared she was \"already bound unto a husband which is the Kingdom of England.\" Navigating the ups and downs of her romantic and diplomatic affairs may have been a bit exhausting, but the queen also, reportedly, had horrid breath. Despite using \"tooth cloths,\" toothpicks, and various herbal mouthwashes, her bad teeth - the result of a love for sweet foods - decayed as she aged and eventually turned black.\n\nOutcome: Holding your breath helps you get through it, but you may black out for a bit.\n\nScenario: You run into Martin Luther walking through the streets of Wittenberg.\n\nContext And Personality: German monk, theologian, and outspoken critic of what he perceived to be abuse within the Roman Catholic Church, Martin Luther didn't let up no matter the circumstances. After famously nailing his 95 Theses to the chapel door in Wittenberg, Luther's relentless nature showed no signs of easing up.\n\nExcommunication, a summons to the Diet of Worms, and even being outlawed didn't stop him. His persistence paid off in the end, although numerous revolts erupted as a result of the religious split that reshaped Christianity. In his final days, he shifted his criticism to Jews and groups of non-Catholic Christians.\n\nPerhaps author Eric Metaxas said it best when he described Luther as \"cranky and sick,\" but that wouldn't have made talking to him any more pleasant.\n\nOutcome: He criticizes everything in sight - you, the weather, the buildings, anyone else in the vicinity.\n\nScenario: You hit up the library and spot Isaac Newton on the other side of the stacks.\n\nContext And Personality: In his book about Isaac Newton, astronomer and science writer Florian Freistetter admitted, \"I worship Newton more than almost any other scientist of the past.\" He went on to explain:\n\nHe was such a jerk... an eccentric, an egoist, a troublemaker and a mystery-monger, who tolerated no criticism; was uncompromising, vengeful and conniving, but was also the greatest genius ever to have lived.\n\nBy all accounts, this is how most people perceived Newton. One of Newton's contemporaries, William Whiston, described him as having \"the most fearful, cautious, and suspicious temper that I ever knew.\"\n\nNewton was a revolutionary in science and math but didn't handle criticism well. He regularly insulted his colleagues and ruined the reputation of rival mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz by accusing him of plagiarizing calculus.\n\nOutcome: You don't say much, mostly single-word phrases so you don't upset him.\n\nScenario: You and Rasputin sit down for a meal.\n\nContext And Personality: Mystic and advisor to Russian royalty, Grigori Rasputin was said to possess supernatural abilities, legendarily \"curing\" Prince Alexei of his hemophilia. Presenting himself as a monk at court, Rasputin reportedly engaged in excessive drinking and affairs with women in less formal settings. There were rumors about an affair with Czarina Alexandra alongside cries of corruption brought on by Rasputin's influence on the royal family.\n\nRasputin was killed in 1916. According to lore, his demise came with great effort from his killers. Rasputin was given food and wine that was laced with cyanide, shot, and beaten, but was still alive when his body was thrown into the Neva River in St. Petersburg.\n\nOutcome: The \"mad monk\" was manipulative and mysterious in life, and persistent even in death, so ending a conversation with him takes effort.\n\nScenario: The dinner party conversation turns to military experiences and you try to chime in with your accomplishments.\n\nContext And Personality: There's the possibility that, after a conversation with Napoleon Bonaparte was over, he'd craft a subversive way to come back and start another one. Even before that, talking to Bonaparte would have been a lot to take.\n\nBonaparte's military accomplishments during the late 18th century helped set the stage for him to rise to political power in France. By the early years of the 19th century, he'd declared himself emperor and set his sights on taking over the whole of Europe.\n\nNapoleon was never satisfied and feared showing weakness. By the time he was exiled on St. Helena, he'd made himself consul for life, Emperor of the French, Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, and King of Italy, among other titles and awards.\n\nOutcome: Your efforts to impress Napoleon fail and you leave the conversation demoralized."
