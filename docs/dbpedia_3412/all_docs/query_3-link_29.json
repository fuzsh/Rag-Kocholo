        "text": "As we transition from university to the workforce, creating a distinct graduate identity becomes crucial for success. One often underestimated but powerful tool in this journey is networking. It's a fundamental part of social connections that can influence job information and improve employability. Networking in the professional world comes in various forms, from formal events to casual connections with associations, mentors, and friends made during our academic years. Industry professionals like Mr. Andrew Camilleri and Mr. Anthony Matis highlight the importance of internal networking within organizations, considering it a skill often overlooked but critical for effective operations. Building networks within our workplace, whether with classmates or colleagues, can evolve into mentorship opportunities, contributing significantly to our professional growth. Networking acts as a vital bridge between academia and the workforce, offering not just job opportunities but also the chance to build lasting professional relationships. It's important for graduates to recognize the diverse benefits of networking as they navigate the early stages of their careers, committing to leveraging this powerful tool to shape their professional destinies. #networking #professionalnetworkingevent #graduateemployability #westernsydneyuniversity #wsu\n\nThe Key to Unlocking Graduate Career Success: Business Networking As an undergraduate student, I come to appreciate the immense value of business networking in shaping my future career success. Networking is not just about exchanging business cards or attending events; it is a powerful tool that unlocks opportunities and propels us toward our professional goals. At this stage, I realize that networking is about building connections with professionals in my desired field. It's about seeking mentorship, gathering industry insights, and broadening my horizons. By actively engaging with experienced individuals, I gain access to invaluable knowledge and guidance that textbooks alone cannot provide. Networking is not just a one-way street. It is a collaborative process where I can contribute my skills, ideas, and perspectives to the professional community. By actively participating in discussions, attending industry events, and sharing my experiences, I can establish myself as a knowledgeable and valuable contributor. This not only enhances my personal brand but also positions me as someone who is dedicated to continuous learning and growth. Moreover, networking provides me with a supportive community of like-minded individuals with similar aspirations and goals. Connecting with peers and professionals allows me to exchange ideas, seek advice, and even collaborate on projects. This community creates an environment that fosters innovation, encourages collaboration, and supports my personal and professional development. #networking #careerdevelopment #careersuccess #professionalnetworkingevent #graduateemployability\n\nLast week, SMU Postgraduate Career Services organized a workshop on ‚ÄúNetworking for Professional Growth‚Äù. Facilitated by our super networker Ryan Lim, MSID, our students learnt about the power of networking for career development. Ryan had a lot of good advice (too much for this post!) so we are going to share a few tips - if you want to know more, invest 3 hours of your time for our next workshop üòâ Some takeaways from the workshop: 1. Be nice to everyone, you never know who you may meet (although we think people should be nice in general anyway üòé ). Unplanned networking may be one of the ways that you land an opportunity you hadn't considered before. When you do advance, also be helpful and pay it forward! 2. Always have some physical name cards with you! It helps recruiters and the people you meet remember you better. 3. Get mentored! Do note that a mentoring relationship requires trust, mutual like and respect and a mutual investment of time and energy. While the mentee doesn't need to agree with everything advised by the mentor, they need to appreciate the mentor for what they bring to the table. 4. Connecting first on LinkedIn, then meeting face-to-face, makes forging a connection easier. 5. It is not \"boasting\" if you are being factual about your abilities and achievements. Just don't dominate the conversation. Many thanks to Ryan for an engaging and insightful morning!

Networking 101. It starts here. Talk to your current or former colleagues. It is the best way to stay up to date on uni stuff. You'll often get more info from peers than from your department or uni. I often shared positions or opportunities that were not public yet with my colleagues and vice versa. 2. Actively seek opportunities! It goes hand in hand with the first point. Look out for yourself because opportunities will not chase you when you start. Get out there! Find that next internship or seminar that will put you in a preferable position. 3. Find a hobby to improve a skill! Have multiple hobbies, and make sure one will improve your career. Be it writing articles or making videos, try to incorporate and practice it. 4. Try different things! As an undergrad, you'll soon find out that there are many career paths. The best way to figure out which one's for you is to try them. You don't have to be dead set on option A and exclude option B. Try both. It might change your mind and save you from misery. 5. Figure it out yourself! Get into this mentality ASAP, especially if you're going down a research path. At first, getting in a situation where you must do something yourself can be frustrating, but it will pay off. The more often you \"figure it out\" the better you get at learning and problem-solving. In the end, you become solution-oriented and don't even see problems anymore, just challenging learning paths.\n\nThe value of business networking for graduate career success: Graduating from university is a significant accomplishment and necessary to achieving graduate career success. However, academic qualification alone won‚Äôt suffice. As the business industry becomes increasingly dynamic and competitive, graduates must use networking as a tool to leverage themselves forward. Networking is a strategic tool that allows you to connect with like-minded individuals, professionals, and industry leaders. When these connections are managed effectively, they become a gateway to a range of opportunities including access to mentorships, career possibilities, and industry insights. Given the resources at your disposal, these opportunities, acquired through networking, give you a competitive advantage. Through networking, you can meet potential experienced mentors who could be pivotal in your personal and professional development. Another benefit of having connections in the industry is being able to stay educated and current with access to important information. The term hidden market refers to jobs that aren‚Äôt advertised or posted online, but are instead filled through networking, referrals, and recommendations. Therefore, by expanding your network, you will be able to increase your chances of discovering job openings before they are made public. With a well-established professional network, you can position yourself to be a part of this market and get closer to your dream job. Networking is about developing meaningful relationships that will offer you the insights, opportunities, and support system you need to achieve graduate career success. #businessnetworking #networking #careersuccess\n\nI wish I knew this about the transition from student life ‚û°Ô∏è working life Networking. Is. Everything. Everything. When you move into the professional world, first it‚Äôs about having the right attitude and enthusiasm, and then it is about who you know ü§ù (You know that old saying. It‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs who you know - I can 100% confirm this to be true) And that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be from a well-connected family or have a million LinkedIn connections, because it‚Äôs actually about the quality of connections and how you make use of these relationships ‚û°Ô∏è Find someone who you‚Äôre actually interested in and who you‚Äôve been following for some time ‚û°Ô∏è Put together a well-thought-out and personalised connection request ‚û°Ô∏è Focus on building a quality, long-term relationship with them, rather than immediately trying to something out of them (like ‚Äúcan you get me a job RIGHT NOW pls‚Äù) Having the right attitude + networking well = you will land new opportunities to improve your career #students #graduate #career #networking\n\nüí° WEEKLY ACTIONABLE NETWORKING TIP üí° What is the number one skill recent college graduates wish they learned in college, but didn‚Äôt? ü§î ANSWER: How to build their own professional network. üí° In a recent poll, we asked young professionals, 1 to 3 years into their career, what they wished they would have learned in college, but didn‚Äôt. The most popular answer was that they wish they learned how to network earlier. And digging deeper into why they didn‚Äôt begin to network in college? -They didn‚Äôt know how -They didn‚Äôt make it a priority -They thought receiving a diploma was enough to see the job offers start rolling in Networking is one of those activities that college students are told to do, but never shown how to do it. Very few make networking a priority. The good news is that if you make the decision to start building your network, you will stand out amongst your peers and unlock hidden job opportunities. üëÄ It starts with meeting one new person today. Just one. ‚úÖ P.S.: The number two answer to that poll was financial literacy, now that they are making money. More to come on that. #actionablenetworking #career #collegegrad #collegestudent #networking"
