        "text": "A backdrop, a stool, a beverage, a microphone. A man wanders onstage and grumbles self-deprecatingly; the audience fidgets in anticipation. The world is in flames, and such familiar comforts are an escape. Please, let us laugh.\n\nWe’re living through a comedy-as-theatre boom: metatheatrical quasi-autobiographies (Kate Berlant, Daniel Kitson), avant-garde character work (Natalie Palamides, Cole Escola), quicksilver candor (Jerrod Carmichael, Taylor Tomlinson), and Spalding Gray-esque evening-length storytelling (anything written or produced by Mike Birbiglia). But Colin Quinn, in his soothing, pseudo-cantankerous standup special “Small Talk,” at the Lucille Lortel, wants you to know right away that he won’t be bothered with all that young person’s guff. He’s skeptical of social media, if you can believe it. He mocks his own untucked shirt and his gym shoes. (“I’m an old man,” he says, “and I’m dressed like a twelve-year-old boy.”) His performance is scripted, and loosely organized around themes, but we are mostly in shaggy-comic territory. “Small Talk” is a club set barely disguised as a show.\n\nQuinn’s beloved stage persona, tailored and then washed soft by a million tour dates, is a Brooklyn stoop philosopher, an Irish American blue-collar sage. In various comedy specials for Netflix and HBO, Quinn has gruffly shepherded his audiences through a history of the world (“Long Story Short,” from 2011), American politics (“Unconstitutional,” from 2015), and the formation of New York’s demographic hodgepodge (“The New York Story,” from 2016). In that last production, buffed to a high shine by its director, Jerry Seinfeld, Quinn talked frankly, and deliberately stereotypically, about race—a provocative high-wire act in which his tightly packed joke writing and sawtooth bonhomie served him well.\n\nIn this less polished show, directed by James Fauvell, it seems as though Quinn originally planned to talk about something bigger than small talk. The set, designed by Zoë Hurwitz, hints that he intended to chart a history of self-expression: on a series of hanging chalkboards, we see words like “Persona,” reproductions of cave handprints, some emoji rebuses, and, bewilderingly, Modigliani’s “Girl in a Sailor’s Blouse.” He never refers to these. He does, however, have a handful of tidy jokes about Socrates—“a ballbuster,” he notes. (“He’s, like, ‘Hey, how you doing?’ Guy’s, like, ‘Good.’ And he’s, like, ‘But what is good?’ ”) There are also a couple of high-density bursts of monologue, which attempt larger, more organized thinking about identity, with observations such as “Your social-media profile is who you think you are, and your browser history is who you are.”\n\nAnother theme is, as the title tells us, banter. In his most beautiful passage, Quinn compares small talk to two ships signalling each other at sea:\n\nThey’re not going to talk. They’re not going to stop and have a chat in the middle of the ocean. If a storm comes, they can’t save each other. But they’re basically acknowledging, “We understand that we’re two ships and all the joy and sorrow that comes with being a ship.”\n\nBrevity is the soul of these exchanges. Quinn has a New Yorker’s impatience with asking too much of your neighbor—c’mon, bud, just acknowledge the weather and move along. He scoffs at what we once called political correctness and at the same time decries the profusion of ugly voices on the Internet. This tempts him into contradiction: he sometimes loves the invigorating wire brush of insult, other times waxes rueful about the end of manners. (He contains fuckin’ multitudes.) Regardless, there’s a mushy quality to “Small Talk.” Some of Quinn’s political observations—especially his jokes about both the left and the right being “cults”—feel overripe.\n\nQuinn’s best shows marry his bristly texture and a fitting structure, like the chronology that gave “The New York Story” a sense of momentum. In “Small Talk,” you can spot waypoints—the Socrates gag, a playful bit about medieval smack talk—but his scattered musings haven’t constellated. Even Quinn himself seems aware that the hour drags: one of his endearing storytelling qualities is his tendency to bum-rush his own punch lines, but this time his delivery is so quick that his words collide. Quinn’s palpable menschiness still makes the performance a pleasure, but as he talks his voice fades into a soporific sound—not comedy, exactly, but comic patter.\n\nA guy kvetching is one kind of New York lullaby; another is the “Rent” ballad “Seasons of Love,” which became one of the unofficial anthems of the pandemic. If you can tell me, without doing the math, that there are five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes in a year, then you, too, have probably heard Jonathan Larson’s anthem more than a few times. You’ll hear it again at the beginning, middle, and end of Anthony Rapp’s solo show, “Without You,” at New World Stages, the actor’s account of starring in the groundbreaking rock opera and of two losses that he suffered during its ascent. One of those bereavements is well known: Larson’s fatal collapse, in 1996, the day after the show’s dress rehearsal downtown. The other loss, which occurred after the show had moved to Broadway, was the death of Rapp’s mother.\n\nThe basic components of this one-man show are the same as those of “Small Talk”: a backdrop, some chairs, beverages, and a microphone (though this mike is small and taped to Rapp’s temple). But in nearly every other way, the clean-cut Rapp is Quinn’s opposite. Very little in “Small Talk” touches on the personal—Quinn cringes at anything that smacks of confession or mawkishness. In contrast, Rapp’s manner clings; his face pleads. He pauses for the audience to applaud old news, like Larson’s nearly thirty-year-old Pulitzer Prize, and, despite a light peppering of original songs and covers, he often resorts to singing numbers from Larson’s masterpiece. After all, there’s nothing easier than luring a “Rent” lover down memory lane.\n\nAs for Rapp’s mother, it’s strange that, in a piece meant as a tribute, we learn so little about her. Though Larson’s lyric insists that there are more than five hundred thousand ways of measuring a life, Rapp’s cabaret never attempts to list his mother’s accomplishments, or to narrate her story outside of her impact on her actor son. I’m not sure that we even learn her name. We do hear a bit from her, in quotes voiced by Rapp, expressing love for him and eventual acceptance of his sexuality, taking pride in his achievements, and being terrified of cancer. Rapp has not delved further here. His best-selling autobiography, published in 2006 and also called “Without You,” is both franker and, odd to say about a memoir, less self-regarding.\n\nOf course, it is absurd for me to resent self-regard in a one-person show. What else is that mode of performance for? Put someone onstage with a mike and an audience and all those eyeballs shine back—a big compound eye, insectile and glittering. What is there to say to it other than “Look at me” or, as Quinn and so many of his fellow-comics do, “Look at yourselves”?\n\nOh, how I wish you’d been able to come with me to “cryptochrome.” Evan Silver, a rara avis of experimental theatre, presented this piece, a gorgeous, trippy eco-cabaret, in a Bushwick warehouse space called We Are Here, as part of the Exponential Festival. In the production, Silver’s alter ego Tiresias—the blind, gender-switching prophet of Greek mythology—directs us to nonhuman kinds of perception.\n\nAgain there’s a backdrop, a tall perch, a beverage, a microphone. But where Quinn and Rapp presented themselves as Everydudes in jeans and sneakers, Tiresias is Maleficent in a Buddhist monastery—long black silk gloves over branchlike talons, a bald head painted as white as the moon, the rest of their body dagger-slim in narrow black pants and patent-leather boots.\n\nInspired by deep research into animal proprioception (the awareness of body position), Silver has composed an interlacing sequence of monologues that invite the audience to imagine the experiences of various species. Accompanied by Tristan Allen on keyboard, Tiresias tells us, in a crooning murmur, “You’re a hawk,” flying across an ocean guided by magnetic instinct; then you’re a snake; then you’re a half-digested mole in the snake’s belly. Animals find their way by tasting heat, or by seeing ultraviolet light, or by echolocation. Tiresias takes a moment to sing a poignant song about Echo, the nymph who was abandoned by Narcissus and then found refuge among the whales.\n\nThis isn’t exactly a one-person show. Mizuho Kappa dances elegantly on a nearby platform, playing each creature—laying eggs as a dragonfly, or fanning the air with a paper approximation of a hawk’s wing. So why does Silver seem so profoundly alone? Almost as an afterthought, Tiresias tells us about human senses and their vulnerabilities—for instance, premature macular degeneration, which has left Silver, their sight fading, singing hymns about photoreceptors. The next time that moon-white face turns toward us, with a jagged line of black makeup running through it like a crack, we see it with newly tuned senses, with Silver’s eyes. So that’s what we’re hoping to do at all these solo performances—to meld, for a moment, with the person at the microphone. ♦"
