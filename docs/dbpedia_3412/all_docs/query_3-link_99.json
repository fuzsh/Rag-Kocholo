        "text": "This post is about distraction, understanding what it is, where it comes from and practical steps to overcoming it.\n\nIf you are reading this, I bet you can relate to the drift of taking your phone and spending the next couple of minutes on social media, just browsing through your newsfeed looking for nothing specific. Apparently checking whatever is happening for the day or whatever is trending on your favorite social media app. Maybe it‚Äôs even how you found this post, except you are signed up to my email list or a friend shared it with you. Before we continue, if you‚Äôve not, you should consider signing up to my email list so you can receive new blog post in your email and read them only when you plan to. üòä )\n\nAs I was saying, I think it‚Äôs okay to assume a lot of people will be familiar with this practice and experience of aimlessly browsing through social media to find nothing specific, you are not exactly sure what to expect but you know for sure that you‚Äôll see something that‚Äôd be tad exciting. So, we give in, it gets comfortable and before you know it 30 minutes to an hour is gone in one drift. Just checking to see what‚Äôs making wave for the day. And It‚Äôs not even restricted to social media or our mobile devices alone, but because these are the most common means of distraction today and perhaps the most relatable, I‚Äôll focus on that in this post.\n\nTo be clear, I‚Äôm not saying social media and our phones are bad. The problem of distraction is often beyond tech and our phones. But our smart phones and mobile devices are not free of blame for they have become a major means by which we can be distracted and a means by which our distraction is sustained mostly because of the number of stimulations we can get in one bit. That being said, if the source of your distraction is deeply beyond your phone addiction, you could still be as distracted as you are now even if you put your phone away or deactivate all your social media apps. Maybe you‚Äôve even tried this and discover all you did was just replace the distraction with a different one. So, in place of spending time on your phone when you shouldn‚Äôt, you could be randomly doing something else that you shouldn‚Äôt in that moment.\n\nIf that point is clear, then you should recognize distractions that often come in these forms and that‚Äôs what this post is about.\n\nWhy we go in search of that which makes us comfortable instead of doing what we ought to. This post will also help you understand distraction in ways you‚Äôve probably never thought about before, it will explain what distraction really is and where it comes from then suggest effective and proven ways to avoid them to become more productive.\n\nDistraction simply refers to anything that prevents you from concentrating or focusing on something you planned to do.\n\nIn this definition, emphasis is placed on ‚Äúplanned‚Äù and the thing that causes you to avoid executing that plan.\n\nBasically, to really be distracted is to have your attention diverted from doing something you planned to do, to a completely different thing. And like Nir Eyal said,\n\nThese are triggers that come from within us. In the form of our thoughts and emotions. They come from inside us, the agitation of our mind. Like when you feel bored, and your response is to escape it, so you take your phone and check social media. Just like your response to feeling cold would be putting on a coat, going close to the fireplace or doing something that increases your temperature. So, where there is a trigger, there is often a response. It‚Äôs important to see that the response (e.g., using our mobile phone to escape boredom) is not the cause of the trigger (boredom) but a result of it. It is merely a symptom than the cause. Although the wrong response can indeed increase this agitation of our mind, causing us to remain distracted.\n\nThese on the other hand are environmental, situations and events that prompts us to action. Like a phone beeping notification that prompts you to check Facebook, Instagram, twitter, and emails. A pop-up on your computer. It could be a small talk by your colleague that leads to an hour conversation when you should be working.\n\nSee that I have used mobile phones in both examples, this is to show that it can be a response in one case and a trigger in another. A very important distinction to be aware of. Which is why getting rid of your phone is not always the solution to getting rid of distraction. The first and probably most important step is understanding your distraction, what it is and where it comes from.\n\nWhen we are triggered, oftentimes, our dominant instinct is to succumb by reacting to the trigger prompt. For example, we pick up our phone, then do an hour of twitter and Instagram or whatever your go-to social media app is. So, it‚Äôs easy to think or assume that our phone, our smart devices are the distraction or the root cause of our distractions. Although an overuse of these devices can increase the agitation of our mind ‚Äì Distraction. But often, it is a result of the fact that we are already distracted. It‚Äôs often a symptom than a cause.\n\nThis is brilliantly explained by Nir Eyal in his book Indistractable, where he describes that;\n\nUnless we deal with the root cause of our distraction, we‚Äôll continue to find ways to distract ourselves. Distraction as it turns out isn‚Äôt about the distraction itself; rather it‚Äôs about how we respond to it.\n\nMost people don‚Äôt want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.\n\nThe first person I heard strongly expressing this view was Gary Vee. Though it was first unclear and hard to accept as a fact but thought he might have some good points so listened and gave it more thoughts. But Nir Eyal breaks it down in a simple to understand and pretty convincing way.\n\nAlthough excessive use of phone and smart devices can increase the agitation of our mind, they are more of the result of our already distracted minds than the cause. At the root, our mobile phones are not always the cause of our distractions, but it might be a way to escape it.\n\nThe problem is deeper than tech, Being Indistractable isn‚Äôt about being a luddite it‚Äôs about understanding the real why we do the things against our best interest.\n\nNir shows that fundamentally our drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior while everything else is a proximate cause.\n\nHe uses the game of pool or snooker as a perfect analogy for the difference between root cause and proximate cause.\n\nConsider the game of pool. What do you think makes the ball go into the pockets? Is it the white cue ball, the stick, or the player‚Äôs actions? We understand that while the white cue ball and stick are necessary, the root cause is the player. The white cue ball and stick aren‚Äôt the root causes; they are the proximate causes of the resulting event.\n\nThe distractions in our lives are the result of the same forces ‚Äì they are proximate causes that we think are to blame, while the root causes stay hidden. We tend to blame things like television, junk food, social media, cigarettes, and video games ‚Äì but these are all proximate causes of our distraction.\n\nBoth external and internal triggers are not always bad, nor do they always lead to distractions. But how we respond to them and what they prompt us to do is important. If a trigger is not leading us in the direction we want to be headed, then that is obviously not a good trigger. Viewing triggers as tools that lead us in the direction we want, changes our response to them.\n\nFor example, when the timer on my phone goes off and starts beeping regardless of my phone profile, then I know it‚Äôs time to take out the Banana bread from the oven or get out of bed. Now imagine getting a similar beep or ping every time you get an email or a WhatsApp message. The prompt says Hey, you have a message, and you should check it now. Knowing that following through on that prompt now or every few minutes you have a notification on your phone will keep you distracted and away from something else you should be doing.\n\nTherefore, we can learn to make our devices serve us better for example by turning off notifications. Most phones and smart devices now come with controls that allow you to turn off notifications and get less prompt from them. On your phone you can easily go into the settings and disable notification pop-ups. This can also be done for specific apps. When you plan on working, you can also switch your phone to a silent mode, so your workflow does not get interrupted.\n\nImagine that your phone beeps or vibrates every time you get a WhatsApp message or an email. I bet you can barely get any focused work done this way. Disabling your notification helps you to check your phone only when you want to and not when your phone wants you to. This can also help you check or reduce the number of times you check your phone therefore reducing the time you spend on your device.\n\nWhen you decide to lower the rate of your phone use it might take some days or weeks to adjust down into a new lower level of stimulation, but you will slowly get used to it and a few things are likely to happen. An obvious one is that your stimulation and the internal agitation of your mind will be reduced, you are more likely to get fresh ideas and your attention span may even improve significantly.\n\nWe often think that our brains are distracted but actually it is a symptom of a deeper problem which is the root cause of our distraction. It is not that we are distracted but it is that our brains are over stimulated. And for some reason we crave this distraction in the first place. Our brain loves it and even rewards us for seeking them and finding distraction in the first place. The tiny little nuggets of information, binging social media, and bits of stimulating online contents such as reading the news, a tweeter thread or even an article.\n\nUnderstanding that this is what happens when we are distracted helps us to be more self-aware and device effective means to combat it.\n\nHaving understood what distraction is. Plan your day by prioritizing your activities. To have a more efficient focused session, use the pomodoro technique where you work a relatively short period of time, say thirty minutes, and take a Five-minute break and work another thirty minutes. In this period, you are not allowed to use your phone or even have it in your view nor access any device not used for studying or your focused work.\n\nBy understanding that overstimulation is the enemy of focus, we can properly channel our attention to reducing the level and frequency of our stimulation.\n\nThere is an email trick I read a long time ago and it‚Äôs something like this, if you send less emails you tend to receive less emails. Look at it from another view, in an email conversation, someone eventually ends the conversation by not replying back (usually because there is nothing else to reply to). The point though is often time if you don‚Äôt send a message there won‚Äôt be a reply to it.\n\nHere is one illustration and I understand the tendency to have this misunderstood, but I hope you won‚Äôt. Intentionally or unintentionally, you set expectations with people you communicate with regardless of the channel, could be email, WhatsApp, SMS, or on Facebook messenger. But since we all have mobile phones now and have access to them almost every time, there is this expectation that you should always be reachable or available without considering your convenience.\n\nLet‚Äôs say you constantly reply to your WhatsApp messages within every few minutes (which would be mind-bugging). Every time someone sends you a message there is that expectation that a reply will be given within that time frame. Or let‚Äôs say you usually reply to your emails within the hour. When someone emails you, subconsciously they expect a reply within the hour (Which can be a good thing, especially for work).\n\nBut if you get serious about cutting down your phone usage, then you‚Äôll most likely have slotted time of the day where you read these messages and then reply. Or at least you‚Äôll be on your phone less and probably not see these messages to reply within that short period of time.\n\nIn the past these expectations used to be different and to reduce your overstimulation and perhaps excessive use of your mobile device it can help to recalibrate these expectations."
