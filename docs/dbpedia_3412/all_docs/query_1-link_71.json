In particular, we are interested in social influences and consequences of early individual differences in ‘theory of mind’ (the awareness of one’s own and others’ thoughts, feelings, etc.) and in executive functions (the higher order processes that underpin flexible, goal-directed behaviour).\n\nIf you would like to take part in our study looking at the impact of COVID-19 on families around the world, then please follow this link.\n\nTeam members, past & present\n\nHead of Group:\n\nProfessor Claire Hughes\n\nCurrent PhD Students:\n\nDrJean Heng, Helen Dolling & Mishika Mehrotra.\n\nVisiting Lecturer\n\nDr Robbie Duschinsky\n\nFormer team members:\n\nDr Amanda Aldercotte, Emma Aldred, Sasha Carrington, Sana Chughtai, Dr Hana D'Souza, Dr Nikhil Darshane, Dr Caoimhe Dempsey, Dr Rory Devine,Dr Keya Elie, Dr Rosie Ensor, Izzy Erlewyn-Lajeunesse, Kathryn Farrell, Dr Elian Fink, Dr Sarah Foley, Dr Sam Friedman, Alba Galindo-Gonzalez, Dr Nao Fujita, Mina Gedikoglu, Louise Gray, Dr Martha Hart, Beth Ketteringham, Dr Jennifer Landt, Dr Alex Marks, Dr Gabby McHarg, Dr Adelle Pushparatnam, Dr Gabriela Roman, Amber Snary, Shira Webb, Dr Naomi White, Dr Keri Wong, Dr Chengyi Xu.\n\nResearch Projects\n\nThe 'Ready Or Not' project: School Readiness - Connecting Viewpoints on Child and Family Wellbeing and Identifying Commonalities Across Diverse Groups\n\nNow more than ever, it is important to understand the links between academic success and children’s socio-emotional wellbeing. The Ready or Not, Here We Come! study is led my Professor Claire Hughes, in collaberation with Dr Rory Devine (University of Birmingham), Dr Hana D'Souza (Cardiff University) and Dr Elian Fink (University of Sussex). The study is funded by the ESRC. Our overarching aim is to elucidate the conceptual and developmental links between school-readiness, well-being and children's close relationships, with a view to enhancing support for children at risk of struggling in the early school years. We hope that this work will highlight children’s social relationships within Early Years education policies. Full details of what the study involves for both parents and teachers can be found on the following pages of this website.\n\nThe New Fathers and Mothers Study (New FAMS) and the Baby Talk Study\n\nThe New FAMS is a large international study of first-time expectant fathers and mothers investigating the transition into parenthood and early family influences on infant development, such as self-control and social interaction. The study is led by Professor Claire Hughes, in collaboration with Professor Clancy Blair in New York and Professor Judi Mesman in the Netherlands. The study is funded by the ESRC in the UK, the NSF in the USA and the NWO in the Netherlands. Across the three sites, there are a total of roughly 450 participating couples (230 in the UK and 110 from the other two sites). In the first phase of the study, at around the third trimester, each expectant parent completes a face-to-face interview and an online questionnaire about their relationship, well-being and expectations of parenthood. In addition, expectant parents provide saliva samples for the measurement of the hormone cortisol in order to investigate both expectant parents’ physiological response to stresses associated with the final stages of pregnancy. In the second phase of the study, couples are followed-up when their baby reaches 4 months of age. Home visits include observations of fathers and mothers interacting with their baby during play and ecological measures of infant attention, concentration and social interaction. At this phase, parents also complete an online questionnaire about their relationship and well-being and a short face-to-face interview about their baby’s behaviour and their experiences of being a parent. For the third and then final phases of the study, when the babies are 14 and 24 months old, respectively, fathers and mothers are again observed at home interacting with their baby during structured and unstructured play and everyday activities. Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires about their relationship and well-being and their baby’s behaviour.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Centre for Family Research, the NewFAMS team made two short videos. The first of these was designed to capture the voices of parents (including some from the NewFAMS), talking about their ‘journeys to parenthood’: where did it start, and what would they advise others to pack for this all-important journey? To find out, click here.\n\nThe second video describes a key focus of the NewFAMS study, the development of self-control. Why does it matter and how can we assess very early individual differences in children’s self-control? To find out, click here.\n\nTogether with Dr Elian Fink, Professor Hughes received a ‘Seed for Science’ grant from the Wellcome Trust to extend the New FAMS by adding the latest technological innovations to the 4-month home visits. Using a small ‘talk pedometer’ which is enclosed within a vest worn by the baby, parental baby talk will be recorded in order to explore the different interactions babies receive in a typical day. In addition to asking couples from the New FAMS to take part, this study extension aims to recruit couples whose infants have spent time on a neonatal intensive care unit with the intention of assessing whether and how this stay affects early family relationships.\n\nRelevant team publications\n\nBranger M.C.E., Emmen R.A.G., Woudstra M.-L.J., Alink L.R.A., Mesman J., & NewFAMS team.

The main aim was to develop a simple but reliable questionnaire for teachers to assess how well children are making the transition to school. This questionnaire, the Brief Early Skills & Support Index (or BESSI) has been developed and validated for reception and nursery children. Most of this research has been based in the Wirral and Liverpool City Region. The team are currently working on a study, launched by the Liverpool City Region Child Poverty Action and Life Chances Commission to track 9,000 children across four time-points across a 24-month period.\n\nPast and present members of the 'Ready Steady Go' team include Prof. Claire Hughes, Dr Irenee Daly, Dr Rory Devine, Dr Michelle Ellefson, Dr Sarah Foley, Dr Juliet Foster, Mr Dominic Kelly and Dr Naomi White,.\n\nUsing the BESSI\n\nWe are very happy for teachers, researchers and other professionals working with nursery- and reception-aged children to use the BESSI, but would appreciate hearing about this work. Copies of the BESSI can be downloaded using the links below along with a coding manual, which provides information about using and scoring the questionnaire. If you have any questions about the BESSI please contact Prof. Claire Hughes.\n\nRelevant team publications\n\nHughes, C. (2015). The transition to school.

Originally, this study was designed as a prequel to an earlier study of ‘hard to manage’ pre-schoolers that Claire Hughes had conducted in London (together with Judy Dunn) at the Institute of Psychiatry. In this prior study, the ‘hard to manage’ group presented a myriad of problems - in their cognitive skills, in their interactions with peers and in their relationships at home. One goal for the Toddlers Up study was therefore to address the problem of ‘chicken and egg’ by recruiting children at an earlier age, and examining early predictive relationships between children’s family interactions and their performance on tests of theory of mind and executive function. A second goal was to assess whether performance on these tasks could predict how well children get along with peers at school. More recently, we have been combining these two questions to examine family and cognitive predictors of adjustment in pre-teens.\n\nSo far, the Toddlers Up study has led to the publication of 17 journal articles, several chapters and a book titled Social Understanding, Social Lives (Hughes, 2011), which won the 2013 British Psychological Society Book Prize - Academic Monograph.\n\nSocial Understanding, Social Lives\n\nPublications from the Toddlers Up study - organised by general topic\n\nFamily influences on children’s cognitive and social development\n\nEnsor, R., & Hughes, C.

It is funded by the ESRC, the Hong Kong Research Council and the University of Cambridge Isaac Newton Trust. The main aim of the study is to find out whether the delay that previous studies have reported in Hong Kong pre-schoolers’ understanding of mind (e.g. Liu et al. 2008) is also evident among school-aged children, or in pre-schoolers given non-verbal tasks. A related aim is to examine how within-group variation in performance on tests of theory of mind and executive function is related to variation in parent-child interactions, recorded during lab-based play sessions in each country. The UK team for the In Mind project includes Prof. Claire Hughes, Dr Rory Devine and Ms Annabel Amodia-Bidakowska.\n\nThis study has led to a set of groundbreaking findings regarding parental ‘mind-mindedness’ (the ability to view children as independent agents with their own thoughts and feelings). Specifically, this study showed parallel UK-Hong Kong contrasts (favouring the UK) in (a) young children’s understanding of false belief and (b) parental mind-mindedness, with the difference in parental mind-mindedness explaining the contrast in children’s false belief understanding. These findings are striking in that they suggest that mind-mindedness may have a culturally universal importance for children’s early socio-cognitive development.

There have been many claims made for the benefits of pets (or, more properly, ‘companion animals’) for children’s social development, but few of these claims have been properly tested. By integrating this project with the Toddlers Up study we have been able to avoid the problem of selection effects (in that the sample have been taking part in the Toddlers Up project much longer than our interest in the animals in their homes). By asking questions about pets as part of the Life History Interview, we hope to get a rich and accurate picture of the importance of pets for this sample. By gathering information from mothers, study children and siblings, we are also able to examine whether different family members have different views on the role of pets within the family. The team for this project includes Prof Claire Hughes, Dr Sarah Foley and Dr Sandra McCune of the Waltham Trust.\n\nRelevant team publications:\n\nCassels, M.T., White, N., Gee, N., Hughes, C.
