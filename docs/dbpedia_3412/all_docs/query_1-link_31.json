Ahh, how pleasant it was the sorrow I felt when I lost my mother. It was so delicious. That joy... And when that day had arrived... The day that humans showed their fangs to us and put my race to the sword... Ahh, I understand. It can be done this way as well. Bringing sorrow, despair and sadness to other people. Unforgivable. Absolutely unforgivable. Humans. You all started this. So I'm not one to blame. Daring to destroy our village, killing our friends so cruelly. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to retaliate. Thank you for giving me a reason for slaughtering you. I want revenge. Thank you for giving me a motive for revenge. I will change this world. T͏h̢aǹk̀ ͠yo͞u for ̸makìng me ͠a ̶v͢i͟ct̸i̶m͡. „ ~ Westcott thanking humans for giving him a reason for revenge.\n\n“ Ahh... so that's your question. My goal. It's for the sake of creating a new world. Maybe you have already heard this from Elliot, but we are descendents from genuine Mages unlike those artificial magicians (Wizard). At one time, by the hand of people afraid of our power, our hometown was burned down and our compatriots tortured, beaten and killed. We were peaceful but they started it. So I will rewrite this world with the neighboring world of Deus. In order to have vengeance on the human race that exterminated our innocent families. Men, women, children and infants. Every human in this reality will suffer in despair and die, be they millions of billions. Is that easy enough to convince you? According to one theory, the first two types of emotions people experience can be distinguished between pleasant and unpleasant. Through growth, human emotions become differentiated into all sort of different feelings……but no matter what, every emotion basically can be characterized as pleasant or unpleasant, people favor pleasure and dislike discomfort. Actually, the reasoning behind that is not an exaggeration. For instance, people who derive pleasure for social status tend to place more effort in work. Or people who regarded it pleasant to be loved by others tend to give more soothing offerings. My position is only slightly different from others. Nothing more, nothing less. There's nothing changed after that. I am making as much effort as possible for the sake of my curiosity and goals. ──Itsuka Shidou. Have you ever spent money looking for a toy? Have you ever tidy up your appearance before searching for love? It's no different from that. ──In that sense, I am a very ordinary person. „ ~ Westcott stating his desires in the most twisted way possible.\n\n“ Westcott: (maniacal laughter)\n\nEllen: Ike! What is this?!\n\nWestcott: It is the Kingdom, Ellen! It has inverted! Finally! The time is here! The Demon King has RETURNED! „ ~ Isaac Westcott witnessing the arrival of Inverse Tohka Yatogami in the English dub.\n\nhttps://villains.fandom.com/wiki/File:Date_9_Ingles_(online-audio-converter.com)_(1).ogg\n\nSir Isaac Ray Peram Westcott, originally born as Ike and also simply known as Isaac Ray Peram Westcott, Isaac Westcott and later Second Spirit of Origin is the main antagonist of the Date A Live franchise.\n\nHe was an abnormal and ruthless person yet a worldwide famous British brilliant man who worked as the founder and corrupt managing director of the largest company in the world, Deus.Ex.Machina Industries, a powerful military company that was responsible to arm all nations of the world to wage wars of aggression against the Spirits (all-female beings he created himself) and other political and military oppositions. Westcott was an intelligent, charismatic, composed and seductive man who ruled his company with a fascist iron fist and controlled almost all aspects of life inside of his company and had the entire Europe continent under his thumb. Recorded by history as the most powerful genuine magician who had ever lived, his entire life was the culmination of a half-century plan to destroy the current reality to create a new world by transforming himself into an Inverse Spirit and later in the Spirit of Origin to become a God-like figure. Westcott adopted the concept of supremacy as his aim was to unite \"racially desirable\" mages as comrades, while excluding those deemed either to be non-magicians and humans. In his quest for genocide, he has been controlling the world's nations for 30 years, bringing waves of death and destruction across the globe with wars and terrorist attacks. His ultimate plan was not only make a world for Mages but to utterly annihilate humankind and create a new reality, a Nazi-like realm of Mages where he ruled as the supreme God for all eternity and planned to use every life form in the world as his playthings where he would torture, torment and kill everything and revive them to continue an infinite loop of eternal despair and sorrow, plunging the reality into diabolical torments to satisfy his own ego and twisted desire for pain.\n\nHe is voiced by Ryōtarō Okiayu in the Japanese version of the anime (seasons 2-5), the latter of whom also voiced Scar in Fullmetal Alchemist, Dracula in Castlevania, Lucifer in the Devil Children sub-series of Shin Megami Tensei, including the SMT Devichil anime, Lancelot in Fate series, Hideyoshi Toyomi in Sengoku Basara, and was voiced by Alex Organ in the English dubbed version of season 2, the latter of whom also voiced the Doctor in Black Butler, Shogo Makishima in Psycho-Pass, Kishou Arima in Tokyo Ghoul/:Re, Shota Aizawa in My Hero Academia, Togusa in Ghost in the Shell, Damnatio Kira in Black Clover and Kaku in One Piece. As a child, he is voiced by Mei Fukuda in her first role as a villain. In the season 3 (2019) and onwards, he is voiced by Christopher Wehkamp.\n\nDescription\n\nIsaac Westcott is the sinister director and founder of DEM Industries, a military company with a hidden agenda: assisting Westcott in his study of Spirits and his ultimate goal of becoming an Inverse Spirit to rewrite reality.\n\nWhile he often cites revenge against mankind for the extinction of his people, his true motivations are rooted in his abnormal behavior and obsession with negative emotions. As one of the most malevolent mages known, Westcott harbors a deep fascination with death, viewing it as a source of despair, sadness, and sorrow—the emotions he finds most pleasurable. Whether inflicting despair upon others or reveling in his own suffering, he derives twisted enjoyment from the pain of others and even himself.\n\nWestcott's sadomasochistic tendencies are evident in his willingness to form friendships only to witness the inevitable deaths of those close to him, relishing in their suffering. He harbors a diabolical ambition to exterminate and enslave humanity, replacing the existing civilization with a totalitarian regime where mages reign supreme and mankind is persecuted, enslaved, and ultimately eradicated. In truth, his objectives are nothing more than the utter destruction, chaos and death all over the world to satisfy his need to watch despair and agony, so he can feel the joy of being 'alive'.\n\nIn-Universe, while many villains justify their actions as necessary evils for the greater good, Westcott's malevolence is driven purely by his own free will and desire for power. He sees himself not as a villain but as a hero, viewing all humans as inherently evil and deserving of destruction, regardless of race or age. This warped sense of righteousness allows him to justify his heinous crimes, making him all the more dangerous.\n\nAppearance\n\nWhile it was unknown for a while, the very first novels implied he was around 30 years old, but it was later revealed that he is a man of 49 years old.\n\nIsaac Westcott cuts a striking figure, standing tall with smooth, long ash blonde or white hair cascading around his sharp features. His piercing dark blue eyes seem to pierce through those who meet his gaze, adding to his intimidating presence. Always clad in a sleek black suit, complete with polished shoes, trousers, and a crisp white tie, he exudes an aura of authority and menace. Despite his appearance, which is later revealed to be 49, Westcott maintains a youthful appearance, leading some to speculate that he may be using magic or Magi-Tech to preserve his looks. Origami notes that despite his appearance, he carries himself like a seasoned veteran, suggesting a depth of experience beyond his years.\n\nAfter his fight against Woodman, Westcott had one of his arms severed in the conflict and is currently undergoing Realizer treatment to restore it, possibly giving him several scars.\n\nPersonality\n\nPast Personality\n\n“ Although he could not understand what Ike was thinking at the time as his face was illuminated by the fire, Elliot felt something resembling an uneasy sensation coming from him on that day. Although magicians were viewed as heresy among mankind, even among them it had felt like he had become a completely different type of creature. „ ~ The author describing the corruption of Ike.\n\nWestcott's descent into darkness was a gradual one, beginning with a childhood marked by kindness and intelligence. He was once a charismatic and gentle boy, known for his willingness to support others and his aptitude for magic. Despite his natural talent, he showed compassion towards those less skilled, encouraging them to pursue their dreams without succumbing to rigid rules.\n\nHowever, beneath his affable exterior lay a twisted perspective on life and death. The loss of his beloved pet sparked a fascination with suffering, leading him to derive pleasure from his own sorrow. Tragically, this obsession deepened when he witnessed his mother's death, finding joy in the negative emotions it evoked. As he grappled with the cruelty of the world, he became disillusioned with humanity, viewing them as barbaric and dangerous.\n\nHis worldview shifted dramatically after being adopted by a British couple, his ambition fueled by a desire for power and control. This ambition ultimately drove him to commit unspeakable acts, including the murder of his own parents to further his agenda. As he delved deeper into the realm of magic and the supernatural, his mind became warped by the allure of godlike power.\n\nThe discovery of the Spirits and their Sephirah Crystals only served to exacerbate his descent into darkness. Seeing their immense power as a means to reshape the world according to his own twisted vision, he abandoned any semblance of morality or empathy. Manipulative and ruthless, he saw those around him as mere pawns in his quest for dominance, caring only for his own ambitions and viewing humanity as expendable.\n\nDespite his tragic origins, Westcott's transformation into a villain of unparalleled cruelty was driven by his own choices and desires. His path serves as a cautionary tale of how unchecked ambition and obsession can lead even the most promising individuals down a dark and destructive path.\n\nCurrent Personality\n\n“ Heard that, Shido feel the Spirits taking their breath. Shido feel the incongruous feeling from Westcott since from the day he first met him. He feel that this feeling is expanding. Westcott's nature could not be described in just cruel or brutal but rather 'abnormal'. The truth of the vague fear he feel from Westcott is not a fear towards someone with power, but rather towards someone without compassion, kindness and without a shred of humanity. „ ~ The author on Sir Isaac Westcott.\n\nThrough his own nature, Westcott seemed to be \"sorrow\" incarnate. He insistently made clear to Shido Itsuka and his enemies, however, that he did not believe himself to be evil, but simply beyond common morality. He was instinctively treacherous, betraying and killing numerous beings who trusted him as he showed no empathy for humans, a race that was under his command in DEM. Since his youth, Westcott was a natural genius and showed that he was patient, sarcastic, arrogant, vastly intelligent, and an incredible actor and cunning person as he could manipulate the entire globe according to his desire.\n\nWestcott is an intelligent man who often addresses most of his subordinates by their surnames (except Ellen Mira Mathers whom he called her name often in a teasing tone). He is also a man who does not speak too much so he quickly tries to end conversations with less important people. He rarely shows any sign of alarm, surprise, or anguish and is always shown smiling. In normal situations, Westcott is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking, primarily among the directors of the D.E.M that are part of the board of D.E.M except for Ellen who he has a special relationship. Westcott is also a kind of person who does not like to repeat the same thing twice, considering his words to be superior and unique among billions. Due to the power that he has over his officers and other employees on D.E.M Industries, he is very selfish and cares only about his own well-being. Isaac Westcott brutally tortures his directors and officers if they question his orders regardless of whether if they are elite soldiers or not; which is why Westcott often install Realizers in the brains of his soldiers in order to make them into \"domesticated-psychopaths\" so he doesn't need to worry with small rebel cells rising in DEM. Under normal circumstances, he becomes honest and thoughtful towards his subordinates (for beginners who do not know his true nature, people like Barton).\n\nHe is also a very twisted and callous man who seems to take pleasure and joy in the worst possible types of torture, such when he considered various types of cruel physical, mental, emotional, and sexual tortures to Tohka that only the most twisted of individuals could think of. The definition of Westcott is a complete and utter obsession with revenge, death, sorrow, genocide, and greed with the powers of the Spirits' Inverse Form. By his own admission, he loves all kinds of pain and despair that mankind can evoke over the world as he has a strange and bizarre fetish for despair and death, considering it to be the best emotion he can feel and inflict in other people. He clearly shows that he hates any form of pacifism and believes kindness will accomplish nothing but defeat and claims that sacrifices are necessary for the \"greater good\". This was later shown during Murdoch's events when he refused to kill Murdoch because he has the potential to become unfettered revolutionary; a magisterial dictator with strong ambitions. While he says \"will be for humanity's greater good\" the people under his command will follow Westcott blindly because of his great authority and experience as a veteran, and all of them are able to kill thousands of innocent civilians as long Isaac says this is correct. In a narrative sense, Isaac's unfettered and violent personality that is deeply inspired in revolutionary dictators of real-life like Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, serves as a counter to the easygoing, peaceful, and gentle personalities of Shido and Elliot that believes peace and equality is born from love and harmony and not from power and oppression.\n\nHe also seems to have a one-sided view on many things as he claims Elliot Woodman betrayed a vow he made with him after he left the DEM. He even asked Elliot to come back to the D.E.M and saw Elliot's actions as a childish person throwing a temper tantrum. He frequently appears to play with his underlings for amusement such as playing rude and sarcastic jokes but at times he needs to use extreme and scary jokes to put fear in some members and soldiers of the D.E.M. to keep them line as he needs his private army at all costs to fight Ratatoskr in a future war of large scale. Being the director D.E.M. Industries, Westcott controls his minions through acquiring their respect by fear and holds the most rambunctious and turbulent individuals like Roger Murdoch in line through intimidation and mind games.\n\nIsaac is also rather merciless and uncharitable, so he reacts violently to criticism. He tends to view most problems and situations in an extremely perspicacious manner, like an academic or a professor, rather than as a manner of life or death. Believing no force in the world could challenge his authority since he is the director of the greatest corporation on Earth, he typically underestimates his foes for being pacifists and adds their kindness ends up generating in their defeat. Ultimately, Isaac could also be viewed as yet another example of a Machiavellian inspired ruler, with ruthless determination to kill everyone on his way. But unlike Machiavellian who is a tyrannical ruler, Isaac is president of a company but he is seen more like an undemocratic dictator oppressing people in the shadows. And unlike tyrants who seek for more power—Isaac plans to seek more death on humans to get his vengeance of all mankind for bringing death to his people. Many of Isaac's beliefs run consistent with nihilism, as he does not see any meaning to life, be the lives of his friends, family, subordinates, enemies and even his own. He sees his actions as a game, even if said game results in the loss of lives, his very own included.\n\nHe often says things to incite someone's temper but then says he is just kidding. Isaac enjoys irritating Ellen to a troll level, and he has a great deal of fun in being feared by other officers as well. On the outside, Isaac acts empathetic and charming, however, he keeps many secrets and tells many lies to the whole planet, such as the origin of the Spirits. He is also very strategic and shrewd and enjoys manipulating battles in order to make his own allies and enemies kill themselves. He immensely enjoys crushing the hopes of humans and watching their expressions become filled with despair as see in Tohka's inversion experiment when Tohka and Shido's love failed. Despite all his cruelty, he insistently made clear to Ratatoskr, that he is not \"evil\", but simply beyond common morality (like aforementioned), calling evil \"the humans who oppose him\" as he believes himself to be the most righteous person in the world as he has enough reasons to exterminate mankind.\n\nHe was similarly quiet bloodthirsty as well and frequently reveled in combat to the point of laughing while he fought or killed. He was also noted for his lack of forgiveness, but when something \"bad\" happens inside of his company that goes according to his plan, he is willing to congratulate the individuals with vacation and salary increase as if they had done something good.\n\nAt first, Westcott wanted to create a world without humans where mages will rule in peace but over the course of the years, Westcott began to take his desire for peace too far and decided he was the only one who should rule the world to guide it a new era. When he summoned the Spirits, Westcott decided to use the event to his advantage, by creating the belief that they are alien-monsters made to destroy mankind, in order to give the world an enemy to direct their hatred against. Using this threat, his company sold many weapons to all police forces and military of the world to rise against those \"evil beings\", turning the DEM into the most influential corporation of the world.\n\nWestcott is also a deeply misanthropic man who tries to convince all nations that his evil deeds are justified because they are for greater good of the world, though he is an atrocious, cruel, prejudiced, sinister, vicious, and brutal businessman who uses his place in power to meet his own extreme ends, even employing mercenaries, terrorists, psychopaths and rapists like Minerva Liddell and Jessica Bailey to enforce his interpretation of humanity's will while posing them as \"soldiers\". This makes him feared and reviled throughout the world as shown in Japan Ground Self Defense's HQ where the military officers showed fear towards him as he is one of the most important figures of the world. Westcott is especially determined to eliminate all humans scattered everywhere after using their resources, help and all support that all nations of the world used to rise him to power, showing that in the end, no matter how useful his human minions were, he will always abandon them to die simply because they are non-mages. However, despite being a highly dangerous and violent man, he thinks himself superior and even purer than most of the people as he sees himself as the \"savior\" of the world while considering all humans as \"monsters\". Westcott has shown to be haughty and self-assuming. He has also been shown to have somewhat of a god-complex, like for example, believing that he should \"destroy the world and create a new one\" if the current one does not operate in the way he wants it to.\n\nDespite his single-mindedness, Westcott's true weakness was his arrogance that leads him to many defeats at the hands of Ratatoskr, Asgard Electronics, and the Spirits. His pride over his army and Wizards lead him to believe Ratatoskr was a group of \"greenhorns\" that could do nothing against him as they use peaceful methods to achieve their goals. Soon, when he thought he could simply invade their base with a small squad of Bandersnatch and Wizards and win, he got severely wounded by his old friend, Elliot Baldwin Woodman, for overestimating his soldiers. However, Westcott also states he fears Elliot as he was once a powerful Wizard. During their battle, Westcott mentioned he was shaking in fear when he was about to fight Elliot in a battle where Westcott loses one of his arms. After this incident, Westcott stopped underestimating his enemies and considered them all as threats to the point of moving all his army to defeat them.\n\nWhile very abusive and cruel even towards his loved ones (mostly Elliot who is his arch-enemy), Westcott is, in fact, capable of affection and love people like an ordinary person; however, this only fuels his depravity and his sadomasochism that allows him to feel joy in the pain of others and even his own. Westcott was able to show affection for people close to him but it was in fact only to get attached to them and later watch them die or suffer; only to get \"aroused\". This seems to apply even to his pet dog since he got another pet after his previous best friend died. It was later revealed that he only got a new pet because he wanted to love it, only to watch it die later so he could feel sorrow and sadness (joy and pleasure) from its death. Because hurting people (and even animals) close to him will cause him greater despair, he tends to deal with them in more personal ways; for instance, he personally made his last moment to be emotional just so he could see the faces of Ellen, Elliot and Karen twisted with sorrow, giving him one last moment of pain-induced pleasure.\n\nIn later volumes, it was revealed that Westcott genuinely loved his family and friends, which is why he deliberately made them survive only to back-stab them later so he could feel \"happiness\" and \"sadness\" from betraying his friends as they watched him destroying their world. The more he loves someone, the more he wants to treasure and revel in their despair, which is why he set up his own friends to experience despair by his own hand. Following the reveal of his genius nature, it can be inferred that Westcott's obsessions are ironically fueled by his great intelligent nature, predict and empathize with people around him. By a degree, his intellectual nature made him above morals and senses of ethic. He most likely understands the consequences of his actions and the exact level of suffering his plans will inflict (in his enemies and even in himself) but this only encourages him by filling his with pain over his own monstrous acts that took the lives of millions and attempted billions. As a result of this, Westcott actually manages to escape classification as a true sociopath, since they are defined by a complete inability to form emotional connections with others. As such, Westcott is not a psychopath as he is capable of love and form friendly relationships with other people despite being pure evil. And despite his twisted sense of emotional masochism and inverted point of view of life and death, he is not a mentally ill person, but, an ordinary person with a mentality superior to normal humans.\n\nWhat makes Westcott unique among many other completely irredeemable villains (something that makes him much worse than anyone else), is his sanity and mental control. Unlike some purely evil villains, Westcott is in fact completely sane, can think rationally, knows exactly the difference between good and evil, has the ability to feel all positive and negative emotions, behave in a normal and rational manner of a civilian and has excellent mental health. The only thing that turns Westcott into a twisted man is his sadomasochism, but aside from that Westcott is purely sane and can actually think like any normal person. His sanity goes from being able to feel sorrow for loved ones, feel bad for the people he hurts, form bonds and friendship with other people born from genuine love and care, be gentle with his subordinates, forgive mistakes of his allies, be honest and straight with his friends (without hiding his true intentions behind lies), be extremely patient person, be a joyful person who can share happiness with Ellen and his friends, be caring and nice to his family, be a humble person towards strange people and is even capable of loving animals.\n\nHowever, likewise, Westcott can present signs of a cruel person, being able to feel and express everything that a heartless man can. Everything that he actually has is nothing more than a \"preparation\" for his pain-inducing pleasure, where he will feel the ultimate joy of despair and sorrow. Losing a friend via natural circumstances is something that leaves a greater impact on his heart as it was something unexpected. He can live among society like a gentleman and civilized man but when a tragedy happens, he will feel hopeless and down, which are something that will also give him pleasure and joy from suffering mentally. Basically, every positive quality he had turned into nothing more than grace for him to finally experiences the joy and fun of losing someone (or something) he loved dearly. When he causes the death of suffering of another person, he can clearly see what he is doing is wrong but the despair and panic from his victims give him happiness via his remorse for causing mayhem and making people miserable. In a sense, Westcott can feel remorse for his actions but his remorse only leave him excited and aroused.\n\nUsing this, the author gave Westcott many redeeming moments that would cause the reader to feel sympathy for the character, which only makes him even worse as he continued to use all his sympathetic moments to drive himself into a diversion. Showing that no matter how many redeeming and lighthearted moments are given to Westcott, he will use them to play with his good emotions and convert them into cruelty and inhumanity.\n\nAt times Westcott can also be very childish. Both Ellen and Karen admit that his actions with his newly acquired Demon King resemble a mischievous kid playing with a new toy. Isaac Westcott also shows on screen that he is laughably evil at times when is played for laughs in his misfortunes with Ellen.\n\n\"Yandere\" Love for Mio\n\n“ Westcott: Deus. Hah. What an absolute gorgeous substitution you are. Even though for me, I just want to delete Itsuka Shidou right now.\n\nMio: Surely, both of us will not exist in the future world as of now. Neither you, nor I.───Isn't the moment just so riped? I can deal with all the nuisances all at once.\n\nWestcott: Hah, hah, hah! Where? Where was I always wrong? Even when I have excavated the secrets of Magic, and got my hands on the Spirit Formula. Even when I have created the Realizer. Even now, I'm holding the power of the Spirit of Origins in my hands!\n\nMio: From the beginning, I (Spirit) should not have been born. The same goes for the Realizer. This power, is too far beyond human capacity. But, ah───right, other than that, if this is also the cause of your misery───You, were never my favorite person. I never loved you. I hate you so much.\n\nWestcott: Hahahahahahaha! I see, I see.... Then there is no other way. Qemetiel! „ ~ Mio rejecting Westcott's indirect confession.\n\nIn his interactions with Mio Takamiya, Westcott's demeanor takes on a perplexing duality. On the surface, he presents himself as charming and affectionate, showering her with adoration and endearments, such as referring to her as Deus (God) due to her captivating beauty and formidable power. Yet, beneath this facade lies a darker aspect of his personality—ruthless, calculating, and utterly devoid of mercy.\n\nWestcott's professed love for Mio serves as a guise for his insatiable obsession with her power and allure. His thoughts are consumed by her, his desires fixated on possessing her for himself. He is willing to go to extreme lengths, even resorting to violence and manipulation, to ensure that she remains within his grasp. This is exemplified by his callous actions, such as the cold-blooded murder of Shinji, Mio's first love, in a bid to eliminate any obstacles in his goal to keep her for himself. Even in the present days, Westcott still harbors hostility against Shido for being the reincarnation of the one that stole Mio from him─even claiming that he desires nothing but 'delete' Shido from existence.\n\nWhile Westcott claims his actions are driven by a desire to bring happiness to Mio, it becomes evident that his version of love is tainted by a desire for control and dominance. His insistence that they are kindred spirits, both longing for something of their own, serves as a twisted justification for his predatory behavior. He addresses Mio with affectionate terms, yet the underlying tone carries a sinister edge, hinting at the depths of his possessiveness. When faced with rejection from Mio, Westcott's reaction is one of vindictive jealously under the veil of revenge against Shinji. His sense of betrayal fuels a desire for vengeance, manifesting in a chilling determination to eradicate anyone who stands in the way of his desires. His love, far from being a redeeming quality, becomes a catalyst for his descent into depravity, culminating in a disturbing ultimatum that threatens the annihilation of all Spirits and the world at large.\n\nIn essence, Westcott's purported love for Mio is revealed to be a twisted distortion of genuine affection, serving as a tool for his own selfish ends rather than a source of true compassion.\n\nAs Kaguya Yamai\n\n“ My true wish? To dismantle this world. Why? For the fun of it. Anger. Sorrow. Despair. Nothing else gives me the same kick. They're my pleasure and joy. I want to watch the residents of some inconsequential world be torn apart... That's all. That's right! This Spirit amalgam's falling apart the seams! Can you believe the information of just one man made me fall from grace?! You may learn from the true nature of his evil and alien madness! „ ~ Kaguya Ray Peram Westcott describing her goal.\n\nThe Spirit Amalgam of Yamai initially presented herself as a near-perfect imitation of the original Kaguya Yamai. Outgoing and outspoken to the point of seeming childish or immature, she displayed a vehement reaction to criticism and adamantly refused to conform to others' expectations. However, beneath this façade lay a disturbing truth—her behavior was merely an act, meticulously crafted to uphold her perception of what it means to be a Spirit.\n\nUpon revealing her true nature, Kaguya's descent into twisted insanity became evident. She viewed everything through a lens of self-importance, inflicting betrayal for the sheer pleasure of witnessing the anguish it caused. Manipulating others with a callous disregard for their well-being, she reveled in the chaos and destruction she wrought.\n\nKaguya's obsession with war, despair, and destruction knew no bounds. She saw the multiverse as her personal playground, delighting in the prospect of traveling from world to world, leaving a trail of devastation in her wake. Even in moments of personal peril, she found exhilaration in the prospect of suffering and chaos.\n\nNot content with tormenting her enemies alone, Kaguya showed no hesitation in turning on her own allies. Abusive and critical towards her team, she took pleasure in teasing and trolling them, relishing in their fear and discomfort. Her rebellious nature extended even to those in positions of authority, as she brazenly flouted rules and orders without regard for consequences.\n\nIn essence, Kaguya Yamai's twisted psyche and insatiable thirst for destruction marked her as a truly malevolent force, capable of causing untold suffering and chaos without remorse.\n\nAuthor's Official Description\n\n“ Elliot: Perhaps that may be right on the mark. Ike was always steadfast, though that might be why he's such a treacherous person. Think about it. What'd happen if he were to wait inside a room full of nuclear warheads button with only curiosity plaguing his exuberant mind?\n\nKaren: I couldn't imagine how dreadful that'd be. He's literally a psychopath. „ ~ Elliot Baldwin Woodman and Karen Nora Mathers about Westcott.\n\nThe twisted managing director of Deus.Ex.Machina Industries. He is around 30 years old and a tall man with dark ash blond hair and sharp eyes. He seems to know more than he lets on, such as the knowledge of Tohka's transformed state, as well as Shido's past. All of DEM's elite wizards refer to him with -sama, fanatically loyal, and willing to do terrible acts just because he said so. Considering Mana's amnesia before she joined DEM, headaches whenever she tries to remember the past, and respect for Westcott even after finding out what was done to her there is a possibility that brainwashing, conditioning, and/or a Realizer used to make them so loyal to him alone. Such as when Adeptus 3 was hesitant about a mission to capture Tohka that would expose their equipment to the public and create numerous civilian casualties just to slap Ratatoskr's face rather than use a plan to minimize both, such as the original plan on the island where the Yamai twins appeared. Yet she and the others were going ahead with it without reservation simply because Westcott said it would be for \"humanities' greater good.\" Isaac himself has shown little care, much less humanity, in his thinking as long as his goals are realized. Whether it is discussing ways to break Tohka's spirit through torture with the same manner and care one would discuss the weather, or the loss of life and DEM property when Tohka snapped, he never showed any sign or thought of guilt, despair, sorrow or grief, but was happy that she inverted as if nothing else mattered.\n\nWestcott grew up in a town of mages who could use sorcery along with Woodman and Ellen. However, civilians who feared the power of mages scorched their village. This event caused a change in Westcott. This became the first step to the creation of DEM. The trio spent their youths learning everything they could about sorcery, leading to the foundation in creating a Spirit, a being of immense power born from the mana of the world which they could use to achieve their goal. Around the same time, Westcott was adopted by a rich couple, but, ended up dying in an accident, leaving their entire fortune to Westcott. Afterward, he gained a desire to create a utopia, one with only mages living in it.\n\nOther appearances\n\nArs Install\n\nIn the game Ars Install, Westcott is the overarching antagonist manipulating all events behind the scenes. He is the man responsible for creating Marina Arusu, also know as Unknown, alongside with his assistant, Ellen Mira Mathers. Marina Arusu was a sentient-virus (with self-consciousness) by Westcott to watch over Ratatoskr and hack the program of the Fraxinus. He was also nicknamed by Marina; In the Marina route, she called her creator as \"Otoo-san\", from the Japanese means \"Daddy\". Marina shows her loyalty to Isaac in the very end.\n\nRio Reincarnation\n\nHe is mentioned several times by Marina Arusu, who was later revived by Rinne's daughter, Rio Sonogami. Most of his mentions were how love doesn't exist in people without heart. At one point, Marina called Westcott a loveless and heartless man who only cares about his own purposes.\n\nSeha Vs. Dark Tohka\n\nIn the mini Korean-manga adaptation, Westcott appears as the Bigger Bad and the main antagonist. He succeeded in awakening the Demon King in Tohka, however, in this adaptation, he created an artificial Spirit called Seha and forced him to fight to the death with the Demon King.\n\nWhile Seha and Dark Tohka were fighting, millions of people were killed in the process, and the entire city was completely destroyed. Westcott insanely laughed as he watched the fight between Seha and Dark Tohka. Even if the fight between two super-powerful Spirits were killing thousands and thousands of innocent, Westcott saw it only as a bonus for his own amusement. Even Ellen, who was next to him, was disgusted with his attitude.\n\nAfter Seha's defeat, Westcott escapes with Ellen and Dark Tohka, who suffered brainwash thanks to the Realizer he installed in her brain. Soon afterwards, Westcott decided to get rid of all witnesses and order his commander to explode the Realizers of all his Wizards fighting outside of the building, finishing off thousands of his soldiers.\n\nMayuri Judgment Film\n\nIsaac is indirectly mentioned by Kotori in the film when she thought that \"the Giant Ball of Mana\" flying over Tenguu City was his work.\n\nSpirit Pledge\n\nWestcott is set to appear in the 2018 Chinese game, Spirit Pledge, as the overarching antagonist behind all evil forces appearing in the game. Unlike Ellen Mira Mathers, who is a playable character, Westcott will be a non-playable character.\n\nThe story follows the same plot line of the original series, but Westcott seems to have more involvement in the story. In his early actions, Westcott seems to send entire battalions of children from AST to attack the Spirits in public places in suicidal missions.\n\nRen Dystopia\n\nWhile Westcott doesn't appear in the game, the main antagonist Spirit of the game, Ren, states that she is the personification of Mio Takamiya's sorrow and hatred toward Isaac Westcott for killing her beloved Shinji Takamiya, resulting in her birth but is later sealed away by the very one who gave 'birth' to her.\n\nIn the end, the events of the game are indirectly related to the DEM director.\n\nDanmachi Memoria Freese - Ais Catastrophe Crossover\n\nMain Article: Kaguya Ray Peram Westcott\n\nWestcott is mentioned multiples times by Shido and other Spirits who are teleported to the world of Danjon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka? (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?).\n\nWhen Bell asks what caused humanity to go after the Spirits, Shido replies saying it was a man known as Westcott who started the persecution of Spirits by manipulating the world's governments, even more saying he was the scariest of all totalitarians of the world. Another time he was mentioned by Shido, was when there was someone in his world that was worse than AST as he was someone with malicious intentions and abused the Spirits for decades. In addition, he was indirectly blamed for causing the Spirits to be teleported to Danmachi's world.\n\nShiori Girls Side\n\nA banter ancore side story where all characters got their genders inverted and factions are converted into rival academies. In this world, Westcott (named as Irene Westcott) is the head of the DEM Academy alongside Allen Mathers (Ellen's male genderbend).\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nMage\n\nAuthority: It may not seem like a power, but his authority is one of his worst weapons while acting as the DEM director. He has control about any kind of authority on Earth (being the only person in the world able to create Realizer). Westcott is considered one of the most important people in the world by the fact that he is the only person who can manufacture Realizers and arm all nations of the world. With his authority, he can do whatever he wants with any human on Earth to the point he can commit any war crime without punishment. Westcott's orders also reach the military forces of the world, giving him temporary emergency powers over the security and defense forces of the world.\n\nMagical-Technology: Isaac Westcott can use magic created through technology and Spirit's mana however, he never used it in direct combat. He uses it just in case he really needs to, during the transformation of Dark Tohka he used magic to teleport to somewhere. It's unknown if he knows offensive magic.\n\nGifted Orator: The main asset of Westcott is his ability to inspire his troops with enthusiastic speeches. It can take almost any situation and turn it into a speech that will strengthen the morale of his soldiers and Wizards for their next operation or mission.\n\nDEM Wizards: DEM Wizards are trained (or brainwashed) to be psychopaths who loyally obey him, so they would give their life to his cause because he ordered. Wizards are skilled humans who have undergone training and usually have an implant to manipulate the territories coming from their CR-Unit. Even though Most Wizards are under DEM Industries, other countries also have developed their own version under their military forces. They are usually capable of various feats such as flying and creating barriers. The extent of this ability is determined by the properties of the territories they can produce. Advanced technology can be fatal to Wizards as it places a heavy strain on their bodies. Some Wizards have undergone surgeries to alter their bodies in order to strengthen their usage of the Realizer. However, such procedures can shorten one's lifespan. The DEM Wizards are the most prepared and well-trained soldiers of the world and were trained to serve Westcott until their last breath, making them their honor-guards.\n\nBandersnatch: The private army of Westcott is mostly composed of Bandersnatch robots (or droids). A DEM humanoid doll or robot equipped with a Realizer that must be linked to a larger Realizer unit for it to function. They use directly magic cannons links to their hands, with power enough to destroy heavy vehicles and tanks. The army is composed by hundreds of thousands of droids, enough to conquer a nation.\n\nMaster Strategist: Westcott is an effective planner and strategist, developing complex plans to achieve his goals for over half a century. He accounts for the personalities and usual mannerisms of allies and enemies alike and never takes anything for granted - notably, he considers Shido to be high-priority threat simply because he knows little about his capabilities.\n\nTorture Knowledge: These \"weapons\" are used by Westcott almost in everything he does or says. Also one of his fetishes. Most of his soldiers had been formed on the basis of the fear, as seen in episode 4 of season 2 when James was showing fear in returning to D.E.M with empty hands. Westcott tortures his soldiers in the cruelest ways possible for their failures, such as psychological torture, depriving them of oxygen and/or rape.\n\nInverse Spirit\n\nWhen Nia Honjou went into her Inverse Form, Artemisia Ashcroft was able to extract her Qlipha Crystal (inverse Spirit form's crystal) from her body and gave it to Isaac Westcott. He then bonded with it in his chest, giving him all the powers of Nia's Inverse Form (at least half of them thanks to her near-inversion state).\n\nOne of the powers he gained is an ability to summon Nia's Demon King, Beelzebub, a book with basically the same powers as Nia's Angel, Rasiel. The book can give a person information about a subject just by thinking about it, as shown when Westcott found out about Shidou changing the past during Tobiichi Devil events and can alter the future, though only for a few seconds max. However, unlike Rasiel, it has also shown to have the ability to summon shadow-like creatures from its pages. However, Nia's Inverse Form was in incomplete form because of Shido's intervention.\n\nDemon King: Beelzebub; \"Tome of Divine Corruption\". It can transfer information about a subject directly into his mind if he just thinks about it, as shown when Westcott found out about Shido changing the past during the events of Tobiichi Devil, and he can freely share this information with others just by simply touching them. It can also summon shadow-like creatures from its pages that follow his every command.\n\nHowever, since Nia's Inverse Form was in an incomplete state (because of Shido's intervention) only a part of her Qlipha Crystal was extracted. As a result, Westcott's Beelzebub is also in an incomplete state, implying that the Demon King is not as powerful as it was, and/or does not have all the powers it had when Nia was using it.\n\nBeelzebub still has a connection to Nia's angel Rasiel, as the two used to be two sides of the same embodiment. As a result, Nia can sabotage Beelzebub by interfering with its information network, which she has used to further weaken the Demon King. Also, Nia states that, like Raisel, Beelzebub is incapable of predicting the future or reading a person's inner thoughts.\n\nSo far the Demon King owned by Westcott, Beelzebub, has shown to have the following ability:\n\nAshufiriya: Traps the target(s) into the book and transports them into an adjacent world created by Beelzebub. According to Nia, the world is created by various scenarios made by people's dreams and imagination. The people imprisoned assume the roles of fairy tale and manga characters, though several alterations might be made to the source material. While trapped within the fantasy world, other Spirits are unable to use their Angels.\n\nNibelcol or Daughters of the Demon King: Summons various soldiers from Beelzebub's pages, all of whom bare a striking resemblance to Marina Arusu. However, due to Beelzebub's connection with Rasiel, the Nibelcol has a significant weakness despite their great numbers. Because Shido still has Nia's affections, he is able to seal the Nibelcol with a kiss, causing them to revert back into paper and fade away into light particles.\n\nInverse Spirit of Origin 1 - A'athiel\n\nA'athiel\n\nA'athiel is a Qliphothic Archdemon who presides over abyssal sorcery and the Atlantean Current. The \"Atlantean Current\" is simply a moniker for a primal sort of magick– it has no reference to a real or literal Atlantis. He specializes in necromancy, death magic, the divinatory casting of bones or runes, fire magic, sex magic, warding (especially using snowflakes), initiatory enlightenment, the enchantment of and divination via pendulums, execration magic, ice magic, jewelry enchantment, sexual vampirism, divination by fire, Ouija boards, empathy, protection, the esotericism of Neptune and Saturn, initiation through the Sphere of the Sun, the creation of destructive thought forms, candle magic, sky ring, tarot cards, and shielding.\n\nOthiel is a psychopomic charioteer who carries the torch of the moon. He can augment the witch's talent for the casting of circle and bring about the opening of portals. He's a protector of infants and the guardian of Those Who Died Nameless and Forgotten, and he can open the way to Da'ath, the Qliphoth, Valhalla, or any astral plane the magician desires– including parallel universes.\n\nA'athiel can strengthen the personal magnetism of the witch and make her a much better lay. He can open the magickian to her true sexuality. He can help the witch cast the perfect circle or otherwise construct the perfect sacred space, and he can bring about the full manifestation of the four elements.\n\nAthiel can engender gnosis of the Higher Self and engender a unique blossoming of the Soul Star Chakra (empowerment of the first transpersonal chakra). He can purify the minor chakras of the body, including the astral eyes and ears.\n\nA'athiel presides over the third veil before Samael known variously as Chasek or Chashakh, being the Qliphothic emanation equivalent to Ain Soph Aur. Chashakh, which name means \"Darkness\", awaits beyond the last sphere of the left pillar of the Qliphoth– that is to say, behind and before Satariel (Saturn/Lucerifuge). The warlike demonic emissaries of Chashakh are the most violent and dangerous of the emissaries of any of the three veils, and Chasek is the closest of the veils to the Qliphothic Tree.\n\nOthiel is traditionally recorded to manifest as a bloated, black, and horrid creature described as anthropomorphic and insectoid, and it is said that his breadth is greater than his width. He appeared to me in a vision as a 9-foot-tall werewolf with a crown of fire, carrying a primitive axe in his left hand and a platinum-or-silver-looking sceptre in his right hand.\n\nThe name \"A'athiel\" means \"Uncertainty of God\", which I reinterpret as \"God of Ambiguity\". An alternate translation of the name renders \"Weakness, But Strength Through Struggle\".\n\n====A'athiel's Powers====A'athiel (Gokushi Saidan, lit. Altair of Extreme Death) is considered as the evil counterpart of Ain Soph Aur of Mio Takamiya (since the user is a person of pure evil). A'athiel is a Demon King with a physical organic body, it manifests as a demonic flower that emits particles of darkness rather than light (one that is used by Mio).\n\nA'athiel's particles of blackness are used as small drops of water that comes out of a rain of darkness that corrupts living beings that are touched by the particles. It also can be used as \"needles\" of darkness that pierce through the body of the enemy, melting them to the bones.\n\nInverse Spirit of Origin 2 - Qemetiel\n\nQemetiel\n\nQemetiel, Belial, and A'athiel comprise the Threefold Emanation from the Abyss which engendered the manifestation of the Nightside Palace of Deathful Wombs and are considered to be the Qliphothic equivalents of the Christian Trinity which engendered the manifestation of the Sephiroth. While Belial is rightly venerated as one of the foremost divinities of Western black magic, the other members of this trinity are largely disregarded even in modern Qliphothic esotericism. I would ask the reader to think of how much Belial has offered her in her black magical endeavors, and posit that Qemetiel and A'athiel inevitably warrant equivalent veneration to him.\n\nQemetiel presides over the First of the Three Trans-Qliphothic Veils which stand as a Trinity above the Pillars of the Qliphoth between the Tree of Death and Knowledge and the Primordial Abyss wherein Samael, the Penultimate Face of the Devil, is said to preside and rule. His Veil stands above Thaumiel and is referred to in Hebrew as Tohu, a Hebrew word translating to \"Formless\", \"Chaos\", and \"Desolation\". He gives much tutelage regarding acts of violence, insurrection, murder, war, and drug dealing. He can impart whatever book smarts and street smarts the witch desires and present voluminous instruction in magic and witchcraft.gendered the manifestation of the Nightside Palace of Deathful Wombs and are considered to be the Qliphothic equivalents of the Christian Trinity which engendered the manifestation of the Sephiroth. While Belial is rightly venerated as one of the foremost divinities of Western black magick, the other members of this trinity are largely disregarded even in modern Qliphothic esotericism.\n\nAs a Divinity of the Nightside Veils beneath the Devil of the Abyss, Qemetiel stands elevated in station beyond Chavajoth (the Azerate). The name Qemetiel is generally translated to English as \"God of Crowns\", but I believe a speculative retranslation is in order for the purposes of Qliphothic esotericism. \"God of Crowns\" appears to make less sense, in light of my gnosis of Qemetiel, than the translation \"Crown of Divinity\".\n\nThe numerical value of Qemetiel is 190, which corresponds to a Hebrew word signifying the rib of Adam. It also corresponds to a Hebrew word meaning \"Pearl\", and while this word is held to be a title of the Sephirothic Sphere of the Earth, the word \"Pearl\" is often used as a moniker for the Philosopher's Stone. By comparing these two correspondences, we can infer that the number 190 relates to the spark of divinity which is intrinsic to humankind – or at least the feminine polarity of it. After all, Malkuth and Eve are both feminine. As the Qliphoth is considered to be of a primarily female polarity, this is a sensible inference.\n\nQemetiel's Powers\n\nQemetiel or ■■■, is the evil counterpart of Mio's main angel, Ain. Unlike the real Ain, the powers of Qemetiel are polar opposite of the former that creates life and creation.\n\nWestcott summons a demonic void without a physical form capable of illuminating the entire world with darkness instead of light, this darkness covers the entire world into eternal darkness, causing the planet to die without solar light;\n\nErase whomever or whatever Westcott desires from reality, abstract elements like colors, oxygen, living beings of the existence, human memories, light, planets, stars and even entire galaxies;\n\nInverse Spirit of Origin 3 - Belial\n\nBelial\n\nAfter having success in stealing the power of Mio Takamiya, Westcott finally becomes the Spirit of Origin, which means he gained the power over all Spirits and Angels of Kallabah, the tree of Life. However, apparently due to his dark nature, Westcott gained power over Qliphoth, the tree of Death. It's demonic tree capable of distorting the laws of reality within its boundary.\n\nSince the corruption of Mio's power was conducted by his dark nature, the power of Ain (Ein Sof, or Eyn Sof), in Kabbalah, is understood as God prior to any self-manifestation in the production of any spiritual realm, probably derived from Ibn Gabirol's term, \"the Endless One\". Ein Sof may be translated as \"unending\", \"(there is) no end\", or infinity), was Inverted to Belial, which means the personification of all evil in the existence, the Devil.\n\nBelial is a term occurring in the Hebrew Bible which later became personified as the devil in Jewish and Christian texts. Belial is a powerful demon existed before Satan and pandered to the needs of the perverts, atheists, the worthless, occultists, or anyone with a disturbed soul. According to the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, Belial, or the King of Evil, was responsible for bringing wickedness to man. Among certain sections of the Jews, this demon was considered the chief of all the devils.\n\nThe word \"Belial\" means worthless in Hebrew, and later came to represent the personification of the devil. In the Old Testament of the bible, the word tends to be used to describe a class of people, for instance, the sons of Belial. The New Testament introduces Satan as the ruler of evil, but prior to that, Belial was said to be his predecessor. In demonology, he is one of Satan's most notable demons sources recount.\n\n\"Belial\" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel to calamitous circumstances and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods; those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah; the wicked sons of Eli; insolent Nabal; opponents of God's anointed, David; Rehoboam's unsteady associates; Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth; and men in general who stir up contention. Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: \"No more will any worthless person pass again through you. In his entirety, he will certainly be cut off.\".\n\nDevil's Powers\n\nImmortallity: For being the master of Belial, the chief of all demonic forces, Westcott was granted with immortality and could no longer be killed by magic, man-made weapons and other sources of energy like light, darkness, water, electricity and many other elements of nature. As an immortal being, Westcott can regenerate even if he is in pieces, can revive as many times as he wants and can easily decide the death of all living beings just by touching them (Spirits seems to be immune). Aside from his immortal state, he can live forever and can't be killed by other sources like diseases and natural death. He requires no sustenance, and cannot be harmed by mortal means. Only the power of Kallabah or divine entities are capable of doing him harm.\n\nExtrasensory: Westcott has senses that are not only sharper than a mortal's, affording his abilities such as perfect accuracy, but he has abilities that they completely lack. In particular, he possesses a 'third-eye' which allows him to see things from far, far distances. Though he never uses it to do so, he can likely see through things that fool human eyes.\n\nTeleportation: Westcott uses this often for quick appearances or escapes. Westcott can teleport everywhere, as he is everywhere not nowhere at the same time. However, this is limited as he can teleport only inside of a planet.\n\nDeath Predation: This usage of this spell creates a dark wave that kills everything in the Westcott's immediate vicinity.\n\nSupernatural Physicality: Westcott could alter his physical capabilities to virtually any level he needed or wanted due to his magical shape-shifting abilities. He has manifested superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and senses. No parameters or upper limits were established regarding these capabilities.\n\nUniversal-Rewriting: By a far point, his strongest and most dangerous ability. Summoning the Belial demon, Westcott can destroy the laws of the existence and break through space and time to create a universe he is imagining. While Belial is active, it will quickly break into the barriers of the universe and recreate a new world that its master is asking for. While it's unknown, but this ability can create entire worlds where all life doesn't exist. If Westcott asks for it, he can create a universe where all life and creation never existed, thus bringing everything to emptiness.\n\nHowever, with great powers, comes weakness. Due to the immense power of Belial, Westcott has little control over it and can easily lose command over his demon. If anything happens while to him while he is commanding Belial, he might lose control over his mana, causing his power to go berserk and end in a worldwide explosion that would destroy the planet Earth (or even the solar system but it's capacity is unknown). However, his weakness is available only for Spirits, who are directly connected to Kabbalah. Other sources like demons, angels and other paranormal forces can't harm him.\n\nList Victims\n\nVictims of Isaac Westcott and his DEM\n\nWestcott's dog (unknown causes; possible murder)\n\nWestcott Family (killed in an \"accident\" conducted by their son)\n\n150 millions of Chinese (killed by the First Spacequake)\n\n10-20 Millions of Mongolians (killed by the First Spacequake)\n\n1-2 millions of Koreans (killed by the First Spacequake)\n\n6-9 of million Russians (killed by the First Spacequake)\n\n10-15 millions of Earthlings (after Mio's escape)\n\nThousands of humans turned into monsters (by Mio trying to escape from DEM)\n\nTakamiya Family\n\nShinji Takamiya (killed by Westcott)\n\nMana Takamiya (kidnapped and brainwashed)\n\nItsuka Family (hunted)\n\nShido Itsuka (numerous attempts of murder and abuse)\n\nKotori Itsuka (numerous attempts of murder and capture)\n\nHundreds of soldiers of British Army (experiments conducted in soldiers to turn them into Wizards)\n\nArtemishia Bell Ashcroft (mind raped and left into coma)\n\nEdgar F.

Can't you do that? I will do anything! I'll listen to whatever you say! Please!\n\nWestcott: Fufu... What a bother. Did you come to laugh at me, Elliot?\n\nElliot: I came here to see my friend's death. Is that such a funny story, Ike?\n\nWestcott: Oh... that's right. That was a silly question. Even if the methods were different, you are certainly my friend... besides... We're fellow comrades who were rejected by the same woman.\n\n(Westcott smiled a little as his vision of the world began to blur again. Ellen, Karen, Woodman. Sworn friends who had their hometown burned and vowed for vengeance together, Westcott's oldest comrades. Such uniform gazes at Westcott, expressing intentions of sorrow. Westcott remembered a strange feeling. Memories of his childhood, of when his mother was placed and buried in a coffin. From his mother's perspective, the sensation of everyone's gazes gathering for the funeral service. Ellen was crying, Karen was looking down, and Woodman was quietly looking here. Different shapes, but there was sadness and mourning filled with despair. The looks of his friends, and the fact that he was the one molding these facial expressions, The fact that he was at the center of this despair. For Westcott, it was comfortable and irresistible. Magician Isaac · Westcott, with ecstatic excitement, slowly closed his eyes).\n\nWestcott (thinking): *What... it was so simple... wasn't it? Fill them with despair...* „\n\nDialogues\n\nWestcott's Introductions\n\nThroughout the story, Westcott has always received numerous introductions when he firstly appeared in a Volume or in a chapter.\n\nVolume 5\n\n1st Appearance - \"Seeing the face of discomfort and his puzzled voice, Origami turned behind and took a glance. Over there, a man was standing, accompanied by a girl who appeared to be a secretary. He was a tall man wearing a jet black suit. His hair was dark ash blond, and he had a pair of sharp eyes as if a knife was used to cut a slit on his face. His age should around 30 years old, yet, he was a mysterious man that gave off a feeling that of being an experienced veteran. Seeing that man's face, and hearing Kritani saying that person's name, Origami moved her eyebrows a little.\"\n\nVolume 6 and 7\n\n2nd Appearance - \"In the suite room of the top floor in the Imperial hotel located at the west side of Tenguu city, Isaac Westcott sat down while sighing. He raised his chin while slightly flicking the tip of his dark ash blonde hair, and further narrowed his eyes which looked like sharpened blades.\"\n\n3rd Appearance - \"Of course, Jessica wasn't someone who kills for pleasure. It was not like she does not feel any sympathy toward the considerable number of casualties that will appear from her own attacks. But, that slight sentimental feeling was completely erased by the sweet sound of Westcott's orders which imply capturing the spirits is for the greater good. Right now, Jessica only recognizes the stage audience as a group of potatoes or pumpkins.\"\n\n4th Appearance - \"A few seconds later, the wall cracked as before, and a door opened. And from there entered a man. He was a tall, thin man. His most striking feature was his silver hair and sharp eyes that looked like they were carved into his face with a dagger. Closely between the ages of 35, a dangerous, dark and evil aura around him, masking his true age. When the man entered the room, Tohka felt a strange feeling of unease. It was not because Ellen had spread her Territory. But for some unknown reason, the moment Tohka saw that man, she felt as if the temperature dropped several degrees.\"\n\n4.5th Appearance - \"Even though he shouted, it seemed she could not hear his voice from there. Most likely, its structure was the same as the one Fraxinus had. Then that meant, there should be a way to enter that area by fiddling with something from this side. He moved his sight in the room. ---and. At that moment, Shidou stopped. Inside the research block he thought was empty, there was one man, sitting on a chair while facing his back towards Shidou and Miku. The man's voice echoed softly before he stood up from the chair. He then faced towards Shidou and Miku in a casual manner. He had a dull ash blonde hair and a tall body. His raptor-like sharp eyes was also characteristic. Shidou slightly raised his eyebrows, when he saw his face and heard his name. Yes. Isaac Westcott, DEM industries management board director. If anyone watched TV, read newspaper and net news, it was probably a name they had heard of at least once.\"\n\nVolume 8\n\n5th Appearance - \"All of them were board members of this DEM Company. Everyone was sitting at a giant elliptical table and were flipping through the documents on their hands while making the same difficult face. Nonetheless, it was also something not impossible. Everyone one of them should have already received reports from here and there. And even the documents on their hands had the situation written in details. Nonetheless naturally, it's not like everyone who was there was making that face. On the chair placed the furthest back of the room. Over there one man sitting calmly. He had a jet-black suit covering his body. A young man around the age of his mid-thirties. As if looking over the meeting, his unpleasant eyes that expressed darkness were peeking from the gap of his dark grey bangs. Sir Isaac Ray Peram Westcott. He was the DEM company's which was exactly the topic of discussion right now.\"\n\nVolume 9\n\n6th Appearance - \"Having finished the remaining simple business inside the private jet, Isaac Westcott came out from the VIP entrance of the airport and rode the car waiting for him before heading towards the lodging area in Japan's Tokyo metropolitan Tenguu city's hotel. He was a characteristic tall man with dark ash blonde hair and a pair of sharp eyes like naked blades. His age should be around in his mid-30 but, the dangerous atmosphere covering his body was disrupting the appropriateness of his age. At the least, he was somewhat too young to be burdened with a world class enterprise known as DEM industry---------such an impression was probably impossible to someone unless they have met with him directly.\"\n\nVolume 10\n\n7th Appearance - \"It was a young man around his mid-thirties. He has dark ash blonde hair and blade sharp eyes. His eyes filled with darkness could make the people facing him feel an indescribable anxiety. Sir Isaac Rey Peram Westcott. He was the managing director of the huge world famous company, DEM industries.\"\n\nVolume 12\n\n7.5th Appearance - \"In a room in the DEM industry Japan branch, the managing director-Isaac Westcott made a small sighs. He's a man in his mid-thirties with characteristics blade sharp eyes and dark ash blond hair. He wore a darkness black suits that shows no gaps and was looking down at the documents scattered about on the desk.\"\n\nVolume 13\n\n8th Appearance - \"The man is being assisted by an ash blonde haired woman whose appearance could attract every man. Her facial expression is as sharp as a sword which would cut them down, making those two fall into silence with their faces getting paler. That man's appearance looks young. It seems like he's in the middle of thirties. But why does this young appearance suit with him despite his age? He doesn't looks like a middle age man at all. Actually, this year Knox is 48 years old, so you can say that this man's age is younger than him. Of course that's only natural. The person over there isn't an ordinary man. He's a man whose name is famous in the world as a world genius financial monster from DEM Industry, its first generation founder: Sir Isaac Westcott.\"\n\n9th Appearance - \"Suddenly, Shidou could sense something dangerous and turned his glance to a certain direction. Perhaps it was because his senses were sharpened from using a Spirit's Reiryoku. Or else, it's all because the presence of that person over there is way too bizarre to the point that he couldn't ignore it. Though he wasn't sure what it is--------But there's a [Foreign] existence that slipped in between them who wasn't here until just now. He knew and felt that person's presences clearly. It's not only Shidou; all Spirits who were present there also pointed their gazed towards the same direction. While being looked by everyone, that man was walking slowly towards Artemisia and Nia. He was a man with ash-blonde hair and wearing a black suit. Shidou looked at that man with a surprised gaze. Isaac Ray Peram Westcott.\"\n\n10th Appearance - \"At the moment, Shidou felt that the Spirits choking at the same time. The malice that he felt since the first time they previously faced Westcott began to expand. This man can't be described as cruel or brutal. He can only be defined as ------ [Abnormal].\"\n\nVolume 14\n\n11st Appearance - \"Peering inside, they could see a man sitting on a chair in the room. He had an impaling pair of eyes under a dark ashen hairline - alongside a floating pitch-black book at hand. He was the renowned ruler of this company - Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott, in person.\"\n\n12nd Appearance - \"Westcott intently stared at the pitiful wizard, like a predator hunting its prey. The unfortunate girl's facial expression instantly paled, and she hurriedly shook her head insubordination.\"\n\n13rd Appearance - \"Lingering amidst the white smoke was a man wearing black Western-style clothes and a wizard equipped with a CR-unit. The two leisurely walked out of the mist.\"\n\nVolume 16\n\n14th Appearance - \"Ellen came to an abrupt standstill, having detected that beyond the door lingered an unwanted presence. Despite Westcott possessing an air of intimidation that the majority of commoners nowhere near did, the roiling presence a meager doorstep away distilled a unique ambiance. As if——yes, as if a horde of horrors awaited them both with hushed breaths.\"\n\n15th Appearance - \"The moment Ellen got up, the door flew open as a man came into the room. The man gave the impression that all of the world's darkness had compacted itself into a human shape. He has dusky ash colored hair and a pair of eyes resembling metallic rust. Although he looked about thirty years old, the oozing sense of intimidation and dread he was emitted wouldn't match that assumption. Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott, the king of magicians who had established DEM within a single generation.\"\n\nVolume 17\n\n16th Appearance - \"And from the very back of the group──a very prominent man came to the forefront. It was a tall man who was about 20 years old. He was characterized by dim silver hair and rusty eyes. Although his expression and behavior were very gentle, his body was emitting the strange atmosphere that he couldn't completely hide.\"\n\nVolume 18\n\n17th Appearance - \"As if to confirm his premonition, a man came out from the shadow of the rubble. Dim ash-gray hair and eyes with a dull metallic hue, there was a strange threatening atmosphere coming from him that was different from confronting a Spirit or Wizard. Yes, he was the executive director of DEM industries and the starting point for this battle. The first man that started the conflict over the Spirits.\"\n\n18th Appearance - \"The sweat dripping down his cheeks reached his lips, causing a salty taste to spread in his mouth. Shidou didn't dare to loosen his guard as the eyeballs in his eye sockets orbited around to scrutinize the nearby surroundings. There was an innumerable amount of Nibelcol paper in their vicinity. And at the very end──a man who personified darkness quietly stood there. Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott. The head of DEM industries and the enemy of Ratatoskr, And also──the man who brought Spirit into this world 30 years ago alongside Elliot and Ellen, providing the impetus for the current battle. No──not only that. Shidou glared at Westcott with a glare brimming with animosity. For Shidou who had regained the memory of \"Shin\" now, this man was the subject for the clear hatred of killing him and kidnapping Mana.\"\n\nVolume 19 (final)\n\n19th Appearance - \"The man over there had dusky blonde hair reminiscent of abandoned metal and a pair of eyes reflected with a rusted hue. Throughout the vicissitudes of life, to old age, to the end of prosperity──this man gave the impressing of such a thing. Isaac Westcott. An inheritor of the mysteries and a blood descendent of the magicians──the man who establish DEM within a single generation.\"\n\n20th Appearance - \"The market values of European enterprises were ranked from top to bottom. Despite the subtle variations depending on the year, DEM would never fallout from the single digits. DEM──Deus Ex Machina Industries. This super organization was involved in a wide range of developmental projections including the manufacturing of arms, aircraft, vehicles, ships, space development, semiconductors, electronic equipment, fiber industry and even travel agencies. Furthermore, the enterprise, with its wide range of affiliated companies and R&D projects, can be said that half of the residents of European countries lived under its grace. However, even that number did not consider taking into consideration the real developmental result behind DEM──the Realizer Manifestation Device and the accompanying CR-Unit. In other words, that was just the tip of the iceberg. A private enterprise that had enough wealth to buy a small country and possessed the means of turning such behavior into reality. Like its name suggested, it was an overwhelming and tyrannical grey giant. The castle built by the Magician Isaac Westcott.\"\n\n21st Appearance - \"On the bridge of one of the DEM ships sailing the skies, Westcott was listening to various reports from the fleet through the loudspeaker. Even though he was at the forefront, there weren't any emotions of tension or frustration marked on his expression. The corners of his mouth distorted into an elegant form as his fingertips would occasionally tap rhythmically to the surface of his black suit. It was almost like he was enjoying an afternoon holiday while relaxing to his favorite songs.\"\n\n22nd Appearance - \"The mechanical monster appeared throughout the city not warned by the spacequake alarm. This was an unusual scene. Just as the Spirits were confidential, the Realizer manifestation device controlling the Bandersnatch was not something made publically available. To think of exposing them to the general public and using them to harm civilians, no sane person would ever implement that. Even for a colossal superpower like DEM, it would be impossible to achieve this perfect endgame. No──perhaps they didn't even consider about the necessities of the aftermath. From this possibility, Shidou felt an illusion of his heart being cornered. As Shidou felt a shudder, a voice other than screams reached the speaker. Extremely calm, as if finding pleasure despite everything occurring──a male voice that if heard again would incense one's nerves beyond relief. No mistake. DEM's managing director, Isaac Westcott.\"\n\n23rd Appearance - \"Since this was an empty space without any obstructions to his sight, he quickly located them. But the problem was──it wasn't just Ellen and Mana there. Several girls floating outside of Fraxinus smiled while echoing with a voice lacking the slightest degree of tension. After recognizing them, Shidou couldn't help but call out their name. Yes──Nibelcol. The pseudo-Spirits made through a combination of the Demon King Beelzebub and DEM's technology. As the waves of laughter broke down, two more people came forward. One of them was Artemisia Ashcroft, a Wizard of DEM just like Ellen. The other person was──the head of DEM and the holder of the jet-black book, Isaac Westcott himself.\"\n\n24th Appearance - \"Ellen, who left the battlefield carrying Westcott in a Voluntary Territory, constantly called out to him while applying hemostasis, pain relief, and accelerated healing. Westcott's wounds were definitely fatal injuries, but it was a different matter when the person carrying him was the World's Strongest Wizard. Although it was not as powerful as the Medical Realizer Apparatus, Ellen's delicately woven Territory can still block his wounds to an extent. Even so, that was just the physical aspects. Even if the wound healed well, no one knew if he would wake up again after losing consciousness. In order to not let this happen, Ellen continued to call out for Westcott.\"\n\n25th Appearance - \"Two DEM Wizards appeared on the other side of the sky, Ellen Mathers and Artemisia Ashcroft. Kotori's face stained in shock as she confirmed the identities of those two. Then, as if to match that, a third voice echoed from somewhere. Then from that shadow, the figure of a person clad in light slowly stepped forward. ──With a bloodstain left behind on his chest, Isaac Westcott emerged. Westcott laughed as if to respond to that outcry. And then it came out──the words that herald ruin.\"\n\n26th Appearance - \"Shidou's voice began to shudder as he heard what Mio had just said. As Shidou raised his voice to a scream, Mio and Reine nodded at the same time. Being told of the worst case scenario, Shidou instinctively made a sullen face. The goal that Westcott had spoken of in the future world flashed in his mind. ──Obtain the power of the Spirit of Origin and overwrite the world. To be honest, he didn't comprehend what that meant when he first heard that. But now──after experiencing this space created by Mio, he could at last understand. If Westcott had the same power to create this space and if this space grew large enough to cover the entire world──it would certainly merit the expression of overwriting the world. He didn't know what kind of world Westcott would try to create. However, Westcott once said, \"This is a revenge against mankind\". Then, in that world, it wouldn't be hard to imagine what would happen to people that weren't Magicians. Speaking of a new world was good enough, but the essence of this goal was genocide of all humans on reality. Naturally, this matter was unacceptable.\"\n\n27th Appearance - \"In the darken sky where the setting sun had already vanished into the horizon, a brilliant radiance still remained. Like stars inlaid onto the night sky, the light swirled coiled and swirled as it converged onto a single point. A phantasmal sight as if coming from a dream. If one didn't know any better when gazing, surely it would undoubtedly be described as a God or perhaps an Angel. However, the expression of the Spirits watching on from the exterior of Fraxinus was not one of awe or adoration──but rather a look of trepidation and irritation. But such a response wasn't unwarranted. It wasn't a God at the center of the light, but the enemy of the Spirits, the magus Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott. Westcott's loud laughter resounded through the night sky.\"\n\n28th Appearance - \"At the center of the swirling flow of mana───The Spirit・Mio and the Magus・Isaac Westcott faced each other. As Westcott noticed Mio's silhouette, he did not mind to wipe the blood around his mouth and instead just gave a smirk.\"\n\n29th Appearance - \"The boundary between living and death is terribly ambiguous, depending on the judgment of each person to determine when death has arrived. Some people regard death as when cardiopulmonary functions cease, while others say that it is after the demise of all brain functions. Some people say that even if there is consciousness remaining, it is not necessary what the raw body contains as long as the heart of the person remains──then there is some form of existence left. Well, the last one might feel like escapist sentiments rather than a real definition. In an empty field of vision, Isaac Westcott was idly thinking about such a matters. ──If so, he wondered if he could still be considered living now? At the very least, cardiopulmonary functions had stopped. It was natural since the majority of his body had already disappeared. Although there was still some conscious thought left, it was uncertain if even his brain had retained its shape. He was just lying on the ground, watching the sky while waiting for his consciousness to stop. And so, while these thoughts still lingered, Westcott sneered at himself. Between people being alive or dead, he should be regarded as dead since a long time ago. Yes, as a human, Isaac Westcott was already dead. His humanity. He was a monster. What remained here was a wreckage of a pathetic Spirit barely retaining its existence through its reiryoku. His lingering consciousness was proof of having become such a form. A force of annihilation between an Angel and Demon King. Being involved at such a close range, this result was natural. There was no indication of Deus (Mio Takamiya) remaining. It seemed that she had disappeared a little earlier than Westcott. The truly loathing feeling of having been rejected in a double suicide, with that in mind, Westcott laughed again. Despite not knowing it himself, his facial features were still distorted in the shape of a smile. However, it was only a matter of time. Even as a Spirit, he wouldn't last much longer. Indeed, his consciousness began to dozy off as the pull of the Shinigami's hand grew closer. To bring his soul to Hell or a worse place.\"\n\nVolume 20 (post-death)\n\n30th Mention - \"At the same time as realizing that, along with a slight headache, a memory appeared within Shidou’s mind. It was the memory of that battle. Isaac Westcott, who had gained the power of the Spirit of Origin through the Spirit Ceremony, and the Spirits that fought against him. In the process, Maria was able to gain physical form through the power of Nia’s Angel Rasiel. He remembered it being said that... after maintaining the state of controlling the output of power, Maria can remain materialized like this.\"\n\n31st Mention - \"Isaac Westcott. Just hearing that name caused Shidou’s pulse to accelerate. The leader of DEM Industries and the Magician that began everything. The main culprit for the creation of Spirits. His goal was to 'rewrite' the world into a world for Magicians by using the power of the Spirits. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Shidou and the others had fought in order to stop that goal. In order to protect their world, Shidou and the Spirits choose to stand up against that powerful enemy.\"\n\nVolume 21 (post-death)\n\n32nd Mention - \"Since Shidou wasn’t at the scene at the time, the only heard the details after the fact──after the final battle a year ago, Ellen, who had lost Westcott, completely lost her memories and knowledge about DEM and Westcott after waking up from a coma. Although the reasons were unclear, after waking up Ellen showed no malice or hostility and was only happy to be reunited with Woodman and Karen.\"\n\n33rd Mention - \"Westcott arranged for Ellen to lose her memories at the same time as his death? Shidou frowned since this ran in contrary to that man’s usual style.\"\n\n34th Mention - \"Nighttime, at the captain’s seat of the airborne ship Fraxinus which was 15,000 meters above Tenguu City, Kotori whispered while stirring the Chupa Chups stick in her mouth. Unlike her white sailor suit worn during daytime, she was now wearing military clothes dyed in a crimson hue. The ribbon tying her hair also changed from white to black. It was Fraxinus’s captain, Itsuka Kotori’s commander mode. However, since one year ago, the frequency of entering this mode and coming onboard Fraxinus had gradually decreased. But that was only natural. Around the same time one year ago, the Spirit of Origin disappeared and everyone lost their Reiryoku. Additionally, at the same time, Isaac Westcott, the leader of DEM and Ratatoskr’s enemy, had passed away. DEM, which had lost Westcott’s strong central pull and influence, was in the midst of internal strife even after a year due to the anti-Westcott factions. Of course, Kotori continued to despise their enemy, but grudges had no more meaning after their strength unavoidably weakened. In any case, Ratatoskr’s greatest goal of sealing the power of the Spirits and allowing them to live a normal life has basically been achieved. Of course, they would continue supporting everyone, so it wasn’t as if they would be unemployed. But since there was no appearance of any new Spirits and the fear of the reversal of Reiryoku was gone, it can be said that most of their urgent matters had already been completed.\"\n\n35th Mention - \"The sound in anticipation of a Spacequake appearing──in essence it was an alarm reporting the arrival of a Spirit. For a least the past year, Shidou hasn’t heard this sound again. But that was natural. After all, there should be no more Spirits in this world that could cause a Spacequake. However, that fact was only known by those that witnessed the end of that battle last year. Residents in the neighborhood promptly evacuated into the shelter, surprised at not hearing the Spacequake alarm in such a long time. Several people ran past Shidou who was still stunned. Yes, that was the first possibility that Shidou had thought about. The Spacequake alarm did go off when a Spacequake has been detected. However, in the past DEM has also employed the usage of false alarms. However, DEM has now lost Westcott and fallen into internal strife. It didn’t make sense to give opposing forces another reason to antagonize them. What’s more, there are no Spirits left in today’s world, so there shouldn’t even be a reason for wanting to falsify an alarm.\"\n\n36th Mention - \"Shidou’s face tensed up as he squeezed out his voice. Indeed, this idea was understandable. But it was just empty talk on paper. In the first place, Isaac Westcott was the only person in the world to arrive at the Spirit Formula. The basic theory behind this technique was not known even to his former comrades Woodman and Karen. In the other words, the Spirit Formula was impossible to be reproduced after his death. It became so-called lost technology. Of course, since Westcott was able to create a Spirit, the chances of someone else in the future reaching it wasn’t zero. However, for a non-magician like Kurumi mastering this method──\"\n\n37th Mention - \"Of course, Shidou understood that this shouldn’t happen. Mio, the Spirit of Origin, had disappeared and her Sephira Crystal vanished from existence. The technique of creating Spirits was lost, leaving there no room for any new Spirits. But. But── Shidou thought to himself. ──What if a genius magician comparable to Westcott reached the Spirit Formula? ──What if there was other Spirits because of a reason he didn’t know about? ──What if the mana that dissolved into the world reunited for some reason── His own thoughts nearly caused him to suffocate. If this was happen, what was going to manifest now──\"\n\nThemes\n\nhttps://villains.fandom.com/wiki/File:02_Isaac.ogg\n\nhttps://villains.fandom.com/wiki/File:11.Despotism.ogg\n\nTrivia\n\nIsaac Westcott is considered to be the darkest villain already created by Koushi Tachibana in his light novels. He also is considered the most evil of all villains from Date A Live and Soukyuu no Karma. He turns out to be worse when he is introduced to other fictional worlds when Date A Live is introduced in a new crossover. When compared to other villains from their respective worlds, Westcott is usually referenced as the \"worst person\" they have ever met. Bell Cranel, the main protagonist from the popular Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, stated that Kaguya Westcott, the copycat of Westcott, was one \"so this is what you call monster\" in the Japanese version of the crossover, pointing Westcott as the most evil person Bell and his party ever faced when most of his enemies were monsters or had more limits in their cruelty. Following Memoria Freese crossover with Date A Live, a new crossover between Danmachi and Goblin Slayer was announced. In the crossover, Bell refered the Goblins as not being so different from the monsters he was used to slaughter at the dungeons even counting their perverted and rapist nature, yet they were much less worse compared to his \"previous enemy\". In Spirit Pledge crossover with Toaru Majutsu no Index, Misaka Mikoto, one of the most popular heroines in anime genre, also used the word \"devil in person\" to describe Westcott while Shirai Kuroko, the secondary protagonist of Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, describes Westcott as the \"embodiment of humanity's evil itself\". In most media outside of Date A Live canon where Westcott appear as an antagonist, he is always described to the most evil person they ever faced by their respective authors.\n\nAs such, Kaguya Westcott, the Impostor and hidden antagonist of Ais Catastrophe, is the only villain from the entire franchise to have their own soul dragged to hell in Danmachis universe. This is possibly a reference to Westcott's death in canon where is the only character to have experienced seen the Death God himself moments before his death, making his death more symbolic than any other character in the story.\n\nDespite being charismatic and charming when necessary, Westcott was quite anti-social and enjoyed being alone when Ellen was not around for him to tease her. Instead of being more active, Westcott spent most of his days inside of his office where no one could bother him.\n\nWestcott's eyes are considered to be rusted inorganic pieces of meat by other characters, scaring them off everytime they face Westcott directly. When they had the chance to describe the feeling, some thought his eyes gave the impression they were being reduced to nothing but animals while others felt the impression of death itself.\n\nIn volume 19, Westcott's army of Bandersnatch are used in two references by both Mai and Ai. Ai refers his Bandersnatchs as having the design of a \"hero of Justice\", a straight reference to the tokusatsu superhero television series, Kamen Rider, that aired in 1971, being the first series of Kamen Rider franchise. However, when the robots were revealed to be evil, she called them \"evil army corps\" and demanded to take her to their great leader; now a straight reference to the main antagonistic faction of the series, Shocker and calling Westcott to be their great leader, aka, the Great Leader. Mai, on the other hand, thought they were robots from the future sent to kill her; indirectly calling Westcott as the Skynet and his robots as Terminators.\n\nWestcott is a very conservative person and dislike when other people touch his stuff and objects as seen when Kiritani used his smartphone to speak with the Japanese Minister of Defense Saeki.\n\n\"Ike\" is an abbreviated form of \"Isaac\" in Hebrew.\n\nIt's unknown why he acquired the Inverse Form of Ain Sof when Westcott transferred the energy of Mio Takamiya, the First Spirit, to his body during the final battle considering Mio never went into Inverse Form but a popular theory suggested that the First Angel may be the mirror of the owner's heart. While Mio may be somewhat cruel, her intentions are pure yet dangerous and selfish while Westcott's heart is simply pure evil, confirming that no matter what, Westcott was a sinner and wicked person of the worst kind considering the creation of God Himself, who still declared Mio (a person who killed hundreds of children with the purification of the Sephirah Crystals) a pure and redeemable person. In the eyes of God, Westcott was a rotten soul to the core.\n\nWestcott compares himself to a child searching for a toy in a shop or a man tidying up his appearance before going to meet his lover, which is why he can't understand why people continue to fight him as he is doing his best to achieve something. In this sense, he considers himself to be a normal person.\n\nWestcott has a bizarre and unusual sense of logic between \"goal\" and \"hobby\". While most of all bad intentioned people in general have a goal in mind to fulfill their desires, Westcott actually consider his \"hobbies\" as being his true \"plans\". Westcott's ultimate goal to wipe out all humans, destroy the world's laws, rule the reality as a God and create a world for mages are actually only consequences of his actions (when it's obviously the inverse) while he consider the pain, death and destruction he will be causing as his true objectives, however, he never says his true intentions are actually to be cause mayhem probably to not cause distrust between him, Artemisia and Ellen. It can be said his plans are also only his secondary intentions while his hobbies of making people miserable, torturing Spirits, causing wars and destroying nations are actually his primary goals.\n\nWestcott is associated with the gray color in all aspects, including his own company, his suit and the DEM uniforms. In Bible, gray is an emotionless, moody color that is typically associated with meanings of dull, dirty, and dingy, as well as formal, conservative, and sophisticated. In addition, gray is a timeless and practical color that is often associated with loss or depression, emptiness, death and negative emotions.\n\nDespite a powerful mage, the novels never show him using any kind of magic form except for teleportation. As a child, Westcott was a genius in controlling magic's energy and could easily win in combat against adults. However, it may be something reasonable as he discarded magic to infiltrate in the human world as a normal person.\n\nFictional magician characters such as Lord Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald were used to compose Westcott's character, however, Westcott obviously has a better reason to exterminate the non-magicians as he directly suffered in the hands of said race while Voldermort and Gellert began their genocidal agenda by pure xenophobia. Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald are two of the most feared Dark Wizards in Harry Potter universe, and curiously both Dark Wizards seek to establish a worldwide magician dictatorship to exterminate all muggles (humans with no access to magic) and half-blood Wizards since both consider them inferior to wizards and witches. Westcott has the same ideals, goals and views and share the same extend hatred to Muggle-borns (humans) as well, considering them to be unnecessary to the world. In addition, the three wizards are considered to be the most powerful Dark Wizards of their respective era and world. In other terms, Westcott is far more composed and cunning because he directly infiltrated in the human world, controlling the world of his victims for more than 30 years and leading them towards their destruction without declaring a direct war.\n\nWestcott's third demon king of Qliphoth, Qemetiel, is written as furigana over ■■■ rather than above any kanji.\n\nThe three Demon King that Westcott has represents different negative and corrupt terms of Qliphoth.\n\n000 - Tohu - Chaos: Qemetiel (\"Crown of Gods\").\n\n00 - Bohu - Emptiness: Beliaal (\"Without God\").\n\n0 - Chasek - Darkness: Aathiel (\"Uncertainty\").\n\nThese \"names\" were created by the Temple of the Black Light, an satanic occult founded in 1995 that was considered criminal years later for murdering civilians in satanic rituals.\n\nThe occult consist of the unified belief in \"Chaosophy\". They believe that Chaos is an infinidimensional and pandimensional plane of possibilities, in contrast to cosmos which only has three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. They also believe that, in comparison with the linear time of cosmos, chaos can be described as timeless in the way that it is not contained nor limited by one-dimensional time, and formless, because of its ever-changing and infinite number of space dimensions. Militant neo-gnosticism and nihilism is taught within the group and they say that the true Satanist must not be a part of the modern society, as it is founded upon lies. The very fabric of this reality is a lie that hinders chaos from realizing itself.\n\nThese are the three dark veils before Satan, in their belief system seen as the three Forces that were expelled from Ain Sof in order to make way for the manifestation of the Black Light in the Outer Darkness that soon became Sitra Ahra: Qemetiel, Beliaal and Aathiel. These three powers can be seen as the Burning Trident held high above the Thaumielitan. These three powers can also be viewed as Wrathful Reflections of Ain, Ain Soaf and Ain Soaf Aur.\n\nThe first Demom King that Westcott gained after stealing it from Nia is called Beelzebub. Beelzebub is a powerful demon who holds a high seat in Hell's hierarchy. He is known for spreading belief in false gods, fanning the flames of war or lust, and possessing human bodies to carry out horrific acts. Beelzebub is one of Hell's most powerful demons, taking second place only to Satan himself. Some theologians even claim that Beelzebub has usurped Satan and become \"prince of the devils\" and \"chief of Hell.\" Others claim that Beelzebub and Satan are one and the same.\n\nAccording to Judeo-Christian beliefs, Beelzebub began his demonic career as a false god. He used clever lies and earthly rewards to convince"
