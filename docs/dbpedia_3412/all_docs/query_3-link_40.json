        "text": "The “What education marketers are saying” series shares insight from marketers working in the education sector, whether that’s for universities, agencies or student communities.\n\nInterview\n\nKyle (Education Marketer): Describe your approach to marketing in one word.\n\nIsaac: Enthusiastic.\n\nKyle: What’s been possible at Birmingham that wouldn’t have been pre-Covid?\n\nIsaac: At Birmingham, there was a tendency to romanticise desk life, but (slowly) we’ve unmuted ourselves on Teams and moved to working digitally. Is there still room for small talk during a meeting? In most cases, yes - Zoom, Teams and other platforms are shedding light on how way we communicate and challenging individuals to think differently.\n\nKyle: What non-HE brand should education marketers be paying attention to?\n\nIsaac: Jamie Oliver. Specifically, here’s a large business that has managed to shape its corporate label into a personable, ‘home cooked’ image on social media. No doubt Jaime has a social and digital team behind all his content, but this group is so tight and on message that every story, post and update helps craft a brand that manages to shift tens of thousands of jars of pasta sauce.\n\nHow many universities use their tone of voice guidelines that effectively?\n\nThere’s nothing more wholesome then seeing Jamie cook with his kids, but it’s all part of a clever marketing strategy to create a brand personable enough to invite into your kitchen.\n\nAnd does it sell? Absolutely!\n\nKyle: What’s your prediction for university marketing in the 2021 / 2022 cycle?\n\nIsaac: Marketers will need to find ways to emulate physical interactions, particularly during open days. In the past we have used brochures coupled with conversations – but how does that translate digitally? It’s likely we will use the same channels like live streaming, phone and email campaigns, but with an emphasis on personalisation and utilising technology to create meaningful, human connections."
