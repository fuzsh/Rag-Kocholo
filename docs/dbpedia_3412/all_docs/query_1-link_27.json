        "text": "At a party, Lucy sits next to Paul to meet someone new. She asks Paul about what he does in his free time. Paul says he enjoys cooking for friends. Lucy's eyes widen as she probes for details—what's the most exotic dish you've made? What makes a great chef? What else in life are you passionate about? Lucy continues to ask questions and learns about Paul's interests. Lucy's behavior is typical of a very curious person. After a lengthy conversation, would we expect very curious people to feel close to partners? Are these feelings reciprocated? Does social context matter? Researchers typically ignore curiosity in the formation and maintenance of close relationships.\n\nEveryone experiences moments when interested or curious (Berlyne, 1967; Izard, 1977); where people differ is the frequency, intensity, length, and scope of these experiences. Curious people tend to recognize and pursue knowledge and new experiences, possess an open and receptive attitude toward targets of their attention, and show a greater willingness to manage the novelty and uncertainty that might arise (Kashdan, 2004). To the extent that people engage in these behaviors regularly, curiosity contributes to exploration, discovery, growth, and achievement. Most theoretical and empirical work on curiosity has narrowly focused on school, work, sports, and art. Several scientists proposed that individual difference variables reflecting curiosity also relate to positive relationship outcomes (Kashdan & Fincham, 2004; McCrae, 1996; Sorrentino & Roney, 2000).\n\nCuriosity is generally a positive emotional experience (Izard, 1977; Silvia, 2006) but the appraisals and consequences can be distinguished from general positive affect (Silvia & Kashdan, 2009). Curiosity can also be distinguished from the broad personality dimension termed openness to experience. Openness to experience is composed of several facets including curiosity, aesthetic appreciation of art, having a vivid imagination and fantasy life, daydreaming, high valuation of emotional experiences and intellectual activities, and a preference for unconventional political, social, and religious views (McCrae & Costa, 1997). The diverse facets of openness partially account for the low reliability and construct validity compared with other Big Five personality dimensions (John & Srivastava, 1999). People can be high in openness, being imaginative and liberal in their political views, yet they may be reluctant to intentionally challenge and expand themselves. Curiosity might be appropriately characterized as a “mechanism of action (cognitively, emotionally, and/or behaviorally) whereas openness is more of a state of mind” (pp. 126-127, Kashdan, 2004). Regardless of the conceptual distinctions, little is known about how either dimension influence relational outcomes.\n\nStudy 3: Initial Social Encounters—Replication and Extension\n\nIn an attempt to show that the phenomenon documented in Study 2 was robust, methodological improvements were introduced. Although the IOS has good predictive validity (e.g., Aron et al., 1992) might be suboptimal for partitioning variance in person-situation interactions. Thus, we used a more comprehensive measure of positive social interactions. To ensure findings are more than retrospective, summary judgments, we conducted assessments during the interaction. Finally, we supplemented self-reports with a behavioral measure of closeness.\n\nWe explored three potential mechanisms that might account for the benefits of being curious in the small-talk condition. Highly curious people might be surprised by the pleasures of an uncertain social situation with an unknown person in a seemingly mundane small-talk situation. Unexpected, novel pleasures experienced with partners are often attributed to stable aspects of partners and the relationship (Strong & Aron, 2006). Thus, attribution processes might account for felt closeness during initial encounters. Motives for social behavior might also explain curiosity findings. Highly curious people might be primarily guided by the intrapersonal desire for novelty, stimulation, and mood enhancement and less so by the desire for friendship and acceptance. The presence of intrapersonal motives in the absence of intimacy motives might be evident to partners of the highly curious (explaining why partners did not fully reciprocated feelings of closeness).\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were 106 undergraduate students (53 cross-sex pairs) at George Mason University in stable romantic relationships. The sample was ethnically diverse: Caucasian (53.8%), Asian-American (21.7%), African-American (9.4%), Middle-Eastern (4.7%), Hispanic (4.7%), and other categories (4.7%). Ages ranged from 18 to 49 years, with a mean of 22.11 (SD = 5.79).\n\nInitial Measures\n\nTo assess trait curiosity, we again administered the 7-item Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI; Kashdan et al., 2004) (α = .74). To address construct specificity, we measured trait positive affect with the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988).\n\nSocial Interaction Measures\n\nPerceived closeness\n\nAt 15 minutes into the interaction and the end of the interaction, participants completed a 9-item measure of closeness and acceptance, intimacy, and enjoyment during the social interaction (e.g., “I felt close and connected to my partner”, “I felt accepted by my partner”, “I enjoyed the interaction”). Factor analysis (principal axis factoring with promax rotation and an examination of eigenvalues and the scree plot), yielded a one factor solution; for both versions, this factor accounted for greater than 60% of the variance. Thus, we aggregated the 9 items to form our central dependent variable of closeness (α's = .92 to .94). For this outcome to be on the same metric as the closeness variable in Study 2, we divided the aggregate by 9 so scores ranged from 1 to 7.\n\nBehavioral index of closeness\n\nAt the end of the interaction, we asked people if they wanted to provide an email address to be shared with partners. This led to a binary dependent variable of interest in a potential relationship.\n\nPerceived partner behavior\n\nTo evaluate the visibility of trait curiosity, participants rated their partner's behavior during the interaction on a 9-point scale from “not at all” to “completely”. Ratings were made for the following four behaviors: curious and interested, open and disclosing, tolerant and accepting, and energetic (α = .79).\n\nPartners evaluated how much they and their partners were responsible for making the interaction enjoyable and interesting, and contributing and maintaining the conversation. Using these four items, participants provided percentages for how much of the interaction was due to partner efforts (α = .79).\n\nSurprising pleasure\n\nParticipants rated their surprise at how pleasurable the interaction tended to be on a 9-point scale from “not at all” to “completely”.\n\nMotives\n\nParticipants also rated several statements about the motives for their behavior and motivation during the interaction on a 9-point scale from “not at all characteristic” to “completely characteristic”. Three statements reflected intrapersonal motives: satisfy desire to obtain new information, improve mood, and showcase strengths (α = .71). Three statements reflected social motives: desire to develop a friendship, be accepted, and obtain good social standing and positive attention (α = .75).\n\nProcedure\n\nThe major difference from the procedures in Study 2 was the inclusion of interim assessments (including measures of attributions and surprising pleasure) with different measures. After finishing each set of questions, participants completed surveys on a clipboard. This allowed for momentary thoughts and feelings to be reported with minimal recall bias. Other measures were included at the end of the interaction (including measures of motives).\n\nResults\n\nOverview of Data Analytic Procedures\n\nOur data had a multilevel structure with 106 participants (Level 1) nested within 53 dyads (Level 2). Similar to study 2, we used SPSS mixed modeling with curiosity on a continuum in all analyses.\n\nPrimary Analyses\n\nIs curiosity visible to partners?\n\nPartners viewed more curious actors as behaving in curious, open, tolerant, and energetic ways during the interaction, β = .39, t (96) = 3.50, p < .001.\n\nHow important is context to understand how curious people generate closeness with strangers?\n\nExperimental condition moderated the effects of trait curiosity on perceived closeness during interactions as reported by actors, β = 4.07, t (85) = 2.05, p = .02, and partners, β = 4.22, t (89) = 2.10, p = .02. In the small-talk condition, actors with greater trait curiosity experienced greater closeness, β = 3.12, t (90) = 2.54, p = .005; there were no significant actor effects in the intimacy condition. As shown in the top panel of , both low and high trait curious people experienced similar levels of closeness in the intimacy condition. In the small-talk condition, only high trait curious people experienced high levels of closeness. There was evidence of convergent partner effects; see the bottom panel of .\n\nThe same findings, albeit slightly stronger, were found for felt closeness at the end of the interaction (replicating Study 2). Experimental condition moderated the effects of trait curiosity on closeness felt by actors, β = 4.44, t (95) = 2.37, p = .01, and partners, β = 4.88, t (96) = 2.59, p = .005. These results show the stability of the findings during interim and retrospective assessments. Because these results reflect the same pattern as , for brevity, details are not reported.\n\nUsing our behavioral measure, highly curious people were more likely to leave an email address to get in touch with partners again, t (92) = 2.83, p = .003; no significant partner effects were found. However, experimental condition moderated actor effects, t (86) = 3.44, p = .001, and partner effects, t (92) = 2.48, p = .01. Actors with greater trait curiosity were more likely to leave an email in the small-talk condition, t (93) = 2.83, p = .005, and less likely in the intimacy condition, t (93) = 2.15, p = .02. Moreover, partners were more likely to leave an email when interacting with people with greater trait curiosity in the small-talk condition, t (87) = 1.85, p = .04, but less likely in the intimacy condition, t (91) = -1.71, p < .05.\n\nDo unexpected, surprising outcomes mediate the Curiosity × Condition effects on closeness?\n\nThe Trait Curiosity × Condition interaction effect (independent variable) predicted actor surprise (mediator), β = .54, t (91) = 2.62, p = .005; no partner effects were found. Actors with greater curiosity were more surprised by felt closeness in the small-talk condition, β = .26, t (89) = 2.09, p = .02; there were no significant actor effects in the intimacy condition. Testing mediated moderation with a bootstrapping approach (Preacher et al., 2007), we found support for partial mediation, Z = 2.19, p = .03.\n\nDo attributions for positive aspects of interaction mediate the Curiosity × Condition effects on closeness?\n\nThe Trait Curiosity × Condition interaction effect predicted partner attributions, β = .44, t (91) = 2.19, p = .02; no actor effects were found. In the small-talk condition, partners were more likely to attribute positive aspects of the conversation to the efforts of people with greater curiosity, β = .44, t (89) = 2.70, p = .004; there were no significant partner effects in the intimacy condition. However, a bootstrapping approach (Preacher et al., 2007) failed to show evidence of mediation.\n\nDo motives for socializing mediate the Curiosity × Condition effects on closeness?\n\nWe established that highly curious people view small-talk as more enjoyable for themselves and reap similar rewards as less curious people during interactions designed for relationship building. Partners often do not reciprocate these feelings. As a possible mechanism, we hypothesized that highly curious people possess weaker social motives and stronger intrapersonal motives. Mundane social situations should benefit from interest enhancement strategies. However, in intimate situations, a subset of highly curious people might be viewed as less appealing when guided by selfish motives.\n\nWe found evidence for condition as a moderator of trait curiosity on actors' intrapersonal motives, β = -1.93, t (98) = -1.81, p = .04, and social motives, β = -2.44, t (95) = -2.16, p = .02. To make sense of these findings, we decomposed these interactions. In the small-talk condition, people with greater trait curiosity endorsed stronger intrapersonal motives, β = 1.51, t (91) = 2.34, p = .01. In the intimacy condition, people with greater trait curiosity showed a trend toward weaker social motives, t (93) = -1.69, β = -1.66, p < .05. However, we found no support for motives as a mediator.\n\nConstruct specificity\n\nTo examine the specificity of trait curiosity effects, trait positive affect and Positive Affect × Condition effects were added to models. For felt closeness during interactions, the actor Trait Curiosity × Condition interaction effect, β = 4.21, t (80) = 2.15, p = .02, and partner Trait Curiosity × Condition interaction effect, β = 3.84, t (85) = 1.94, p = .03, remained; for felt closeness after interactions, the actor Trait Curiosity × Condition effect, β = 4.67, t (92) = 2.54, p = .005, and partner Trait Curiosity × Condition effect, β = 4.47, t (94) = 2.42, p = .01, remained. In contrast, positive affect effects failed to reach statistical significance.\n\nDiscussion\n\nReplicating Study 2 results, we found situations are important to understanding whether curious people are more successful at generating positive social interactions. In small-talk situations, people with greater curiosity attempt to self-regulate interest by transforming situations, enabling positive reactions for them and their partners. In situations with extensive opportunities for intimacy or relationship building, most people feel closer to each other during the interaction and in retrospective evaluations— regardless of a person's curiosity level. As validity for measuring curiosity with the CEI, across interactions, partners observed that people reporting greater scores frequently acted open, tolerant, energetic, and exploratory during the interaction.\n\nDiverging from Study 2, partners were similar to highly curious actors in that both felt particularly close during and after small-talk conversations compared with intimate conversations. Part of the reason highly curious people generated positive experiences from small-talk was their unexpected level of pleasure in this situation. The pleasures of uncertainty appear to enhance felt closeness to partners. This fits with our interpretation of the discrepancy between Studies 1 and 2: highly curious people possess strong abilities to transform uninteresting situations into more interesting ones. However, they underestimate their ability to cope with boring situations (see Wilson et al., 2005). Considering that people often use anticipated emotions to determine what decision to make, the aversion to boredom that characterizes people with greater curiosity might lead them to avoid social situations that they can tolerate and even transform into enjoyable ones from which they derive profound meaning.\n\nOther mechanisms linked to the social behavior of curious people were attributions and social motives. Partners were more likely to attribute interesting, enjoyable aspects of conversations in the small-talk condition to the actions of highly curious people. Thus, the interest-self-regulatory skills of highly curious people are visible to others. Curious people report that their social behavior is motivated by a desire to explore, enhance their own mood, and wield strengths. These motives presumably guide them to transform potentially uninteresting situations to be more rewarding. On average, less curious people are guided by a distinct set of motives. Although these variables characterize the social behavior of people with greater curiosity, they did not function as mediators of interpersonal closeness.\n\nPerhaps the most counter-intuitive finding from Study 2 was that people with greater curiosity did not contribute to greater felt closeness by partners in the intimacy condition. People enjoy being appreciated for their unique characteristics and react positively when people are attentive to their passions and interests (e.g., Gable et al., 2004). In two laboratory studies at separate universities, we replicated the finding that situations matter and add to our understanding of personality. Ideal, positive social situations render personality traits less important. Our evidence suggests that the stronger social motives of less curious people lead them to be as successful as more curious people in terms of feeling close and enjoying themselves, and getting partners' to feel the same in such ideal situations.\n\nGeneral Discussion\n\nPositive initial encounters are the first step in the development of meaningful, lasting relationships. Certain personality traits lead people to behave in ways that increase the likelihood of positive social interactions. In several studies, we investigated the possibility that curiosity is important to this process even though it is not, by definition, an interpersonally oriented dimension. To be comprehensive in our exploration, we attended to the perceptions and behaviors of people high in curiosity, the partners they interact with, and situations that might alter the influence of curiosity on social environments. Our results indicate that being curious is relevant to creating positive social interactions, a relationship that would be obscured without explicitly addressing context dependencies.\n\nWhy should curiosity be useful in the development and maintenance of positive social interactions and relationships? Each of the studies provided insight into the social benefits of being a curious person. Study 1 found that highly curious people expect to capitalize on intimacy opportunities, generating closeness between themselves and their partners. Although highly curious people expected small-talk situations to constrain their ability to generate closeness, they did expect to strategically alter the interest and positivity of the situation. Studies 2 and 3 found that in actual social interactions, highly curious people report strong closeness to partners, regardless of whether they are in situations that foster intimacy (when the need to belong is easily satisfied) or small-talk situations (requiring greater effort to gain positive outcomes). These effects could not be attributed to physical attraction or global positive affect.\n\nAs for being the partner of a highly curious person, we found mixed results. In Study 2, partners felt closer to less curious people after the intimacy conversation, and in Study 3, partners felt closer to highly curious people during and after the small-talk conversation. Thus, in Study 3, highly curious people and their partners felt the same way, enjoying the intimate conversation but developing even greater closeness following small-talk. We believe this is a result of the transformative efforts of highly curious people and the unexpected pleasures that result. Compared with others in the small-talk conversation, highly curious people appear to create conversations that are more interesting and enjoyable for them and their partners. We asked people if they wanted to give their email address to the experimenter who would subsequently give it to their partner. This behavioral index implies a large commitment of trying to develop a real-world relationship. Following small-talk interactions, highly curious people and their partners were particularly interested in trading emails suggesting a positive exchange that was distinct from what happened in the intimacy condition. The fact that we found a significant effect using a single item outcome might mean that a more comprehensive behavioral assessment might reveal a stronger, more robust effect.\n\nUnexpected, uncertain pleasures appear to be more intense and last longer (Bar-Anan et al., 2009; Berns et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 2005). Based on this work, personality traits linked to seeking out novelty and embracing uncertainty should be linked to positive social outcomes. We presented the first set of studies to address the pleasures of uncertainty in the social world. Interest self-regulatory strategies were hypothesized to be an explanatory mechanism such that people with greater curiosity actively transform social situations that are not inherently interesting. In conversations manipulated to be intimate, these behaviors are unnecessary (Sansone & Smith, 2000); hence, our hypothesis that social context would serve as a moderating variable. With the exception of Study 2, we found evidence that highly curious people attempt to transform social interactions by searching for novelty and acting on it, wielding their strengths, and engaging in a range of zestful, playful, stimulating, mood enhancement strategies. However, several mechanisms that characterize the social behavior of curious people failed to mediate relationships with generated closeness. It would have been useful if we videotaped interactions and used behavioral observation data to clarify behavioral mechanisms that might account for these relationships.\n\nThe current studies extend the boundaries of curiosity, often viewed as relevant to achievement, work, and other intrapersonal domains (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Kashdan & Fincham, 2004). Consistent with other studies on interpersonal affect and closeness (e.g., Kashdan & Roberts, 2004, 2006), greater curiosity appears to increase opportunities for satisfying the need to belong. Our findings converge with theory suggesting that people with greater curiosity show greater effort and progress in attempts to modify initially tedious or unappealing activities (Sansone, Weir, Harpster, & Morgan, 1992). Highly curious people appear to capitalize on potential rewards and growth opportunities by being agents of change. These behaviors, in turn, influence the expansion of their own as well as other people's social resources. That is, dispositional curiosity might facilitate the self-expansion process in relationship beginnings and the maintenance of passionate excitement in long-term relationships (Aron et al., 2000; Carson, Carson, Gil, & Baucom, 2007; Graham, 2008). Future work can examine whether being open and curious toward relationship partners prevents the complacency and mindless scripts that contribute to declining relationship satisfaction after only a few years after committing to a lifetime partnership (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2003). Initial evidence suggests that boredom is a substantial contributor to relationship dissatisfaction over a 9-year period (Tsapelas, Aron, & Orbuch, 2009). We suspect that cultivating curiosity in the context of relationships leads to more resilient long-term relationships but await future longitudinal research to test this claim.\n\nLimitations, Future Directions and Conclusions\n\nThroughout this article, we implied that curiosity shapes relationship processes and outcomes. As an adjunct to existing work on exploration and relationships (Bowlby, 1988; Elliot & Reis, 2003), we were interested in how personality operates to influence people in particular social contexts. There is a theoretical rationale for this focus. Dispositional curiosity and the preference for and ability to cope with novelty have been linked to biologically based, approach oriented, motivational systems that are visible in early infancy (Berg & Sternberg, 1985; Depue & Collins, 1999). Certainly, future work can test the bi-directionality of this relationship. Being in a relationship where partners provide a safe haven and autonomy support for explorations appear to increase a person's curiosity and motivation to take risks to expand the self (Feeney, 2004; La Guardia & Patrick, 2008). Given the role of attachment processes in exploration (Bowlby, 1969; Mikulincer, 1997), there is merit in examining the effects of parent-child and adult romantic relationships on the expression of curiosity. Even if there are neurobiological roots to dispositional curiosity, personality continues to show plasticity in the second half of life (Roberts, & Mroczek, 2008). Past and existing relationships probably play a role in this trajectory.\n\nAdditional work is needed on the potential aversive effects of excessive social curiosity (e.g., voyeurism, nosiness), which might explain the relative asymmetry between actor and partner social reactions. There is a lack of evidence as to whether strengths such as curiosity have “tipping points” or non-linear effects on social outcomes. In contrast to experimentally manipulated dyads (Studies 2 and 3), in naturally occurring relationships, partners are likely to be more receptive and flexible about the amount of curiosity and exploration directed toward them. When friends or lovers are freely chosen, partner-directed curiosity is likely to be endearing and might even predict the longevity and quality of the relationship. Future research can examine how the effects of curiosity on partners vary as a function of relationship type. The current work suggests there are parameters when curiosity goes awry. A better understanding of when strengths are underplayed or overplayed provides a dynamic element missing from superficial suggestions to aim for greater strength use (Linley et al., 2010).\n\nDespite the use of multiple methods, ranging from vignettes to experimental social interactions, without manipulating curiosity, it remains unclear whether felt closeness, interest self-regulatory strategies, and social motives are causally related. Unfortunately, interactions can only be manipulated for novelty and stimulation with major sacrifices to ecological validity (e.g., confederates). We collected reactions from actual social interaction partners to map person and situational influences (Kenny et al, 2007). Although people who are open and curious possess a behavioral repertoire relevant to transforming social situations to be interesting, this only served as a mediator in one of three studies. A caveat to these and several other results is the use of scales developed ad hoc for this research. Moreover, our tests of mediation failed to address temporality, as mechanisms were measured at the same time point as outcomes. Nonetheless, the current studies add depth to the phenomenology of how curious people think and behave in social situations. The convergence across methodological approaches conducted at different universities increases confidence in our findings. Addressing construct specificity with gender, physical attraction, and positive affect does not rule out other relevant, unmeasured variables that account for links between curiosity and positive social outcomes; this includes sociability and extraversion which in combination with curiosity, might be the ideal personality configuration to predict positive social outcomes.\n\nThe current studies focused on the role of curiosity in novel social situations. During relationship beginnings, curiosity and openness are particularly relevant because people are reasonably worried about being rejected. Uncertainty is high and although this might lead to the most intense, profound pleasures, it is also a springboard for excessive social anxiety. What might be most important are perceptions of partners' curiosity. Prior findings suggest that openness and curiosity are more visible to other people than other widely established personality traits (Carney, Colvin, & Hall, 2007).\n\nFuture studies might assess the role of curiosity in both novel and familiar social situations. Such research can lead to an understanding of the role of curiosity in everyday social life. Intentionally searching for new information in partners, and pursuing new experiences with partners, might serve as a natural, healthy intervention in existing, long-term relationships.\n\nThe current studies identify curiosity as a neglected ingredient in understanding positive social behavior and outcomes. Future research is needed to determine whether people high and low in curiosity differ in their efforts and success in maintaining successful relationships. To best understand the conditions for positive relationships, consideration must be given to the dynamic interplay between personality, situations, and social contexts. The current research is one of many to suggest erroneous conclusions if scientists only focused on a subset of these contributors to social functioning."
