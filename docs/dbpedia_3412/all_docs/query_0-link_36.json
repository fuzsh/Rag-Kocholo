        "text": "Facebook’s “Like” button is genius. It’s positive, affirmative, and gives an incredibly simple way to express support for content we enjoy. It requires no deep thought or time, yet sends a reinforcing signal to the poster. It also provides immediate feedback on what your group of friends in the aggregate enjoy.\n\nThose are nice perks, but the real value is that the button acts as a check on the overall quality and tone of Facebook content. Everyone wants to earn likes. But since there is (mercifully) no dislike button, you have to frame negative content up the right way to get liked. No one wants to click like on a story about a house burning down. But the same story, with a line or two about wishing the victims well, is easy to like. The inability to quickly display negative emotion towards a post forces the poster to position and comment on items in a way that makes light of frustrating events, or shows sympathy in tragedy.\n\nDeep, meaningful, terrible, sad and heavy content can and do still get posted. But there is an incentive to put these into some kind of context or perspective with a softer, human touch, or a fun-loving sarcasm that makes a like sensible. This structure is a valuable contribution that alters the ways in which humans talk about the events around us.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt is obvious how Facebook allows conversations to take place regardless of the distance between participants. Conversational threads between multiple parties in locations spread across the globe happen with more ease and efficiency than any conference call. An element of this new conversational dynamic that is easy to overlook is the way Facebook conquers not just space, but time.\n\nWhen you have a pint with someone and discuss matters of the day, sports, philosophy, or family, you’ve got the time allotted, and then you can mill it all over and process the implications of the conversation later. On the phone, you’ve got a a few seconds to reply to questions or to pose them. It would be awkward and disruptive to make your interlocutor wait for minutes or hours as you think over her comments before responding. Hanging up and calling back every few hours or days to complete the conversation in fragments is equally cumbersome. In many ways, time, rather than the flow of ideas, is in control of what gets covered. Facebook overcomes this constraint.\n\nOnline threads can begin anytime, and participants in the conversation can post immediately or hours, or days, or even weeks later. Everyone is notified, and everyone has the chance to let it sink in, go about the day’s business, and respond only when they have the time and their thoughts are clear. There are myriad conversation flowing at any given time, and you are free to enter and exit at will, around your schedule.\n\nThe ability to maintain relationships and social connections on your own schedule is incredibly freeing. It allows you to break your day into modules and specialize in particular activities when you are most capable of doing them well. I often lump all my social interactions for the day around lunchtime by browsing Facebook. I might be lying in bed that night when someone’s post pops into my head. I can post a comment immediately from my bedside smartphone, or wait until the next morning. The conversation’s not going anywhere.\n\nThe passive nature of Facebook, like email, is easy to manage and keep from being a disruption. But unlike email, Facebook has an open format where posts are directed at nobody in particular, so you can freely enter or exit the stream. It may seem like a recipe for shallow relationships and flighty social bonds, but I have not found this to be the case. Facebook is not replacing dinner with my family, or a phone call with my brother, or a funny text with a good friend; it is supplementing them. It opens entirely new groups of people to socialize and share ideas with; people who, if only phone or in-person meetings were available, I would realistically never have the ability to get to know. What’s really cool is that, if you so choose, you can form in-person relationships with these people at any time and much of the small talk is already out of the way. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve met fellow travelers at events and been completely unsure whether we’d ever met in the flesh before, because we know each other so well from Facebook.\n\nYour social life is in your own hands like never before. You are no longer bound to friendships of happenstance – who happens to move in next store, or share an office – but can build various overlapping social circles based on your genuine and dynamic interests. Of course you’ll still talk to the neighbor. But if they happen to be crazy or uninteresting, that’s not your only option. You’re free from the constraints of proximity. Neither are your forced to get all your catching up done during those difficult to schedule windows when both parties are free. You’re free from the constraints of time.\n\nThis new way to interact might seem like a fun little perk for your personal pleasure, but does it really have transformational power over society? Consider the efficiencies in knowledge capture and transmission and the ease and individual control with which social capital can be built and maintained. The freedom from time and place in the social arena has staggering implications if you ponder and let it sink in.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI love Facebook. It’s a great way to connect to people I enjoy communicating with, see new ideas and articles, enjoy social diversions during the day (when you work from home it can replace the water cooler), and of course keep up on memes and videos of cats. But there is another function of Facebook I didn’t foresee that has become increasingly valuable. It does something news outlets can’t do – respond to exactly what I’m interested in at the moment and give me stories about it.\n\nA few weeks back I realized it had been some time since I read or watched anything about new advances in science and technology. I remembered the excitement I got as a kid looking at Popular Mechanics magazine, and wanted to get that thrill again by hearing the coolest stuff now within the realm of possibility. I could have gone to any number of news outlets and browsed the technology section. I could have gone to tech specific magazines or websites. But these don’t always have articles on the most cutting edge stuff, and if I picked the wrong day, I might get a story about a new app instead. It would require some browsing. I could use Google, but Google is best when you know what you want to find, and I was looking for something I didn’t know existed. In short, I needed to be inspired by the creative power of mankind, and I had no where to turn for a quick overview.\n\nI posted an open-ended question on Facebook: What are the coolest things going on in science and technology? Within a few hours I had dozens of amazing articles, video clips, pictures and stories of everything from 3D burrito printers, to graphene smart phones, to particle accelerators, etc. ad nauseam. Not only that, the responses were from people who knew something about me and could add some humor, flavor, or insight no other outlet could. There was even some friendly competition over what was truly the best innovation going. I’ve only read through half of the things posted thus far, but I still go back to the thread from time to time to be further amazed.\n\nNews outlets and periodicals can produce great stories. The problem is, they have no way of knowing when I’m going to be in the mood for the latest trend in herb gardening or the latest adventure sport. They publish such pieces, but most of the time my interests don’t intersect with their schedule. Sure, they archive them, but there’s no good way for me to access the info unless I already know exactly what I want to read. Enter Facebook. Now it’s like every one of my digital acquaintances work for me. I can outsource the article reading, categorizing and rating to a few thousand people I find interesting. They enjoy the chance to share their interests, and I get the benefit of good stories without wading through all the other fluff. I do the same for them.\n\nI’ve got a lot more to say about Facebook, but I’ll save it for another post. I am of the opinion that we haven’t fully internalized how radical is the shift in social order wrought by Facebook. We have yet to appreciate the tremendous impact on every facet of social and commercial life. The layers are many.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
