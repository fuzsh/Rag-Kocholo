        "text": "I remember when I was told to network, I would freak out. Networking was hard, especially for an introvert like me. The stories I kept telling myself in my head were a lot scarier than the reality of #networking. Until I decided to do networking my way. I started with what I know best - and that is always ME. I started with what I know to build my networking muscle AND THEN I expanded to other arenas. Below is a list of 5 places to network in-person (listed in order of easiest for ME and then more challenging). 1) 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩: I was attending my place of worship every Sunday. When I was trying to network, I purposely chose to sit in a different part of the building each time, so when we're asked to welcome our neighbor, I was forced to speak to different people each time. I built a larger Church community this way. 2) 𝐆𝐲𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐠𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨. Similarly, I moved my yoga mat to different parts of the yoga studio. I also tried to go to the gym at different hours of the day to see and try and speak to different people. Because silence is expected in the yoga room, this was a little more challenging. I would say hi, and then after class, speak to the person(s) in the non-quiet spaces. 3) 𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐩𝐬. I got on the Meetup app and searched keywords and/or activies that I was interested in. I pushed myself to go to meetups and meet new people. 4) 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞. Even though I am an introvert, I do like to socialize. Similarly, to eventbrite, I did a search on keywords or topics that I was interested in. For instance, some of my searches included \"Latina/o, women in business, tech, etc.\". If there were nearby events that interested me, I went. 5) 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞. Your local of chamber of commerce often hosts events that you can attend, even as a non-member (there may be a small fee). But, this was also a great way for me to meet the business owners and such in my town, strengthening my local personal and professional brand. Oftentimes, when local nonprofits or organizations are looking for bilingual team members or ways to market to the Latino demographic, they reach out to me. I encourage you to come up with your own list of places to network, especially if networking is daunting to you. Make it work for you, until your confidence increases and you begin to expand your circle of influence. What would be on your list? Let me know in the comments. #thecareergem #networkingtips #executivecoach ________________ Hi! I'm Yanira. I help Latinas own their expertise, and position themselves for their next role, earning more income for themselves, their families, and their communities. Reach out to me.\n\nAWNN INSIGHTS: Daily Shift Journal - Engaging With Community Through Organized Events *Quote of the Day:* \"The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.\" - Coretta Scott King Reflecting on the importance of nurturing supportive communities, today’s focus is on engaging with your community through organized events.

Born out of the \"The Student\" class facilitated by Joseph Luckett and Jeanne Hamra, this groundbreaking event provided a comprehensive look at the myriad business networking opportunities available, with 18 different types of organizations represented under one roof. The event's mission? Answering that burning question: \"What networking options exist for me as 'The Networker', no matter where I live?\" By hosting a crash course on multiple organizations at once, attendees could explore the various civic, women-based, international, community, and niche networking groups. The energy in the room was palpable and magical, with an incredibly diverse crowd reflecting the event's powerful mission of inclusion. As one attendee remarked, \"I love that everyone can walk into this room and see someone that looks like them!\" The lineup of speakers represented a true cross-section of networking organizations: 1. Andrew John Chao - International Rotary 2. Nikki Lemley - Civic Chambers of Commerce 3. Dexter Enders - Non-Profit Lions Club 4. Mary Vaughan - Community Kiwanis 5. Salena Mikos - Referral-based BNI 6. Anna Broeder Alt - Women's Little Black Book 7. Mark Hollander - Community Vision Leadership 8. MrsKesh Speaks - Education Toastmasters Their expertise and passion for empowering others through networking was evident. Dr. Amy Narishkin set the inclusive tone by speaking on how to connect across differences. While many Caucasian attendees were already familiar with the featured groups, the revelations for underrepresented communities like Asian, Indian, Hispanic, Bosnian, and African attendees were life-changing. As one shared, \"Our communities have never heard of any of these organizations! This event opened our eyes and can truly change our businesses and help our families greatly.\" The booths representing diverse sponsors like Hispanic and African Chambers, Women's Councils, and networking groups buzzed with connections. The cliques dissipated as people organically mingled. The event's success sparked excitement for future iterations with improvements like: - More open networking time - Larger room for mingling - Nametags for all - Shared itinerary - Refreshments As one attendee summarized: \"I learned a ton, met wonderful new people, and reconnected with long-unseen friends. The speakers were fantastic...their work empowers us all.\" The \"One Roof Many Networks\" event truly transformed networking through its celebration of our diversity and shared humanity. A heartfelt thank you to the speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and all who attended!

Karen Fox Martha Garcia Kampen\n\nInspired by Tamar Beck’s recent post, it got me thinking about inclusion, accessibility, and belonging at professional networking events and networking moments at events… When we hear \"inclusion,\" I think we often default to thinking about diversity initiatives and representation quotas. But in reality, it's much simpler than that, it's just about making sure that every person feels seen, heard, and valued for who they are and what they bring to the table. 🤝 I’ll let you in on a secret, I loathe traditional networking events. For introverts like me, they can feel inauthentic, draining and pointless. The pressure to navigate crowded rooms, engage in endless small talk, and collect business cards can be seriously dry. Though I recognise that networking events/ activities are still essential for making connections, sharing ideas, and driving our careers forward. 💼 But why can’t we shake things up a bit? I’d love to see networking that was all about celebrating diverse experiences, prioritising accessibility, and creating a sense of belonging. Instead of counting how many business cards we've collected, we could focus on the quality of our connections—those meaningful genuine and authentic conversations that leave a lasting impression. 🌈 Personally I think that’s much more beneficial to businesses and careers. However.. none of this matters if we don't create an environment where everyone feels like they belong. I've been to too many networking events where cliques dominate the scene, making it nearly impossible to break in. And let me tell you, as someone who's been on the outside looking in, it's not a great feeling. 🙅♀️ 💡 Lastly a PSA - Making assumptions about someone based on their job title, role, gender,sexuality or background is a surefire way to miss out on valuable connections. Bust the cliques 💭 1. Choose venues/spaces that are accessible to everyone. 2. Not everyone thrives in loud, crowded environments, provide quiet areas for networking too 3. Provide conversation starters or discussion prompts to help attendees engage in meaningful exchanges beyond surface-level small talk 4, I’ve seen some events do this - Offer Networking Buddies, especially for those who may be attending events alone or for the first time. ✨ Other things I’ve seen and like include the speed networking, small-group discussions or breakout sessions, networking bingo , collaborative workshops,virtual networking, peer mentoring sessions and Interactive demos or exhibits ✨ I know that none of these ideas are unique or mind blowing. But some times we need a reminder to shake it up a bit. #Networking #NetworkingEvents #EventProfs\n\n𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤: 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: Get involved in your field by attending conferences, workshops, seminars, and networking events.

The secret to building and growing your network over time is persistent follow-up.\n\nLast week at our SDF Bristol office we held our first (and I hope not only) Amey Consulting Women’s Networking Event. Now not being massive fan of networking scenarios myself, I decided that we would put a twist on it and play Networking Jenga! Networking that doesn’t feel like you’re networking…. Split into groups, each person had to pull a brick from the tower, if successful they answered a question from one of the cards. Highlights: - When called to help, our Senior Leadership Team answered with support and enthusiasm! As well as Female members of the SLT, we had a small number of Male SLT in attendance demonstrating allyship. - The women who came were incredible, they threw themselves fully into the event seemingly without hesitation. Consideration to be given that a number of (if not all) of them were pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone. - It was one of the only times in my career in this industry I had seen men outnumbered, which (sorry) I cheekily did enjoy. - The kindness of my managers and colleagues on the day that gave me lots of calming reassurances before and after the event (when my imposter syndrome was at full pelt!). If you haven’t already, I encourage you to organise a Women’s Networking Event, because: - It provides a setting where women do not have to adjust to being in a male dominated environment, enabling them to effectively maximise the advantages of such an event. - It enables the women to feel more confident about presenting themselves, asking questions, and promoting skills and ideas. - It provides the opportunity to meet other women with similar professional journeys and experiences, something in our industry we rarely get to do. - It provides an opportunity to meet members of the SLT which could lead to new opportunities, career advancement, and personal growth. This may be the first chance for those that have not had similar opportunities via graduate programmes and/or something similar. Thank you again to everyone that came! 😀\n\nBuild your Network of People ✔Attend networking events: Look for local networking events in your industry or area of interest. These events provide opportunities to meet new people and build relationships. ✔Join professional organizations: Joining a professional organization related to your field can help you connect with like-minded individuals and learn about industry trends. ✔Leverage social media: Use social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to connect with people in your industry. Join groups, participate in discussions, and share your expertise. ✔Attend conferences: Attending conferences is a great way to meet people in your industry and learn about new trends and best practices. ✔Volunteer: Volunteering for industry associations or non-profit organizations can help you meet new people and give back to your community at the same time. ✔ Follow up: After meeting someone at a networking event or conference, follow up with them via email or LinkedIn to maintain the connection. ✔Collaborate: Look for opportunities to collaborate with other professionals in your industry on projects or initiatives. This can help you build relationships and expand your network. ✔ Be authentic: When building relationships, be yourself and show genuine interest in the other person. People appreciate authenticity and are more likely to want to build a relationship with someone who is genuine. ✔Give back: Offer to help others in your network by sharing resources, making introductions, or providing advice. This can help you build goodwill and strengthen relationships over time. In conclusion, building a professional network requires a combination of proactive efforts and authentic interactions. Attending networking events, joining professional organizations, leveraging social media, attending conferences, volunteering, following up, collaborating, being authentic, and giving back are all effective strategies for expanding your network and cultivating meaningful relationships. By implementing these tactics consistently, you can build a strong professional network that will support your career growth and provide opportunities for collaboration and learning.\n\n😥 \"Networking events are awkward.\" In our recent poll, this is the feeling that our community most resonated with. Here are some tips that may help: 1. Identify your goal: Have a clear goal for attending an event. Whether it's to meet specific individuals, learn more about a certain industry or something else, having a purpose can make the experience more focused. 2. Prepare your introduction: Prepare a brief and engaging elevator pitch. This can help you to confidently start conversations without stumbling over your words. 3. Listen actively: Focus on what the other person is saying rather than worrying about what you'll say next. Active listening not only helps to build rapport but also takes the pressure off you to constantly come up with conversation topics. Look for shared interests, experiences or goals and how you can help them. 4. Volunteer: If the idea of mingling is uncomfortable, consider volunteering or actively participating in the event. This can give you a role and purpose beyond just networking. 5. Go beyond networking events: Networking is so much more than networking events. You could start by reconnecting with dormant ties, and meeting people based on warm referrals from your existing network. We look forward to sharing more posts to help you get more out of networking, while staying true to who you are... What types of people / industries are you looking to connect with? #Networking #CareerGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment\n\nI've observed some chatter this week, some related to NY Tech Week, other times not, about how the importance of networking is overstated. While it's true that a prior generation ruined networking by making it disorganized and transactional - with people only walking in when they needed something from others they perceived would be on hand - networking has the chance, like everything else within our business culture, to be reimagined and rebuilt now. And it has. More events are taking place year-round, smaller in size, with less emphasis on late hours and alcohol consumption, and additional, necessary curation to put the right people, not random ones, in the room together. An, finally, overall there's greater acceptance that these events indeed count as work amid a hybrid work setup that encourages people not to stick to one task, one desk. If someone wishes to grant themselves permission not to attend, they have it. They don't have to justify it aloud; we have all seen poorly-run networking events of the past that would shoo someone away then and lead them to shy away further. However, it's a misconception that we're still abiding by the traditional rules and rituals. NY Tech Week was electric - and I'll tell you why: Although I go to some events at the top and at the close of workdays, during that annual conference I look to connect with others in the middle of the day. Because my goal is really to identify ahead and during as many visitors in town for a few days ahead of natives to New York I could come across anytime. On Thursday, I attended my final NY Tech Week event, which took place 3-5 pm at a fully-rented East Midtown bar. The topic that day was \"growth strategy,\" ever on my mind. The first person I met was here from Boston. She struggled to summarize what she does for a living, usually a sign of a career that's had as many stops as starts. I took a seat. And I explained how I could assist. We wound up talking for all of the time leading up to the panel. We exchanged information, and I told her we should keep speaking after she returns home. I've sent her materials to read ahead of our call, which will take place tomorrow. She'll arrive prepared. It takes a lot to get someone who's between things to show up at all, much more so in a city not her own, and on that afternoon particularly amid a downpour. Where we turn up and when indicates what's important to us, even before we approach anyone to get active and to find out. So rather than complain about networking being stilted or stale, ask yourself not what you have to gain ahead of signing up and showing up, rather what you have to offer to others who might be in need of a boost. Not all networking is bad. I saw and met some of the best. The measure of success is how many people you'll elect to bring with you ahead. You don't have to carry a majority of those you met, yet the volume of what and who you uncover allows you to unearth precision with where you belong - and who with."
