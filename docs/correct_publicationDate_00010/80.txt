Robert Sheckley (1928-2005) was author of the novels Immortality, Inc., Dimension of Miracles, and Mindswap. Many of his novels and short stories were absurdist and showed a sense of dark humor. Sheckley’s story “The Seventh Victim” was made into the film The Tenth Victim. From 1980-1981, he served as the editor of OMNI Magazine. Before becoming an author, Sheckley worked as a landscape gardener, pretzel salesman, bartender, milkman, and at a hand-painted necktie studio. He served in the US Army in Korea as a guard, newspaper editor, and clerk. Following the army, he attended New York University and added to his lengthy list of off jobs, including metallurgist and aircraft factory worker before selling his first story to Imagination. In 2001, he was named Author Emeritus by the SFWA. He was awarded the Jupiter Award for A Suppliant in Space in 1974 and the Gallun Award in 1991. Sheckley was named guest of honor at 2005 Worldcon, Interaction, but was unable to attend due to health issues.
