        "text": "The Short Stories of Robert Sheckley\n\nVolume I\n\nRobert Sheckley was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 16th, 1928.\n\nAfter attending Columbia High School, and gaining a life-long passion for science fiction, he hitchhiked to California in 1946 where he tried various jobs; landscape gardener, pretzel salesman, barman, milkman, warehouseman, and general laborer board man in a hand-painted necktie studio.\n\nNone of these took him into a career path he wanted. His solution? He joined the US Army for two years.\n\nReturning to New York Sheckley enrolled at NYU from where he graduated in 1951 with a degree.\n\nWithin months he had also married (the first of five) and published his first short story in the pulp magazines.\n\nOver his career he wrote and published hundreds of short stories. Some were turned into movies, some to TV and of course many into radio drama.\n\nOn November 20th he had surgery for a brain aneurysm. Whilst still in hospital in a Poughkeepsie hospital Robert Sheckley died on December 9th, 2005.\n\nIndex of Contents\n\nWarrior Race\n\nDestroying the spirit of the enemy is the goal of war and the aliens had the best way!\n\nAsk a Foolish Question\n\nIt's well established now that the way you put a question often determines not only the answer you'll get, but the type of answer possible. So ... a mechanical answerer, geared to produce the ultimate revelations in reference to anything you want to know, might have unsuspected limitations.\n\nCost of Living\n\nIf easy payment plans were to be really efficient, patrons' lifetimes had to be extended!\n\nThe Leech (writing as Phillips Barbee)\n\nA visitor should be fed, but this one could eat you out of house and home ... literally!\n\nWatchbird\n\nStrange how often the Millennium has been at hand. The idea is peace on Earth, see, and the way to do it is by figuring out angles.\n\nThe Hour of Battle\n\nAs one of the Guardian ships protecting Earth, the crew had a problem to solve. Just how do you protect a race from an enemy who can take over a man's mind without seeming effort or warning?\n\nKeep Your Shape\n\nOnly a race as incredibly elastic as the Grom could have a single rule of war:\n\nOne Man's Poison\n\nThey could eat a horse, only luckily there was none ... it might have eaten them first!\n\nDeath Wish (writing as Ned Lang)\n\nCompared with a spaceship in distress, going to hell in a handbasket is roomy and slow!\n\nForever (writing as Ned Lang)\n\nOf all the irksome, frustrating, maddening discoveries, was there no way of keeping it discovered?\n\nRobert Sheckley – A Short Biography\n\nRobert Sheckley – A Concise Bibliography\n\nWarrior Race\n\nDestroying the spirit of the enemy is the goal of war and the aliens had the best way!\n\nThey never did discover whose fault it was. Fannia pointed out that if Donnaught had had the brains of an ox, as well as the build, he would have remembered to check the tanks. Donnaught, although twice as big as him, wasn't quite as fast with an insult. He intimated, after a little thought, that Fannia's nose might have obstructed his reading of the fuel gauge.\n\nThis still left them twenty light-years from Thetis, with a cupful of transformer fuel in the emergency tank.\n\nAll right, Fannia said presently. What's done is done. We can squeeze about three light-years out of the fuel before we're back on atomics. Hand me The Galactic Pilot, unless you forgot that, too.\n\nDonnaught dragged the bulky microfilm volume out of its locker, and they explored its pages.\n\nThe Galactic Pilot told them they were in a sparse, seldom-visited section of space, which they already knew. The nearest planetary system was Hatterfield; no intelligent life there. Sersus had a native population, but no refueling facilities. The same with Illed, Hung and Porderai.\n\nAh-ha! Fannia said. Read that, Donnaught. If you can read, that is.\n\nCascella, Donnaught read, slowly and clearly, following the line with a thick forefinger. Type M sun. Three planets, intelligent (AA3C) human-type life on second. Oxygen-breathers. Non-mechanical. Religious. Friendly. Unique social structure, described in Galactic Survey Report 33877242. Population estimate: stable at three billion. Basic Cascellan vocabulary taped under Cas33b2. Scheduled for resurvey 2375 A.D. Cache of transformer fuel left, beam coordinate 8741 kgl. Physical descript: Unocc. flatland.\n\nTransformer fuel, boy! Fannia said gleefully. I believe we will get to Thetis, after all. He punched the new direction on the ship's tape. If that fuel's still there.\n\nShould we read up on the unique social structure? Donnaught asked, still poring over The Galactic Pilot.\n\nCertainly, Fannia said. Just step over to the main galactic base on Earth and buy me a copy.\n\nI forgot, Donnaught admitted slowly.\n\nLet me see, Fannia said, dragging out the ship's language library, Cascellan, Cascellan ... Here it is. Be good while I learn the language. He set the tape in the hypnophone and switched it on. Another useless tongue in my overstuffed head, he murmured, and then the hypnophone took over.\n\nComing out of transformer drive with at least a drop of fuel left, they switched to atomics. Fannia rode the beam right across the planet, locating the slender metal spire of the Galactic Survey cache. The plain was no longer unoccupied, however. The Cascellans had built a city around the cache, and the spire dominated the crude wood-and-mud buildings.\n\nHang on, Fannia said, and brought the ship down on the outskirts of the city, in a field of stubble.\n\nNow look, Fannia said, unfastening his safety belt. We're just here for fuel. No souvenirs, no side-trips, no fraternizing.\n\nThrough the port, they could see a cloud of dust from the city. As it came closer, they made out figures running toward their ship.\n\nWhat do you think this unique social structure is? Donnaught asked, pensively checking the charge in a needler gun.\n\nI know not and care less, Fannia said, struggling into space armor. Get dressed.\n\nThe air's breathable.\n\nLook, pachyderm, for all we know, these Cascellans think the proper way to greet visitors is to chop off their heads and stuff them with green apples. If Galactic says unique, it probably means unique.\n\nGalactic said they were friendly.\n\nThat means they haven't got atomic bombs. Come on, get dressed. Donnaught put down the needler and struggled into an oversize suit of space armor. Both men strapped on needlers, paralyzers, and a few grenades.\n\nI don't think we have anything to worry about, Fannia said, tightening the last nut on his helmet. Even if they get rough, they can't crack space armor. And if they're not rough, we won't have any trouble. Maybe these gewgaws will help. He picked up a box of trading articles, mirrors, toys and the like.\n\nHelmeted and armored, Fannia slid out the port and raised one hand to the Cascellans. The language, hypnotically placed in his mind, leaped to his lips.\n\nWe come as friends and brothers. Take us to the chief.\n\nThe natives clustered around, gaping at the ship and the space armor. Although they had the same number of eyes, ears and limbs as humans, they completely missed looking like them.\n\nIf they're friendly, Donnaught asked, climbing out of the port, why all the hardware? The Cascellans were dressed predominantly in a collection of knives, swords and daggers. Each man had at least five, and some had eight or nine.\n\nMaybe Galactic got their signals crossed, Fannia said, as the natives spread out in an escort. Or maybe the natives just use the knives for mumblypeg.\n\nThe city was typical of a non-mechanical culture. Narrow, packed-dirt streets twisted between ramshackle huts. A few two-story buildings threatened to collapse at any minute. A stench filled the air, so strong that Fannia's filter couldn't quite eradicate it. The Cascellans bounded ahead of the heavily laden Earthmen, dashing around like a pack of playful puppies. Their knives glittered and clanked.\n\nThe chief's house was the only three-story building in the city. The tall spire of the cache was right behind it.\n\nIf you come in peace, the chief said when they entered, you are welcome. He was a middle-aged Cascellan with at least fifteen knives strapped to various parts of his person. He squatted cross-legged on a raised dais.\n\nWe are privileged, Fannia said. He remembered from the hypnotic language lesson that chief on Cascella meant more than it usually did on Earth. The chief here was a combination of king, high priest, deity and bravest warrior.\n\nWe have a few simple gifts here, Fannia added, placing the gewgaws at the king's feet. Will his majesty accept?\n\nNo, the king said. We accept no gifts. Was that the unique social structure? Fannia wondered. It certainly was not human. We are a warrior race. What we want, we take.\n\nFannia sat cross-legged in front of the dais and exchanged conversation with the king while Donnaught played with the spurned toys. Trying to overcome the initial bad impression, Fannia told the chief about the stars and other worlds, since simple people usually liked fables. He spoke of the ship, not mentioning yet that it was out of fuel. He spoke of Cascella, telling the chief how its fame was known throughout the Galaxy.\n\nThat is as it should be, the chief said proudly. We are a race of warriors, the like of which has never been seen. Every man of us dies fighting.\n\nYou must have fought some great wars, Fannia said politely, wondering what idiot had written up the galactic report.\n\nI have not fought a war for many years, the chief said. We are united now, and all our enemies have joined us.\n\nBit by bit, Fannia led up to the matter of the fuel.\n\nWhat is this 'fuel'? the chief asked, haltingly because there was no equivalent for it in the Cascellan language.\n\nIt makes our ship go.\n\n\"And where"
