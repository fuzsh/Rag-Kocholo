        "text": "What pre-1985 science fiction are you reading or planning to read this month? Here’s January’s installment of this column.\n\nWhen I’m not reading science fiction, I’m more often than not devouring history that touches on my decades of focus: 1945-1985. Recently that’s meant lots and lots of monographs on Cold War culture: from fallout shelters, suburbia, to analysis of the drama of morality and terror that characterized nuclear deterrence. And in Guy Oakes’ transfixing The Imaginary War: Civil Defense and American Cold War Culture (1994), I came across a fascinating collision of science fictional thought and public policy.\n\nA few months into Dwight D. Eisenhower’s presidency, the Public Affairs Office of the Federal Civil Defense Administration released a short pamphlet that analyzed the “relation between national will and nuclear terror” under the ridiculous title “Civil Defense Implications of the Psychological Impact and Morale Effect of Attacks on the People of the United States” (April 1953). In this pamphlet, the authors imagine the effects of nuclear war. They suggest that some survivors would “isolate themselves from the terrifying consequences of nuclear war by effecting a pseudo-escape into an interior psychological reality.” I thought immediately of Richard Matheson’s brilliant “Pattern for Survival” (1955), in which a SF author reenacts the process of writing and publishing a story to escape the reality in which he lives. The pamphleteers further imagine a political reality dominated by “mystical sects and cults, enthralled by the vision of an immeasurably happier future in an inner fantasy life of an extramundane kingdom of bliss that transcended the brutal empirical reality of nuclear destruction” (41). Early Cold War policy makers and consultants as science fiction authors!\n\n50s paranoid future visions aside, let’s turn to the books in the photo and what I’ve been reading and writing about.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Strange Ports of Call, ed. August Derleth (1948)\n\nFrom the back cover: “‘Begotten of Imagination, on the body of Technology, there springs forth the wild child Science Fiction.’ –Clifton Fadiman\n\nThe above is one of the many attempts that have been made to describe a department of fiction which, in spite of some sniping critics, continues to increase its followers. Recently Bertrand Russell observed that science fiction consists of ‘intelligent anticipation–much more intelligent than the expectations of statesmen.’\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Ahead of Time, Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore (1953)\n\nFrom the inside page: “A brain in a box fights a criminal plot\n\nA visitor from the future turns out to be peculiar even for his society\n\nAn eternal hillbilly family survives the centuries and gets into political trouble\n\nA sick electronic calculator catches a psychosis from its operator\n\n…these are some of the highly original and vividly written stories you will find in this selection of a master’s work.\n\nScience fiction and fantasy grow constantly in popularity. Writing of this quality and imagination is the reason. Henry Kuttner demonstrates again in his book why more and more readers are becoming devotees of that intriguing fiction which is not content to stay in the world as we see it and know it, which takes us to the farthest reaches of space and time, to the farthest reaches of the human mind.”\n\nContinue reading →\n\n(Pompeo Posar’s cover for the 1st edition)\n\n3/5 (collated rating: Average)\n\n“The dead astronaut: The phrase is filled with anxiety, the words themselves evoking the tension and anguish that gripped the whole world in that fateful month of April 1970, when a technical malfunction came close to costing the lives of astronauts Lovell, Swigert and Haise” (5).\n\nThe Dead Astronaut (1971) contains a range of 50s and 60s SF stories—from Ursula K. Le Guin to J. G. Ballard—on the broad theme of astronauts, that appeared in Playboy Magazine. For a reader of genre for only the last decade (and a bit), it’s shocking to consider that Playboy, at one point, contained top-notch science fiction! That aside, The Dead Astronaut contains a range of soft and hard science fictional accounts of astronauts Continue reading →\n\nYes (I see inquisitive phantom stares), I listened to an audiobook written in this decade. And it was good. Very good. Brilliant actually. As it was an audiobook, I’m unable to write an in-depth review. However there are plenty online for the curious–in part because it won the 2015 Nebula Award. I added two additional novels that have been waiting patiently in a “to review” pile that are more my standard territory…\n\nThink of these short reviews as tantalizing fragments rather than my normal analysis. The books that reside in these short review posts often defeated my reviewing capabilities.\n\n1. The Müller-Fokker Effect, John Sladek (1970)\n\n(McInnery’s cover for the 1972 edition)\n\n4.25/5 (Very Good)\n\nIn my 2016 in review I promised to read more of Sladek’s work, and for once I’m holding true to my reading goals.\n\nThat said, I find Sladek’s novels notoriously difficult to parse into cohesive reviews—his SF (and my reviews by extension) stretch satirically in all directions, unfolding in fascinating experiments that jest with layered wordplay and (often) diagrammatic dalliances (see example below). There’s a humorous Continue reading →\n\nSeptember will be a slow month, my apologies in advance. The review backlog grows and grows–reviews of Poul Anderson’s Tau Zero (1970) and The Best SF Stories from New Worlds #2 (1968) should be appearing soon. Although, there are many unreviewed volumes less fresh on my memory…\n\nAt least I have a massive review INDEX to keep you all busy.\n\nI am diligently posting all the KWG volumes I snagged from a local Half Price Books—this shadowy person had a spectacular collection.\n\nI am rarely interested in SF series, but, I’ll make an exception as Suzy McKee Charnas’ Walk to the End of the World (1974) was so darn amazing!\n\nMore Sheckley!\n\nMore Tucker! Fresh off the very satisfying The Long Loud Silence (1952)…\n\nAnd finally, a novel from an author I’ve never read before—Alfred Coppel.\n\nAs always, thoughts/comments are welcome.\n\n1. Motherlines, Suzy McKee Charnas (1978)\n\n(Doug Beekman’s very bland cover for the 1979 edition) Continue reading →\n\nI can’t pass up a Sheckley collection!\n\nNor can I pass up a rather unknown “discovered manuscript” type 1960s feminist dystopia by Marya Mannes. She wrote for Vogue and The New Yorker over her career….\n\nNor can I pass up a Sturgeon collection (perhaps I will appreciate his more radical SF short stories?)….\n\nAnd finally, a best of collection by an author who might not be worth exploring, but, sometimes short stories give a better impression of an author’s capabilities than a novel-length work.\n\nAs always, thoughts/observations/comments are welcome!\n\n1. They, Marya Mannes (1968)\n\n(Stanley Zuckerberg’s cover for the 1970 edition) Continue reading →\n\nDespite my incredible busyness my reading of SF has not slowed that heavily as I find it a relaxing activity before bed. There is a chance (time permitting) that I will post (two paragraph?) mini-reviews of such gems as Disch’s Camp Concentration (1968) + Lafferty’s intriguing Past Master (1968) + Mann’s Wulfsyarn (1990) et alii in the coming weeks in order to get caught up (I haven’t been in more than a year)…\n\nThat said, I am still working through my recent acquisition posts for a stack of books that have slowly come in over the last few months. More psychological SF via Wilhelm, a Mars novel originally in German, a collection of 50s – 80s short SF by an unsung master (according to some), and Sheckley at his most bizarre…\n\nThree of the following novels came via Carl at Stainless Steel Droppings on his book store trip… Grateful as always for his book hunting skills on his travels and willingness to send me a large box (and paypal bill! — haha).\n\nThoughts?\n\n1. The Earth is Near, Ludek Pesek (1970, English trans. 1973)\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1974 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(William Hofmann’s cover for the 1964 edition)\n\n4/5 (collated rating: Good)\n\nFilth. Decay. Mud. Transmutation. Brian W. Aldiss’ SF is filled with such images: Men—with limbs removed—who are slowly (and artificially) transmuted into fish, writhe around in the mud of their tanks grasping at the last shards of their humanity; A powerful matriarch lords over a planet where her pets transform at will; A tall tale about a planet filled with strange life and a human hero who cannot get over the fact that everything smells like garbage…. Aldiss’ novel The Dark Light-Years (1964), despite its poor delivery, is the best example of these themes—humans encounter sentient aliens who spend their days copulating, laying around, and eating in their own fifth. And they are happy with their lot.\n\nStarswarm (1964) is comprised of three novelettes and five short stories with conjoining explanatory material that links the previously published short fiction into a cohesive collection. The modus operandi of such a conjoining concerns the “Theory of Multigrade Superannuation” where “the universe is similar to the cosmic clock; the civilizations of man are not mere cogs but infinitely smaller clocks, ticking in their own right” (7). Thus, the inhabited solar systems of Starswarm—our galaxy—will exhibit all the characteristics through which a civilization can Continue reading →"
