        "text": "Another varied selection of recent acquisitions—the majority are gifts from Carl V. Anderson at Stainless Steel Droppings. Thanks so much! A signed edition of Hal Clement’s Close to Critical (1964) is coming your way!\n\nI love Sheckley. I’ve never read Richard Matheson’s short fiction. Terry Carr’s short fiction is supposedly rather good (he’s primarily known as an editor of course). And Avram Davidson is still an unknown quantity—I do adore the Leo and Diane Dillon cover.\n\nThoughts?\n\n1. Third From the Sun, Richard Matheson (1955)\n\n(Gene Szafran’s horrid cover for the 1970 edition)\n\nFrom the back cover: “Extraordinary, hair-raising science fiction that makes you believe you are there! Meet Loolie from Venus—she ads in mags for mates with like fixtures!\n\nMove with the time traveler to a civilization where dirty post-cards are pictures of… food!\n\nRide on the last space ship leaving… for earth!\n\nFall in love with Lover—she wants to wrap her warm, pink mind around yours!\n\nLive dangerously and adventurously with Richard Matheson who can make the unbelievable seem true.”\n\n2. Untouched by Human Hands, Robert Sheckley (1954)\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1967 edition)\n\nFrom the back cover for a different edition: “These thirteen tales, untouched even by the hands of anthologists, may remind some of you of the brightest days of ‘Unknown Worlds,’ and others of Shirley Jackson or John Collier. Some are interplanetary, some supernatural; some chilling, some comic. All are delightfully fresh in concept, development and writing.”\n\n3. The Light at the End of the Universe, Terry Carr (1976)\n\n(Mike Presley’s cover for the 1976 edition)\n\nFrom the back cover: “After 13 years as the most popular editor in SF, the incredible talent of Terry Carr is ‘Discovered.” He has been called the editor with impeccable taste, the man who knows which stories will be Hugo and Nebula award winners months before he puts them in his justly-famous BEST SF OF THE YEAR series. But the shadow-life of Terry Carr is a side of him the millions of readers of his collections seem unaware exists. He is the creator of new universes, new worlds that rival the finest creations he has anthologized. He is a fantasist of the first rank. Now, at last, Carr emerges from the closet with his first book of stories; fifteen magicks of the mind that comprise, quite simply, one of the best books of SF and fantasy you will be ever privileged to read.”\n\n4. The Phoenix and the Mirror, Avram Davidson (1969)\n\n(Diane and Leo Dillon’s cover for the 1969 edition)\n\nFrom the inside flap: “Against the backdrop of a hauntingly familiar yet unpredictable otherworld, Avram Davidson casts the adventures of the sorcerer known as Vergil Magus: Vergil’s first goal was to construct a mirror that had never before reflected a human face. It was an almost impossible task, but when it was finally completed the face that appeared on the mirror’s surface was that of Princess Laura of Carsus, and Vergil fell in love with her beautiful reflection. But to find and win the Princess herself, Vergil had to undertake a long and hazardous journey… and at the end of it he would meet the demon power of the Phoenix itself.”"
