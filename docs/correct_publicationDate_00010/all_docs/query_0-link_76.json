        "text": "The Science Fiction Collection at Houghton Library consists largely of 20th-century trade paperbacks, magazines, fanzines, and prozines. Established as a discrete collection in 1957, it complements the Rev. Francis G. Peabody Utopian Literature Collection, as well as the library’s individual author collections of such writers as Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Edward Bellamy.\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing the death of his son, junior Richard “Dick” W. Clarkson (Class of 1955), Paul S. Clarkson donated Dick’s collection of science fiction books to the Harvard University Library. The collection was curated by Lauriston Ward, curator of Asiatic Archaeology at the Peabody Museum, and a keen science-fiction fan. He was assisted by G. William Cottrell Jr., research associate in ornithology at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and founding editor of the Harvard Library Bulletin.\n\nWard and Cottrell arranged a space for the collection within Houghton Library and solicited gifts to grow it, adding many volumes from their own libraries.\n\nAcquisitions declined following Ward’s death and Cottrell’s departure from the Harvard Library Bulletin, both in 1960, and ceased altogether by 1972.\n\nIn 2009, funding from the Ruth Miller Memorial Philanthropic Fund enabled the library to catalog the collection, making it available to readers for the first time.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe collection includes many works of science fiction, fantasy, and horror by both well-known and lesser-known authors, including:\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nJohn Brunner\n\nMurray Leinster\n\nEric Frank Russell\n\nRobert Sheckley\n\nRoy Sheldon\n\nRobert Silverberg\n\nClifford D. Simak\n\nE.E. Smith\n\nGeorge O. Smith\n\nJerry Sohl\n\nVargo Statten\n\nTheodore Sturgeon\n\nJohn Taine\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\nE.C. Tubb\n\nWilson Tucker\n\nA.E. Van Vogt\n\nJean-Gaston Vandel\n\nJules Verne\n\nStanley Grauman Weinbaum\n\nH.G. Wells\n\nDennis Wheatley\n\nJack Williamson\n\nS. Fowler Wright\n\nJohn Wyndham\n\nMaterial in the collection dates from the 1880s to the present and also includes numerous anthologies and runs of nearly 200 science fiction periodicals.\n\nThe collection also contains collections of fanzines, prozines, and APAs (amateur press association publications): the general collection, covering 1939–1971; that formed by William Wilson Goodson Jr., 1970–2008; and the New England Science Fiction Association APAs.\n\nRecent additions to the collection include The Star Trek Guide, a handbook detailing everything an aspiring writer needed to know write a script for the series.
