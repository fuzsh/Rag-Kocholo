        "text": "[This intro is copyright © 1991 Robert Sheckley. Appeared in Rudy Rucker’s anthology Transreal! (WCS Books 1991.) ]\n\nWe wonder if the average reader of this work knows the origin of the name Rucker. It is from the Sanskrit, and it means “To Tuck In Your Shirt Carelessly.” There is a story attached to this, as there is to so many things. Excuse me now as 1 walk out to the end of the diving board. The water looks still and cold and dark down there, and god knows what’s lying just under the surface, but here goes anyhow. To Ruck was used in an earlier, more innocent age as a term for rummaging around in a knapsack. Back in those Sanskrit days of yore the knapsacks weren’t like the ones we have today, all nylon and canvas and cunning metals. No, primeval knapsacks back then were large straw baskets and you could carry a lot of objects in them, and you could easily lose one or more of these objects when you rooted or rucked around for them in a hurry, as on a dark night, for example, when the wolves had just caught your scent and you were forced to give up your preoccupation with what the hell you’re doing there in the first place in order to do something about your situation. So you ruck around in your knapsack, and you come up with the perfect instrument —\n\nA barrel-organ.\n\n— Now just a minute. Did we hear you correctly? A barrel-organ, did you say? And in what way does that image relate to Rucker, the Rucking One, or is it an adventitious invention which you have brought in to reveal the vacuity of your understanding, and as a way of excusing the gray fur on your soft white underbelly?\n\nPeople don’t usually think of these things, and there’s no way of knowing if Rucker thinks of them or not. Indeed, there have been those who claim that Rucker doesn’t think at all, in the way most of us under­stand the word, though perhaps I’m mistaking parties of the first part with steam bends in a daffodil moment, to use a favorite expression from Rucker’s daffy duck phase of drug intoxication.\n\nIt’s all right, I’m feeling better now. Don’t bother to read this next section because I’m going to cut it. 1 just put it in here because — you know how days like this come along? — the softness of dawn, the sharp­ness of bacon — nothing makes any sense, they even put the river in the wrong place, and here you are thinking delirium is a fit topic for audi­ences of all ages. Well, that’s your problem. Now stop breathing so heavy and let’s get on with it. As we said, we are going to cut this anyhow. If 1 had time I could summarize what is going to come down here so you wouldn’t have to waste your time reading what is not going to be retained anyhow — appearances to the contrary — but there is no time for witless waiting, there is only effort and fatigue, and the constant rolling of the roulette circuits in my brain, which produce this crazed fandango of pseudo-felicitous phraseology, words which, in Hegel’s pregnant phrase, are mere pomposity in the service of the trivial, and turn instead to something serious, as for example, what the entity RS will have for lunch today.\n\nAnd so I’m sitting here in this poodle of sunlight with Rudy’s book in my hand, and I take a moment to steady myself so 1 can say anything to you about it, although first I have to fashion a speaking-instrument as well as something to say through it. Rudy brings us back to primordial matters. A writer’s first problem is how to write. His second is how to write a story. His third is how to write about himself.\n\nLet’s go to that third problem now. We’ll take up the others in due course, but perhaps in a different location, so stay tuned in to see where the Sheckley viewpoint show is going to appear next. Right now we sing Rucker.\n\nRucker reminds me a little of Jean Genet as portrayed by Sartre. Genet however is a real bad-ass and Rucker just wishes he were. And since wishes are king, just wishing makes him a little badder than he might otherwise be. Anyhow we don’t have to tangle this up with them French cats, it’s just that Europe peers uneasily over Ruckers shoulder saying things in a soft scolding German-accented voice. Luckily we can cut this all out afterward as we go on with this introduction. But what are we introducing? Let’s call it a sensibility. That’s what we sell nowadays, really. All the adventures are over, novelty’s end has finally been reached, what’s ahead of suppurating superficiality, but we go on anyway because the nights are long and the sweet beckoning fair one has vanished or turned indifferent and you have to do something between light and light and so you write a story. Rucker knows this very well and is surrealist enough to try to derange his head to the point where a story can be written. Because you see Rucker knows that a story can’t really be written, and a man can’t write about trying to write a story either. So I sit here in my poodle of sunlight and tell you these things.\n\nIn a way I suppose 1 think that 1 believe that an introduction to a book such as this is in actuality a mirroring of the text in my own sensibility. 1 carry this big old flashing headlight around with me wherever I go, and it is for the express purpose of mirroring, which is itself a way of saying something that I couldn’t otherwise say. An introduction is a response to a text. And that response may be an attack, whatever turns you on. And so I say to you, this piece of work stands on its own as well, in fact, you might as well know the truth, Rucker’s text is actually an introduction to my text, which we are calling an introduction for the purpose of confus­ing the stupid reader and leaving him with the feeling that he has egg on his face.\n\nNo, no, lady, don’t leave yet, I’ll calm down, this paragraph really does have a subject, we’re going to reach it any moment now, stay cool.\n\nRucker’s manuscript arrived today. I had already noted down my reaction to it earlier, when I imagined the event. The real event is what happens in your head. Or, more precisely, what you tell people happens in your head. 1 seem to have lost what 1 wrote earlier. Never mind, second time is more convincing.\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that I’m extemporizing. It’s a dilemma, writing this sort of thing. I’ve gotten along all right so far with taking over Sheckley’s name and his reputation, such as it is. But writing an introduc­tion — especially since it is already understood that I’ll do it in “my own inimitable style” — whatever in hell that is. But if I try it and fail — the likeliest alternative — 1 run the risk of being exposed as the charlatan I am, a person who has no name of his own and has criminally taken over the persona of a famous author who is not himself with us any longer for reasons to be disclosed at a more propitious occasion.\n\nWhat is Rucker trying to do to me? Why did he select me for this job? Why is he seeking to undermine me with his mind-experiment, why does he want to invade my mind with the contents of his trashy situ­ations, with the faecid droppings of his clever simian mind?\n\nThese days I see no one in person, but am willing to conduct dream appointments in Paris. It seems a better place for conducting an interview than many I’ve seen. I asked Rudy to take a seat. I had invited him to one of my favorite watering places, the Piecea Sheet on the rue Regret. “Rudy,” I said, “what ever gave you the conception for this book?”\n\nRudy’s attention was not present, his gaze was unfocused. His eyes, brown, soft, indistinct, with hairy pupils, had in them a feigned look of the faraway. For a moment I feared for our foreign policy. The very idea that this man was secretly in charge of our government was ludicrous. But I think we all know what politicians are. It was only necessary to speak in a firm voice and avoid trailing participles. The rest was, if not silence, at least not very noisy.\n\n“Quarkonium,” breathed Harry, “I kept some back from the last shipment. It’s a cross between matter and anti-matter. Last week I ran it through some high-energy vacuum sputtering to build up a fractal surface-geometry…”\n\nThis is sf rigorously following crazy rules. My mind of science fiction. This is what Rucker does. Among other things. At the heart of it all is a rage to extrapolate. Excuse me, shall I extrapolate that for you? Won’t take a jiffy.. . And so we have it. Rudy the crazed mathematician, like a poet hidden in the light of thought singing songs unbidden ’til the world is wrought to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not… That’s Shelley talking about some far-out guy — himself, 1 suspect. But he could have been sizing up Rucker.\n\nMy own relationship to all this is easily explained. I don’t understand science or math but I like to hear a good horn man take off on a good old theme. I like to hear them dotted fractals breaking high off the main melody. And that’s what Rucker does. He’s basically a jazz man, you see.\n\nHe’s what happens when you cross a mathematician with the extrapolat­ing jazz spirit.\n\nIt is endearing how Rucker believes so fervently in fucking up his mind with drugs. It’s all in the service of the muse, Nietzsche’s “Now do I see myself underneath myself” (if memory serves) from Zarathustra. It’s all in the service of the muse, all for art, ars mathematica and suddenly the picture comes clear…\n\n“We had a nice culture of DNA-doctored slime-mold growing under the hood. The stuff absorbed carbon dioxide, gave off oxygen, and tasted more or less like tuna fish.” Yeah, Rudy, go, man, go.\n\nWhere is Sheckley? Well you might ask. I suspect I might find him here.in this paper prison Rucker has presented me with. A place called “Transreal!”\n\n===\n\nNote by Rudy: The story that Sheckley quotes from is my “Inertia.” His reference to “steam bends in a daffodil moment” is to a phrase that I used when phoned him up, to rhapsodize about a patch of daffodils at the foot of our hill, by a stream, but at that moment I thought it would be more interesting to talk about a “steam bend” than a “stream bend.” And I guess I was in a “daffy duck” mode of intoxication. I used to do that, make phone calls like that, and it didn’t do my career a bit of good — although some generous souls, like Sheckley, found it amusing."
