        "text": "Happy Birthday, Robert Sheckley, born 16 July 1928, died 9 December 2005.\n\nSeven Quotes\n\nA novel is often a longer process in handling self-doubt.\n\nI do think that short story writing is often a matter of luck.\n\nWherever you go in the galaxy, you can find a food business, a house-building business, a war business, a peace business, a governing business, and so forth. And, of course, a God business, which is called ‘religion,’ and which is a particularly reprehensible line of endeavour.\n\nAction isn’t my forte. I’m an expert on contemplation and mild regret.\n\nOnce you find you can’t walk as far and as fast as you were able, life becomes more complicated.\n\nI’ve always thought of absurdism as a French fad I’d like to belong to.\n\nI wrote what I hoped would be science fiction, I was not at all sure if what I wrote would be acceptable even. But I don’t say that I consciously wrote with humour. Humour is a part of you that comes out.\n\nRobert Sheckley was an American author who wrote in the Science-Fiction genre. He was named Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2001. He is the author of books like Immortality Inc.\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nPlease click here for our Literary Birthday Calendar\n\nPosted on: 16th July 2014\n\n(3,411 views)"
