        "text": "Real world article\n\n(written from a Production point of view)\n\nRobert Sheckley (16 July 1928 – 9 December 2005; age 77) was a prolific and critically acclaimed science fiction writer, the author of twenty-six novels and hundreds of short stories.\n\nIn 1966, Sheckley pitched two stories for Star Trek: The Original Series, \"Rites of Fertility\" and \"Sister In Space\", however neither was produced. Almost thirty years later, he was the author of the DS9 novel The Laertian Gamble.\n\nSheckley commented, \"I didn't realize I was a Star Trek fan until I started writing The Laertian Gamble. Before that, I had been critical of Star Trek.\" (Voyages of Imagination [page number? • edit])\n\nBiography[]\n\nSheckley was born in Brooklyn, New York to a family of Eastern European Jewish origin. When he was a child, the family moved to nearby New Jersey. After serving in the US Army in the Korean War, he went to New York University. After then, he lived in various places including Greenwich Village, and the island of Ibiza in Spain.\n\nSheckley's writing received widespread praise, including from the English writer Kingsley Amis. His work was published in a number of different magazines, including Playboy; it was often absurdist and satirical. His daughter Alisa has gone on to become a successful writer in her own right.\n\nHe also wrote tie-ins to Babylon 5 and Alien. His work The 10th Victim has been cited as an influence on the Japanese film Battle Royale as well as The Hunger Games.\n\nHe fell ill with a brain aneurysm while attending a convention in the Ukraine and had to be flown back to the US, where he died in a hospital in Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\n[]"
