Although I'm a great fan of his novels, I personally think Sheckley's true genius shines more brightly in his short stories. My all-time favourite is \"Specialist\", which I read MANY years ago as a teenager. Written in 1953, this tale can not only be seen as the precursor of Star Trek's galactic federation, but also offers an explanation of the (extremely important!) role of humans in the great scheme of things.\n\nThe fact that there's no thread for Robert Sheckley in the \"Authors\" section of SFF is for me a sad confirmation that this great SF author is gradually drifting into the realm of forgotten writers. I therefore hope to revive his memory here by sharing your thoughts on his short stories.\n\nRay McCarthy\n\nSentient Marmite: The Truth may make you fret.\n\nJoined\n\nJul 16, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n8,090\n\nLocation\n\nThe Mid West (of Ireland)\n\nMar 29, 2015\n\n#2\n\nThere are so many ...
