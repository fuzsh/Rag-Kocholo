        "text": "Often considered to be Robert Sheckley's best short story collection, Untouched By Human Hands displays all of the author's signature surreal humour and eye for the unreal. Featuring human space exploration from the perspective of appalled aliens, darkly comic dystopias and wry fables of technological disaster, this slim collection is rich in wit, invention and provocative insight, and includes the classic stories 'The Monsters', Specialist' and 'Seventh Victim'."
