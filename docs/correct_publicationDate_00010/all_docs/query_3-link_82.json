These reviews are intended to help people find his best work. Despite the welcome release of \"Dimensions of Sheckley\" and \"Masque of Manana\", much of his work remains out of print. Second hand copies are fairly easy to find, and a good place to look is the Advanced Book Exchange.\n\nYou can e-mail any comments or information to me by clicking here: Marcos\n\nWanted:\n\nThis page is always under construction. I'm sure there are a few things that have escaped my attention. Tell me what I've missed out! What did Sheckley write for Atlantic Monthly? Which Captain Video scripts did he write?\n\nThis page was last updated: Jan 2007\n\nDid I mention he was funny?\n\nThis site copyright 1998-2007.\n\nTo stop this page insert Laxian key"
