Rasch analysis of individual patient data. Rehabilitation centre. A total of 135 patients with musculoskeletal diseases of the lower limb. Patients were assessed with the Lower Extremity Functional Scale before and after the rehabilitation. Rasch analysis showed some problems related to rating scale category functioning, items fit, and items redundancy. After an iterative process, which resulted in the reduction of rating scale categories from 5 to 4, and in the deletion of 5 items, the psychometric properties of the Italian Lower Extremity Functional Scale improved. The retained 15 items with a 4-level response format fitted the Rasch model (internal construct validity), and demonstrated unidimensionality and good reliability indices (person-separation reliability 0.92; Cronbach's alpha 0.94). Then, the analysis showed differential item functioning for six of the retained items. The sensitivity to change of the Italian 15-item Lower Extremity Functional Scale was nearly equal to the one of the original version (effect size: 0.93 and 0.98; standardized response mean: 1.20 and 1.28, respectively for the 15-item and 20-item versions). The Italian Lower Extremity Functional Scale had unsatisfactory measurement properties. However, removing five items and simplifying the scoring from 5 to 4 levels resulted in a more valid measure with good reliability and sensitivity to change.\n\nDevelopment of a 12-item short version of the HIV stigma scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nReinius, Maria; Wettergren, Lena; Wiklander, Maria; Svedhem, Veronica; EkstrÃ¶m, Anna Mia; Eriksson, Lars E\n\n2017-05-30\n\nValid and reliable instruments for the measurement of enacted, anticipated and internalised stigma in people living with HIV are crucial for mapping trends in the prevalence of HIV-related stigma and tracking the effectiveness of stigma-reducing interventions. Although longer instruments exist, e.g., the commonly used 40-item HIV Stigma Scale by Berger et al., a shorter instrument would be preferable to facilitate the inclusion of HIV stigma in more and broader surveys. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a substantially shorter, but still valid, version of the HIV Stigma Scale. Data from a psychometric evaluation of the Swedish 40-item HIV Stigma Scale were reanalysed to create a short version with 12 items (three from each of the four stigma subscales: personalised stigma, disclosure concerns, concerns with public attitudes and negative self-image). The short version of the HIV stigma scale was then psychometrically tested using data from a national survey investigating stigma and quality of life among people living with HIV in Sweden (nÂ =Â 880, mean age 47.9Â years, 26% female). The hypothesized factor structure of the proposed short version was replicated in exploratory factor analysis without cross loadings and confirmatory factor analysis supported construct validity with high standardised effects (>0.7) of items on the intended scales. The Ï 2 test was statistically significant (Ï 2 Â =Â 154.2, dfÂ =Â 48, pÂ <Â 0.001), but alternate fit measures indicated acceptable fit (comparative fit index: 0.963, Tucker-Lewis index: 0.950 and root mean square error of approximation: 0.071). Corrected item-total correlation coefficients were >0.4 for all items, with a variation indicating that the broadness of the concept of stigma had been captured. All but two aspects of HIV-related stigma that the instrument is intended to cover were captured by the selected items in the short version. The aspects that did not lose any items were judged to have acceptable\n\nTranslation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation of the french version of the 15-item Myasthenia Gravis Quality Of life scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nBirnbaum, Simone; Ghout, Idir; Demeret, Sophie; Bolgert, Francis; Eymard, Bruno; Sharshar, Tarek; Portero, Pierre; Hogrel, Jean-Yves\n\n2017-05-01\n\nEvaluation of quality of life (QOL) has become essential in healthcare. Currently no MG-specific QOL measure exists in French. The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the 15-Item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life Scale (MG-QOL15) scale for French myasthenia patients. Translation and cross-cultural adaption of the MG-QOL15 was performed, followed by reliability and validity evaluations. One hundred and twenty-five patients were included. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach Î±â=â0.92) as was test-retest reliability (ICCâ=â0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.96). Concurrent validity was good for both clinical scores (myasthenic muscle score: Ïâ=â-0.52, Pâ<â0.001; Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living scale score: Ïâ=â0.62, Pâ<â0.001). Correlations were strongest for overall QOL (Ïâ=â0.62, Pâ<â0.001) and physical health (Ïâ=â0.67, Pâ<â0.001) on the World Health Organization Quality of Life short score (WHO-QOL BREF). The French version of the MG-QOL15 is valid and reliable and is now available for use with French-speaking patients. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 55: 639-645, 2017.

The validation protocol included the MG-QOL15, the 36-item Short Form (SF-36), the Besta Neurological Institute Rating Scale for Myasthenia Gravis, and the MG-Composite. We used the Cronbach Î± to test reliability, the Spearman correlation to test short-term test-retest, the Kruskal-Wallis test to assess differences in MG-QOL15 between patients with different disease severity, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess sensitivity to change. Seventy-two patients were enrolled in the study. The mean MG-QOL15 score was 15.2âÂ±â12.2, with Î±â=â0.93 and test-retest correlationâ=â0.93. Compared with the SF-36, the MG-QOL15 was superior in differentiating patients with different MG types (Pâ=â0.041) and severity (Pâ=â0.004), showed higher sensitivity to change (Pâ=â0.003 for improved and Pâ=â0.024 for worsened patients), and had higher correlations with the MG-Composite (rhoâ=â0.367 vs. -0.213 and -0.154).

This study describes the validation of a Tamil version of Geriatric Depression Scale (short form 15 [GDS-15] item) in a rural population. A Tamil version of GDS-15 was developed using standardized procedures. The questionnaire was applied in a sample of elderly (aged 60 years and above) from a village in South India. All the participants were also assessed for depression by a clinical interview by a psychiatrist. A total of 242 participants were enrolled, 64.9% of them being females. The mean score on GDS-15 was 7.4 (Â±3.4), while the point prevalence of depression was 6.2% by clinical interview. The area under the receiver-operator curve was 0.659. The optimal cut-off for the GDS in this sample was found at 7/8 with sensitivity and specificity being 80% and 47.6%, respectively. The Tamil version of GDS-15 can be a useful screening instrument for assessment of depression in the elderly population.\n\nPsychometric properties of the Arabic version of the 12-item diabetes fatalism scale\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbi Kharma, Joelle\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground There are widespread fatalistic beliefs in Arab countries, especially among individuals with diabetes. However, there is no tool to assess diabetes fatalism in this population. This study describes the processes used to create an Arabic version of the Diabetes Fatalism Scale (DFS) and examine its psychometric properties. Methods A descriptive correlational design was used with a convenience sample of Lebanese adults (N = 274) with type 2 diabetes recruited from a major hospital in Beirut, Lebanon and by snowball sampling. The 12- item Diabetes Fatalism Scale- Arabic (12-item DFS-Ar) was back-translated from the original version, pilot tested on 22 adults with type 2 diabetes and then administered to 274 patients to assess the validity and reliability of the scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the hypothesized factor structure. Cronbachâs alpha was used to test for reliability. Results CFA supported the existence of the three factor hypothesis of the original DFS scale. The five items measuring âemotional distressâ loaded under Factor 1, the four items measuring âspiritual copingâ loaded under factor 2 and the last three items measuring âperceived self-efficacyâ of the original scale loaded under Factor 3 (p <0.001 for all three subscales). Goodness of fit indices confirmed adequateness of the CFA model (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.067 and pclose = 0.05). The 12-item DFS-Ar showed good reliability (Cronbachâs alpha of 0.86) and significantly predicted HbA1c (Î² = 0.20, p < 0.01). After adjusting for the demographic characteristics and the number of diabetes comorbid conditions, the 12-item DFS-Ar score was independently associated with HbA1c in a multivariable model (Î² = 0.16, p < 0.05). Conclusions The 12-item DFS-Ar demonstrated good psychometric properties that are comparable to the original scale. It is a valid and reliable measure of diabetes fatalism. Further testing with larger and non-Lebanese Arabic\n\nBrief Sensation Seeking Scale: Latent structure of 8-item and 4-item versions in Peruvian adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nMerino-Soto, Cesar; Salas Blas, Edwin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis research intended to validate two brief scales of sensations seeking with Peruvian adolescents: the eight item scale (BSSS8; Hoyle, Stephenson, Palmgreen, Lorch, y Donohew, 2002) and the four item scale (BSSS4; Stephenson, Hoyle, Slater, y Palmgreen, 2003). Questionnaires were administered to 618 voluntary participants, with an average age of 13.6 years, from different levels of high school, state and private school in a district in the south of Lima. It analyzed the internal structure of both short versions using three models: a) unidimensional (M1), b) oblique or related dimensions (M2), and c) the bifactor model (M3). Results show that both instruments have a single dimension which best represents the variability of the items; a fact that can be explained both by the complexity of the concept and by the small number of items representing each factor, which is more noticeable in the BSSS4. Reliability is within levels found by previous studies: alpha: .745 = BSSS8 and BSSS4 =. 643; omega coefficient: .747 in BSSS8 and .651 in BSSS4. These are considered suitable for the type of instruments studied. Based on the correlation between the two instruments, it was found that there are satisfactory levels of equivalence between the BSSS8 and BSSS4. However, it is recommended that the BSSS4 is mainly used for research and for the purpose of describing populations.\n\nValidation of the Spanish versions of the long (26 items) and short (12 items) forms of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS).\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia-Campayo, Javier; Navarro-Gil, Mayte; AndrÃ©s, Eva; Montero-Marin, JesÃºs; LÃ³pez-Artal, Lorena; Demarzo, Marcelo Marcos Piva\n\n2014-01-10\n\nSelf-compassion is a key psychological construct for assessing clinical outcomes in mindfulness-based interventions. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish versions of the long (26 item) and short (12 item) forms of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The translated Spanish versions of both subscales were administered to two independent samples: Sample 1 was comprised of university students (nâ=â268) who were recruited to validate the long form, and Sample 2 was comprised of Aragon Health Service workers (nâ=â271) who were recruited to validate the short form. In addition to SCS, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were administered. Construct validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were tested. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the long and short forms of the SCS confirmed the original six-factor model in both scales, showing goodness of fit. Cronbach's Î± for the 26 item SCS was 0.87 (95% CIâ=â0.85-0.90) and ranged between 0.72 and 0.79 for the 6 subscales.

The main goal was to investigate the reliability and construct validity of the conceptual structure of Condon's proposal. Five hundred twenty-five pregnant women, attending maternal education classes in Bizkaia (Spain), answered the translated and back-translated version of the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale. This scale comprises 19 items with five answer choices divided into two subscales: quality of attachment and intensity of attachment. Participants also answered a questionnaire about the reproductive history that was developed ad hoc for the present study. The Spanish adaptation of the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale final version comprises 12 items: seven items have been removed due to their inadequate psychometric properties. Internal consistency of the inventory is moderate-high (.73) and it ranges from .68 (intensity of attachment) to .75 (quality of attachment) for the dimensions. Three alternative structural models were proven using a confirmatory factor analysis. Lastly, the two-related-factor model was chosen, as it obtained suitable fit indexes (Ï (2) = 102.28; p < .001; goodness-of-fit index (GFI)â=â.92; comparative fit index (CFI)â=â.95; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)â=â.042, 90 % CI [.030-.054]). Due to its adequate psychometric properties, the Spanish version of the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale can be proposed as a suitable instrument for the purpose of measuring antenatal attachment. The study of antenatal attachment helps to detect possible difficulties for the mother in establishing an affective relationship with the foetus. This may affect the foetus growth, delivery and the future mother-child relationship.\n\nRasch validation of the Arabic version of the lower extremity functional scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlnahdi, Ali H\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the internal construct validity of the Arabic version of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (20-item Arabic LEFS) using Rasch analysis. Patients (nâ=â170) with lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction were recruited. Rasch analysis of 20-item Arabic LEFS was performed. Once the initial Rasch analysis indicated that the 20-item Arabic LEFS did not fit the Rasch model, follow-up analyses were conducted to improve the fit of the scale to the Rasch measurement model. These modifications included removing misfitting individuals, changing item scoring structure, removing misfitting items, addressing bias caused by response dependency between items and differential item functioning (DIF). Initial analysis indicated deviation of the 20-item Arabic LEFS from the Rasch model. Disordered thresholds in eight items and response dependency between six items were detected with the scale as a whole did not meet the requirement of unidimensionality. Refinements led to a 15-item Arabic LEFS that demonstrated excellent internal consistency (person separation index [PSI]â=â0.92) and satisfied all the requirement of the Rasch model. Rasch analysis did not support the 20-item Arabic LEFS as a unidimensional measure of lower extremity function. The refined 15-item Arabic LEFS met all the requirement of the Rasch model and hence is a valid objective measure of lower extremity function. The Rasch-validated 15-item Arabic LEFS needs to be further tested in an independent sample to confirm its fit to the Rasch measurement model. Implications for Rehabilitation The validity of the 20-item Arabic Lower Extremity Functional Scale to measure lower extremity function is not supported. The 15-item Arabic version of the LEFS is a valid measure of lower extremity function and can be used to quantify lower extremity function in patients with lower extremity musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThe application of item response theory in developing and validating a shortened version of the Emirate Marital Satisfaction Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nDodeen, Hamzeh; Al-Darmaki, Fatima\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of generating a shorter version of the Emirati Marital Satisfaction Scale (EMSS) using item response theory (IRT)-based methodology. The EMSS is the first national scale used to provide an understanding of the family function and level of marital satisfaction within the cultural context of the United Arab Emirates. A sample of 1,049 Emirati married individuals from different ages, genders, places of residence, and monthly incomes participated in this study. The IRT was calibrated using X-Calibre 4.2 and the graded response model. The analysis was developed on the basis of a short form of the EMSS (7 items), which constitutes a promising alternative to the original scale for practitioners and researchers. This short version is reliable, valid, and it gives results very similar to the original scale. The results of this study confirmed the usefulness of IRT-based methodology for developing psychological and counseling scales.

The aims of this study were to refine a previously published version of the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (the ISVS-24) and create two shorter equivalent forms to be used in pre-post studies. A graded response model was used to identify ISVS items in a practitioner data set (n = 345), with validation (measure invariance) conducted using a separate student sample (n = 341). Analyses indicated a unidimensional 21-item version with excellent measurement properties, Cronbach alpha of 0.988, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.985-0.991. There was evidence of measure invariance, as there was excellent agreement of the factor scores for the practitioner and student data, intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.993, 95% CI 0.991-0.994. This indicates that the ISVS-21 measures IP socialization consistently across groups. Two 9-item equivalent versions for pre-post use were developed, with excellent agreement between the two forms. The student score agreement for the two item sets was excellent: intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.970, 95% CI 0.963-0.976. The ISVS-21 is a refined measure to assess existing levels of IP socialization in practitioners and students, and relate IP socialization to other important constructs such as IP collaboration and the development of an IP identity. The equivalent versions can be used to assess change in IP socialization as a result of interprofessional education.\n\nThe British Sign Language Versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRogers, Katherine D.; Young, Alys; Lovell, Karina; Campbell, Malcolm; Scott, Paul R.; Kendal, Sarah\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe present study is aimed to translate 3 widely used clinical assessment measures into British Sign Language (BSL), to pilot the BSL versions, and to establish their validity and reliability. These were the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS).â¦\n\nConfirmatory Factor and Rasch Analyses Support a Revised 14-Item Version of the Organizational, Policies, and Practices (OPP) Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Qiyun; MacDermid, Joy C; Tang, Kenneth; Sinden, Kathryn E; Walton, Dave; Grewal, Ruby\n\n2017-06-01\n\nBackground The long version of the organizational, policies and practices (OPP) had a high burden and short versions were developed to solve this drawback. The 11-item version showed promise, but the ergonomic subscale was deficient. The OPP-14 was developed by adding three additional items to the ergonomics subscale. The aim of this study is to evaluate the factor structure using confirmatory factor and Rasch analyses in healthy firefighters. Methods A sample of 261 firefighters (Mean age 42Â years, 95Â % male) were sampled. A confirmatory factor and Rasch analyses were used to assess the internal consistency, factor structure and other psychometric characteristics of revised OPP-14. Results The OPP-14 demonstrates sound factor structure and internal consistency in firefighters. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the consistency of the original 4-domain structure (CFIÂ =Â 0.97, TLIÂ =Â 0.96, and RMSEAÂ =Â 0.053). The 5 items showing misfit initially with disordered thresholds were rescored. The four subscales satisfied Rasch expectations with well target and acceptable reliability. Conclusions The OPP-14 scale shows a promising factor structure in this sample and remediated deficits found in OPP-11. This version may be preferable for musculoskeletal concerns or work applications where ergonomic indicators are relevant.\n\nPsychometric properties of the polish version of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nBasiÅska, Beata A; GruszczyÅska, Ewa; Schaufeli, Wilmar B\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to verify psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS). Specifically, theoretical 4-factor structure (based on the dimensions of pleasure and arousal) and reliability of the original - 20-item JAWS (van Katwyk et al., 2000) and the shortened - 12-item (Schaufeli and Van Rhenen, 2006) versions were tested. Two independent samples were analyzed (police officers, N = 395, and police recruits, N = 202). The Polish version of the original, 20-item, JAWS was used to measure job-related affective states across the past month (van Katwyk et al., 2000). This version of JAWS includes 2 dimensions: valence and arousal, which allow to assess 4 categories of emotions: low-arousal positive emotions, high-arousal positive emotions, low-arousal negative emotions and high-arousal negative emotions. The results of multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the theoretical circumplex model of emotions underlining JAWS was satisfactorily reproduced. Also the hypothesized 4-factor structure of the Polish version of JAWS was confirmed. The 12-item version had better fit with the data than the original, 20-item, version, but the best fit was obtained for the even shorter, 8-item version. This version emerged from a multidimensional scaling of the 12-item version. Reliabilities of the 20- and 12-item versions were good, with lower values for the 8-item JAWS version. The findings confirmed satisfactory psychometric properties of both Polish versions of the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale. Thus, when both psychometric properties and relevance for cross-cultural comparisons are considered, the 12-item JAWS is recommended as a version of choice.\n\nA 7-item version of the fatigue severity scale has better psychometric properties among HIV-infected adults: an application of a Rasch model.\n\nPubMed\n\nLerdal, Anners; Kottorp, Anders; Gay, Caryl; Aouizerat, Bradley E; Portillo, Carmen J; Lee, Kathryn A\n\n2011-11-01\n\nTo examine the psychometric properties of the 9-item Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) using a Rasch model application. A convenience sample of HIV-infected adults was recruited, and a subset of the sample was assessed at 6-month intervals for 2Â years. Socio-demographic, clinical, and symptom data were collected by self-report questionnaires. CD4 T-cell count and viral load measures were obtained from medical records. The Rasch analysis included 316 participants with 698 valid questionnaires. FSS item 2 did not advanced monotonically, and items 1 and 2 did not show acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model. A reduced FSS 7-item version demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit and explained 61.2% of the total variance in the scale. In the FSS-7 item version, no uniform Differential Item Functioning was found in relation to time of evaluation or to any of the socio-demographic or clinical variables. This study demonstrated that the FSS-7 has better psychometric properties than the FSS-9 in this HIV sample and that responses to the different items are comparable over time and unrelated to socio-demographic and clinical variables.\n\nReliability and Validity of a Shorter Chinese Version for Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLi, Ren-Hau\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to develop a new and shorter Chinese version of Ryff's psychological well-being scale. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: In recent years there have been several versions of this scale, including 84-item, 54-item and 18-item versions.

Only one attempt has been made to create a shorter scale, resulting in the Italian FSFI-6, later translated into Spanish and Korean without further psychometric analysis. Our study evaluated whether a subset of items on the 19-item English-language FSFI would perform as well as the full-length FSFI in peri- and postmenopausal women. We used baseline data from 898 peri- and postmenopausal women recruited from multiple communities, ages 42-62Â years, and enrolled in randomized controlled trials for vasomotor symptom management. Goals were to (1) create a psychometrically sound, shorter version of the FSFI for use in peri- and postmenopausal women as a continuous measure and (2) compare it to the Italian FSFI-6. Results indicated that a 9-item scale provided more information than the FSFI-6 across a spectrum of sexual functioning, was able to capture sample variability, and showed sufficient range without floor or ceiling effects. All but one of the items from the Italian 6-item version were included in the 9-item version. Most omitted FSFI items focused on frequency of events or experiences. When assessment of sexual function is a secondary endpoint and subject burden related to questionnaire length is a priority, the 9-item FSFI may provide important information about sexual function in English-speaking peri- and postmenopausal women.\n\nReliability and validity of the Italian version of the 14-item Resilience Scale\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCallegari, Camilla; BertÃ¹, Lorenza; Lucano, Melissa; Ielmini, Marta; Braggio, Elena; Vender, Simone\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground In recent years resilience has gained clinical relevance in sociological, psychological, and medical disciplines, and a lot of scales measuring resilience have been developed and have been utilized in the western countries. The aim of the study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14), by describing its validity and reliability. As agreed with the authors of the original English version of the RS-14, it was translated into Italian. Then the standard procedure for back-translation was followed. Methods In total, 150 participants among the nursing and professional education students of the University of Insubria of Varese and health workers of the âASST dei Sette Laghi-Ospedale di Circoloâ of Varese were enrolled. The responses to the questionnaires were collected only from the students and the health workers between the ages of 18 and 65 years who gave their consent to participate in the study from April to September 2015. A subsample of 26 students and health workers was retested on the RS-14, 5 weeks after the first assessment. The questionnaires were handed out to 214 people, and 150 sets of questionnaires (70%) were returned, of which eight were subsequently removed because >60% of the answers were missing. In order to ensure anonymity, every completed questionnaire was identified only via a code. Results No significant differences were found between the mean values of the resilience scores between women (76.1) and men (76.3), with unpaired t-test = â0.08 and P=0.93. Similarly, no difference between resilience scores were found between mean age group of 18â25 years (75.3) and 26â65 years (78.7), with t-test = 1.6. The overall Cronbachâs alpha of the RS-14 is 0.88, P=0.10. The RS-14 is negatively correlated with the Beck Depression Inventory-Primary Care Version and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and positively correlated with the World Health Organization Quality of\n\nA Comparison of the 27-Item and 12-Item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scales\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKhawaja, Nigar G.; Yu, Lai Ngo Heidi\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) has become one of the most frequently used measures of Intolerance of Uncertainty.

The original and the Portuguese versions were independently translated and back-translated into English. An expert panel performed semantic analysis and conceptual adaptations. The translated version of the NEWS-Y was applied to a sample of eight adolescents and showed adequate understanding. After minor changes identified in the translation processes, the expert panel considered the Brazilian version of the NEWS-Y semantically and conceptually equivalent. The translated version of the NEWS-Y required a few adjustments to ensure conceptual, item, and semantic adaptation. Further studies are recommended to examine other steps in the cross-cultural adaptation of the Portuguese-language NEWS-Y version in the Brazilian context.\n\nValidation and cultural adaptation of a German version of the Physicians' Reactions to Uncertainty scales\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchneider, Antonius; Szecsenyi, Joachim; Barie, Stefan; Joest, Katharina; Rosemann, Thomas\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground The aim of the study was to examine the validity of a translated and culturally adapted version of the Physicians' Reaction to Uncertainty scales (PRU) in primary care physicians. Methods In a structured process, the original questionnaire was translated, culturally adapted and assessed after administering it to 93 GPs. Test-retest reliability was tested by sending the questionnaire to the GPs again after two weeks. Results The principal factor analysis confirmed the postulated four-factor structure underlying the 15 items. In contrast to the original version, item 5 achieved a higher loading on the 'concern about bad outcomes' scale. Consequently, we rearranged the scales. Good item-scale correlations were obtained, with Pearson's correlation coefficient ranging from 0.56â0.84. As regards the item-discriminant validity between the scales 'anxiety due to uncertainty' and 'concern about bad outcomes', partially high correlations (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.02â0.69; p < 0.001) were found, indicating an overlap between both constructs. The assessment of internal consistency revealed satisfactory values; Cronbach's alpha of the rearranged version was 0.86 or higher for all scales. Test-retest-reliability, assessed by means of the intraclass-correlation-coefficient (ICC), exceeded 0.84, except for the 'reluctance to disclose mistakes to physicians' scale (ICC = 0.66). In this scale, some substantial floor effects occurred, with 29.3% of answers showing the lowest possible value. Conclusion Dealing with uncertainty is an important issue in daily practice. The psychometric properties of the rearranged German version of the PRU are satisfying. The revealed floor effects do not limit the significance of the questionnaire. Thus, the German version of the PRU could contribute to the further evaluation of the impact of uncertainty in primary care physicians.

Levinson has developed a validated measure of this concept which consists of an 18-item scale for sexually active girls. However there are no such scales in French or for sexually active boys. The health promotion program, entitled SEXPRIMER, which aims at reducing teenage pregnancy, has incorporated the French version of the Levinson scale, the adapted boy's version and the validity studies. A 15-item scale for girls and a 14-item scale for boys with respective reliability coefficients of .78 and .71 resulted from this program. A logistic regression analysis shows the predictive value of the measures in regard to contraceptive behaviours. According to Levinson's more recent studies, results indicate that new research on the factor matrix of the scale are relevant.\n\nPsychometric properties of responses by clinicians and older adults to a 6-item Hebrew version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D6)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is commonly used as a screening instrument, as a continuous measure of change in depressive symptoms over time, and as a means to compare the relative efficacy of treatments. Among several abridged versions, the 6-item HAM-D6 is used most widely in large degree because of its good psychometric properties. The current study compares both self-report and clinician-rated versions of the Hebrew version of this scale. Methods A total of 153 Israelis 75âyears of age on average participated in this study. The HAM-D6 was examined using confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) models separately for both patient and clinician responses. Results Reponses to the HAM-D6 suggest that this instrument measures a unidimensional construct with each of the scalesâ six items contributing significantly to the measurement. Comparisons between self-report and clinician versions indicate that responses do not significantly differ for 4 of the 6 items. Moreover, 100% sensitivity (and 91% specificity) was found between patient HAM-D6 responses and clinician diagnoses of depression. Conclusion These results indicate that the Hebrew HAM-D6 can be used to measure and screen for depressive symptoms among elderly patients.

Five hundred and one workers were randomly selected in several occupational health care centers of the North of France during 2010. Participants completed a questionnaire including demographic variables and the PSS. The psychometric properties of this scale were analyzed: internal consistency, factorial structure, and discriminative sensibility. For the PSS-14 and PSS-10, the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) provided a two-factor structure, corresponding to the positively and negatively worded items. Those two factors were significantly correlated (r = 0.43 and 0.50, respectively). For the PSS-4, the EFA yielded a one-factor structure. The reliability was high for all three versions of the PSS (Cronbach's Î± values ranged from 0.73 to 0.84). The results concerning the effects of age, gender, marital, parental and occupational statuses showed that the 10-item version had the best discriminative sensibility. The findings confirmed satisfactory psychometric properties of all the three French versions of the PSS. We recommend the use of the PSS-10 in research settings because of its good psychometric properties.\n\nClinical validation of a non-heteronormative version of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS).\n\nPubMed\n\nLindner, Philip; Martell, Christopher; BergstrÃ¶m, Jan; Andersson, Gerhard; Carlbring, Per\n\n2013-12-19\n\nDespite welcomed changes in societal attitudes and practices towards sexual minorities, instances of heteronormativity can still be found within healthcare and research. The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) is a valid and reliable self-rating scale of social anxiety, which includes one item (number 14) with an explicit heteronormative assumption about the respondent's sexual orientation. This heteronormative phrasing may confuse, insult or alienate sexual minority respondents. A clinically validated version of the SIAS featuring a non-heteronormative phrasing of item 14 is thus needed. 129 participants with diagnosed social anxiety disorder, enrolled in an Internet-based intervention trial, were randomly assigned to responding to the SIAS featuring either the original or a novel non-heteronormative phrasing of item 14, and then answered the other item version. Within-subject, correlation between item versions was calculated and the two scores were statistically compared. The two items' correlations with the other SIAS items and other psychiatric rating scales were also statistically compared. Item versions were highly correlated and scores did not differ statistically. The two items' correlations with other measures did not differ statistically either. The SIAS can be revised with a non-heteronormative formulation of item 14 with psychometric equivalence on item and scale level. Implications for other psychiatric instruments with heteronormative phrasings are discussed.\n\nEvaluation of an Arabic Version of Children's Self-Report Social Skills Scale (CS[superscript 4]) Based on Item Response Theory\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHussein, Mohamed Habashy\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present study examined the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of Children's Self-report Social Skills Scale (CS[superscript 4]) using a generalized partial credit model (GPCM).

(2) To determine whether the underlying latent ability could also be accurately represented by a subset of the items for use in high-volume clinical scenarios. (3) To determine whether the Inner EAR instrument correlates with pure tone thresholds and word recognition scores. Design IRT evaluation of prospective cohort data. Setting Tertiary care academic ambulatory otolaryngology clinic. Subjects and Methods Modern psychometric methods, including factor analysis and IRT, were used to assess unidimensionality and item properties. Regression methods were used to assess prediction of word recognition and pure tone audiometry scores. Results The Inner EAR scale is unidimensional, and items varied in their location and information. Information parameter estimates ranged from 1.63 to 4.52, with higher values indicating more useful items. The IRT model provided a basis for identifying 2 sets of items with relatively lower information parameters. Item information functions demonstrated which items added insubstantial value over and above other items and were removed in stages, creating a 8- and 3-item Inner EAR scale for more efficient assessment. The 8-item version accurately reflected the underlying construct. All versions correlated moderately with word recognition scores and pure tone averages. Conclusion The 11-, 8-, and 3-item versions of the Inner EAR scale have strong psychometric properties, and there is correlational validity evidence for the observed scores. Modern psychometric methods can help streamline care delivery by maximizing relevant information per item administered.\n\nItem analysis of the Spanish version of the Boston Naming Test with a Spanish speaking adult population from Colombia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Stella H; Strutt, Adriana M; Olabarrieta-Landa, Laiene; Lequerica, Anthony H; Rivera, Diego; De Los Reyes Aragon, Carlos Jose; Utria, Oscar; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos\n\n2018-02-23\n\nThe Boston Naming Test (BNT) is a widely used measure of confrontation naming ability that has been criticized for its questionable construct validity for non-English speakers. This study investigated item difficulty and construct validity of the Spanish version of the BNT to assess cultural and linguistic impact on performance. Subjects wereÂ 1298 healthy Spanish speaking adults from Colombia. They were administered the 60- and 15-item Spanish version of the BNT. A Rasch analysis was computed to assess dimensionality, item hierarchy, targeting, reliability, and item fit. Both versions of the BNT satisfied requirements for unidimensionality. Although internal consistency was excellent for the 60-item BNT, order of difficulty did not increase consistently with item number and there were a number of items that did not fit the Rasch model. For the 15-item BNT, a total of 5 items changed position on the item hierarchy with 7 poor fitting items. Internal consistency was acceptable. Construct validity of the BNT remains a concern when it is administered to non-English speaking populations. Similar to previous findings, the order of item presentation did not correspond with increasing item difficulty, and both versions were inadequate at assessing high naming ability.\n\nIpsative imputation for a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale in community-dwelling elderly people.\n\nPubMed\n\nImai, Hissei; Furukawa, Toshiaki A; Kasahara, Yoriko; Ishimoto, Yasuko; Kimura, Yumi; Fukutomi, Eriko; Chen, Wen-Ling; Tanaka, Mire; Sakamoto, Ryota; Wada, Taizo; Fujisawa, Michiko; Okumiya, Kiyohito; Matsubayashi, Kozo\n\n2014-09-01\n\nMissing data are inevitable in almost all medical studies. Imputation methods using the probabilistic model are common, but they cannot impute individual data and require special software. In contrast, the ipsative imputation method, which substitutes the missing items by the mean of the remaining items within the individual, is easy and does not need any special software, but it can provide individual scores. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of the ipsative imputation method using data involving the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Participants were community-dwelling elderly individuals (nâ=â1178). A structural equation model was constructed. The model fit indexes were calculated to assess the validity of the imputation method when it is used for individuals who were missing 20% of data or less and 40% of data or less, depending on whether we assumed that their correlation coefficients were the same as the dataset with no missing items. Finally, we compared path coefficients of the dataset imputed by ipsative imputation with those by multiple imputation. When compared with the assumption that the datasets differed, all of the model fit indexes were better under the assumption that the dataset without missing data is the same as that that was missing 20% of data or less. However, by the same assumption, the model fit indexes were worse in the dataset that was missing 40% of data or less. The path coefficients of the dataset imputed by ipsative imputation and by multiple imputation were compatible with each other if the proportion of missing items was 20% or less. Ipsative imputation appears to be a valid imputation method and can be used to impute data in studies using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, if the percentage of its missing items is 20% or less.

Two hundred AD patients were interviewed and assessed by QOL-AD, through the stratified cluster sampling method. Multilog 7.03. was used for Item Function Analysis. Difference scale(a), difficulty scale(b)and Item Characteristic Curve(ICC) of each item of QOL-AD were provided. Different scales of the item 1, 7 were below 0.6, while all the others were above 0.6. As for ICC. The first and last lines for the other items were monotonic in which the two in between were in inverted V-shape, with very steep slopes, except for the item 1 and 7. Results form the IFA showed that QOL-AD was applicable to be used in the Chinese patients with AD.\n\nA Psychometric Analysis of the Italian Version of the eHealth Literacy Scale Using Item Response and Classical Test Theory Methods\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDima, Alexandra Lelia; Schulz, Peter Johannes\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is a tool to assess consumersâ comfort and skills in using information technologies for health. Although evidence exists of reliability and construct validity of the scale, less agreement exists on structural validity. Objective The aim of this study was to validate the Italian version of the eHealth Literacy Scale (I-eHEALS) in a community sample with a focus on its structural validity, by applying psychometric techniques that account for item difficulty. Methods Two Web-based surveys were conducted among a total of 296 people living in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland (Ticino). After examining the latent variables underlying the observed variables of the Italian scale via principal component analysis (PCA), fit indices for two alternative models were calculated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale structure was examined via parametric and nonparametric item response theory (IRT) analyses accounting for differences between items regarding the proportion of answers indicating high ability. Convergent validity was assessed by correlations with theoretically related constructs. Results CFA showed a suboptimal model fit for both models. IRT analyses confirmed all items measure a single dimension as intended. Reliability and construct validity of the final scale were also confirmed. The contrasting results of factor analysis (FA) and IRT analyses highlight the importance of considering differences in item difficulty when examining health literacy scales. Conclusions The findings support the reliability and validity of the translated scale and its use for assessing Italian-speaking consumersâ eHealth literacy.

The aim was to translate, culturally adapt and psychometrically evaluate the CAS in a Swedish sample of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients, heart failure (HF) patients and their partners. A sample (n=391) of ICD recipients, HF patients and partners were used. Descriptive statistics, item-total and inter-item correlations, exploratory factor analysis, ordinal regression modelling and Cronbach's alpha were used to validate the CAS. The findings from the factor analyses revealed that the CAS is a multidimensional scale including two factors, Control and Helplessness. The internal consistency was satisfactory for all scales (Î±=0.74-0.85), except the family version total scale (Î±=0.62). No differential item functioning was detected which implies that the CAS can be used to make invariant comparisons between groups of different age and sex. The psychometric properties, together with the simple and short format of the CAS, make it to a useful tool for measuring perceived control among patients with cardiac diseases and their family members. When using the CAS, subscale scores should be preferred.

The purpose of this study was to analyse a Mandarin Chinese translation of the Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale for a hierarchy of items according to the criteria of Mokken scaling. Data from 180 Chinese participants who completed the Chinese translation of the Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale were analysed using the Mokken Scaling Procedure and the 'R' statistical programme using the diagnostics available in these programmes. Correlation between Mandarin Chinese items and a Chinese translation of the Short Form (36) Health Survey was also analysed. Findings Fifteen items from the Mandarin Chinese Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale were retained in a strong and reliable Mokken scale; invariant item ordering was not evident and the Mokken scaled items of the Chinese Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale correlated with the Short Form (36) Health Survey. Conclusions Items from the Mandarin Chinese Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale form a Mokken scale and this offers further insight into how the items of the Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale relate to the measurement of health-related quality of life people with a myocardial infarction.

These were the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). The 3 assessment measures were translated into BSL and piloted with the Deaf signing population in the United Kingdom (n = 113). Participants completed the PHQ-9, GAD-7, WSAS, and Clinical Outcomes in Routine EvaluationâOutcome Measure (CORE-OM) online. The reliability and validity of the BSL versions of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS have been examined and were found to be good. The construct validity for the PHQ-9 BSL version did not find the single-factor solution as found in the hearing population. The BSL versions of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS have been produced in BSL and can be used with the signing Deaf population in the United Kingdom. This means that now there are accessible mental health assessments available for Deaf people who are BSL users, which could assist in the early identification of mental health difficulties.

Methods The present study was a methodological research in which 289 nurses of Intensive Care Units from nine hospitals in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran were selected between 2015 and 2016. The original version of the scale was translated into Persian and back-translated into English, and the comments of the developer were applied. The validity of the scale was the determined quality (content validity and face validity) and quantity (confirmatory factor analysis). Reliability of the scale was reported by Cronbachâs alpha coefficient and Intra class Correlation Coefficient. SPSS-PC (v.21) and LISREL (v.8.5) were used to analyze the data. Results The intensive and critical care nursing competence scale version-1 is a self-assessment test that consists of 144 items and four domains which are the knowledge base, the skill base, the attitudes and values base and the experience base, which are divided into clinical competence and professional competence. Content and face validity was confirmed by 10 experts and 10 practitioner nurses in the intensive care units. In confirmatory factor analysis, all fitness indexes, except goodness of fit index (0.64), confirmed the four-factor structure of the ICCN-CS-1. The results of the factor analysis, load factor between 0.304 and 0.727 items was estimated; only 4 items out of 144 items, that were loaded were less than 0.3 due to high Cronbachâs alpha coefficient (0.984â0.986), all items were preserved, no item was removed and 4 subscales of the original scale were confirmed.

NIHSS items 9 and 10 were modified and culturally adapted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the resulting version was termed as Hindi version (HV-NIHSS). HV-NIHSS was applied by two independent investigators on 107 patients with stroke. Inter-observer agreement and intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated. The predictive validity of the HV-NIHSS was calculated using functional outcome after three months in the form of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI). The study included 107 patients of stroke recruited from a tertiary referral hospital at Delhi between November 1, 2009, and October 1, 2010; the mean age of these patients was 56.26Â±13.84 years and 65.4% of them had suffered ischemic stroke. Inter-rater reliability was high between the two examiners, with Pearson's r ranging from 0.72 to 0.99 for the 15 items on the Scale. Intra-class correlation coefficient for the total score was 0.995 (95% CI-0.993-0.997). Concurrent construct validity was established between HV-NIHSS and baseline Glasgow Coma Scale, with a high correlation (Spearman coefficient = -0.863, P<.001). Predictive validity was also established with BI at three months (Spearman's rho: -0.829, P<.001) and with mRS at three months (Spearman's rho: 0.851, P<0.001). This study shows that a Hindi language version of the NIHSS developed at AIIMS appears reliable and valid when applied to a Hindi-speaking population.\n\nAn Analysis of the Connectedness to Nature Scale Based on Item Response Theory.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasca, Laura; AragonÃ©s, Juan I; Coello, MarÃ­a T\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) is used as a measure of the subjective cognitive connection between individuals and nature. However, to date, it has not been analyzed at the item level to confirm its quality. In the present study, we conduct such an analysis based on Item Response Theory. We employed data from previous studies using the Spanish-language version of the CNS, analyzing a sample of 1008 participants. The results show that seven items presented appropriate indices of discrimination and difficulty, in addition to a good fit. The remaining six have inadequate discrimination indices and do not present a good fit. A second study with 321 participants shows that the seven-item scale has adequate levels of reliability and validity. Therefore, it would be appropriate to use a reduced version of the scale after eliminating the items that display inappropriate behavior, since they may interfere with research results on connectedness to nature.\n\nAn Analysis of the Connectedness to Nature Scale Based on Item Response Theory\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPasca, Laura; AragonÃ©s, Juan I.; Coello, MarÃ­a T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) is used as a measure of the subjective cognitive connection between individuals and nature.

This study in 2013 tested the reliability and validity of the Arabic MMAS-8 for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients attending a referral centre in Tripoli, Libya. A convenience sample of 103 patients self-completed the questionnaire. Reliability was tested using Cronbach alpha, average inter-item correlation and Spearman-Brown coefficient. Known-group validity was tested by comparing MMAS-8 scores of patients grouped by glycaemic control. The Arabic version showed adequate internal consistency (Î± = 0.70) and moderate split-half reliability (r = 0.65). Known-group validity was supported as a significant association was found between medication adherence and glycaemic control, with a moderate effect size (Ïc = 0.34). The Arabic version displayed good psychometric properties and could support diabetes research and practice in Arab countries.\n\nValidation of Turkish version of brief negative symptom scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolat NazlÄ±, Irmak; ErgÃ¼l, Ceylan; Aydemir, Ãmer; Chandhoke, Swati; ÃÃ§ok, Alp; GÃ¶nÃ¼l, Ali Saffet\n\n2016-11-01\n\nNegative symptoms in schizophrenia have been assessed by many instruments. However, a current consensus on these symptoms has been built and new tools, such as the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS), are generated. This study aimed to evaluate reliability and validity of the Turkish version of BNSS. The scale was translated to Turkish and backtranslated to English. After the approval of the translation, 75 schizophrenia patients were interviewed with BNSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Reliability and validity analyses were then calculated. In the reliability analysis, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.96 and item-total score correlation coefficients were between 0.655-0.884. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.665. The inter-rater reliability was 0.982 (pâ<â0.0001). In the validity analysis, the total score of BNSS-TR was correlated with PANSS Total Score, Positive Symptoms Subscale, Negative Symptoms Subscale, and General Psychopathology Subscale. CDSS and ESRS were not correlated with BNSS-TR. The factor structure of the scale was consisting the same items as in the original version. Our study confirms that the Turkish version of BNSS is an applicable tool for the evaluation of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\nReliability and construct validity of the Spanish version of the 6-item CTS symptoms scale for outcomes assessment in carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosales, Roberto S; Martin-Hidalgo, Yolanda; Reboso-Morales, Luis; Atroshi, Isam\n\n2016-03-03\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity of the Spanish version of the 6-item carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms scale (CTS-6). In this cross-sectional study 40 patients diagnosed with CTS based on clinical and neurophysiologic criteria, completed the standard Spanish versions of the CTS-6 and the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH) scales on two occasions with a 1-week interval. Internal-consistency reliability was assessed with the Cronbach alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient, two way random effect model and absolute agreement definition (ICC2,1). Cross-sectional precision was analyzed with the Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM). Longitudinal precision for test-retest reliability coefficient was assessed with the Standard Error of the Measurement difference (SEMdiff) and the Minimal Detectable Change at 95Â % confidence level (MDC95). For assessing construct validity it was hypothesized that the CTS-6 would have a strong positive correlation with the QuickDASH, analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The standard Spanish version of the CTS-6 presented a Cronbach alpha of 0.81 with a SEM of 0.3. Test-retest reliability showed an ICC of 0.85 with a SRMdiff of 0.36 and a MDC95 of 0.7. The correlation between CTS-6 and the QuickDASH was concordant with the a priori formulated construct hypothesis (r 0.69) CONCLUSIONS: The standard Spanish version of the 6-item CTS symptoms scale showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity for outcomes assessment in CTS. The CTS-6 will be useful to clinicians and researchers in Spanish speaking parts of the world. The use of standardized outcome measures across countries also will facilitate comparison of research results in carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nUse of non-parametric item response theory to develop a shortened version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Anzalee; Lewis, Charles; Lindenmayer, Jean-Pierre\n\n2011-11-16\n\nNonparametric item response theory (IRT) was used to examine (a) the performance of the 30 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items and their options ((levels of severity), (b) the effectiveness of various subscales to discriminate among differences in symptom severity, and (c) the development of an abbreviated PANSS (Mini-PANSS) based on IRT and a method to link scores to the original PANSS. Baseline PANSS scores from 7,187 patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder who were enrolled between 1995 and 2005 in psychopharmacology trials were obtained. Option characteristic curves (OCCs) and Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) were constructed to examine the probability of rating each of seven options within each of 30 PANSS items as a function of subscale severity, and summed-score linking was applied to items selected for the Mini-PANSS. The majority of items forming the Positive and Negative subscales (i.e. 19 items) performed very well and discriminate better along symptom severity compared to the General Psychopathology subscale. Six of the seven Positive Symptom items, six of the seven Negative Symptom items, and seven out of the 16 General Psychopathology items were retained for inclusion in the Mini-PANSS. Summed score linking and linear interpolation was able to produce a translation table for comparing total subscale scores of the Mini-PANSS to total subscale scores on the original PANSS. Results show scores on the subscales of the Mini-PANSS can be linked to scores on the original PANSS subscales, with very little bias. The study demonstrated the utility of non-parametric IRT in examining the item properties of the PANSS and to allow selection of items for an abbreviated PANSS scale. The comparisons between the 30-item PANSS and the Mini-PANSS revealed that the shorter version is comparable to the 30-item PANSS, but when applying IRT, the Mini-PANSS is also a good indicator of illness severity.\n\nUse of NON-PARAMETRIC Item Response Theory to develop a shortened version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Nonparametric item response theory (IRT) was used to examine (a) the performance of the 30 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items and their options ((levels of severity), (b) the effectiveness of various subscales to discriminate among differences in symptom severity, and (c) the development of an abbreviated PANSS (Mini-PANSS) based on IRT and a method to link scores to the original PANSS.

The original Barriers to Research Utilization Scale was developed by Funk et al. in the United States of America. Many researchers in various countries have used this scale to identify barriers to research utilization. A methodological study was carried out at four hospitals. The sample consisted of 300 nurses. Data were collected in 2005 using a socio-demographic form (12 questions) and the Turkish version of the Barriers to Research Utilization Scale. A Likert-type scale composed of four sub-factors and 29 items was used. Means and standard deviations were calculated for interval level data. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Language equivalence and content validity were assessed by eight experts. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the Turkish version was made up of four subscales. Internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.92 for the total scale and ranged from 0.73 to 0.80 for the subscales. Total-item correlation coefficients ranged from 0.37 to 0.60. The Turkish version of the scale is similar in structure to the original English language scale.\n\nConstruct Validity of the Dutch Version of the 12-Item Partners in Health Scale: Measuring Patient Self-Management Behaviour and Knowledge in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLenferink, Anke; Effing, Tanja; Harvey, Peter; Battersby, Malcolm; Frith, Peter; van Beurden, Wendy; van der Palen, Job; Paap, Muirne C S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe 12-item Partners in Health scale (PIH) was developed in Australia to measure self-management behaviour and knowledge in patients with chronic diseases, and has undergone several changes. Our aim was to assess the construct validity and reliability of the latest PIH version in Dutch COPD patients. The 12 items of the PIH, scored on a self-rated 9-point Likert scale, are used to calculate total and subscale scores (knowledge; coping; recognition and management of symptoms; and adherence to treatment). We used forward-backward translation of the latest version of the Australian PIH to define a Dutch PIH (PIH(Du)). Mokken Scale Analysis and common Factor Analysis were performed on data from a Dutch COPD sample to investigate the psychometric properties of the Dutch PIH; and to determine whether the four-subscale solution previously found for the original Australian PIH could be replicated for the Dutch PIH. Two subscales were found for the Dutch PIH data (n = 118); 1) knowledge and coping; 2) recognition and management of symptoms, adherence to treatment. The correlation between the two Dutch subscales was 0.43. The lower-bound of the reliability of the total scale equalled 0.84. Factor analysis indicated that the first two factors explained a larger percentage of common variance (39.4% and 19.9%) than could be expected when using random data (17.5% and 15.1%). We recommend using two PIH subscale scores when assessing self-management in Dutch COPD patients. Our results did not support the four-subscale structure as previously reported for the original Australian PIH.\n\nThe Swedish version of the Acceptance of Chronic Health Conditions Scale for people with multiple sclerosis: Translation, cultural adaptation and psychometric properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nForslin, Mia; Kottorp, Anders; Kierkegaard, Marie; Johansson, Sverker\n\n2016-11-11\n\nTo translate and culturally adapt the Acceptance of Chronic Health Conditions (ACHC) Scale for people with multiple sclerosis into Swedish, and to analyse the psychometric properties of the Swedish version. Ten people with multiple sclerosis participated in translation and cultural adaptation of the ACHC Scale; 148 people with multiple sclerosis were included in evaluation of the psychometric properties of the scale. Translation and cultural adaptation were carried out through translation and back-translation, by expert committee evaluation and pre-test with cognitive interviews in people with multiple sclerosis. The psychometric properties of the Swedish version were evaluated using Rasch analysis. The Swedish version of the ACHC Scale was an acceptable equivalent to the original version. Seven of the original 10 items fitted the Rasch model and demonstrated ability to separate between groups. A 5-item version, including 2 items and 3 super-items, demonstrated better psychometric properties, but lower ability to separate between groups. The Swedish version of the ACHC Scale with the original 10 items did not fit the Rasch model. Two solutions, either with 7 items (ACHC-7) or with 2 items and 3 super-items (ACHC-5), demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. Use of the ACHC-5 Scale with super-items is recommended, since this solution adjusts for local dependency among items.\n\nSubjective caregiver burden: validity of the 10-item short version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers BSFC-s.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraessel, Elmar; Berth, Hendrik; Lichte, Thomas; Grau, Hannes\n\n2014-02-20\n\nSubjective burden is a central variable describing the situation encountered by family caregivers. The 10-item short version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC-short/BSFC-s) was developed to provide an economical measure of this variable. The present study examined the reliability and validity of the BSFC-s. Comprehensive data from \"the IDA project\" were the basis of the calculations, which included 351 dyads and examined medical data on people with dementia, interview data from their family caregivers, and health insurance data. A factor analysis was performed to explore the structure of the BSFC-s; Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the internal consistency of the scale. The items were analyzed to determine the item difficulty and the discriminatory power. Construct validity was tested with five hypotheses. To establish the predictive validity of the BSFC-s, predictors of institutionalization at a follow-up time of 2.5 years were analyzed (binary logistic regression). The BSFC-s score adhered to a one-factor structure. Cronbach's alpha for the complete scale was .92. A significant increase in the BSFC-s score was observed when dementia progressed, disturbing behavior occurred more frequently, care requirements increased, and when caregivers were diagnosed with depression. Caregiver burden was the second strongest predictor of institutionalization out of a total of four significant predictors. All hypotheses that referred to the construct validity were supported. The BSFC-short with its ten items is a very economical instrument for assessing the caregiver's total subjective burden in a short time frame. The BSFC-s score has predictive validity for the institutionalization of people with dementia. Therefore it is an appropriate outcome measure to evaluate caregiver interventions. The scale is available for free in 20 languages (http://www.caregiver-burden.eu). This availability facilitates the comparison of international research findings.\n\n[The School Refusal Assessment Scale: Psychometric properties and validation of a modified version].\n\nPubMed\n\nKnollmann, Martin; Sicking, Alexander; Hebebrand, Johannes; Reissner, Volker\n\n2017-07-01\n\nPsychometric properties of the original and a modified version of the Â«EinschÃ¤tzungsskala der SchulverweigerungÂ» (German version of the School Refusal Assessment Scale, SRAS; Kearney & Silverman, 1993; Overmeyer et al., 1994) were analyzed in order to identify alternative ways to revise the SRAS/ESV compared to the existing revision SRAS-R (Kearney, 2002). The SRAS/ESV consists of a parent and a child version and measures four functions of school refusal (avoidance of negative affect related to school settings, escape from aversive social or evaluative situations, attention-getting behavior, positive tangible reinforcement). Data from N = 124 (parent version) respectively N = 156 (child version) patients of a specialized psychiatric outpatient unit for children and adolescents with school-avoiding behavior were obtained. Analyzes included characteristics of items and scales, face-, factorial-, and construct-validity (correlations with other questionnaires, e. g., YSR, CBCL were analyzed). Many items seem to measure overall anxiety instead of the functional aspects of school refusal, one item measures expansive behavior. Four factors were obtained, but they did not reflect the assumed structure of the ESV (e. g., overlap of the two avoidance-related scales). Post-hoc-analyzes with a modified version (elimination of several items with problematic content validity) suggested three factors, convergent and discriminative validity of the modified version was confirmed. Because only some of the afore-mentioned problems have been addressed in the revised version (SRAS-R; Kearney, 2002), a new revision and extension of the German version of the questionnaire covering more aspects of school avoidance behavior (e. g., bullying, depression, somatic complaints, psychosocial factors) is discussed.\n\nThe Dimensional Assessment of Personality Psychopathology Basic Questionnaire: shortened versions item analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAluja, Anton; Blanch, Ãngel; Blanco, Eduardo; MartÃ­-Guiu, Maite; Balada, Ferran\n\n2015-01-13\n\nThis study has been designed to evaluate and replicate the psychometric properties of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Psychopathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) and the DAPP-BQ short form (DAPP-SF) in a large Spanish general population sample. Additionally, we have generated a reduced form called DAPP-90, using a strategy based on a structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology in two independent samples, a calibration and a validation sample. The DAPP-90 scales obtained a more satisfactory fit on SEM adjustment values (average: TLI > .97 and RMSEA < .04) respect to full DAPP-BQ and the 136-item version. According to the factorial congruency coefficients, the DAPP-90 obtains a similar structure to the DAPP-BQ and the DAPP-SF. The DAPP-90 internal consistency is acceptable, with a Cronbach's alpha mean of .75. We did not find any differences in the pattern of relations between the two DAPP-BQ shortened versions and the SCL-90-R factors. The new 90-items version is especially useful when it is difficult to use the long version for diverse reasons, such as the assessment of patients in hospital consultation or in brief psychological assessments.\n\n[Development of a Japanese version of the TALE scale].\n\nPubMed\n\nOchiai, Tsutomu; Oguchi, Takashi\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Thinking About Life Experiences (TALE) Scale (Bluck & Alea, 2011) has three subscales that assess the self, social, and directive functions of autobiographical memory. This study constructs a Japanese version of the TALE Scale and examines its reliability and validity. Fifteen items that assess the three functions of autobiographical memory were translated into Japanese. We conducted an online investigation with 600 men and women between 20-59 years of age. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis identified that the three-factor structure of the Japanese version of the TALE Scale was the same as the original TALE Scale. Sufficient internal consistency of the scale was found, and the construct validity of the scale was supported by correlation analysis. Study 2 confirmed that the test-retest reliabilities of the three subscales were sufficient. Thus, this Japanese version of the TALE Scale is useful to assess autobiographical memory functions in Japan.\n\nPerformance of the Swedish version of the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nJakobsson, Sofie; Taft, Charles; Ãstlund, Ulrika; Ahlberg, Karin\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Revised Piper Fatigue scale is one of the most widely used instruments internationally to assess cancer-related fatigue. The aim of the present study was to evaluate selected psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the RPFS (SPFS). An earlier translation of the SPFS was further evaluated and developed. The new version was mailed to 300 patients undergoing curative radiotherapy. The internal validity was assessed using Principal Axis Factor Analysis with oblimin rotation and multitrait analysis. External validity was examined in relation to the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and in known-groups analyses. Totally 196 patients (response rate = 65%) returned evaluable questionnaires. Principal axis factoring analysis yielded three factors (74% of the variance) rather than four as in the original RPFS. Multitrait analyses confirmed the adequacy of scaling assumptions. Known-groups analyses failed to support the discriminative validity. Concurrent validity was satisfactory. The new Swedish version of the RPFS showed good acceptability, reliability and convergent and- discriminant item-scale validity. Our results converge with other international versions of the RPFS in failing to support the four-dimension conceptual model of the instrument. Hence, RPFS suitability for use in international comparisons may be limited which also may have implications for cross-cultural validity of the newly released 12-item version of the RPFS. Further research on the Swedish version should address reasons for high missing rates for certain items in the subscale of affective meaning, further evaluation of the discriminative validity and assessment of its sensitivity in detecting changes over time.

Study participants were 65 years of age or older and lived in North Manhattan, New York. Of the 1578 study participants who were administered the MMSE 665 completed it in Spanish. : The MMSE contains 20 items that measure the degree of cognitive impairment in the areas of orientation, attention and calculation, registration, recall and language, as well as the ability to follow verbal and written commands. After assessing the dimensionality of the MMSE scale, item response theory person and item parameters were estimated separately for the English and Spanish sample using Samejima's 2-parameter graded response model. Then the DFIT framework was used to assess differential item functioning (DIF) and differential test functioning (DTF). Nine items were found to show DIF; these were items that ask the respondent to name the correct season, day of the month, city, state, and 2 nearby streets, recall 3 objects, repeat the phrase no ifs, no ands, no buts, follow the command, \"close your eyes,\" and the command, \"take the paper in your right hand, fold the paper in half with both hands, and put the paper down in your lap.\" At the scale level, however, the MMSE did not show differential functioning. Respondents to the English and Spanish versions of the MMSE are comparable on the basis of scale scores. However, assessments based on individual MMSE items may be misleading.\n\nTesting Three-Item Versions for Seven of Young's Maladaptive Schema\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBlau, Gary; DiMino, John; Sheridan, Natalie; Pred, Robert S.; Beverly, Clyde; Chessler, Marcy\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ) in either long-form (205- item) or short-form (75-item or 90-item) versions has demonstrated its clinical usefulness for assessing early maladaptive schemas. However, even a 75 or 90-item \"short form\", particularly when combined with other measures, can represent a lengthyâ¦\n\nIRT Item Parameter Scaling for Developing New Item Pools\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKang, Hyeon-Ah; Lu, Ying; Chang, Hua-Hua\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIncreasing use of item pools in large-scale educational assessments calls for an appropriate scaling procedure to achieve a common metric among field-tested items. The present study examines scaling procedures for developing a new item pool under a spiraled block linking design. The three scaling procedures are considered: (a) concurrentâ¦\n\nTranslation and psychometric evaluation of Persian versions of Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale and Impact of Event Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhezeljeh, Tahereh Najafi; Ardebili, Fatimah Mohades; Rafii, Forough; Hagani, Hamid\n\n2013-09-01\n\nBurn as a traumatic life incident manifests severe pain and psychological problems. Specific instruments are needed to evaluate burn patients' psychological issues related to the injury. The aim of this study was to translate and evaluate the reliability and validity of the Persian versions of Impact of Burn Specific Pain Anxiety scale (BSPAS) and Impact of Event Scale (IES). In this cross-sectional study, convenience sampling method was utilized to select 55 Iranian hospitalized burn patients. Combined translation was utilized for translating scales. Alpha cronbach, item-total correlation, convergent and discriminative validity were evaluated. The Cronbach's Î± for both BSPAS- and IES-Persian version was 0.96. Item-total correlation coefficients ranged from 0.70 to 0.90. Convergent construct validity was confirmed by indicating high correlation between the scales designed to measure the same concepts. The mean score of BSPAS- and IES-Persian version was lower for individuals with a lower TBSA burn percentage which assessed discriminative construct validity o"
