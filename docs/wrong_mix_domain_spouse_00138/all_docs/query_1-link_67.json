The empty and populated self is evidenced in Japanese grammar, style, and variation. Although the Japanese self is fundamentally empty, it is populated with multiple aspects such as perceptive, receptive, and hidden self. It is also populated with characters and characteristics such as the middle-aged male and the effeminate onee character. In the course of this book, I illustrate that this conceptualization of the Japanese self is nearly impossible to be adequately or consistently captured in English translation texts. This gives rise to an exploration of the nature and status of the speaker, the very concept of the speaking self in linguistics and pragmatics. This work reports the usefulness of philosophical contrastive pragmatics, the framework in which original and translation texts are analyzed. This is achieved by adopting multidisciplinary methodological approaches such as discourse analysis, conversation analysis, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, translation studies, and literary studies. Hermeneutic interpretive analyses of translation texts reveal critical differences and gaps found across Japanese and English, not only in structure and use, but more fundamentally, in ontological perspectives. Differences between the two languages were most shockingly experienced when in the mid-19th century Japan abandoned two centuries of isolationism. And it was directly experienced by a number of Japanese foreign students who faced severe linguistic and cultural differences as they traveled to the West at the end of the Edo and early Meiji periods. Rutgers University where I have been faculty for many years was once one of the favored destinations of these Japanese students. Among those who came to the American East Coast was Taro Kusakabe, a 22-years old samurai from Echizen (Fukui), who in the fall of 1867 entered Rutgers College. Taro was an excellent student, but perhaps because of his intense program of study conducted in a foreign language as well as the difficulties of adjusting to American life, he suffered from a worsening case of tuberculosis. Taro passed away shortly before his graduation in April of 1870, but Rutgers College awarded him the degree posthumously. Ironically, the year 2020, marred by the covid-19 world pandemic, marked the 150-year commemoration of the passing of Taro Kusakabe who is buried in Willow Grove Cemetery not far from campus. I ponder about how he lived and reconciled the inevitable conflict between his self as a samurai and his self as an individual in a modernizing America.\n\nSenko K.

As I walk through the Old Queens campus of Rutgers University where buildings Taro once studied in still stand, I think of the linguistic and cultural gaps he faced so far away from home, in the college town of New Brunswick, New Jersey. For many years I have enjoyed teaching Japanese language and linguistics at American institutions (in chronological order, the University of Iowa, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Hawaiʻi, Connecticut College, Harvard University, Princeton University, and Rutgers University). I thank all the students and colleagues I have met at various places for their friendship, inspiration, and encouragement. I thank Maj-Britt Mosegaard Hansen, Kerstin Fischer, and Anne Barron, editors of the Studies in Pragmatics series for their faith in me. I express my gratitude to Brill for having provided me the opportunity to express my academic adventures in book form. My special thanks go to Elisa Perotti at Brill for her editorial support and assistance. I am grateful to the Turners and the people of Corning, Iowa, who, many years ago, so generously welcomed me as an American Field Service foreign exchange student. Although that one year I spent at Corning Community High School is long gone, the Midwest remains to be my American roots. I also express my heartfelt gratitude to my late parents, Tsutomu and Harue Kumiya of Yamanashi, Japan, who steadfastly supported my interest in studying abroad. And, time and time again, thank you, Michael, for providing a warm and joyful world where I am free to pursue my academic and artistic interests. skm Summer, 2021 “On the Banks of the Old Raritan”\n\nSenko K.

In the process, persistent questions on the philosophy of language have surfaced. How are we as speaking selves involved in and with language? Anyone who engages in linguistic activity, regardless of status as author, writer, narrator, speaker, or dramatic person, can be viewed as a language-involving self. How is this self realized through the use of language? In turn, this self also participates as a hearer, listener, partner, interactant, reader, or audience. Who or what is this self? Do different kinds of self emerge when different languages are employed? Do differences in meaning and expressivity across languages imply and provide evidence for contrasting ontological views? In this work, I explore a contrastive approach to the concept of self from the perspective of philosophy and pragmatics by examining literary works selected from contemporary Japanese culture. Based on analyses of original and translated texts involving Japanese and English, I propose the concept of an empty and yet populated self. This empty and populated self is evidenced in Japanese grammar, style, and variation. Although the Japanese self is fundamentally empty, it is populated with multiple aspects such as perceptive, receptive, and hidden self. The self is also populated with characters and characteristics such as the middle-aged-male and the effeminate onee character. In the course of this book, I illustrate that this conceptualization of the Japanese self is nearly impossible to be adequately or consistently captured in English translation texts. This empty self observed in Japanese discourse is located in a vacant setting, i.e., an empty place. The concept of emptiness is associated with Nishida’s (1949) philosophy of “place of nothingness” as well as other related Japanese philosophical and religious views. This place of nothingness refers to a selfemerging space where the self embraces discourse interactions filled with rich expressive potential. Far from implying a negative concept, the empty place provides an opening or a clearing for the self’s creative expressivity. The self, constantly responding to, interacting with, and internalizing its activated contexts, fluctuates, transforms, and emerges as it is. Questions surrounding the self have challenged philosophers and intellectuals both in the East and the West. Curiously, each researcher who delves into © Senko K.

In this most basic sense, the philosophical question on the nature of the self is directly linked to language and its use. With our encounters engaging multiple languages in our world, an exploration into a philosophy of language from the perspective of Japanese grammar and discourse in a contrastive context is expected to bring some challenging insights. I trust that the pursuit of human knowledge should always return to the issue surrounding the self and language. Still, one must admit that despite its theoretical significance, in linguistics and pragmatics, the concept of self has not been fully addressed (Kecskes 2012). In this work the intimate relationship between the self and language is explored from the perspective of philosophical pragmatics. By philosophical pragmatics I refer to the pursuit of an ontological understanding in the hermeneutic approach to language in practice. More concretely, this study takes a philosophical contrastive pragmatics approach conducting the contrastive analysis of original and translated works in literary genres. Attention is paid to how the language is formed, styled, and performed as a self-revealing phenomenon in Japanese. I focus on the Japanese features in the source text that express subjectivity as well as create characters, and how these phenomena are reflected or not in the English target text. My analyses involve linguistic and sociolinguistic phenomena incorporating multiple frameworks, such as functional grammatical analysis, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, pragmatics, variation studies, textual analysis, and contrastive stylistics. This method is particularly valuable when translation texts are selected from different language families. The richness and weakness of each language as well as across languages are made evident, and repeatedly observed translation gaps provide sufficient grounds for exploring a philosophical interpretation of the self. A philosophical contrastive pragmatics allows the researcher to engage in philosophical inquiries on the basis of language, especially by understanding the self as a language user (or performer) placed in the context of a given situation. Adopting this framework makes an ontological inquiry as a part of pragmatics, broadening the scope of its disciplinary territory. This approach requires culturally practiced language data for pragmaticsoriented analyses. The data selected for this study include Japanese novels written by contemporary authors such as Banana Yoshimoto, Kenzaburo Oe, Hiromi Kawakami, Miyuki Miyabe, and Keigo Higashino, along with their published English translations. In the majority of my earlier works, examples are taken from multiple genres of Japanese discourse, and I myself have provided glosses and translations. In this study, I focus on published Japanese and translated texts, minimizing the unreliability inherently associated with relying only on self-translated examples. Senko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n5\n\nThe data support my thesis that the Japanese language is suffused with expressions associated with subjectivity, characters, and characteristics not easily translated into English. I also examine a Japanese story with four different versions of English translation, Japanese and English translations of a Russian novel as well as two separate Japanese translations of an American short story. Critical features observed in examples taken from a total of 28 works involving bi-directional translations are offered as evidence. Given the nature of data, some limitations of this work should be noted. First, the concept of an empty yet populated self is based on observations made in limited and specific source and target texts, thus conclusions may or may not apply elsewhere. Second, this work primarily analyzes the original Japanese text in contrast with its English translation. If the direction is reversed, the investigation through philosophical contrastive pragmatics may produce different results. Third, this work explores senses of the speaking self as evidenced in language and discourse and does not address aspects of a personhood directly involving psychological, social, and cultural phenomena. While it is hoped that this work generally adds to a fundamental understanding of the self, the linguistic self accessed through language and discourse tells only a partial story of the self and selves. It is useful to remind ourselves that the discourse of translation entails much more than a mere transfer of corresponding words. Curiously, the absence of a corresponding translation sometimes communicates more than its presence. Consider that when translation is read as a part of the target society’s literature, the missing expressivity does not evoke a sense that something is lacking. In other words, what is absent in the first place cannot be identified as being “missed.” This is a part of the reality surrounding the translation itself. This awareness guides us in appreciating that language is exceedingly complex, and gaps in translation are difficult (or nearly impossible) to overcome. Differences are found in the core of messages stemming from culturally endorsed ontological views, which can be reached only through careful contrastive analyses. We engage in language as a part of our interpersonal human experience, and this experience is often initiated as a performance in which we present our selves. At that moment, we create our selves as speakers, i.e., locutionary agents, of the language. We may intuitively experience our sense of being without using words. Yet, even in silence, we inevitably experience our selves influenced by language. That is because even our unspoken everyday experiences are fundamentally identified through the form of socially endorsed language. So is the case of our senses of self. The self emerges even when we are merely thinking or verbalizing a soliloquy, which requires a common language shared with others. We are creatures in and of language. As children of language, we cannot escape\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n6\n\nchapter 1\n\nfrom the question surrounding the concept of self (or more accurately, multiple aspects of selves) and language. Given the recognized diversity in our global cultural environment, reaching for an understanding of the self from different perspectives should further our perception of how we as humans interact with language in diverse ways. To explore the concept of self from the perspective of philosophical contrastive pragmatics, two related issues are discussed. First, how is the self construal related to the critical concept of context in pragmatics? Second, how is the self understood in association with the inherent relationship between language and thought? To address these questions, in what follows past studies on themes associated with the self in pragmatics, philosophy, and psychology are reviewed. These approaches provide an ontological context for the empty and populated self proposed in this work.\n\n2\n\nThe Self and Context in Pragmatics\n\nContext is a critical concept in the study of pragmatics. The movement in pragmatics represented by Mey (1993) defines itself as a study of language and its use in context. The approach in pragmatics places more emphasis on language usage than on its referential meaning. In Mey’s view, “it is much more interesting to try and find out why people say something than whether what they say is true or false” (1993: 14, original emphasis). Emphasis on “why” directs us toward the speaker as opposed to the speech itself. This approach necessitates a critical inquiry into speaking selves, their social identities, communication purposes, and ways of meaning in interaction. Again, to quote Mey, pragmatics encompasses “the science of language seen in relation to its users” (1993: 5). For the purpose of this work, pragmatics is critical in two ways, its importance to context where linguistic activity takes place and the significance of the person who engages in language. In this work the relationship between the language and its context is further explored so that the Japanese concept of the self is made evident in contrast with English. Instead of focusing on the meanings or functions associated with context, this work interprets meaning as ontological messages related to the speaking self. In other words, it is a philosophical approach to language from the framework of pragmatics which makes use of context as a guide for interpretation. Context, itself, may be viewed as being external or internal (House 2006). External context involves situational and cultural factors, while internal context involves cognitive factors. Based on the external context, this work exam-\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n7\n\nines how the internal context operates involving cognitive, psychological, and ontological aspects. The devices providing the context reflect, activate, and project the emergent construal of the self evident in languages. Contrasting these devices brings to the fore how notions of self differ across languages guiding our task of exploring the concept of self. 2.1 Contextualization and Contextualization Cues In pragmatics, the concept of context is more accurately understood as a phenomenon of “contextualization.” Contextualization captures the dynamic relationship between context and language, and is understood to involve more than a set of pre-existing, pre-fixed discrete variables (Auer and Luzio 1992). Here, the context and language are in a mutually reflexive and interactionally influencing relationship, where language shapes context as much as context shapes language. Contextualization is a term introduced earlier by Gumperz (1982) and it “involves the process by which we evaluate message meaning and sequencing patterns in relation to aspects of the surface structure of the message” (1982: 162). Cues signaling contextualization are characterized as: (…) any feature of linguistic form that contributes to the signaling of contextual presuppositions. Such cues may have a number of such linguistic realizations depending on the historically given linguistic repertoire of the participants. The code, dialect and style switching processes, (…) prosodic phenomena (…) as well as choice among lexical and syntactic options, formulaic expressions, conversational openings, closings and sequencing strategies can all have similar contextualizing functions. gumperz 1982: 131\n\nStudies based on contextualization cues can be traced to earlier research in intercultural communication. Gumperz and Tannen (1979) suggest the possibility of communication difficulties associated with misinterpretation of contexualization cues. They introduce the interactional effect of complementary schismogenesis, where each participant in conversation sticks to one’s own contextualization cues for conventional interpretation. Under this circumstance, the participant’s behavior results in interactional breakdowns. In pragmatics, contextualization and contextualization cues have also been applied for identifying differences in language performance between native and nonnative speakers. These studies reveal different functions of contextualization cues, for example in French (Ducharme and Bernard 2001) and Japanese (Ishida 2006; Masuda 2016). Contextualization in a broader sense also provides\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n8\n\nchapter 1\n\na tool for investigating its relationship to social power in primary education (Dorr-Bremme 1990). In this work, focus is placed not so much on the difficulty of intercultural or cross-linguistic communication but on the concept of self supported by contextualization cues and evidenced in the discourse of literary genres. Although studies of contextualization cues have been based on communication, especially on face-to-face conversational interaction, this work does not analyze conversational interaction per se. Its interactive nature, however, is evident in the selected data; dramatic persons interact in specific contexts in the novel, and readers interact with the producers of the original and translation texts. It is true that literary texts and translations are static in nature and they represent carefully thought-out pieces of verbal art. However, both texts require speaking selves (in terms of writer, narrator, and dramatic persons). As in intercultural face-to-face exchanges, difficulties (or gaps) in communication exist between original and translated texts. Instead of identifying these difficulties for improving intercultural understanding, for learning a second or foreign language, or for creating an appropriate translation, this work explores ontological views traceable to the features and to the contextualization cues of literary discourse. In the contextualization research, both internal and external evidence may be sought (Gumperz 1982). Internal evidence is found in the interactional processes themselves, whereas external evidence is obtained from informants. Internal evidence is obtained by closely examining the process of exchange between participants, such as turn-taking and rhythmic coordination. In this work, only internal evidence is addressed, but evidence of a different nature. Communication in literary text does not occur in the way live conversation does, but contextualization cues in the text guide us in discovering the similarities and differences in ontological positions. Given that context and contextualization are key to the process of translation, the concept of re-contextualization proposed by House (2006) should be mentioned. House (2006) argues that when translating, the context recognized in the source language undergoes a re-contextualization in the target language. She insists that the concept of contextualization proposed by Gumperz (1982) is not applicable to translation of written text because the interaction does not represent speech, and does not involve on-going interactions. Admittedly, literary text does not directly involve an on-going speech event. However, the translated literary text must be intimately integrated into the target language which requires another process of contextualization. The translator must create a new text that successfully balances a context across two languages. When translation involves typologically unrelated languages, as in Japanese and English,\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n9\n\nthe contextualization process demands delicate adjustment and innovation. In this sense, the manipulation of context in translation embraces contextualization, re-contextualization, and new contextualization. The terminology aside, when contrasting original and translated texts in literary genres, focusing on context, contextualization cues as well as the re-contextualization process provides a useful approach in exploring how the self is projected in contrasted contexts. 2.2 Self in the Self-Contextualization Process In my earlier studies, I have proposed a related concept of self-contextualization (Maynard 1989) along with concepts such as the speaking self and contextual transformation. This section revisits this approach in bridging the concept of self to the contextualization process. Maynard (1989) recognizes the self situated in changing contexts of situation. Linguistic expressions are energized by its context and, in turn, the context is renewed by the very use of language. In this process we manipulate how we present our selves in a mutually complementary relationship which I call “self-contextualization.” Self-contextualization asserts that a speaker selfcontextualizes in verbal and nonverbal communication by perceiving, identifying, and evaluating the overall as well as immediate contexts through which the self properly locates itself. Self-contextualization involves two interacting stages, “contextual interpretation” and “contextual transformation.” The first stage involves one’s understanding of actual signs and other structural and interactional knowledge. The second stage requires a processing of ideas and intention to transform information in such a way as to be suitable for each exchange. Since the actual situation in communication changes from moment to moment, participants must continually self-contextualize, with each change being mutually incorporated in each other’s self-contextualization (Maynard 1989). To identify this mutually created context of interaction, one must integrate different types of information. First, linguistic knowledge such as grammatical structure, as well as the semantics of lexical units come to mind. Another type involves social and environmental information, including physical settings and sociocultural assumptions about the self and partner. Knowledge regarding discourse organization such as thematic and narrative structures must be integrated into the process of self-contextualization. In addition, selfcontextualizing refers to incorporating information regarding the partner’s personality and attitude as well as one’s mutual feelings toward the partner How one behaves in communication, then, is deeply influenced by the context of each situation. Although our thoughts play a role in determining our\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n10\n\nchapter 1\n\nactions, those actions are always influenced by interactions with partners (or audience). And through such context-interacting behavior, we locate our own selves in multiple ways in a society. In this sense, self is always contextualized by way of language and discourse. Ultimately, the discovery of the self must be pursued from the perspective of pragmatics, foregrounding the self both as language user and context manipulator. Language use in relation to context has become a central theme in pragmatics and discourse analysis. For example, Paltridge (2006), in his introduction to discourse analysis, develops the theme of language in social and cultural contexts including social class, gender, and ideology. Gee (2012) introduces Discourse (with a capital “D”) to focus on multiple Discourses with multiple contexts in which a speaker engages in a social action. In his social linguistics, Discourses are much more than language, and they involve the speaker’s participation and enactment of the right kind of person in the right kind of context. Discourses are ways of behaving, interacting, thinking, believing, and speaking, always in the process of self-contextualization. In this work, I define the self as it emerges through language and discourse as follows. Self is a person, a locutionary agent who speaks and engages in language activity in context with the intention to communicate. In conversation, self is involved directly in the verbal act. In fictional discourse, however, the concept of self includes a variety of labels. We are aware that behind every literary work stands the writer or author. And within the narrative the author may assume the narrator’s role as well as the role of any participant as a dramatic person. Another related term is the partner, who appears as a conversation participant or a reader. Our speech is always addressed to someone including even to one’s self. Significantly in literary genres, partners may be not only dramatic persons but also readers outside of the novel’s world. The self is not an abstract entity. Rather, it is an actor and performer. The self is the flesh-and-blood body-engaging person who engages in language. In this regard, Merleau-Ponty (1962) offers guidance. Merleau-Ponty emphasizes that to describe the phenomenon of speech and the specific act of meaning, one must leave behind the traditional subject-object dichotomy. He laments that we have become accustomed, through the influence of the Cartesian tradition, to jettison the subject. Indeed, the reflective attitude of cogito has tended to purify the notions of body and mind to an extreme, and has resulted in its distinct division. A subject is merely what it thinks it is, and an object is something known to the subject. But, Merleau-Ponty reminds us that the “experience of our own body (…) reveals to us an ambiguous mode of existing” (1962: 198). In fact we have no way of knowing the self and that of the ambiguous existence, other than living it.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n11\n\nIf language is thought to function only in terms of conveying propositional content, the thinking self is incapable of experiencing emotion, creating personally expressive forms of language, and manipulating language-involving performances. Furthermore, language conceived only as abstract thought cannot be self-manipulated as a part of performance. Merleau-Ponty emphasizes that the “word and speech must somehow cease to be a way of designating things or thoughts” and rather, they must “become the presence of that thought in the phenomenal world, and, moreover, not its clothing but its token or its body” (1962: 182). The idea represented by Merleau-Ponty (1962) that the self is embodied has been pursued in disciplines including psychology, cognitive science, sociology, and pragmatics. These studies under the term “embodiment” take the position that the cognition depends on experiences perceived by one’s body, and that the body itself is embedded in psychological and cultural context. In cognitive science it is understood “the world we construct is grounded in our experience as creatures with bodies who interact with their surroundings through physical processes involving sensory and motor activity” (Johnson 2018: 524). In investigating social interaction, Mondada (2019) emphasizes the importance of focusing not only on language but gesture, gaze, body posture, movement, and embodied manipulation of objects. This is because participants of conversation engage with their bodies for communicating and for sensing each other and the world. Understanding the self as being embodied is essential for exploring multiple aspects of the self. We must avoid assuming that language is merely a symbolic representation of an objectively existing reality. We must reject treating language as a human faculty independent of perception, motor movement, and image formation.1 This is because “linguistic meaning is embodied; it arises from our biological capacities and our physical and sociocultural experiences as beings functioning in our environment” (Marmaridou 2000: 4). In fact, as Burdelski (2010) reports, socializing politeness routines in the childhood education environment in Japan requires both verbal and non-verbal politeness routines as a part of embodied social action. One may be unaware of the bodied self, but it is this self that perceives, creates, and manipulates the language in context. Our senses of self are discovered\n\n1 The concept of embodiment is applied in linguistic analysis in concrete and direct ways. For example, Zlatev and Blomberg (2016) phenomenologically investigate expressions of nonactual motion, e.g., The road goes through the forest on the basis of embodied subjectivity. They find that the meaning of such a sentence is intrinsically layered in human bodily experiences, emphasizing that the language is grounded in the embodied self.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n12\n\nchapter 1\n\nin our experience made possible by the embodied self, and this self engages ideas and imagination all located in the context of communication. We become selves in context when we are engaged in communication; we become selves when we interactionally perform and are pragmatically realized. My concept of self approached from the pragmatics perspective is opposed to a concept of self that is abstract, isolated, and unchanging. I should add that my approach also embraces a self that is free and often playful, willfully deviating from established or recognized language use.\n\n3\n\nLanguage, Thought, and the Self\n\nThis section discusses the relationship between language and thought focusing on the concept of self. Initially, the controversy of linguistic relativity is reviewed and discussed, followed by an appreciation of the undeniable relationships between language and its associated ontological views. In the process, I present my position toward linguistic relativity and reflect on how it plays a role in the framework of philosophical contrastive pragmatics. 3.1 The Linguistic Relativity Issue Linguistic relativity, or what Leavitt (2011) aptly refers to as linguistic relativities implying multiple versions, has a long and winding history. The linguistic relativity hypothesis has been a major topic of controversy in Western thought since the Enlightenment. It has been an enduring theme for anyone interested in linguistics, pragmatics, philosophy, anthropology, social psychology, translation studies, and cultural studies, among others. Perhaps Whorf (1956) serves as a starting point for our discussion. Whorf presents his position in his frequently quoted excerpt as given below. Formulation of ideas is not an independent process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is part of a particular grammar, and differs, from slightly to greatly, between different grammars. We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impression which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. whorf 1956: 212\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n13\n\nWhorf’s position stated above has, for decades, stirred positive and negative responses from scholars, and the controversy of whether people who speak different languages think differently lingers on today. Linguistic relativity assumes that languages can differ significantly in lexical meanings and syntactic constructions which can affect how its speakers perceive and conceptualize the world, and accordingly, think. An extreme case of this takes the position that language shapes thought, i.e., linguistic determinism. A moderate position understands that language can influence and affect thinking. Different interpretations of the Whorfian hypothesis aside, Whorf’s analysis has come under attack (Pullum 1991; Pinker 1994), and the cognitive approach to linguistics has fueled an anti-Whorfian movement. It is argued that we need to conceptualize a category before labeling it as such, i.e., cognition or natural human instinct precedes language. Among cognitive linguists, universals took precedence over linguistic diversity to the point where some of the facts were suppressed. In a way Whorf bashing has become a pastime for many scholars (Leavitt 2011). On the other hand, since the days of Whorf, the notion of linguistic relativity has persisted, if only in the shadow of dominant linguistic approaches. For example, Lyons (1994) shares his thought as the following. I do subscribe, however, to a more moderate version of Whorfianism (…), according to which the language to which one is exposed—the language that is the product of the use of a particular langue—facilitates one way rather than another of categorizing phenomena and talking about them. lyons 1994: 12–13, original emphasis\n\nInterest in linguistic relativity has continued as evidenced by the availability of edited volumes revisiting the issue (Gumperz and Levinson 1996; Pütz and Verspoor 2000). Linguistic relativity has recently experienced a substantial resurgence in scholarly interest (Everett 2013; Lucy 2016). Empirical studies involving many different languages have uncovered subtle but convincing interactions between language and thought, leading to more nuanced versions of the hypothesis. After examining recent empirical research, Everett (2013) finds that many studies support the theme endorsed by linguistic relativity in various degrees and forms. Given the discoveries made in experimental psychology, anthropology, and ethnomethodology in recent years, linguistic relativity is now generally viewed as being undeniable. Whorf has made a comeback, indeed. Everett (2013) distinguishes classical Whorfianism from the work of contemporary researchers (i.e., Neo-Whorfian scholars) who seek to substantiate a\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n14\n\nchapter 1\n\nmoderate version of the relativity hypothesis. Everett reviews research on spatial orientation, the construal of time, numerical cognition, the perception of colors, the categorization of objects among others, and concludes that they provide evidence to support different kinds of linguistic relativity, some representing a comparatively weak variety but some others having a major impact on human cognition. He takes the position that a majority of the data examined suggests that systematic differences in linguistic practice can and do create divergent cognitive habits. Everett endorses the relativistic position but cautions by reminding us that “careful examinations of the relevant data often suggest that more nuanced approaches to the answer (rather than a vociferous ‘yes’ or ‘no’), and to the formulation of the question itself, may be warranted” (2013: 1). Valid or not, the linguistic relativity hypothesis remains an open question. Many languages (including Mandarin and English, two major languages) are examined, but many others are not. Empirical evidence reported so far offers undeniable support for linguistic relativity, but more studies involving unexamined languages and discourse genres are required. It is reasonable to grant that some degrees of cognitive universals exist. For it is not the case that form and use of language determine what people can possibly think or experience. Humans share some cognitive capacities regardless of languages spoken. Still, specific languages do influence what people usually and habitually think and experience; some languages require certain kinds of cognitive processes while others do not. These differences across languages lead to variabilities in certain nonlinguistic cognitive activities as well. I do not prescribe to the extreme view that language determines thought, but neither can I absolutely deny the concept of linguistic relativity. An empirical study involving Japanese and English supports this position. Imai and Mazuka (2007) examine how the labels and the count-mass structure in Japanese and English are associated with different construals of individuation. Their conclusions on linguistic relativity are two-fold. Although the distinction concerning individuation of objects is universally shared, linguistic relativity is partially observed at different developmental stages among Japanese speakers as well as across Japanese- and English-speaking subjects. The conclusion drawn by Imai and Mazuka (2007) offers substantial support for the position that human cognition is neither entirely universal nor entirely relative. Linguistic relativity plays multiple roles in complex ways and influences the speaker’s cognitive processes. When accessing linguistic relativity, Whorf’s (1956) more moderate phrase “fashions of speaking” makes sense. Whorf suggests language as a whole (not just a lexical item or a grammatical structure) encourages certain ways of view-\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n15\n\ning the world. I have examined discourse phenomena from the perspective of pragmatics across Japanese and English in many of my earlier works (Maynard 1989, 1993a, 1993b, 2000, 2002), and have identified differences as fashions of speaking. In this work, the Japanese empty and populated self is understood to represent, motivate, and reflect a fundamental element of Japanese fashions of speaking. In addition, it is important to remind ourselves that relativistic phenomena may exist among speakers of the same language, particularly when aspects of linguistic practices significantly vary. It should also be emphasized that not all elements of human cognitive processes are singularly determined by the speaker’s native language. Furthermore, people often learn multiple languages and incorporate new features into their native languages, leading to multiple language-and-thought relationships. A critical point when questioning the scope of linguistic relativity involves the influence of language when it is not used for communication. My position is that language influences thought while not in active use, and the concept of self in Japanese is sustained as a basic ontological understanding. The effects of language are not only deeply rooted but also form long-term habits of thought; they are not temporary thought patterns that come to be only during actual interaction. On this issue Reines and Prinz (2009) as well as Wolff and Holmes (2011) offer further guidance. Reines and Prinz (2009) focus on two theses, i.e., Habitual Whorfianism and Ontological Whorfianism. Habitual Whorfianism refers to the position in which “languages influence psychological processes because they instill habits of thought that lead us to think in certain ways by default” (2009: 1028). Ontological Whorfianism refers to the position in which “languages influence psychological processes because they lead us to organize the world into categories that differ from those we would discover without language” (2009: 1029). They argue that these two Whorfian theses offer the most promising interpretations of the evidence provided by recent empirical research. After reviewing some representative empirical results such as grammatical gender (Spanish and German), frame of reference (Tzeltal), special categories (Korean), and noun types (Yucatec Maya), they conclude that language shapes the categorical boundaries that constitute our subjective organization of the world, and it influences our ontologies. Thus, their answer to the question is positive; language influences cognition while not in use. The process of how the self is experienced and understood can be approached in the same manner. Although the self emerges through language use, it lingers on beyond the moment of its use. The Japanese language makes it possible for its speakers to attend to features of the world that embrace the\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n16\n\nchapter 1\n\nempty and populated self. These features become habitual, and reinforce a specific way of conceptualizing the self. The Japanese language imposes the types of category boundaries unavailable otherwise. In this sense, language is not merely a vehicle for expressing thoughts; it enables its speakers to habitually conceptualize their selves in their own ways. Another study exploring the function of language in relation to linguistic relativity offers a further supportive insight. Wolff and Holmes (2011) identify the possible effects of language on thought across a wide range of domains, including motion, color, spatial relations, and number. They conclude that although the literature on linguistic relativity remains contentious, there is growing support for the view that language has a profound effect on thought. Lamenting the idea that linguistic relativity is taken as a mere weak form of linguistic determinism, they argue that the strong-weak distinction oversimplifies a more complicated picture, and it ignores what is emerging in recent research. Their survey of the field suggests that the following five versions of the Whorfian hypothesis have garnered convincing empirical support. 1. Thinking occurs before language use (thinking for speaking). 2. Linguistic and nonlinguistic codes compete against each other (language as meddler). 3. Linguistic codes extend nonlinguistic thinking (language as augmenter). 4. Thinking is directed toward properties highlighted by language (language as spotlight). 5. Language engages a schematic mode of processing (language as inducer). The concept of the Japanese self lingers on and facilitates specific ways of thinking. Japanese words and structures may highlight specific properties, where linguistic signs may act as a spotlight, augmenting certain aspects of the self by making them more salient than others. Self-expressions in Japanese may induce a given mode of processing, which may persist even when Japanese speakers engage in other nonlinguistic tasks. The Japanese language induces a kind of self which becomes a resource for speaking, which in turn continues its process of meddling, augmenting, spotlighting, and inducing certain ways of being. In this circular manner involving the process of language and thought, the Japanese language is intimately associated with the concept of the self. The self as proposed in this work serves as a flowing cognitive undercurrent situated in a Japanese ontological understanding. 3.2 Language and Ontological Views The relation between language and ontology has been approached from philosophical and psychological perspectives, some of which are presented below. Discussing language and thought in association with the self, Heidegger (1971\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n17\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n[1959]) offers some philosophical insight. Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenological approach in his ontology of Being is most directly presented in his work On the Way to Language (1971 [1959]). Before reviewing his position on language and thought, his approach to language itself should be introduced. In essence, Heidegger thinks that one should not understand language as existing in the abstract nor as an object existing out there; instead, one should investigate language as practiced in our ordinary lives. Referring to Humboldt’s view of language not as ergon but as energeia, Heidegger (1971 [1959]) insists that language should be viewed not as a product, but as a speaking activity, and proposes that the way to understand language must be based on what he calls “Saying” or “Showing.”2 Saying and Showing foreground the person who engages in language in the actual situation of interaction through a process of what he calls “Appropriation.” Appropriation “yields the opening of the clearing in which present beings can persist and from which absent beings can depart” (1971 [1959]: 127). And it is a process through which all present and absent beings are brought into where “they show themselves in what they are, and where they abide according to their kind” (1971 [1959]: 127). Heidegger finds a significant importance in language whose practice instantiates the Appropriation process itself. He concludes by proclaiming that “(L)anguage is the house of Being because language, as Saying, is the mode of Appropriation” (1971 [1959]: 135). Understanding the relationship between language and Being in this way, Heidegger (1971 [1959]) identifies language as a source for his philosophy, and issues the following statement connecting how language is designed to reflect the fundamental nature of humanity. The ability to speak is what marks man as man. This mark contains the design of his being. Man would not be man if it were denied him to speak unceasingly, from everywhere and every which way, in many variations, and to speak in terms of an “it is” that most often remains unspoken. Language, in granting all this to man, is the foundation of human being. We are, then, within language and with language before all else. heidegger 1971 [1959]: 112\n\nA related critical point Heidegger (1971 [1959]) makes lies in the cross-linguistic variability of the relationship between the self and language. In Heidegger’s view, all human languages are true languages but this holds true only when\n\n2 Humboldt’s position is explained in Mueller-Vollmer and Messling (2017).\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n18\n\nchapter 1\n\nthey are used in specific societies as they adhere to their particular destinies. Accordingly, languages contain different designs or plans that guide us to different ontological views. Heidegger insists that a natural language would never occur in and of itself without a destiny, stating “(A)ll language is historical, even where man does not know history in the modern European sense” (Heidegger 1971 [1959]: 133). Approaching language as a participatory event (of Saying and Showing), Heidegger recognizes the destined variability across languages. Another important approach toward language and the concept of self comes from a social psychological perspective, particularly Vygotsky (Lucy and Wertsch 1987). Vygotsky (1962 [1934]) addresses the relationships among language, thought, and society in the context of child development. As I have touched upon in my earlier studies (Maynard 1993a, 2002), Vygotsky (1962 [1934]) addresses the issue of semiotic mediation in the context of child development. In Vygotsky’s view, the cognitive development of an individual child is accomplished through a process of internalization of language, which is first used by the child in the socialization process. Vygotsky emphasizes that the higher psychological processes an individual attains directly reflect the social processes in which that individual has participated during earlier developmental stages, especially through the use of language. When Vygotsky takes a position that “all higher mental functions are internalized social relationships” (Wertsch 1979: 164), we are reminded that human beings retain the functions of social interaction even in our innermost private spheres. Once speech is internalized, it continues interacting with human consciousness and regulating cognitive activity. If so, one’s ontological view is dependent on one’s language and language-engaging interactional experiences. Although Vygotsky himself does not refer to the language in literary genres, when Vygotsky uses the term “word,” he means more than the morphological unit. The term “word” used by Vygotsky “does not refer solely to morphological units; rather, phrases, sentences, and entire texts fall under this category as well” (Wertsch 1979: 158). Japanese literary works and their translation texts selected for this study are expected to provide a reasonable resource for investigating the relationship between language and its ontological view. At this point, for further clarification of the relationship between language and ontology, perhaps a comparison between Vygotsky and Whorf is useful. Although they worked in different intellectual settings, each viewed language as a social and cultural phenomenon, and understood individual thought to be socially influenced, serving as a mediator between the self and society. Vygotsky, in his sociocultural, historical, and ontological approach to the mind, was interested in the developmental stages of the form and function of speech in a single language. In contrast, Whorf, with his view that human languages are\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n19\n\ndifferent in important ways, was interested in documenting the diversity of language forms. Vygotsky focused on diachronic changes within a single language, and Whorf, on synchronic comparisons across languages. In Vygotsky’s view, language transforms thought in the process of socialization, and this facilitates and promotes the development of human consciousness resulting in the emergence of higher conceptual forms (Lucy and Wertsch 1987). Viewing that language constrains thought, influencing it in culturally specific patterns, Whorf interprets the influence of language on thought in terms of its implications for limiting human awareness. For the purpose of this work, Vygotsky and Whorf offer complementary interpretive resources. By combining both, it is possible to understand the language-and-thought relationship both diachronically (historically and intralinguistically) and synchronically (comparatively and inter-linguistically). This work takes into account both the Vygotskian understanding of language’s psychosocial messages, and the Whorfian theme of cross-linguistic variability. Finally, Taylor (2016) should be mentioned for advancing an interesting approach toward language and ontology. In his earlier study, Taylor (1985) insists that the expressive dimension is fundamental to language and therefore is more important than the designative dimension. He criticizes the Cartesian view of language that focuses on the propositional meaning where the method of isolating terms and tracing correlations with objects plays a central role. Regarding the root of this mistaken position, Taylor argues that “(T)his was grounded in the view, common to Descartes and his empiricist critics, that the contents of the mind were in principle open to transparent inspection by the subject himself” (Taylor 1985: 241). In The Language Animal, Taylor (2016) interprets the Whorfian hypothesis not in terms of designative dimensions (such as simplified concepts of time and color), but more in terms of expressive functions. In his view, the cultural differences observed today lie deeper than those surface lexical items, and complex differences expand to ethical, social, and political dimensions. We are language animals who use language creatively and interpersonally, far beyond the designative dimension, and in this process the language serves as a constitutive means for the self. We are of language and are defined in terms of language more deeply than commonly understood. Along with this position, the relationship between language and ontology appears in a different light and bears a renewed philosophical significance. It implies that languages are expected to lead to different ontological views, i.e., “ontological relativity,” where one can discover philosophical messages of language both on micro- and macro-levels. Given that past studies on language, thought, and self primarily focused on speech and interaction,\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n20\n\nchapter 1\n\nfocusing on the literary text and its translation in this work expands the scope of analysis. In the course of this volume, not just one linguistic phenomenon but a wide range of linguistic devices and discourse strategies on multiple levels are examined. Most relevantly, this work asks the ontological question incorporating Japanese intellectual traditions that have been underrepresented in the linguistic relativity debate. It is hoped that this work paves the way for moving the debate on the language-and-thought controversy away from an extreme polarization of perspectives, but rather, toward a productive discussion on the nature of languages’ undeniable influence on cognition and emotion. In the process we come closer to embracing the varied manners in which humans relatively conceive, perceive, and experience their selves in multiple ways across languages and cultures.\n\n4\n\nData\n\n4.1 Study of Literary Works Data for this study are selected from literary genres. This is because the literary text, such as the novel, provides relatively restriction-free space where one’s inner thoughts and feelings are richly expressed. Ostensibly objective writings such as news reports or legal documents do not strongly reflect the writer’s personal attitude and therefore are not suitable for an ontological pursuit. Lukács (1971) and Bakhtin (1981) approach the novel as a resource for literary and philosophical studies. Lukács (1971), in his attempt to find the novel’s social and historical significance, positions the novel as a means through which a problematic individual reveals his or her self, stating that it is the road “towards clear self-recognition” (1971: 80). Discourse of the novel is expected to provide a useful site for exploring the concept of self. Interestingly, Lukács (1971) compares Dostoevsky’s novels with traditional Romantic novels claiming that Dostoevsky’s works defy genre identification. Still, it is in Dostoevsky’s works that Bakhtin (1981) pursues his philosophy of language. Bakhtin views the novel as a kind of linguistic behavior, as a verbal event. To fully understand it, we must incorporate the surrounding contextual information. The novel offers an information-rich text that reflects the social context of which it is a part. For example, direct quotation appearing in the novel does not merely represent conversation performed by dramatic persons within the novelistic universe, but, significantly, it reflects and endorses the sociocultural and philosophical values of its time. For Bakhtin (1981), discourse of the novel is uniquely rich and alive, possessing critical qualities absent in other genres. The novel is always in the process\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n21\n\nof forming, and only the novel is receptive to innovative linguistic forms and new textual interpretation. In fact Bakhtin insists that to study genres other than the novel (e.g., epic) is to study dead language, and to study the discourse of the novel is to study a language that is alive, young, and currently forming. Discourse of the novel is free, and remains receptive to social changes and adjustments people make in their lives. Novels incorporate voices of people who use varied language styles with complex and overlapping features. Bakhtin insists that novels remain semantically receptive to languages of other genres because they maintain a timely relationship with a constantly changing reality, and their expressions are an approximation of ordinary everyday language. As summarized above, of all genres, literary genres selected for this study are suitable for philosophical contrastive pragmatics. Most fundamentally, literary text is ideal as a data source because it often allows the researcher access to inner feelings of the author, narrator, and dramatic persons, all closely associated with ontological perspectives. I must add here that discourse of the novel constitutes an undeniable part of language culture. As I discuss in the course of this volume, novels represent mediated discourse containing stereotyped expressions such as genderand age-associated variations, often no longer in use in ordinary language practice. One may argue that discourse of the novel, for not consisting of naturally occurring speech, fails to supply adequate data for a philosophical pragmatics approach. However, I emphasize that language in Japanese literary genres is a part of language practice forming a significant phenomenon of the Japanese language culture, thus providing a reasonable resource for this work. I have selected literary works whose published translations are readily available. Self-produced Japanese examples with self-produced English translations are likely to ignore language phenomena beyond the researcher’s immediate access. Data created by third parties provide the distance necessary for objective analyses, and this feature supports pragmatics analysis for which the manipulation of data should be minimized. Although the usefulness of translation texts is recognized, I am aware that the reliability of the translation text itself remains controversial. In this regard, Kawahara’s (2011) summary on the history of equivalence offers guidance. In the past, scholars who paid attention to equivalence between two languages tended to seriously doubt the possibility of translation. A more recent approach, however, is to appreciate equivalence in terms of the translation’s social function. Different types of translation texts have come to be valued for what they serve. Still, issues of accuracy, usefulness, as well as naturalness remain unresolved (Baker 1992). Obviously, translation\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n22\n\nchapter 1\n\ntexts are not entirely problem-free, but it is also the case that the text created by a translator can avoid the bias of researcher-centeredness. I will revisit this controversy more thoroughly in Chapter 4. Variability presents another potential problem in using translation texts as data. Translation texts are produced by different individuals with varied backgrounds, and the same source text may produce different results. However, one can identify generalizable differences across source and target texts. For example, Osawa (2010), from the perspective of comparative literature, persuasively isolates differences between original Japanese novels and English translations. The gap he finds is caused by the following features of the English translation text; (1) use of additional explanation, (2) shorter sentences, dividing long sentences into shorter ones, (3) a changed tone of style, translation being more casual, and (4) avoidance of certain descriptions sensitive to the target audience.3 When these tendencies are observed consistently across multiple works, despite obvious individual and situational variation, it is possible to generalize cross-linguistic differences. The translator, being proficient in two languages, possesses a certain sense of naturalness associated with each language. When contrasting original and translation texts, a number of consistent corresponding features become apparent. It is fair to conclude that translation texts provide reasonable data for philosophical contrastive pragmatics.4 4.2 Selection Although in the past linguistic analyses of Japanese novels have been limited to a small number of classical works, I have selected literary works representing mass and popular culture as listed below. As exemplified by many of my own research designs (Maynard 2000, 2002, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017), I have made an effort to analyze discourse that reflects today’s Japanese language culture. Note that multiple translations are available for the Japanese story Ginga Tetsudoo no Yoru listed below; four different translations are selected for analysis. Works, totaling to 28, are listed separately according to genres, and are ordered by the original author’s last name followed by the translated work. 1. contemporary novels: – Kawakami, Hiromi: Sensei no Kaban – Powell, Allison Markin: The Briefcase\n\n3 These features are associated with translation universals discussed in Chapter 4. 4 I should mention here that the use of translation texts adds not only to philosophical contrastive pragmatics but to multiple disciplines. For example, translation data are analyzed to understand cross-linguistic variations in discourse (Teich 2003) and to reveal cases of language contact (Kranich 2014).\n\nSenko K.

Also the name of Kamupanerura’s pet dog is changed from Zaueru to Pooch.\n\n5 Light novels, primarily popularized since the late 1990s in Japan, are entertainment novels with anime-like illustrations that mainly target junior high school and high school boys, young adult males, and popular culture consumers. In the 2010s the genre and the market of light novels have undergone changes. Some of the light novels have enjoyed the readership of both men and women in their 40s, some even in their 50s. Light novels generally include the following features (Maynard 2012); (1) works are produced in the context of game-likerealism, (2) stories rely heavily on their characters, (3) a character database is created, (4) visual information plays an important role and is integrated into the text, (5) the stories frequently appear as a series, and (6) as popular culture entertainment, they often appear on multiple media platforms.\n\nSenko K.

Also included are two separate translations of an American short story as listed below. 5.

American short story and Japanese translations: – Auster, Paul: Auggie Wren’s Christmas Story – Murakami, Haruki: Oogii Ren no Kurisumasu Sutoorii – Shibata, Motoyuki: Oogii Ren no Kurisumasu Sutoorii Throughout this volume, isolated examples are presented to highlight specific phenomena. However, because contextual information available in an adjacent or nearby text is significant for interpretation, when necessary, the additional information is presented. Although only limited examples are given for making specific points, the phenomena under discussion are widely observed, and are not meant by any means to be rare occurrences. To provide broader contextual information, brief synopses of the works selected for data are presented in the Appendix. I should warn the reader that some of the discussion on data in subsequent chapters and the synopses contain spoilers. 4.3 On Data Presentation The Romanized transliteration of Japanese words is given in phonetic orthography referred to as the Hepburn style with the following alterations. In presenting double consonants, before cha, chi, chu, and cho, t is added, thus instead of icchi ‘agreement’, itchi is used. Syllabic n is written n unless immediately preceding a vowel, in which case it is written n’. The glottal stop, written as small tsu in Japanese, is spelled out as tt. Long vowels are transcribed with double vowels including names of dramatic persons, e.g., Goroo, although in English translation, following the translator’s method, a single vowel is used, e.g., Goro. As for Japanese proper nouns, the modified Hepburn style is used as stated above, except when established usage is available, e.g., Tokyo instead of Tookyoo. Regarding personal names, I use a single vowel in place of the original long vowel, as in Kenzaburo Oe without diacritic marks. Diacritic marks used for Japanese names are reproduced only when they appear within quoted segments. In references, Japanese names are reproduced as they appear in respective publications including diacritic marks. Within the text, the following rules apply. 1. All Japanese examples are presented in italicized Romanization with my (often literal) English translations in single quotation marks.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n25\n\n2.\n\nAll Japanese phrases or sentences appear in italicized Romanization with English translations in single quotation marks. 3. When Japanese phrases or sentences taken from literary works are discussed in contrast with authentic English translation, Japanese sources are specified in parentheses. In data examples, separated from the text, the following rules apply. 1. Varied methods are used as explained below. A specific method is chosen based on what I think most reasonable and useful for the analysis. 2. Romanized transliteration of the Japanese examples may be accompanied by their published English texts with their sources specified. When multiple translations are presented for a specific source text, those translations appear as (1b), (1c), and so on. In both Japanese and English examples, quoted sentences appear marked with quotation marks even when forming a part of long quotations. 3. The division of words in transliteration is only for glossing and clarification. Although some morphemes appear attached to words and some do not, those discretionary decisions are made only for convenience. Paragraph divisions in the original and translation texts do not necessarily match; paragraph indentions are reproduced as they appear in the works examined. 4. For a few sentences where morphological and grammatical information is critical, the Leipzig glossing method is followed as much as possible. Note the following grammatical labels; gen (genitive marker), ip (interactional particle), obj (object marker), and top (topic marker). 5. When authentic translations are unavailable, my own, often literal, translations are given in square brackets. 6. Some Japanese examples are presented with my (often literal) translations in square brackets, followed by (authentic) English translations with sources specified. In English literal translation, phrases that more directly reflect the information in the source text are parenthesized. These phrases are additions and are likely to cause unnatural English text, but presented only for clarification. 7. In many cases, only English translation texts are presented as data, but key Japanese phrases attributable to specific English translated expressions are presented in parentheses at appropriate locations. When general semantic or stylistic correspondences exist between Japanese and English texts, Japanese expressions are added in parentheses at the end of the relevant translation segments. 8. When attributable Japanese expressions are absent (as in the case of the zero-form), “zero” is used to indicate the absence.\n\nSenko K.

Part 1 includes introductory Chapters 1 and 2 as well as Chapters 3 and 4 which discuss the methodological framework. Part 2, consisting of Chapters 5 and 6, provides philosophical and linguistic context for the concept of self in Japanese studies. In Chapters 7 through 11 of Part 3, I concentrate on contrastive analysis of data whose process reveals those features of the Japanese language not fully reflected in English. Translation gaps provide supporting evidence for the thesis of this work, exploring the empty and populated self in Japanese in contrast with English. Chapter 12 focusing on Japanese as translation text, reveals that the observations made in Chapters 7 through 11 also occur consistently in Japanese translation. Chapter 13 in Part 4 concludes with some final thoughts. Chapter 1, Introduction, offers general remarks. Here I introduce a philosophical contrastive pragmatics and two critical concepts, context in pragmatics and linguistic relativity. The main theme of this work is also introduced, i.e., the Japanese empty self in the empty place, and the self that is populated with multiple aspects, characters, and characteristics. This chapter also explains the rationale for choosing literary works as data. Chapter 2 reviews the concept of self in Western thought and linguistics. After reviewing the Cartesian view, I discuss Western approaches that challenge the traditional Western understanding of the self and language. Included are modern and postmodern deconstructionist studies from multiple disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and narrative studies. These studies provide scholarly context for exploring the concept of self from Western perspectives. Chapter 3 focuses on the key concepts, subjectivity and character, as analytical resources. Subjectivity along with intersubjectivity offer guidance for analyzing self-expressions that indexically mark multiple aspects of the self. Character plays a role in understanding how the empty self is populated with characters and characteristics through character-speak. Also relevant for establishing the framework are two areas of research, translation studies and contrastive pragmatics involving translation text. Chapter 4 reviews perspectives from these areas of study. Translation studies provide justification and warnings when using translation texts as data, and offer an opportunity to review issues involving the Japanese language and translations of Western works.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nintroduction: exploring the self\n\n27\n\nAlso discussed are research in pragmatics involving translation, i.e., contrastive translation analysis approached from literary stylistics, as well as issues related to translation universals. In Chapter 5, I review the concept of empty self in empty place in Japanese studies. First, the influence of (zen) Buddhism to the concept of emptiness is reviewed. Then Nishida’s (1949) philosophy based on the “place of nothingness” is introduced. I also discuss Miyazawa’s (in Otsuka 1996) poetic interpretation of the self. Continuing within the Japanese context, in Chapter 6, I discuss how Japanese language studies have dealt with the concept of self since the Edo period. Then Tokieda’s (1941, 1950) position is introduced, where self is based on the situated place. In his view, language operates within a dynamic process in which the self and situation intimately and emotively interact. In addition, Watsuji’s (1990a [1962], 1990b [1962]) hermeneutic approach is discussed where an interdependent self is explored, followed by discussions on the multiplicity of self in Japanese discourse. Here I review contemporary Japanese sociological and psychological approaches to the concept of self which support the position that self is not an a priori theoretical construct, but emerges as being empty and populated. In analyzing Japanese and translation texts, Chapters 7 through 11 focus on the ways in which the Japanese empty self in an empty place is populated. I discuss grammatical phenomena such as first-person references, avoidance of the transitive sentence structure, the topic-comment dynamism, and varied types of quotation and monologue. Also analyzed are speech variations as character-speak including stylistic shifts, regional dialects, and borrowed fictional varieties. I analyze data primarily taking a qualitative approach through context-based interpretation, using tools developed in multiple research areas of language studies. Different approaches are highlighted and applied to specific phenomena focused in analysis chapters. Chapter 7 examines the empty self as presented through person-referencing terms such as the zero-form, self-referencing watashi ‘I’ and jibun ‘self’ as well as different reference forms assigned to dramatic persons. Most critically, the zero-form reveals that the Japanese self is presented as being empty, but only to be populated in the on-going discursive practice. Unlike English person-related expressions, the Japanese language, foregrounding different aspects of the self, allows for choosing fluctuating forms. Chapter 8 concentrates on Japanese grammar where the perceptive and receptive self is captured as an experiencer of situated events and states. As evidenced by the avoidance of transitive verbs that prioritize the cause-effect schema, the Japanese self materializes with perceptive and receptive aspects through the means of perception verbs, emotive passives, and verbs of giving.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n28\n\nchapter 1\n\nOne of the most fundamental information structures in Japanese is the topic-comment dynamism which the expressive self manipulates from behind the scene. Chapter 9 explores this dynamic relationship in Japanese grammar and discourse, specifically by focusing on the use and non-use of the topic marker wa. The topic-comment rhetoric in discourse offers a space where the hidden self controls the staging effect. This chapter also examines the no da nominal predicate. The Japanese self’s transient nature is realized through quotation and related phenomena. Chapter 10 discusses varied manners of inserted speech in the Japanese language, by capturing the quoting self as a voice-manipulating self. Then I illustrate how, by cross-examining among different kinds of quotations and monologues, the self is realized as being transferred between firstand third-person perspectives. This strategy of quotation reveals the extent of freedom the self enjoys in creating differentiating yet emerging aspects of the transferred self. Chapter 11 demonstrates how the character-speak realizes the populating process of self with stereotyped characters and characteristics. Analyses include middle-aged-male language, youth language, the effeminate onee language as well as a variety of regional and fictional dialects. All features analyzed in Chapters 7 through 11 are not fully and consistently reflected in English translation texts. I argue that semantic and expressive gaps are rooted in varied and sometimes radically different conceptualizations of the self that lurk beneath Japanese and translation texts. Chapter 12 offers the contrastive analysis of Japanese as the target text. Analyses reveal that the features discussed in earlier analyses chapters are repeatedly observed in translated Japanese texts. Translation texts created in an opposite direction provide further evidence that semantic and expressive linguistic practices in Japanese differ from those in English, confirming different ontological orientations and motivations. In the final chapter, Chapter 13, I summarize this work emphasizing the significance of the contrastive approach in the study of language and thought. In exploring the self, a new understanding is needed for establishing the theoretical notion of the self in language studies. Also in this chapter, with an awareness of and concern for using Japanese as a metalanguage for theory-building, I address the potential applicability of this study to language cultures outside of Japan, especially in the context of the Nihonjinron debate. I conclude this volume with an optimistic call for further advancement toward a more open and embracing appreciation of the concept of self. Understanding who the self is (or who selves are) through the hybridity of Western and non-Western approaches is hoped to transcend some of the limitations in linguistics, other language-associated fields, and beyond.\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nchapter 2\n\nFrom Traditional to Postmodern Concepts of Self in the West To explore the self from the perspective of philosophical contrastive pragmatics, it is necessary to understand its academic context. As symbolized by Heidegger’s (1971 [1959]) position that language is the house of Being, language is where one discovers one’s self as a language user. This chapter briefly reviews the concept of self developed in Western academia which will provide resources associated with and leading toward the Japanese empty and populated self. It should be noted that the selection of studies to follow is known to have influenced or has been influenced by Japanese scholarly traditions. Obviously, given the aim of this work, only a brief background review is possible. These studies reveal both differences and similarities in the conceptualization of the self and identity across Japan and the West. When thinking about the self, perhaps the most familiar and taken-forgranted understanding in the West (prominently in North America) is that of a person as a self-contained individual (Sampson 1989). Such a person is construed as a firmly bounded, highly individuated person, most aptly captured by Geertz (1984) as he criticizes such an approach. In his words: The Western conception of the person as a bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment and action, organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively against other such wholes and against a social and natural background is, however incorrigible it may seem to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world’s cultures. Rather than attempting to place the experience of others within the framework of such a conception, (…) understanding them demands setting that conception aside and seeing their experiences within the framework of their own ideas of what selfhood is. And for Java, Bali, and Morocco, at least, that idea differs markedly not only from our own but no less dramatically and no less instructively, from one to the other. geertz 1984: 126\n\nGeertz approaches the concept of self from his cross-cultural investigation in which he uncovered significantly less individualistic views. Given the con-\n\n© Senko K. Maynard, 2022 | doi:10.1163/9789004505865_003\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n30\n\nchapter 2\n\ntrastive mission of this work, his statement above serves as the foundation of as well as motivation for the discussion to follow. I begin by reviewing the Cartesian thesis followed by anti- and post-Cartesian arguments. Incorporating the historical background, I trace the source of the Western self in Descartes, and then contrasting it with Vico’s opposition to the Cartesian position only half a century later.\n\n1\n\nThe Cartesian View and Vico’s Opposition\n\nIt was the 17th century in France when René Descartes (1596–1650) presented his thesis of rational and unitary self reached by introspection. Descartes, searching for something that lies beyond all doubt, discovers that the thinking itself is impossible to doubt, and therefore, is absolutely certain. In his work, Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes (2001 [1901]) states that the initial step in philosophy requires skepticism, and therefore, one must start doubting the existence of everything. Insisting that one must doubt all knowledge and common sense, Descartes writes the following in the section titled Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That the Mind is More Known than the Body. But I had the persuasion that there was absolutely nothing in the world, that there was no sky and no earth, neither minds nor bodies, was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that I did not exist? Far from it. I assuredly existed, since I was persuaded. (…) Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him deceive me as he may, he can never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I shall be conscious that I am something. So that it must be maintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered, that this proposition (pronunciatum) I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in my mind. descartes 2001 [1901]\n\nNo matter how deep one’s skepticism, the fact that one is thinking cannot be denied. As long as a person engages in thinking, this thinking person must exist. The act of thinking, in the manner of rational introspection, is the only source of self, the proof of existence. God’s existence is trusted, because God is in thinking, and consequently, God cannot be a deceiver. In Cartesian thought, a human being is divided into mind and body, with prestige given to the former. The mind is capable of creating rational thought, and therefore, the ultimate authority is given to the subject of cogito, the initiator of human thought. Self-introspection is prized, and interaction with oth-\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nfrom traditional to postmodern concepts of self in the west\n\n31\n\ners becomes less important. The thesis of cogito, ergo sum raises the status of introspection to its highest level. Thus Cartesian thought has become the ultimate tool for understanding the world mapped by an authoritative order. Self is understood to be a rationally thinking person isolated from and independent of others, i.e., the rational and unitary self. The type of knowledge pursued within the Cartesian framework is rationality, i.e., an ideology of logos. There has been a widely held belief that one’s inner thinking leads to this logos of clear and distinct ideas. The prioritization of rational thinking has tended to push aside humanistic knowledge, the kind of knowledge I have discussed as “the knowledge of pathos” (Maynard 1998a, 2000, 2002). One’s humanistic knowledge including memory, psychological processes, feelings, imagination, emotion, myth, and so on, has too frequently been ignored or rejected, and deemed undeserving of scientific inquiry. In the humanities, emotion is essential, but emotion-related knowledge has been deemed unreliable. Humanistic knowledge, supported by an interpersonal relationship between “I” and “you” as characterized by Buber (1970), has been considered less trustworthy. Instead, rational thinking based on the “I-it” relationship, created solely in one’s mind, has been prioritized. Obviously, there is an irony in this thesis of cogito. The Cartesian thought was realized through a specific language endorsed by an inherent ideology. Thus thinking is not totally free nor absolutely clear. And more significant to this work, the thinking experience is not universal. This is because thinking must be achieved through a particular language. Each real-life language exists in its own ideological and sociocultural context. Philosophical studies on language, from whomever they originate, can never be totally free of ideology. Given this, it is not overly presumptuous to assume that for centuries the English language, or more accurately, English, German, and French, have imposed certain views of the world including the concept of self. Although historically the Cartesian view has dominated Western sciences, there has also been a view in the West that prioritizes humanistic knowledge. Giambattista Vico (1668–1744), an Italian philosopher of the early 18th century, personifies this view just when Cartesian philosophy was beginning to take root. Vico consistently criticized the Cartesian position and doubted the thesis that the essence of humanity is objectifiable and scientifically analyzable. Instead, Vico believed that for a human being to truly understand the self, one must appreciate the meaning of history, that is, one must understand the self in one’s historical context. For Vico, whose professed academic discipline was rhetoric, it is language, rather than clear and distinct ideas, that offers the deepest well of knowledge. Language is what allows us to understand the relationship between us and the\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n32\n\nchapter 2\n\nworld of which we are a part. More significant to the discussion of philosophical contrastive pragmatics is that Vico (1965 [1709]) approaches the relationship between linguistic form and meaning as one of interdependence. In his view, the principle of complementarity sustains, and as in the case of the interdependence between linguistic form and meaning, the relationship between language and mind is also synergistic. Predating the Whorfian hypotheses by two centuries, Vico warned that minds are fashioned by languages just as languages are fashioned by minds, and the two are inseparable. Following this line of thinking, it is absurd to conclude, as Descartes insisted, that clear and distinct ideas are standing behind language from which a speaker strains to pull out various ideas. Rather, the meaning of language arises with the language as it is performed. Vico insists that our relationship to language in history cannot be one of simply using it, but rather, one of participating in it. Indeed, Vico was “the first linguist to point out that language is performatory in nature” (Paparella 1993: 67). The analysis of language and philosophical contrastive pragmatics I pursue in this work are in basic agreement with Vico’s view toward language and its performatory nature. When pursuing philosophical understandings in and with language, we must understand that we participate in history through language which carries in itself its culture and history. Accordingly, we must appreciate that our language constructs the very manner in which we understand our selves. Likewise, the concept of self that a researcher seeks is inherently conditioned by his or her language, or languages, as well as sociocultural background. In language studies, unless we reach for ordinary language realized through participation among people, a mere abstract thinking may only add to the Cartesian introspection-based rationality, which may or may not reflect how people use language. In this work, as I have advocated in my earlier works (Maynard 2000, 2002), I explore a humanistic and philosophical approach to linguistics and pragmatics.\n\n2\n\nThe Self Approached from Psychology and Philosophy\n\nTo continue with the historical background of the Western self, in the rest of this chapter I trace the history from four perspectives. Initially in this section I review the self approached from psychology and philosophy focusing on Hume (1963) and James (1904, 1929, 1984 [1890]). In the second section, I discuss the postmodern deconstruction of the self attributed to Heidegger (1962) and Derrida (1978). Then in the third section, socially constructed and experienced self is discussed focusing on positions taken by Gergen (1996) as well as Holstein\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\nfrom traditional to postmodern concepts of self in the west\n\n33\n\nand Gubrium (2000). Finally, in the fourth section, I touch upon studies exploring language and identity (Bell 1999; Bucholotz 1999; Blommaert 2007; Bucholtz and Hall 2009; Zeman 2018). All of these views resonate with but differ from the Japanese empty and populated self. 2.1 Hume and Self as a Bundle of Perceptions David Hume (1711–1776) from the 18th century England, issues the fundamental challenge of questioning the very status of the thinking person. For Hume, the self is someone who transforms through experiences and feelings as a bundle of perceptions, an idea clearly in opposition to the Cartesian position. Hume insists that truth cannot be obtained through rational thinking, but only through experience. This is because human thought is ruled not by reason, but by a perception-based emotion. This prioritization of experience is applicable to the concept of self. Self is one who receives information experiencing the world through the body, formed as a bundle or a collection of perceptions. Hume (1963) in his work A Treatise of Human Nature, confesses that “I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception” (Hume 1963: 174, original emphasis), and defines the self in terms of perception or bundle of perceptions. In his words: I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity and are in a perpetual flux and movement. (…) The mind is a kind of theater, where several perceptions successively make their appearance, pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time nor identity in different, whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. hume 1963: 174, original emphasis\n\nHume’s view of the self with rapidly changing perceptions and in a state of perpetual flux and movement challenges the Cartesian thesis. He offers a definitive statement on the self as the following. When I turn my reflection on myself, I never can perceive this self without some one or more perceptions, nor can I ever perceive anything but the perceptions. It is the composition of these, therefore, which forms the self. hume 1963: 309, original emphasis\n\nSenko K. Maynard - 978-90-04-50586-5\n\n34\n\nchapter 2\n\nFor Hume, the mind itself, far from being an independent source of authority, is simply a bundle of perceptions without any logical connection or cohesive unification. Consequently, one can conclude that human existence remains receptive and passive; the Cartesian self cannot be automatically presumed. Regarding the scientific method as well, rejecting the analytical thinking dominant in modern sciences, Hume prioritizes human experience. Interestingly, Giles (1993) offers an insight connecting Hume to Buddhism. Giles argues that although some critics characterize Hume as a reductionist who, after all, theoretically allows for the existence of self, if one closely reads Hume’s works, it is possible to interpret his position as that of a “no-self” theory, an approach practiced in Buddhism. According to Giles, Hume does not view the self reduced simply to a bundle of perceptions, rather the self exists in the form of perception. That is to say, Hume strongly supports the position wherein the entity of a self is rejected altogether, demonstrating a polar opposite to the Cartesian position. Giles continues to explain that what Hume sees in the concept of self is the constructed self-image reached by condensing multiple experiences into an image of ideas. It is reasonable to accept the position that the self exists as one’s experiencebased self image, where no definable self is to be found. One’s self image changes from one moment to the next in perpetual transformation. Indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a consistent and unitary self in any such mixed bundle of experiences. 2.2 James and the World of Pure Experience Another figure in opposition to the Cartesian position is Henry James (1843– 1916), the 19th century American philosopher and psychologist who sought the concept of self in a world of pure experience. James (1904), based on his radical empiricism, calls his approach a “mosaic philosophy” and explains it as the following. In actual mosaics the pieces are held together by their bedding, for which bedding of the Substances, transcendential Egos, or Absolutes of other philosophies may be taken to stand. In radical empiricism there is no bedding; it is as if the pieces clung together by their edges, the transitions experienced between them forming their cement. james 1904: 568\n\nJames admits this metaphor may not be entirely accurate, but he insists that “the metaphor serves to symbolize the fact that experience itself, taken at large, can grow by its edges” (1904: 568).\n\nSenko K.
