        "text": "Making it in Japan―The Story of Starting a Business in Japan\n\nI came to Japan without a concrete plan, and now, a year later, I am running my own business. In reflecting on this journey for myself, I decided to share my experience. Consider the following a process document that breaks down what I've learned into specific milestones. For each step, I've also included anecdotes from other entrepreneurs, as well as useful resources.\n\nAlong the journey we'll cover: getting the idea, finding a lawyer, deciding which business to start, working with a Japanese partner, leasing an office, accounting, applying for a visa and opening a corporate bank account. There is definitely not one right way to start a business. All you need as you embark on the process is a little bit of audacity, a lot of humility, and the willingness to learn from your mistakes.\n\nSimilar to my experience, the entrepreneurs I interviewed didn’t move to Japan with the goal of starting a business. They moved to Japan because they loved the culture/country, and while designing their lifestyle, a business was born.\n\nMy friend Luis once said, “A city chooses you, you don’t choose a city.” When it comes to my move to Japan, that couldn’t be more true. There was an unmistakable feeling of home when I stepped off the train onto the amazingly quiet but chaotic station platform in Shinjuku. The feeling of belonging was compelling (and intriguing) enough for me to make the jump and leave my life in San Francisco behind.\n\nI didn’t choose. There wasn’t a choice. Here was just right.\n\nI’ve been in Japan for one entire year now. In that time I've learned conversational Japanese and started my own business creating immersive experiences for individuals and companies.\n\nI started my company while I was on a tourist visa. This meant I didn’t have a Japanese phone number, permanent address, or residency card. All of these details had implications on my process. I’ll discuss this more in the Finding a Japanese Partner section, but first, let’s examine how I decided to start a business.\n\nCAVEAT\n\nWhen I did the interviews for this article, I sought out foreigners who had gone through the incorporation process. This criterion, meant that I didn’t interview anyone doing freelance work, working for domestic companies, or doing interesting side projects. For any freelancers reading this, there are still applicable sections for you such as finding an accountant, a lawyer, or a coworking space. Discussion of visas and taxes will likely be the most different.\n\nSection 1―From Fearful to Functional\n\nI didn’t move to Japan with the ambition of starting a business―I came because I fell in love and wanted to follow my heart. I was full of optimism, but without much direction―and that for me was risky and very scary. Before starting my business, I had to get comfortable with uncertainty, get in touch with what I wanted and enjoyed, and then build a business from that vision. It turned out there was a lot of inspiration just on the other side of my comfort zone. That dark, scary, fear-and-panic-filled place was exactly where I needed to be.\n\nThere was a period after arriving in Japan when I was utterly and completely lost. I had followed my heart. Now what?!\n\nIt took about six months of working through emotions before I felt comfortable enough with myself and my business plan to meet with a lawyer and incorporate.\n\nSo how did I get from lost to incorporation?\n\nIt went something like this: panic / fear / confusion — liberation / inspiration — processing / sculpting — productive action.\n\nPanic / Fear / Confusion\n\nMy reasons for being in Japan weren’t clear.\n\nI didn’t have any goals other than being in Japan.\n\nAnd for the first time in my life, I was living without an expectation to attain something.\n\nWhile folks were telling me how “brave” I was, I couldn’t accept it, because all I felt on the inside was scared.\n\nThere were two things I struggled with:\n\nWhat was my professional identity?\n\nHow was I going to support myself?\n\nI left my professional career behind in San Francisco to start over, not at a new company, but in a whole new country and without a job. I unintentionally had given myself a sabbatical and I was not comfortable with that. I was nervous that if I ever tried to go back, the time I spent away would count against me.\n\nI was also living off my savings, and that felt both selfish and foolish. That money was meant to go toward things like buying a house, emergencies, paying for kids—legitimate concerns. Looking back, the kids excuse seems particularly irrational. I’m not married or with a serious partner, and I now wonder if I was just grasping at straws trying to find reasons not to take a risk.\n\nIn order to work through my fears, I journaled. I made lists of my fears and wrote out what I would do if the worst were to occur (I learned this from a Creative Mornings talk). I also made a budget and gave myself a realistic timeline for how long I could live without a job. I gave myself a little structure by signing up for language school. I knew I wanted to learn Japanese and that whatever I ended up doing, speaking the language would help. Language school provided goals and accountability, creating structure under which I could thrive.\n\nIn my heart I knew I decided to move because I needed a change, and I sensed opportunity here. I just had to trust myself to figure the rest out.\n\nOnce I accepted my insecurities, it was easy to live with them. They didn’t hold me back. They were still there, but they didn’t have an impact on my day-to-day progress. Since I wasn't spending so much time worrying, I had energy to take advantage of being in Japan, which is an incredible place to be!\n\nLiberation to Live / Learn / Be\n\nOnce I was okay just being here and saw it as part of the process, the world became my oyster.\n\nInspiration was everywhere and I was insatiable.\n\nI traveled. I followed my curiosity to places like Echigo Tsumari, Naoshima, Niseko, Yakushima.\n\nI made new friends. I met amazing people through language school and the creative community in Tokyo.\n\nI read—no, inhaled—so many books. The most useful book I read during this time was Springboard. It helped me re-examine my personal and professional definitions of success and to think about the lifestyle I wanted to create as I started this venture. It provided very holistic thinking about what role your work plays into your overall lifestyle. I made a workbook of my favorite activities you can download if you want!\n\nI did personal exercises and invited friends into my process. One of the highest-impact exercises for me was when I emailed 12 of my closest friends and asked them, “What is one thing I do well with relatively little effort?” I instructed them not to think too much and reply in one or two minutes. I received a range of responses back, but all affirmed strengths that I also saw in myself and knew I wanted to use in whatever company I started. I actually saved the responses in my “for a rainy day” folder; they were that meaningful and really made me feel seen as a person.\n\nI interviewed people in industries I was interested in. To gain perspective, I sought out people working in those fields and asked if I could interview them. I am so grateful to everyone who jumped on Skype or a phone call or met me in person for coffee.\n\nIn general, during this period of time I was having meaningful interactions with Japanese people and foreigners that were reinforcing my desire to live and work in Japan.\n\nProcessing / Sculpting\n\nAfter a lot of conversations, emotionally impactful experiences, and thought-provoking books, I was ready to distill my inspiration into something tangible.\n\nI had generated a list of businesses I could start. I picked one and worked on a business plan.\n\nI researched regulations and requirements for starting a business in Japan.\n\nAnd I looked at the competitive landscape—both what companies/services were available and what trends existed. I made a pitch deck for myself, which helped me distill my thoughts. I never intended to approach people for investment, but I appreciated the format for organizing myself.\n\nMy concept was to recreate an eye-opening trip to Japan I had experienced six months earlier, the trip that inspired me to move to Tokyo. The trip focused on connecting individuals through their interests and exploring areas of Japan that are not known as tourist destinations but have interesting communities living there.\n\nHaving the idea for the business was one thing, but I needed to make sure there was product/market fit—that there were actually people out there that wanted what I was offering.\n\nLuckily, I'd had a steady stream of visitors coming to Japan ever since I moved. The first batch arrived from Hawaii three weeks after I landed. The second came from Australia six weeks in, and the third from San Francisco at eight weeks. The visitors have continued to come since then. With each group, I was able to do research on their needs and test out different products I was thinking about offering. They provided feedback and insight into what they found valuable/meaningful and what they didn’t. It was an amazing feedback cycle and a safe space in which to test concepts. These experiences helped me answer the questions: Am I solving a real need? How am I uniquely qualified to solve this need?\n\nThese trials laid the groundwork for my business plan.\n\nProductive Action\n\nI don’t remember one specific day when I thought, “This is it! This is my million dollar idea! I must do this!” But I do remember feeling confident enough about my research and concept, and I knew I would learn a lot more by doing than I would by planning, so I moved forward.\n\nFrom the offerings I had tested (itinerary planning, guiding, advice) I built a business plan. I took it to people I trusted (classmates from college, family, friends) and asked for their feedback. I built their feedback into the plan. And then over the New Year holiday, as I sat with my brother and sister around the kitchen table, I bought a URL and signed up for Squarespace to build my site. That made it real. It also meant it was time to approach lawyers and talk about incorporation.\n\nI see the six months between arriving in Japan and actually establishing a company as an investment in myself. One that will hopefully enable me to have a meaningful day-to-day impact on others and grow as an individual. I won’t know the returns of this investment for quite some time. But even now, it feels worth it—if only because I gave myself permission to do it.\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Mariel Lozano Villarreal\n\nCountry of Origin: Mexico\n\nCompany: Chalupa imports high-quality, craft goods from Mexico to Japan.\n\nYears in Japan: 3+\n\nMariel originally came to Japan from Mexico for an internship at an architecture firm. She knew she wasn’t ready to leave when the internship ended, so she enrolled in a two-year language program. About three-quarters of the way through the program she decided to start an import business, Chalupa, which brings Mexican craft goods to Japan. Mariel had attended many fashion and design events and felt like the Mexican aesthetic was misrepresented. In her words, “it was all tequila and mariachi” and was completely missing Mexico’s design and craft renaissance.\n\nMariel secured two partners in Mexico and together they founded the company. They incorporated in Mexico and set up a subsidiary in Japan.\n\nThey wanted to have both an online and in-store presence. Building the online store was their biggest initial outlay at 1,300,000 JPY (13,000 USD). Chalupa just ran a successful crowdfunding campaign to help offset those costs and raised over 870,000 JPY (8,700 USD). They have also established partnerships with Archivando and T-site Art Corner to sell their products!\n\nMariel is happy with what they’ve built so far and will continue to explore ways she can contribute to the design scene in Japan. When she isn’t running Chalupa she also does interior design work for stores and brands in Tokyo you can see her portfolio here.\n\nSection 2―Finding a Lawyer\n\nIn Japan, there seems to be a communally accepted way of doing things—one right way—and it touches everything from taking a bath to throwing out your trash to legal processes. If you want to deviate from the norm in any way in your process (company structure, office structure,etc) you may have to speak with more than a handful of lawyers/consultants before you find someone willing to work in that way. If you ask enough questions and are patient, workarounds will arise. Go through your network to find good recommendations of individuals to work with.\n\nAt the time I started the incorporation process, I didn’t know many people to go to for referrals. Instead, I went on GaijinPot, a media site for foreigners with everything from travel advice to language schools to job postings, and asked for incorporation and immigration lawyer recommendations.\n\nI got a response quickly. I messaged that law group along with two others I had found on Google and asked for quotes.\n\nAll three came back to me with the same basic timeline and cost:\n\nTimeline: 4 months, 1 month for incorporation and 3 months for a visa\n\nCost: 5,000 USD, 1,500 USD for incorporation and 3,500 USD for a visa\n\nAfter meeting the lawyers in person, I decided to go with the recommendation I received on GaijinPot. Their offices are by Mitsukoshimae. In our first meeting we talked through what we had discussed over email (my needs, timeline, costs). I then signed a letter of intent and gave them a 1,000 USD deposit. They provided all the documents with explanations in English, which helped when I referenced it later.\n\nFrom my understanding, lawyers working with non-Japanese-speaking clients charge a premium. This is because they need to do double the paperwork—they create English documents for you and Japanese documents for official submission. If you have a partner who speaks Japanese fluently, you may be able to save money by only working with someone in Japanese and not both Japanese and English.\n\nMy lawyers took care of:\n\nTranslating all my documents (business plan, applications, etc) into Japanese and preparing everything for submission\n\nOrdering my inkans\n\nRepresenting me at the immigration office\n\nDelivering a visa (one-year business manager visa)\n\nLawyers recommended by myself and fellow entrepreneurs:\n\nShinanome\n\nJune Advisors Group\n\nTricor (Lawyer's name is Furuya San)\n\nCosmopolitan - Legal Service (Mark’s current lawyer)\n\nNakai Immigration (Mark’s previous lawyer)\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Mark McFarlane\n\nCountry of Origin: England\n\nCompany: Tacchi Studios, a digital product consultancy that does both mobile and web design and development.\n\nYears in Japan: 8+\n\nMark fell in love with Japan when he visited a friend in Tokyo back in 2007. He stayed for a month and toured around. At the end of that month he knew he had only scratched the surface and decided to come back.\n\nHe found a job teaching English. While Mark had experience teaching IT and computer science in England, he knew it wasn’t what he wanted to do forever. His university degree was in computer science and, while he didn’t necessarily plan to go down that route, he fell in love with the iPhone when it was launched in the same month he arrived in Japan. When he wasn’t teaching, he spent his time doing iOS and Android application development, first as a hobby and then for clients as a freelancer. His client projects grew so much that they became full-time work. Mark left teaching and Tacchi was born! Tacchi Studios is a digital product consultancy that does both mobile and web design and development. The first lawyer he worked with came through a recommendation from another developer friend. The lawyer cost 100,000 JPY and successfully got Mark an engineering visa.\n\nWhen Mark approached his lawyer asking for his help in sponsoring a foreign employee's visa, he was advised to change his company structure in order to do so. But changing his company structure wasn’t something Mark was interested in doing. He ended up having to speak with four or five lawyers before he found someone that was able to, both keep his current company structure and sponsor a foreign visa. Together they have sponsored not only Mark’s visa, but also his brother’s (twice). This lawyer costs between 100,000 JPY and 200,000JPY for the first engagement and between 50,000JPY and 70,000JPY for visa renewals.\n\nWhen it comes to finding the right lawyer, Mark advises folks to be clear about what they want and to speak with more people than you normally would. You may hear no eight times, but that ninth yes will make all the difference.\n\nOther interviews with Mark:\n\nThe story of founding Canvas, a network for creatives in Tokyo.\n\nMark's thoughts on product validation and learning from customers.\n\nSection 3―Deciding Which Type of Business to Start\n\nYour incorporation choice will depend on the types of clients you’ll serve, how you’ll fund the business and the company structure. Some basic rules of thumb:\n\nIf you plan to raise financing, start a kabushiki kaisha (KK).\n\nIf you want to have a partner that helps you run a business, start a KK.\n\nIf you will be working with established Japanese companies, start a KK.\n\nIf you want to keep it super simple and set up quickly, start a godo kaisha (GK).\n\nIf you already have an entity in another country and are looking to work with Japanese clients, start a subsidiary.\n\nI was confused when I first arrived trying to figure out what the equivalent of American business types were in Japan. At the risk of oversimplifying, here’s a basic mapping:\n\nA good breakdown of the differences between GK and KK is in this article from TA Lawyers GKJ.\n\nBecause I wasn’t planning on taking outside financing, building a board, or having a branch in America, I ended up establishing a godo kaisha.\n\nBelow is a document my lawyers made to explain the different types of companies more in depth:\n\nTo start the GK I just had to submit a form with the following information:\n\nCompany name\n\nBasic business purposes\n\nPartners in the company\n\nInitial capital investment\n\nFiscal year\n\nIncorporation date\n\nI also had to get a signature certificate since I wasn’t registered in Japan and didn’t have an inkan (a registered stamp that acts as your official signature on important documents), so I went to the US Embassy and signed a paper for them to notarize. Weirdly, I was nervous. I had heard about the Japanese being SUPER strict with signatures and making sure they are exactly the same every time. My personal signature has changed dramatically over the years and is a little different each day. So when I went to sign I actually messed up, and they had to start over again, which made me feel really suspicious, but I pulled myself together and got it right the second time around. Phew! You can download the “blank signature certificate” from the US Embassy Website.\n\nAdditional reading on the different company structures:\n\nBreakdown of different company types and quick recommendations based on questions.\n\nRepresentative vs. branch vs. subsidiary.\n\nMore information on sole proprietors in Japan.\n\nExplanation of the capital requirements for different companies.\n\nAnother look at godo kaisha vs kabushiki kaisha.\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Josh Smith\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nCompanies: Miss Grand Japan and Intergo - Miss Grand Japan focused on beauty pageants and Intergo on translation services.\n\nYears in Japan: 5\n\nJosh studied Japanese in college and had always had his sights set on moving to Japan. After graduation, he moved and spent a little over five years working in Japan as a translator, English teacher, and entrepreneur. He is currently back in America, but the companies he started in Japan are thriving.\n\nJosh decided to start a KK largely because he was going to be working with other Japanese companies and they prefer to interface with KKs. He had learned that historically there were more requirements to start a KK, meaning the founders needed to be more serious, legitimate, and committed. He also knew that GKs had been easy to set up, sometimes resulting in less reliable entrepreneurs. Times have changed and the regulations required are different, but the reputations remain. Keep this in mind if you will be working with government entities or Japanese companies that have been around for a long time.\n\nIncorporation cost about 2,000 USD plus a small initial investment. Josh worked with an advisor supplied by his investor to handle the paperwork. The hardest part for Josh and his business partner was picking the name for the company, everything else was relatively straightforward.\n\nSection 4―Finding a Japanese Business Partner\n\nI originally planned to set up the business on my own, but I needed more help than I realized. I asked a friend to be my “partner” during the setup phase. She had to invest one yen and come along with me to meetings. After I got my visa, we removed her. I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for her. Even if you don’t need someone on paper, I would highly recommend you find a Japanese friend/mentor you can consult with as you establish yourself.\n\nMy Japanese business partner was instrumental in helping me adapt to the Japanese way of working. She explained situations to me, what was said and unsaid. She told me how I could be more successful in my communication style (giving pause, slowing down) and she contributed to my credibility in business situations.\n\nDeciding who to work with was not a decision I took lightly. I was asking a REALLY big favor of friends that I had only known for five months, tops.\n\nI ended up asking my friend Kyoko, whom I had been introduced to by my brother’s girlfriend. They had worked together on the Marshall Islands after college.\n\nKyoko had work experience in both Japan and Canada, which meant that she intuitively understood the business/bank practices here and could give me context on the cultural gaps that I was missing because I’d only had “western” business experience. She also had amazing attention to detail and was able to explain things simply to me so I understood.\n\nBefore I met with Kyoko, I put together my business plan, financial projections, and a summary from the lawyer of her expected involvement. I also included a timeline with milestones and an estimation of when we could remove her from the company. Once removed, her liability would also end. Over dinner I shared this information and asked that she think it over and get back to me when she was ready. I communicated that our friendship was much more important to me than the company. I was happy to approach other people if she chose not to work with me.\n\nI am lucky she agreed. I wouldn’t be writing this article today without the help of my business partner. It turned out to be a much larger favor to ask than I had realized. When Kyoko and I were approaching banks she had to take half days from work. She also had to call the banks ahead of time to make sure we had the proper paperwork and schedule appointments if possible. After our meetings she would read through the Japanese paperwork to make sure it matched the English version. She wrote countless kanjis for me when we were filling out paperwork and translated during meetings/interviews. It was a part-time job for her that lasted for about six months while we set up the company, applied for my visa, got the corporate bank account, and removed her from the company structure.\n\nI am so, so grateful for her support, professionalism, and confidence in the business. I told her she could make a business out of helping foreigners start businesses, but I think she’s had her fill of the process… We’ll see. She enjoyed learning about the process—she’s always thought about starting her own company. Now that she knows exactly how to do so, she is more confident to try it one day. That is a secondary unforeseen benefit, and I am glad she got something out of it.\n\nThankfully the process wasn’t a strain on our friendship—we only had a few pockets of condensed time commitments, and then after that I was able to keep the business running on my own and just keep her updated.\n\nFor those coming to Japan without knowing anyone but with ambition, the first thing to do is make friends, both locals and foreigners. Seek out people with similar experiences so you can share learnings with one another. Invite people out for coffee or lunch—and remember to always pick up the bill. Immerse yourself. Personal connections will serve you best, especially in Japan, where introductions carry extra weight.\n\nSome places to start where you can meet people and make friends:\n\nCANVAS - online community for creatives in Tokyo.\n\nPecha Kucha - monthly lecture series.\n\nPause Draw - monthly sketching meetup.\n\nTokyo Expat Network - online forum for foreigners.\n\nHit the Road - running club.\n\nRide the Lightning - design talks.\n\nUX Talks - design talks.\n\nVolunteer with Achilles - running group that \"pairs able-bodied runners with athletes with disabilities.\"\n\nVolunteer with Tell - a group that provide mental health services.\n\nJapan International Business Network (Linkedin and Meetup) - group for people involved in business locally or internationally.\n\nZen 2.0 - mindfulness conference.\n\nInstagram - Such an easy way to find people that have similar taste and interest to you.\n\nFEW - networking group for women.\n\nBusiNest - Incubator program for startups and small businesses.\n\nHub Tokyo - co-working space.\n\nSPAN - design and technology conference.\n\nSlush - startup conference.\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Josh Smith\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nCompanies: Miss Grand Japan and Intergo - Miss Grand Japan focused on beauty pageants and Intergo on translation services.\n\nYears in Japan: 5\n\nContinuing Josh’s story, Josh and his Japanese business partner, Eriko, met in America when Eriko came to the States to study for a semester in university. They stayed friends and reconnected when Josh moved to Japan. They had often spoken about starting a business together and decided to make it official after receiving enough interest in their product(s) to justify a business.\n\nEriko was connected with an investor/incubator that offered services for companies getting started. The investor is an individual that works one-on-one with people, providing them with legal advice, office space, and capital required to get their business off the ground. Josh and Eriko’s investor made the process of starting a company super streamlined. The investor is busy and doesn’t spend time in the day-to-day operations of their companies, but they maintain a positive working relationship and make time to go to dinners together at least once or twice a year.\n\nFor foreigners looking for investment in Japan, Josh would recommend getting your business card out there, finding events through Facebook or LinkedIn or alumni associations. Even just spending some time in a whiskey bar and sharing your business card with individuals you meet could lead to something.\n\nJosh also recommends speaking the language. When you have Japanese business partners nothing puts them more at ease than knowing that there is clear communication and mutual understanding.\n\nSection 5―Leasing an Office Space\n\nTo find the right office place for you, begin with how you want to use it. Do you need meeting rooms for client presentations? Want to be surrounded by other entrepreneurs? Need storage for your products? Or just need a quiet place to work? Within the city, there are lots of different options at different price points; one is bound to match your criteria. I got an office space out of necessity for my visa but didn’t use it and saw it as a waste of money. There are other alternatives, so work with your immigration lawyer/realtor/friends to find the right one for you.\n\nMy business is based around travel, and while I didn’t see a direct need for an office, my visa required that I have one with four walls and a lock on the door. It also had to be a separate address from my home address.\n\nHad I not had that requirement, I would absolutely be working out of one of the coworking spaces in Tokyo. They are casual environments filled with creative, ambitious people—amazing communities to be part of.\n\nSince I didn’t have a residency card, bank account, or permanent address, which is required to get my own lease for an office, I went through a serviced office provider, Regus.\n\nI framed my search for an office space by price point and location. I didn’t plan to spend much time at the office. But since all my mail was being sent there, I did want it to be easily accessible from where I lived.\n\nLearnings About Office Address\n\nWhile I had heard in passing that people judged businesses by the address on their business card, I didn’t really understand what that meant. I had heard that Omotesando, Aoyama, Azabujuban, and others were great neighborhoods for business addresses, but I didn’t understand why. I didn’t think it would be very important for my clients who were from out of the country and unfamiliar with the different neighborhoods.\n\nWhat I had failed to understand was that I wasn’t trying to impress my clients, but business services like banks or partners like local tourism bureaus. Banks are weary of giving a corporate account to someone that doesn’t have a credit history in Japan, and I think it made it even easier for them to turn me down when they saw my address.\n\nAnother note: You have to get a corporate account in the same neighborhood in which your business is registered. So, if you end up getting a less expensive space farther outside the city, you’ll have to open your account at the branch there.\n\nLearnings About Price Point\n\nMy rent ended up being higher than I wanted it to be per month. I only looked at properties in my range, but when we sat down to go over the contract I learned that I would also be charged a monthly fee for kitchen services (they provided free water/coffee, and it was non-negotiable—they made it available for everyone, so everyone had to pay.) And, if I wanted Wi-Fi or phone service I would also have to pay for that. Every print/scan/fax is also billed (that’s common practice at coworking spaces too).\n\nI felt misled, but I also didn’t know the system yet. So if you are working with someone, make sure to communicate your MAX budget, including rent and all additional fees, and see what options they can come up with for you.\n\nI used my credit card to pay the deposit and the first month’s rent. Then Regus had to verify my identity, so they sent a letter to the Airbnb where I was staying and I had to be home and sign for it. Once that was complete, the office was mine to use.\n\nAs I move into my second year of business, I am looking for an alternative for my office, one that doesn’t feel like a waste of money. Some options I’m considering are:\n\nWorking with a realtor to find a small office space\n\nGetting a two-bedroom apartment and using the second bedroom as an office\n\nHere is a great article about how to work with lawyers and rental agencies to structure your lease so that your space is legitimate for businesses use. http://visajapan.tokyo/2016/06/07/issues-businesses-in-japan/\n\nTransferring my office address to my home address and working out of a coworking space\n\nSince this will be my second year of business, I have more information to share with the immigration officers. I can show my company financials, the fact that I’ve been paying taxes, that I’ve enrolled in health insurance, etc. There is a chance I may not have to have a separate office with four walls and a lock and still get my visa (fingers crossed).\n\nMore information about places to work:\n\nTokyo Cheapo Guide to Serviced Office Spaces (from 2015).\n\nMidori.so - coworking space.\n\nMOV - coworking space.\n\nThe Works - coworking space.\n\nThe Hub - coworking space.\n\nIf you do end up having to get an office, but you don’t plan on using it, there is actually a service where you can use your space to store traveler’s luggage, Temp Grab!\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Mariel Lozano Villarreal\n\nCountry of Origin: Mexico\n\nCompany: Chalupa imports high-quality, craft goods from Mexico to Japan.\n\nYears in Japan: 3+\n\nContinuing Mariel’s story. Mariel is currently working out of an office space that she found through her network. Her friend knew a guy with a big office in Shibuya but only one employee and many spare desks. Their main office was in Osaka and they were only using the Tokyo office as a showroom for fabrics. It was the perfect fit for her because it had space where she could keep the store’s inventory. She was able to persuade the owner to rent her a desk at a really reasonable price, 30,000 JPY a month.\n\nShe had also considered working out of a coworking space, but since she needs storage space for the import goods, that wasn’t an option.\n\nThe best part about working out of this office is that she can witness meetings and business interactions of the other company from her desk and learn about actual Japanese business manners.\n\nThe worst part is that sometimes people smoke inside and it isn’t a creatively stimulating environment.\n\nSection 6―Working with an Accountant\n\nI’ve built a team supporting my business: lawyer, accountant, mentors, designer, etc. These are all people that make my life so much better, especially my accountant. Together we work on expenses, paying withholding taxes, and end-of-year personal and professional tax filings, as well as the paperwork needed to reapply for my visa. I needed an accountant within the first two months of opening the business to make sure I filed the tax paperwork in time. It’s good to get one sooner rather than later.\n\nWith all the appropriate paperwork filled out, the actual incorporation process was super quick—maybe one week. My lawyers also ordered company inkans for me and the day I received those in the mail was a big celebration—there was a joyous shimmy when those inkans arrived!\n\nI went around stamping everything I could.\n\nWith the company officially incorporated, the next thing I needed to do was register for taxes. The initial paperwork must be submitted within two months of opening your business, so it’s something you want to take care of as soon as you can.\n\nMy lawyers recommended their friend, an accountant based in Saitama, to complete this step of the process. In the interest of time, I went ahead and asked them to connect their friend and take care of the initial filing.\n\nIt cost 31,400 JPY.\n\nMy accountant just needed my phone number, address, and business information.\n\nBeyond the initial filing, there are other reasons you would want to work with an accountant.\n\nHealth insurance and SS contributions change every six months in April and October, so it’s helpful to have an accountant that can keep track of all that for you.\n\nIt’s also useful to have someone that can review your expenses and be sure they are making deductions appropriately.\n\nRemember to save all your receipts, categorize, create a system for yourself, and make sure you are asking for ryoshusho, a receipt that has an official stamp from the company with which you are spending money. I have a receipt folder I carry with me on all my trips. I’ve realized that sometimes I still need to write on the back of each receipt what it was for so I can remember a month later, when I finally sit down to go through my expenses, categorize, etc\n\nIf you are applying to renew your visa, your accountant will also help you prepare the tax paperwork needed for the visa application.\n\nThe tax payment schedule for business on the yearly calendar is:\n\nJuly - Withholding tax due\n\nDecember - Withholding tax due\n\nFebruary - Corporate taxes due\n\nMarch - Personal taxes due\n\nMy Japanese accountant charges by how much money the company makes.\n\nAnother accountant I spoke with has a package for entrepreneurs, where for ¥40,000JPY a month you have unlimited access to the accountant team. This also includes the price for preparing your statements at the end of the year. It’s pricey, but his hope is that he can teach you about accounting during the process and prepare you to be more independent in your second or third year of business.\n\nAccountants recommended by myself and other entrepreneurs:\n\nSugai San - r.sugai@sugai-accounting.com\n\nImai San - y-i@imai-kaikei.jp\n\nHitomi San - hitomi@is-tax.co.jp\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Chris Palmieri\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nCompany: AQ is a design studio specializing in digital products, services and communication for business and culture.\n\nYears in Japan: 15+\n\nChris’ tenure in Japan spans over 15 years, twelve of which he’s been running AQ, a design studio, alongside his wife, Eiko, and business partner Tomomi.\n\nOver the years, Chris and Eiko have built a solid team to support their business—individuals who have helped them navigate growth and expansion overseas. By team I mean lawyers, accountants, mentors, etc. Many of these people they met by means of introduction and can provide really useful insights into how to approach and maintain relationships made by introductions.\n\nIn Japan in general, individuals take a lot of responsibility, whether it be for getting a lost foreigner to the right train stop or sweeping up the stairs in front of their shops. They especially take responsibility for the outcome of an introduction.\n\nChris has some advice if you are going to ask for an introduction: “Before asking for an introduction, weigh the responsibility they may feel against the likelihood that the introduction will lead to something. Be clear about why you are asking for the introduction, and make it clear that it's okay if they don't feel comfortable making it. Once you've met the person you've been introduced to, report back on how it went and show gratitude. If the introduction leads to a lasting relationship, continue to show appreciation to the person who made the introduction from time to time.”\n\nOne of the benefits Chris experienced by growing the company through introductions from close friends/family is that it made the company feel really intimate. Events like company holiday parties feel way more like family reunions than work engagements. And for Chris, Eiko, Tomomi and Paul, that is a feeling they find rewarding and hope to continue to cultivate as the company grows.\n\nSection 7―Applying for a Visa\n\nThe process for applying for a visa isn’t hard, just time intensive. You have to gather up all the documents that prove your credentials and that you have met all the requirements for your specific visa (office space, bank account, etc). Providing extra documents like articles you’ve published, awards you’ve received, or letters of recommendation from previous bosses doesn’t hurt and will help to make the case that you are a professional they want in the country!\n\nAs a founder, I was eligible for the Business Manager visa, a visa specifically for CEOs, business owners, or business managers. It is not a visa for investors in companies as its previous name (Investor visa) had implied.\n\nThe requirements for the visa are:\n\nAn office space with four walls and a lock on the door that displays company signage\n\nA business plan\n\n5M JPY investment\n\nAn employee (could be yourself)\n\nSome of my other friends in Japan working as freelancers or for their own companies are on totally different visas. For example:\n\nThere will probably be more than one visa that suits your situation. Talk with your lawyer and see which they think would be the best fit for you and your longevity in Japan.\n\nYou will be warned it could take up to three months for them to process your visa. But in my case we heard back in four weeks. I submitted on Mar 21st and by April 21st I had the Certificate of Eligibility (COE).\n\nSince I was going to be doing a lot of travel both in and outside of Japan, my lawyers advised that I wait to activate my visa until I re-entered Japan in June. You have a 90-day window after receiving the Certificate of Eligibility to activate it.\n\nI technically could have gone to immigration in Tokyo and worked with them to switch from a Tourist visa to the Business Manager visa, but the lawyers said it would be more complicated and generally take longer. When you do this at the airport, it is immediate; they actually process your paperwork right there and you walk away with your residency card!\n\nHere is a list of everything I had to compile for the lawyers for the visa application:\n\nI. Documents\n\n1. Facial photograph (a digital camera file is fine). If you are going to provide them with an actual photograph, it will need to be 4cm x 3cm in size.\n\n2. Passport photocopy (page with your picture and all pages with stamps/seals of previous visits to Japan)\n\n3. Salary amount\n\n4. Simple resume\n\n5. Photographs of your office (entire building from the outside, the entrance to your office and inside your office). Be sure to take 2 or 3 pictures from different angles.\n\n6. Copy of Office Lease Agreement\n\nII. Personal Information\n\n1. Marital status\n\n2. Place of residence in the US\n\n3. Phone number in Japan (cell phone, your office phone etc)\n\n4. Expected date of entry to Japan\n\n5. Expected port of entry to Japan (ex. Narita)\n\n6. Will anyone accompany you when you come to Japan?\n\n7. Expected place of visa application (where you plan to convert your COE to a visa)\n\n8. Previous criminal record? Yes/No\n\n9. Previous history of deportation from Japan? Yes/No\n\n10. Any family or relatives in Japan?\n\n11. Most recently completed education, name of school, graduation date, major field of study\n\n12. Number of years of previous experience managing a business (if none, none is fine)\n\nIII. Company Information\n\n13. Company phone number\n\n14. Total number of employees and number of Japanese employees\n\n15. Approximate floor area\n\nI’m on a one-year visa and will start the reapplication process in March (three months before my visa expires). I’ll need to show tax documents, pension and health care registration/payments, business financials, office contract, etc. I’m not necessarily looking forward to that, but it’s okay. With a good team of lawyers and a business that is steadily growing, I think it will be okay!\n\nAdditional articles to read about visas in Japan:\n\nJapan Times, \"So you want to start a business in Japan?\"\n\nGaijin Pot, \"2015 Japan Investor Visa - Changes on the Horizon\"\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Japan, \"Guide to Living in Japan\"\n\nJune Advisors Group, \"Visa and Immigration Procedure in Japan\"\n\nJapan Visa, \"Japan Cultural Activities Visa\"\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: Mark McFarlane\n\nCountry of Origin: England\n\nCompany: Tacchi Studios, a digital product consultancy that does both mobile and web design and development.\n\nYears in Japan: 8+\n\nContinuing Mark’s story. Mark is currently on his fifth visa. He has had 2 one-year visas and is on his third three-year visa. It’s been a relatively straightforward process. He is running a sole proprietorship and he can do that on an engineering visa. He doesn’t have to show investment figures or anything like that. And, by running a successful business, he can show the company financials and prove that he is making enough to support himself, and the other visas the company sponsors.\n\nTo get his initial engineering visa, he just had to show his degree in computer science, his resume, and some client contracts.\n\nMark’s commitment to Japan is long term and in two years he will be eligible to apply for permanent residency. That makes ten plus years in Japan. Permanent residency is really attractive to long-term residents in Japan. You don’t need to have a corporate sponsor (you are your own sponsor), it’s easier to get credit cards and home loans, there is no time limit, and you can work in whatever industry you want.\n\nIn order to qualify for permanent residency you must show:\n\nYou haven’t been in trouble with the Japanese government.\n\nYou can sustain yourself independently and don’t rely on anyone else.\n\nYou have been in Japan for 10 consecutive years and held work permits for 5 consecutive years.\n\nYour current visa is about to expire (you’ve stayed the max amount of time you can on your current visa).\n\nYou have made a contribution to Japan in one of the following fields: research, economics, sports, arts, diplomacy, or education.\n\nThe application process is rigorous and can take up to six months to find out. I’ve heard of people who have been in Japan for over twelve years and were unable to get the permanent residency visa, but just because they’ve been rejected once doesn’t mean they cannot apply again. I heard of a couple cases of people who were turned down their first or second time but then accepted on subsequent applications!\n\nMore about permanent residency:\n\nGuidelines for permission of permanent residents.\n\nGuidelines for contributions to Japan for permanent resident applications.\n\nPoints-based system for preferential treatment in permanent residency applications.\n\nSection 8―Opening a Corporate Bank Account\n\nApproach banks like you would a company you want to work for. Be prepared with the right paperwork, practice answers they may ask you ahead of time, and dress professionally. Banks are looking to understand what your business does and how you are going to make money and to ensure you are trustworthy. Show them your earning potential by bringing financial statements or invoices that you have sent out to clients. Start with smaller banks first, like Bank of Yokohama or Seibu. Once you have established a credit history in Japan and are a less risky client, then apply at larger banks like Mizuho, UFJ Mitsubishi, Resona, etc.\n\nMy lawyers had warned me that getting a corporate bank account as a foreigner could be challenging and advised I have a Japanese partner especially for this step.\n\nEven with a Japanese partner, I was surprised at how challenging it was to get a bank account. It was mostly an investment of time in visiting the banks coupled with the anxiety during the interviews and then the ultimate rejection that made it so hard and left me feeling a bit hollow and defeated. Why didn’t these people want to take my money?\n\nWe started approaching banks in April and didn’t get an account until July.\n\nBefore we would visit the bank, Kyoko would call and double check what paperwork we needed. Normally it was:\n\n印鑑証明書 - Company Seal Registration\n\n履歴事項全部証明書 - Historical Matters Document\n\n国税電子申告 - Tax Registration (filed electronically)\n\n在留カード - Residency card\n\n印鑑 - Inkan\n\nIn the case of Shinsei they also ask you to print:\n\n法人番号 - Employer Identification Number\n\nKyoko and I went to the major banks in Shibuya first (Mizuho, Resona, Shinsei). For Resona our accountant even came with us to try to increase our legitimacy, but to no avail.\n\nWe were rejected by all.\n\nWhen we were at Resona, the bank teller was kind enough to explain before we left that we probably wouldn’t get an account with them. The reason was that the personal identification information we were using (Kyoko’s) didn’t match up with the information on certificates A and B, which had my information with my US address. They were looking for consistency across all those documents. That was frustrating to learn after so many previous rejections, and I was curious why my lawyers hadn’t recommended we put Kyoko’s info on those papers in the first place—especially since they had recommended I work with her.\n\nWe ended up just waiting to approach banks until I got my residency card and business registration papers were updated with my Japan address and phone number.\n\nThe fourth bank we tried is called Seibu. It isn’t considered a first-tier bank and tends to work with small businesses. For the first meeting, a bank teller actually comes to see your office space, and then they decide after that if they want to let you have an account or not. For people just getting started I would advise staying away from the major banks and go with banks like Seibu, or regional banks like Yokohama, to increase your chances of success at opening an account.\n\nFor this appointment, we were much more prepared. I had printed out pages from the website and reviews from previous customers, brought invoices, and Kyoko and I both had our business cards. We even wore suits!\n\nAfter the tour of the office, we went into a meeting room and the bank teller asked the normal questions: Why do you need an account? How does your business work? He was way less intimidating than the other tellers we had spoken with, and when he started explaining the services Seibu offered, I knew that we had done well.\n\nAt the end of our meeting, he congratulated us and said he would gladly open an account for the business (YAYAYA! - I celebrated on the inside and remained professional on the outside).\n\nAbout a week later we went to the bank and signed papers and made a deposit. Two weeks after that I received the cash card in the mail. Unfortunately I don’t think this bank will work out long-term for the business. They charge really high service fees for transfers, and since most of my clients are foreign and would be transferring, it’s not cost effective. My accountant has advised that I build credit over the next year and then re-apply to some of the major banks.\n\nI was working with clients and getting payments (albeit not that many) for six months before I successfully opened a bank account. Thanks to services like Paypal, Square, and Venmo I was able to do that. I’d highly recommend working with a service like that if you are going to be working with clients back in the States. It makes the invoice payment process much smoother for both parties.\n\nWith corporate clients, you’ll also have to fill out a W-8 with your foreign tax ID, so it’s good to have that prepared as well.\n\nIf you are sponsoring your own visa and do not have your residency card yet, I would advise you to wait to go to the bank. If you can manage your funds and keep track of different business and personal expenses in the meantime, I think that would be your best bet—just to avoid some of the headache.\n\nAdditional Tax Resources:\n\nW-8 tax form - for foreign entities doing business with US companies.\n\nHow to fill out the W-8 form.\n\nTaxes for Expats - tax services for US citizens living abroad.\n\nTaxes in America, deciding your foreign residency status.\n\nMaking sure you've taken the appropriate steps to abandon your domicile in the United States.\n\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\n\nName: James ODonoghue\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nCompany: In House Advisory Group, helps companies in Japan navigate the American legal system.\n\nYears in Japan: 3+\n\nJames fell in love with Japan as a young adult when he discovered martial arts and read The Book of Five Rings, a book about samurai philosophy. He studied Japanese in college and went on to become a lawyer.\n\nOriginally he came to Japan on a two-month contract, which got extended to 18 months. During that time, he decided to open his own company that would help Japanese companies going through litigation with American companies. He found a partner company to work with and they’ve assisted him in the set-up process, providing translators, office space, etc.\n\nThe hardest part for him was opening a corporate bank account; in total it took about six months. It wasn’t that he was approaching lots of banks and getting turned down; it was instead that in order to persuade the first bank he applied to to work with him he had to go through a lot of meetings and be patient.\n\nHe ended up going with Mitsubishi UFJ, the third largest bank in the world. He chose this bank because he heard having an established bank would increase his company’s credibility with clients and colleagues. Ideally he would have been able to work with Citibank, a company that is known for making it easy to transfer money between countries. But, since he was a brand new company, he needed to go with a Japanese bank. For now it is working and he’ll stay with Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\nThe paperwork James needed to provide the bank includes:\n\nCorporate hanko (stamp)\n\nProof of registration with his local ward office of the validity of that corporate stamp\n\nProof of registration of his company (no older than 6 months)\n\nArticles of incorporation\n\nLetters explaining his business and business plan\n\nProof of citizenship\n\nLease for the corporate offices\n\nInterviews at the bank focused on explaining James’ work, the purpose of his company, and his plan for acquiring business in Japan. He brought a translator to all the meetings. The translator was invaluable because the meetings were conducted 100% in Japanese, and while James speaks some Japanese, he didn’t want anything misunderstood. Through his translator he was able to communicate clearly and effectively.\n\nJames also brings up the point that all applications have to be filled out by the actual applicant and not their translator. That means you’ll be writing in complex kanjis on all the forms and in many cases the staff will ask you to rewrite it if you have made a mistake. James redid his application for a cash card five different times before they accepted it. Be prepared for instances like this when you are at the bank. If you think it will only take one hour, schedule four. That will cut back on any pressure you feel to hurry the meeting along.\n\nJames’ advice for individuals about to go through the process:\n\nReflections, Learnings, and Looking Forward\n\nIn total, it took seven months from when I first messaged the lawyers, went through the visa process, and opened a corporate bank account. It would have been faster, probably closer to five months, if I had transitioned my certificate of eligibility into a working visa right after I got it at the end of April. However, I have no complaints about how long it took. During that time I was able to build a web presence, test offerings, and begin working with clients. I was always able to run the business; the only things I wasn’t able to do until I had my visa were open a corporate bank account, get a Japanese cell phone number, and enter into a lease.\n\nThe initial costs were around 8,000 USD, not including living expenses.\n\nAt the start of this article, I mentioned that I faced “unforeseen” challenges throughout the process. How arrogant of me to expect that as a first-timer and a foreigner in a new country I would already “know” the process—and to be surprised that the challenges that came up were unforeseen. Of course they were! I’d never started a company in Japan before!\n\nThe biggest actual challenge in the whole process was managing myself and my expectations. At times I was impatient and pushy and created undue stress for myself and others. I didn’t feel efficient working within the system and was frustrated by the fact that it always took me three or more conversations with the same person to get something done. I wondered what I was doing wrong and how I could have prepared better and been more effective. No one was doing anything wrong and no one was being purposefully unhelpful, although I often felt that people didn’t want to take responsibility for things. In most cases it was just a matter of learning about the system and then following the steps laid out. It’s actually straightforward, but it just took time to learn. Starting a company has been insanely humbling. Moving forward I have a better understanding of my tendencies and will work to lead with patience, curiosity, and the willingness to ask for help.\n\nIn 2017 I’m offering my traditional services like trips to the House of Light and the Kumano Kodo and working one-on-one with individuals and corporations coming to Japan while also experimenting with new ways that the values of the organization can come to life through local partnerships, writing, research, and artist engagement. Specifically, I'm looking to partner with Universities and NGO's to bring their service providers to remote regions throughout Japan.\n\nMy pie-in-the-sky dream is being a part of a project like the Benesse Art Site in Naoshima, whose mission is to create a space where visitors can reimagine their lives for the better. But that’s a very, very long-term vision.\n\nFor the short-term, here’s my bucket list for experiences to have in 2017:\n\nExperience winter in Hokkaido: drift ice in the Okhotsk Sea, igloos on Shikaribetsuko, and the famous Shirogane lake near Biei (maybe some skiing too)\n\nStay at the Airbnb Community Center in Yoshino, Nara\n\nHike the Nakasendo Trail\n\nSnorkel in Ishigaki, Okinawa\n\nDance at the Awadori Festival, Shikoku\n\nSurf the beaches of Kyushu and visit Nagasaki\n\nCelebrate at the summer matsuri in Aomori and Akita\n\nFollow Basho's footsteps from Nikko to Kanazawa\n\nMake sake at a brewery in Niigata\n\nMeditate with monks and celebrate New Year’s at Koyasan\n\nDear Reader,\n\nThank you so much for your time. I hope this has given you insight into the process and some tools to move forward.\n\nI have a few requests for you before we sign off:\n\nIf you know someone with an interesting perspective on Japan that I should interview, please introduce.\n\nIf you know a special place in Japan that should be visited, let me know.\n\nIf you know a unique hands-on experience to try, send along the details.\n\nOr if you know someone offering a similar service anywhere in the world, please put us in touch. I’m hoping to create a better network of service providers in the year to come.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBest of luck with your ventures!\n\nP.S. Who can help me figure this out?\n\nThank you!\n\nThis article would not have been possible without the help of:\n\nLesley and Gregg Adamo, Rob Arimoto, Kate Bagby, Edward Wexler-Baron\n\nCatie and Patrick Beard, Nathan Bryant, Yabu Cui, Robin and Ryan Derose, Kathy Dick, Jack and Katie Egan, Noriko Endo, Carrie Foran, Yesenia Garcia, David Gilbert, Bryan Guerra, Adrian Hogan, Sarah Horowitz, Kyoko Imai, Yasuhiro Imai , David Jones, Raphael Lee, Abby Leonard, Margaret McCarthy, Mark McFarlane, Laura and Mike McLively, Luis Mendo, Jesse Liebenson-Morse, Joseph Mueller, Keith Mueller, Megan Mueller, Vanessa Mueller, Akari Murata, James ODonoghue, Kohei Okada, Cara O’Shell, Chris Palmieri, Venetia Pristavec, Christina Ramos, Christian Rongavilla, Jimmy Royston, Jessica Semaan, Kendra Salvatore, Karishma Shah, Yulia Skogoreva, Josh Smith, Bob Stilger, Ryota Sugai, Rajitha Thejani, Curt, Heather, Lacie, Neil and Pierce Thorne, Andrew Vilcsak, Mariel Lozano Villarreal, Yusuke Wakamiya, Georgie Willis, Izumi Yoshimura"
