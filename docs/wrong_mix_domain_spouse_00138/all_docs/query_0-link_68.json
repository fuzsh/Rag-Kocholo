More people than can be named have contributed to it, and acknowledging them all would be impossible. But tracing a bit of that history and noting those who have played signiﬁcant roles are important, as this book would not be what it is without them. While my interest in cinema long preceded any scholarly study of it, my years spent at the University of Manitoba were foundational as they introduced new ways of experiencing and thinking and writing about ﬁlms—in fact, new ways to be fascinated by them, and so needing to think and write about them. Much of the spirit of this book owes a debt to my ﬁrst teachers of ﬁlm: Frank Burke, Steve Snyder, Gene Walz, and especially George Toles, on whom nothing is lost. A ten-year stint in Rochester, New York, proved the cauldron for many of the ideas and their original drafting into a large-scale study of European art cinema. My graduate education at the University of Rochester, as guided by Kaja Silverman, Constance Penley, John Michael, Thomas DiPiero, Sharon Willis, Jan-Christopher Horak, and Lisa Cartwright, has directed this work in untold ways, as have the convivial discussions and countless generosities of the friendships forged during my time there, particularly with Mark Lynn Anderson, Michele Balze, Mark Berrettini, Matthew Brown, Robert Cagle, Ed Chan, Lalitha Gopalan, Kelly Hankin, Dave Headlam, Amy Herzog, Bethany Hicok, Amanda Howell, Grant Kester, Jonathan Miller, Tina Takemoto, Swen Voekel, Anna Williams, and Daniela Zanzotto. A George Eastman House Graduate Fellowship opened wide the portals to an archive and a world I would encourage all to visit. The practically unlimited access I was granted to the Eastman House’s collections, library, and people over a period of more than three years has left its stamp on this book in ways both indelible and unfathomable; I am vii\n\nviii | Acknowledgments\n\nthankful to Chris Horak, Paolo Cherchi Usai, and Ed Stratmann, among many others, for showing me an archivist’s understanding of the medium and its history, as well as for supporting my own research activities (whether or not they were in strict accord with my programming duties). Other archives and individuals have beneﬁted this book over the years. Charles Silver and Ron Magliozzi have been great resources, as has the Museum of Modern Art’s Film Study Center. Untold hours were spent poring through the ﬁles and collections of the Performing Arts Research Library and the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library (both at Lincoln Center); the Margaret Herrick Library and the Academy Film Archive, Beverly Hills; the Harvard Film Archive; and the Special Collections and National Film Library of the British Film Institute. My appreciation and thanks go to the staffs of these collections. Conversations with and good humor provided by associates at the University of Alberta, especially Bill Beard, Aniko Bodroghkozy, Chris Gittings, Gamal Abdel-Shehid, Maria Ng, Paul Robberecht, and Anne Whitelaw, were helpful during a transition phase of this work. I am grateful to several colleagues at King’s College London for their support as I ﬁnished research and writing, particularly Stephanie Green, Sarah Cooper, Michele Pierson, Richard Dyer, and Ginette Vincendeau. King’s College provided me with two small research grants for overseas research, as well as a one-term sabbatical leave. Students at both institutions were constantly inspirational, and I especially thank those who challenged my positions on art cinema—I can only hope they found our classes and discussions as engaging as I have. The same holds true for the many audiences at conferences and public lectures to whom I have presented portions of this research. Conferences include the Ohio University Film Conference, the Screen Studies Conference in Glasgow, and several annual meetings of the Film Studies Association of Canada and the Society for Cinema and Media Studies. Lectures were given at the University of Kent Canterbury, the University of Nottingham, University College London, the University of Sussex, Shih Hsin University in Taipei, and National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. I am grateful to Kien Ket Lim for inviting me to Taiwan and for making that unforgettable trip possible.\n\nAcknowledgments | ix\n\nI would like to recognize other colleagues and friends who have contributed valuable advice, feedback, or assistance at different moments of this project: Dominique Bluher, Jonathan Buchsbaum, Liz Czach, Kay Dickinson, Rosalind Galt, Mark Jancovich, Ernest Mathijs, Laura Mulvey, Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, John David Rhodes, Sara Ross, Christel Schmidt, and Haidee Wasson. Dana Polan’s critical comments on the manuscript were very helpful, as were the reports prepared by Peter Brunette, whose suggestions and advocacy for the book proved invaluable in the revision process. Lee Grieveson has been a playful and serious critic of my work for the past several years, and his camaraderie through some hard graft warrants special mention. Three close personal friends, along with my family, have lived with this book hovering over me for too many years, and I treasure their warmth and understanding: Derek Brueckner, Bruce McCulloch, and Derrick Larsen, my siblings Michele, Vaughn, Patrick, and Grant, and my parents Isabel and Bill. I appreciate the conﬁdence and support of the good people at the University of Minnesota Press who patiently prodded me through the editing and production processes of the book, especially copy editor Nancy Sauro and my editor Jason Weidemann. The glorious cover still was generously furnished by Ginette Vincendeau from her own collection. Markos Hadjioannou provided valuable and considerable help with the index. Four individuals in my life and my work have loomed large during the book’s origins and completion. David Rodowick was a mentor, a friend, and a tireless supporter of this project, never failing to encourage me through the valleys and devoting much time and energy to reading and discussing its various guises; his inﬂuence and guidance are immeasurable. My cherished friendships with Heather Hendershot and John Palattella date back nearly twenty years and are abiding; their boundless acumen, bonhomie, and generosity have been instrumental. Finally, I would never have been able to see the book through without the careful reading of the manuscript given by Rosemary Barrow, whose example, patience, and belief ensured its completion and continue to sustain me beyond.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it “the way it really was” (Ranke). It means to seize hold of a memory as it ﬂashes up at a moment of danger. —Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History”\n\nWhither Art Cinema? In February 1996, following a year of celebrations marking the centenary of cinema, a two-page article in the New York Times Magazine mourned the passing of a particular era in the ﬁrst one hundred years of the medium’s history. Penned by Susan Sontag,“The Decay of Cinema” recalls with bittersweet melancholy an age of cinephilia “born of the conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other: quintessentially modern; distinctively accessible; poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral—all at the same time. For cinephiles, the movies encapsulated everything. Cinema was both the book of art and the book of life.”1 The cinephilia Sontag describes “became a passion among university students and other young people” who shared “not simply love of but a certain taste in ﬁlms,” most particularly those that succeeded in resolving the “conﬂict between cinema as an industry and cinema as an art, cinema as routine and cinema as experiment.” As a contrast to this era of practically unbridled worship at the altar of cinematic art—the religious metaphor is explicitly woven into the prose—Sontag juxtaposes the present, wherein ﬁlms are no longer watched on theater screens but televisual ones, conditions that “are radically disrespectful to ﬁlm”; wherein “the unprincipled manipulation of images . . . has produced a disincarnated, lightweight cinema” lost in a sea of moving images that “has steadily undermined the standards people once had both for cinema as art and cinema as popular entertainment”; wherein “the lowering of expectations for quality and the inﬂation of expectations for proﬁt” have made it all but impossible 1\n\n2 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nfor “artistically ambitious” directors “to work at their best level” and rendered “the idea of the ﬁlm as, ﬁrst of all, a poetic object” as “something quaint, outmoded, snobbish.” Her elegy concludes with a muted call for “the birth of a new kind of cine-love” at the close of the twentieth century to revivify what has become “a decadent art.” Sontag’s New York Times Magazine piece, subsequently expanded in a journal article and a short book chapter,2 is a cogent evocation of a certain version of ﬁlm culture’s investments as well as its take on the history of the cinema: one suﬀused with wonder, mystery, pleasure, and now nostalgia for a declining art form; one rooted in an almost exclusively aesthetic regard for its love object; one concerned with the exceptional rather than the usual, with the rare rather than the ordinary, with “masterpieces”—even if there were new ones every month. It is also a history that is of central interest to this book, concerning as it does the international proﬁle once enjoyed by European art cinema. Indeed, when Sontag refers to the third quarter of the twentieth century as “the feverish age of moviegoing,” especially the ﬁfteen-year period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, she is making a qualitative rather than quantitative statement for the United States in particular, for during this time the total number of American cinemagoers was continuing a steady decline that began after its peak year of 1946, a decline that the national ﬁlm industries of Europe would also soon encounter. Moviegoing during this period was not “feverish” for mass audiences but for a specialized one for whom attending the cinema was not a recreational but a cultural, even intellectual activity; ﬁlms directed by Roberto Rossellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Jean-Luc Godard, the three European directors Sontag names, were considered by this audience as works “of the highest seriousness.” For the most part, it is this audience that formed the parameters upon which such ﬁlms and their meanings were and continue largely to be based. In other words, a certain kind of ﬁlm culture was fostered in the ﬁrst three postwar decades (and reached its apogee in European art cinema of the 1960s) that has shaped our understanding of cinema ever since. For during this decade the idea that ﬁlmmaking was a personal form of artistic expression combined with the international marketing of European ﬁlms in ways that distinguished the latter as more than mere commercial entertainments—and in ways that have indelibly stamped both the history of the cinema and the practices of Anglo-American academic ﬁlm studies.\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 3\n\nThis ﬁlm culture, as Sontag so succinctly summarized in 1996 and thirty years earlier had participated in as an advocate and exegete of several European art ﬁlms and directors, would seem to be in its ﬁnal death throes.3 The recent publication of three books on cinephilia, however, is one indication that this is not the case; rather, the particular type of cinephilia Sontag mourns has been transformed by new technologies at the same time as its initial impulses have been maintained.4 In the contemporary ﬁlm festival world it is largely the cinemas of Asia and Eastern Central Europe that continue to produce art cinema, now denoted as “world cinema,” with ﬁlmmakers like Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Ming-liang, Zhang Ke-jia, Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Andrei Sokurov, Béla Tarr, and Nuri Bilge Ceylan continuing to make challenging ﬁlms based on the long-take aesthetic favored by Sontag. As well, the picture changes considerably if the focus of inquiry is expanded to include objects other than ﬁlms or their auteurs. In the true spirit of the cinephile, Sontag pits cinema as an art against cinema as an industry and bemoans the “melancholy fate of some of the greatest directors of the last decades” as proﬁt margins have eclipsed more noble aesthetic aspirations. In Sontag’s estimation,“original, passionate ﬁlms,” their artistically ambitious makers, and knowledgeable, tasteful spectators were the prime ingredients constituting the rise of cinephilia, and they are still now the only hope for halting its decay. But it is possible to oﬀer a diﬀerent history of ﬁlm culture in this era, one that might regard ﬁlms and their directors as something less than the most important components in a network of forces contributing to ﬁlm culture in its broadest sense. For to examine the historical status of European art cinema and ﬁlm culture, one must consider what most determines the ways in which its ﬁlms and ﬁlmmakers are received by audiences: written and spoken discourses on or about cinema, including academic scholarship and teaching. In this sense, I understand the institutions devoted to the study, the appreciation of the cinema in both meanings of the word, as being very much alive. What is dead, however, is the particular object of Sontag’s age of cinephilia: European art cinema as an intellectual, even viably commercial force on contemporary American and British screens. To understand why this is so, it is necessary ﬁrst to examine brieﬂy what appeal art cinema held for its audiences, the preferred ways in\n\n4 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nwhich its formal experiment and diﬃculty were interpreted, what it was about these European ﬁlms of the 1960s that so excited “university students and other young people.” Anglo-American academic interest in art cinema never reached a groundswell approaching the level of cinephilia that Sontag has described, and the reasons for this require explication as well. But before turning to the academic side of things, I want to stay for the moment close to the languages of art cinema’s time, for it is in these that the framework for its understanding was established and continues to inhere. I want, in other words, to keep an eye on what Sontag so passionately loved. In doing so I will indicate some long-standing interrelations between ﬁlm culture and academic ﬁlm studies, both during and after the great age of European art cinema and cinephilia—interrelations that have yet to be adequately explored. What did art cinema mean for its audiences? The answers to this question are as varied as the approaches and agendas of the ﬁlm spectators, critics, scholars, and historians who have asked it—and in this they are perfectly in line with the quality of “open” textuality so often invoked in discussions of art ﬁlms and art cinema. In the context of the modern Italian cinema of the 1960s, the ﬁlm historian Pierre Sorlin reports: “Contemporary audiences were interested and puzzled, they wondered what these works were about. There was no answer to their query. However, it could have been argued that the ﬁlms were about time, about cinema and about spectators.”5 Time, cinema, spectatorship: to these must be added authorship, in my estimation a crucial fourth term and in fact the anchor that holds the others from swirling oﬀ into undecidability. If art cinema is about itself—the variable spatial and temporal organizations of its design (form), the aesthetic heritage that serves as its animus and to which it so frequently refers (cinema), the space and experience of viewing (spectatorship)—this circuit of potential meanings nonetheless achieves ultimate resonance through the signature of its director/creator (authorship). To understand an art ﬁlm, at least on its own terms, is to recognize its status as a selfreferential aesthetic production, a system of motifs, allusions, and devices that the director combines to create a complex world of signs. Time in modern European cinema is frequently held as the hallmark of its particular formal innovations in narration and storytelling. Unlike classical cinema—with its rather strict and elaborate set of rules\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 5\n\nthat presuppose and reinforce a stable viewing position through a steady ﬂow of diﬀering views of time, space, and character in accordance with conventions of linear causality, continuity, and narrative—art cinema works the extremes of the temporal-spatial-narrative continuum, testing the boundaries among foregrounded aesthetic construction, spectatorial engagement, and narrative intelligibility. The ﬁlmic registration and manipulation of time is in fact, as Gilles Deleuze has famously proposed, the key factor in the operation of modern cinema.6 In certain ﬁlms time is compressed through editing so as to evoke a world of abrupt change, shock, and speed, as in the famous jump cuts that punctuate the driving sequences in Jean-Luc Godard’s A bout de souﬄe (Breathless, 1960), most particularly the solo ride Jean-Paul Belmondo/ Michel takes in a newly stolen car at the beginning of the ﬁlm that results in his unplanned murder of a motorcycle cop and sets the tempo for the remainder of the drama, with Michel contradictorily on the lam by openly traversing the daylit streets of Paris, waiting for love and money as the ineﬀectual forces of law and order nevertheless close in. Assembled in an intensely present tense, Alain Resnais’s Muriel ou le temps d’un retour (Muriel, 1963) concentrates time in its second and fourth acts through the extraordinarily tight sequencing of brief shots whose juxtaposition suggests simultaneity of action and spatial separation. The narrative line is thus advanced in ﬁts and starts, evoking the pulsions and ﬂashes of memory through a rigorous strategy of presentation that shows spaces marked by and characters obsessed with the past, but only in snatches of an incessantly retreating present. More often, however, the sum produced by adding the variables “time” and “art ﬁlm” is “slow.” In the languid, seemingly directionless trajectories of much of European art cinema, the question of meaning is even more achingly evoked. As plot winds down and character motivation becomes null, the so-called dead time (temps mort) and apparently empty narrative spaces of art cinema may create discomfort for viewers who, accustomed to clearly motivated action or dialogue or movement, feel pressured to ﬁll the image with their own thoughts or mental images. The noisy reception that greeted Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’avventura when it was screened publicly in 1960 at the Cannes Film Festival demonstrated, through the chorus of shouting and whistling and the cries of “Cut!” punctuating the ﬁlm’s long takes and silences, the festival audience’s impatience with the ﬁlm’s\n\n6 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nunhurried tempo.7 It also marked the arrival on the international ﬁlm scene of a ﬁgure who has since served as an archetype for the cerebral and contemplative (as opposed to instinctual and dynamic) art ﬁlm director. But such ﬁlms were not without their viewing pleasures for those willing to take the time. The moments of spatial or temporal excess, unjustiﬁed by the narrative requirements of the story, could become justiﬁed and rendered meaningful through the active engagement of the spectator. And in the heyday of art cinema there were plenty of viewers up for the challenge, not just a small coterie of cinema specialists; L’avventura went on to successful runs in major cities internationally. Even at Cannes, Antonioni was not without his defenders. Many of the inﬂuential critics and industry personnel present rallied to his defense by drafting and presenting him with a collective statement of admiration and support.8 Six years later, Christian Metz would write that Antonioni’s cinema was a new—and a profoundly original—appreciation of what is or is not a “dull moment” in life, and it is not based on a mere aesthetics of space that is ﬁlmically “dead.” Innovation is an ideological rather than a cinematographic matter, and Antonioni is “modern” far more because of the human substance of his ﬁlms than because of their “language.” He excels in showing us the diﬀuse signiﬁcance of those moments of everyday life that are considered insigniﬁcant; integrated within the ﬁlm, the dull moment is reborn to our perception.9\n\nAs the examples of the Cannes screening and the preceding quote demonstrate, separating time, cinematic knowledge, and spectatorship is diﬃcult when considering the conventions of meaning evoked and addressed by art cinema. The durational time of the ﬁlms of Antonioni, Resnais, and Robert Bresson is, as John Orr describes it,“mesmeric, hypnotic, a magnet to the gaze even when its narrative appears endless, directionless, indeterminate.”10 But it is also a time that, by its very elongation, draws attention to cinematic mise-en-scène and the tacit contract that exists between the narrative ﬁlm and its spectator. What is modern about this cinema is its renegotiation of that contract, its formal mimicry of the subjective experience of time—as ﬂying, as dragging—the cinematic representation of which invites, compels the viewer to reﬂect on the time of the ﬁlm itself and, by association, cinema itself.\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 7\n\nDudley Andrew has tendered a claim for the French New Wave as “the ﬁrst movement in the history of cinema to take its inspiration quite openly from the history of cinema itself—rather than from the world or the broader culture.” For Andrew, who singles out a scene inside a movie theater showing re-creations of early Lumière actualities in Godard’s Les Carabiniers (1963), the French New Wave, indeed French cinema more generally, is preoccupied “more with the experience of cinema than with the world the cinema exhibits” and interested more “with the space of the movie theater and what can happen within it than with the magniﬁcent and varied landscapes of France itself.”11 In a similar vein, Robert Phillip Kolker states the following of Resnais’s L’Année dernière à Marienbad (1961): “What Last Year at Marienbad is ‘about’ is the way we look at ﬁlm and the way ﬁlm regards its subjects, the characters in it and the characters who watch it. It is about the creation of cinematic narrative and the conventions that have developed through the history of that creation.”12 To watch these ﬁlms is to do more than appreciate their reﬂexivity toward the history of the cinema, toward themselves as aesthetic artifacts, and toward the theatrical space of their viewing; it is also to participate in their production of meaning. This consensus in fact takes it cues from the critical writings of the period and often from the ﬁlmmakers themselves. Resnais’s Muriel, for example, set in the aftermath of the long Algerian war, appears to be only marginally about Algeria and more centrally concerned with the French perception of Algeria as an imperfectly repressed memory. In this respect it is not so diﬃcult to see why an analysis of the ﬁlm might take the following steps: Muriel is not about Algeria, nor even about France; it is about Resnais, and as such, about cinema. In a critical roundtable published in Cahiers du cinéma in late 1963, the movement toward this position is an illuminating demonstration of what may be characterized as a preferred reading of modern cinema. Claude Ollier speaks at length near the beginning of the discussion as he extends the idea that Muriel is an “‘expanded’ sequel” to Resnais’s previous ﬁlm, “a Marienbad suddenly plunged into history. . . . In Marienbad you could tell yourself ultimately—it’s a nightmare, it’s all very beautiful, but that’s it. While in Muriel you have Boulognesur-Mer, the France of lower middle-class Europe in all the colours of today’s world, and it’s the same nightmare.”13 The conversation\n\n8 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nquickly turns, however, toward a “purer” form of meaning interpretation, one centered not simply on the previous work of the ﬁlm’s director but quite literally inside the director himself, as in the following exchange between Jean-Louis Comolli and André S. Labarthe: [Comolli:] It would be a mistake to imagine that Resnais is trying to present a picture of the outside world, in whatever style, or even that he is interested in the outside world or in extrapolating some new logical system from it. . . . An investigation is under way all right, but it’s turned on himself and what he ends up by discovering is himself. He is executing a self-portrait using the characters he interposes and disguised situations. So the pointers he gives, which are simply traces of Resnais himself, serve a purpose for him as much for us. Labarthe: That’s right. Because these characters are in the end all to some extent Resnais’s fantasy of himself. Comolli: All the characters in the ﬁlm are Resnais.14\n\nFor the rest of the conversation, any eﬀorts to analyze the ﬁlm in relation to France (let alone Algeria) or the particularities of its images, its narrative, or its historical moment and place are tabled in favor of more generalized musings about Resnais’s worldview or about the collective totality of new European cinema. The roundtable thus enacts precisely the repression that is at least one of the ﬁlm’s levels of address. More important, it represents a dominant reading strategy for art cinema, one that retreats “from the world or the broader culture” in favor of authorship and critical biography. In eﬀect, this interpretive line limits the outcomes for active viewing that modern European cinema provokes and enables. Within an economy that regards the director as both generator and locus of meaning, viewers of the art ﬁlm are encouraged to reﬂect any enlightenment they might receive back onto the director in a closed circuit of mutual yet hierarchical exchange.15 In its most extreme manifestations of unbridled evaluative enthusiasm, the brilliance of the director is magniﬁed with every critical reﬂection, and the spectator/reader illuminated in the pale light of the afterglow. Writing on Last Year at Marienbad for Cahiers du cinéma in 1961, Labarthe places it next to Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941) and Rossellini’s Paisà (1946) as examples of modern ﬁlms that no longer oﬀer “predigested material ready for absorption. On the contrary, they present the spectator with\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 9\n\nraw material (even if it has in fact been heavily worked on) from which he may extract his own ﬁlm. . . . The true successor of the traditional ﬁlm-maker is not Resnais or Robbe-Grillet, but the spectator of Marienbad.”16 The line between ﬁlm criticism and ﬁlmmaking—a line already literally crossed by several of Labarthe’s colleagues at Cahiers— is here presented as one that the act of ﬁlm viewing itself can collapse. In short, the critical aim is to become one with the ﬁlm’s creator. While recognizing a certain elegance in this particular analytical line, I must also point out that it is bound by a closed circuit of exchange between text, spectatorship, and director. Apart from their Ouroboros-like qualities, such readings must be seen from a historical perspective as having by and large exhausted their critical usefulness as concerns postwar European art cinema, given not only their destination but also their ubiquity—it is diﬃcult to conceive of any new knowledges to be advanced by them. I am therefore not in this book taking the position that art cinema’s meaning is ultimately or even predominantly a thematic or an aesthetic one limited to individual ﬁlms, to their makers, or to the moments in the history of cinema to which they might refer, nor even to the individual national cinemas with which most art ﬁlms and directors are associated and understood to represent. These are nonetheless powerful discursive positions subtending critical and historical work on European art cinema in AngloAmerican academic ﬁlm studies today. In what ways has ﬁlm studies analyzed and/or historicized art cinema? Before answering this question, one must address why art cinema is more or less synonymous in the ﬁeld with a particular outpouring of narrative ﬁlms from Europe in the postwar era. Haidee Wasson has noted how the phrase “ﬁlm art” can invoke very diﬀerent assumptions about aesthetics, practice, and politics. Terms such as foreign cinema, experimental ﬁlm, avant-garde cinema, art cinema, modernist cinema, and classical Hollywood cinema can all be considered subcategories of the more general category of ﬁlm art. Each refers to a very diﬀerent conﬁguration of what ﬁlm art might be. A term might identify a ﬁlm as art based on a particular mode of production, a national origin, or a specialized mode of exhibition. The idea of art cinema might be underpinned by formal principles based on modernist theories of disruption. It might describe a group of ﬁlms, made and seen at a particular point in history, circumscribed by common formal features and points of origin (German expressionism, French New Wave). Some scholars have suggested\n\n10 | Recovering European Art Cinema that ﬁlm art is best understood as a generic strategy designed to counter Hollywood’s reign or American international dominance. Some people use the term to indicate ﬁlms they like a lot.17\n\nWhile the variables “ﬁlm” and “art” yield a panoply of responses, tastes, and specialized terms, those of “art” and “cinema” present a more circumscribed terrain: a distinct set of formal properties or a style of narration linked to modernist aesthetics; a body of ﬁlms that cohere by period and national origin and are designed to distinguish themselves from or compete with Hollywood cinema by being diﬀerent from it. In Anglo-American ﬁlm culture, these two possibilities have congealed so that art cinema overwhelmingly refers to a volume of narrative ﬁlms produced in Europe from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s that share modernist formal traits, distinguishable in terms of their respective national movements and designed to counter Hollywood dominance on screens in Europe and abroad, including the United States itself. In other words, art cinema is both a formal-aesthetic category and a national-institutional one, historically and geographically locatable to postwar Europe, especially the 1960s. How ﬁlm studies has analyzed and/or historicized art cinema is inseparable from these overlapping categories, which have been ampliﬁed by two inﬂuential articles published within two years of one another at the turn of the 1980s: David Bordwell’s “The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice” (1979) and Steve Neale’s “Art Cinema as Institution” (1981).18 While neither article contains the word “European” in its title, the examples they use concentrate largely (Bordwell) or entirely (Neale) on the ﬁlms or cinemas of Europe, France and Italy in particular. They have become the two touchstone texts on art cinema as a discursive ﬁeld in Anglo-American ﬁlm studies, the evidence of which can be seen in two key collections: The Oxford History of World Cinema, which contains an essay titled “Art Cinema” in its ﬁnal section that concentrates on European cinemas of the 1960s; and The European Cinema Reader, which includes a subsection on art cinema in its third part,“European Films and Theory,” comprising only Bordwell’s and Neale’s articles.19 Indeed, my own understanding of European art cinema and deployment of that term derives in many ways from the positions articulated in these pieces.20 In “The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice,” Bordwell distinguishes art cinema from “classical narrative cinema” and “modernist\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 11\n\ncinema.”21 If classical Hollywood cinema motivates itself on the causeeﬀect linkage of events to tell a coherent story, art cinema motivates its narrative by two principles: realism and authorial expressivity. For Bordwell, art cinema “softened modernism’s attack of narrative causality by creating mediating structures,” such as objective and subjective verisimilitude and character subjectivity, neither of which are requirements for modernism.22 Importantly, art cinema presents itself as a realist cinema. Classical cinema does not depend on realism per se but verisimilitude,“the appearance of being true or real,” with this appearance being tied not to the “real world” that its spectators live in and themselves live but to a plausible ﬁctional world whose conventions depend largely on the genre of the ﬁlm and not natural laws. By contrast, art cinema shows us real locations and real problems and “uses realistic—that is, psychologically complex—characters.” Like classical cinema, art cinema is centrally concerned with characters and their eﬀects on one another. But unlike classical cinema, art cinema presents characters without clearly deﬁned goals or desires. As a result, the art ﬁlm’s “attempt to pronounce judgement on ‘modern life’ as a whole thus proceeds from its formal needs: had the characters a goal, life would no longer seem so meaningless.”23 The psychological emphasis of much art cinema means that its causation is equally psychological rather than story-driven:“art cinema is less concerned with action than reaction”; cause-eﬀect logic is attenuated in favor of slow, reﬂective causation.24 This adds to the realism of art cinema in terms of its salient stylistic traits: long takes, real-time exposition with temps mort, a characteristic slowness of pace; or jump cuts, montage that mixes up story order, fast motion, freeze frames, or other violations of “real time” to express the psychological experience of characters and their actions or reactions. But art cinema also foregrounds the author—the director—“as a structure in the ﬁlm’s system” of operations, a “formal component” of the ﬁlm, “the overriding intelligence organizing the ﬁlm for our comprehension.” The art ﬁlm thus “uses a concept of authorship to unify the text.” The viewer of an art ﬁlm is expected then to be at least familiar with the general principle of the director as auteur and preferably with the particular stylistic signatures of the director in question, as every ﬁlm “oﬀers itself as a chapter in an ouvre [sic],” an ongoing artistic project.25 What these two contrary impulses—realism, authorial expressivity—lead to ultimately\n\n12 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nis ambiguity, for Bordwell the key attribute of art cinema. Breaks in classical narration can be interpreted as a move on the part of the ﬁlm toward greater realism or overt authorial commentary or both. The open textual quality of art ﬁlms, their extending of themselves as something to be read, is a function of such ambiguity. Two years after Bordwell, Steve Neale provided the most detailed explication that Anglo-American ﬁlm studies has to date of European art cinema as a set of institutional forces. In “Art Cinema as Institution” he deﬁnes art cinema as a series of historically and nationally situated attempts by “a number of European countries both to counter American domination of their indigenous markets in ﬁlm and also to foster a ﬁlm industry and a ﬁlm culture of their own.”26 Certain nations of Europe deliberately aimed to put into circulation ﬁlms that were distinct from those produced and distributed by the Hollywood studios so as to compete with them for their own audiences. This aim was activated on two complementary fronts: one ideological, the other economic/industrial. Following on from Bordwell, Neale observes that the formal features connoting realism in art cinema “function as the positive marks of Art” and that those that emphasize the hand of the director “engage the other primary ideology of Art, the Romantic view that Art is subjective expression.”27 The discourses of art and culture are thus woven into the formal operations of art cinema itself through its variety of expressive possibilities, but these are also “contained both by the economic infrastructure of Art Cinema, its basis in commodity-dominated modes of production, distribution, and exhibition, and by repetitions that tend to mark cultural discourses in general and the discourses of high art and culture in particular.”28 In other words, art ﬁlms depend on long-standing ideas regarding art as individual and creative-expressive as well as the speciﬁc market for trading such ideas as artisanal objects. Here is where the economic/industrial front is key, particularly in the postwar era: the production and dissemination of art ﬁlms depend on infrastructures provided by national institutions, both unoﬃcial (ciné-clubs, magazines, journals) and oﬃcial (quota legislation, taxes on foreign ﬁlm receipts, subsidies, and other forms of state ﬁnancial support). Interventions by industries and governments and the incentives for native productions of artistic value they provided were thus generative forces in the institutionalization of art cinema.\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 13\n\nBy way of concretization, Neale traces the instances of art cinema institutionalization in France, Germany, and Italy. The historical moments and movements range from the ﬁrst French avant-garde and German expressionism in the 1920s to Italian neorealism in the late 1940s through early 1950s, to the French New Wave and the Italian ﬁlm renaissance from the late 1950s through mid-1960s, to the New German cinema from the mid-1960s through mid-1970s. Neale establishes a pattern across this history, one that moves from early proletarian appeal to the development of a bourgeois audience in the 1910s, to the ﬁrst protective legislations in the 1920s, to the postwar era, when “state support became ﬁrmly linked to the promotion and development of national Art Cinemas under the aegis of liberal-democratic and social democratic governments and under the pressure of the presence of America and Hollywood in Europe. The result was an eﬄorescence of Art Cinema, the production of the ﬁlms and the ﬁgures and the movements with which Art Cinema tends massively to be associated today.”29 This eﬄorescence involved a balance “between a national aspect on the one hand and an international aspect on the other.” The incursion of Hollywood ﬁlms in Europe was perceived “as a speciﬁcally national problem,” and art ﬁlms bore the marks of their nationalities—language being the most important—in ways that served “further to diﬀerentiate them from the ﬁlms produced in Hollywood.”30 At the same time, art cinema circulates internationally as a specialized or niche sector; it functions as “a mechanism of discrimination” for a particular class of audience existing across nations.31 It is in this sense that art cinema itself can be understood as an institution. Bordwell and Neale present two diﬀerent approaches to art cinema as a distinct category of ﬁlm style and production, one aesthetic and one economic/institutional. But it is their similarities rather than their diﬀerences that have proven the most abiding: that art cinema is fundamentally opposed to Hollywood cinema; that it constitutes a European response to Hollywood; and that its richest vein appeared in the postwar era, especially in the 1960s. While both authors consider art cinema as a broad category, these speciﬁcities are the ones that have been pursued in Anglo-American ﬁlm studies in their wake. But other aspects of these articles have been even more inﬂuential. In the case of Bordwell’s, the emphasis on formal textual structures and the importance of the director within those structures has yielded countless\n\n14 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nthematic/mise-en-scène analyses of individual (European) ﬁlms and auteurs that constitute one of the main lines of art cinema scholarship. This course is a continuation of that practiced by critics at the time of art cinema’s eﬄorescence, at home and abroad.32 Indeed, Neale ends his piece with a plea to displace “two conceptions central to the institution of art cinema . . . those of authorship on the one hand, and of the individual, self-contained work on the other,” a plea that has gone largely unheeded.33 The other main trajectory for art cinema scholarship proceeds from Neale, though here through the organization of his argument more so than the argument itself: he structures the historical instances of art cinema institutionalization in Europe not as a chronology but in three separate sections, each devoted to one national example—France, Italy, and Germany. Art cinema as cases of national productions exempliﬁed by speciﬁc movements thus constitutes another huge body of scholarship, particularly historical/critical, in Anglo-American ﬁlm studies. Again, the studies in this research line are countless. What is countable is the number of book-length works published since the 1980s that analyze art cinema as a mode of ﬁlm practice or as an institution, of which there are four: John Orr’s Cinema and Modernity and Peter Lev’s The Euro-American Cinema (both 1993), Barbara Wilinsky’s Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema (2001), and Haidee Wasson’s Museum Movies: The Museum of Modern Art and the Birth of Art Cinema (2005).34 Orr’s work takes the formal-aesthetic approach, oﬀering largely explicative criticism of individual ﬁlms and directors within the contexts of broad postwar social and thematic categories, though it also includes some American ﬁlms and ﬁlmmakers and so does not limit itself to Europe. Lev’s too includes American ﬁlmmaking, but in a more integrated way: he examines the phenomenon of the Euro-American art ﬁlm coproduction, though mainly through case studies of individual ﬁlms. While his work does address Euro-American art cinema as a mode of ﬁlm practice to a certain extent, it favors an institutional line of analysis more.Wilinsky and Wasson follow this line as well, though in historical terms and increasingly in the American context. Sure Seaters discusses the growth of the art house exhibition circuit for foreign ﬁlms in the United States as an alternative cultural formation, especially in the 1950s.35 And Museum Movies undertakes an analysis of the transformation of cinema from\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 15\n\nan entertainment to an art form in America through close historical study of the central role played by New York’s Museum of Modern Art Film Library in the development of nontheatrical exhibition.36 As these four books attest, the institutional approach has proven the more productive for in-depth analysis of art cinema as a category as opposed to more localized instances of it, whether a national ﬁlm movement, a director’s oeuvre, or individual ﬁlms. At the same time, none of these books could be described as theoretical, and the latter three are unquestionably works of ﬁlm history (and, in Wasson’s case, of historiography). These three too increasingly align art cinema with American cinema and/or culture. This is a refreshing change from the overwhelmingly European focus of most studies of art cinema; but it also points to a certain consensus that European art cinema is now “done,” in both the market and scholarly senses of the word. Art cinema is thus both present and absent in academic ﬁlm studies, and this presence and absence has developed historically through a schism between theory and history. To understand how this split developed and why it is important to address it, one needs to return to the period of academic ﬁlm studies’ formation and examine the roles that political, cultural, industrial, intellectual, and institutional forces played in producing this outcome. At its root is the alignment of art cinema with modernism. The Break of 1968 The post–World War II era in Europe is understood in the history of the medium as a period of formation both for modern cinema and for the growth of an informed, critical, and intellectually ambitious ﬁlm culture extending beyond mere popular moviegoing.37 The standard historical account of this development centers on art cinema, especially as produced in Italy and France, in order to demonstrate the challenges it made to national commercial practices as well as to the incursions of American ﬁlm culture and capital via aesthetic innovation and personal authorial vision.38 Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Robert Bresson, Jacques Tati, Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, François Truﬀaut, Jean-Luc Godard: these and other Italian and French ﬁlmmakers of the 1950s and 1960s, along with occasional nods\n\n16 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nin the direction of Japan, Sweden, Eastern Central Europe, and India, hold prominent and imposing positions within the histories of postwar ﬁlm culture. It was during these decades, in short, that narrative ﬁlm came broadly to be accepted as an art and the ﬁlm director as an artist. It is in this period too that oﬃcial institutions dedicated to showcasing, promoting, preserving, or disseminating ﬁlmic materials and knowledge about ﬁlm settled or expanded into a compass of cultural organs: festivals, museums, institutes, and archives, what are now generally referred to as the culture industries.39 Given the ferment that led to such institutionalizations of ﬁlm culture, it is not surprising that higher educational mandates would follow suit. Indeed, riding on the slipstream of this transformation in cinema culture was academic ﬁlm studies itself, which developed in the 1960s in America (and would a few years later in Britain) into a ﬁeld that would lead to rapid growth over the next decade.40 The translation and migration of auteurism and mise-en-scène analysis of the sort exempliﬁed by Cahiers du cinéma to Britain (through the ﬁlm magazine Movie as well as the various activities of the British Film Institute’s Education Department, among others) and to the United States (largely through Andrew Sarris in his capacity as a critic for the journal Film Culture and later as editor of the short-lived Cahiers du Cinema in English), alongside the increasingly widespread international exhibition of European art cinema, contributed enormously not only to the age of cinephilia identiﬁed by Sontag but also to academic posts in ﬁlm studies in the colleges and universities of Britain and America. The creation in 1960 of a lectureship in ﬁlm at London’s Slade School of Art is a marker for the academic legitimization of cinema in the United Kingdom. Across the Atlantic, ﬁlm studies courses began appearing in ever greater numbers in the American arts and humanities curriculum throughout the 1960s, and by the end of the decade many postsecondary institutions were oﬀering fully ﬂedged ﬁlm study degree programs. As Robert C. Allen and Douglas Gomery have described it, ﬁlm studies was quite probably “the fastest growing academic discipline in American universities between 1965 and 1975.”41 The year 1968 has come to be understood as a nodal point in twentieth-century political and intellectual history, as a moment when the new world system established by the postwar settlement was revealed as not simply out of step but in open conﬂict with the values\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 17\n\nand politics of the young, the working class, students, women, and peoples of color, resulting in state-sanctioned repression of dissent to maintain power and control.42 Vietnam: the United States launches the Tet oﬀensive. Japan: students lock Nihon University administrators in their oﬃces and shut down classes. Czechoslovakia: a Sovietled invasion reverses the liberal reforms of the “Prague Spring.” Spain: after students close the University of Madrid, more than one thousand are sent to military service. Britain: a peace march in London’s Grosvenor Square sparks a battle between police and twenty thousand demonstrators.West Germany: socialist student leader Rudi Dutschke is shot in the head by a young unskilled worker, and police kill two and arrest one thousand in the insurrection that follows. Italy: student seizures of universities are supported by strikes among workers and high school students. France: ﬁlmmakers and intellectuals protest and then petition the government following the removal of Henri Langlois, the head of the Paris Cinémathèque, by French Minister of Cultural Aﬀairs André Malraux; a series of violent clashes between police and students takes place in early May in Paris’s Latin Quarter after the arrest of students at the Sorbonne; on 24 May nearly ten million French workers go on strike, with more battles at night with riot police after a ﬁre is started in the Paris stock exchange.43 Mexico: on 2 October ﬁve thousand students and workers rally at the Plaza de Las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City, demanding democratic reforms; a combined military and police assault leaves hundreds dead. United States: Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy are assassinated, the former event sparking riots and arson waves in urban ghettos across the country; campus sit-ins and revolts spread to more than two hundred campuses, notably Columbia, San Francisco State, Berkeley, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Cornell, where armed black students occupy university buildings; women stage a protest at the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City; demonstrations against President Lyndon B. Johnson’s escalation of the war in Vietnam lead to mayhem and a “police riot” at the Chicago Democratic Convention. The year 1968 also functioned as an unoﬃcial “end of innocence” for European art cinema. The vibrant burst of aesthetic experimentation epitomized in the early 1960s by this cinema was inﬂuential in terms of other nations’ ﬁlm practices, especially in America in the\n\n18 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nlatter half of that decade and into the 1970s in the form of the New Hollywood cinema.44 But while it enjoyed throughout this period some notable successes internationally, European art cinema can be seen in retrospect to have been marking time—particularly in terms of U.S. exhibition where, from the establishment of the Code and Rating Administration system in 1968, it would proceed into irreversible decline.45 As well, ﬁlm culture more generally became politicized; in France, the Langlois Aﬀair in February and the forced closure of the Cannes Film Festival by ﬁlmmakers and jury members in May are two examples. Additionally, artists, journalists, and ﬁlm/television/radio workers were particularly sympathetic with the students’ protests and their violent treatment at the hands of the riot police. They organized the Estates Générale du Cinéma to discuss the role of ﬁlmmakers, technicians, and critics as well as screenings at factories and sit-ins and documentation of the protests.46 The failure of the events of May ’68 to eﬀect lasting change in the ruling party’s dominance over all aspects of public and private life did not dull the import of these concerns. Rather, it produced an intellectual milieu that increasingly called for the need for political intervention on the theoretical as well as the practical/activist fronts. It is important to place Anglo-American academic ﬁlm studies within this nexus of historical forces. For despite some obvious differences that would develop between the newly formed ﬁlm cultural and academic sectors—manifested, for example, in the levels of specialization in the critical languages common to each, as well as in the size and thickness of their journals and the circulations of their readerships—both are nonetheless bound to a common period of formation and continue to share a number of traits as regards cinematic taste, value, and community. Importantly, 1968 also demarcates the point from which academic ﬁlm studies, still only in its formative stages, began to grapple with “the political” in its own way.47 In this sense, the 1960s was the time for both academic ﬁlm studies’ formation and its ﬁrst great “break.” European art cinema was to suﬀer in this, as it came to be regarded by a burgeoning, politicized academic ﬁlm studies from 1968 on as a compromised form of cultural production, one whose ﬁguration of the individual’s relation to modern society— particularly the alienated, bourgeois individual—had been called into question by the collective social and political events of the late 1960s.\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 19\n\nA second outcome of this break was a scholarly division that still resonates as a not incommensurable yet lingering schism between ﬁlm theory and ﬁlm history. The political upheavals of the late 1960s precipitated a reevaluation on the part of many intellectuals of their assumptions, priorities, and practices. For example, throughout the 1950s and 1960s editorial policy at Cahiers du cinéma was marked by a commitment to auteur and mise-en-scène criticism that manifested itself in an almost unqualiﬁed celebration of Italian neorealism, the French New Wave, and American cinema.48 Concomitant with this policy was distaste for (and often outright rejection of ) explicitly partisan ﬁlms and ﬁlmmakers: cinema was decidedly the realm of “the individual,”“beauty,”“sensitivity,”“morality”—not politics. Statements of militancy fell well within the boundaries of a liberal humanism tempered with existentialism.49 A change in editorial policy at Cahiers in summer 1968, and a year later the publication of Jean Narboni and Jean-Louis Comolli’s editorial drafted for the October–November 1969 issue titled “Cinéma/idéologie/critique,” sealed Cahiers’ commitment to political criticism and initiated a crisis within the magazine that led to a change in its ownership.50 Cahiers’ abandonment of its former evaluative approach in favor of analysis of cinema’s role in the perpetuation of the social formation called for a more rigorously theoretical examination of how cinema functioned ideologically, how meaning was produced, and how it addressed the spectator.51 A similar shift in 1971 in the editorial policy of Screen—initially an organ of the British Film Institute’s educational initiatives—as well as the inauguration in and around the 1970s of journals like Cinéthique in France, Afterimage and Framework in Britain, Jump Cut and Camera Obscura in the United States, and Ciné-Tracts in Canada, launched and sustained an intellectual program for the nascent discipline of academic ﬁlm studies.52 It was a program that combined in exciting and often untenable ways a variety of structuralist and later poststructuralist discourses. It was also a program that made the terms “political” and “theoretical” synonymous, at least for those writing and making ﬁlms within the main currents of its concerns. The pages of these journals promoted subsequent developments in ﬁlm theory: neo-Marxism and semiotics, psychoanalysis and feminism, queer theory and postcolonial and cultural studies. It is through these terms and discourses that most\n\n20 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nscholars would recognize the main political trajectory of post-1968 Anglo-American ﬁlm studies through the late 1980s. This trajectory has not been matched by a corollary one for ﬁlm history, particularly as far as art cinema is concerned. Unlike ﬁlm theory, which can claim a legacy dating at least to the 1910s, ﬁlm history as a distinct ﬁeld of inquiry appeared much later. Before the institutionalization of academic ﬁlm studies in Britain and America, ﬁlm history was written by archivists, independent scholars, and buﬀs. Film theory too was largely the province of artists, independent scholars, and buﬀs throughout the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, but it went through a much more visible process of academic development before 1968 and politicization quickly afterward. As a result of the break of 1968, art cinema was left largely to critics and historians to concern themselves about.53 And while the discourses one might group under ﬁlm theory are of a wide variety and span a number of disciplines, the approaches to ﬁlm historical writing have remained remarkably few. Robert C. Allen and Douglas Gomery described in 1985 four historiographic categories—aesthetic, technological, economic, and social—to which we can now add institutional, exhibition, and reception.54 Of these, however, the aesthetic and the social dominate the historiography of European art cinema, which engages largely with the history of its object’s formal experiments and innovations and noteworthy exemplars (ﬁlms and directors) within the contexts of speciﬁc national cinemas. One of the root causes for the relative lack of theoretical interest in European art cinema—whether deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, postcolonialism, queer theory, or cognitivism—was due to its designation as modernist, and modernist of a certain strain. A determining critical mechanism for this designation derives from a tendency to distinguish two strands of modern and modernist cinema. In the case of the French New Wave, these strands are articulated as two waves: the New Wave proper of 1958–62 and a second wave in 1966–68. According to this sequencing, the ﬁrst wave is modernist and apolitical, the second militant and political. Susan Hayward, for example, considers a myth “the belief that because this cinema was controversial or diﬀerent in style it was also radical and political cinema. This is predominantly not true: the New Wave ﬁlm-makers were largely non-politicized.”55 Such a bipartition rests then on a general\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 21\n\nconsensus about what a “political” ﬁlm is, based on either the politics of its maker or the historical context in which it is embedded. Thus the ﬁrst New Wave coincides with a growing youth culture, the rise of the jeune cadre, modernization, unprecedented industrial growth, economic prosperity and consumer power, the reformation of national institutions through the advent of the Fifth Republic and its new constitution, and decolonization. (The only way to regard this period as “non-political,” however, is to ignore the last two items in this series and consign the ﬁrst four to cultural or economic spheres.) The second New Wave, on the other hand, corresponds with “the progressive disenchantment with [Charles] de Gaulle’s authoritarian presidential style, unrest on social and educational levels due to a lack of resources to accommodate the expanding urban society and student university numbers, workers’ concern at their conditions, and lastly concern with the rise in unemployment, all of which culminated in the events of May 1968.”56 In other words, the latter half of the 1960s was in France a more properly “political” time in the nation’s history. The force of politics in the late 1960s has underscored academic ﬁlm studies in ways no less telling than, and in many ways parallel to, its eﬀects on cultural life in general. The politicization of ﬁlm culture in the wake of 1968 is conceded to have been short-lived and of limited success in altering the dominant modes of ﬁlm production and reception. But by taking on the econopolitical bases of cinematic production as it did, by splintering modern cinema into two diﬀerent camps, it threw into theoretical disfavor European art cinema. For ﬁlm studies, it was precisely a conception of “the political” that placed two categories or branches of the ﬁeld at odds with one another: theory versus history. The call for countercinematic practices by proponents of the former in the pages of Cahiers du cinéma, Cinéthique, and Positif in 1969 and Screen, Jump Cut, Camera Obscura, and others in the 1970s should not be underestimated as a generative factor in the decline of European art cinema in this period. The cinematic movements that grew out of the political foment of the late 1960s in Western and Eastern Central Europe, in Asia, and in Cuba and Latin America more readily provided examples of ﬁlmmakers who represented, both for the ﬁlm culture of the 1970s and the burgeoning discipline of ﬁlm studies alike, a certain type of politically committed\n\n22 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nand engaged auteur preferable to those who merely made art ﬁlms.57 Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, JeanMarie Straub and Danièle Huillet, Alexander Kluge, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Miklós Jancsó, Dušan Makavejev, Nagisa Oshima, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Glauber Rocha—these ﬁlmmakers collectively practiced a form of political cinema that contested and went beyond the domesticated modernism of art cinema, drawing instead from a political avant-garde tradition of aesthetics including dialecticism, distantiation, and unpleasure.58 They were, in the parlance of the period, good object choices. Rather than a simple bipartite division between cinema as art or as popular entertainment, political discourse led academic ﬁlm studies to make more ﬁnite distinctions, though terminology proved confusing. The avant-garde, modernism, militant cinema, countercinema, and political modernism all were deployed at various (and often overlapping) times to describe the preferred political course for ﬁlm practice and, in the latter two cases, ﬁlm theory. Published in 1975, Peter Wollen’s “The Two Avant-Gardes” drew a distinction between two currents of contemporary ﬁlm practice, one merely aesthetic and the other political/radical, both developing from two strands of modernism of the 1920s.59 A further elaboration of this position by Paul Willemen distinguished between modernism and the avant-garde, aligning the former with aestheticism and the latter with political engagement.60 A decade after Wollen, in the ﬁnal chapter of The Classical Hollywood Cinema, David Bordwell and Janet Staiger posited that, in relation to their title subject’s style/mode of production,“only a few other general modes of ﬁlm practice have existed. Three signiﬁcant ones would be ‘art cinema,’ the avant-garde cinema, and the ‘modernist’ cinema”; for the authors, none of these was de facto political.61 In the same year Bordwell elaborated on these modes in his Narration in the Fiction Film, though here the modernist mode is confusingly called “parametric” and a special note is added about “the problem of modernism.”62 Finally, D. N. Rodowick, following Sylvia Harvey, deployed the term “political modernism” to describe a “speciﬁc formation of theoretical discourse” that aligned with the practices Wollen considered one type of avant-garde and Willemen modernism tout court.63 Another consensus was reached without altercation: classical cinema meant Hollywood cinema. Film theory thus concentrated on two\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 23\n\nforms of textual analysis, and for similar political ends: “against the grain” readings of mainstream cinema as epitomized by classical Hollywood, either to demythologize, using Marxist, psychoanalytic, and/or feminist frameworks, its hegemonic workings or to tease out potentially progressive genres (melodrama, ﬁlm noir, the B ﬁlm, the horror ﬁlm) and occasionally auteurs (Dorothy Arzner and Douglas Sirk, preeminently); and “with the grain” readings (though never termed as such) of more identiﬁably progressive ﬁlms, especially those deriving from independent and counterhegemonic practices such as countercinema, Third Cinema, and the feminist avant-garde. These latter practices further splintered from the 1980s through the work of a range of gay, lesbian, postcolonial, diasporic, exilic, and accented ﬁlmmakers, now encompassed broadly by the term “postmodern” and including the likes of Derek Jarman, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Isaac Julien, Julie Dash, and Atom Egoyan. “Political” thus expanded to take in the politics of diﬀerence and identity as enacted by postmodern ﬁlm and video practices.64 Through all this, art cinema remained aligned with the high arts and relegated wholly to the aesthetic—and so of little theoretical concern.65 It occupied a middle ground between popular American cinema (democratic) and the independent avant-garde (progressive), an oﬃcial, bourgeois cultural position. Steve Neale notes that art cinema in this period “was often deﬁned as the ‘enemy’: as a bastion of ‘high art’ ideologies, as the kind of cinema supported by Sight and Sound and the critical establishment, therefore, as the kind of cinema to be fought. To parody the debate somewhat, it was a question of Siegel, Fuller, Hitchcock, Hawks and Corman versus Antonioni, Bergman and Fellini, of genre versus personal expression, of (in some extreme cases) trash versus taste, hysteria versus restraint, energy versus decorum and quality.”66 And John Caughie has recalled: “The ﬁlms of Godard and Straub-Huillet provided the stick with which to beat bourgeois realism, and the ﬁlms of Duras and Chantal Akerman began to open up the question of a feminine discourse in cinema. The rest was silence: classiﬁed as European ‘art cinema’ in which the word ‘art’ couldn’t be spoken without an involuntary curl of the lips.”67 European art cinema was thus from almost the start of Anglo-American academic ﬁlm studies deemed outmoded and elitist, with Bergman, Truﬀaut, and others of their ilk reviled by a politicized ﬁlm culture located\n\n24 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nin the left wing of the academy in America and soon to be so in Britain.68 Poststructuralist and postmodern theorists labeled European art cinema irredeemably modernist, with consequently appropriate reading strategies: nonpoliticized, humanist, formal/aesthetic ones for the modernist cinemas of the French New Wave and the new Italian cinema; politicized, antihumanist, ideological ones for the militant cinemas of the late 1960s and beyond. This was no radical break from the past. David Forgacs has traced left political antipathy to modernism to 1940s Italy as a consequence of the Communist Party’s support for the discourse of realism: “Modernist works are only valued positively when they can be interpreted in a realist or a socially committed key: the work of avant-garde artists belonging to or aligned with the Left, for instance Aragon or Picasso, is interpreted and defended in this way. Otherwise Modernist works are consigned to cultural waste-paper baskets variously labelled ‘formalist’,‘decadent’,‘abstract’, ‘irrational’,‘sterile’,‘snobbish’ and ‘bourgeois’.”69 Remarkably, these critical protocols have changed very little. A great deal of this has to do with a continuing designation of European art cinema of the late 1950s through the 1960s as modernist in the wake of theories of the postmodern. But the issue of terminology is actually a sticky one when one considers the cinema’s place among other arts and cultural discourses. Fredric Jameson, for example, famously identiﬁed the three fundamental stages in secular bourgeois or capitalist culture as realism, modernism, and postmodernism, each of which accords with Ernest Mandel’s (after Marx’s) three historical stages of capital: classical or market capitalism; monopoly capitalism, or what Lenin called “the age of imperialism”; and late capitalism.70 For Jameson, the conﬂuence of the last term/stage—postmodernism/ late capitalism—is crucial as a means for designating a new social positioning of art within a new multinational organization of capital.71 The chronological mappings of aesthetic forms according to these stages of development have for the most part proceeded through hindsight, with the emergence of the postmodern determining the end of modernism and so on. But these mappings have produced a highly contradictory array of historical periodizations. The philosopher of history Arnold Toynbee ﬁrst used the term postmodernism in the late 1940s to refer, negatively, to an age that begins in the late nineteenth century in the second stage of capital. It was not until the late 1970s, with the\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 25\n\npublication of Charles Jencks’s The Language of Post-Modern Architecture and Jean-François Lyotard’s La Condition postmoderne, that the territorial lines really began to be drawn.72 Scholars of English literature coalesced around the year 1939 as heralding the “birth” of postmodern literature, using the outbreak of World War II and the publication of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake as markers. American literary critics and writers decided to set the advent of postmodernism in the postwar period. The visual arts community has more or less settled on the transition from the Abstract Expressionism of the New York School to Pop around 1960. And from a Habermasian perspective the rise of postmodernism would have to be associated with the emergence of numerous poststructuralist writings in the late sixties.73 And ﬁlm? On the one hand, most of its history coincides at one level or another with modernism in the other arts. On the other hand, the cinema is a product of sophisticated forms of cultural production, impossible to understand outside of the development of the latest stage of capitalism, and one may be tempted to proclaim it as always already postmodern and leave it at that. Few have made either of these moves, however, and the historiography of the medium has, following an art history model, produced a set of periodizations that look roughly as follows: pre- and early cinema (1880s–1914), silent cinema (1913– 1929), classical sound cinema (1927–1955), modern cinema (1955– 1975), and contemporary or postmodern cinema (1975–present). The more elegant tripartite periodization of cinema history into silent cinema (1895–1930), classical sound cinema (1930–60), and modern cinema (1960–present) would seem to carry with it the beneﬁt of coinciding with Jameson’s three stages, but the coincidence is a false one.74 According to Colin MacCabe,“One has to reckon with the historical paradox that this post-modern medium recapitulates the basic realism/modernism/post-modernism aesthetic development, with the classic Hollywood cinema representing realism . . . , the European cinema of the 50s and 60s reliving all the paradoxes of modernism . . . and a fully post-modern cinema having to wait until the early 70s.”75 In the accepted idiom of Jameson’s three-stage socioeconomic-aesthetic development, ﬁlm “signally fails to coincide with any of the rhythms or coordinates of development in the other arts or media.”76 Much of the confusion that surrounds eﬀorts to map the concept is due to a conﬂation of postmodernism as an epoch, involving a shift\n\n26 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nof societal and economic paradigms, and postmodernism as a period style in the arts visibly and/or aurally distinct from modernism. This is nowhere more evident than in Susan Hayward’s periodizing of French cinema according to the three stages of Mandelian/Jamesonian development so that silent French cinema, “the classical age,” is realist, sound cinema from 1930 to the French New Wave is “the age of modernism,” and 1958 to the present is French cinema’s “age of the postmodern.” Her alignment of the New Wave with postmodernism relies on a privileging of historical time over aesthetic transformation: The postmodern does not . . . refer to a style; rather, it refers to a periodising concept “whose function is to correlate the emergence of new formal features in culture with the emergence of a new type of social life and a new economic order”. . . . In other words, it is a conjunctural term at the interface between artefact and the new moment of capitalism. In the case of France this moment dates from the birth of the Fifth Republic, again justifying the nomenclature for this age of cinema as postmodern.77\n\nBut how can this square up with the long-standing consensus that the ﬁlms of the New Wave—with the exception perhaps of Truﬀaut’s Tirez sur le pianiste (Shoot the Piano Player, 1960) and of those Godard ﬁlms that playfully incorporate references across a range of high and low culture—conform to the high seriousness and self-referential formal tendencies of modernism in general and of other European art ﬁlms of this period in particular? The issue of whether the French New Wave (and, by extension, the European art cinemas of the same era) is postmodern or modern is more than simply a terminological quibble. It carves out a space for how one should read this cinema, how one should understand its relation to the history of the medium and to the cultures of its time. D. N. Rodowick has observed how the protagonists of New Wave ﬁlms . . . deﬁne a nomadism where the characters of the time-image wander errantly and observe in emptied and disconnected spaces; linear actions dissolve into aleatory strolls that organize elliptical narratives guided predominantly by chance. . . . In so doing they represent a kind of postmodern historical subjectivity—the faltering belief in totality, either from the point of view of the great organic ideologies or from a belief in the image as anything other than a partial and contingent description of reality.78\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 27\n\nI would extend this observation to contend that, although the characters may indeed “represent a kind of postmodern historical subjectivity,” their place and function within the narratives of these ﬁlms are nevertheless to register the loss of a certain totality and to secure the boundaries of a new kind of totality in which they might ﬁnd a space to circulate. In this respect, one could say that the European art cinemas of the late 1950s and early 1960s are not postmodern but a form of modernism that populates its formal aspirations, which accord with those of modernism in its high phase, with proto-postmodern subjects who do not fully embrace the new because they are incapable of making the successful transition. A reconsideration of European art cinema in relation to the discursive formations of modernism and postmodernism complicates our understanding of the ways in which it responded to the social, economic, industrial, and political shifts that provided the context for its emergence. Indeed, these shifts may be seen as the generative mechanisms for that emergence. The nomadism of the characters that Rodowick identiﬁes is one example, especially in terms of their gendering in this cinema. The trope of the modern wandering woman or female ﬂâneur in art cinema foregrounds the uncomfortable position she occupies vis-à-vis private and public space, narrative and spectacle, director and performer, subject and object—and modernism and postmodernism. In the classical accounts of ﬂanerie provided by Walter Benjamin through the writings of Baudelaire, the ﬂâneur’s existence was built upon a sustained disavowal of a social, utilitarian ordering of space, favoring instead a self-deﬁned, self-centered aesthetic spacing. Indeed, Benjamin’s description of the petit bourgeoisie as the privileged class of the ﬂâneur circa 1859 could just as easily stand as a description of the ﬁlmmakers of European art cinema circa 1959: “Inevitably, one day many of its members had to become aware of the commodity nature of their labour power. But this day had not as yet come; until that day they were permitted, if one may put it that way, to pass their time. The very fact that their share could at best be enjoyment, but never power, made the period which history gave them a space for passing time.”79 This is the high modernist sensibility in a nutshell: a retreat from the complexity, indeed unrepresentability, of social relations in modernity into the aesthetic. Both the ﬂâneur’s existence in the labyrinthine, disorienting, turbulent space of the modern city\n\n28 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nand Benjamin’s assessment of it is riven through with a melancholic nostalgia for a lost world. Is this not also the age of cinephilia that Sontag so fondly, so wistfully recalled? Mapping the Subject Given the complex interplay among the political, industrial, intellectual, and institutional forces that coalesced around and have extended beyond 1968, it is imperative to examine how ﬁlm culture, academic ﬁlm studies, ﬁlm theory, and ﬁlm history are mutually implicated in the discourses of European art cinema. For even though most contemporary accounts of aesthetic, historical, and political development would agree that we are now, and have been for some time, in the age of the postmodern, the ideologies of modernism, of which European art cinema is so much a part, continue to underscore the disciplinary practices of ﬁlm studies leveled at this mode of ﬁlm practice. In fact, analyzing European art cinema as part of a cultural and historical milieu that gave rise to postmodernism reveals that its modernism is not so much an aesthetic phase or an epoch that has now been exhausted as it is a set of historical and theoretical reading protocols that have held art cinema in a holding pattern for Anglo-American ﬁlm studies. In this respect, ostensibly outmoded concepts like the auteur, nationalism, Eurocentrism, art versus commerce, high versus low culture, and modernism and the modern continue to manifest themselves in disciplinary thought and practice with respect to this particular object. In this book I will be mapping the practices and paradigms of ﬁlm history and of ﬁlm studies alongside postwar European art cinema to propose remappings that are at the same time institutional and geopolitical. The cinemas of the French New Wave and the new Italian cinema of the late 1950s through the late 1960s are central to this analysis for a number of reasons. The countries are comparable in size and population and share similar economic, social, and political developments in the decade before, during, and after the period in focus. Italian and French ﬁlm culture played key roles in establishing the discourses of European art cinema internationally through respective national ﬁlm movements (Italian neorealism, the French New Wave, the new Italian cinema), specialized journals, high-proﬁle ﬁlm festivals\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 29\n\n(Venice and Cannes, the ﬁrst two to be instituted), and a proportionately high number of directors and ﬁlms constituting a large percentage of the art cinema pantheon and canon. There is considerable overlap among the ﬁlm cultures and ﬁlm industries of France and Italy in this period as well, in terms of both the sizes of their respective native audiences and their frequent coproduction of ﬁlms. The French New Wave and the new Italian cinema thus concentrate a historical period, an accepted body of important ﬁgures and texts, a set of cultural discourses, and an economic/industrial/institutional infrastructure that are imbricated on a number of levels. In “Re-Framing the Fingerprints: A Short Survey of European Film,” Wendy Everett groups European cinema into three main categories: the long-established industries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain; smaller national cinemas such as Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Switzerland; and the Scandinavian countries—Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. (Interestingly, the cinemas of Eastern Central Europe are not grouped but considered as separate cases.)80 Everett’s ﬁrst category includes France and Italy, and I should explain further why I am focusing on these two nations and not the others in the group. Britain has historically shared closer ties and allegiances with America than with its continental neighbors in both general and cinema-speciﬁc terms, the latter at the levels of language and production ﬁnance especially: during the 1960s, the focus of this study, American ﬁnancial investment in British production reached unprecedented levels, peaking at 90 percent in 1967.81 Britain’s postwar economic growth rate through the 1960s was also far behind that of France, Italy, and other Western European countries.82 Apart from coproduction agreements, the ﬁlm cultures of Spain and West Germany existed in relative isolation from those of other Western European nations, neither of them enjoying international success on the art house exhibition or ﬁlm festival circuits anything like France and Italy did between 1945 and 1975, when they dominated all others. It was not until the 1970s that ﬁlm culture in West Germany and Spain became recognized internationally within the context of art cinema discourse. The West German case, however, requires further comments. On the econopolitical front, West Germany was an original member of the European Economic Community, one of “the Six” who signed\n\n30 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nthe Treaty of Rome in early 1958, the others being France, Italy, and Benelux. But West Germany’s postwar economic development was inextricable from its immediate division into occupation zones and later Cold War partitions in a way that was not the case for Italy or France. On the cinematic front, the New German cinema of the late 1960s through late 1970s is often grouped with other new wave cinemas in Europe and as such is considered a continuing manifestation of European art cinema. But in fact its status in this regard is very different from that of its predecessors in important ways, especially as concerns production and reception. The ﬁnancial structure of the New German cinema was dependent on television funding to an extremely high degree, one not shared by France or Italy (or any other European country) in the 1960s. In fact, television funding in these nations in the 1970s is a conspicuous reason for the decline in coproductions, a key feature of European art cinema in my estimation.83 As for reception, many of the directors of the New German cinema were embraced by academic ﬁlm studies as fulﬁlling countercinema requirements in a way that the art ﬁlm directors of Italy and France (Pasolini and Godard excepted) were not. As Thomas Elsaesser describes,“Compared to other European New Waves, it was striking how many militant platforms but also how many committees the directors felt obliged to sit on, and how few admitted to a simple passion for cinema. . . . They had to be spokespersons on social issues, since the new cinema rarely ﬁlled the cinemas; but it found compensation by occupying a public sphere, where it stood for solidarity, the class struggle, and sexual emancipation, rather than for mise-en-scène, deep focus, the long take, or montage.”84 At both the industrial and discursive levels, New German cinema is of a diﬀerent order and era than European art cinema as I am examining it here. The rest of this book is organized in three chapters, each of which addresses matters of ﬁlm form or representation that have been previously marked in ﬁlm scholarship as peripheral to postwar French and Italian art cinema. Throughout I will be arguing the converse: that the issues at stake are central to the discourse of art cinema, and that their repression in ﬁlm historical writing is due to a preferred form of analysis that has considered as extratextual what are in fact deeply structuring historical and political tensions of the period that everywhere leave their textual traces. In the case of coproductions,\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 31\n\ninternational casting, and the polyglot sound track of French and Italian art ﬁlms, the trace is both the unsynced speech of the international performers who have been dubbed and the subtitles at the bottom of the screen that anchor to individual national cinemas what are in fact trans-European cooperative eﬀorts. The nomadic female protagonist of art cinema is another trace as well, though of a diﬀerent sort of geopolitical realignment Europe was undergoing at the time: the economic and cultural modernizations of the postwar boom alongside colonial war, decolonization, and loss of Empire. Finally, the omnibus ﬁlm is a trace too, both within the history of art cinema and of an even broader institution: the protocols of ﬁlm historical writing, which derive from the structuring paradigms of academic ﬁlm studies and construct a horizon of intelligibility for historicizing not only the omnibus ﬁlm but also European art cinema as a whole. In examining these peripheries I endeavor to draw attention to their unstable centers. In my second chapter, “The Name above the Subtitle: Language, Coproduction, Transnationalism,” I foreground the ﬁlmed body in art cinema as a locus for crisis and contestation. Here I argue that ﬁlm sound, particularly the embodied voice/body of the actor, functions within European art cinema in complex and contradictory ways.Writing on ﬁlm sound has tended toward three analytical approaches: the technological/historical (scholarship on the late 1920s transition to sound, for example); the aesthetic/formalist (which focuses on either ﬁlm music or the particular uses of sound by directors, cultures, et cetera); and the theoretical/ideological (suture, the cinematic apparatus, the gendered voice, et cetera).85 What has not received much attention is the matter of language translation/transformation in the production, distribution, and exhibition of art ﬁlms made in one language community and exported or imported into another—in other words, the issue of subtitling and dubbing in its economic/institutional and theoretical dimensions.86 A focus for ﬁerce debate in the United States in the 1960s, when ﬁlm art was synonymous with European art cinema, dubbing and subtitling have been integral features of the national and transnational ﬁlm industries of Europe since the introduction of sound to the cinema. They are also fascinating sites of inquiry for any study of modern European cinema, tied as they are to the political, economic, and ideological dimensions of that cinema,\n\n32 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\ndimensions that remain largely unexplored in Anglo-American academic ﬁlm studies given the aesthetic purview of so much of the historiography of European art cinema. What are the political and economic bases of the international art ﬁlm? How do institutional developments within Europe aimed at economic and political cooperation and integration align with concepts like the nation and national identity in the 1960s and after? How does the history of coproduction agreements and mandates between and among European nations impinge on the reception of European art ﬁlms with their transnational casts and crews? There is much at stake in these questions; I focus on the ideologies surrounding the subtitling and/or dubbing of Italian and French cinema of the late 1950s through the early 1970s. During this period the stability of the concept of nation generally, and that of Italy and France speciﬁcally, was placed in crisis by modernization and neocapitalism on the one hand and an increasingly integrating Europe on the other. The voice/ celebrity (of the actor, but also of the director) emerges in the coproduced European art ﬁlm as a means toward imaginary nation building. The ﬁlm actor, whose language and country of origin combine with her or his star power to determine the voice in which she or he speaks, is a register of and means for conﬂicted constructions of national identity in a new and developing Europe, constructions that the identity of the auteur shores up. Following the 1993 Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade (GATT), during which ﬁlm and audiovisual material were excluded from its terms, there has been a burst of scholarship on the economic and industrial intersections between European cinema and Hollywood. Much of this writing proceeds from European anxieties concerning American domination and fears about the disappearance of distinct national cultures as an eﬀect of globalization. Certainly, the prominence of international coproductions and of the adoption of English as the lingua franca of global cinema in the 1990s has increased awareness of recent strategies taken by national cinema industries in the European Union. But such strategies are by no means a recent phenomenon. Indeed, they have been employed, in varying degrees, throughout the history of European sound cinema. Anxieties about the autonomy of the nation and national cultures in the face of the American threat and of Europeanization are well documented\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 33\n\nin the histories of the pan-European initiatives of the “Film Europe” movement in the 1920s and the spate of studio “multiple language versions” in Europe in the early 1930s. But such tensions and anxieties are also evident as traces in the heavily coproduced Italian and French art cinemas of the 1950s and 1960s, a period that, not coincidentally, witnessed the growth of the European Economic Community among other cultural and economic partnerships. While economic/institutional histories of Hollywood cinema are common in Anglo-American academic ﬁlm studies, only recently has this approach been taken for European or transnational cinemas. This scholarship either centers on contemporary international coproductions and cinemas or describes the economic and cultural encroachment of American ﬁlm interests in Europe. I am interested in this chapter in placing European art cinema squarely within this network, not only to suggest the importance of an economic and industrial analysis of it but also to question the nationalist emphasis of art cinema scholarship. I consider the establishment and support of various national new waves circa 1958–68 as nation-building responses at the cultural level to transnational cooperation and European uniﬁcation at the economic and industrial levels. For the casts, the production, and the distribution of the canonical postwar French and Italian cinema are prominently transnational, and as such may be read in terms of discourses concerning national authenticity during the ﬁrst years of the European Economic Community. The late 1950s marked a crucial point for European ﬁlm production: it was during these years that the major European ﬁlm-producing nations (France, Italy, Britain, Spain, West Germany) turned increasingly to coproduction agreements with themselves and other nations as a necessary economic strategy. These agreements carried with them detailed and speciﬁc requirements regarding ﬁlm locations, the nationalities of prominent members of the cast and crew, and the necessary ﬁnancial commitments nations needed to make to qualify for national subsidies. Such requirements bespeak the extent to which the concept of nationhood is a consistent and explicit concern in the economic history of postwar European ﬁlm production, a concern that conﬂicted with simultaneous pan-European strategies. The textual terrain upon which this conﬂict was staged is the actor’s body in (or out of ) sync with her or his voice. By mapping this terrain, I wish to exert pressure\n\n34 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\non the national cinemas model for the historical writing of European art cinema. “Wandering Women: Decolonization, Modernity, Recolonization” is the title of my third chapter. There is within Anglo-American ﬁlm studies a strong operational tendency to read postwar European art cinema as “modern” and “alienated” rather than as “engaged” and “motivated.” One of the means for this operation is to separate and explain the historical and ideological undercurrents of the various new waves of the 1960s according to a conception of a divided, Cold War Europe. Such a separation produces constitutively diﬀerent forms of historical analysis. The history of numerous Eastern Central European new waves is thus grounded in the historical and political context of the Soviet bloc: the ideological thaw following the death of Stalin provides a space for freer ﬁlmic practices that critique the totalitarianism of the Communist Party. Western European new waves, on the other hand, are considered according to a diﬀerent set of criteria. Here,“new” refers to philosophical questions and aesthetic innovations that have less to do with politics or ideology than with the aesthetics of ﬁlmic style and meaning. The jump cut, the long take, intertextual referencing, and other narrative destructions are thus characteristic of the broader intellectual and philosophical (as opposed to political) concerns of Western European culture, ranging from moral decadence (Buñuel, Visconti) to metaphysical doubt (Bresson, Bergman) to existential questioning (Resnais, Antonioni) to technological dehumanization (Tati, Godard) to humanist understanding (Fellini, Truﬀaut). Against these retrograde modernist sensibilities are often held progressive postmodern ones. Appropriation, misappropriation, collage, heterogeneity, hybridization, a mixing up of visual and verbal texts and discourses—postmodern style plays freely with these, and with little of the nostalgia or angst that characterizes modernism. The linking of postmodern thought and practice to the discourses of feminism— which Craig Owens presented in 1983 as an intersection between the “feminist critique of patriarchy and the postmodernist critique of representation”—adds another comparative level: modernism as an expression of an exhausted culture steeped in nostalgia for not only a lost center but also the logic of a patriarchal system that, with the rise of feminist movements since the late nineteenth century, has ever since scrambled to maintain its own grand narrative.87 If one of the\n\nRecovering European Art Cinema | 35\n\nfew widely agreed-upon features of postmodernism is its attempt to negotiate high art with the forms of mass culture and the culture of everyday life, European art cinema, with its elevation of the ﬁlm director to artist status, can certainly be seen as a similar eﬀort on the part of the nations of Europe to quell the tide of the massive inﬂux of American mass culture and commodities. But how are we to consider female representation in this period and this cultural form? A primary object of address and fascination for European modernization and commodity culture, the modern woman is also a primary subject of art cinema. Might the political eﬀects or meanings of this ﬁgure be read in terms not of this cinema’s immanence—its modernism—but through a postmodern interpretive framework? In other words, the contradictory female representations in modern cinema may be understood as signifying aesthetic, spatial, and national-historical crises particular to Western Europe. In the contemporary discourses of European art cinema there is a notable critical line on the matter of women. They are treated as positive agents of their own desire, central to the narrative, a liberated image of modern European womanhood. They are also insular, isolated, alienated beings, out of touch with the social world around them, unable to communicate freely or fully with men, unlikely to achieve happiness by narrative’s end. In short, they are like the ﬁlms for which they iconically stand: representative not of the broader culture but of themselves, singular subjects in the same way that modern ﬁlms are singular objets d’art. For example, the British critic Penelope Houston would state in 1963 that “Hiroshima mon Amour is not about peace or the Bomb, as much it is about a woman trying to live with her past. . . . À Bout de Souﬄe [sic] is not about crime, but about JeanPaul Belmondo and Jean Seberg; La Notte is not a tract on modern marriage.”88 In the same year, the American critic Andrew Sarris wrote,“Monica Vitti is an intellectual actress, the visible ﬂowering of what has come to be known as the modern cinema. As Greta Garbo and Emmanuelle Riva have been the pin-up girls of the soul, and Marlene Dietrich and Jeanne Moreau the pin-up girls of the senses, perhaps Monica Vitti will go down in ﬁlm history as the ﬁrst pin-up girl of the intellect.”89 The tone of such pronouncements was largely set by Cahiers du cinéma, which from the beginning of the New Wave demonstrated a\n\n36 | Recovering European Art Cinema\n\nstake in modern French cinema that was inseparable from a notion of the modern woman. The Cahiers roundtable discussion on Hiroshima mon amour, published in summer 1959, is notable for its participants’ fascination with “adult women in the cinema” and for the connections they make between the work of Simone de Beauvoir—whose critique of the formidable dilemmas facing independent and professional women in a postwar male-dominated world, The Second Sex, had been published a decade earlier—and the modern cinema of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni.90 With all credit for Hiroshima mon amour going to the male director and none to the female screenwriter or performer, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze declares that “Emmanuelle Riva is a modern adult woman because she is not an adult woman. Quite the contrary, she is very childish, motivated solely by her impulses and not by her ideas. Antonioni was the ﬁrst to show us this kind of woman.” Jacques Rivette sees her as “a woman who is starting all over again, going right back to the beginning, trying to deﬁne herself in existential terms before the world and before her past, as if she were once more unformed matter in the process of being born.” And Jean-Luc Godard and Jean Domarchi pronounce Hiroshima mon amour to be “Simone de Beauvoir that works” and “a documentary on Emmanuelle Riva,” respectively.91 For these critics, as for the British and American ones over whom they exerted inﬂuence, the portrayals of modern women by Riva, Moreau, and Vitti are vital signs of the arrival of a modern cinema whose creation is attributable not to their abilities as performers nor to a general societal trend but to the vision of the male auteurs these critics champion and in some cases would become. For many ﬁlm historians, the seeds of this mod"
