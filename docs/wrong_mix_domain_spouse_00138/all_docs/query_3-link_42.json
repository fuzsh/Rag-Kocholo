Evisu presented a microcosm just for you. The Donna Evisu Store was conveniently located just a 3-minute walk from the tower along Gaien Nishi Dori in Hiro, Tokyo. This minimalist store by the overpass was a must-visit for all fashion-forward women!\n\nEVISU initially designed their clothing for men, but at the start of 1999, they introduced a line called DONNA tailored specifically for women. This new line takes into account the differences in the female body, ensuring a better fit. Women who previously struggled to find clothes from EVISU that suited them could now rejoice. Cheers to DONNA for providing a solution for ladies worldwide!\n\nThis special magazine from EVISU Style Magazine features a preview of the Donna Evisu store and its origins. It all began with the manager, Yanaginuma, who single-handedly ran the place. He observed that there were wives and grandmothers in the neighborhood expressing, “I’ve never worn jeans before, but I’ve always wanted to wear them.” His relentless research focused on making the unique look and feel of Evisu jeans more fashionable and wearable for girls!\n\nHardworking, cutesy, and talkative. With Ms. Yanaginuma’s store as a base, the couple strolled around the Hiro and Minami-Azabu areas, where women of modest means gather. This is the origin story of how Evisu’s Donna subsidiary line came into existence.\n\nThe Donna Evisu store was located on 5-1-36 Minami-Azabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.\".",
