        "text": "Simultaneous Presentation of Giant Cell Arteritis and Myelodysplastic Syndrome in an Elderly Japanese Man.\n\nPubMed\n\nSenjo, Hajime; Higuchi, Takakazu; Morimoto, Masaya; Koyamada, Ryosuke; Yanaoka, Chisun; Okada, Sadamu\n\n2018-05-18\n\nAn 81-year-old Japanese man presented with constitutional symptoms and anemia and was diagnosed with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) simultaneously. His symptoms and anemia improved promptly with steroids; however, the MDS rapidly progressed to overt leukemia. While MDS patients are at an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, an association with GCA has rarely been reported. This case illustrates the importance of considering GCA as a cause of anemia in elderly patients if MDS is already diagnosed, even in countries where the prevalence of GCA is very low. The simultaneous development of GCA and MDS suggests a common pathogenetic link between these two diseases.\n\nGonococcal endocarditis in a 47-year-old Japanese man.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Hiroshi; Miyazaki, Shinichi; Ozeki, Takaya; Matsuo, Masaki; Branch, Joel; Fujita, Yoshiro; Marui, Nobuyuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA 47-year-old sexually active Japanese man was admitted with a persistent fever and weight loss. A physical examination revealed a cardiac murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram was nondiagnostic, although blood cultures grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal endocarditis was diagnosed based on the modified Duke criteria. The administration of antimicrobial therapy resulted in an adequate initial resolution; however, two months after completing the therapy, the patient developed cardiac failure. Severe aortic regurgitation was identified, and the patient underwent emergent aortic valve replacement. Despite the rarity of gonococcal endocarditis, this disease should nevertheless be considered in patients presenting with a fever, cardiac murmur and a consistent sexual history.\n\nAn Aggressive Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate in a Japanese Man\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHashimoto, Yasuhiro; Imanishi, Kengo; Okamoto, Akiko; Sasaki, Atsushi; Saitoh, Hisao; Wada, Ryuichi; Yamamoto, Hayato; Koie, Takuya; Ohyama, Chikara\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSignet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the prostate is rare, with approximately 100 case reports to date. Here we report a very aggressive case of SRCC of the prostate in a Japanese man. The patient received estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin combination chemotherapy, followed by TS-1 and CPT-11 combination therapy. Unfortunately, the disease progressed, and he died of general metastatic disease treated over 16 month with systemic chemotherapy.

In patients with FDH, serum-free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentrations as measured by several commercial methods are often falsely increased with normal thyrotropin (TSH). Therefore, several diagnostic steps are needed to differentiate TSH-secreting tumor or generalized resistance to thyroid hormone from FDH. We herein report a case of a Japanese man born in Aomori prefecture, with FDH caused by a mutant albumin gene (R218P). We found that a large number of FDH patients reported in Japan to date might have been born in Aomori prefecture and have shown the R218P mutation. In conclusion, FDH needs to be considered among the differential diagnoses in Japanese patients born in Aomori prefecture and showing normal TSH levels and elevated FT4 levels.

The immense storm covered hundreds of kilometers with spiraling bands of thunderstorms, though it had lost the distinctive cloud-free eye it exhibited the day before. Typhoons are common in Japan, but powerful typhoons usually strike the island nation later in the year. The Japan Meteorological Agency said that Man-Yi is the fourth typhoon of the 2007 season and may be the most powerful ever observed in the northwest Pacific in July, reported Kyodo News. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center expected the typhoon to strike Kyushu, a southern Japanese island, on July 14, and then curve northeast along the eastern shore of Japan. By the time the storm reaches Tokyo on July 15, it should be degraded to a tropical storm. As of July 13, Typhoon Man-Yi had injured eight and flooded twenty houses in Okinawa, and forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights, said Kyodo News. The storm was expected to bring heavy rain to Japan's Pacific coast.

Recently, a novel major Japanese cypress pollen allergen, Cha o 3, was discovered. However, whether a Cha o 3 homolog is present in Japanese cedar pollen remains to be determined. Western blot analysis was performed using Cha o 3-specific antiserum. In addition, cloning of the gene encoding Cry j 4 was conducted using total cDNA from the male flower of Japanese cedar trees. Allergen potency and cross-reactivity were investigated using a T-cell proliferation assay, basophil activation test, and ImmunoCAP inhibition assay. A low amount of Cha o 3 homolog protein was detected in Japanese cedar pollen extract. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cry j 4 showed 84% identity to that of Cha o 3. Cross-reactivity between Cry j 4 and Cha o 3 was observed at the T cell and IgE levels. Cry j 4 was discovered as a counterpart allergen of Cha o 3 in Japanese cedar pollen, with a relationship similar to that between Cry j 1-Cha o 1 and Cry j 2-Cha o 2. Our findings also suggest that allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) using Japanese cedar pollen extract does not induce adequate immune tolerance to Cha o 3 due to the low amount of Cry j 4 in Japanese cedar pollen. Therefore, ASIT using Cha o 3 or cypress pollen extract coupled with Japanese cedar pollen extract is required in order to optimally control allergy symptoms during Japanese cypress pollen season.

Both Japanese and American managers have a Rational Man theory of the individual. However, Americans see groups as helping to reduce the risk of poor performance, whereas Japanese see them as enhancing good performance.

A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with sarcoidosis based on clinical and laboratory findings, including bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and lysozyme, as well as the presence of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. The patient also exhibited general fatigue, pigmentation, weight loss, hypotension and hyponatremia, suggestive of chronic adrenocortical insufficiency. An endocrine examination confirmed primary adrenocortical insufficiency. This case suggests the direct involvement of sarcoid granuloma in the adrenal glands.\n\nPulmonary Histoplasmosis in a Japanese Man Infected During Travel to Mexico and Management of His Wife's Condition: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsahata-Tago, Sayaka; Hirai, Yuji; Ainoda, Yusuke; Fujita, Takahiro; Muraosa, Yasunori; Kamei, Katsuhiko; Wakayama, Megumi; Shibuya, Kazutoshi; Kikuchi, Ken\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe report herein on the case of a 33-year-old Japanese man in whom an abnormal shadow was detected on chest radiography during a medical checkup after a 1-year-stay in Mexico. Chest computed tomography showed a nodule in the left lower lobe adjacent to the visceral pleura. Histopathologic examination of a thoracoscopic partial pulmonary resection specimen showed coagulation necrosis with a number of yeast-like forms on Grocott staining. In addition, serum anti-Histoplasma antibody positivity was detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Histoplasma-specific nested real-time polymerase chain reaction results were positive in the pulmonary region. Finally, pulmonary histoplasmosis was diagnosed, and treatment with itraconazole was initiated. The patient's wife who had accompanied him to Mexico was asymptomatic and was not found to have histoplasmosis based on diagnostic imaging and serological findings. Although rare in Japan, histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions in patients who have returned from travel to endemic areas.\n\nMan-systems integration and the man-machine interface\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHale, Joseph P.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nViewgraphs on man-systems integration and the man-machine interface are presented. Man-systems integration applies the systems' approach to the integration of the user and the machine to form an effective, symbiotic Man-Machine System (MMS). A MMS is a combination of one or more human beings and one or more physical components that are integrated through the common purpose of achieving some objective. The human operator interacts with the system through the Man-Machine Interface (MMI).\n\nA young man presenting with paralysis after vigorous exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nGubran, Christopher; Narain, Rajay; Malik, Luqmaan; Saeed, Saad Aldeen\n\n2012-08-27\n\nThyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a rare metabolic disorder characterised by muscular weakness and paralysis in predisposed thyrotoxic patients. Although patients with TPP are almost uniformly men of Asian descent, cases have been reported in Caucasian and other ethnic populations. The rapid increase in ethnic diversity in Western and European nations has led to increase in TPP reports, where it was once considered exceedingly rare. Correcting the hypokalaemic and hyperthyroid state tends to reverse the paralysis. However, failure to recognise the condition may lead to delay in diagnosis and serious consequences including respiratory failure and death. We describe a young man who was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism who presented with acute paralysis. The clinical characteristics, pathophysiology and management of TTP are reviewed.\n\nTsukiai--Obligatory Personal Relationships of Japanese White-Collar Company Employees.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAtsumi, Reiko\n\n1979-01-01\n\nFocusing on the meaning/function of a man's personal relationships with his fellow workers and other work-related people in comparison with friendship and kinship relationships, this study indicates Japanese company employees distinguish personal work-related relationships from friendship and engage in after-hour socialization with colleagues outâ¦\n\nA Statistical Method of Evaluating the Pronunciation Proficiency/Intelligibility of English Presentations by Japanese Speakers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKibishi, Hiroshi; Hirabayashi, Kuniaki; Nakagawa, Seiichi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we propose a statistical evaluation method of pronunciation proficiency and intelligibility for presentations made in English by native Japanese speakers.

However, primary care physicians can provide only limited weight loss with lifestyle interventions, usually reducing a patient's body weight by only 2.5Â kg or less after 6-18Â months. A 45-year-old Japanese man was referred to our clinic owing to obesity, daytime sleepiness, and snoring during sleep. His weight was 130.7Â kg and his body mass index (BMI) was 41.0Â kg/m(2). He underwent polysomnography, which revealed OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index of 71.2 events/h (normal,Â <5 events/h). His laboratory results were as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone,Â >500Â Î¼IU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.4Â pg/mL; free thyroxine,Â <0.15âng/dL; thyroid peroxidase antibody, 10Â IU/mL; thyroglobulin antibody,Â >4000Â IU/mL; total cholesterol (TC), 335Â mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 45Â mg/dL; triglycerides (TGs), 211Â mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 248Â mg/dL; fasting blood sugar, 86Â mg/dL; and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 6.1Â %. These results showed that he also had primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), levothyroxine replacement, and a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) were initiated. CPAP use and a euthyroid condition induced by 175Â Î¼g/day levothyroxine allowed the patient to proactively reduce his body weight. After 18Â months, the patient achieved a weight reduction of 32.4Â kg (25Â % of his initial weight) and a BMI reduction of 10.2Â kg/m(2), as well as improved laboratory results, including an HbA1c level of 5.3Â %, TC level of 194Â mg/dL, and TG level of 89Â mg/dL. An LCD may be an effective intervention for weight loss in obese Japanese patients with OSA. Further studies are needed to investigate the weight loss effect of an LCD compared with a conventional calorie-restricted diet. Hopefully, this case report will help to improve the\n\nThe Man of Dual Nationality.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAbe, Yoshio\n\n1985-01-01\n\nPresents an English translation of the first few pages, set in a Japanese internment camp in the U.S. during World War II, of a Japanese novel about the problems of dual nationality and personal identity.

In three experiments, participants who were native speakers of Japanese, Japanese-learning Chinese, or Chinese without knowledge of the Japanese language were shown two pictures. One picture was of a small object making a small sound, such as a small vase being broken, and the other was of a big object making a big sound, such as a big vase being broken. Participants were presented with two novel onomatopoetic words with voicing contrasts, e.g.,/dachan/vs./tachan/, and were told that each word corresponded to one of the two pictures. They were then asked to match the words to the corresponding pictures. Chinese without knowledge of Japanese performed only at chance level, whereas Japanese and Japanese-learning Chinese successfully matched a voiced/unvoiced consonant with a big/small object respectively. The results suggest that the key to understanding the symbolic values of voicing contrasts in Japanese onomatopoeia is some basic knowledge that is intrinsic to the Japanese language.\n\nMottainai: a Japanese sense of anima mundi.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Yuriko\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe Japanese expression 'Mottainai!' can be translated as 'What a waste!' or 'Don't be wasteful!' However, mottainai means much more than that. It expresses a sense of concern or regret for whatever is wasted because its intrinsic value is not properly utilized. Buddhism and Japan's indigenous religion, Shinto, are integral to the Japanese psyche, accordingly the other-than-human world is also experienced and lived in daily life. In the Japanese worldview everything in nature is endowed with spirit, every individual existence is dependent on others and all are connected in an ever-changing world. Mottainai offers a glimpse of the anima mundi inherent in this worldview. This contrasts with our anthropocentric Zeitgeist, which manifests outwardly as environmental crisis and inwardly as fixation upon social interactions, especially through communication technologies, to the exclusion of all else. Jung's statement, 'The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life', has never been more pertinent. Encounters beyond the human world could be understood as touching this 'something infinite', and the apparent benefits of such experiences in the analytical process are illustrated with clinical vignettes from the author's practice.

Participants were 40 Japanese first-generation immigrants to the United States, 57 Japanese monoculturals, and 60 U.S. monoculturals. All participants completed the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) as a measure of the Big Five; immigrants completed the Japanese American Acculturation Scale. Immigrants' fits with the cultures of destination and origin were calculated by correlating Japanese American mothers' patterns of ratings on the Big Five with the average patterns of ratings of European Americans and Japanese on the same personality dimensions. Japanese Americans became more \"American\" and less \"Japanese\" in their personality as they reported higher participation in the U.S. culture. The results support the view that personality can be subject to cultural influence.\n\nA short history of Japanese historical seismology: past and the present\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMatsu'ura, Ritsuko S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSince seismicity in Japan is fairly high, Japanese interest in historical seismicity can be traced back to the nineth century, only a few centuries after the formation of the ancient ruling state. A 1000 years later, 2 years earlier than the modern seismological society was founded, the research on historical seismology started in Japan in 1878. By the accumulation for the recent 140 years, the present Japanese seismologists can read many historical materials without reading cursive scripts. We have a convenient access to the historical information related to earthquakes, in the modern characters of 27,759 pages. We now have 214 epicenters of historical earthquakes from 599 ad to 1872. Among them, 134 events in the early modern period were assigned hypocentral depths and proper magnitudes. The intensity data of 8700 places by those events were estimated. These precise intensity data enabled us to compare the detailed source areas of pairs of repeated historical earthquakes, such as the 1703 Genroku earthquake with the 1923 Kanto earthquake, and the 1707 Hoei earthquake with the summation of the 1854 Ansei Tokai and Ansei Nankai earthquakes. It is revealed that the focal area of the former larger event cannot completely include those of the latter smaller earthquakes, although those were believed to be typical sets of characteristic interplate earthquakes at the Sagami trough and at the Nankai trough. Research on historical earthquakes is very important to assess the seismic hazard in the future. We still have one-fifth events of the early modern period to be analyzed in detail. The compilation of places experienced high intensities in the modern events is also necessary. For the ancient and medieval periods, many equivocal events are still left. The further advance of the interdisciplinary research on historical seismology is necessary.\n\nEpidemiology of Japanese encephalitis: past, present, and future prospects\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Huanyu; Liang, Guodong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is one of severe viral encephalitis that affects individuals in Asia, western Pacific countries, and northern Australia. Although 67,900 JE cases have been estimated among 24 JE epidemic countries annually, only 10,426 have been reported in 2011. With the establishment of JE surveillance and vaccine use in some countries, the JE incidence rate has decreased; however, serious outbreaks still occur. Understanding JE epidemics and identifying the circulating JE virus genotypes will improve JE prevention and control. This review summarizes the current epidemiology data in these countries.

Hormonal testing revealed panhypopituitarism. His cerebral MRI showed a gadolinium-enhancing lesion in the pituitary gland with adjacent changes to the hypothalamus, midbrain, and basal ganglia (figures 1 and 2). Therapy with prednisolone resulted in rapid improvement. Ma2 antibodies were found in the patient's serum and CSF. FDG-PET demonstrated a tumor mass in the superior mediastinum and histology revealed a mediastinal seminoma. Ma2 antibody-mediated paraneoplastic disease has to be considered as a rare differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute panhypopituitarism.(1.)\n\nOptimal viewing position in vertically and horizontally presented Japanese words.\n\nPubMed\n\nKajii, N; Osaka, N\n\n2000-11-01\n\nIn the present study, the optimal viewing position (OVP) phenomenon in Japanese Hiragana was investigated, with special reference to a comparison between the vertical and the horizontal meridians in the visual field. In the first experiment, word recognition scores were determined while the eyes were fixating predetermined locations in vertically and horizontally displayed words. Similar to what has been reported for Roman scripts, OVP curves, which were asymmetric with respect to the beginning of words, were observed in both conditions. However, this asymmetry was less pronounced for vertically than for horizontally displayed words. In the second experiment, the visibility of individual characters within strings was examined for the vertical and horizontal meridians. As for Roman characters, letter identification scores were better in the right than in the left visual field. However, identification scores did not differ between the upper and the lower sides of fixation along the vertical meridian. The results showed that the model proposed by Nazir, O'Regan, and Jacobs (1991) cannot entirely account for the OVP phenomenon. A model in which visual and lexical factors are combined is proposed instead.\n\nDetermination of kinetic parameters for 123-I thyroid uptake in healthy Japanese\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKusuhara, Hiroyuki; Maeda, Kazuya\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the kinetic parameters for iodide thyroid accumulation in Japanese today with previously reported values. We determined the thyroid uptake of 123-I at 24 hours after the oral administration in healthy male Japanese without any diet restriction. The mean value was 16.1Â±5.4%, which was similar or rather lower than those previously reported in Japan (1958-1972). Kinetic model analysis was conducted to obtain the clearance for thyroid uptake from the blood circulation. The thyroid uptake clearance of 123-I was 0.540Â±0.073 ml/min, which was almost similar to those reported previously. There is no obvious difference in the thyroid uptake for 24 hours, and kinetic parameters in healthy Japanese for these 50 years. The fraction of distributed to the thyroid gland is lower than the ICRP reference man, and such difference must be taken into consideration to estimate the radiation exposure upon Fukushima accident in Japan.\n\nAcculturation of Personality: A Three-Culture Study of Japanese, Japanese Americans, and European Americans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ¼ngÃ¶r, Derya; Bornstein, Marc H.; De Leersnyder, Jozefien; Cote, Linda; Ceulemans, Eva; Mesquita, Batja\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe present study tests the hypothesis that involvement with a new culture instigates changes in personality of immigrants that result in (a) better fit with the norms of the culture of destination and (b) reduced fit with the norms of the culture of origin.

It is the first Venus Climate Orbiter (VCO) of Japan. The ministry of finance of Japan finally agreed to start phase B study of VCO from this April, 2004. We plan 1-2 years phase B study followed by 2 years of flight model integration. The spacecraft will be launched between 2009 and 2010. After arriving Venus, 2 years of operation is expected. VCO will complemet the ESA's Venus Express mission which have several spectrometers and will reveal the composition of the Venusian atmosphere. On the other hand, VCO is designed to reveal the details of the atmospheric motion on Venus and approach the dynamics of the Venusian climate. Cooperation between Japanese VCO and ESA's Venus Express, in the colaboration framework of U.S., Europian, and Japanese scienctist is very important. To elucidate the driving mechanism of the 4-days super-rotation is one of our main targets. We have 4 cameras to take snap shots of the planets in different wave lengths. They are the IR1 camera (1 micron-meter), the IR2 camera (2.4 micron-meter), the LIR camera (10-12 micron-meter), and the UVI camera (340nm). They are attached to the side panel of the 3-axis stabilized spacecraft, and are directed to Venus with the spacecraft's attitude control. Snap shots are expected to be taken every 2 hours. The spacecraft has an orbit of 300km x 13Rv (Venusian radii) with 172 degrees inclination. Orbital period is 30 hours. The angular position of the spacecraft on this orbit is synchronized for 20 hours at its apoapsis with the global atmospheric circulation at the altitude of 50km, thus the snap shots of every 2 hours will be the images of the same side of the atmosphere. In addition to these 4 cameras, we have a Lightning and Airglow camera (LAC) in visible range. This will be operated when the orbiter is close to the planet.\n\n[The alteration of Japanese anatomical terminology in the early Showa period and the Japanese language reform campaign].\n\nPubMed\n\nSawai, Tadashi; Sakai, Tatsuo\n\n2010-03-01\n\nIn the second decade of the Showa period, great changes were made in the Japanese anatomical terms. It has been proposed that the presentation of JNA (Jenaer nomina anatomica) was one of the factors leading to the change. The Japanese language reform campaign, however, played an important role. The party kokugoaigo doumei and its successor kokugo kyokai required concise and unified technical terms. The anatomical nomenclature committee of the Japanese Association of Anatomists worked to satisfy this requirement. The committee consulted with nomenclature committees of other medical associations and took account of their opinions. The anatomical nomenclature committee abandoned the literal translation from Latin to Japanese and shaped a succinct Japanese terminology.

Cholesteryl-Î±-glucosides have been identified as unique glycolipids present in H.Â pylori and some Helicobacter species. Cholesterol-Î±-glucosyltransferase (Î±CgT), a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of cholesteryl-Î±-glucosides, plays crucial roles in the pathogenicity of H.Â pylori. Therefore, it is important to examine Î±CgTs of NHPHs. Six gastric NHPHs were isolated from Japanese patients and maintained in mouse stomachs. The Î±CgT genes were amplified by PCR and inverse PCR. We retrieved the Î±CgT genes of other Helicobacter species by BLAST searches in GenBank. Î±CgT genes were present in most Helicobacter species and in all Japanese isolates examined. However, we could find no candidate gene for Î±CgT in the whole genome of Helicobacter cinaedi and several enterohepatic species. Phylogenic analysis demonstrated that the Î±CgT genes of all Japanese isolates show high similarities to that of a zoonotic group of gastric NHPHs including Helicobacter suis, Helicobacter heilmannii, and Helicobacter ailurogastricus. Of 6 Japanese isolates, the Î±CgT genes of 4 isolates were identical to that of H.Â suis, and that of another 2 isolates were similar to that of H.Â heilmannii and H.Â ailurogastricus. All gastric NHPHs examined showed presence of Î±CgT genes, indicating that Î±CgT may be beneficial for these helicobacters to infect human and possibly animal stomachs. Our study indicated that NHPHs could be classified into 2 groups, NHPHs with Î±CgT genes and NHPHs without Î±CgT genes.

The measurement equivalence in Japanese and English had not been confirmed in prior studies. We analyzed the 40 CASI items for differential item functioning (DIF) related to test language, as well as self-reported proficiency with written Japanese, age, and educational attainment in two large epidemiologic studies of Japanese-American elderly: the Kame Project (n=1708) and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS; n = 3148). DIF was present if the demographic groups differed in the probability of success on an item, after controlling for their underlying cognitive functioning ability. While seven CASI items had DIF related to language of testing in Kame (registration of one item; recall of one item; similes; judgment; repeating a phrase; reading and performing a command; and following a three-step instruction), the impact of DIF on participants' scores was minimal. Mean scores for Japanese and English speakers in Kame changed by <0.1 SD after accounting for DIF related to test language. In HAAS, insufficient numbers of participants were tested in Japanese to assess DIF related to test language. In both studies, DIF related to written Japanese proficiency, age, and educational attainment had minimal impact. To the extent that DIF could be assessed, the CASI appeared to meet the goal of measuring cognitive function equivalently in Japanese and English. Stratified data collection would be needed to confirm this conclusion. DIF assessment should be used in other studies with multiple language groups to confirm that measures function equivalently or, if not, form scores that account for DIF.\n\nA Healthy, Chubby Japanese Man ( genki na debu chan).\n\nPubMed\n\nCastro-VÃ¡zquez, Genaro\n\n2018-07-01\n\nIn light of official reports indicating a still prevalent tendency to masculinized obesity and overweight in Japan (Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2015), this article explores the experiences of 28 Japanese men grappling with bodyweight control. Aged between 24 and 67, 3 of the men were postgraduate or undergraduate students, 7 self-employed, 17 company workers and 1 retired. Fourteen hold a university degree, 1 completed senior high school and 10 finished 3-year junior college. Twelve were married and 16 were single. Ten of the participants have been requested to lose weight because of being at risk of developing metabolic diseases, the rest have been called \"chubby\" ( debu) and all of them have unsuccessfully tried to lose weight. A set of two, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant in Tokyo and Osaka in June and July 2015, 2016, and 2017. Grounded in symbolic interactionism, the interview analysis allows for a reading of the participants' embodied subjectivity in line with three axes: autodidact self, gendered self, and emotional self. The article highlights how the feminization of care has an effect on the participant's daily interactions. In conclusion, the article underscores the salience of \"emotional attachment\" to food (Lupton, 1998, p. 158), the \"emotionalization\" of food consumption and the emotionalization of the \"fat body\" in understanding their experiences dealing with corpulence in a country where slimness appears to be \"ethnicized.\"\n\nStatistics in Japanese universities.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIto, P K\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe teaching of statistics in the U.S. and Japanese universities is briefly reviewed. It is found that H. Hotelling's articles and subsequent relevant publications on the teaching of statistics have contributed to a considerable extent to the establishment of excellent departments of statistics in U.S. universities and colleges. Today the U.S. may be proud of many well-staffed and well-organized departments of theoretical and applied statistics with excellent undergraduate and graduate programs. On the contrary, no Japanese universities have an independent department of statistics at present, and the teaching of statistics has been spread among a heterogeneous group of departments of application. This was mainly due to the Japanese government regulation concerning the establishment of a university. However, it has recently been revised so that an independent department of statistics may be started in a Japanese university with undergraduate and graduate programs. It is hoped that discussions will be started among those concerned on the question of organization of the teaching of statistics in Japanese universities as soon as possible.

A 36-year-old Japanese man with osteogenesis imperfecta type I who had frequently experienced painful fragility fractures consulted our clinic because of chronic back pain. The patient had multiple morphometric vertebral fractures and a low bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine. The patient was treated with cyclical etidronate 200 mg, for 2 weeks every 3 months, plus alfacalcidol 1 Î¼g daily, for 2 years; and alendronate 5 mg daily or 35 mg weekly, plus alfacalcidol 1 Î¼g daily for 9 years. After 11 years of treatment, BMD at the lumbar spine increased by 6.4%, following a 20.3% reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone levels remained within the normal ranges. Three clinical fractures occurred at two ribs and the metacarpus, and two morphometric vertebral fractures occurred at the thoracic spine during the 11-year treatment period, but the patient experienced no adverse effects. Thus, the present case report shows the long-term outcome and safety of bisphosphonate plus alfacalcidol treatment in a man with osteogenesis imperfecta type I.

It was therefore important to build a photographic database of Japanese restorative care which could be utilized as a comparison tool for the deployed odontologist. The dental restorative care of approximately 400 US and 100 Japanese sets of remains was evaluated. Both countries share many similar restorative techniques to include collared crowns, full-coverage restorations, cantilever bridge/pontics to close spaces; restorative materials such as amalgam, gold, and zinc phosphate (temporary) restorations; and removable prostheses. The dental restorative materials most commonly used by US dentists include the amalgam and silicate cement, while the full-coverage crown was the type of restoration most frequently seen on the Japanese remains. Silicates, porcelain and replaceable crowns, and partial-coverage prepared crowns were not observed on the recovered Japanese remains. Published 2017.

In September 2012, a previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man presented to National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo with a two-day history of daily fever, mild headaches and mild arthralgia. Malaria parasites were found in the Giemsa-stained thin blood smear, which showed band forms similar to Plasmodium malariae. Although a nested PCR showed the amplification of the primer of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi, he was finally diagnosed with P. knowlesi mono-infection by DNA sequencing. He was treated with mefloquine, and recovered without any complications. DNA sequencing of the PCR products is indispensable to confirm P. knowlesi infection, however there is limited access to DNA sequencing procedures in endemic areas. The extent of P. knowlesi transmission in Asia has not been clearly defined. There is limited availability of diagnostic tests and routine surveillance system for reporting an accurate diagnosis in the Asian endemic regions. Thus, reporting accurately diagnosed cases of P. knowlesi infection in travellers would be important for assessing the true nature of this emerging human infection.\n\nHow the Japanese work.\n\nPubMed\n\nChambers, D W\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe Japanese do not work harder or even use different approaches so much as they aim for a different result--one that balances process and results and extends the definition of quality beyond the product itself to include cost and convenience to the customer as well.

Here, 57 native Japanese speakers provided monolexemic terms for 320 chromatic and 10 achromatic Munsell color samples. Through k-means cluster analysis we revealed 16 statistically distinct Japanese chromatic categories. These included eight chromatic basic color terms (aka/red, ki/yellow, midori/green, ao/blue, pink, orange, cha/brown, and murasaki/purple) plus eight additional terms: mizu (\"water\")/light blue, hada (\"skin tone\")/peach, kon (\"indigo\")/dark blue, matcha (\"green tea\")/yellow-green, enji/maroon, oudo (\"sand or mud\")/mustard, yamabuki (\"globeflower\")/gold, and cream. Of these additional terms, mizu was used by 98% of informants, and emerged as a strong candidate for a 12th Japanese basic color term. Japanese and American English color-naming systems were broadly similar, except for color categories in one language (mizu, kon, teal, lavender, magenta, lime) that had no equivalent in the other. Our analysis revealed two statistically distinct Japanese motifs (or color-naming systems), which differed mainly in the extension of mizu across our color palette. Comparison of the present data with an earlier study by Uchikawa & Boynton (1987) suggests that some changes in the Japanese color lexicon have occurred over the last 30 years.\n\nSignificance of common variants on human chromosome 8q24 in relation to the risk of prostate cancer in native Japanese men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Miao; Kurosaki, Takayuki; Suzuki, Motofumi; Enomoto, Yutaka; Nishimatsu, Hiroaki; Arai, Tomio; Sawabe, Motoji; Hosoi, Takayuki; Homma, Yukio; Kitamura, Tadaichi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground Common variants on human chromosome 8q24, rs1447295 (C/A) and rs6983267 (T/G), have been recently linked to the prevalence of prostate cancer in European and American populations. Here, we evaluated whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1447295 and rs6983267 were associated with the risk of sporadic prostate cancer as well as latent prostate cancer in a native Japanese population. Results We analyzed genomic DNA samples from 391 sporadic prostate cancer patients, 323 controls who had died from causes unrelated to cancer and 112 Japanese men who were diagnosed as having latent prostate cancer based on autopsy results. The polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination using a fluorescent-based TaqMan assay. The A allele of rs1447295 was significantly associated with the risk of sporadic prostate cancer (p = 0.04; age-adjusted OR, 1.34), while the G allele of rs6983267 showed a trend towards being a high-risk allele (p = 0.06; age-adjusted OR, 1.27). No significant difference between these two polymorphisms and the risk of latent prostate cancer was observed in the present Japanese population. Conclusion Known variants on human chromosome 8q24 may be risk factors for sporadic prostate cancer in native Japanese men.

Most cases are self-limiting and usually afflict children and young adults. Although rare, CSD can lead to serious complications, especially in immunocompromised patients. These rare complications often require intensive treatment. We describe the case of a 79-year-old man who presented with general malaise and a high fever. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Of note, the lymph nodes were not enlarged. An abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast revealed a solitary splenic abscess and no lymphadenopathy. The initial antibiotic treatment was ineffective and a splenectomy was indicated. A history of contact with cats raised the possibility of CSD, which was confirmed by a positive serology test result for B henselae. Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin successfully treated the splenic abscess and splenectomy was avoided. 2015 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\n\"This Guy Is Japanese Stuck in a White Man's Body\": A Discussion of Meaning Making, Identity Slippage, and Cross-Cultural Adaption.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nArmour, William S.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nAddresses two issues within a general theory of cross-cultural adaption.

The patient subsequently developed encephalopathy, at which point thiamine deficiency was suspected and thiamine supplementation initiated. The encephalopathy and the dysphagia resolved, but the patient was left with a dense amnestic deficit consistent with Korsakoff syndrome. MRI at the time of the encephalopathy revealed lesions consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This case represents a remarkable example of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome that for a prolonged time period had as its sole manifestation severe dysphagia. To our knowledge, there is only one similar case reported in the literature. This case serves to alert neurologists that isolated dysphagia may be the presenting symptom of this classic neurological syndrome even in the absence of alcoholism.\n\nEnglish publication rate of 3,205 abstracts presented at the Annual Meeting of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association and the Annual Research Meeting of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhtori, Seiji; Kubota, Gou; Inage, Kazuhide; Yamauchi, Kazuyo; Orita, Sumihisa; Suzuki, Miyako; Sakuma, Yoshihiro; Oikawa, Yasuhiro; Sainoh, Takeshi; Sato, Jun; Ishikawa, Tetsuhiro; Miyagi, Masayuki; Kamoda, Hiroto; Aoki, Yasuchika; Nakamura, Junichi; Inoue, Gen; Takaso, Masashi; Toyone, Tomoaki; Takahashi, Kazuhisa\n\n2013-11-01\n\nPrevious studies reported that the publication rate of abstracts presented at overseas meetings was around 50Â %. The study objectives were to determine the rate of publication in English-language journals and the impact factor (IF) for all papers presented at the Annual Meeting of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and Annual Research Meeting of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOAR), and to compare the publication rates and IFs from abstracts accepted for oral versus poster presentations. Titles and first authors were identified for 1,676 abstracts of free papers accepted for presentation to the JOA in 2006 and 2007, and 1,529 abstracts to the JOAR from 2006 to 2008. We identified the associated journal publications by searching PubMed, and IFs were determined using the journal citation reports. The publication rates and IFs for papers accepted for oral versus poster presentations were compared using statistical analysis. The overall publication rate was 25.5Â % from the JOA and 50Â % from the JOAR. There were no significant differences in yearly publication rates, or between oral and poster presentations for each year. The average IFs for all publications from the JOA was 2.45 and that from the JOAR was 3.5. There were no significant differences in yearly IFs, or between oral and poster presentations for each year (PÂ >Â 0.05). The rate from JOAR was similar to publication rates for abstracts presented at overseas orthopedic meetings, however, the rate from JOA was half that of publication rates for abstracts presented at overseas orthopedic meetings, indicating that JOA may provide a below average contribution of new medical data to the international scientific community. No significant difference in publication rates between oral and poster presentations were found, and this suggests a need for improvement of the review system for the annual meeting and that review scores at the meetings did not predict the publication fate of abstracts.\n\nA Japanese Encephalitis Patient Presenting with Parkinsonism with Corresponding Laterality of Magnetic Resonance and Dopamine Transporter Imaging Findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nTadokoro, Koh; Ohta, Yasuyuki; Sato, Kota; Maeki, Takahiro; Sasaki, Ryo; Takahashi, Yoshiaki; Shang, Jingwei; Takemoto, Mami; Hishikawa, Nozomi; Yamashita, Toru; Lim, Chang Kweng; Tajima, Shigeru; Abe, Koji\n\n2018-03-09\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) survivors often present with nigrostriatal aftereffects with parkinsonian features.

Two weeks after the initiation of azathioprine he presented with fever, fatigue, myalgias and arthralgias and a painful cutaneous eruption that was most marked in a sun-exposed distribution. This was accompanied by loose, non-bloody diarrhoea. Histopathological assessment of a skin biopsy supported a diagnosis of a neutrophilic dermatosis. The azathioprine was temporarily withheld and oral prednisolone was increased as it was thought that the neutrophilic dermatosis was associated with the underlying ulcerative colitis. The patient's symptoms and cutaneous eruption resolved quickly and azathioprine was re-introduced. Within 24 h, systemic symptoms returned along with a florid recrudescence of his cutaneous eruption. This rapidly improved upon withdrawal of azathioprine.\n\nStellar map of neolithic man\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPskovskiy, Y.

The slides of a presentation from the Medical Library Association annual meeting were translated from English to Chinese, Japanese, and Russian and posted along with the English version to SlideShare, an open slide-hosting website. View counts, traffic sources, and geographic origins of the traffic for each language version were tracked over a twenty-two-month period. Total view counts for all 4 language versions amounted to 3,357 views, with the Chinese version accounting for 71% of the total views. The trends in view counts over time for the Japanese, Russian, and English versions were similar, with high interest at the beginning and a rapid drop and low level of viewing activity thereafter. The pattern of view counts for the Chinese version departed considerably from the other language versions, with very low activity at the beginning but a sharp rise 10 months later. This increase in activity was related to access to the presentations via a Taiwanese website that embedded the SlideShare website code. Language translation can be a difficult and time-consuming task. However, translation of a conference slide presentation with limited text is an achievable activity and engages an international audience for information that is often not noticed or lost. Although English is by far the primary language of science and other disciplines, it is not necessarily the first or preferred language of global researchers. By offering appropriate language versions, the authors of presentations can expand the reach of their work.\n\nHotel Employees' Japanese Language Experiences: Implications and Suggestions.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMakita-Discekici, Yasuko\n\n1998-01-01\n\nAnalyzes the Japanese language learning experiences of 13 hotel employees in Guam.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the ACTN3 R577X genotype and elite athlete status in a large Asian (Japanese) cohort of track and field athletes. One-thousand fifty-seven Japanese track and field athletes (627 sprint/power athletes and 430 endurance athletes) and 810 Japanese controls were genotyped for the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism (rs1815739) by using the TaqManÂ® SNP Genotyping Assay. Elite sprint/power athletes had a higher frequency of the RR+RX genotype than the controls (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.16-2.18; Pâ=â.003). A significant linear correlation was found between the RRâ+âRX genotype and athlete status (i.e. regionalâ<ânationalâ<âinternational) in sprint/power athletes (regional: 71%, national: 81%, international: 84%; Pâ=â.001 for trend) and long-distance runners (regional: 65%, national: 72%, international: 82%; Pâ=â.030 for trend). The data obtained for this large Asian (Japanese) cohort of track and field athletes served to confirm the association between the RRâ+âRX genotype of the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and elite sprint/power athlete status and also the association between the ACTN3 RRâ+âRX genotype and long-distance running athletic status.\n\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis induced by Japanese pear pollen.\n\nPubMed\n\nYanagisawa, S; Nagaki, Y; Hiraki, S; Kadoi, C; Hayasaka, S; Teranishi, H\n\n1999-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the ocular findings in patients with Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) pollinosis. Twenty-two farmers working on artificial pollination in Japanese pear orchards were examined for ocular itching, conjunctival conditions, presence of eosinophils in the conjunctival specimen, and nasal symptoms. Serum IgE antibody to Japanese pear pollen was determined in 16 farmers. Of the 22 subjects, 3 (Nos. 3, 4, and 13) exhibited ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, eosinophils in the conjunctival specimen, and positive serum IgE antibodies to Japanese pear pollen. In these patients, the conjunctivitis disappeared after treatment with topical cromoglycate. The present study demonstrated that seasonal allergic conjunctivitis may be induced by Japanese pear pollen (entomophilous flower pollen).\n\nThe Japanese Automobile Worker: A Microcosm of Japan's Success.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKaderabeck, Elizabeth A.\n\nA teaching unit on the Japanese automobile worker was developed from a compilation of on-site interviews with Japanese company managers and production line employees, and official publications of the Japanese car industry.

Growth characteristics studied were height, weight, and relative weight index, weight/(height). The Hawaii-Japanese boys were taller at early ages but the difference disappeared by age 16. Native Japanese girls were shorter than Hawaii-Japanese until age 13, but they overtook the latter by age 14, exceeding them in height after age 15. A similar pattern was found in weights of girls but the Hawaii-Japanese boys remained consistently heavier by 5.0 to 9.0 kg than native Japanese. The relative weight measure indicated that the Hawaii boys were more \"obese\" than native Japanese boys for the growth period studied; whereas the same tendency was maintained until age 15 in girls. These observations indicate a marked degree of convergence of the patterns of physical growth of the two populations, whose differences were unmistakably in favor of American born children in earlier studies. It is concluded that the convergence is due largely to the improved environmental conditions in Japan in recent years.\n\nBilingual Dual Coding in Japanese Returnee Students.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTaura, Hideyuki\n\n1998-01-01\n\nInvestigates effects of second-language acquisition age, length of exposure to the second language, and Japanese language specificity on the bilingual dual coding hypothesis proposed by Paivio and Desrochers (1980).

Japanese macaques represent excellent models for examining issues related to sexual preference in animals because females, in certain populations, routinely engage in both heterosexual and homosexual behavior over the course of their life spans. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that female homosexual behavior in Japanese macaques is a sexual behavior, not a sociosexual one. Additional evidence indicates that female Japanese macaques do not engage in homosexual behavior simply because acceptable male mates are unavailable or unmotivated to copulate. Patterns of sexual partner choice by female Japanese macaques that are the focus of intersexual competition indicate that females of this species choose same-sex sexual partners even when they are simultaneously presented with a motivated, opposite-sex alternative. Thus, in some populations of Japanese macaques, females prefer certain same-sex sexual partners relative to certain male mates, and vice versa. Taken together, this evidence suggests that female Japanese macaques are best characterized as bisexual in orientation, not preferentially homosexual or preferentially heterosexual.\n\nJapaneseplex: A forensic SNP assay for identification of Japanese people using Japanese-specific alleles.\n\nPubMed\n\nYuasa, Isao; Akane, Atsushi; Yamamoto, Toshimichi; Matsusue, Aya; Endoh, Minoru; Nakagawa, Mayumi; Umetsu, Kazuo; Ishikawa, Takaki; Iino, Morio\n\n2018-04-24\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to determine whether a forensic biological sample came from a Japanese person. In this study, we developed a 60-locus SNP assay designed for the differentiation of Japanese people from other East Asians using entirely and nearly Japanese-specific alleles. This multiplex assay consisted of 6 independent PCR reactions followed by single nucleotide extension. The average number and standard deviation of Japanese-specific alleles possessed by an individual were 0.81â¯Â±â¯0.93 in 108 Koreans from Seoul, 8.87â¯Â±â¯2.89 in 103 Japanese from Tottori, 17.20â¯Â±â¯3.80 in 88 Japanese from Okinawa, and 0 in 220 Han Chinese from Wuxi and Changsha. The Koreans had 0-4 Japanese-specific alleles per individual, whereas the Japanese had 4-26 Japanese-specific alleles. Almost all Japanese were distinguished from the Koreans and other people by the factorial correspondence and principal component analyses. The Snipper program was also useful to estimate the degree of Japaneseness. The method described here was successfully applied to the differentiation of Japanese from non-Japanese people in forensic cases. This Japanese-specific SNP assay was named Japaneseplex.

A cost estimating methodology based primarily on existing Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) parametric cost models is summarized. These models include the MSFC Space Station Cost Model and the MSFC Launch Vehicle Cost Model as well as other modes and techniques. The ground rules and assumptions of the cost estimating methodology are discussed and cost estimates presented for six potential mission options which were studied. The estimated manned Mars mission costs are compared to the cost of the somewhat analogous Apollo Program cost after normalizing the Apollo cost to the environment and ground rules of the manned Mars missions. It is concluded that a manned Mars mission, as currently defined, could be accomplished for under $30 billion in 1985 dollars excluding launch vehicle development and mission operations.\n\nOne Man's Invasion Is Another Man's Advance: National History in Japan and Korea.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHurst, G.

Vegetative foreign bodies are highly inflammatory and, if not completely removed, can cause infection, toxic reactions, or granuloma formation. Older patients are at increased risk for infection from untreated plant foreign bodies. The most common error in plant splinter and spine management is failure to detect their presence. Case presentation Here we report a case of cactus spines in an 84-year-old Caucasian man presenting on the right flank as multiple, red papules with spiny extensions. This presentation was unusual both in location and the spinous character of the lesions, and only after punch biopsy analysis was a diagnosis of cactus matter spines made. Conclusions Our patient presented with an unusual case of cactus spines that required histopathology for identification. Skin lesions with neglected foreign bodies are a common cause of malpractice claims. If not removed, foreign bodies of the skin, particularly in elderly individuals, can result in inflammatory and infectious sequela. This report underscores the importance of thoroughly evaluating penetrating skin lesions for the presence of foreign bodies, such as splinters and spines.

Culex mosquitoes transmit Japanese encephalitis virus. Risk factors are destination, duration of stay, summer and fall seasons, outdoor activities, and type of accommodation. We report the case of a French traveler to Nepal with neutralization-based serological confirmed Japanese encephalitis. He presented classical clinical (viral syndrome before an encephalitis status with behavioral disorder, global hypotonia, mutism, movement disorders, seizure, and coma), radiological (lesions of thalami, cortico-spinal tracts, and brainstem) and biological features (lymphocytic meningitis). Nowadays, the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus in Nepal, including mountain areas, is established but Japanese encephalitis remains rare in travelers returning from this area and neurologist physicians need to become familiar with this. We recommend vaccination for travelers spending a long period of time in Nepal and having at-risk outdoor activities.\n\nSong as a Measure of Man\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRevicki, Robert\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThis is a reprint of \"Song As a Measure of Man,\" a recent publication by the Fine Arts Program of the Pennsylvania Department of Education. \"Song As a Measure of Man\" was an outcome of an intensive two-day related arts workshop concerned with \"Cantometrics,\" the first public presentation of Alan Lomax's work in sevenâ¦\n\nJapanese vegetation lidar (MOLI) on ISS (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKimura, Toshiyoshi; Imai, Tadashi; Sakaizawa, Daisuke; Murooka, Junpei\n\n2016-10-01\n\nMulti-footprint Observation LIDAR and Imager (MOLI) is a candidate mission for International Space Station - Japanese Experiment Module. The mission objective MOLI is to manage forest and to be a good calibrator for evaluation of forest biomass using satellite instrument such as L-band SAR. SAR is the powerful tool to evaluate biomass globally. However it has some signal saturation over 100 t/ha biomass measurement, whereas Vegetation LIDAR is expected to measure higher mass precisely. MOLI is designed to evaluate forest biomass with high accuracy. An imager, that is equipped together in good registration with LIDAR, will help to understand the situation of target forest. Also two simultaneous Laser beams from MOLI will calibrate the relief effect, which affects the precision of canopy height extremely. Using together with L-band SAR observation data or multispectral image, it is expected to have a good \"wall to wall\" biomass map with its phonological information. Such MOLI observation capability is so important, because both quantity and quality evaluation of biomass are essential for carbon circulation system understandings. Currently, as a key technical development, LASER Transmitters for MOLI is under test in vacuum condition. Its power is 40mJ and PRF is 150Hz. Pressure vessel design for LIDAR transmitter is supressing Laser induced contamination effect. MOLI is now under study towards around 2020 operation.\n\nMan/computer communication in a space environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHodges, B. C.; Montoya, G.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe present work reports on a study of the technology required to advance the state of the art in man/machine communications. The study involved the development and demonstration of both hardware and software to effectively implement man/computer interactive channels of communication. While tactile and visual man/computer communications equipment are standard methods of interaction with machines, man's speech is a natural media for inquiry and control. As part of this study, a word recognition unit was developed capable of recognizing a minimum of one hundred different words or sentences in any one of the currently used conversational languages. The study has proven that efficiency in communication between man and computer can be achieved when the vocabulary to be used is structured in a manner compatible with the rigid communication requirements of the machine while at the same time responsive to the informational needs of the man.\n\nWhat Is Business Japanese?

N.; Goebert, Deborah A.; Nishimura, Stephanie T.; Hishinuma, Earl S.; Andrade, Naleen N.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFew studies have examined the effect of ethnicity and cultural identity on substance use among Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents. A cross-sequential study conducted in Hawai'i with 144 Japanese American and part-Japanese American adolescents assessed a model integrating Japanese ethnicity, cultural identity, substance use, major life events, and social support. Japanese American adolescents scored higher on the Japanese Culture Scale and on the Peersâ Social Support than the part-Japanese American adolescents. Significant associations for substance use and impairment included culturally intensified events and Japanese cultural identity- behavior subset. Models had good overall fits and suggested that conflict surrounding cultural identity may contribute to substance use.

They were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion experienced, and to select the corresponding facial expression to display in an individual situation and in a social situation. Analyses of covariance were conducted on the rating scores of facial expression using the intensities of emotion as the covariance, except for happiness where the within-class regression coefficients were not homogeneous. The results showed that Japanese and Koreans shared the emotional display rules about the expressions of emotions in individual situations more than in social situations. Japanese thought that they should suppress emotions more than Koreans did. Moreover, the differences in facial expressions between Japanese and Koreans were greater in the individual situations than in the social situations.\n\nEpidemiologic studies on possible health effects of intake of pyrolyzates of foods, with reference to mortality among Japanese Seventh-Day Adventists.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuratsune, M; Ikeda, M; Hayashi, T\n\n1986-01-01\n\nTo elucidate the effect of intake of mutagenic and/or carcinogenic pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids on carcinogenesis in man, we have undertaken two epidemiologic cohort studies: one concerning the possible association of broiled fish consumption with cancer and the other concerning the cancer mortality among Japanese Seventh-Day Adventists.

In the present study, we cross-sectionally examined whether adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines is associated with metabolic risk factors in 1083 Japanese women aged 18-22 years. Based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top, adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines was assessed using dietary information on consumed servings of grain dishes, vegetable dishes, fish and meat dishes, milk and fruits and energy from snacks and alcoholic beverages during the preceding month, which was derived from a comprehensive diet history questionnaire. Higher dietary adherence was associated with higher intakes of protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, Na, K and vitamin C, and lower intakes of total and saturated fat. There was also an inverse association between dietary adherence and dietary energy density. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, dietary adherence was inversely associated with waist circumference (P for trend = 0Â·002). It also showed an inverse association with LDL-cholesterol concentrations (P for trend = 0Â·04). There was no association with the other metabolic risk factors examined, including BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, TAG, glucose, glycated Hb and insulin concentrations. In conclusion, higher adherence to the food-based Japanese dietary guidelines, which was characterised by favourable dietary intakes of foods and nutrients as well as lower energy density, was associated with lower waist circumference and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in this group of young Japanese women.\n\nClinical presentation and outcome of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in a Japanese sample.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakai, Yoshikatsu; Nin, Kazuko; Noma, Shun'ichi; Hamagaki, Seiji; Takagi, Ryuro; Teramukai, Satoshi; Wonderlich, Stephen A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe conducted a study of the clinical presentation and outcome in patients with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aged 15-40years, and compared this group to an anorexia nervosa (AN) group in a Japanese sample. A retrospective chart review was completed on 245 patients with feeding and eating disorders (FEDs), analyzing prevalence, clinical presentation, psychopathological properties, and outcomes. Using the DSM-5 criteria, 27 (11.0%) out of the 245 patients with a FED met the criteria for ARFID at entry. All patients with ARFID were women. In terms of eating disorder symptoms, all patients with ARFID had restrictive eating related to emotional problems and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. However, none of the ARFID patients reported food avoidance related to sensory characteristics or functional dysphagia. Additionally, none of them exhibited binge eating or purging behaviors, and none of them reported excessive exercise. The ARFID group had a significantly shorter duration of illness, lower rates of admission history, and less severe psychopathology than the AN group. The ARFID group reported significantly better outcome results than the AN group. These results suggest that patients with ARFID in this study were clinically distinct from those with AN and somewhat different from pediatric patients with ARFID in previous studies.

Each athlete performed a 30-second WAnT with a resistance equal to 7.5% of his or her body weight. Genotyping for the ACTN3 R577X (rs1815739) polymorphism was performed using the TaqMan approach. The ACTN3 R577X genotypes exhibited a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium distribution in our population. The relative and absolute mean power results of the 30-second WAnT did not differ significantly among the genotypes. However, the relative peak power result of the WAnT was significantly higher in the R-allele-dominant model groups than in the XX group in male but not female athletes. These results suggest that the ACTN3 R allele is associated with the relative peak power during the WAnT in male Japanese collegiate athletes.\n\nThe Anglo-Japanese Alliance and Japanese Expansionism 1902-1923.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-06-05\n\nAlienation 1919-1952.

[man machine interaction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNicogossian, A. E.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nMan's ability to live and perform useful work in space was demonstrated throughout the history of manned space flight. Current planning envisions a multi-functional space station. Man's unique abilities to respond to the unforeseen and to operate at a level of complexity exceeding any reasonable amount of previous planning distinguish him from present day machines. His limitations, however, include his inherent inability to survive without protection, his limited strength, and his propensity to make mistakes when performing repetitive and monotonous tasks. By contrast, an automated system does routine and delicate tasks, exerts force smoothly and precisely, stores, and recalls large amounts of data, and performs deductive reasoning while maintaining a relative insensitivity to the environment. The establishment of a permanent presence of man in space demands that man and machines be appropriately combined in spaceborne systems. To achieve this optimal combination, research is needed in such diverse fields as artificial intelligence, robotics, behavioral psychology, economics, and human factors engineering.\n\n[An outbreak of Legionnaire's disease associated with a Japanese spa].\n\nPubMed\n\nNakadate, T; Yamauchi, K; Inoue, H\n\n1999-08-01\n\nFrom June 24 to July 5, 1996, 3 patients were admitted to the same hospital with atypical pneumonia. One of the patients, a 52-year-old man, demonstrated progressive pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia, and finally required mechanical ventilation. All 3 patients had elevated antibody titers for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, and had visited the same spa prior to the onset of their symptoms. On September 25, 1996 the district health department inspected the spa, and isolated Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 from the facility's hot water tanks and outlets. Although it has been reported that many spas in Japan are contaminated with Legionellaceae, the outbreak we encountered suggests that Japanese spas, like whirlpool spas in Europe and North America, can be a source of Legionnaire's disease.\n\nA painful pulsatile abdominal mass in a young man with elevated blood pressures: an unusual presentation of phaeochromocytoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, B M K; Ti, L K\n\n2002-08-01\n\nWe report an unusual presentation of phaeochromocytoma in a young man with a painful, pulsatile abdominal mass and elevated blood pressures. This led to a delay in diagnosis and resulted in the administration of triggers of catecholamine release, possibly causing a catecholamine surge. This caused the development of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and multiple organ failure, requiring inotropic and ventilatory support, intra-aortic balloon pump and dialysis. Fortunately, his condition reversed with supportive treatment and alpha-adrenergic blockade. This illustrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion of phaeochromocytoma, especially in young patients with elevated blood pressures.\n\nManned Mars Mission program concepts\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamilton, E.

The results, to date, indicate the need for an earth-to-orbit transportation system much larger than the present STS, reliable long-life support systems, and either advanced propulsion or aerobraking technology.\n\nAmericans and Japanese Nonverbal Communication. Linguistic Communications 15 (Papers in Japanese Linguistics 3).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTaylor, Harvey M.\n\nEach culture has its own nonverbal as well as its verbal language. Movements, gestures and sounds have distinct and often conflicting interpretations in different countries. For Americans communicating with Japanese, misunderstandings are of two types: Japanese behavior which is completely new to the American, and Japanese behavior which isâ¦\n\nDetraditionalisation: Japanese Students in the USA.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nUeno, Junko\n\n2001-01-01\n\nFocuses on the identity formation of Japanese students temporarily living in the United States. The students were enrolled in Japanese Saturday school and in American public schools. Student interviews reveal a mixture of Japanese and American characteristics. Suggests Japanese students do not reject either culture--Japanese or American--but thatâ¦\n\nSpace Station man-machine automation trade-off analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZimmerman, W. F.; Bard, J.; Feinberg, A.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe man machine automation tradeoff methodology presented is of four research tasks comprising the autonomous spacecraft system technology (ASST) project. ASST was established to identify and study system level design problems for autonomous spacecraft. Using the Space Station as an example spacecraft system requiring a certain level of autonomous control, a system level, man machine automation tradeoff methodology is presented that: (1) optimizes man machine mixes for different ground and on orbit crew functions subject to cost, safety, weight, power, and reliability constraints, and (2) plots the best incorporation plan for new, emerging technologies by weighing cost, relative availability, reliability, safety, importance to out year missions, and ease of retrofit. A fairly straightforward approach is taken by the methodology to valuing human productivity, it is still sensitive to the important subtleties associated with designing a well integrated, man machine system. These subtleties include considerations such as crew preference to retain certain spacecraft control functions; or valuing human integration/decision capabilities over equivalent hardware/software where appropriate.\n\nMan-in-the-control-loop simulation of manipulators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCh"
