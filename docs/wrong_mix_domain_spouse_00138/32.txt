A Kobe Municipal Assembly member recently in the spotlight for his reported affair with singer-turned-lawmaker Eriko Imai said Monday he will resign following allegations he falsified expense claims.

"I am keenly aware of my responsibility and I should not cause further confusion in the assembly by remaining a member," Ken Hashimoto, 37, said in a statement submitted to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party faction he belongs to.

He plans to tender his resignation Tuesday, the chair of the assembly said.
