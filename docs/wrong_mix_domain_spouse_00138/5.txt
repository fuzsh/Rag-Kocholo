Information

Introduction & Start of Solo under Eriko with Crunch in 2000

Imai Eriko is the second youngest member in SPEED. She was born in Okinawa and was one of the main vocals in the group. After SPEED popularity spread widely in Japan, they were ask to act in a movie Andromedia 1998, which begins Eriko acting career. Eriko also attempt acting in a drama LxIxVxE in 1999 with fellow SPEED member Arakaki Hitoe. When Eriko began her real solo debut career in early 2000, she merged with the dance group Crunch and were named Eriko with Crunch. Their first two maxi singles, Red Beat of My Life and Luv Is Magic were released the same year. Imai's style of music is rockish pop, which suits her voice, but she also sang ballads and slow numbers as well, not forgetting her attempt at rapping in Don't Stop the Music.

Begin of Eriko Imai in 2000

The group Eriko with Crunch didn't last long, she went on without them and pursue her solo career starting from single in the Name of Love using the title Eriko Imai. Since then before her marriage in 2004, she released 6 singles, 1 album & 1 single collection album under Eriko imai. Also during this year, Eriko did her first Musical challenge Hinotori, which earn her a Best New Comer in Theater in Golden Arrow Awards 2001.

Her fourth single, "Identity", is viewed as a declining point in Imai's career. Many viewed the music as hard-core rock. Moreover, in the promotion of the music, she remarked "Many artists these days succeed by popularity, not by hard work." Imai's comment was perceived to be a criticism of Morning Musume and triggered a wave of criticism toward her. After "Identity" and her criticism-engendering comments, Imai's CD sales fell to below 50,000 copies. Her fifth single, "Set Me Free!", was filmed in Australia and she performed it in Kuala Lumpur during the 2001 Asia Music Festival. Afterwards, she released her first album, "My Place". Including her self-composed songs "Himawari" and "Dawn", it sold 93,700 copies and was ranked in the top 5 but utimately placed at #7 for the weekly sales.

Imai 6th "Don't Stop the Music" was aired in Imai's weekly Monday night radio talk show by TBS 954, "Eriko Imai Hotlink" more than a month before its release in January 2002. "Don't Stop the Music" was seen as a change of genre in Imai's music. At around this time, Imai considered changing her hairstyle to an Afro-style. She said that she wanted something new, but was willing to return to a more Japanese-typical hairstyle if the Afro hairstyle reduced her appeal. In July, Imai released her 7th single "Our Relation" which was a upbeat fast tempo ballad. "Our Relation" was the 2nd single to be fully produced by Hiroaki Hayama. During this year, Imai was in her 2nd musical Footloose with V6 Sakamoto Masayuki, this was a extremely musical took from overseas.

As from the end of 2002 to mid 2003, Imai did not have any solo release. Mainly due to the temporary formation of SPEED for a fund raise charity Save The Children. SPEED became the ambassador of Save the Children from early mid to end of 2003 which they did Nationwide Tours & releasing of singles & album to raise funds for the charity. It was not until July, Imai released her 8th and last single before her marriage "Butterfly". "Butterfly" was a slight mid tempo ballad which the lyrics was written by Imai under the name of elly. This is also the first time she officially uses elly on her works. Butterfly was also the theme song for anime movie Boku no Songoku, which Imai first participated in dubbing one of the character.
