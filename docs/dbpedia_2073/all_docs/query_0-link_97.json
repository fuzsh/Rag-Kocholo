You may use your PC, Laptop, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android phone or other mobil phone etc. to purchase it and read it with Amazon Cloud Reader (it's a free software) thru your PC, Laptop, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android phone or other mobil phone etc.\n\nIt also provides special instructions for people located in China or certain other foreign countries.\n\nCalligraphy images referred by the book may be freely copied from this website for educational or noncommercial positive purposes (i.e., no gambling or pornography, etc.) with an attributional reference to \"Marie Sun and Alex Sun or at MarieSun.com\" ; other uses require explicit, written authorization by Marie Sun.\n\nPreface\n\nThis book is dedicated to the memory of Marie's dear parents, Mr. Tieqing Luo (ç¾ éµéå ç) and Ms. Wu Ma (é¦¬å¿å¥³å£«), who inspired Marie's early interest in and appreciation of Tang poetry and Chinese calligraphy.\n\nThe book is structured differently from any other book on Tang poetry. Rather than simply providing a translated poem in isolation, it provides in-depth historical and cultural background information surrounding the poem, accompanied by multimedia links to maps, images, and/or videos scripts, including recitations in Mandarin for each of the 25 poems. In this way, the reader can more fully understand and appreciate all the nuances of the poem in its Chinese cultural context.\n\nIn particular, this book provides information regarding Tang era social structures, key turning points relating to the rise and fall of the Tang Dynasty, and the political machinations of imperial court life -- all of which informed the narrative of Tang poetry. Of particular note is one singularly key figure of the Tang era -- Emperor Tang Ming Huang, who promoted poetry during his reign and led to its Golden age in Chinese history.\n\nIn keeping with the old adage that \"a picture is worth a thousand words,\" image/video links are provided from time to time to accompany a poem to help put it in context:\n\nThe Great Wall thru Google,\n\nSection of Silk Road in the desert thru Yahoo,\n\nHanging coffin thru Baidu, and\n\nInstalling coffin on towering cliff face thru YouTube, etc.\n\nAfter more than 1,000 years of weather and war, the structures above may no longer retain all of their original glory, yet they still hint at the grandeur of a bygone golden era.\n\nThe beauty of Tang poems is that they can evoke precise visions in an efficient conservation of words, forged into a euphonious stream of rhyme and cadence. These poems represent, and are witness to, archetypical human emotions and pondering reflecting the glory, passion, and tears of a unique era in Chinese history.\n\nIf you are not familiar with âthe history of the âTang, ââI encourage you toâ firstâ readâ Chapter 2 â-â The Historical Path that Led Tang to Glorây or at MarieSun.com Chapter 2 - The Historical Path ... before continuingâ with the rest of the bookâ. The mood and subject matter of âTang poeâtry tended to reflect the relative âstrength and status of the âstateâ, such that a knowledge of the political history of the dynasty will give you more insight into the poetry.â\n\n* * *\n\nWhen translating Tang poems into English, the poems' forms, cadences, and rhyming schemes are naturally difficult to replicate precisely. This book attempts to retain the poems' original charm, flavor, and soul, while adhering as closely as possible to those original forms, cadence, and rhyming schemes.\n\nThe essentialist, ambiguous, and rhythmic spirit of Chinese poems is often lost in flourished occidental translations trying to explain and make sense of too much. Chinese poems are often purposely designed to be ambiguous or open to interpretation. For example, in most cases, there is no overt subject in Chinese poems, though the first person viewpoint is usually understood. Thus, the subject \"I\" is often inserted as the assumed viewpoint in occidental translations. This book attempts to avoid such assumptions except in the most obvious cases.\n\nI hope you will find pleasure and enjoyment in perusing this book, and that you will engage in interpreting the poems you come across in your own way and share them with your friends.\n\n* * *\n\nThe co-author, Alex Sun, was invited by his dear grandparents, Mr. Teiqing Luo and Ms. Wu Ma, to study Chinese in Taipei, Taiwan at age 12. Alex's natural interest in learning different languages and cultures, along with his immersion for 2 years in Chinese-speaking communities (studying another year at Beijing University in China), proved an immeasurable help in producing this book.\n\nAn enormous thanks also goes out to Scott Shay, a computer expert and linguist who has authored several college textbook from www.amazon.com/Scott-Shay/e/B002BLS206. With his help, we have been able to publish our first eBook. Also thanks to Benjie Sun for his editorial help and Chung-Li Sun for his spiritual support.\n\nCopyright\n\nAll rights reserved.

Subsequent chapters provided further general historical and background information.\n\nIn Chapter 1, the following information is provided for each poem:\n\n(1). A brief biography of each poet, except for Li Bai and Du Fu, who are described in more detail, due to their seminal influence in the East Asian poetry world (in addition, there is an entire chapter devoted to Tang Ming Huang, the Emperor patron of poetry).\n\n(2). Representation of each poem in xingshu è¡ä¹¦ calligraphy; in addition, 12 poems are also presented in zhuanshu ç¯ä¹¦ calligraphy.\n\n(3). Both traditional and simplified Chinese forms of the poem with pinyin annotations\n\n(4). Recitation in mandarin for each poem\n\n(5). Comments on the historical backdrop of the poem\n\n(6). A glossary of terms and names mentioned in the poem\n\n(7). images or videos relating to the poem or poet\n\nAbout the Poems:\n\nThe 25 poems covered in this book are chosen out of the most popular Chinese poetry anthology of all time, namely, \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\" \"åè¯ä¸ç¾é¦\" compiled by Sun Zhu å­æ´ (1711 - 1778). âMost of the poems are presented after a brief biography of the poet. âBecause of the extensive background information being provided for Li Bai â and Du Fu â, however, their sections are arranged a little differently; most of their poems are presented at key points in their biographical narratives that inspired the given poem.\n\nExcept for Meng Haoran, Li Bai, and Du Fu, all poets are listed roughly in chronological order.\n\nChapters\n\n1. Poets and Poems\n\n(1). Meng Haoran å­æµ©ç¶\n\nMeng Hao'ran (689 or 691 - 740; lived during the Early and High Tang periods), a descendant of Meng Zi å­å­ (also known as Mencius, the famous Confucian philosopher) and grandfather of poet Meng Jiao å­é, was born in Xiangyang è¥é³ by the Han æ± River in Hubei Province æ¹åç (Hubei, literally \"lake æ¹ north å\". The city is located to the north of Dongting Lake æ´åº­æ¹ along the Yangtze River æ¬å­æ±/é¿æ±).\n\nMeng was a famous landscape poet. Fifteen of his poems are included in the anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems.\"\n\nHe sat for the imperial examination ç§ä¸¾, attempting to attain the degree title of \"jinshi\" è¿å£« at age 40, but failed. After his brief pursuit of a career as a local official, he mainly lived in and wrote about the area in which he was born and raised. The local landscape, history, and legends were the subjects of his many poems. So, too, were his journeys.\n\nMore than 10 years Li Bai's senior (and Li Bai's idol), he befriended Li in later adulthood. Meng also befriended Wang Wei çç»´, Wang Changling çæé½¡, and Wang Zhihuan çä¹æ¶£, among other poets. Li Bai wrote many poems in admiration of Meng, among which are two famous ones -- \"Presentation to Meng Haoran\", and \"Seeing Men Haoran off at Yellow Crane Tower\". The latter is included in this book.\n\nMeng Haoran, as a prominent landscape poet, had a major influence on poetry in the Early Tang era. This influence also extended into neighboring Asian countries, especially Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\n* * *\n\nIn ancient times, writings were engraved into stone slabs or \"steles\" in order to preserve their beauty. Others could then duplicate them through stone rubbings. Such duplicate copies were called taben ææ¬ (pinyin: tÃ bÄn, stone rubbing).\n\nCreating a taben stone rubbing: View video thru www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIVD__IHTv0 (38 seconds) or select one thru YouTube.\n\nThroughout this book, the poems presented as images follow the traditional Chinese manner - written in vertical columns from top to bottom and from right to left without punctuation. However, the rest of the contents are presented in the \"modern\" western approach, with characters in horizontal rows from left to right, with occasional punctuation.\n\ncalligraphy in xingshu è¡ä¹¦ calligraphy:\n\ncalligraphy in zhuanshu/zhuanzi ç¯ä¹¦/ç¯å­ calligraphy:\n\npoem #01\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\næ¥æ Â å­æµ©ç¶ Â\n\næ¥ç ä¸è¦ºæï¼èèèå¼é³¥ãÂ\n\nå¤ä¾é¢¨é¨è²ï¼è±è½ç¥å¤å°ã\n\nSimplified Chinese with *pinyin\n\næ¥ æ Â å­ æµ© ç¶ Â\n\nchÅ«n xiÇo mÃ¨ng hÃ o rÃ¡n\n\næ¥ ç ä¸ è§ æï¼ å¤ å¤ é» å¼ é¸ãÂ\n\nchÅ«n miÃ¡n bÃ¹ juÃ© xiÇo, chÃ¹ chÃ¹ wÃ©n tÃ­ niÇo.\n\nå¤ æ¥ é£ é¨ å£°ï¼ è± è½ ç¥ å¤ å°ãÂ\n\nyÃ¨ lÃ¡i fÄng yÇ shÄng, huÄ luÃ² zhÄ« duÅ shÇo.Â\n\n* Recitation 1 Recitation 2\n\nNotes *:\n\nRecitation 1: Click it to listen to a recitation of the poem in Mandarin Chinese and to view a transliteration into pinyin through Google. If click twice on the speak icon, it will recite at a slower pace.\n\nRecitation 2: Click and select one of the options to listen to a recitation.\n\n*pinyin æ¼é³\n\nEach Chinese Character has only one syllable. There are about 50,000 Chinese characters (a person need only master two to three thousand, however, to be able to read newspapers) and tones are often used to differentiate words from each other.

Li Bai æç½\n\nLi Bai (701 - 762; lived mostly in the High Tang period and only a few years into the beginning of Mid Tang period), the most famous romantic poet in Chinese history, penned numerous masterpieces that are still memorized and chanted by Chinese of all ages today. He went by many names; his most popular and well-known title being Shi Xian è¯ä» - \"the Poet Immortal\" or \"the Poet Transcendentâ. His name has also been romanticized as Li Po or Li Bo. Thirty-four of Li Bai's poems are included in the popular anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems,\" second only to Du Fu's thirty-nine poems.\n\nLi Bai's ancestors were from Longxi, Chengji éè¥¿, æçºª, in present-day northern Qinan county, Gansu Province ç§¦å®å¿å, çèç. They were banished to Tiaozhi æ¡æ in the Western Regions è¥¿å, today's Central Asia, during the Sui Dynasty by the Sui ruler.\n\nAs for Li Bai's birth place, according to Guo Moruo é­æ²«è¥, a historian and ancient writing scholar, Li Bai's ancestors moved from Tiaozhi to a prosperous silk trading city Suiye ç¢å¶, also in Central Asia, within the Ansi Protectorate å®è¥¿é½æ¤åº, and Li Bai was born over there. Suiye was also known as Suyab, once a flourishing trading city on the Silk Road and now an archaeological site in modern day Ak-Beshim, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nView present-day Ak-Beshim (Suiye) in Kyrgyzstan thru Google or Yahoo. View details regarding Ak-Beshim: Wikipedia.\n\nLi Bai's father, Li Ke æå®¢, was probably a very successful merchant, since the family was installed in one of the thriving commercial centers of the empire. In 705, Li's father moved the family back to China and settled down in Jiangyou, Sichuan Province æ±æ²¹, åå·ç. ( View Jiangyou thru Google or Baidu.)

He was also skilled in swordsmanship.\n\nHis place of birth, his tall girth, and his angular facial features, suggested that he was possibly of mixed race. It was said that he was conversant in at least one foreign language due to his background and upbringing.\n\nIn 725 at age 24, Li Bai left his second hometown, Jianyou, to explore the world. Being young, ambitious, and without financial constraint, he embarked on a knight-errant-like journey. Heading east down the Yangtze River, while passing through the Jingmen Gorge, he left behind a beautiful poem \"Bid Farewell at Jingmen\" èé¨éå«. He explored Jiangling æ±éµ in Hubei æ¹å Province, Dongting Lake æ´åº­æ¹ in Hunan æ¹å Province, Mount Lu åºå±± in Jiangxi æ±è¥¿ Province, and Jingling ééµ (present-day Nanjing åäº¬) in Jiangsu æ±è Province. Along the way he met and befriended various poets and social elites, including Meng Haoran, who Li Bai had long admired.

Li Bai managed to travel to present-day Wuchang city in Hubei Province æ­¦æå¸, æ¹åç to meet with Meng for several days of adventure, after which they parted at the nearby Yellow Crane Tower. Li Bai wrote this famous poem describing the melancholic nature of his idol's departure.\n\nThe poem is filled with affection and paints a vision of a brilliant spring day pushed to the horizon by the endless and powerful Yangtze River. It is a vision and a force that also carries away the ardent heart of the poet as he watches his idol's lone boat vanish into the distant horizon.\n\nYangzhou (marked as number 1) is located near the eastern terminus of the Yangtze River.

Li, at age 26, was young, handsome, and well-built. He excelled at both swordsmanship and literature, and had about him a chivalrous and gentlemanly demeanor. A budding poet, he was well-received by Xu's family and eventually married the former Prime Minister's granddaughter, Xu Ziyan è®¸ç´«ç. The couple settled down at Peach-flower Rock, near Li's in-laws in present-day Anlu, Hubei Province å®é¸, æ¹åç. Although Li Bai would travel from time to time or take short mountain sabbaticals (to enhance study and reflection) for the purposes of obtaining a position in the imperial court, the couple led a content married life with little financial burden, with Xu Ziyian bearing a daughter, Li Pingyang æå¹³é³, and a son, Li Boqin æä¼¯ç¦½.\n\nWhile away from home, Li Bai wrote many letters and poems to his wife to express his loneliness and longings, some of which were very witty and humorous.\n\nThe blessed marriage lasted for 12 years. In 740, Xu Ziyian passed away. Since several of Li's close relatives lived in Renchen ä»»å, located on the south side of present-day Jiling city, Shandong Province æµå®å¸, å±±æ±ç, Li Bai moved his family there. This was not far from Lu county, where Confucius' hometown is located.\n\nAfter settling down at Renchen, Li Bai managed to spend some time living in seclusion with five other hermits on Mt. Culai å¾å¾å±± ( view Mt. Culai thru Google or Baidu). They settled by a scenic brook in a bamboo forest, and hence the six of them earned a collective name - \"The Six Hermits of Leisure of the Bamboo Brook\" ç«¹æºªå ­é¸. Needless to say, Li Bai spiritually enjoyed his time there, taking in the surrounding mountain scenery, drinking wine, enjoying tea, playing music, practicing his fencing, and especially chanting poems together with his like-minded companions. While living on Culai Mountain, Li Bai continued to maintain contact with the local intelligentsia and gentry through letters and visits in order to get his name heard. This was the fashion during Tang Dynasty for ambitious scholars to obtain a central government appointment in the imperial court. Li Bai lived on Culai Mountain intermittently on three separate occasions.\n\nMt. Culai, the sister mountain of Mt. Tai æ³°å±±, lies about 12.5 mi/20 km to the southeast of Mount Tai. In Chinese âfeudal âtradition, emperors would come to this area atop Mt. Tai and hold Heaven-and-Earth worship ceremonies ç¥­å¤©ç¥­å°, also called fÄngchÃ¡n å°ç¦ , â during prosperous periodsâ to pay gratitude âtoâ Heaven and Earth. Another main purpose was to âjustify and reifyââ âtheirâ â\"âsuperpowerâ\"â and authority âover their people. After the ceremony, âthe emperors would also often stop at nearby Qufu æ²é in Lu county, the birthplace of Confucius, to hold a ceremony honoring him ç¥­å­å¤§å ¸. Early in the Han Dynasty, Emperor Han Wudi æ±æ­¦å¸ had paid three visits to the area, performing the aforementioned ceremonies. Several Tang emperors did so as well. Emperor Tang Ming Huang performed the ceremonies for the first and only time in 725, the year Li Bai was just stepping out of Sichuan to explore the world. While holding ceremony in Lu county, Tang Ming Huang composed a poem called \"Passing through Zou Lu âand offering a sacrifice to ââConfucius with a âsâigâhâ\" \"ç»é¹é²ââç¥­å­å­èå¹ä¹\"â. This is the only poem âby the emperor, himself, that is included in the anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\".\n\nLiving on nearby Culai Mountain and cultivating a reputation as a learned, self-sufficient, capable man, Li Bai provided himself the chance of being recognized and introduced to the Tang emperor during these ceremonies and would have had the opportunity to be possibly \"fast track\" into the imperial service.\n\nBefore his wife passed away, Li had lived in seclusion on several other mountains as well. One of these was Zhongnan Mountain çµåå±± ( view the mountain, hermits and monks thru Google or Baidu,) about 10 miles south of the Tang capital of Chang'an. He lived there around age 29 for less than a year. During the early Tang, the famous scholar hermit Lu Cangyong å¢èç¨ lived on this same mountain and was called in by Empress Wu Zetian æ­¦åå¤© to work for the central government. Lu began at the position of a remonstrative official - Zuoshiyi å·¦æ¾é ( duties of remonstrative officials in the Tang Dynasty and rank schedule of the imperial civil service system), working his way up quickly to the Shangshu-Youcheng å°ä¹¦å³ä¸ level, i.e., almost to the position of prime minister. This is the origin of the Chinese idiom \"Zhongnan Fast Track\" \"ç»åæ·å¾\". Li Bai, however, did not meet with such fortune on Zhongnan Mountain.\n\nIn 742, HÃ¨ Zhizhang è³ç¥ç« , about 83 years old at the time a leading light of literature and high-level imperial official, read Li's poems, marveled at his literary talent, and praised Li Bai as the \"Transcendent Dismissed from Heaven\" or \"Immortal Exiled from Heaven\" \"è¬«ä»äºº\". From this point forward the acclamation \"Li Bai, the 'Transcendent Dismissed from Heaven' \" began to spread throughout the empire. And the two cemented the bond of a lifelong friendship.\n\nIn the late summer of the same year, Emperor Tang Ming Huang, who had caught wind of Li Bai's reputation, summoned him to the the capital Chang'an for an audience. From Li Bai's home to Chang'an was nearly a distance of 600 mi/965 km, as the crow flies. Li did not arrive until the autumn.\n\nEmperor Tang Ming Huang, an expert on military strategy who also excelled at literature, greeted Li Bai at the Grand Palace in person. During the banquet, Li's personality, wit, and political views fascinated Tang Ming Huang. The emperor even personally seasoned the soup for Li Bai.\n\nThe next year, Li Bai was assigned a Hanlin ç¿°æ position at the Hanlin Academy ç¿°æå­¦é¢ within the imperial court and appointed the state Grand Secretary. As a result of the emperor's favor, Li was never required to take the imperial examination to attain the title of jinshi, a usual prerequisite for selection and assignment to a Hanlin position. Indeed, Li Bai never attempted to take the imperial examination at all. It was rumored that this was because his ancestors had been banished to Central Asia for some kind of crime. The norm at the time was that offspring of criminals were automatically disqualified from taking the exam, but his ancestors were banished in the Sui Dynasty (581 - 618) and the Sui was overthrown by the Tang in 618, some 80 years before Li Bai was born!\n\nBeing from a merchant family also would have disqualified him from taking the imperial examination, though. This policy was adopted most likely to prevent collusion between government employees and businessmen. But in reality, this policy was never consistently implemented. Highly wealthy merchants could always circumvent the rules and secure important government positions. One such example was Wu Shiyue æ­¦å£«å½ , a successful lumber businessman with good connections to the Tang royal family, who secured several important government positions early during the dynasty and indirectly helped his daughter - Wu Zetian æ­¦åå¤© âusurpâ the throne. This regulation was eventually repealed by the following Song (Sung) Dynasty å®æ, and almost all classes of males (and only males) were thereafter permitted to take the exam. In any event, during Li Bai's lifetime he often broke from convention and followed his own path.\n\nIn the beginning, Li led a fairly pleasant life at court. The famous verse \"Guifei grinding ink, Lishi pulling off boots\" \"è´µå¦ç£¨å¢¨, åå£«è±é´\" describes this period. It depicts Yang Guifei æ¥è²´å¦, Tang Ming Huang's most adored consort, grinding Chinese black inksticks into ink for Li to pen down a poem, while Gao Lishi é«åå£«, Tang Ming Huang's favorite eunuch å®¦å®, (and the most politically powerful figure in the palace), assists in pulling off Li's snow stained boots under Tang Ming Huang's request. All to facilitate Liâs comfort and creative genius. It was also suggested that whenever Li Bai published a new poem, there would be a run on paper in Chang'an, sending the price soaring, with everyone rushing out to obtain copies of his new work.\n\nLi's main duty was to handle secretarial works and record tasks for Tang Ming Huang, which included accompanying Tang Ming Huang to important ceremonies and festivities and documenting them. Tang Ming Huang probably intended that through Li's exquisite writing, the records of his reign would be of particular interest to future historians and scholars.\n\nA secondary duty assigned to Li was composing poetry for the emperor. This resulted in the following poem, Qing Ping Ballad, which is a flattering and fawning piece about Yang Guifei and reflects the desires of Tang Ming Huang.\n\npoem #03\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\næ¸ å¹³èª¿ä¹ä¸ æç½\n\né²æ³è¡£è£³è±æ³å®¹ï¼ æ¥é¢¨ææª»é²è¯æ¿ã\n\nè¥éç¾¤çå±±é ­è¦ï¼ æåç¤èºæä¸é¢ã\n\nSimplified Chinese with pinyin\n\næ¸ å¹³ è° ä¹ ä¸ æ ç½\n\nqÄ«ng pÃ­ng diÃ o cÃ­ zhÄ« yÄ« lÇ bÃ¡i\n\näº æ³ è¡£ è£³ è± æ³ å®¹ï¼\n\nyÃºn xiÇng yÄ« shang huÄ xiÇng rÃ³ng,\n\næ¥ é£ æ æ§ é² å æµã\n\nchÅ«n fÄng fÃº kÇn lÃ¹ huÃ¡ nÃ³ng.\n\nè¥ é ç¾¤ ç å±± å¤´ è§ï¼\n\nruÃ² fÄi qÃºn yÃ¹ shÄn tÃ³u jiÃ n,\n\nä¼ å ç¶ å° æ ä¸ é¢ã\n\nhuÃ¬ xiÃ ng yÃ¡o tÃ¡i yuÃ¨ xiÃ fÃ©ng.\n\nRecitation 1 Recitation 2\n\nQing Ping Ballad ( 1 ) Li Bai\n\nA dress imagined by clouds, a look imagined by flowers,\n\nSpring breezes caress the threshold, a lustrous dew showers;\n\nIf no meeting occurs at the cluster of Jade Mountain peaks,\n\nThen rendezvous at Jade Pavilion in the moonlight hours.\n\n* * *\n\nThis was written at Sinking Incense Pavilion æ²é¦äº­ as Tang Ming Huang and Yang Guifei wandered among the *peonies -- highly regarded ornamental flowers in Chinese tradition. At Tang Ming Huang's request, Li Bai wrote three poems -- Qing Ping Ballads I, II and III on that day. After each poem was completed, the court orchestra would accompany a chanting of it for the audiences to enjoy. The multi-talented Tang Ming Huang also appreciated music and had a talent for composing, but unfortunately none of his works are extant.\n\nIn Qing Ping Ballad I, Li Bai metaphorically describes Yang Guifei's charms and the indulgent pampering she enjoyed from the emperor. The locations that Li Bai describes in the poem - Jade Mountain and Jade Pavilion - were inhabited by fairies in Chinese folklore, implying that Yang was a creature from an otherworldly realm. Yang had indeed been living in a fairy tale for 12 years, indulging in an extremely extravagant life style, courtesy of Tang Ming Huang. What she could not have imagined was the unexpected and tragic fate that awaited her.\n\nâDefinitions and âInterpretation of Characters, Terms, and Names:\n\næ¸ å¹³ è° è¯ ä¹ ä¸: One of the Qing Ping Ballads ä¹ ä¸: one of it\n\näº: cloud æ³: think, consider, speculate è¡£è£³: clothes è±: flower å®¹: looks, appearance, figure, formï¼\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nAfter working for nearly two years at the imperial court, the incompatibility of Li's personality with court life began to take its toll, as Li was never one to be bound or driven by secular rules.\n\nDetesting the political machinations, and having his advice ignored by Tang Ming Huang, Li doubted if it was in his best interest to remain at the court. During this period, the treacherous Prime Minister Li Linfu ææç« held tremendous political power, running the country by himself and pushing aside all other capable individuals and potential rivals. All the while, Tang Ming Huang spent most of his time and energy indulging in a lascivious lifestyle with Consort Yang Guefei. More importantly, it was rumored that the eunuch Gao Lishi had always felt that being forced to pull off Li Bai's boots was exceedingly humiliating. So he started to badmouth Li Bai to Yang Guifei. He asserted that it was inappropriate for Li Bai to have compared her beauty to that of consort Zhao Yanfei in his second poem \"Qing Ping Ballad #2\". Zhao was originally of very low birth and status. She was a consort of Emperor Han Chengdi during the Han Dynasty, and was famous for her beauty and slender waist; in contrast, Yang's great-great-grandfather had been a key official during the previous Sui dynasty, and she had a plump figure, which was the fashion of the Tang Dynasty. Both were consorts doted on by the emperors of their times.\n\nGao Lishi had been given command of the imperial military forces and had defeated several adversaries in the power struggle for Tang Ming Huang to win the kingdom back for Tang Ming Huang's father. Having established meritorious achievements, he was conferred with the rank of Biaoqi Great General éª éªå¤§å°å (4th level in military service systems) by Tang Ming Huang, thus holding substantial imperial court military power in addition to political power. He was the favorite eunuch of Tang Ming Huang and even the powerful Prime Minister Li Linfu sometimes publicly flattered him. With such a cast of powerful officials potentially arrayed against him, Li Bai saw the writing on the wall.\n\nIn traditional Chinese culture, the most glorious purpose in life was to pursue meritorious honor and fame åå (pinyin: gÅng mÃ­ng) in the imperial bureaucratic system. To be able to gain societal recognition in making one's mark on the people and the country was considered of the highest honor. Yet the quality and nature of being a great imperial statesman are quite different from that of being a successful poet, especially a romantic poet. Li finally had an epiphany and abandoned the traditionally defined path to success. Like a fabulous bird, he required an expansive space to fly and soar and not be bound in a golden cage. Hence, his poems began to reflect his desire to leave his bureaucratic mission.\n\nRecognizing that Li Bai was unwilling to continue serving in the court, Tang Ming Huang released him with a handsome severance in the spring of 744. After a series of farewell parties, Li Bai wrote a moving poem \"The Difficult Journey\" \"é¾è¡ä¹æ \" expressing his life's ambitions, difficulties he had encountered, and his outlook for the future. And then he said goodbye to the royal court - the center of world power and influence that he had once obsessed about.\n\nLi Bai was characteristically always an optimist; no setbacks ever seemed to frustrate him, and he could always find a way to see the bright side of life. Leaving Chang'an and the setting sun behind him in a relaxed and light mood on his way home, he traveled to and toured Luoyang æ´é³, which was once the capital during Empress Wu Zetian's reign. In fact, Louyang, about 200 mi/322 km east of Chang'an, had been the capital for more than six dynasties in China's history before Li Bai's time. Thus, by the Tang dynasty, it was already a famous historical cultural city and peony cultivation center. The poet Du Fu happened to be traveling in the area at that time, too, and so two of the greatest poets in Chinese history met for the first time. Li was 11 years Du's senior and was already an illustrious star poet. Du, on the other hand, had not yet garnered any fame for himself, and indeed, would not do so in his lifetime. Du, being younger than Li, exhibited the forthrightness, sincerity, and zeal in composing poems that Li had had in his earlier days. All these characteristics drew the two together and helped form a solid friendship right way.\n\nAfter touring Luoyang and before parting, they scheduled to meet up again in Kaifeng å¼å°, further east of Luoyang.\n\nview Luoyang via Google, Baidu, or wikipedia .\n\nview Luoyang cultural relic via Baidu.\n\nView a Luoyang cultural relic site - Longmen Grottoes æ´é³é¾é¨ç³çª via Baidu or wikipedia .\n\nIn the autumn, Gao Shi é«é, a famous border and frontier fortress poet and also Li Bai's friend five years his junior, joined the two of them to tour the Liangsong area æ¢å®, which includes present-day Kaifeng å¼å° and Shangqiu åä¸ in Henan æ²³å Province.\n\nKaifeng is a beautiful lake city with the Bian River æ±´æ²³ running through it. It was one of the busiest trading centers of the Qin, Han, Sui and Tang dynasties. Fifty some years after the end of the Tang, it became the capital of the Northern Song åå® Dynasty. The famous painting \"Along the (Bian) River During the Qingming Festival\" æ¸ æä¸æ²³å elegantly captures one prosperous section of the Bian River in Kaifeng during the Northern Song Dynasty.\n\nSince societal and structural changes generally evolved more slowly in former times than in the modern era, the painting is probably also a fair depiction of bustling daily life in Kaifeng during the High Tang period. One can imagine Li Bai, Du Fu and Gao Shi in the crowd happily crossing the arch bridge, to find a restaurant at which to enjoy gourmet food and fine wine, chattering into the night.\n\n* * *\n\nView daily activities in ancient Kaifeng through the animated version of \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\" via YouTube:\n\nRiver Q.

Two sets of \"gold and jade weaved clothes\" \"éé¤çè¡£\", dating from around 200 BC to 220 AD, were unearthed in the 20th century from one of the 18 mausoleums here. Of course, Li Bai, Du Fu, and Gao Shi did not have the luck to see or even know that there were such treasures hidden just right beneath their feet.\n\nView the mausoleum at Mangdang Mountain in Shangqiu via Google or view some unearthed items via Baidu.\n\nView the gold and jade weaved clothes from the Liang King Mausoleums in Shangqiu via Google or Baidu.

Du Fu went north, Gao Shi kept traveling south, and Li Bai continued on his trip home.\n\nAccording to Du Fu's poems and writings, during the early High Tang period, the cost of living was low and travel was safe, inexpensive, and pleasant.\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty, the central government had a very comprehensive postal service system -the Youyi é®é©¿ - to deliver mail and goods, as well as provide lodging for Tang officials on their business trips; of course, the most important tasks were to deliver emergency military messages and government documents. At its peak, the system had over 1,600 postal stations, more than 20,000 employees, and covered the entire country, even extending into neighboring countries and regions such as Korea, Japan, Central Asia, India and Southeast Asia. In addition to the Youyi, there was a guifang æå organization run by private enterprise, which could issue IOUs similar to modern bank money orders. With these two efficient organizations, Li Bai, who had just received a handsome severance from Tang Ming Huang, could travel light and safe on his way home.\n\nLater in the same year at age 43, Li Bai became romantically involved with a young woman, Zong Shi å®æ° (\"Shi\" æ° is a character placed after a married woman's surname in ancient times. Her giving name was lost to history), who was proficient at literature, was physically attractive, and was also interested in the study of Taoism. Furthermore, she was a long time admirer of Li Bai and came from a prominent family; she was the granddaughter of former Prime Minister Zong Chuke å®æ¥å®¢, who had served in that position on three separate occasions for two Tang emperors.\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n.... omitted\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\nAfter visiting so many natural wonders, Li Bai finally selected Mt.

Such an event âinspired him to penâ his most famous poem - \"Thoughts on a Still Night\". This is one of the most popular poems of all time that almost allâ Chinese can âreciteâ by heart.\n\nAdmiring and contemplating a bright, full moon, is a Chinese tradition, especially for a traveler away from home. Chinese believe that when people ââlook at a bright, full moon, âwhile âalone âon a tranquil night, their thoughts will naturally âwander towards their beloved onesâ. Severalâ famousâ classicâalâ versesâ reflecting this popular conception âinclude: â\n\næµ·ä¸çææï¼å¤©æ¶¯å ±æ­¤æã- ââWhen the bright moon âbreaks theâ âsurface of the âsea,\n\nâAll âunder heaven âare one âat this moment.\n\nææåéå¯ç¸æ - ââThe bright moon carries âlovesickness âââa âthousandâ miles (to reach a beloved one).\n\nææ¯æ éæ - âThe moon is brighterâ overâ home (implies thinking about and missing beloved ones âback in one'sâ hometown.)\n\nâThe moon represents a direct, shared spiritual connection, as it would be assumed that no matter what the physical distance was separating them, beloved âones would or could all be âlooking âat the exact same moon at the exact same time, sharing the same thoughts of far away beloved ones in their hearts.\n\nLi Bai's \"Thoughts on a Still Night\" has stirred feelings of homesickness in countless Chinese caught traveling far away from home on silent, moonlit nights, since the Tang Dynasty.â\n\nWhy is the character \"åº\" (sleeping bed, the structure of ...) translated as \"well\" in the poem?\n\nWhile many school children (and translators!) take the Chinese characterâ åº âto mean \"bed\" in its modern sense, it is more likely to refer to \"the structures around a well\" in its ancient sense. Ancient Chinese windows were often framed with decorative carvings and overhead eave-like structures - specifically to provide shading from sunlight (and prevent break-ins, as they could be shut and locked), but consequently also equally adept at preventing moonlight from entering a room. It would thus seem unlikely that light âcould haveâ enterâedâ âa bedâ room âexpansively enough to be mistaken as frost by the bedside. â It is more likely that Li Bai was referring to the platform structure or fence skirting a well, which was an alternate ancient meaning of åºâ.\n\nLi Bai also wrote another famous poem \"Chang Gan Xing\" é¿å¹²è¡ employing the character åº in the sense of a wood structure surrounding a well -\n\nJust starting to wear my hair banged,\n\nI plucked flowers playing by the door.\n\nHe came on bamboo hobby-horse to the scene;\n\nCircling the \"well\" and pinching plums green.\n\nNeighbors we were in Changgan alley,\n\nTwo little ones so trusting and carefree.\n\nå¦¾ååè¦é¢ï¼æè±é¨åå§ã\n\nééªç«¹é©¬æ¥ï¼ç» \"åº\" å¼éæ¢ ã\n\nåå± é¿å¹²éï¼ä¸¤å°æ å«çã\n\nThere is no doubt that the \"bed\" \"åº\" here never meant a bed for sleeping.\n\nâ....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n.... omitted\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\nView the following images:\n\n1.

Wine seemed to be catalyst that could ignite his poetic prowess with such speed that he could reportedly pen a poem in a matter of seconds after a few drinks. Thus, he was accorded the name of Jiouxian é ä», literally, \"wine immortal.\"\n\nAs a wine connoisseur he wrote numerous poems on the subject. \"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\" is one of the most famous among all \"wine poems\" written by East Asian poets through the ages. Induced by just a jug of wine, Li Bai dances into a fanciful world; and by the magic of his pen brush, he brings the reader along with him into his fantastical reverie.\n\nâDefinitions and âInterpretation of Characters, Terms, and Names:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n#11 Longing in Spring æ¥æ\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\næ¥æ Â æç½\n\nçèå¦ç¢§çµ²ï¼ ç§¦æ¡ä½ç¶ æï¼Â\n\nç¶åæ·æ­¸æ¥ï¼ æ¯å¦¾æ·è ¸æãÂ\n\næ¥é¢¨ä¸ç¸è­ï¼ ä½äºå ¥ç¾ å¹ï¼Â\n\nSimplified Chinese with pinyin\n\næ¥ æÂ æ ç½\n\nchÅ«n sÄ«Â lÇ bÃ¡i\n\nç è å¦ ç¢§ ä¸ï¼ ç§¦ æ¡ ä½ ç»¿ æï¼Â\n\nyÃ n cÇo rÃº bÃ¬ sÄ«, qÃ­n sÄng dÄ« lÇ zhÄ«;\n\nå½ å æ å½ æ¥ï¼ æ¯ å¦¾ æ­ è æ¶ãÂ\n\ndÄng jÅ«n huÃ¡i guÄ« rÃ¬, shÃ¬ qiÃ¨ duÃ n chÃ¡ng shÃ­.\n\næ¥ é£ ä¸ ç¸ è¯ï¼ ä½ äº å ¥ ç½ å¸ï¼Â\n\nchÅ«n fÄng bÃ¹ xiÄng shÃ­, hÃ© shÃ¬ rÃ¹ luÅ wÃ©i\n\nRecitation 1 Recitation 2\n\nLonging in Spring Li Bai\n\nYan grasses like strands of emerald jade silk,\n\nQin mulberries weighing down branches green.\n\nThe day when your sire thinks of coming home,\n\nIs when this lady's heart will be dying in tortured waiting.\n\nO!

Not long afterwards, the whole empire was thrown into turmoil. (âThere is an entire chapter dealing with An Lushan and the antecedents and consequences of the rebellion.)\n\nSeven months later, An Lushan overcame a key military fortress - the Tong Pass, and Emperor Tang Ming Huang hurriedly fled towards Chengdu, Sichuan Province æé½, åå·ç, while the Crown Prince Li Heng æäº¨ took refuge in Lingwu, Ningxia Province çµæ­¦, å®å¤ç and soon declared himself the new Tang emperor.

Thus, after Li Ling's repeated and earnest invites, Li Bai, in spite of his wife's attempts as dissuasion, agreed to join with Li Ling in 756. Proceeding with a knight-errant spirit, he hoped to be able to contribute and do something for the good of the country,\n\nThe next year, the new Emperor Li Heng defeated Li Ling, capturing and executing him. Li Bai was likewise jailed and awaited his fate. Upon hearing the shocking news, Du Fu wrote several poems to Li Bai to express his deep concerns and worries. During Du Fu's lifetime, he wrote many poems and letters to Li Bai, as the latter's talent, charisma, and the attitude towards life deeply attracted Du Fu.\n\nDuring this critical period, Li Bai's wife, Zong Shi, sought help from all corners to mitigate a finding of treason, which would have almost certainly resulted in a death sentence.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nAbout Li Bai's Life Journey in Details\n\n(1). Li Bai's Birth and Childhood\n\nLi Bai (701 - 762; lived mostly in the High Tang period and only a few years into the beginning of Mid Tang period), the most famous romantic poet in Chinese history, penned numerous masterpieces that are still memorized and chanted by Chinese of all ages today. He went by many names; his most popular and well-known title being Shi Xian è¯ä» - \"the Poet Immortal\" or \"the Poet Transcendentâ. His name has also been romanticized as Li Po or Li Bo. Thirty-four of Li Bai's poems are included in the popular anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems,\" second only to Du Fu's thirty-nine poems.\n\nLi Bai's ancestors were from Longxi, Chengji éè¥¿, æçºª, in present-day northern Qinan county, Gansu Province ç§¦å®å¿å, çèç. They were banished to Tiaozhi æ¡æ in the Western Regions è¥¿å, today's Central Asia, during the Sui Dynasty by the Sui ruler.\n\nAs for Li Bai's birth place, according to Guo Moruo é­æ²«è¥, a historian and ancient writing scholar, Li Bai's ancestors moved from Tiaozhi to a prosperous silk trading city Suiye ç¢å¶, also in Central Asia, within the Ansi Protectorate å®è¥¿é½æ¤åº, and Li Bai was born over there. Suiye was also known as Suyab, once a flourishing trading city on the Silk Road and now an archaeological site in modern day Ak-Beshim, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nView present-day Ak-Beshim (Suiye) in Kyrgyzstan thru Google or Yahoo. View details regarding Ak-Beshim: Wikipedia.\n\nLi Bai's father, Li Ke æå®¢, was probably a very successful merchant, since the family was installed in one of the thriving commercial centers of the empire. In 705, Li's father moved the family back to China and settled down in Jiangyou, Sichuan Province æ±æ²¹, åå·ç. ( View Jiangyou thru Google or Baidu.) (Jiangyou is bordered on the northeast side by Mianyang City ç»µé³å¸ - today's \"Silicon Valley\" in China.)\n\nSpeculated birthplace of Li Bai- Suiye (the blue drop shape) and his second \"hometown\" (the green drop shape):\n\n(Source: Google Map)\n\nThe young Li Bai read extensively, devouring not just Confucian classics, but also various tracts on astrological and metaphysical subjects, including the Chinese classic text - Tao Te Jing/Dao De Jing éå¾·ç» (Wikipedia). He was also skilled in swordsmanship.\n\nHis place of birth, his tall girth, and his angular facial features, suggested that he was possibly of mixed race. It was said that he was conversant in at least one foreign language due to his background and upbringing.\n\nIn 725 at age 24, Li Bai left his second hometown, Jianyou, to explore the world. Being young, ambitious, and without financial constraint, he embarked on a knight-errant-like journey. Heading east down the Yangtze River, he explored all the most popular cities and interesting spots along the Yangtze River including the Three Gorges, the largest lake Dongting Lake æ´åº­æ¹, the famous Mount Lu åºå±±, all the way to Jingling ééµ (present-day Nanjing åäº¬, in Jiangsu æ±è Province). While passing through the Jingmen Gorge, he left behind a beautiful poem \"Bid Farewell at Jingmen\" èé¨éå«. Along the way he met and befriended various poets and social elites, including Meng Haoran, who Li Bai had long admired. Li Bai wrote several poems in admiration and praise of Meng, including the very popular one - Seeing Meng Haoran off at Yellow Crane Tower é»é¹¤æ¥¼éå­æµ©ç¶ä¹å¹¿éµ.\n\nWhile touring Hubei, Li Bai was introduced by friends to the family of the former Prime Minister Xu Yushi è®¸åå¸. Li, at age 26, was young, handsome, and well-built. He excelled at both swordsmanship and literature, and had about him a chivalrous and gentlemanly demeanor. A budding poet, he was well-received by Xu's family and eventually married the former Prime Minister's granddaughter, Xu Ziyan è®¸ç´«ç. The couple settled down at Peach-flower Rock, near Li's in-laws in present-day Anlu, Hubei Province å®é¸, æ¹åç. Although Li Bai would travel from time to time or take short mountain sabbaticals (to enhance study and reflection) for the purposes of obtaining a position in the imperial court, the couple led a content married life with little financial burden, with Xu Ziyian bearing a daughter, Li Pingyang æå¹³é³, and a son, Li Boqin æä¼¯ç¦½.\n\nWhile away from home, Li Bai wrote many letters and poems to his wife to express his loneliness and longings, some of which were very witty and humorous.\n\nThe blessed marriage lasted for 12 years. In 740, Xu Ziyian passed away. Since several of Li's close relatives lived in Renchen ä»»å, located on the south side of present-day Jiling city, Shandong Province æµå®å¸, å±±æ±ç, Li Bai moved his family there. This was not far from Lu county, where Confucius' hometown is located.\n\nAfter settling down at Renchen, Li Bai managed to spend some time living in seclusion with five other hermits on Mt. Culai å¾å¾å±± ( view Mt. Culai thru Google or Baidu). They settled by a scenic brook in a bamboo forest, and hence the six of them earned a collective name - \"The Six Hermits of Leisure of the Bamboo Brook\" ç«¹æºªå ­é¸. Needless to say, Li Bai spiritually enjoyed his time there, taking in the surrounding mountain scenery, drinking wine, enjoying tea, playing music, practicing his fencing, and especially chanting poems together with his like-minded companions. While living on Culai Mountain, Li Bai continued to maintain contact with the local intelligentsia and gentry through letters and visits in order to get his name heard. This was the fashion during Tang Dynasty for ambitious scholars to obtain a central government appointment in the imperial court. Li Bai lived on Culai Mountain intermittently on three separate occasions.\n\nMt. Culai, the sister mountain of Mt. Tai æ³°å±±, lies about 12.5 mi/20 km to the southeast of Mount Tai. In Chinese âfeudal âtradition, emperors would come to this area atop Mt. Tai and hold Heaven-and-Earth worship ceremonies ç¥­å¤©ç¥­å°, also called fÄngchÃ¡n å°ç¦ , â during prosperous periodsâ to pay gratitude âtoâ Heaven and Earth. Another main purpose was to âjustify and reifyââ âtheirâ â\"âsuperpowerâ\"â and authority âover their people. After the ceremony, âthe emperors would also often stop at nearby Qufu æ²é in Lu county, the birthplace of Confucius, to hold a ceremony honoring him ç¥­å­å¤§å ¸. Early in the Han Dynasty, Emperor Han Wudi æ±æ­¦å¸ had paid three visits to the area, performing the aforementioned ceremonies. Several Tang emperors did so as well. Emperor Tang Ming Huang performed the ceremonies for the first and only time in 725, the year Li Bai was just stepping out of Sichuan to explore the world. While holding ceremony in Lu county, Tang Ming Huang composed a poem called \"Passing through Zou Lu âand offering a sacrifice to ââConfucius with a âsâigâhâ\" \"ç»é¹é²ââç¥­å­å­èå¹ä¹\"â. This is the only poem âby the emperor, himself, that is included in the anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\".\n\nLiving on nearby Culai Mountain and cultivating a reputation as a learned, self-sufficient, capable man, Li Bai provided himself the chance of being recognized and introduced to the Tang emperor during these ceremonies and would have had the opportunity to be possibly \"fast track\" into the imperial service.\n\nBefore his wife passed away, Li had lived in seclusion on several other mountains as well. One of these was Zhongnan Mountain çµåå±± ( view the mountain, hermits and monks thru Google or Baidu,) about 10 miles south of the Tang capital of Chang'an. He lived there around age 29 for less than a year. During the early Tang, the famous scholar hermit Lu Cangyong å¢èç¨ lived on this same mountain and was called in by Empress Wu Zetian æ­¦åå¤© to work for the central government. Lu began at the position of a remonstrative official - Zuoshiyi å·¦æ¾é ( duties of remonstrative officials in the Tang Dynasty and rank schedule of the imperial civil service system), working his way up quickly to the Shangshu-Youcheng å°ä¹¦å³ä¸ level, i.e., almost to the position of prime minister. This is the origin of the Chinese idiom \"Zhongnan Fast Track\" \"ç»åæ·å¾\". Li Bai, however, did not meet with such fortune on Zhongnan Mountain.\n\nIn 742, HÃ¨ Zhizhang è³ç¥ç« , about 83 years old at the time and a leading light of literature and high-level imperial official, read Li's poems, marveled at his literary talent, and praised Li Bai as the \"Transcendent Dismissed from Heaven\" or \"Immortal Exiled from Heaven\" \"è¬«ä»äºº\". From this point forward the acclamation \"Li Bai, the 'Transcendent Dismissed from Heaven' \" began to spread throughout the empire. And the two cemented the bond of a lifelong friendship.\n\n(2). Li Bai's Ambitious Dream Starts to Bud - An Audience with the Tang Emperor\n\nIn the late summer of the same year, Emperor Tang Ming Huang, who had caught wind of Li Bai's reputation, summoned him to the the capital Chang'an for an audience. From Li Bai's home to Chang'an was nearly a distance of 600 mi/965 km, as the crow flies. Li did not arrive until the autumn.\n\nEmperor Tang Ming Huang, an expert on military strategy who also excelled at literature, greeted Li Bai at the Grand Palace in person. During the banquet, Li's personality, wit, and political views fascinated Tang Ming Huang. The emperor even personally seasoned the soup for Li Bai.\n\nThe next year, Li Bai was assigned a Hanlin ç¿°æ position at the Hanlin Academy ç¿°æå­¦é¢ within the imperial court and appointed the state Grand Secretary. As a result of the emperor's favor, Li was never required to take the imperial examination to attain the title of jinshi, a usual prerequisite for selection and assignment to a Hanlin position. Indeed, Li Bai never attempted to take the imperial examination at all. It was rumored that this was because his ancestors had been banished to Central Asia for some kind of crime. The norm at the time was that offspring of criminals were automatically disqualified from taking the exam, but his ancestors were banished in the Sui Dynasty (581 - 618) and the Sui was overthrown by the Tang in 618, some 80 years before Li Bai was born!\n\nBeing from a merchant family also would have disqualified him from taking the imperial examination, though. This policy was adopted most likely to prevent collusion between government employees and businessmen. But in reality, this policy was never consistently implemented. Highly wealthy merchants could always circumvent the rules and secure important government positions. One such example was Wu Shiyue æ­¦å£«å½ , a successful lumber businessman with good connections to the Tang royal family, who secured several important government positions early during the dynasty and indirectly helped his daughter - Wu Zetian æ­¦åå¤© âusurpâ the throne. (There is an entire chapter devoted to Wu Zetian -- another Tang poetry promoter and grandmother of Tang Ming Huang -- in \"Tang Poems\" volume 2.)\n\nThis regulation was eventually repealed by the following Song (Sung) Dynasty å®æ, and almost all classes of males (and only males) were thereafter permitted to take the exam. In any event, during Li Bai's lifetime he often broke from convention and followed his own path.\n\nIn the beginning, Li led a fairly pleasant life at court. The famous verse \"Guifei grinding ink, Lishi pulling off boots\" \"è´µå¦ç£¨å¢¨, åå£«è±é´\" describes this period. It depicts Yang Guifei æ¥è²´å¦, Tang Ming Huang's most adored consort, grinding Chinese black inksticks into ink for Li to pen down a poem, while Gao Lishi é«åå£«, Tang Ming Huang's favorite eunuch å®¦å®, (and the most politically powerful figure in the palace), assists in pulling off Li's snow stained boots under Tang Ming Huang's request. All to facilitate Liâs comfort and creative genius. It was also suggested that whenever Li Bai published a new poem, there would be a run on paper in Chang'an, sending the price soaring, with everyone rushing out to obtain copies of his new work.\n\nLi's main duty was to handle secretarial works and record tasks for Tang Ming Huang, which included accompanying Tang Ming Huang to important ceremonies and festivities and documenting them. Tang Ming Huang probably intended that through Li's exquisite writing, the records of his reign would be of particular interest to future historians and scholars.\n\nA secondary duty assigned to Li was composing poetry for the emperor. This resulted in the poem, Qingping Song (1) æ¸ å¹³è°è¯ä¹ä¸ which is a flattering and fawning piece about Yang Guifei and reflects the desires of Tang Ming Huang.\n\nAfter working for nearly two years at the imperial court, the incompatibility of Li's personality with court life began to take its toll, as Li was never one to be bound or driven by secular rules. Detesting the political machinations, Li doubted if it was in his best interest to remain at the court.\n\nDuring this period, the treacherous Prime Minister Li Linfu ææç« held tremendous political power, running the country by himself and pushing aside all other capable individuals and potential rivals. All the while, Tang Ming Huang spent most of his time and energy indulging in a lascivious lifestyle with Consort Yang Guefei. More importantly, it was rumored that the eunuch Gao Lishi had always felt that being forced to pull off Li Bai's boots was exceedingly humiliating. So he started to badmouth Li Bai to Yang Guifei. He asserted that it was inappropriate for Li Bai to have compared her beauty to that of consort Zhao Yanfei in his second poem \"Qing Ping Ballad #2\". Zhao was originally of very low birth and status. She was a consort of Emperor Han Chengdi during the Han Dynasty, and was famous for her beauty and slender waist; in contrast, Yang's great-great-grandfather had been a key official during the previous Sui dynasty, and she had a plump figure, which was the fashion of the Tang Dynasty. Both were consorts doted on by the emperors of their times.\n\nGao Lishi had been given command of the imperial military forces and had defeated several adversaries in the power struggle for Tang Ming Huang to win the kingdom back for Tang Ming Huang's father. Having established meritorious achievements, he was conferred with the rank of Biaoqi Great General éª éªå¤§å°å (4th level in military service systems) by Tang Ming Huang, thus holding substantial imperial court military power in addition to political power. He was the favorite eunuch of Tang Ming Huang and even the powerful Prime Minister Li Linfu sometimes publicly flattered him. With such a cast of powerful officials potentially arrayed against him, Li Bai saw the writing on the wall.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n#17 Writings of a Night Lodging æ å¤ä¹¦æ\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\næ å¤æ¸æ· æç«\n\nç´°èå¾®é¢¨å²¸ï¼å±æª£ç¨å¤èã\n\næåå¹³ééï¼ææ¹§å¤§æ±æµã\n\nåè±æç« èï¼å®å èç ä¼ã\n\né£é£ä½æä¼¼ï¼å¤©å°ä¸æ²é·ã\n\nSimplified Chinese with pinyin\n\næ å¤ä¹¦æ 杜甫\n\nLÇ yÃ¨ shÅ« huÃ¡i dÃ¹ fu\n\nç»èå¾®é£å²¸ï¼å±æ¨¯ç¬å¤èã\n\nxÃ¬ cÇo wÃ©i fÄng Ã n, wÄi qiÃ¡ng dÃº yÃ¨ zhÅu.\n\næåå¹³ééï¼ææ¶å¤§æ±æµã\n\nXÄ«ng chuÃ­ pÃ­ng yÄ kuÃ², yuÃ¨ yÇng dÃ jiÄng liÃº.\n\nåå²æç« èï¼å®å èç ä¼ã\n\nMÃ­ng qÇ wÃ©n zhÄng zhe, guÄn yÄ«n lÇo bÃ¬ng xiÅ«.\n\né£é£ä½æä¼¼ï¼å¤©å°ä¸æ²é¸¥ã\n\nPiÄo piÄo hÃ© suÇ sÃ¬?

In the vastness of the night, the author reflects upon his chronic illness in old age, the aimless drifting of his life, and the unmoored tumult of his desolate mood. The scene evokes an emotional response enough to fill the eyes of the reader with tears of sympathy for this talented poet.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nHÃ¨ Zhizhang è´ºç¥ç«\n\nHÃ¨ Zhizhang (659 - 744; lived in the Early and High Tang periods) was born in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang Province è§å±±, æµæ±ç. Only one of his well-known works \"Coming Home\" \"åä¹¡å¶é¦\" is included in the popular anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems.\" The poem actually has eight verses, but since only the first four verses are popularly recited, only this part is reproduced below. His other very popular poem is called \"Chanting Willow\" \"åæ³\".\n\nAs with many others of his time, he, too sought his fortune through the imperial examination system, passing the exam and entering into the civil service during Empress Wu Zetian's reign. HÃ¨'s career was long and smooth-sailing. In 710 at age 51, during Emperor Li Xian's reign (Empress Wu Zetian's third son) he was promoted to the honorable position of a Hanlin Scholar ç¿°æå­¦å£«. He had a bold and unconstrained personality.\n\nAfter reading Li Bai's poems, he was highly impressed and praised Li Bai as \"An Immortal Exiled from Heaven!\" \"å¤©ä¸è°ªä»äººä¹!\" Hence, people began referring to Li Bai as the \"Poet Immortal\" \"è¯ä»\" (pinyin: shÄ« xian).\n\nIn 742, HÃ¨ (about 83 years old and a leading figure in the literary world by that time), met Li Bai for the first time. Appreciating Li Bai's talent, HÃ¨ made Li a close friend, even though he was 41 years Li Bai's senior. Both were fond of bottle and were listed in Du Fu's work \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup\" \"é¥®ä¸­å «ä»\".\n\nHe was not only a leading figure in the literary world but also well-known for his cursive script èä¹¦ and clerical script é¶ä¹¦ calligraphy.\n\n#19 Random Musings on a Homecoming åä¹¡å¶ä¹¦\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\nåéå¶æ¸ è³ç¥ç«\n\nå°å°é¢å®¶èå¤§åï¼ éé³ç¡æ¹é¬¢æ¯å¬ã\n\nå ç«¥ç¸è¦ä¸ç¸è­ï¼ ç¬åå®¢å¾ä½èä¾ï¼\n\nSimplified Chinese with pinyin\n\nå ä¹¡ å¶ ä¹¦ 贺知章\n\nHuÃ­ xiÄng Çu shÅ« hÃ¨ zhÄ« zhÄng\n\nå° å° ç¦» å®¶ è å¤§ åï¼\n\nshÃ o xiÇo lÃ­ jiÄ lÇo dÃ huÃ­,\n\nä¹¡ é³ æ æ¹ é¬ æ¯ å¬ã\n\nxiÄng yÄ«n wÃº gÇi bÃ¬n mÃ¡o cuÄ«.\n\nå¿ ç«¥ ç¸ è§ ä¸ ç¸ è¯ï¼\n\nÃr tÃ³ng xiÄng jiÃ n bÃ¹ xiÄng shÃ¬,\n\nç¬ é® å®¢ ä» ä½ å¤ æ¥ï¼\n\nxiÃ o wÃ¨n kÃ¨ cÃ³ng HÃ¨ chÃ¹ lÃ¡i?\n\nRecitation 1 Recitation 2\n\nRandom Musings on a Homecoming HÃ¨ Zhizhang\n\nI left home a young buck and returned an old man.\n\nMy accent's the same,\n\nbut sideburns silver have run.\n\nThey greet me, the children,\n\nbut know not who I am.\n\nSmiling they ask me, \"you come to us,\n\ndear sir, from which faraway land?\"\n\n* * *\n\nHÃ¨ outlasted 4 emperors through his long career, and there are no records showing he was ever banished, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for any imperial official, especially outspoken ones.

Eight of his poems are collected in the popular anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems.\"\n\nIn 727 at age 29, he passed the imperial examination obtaining the title-degree of jinshi and eventually becoming a secretarial official. Seven years later, he passed the advanced imperial examination and was further promoted. In 739, due to his outspoken criticisms, he was banished to the remote region of Lingnan å²­å (a southwest border region known at that time for its instability) but was called back the next year to the capital of Chang'an. Then in 753, he was again banished to Longbiao é¾æ  at Yelang å¤é, an extremely \"underdeveloped\" tribal area to the southwest of present day Hunan Province æ¹åç, to serve as the county administrator.\n\nRight after hearing the bad news about Wang's banishment, Li Bai wrote a consolation letter to provide encouragement on his lonely journey:\n\n\"A letter for Wang Changling heading for Longbiao --\n\n...I send with you my anxious heart in the company of the luminescent moon, to chaperone you all the way to Yelang in the west!\"\n\n\"é»çæé¾å·¦è¿é¾æ é¥ææ­¤å¯ --\n\n...æå¯æå¿ä¼´ææï¼\n\né¨åç´å°å¤éè¥¿!\"\n\nFive years later, Li Bai was also being banished to Yelang; however, Wang was unable to reciprocate the kind thoughts.\n\nIn 756, Wang quit his post at Longbiao and set off for home to take care of his aging parents. While passing through Haozhou county, Anhui Province äº³å·ç, å®å¾½ç, he was executed by the county prosecutor, LÃ¼ Qiuxiao é¾ä¸æ at age 58.

Before his execution, LÃ¼ begged for mercy from Zhang Kao, pleading that his aged parents needed him to take care of them. Zhang Kao retorted, \"So tell me, who is going to take care of Wang Changling's aged parents?!\"\n\nWang Changling is best known for his poems describing battles in the frontier regions. During his early middle age, he had traveled to the furthest northwest border areas for years. Due to his experiences in that desolate region and his contacts with native peoples, his poetry is diverse and colorful. His genre of frontier poetry is filled with a joyously unrestrained and enthusiastic outlook, reflecting the zeitgeist of the High Tang era. Wang also became good friends with Meng Haoran, Li Bai, Cen Can, Wang Zhihuan, Gao Shi (å­æµ©ç¶, æç½, å²å, çä¹æ¶£, é«é), and other poets, drawing further synergistic inspiration from them.\n\n#21 Beyond the Border (Moon in the times of Qing, ...) åºå¡\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\nåºå¡ ç æ é½¡\n\nç§¦ææææ¼¢æéï¼ è¬éé·å¾äººæªéã\n\nä½ä½¿é¾åé£å°å¨ï¼ ä¸æè¡é¦¬åº¦é°å±±ã\n\nSimplified Chinese with pinyin\n\nåº å¡ ç æ é¾\n\nChÅ« sÄi WÃ¡ng ChÄng LlÃ­ng\n\nç§¦ æ¶ æ æ æ± æ¶ å ³ï¼\n\nqÃ­n shÃ­ mÃ­ng yuÃ¨ hÃ n shÃ­ guÄn,\n\nä¸ é é¿ å¾ äºº æª è¿ã\n\nwÃ n lÇ chÃ¡ng zhÄng rÃ©n wÃ¨i huÃ¡n.\n\nä½ ä½¿ é¾ å é£ å° å¨ï¼\n\ndÃ n shÇ lÃ³ng chÃ©ng fÄi jiÃ ng zÃ i,\n\nä¸ æ è¡ é©¬ åº¦ é´ å±±ã\n\nbÃ¹ jiÃ o hÃº mÇ dÃ¹ yÄ«n shÄn.\n\nRecitation 1 Recitation 2\n\nBeyond the Border Wang Changling\n\nThe brilliant moon in the times of Qin,\n\nThe frontier fortresses in the times of Han,\n\nA war expedition of a myriad miles,\n\nWith no one yet returned to the homeland.\n\nIf but the Flying General of the Dragon Fortress were still alive,\n\nNo barbarian cavalry would dare cross Yinshan.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Qin ç§¦ and Han æ± were two of the greatest dynasties in Chinese history -- the former uniting all of China for the first time, and the latter consolidating the achievements of the Qin. The poem starts with the image of the two mighty dynasties, with the brilliant, ascending moon of the Qin eventually shining over the Great Wall (the military passes) of the magnificent Han -- a view many Chinese want to describe as \"so stunning as to take one's breath away and sweep aside the clouds.\" At the same time, the poem underscores the sentimental longing that has stretched over centuries -- as represented by the image of a yet incomplete, ten thousand mile long, military expedition -- for the recapture of former glory. The poem then ends in a wistful yearning for a great general to bring back the achievements of a bygone era in which the state shined so brightly and powerfully. The martial sentimentality leaps off the page through Wang's vivid writing and is, indeed, considered a particularly exceptional poem by Chinese literature enthusiasts.\n\nThe Flying General referred to here is General Li Guang æå¹¿ (born ? - 119 BC), a famous general of the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). He was off and on at war with the Huns/Xiongnu åå¥´ for four decades. The Huns feared his bravery, nicknaming him the \"Flying General\", and dared not cross the Yin Mountains during his lifetime.\n\nLi Guang was of husky build with extraordinarily long and strong arms. He excelled at archery and was a renowned \"sharpshooter\" and the poet Lu Lun wrote a very popular poem praising his archery skills.\n\nLi Guang was incorruptible, upright, and cared for his subordinates, which earned him the respect and love of his soldiers. Due to his political naivety, however, and bad luck late in his military career, he was never attained the honorific title of Marquis åçµ, which had been his lifelong dream.\n\nIn 119 BC, Emperor Han Wudi launched a military campaign -- the Battle of Mobei æ¼ åä¹æ (literally \"Battle of the Northern Desert\") -- to fight the Huns in the northern part of the Gobi Desert. Li Guang became lost in the desert due to a sudden sandstorm and was blamed for failing to arrive at the battlefield in time, contributing to the Huns' escape. Refusing to accept the humiliation of a court martial, Li Guang, with unbending character, took his own life.\n\nâDefinitions and âInterpretation of Characters, Terms, and Names:\n\nåºå¡: beyond the border (also known as Liangzhou Ci åå·è¯); this was a popular generic title for \"frontier\" genre poems.\n\nç§¦: the Qin Dynasty æ¶: time, season, era, age, period æ: bright, light, brilliant, clear æ: moon, month æ±: the Han Dynasty å ³: frontier pass, fort, mountain pass, to close, to shut, to turn off\n\nä¸: ten thousand, thousands and thousands, a great many é: also called huali åé, a measurement of distance in China.

The Historical Path that Led Tang to Glory\n\nThe sequence of the major influential dynasties in Chinese history prior to the Tang:\n\nXia å¤ -- around 2070 â 1600 BC; the legendary first dynasty of China. (\"X\" is pronounced as the English \"see\" in pinyin.)\n\nShang å -- from 1600 to 1046 BC; the beginning of written Chinese history\n\nEast Zhou æ±å¨ -- from 770 to 256 BC; era of Confucius å­å­, Laozi èå­, Sun Tzu å­å­, etc.; mostly a time of warring states and factions, but also the flowering of Chinese philosophy.\n\nQin ç§¦ -- from 221 to 206 BC; from which the western name \"China\" arose. (\"Q\" is pronounced as the English \"Ch\" in pinyin.)\n\nHan æ± -- from 202 BC to 220 AD; by which the Chinese are known as the \"Han\" people.\n\nSui é -- from 581 to 618; the dynasty that set the stage for the Tang.\n\nTang å - from 618 to 907; by which the Chinese are also known as the \"Tang\" people.\n\nA brief history on the rise of the Tang dynasty:\n\nDuring the Qin ç§¦ Dynasty, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ç§¦å§ç not only standardized Chinese written language, but also standardized the monetary, measurement, and \"highway\" systems (setting the road width for chariots, the drainage and pavement codes, etc.). As for state defense, he connected together various wall barriers into the Great Wall to protect the northern border.\n\nDuring the following Han æ± Dynasty, the wall was extended and re-enforced, and the Hexi Corridor æ²³è¥¿èµ°å» was developed, helping to form a \"Silk Road\" to facilitate trading with the western world. Likewise, the Panyu area çªç¦ºå (ancient sections of present-day Guangzhou å¹¿å· city) on the southern coast also developed into an international trading entrepot for silk and other merchandise commerce.\n\nFollowing the Han Dynasty, was the short lived Sui é Dynasty, which nevertheless, linked together various canals into the Grand Canal å¤§è¿æ²³ with a total length of nearly 1,110 mi/1,786 km (mi: miles; km: kilometers), connecting five major rivers from south to north. Food and merchandise could therefore be transported much faster from the prosperous southeast coastal regions to the north and west. The canal further benefitted the agriculture and irrigation systems. The Sui Dynasty also solidified and extended various sections of the Great Wall.\n\nIn the very early Tang Dynasty the practice of \"guifang\" æå, also known as \"jiugui\" å¦æ, played a similar role to that of today's modern banking system, by issuing paper \"money orders\" or \"payable notes\", which greatly helped to facilitate commerce and develop the domestic Tang economy. For large trades, merchants no longer needed to carry around heavy and inconvenient *coins or precious metals that could be lost or stolen.\n\nThe guifang æå eventually developed into feiqian é£é±, literally \"flying cash,\" the earliest form of paper money ever issued in the world. \"Paper bills were first used by the Chinese, who started carrying folding money during the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618-907) â mostly in the form of privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes -- and used it for more than 500 years before the practice began to catch on in Europe in the 17th century. It took yet another century or two for paper money to spread to the rest of the world\" (source: Time - the First Paper Money - http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1914560_1914558_1914593,00.html or Wikipedia).\n\nThus, by the time of the rise of the Tang, China was blessed with a unified internal infrastructure defended by an \"impregnable\" Great Wall. These included an extensive water and road system built by the previous Qin and Sui dynasties, a securely guarded Silk Road along the Hexi Corridor developed by the Han Dynasty, and a convenient trade and exchange transaction system refined by the Tang itself. All these allowed the Tang to dance onto the world stage, reaching its peak during Tang Ming Huang's reign.\n\n* Note: coins -\n\nThe coins used in daily life and trade in ancient China were round in shape with a square shaped hole in the middle for stringing together (so that they could be carried around easily) but it was clumsy and inconvenient for large trades.

(The two yellow spots to the west of Chang'an were the Jade Gate and the Yang Gate - two important defense and customs bases.)\n\n(source: By NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Silk_route.jpg)\n\nFor details about the Silk Road: wikipedia.\n\nThe Grand Canal sped up domestic north-south transportation.\n\n(source: Yug (talk) East Asia topographic map.png: Ksiom (East_Asia_topographic_map.png) [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], via Wikimedia Commons).\n\nFor details about the Grand Canal: wikipedia.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Tang Dynasty can be divided into four periods based on the strength of the empire. The spirit and mood of Tang poems are more or less in sync with these time periods.\n\nThe four periods (which overlap to a certain degree):\n\n(1). The Early Tang from the beginning of the dynasty in 618 until around 712 -- about 100 years of thriving development.\n\n(2). The High Tang -- the most prosperous period -- from around 712 until the An Lushan Rebellion å®ç¦å±±ä¹ä¹± in 756. This corresponds with Emperor Tang Ming Huang's åæç 40 plus year reign. And it was also the peak period of Tang poetry.\n\n(3). The Mid Tang from around 756 to 827 -- about 70 years of slow decline.\n\n(4). The Late Tang from around 827 until the fall of the dynasty in 906, about 80 years of further decadence and accelerated decline.\n\nContinue reading or return to \"âââI encourage you toâ firstâ read Chapter 3 â-âThe Historical Path that Led Tang to Glorây\".\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... omitted\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n(1). The Imperial Examination System\n\nWhile the first stirrings of the imperial examination system ç§ä¸¾å¶åº¦ (pinyin: KÄ jÇ zhÃ¬ dÃ¹) began in the Han dynasty around 165 BC, its coalescing into a regularized regime can be traced back to Emperor Sui Wendi éæå¸ of the Sui é Dynasty in 587. The system was consolidated and officially established, however, only in 605 by Emperor Sui Yangdi Â éçå¸ (Yang Guang æ¨å¹¿) and improved upon during the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe system was set up for the purpose of ensuring that only the most capable individuals were selected for government and administrative positions by means of competitive categorized examinations (éç¨åç§åå£«çåæ³ï¼æä»¥å«åç§ä¸¾). It encompassed more than 20 subject categories, including medicine, law, math, history, calligraphy,...etc. Among all the different degree-titles that issued from the examinations, the jinshi degree-title was the hardest to obtain. However, securing this would lead to a bright future -- a great many Tang prime ministers were jinshi title holders.\n\nAt the beginning it was a two-tiered system, consisting of a county and then a court exam (in following dynasties, it morphed into three or even four-tiers, with each tier progressively more difficult than the last), each of which was held once a year. There were also occasional ad hoc imperial examinations held by the emperor for special purposes (in addition, there was a special imperial examination for selecting high military officials called wuju æ­¦ä¸¾ which was not as heavily relied upon as the civil service examination system). To sit for the jinshi degree-title exam, the candidate was required to write policy essays on current event issues, individually interpret quotations from the Confucian classics (among others) compose poetry, and engage in other technical writings. It required literary talent and the ability to craft insightful, policy-oriented analyses, as well as possess acumen in interpreting passages from *the Four Books, *the Five Classics, and other ancient tomes. The success rate for jinshi examinees was only between 1 and 2 percent compared to 10 to 20 percent for mingjin degree-title applicants (limited to mastering *the Four Books, *the Five Classics and other classics) (source: ãTongdianã Chapter 15 [in Chinese only] ãéå ¸ã å·15 ãé¸èä¸ãï¼ âå ¶é²å£«å¤§æµåäººï¼å¾ç¬¬è ç¾ä¸äºï¼æç¶åä¹ï¼å¾ç¬¬è åä¸\"). A total of 6,504 jinshi titles were conferred during the course of the Tang Dynasty, an average of only around 23 per year. (the Confucian classics -- the Four Books and the Five classics were included across all exams, weighted differently depending on the exam)\n\nAfter passing the last tier of court exams, a candidate would then be assigned to a local civil service position to begin his career.
