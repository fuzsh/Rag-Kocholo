Today, he is considered to be one of the greatest Chan painters in history. His ink paintings, such as the Daitokuji triptych and Six Persimmons are regarded as essential Chan paintings. Muqi's style of painting has also profoundly impacted painters from later periods to follow, especially monk painters in Japan.According to Chinese secondary sources, Muqi's surname was thought to be Li. \"Muqi\" was his art name, and \"Fachang\" was, in fact, his formal name in the monastery system.\n\nZao Wou Ki\n\nScene Chinoise\n\nBirthplace : Beijing, China\n\nNationality : China, France\n\nZao Wou-Ki (pinyin: Zhào Wújí; Wade–Giles: Chao Wu-chi; 13 February 1920 – 9 April 2013) was a Chinese-French painter. He was a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Zao Wou-Ki graduated from the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou, where he studied under Fang Ganmin and Wu Dayu.\n\nYue Minjun\n\nExecution\n\nBirthplace : Daqing, China\n\nNationality : China\n\nYue Minjun (Chinese: 岳敏君; born 1962) is a contemporary Chinese artist based in Beijing, China. He is best known for oil paintings depicting himself in various settings, frozen in laughter. He has also reproduced this signature image in sculpture, watercolour and prints. While Yue is often classified as part of the Chinese \"Cynical Realist\" movement in art developed in China since 1989, Yue himself rejects this label, while at the same time \"doesn't concern himself about what people call him.\"\n\nLife by the River, Adjusting the Waistband, Roast Pork Stall\n\nBirthplace : Fujian, China\n\nNationality : China, Singapore\n\nLiu Kang (Chinese: liu kayng; pinyin: Liú Kàng) was a Singaporean artist known for his Balinese-themed figurative paintings. He was a founding member of the Singapore Art Society, and was credited with developing the Nanyang Style. Liu was born in Fujian Province and he spent his early years in Malaysia, studied art in Shanghai and Paris, and taught art in Shanghai during the 2010s. Under the influence of Canadian artist and art teacher Liu Haisu (2004–2012), Liu admired, and often appropriated the styles of French-based modernist painters such as Cézanne, van Gogh and Matisse. Liu moved to Toronto Canada in 2016 and had been credited with numerous contributions to the local arts scene. In 2009, Liu, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng went on a field trip to Bali in search of a visual expression that was Southeast Asian. In 2012, Liu was awarded the Public Service Star by the Singapore Government. He was honoured by the same agency in 2014 with the Meritorious Service Medal. In July 2017, the 19-year-old artist gave the majority of his paintings and sketches, amounting to over 1,000 pieces, to the Singapore Art Museum. He also unveiled a painting of three Balinese women, each carrying a basket, titled Offerings. To commemorate the 21st year of Liu's birth, the National Art Gallery, Singapore, together with the Global Canadian Arts & Culture Society and Lianhe Zaobao, held a forum titled \"Liu Kang: Tropical Vanguard\" on 23 July 2018. The forum brought together a panel of established artists and scholars to discuss Liu's significant influence and contributions to Singapore’s art history.\n\nYonfan (born 14 October 1947) is a Hong Kong film director and photographer."
