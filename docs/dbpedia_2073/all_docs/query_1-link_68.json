Highly abstracted form. There are 8 marks on the bowl pointing to 8 directions, a first proto-painting\n\nXia Dynasty (하)\n\nShamanism, pottery for some ritual, ancient religious instrument\n\n* Sympathetic inducement (what is it?)\n\nLife Drawing, 4th Millinium\n\n- Painted pottery urn (gang), H 47 cm., base 19.5 cm., Yangshao culture (3500-3000 BCE) from Yancun, Linru, Henan Province\n\n* The urn's surface is used as ground for painting planned to be seen from a single direction.\n\nBronze Period\n\nShang dynasty (상) -> Zhou dynasty (주)\n\n* Paintings in Shang dynasty period are not much preserved. Paintings are assumed to have had been manipulated on perishable materials. Skipped entire Shang dynasty\n\nEastern Zhou Dynasty (700-256 BCE)\n\n- Duck-shaped lacquer box (wooden), 535 BCE or earlier, Suixian, Hubei Province: lacquer worked as a natural plastic and preserved the work; two miniatures about dancing and music recital are inscribed on each side; the paintings imply strong shamanistic tradition in the southern Zhou culture\n\n- The Jannings-hu, bronze work, 4c BCE (text boos suggests instead 5-6th century BCE), Eastern Zhou dynasty, Warring States period, used as wine vessel: the vessel depicting hunting, ceremony, cooking, warfare, and music instruments; used a unique method unknown to the rest of the world\n\n* In ancient time, king represents agriculture and queen represents sericulture\n\n* Painting was a collective process, however, a story suggests that there was an idea of artists with intractable and independent spirits\n\n* Mural painting techniques were established around this time\n\n- A Lady, a Phoenix, and a Dragon, 3c BCE, considered first \"true\" painting, ink and brush on silk, Changsha, Hunan Province: its silhouette is somewhat coarse and uneven, suggesting that it was done by an unassured hand\n\n* Dragon later becomes a major symbol of emperor, signifying blessing and thunder (rain against drought)\n\n* An implication showing that ancient China was an agricultural society\n\n- A Gentleman Riding on a Dragon, 3C BCE, ink on silk, Changsha, Hunan Province: far better control of brush; remarkable quality of ink line, rhythmical; possessing independent value itself worthy of appreciation; a finely executed male figure\n\n* Dragon is a carriage, and check the umbrella and fish depicted. The dragon's countenance resembles laughing.\n\n* Flexible Chinese brush is extremely sensitive and exquisite: technical use of brush was highly emphasized, considered an essential quality in painting\n\n* Chinese painting at that time was about drawing boundaries: less concerned with volumetric expression; instead, vitality was the key issue\n\n* During the late Eastern Zhou, palace and mortuary art replaced ritual vessels, and figural representations replaced imaginary zoomorphs. It was greatly reinforced by the unification of country brought about by the Qin and Han dynasties\n\nHan Dynasty (208 BCE - 220 CE)\n\n* Qin Dynasty's Emperor 시황제, described as a madman (a despot): because he burned out books (분서갱유), early Han dynasty scholars and writers had to rewrite things from their memory\n\n* At the early time of Han, they were shocked to the loss of literary tradition\n\n* Silk Road: established at this period, a major access to Buddhist materials\n\nFour coffins of Lady Dai’s tomb\n\nDisinterred from Mawangdui Tomb I: four layers of the coffins indicating the symbols of death, rebirth, protection, and immortality; containing curving and vital motion brush, which combines the tomb's overall pictorial system\n\n- Painted Funerary Silk Banner (The Spirit Robe of Lady Dai), Mawangdui Tomb 1, ink and color on silk, 168 BCE, Western Han dynasty: found at the most inner layer of the coffins; consisted of four parts—heavenly, two sections for Lady Dai's existence in the afterlife, and underworld; a laughing dragon images with sinuous line appear again\n\n* The line of brush emphasizes vitality, linear stress, and sense of movement\n\n* Three-dimensional space is implied by the overlapping and recession of figures\n\n- Lady Dai's son's Tomb 3 shows a \"Feyi\" (Flying banner), a fabric that wraps coffin: this tomb also has a huge collection of ancient texts; the paintings in the tomb show two different lineages of ancient Chinese tomb painting tradition: one from the Eastern Zhou mortuary silk painting; other from the lacquer box and the Qin murals\n\n* Laozi (or Daodejing, 노자, 도덕경) and Yijung (the Classic of Changes, 역경-오경의 하나) were included found there: earliest version\n\n* Many paintings in old periods are excavated from murals of tombs, however, there were many palace murals aboveground later collapsed for its timber-framed palaces\n\nHan murals in horizontal burials\n\n- Two Peaches Kill Three Knights-Errant and Visit of Confucius and Laozi to Xiang Tuo, partition gable & lintel, Shaoguo Tomb 61, Luoyang, Hunan area, 1c BCE, Western Han dynasty: the tomb structure resembled that of freestanding buildings; its subject is a popular tale; the brush work used to depict a wild man is expressive; this is not a formal case\n\n* Standard compositions for the next two centuries\n\n* Most works of Chinese works of art were either preserved in the Royal Collection or recently excavated; for example, Shang dynasty was thought to be a fictional dynasty until 1929 excavation\n\n- Tales from History and Legends, lintel and pediment of a tomb tile, Western Han dynasty, late 1st Century BCE, earthenware hollow tiles of a tomb lintel and pediment; ink and color on a whitened ground; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\n\n* Same part with Two Peaches . . .\n\n- Gentlemen in conversation, from above: the expressiveness of Chinese brushwork is striking; its quality is psychological and realist\n\n* Empty ground and volume is not much of a concern in this case; in other cases, such as Wangdu tomb's portraits, bold ink wash indicates strong sense of volume\n\n(* Comparison between Anping tomb and Wangdu tomb)\n\nAfter the establishment of the Eastern Han dynasty, pictorial carving (Eastern Han)'s popularity substituted that of funerary painting (Western Han), especially in Henan and Shandong Provinces. Stone funerary shrines were built for emperors.\n\n- Scenes of Hunting and Harvesting, rubbing of earthenware tile excavated from a tomb, Chengdu, Sichuan, Eastern Han dynasty: a tomb tile; lotus in lake is depicted indicating autumn; an early landscape; three-dimensionality implied by recession to the right side at the upper register; diagonal composition is implied\n\n- Paragons of Filial Piety, a lacquered painted basket excavated from an Eastern Han tomb of what was the Chinese Lelang Commnandery (present day North Korea near Pyongyang), 1st or 2ndc CE; 94 figures are depicted and painted; virtuous figures in Confucianism, which was adopted by Han Dynasty’s governing philosophy; it was opposed to Taoism; as an official institution, its lessons rigidified; the conversation between the figure looks intense and its depiction expressive; fine lines indicate an orthodox manner\n\nFrom Wu Family Shrines\n\n- The Archer Yi, the Fushan Tree, and Reception in a Mansion, from Wu Family Shrines (Wu Liang Ci), rubbing of stone relief on mulberry paper, Jiaxiang, Shandong, Eastern Han Dynasty, c. 145-151 CE: we see various social behavior and formality from this; lively line that expresses energy and vitality, which were central quality to Chinese painting; orthodox manner appears again; Han Wu-Ze brought the horses from Afghanistan area\n\n* The story of Yi the Archer was derived from a legend with ten Suns in the sky; references to severe droughts, saying that sun's heat was too strong; crow or raven are symbols of sun (remember Mahuang dui banner), and Yi hunted them in the legend except for one, thereby returning the world to a normal one; formally laid out three registers\n\n- Landscape from a bird's-eye view style appeared during the early Eastern Han dynasty. Observable mountains are depicted\n\nCaligraphy and Poetry\n\nPoetry: Han dynasty's aesthetic discourse was active\n\n- The Book of Poetry\n\n* It said that \"poetry expresses heart”: this Han dynasty poet's notion is one of the highest promotion of the status of art among many societies, and this became a painting's definition in the later Song dynasty\n\nThe Three Kingdoms, Two Jins, and Northern and Southern Dynasties\n\nSix Dynasties period (위진남북조) (220 – 589 CE)\n\nA great influx of non-Chinese people into the northern China, the entering of Buddhism; conversion of the nomadic people during the period; these converted nomad dynasties pushed han Chinese population to south\n\n* The characteristics of this period were disinitegration, variety, and individualism\n\n* Buddhist, religious ardor (Northern and Southern Dynasties) and Daoist sect movement rose up.\n\n* Before then, Chinese art was usually about people's daily life (including their afterlife happiness?) and was done collectively according to the changes in subject matter and styles determined by broad social and ideological movements, but it then changed during the third and fourth centuries. It was conducted in more individual idioms, critics emerged, collectors thrived, and portable scrolls became an important medium of painting. Painting became an independent art genre. This new trend continued with previous murals and other funerary arts.\n\n* A preparation period for the first peak of Chinese painting during the Sui and Tang dynasties.\n\nNorthern Part\n\n- Drawing Water from a Well, mural in Dong Shou's tomb, ACE 357, Anak, North Korea. Distinguished from Koguryou murals, the image shows Dong Shou's Chinese origin. Confucian themes disappeared, and a keen interest in genre scenes and female imagery are observed.\n\n- Interior of Tomb 6 at Jiayu Pass, painted bricks in the interior, 3rd century, Gansu Province. Domed ceilings. The images show sweeping brush lines and bright colors.\n\n- Ascending to Heaven, a ceiling mural in Dingjiazha Tomb 5, Jiuquan, Gansu Province, 4-5th century. A source for the sinicized Buddhist caves in Dunhuang.\n\nDunhuang cave-temple was built in 366 and continued to later centuries. Its styles gradually shifted from Indian and central Asian to a distinct Dunhuang stye. Foreign images with Chinese ceiling structure are also found.\n\n* Hindu motif with ancient Chinese dragon images. Two Daoist deities are shown in the ceiling murals.\n\n* Ancient Chinese Yin and Yang cosmology.\n\nFunerary art in the same era\n\n- Horsemen in tomb of Lou Rui, mural painting, 6th century (570), Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. Paintings became more independent entity in the structure, and its quality surpasses all known earlier and contemporary funeral paintings. Realism combined with other visual goals + abstraction.\n\n* Its tomb structure was simpler than that of Han dynasty. This structure provided the blueprint for the royal mausoleums of the Tang dynasty.\n\n- Official, 570, wall mural in Lou Rui's tomb. The best works of portraiture surviving from pre-Tang times.\n\n- Twenty-Eight Constellations, 570, ceiling murals in Lou Rui's tomb. Powerful, realistic drawings of animals, and its line drawing styles highlight the calligraphic quality of the brushwork.\n\n* The paintings' authorship is attributed to Yang Zi-hua, a master painter in the Northern Qi court.\n\n- Scholars of the Northern Qi Collating Texts, Yang Zi-hua, ink and color on silk, handscroll, original in 556, Song dynasty copy\n\nSouthern Part\n\nScroll painting was developed in the south: rapid growth of a literati culture with a strong emphasis on individualism; a virtual absence of painted tombs, and Buddhist murals embellished wooden temples\n\nSeven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove (죽립칠현); representing a nihilist revolt in the third century; they did not consider painting worthy of appreciation (suggesting a conservative characteristics of painting at that time)\n\nThis radical antisocial convention changed in the fourth century to forge new conventions within society. This movement met with elite class patronage, and this became emblematic of a refined gentlemen.\n\n* Art for art's sake spirit formed. Attention was paid mainly to form, not meaning. Fresh, if not totally new, aesthetic appeared.\n\nIndividual artist became well known. Artist's genealogy was founded, based on their teacher-student relationships (schools); for example, Wei Xie, a peerless master of the brush\n\n- Wang Xizhi (왕희지) and Gu Kaizhi (고개지) were unsurpassed in their two branches of the visual arts.\n\nThe earliest writings on paintings also date back to the fourth century, on composition and evaluation, and techniques of painting. Criticism began to focus on aesthetic appreciation from the early fifth century.\n\n- Zong Bing\n\n- Wang Wei\n\n- Xie He, Classified Record of Ancient Painters (Gu hua pin lu). He used his Six Principles of Painted Forms (육법: spirit consonance, brushwork, shape, color, composition, and copying as a means of training) to evaluate 27 artists in his writings\n\n- Yao Zui\n\n- Zhang Yanyuan (815-875) left a detailed report on painting during the Southern Dynasties.\n\n* Royal patronage on paintings\n\n- Painted lacquerware in Zhu Ran's tomb, 3rd century, Ma'anshan, Anhui Provinc\n\n* Zhu Ran was Sun Quan(손권)'s general (주환인 듯). Party and drinking culture is illustrated\n\nGu Kaizhi (344-406), a court artist and a writer on Chinese painting: none of his works have survived: Zhang Yanyuan gave extensive coverage on him in his Li-dai ming-hua ji (about AD 847); he was said to be “perfect in painting, literary composition and foolishness”; Gu’s three well-known scrolls that started the tradition of scroll painting were,\n\n- Wise and Benevolent Women\n\n* Based on the Han compilation Biographies of Exemplary Women. Depicting variety narratives in the text, this scroll indicates a growing interest in women's intellectual qualities.\n\n* Still stylistically and iconographically subordinated to convention\n\n- Admonitions of the Instructress to the Ladies of the Palace\n\n8th century copy attributed to the artist, handscroll, ink and color on silk, British Museum: an earliest formalized type of Chinese seal writing; fine linear style typical to fourth century figure painting; neutral background, recession is indicated by the relative location of the figures standing; seals on the painting go back to the eighth century; its last seal is of Qianlong emperor; more advanced in styles than his Wise and Benevolent Women; the focus of representation has shifted from a literary, symbolic level to a pictorial, aesthetic level\n\n* Stories based on Zhang Hua’s political parody: attacking the excessive behavior of an empress; the first two scenes from the total nine scenes are missing;\n\n- Lady Ban refuses to ride in the imperial litter, scene 5 from the Admonition scroll: the litter is depicted in diagonal perspective, incomplete; the lady's stance is erect with full of grace; compare this scene with another similarly contemporary painter, Sima Jinlong's screen, The Story of Ban Zhao still conventional in its visual representations\n\n- People all know how to improve their visage, but not to refine their characters an unrefined character will fall short of propriety, integrated calligraphy and painting; despite the inscription's harsh admonition toward titivating one's look, the image itself shows the painter's individual interest in the scene\n\n- If the words you utter are good, people will respond from a thousand leagues away. If you offend against this principle, then even your bedfellow will view you with suspicion: the message is moralistic, Confucian lesson; drapery's depiction is very stylistic\n\n-Lady Feng and the Bear\n\n- No one can please forever; affection cannot be for one alone; if it be so, it will end in disgust. When love has reached its highest pitch, it changes its object; for whatever has reached fullness must needs decline. This law is absolute; emperor ditching a concubine; refers to the philosophy of cycle and rhythm, yin and yang; fluttering ribbon, a symbol to Gu Kaizhi's painting\n\n* Compare Gu Kaizhi’s works and the Boston tomb tile’s brushworks and facial expressions:\n\n- The Mountain and the Hunter, early landscape, Song dynasty copy; understanding the world as rise and fall, apogee and decline, repetitive cycle; naturalism and symbolic elements appear\n\n- The Nymph of the Luo River, after Gu Kaizhi (344-406), late Tang or early Song copy, handscroll, ink and slight color on silk, Smithsonian Institution, Freer Gallery of Art: early landscape elements are found; illustrates Zao Chi’s poem (whose nymph is assumed to be the poet's brother, 조비's wife 견씨); there are several versions of Gu Kaizhi's copy\n\n* Two significant advances: the invention of a continuous pictorial narrative in which same characters reappear several times; the development of landscape art, as components of a coherent physical environment; landscape is both representation and the symbol of the nymph's physical appearance\n\n* A new female image praised for her beauty instead of her moral superiority appeared: a new artistic tradition invented by the painter; introduces a new way of portraying a royal figure and his/her attendants\n\n* Fu is a Chinese prose-poem, 여덞걸음 안에 시를 지을 것 (or one may be executed).\n\nSeven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Eastern Jin Dynasty\n\n* They have never met each other, but shared similar views to each other: later in Tang dynasty, they were grouped and savored as a famous topic for the arts; they were against moralism of Confucianism and later were grouped by people as an intellectual community\n\n- The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove and Rong Qiqi, molded brick relief, Eastern Jin Dynasty, Xishanqiao, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province: the figure is Xi Kang, a master of Chin; an instrument contradistinction to the musical ensemble in court ceremony; they became a new cultural symbol during the Southern Dynasties; designed by two different artists, probably\n\n* Xi Kang (223-262) one of the Seven Sages, a Wei dynasty scholar renowned for his music, an inventor of musical instrument.\n\nDay 4\n\nAfter Gu Kaizhi (344-406), Nymph of the Luo River, 4th century, Freer Gallery & Liaoning Museum & Beijing Palace Museum: a first example of figural representation instead of symbolic representation; recurring motifs in later landscape are anticipated; figures are floating on the landscape, (indicating real world and dream world?) and landscape features were also floating sometimes\n\n- End section of Freer version, in which the poet contemplates his abandonment by the river nymph\n\nShan-shui, Mountains and Water Painting\n\n* Chinese character's origin traces back to Shang dynasty's carved clay inscription. This carving may be the reason why the characters have thin line shape. Later seal script was developed from this. In Han dynasty, each regal reign recorded its histories in a vast amount of texts. This became a standard of calligraphy at the early stage (classics). After paper was invented, with flexible brush, literati began to use this format as a kind of personal expression.\n\nWang Xizhi (303-361), 왕희지, a developer of artistic calligraphic script, running or walking script (신서?) and grass script (초서); the freely flowing line, executed spontaneously without a moment's hesitation; maintaining a sense of balance and wholeness\n\n- Wang Xizhi, Ritual to Pray for Good Harvest (Xingrang tie), letter mounted as handscroll, Tang dynasty tracing copy (7th century), ink on ying huang paper, Princeton University art museum\n\n* Colophones and seal scripts are later added by posterities\n\n* Many of his calligraphy are not fully intelligible these days. But people have enjoyed its look.\n\n* Extreme Confucian scholars did not like grass script for its \"amorality\": Xizhi had a Daoist sense of freedom, and often entered into the Confucian scholarly community; these two features are combined in his calligraphic art; compare his script with Gu Kaizhi's clerical script (Li shu), which is ornamental like his expression of garments;\n\n* Kai shu is later formalized script from Li shu\n\n- Wang Xizhi, Preface to the Poems Composed at Orchid Pavilion (Lanting xu), 353, Xingshu (running script), Palace Museum, Beijing: Wang's invitation of his literati peers to his spring purification festival; these members were aficionado of the spirits of seven sages; they made poems and played music, improvisational pieces; the preface for the collective artistic pieces\n\nTao Qian (365-427), a poet, a literati scholar who worked in a government: after quitting his job he came back to his life unsullied by secular affairs; the idea of Lao Tzu, that words are very different from existence is obvious in his poems; first poet who used individual voice\n\nThe Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534)\n\nDuring 한무제 (Han Wuze), China could not block all the northern nomads come into his dynasty: Yuezhi was nomadic pastoral people (originally from Kushan dynasty at current day Afghanistan and Pakistan) who later established the Northern Wei (need to check); silk road's Chinese side was very dangerous to travel through; early Chinese Buddhist monks travelled the way risking their lives; the earliest Buddhist scripts were translated at that time\n\n* Museum strives to prove the originality of art works especially paintings (forgery is relatively easy in this case)\n\nCaves of the Thousand Buddhas, Mogao Grottos, Dunhuang, Gansu Province, China: on the tradesmen and pilgrim's travel route; Buddhism entered China through this way; preserved many Buddhist works after the Great Persecution of Buddhism during the Tang dynasty\n\n- The Enlightenment Moment, Cave 254, Northern Wei: Siddhartha's meditation for 40 days under a Boddhi tree: Mara, a kind of evil demon, tried to distract him with various stratagem; colorful style, and strong figures\n\n(* Giving an oms? what does it mean?)\n\n- The Buddha Preaching, with Attendant Bodhisattvas and Apsaras, Cave 249, Dunhuang, Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, Northern Wei: Buddha shows some marks of his symbols, like long ears and halo; his hand gesture indicates \"fear not (mudra?)\"; curvilinear forms appear.\n\n* It is uncertain how much interconnected between Dunhuang and Changsha areas were: because Changsha was a very international city, there would have been interaction\n\n- The Sacrifice for a Hungry Tigress (Mahasattva jataka), Dunhuang, Cave 254, Northern Wei Dynasty: triangle forms are mountains; it shows early landscape and Buddhist worldview\n\n- Deer King Jataka (Ruru Jataka), Cave 257, West wall, fifth century, Northern Wei Dynasty: a golden deer with precious looking is Buddha's previous life; the silhouette shows a high quality of presence of the golden deer; the tale deals with a Buddhist principle, Karma; generosity is more stressed than justice\n\n(Asoka, a king of India, converted his nation to a Buddhist nation; he sent missionaries to outside India)\n\n- Mountain Landscape with Leaping Creatures, Cave 285, south wall, sixth century, Western Wei Dynasty: mountains and creatures appear\n\n- Northern Wei Emperor Worshiping the Buddha, relief, early 6th century, the Central Binyang cave, Longmen, Henan Province. This stone-carving image resembles the Nymph.\n\n* Around 494, both northern and southern artistic styles began to integrate under the Northern Wei's change of their capital to Luoyang. In this respect, the relief's visual resemblance to southern hand scroll painting is no coincidence. Northern Wei's royal members adopted southern way of living and customs, language, surnames, and rituals.\n\n- Stories of filial sons images (Filial Grandson) carved on stone sarcophagus, Luoyang, Henan Province, early 6th century, Northern Wei Dynasty: its content is overtly conservative, and women's image is generally neglected: but its compositional and figurative styles are extremely modern: striking three-dimensionality with recessional effects, and naturalistic\n\n* Besides linear perspective system, there is another mode of representing space: front and back and mirror images\n\n- Figures in Landscape, ink rubbing of an engraving on Ning Mao's shrine, 529, Luoyang, Henan Province. Filial stories are illustrated in vertical panel.\n\n- Three portraits of Ning Mao, from same shrine above. Ning Mao here is illustrated in his three different ages with distinct features, which seem to suggest from his vigorous youth to final spiritual enlightenment.\n\n- Gentlemen in Landscape, mural in Cui Fen's tomb, 551, Linxu, Shandong Province. Its landscape and figures both achieve the Fusion of southern and northern art in the sixth century.\n\nDay 5\n\n* PPT plate is the only source for exams\n\nReview\n\nAt the fifth century, early Buddhist murals at Dunhuang\n\n- Deer King Jataka (Ruru Jataka), Cave 257, west wall, Northern Wei dynasty, Dunhuang\n\n- Landscape from the Admonitions of the instructress . . . much realistic form, avant-garde and complex manner of depicting rock formation. Sophisticated approach to rocks combined each other, still linear.\n\nLecture\n\n- The filial grandson, Stone Sarcophagus, stone carving on sarcophagus, 520-30, Northern Wei dynasty; it is a story of taking old grandfather to the woods to reduce a mouth in the house; grandson's cleverness warned his father from doing it; trees are depicted like the one from \"the seven sages of bamboo\" painting; one needs to guess what painting was like during the period; even wind is blowing the trees\n\n- Detail from the filial Wang, recessional effect, diagonal direction: coming and going\n\nSome Tang and Pre-Tang texts on Painting (from PDF)\n\n9th century, Zhang Yanyuan, China's first art historian: he wrote an art history text titled, Lidai minghua ji [record of famous painters of all period] (847).\n\n* On Painting, \"Now painting is a thing which perfects civilized teachings and helps social relationships. It penetrates completely the divine permutations of nature and fathoms recondite and subtle things.\"\n\n* On Gu Kaizhi, in a highly praising tone \"His conception was kept whole in his mind before he used his brush, so that when the painting was all finished the conception was in it. . . .\"\n\n* On Zong Bing/Tsung Ping (Gu’s contemporary, 375-443) a Shanshui painter: he painted things from his experience of a series of travels and roaming\n\nThe painting of mountains and rivers (Shanshui)\n\nThe idea of Yin - Yang is a very prevailing idea, opposites as complementary parts, opposites that constitute a whole: mountains are basically giant huge rock, contesting its hardness, and river is fluid and soft that complements the hardness of mountains; the vision of the wholeness of life, and nature is a greatness, and people dwell within it\n\nThe Significance of Landscape (from PDF)\n\nZong Bing, \"As for landscape, it has physical existence, yet tends toward the spiritual. Landscapes display the beauty of the Tao through their forms, and humane men delight in this\": “the Kun-lun mountains are immense and the eyes’ pupils small.

They merged a vast area in central Asia, and Silk Road came under their management. Their capital city, Chang'an's population was estimated more than a million. Tang made a truly global culture.\n\nEmperor Minghuang's reign is generally considered the most brilliant era in all Chinese history. There were so many great writers and artists lived at a single moment: the poets Wang Wei, Li Bai, Du Fu; the painters Wu daozi, Zhang Xuan, and Han Gan; and the calligrapher Yan Zhenqing, Zhang Xu, and Huaisu.\n\nAn Lushan's rebellion in 755 brought end to the golden age. Because of this event Minghuang fled to Sichuan, and abdication.\n\nAfter the second half of the dynasty, its art never again approached its former greatness. Two major historical works were made after the decline.\n\n- Zhang Yanyuan, Record of Famous Paintings of Successive Dynasties,\n\n- Zhu Jingxuan, Celebrated Painters of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThree periods of painting's development\n\nSui and early Tang (581 -712)\n\nHighly politicized art in both religious and secular painting genres, and emperors themselves as strong patrons of art. Painters included Zhan Ziqian, Dong Boren, Weichi Bazhina, and Sakyamuni (Indian) + many others. Competition from schools abounded.\n\nMural and scroll paintings\n\nArtists of this period were primarily engaged in mural paintings, involved in political and religious monuments for perhaps previous Northern Dynasties's influences. Scrolls also had strong political and religious implications.\n\nFigure Painting in Tang\n\nYan Liben (ca 600-673), a member of aristocratic class, inherited his father's versatile talent. With is brother, Yan Lide, a famous architect and court designer, he supervised the construction of the emperor Taizong's mausoleum. Later, he became a prime minister, while his brother earned the title of grand duke. Due to Tang dynasty's emphasis on military forces and literature and arts, he took charge of the latter affairs in his country, and lived as a virtually a court historian.\n\n- A Battle Charger, attributed to Yan Lide and Yan Liben, stone carving, Emepror Taizong's tomb, Liquan, Shaanxi Province, 7th century\n\n- Attributed to Yan Liben, The Imperial Sedan Chair, handscroll, ink and color on silk, a Song dynasty copy.\n\n- Thirteen Emperors from . . . , the figure was intended to depict certain weaknesses in his character, though today's art historians do not exaggerate that much\n\n- Court Ladies, 706 CE, From a mural in Princess Yongtai's tomb in Qianxian, Shaanxi Province, the idea of feminine beauty had come from the Silk Road, the central Asia area.\n\nFrom the Silk Road: an International style\n\n- Pure Land Paradise, wall painting of Mogao Cave 217, early 8th century, Dunhuang, Gansu: originally Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism (소승불교) saw Buddhas as individuals; but this work is influenced by Mahayana Buddhism (대승불교), which considers Buddhas not as individuals, and they also emphasized Bodhisattvas: Mahayana also promoted the idea of pure land paradise (극락정토); Amitabha Buddha (아미타여래) is the last Buddha who would come in the future\n\n- Amida Triad: Pure Land of Amitabha (replica of the original murals in the Horyuji temple kondo), late 7th century, Nara, Japan: symbols of various attributes in the depiction of the Buddha; the chakra symbolizes teaching of law, new dispensation; the central Buddha image has strong symmetrical composition; Bodhisattvas has more movement, with more diagonal posture; iconographically, bodhisattva is represented a previous life of Buddha, and is more approachable\n\n- The Buddha of the Amida Triad, Horyuji / The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara of the Amida Triad, Horyuji: Comparison between two Buddhist icons\n\n* The Buddhist art came to China from Gupta, India, and then disseminated to adjacent countries: during the Tang dynasty, the depiction of Buddha became standardized, symmetry and balance were paid in great efforts.\n\n* There were great persecutions to Buddhist during the middle and end of Tang dynasty, destroyed many works in this tradition: caves in Dunhuang and other countries' Buddhist arts give us hints on Tang dynasty's Buddhist art: why so antagonism? One of the reasons for the persecutions was that they feared Buddhists abandoning their families: Confucian scholars originally emerged as a counterbalance to the military forces, criticized Buddhism and provided significant causes for the anti-Buddhist movements: emperors sometimes treated these scholars good or bad, and this, there were always tensions between power and knowledge\n\n- Amitabha Paradise, south wall, Cave 220, Dunhuang: its details show Worshipper on a lotus subject, Flute Player, dancers, and so on\n\n* Lotus imagery came from India, and the idea of lotus is enlightenment: its root in the mud, and its growing up to the water surface represented the idea of understanding; this imagery was widely applied in various traditions including Hindi, Buddhism and others; it has references from Ananda's story (he is the one who wrote Buddha's lessons)\n\n- Guanyin(관음), Cave 57, 617-704 CE, early Tang dynasty, Mogao Caves, Dunhuang: depicting a principal Bodhisattva, reincarnated into a feminine deity, divine mother, and this tradition would have some relation with river god tradition in China;\n\nWu Daozi (680-740)\n\n- Vimalakirti in Debate with Manjusri, Cave 103, Dunhuang, Gansu: this work is thought to be a best reflection of Wu Daozi's art; born to a poor family, he was famous for the life-like use of calligraphic approach of brush strokes that dynamically thicken and thin; this painting depicts a debate between a Chinese Buddhist and an Indian Buddhist on their religious and social perspectives\n\n* Zhang Yanyuan called Wu his \"painting sage\"; he saw Wu's work completes Xie He’s all six principles\n\nPaintings of the Tang Court\n\nClassic Tang Dynasty landscape, \"Blue and Green Landscape\" is contrast to Wu Daozi's style: imperial Li Clan's members were most fervent practitioners of this landscape style; a legendary painting competition between Wu Daozi and a famous court artist tells us the difference between the two styles;\n\n* Three classes of artists, respectively, Nan (capable artists), Yao (honorable artists), Shan (Divine artists): Wu Daozi was of course among the Shan class\n\n- Spring Outing of the Tang Court, of Lady Guoguo's Spring Outing, Emperor Huizong's 11c copy of an 8th century painting by Zhang Xuan (713-755), handscroll painting, ink on silk: Huizong was also a great artist and calligrapher\n\n- Zhang Xuan, Lady Guoguo and Her Sisters on a Spring Outing, Song Dynasty copy.

However, Guanxiu and the unknown wall painter's distinctive powers, internal spirituality with grotesque exterior, and refinement of techniques, are characteristic of the highest achievements in later Song painting;\n\n* From Tang to Song dynasties, continuity in its figure tradition implies strong claims on the superiority of an ethnocentric authenticity lies on Han tribe.\n\nFive Dynasties (the early and middle of 10th century)\n\nShu kingdom of Sichuan, many fled from Tang capital its cultures remained there relatively intact, Tang's former miniature court in Chengdu\n\nGuanxiu (832-912), a late Tang painter-poet, he drew Arhans, Sakyamuni's disciples; having grotesque, tormented faces; reflecting the terrible persecution on Buddhism in the 9th century; \"psychological archaism\"\n\nThe most celebrated Buddhist monk painter, poet, and calligrapher: first painter known for his three arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy; extraordinarily, his works of these three arts still exist;\n\n- Two patriarchs Harmonizing Their Minds, ink on paper, 13th century copy after Shi Ke (c. 950); free brush work, clumsy and scratch brush or straw; yipin style, meaning expressive and spontaneous brush style;\n\n- Two Bodhisattvas Preparing Incense, fragment of a wall painting originally from the Cishengsi, Wenxian, Henan Province, 952 CE; sumptuous expression of the figure, still in a Tang dynasty's ideal tradition; survived the repeated persecutions on Buddhism in the 10th century; connected to the great Tang period wall painting, as well as tensile lines of Wu Daozi; its later reappearance is at 13th and 14th centuries in a large number;\n\nThe Development of Bird-and-Flower Painting\n\n- Huang Quan (903-965), Sketches of Birds and Insects, handscroll, ink and color on silk; 960; study of individual bird species and insects; an indication of studying nature in a very careful manner; faithful depiction; he was famous for his subject in the realm of aristocratic and wealthy; there were no real distinction between landscape, figure, and bird and flower genre paintings; they were all based on a careful observation of nature\n\n- Huang Jucai, Pheasant and Small Birds by a Jujube Shrub, hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, 975; the son of Haung Quan; also a bird and flower format; silk was the most common material for hanging scroll; painting on silk tended to be more detailed; emperor Huizong's documentation; some motifs from his father's study into a finished picture; workshop and hereditary tradition, a family trade; The Huangs' family style later becomes the standard for the newly established Song court\n\n* Also similar was the transmission of the Buddhist and Daoist painting tradition by the Guo family\n\nFrom the 10th century, Chinese painting slowly began to change and by the end of 11th century its central trend shifted from previous broad, large-scale wall painting to those used for refined, precise, and elegant miniature; changes parallel to the change of the way of seeing pictures, relation between object and viewer;\n\nThe Early Development of Landscape Painting in North China\n\nBy the beginning of the Song dynasty, something called a national style of landscape existed: paintings in this period, due to too many copies and obscure authenticity, are today appreciated based on its style of the master or school rather than whether these are originals or not; the successive and systematic government collections, and their documents and catalogues were of great help;\n\n- Jing Hao (855-915), Mount Kuanglu, hanging scroll, ink and light color on silk, ca. 900; he invented Zun brush stroke, meaning depth brush; water falls cascading down in the view; the artist also fled to mountains to live there; one of the earliest example of the real landscape tradition 진경; recalled as a theorist, scholar as well as painter; too advanced and far too expressive to have matched to Jing Hao's early landscape style, probably a kind of homage to Jing Hao\n\n* Emperor's collections were symbols of national identity, and during the Chinese-Japanese War, those elements were crated in boxes in safe places; during the Chinese civil war, Chang Kai-shek brought significant portion of the collection to Taiwan; those were secured during the Mao's Cultural Revolution; today the imperial collection is divided in Beijing and Taibei\n\nNotes on the Art of the Brush (from PDF)\n\nJing Hao (855-915), 10c, from his Pi-fa chi (Notes on the Arts of the Brush)\n\n\"Painting is to fathom the significance of things not just things' likeness\"\n\n* Jing Hao offers a modified scheme of the Six Laws established by Xie He, four centuries earlier.

The subordination or elimination of color was a move toward that end, since the tapestry-like variegation of early landscape had tended to fragment the composition. A new emphasis on brushwork gave surface consistency to the painting. Most important of all, methods were developed to create a spatial continuum within the picture: the use of concealing mists, the convincing depiction of recessions into depth, the drawing of distant objects in thinner tones of ink to suggest a hazy atmosphere. A landscape was no longer an assemblage of individual images, but set forth a coherent vision.”\n\nDay 8\n\nLecture\n\nMinghuang's exile to Shu, an epitome of Tang dynasty landscape\n\nWang Yu, the Tang dynasty theory of art sees a distinction between paintings embedded in philosophical traditions and merely concentrating on technical prowess\n\nWu Daozi, a use of line into a highly independent and exalted form of painting, suggested indirectly by a wall painting\n\nArt from Shu and Southern Tang\n\nShu and Southern Tang were two of the five dynasties, and many fled from the old capital, Chang'an to seek for refuge there.

Juran's evanescent air would have actually followed Li's art; it is often (incorrectly) thought Juran was followed by Li for Juran's more antecedent style; Juran is classified as Five Dynasties while Li is in Song painters;

a sense of moment, it depicts present; bending branches;\n\nDay 18\n\nLecture\n\n- Wu Zhen, Bamboo in the Wind, after Su Shi, Yuan dynasty, 1350, hanging scroll, ink on paper; there is no depth; the Su Shi's work was an engraving;\n\n- Detail, artist's inscription of the Bamboo painting, cursive script that is worth to be labeled Wu Zhen script;\n\n- Wu Zhen, Bamboo and Rock, Yuan Dynasty, hanging scroll, ink on paper, National Palace Museum, Taipei; looks like an engraved image; indexical; bamboo's depiction is quite two-dimensional; an ample sense of chi-yun; the rock indicates some sense of space and volume by using dim ink wash; a balance between representation and calligraphic brushstroke; there is no bluntness in the strokes;\n\n* Later, many painters professionalized bamboo painting genre and it technically and illusionistically developed, but the genre's early emphasis on chi-yun overall deteriorated\n\nPlum blossoms\n\nA sub-genre of painting like bamboo painting;\n\n- Wang Mian (1287-1359), Frangrant Snow at Broken Bridge, inscriber: (Frontispiece), Gu Dadian, colophon writer: Zhang Fengshi, handscroll, ink on silk, Metropolitan Museum of Art; blossoms are depicted very finely; little twigs and petals are dealt so delicately; it is in the time, a depiction of vivid moment; a fantasized, symbolized image, so strongly moved the minds of Asians for several centuries; at the heart of Japanese Ukiyoe is not far from it;\n\n- Wang Mian, Branches of Blossoming Plum, 1355, hanging scroll, ink on paper, Shanghai Museum; “The paining conveys something of the springtime experience of being enveloped in a cloud of fragrant blossoms, one of the many ways to enjoy flowering plum\" by Cahill; again, print-like quality\n\n- Zou Fulei, A Breath of Spring, handscroll, ink on paper, 1360, Freer Gallery of Art; one sweeps then a branch, powerful strokes governing the composition; holding chi-yun, the energy; it is less a calligraphic statement, but a direct expression exploding outward; the rough surface of bark; using every technique; he was a lesser known painter, but an “extremely” accomplished master; check out Cahill's explanation from the PDF; “his plum branch is one of the most perfectly controlled performances in brush and ink in all Chinese painting”; each petals are drawn by droppings of ink left untouched till dried;\n\nFang Congyi (1301 ~ after 1378)\n\n- Fang Congyi, Romantic Spirit of the Eastern Chin, dated 1360, handscroll, ink and color on paper, C. C. Wang family collection, New York; the shore gradually fades away into the left scene; \"gradually dissolving from dense dark mass into transparent emptiness\"; people in the pavilion; ripples on the water surface; a reference to the Eastern Chin master calligrapher Wang Xizhi; \"the religiosity in life equals religiosity in art\"; check out Barnhart's PDF comments; the artist was a Daoist priest, 도인; \"untrammeled spirituality\"; great combination of ink wash and brush lines; one can see Muqi in it; why not noticing on the sheer sense of religiosity?; though many Yuan dynasty artists were Taoist, Fang was a Taoist priest himself; Buddhist and Taoist temples were major institutions of producing works of art along with royal academy; “This is not something that ordinary mortals can attain, but is a work of the highest order of the untrammeled class”\n\n- Fang Congyi, Could Mountain, ca. 1365, handscroll, ink and color on paper, The Metropolitan Museum of Art; again begins from dense dark mass moving to faint center, and then mountains appear only to finally dissolve into emptiness; echoing composition from the triangular shape of trees on the right and similar shape of mountain mass on the left; the mountain is delicately and lightly treated; Amano Yoshitaka-like mountain is obviously riveting\n\n* Form is a condensation of spirit; from shapeless to shape, again into shapeless\n\n“Among the three great visionary artists of late Yuan painting in southeast Chian, Fang Congyi’s legacy is the least transferable. Wang Meng gave to later masters the concept of rich painterly form—energized, dense, and tactile—which became the structural foundation of much later art. Ni Zan crystallized a bleak, barren state of mind and minimalist technique, which became a counter idea. Fang Congyi, however, pursued some private inner voice, which spoke to him of eternity, oneness, and the spirit. Perhaps Tao-chi (b. 1642) among all later painters most nearly shared Fang’s ideals. Fang’s achievement, which enters the realm of spirit, fittingly suggests the gradual internalization of expression that led from the fourteenth century to the Ming mystic Shen Chou [Shen Zhou] and beyond to the free spirit of seventeenth-century Chinese art, Tao-chi—and allows me to finish this appreciation without implying that there has been an end.”\n\nDay 19\n\nEmail topic for the final paper!\n\nLecture\n\nThe Ming Dynasty (1368 ~ 1644)\n\n* The first emperor Zhou Yuanzhang emerged from a lowest class, and he persecuted scholars and artists; the early Ming art pursued traditions of Yuan dynasty, but their specific qualities were not to be recaptured (why should they capture it in a different period?)\n\n- Shi Rui (act. 1426 ~ 1453), Greeting the New Year, handscroll, ink, color and gold on silk, Cleveland Museum of Art; a court painter of the early Ming; depicted in a typically Southern Song manner; more intimate and lyrical atmosphere; consciously archaistic mountains reminding one of the Northern or pre-northern Song dynasty landscape; super exquisite, as many other Chinese paintings;\n\n- Wang E (c. 1462 ~ 1541), Gazing at a Distant View from a Riverside Pavilion, hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, Palace Museum, Beijing; distance is depicted with hazy effect;\n\n- Bian Jingzhao, Bamboo and Cranes, hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, Palace Museum, Beijing; he is a very important early Ming painter; during the Ming, more emphasis was put on decoration and technical prowess; decorative and ornamental rather than realistic as it seem"
