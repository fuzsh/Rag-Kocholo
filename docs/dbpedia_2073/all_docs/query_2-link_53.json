        "text": "1. AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ANCIENT CHINESE NUMISMATICS\n\nThough still young as a science, Chinese numismatics has had a long history. It may be said to have had its inception in the sixth century when a scholar named Liu compiled China's first coin catalogue, which was entitled Ch'ien chih (Records of Coins). According to Sun I-jang (1848—1908), the numismatist Liu was Liu Ch'ien (484—550) who is better known for his other scholarly works.1 Liu Ch'ien's catalogue seems to have been lost some time during the Sui dynasty (581—618). Our information about him and his numismatic work is derived from references to him and a few quotations from his writings by a contemporary, Ku Hsüan, compiler of the famous Ch'ien p'u (Coin catalogue).2\n\nThe text of Ku Hsüan's catalogue has also been lost. The work is recorded in the section on literature in the official history for the Sui dynasty , and passages from it are quoted in the Ch'üan chih (Records of Coins) by Hung Tsun (1120—1174).3 Judging from these quotations, Ku Hsüan's catalogue seems to have had no specimens of coins of the Chou period, and of the periods following the Chou dynasty he apparently recorded only the few coins which he had seen himself. The later the coin, the more detailed his description, which usually included the coin's design, its legend and its issuing date. His method of coin description became the pattern for later Chinese numismatists.\n\nKu Hsüan was followed by a few numismatists during the T'ang dynasty (618—907). Among them the most famous is Füng Yen, a scholar who is better known for his \"Things Seen and Things Heard,\" whose work on coins is entitled Hsü ch'ien p'u, presumably a coin catalogue supplementing the one by Ku Hsüan. Although this work is lost also, enough fragments have been preserved to give us an idea of the work done in numismatics by the T'ang scholars. The first recorded discovery of Chou coins seems to have taken place in Füng Yen's time. For each coin known to have come from a find, he recorded the circumstances of its discovery and the conditions under which he was able to examine it.4 Otherwise, his statements were confined to the shape and size of the coin and the structural composition of the characters in the legend. He did not, however, venture to interpret the meaning of the legend.\n\nThough limited in scope, the numismatists of T'ang were unpresumtuous and their reports seem to be reliable. The same cannot be said of the numismatists of the Sung dynasty (960—1279 A. D.) which followed T'ang. By their time both the Early Knife coins and the Old Spade coins of the Chou period had been unearthed. Judging from the information available, all these pieces bore legends. Puzzled by the strange archaic forms of the characters in the inscriptions and firmly believing in the legendary stories of prehistoric China which had been built up gradually since the Han time (206 B. C.—220 A. D.), the numismatists and historians of the Sung dynasty indulged in conjectural decipherment and interpretation of the Chou coin legends. They believed all these coins to be of prehistoric origin. Tung Yu (fl. 1101—1125), compiler of a coin catalogue, assigned some Chou coins as issues of the period of T'ai-hao, a legendary figure of the very early mythical history of China . Dissatisfied with Tung Yu's attribution as being too late, Lo Mi, an historian well versed in legendary history, placed a coin as early as Kuo-t'ien,5 another mythical figure who, if he ever actually lived, would have been contemporary with the Peking Man. Hung Tsun's Ch'üan chih, the earliest coin catalogue extant, was a product of this period.\n\nHowever ill founded the allegations of the Sung scholars were, their opinions prevailed for some six hundred years in the field of Chinese numismatics and lasted well into the eighteenth century. Liu Shih-lu, one of the foremost numismatists of the nineteenth century, still attributed spade coins of Liang, capital of the state of Wei, of the Chan-kuo period (403—221 B. C.), to the dynasties of Yü and Hsia, both of which precede the Shang dynasty in the second millennium B. C. Another of his conjectures, likewise groundless, considered these coins as issues for use in the payment of fines. His interpretations are contained in his essay, the Yü Hsia shu-chin shih-wün,6 which later became a classic, widely read and admired by both Chinese and Western numismatists into the early years of the twentieth century. The dependence of Chinese numismatic studies on mythology did not disappear until Ts'ai Yün (1764—1824), an historian and philologist interested in numismatics, declared that the ancient copper coins preserved today were not objects of remote antiquity but were rather currencies which \"flourishingly circulated during the Ch'un-Ch'iu and the Chan-kuo periods (770—221 B. C.).\"7\n\nLike Chinese classics, philology and history, Chinese numismatics witnessed an unprecedented advancement in the Manchu period (1644—1911) and produced a methodology that can be considered scientific. In the decipherment of the coin inscriptions, especially those on the coins of the Chou period, there are the famous names of Ts'ai Yün, Ma Ang and Liu Hsin-yüan.8 Of these, Ts'ai Yün is also known for his contribution to the studies of coin chronology. These scholars demonstrated that the legends on the Chou coins are not the names of T'ai-hao and Kuo-t'ien but the names of cities or towns of the Chou period. Not one of these three scholars, however, was a professional numismatist; their chief interest and contributions were historical and epigraphic.\n\nIn a narrow sense of the term, scientific numismatics was not established in China until the publication in 1864 of the famous catalogue, Ku ch'üan hui, by Li Tso-hsien.9 This catalogue contains illustrations of more than five thousand specimens accompanied by decipherment of their legends and, whenever possible, notes of their history. The author examined carefully and determined the authenticity of every specimen in his catalogue, and excluded those whose authenticity he could not verify. This careful attitude is not found in the works of any of his predecessors. It may be safely said that his is the first scientific work in Chinese numismatics. Up to the present time his catalogue is still regarded as the best and most reliable by numismatists. It constitutes the backbone of the comprehensive Ku ch'ien ta tz'ǔ-tien (Encyclopaedia of Old Coins) published in 1938.10\n\nIn spite of the progress made by scholars and numismatists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, study of coins in China failed to arouse wide attention. It was pursued largely by a limited group of wealthy gentry and retired officials. These elderly gentlemen, withdrawn from the tumultuous experiences of earlier years, foundserenity of life in the companionship of antiquities. In satisfying their personal desires for large collections and in persistent search for rare specimens, they did a great service to the study of an important phase of ancient Chinese civilization in gathering the basic materials for its serious study. The only regrettable fact is that, in many cases, these men, not being trained historians and philologists, were unable to undertake satisfactorily the study of the coins. As a result, they needed the assistance of the epigraphers in deciphering coin legends. These epigraphers, in their study of the inscriptions on Shang and Chou bronzes, were led to the study of those on coins in the hope that it might help their primary work. This situation produced a somewhat bilateral development in ancient Chinese numismatics. On the one hand, the collector-numismatists studied the coin specimens but were unable to contribute substantially in deciphering the legends; on the other hand, the epigraphical scholars studied their inscriptions but neglected all other aspects of the coins. Neither group possessed the knowledge of the other, but both contributed toward the advancement of ancient Chinese numismatics. If the knowledge and the interest of both had been combined, numismatic studies in China might have advanced further.\n\nChinese numismatists of the nineteenth century paid little attention in their studies to the evidence of the coins themselves.11 Li Tso-hsien, the foremost Chinese numismatist of that century, did formulate a proposed systematic program for numismatic studies some ten years after his famous catalogue was published in 1864. This embraced investigation of the following: epigraphy on coins, metrology, the shapes and designs of coins, provenance, stories and anecdotes about coins and collectors, and rare specimens and specimens recorded but not seen.12 Li's proposed methodology marked a great step forward. Especially commendable is his emphasis on inquiry into the provenance of coins and their metrology. Yet, effort along these lines alone is not sufficient to enable us to exploit fully the evidence that coins can provide concerning the history of economic institutions. Study of the physical characteristics of the coins and of their inscriptions constitute the foundation of Chinese numismatics, but they alone are not enough. In order to fully understand the historical significance of the coins we must examine them against the general political, social and economic background of the period in which they circulated. Therefore, a competent numismatist must not only be an able coin examiner but an epigrapher and historian as well.13 So far, no Chinese numismatist has attained this happy combination.\n\nIn recent years, serious attempts have been made to raise the level of numismatic studies in China . In 1938, Ting Fu-pao published the coin encyclopaedia, Ku ch'ien ta tz'ǔ-tien. In this work he entered many published specimens of Chinese coins and specimens in the possession of private collectors in China . A large proportion of the illustrations are reproductions from coin rubbings. Under each specimen he has given all previously published statements and discussions concerning it, and these have been reproduced by photographic process so that they may contain no errors. It is the most comprehensive coin catalogue in Chinese.\n\nIn 1940 the Chinese Numismatic Society was established in Shanghai by a group of coin collectors and numismatists. It published a bi-monthly Ch'üan-pi, known in English as Chinese Numismatics, to promote numismatic studies. In his introductory words explaining the plans and aims of the Society in publishing the bi-monthly, Chang Chiung-po outlines a program of numismatic studies which the members of the organization are asked to follow. He first expresses his dissatisfaction with the attitude of Chinese scholars and historians who have hitherto regarded coins as \"small things\" unworthy of their attention. He urges rectification of this mistaken attitude and the recognition of coins as valid historical material. He suggests that \"systematic researches\" must be made of them in which the examination of actual specimens be made, historical records be consulted, and that coins be treated as relics of an economic and historical institution which can be studied in the light of monetary theories. Commenting on the situation in which persons writing about the history of coinage do not actually handle the coins and those who actually handle them lack the necessary scientific training to write about coinages, he states that there must be a combination of both.14\n\nOn the whole, Chang's program is well conceived, as it pointedly sets out to rectify the weaknesses in past Chinese numismatic studies. The bi-monthly appeared periodically until the end of 1945. It carried some interesting discussions and a number of articles which were written on a much higher level than ever before. But on the whole the effort of the members of the Chinese Numismatic Society fell short of the goal set by Chang Chiung-po.\n\nHowever imperfect the writings of the members of the Chinese Numismatic Society may have been, their efforts in themselves are significant contributions toward advancement of numismatic studies in China . It is regrettable that the bi-monthly of the Society had to exist during the Japanese aggression in China and thus had its influence greatly limited.\n\nIn Japan , Chinese numismatics has been a favorite field with some Japanese sinologists. In that country, too, the study of old coins was generally regarded as a hobby of collectors with means and leisure, and was not accorded the attention it deserved until recently. In the last few decades Japanese archaeologists have conducted some extensive excavations in Korea , Manchuria and Jehol, and in many of the old Chinese remains they found coins of the Chou, the Han and Wang Mang Periods, with which they dated the remains. The discovery of ancient Chinese coins by these archaeological missions seems to have stimulated numismatic interest among Japanese scholars. Probably for this reason, ancient Chinese coins, not only those unearthed from the old remains but also those in the hands of collectors, suddenly acquired the dignity of archaeological objects. It was among Japanese scholars that the question of the initial date of Chinese metallic coinage was first discussed in a scholarly manner.15 These discussions did not prove very fruitful because historical scholarship was not well combined with actual knowledge of the coins, and because the historical sources were not fully understood and exhausted. However, a proper approach was made toward one of the many problems of Chinese coinage.\n\nIn 1938, the same year in which the Encyclopedia of Old Coins was published in China , the Tōa senshi (Catalogue of Eastern Asiatic Coins) by Okutaira Masahiro appeared in Japan .16 The catalogue consists of eighteen volumes of which twelve are devoted to Chinese coins. The specimens listed in it are illustrated with reproductions of well-made rubbings. Besides its typographical excellence, the work can be commended for the number of specimens of rare coins of the Chou period it includes which are not to be found in other coin catalogues. In the decipherment of a number of the controversial coin legends, Okutaira follows the suggestions of Liu Hsin-yüan and Kuo Mo-jo, noted Chinese experts in epigraphical studies of the Shang and Chou bronzes, whose decipherments have been neglected so far by Chinese numismatists. Closely following Kuo Mo-jo, Okutaira attempts to reconstruct the early history of Chinese coinage by making use of the inscriptions on the bronzes of the Shang and Chou period. We know of no Chinese numismatists who have ever systematically utilized this valuable source of information.\n\nAnother merit of the catalogue is its illustration of a few specimens of silver ingots and paper money, through which Okutaira has shown superiority over his Chinese colleagues in the realization that study of copper coins alone is not sufficient for a complete understanding of the Chinese monetary system. The work, however, contains no illustrations of coin moulds, also important material in the study of Chinese historical coinages, and a few of those which are listed are likely fabrications.\n\nIn the Western languages, books and articles on Chinese coinage and monetary history have been published in French, English and German. The names of Biot, Vissering and Lacouperie are the most prominent. While in China the effort to reconstruct a general monetary history of China was motivated by the study of the ancient coins and their inscriptions, in the West that effort seems to have been a result of literary researches. The material on which the works of both Biot and Vissering17 are based is of such a nature. There were no studies of ancient Chinese coins on an appreciable scale until Lacouperie, who in 1892 published his Catalogue of Chinese Coins. This work is the most comprehensive treatment of the earlier Chinese coins yet produced by a Western numismatist.\n\nIn preparing his work Lacouperie benefited from the intellectual heritage of the Western world. At his time, the numismatic studies of Greece and Rome had developed to maturity, and Lacouperie was able to draw upon the experience of the classical numismatists in tackling some of the problems in Chinese numismatics. This is probably the reason why he shows superiority over his Chinese contemporaries in his historical approach to Chinese coins. However, being a Westerner, Lacouperie naturally suffered from handicaps in preparing his work. He had insufficient training in the Chinese language to avoid misunderstandings of the texts of Chinese historical records.18 His knowledge of Chinese ancient history appears rather limited, and his inexperience in determining authenticity of the coins caused him to enter many spurious specimens in this catalogue.19 He does seem to have had training in Chinese philology — the \"ancient script\" and its evolution — which is absolutely indispensable in deciphering the coin legends or in judging the plausibility of the decipherments which have been advanced. While in most cases he follows the decipherment of Chinese scholars, he has been confident enough to make up some of his own, on which he formed his theory of the so-called \"monetary unions.\" As L. C. Hopkins has pointed out,20 Lacouperie sometimes offers his conjectures as if they were facts, and he makes statements which actually have no foundation.21\n\nWe should not, however, underrate Lacouperie's contributions because of these shortcomings. If we read his book against the background of his time, we realize it was an admirable accomplishment. When we examine the discussions and publications which appeared after him and in which his influence can be directly or indirectly detected, we must recognize that he contributed much toward the advancement of Chinese numismatics in the Western world.\n\nNext to Lacouperie among Western numismatists we find the name of Henry A. Ramsden. A scholar and a collector who collected to study, he promoted interest in the study of Oriental coins in general and Chinese coins in particular. \"During his life,\" states H. F. Bowker, \"he was the prime-mover in the study of the coins of his speciality, and was most probably the direct cause of the popularity which the coins of the Orient enjoyed in the United States during the last years of his life.\"22 In 1913 and the year following he edited the Numismatic and Philatelic Journal of Japan , the bilingual organ of the Yokohama Numismatic Society of which he was then the chairman. The journal devoted part of its pages to the study of Chinese numismatics. In that field Ramsden's interest covered a wide range from \"barter money\" to modern coinage, from metallic currency to paper money. A complete list of his works is found in \"Ramsdeniana,\" in which the author praises him as \"the foremost writer and most competent occidental authority in ... Far Eastern numismatics\" at the time of his death in 1915.23\n\nSince 1915 sinological studies in both Europe and North America have advanced considerably, and consequently the interest in Chinese coins has grown wider not only among collectors and museums but also among students of Chinese history. Yet, ancient Chinese numismatic studies have not progressed as might be desired.\n\nIn 1934, a group of Westerners residing in China formed the Numismatic Society of China in Shanghai , and subsequently published six bulletins, all of which deal with the modern coinage of China . In 1940, after the Chinese Numismatic Society was established, it associated itself with the latter in an attempt to combine the efforts of both organizations in the promotion of Chinese numismatic studies in China and abroad.\n\nIf, in the last thirty years, Western numismatists have not produced commendable work in the field of ancient Chinese coinage, a preparatory step has been well taken in the publication A Bibliography on Far Eastern Numismatics by A. B. Coole and A Numismatic Bibliography of the Far East by H. F. Bowker. The former bibliography is devoted to the listing of numismatic works in Chinese and Japanese, while the latter, supplementing the former, covers the literature in Western languages. Both were carefully prepared and are convenient reference works.\n\nIn the above sketch we may have appeared hypercritical in some of our remarks. It is not intended to discredit our predecessors. The scholarship of one man is bound to be limited, as are his physical energy and the scholarly achievement of his age. If, at the present, numismatists are able to see more problems and penetrate more deeply into them, this is largely owing to the advancement of historical studies in general and Chinese numismatics in particular.

DIFFICULTIES IN THE STUDY OF ANCIENT CHINESE COINS\n\nA. Decipherment of Legends\n\nObservations on the size, weight, fabric, and mint locations of coins can shed invaluable light on the early monetary history of China . The valid interpretation of any of these elements depends on the correct decipherment of the coin's legend. As we have already noted, decipherments of coin legends have in the past been made by epigraphical scholars whose main interest was ancient script and not coins. As a rule, collector-numismatists have followed the readings of these scholars, but, in cases where none had yet been made, they attempted their own. They were not trained in epigraphy, and some had not even enough knowledge of philology to determine which of several possible decipherments was the most plausible. Often a collector's guess would be colored by an eagerness to enhance the value of his coin.\n\nThe mint name (lin, written ) in modem script) on a group of late spades has been variously read as (lu), (yü), (huang), (huang-fu), (chia), (huo), and (kuan). The last reading, kuan, which was suggested by Ma Ang and publicised by Li Tso-hsien, prevailed in the numismatic world for many years. It was followed by Lacouperie and all other Western numismatists. Since neither Ma Ang nor Li Tso-hsien found Kuan as a place name in historical literature, they assumed the character to be an abbreviation for \"kuan-chung,\" a term denoting a region which is now central Shensi. Lacouperie mistakenly called it the \"capital city of Ts'in.\" The correct decipherment of the character, strangely enough, is said to have been made many years before the above suggestions were advanced, by Sun Hsing-yen (styled Yüan-ju, 1753—1818), a scholar in Chinese classics and philology and not a numismatist.24 Sun deciphered the character as the name of a town in the state of Chao during the Chan-kuo period. All numismatists acquainted with recent numismatic studies follow his decipherment.\n\nSuperior as opinions of epigraphical scholars are in decipherment of coin inscriptions, they are not always correct. Take the character for instance, which appears on many Late Spades. Some numismatists read it pa-huo or \"eight huo,\" 25 the latter character being used here in the sense of a denominational unit. This reading is incorrect. Actually, it is a single character, not a monogram of two; and no part of the character can be construed as huo. Epigraphical scholars read it as fün , meaning \"belongs to the reign of.\"26 This decipherment is also wrong, for it is not suggested on the basis of the character's structural identity with fün, but on its resemblance to it. The correct reading is pan (half), a denominational term (with the name of the unit understood) of the coinage of the Chou period. When these coins were in circulation there were only two denominations, a full unit and a half, the unit being chin . The weight of the coin bearing the legend pan (half) is just half that of the full unit piece.27 Had the epigraphers gathered and weighed specimens of both sizes they would not have escaped this conclusion. The same holds true for the deonominational term ling which is found on the larger spades of the state of Ch'in (Late Spade IV) and which has been improperly deciphered.28 By weighing spade coins of Liang of various sizes, Kuo Mo-jo, an able contemporary epigrapher, ascertained the correct reading of the eight-character legend which they bore.29 It was only after an investigation of the provenance of a group of late square foot spades that Okutaira accepted Kuo Mo-jo's suggestion that their legend reads \"Hsiang-p'ing,\" a mint located in present day southern Manchuria.30 These examples show how important it is to combine epigraphical and philological with numismatic evidence. The use of one of these types of evidence to the exclusion of the others constitutes one of the chief obstacles encountered in numismatic works of the past as well as the present. It is this situation which is responsible for many unacceptable decipherments, which will have to be reconsidered or discarded in the present study.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n24\n\nQuoted by Hsü Yüan-k'ai (Ku ch'ien ta-tz'ǔ-tien, XIII, 499a).\n\n25\n\nSuch as Li Tso-hsien, op. cit.

Use of Epigraphical Evidence in Dating Coins\n\nSome numismatists may cherish the idea that a comparison of the epigraphy of the coins with that of the bronze vessels of the Shang and Chou periods should furnish criteria for dating the coins. This task, however, is not as easy as it appears at first glance.\n\nThere are two aspects of ancient Chinese epigraphy: (a) the structural form of the character and (b) the style or manner of executing the character. So far as the structural form of the characters is concerned two changes have taken place which have bearing on the epigraphical chronology of Chinese script. In the course of time, many characters have undergone simplification while many others have become more complicated through acquisition of signifies (i. e., radicals signifying \"water,\" \"walled city,\" etc.). In other words, with some characters, the more complicated their form the older they are; with others, the simpler their form, the older they are. On coins of the Chou period we sometimes find simpler forms of characters of the second group in inscriptions of pieces of a considerably late date, when the complicated form of the character had become the norm. Because of this circumstance, dependence on coin epigraphy alone will fail to determine correctly the date of a coin.\n\nThe style of Shang bronze inscriptions is characterized by a peculiar execution of the strokes. Each end of the stroke is usually very thin while the central part is broad and thick. This style of script has been called the K'o-tou, or tadpole, script. However, the tadpole script is found also to be the dominant style in inscriptions of the early years of the Chou period. Without considering its content along with other factors, even an expert epigrapher cannot determine to which period an inscription in the script belongs.\n\nThe period of the Chou dynasty is, for convenience sake, usually divided into three smaller periods: The Western (Early) Chou period covering almost three hundred years from 1122 B. C. (traditional date) or 1027 B. C. to 771 B. C.; the Ch'un-ch'iu period from 770 to 481 B. C.; the Chan-kuo period ending in 221 B. C. During the first period bronzes were almost entirely made by or for kings and ministers of the royal court; during the second and third periods they were made practically only by rulers and nobles of the various feudal states. The style of the inscriptions of these three periods were roughly the so-called Ta-chuan (great \"seal\" character), the Chou-wün (slightly simplified Ta-chuan), and the Hsiao-chuan (small \"seal\" character). Whether the Ta-chuan can be regarded as also the style used in the various feudal states during the first period and whether the other styles found in the various feudal states can be regarded as also the style in the royal domain of Chou during the second and the third periods cannot be said with absolute certainty, especially when we realize that, though so simply stated above, the styles of script during the second and the third periods of Chou present strong local divergence. All these factors complicate any attempt to use comparative study of coin inscriptions and bronze vessel inscriptions in determining dates of coins.\n\nEven if we disregard these complications, dating of coins by comparative study of inscriptions on bronzes is made impossible by another circumstance. Coins and bronzes have different epigraphical styles which result from the difference in their purpose and in the techniques of inscribing them. On bronzes, inscriptions were cast on the vessels, which were made in honor of the maker's forefathers or other relatives, to commemorate a victory in war or a royal or princely grant, to glorify his enfeudation as a prince or his appointment to an office, to record an important event or a settlement of a dispute. The personages involved are always kings, princes and upper class nobles. Some of the vessels bearing the inscriptions commemorating enfeudations were kept in the ancestral temples by princes and venerated as symbols of the existence of their states. They thus had a monumental character and their inscriptions were accordingly rendered in a conventional and elegant manner.\n\nThe coins were not personal treasures of kings, princes or nobles; they were made to be used as media of exchange in a society, the overwhelming majority of which was illiterate. Inscriptions on the coins are merely marks indicating the mint's name, sometimes the serial number of minting, and occasionally also the denomination. To coins of full intrinsic quality, whose value depends largely on their alloy and weight, these marks are not essential; accuracy and elegance in style of character are matters of secondary importance. That is probably the reason why the inscriptions on the coins are generally crudely rendered, while those on bronze vessels are usually models of calligraphy. A comparative stylistic study between crude script and highly developed calligraphy is hardly possible.\n\nFurthermore, whereas the inscriptions on the bronzes were, as generally acknowledged, written by persons with training in calligraphy, those on the coins were left to artisans at the mint, who did not always follow the conventional style and contracted the structure of the characters to the extreme. Technically, inscriptions on bronze vessels were cast from a mould which was made from a model, on which both the designs and the inscription were carved out to the desired fineness. The inscription on the coin was, on the other hand, cast from a mould which was not made after a model and on which the inscription was carved directly and in reverse. As a result, the strokes of the characters on coins were generally in contracted straight lines, for these were much easier to make than curved lines. The straightening of lines and consequently the contraction of the structure of the characters further reduces the possibility of a satisfactory comparative stylistic study of the coin inscriptions with those on bronze vessels.\n\nCan we detect an evolution of style within coin inscriptions themselves with which we may find out the order of appearance of the coins? This question also brings complications. The fact is that the coins were cast by local mints many of which undoubtedly belonged to princes and minor nobles and even wealthy private individuals. Under these circumstances local character and individual inclinations could not but exert their influence. T'ang Lan, a contemporary epigrapher who has specialized in the study of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronzes of the Shang and Chou dynasties, holds the opinion that during the Chou period the style of script in common use was much more simple and irregular than the official script and that it had influenced the official writings towards the end of the period.31 Local variances render the study of the evolution of the style of coin inscriptions difficult if not altogether impossible. The curious thing is that we find some of the most archaic forms of characters on comparatively late coins cast in the border regions of Chou China , where, sociologically speaking, as in modern colonies, conservatism was usually stronger than the central area.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that epigraphical studies have no bearing at all on the determination of coin chronology. On the whole, we may say they do, but only in a general way. They can be applied only in the cases in which stylistic distinctions can be positively established and this is possible only with either the very old or the very late coins. The older the coins are, the closer is the style of their inscriptions to the Ta-chuan (great seal character), and the later the coins, the closer to the Hsiao-chuan (small seal character). The former is identified with the epigraphical style of the inscriptions of the vessels of the Western Chou period, and the latter is the style officially adopted and made universal in 221 B. C. In structure, the Hsiao-chuan is much simpler.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n27\n\nOkutaira Masahiro has also found this correct decipherment, op. cit.

Lack of Historical Records and Archaeological Reports\n\nAnother difficulty in studying ancient Chinese coins is the lack of literary records. Excepting the simple terms of pei (cowrie), tao (knife coin) and pu (spade coin), other data regarding the ancient Chinese monetary system is not found in historical literature. The widely believed traditional story about the casting of the \"big coins\" by King Ching of Chou in 524 B. C. is embodied with unreliable elements (i. e., the remarks made by Shan-mu-kung). The anecdote that King Chuang of Ch'u (613—519 B. C.) aroused resentment among his people by replacing \"light\" coins with \"big\" coins, which also has been regarded as factual, must be accepted with reserve. The story recorded in the Kuan-tzǔ and the \"present edition\" of the Bamboo Annals that Ch'üng-T'ang, founder of the Shang dynasty, cast metallic money is pure folklore. Even if these stories were reliable, they still contain no essential information on ancient Chinese coinage. The only reliable material in our possession with regard to monetary systems in Chinese antiquity are the coins themselves, but some problems presented by them are hard to resolve because of the lack of historical records.\n\nThe major problem that suffers from lack of historical records concerns the date of the origin of coinage in China . The difficulty in dating the earliest coins would be also considerably less if the conditions were known under which the coins had been discovered.\n\nWhat knowledge we have about discoveries of coins is scanty. In the scientific excavations of the Academia Sinica at early Chou and pre-Chou sites in North China only cowries were found.32 The excavations at Ch'üng-tzǔ-yai in eastern Shantung produced only a broken handle from an early knife coin.33 Ming knives were unearthed among old remains in I county of Hopeh Province by an expedition led by Ma Hüng in 1920.34 These knives, however, were very late in date. Mr. Kuo Pao-chün of the Academia Sinica has reported to the author that a number of pointed-foot hollow-handle spades were discovered in Chou tombs of Chün County, Honan . During the last fifty years Japanese archaeologists have excavated both spade and knife coins of the late Chou period in Jehol, Manchuria and Korea .35 Except for those reported by Kuo Pao-chün and the handle of the knife coin, there are no reports by excavators of the discovery of early coins.\n\nCoins of the earlier periods have been found casually, for the most part by farmers while tilling their fields. From the farmers they passed to collectors, either directly or through coin dealers. Thus, by the time they reach the hands of collectors they are isolated objects, completely dissociated with the site of discovery and the other objects with which they had originally been deposited. This condition would not obtain, had their discovery been made under the trained observation of archaeologists. The situation becomes the more regrettable when we realize that tens of thousands of Chou coins have been casually retrieved and, so to speak, lost again.\n\nAmong the late spade coins there is a group, which, as forerunners of the pan-liang (half liang) round coins of imperial Ch'in, are important for the reconstruction of early Chinese coinage. The group is of the round-footed type with three holes (Late Spade IV). Their monetary unit is the liang, as is specified on the reverse legend, and so far one liang and half liang (i. e., 12 chu) pieces have been found. Fifteen specimens from nine different unidentified mints are known.36 If the places of their discovery and the conditions of their finding were known, it might be possible to locate their mints with some certainty.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n32\n\nSee An-yang fa-chueh pao-kao T'ien-yeh k'ao-ku pao-kao and Chung-kuo k'ao-ku hsüeh-pao\n\n33\n\nCh'üng-tzǔ-yai Nanking, 1934, 89 and Plate LII, no. 9.\n\n34\n\nFu Chün-lun, \"Yen hsia-tu fa-chüeh pao-kao,\" Kuo-hsüeh chi-k'an III (1932), 180.\n\n35\n\nSee the volumes of the Archaeologia Orientalis a series published by the Tōa Kōkogaku Kwai from 1929 on.

Identification of Mint Names\n\nThe fourth major difficulty in the study of the Chou coins lies in the identification of the mint names. This difficulty arises not from the lack of historical information, but from, so to speak, the mass of it. With the exception of a few early spades, the coins of the Chou period, be they knives or spades, usually bear a legend or legends on both their obverse and reverse. Part of, or the entire, legend on the obverse is the name of the mint which cast the coin. By locating these mints a reconstruction of the distribution of the coin types can be achieved and the problem of the right of coinage of the minor feudatories can be investigated. But during the Chou period, towns in different states, and sometimes in the same state, may have the same name.37 For instance, we find \"An-yang \" as a mint name in the legend on one group of the early knife coins. In literary sources we find three towns of this name. There are four towns with the name \"Chung-tu,\" which is found on a group of square-foot late spade pieces (Late Spade II). For \"P'ing-yang,\" which appears as the mint-name of some square-foot late spades, there are five towns. Seven are found for \"Hsin-ch'üng\" (meaning \"new city\"), a mint name on a group of point-footed late spades (Late Spade I). Such examples would make a long and tedious list.\n\nTo identify the mints with towns recorded in historical literature is not easy, and there is no literary information available which will help. In solving the question we must depend mostly on our knowledge of the coins themselves. With some degree of certainty we may presume that coins within a general given area will have similar shapes and designs, that they will have the same denominational system. Therefore, by studying these aspects of the coinage of towns neighboring the possible mint we may be able to identify and locate it. Thus, we reach the conclusion that the mint An-yang of early knife coins must be the one located in present southeastern Shantung for the reason that during the Chou period towns outside of that province did not use the early type of knife coin. The An-yang of the round-footed spades with three holes (Late Spade IV) is most likely the one located in present northern Honan which was captured by Ch'in in 257 B. C., for this type of spade coins is probably of Ch'in origin. We can approach the tentative solution of the locations of Chung-tu and P'ing-yang by the same method.\n\nNot all of the mint names which appear on the coins can be found in the literary sources. As a matter of fact, many cannot be. In such cases, to reduce our difficulties in locating the mints to a possible minimum, we may resort to the locations of the mountains, rivers, and other landmarks after which early settlements in China were often named. For example, \"Chi-yin,\" a mint name on some of the round coins of Chou, is not found in the literature of this period. The meaning of the place name is \"on the yin side of the Chi.\" This means that the town in question was located on the yin side of either a mountain or a river by the name of Chi. In Chinese antiquity there was no mountain of this name, but one of the four most important rivers was so designated. It traversed the western part of present Shantung. The yin side of a river is its southern side, and therefore, the town in question must have been located on the southern side of the Chi River. Since this town was named Chi-yin, there may have been also a town named Chi-yang (meaning \"on the northern side of the Chi River\"). Luckily, a town by this name did exist during the Chou time and is recorded in the contemporary literature.38 It was located northeast of modern Lan-füng in eastern Honan (approx. 115E and 35N). Judging from their names, the towns of Chi-yin and Chi-yang may have been opposite to each other, or at least they must have been located in the same neighborhood. This assumption is confirmed by the location of a city also named Chi-yin in the third century B. C. It was the capital of a Han province of the same name. The city was located about a mile northeast of modern Ting-t'ao in southeastern Shantung, and about thirty miles northeast of old Chi-yang. In all probability, the Chi-yin of Han may have been the Chi-yin of Chou. Thus, by resorting to landmarks we can locate Chi-yin and other mints whose names, though not to be found in ancient literature, have a geographical origin.\n\nIn connection with the identification of mint names mention should be made of the practice among Chinese numismatists of regarding some single character legends on ancient coins as abbreviations for two character mint names. For instance, mu has been considered an abbreviation for Mu-mün, yang for Kao-yang, li for Kung-li, kung for San-kung, etc. It is true that a mint name can be abbreviated for lack of space. The abbreviation of \"Chin-yang\" as \"Chin\" on a Small Knife is an example. It, however, can be proved, while those mentioned above cannot. Unless a claim of abbreviation can be proved, it must not be accepted without reserve.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n36\n\nFor the illustrations of these specimens see Okutaira, op. cit.

THE SHANG AND CHOU PERIODS\n\nA brief survey of the development of commerce in ancient China seems necessary to provide a general background for our discussion of the origin and evolution of Chinese coinage, for there are no works, either in Chinese or other languages, which can be recommended for reference on this topic.\n\nAccording to an old myth, markets were established in prehistoric China by a legendary hero, Shün-nung. It is idle speculation to consider the possibility of commerce at such a remote time, since its significance in the general economy could not have been any greater than that of barter trade among present day primitive peoples. It will be more profitable to study the economic conditions under the Shang dynasty, for which period there is a fair amount of archaeological devience.\n\nSome scholars have asserted that the Shang economy was based either on cattle-breeding or on a combination of cattle-breeding and rudimentary agriculture. Others would have us believe that the Shang people lived in an even more primitive state. However, study of oracle bone inscriptions has proved rather the contrary.1 By conquest and colonization the Shang had built up a large empire. During the last two hundred and fifty years of their history, which ends in 1122 B. C. according to the traditional chronology, their territory extended to the sea in the east, to central Shensi in the west, to southern Hopeh in the north, and to the banks of the Huai River in the south.2 The people of this empire led a life which was predominantly agricultural.3 Recently a Chinese scholar suggested the possibility that ploughs pulled by oxen were used to till the fields and that bronze ploughshares were known.4 These ideas are challenging, even though there is no positive evidence to prove them.\n\nIn his campaign against the \"Kuei-fang\" state, northwest of the Shang kingdom in modern Shansi province, King Wu-ting called to arms 23,000 of his subjects in a period of three months.5 In one of his expeditions against the Ch'iang people in the west, he conscripted 10,000 on a single day together with 3000 more from a vassal state.6 Conscriptions on such a scale could not have been possible unless there had been a fairly large population, and the existence of a large population presupposes a developed economic production, at least in agriculture.\n\nIn handicrafts the Shang people achieved exceptional skill and great delicacy of aesthetic taste, as is widely demonstrated in their beautiful bronzes. Their skill in casting finds no match in later periods of Chinese history.7 The excellence of their workmanship has caused Creel to claim that it can barely be surpassed by today's metal worker with modern science and technology at his command,8 and that it has seldom been attained \"anywhere in human history.\"9 Creel's opinions may be accented with enthusiasm, but they testify to the high quality of the products of Shang craftsmen. Such a degree of technical accomplishment could have been attained only through specialization, which in turn, could result only from division of labor. The presence of these two factors, specialization and division of labor, precludes the possibility that each family unit was economically self-sufficient. It obviously points to the existence of an economy based, at least partly, on exchange.\n\nThe economy of the state as a whole showed a similar dependence on products of other regions. The basic metals, copper and tin, which were used in the manufacture of weapons, sacrificial vessels, and many other utensils, were not to be found within the boundaries of the kingdom. They had to be obtained from the south, in and beyond the Yangtze Valley.10 The same was true of gold, silver and cowrie shells,11 which last were used both for ornaments and as media of exchange. Their red pigment, known as cinnabar, came from Shu (modern western Szechuan) and their jade was imported from western regions far beyond the Shang borders.12 Most of the tortoise shells, which were highly prized and served for divination, were of non-local origin; some of the larger specimens may have come from as far away as Malaya.13\n\nIt is very likely that the Shang kings obtained a good part of these imported products as tribute from southern states subject to them, or as booty. As the amount obtainable from such sources could not have satisfied the demands of both the court and the people, a certain proportion of the products must have been acquired through exchange.\n\nThe mutual dependence of the various regions within the kingdom was even more evident.14 Take salt for example. There were probably only two sources for this commodity. One was lake salt from present southwestern Shansi and the other sea salt from the east coast. At the present time there are no other areas within the limits of the Shang dominion which produce salt in any quantity, and it is probable that there was none in ancient times. In addition to salt there were no doubt other necessities of daily life which were specialties of particular regions also.\n\nDue to lack of archaeological or literary evidence we are ignorant of the extent of exchange in this early period. We can, though, conclude with confidence that commerce had reached an active stage. Since Han times the word shang has been used to designate \"trade.\" The explanation of Han scholars that shang (i. e., tradesmen) refers to traders who travel long distances is a rationalized interpretation of the word rather than an exposition of its original meaning. Recent research has shown that the character \"shang\" was used in ancient China only to denote the dynasty, the people, or their capital. Hence, Hsü Chung-shu identifies the term shang-jün in the sense of \"tradesmen\" with shang-jün meaning \"people of Shang.\"15 In his opinion, after their conquest by the Chou, the Shang people found themselves relegated to an inferior position, which circumstance forced many of them to take up trading, an occupation deemed degrading by the upper classes. Hsü draws a parallel between the Shang people and the Jews, both being peoples forced by circumstance into trade as their special profession. While he may be correct in this conjecture, it is equally possible and even more plausible that the identification by the Chou of Shang natives with tradesmen took place a few centuries earlier when the Shang, at the peak of their prosperity, came to the more backward Chou to exchange their own products for those of the tribes of the west. Assuming this as true, it would be only natural for the Chou to identify trading as an outstanding characteristic of the Shang.16 If this interpretation is plausible, we may venture that a group of professional merchants existed in the Shang state whose business extended well beyond their own borders.\n\nThat the Shang people had engaged in widespread trade can be inferred from a statement in \"Chiu kao,\" a decree issued by King Wu,17 the founder of the Chou dynasty, ordering the vanquished Shang of the \"Mei State\" to cease their overindulgence in wine and to devote themselves to farming and trade. The decree says, \"You should, working hard, take your carriages and oxen and pursue trade over long distances so that you can filially nurture your fathers and mothers.\"18\n\nA statement of Confucius indicates that the Chou people, who possessed a cruder culture, absorbed the Shang civilization after its conquest.19 This is corroborated by both archaeological and literary evidence. In the economic sphere, likewise, they must have inherited the pattern of the people they conquered. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few inscriptions on early Chou bronzes, we have practically no information on the economic life of the first two hundred years after the change of dynasties.\n\nFor the later Chou period, reference to trade is made in the Ode of Chan-yang which has been preserved in the Shih ching or Book of Odes. 20 This ode expresses grievances of the people against misconduct of government, interference in politics by women, and pursuit of trade by the nobility. A part of it runs:\n\nSuch things as trade yielding three times (its capital), A superior man should have knowledge of. A woman has nothing to do with public affairs, Yet she leaves her silkworms and weaving.21\n\nThis is a description of behavior contrary to the accepted norm. It was considered degrading for a nobleman to engage in trade, but obviously the temptation of three hundred per cent profit was hard to resist.\n\nThe woman referred to in the ode is said to have been Pao Ssǔ, first a court lady of King Yu (781—771 B. C.) who was made his queen when he ascended the throne. Through her influence, he is reported to have misruled his people and to have invited the Jung invasion which almost ended the Chou. If this identification is correct, the ode must have originated in the eighth century B. C.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n*\n\nA few of the works quoted in this and other sections have been translated into English and French. The Shang-shu has been translated by Legge and Karlgren under the titles of Shoo King (Chinese Classics III) and \"Glosses of the Book of Documents\" (BMFEA No. 20) respectively. The Shih ching (Mao Shih) has been translated by Legge, Waley and Karlgren under the titles of She King (Chinese Classics IV), Book of Songs (incomplete), and \"Book of Odes\" (BMFEA, Nos. 16 and 17). The Lun-yü, the Müng-tzǔ, the Tso chuan, and the Li chi have been translated by Legge under the titles Confucian Annalects, Works of Mencius, The Ch'un ts'eu with the Tso chuen (Chinese Classics I, II, V), and Li Kü (Sacred Book of China , IV and V). The first forty-seven chapters of the Shih-chi have been translated by Chavannes under the title of Les Mümoires historiques des Se-ma Ts'ien. Portions of Chapter XXX and CXXIX of this work and parts of Han shu XXIV have been translated by R. C. Blue in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies II. Part of the Hsün-tzǔ has been translated by Dubs under the title of Works of Hsüntze, and part of the Mo-tzǔ has been translated by Yi-pao Mei under the title of The Ethical and Political Works of Motze. The Yen t'ieh lun has been translated by Gale under the title of The Discourses on Salt and Iron.\n\n1\n\nThis point is also well illustrated by the change of opinion in the works of Kuo Mo-jo one of the leading authorities on the institutional history of the Shang dynasty. In his Chung-kuo ku-tai shü-hui yen-chiu, published in 1930, the author categorically declares, \"There is no doubt that the Yin (Shang) dynasty was a period during which cattle-breeding was most flourishing\" (p. 245), and \"Although agriculture had been discovered, it was not fully developed\" (p. 254). But in his Shih p'i-p'an shu, published in 1945, he rejects his former opinion and declares that during the Shang dynasty \"agriculture had actually become predominant\" (p. 13).\n\n2\n\nThe boundaries of the Shang kingdom can be traced from the locations of its vassal states and of the countries it attacked and conquered. The names of these states and countries are found in inscriptions on oracle bones discovered at Yin-hsü, the site of the last Shang capital. See Tung Tso-pin Yin li p'u (calendar of Yin), 1945, Part II, IX, 37b —40b and 61a —63a; Hu Hou-hsüan \"Pu-tz'ǔ chung so-chien chih Yin-tai nung-yeh\" (Agriculture of the Yin dynasty as seen in the inscriptions on the oracle bones), Chia-ku-hsüeh Shang-shih lun-ts'ung, Second Series, 1945, 31a —47a; and Ch'ün Müng-chia \"Shang-tai ti-li hsiao-chi\" (A note on the geography of the Shang dynasty), Yü-kung (Chinese historical geography) VII (1937), Nos. 6 —7, 101 —108. In 1935 Prof. Fu Ssǔ-nien published his essay, \"I Hsia tung hsi shuo\" (Ch'ing-chu Ts'ai Yüan-p'ei hsien-shüng liu-shih-wu-sui lun-wün-chi, 1093 —1134), in which he says that at the peak of its power the eastern boundary of the Shang empire extended to the \"east of the sea\" (meaning part of Korea ) in the east, to the \"south of the Ch'i mountains\" in central Shensi in the west, and to the valley of the Huai river in the southeast. In other words, the territory of Shang covered present Hopei, Shantung, Northern Kiangsu, Northern Anhui, Honan , Southern Shensi, and Eastern Shensi. His study is based entirely on literary sources, and, except for his claim on the northeastern boundary of Shang, which has not been otherwise proved, is confirmed by studies made of oracle bone inscriptions.\n\n3\n\nHu Hou-hsüan, ibid.\n\n4\n\nHu Hou-hsüan, op. cit. 80b —81a.\n\n5\n\nTung Tso-pin, op. cit.

The bone inscription quoted by Tung Tso-pin is no. 310 in The Couling-Chalfant Collection by F. H. Chalfant, Shanghai , 1935.\n\n7\n\nSee T'ang Lan \"Chung-kuo ku-tai mei-shu yü t'ung-ch'i\" (Art and the Bronzes of Ancient China ), Chung-kuo i-shu lun-ts'ung (Essays on Chinese Art), ed. by T'üng Ku Ch'ang-sha, 1938, 111 —113; Hsü Chung-shu \"Kuan-yü t'ung-ch'i chih i-shu\" (On the Art of the Bronzes), op. cit. 125 —137; and Hu Hou-hsüan, \"Chung-yang-yen-chiu-yüan Yin-hsü ch'u-t'u chan-p'in tsan-kuan chi\" (A Note on the Exhibit of the Objects Recovered at the Yin Ruins by Academia Sinica), op. cit. 157 —167.\n\n8\n\nCreel, Birth of China , New York City, 1937, 112.\n\n9\n\nCreel, op. cit. 124. In his Studies in Early Chinese Culture (1937) 233 Creel remarks, \"Chinese bronze vessels are equal to the finest objects of the sort ever produced anywhere by man. Shang bronze vessels, as a group, are probably the finest of Chinese bronzes. Among the Shang bronzes excavated by the National Research Institute in 1934 and 1935 are complicated vessels which show a genius of design and a complete mastery of technique such as to take the breath of a hardened connoisseur.\"\n\n10\n\nThe \"Yü-kung\" in the Shang-shu states that Yang Chou (in the Yangtze Valley) produced \"three kinds of metal,\" said to be gold, silver and copper. Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien states that gold, tin and lead were produced in Chiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and copper was produced in the region of Wu (lower stream of the river). Shih-chi, Po-na-pün ed. CXXIX, 1b and 11a. W. Yetts believes that copper was once produced in the interior of ancient China . Local tradition says that long ago copper and tin as well as other metals were mined some forty li northwest of An-yang city (in Honan ) from the T'ung Shan or Copper Hills. Two other place names, T'ung Shan Chün and Nan T'ung-yeh (Southern Copper Foundry), testify to the tradition (An-yang: A Retrospect, The China Society, London, 1942, 25. Prof. L. C. Goodrich kindly furnished this information).\n\n11\n\nFor gold and silver see the above note. The Kuan-tzǔ states that gold came from the valleys of the Ju and the Han rivers. Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., XXIII, 3a. The Han River was a branch of the Yangtze. The cowrie shells which are discovered in large numbers at Yin-hsü are Cypraea moneta and C. annulus. They may have come from the Ryukyus, the Malay Peninsula, the T'zord Banks, or as far as the coast along the Indian Ocean. See pp. 55 — 56 and 66 — 69 for more details.\n\n12\n\nIn the excavation of the remains at Yin-hsü in An-yang there have been found a number of inscribed oracle bones painted with red and black pigments. The red pigment has been identified as raw cinnabar through chemical analysis by Professors Beneditti-Pichler and Gettens (see Dr. R. S. Britton, Fifty Shang Inscriptions, 1940, 7). Throughout ancient China cinnabar was the chief material used for red paint, as witnessed by the statement of Li Ssǔ (d. 208 B. C.) in his memorial to the king of Ch'in in 237 B. C. (Shih-chi, LXXXVII, 4b). At a somewhat later date it became associated with Taoist magic. Cinnabar is produced in both Szechuan and Hunan, but Szechuan, anciently known as Shu, was the producing district in Chinese antiquity.\n\n13\n\nTortoise shells which the Shang people used for divination and which they used in large quantities were not produced within the Shang territory; they came from the Yangtze valley and the farther south (See Hu Hou-hsüan, \"Yin-tai pu-kuei chih lai-yüan\" or \"The Origin of the Divination Tortoise Shells of the Yin Dynasty,\" Chia-ku-hsüeh Shang-shih lun-ts'ung or \"Essays on the History of the Yin (Shang) Dynasty based on the Study of the Oracle Bones,\" first series, 1944, Vol. 4, 1 ff.) Prof. Tung Tso-pin quotes Wu Hsien-wün to the effect that the large tortoise shell of the Wu-ting period discovered at the old remains of the Shang capital resembles the species found today in the Malay Peninsula (\"Tsai-t'an Yin-tai ch'i-hou,\" or \"Again on the Weather during the Yin dynasty,\" reprint from the Studia Serica, p. 16, and Lien-shüng Yang, \"Ten Examples of Early Tortoise-shell Inscriptions,\" Harvard Jour. of Asiatic Studies, XI, 1948, 122.)\n\n14\n\nA general picture of the local products in ancient China can be gathered from the statements in the \"Yü-kung,\" a section in the present text of the Shang shu, and from those in the \"Huo-ch'ih chuan\" (CXXIX) in the Shih-chi. The former was written during the Chan-kuo period and the latter was written about 100 B. C. Sun Yüan-chüng has selected various items from the above mentioned works and compiled a table showing the distribution of raw materials and the products of industry in different regions of ancient China , Yü-kung, I (1934), No. 3, 26 —38. The local products recorded in the Shih-chi are quoted in the text below. Those recorded in the \"Yü-kung\" are roughly salt, lacquer, embroidery, silk, the ch'ih linen from the east; lumber from tall trees, gold, silver, copper, ivory, hides, feathers, big tortoise shells, pearls, and oranges from the south; iron and silver from the southwest; and various jades from the west.\n\n15\n\nHsü Chung-shu, \"Ts'ung ku-shu-chung t'ui-ts'ü chih Yin Chou min-tsu\" (A tentative study of the peoples of the Yin and the Chou based on the ancient literature), Kuo-hsüeh Lun-ts'ung I (1927), 109 —113. The literary datum on which Hsü Chung-shu bases his identification of merchants with the Shang (Yin) people is in Tso chuan, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., XLVII, 8b —10b. In 1937 Ojima Sukema a Japanese scholar, published an article on the origin of the name, shang-jün. Using the same document, he identifies the first Chinese merchants with the conquered Shang people. This article forms part of his recent book entitled Kodai Shina kenkyū, Tokyo , 1944, 138—154.\n\n16\n\nKuo Mo-jo attributes the origin of the twofold meanings of the term shang-jün as \"Shang people\" and \"tradesmen\" to the possibility that the Shang people may have been the first traders (Shih p'i-p'an shu, 16.)\n\n17\n\nSome other scholars regard King Ch'üng, son of King Wu, as the one who issued the \"Chiu kao.\" Which opinion is correct is not material, for King Ch'üng ascended to the throne in the seventh year after his father conquered the Shang nation, a date which is very close to the Shang period. The decree is contained in the Shang-shu, known in the West as the Book of History or the Book of Documents.\n\n18\n\nShang-shu, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., VIII, 6b.\n\n19\n\nConfucius says that the Chou people followed the li (institutions) of the Yin (Shang) dynasty. Lun-yü, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., ii, 6a.\n\n20\n\nThe Shih ching contains many odes originating in the 11th to 6th centuries B. C. Except for a limited number, the odes are songs of the people, and as such they reflect actual living conditions. (Karlgren takes exception to this interpretation. He believes that the odes are too elaborate to be products of farmers. See his \"Glosses on the Kuo Feng Odes,\" BMFEA 14 (1942), 75. Prof. Goodrich kindly furnished this information).\n\n21\n\nShih ching, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., XVIII, 24b. Legge's translation of these lines (Chinese Classics, 1871, iv, Part 2, 561 —2) reads:\n\nAs if in the three times cent, per cent, of traffic, A superior man should have any knowledge of it; So a women who has nothing to do with public affairs, Leaves her silk worms and weaving.\n\nKarlgren's translation (\"Book of Odes\" BMFEA, No. 17, 1945, 86.) reads:\n\nThey are like those who sell at a triple profit; the noble man knows this, and (therefore) the women have no public service, they have to (rest) abide by their silk worm work and their weaving.\n\nLegge's version is closer to the meaning of the Chinese text.\n\n2. THE CH'UN-CH'IU PERIOD (770—481 B. C.)\n\nIn the early years of the eighth century B. C., Duke Huan (806—771 B. C.) of the State of Chüng entered into a sworn agreement with the merchants in his territory. Such an event presupposes that a flourishing trade had become important enough to elevate greatly the social position of the merchant class. An account of this agreement was made by Chüng Tzǔ-ch'an, a member of the Chüng ruling family and the most famous statesman of Chüng, to a high minister from the state of Chin in 526 B. C.22 According to Tzǔ-ch'an, when Duke Huan moved from the west to the east and established his state in what is now central Honan ,23 he concluded an agreement with the merchants who had helped him develop this new territory. Under the agreement the merchants promised not to rebel against the state, and Duke Huan pledged himself not to compel the merchants to sell, nor to seize their merchandise by force, nor to inquire into their capital or profits. This account indicates that, as early as the end of the ninth and beginning of the eighth century B. C., the importance of merchants in Chüng had won the recognition of the state and had secured for them an official protection not previously enjoyed.\n\nThe growing importance of commerce was even more manifest in the state of Ch'i, where the government itself engaged in trade. When Duke Huan (not to be confused with the ruler of Chüng with the same title) assumed its rule in 685 B. C., Ch'i was a very small state on the lower stream of the Chi River, which formed its western boundary. Its eastern boundary was less than ten miles from its capital, Lin-tzǔ (also a modern city).24 However, the state was situated on the coast, where fish abounded and where salt could be easily produced from the sea. Kuan Chung (d. 645 B. C.), the Duke's chief minister, realized the potentialities of these natural economic resources. He formulated and put into practice his policy of \"creating profits through [the production and sale of] fish and salt.\"25 In co-ordination with this policy he devised a means of market control through regulation of supply and demand.26 By putting these measures into effect Duke Huan in a short time raised the \"tiny Ch'i\" to a position of hegemony within the Chou empire. As a reward to Kuan Chung, Duke Huan granted to him the revenue from taxes on trade.27 His benefit from this revenue made Kuan Chung, the minister of a feudal lord, \"wealthier than the ruler of a state.\"28\n\nThe salt and fishing industries from which Ch'i of the seventh century B. C. derived so much power had, of course, developed long before this date. Likewise, there must have been an earlier export trade in fish and salt already developed which Duke Huan and Kuan Chung promoted and expanded with such great success. Evidence for this is found in the early history of Ch'i as related by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien in his Shih-chi 29 The historian states that when T'ai-kung Wang, the first ancestor of the house of Ch'i, was enfeoffed and granted Ying-ch'iu, a town in Ch'i, he found that its soil was alkaline and its population small. Therefore, he \"promoted its silk textile industry, perfected its skillful handicrafts, an dopened up [production and trade in] fish and salt.\"30 As a result, \"both people and goods came to it [the town of Ch'i]. They arrived carrying babies on their backs and converged on it like the spokes of a wheel. Consequently, Ch'i provided the world with hats, sashes, clothes and slippers.\"31 Although the enfeudation of T'ai-kung Wang with Ch'i has been proven untrue, the remainder of the account may contain elements of truth.32 If so, Ch'i must have been an industrial center in ancient China for a long period with exports not only of sea products but also of handicrafts, particularly silks, which are mentioned by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien elsewhere.33 Its immediate markets were the territories of Liang (Wei), Chao,34 Sung and Wei, according to Kuan-tzǔ.35 Corroboration of the great demand for the sea produce of Ch'i and of its eastern neighbor, Lai, is found in the gratitude of consumer states to Duke Huan when he abolished custom tolls and promoted direct purchases from Lai.36\n\nAnother fact which attests to early development of trade in Ch'i is the mention of \"big merchants and hoarders\"37 in conjunction with Kuan Chung's program for maintaining equilibrium of the market. Kuan Chung proposed to regulate trade and prevent market manipulation by storing ample stocks of grain in times of plenty for release in times of scarcity.38 His plan was called \"well conceived and well adapted to problems of scarcity and oversupply.\"39 The regulation of the market reveals two significant points: trade played an essential part in Ch'i's economy and \"big merchants and hoarders\" had appeared who manipulated the market and \"forcefully exploited the people.\"40 Even if we grant a measure of discount to the account of Kuan-tzǔ 41, the fact remains that trade had developed to an advanced stage in the Ch'i economy.42\n\nWe have evidence that by the middle of the seventh century B. C., and possibly earlier, economic needs had transcended state boundaries and that political divisions proved a hindrance to normal exchange. In 651 B. C. a conference of feudal lords convened at K'uei-ch'iu where Duke Huan of Ch'i demanded that the participants henceforth \"shall not hoard grain\" and \"shall not curtail (the export of) raw materials.\"43 Because of its alkaline soil Ch'i was unable to support its entire population and the large army it required to maintain its hegemony. It is also probable that its handicraft industries needed raw materials from other areas. These were the reasons, no doubt, for the demands of the Duke. Another treaty drawn up in 562 B. C. practically repeats the provisions of the earlier one. In it the agreeing parties promise \"not to hoard grain in bad years\" and \"not to block (the flow) of products.\"44\n\nAn early development of industry and commerce can be traced also in the state of Wei. In 658 B. C., the year after the state was invaded by the Ti people, Duke Wün moved his capital eastwards to Ch'u-ch'iu on the northern border of the present Honan province. There he pursued a program of reconstruction by \"promoting commerce and favoring industry.\" As a result, the population of Wei increased threefold in a period of twenty-three years.45 More than a century later, when Confucius visited the state he was greatly impressed with its flourishing condition.46\n\nGeographically speaking, Wei was situated at that time in the center of ancient China , in the plain at the middle of the old Yellow River valley, and on the Wu-tao (cross-roads).47 During the Ch'un-ch'iu period, Wei, capital of the state, was one of the three cities renowned for their riches, the other two being Lin-tzǔ, capital of Ch'i, and T'ao. It has on several occasions been mentioned together with T'ao as a place abounding in wealth.48\n\nAcross the northern and western borders of Wei we enter the territory of the state of Chin. Although it lagged behind Ch'i and Wei, there are signs of an early development of commerce there. Duke Wün (636—628 B. C.) of Chin, the first of its rulers to bring the state to a position of power, realized the benefits of trade and promoted it for the benefit of both the state and its people. On assumption of rule in 636 B. C., he \"reduced duties at the passes, flattened the roads, opened up commerce, and lessened the burdens of the peasants ... in order to better the life of the people.\"49 As a result, in the middle of the sixth century B. C. we find that \"the rich merchants of Chiang (capital of Chin) ... could decorate their carriages with gold and jade and have their clothing embroidered with flowery patterns.\"50 \"They could,\" furthermore, \"(befriend and) distribute gifts to the feudal lords.\"51 These words of Shu-hsiang, the grand tutor, to Han Hsüantzǔ, chief minister of state, give a good picture of the amount of wealth that merchants had accumulated in this state. From the degree of their prosperity we can easily infer the state of development of trade. As an ancient folk saying put it, \"The longer the sleeves, the better the dancer dances; the wealthier the merchant, the more successfuly he trades.\"52\n\nAs a result of increased development in the seventh century B. C., trade was recognized to be as essential as agriculture and industry. A simultaneous and balanced development of the three became a criterion by which the strength of a state was judged. In 597 B. C., when Chin was preparing an attack on Ch'u, Sui-wu-tzǔ dissuaded Duke Li of Chin from acting, for as he observed, in Ch'u \"neither the merchants, the farmers, nor the artisans have shown any relaxation in production.\"53 In 564, when Ch'u consented to join forces with Ch'in against Chin, Tzǔ-nang, a Ch'u minister, opposed the move, giving practically the identical reason.54 When, in 516 B. C., Duke Ching of Ch'i was concerned about the strength of his state, his minister Yen-tzǔ (named Ying), suggested that li be put into practice. Along with a few other administrative measures his li (proper principles for government) provided that \"farmers do not shift their occupations, artisans and merchants do not change their professions. \"55\n\nWhy did the ancient Chinese rulers consider the balance between trade, agriculture, and industry important? The Chou shu (Book of Chou) says, \"If the farmers do not produce, there will be a shortage of food. If foresters do not produce, some works will not be accomplished. If the merchants do not produce, the sources of wealth will be cut.\"56 Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien remarks, \"From the farmers food is obtained, by the foresters the materials are produced by which the artisans' goods are manufactured, by the merchants they are circulated.\"57 \"These four,\" he continues, \"are the sources for clothes and food for the people. If the sources are great, abundance will result; if the sources are small, scarcity will result. They enrich the state above, and enrich the people below.\"58\n\nOne way in which the state reaped direct benefit from commerce was through collection of taxes on market transactions and of customs duties at passes (kuan). To supervise markets and probably to collect taxes therein special officials were appointed. They were called ku-Chüng (director of trade) in Lu,59 ch'u-shih (market supervisor) in Chüng,60 shih-ling (market prefect) and shih-yüan (assistant to market prefect) in Ch'i,61 Ssǔ-shih (director of the market) and ku-shih (trade supervisor) in the Chou li.62\n\nFrontier passes (kuan) as strategic points through which invaders might enter were originally the sites of military outposts. It was only after the volume of interstate trade had become substantial that they became also collection points of customs duties. The Kuan-tzǔ defines a pass as \"a feudal lord's strategic road and the door for outside wealth.\"63 As soon as feudal rulers realized the large amount of revenue they were reaping from duty collections at frontier passes, greed inevitably led them to set up kuan for collection of duties within their interiors. Some states like Ch'i extended duty collections to points close to the walls of their capitals. In 522 B. C. Yen-tzǔ stated that \"the passes [customs stations] close to the capital [of Ch'i] tyrannically collect duties for personal profit,\"64 that is, of the prince of Ch'i. One hundred and three years before (in 625 B. C.) the state of Lu had set up six additional such customs offices. Confucius referred to their establishment as one of the three inhuman acts performed by the Lu minister, Tsang Wün-chung,65 The phraseology of Confucius gives the impression that these customs stations were in the interior. The whole practice of customs collections was bitterly denounced by Mencius: \"In ancient times the erection of customs stations was directed against tyranny [meaning agression]; at the present [fourth century B. C.] the erection of customs stations is for exercising tyranny.\"66\n\nThe above data concerning the establishment of stations for collection of duties throw considerable light on the development of commerce. The lack of concrete figures or even general statements regarding the amount of revenue collected at a customs station makes it impossible to estimate the volume of trade. A portion of the Tso chuan, however, does enable us to gauge its value. The author of the Tso chuan relates that the Ti people invaded Sung during the reign of Duke Wu (766—749 B. C.). In the battle with the invaders all the Sung generals perished except Erh-pan, whose chariot led the defense's charge. To reward him, 'The Duke granted a customs station to Erh-pan as his fief and let him live on its collections.\"67 That the collection of duties was granted as a reward or fief to a victorious warrior indicates that this source of revenue had become sizeable and fairly regular. Even more significant is the fact that Erh-pan's grant took place in the middle of the eighth century, almost a hundred years before the commercial policies of Duke Huan of Ch'i and Duke Wün of Wei were adopted.\n\nThe development of trade and the large profits accruing to those engaged in it would naturally bring merchants out of relative obscurity into activity in public affairs. The names of a few merchants before the fifth century B. C. are mentioned in extant historical literature in connection with important events. Primary among these are the names of Pao Shu-ya and Kuan Chung, whom we have already mentioned as the advisor of Duke Huan of Ch'i.\n\nBefore his rise to prominence, or in his own words \"when I was in a difficult situation,\" Kuan Chung had been a merchant, originally from Ying-shang68 (in what is now Central Honan ), trading in Nan-yang,69 a large city in the southwestern part of the province. For sometime he had been a business associate of Pao Shu-ya,70 who likewise rose to high position in the ruling circle of Ch'i. It was, in fact, Pao Shu-ya who recommended Kuan Chung to Duke Huan. Both Pao Shu-ya and Kuan Chung became high officials in the state. The latter was honored by Duke Huan with the title chung-fu 71 and Confucius paid tribute to him for having saved the Chinese from conquest by barbarians.72\n\nNext we find the name of Hsüan Kao, a merchant of Chüng.73 In 627 B. C., when driving his herds of cattle to the city of Chou to market them, Hsüan Kao met the armies of Ch'in marching eastward to make a surprise attack on his home state. Sensing the danger, he pretended he was an official emissary sent by Chüng to welcome and feast the invading troops. While entertaining them he secretly dispatched warning and thereby saved his state.74\n\nFrom Chüng there was another merchant, whose identity is unknown. In 568 B. C., an important general of Chin, Hsün Ying, was captured by the enemy in the course of a battle with the army of Ch'u. Partisans of the general asked a merchant, who had come to Ch'u on business, for help in an escape plot. The merchant agreed and worked out a plan for smuggling the general out among his merchandise. Although Hsün Ying was released before the plot was carried out, he was nonetheless so grateful that when the merchant came to Chin to trade he offered him special favors. Declining the general's generosity, the merchant went on to Ch'i in pursuance of his business.75 Obviously this merchant must have been prominent and one with social connections among important personages in both Ch'u and Chin. To warrant such extensive travelling in Chüng, Ch'u, Chin and Ch'i, practically all over the then known Chinese world, his business must have been on a large scale.\n\nOf all the big merchants of this period the most famous was Tuan-mu Ssǔ, a disciple of Confucius, better known as Tzǔ-kung. Tzǔ-kung, a native of Wei which had long prospered through trade, is said to have been a master of market manipulation. \"He hoarded merchandise or released it according to the prospects of making profit,\"76 and thereby acquired a great fortune. Although Confucius reproached him for his interest in trade and for his lack of it in studies, he praised his ability in commercial speculation.77 Tzǔ-kung's wealth enabled him to travel from one princely court to another accompanied by a long retinue of horses and carriages laden with fine silks of which he made gifts to the feudal princes. Wherever he went, rulers accorded him the courteous treatment of an equal.78 In the opinion of Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, the great historian, it was Tzǔ-kung who \"made the name of Confucius popular over the world.\"79 Even though he may not have done so consciously, Tzǔ-kung, as both the favorite disciple of Confucius and a prominent merchant, must have publicized his teacher widely. Moreover, he was not only a business man renowned for his wealth, but was an influential politician as well. While a trader he served Lu and Wei in various official capacities.80 His last years were spent in Ch'i, the state most famous for its industry and commerce.\n\nAnother personage reported to have come to Ch'i was the famous statesman Fan Li, who had aided the king of Yüeh (modern Chekiang) to conquer Wu (southern Kiangsu), to extend the state's territory to the borders of Lu and Ch'i, and thus to attain a political position on a par with the central states. This was in the first half of the fifth century B. C. According to the account, after Yüeh had attained its greatest power, Fan Li resigned, changed his name, went to Ch'i, and later established himself as a business man in T'ao, which city was regarded as the geographical center of the empire. Henceforth, Fan Li became known as T'ao Chu-kung (Old Gentleman Chu of T'ao). The fortune he made from trade profits and interest on money-lending became so great that he became a symbol of wealth81 and served as a model to Chinese businessmen from that day to the present. Though the identification of Chu-Kung with Fan Li seems open to doubt82 the historical character of the Old Gentleman Chu remains.\n\nLike the Old Gentleman Chu of T'ao, Po Kuei also achieved great success in trade and gained even greater fame. He was a native of Chou, an area which was highly commercialized. Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien says that he lived in the time of Marquis Wün (446—397 B. C.) of Wei, but some modern scholars believe he lived a century later.83 According to Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien he \"was very successful in predicting the trend of the time.\" Hoarding merchandise which would bring him large returns, he purchased when others dumped, and vice versa. \"In grasping the advantages of the moment, he acted as ferocious animals and vultures do in falling on their prey.\"84 He boasted that he conducted his business in the manner I Yin and Lü Shang (statesmen of an earlier time) laid out their administrative policies, Sun Pin and Wu Ch'i (famous military strategists) commanded their armies, and Shang Yang (a reformist statesman) executed his orders.85\n\nThe above accounts of early Chinese merchants are not to be read as biographical notes only, for in them we find data upon which a clearer picture of early commerce in China can be reconstructed. Fragmentary as the information is, it all points to a considerable development of trade in this period. Let us summarize our findings. As far back as the early part of the eighth century B. C. the contribution of commerce to general economic life had won the attention of the ruling authorities. Around the middle of that century custom duties collections, at least in Sung, had reached considerable proportions. In the following century Ch'i and Wei successively pursued programs of commercial expansion. The lucrative profits of trade attracted many to take it up as an occupation even though it had been considered an ignoble one. Merchants travelled throughout the the world then known to the Chinese and amassed such fortunes that nobles accepted them as equals and appointed them to high administrative positions in their governments.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n22\n\nTso chuan, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., XLVII, 8b —10.\n\n23\n\nOriginally the territory of the state of Chüng was in the area below the Wei River in eastern Shensi.\n\n24\n\nKuo-yü (Stories of the States), Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., VII, 9a.\n\n25\n\nShih-chi, XXXII, 8b, and XXX, 20b.\n\n26\n\nIbid, and op. cit., CXXIX, 2b.\n\n27\n\nThe term for the market tax is san-kuei When Confucius was asked whether Kuan Chung was frugal, he said he was not because Kuan Chung \"had the san-kuei.\" (Lun-yü, III, 5b). In the Han-fei-tzǔ it is said after Kuan Chung became the chief minister of Duke Huan of Ch'i, the latter bestowed upon him the san-kuei in order to enrich him. (1875, XII, 11a). As the term was obscure to later scholars, it has been interpreted as meaning \"the name of a terrace\" or \"wives from three different families.\" Kuo Sung-t'ao (1818 —1891) rejects these explanations and suggests that it was a general term applied to market taxation, meaning thirty per cent of the profit. See his Yang-chih shu-wu wün-chi (A collection of writings of the Yang-chih Study), I, \"Shih san-kuei\" (Interpretation of San-kuei).\n\nKuo Sung-t'ao's interpretation appears most satisfactory. The san-kuei grant to Kuan Chung as recorded by Liu Hsiang (77 —6 B. C.) is \"one year's tax from the market of the Ch'i state.\" (Shuo-yüan, Ssǔ-pu pei-yao ed., VIII, 12a). The market from which Kuan Chung was to receive his revenue was probably that in the Ch'i capital.\n\n28\n\nShih-chi, CXXIX, 2b. In LXII, 3a, Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien gives a slightly different statement of Kuan Chung's wealth. There he says, \"Kuan Chung was so wealthy that he equalled the house of the ruler of state (of Ch'i).\"\n\n29\n\nThe story quoted below in the text concerns the enfeudation of Lü Wang or T'ai-kung Wang (the first ancestor Wang) with Ying-ch'iu a town in the ancient Ch'i state, as his fief. It tells how Lü Wang established his state in Ch'i and developed its economic resources. The story does not correspond with the historical facts. As has been ably disproved by Prof. Fu Ssǔ-nien, at the time when Lü Wang was supposed to have been made the feudal lord of Ch'i, the territory which later came to be known as Ch'i was still in the hands of the Shang people or their vassals. The very name of the beneficiary, Lü Wang or Wang of Lü, indicates strongly that the fief of Wang was Lü, not Ch'i. Even a generation later, his son Chi was still called Lü Chi or Chi of Lü. Prof. Fu's arguments are contained in his article \"On Ta-Tung and Hsiao-Tung,\" Bulletin of the National Research Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, II (1930), 101 —109. What immediately concerns us here is not the authenticity of the enfeudation of Lü Wang in Ch'i but the possibility of the early development of industry and commerce in the region of Ch'i, which is the main point of the story.\n\n30\n\nShih-chi, CXXIX, 2b.\n\n31\n\nIbid. This statement and the one immediately preceding are significantly absent in Shih-chi, XXX, 20b, where the historical development of industry and commerce is related by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien and in LXII where the history of the state of Ch'i is treated by the same historian. In neither place is the first ancestor of the house of Ch'i mentioned to be the first developer of the economy of Ch'i. This is another point which can be used to support Prof. Fu in his argument disputing Lü Wang as the first ruler of the feudatory Ch'i. The story about Tai-kung Wang seems to have some historical elements with its features borrowed from the story about Duke Huan and Kuan Chung.\n\n32\n\nSee note 29.\n\n33\n\nSuch as silk fabrics recorded in Shih-chi, CXXIX, 10a. Li Ssǔ speaks of the fine kao of O as one of the luxurious industrial goods imported into Ch'in in his memorial to the king of Ch'in quoted above. O was a town in Ch'i, located northwest of the modern city of Tung-o in western Shantung.\n\n34\n\nNeither Liang (Wei) nor Chao, the state mentioned immediately after Liang, existed during the Ch'un-ch'iu period which we are discussing. These states came into being only after 431 B. C. through a split of the territory of Chin. The creation of these states received official sanction in 403 B. C. when the king of Chou granted the rulers of the two de facto states the status of the hou or marquis. We use the names of the two states instead of Chin to preserve the original wording of the passage in Kuan-tzǔ, which is here referred to.\n\nIn the Chou period, there were two states whose name was pronounced Wei. One, written existed throughout the whole Chou period, and the other, written was officially created in 403 B. C. Although the names of these two states cannot be confused in Chinese script, they can be easily in English. In order to avoid the confusion, we will refer to the state created in 403 B. C. as Liang, which was the name of its capital. In the literature of the Chan-kuo period this state is frequently so designated.\n\n35\n\nKuan-tzǔ, XXIII, 15b.\n\n36\n\nKuo-yü, VI, 10b.\n\n37\n\nOp. cit., XXII, 6b.

Moreover, the wording of Pan Ku's (32 —92) quotation (XXIV, Part 2, 1a —1b) of the portion relating to market regulation is identical with the present text.\n\n42\n\nHuan K'uan of the later Han dynasty (25—220) speaks of the Ch'i commercial caravan consisting of three thousand carriages.

THE CHAN-KUO PERIOD\n\nThe Chan-kuo Period (403—221 B. C.) witnessed a further development of commerce. The civil wars regarded as characteristic of the period (Chan-kuo means \"warring states\") in actuality surpassed very little those of earlier times in either frequency or destructiveness. They certainly do not appear to have hindered the growth of trade.\n\nIt is significant that the agrarianist Hsü Hsing, a contemporary of Mencius (390—305 B. C.), advanced a political philosophy which aimed to eradicate the evils of the day by making a farmer of everyone. It is said that he and his disciples cultivated fields themselves and lived extremely simple lives so as to set an example for their teachings. Mencius disapproved of both their theory and their practice of it. Encountering a follower of Hsü Hsing he questioned him and learned that the philosopher had been unable to maintain himself without acquiring clothes, hats, utensils and iron implements from other people. As Mencius puts it Hsü Hsing was engaged in a \"busy and confused\" [i. e., 'complicated'] exchange with the hundred [i. e., 'many'] artisans for the goods [he needs].\"86\n\nSome of the things which Hsü Hsing needed could be purchased in the locality (both he and Mencius lived in the state of T'üing at the time), such as simple pottery utensils. Some others, such as iron for making tools, could not be so obtained. Artisans who manufactured iron tools had to secure their metal from other areas.87 Many other things were as necessary to life on an economically higher level as iron was to the ascetic. Timber, bamboo, ku barks for writing material, lu mountain hemp for making cloth, yak tails, jade and other precious stones from west of the mountains;88 fish, salt, lacquer, silk, musical instruments and embroideries89 from east of the mountains; wood of the nan (Machilus nanmu) and the tzǔ (Lindera tzumu), ginger, cinnamon trees, gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros (hide or horn), tortoise shells, pearls, ivory, and other hides from south of the Chiang (Yangtze River); horses, oxen, sheep, furs, sinews and horns from the north; and copper and iron from many other places90 — \"all these,\" as Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien observes, \"were what the people of the central kingdom91 enjoyed and the materials from which, according to the custom of the day, were made clothes, food and articles for nurturing the living and burying the dead.\"92\n\nThese commodities listed above are taken from the introduction of the section on merchants and manufactures in pre-Ch'in China in Shih-chi by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien. What he describes is but a general picture,93 and he does not pretend to give a complete enumeration. Besides these, jujubes from Yen (roughly modern Hopeh) and An-i (southern Shansi), chestnuts from Yen and Ch'in (roughly Shensi), fish and salt from Yen and Wu (southern Kiangsu), copper from Wu, copper and iron from Pa and Shu (Szechuan), fruits and cloth from Pan-yü (Canton), oranges from Shu, Han and Chiang-ling (Szechuan and southern Hupeh), etc., formed part of the merchandise which crowded many of the markets.94\n\nFlourishing trade brought about commercialization of a part of the agricultural produce. We find it stated that a cattle breeder who possessed 50 horses, 166 oxen, 250 sheep, and 250 pigs; a fish grower who produced 1000 piculs (shih) in his ponds; an orchardist of 1000 jujube trees in An-i, or of 1000 chestnut trees in Yen or Ch'in, or of 1000 orange trees in Shu, Han or Chiang-ling; a grower of 100 ch'iu trees (Mallotus japonicus) in the Yellow River valley, or of 1000 mou (land measure) of lacquer trees in Ch'ün or Hsia (central and eastern Honan ), or of 1000 mou of mulberry trees or hemp in Ch'i or Lu (Shantung); or of 1000 fertile mou of grain, or of 1000 mou of the chih and the ch'ien plants (from the flowers of which red and yellowish-red pigments were made), or of 1000 plots of ginger or leeks — that any one of them received a revenue equal to that of a marquis with a fief of one thousand households.95 Since a household paid an annual tribute of two hundred cash to its noble lord, this revenue in terms of cash would be 200,000. Calculated at the twenty per cent rate of profit accruing to the farmers, artisans and merchants of the time as recorded by Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien, a profit of 200,000 represented, so to speak, a capital of one million.96 Ssǔ-ma Ch'ien therefore calls the man of such wealth a \"noble without a fief.\"97\n\nAccording to the same historian the following merchandise was sold yearly in a large city: 1000 jars of wine, 1000 long-necked jars of vinegar, 1000 big jars of sauce, 1000 heads of butchered oxen and cows, sheep or pigs, 1000 chung (1 chung = 64 tou or Chinese pecks) of grain, 1000 wagonloads of fuel, boats of a total length of 1000 chang (1 chang = 10 ch'ih or Chinese feet), 1000 pieces of lumber, 10,000 bamboo p"
