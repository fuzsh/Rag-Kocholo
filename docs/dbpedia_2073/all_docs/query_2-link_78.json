The founders of the Zhou dynasty, the kings Wen å¨æç and Wu å¨æ­¦ç (abbreviated to the couple Wen-Wu ææ­¦), and the Prince Regent, the Duke of Zhou å¨å¬, were seen as ideal monarchs.

        "text": "Oct 3, 2018 Â© Ulrich Theobald\n\nMilitary organisation\n\nWestern Zhou period\n\nTransmitted and archaeological sources prove the existence of six \"western\" royal divisions (liushi å ­å¸«, xi liushi è¥¿å ­å¸«; å¸« also written ð ¤), yet there is also word of the \"eight divisions of [the region of] Yin\", i.e. Shang (Yin bashi æ®·å «å¸«) and the eight divisions of Chengzhou (Chengzhou bashi æå¨å «å¸«) in the east. One interpretation of these units is that one of them was garrisoned in the last residence of Yin, which was located on the territory of the regional state of Wei è¡, and the other eight divisions in the eastern capital Chengzhou (today's Luoyang æ´é½, Henan). Another interpretation sees the Yin and Chengzhou divisions as the same units. This means that the kings of Zhou either commanded 14 divisions, or 22 (He 1987: 20; Yang 1994: 77-78; Wang & Yang 1996: 362).\n\nEven if the highest command over these troops was in the hands of the king, the military orders were executed by other leaders, for instance, the Duke of Shao å¬å ¬ in case of the western, and the Duke of Zhou å¨å ¬ in that of the eastern divisions. Estimations about the size of one shi å¸« range between 3,000 (\"regiment\"; He 1987: 21) and 10,000 men (\"division\"; Yang 1994: 78). In contrast to the Shang, this seems to have been an army of considerably size, and was a measure to strengthen the power of the central government over the regional rulers (zhuhou è«¸ä¾¯). This system is explained in the historiographical book Guoyu åèª (ch. Luyu é­¯èª B):\n\nQuotation 1. Divisions of the king and the regional rulers according to Guoyu åèª å¤©å­ä½å¸«ï¼å ¬å¸¥ä¹ä»¥å¾ä¸å¾·ã The Son of Heaven raises regiments, and a Duke commands them in order to punish the immoral ones. å ä¾¯ä½å¸«ï¼å¿å¸¥ä¹ä»¥æ¿å¤©å­ã The greater among the regional rulers raise regiments, and ministers command them in order to support the Son of Heaven. è«¸ä¾¯æå¿ç¡è»ï¼å¸¥æè¡ä»¥è´å ä¾¯ã The [average] regional rulers have ministers, but no armies; [instead] they command highly trained guard units in order to assist the greater regional rulers. èªä¼¯ãå­ãç·æå¤§å¤«ç¡å¿ï¼å¸¥è³¦ä»¥å¾è«¸ä¾¯ã As the lesser regional rulers have grand masters, but no ministers, they command conscripts in order to support the other regional rulers. æ¯ä»¥ä¸è½å¾ä¸ï¼ä¸ç¡å§¦æ ã For this reason, those in the higher ranks can charge those below, and those below may not do evil!\n\nFrom this statement it can be learnt that \"ministers\" (qing å¿) were not just civilian, but also military commanders in the regional states. The ministers-commander of the greater regional rulers (what was later called the \"hegemonial lords\") were directly appointed by the king, as can be learnt from the ritual Classic Liji ç¦®è¨ (ch. Wangzhi çå¶). Concerning the size of regional armies, the sources deviate from each other. The Luyu chapter of the Guoyu says that greater regional rulers had armies of three divisions (jun è»), while the Classic Zhuozhuan å·¦å³ (Yingong é±å ¬ 5) holds that the mightier among the regional rulers (fangbo æ¹ä¼¯) had two divisions (shi å¸«). In practice, it might have been that regional states had the right to deploy between one and three divisions. The problem with such statements from the Eastern Zhou period æ±å¨ (770-221 BCE) is that the unit jun è» was unknown in the early Western Zhou è¥¿å¨ (11th cent.-770 BCE) (Yang 1994: 80). The smallest units were squads of ten (shi ä») commanded by squad commanders (shizhang ä»é·). Companies (baifu ç¾å¤«) were commanded by company commanders (baifuzhang ç¾å¤«é·), and regiments of 1,000 men (qianfu åå¤«) by regimental commanders (qianfuzhang åå¤«é·).\n\nIt seems that the less powerful regional rulers did not have own armies, but just guard units (wei è¡) which were used to support the mightier regional rulers in case of need. The smaller regional states did perhaps not even dispose of guard units, but had to fall back on conscripts (fu è³¦) drafted when a conflict arose. The smaller lords created auxiliary troops to support the mightier lords, and even the mightier among the regional rulers only had the right to assist the Son of Heaven, and not the right to wage war on their own behalf. Smaller contingents for local defence were apparently existing in the regional states, but they stood nominally under the command of the king (He 1987: 21).\n\nThe king was protected by between 800 (Wang & Yang 1996: 362) and 3,000 (Yang 1994: 94) guardsmen (hubenshi èè³æ°, hushi èå£« \"brave as tigers\"), both at home or during inspection tours. The guardsmen of the regional rulers were called lÃ¼ben æ è³.\n\nThe use of armies within the Zhou empire was mainly to \"punish\" disobedient lords or tribes. The army command was entrusted to a regional lord by handing him over bow and arrow (gong shi å¼ç¢) or a ceremonial axe (fu yue æ§é). This can be learnt from the Liji (ch. Wangzhi) and the inscription of the Guo Jizi Bai pan è¢å­£å­ç½ç¤ plate.\n\nCentral command was nominally with the king, but he was supported by the Minister of War (da sima å¤§å¸é¦¬), literally \"grand commander of mounts\". This office is first mentioned in the Classic Shangshu å°æ¸ \"Book of Documents\" (ch. Mushi ç§èª). It might have been derived from the Shang petty office of maya é¦¬äº or maxiaochen é¦¬å°è£ (see Shang military), but represented a much more important position than those. The office is also mentioned in several bronze inscriptions, where the sima is described as practically the \"right hand\" of the king. This impression is confirmed by the respective paragraph in the ritual Classic Zhouli å¨ç¦® (part Xiaguan å¤å®, ch. Da sima å¤§å¸é¦¬), where the manifold duties of the Minister of War are described:\n\nThe Minister of War established the nine methods to consolidate the state (jian bangguo zhi fa å»ºé¦åä¹ä¹æ³) in order to support the king in checking the local rulers. The nine methods were determining the royal domain and fixing the borders of the regional states (zhi ji fen guo å¶ç¿å°å), establishing rules of etiquette and making distinct the ranks of nobility (she yi bian wei è¨­åè¾¨ä½), promoting competent men and elevating such of merits (jin xian xing gong é²è³¢èå), creating pastures and appointing inspectors (jian mu li jian å»ºç§ç«ç£), organizing a military corps and checking military prescriptions (zhi jun jie jin å¶è»è©°ç¦), fixing the obligation to deliver tributes and charging the officials with their duties (shi gong fen zhi æ½è²¢åè·), listing and counting the population in each township (jian ji xiang min ç°¡ç¨½éæ°), equalizing the defence and balancing the statutes (jun shou ping ze åå®å¹³å), and approaching the small ones and serving the great (bi xiao shi da æ¯å°äºå¤§). These duties show how much the Zhou kings were able to penetrate the sovereignty of the regional states. The regional rulers were no more than governors, and not rulers in their own right. The Minister of War was thus responsible for administering the armies and their equipment, recruitment, training and tactics, and dispensed military justice. In some instances, the Minister of War also commanded the armies of regional states (Yang 1994: 83).\n\nApart from the Minister of War, there were also commanders (sima å¸é¦¬) on lesser levels, like mounted commanders (jun sima è»å¸é¦¬), chariot commanders (yu sima è¡å¸é¦¬), mounted commanders on campaign (xing sima è¡å¸é¦¬), military administrators of royal divisions (bangjun sima é¦åå¸é¦¬, guo sima åå¸é¦¬), military administrators of regional states (jia sima å®¶å¸é¦¬, sizheng å¸æ­£), or du sima é½å¸é¦¬ as administrators on a low level (Yang 1994: 86).\n\nDuring battles, the highest command might be carried out by the Grand Commander (taishi å¤ªå¸«, the Duke of Zhou) or the Grand Guardian (taibao å¤ªä¿, the Duke of Shao; see Three Dukes), the highest members of the central government, or second-rank persons like the Minister of Education (situ å¸å¾), the Minister of War (sima), or the Minister of Works (sikong å¸ç©º) (Wang & Yang 1996: 360, see six ministries).\n\nDuring the reign of King Li å¨å²ç (r. 878-841 BCE), the dynasty was threatened by two enemies, namely the Xianyun çç tribes in the west, and the Huaiyi æ·®å¤· tribes in the southeast. King Li therefore carried out reform in the military system by increasing troop strength and altering the composition of units. The unit jun was introduced which corresponded to 12,500 troops. The king had at his disposal six of these new, larger units. The unit shi was made a subunit of jun and reduced to 1,500 troops.\n\nTable 1. Military units of the late Western Zhou unit size commander rank division (jun è») 12,500 da sima å¤§å¸é¦¬ ? minister-commander (qing å¿) regiment (shi å¸«) 1,500 shishuai å¸«å¸¥ ordinary grand master (zhong dafu ä¸­å¤§å¤«) battalion (lÃ¼ æ ) 500 lÃ¼shuai æ å¸¥ junior grand master (xia dafu ä¸å¤§å¤«) company (zu å) 100 zuzhang åé· senior serviceman (shangshi ä¸å£«) platoon (liang å ©) 25 liang sima å ©å¸é¦¬ ordinary serviceman (zhongshi ä¸­å£«) squad (wu ä¼) 5 wuzhang ä¼é· junior serviceman (xiashi ä¸å£«)\n\nThe whole military system thus followed a pentadic system (steps and multiples of five) instead of the former decimal system. Regiments and battalions were arranged in left, mid, and right wings.\n\nWestern Zhou armies consisted of two branches of service, namely chariot units, and infantry. The number of chariots used in conflicts is unknown. The battle of Muye ç§é before the foundation of the Zhou dynasty was allegedly fought with 300 chariots, while after King Li's reform, armies were encompassing 3,000 chariots (Yang 1994: 89).\n\nShang commanders had to operate with chariots and infantry separately, but the Zhou began to merge these two types of forces to a unit called sheng ä¹ which included one chariot and 30 infantrymen. Ten of them were armoured (jiashi ç²å£«), namely three ready to use the chariot, and seven walking. Of the whole group, 5 men did not fight, but cared for the train and prepared food and fodder. The group was commanded by the chief charioteer (He 1987: 21). Five chariots made a squad (dui é), 10 a platoon (guan å®), 25 a company (zhengpian æ­£å), 50 a battalion (zu å), 100 a regiment (shi), and 500 chariots a division (jun). In the late Western Zhou period, each chariot was accompanied by ten heavy infantrymen (jiashi) protected by cuirasses or corselets as well as twenty light infantrymen (tubing å¾å µ).\n\nSpring and Autumn period\n\nWith the flight of the royal house of Zhou to the east their military and political potential had diminished drastically. The number of troops protecting the eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang, Henan) shrank in comparison with the Western Zhou period. The name \"six armies\" (liujun) was still used, but an incident in 707 BCE, when King Huan of Zhou å¨æ¡ç (r. 720-697) fought against Duke Zhuang é­èå ¬ (r. 743-701) of Zheng é­ shows that the house of Zhou was powerless. Even with the military support of the states of Cai è¡, Wei è¡, and Chen é³, the royal army lost the battle of Xuge ç¹»è (today's Changge é·è, Henan).\n\nWhile the forces of the royal house shrank, those of the regional states increased. The most powerful state of the early Spring and Autumn period was Jin æ. In 661, Duke Xian of Jin æç»å ¬ (r. 677-651) doubled his armed forces to build the upper and lower division (shangjun ä¸è», xiajun ä¸è»). Duke Wen ææå ¬ (r. 637-628), who took over the role of lord-protector or hegemonial lord (ba é¸), created in 633 a third division (zhongjun ä¸­è»), and then enlarged his army to five divisions in 629, adding two \"new\" divisions (shang xinjun ä¸æ°è», xia xinjun ä¸æ°è»). Command was taken over by grand masters (dafu), heads of noble houses in the state of Jin. Several of these high dignitaries died in the late 620s, so the Duke decided to dissolve two divisions and reorganized the three remaining. In 588, Jin created six armies, which were ten years later reorganized to four divisions. In 560, the command of the fourth division was unified with that of the \"lower\" division, but four divisions continued to exist.\n\nIn the state of Qi é½, the reorganization of the military was combined with a restructuring of the local administration. The state was defended by three divisions. The state of Lu é­¯, still a powerful polity in the early Spring and Autumn period, had 30,000 men under arms (Wang & Yang 1996: 438). They were distributed over three divisions, each of which commanded by one of the Three Huan houses ä¸æ¡. In 577, two divisions were merged, and the house of Jisun å­£å­« commanded one, while the houses of Mengsun å­å­« and Shusun åå­« shared one division.\n\nDivisions were ranked. The \"upper\" was usually the superior one out of two, the \"central\" one that out of three or more divisions. The state of Chu æ¥ knew left and right divisions, the left one being the superior unit.\n\nConcerning the number of troops, Qi and Lu were 30,000 strong. During the interstate meeting of Huangchi é»æ± (Fengqiu å°ä¸, Henan) in 482, the representative of the state of Wu å³ was accompanied by 30,000 troops protected by corselets (jia ç²). The army of Yue è¶ consisted of 2,000 troops \"accustomed to naval warfare\" (xiliu ç¿æµ), 40,000 trained troops (jiaoshi æå£«), 6,000 elite troops (? junzi åå­), and 1,000 officers (zhuyu è«¸å¾¡).\n\nThe size of divisions was 10,000 in the states of Qi and Wu, and 12,500 in others.\n\nSmall military units in some states had the designation sheng ä¹ \"quadriga\", which shows how important chariots were still during that time. The word for \"division\" (jun è») is a graph showing a chariot inside a fencing or circumvallation. The dukes of Lu commanded one thousand chariots and 30,000 troops (Shijing è©©ç¶, hymn Bigong éå®®), and the state of Ji between 900 and 5,000, depending on the source. The powerful state of Chu æ¥ in the south had a force of even 10,000 chariots, with up to 1,000 chariots provided by each district (xian ç¸£) of the royal domain. The state of Qin ç§¦ in the west was able to deploy several hundred chariots in single campaigns, and commanded about 2,000 chariots in total. Smaller states like Zhu é¾ had 600, larger ones like Zheng or Song å® more than a thousand chariots (Wang & Yang 1996: 438-439).\n\nThe team of one chariot (sheng ä¹) was divided into squads (wu ä¼) of five men, commanded by a squad leader (wuzhang ä¼é·), platoons (liang å ©) of 25 men commanded by a platoon commander (liang sima å ©å¸é¦¬), and made a single company (zu å) commanded by a company commander (zuzhang åé·). Five chariot-infantry teams (\"companies\") built a battalion (dui é), ten a brigade (guan å®), fifty a division (zu å), and 100 a banner (shuai å¸¥). This was the largest organizational unit of chariot-infantry teams, but there were also groups of 125 and 81 teams. In some states, 700 chariots made three divisions, in others, 800 (He 1987: 42-43). In the state of Jin, the order was wu ä¼, liang å ©, zu å, shuai å¸¥, jun è»; in Qi, wu ä¼, xiaorong å°æ, zu å, lÃ¼ æ , and jun è»; and in Wu, wu ä¼, shi ä», zu å, lÃ¼ æ , and jun è» (Chen 1994: 89-90).\n\nChariots were manned by three men, the left one fighting with bow and arrow, the right one with spear and halberd, and the central person steering the vehicle. Each chariot was usually accompanied by a certain number of infantrymen, but the numbers were not fix. They ranged between 10 and 100. Ten footmen was the usual number of troops accompanying a chariot during the early Spring and Autumn period, and 75 was a common size in the late Warring States period for light chariots. The army of Chu used 100 persons per chariot (He 1987: 41). Yet even in individual armies, the number was not fix, as can be seen in the terracotta army of the First Emperor ç§¦å§çå¸ (r. 246-210 BCE), whose chariots were accompanied by 8, 28, or 32 infantrymen.\n\nFrom these relations, the number of infantry troops in each state of the Spring and Autumn period can roughly be assessed. Jin had probably 150,000 troops, Chu 300,000, and Qin 60,000 (Wang & Yang 1996: 440). Average armies included 700 to 800 chariots, when counting the army of the sovereign and the private troops of his noblemen (He 1987: 43).\n\nThe troops riding the chariot (chebing è»å µ) were protected by corselets and therefore called \"armoured soldiers\" (jiashi ç²å£«). Their mode of fighting required extensive training, not only to achieve mastery in hitting the enemy, but also to thrust into the heart of his formation and kill enemies and capture their officers. \"Infantrymen\" (tubing å¾å µ, lujun é¸è») were troops following the chariots and supporting them by fighting the enemy when the chariots had broken through his line. The earliest pure infantry units were used by the state of Zheng in 719. This state systematically expanded the number and use of infantry, and was very successful with this tactic in smaller battles. Infantry was more flexible than chariots when it came to small-scale manoeuvres, as is the case in rough terrain.\n\nIn the state of Jin, infantry was called hang è¡. In 633, Duke Wen created three infantry divisions (zuohang å·¦è¡, zhonghang ä¸­è¡, youhang å³è¡) to fight the Di tribes ç and the tribes of the northeast in Wuzhong ç¡çµ. The central division was commanded by Xun Linfu èæç¶, who adopted the term zhonghang as his family name. Yet three years later two divisions were transformed into traditional chariot-infantry divisions (shang xinjun, xia xinjun). The infantry units of the state of Chu were called lingshi éµå¸« \"hill banners\". In the state of Qi, quite a number of units fought without chariot because they were not just trained to fight on average level ground, but also on water, in marshes, slopes, mountains, or in the forest. The chapter Bingfa å µæ³ (17) of the book Guanzi ç®¡å­ describes these types. The chapter Ditu å°å (27) urges its readers to reconnoitre terrain before deciding over the type of forces going to fight. The state of Wu did perhaps not use chariots at all.\n\nInformation about infantry units is scarce, but one might suppose the following dimensions: ten men making a platoon (dui é), 100 a company (hang è¡), 1,000 a regiment (jing æ), and 10,000 a division (jun è») (He 1987: 43).\n\nThe combination of chariot and infantry units led to the development of battlefield tactics some of which are named in the chronicle Zuozhuan, like the battle arrays (zhen é£) yuli é­éº \"supper\", zuo-you ju å·¦å³ç© \"left and right wings\", jingshi èå°¸ (used in Chu), guan é¸ \"crane\", e éµ \"swan\", yu ç \"bowl\", or jiao è§ \"angle\". The typical \"supper array\" consisted of three parts (san zhen ä¸é£), with the central (chariot) unit standing in the rear and the two (infantry) wings advancing in square formations. The jingshi array of Chu consisted of five parts (wu zhen äºé£) advancing in a cross-shaped formation, spears (infantry, qianmao åè ) ahead, the commander in the middle (zhongquan ä¸­æ¬), elite troops in the rear (houjin å¾å), and chariot formations in the two wings (youyuan å³è½ , zuozhuiru å·¦è¿½è; Chen 1994: 94-95).\n\nIn 594, the five-part formation was also used by Duke Zhuang of Qi é½èå ¬ (r. 553-548) against Wei è¡ and Jin, with an advance part (xianqu å é© ), a central party (zhongqu ä¸­é© ), a rear guard (dadian å¤§æ®¿), and a left (qi å) and right (qu è ) wing. The state of Jin used the terms liang å ©, wu ä¼, zhuan å°, can å, and pian å, but changed them to qian å, hou å¾, zuojiao å·¦è§, youjiao å³è§, and qianju åæ in 542 with the drastic reduction of chariot units in favour of infantry.\n\nNaval units (zhoushi èå¸«) played a great role in water-rich south China. Of the three southern states, Chu had the mightiest fleet. In 549, it invaded the state of Wu by a fleet down the Yangtze, and defeated Wu again in the battle of Chang'an é·å²¸ in 535. In 523, the fleet of Chu attacked the Pu tribes æ¿® in what is today's Hunan. Yet in 506, Wu had become strong enough (with the support of Cai and Tang å) and defeated Chu in the battle of Baiju æè, forcing King Zhao of Chu æ¥æ­ç (r. 515-489) to flee. In 504, Prince Zhonglei çµç´¯ defeated the river navy of Chu under Pan Zichen æ½å­è£. In order to attack the state of Qi on the Shandong Peninsula in 486, the state of Wu built the Hangou Canal éæº (connecting the Yangtze with River Huai æ·®æ²³) leading its fleet northward. A year later, Wu sent Xu Cheng å¾æ¿, who sailed long the ocean shore to cut off the supplies or retreat of the army of Qi, but he was defeated after landing. The navy remained Wu's strength, and it never really mastered chariot warfare. The strategist Wu Zixu ä¼å­è¥ (d. 484) therefore urged the king of Wu to refrain from military campaigns against the states of the Central Plain which used chariot-infantry armies, a type of troops rarely used in the south. In 484 in the battle of Ailing è¾éµ, Wu defeated the army of Qi by using River Wen æ±¶æ°´ to transport troops and supplies.\n\nThe state of Yue several times defeated Chu by using the advantage of pursuit: The boats of Chu would have to return upriver and could thus not easily withdraw. The navy of Yue encompassed 300 \"halberd boats\" (gechuan æè¹) (Chen 1994: 109). When the arch-enemy of Wu, King Fucha å¤«å·® (r. 495-473), was at an interstate meeting in Huangchi the north, King Goujian å¥è¸ (r. 495- 465) ordered Fan Li èè ¡ and She Yong èåº¸ to attack Wu by cutting off the king from his own country. Ships brought troops along the sea shore to the River Huai region, and so annihilated Wu.\n\nCommand over the armies of regional states was taken over either by the regional ruler himself, but more often by his highest dignitaries, the ministers-commander (qing), or local administrators, the grand masters (dafu). They were occasionally called sima å¸é¦¬ \"commander of cavalry\" (jia sima å®¶å¸é¦¬ on state level, mazheng é¦¬æ­£ on the level of the nobility). Some states entrusted the command over the three divisions to certain noble families who retained this post over generations, like the houses Fan è, Zhi æº, Zhonghang, Zhao è¶, Wei é­, and Han é in the state of Jin, or Guo å and Gao é« in the state of Qi. Yet high commanders might also be appointed according to need, like the princes Wang Yin Qun çå°¹éº and Wang Yin Shou çå°¹å£½, actually administrators of the royal palace and workshops who were commanded the defence of Chu against Wu. It can be seen that there was still no clear separation between military and civilian administration during the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe main body of armies in the regional states consisted of troops and officers from the capital and the lord's domain. Yet it was also common that troops under the command of a nobleman carried out campaigns, like in 550, when Zhao Sheng è¶å (Lord Pingyuan å¹³åå) of Jin, governor (dafu) of Dongyang æ±é½ (today's Handan é¯é², Hebei), defended Jin against an invasion army of Qi. In 520, Prince Chao æ of the royal house of Zhou used local troops to expel Liuzi åå­ and King Dao å¨æ¼ç (r. 521-520) from the domain of Zhou. The king fled to Jin and was supported by local troops in the state of Jin under the command of the noblemen Ji Tan ç±è« and Xun Li èèº. The strongest contingents of such local troops were standing in the border regions of each state, in the case of Jin in the southern region (Jiao ç¦, Xia ç, Wen æº«, Yuan å), and in the state of Chu in the north (Shen ç³, Xi æ¯). In 660, Di tribes attacked the state of Wei. The state of Zheng thereupon sent out Gao Ke é«å  to establish a garrison to prevent the Di from crossing the Yellow River.\n\nNoblemen of all states had their own bodyguards (zubing æå µ, zuben æè³, in Chu called shengguang ä¹å»£), yet over time the number of such personal troops (sishu ç§å±¬, sizu ç§å, zujia æç²) increased. In 592, Xi Ke é¤å  took revenge for humiliation in the state of Qi by using his own troops, not that of the duke of Jin. The families Han and Yangshe ç¾è (Yang æ¥) in the state of Jin sustained as much as 900 chariots (Wang, Yang 1996: 449). In the state of Zheng, Zichan å­ç¢ built up his own army of 17 chariots (plus infantry) to take revenge for his father Ziguo å­å (Gongzi Fa å ¬å­ç¼), who had been killed by Wei Zhi å°æ­¢ in 563. He was supported by Zijiao å­è, who commanded government-owned troops. The nobility of Lu unifed a larger army of chariots than the state of Qi.\n\nIn the battle of Yanling é¢éµ (today in Henan) in 575, the noblemen Luan Shu æ¬æ¸ and Shi Xie å£«ç® (Fan Wenzi èæå­) commanded the ducal army, but were supported by their private troops as well. The possibility of sustaining armies of their own gave noblemen an instrument at hand to fight not just the lord of another state, but also each other or even the sovereign. As the stock of private armies were basically bodyguards, they were excellently trained.\n\nLike the regional rulers gradually built up their own armies in disregards of the king's monopoly over military affairs, the nobility within the states ignored the right of their sovereigns over military matters and gradually transforme their own bodyguards into veritable armies.\n\nData from the chronicle Zuozhuan show that during the Spring and Autumn period, 36 lords were killed by their own nobility, 13 were forced into exile, and 3 kings of the house of Zhou were dethroned or pushed outside the royal domain (Wang & Yang 1996: 449). In the state of Jin, for instance, Luan Ying æ¬ç built up his house army and, with the support of the nobleman Wei Shu é­è (Wei Xianzi é­ç»å­), conquered in 550 the ducal capital of Jin. In 548, Cui Zhu å´æ¼ with his private army was able to interfere into the succession of the dukes of Qi. The ducal line of the house of Jin was pushed away by the lineage of Quwo æ²æ². Yet some regional rulers were able to suppress their rebellious relatives, like Duke Zhuang of Zheng, who defeated Prince Gong Shu Duan å ±åæ®µ in 722, or King Wu of Chu æ¥æ­¦ç (r. 741-690), who withstood the assault of Prince Dou Min é¬¬ç· in 676.\n\nWarring States Period\n\nThe most important change in administrative matters took place in the early Warring States period, when professional leaders of armies, and professional institutions for the organization of campaigns emerged. The regional states created military sections (jiangmen å°é) and counselling sections (xiangmen ç¸é) in the central administration. In the state of Zhao, for instance, Lian Po å»é  was the high commander, while Lin Xiangru èºç¸å¦ (c. 315-c. 260) was counsellor-in-chief. The designation jiang å° or jiangjun å°è» was new. Wei Ran é­å was general in Qin, Bai Qi ç½èµ· was supreme commander (shang jiangjun ä¸å°è»), and Wang He çé½ lieutenant commander (weibai jiang å°è£¨å°) in the state of Qin. Tian Dan ç°å® was the supreme commander of Qi, Prince Shen ç³ that of Wei é­, later on the Lord of Xinling ä¿¡éµå took over command of the army of Wei. The generals of Han were Han Ju éè and Sou Shencha ä±¸ç³å·®, and the army of Yan was commanded by Yue Yi æ¨æ¯ . Chu was the only one of the states not making use of the position of supreme commander (shang jiangjun) or general-in-chief (da jiangjun å¤§å°è»). The supreme commander ranged only second after the counsellor-in-chief.\n\nThe armies of the Warring States period were structured in decadic steps:\n\nTable 2. Military units of the Warring States period unit size commander division (jun è») 10,000-12,500 wan ren zhi jiang è¬äººä¹å° regiment (?) 1,000 qian ren zhi jiang åäººä¹å° company (bo ä¼¯, bai ç¾) 100 bozhang ä¼¯é· squad (shi ä») 10 shizhang ä»é· team (wu ä¼) 5 wuzhang ä¼é·\n\nThe supreme commanders, the general-in-chief (dajiang å¤§å°), the generals to the left and right (zuo-you jiangjun å·¦å³å°è»), and also the individual unit leaders (zhang é·) were probably not fixed official posts, but temporary positions (Wang & Yang 1996: 565)\n\nThe command of the supreme general was absolute, and could not be abrogated by the sovereign of the regional state (jun zhong zhi shi, bu wen jun ming, jie you jiang chu è»ä¸­ä¹äºï¼ä¸èåå½ï¼çç±å°åº). Communication during war followed strict hierarchical principles. Direct communication with the king by bypassing the general was not allowed, by death penalty. Kings of the regional states did usually not participate in battles. This was different from the Spring and Autumn period, when sovereigns had exposed themselves to the threat of being hurt or killed.\n\nThe royal power nevertheless extended to the army, by means of two methods. The king owned the prerogative to invest the three highest generals and entrust the command into their hands during a campaign. The investiture of a general was a religious ceremony which involved divination and reports to the royal ancestors (see Zhou religion). During the ceremony, the king handed over an axe (fuyue æ§é) into the hands of the general, as a symbol of the military power being confided to the supreme general. Likewise, the king had the right to dismiss a general. Another means of control were tallies (fujie ç¬¦ç¯) handed over to the commander. Only the possession of such a tally allowed a commander to give military orders.\n\nAnother structural change in the Warring States period was the creation of huge standing armies. During the Spring and Autumn period, the size of armies had not surpassed several 10,000 troops. The battle of Chengpu åæ¿® (Chenliu é³ç, Henan, or Juancheng éå, Shandong) between Jin and Chu was fought with 700 chariots on the side of Jin, and a total number of troops from both sides of perhaps 70,000. In the battle of An é (close to Jinan æ¿å, Shandong) between Jin and Qi, Jin fielded 800 chariots. Chu was able to raise 10,000 chariots in the late Spring and Autumn period, and as much as 30,000 troops in total. Yet in the battle of Maling é¦¬éµ (Shenxian èç¸£, Henan), Wei had an army of 100,000, and Qi attacked Chu with a force of 200,000. Zhao crushed Zhongshan ä¸­å±± with 200,000 men, and Yan defeated Zhao with no less than 600,000 troops. Wang Jian used the same number of troops to conquer Chu (data from Zhanguoce æ°åç­; Wang & Yang 1996: 568-569).\n\nTable 3. Sizes of Warring States period armies according to the book Zhanguoce æ°åç­ state infantry (daijia å¸¶ç²) chariots (che è») cavalry (qi é¨) Qin >1,000,000 1,000 10,000 Chu 1,000,000 1,000 10,000 Wei 750,000 (300,000) * 600 5,000 Qi several 100,000 Zhao several 100,000 1,000 10,000 Han several 100,000 (300,000) Yan several 100,000 700 6,000\n\n* incl. wuzu æ­¦å (professional armoured infantry), cangtou è¼é ­ \"blueheads\" (a kind of home guard), fengong å¥®æ» \"assailers\", and situ å»å¾ (corvÃ©e soldiers)\n\nIt is not known how reliable these figures are, and the one or other might have been exaggerated in order to impress the enemy or the public, but it is a fact that the armies of the Warring States period were extremely large.\n\nAt the same time, the dimension of brutality grew. Having defeated Han and Wei in the battle of Yique ä¼é (close to Luoyang, Henan) in 293, the Qin general Bai Qi ordered to behead 240,000 enemies. In the battle of Changping é·å¹³ (Gaoping é«å¹³, Shanxi), Qin killed according to narrative 450,000 troops of Zhao.\n\nInfantry was usually protected by armour consisting of three parts, as can be seen in the pottery figurines of the tomb of the First Emperor, the expression daijia å¸¶ç² \"corselet carriers\", and various statements in early literature like Xunzi èå­ (ch. Yibing è­°å µ). The states therefore needed high numbers of corselets, which were produced in state-owned workshops. The state of Qin used the penal law to provide the army with corselets, as can be seen in the collection QinlÃ¼ zachao ç§¦å¾éæ, were paragraphs allowed to buy oneself free from punishment by delivering a fixed number of corselets to the authorities.\n\nThere were basically two types of infantry, namely archers and crossbowmen (juezhang è¹¶å¼µ, yinqiang å¼å¼·), and \"normal\" infantry (zhongzu ä¸­å) using clubs, maces, sabres or polearms (spears, halberds). The crossbow (nu å¼©) was a novel invention allowing aiming at a target without bringing up much physical power. The army of Han was most famous for its crossbow units. The number of archers was relatively high, as can be seen during the war of Zhao against the Xiongnu åå¥´, for which general Li Mu æç§ selected 100,000 archers.\n\nThe importance of cavalry increased during the Warring States period, perhaps under the influence of tribes in the northern sphere, like the Di or Xiongnu. King Wuling of Zhao è¶æ­¦éç (r. 326-299) imitated their war of warfare and systematically expanded the role of the cavalry, by even giving them \"barbarian rider jackets\" (hufu è¡æ) to wear. Li Mei from Qin battled against the Xiongnu with a force of 13,000 cavalry and 150,000 infantry. Sun Bin å­«è, advisor of Tian Ji ç°å¿, the dismissed counsellor of Qi, urged him to attack the army of Qi with chariots and cavalry. The military book Liutao å ­é explains the composition of cavalry units. Five riders were commanded by a leader (zhang é·), ten by one captain (li å), hundred by one commander (shuai ç), and 200 by a general (jiang å°). For battle tactics, five riders built one line (lie å), 30 one trunk (tun å±¯), and 60 one class (bei è¼©). The usual distance between horses in even terrain was 20 paces in length, and 4 to the sides (reduced to half of these values in rough terrain). The distance between lines was 50 paces.\n\nEven if the use of chariots (qingche è¼è») gradually declined, it was a fighting force not completely out of date. In the battle of Lingqiu å»ªä¸ (Yuncheng éå, Shandong) between Qi and Zhao, the former still used 2,000 chariots. In his war against the Xiongnu, Li Mu used 1,300 chariots. In 251, Yan went to war with 2,000 chariots against Zhao (Wang & Yang 1996: 571). The book Liutao explains that five chariots were commanded by a leader (zhang é·), fifteen by one captain (li å), fifty by a commander (shuai ç), and a hundred by a general (jiang å°). During battle, five chariots built one line (lie), fifteen one cluster (ju è), and thirty one trunk (tun å±¯). How these formations were built and commanded in practice, remains unclear.\n\nTable 4. Cavalry and chariot units and formations during the Warring States period Cavalry unit commander formation 5 platoon zhang é· leader 5 lie å line 10 company li å captain 30 tun å±¯ trunk 100 battalion shuai ç commander 60 bei è¼© class 200 brigade jiang å° general Chariots unit commander formation 5 platoon zhang é· leader 5 lie å line 15 company li å captain 15 ju è cluster 50 battalion shuai ç commander 30 tun å±¯ trunk 100 brigade jiang å° general\n\nThe importance of riverine fleet remained crucial during the Warring States period. After having conquered the state of Shu è in the Sichuan Basin, Qin used boats to attack the state of Chu in the middle Yangtze region. For this purpose, they used large grain boats to transport their troops river down. One boat was calculated at 50 troops and their supply. The state of Zhao also had a fleet which cruised the Yellow River. It was operating with the help of local fishermen.\n\nSeveral states invented specialist units that were trained in a particular way, like jiji ææ in Qi and wuzu æ­¦å in Wei. They had special armour, special equipment, and were used as special task forces moving quickly and living of the countryside (Xunzi, ch. Yibing è­°å µ).\n\nThe cross-shaped formation of the Spring and Autumn period transformed into a square field of eight parts and a centre, called the eight-parts array (bazhen å «é£). The general was in the centre. It is described in the military treatise Sun Bin bingfa å­«èå µæ³. When meeting the enemy, only the the first units advanced and engaged in battle, while the rest of the army remained in the back and shielded the fighters. It might be that chronicles only mentioned the troops directly engaged in battle when mentioning figures, and not the reserve standing in the back (Chen 1994: 96).\n\nMilitary theoreticians of the Warring States period use the binary concept of \"orthodox or regular\" and \"unorthodox or irregular\" (zheng-qi æ­£å¥) deployment. This pair has a metaphysical background, but can be applied to tactics and detachment. The regular mode of fighting (zheng) pertains to an element that initially meets an enemy directly, yet does not frontally attack or penetrate, but is used for holding or fixing action for irregular forces (qi) (Rand 2017: 45). The \"irregular mode\" pertains to troops causing the opponent to defend on his flanks or the rear. Irregular troops might fight independently or as parts of regular units and executing main attacks, often in a mode of surprise, for which reason \"irregular\" may be equalled with \"deceiving the enemy\". In the course of battle, the circumstances may necessitate the switching of roles of regular and irregular forces and so surprise the enemy with unexpected movements (Chen 1993: 122).\n\nThe word \"regular\" may refer to the main body of the army, the word \"irregular\" to specialized troops, like cavalry (compare the homophony of /kÇe/ å¥ with /É¡Çe/ é¨), which required special preparation or particular skills. In this connotation, regular troops and their movements build the fundament for victory, while the tactical movements of irregular troops are the key for victory (Li et al. 2017). The terms zheng and qi are also linked to the realms of civilian rule, the regular part of rulership (wen æ=zheng æ­£), and of war, the irregular way of ruling (wu æ­¦=qi å¥).\n\nHorses and chariots were provided by the government of each state, as can be seen from the law on stables and pastures (JiuyuanlÃ¼ å©èå¾) as recorded on the bamboo slips in Yunmeng é²å¤¢, Hubei (Shuihudi ç¡èå°). Crossbows and swords, formerly rare weapons, found increasing use during the Warring States period. During the battle of Maling in 342, the army of Qi laid an ambush of \"ten thousand crossbowmen\" (Wang & Yang 1996: 576). The number of iron arms also drastically increased, as can be seen in statements of the book Xunzi (ch. Yibing), as well as in archaeological finds like in the state of Yan, where a tombs included no less than 1,840 tools, more than half of them consisting of weapons or parts of weapons and armour, and 97 made of iron (Wang & Yang 1996: 576).\n\nFigures 1-2. Iron helmet and dagger-axe with inscription\n\nIron helmet unearthed in a Warring-States tomb from the state of Yan. It is composed of 89 iron plates (zhaye æ­è) in seven rows and tied with silk threads or leather stripes. Height 26cm, diameter 24cm.\n\nThe bronze ge æ dagger axe has a length of 31.5cm and a height of 17.5cm. It bears an inscription indicating the names and functions of the producers, a date, and the location (youguanfu å³è²«åº). Click to enlarge. Both from Hebei Sheng/Liu 1975.\n\nWeapons, when provided by the government to soldiers, were marked with incised characters or alternatively with characters written with black or red lacquer indicating the local government which had produced of procured the weapons. Weapons found by archaeologists were marked with the name of the commandery and the place where the weapons belonged to. This custom was seen in Qin, Wei, Qi, and Han. The law code of Qin foresaw that a local official not providing quality weapons to the troops was punished severely. Fragments of the book Shangjunshu ååæ¸ show that the state of Qin did not provide weapons to merchants liable for military service, but they had to purchase them from their own funds. During campaigns, daily rations were provided by the government. The grain earmarked for the army was strictly protected, and abuse of it by civilian officials was sanctioned. Clothes were a matter of each soldier himself, and were not provided for by the government.\n\nRecruitment and training\n\nDuring the Western Zhou period, members of noble families, i.e. the royal house and the houses of the regional rulers, with the ranks of \"minister\" (qing), grand master (dafu), and serviceman (shi), were entitled or obliged to do military service. Each noble family had to provide one male member ready for service (zhengfu æ­£å¤«, in service zhengzu æ­£å or zhengtu æ­£å¾). Other sons (yuzi é¤å­) were \"reserve officers\" (xianzu ç¾¨å) who did participate in training, but did not have to serve unless the state was in great distress (Yang 1994: 91).\n\nThe ritual Classic Zhouli (part Diguan å°å®, ch. Xiang dafu éå¤§å¤«) explains that the prescribed height of soldiers was 7 feet (chi å°º, see weights and measures), and the age of 60 sui was the limit for participation in training. In Zhou-period law, the height of body was more important than a minimum age, as can still be seen in preserved laws from the Qin period ç§¦ (221-206 BCE), or transmitted sources like Lunyu è«èª (ch. Taibo æ³°ä¼¯) or Xunzi (ch. Zhongni ä»²å°¼).\n\nCommon troops were recruited from among the farming people of the royal domain according to need. According to regulations in the Zhouli, ten families had to provide one soldier, while the government cared for his food, horse and equipment. It is also quite probable that unfree persons, normally working the field of the royal domain, served in the infantry (He 1987: 24).\n\nThe members of the royal guard were sons of \"ministers\" and grand masters, also called \"sons of the state\" (guozi åå­) and were instructed not only in martial arts, but also in the way of right comportment according to social rules, and so combined military with civilian education (wen wu bu fen ææ­¦ä¸å \"civilian and military matters are not separated\"), including writing and arithmetics (see liuyi å ­è, the \"Six Arts\").\n\nThe custom to train archery was an inherent part of ritual prescriptions as seen in the village archery contests described in the ritual Classics Yili åç¦® (ch. Xiangshe li éå°ç¦®, Dashe å¤§å°) and Liji (ch. Sheyi å°ç¾©).\n\nThe typical period of military training (jiang wu è¬æ­¦) was winter, when peasants did not work the fields (Guoyu, ch. Zhouyu å¨èª A). The king took part in the training activities during the twelfth lunar month, quite probably in connection with hunting (compare Shijing, part Binfeng è±³é¢¨, air Qiyue ä¸æ; Zuozhuan, Yingong 5).\n\nMilitary training was carried out in the shape of hunts. There were particular terms for hunts during the four seasons of spring (sou è), summer (miao è), autumn (xian ç®), and winter (shou ç©; Zuozhuan, Yingong 5). In several occasions, the state of Jin combined the spring hunt directly with an attack on enemies (Chen 1994: 85).\n\nIn the early Spring and Autumn period, the Western-Zhou system of the division between capital and environs (guo å - ye é, or xiang é - sui é) was still valid. Inhabitants of the capital seat of each regional state (guoren åäºº) were liable for regular military service (zhengzu), or had to keep ready to serve in the reserve (xianzu), while those living outside the royal seat or that of the regional rulers (yeren éäºº), i.e. peasants, delivered tribute grain without serving in the army. The main body of troops was built by men from the townships. In case of need the army of the metropolitan city (zhiguo å¶å) was supplemented by troops from the environs, and eventually such from the lands of the lower nobility (gongyi å ¬é, cai é) of the border regions, called yibing éå µ or xianbing ç¸£å µ. The age of recruits was between 30 and 60 sui, while that of men for labour services (see corvÃ©e) was between 20 and 50 sui.\n\nYet this custom was no longer adhered to in the middle and late Spring and Autumn period, and regional rulers began to recruit troops by a conscription system encompassing the whole domain.\n\nConscription was based on the well-field system (jingtian zhi äºç°å¶), according to which a farming community cultivated eight parts of a communal field, while the ninth part served either to deliver tax grain (shui ç¨ ) or to support troops provided by the community (fu è³¦). The latter was practically a \"tax in kind\", namely a chariot, troops, weapons and equipment. This situation is described in the military treatise Simafa å¸é¦¬æ³, and in a slightly different form in the historiographical book Hanshu æ¼¢æ¸ (23 Xingfa zhi åæ³å¿). A complete \"well\" consisted of 300 families which delivered a chariot and troops. Alternatively, four \"farming communities\" (dian ç¸) of 64 jing or a group of 576 households provided one chariot, 3 charioteers (jiashi), 72 infantrymen, 4 horses, and 12 oxen - which was nothing else than one full chariot team. In the state of Lu, the basic unit was one \"hill\" (qiu ä¸), i.e. 144 households (He 1987: 46). According to the Simafa, a \"hill\" consisted of four settlements (yi é) and provided a war horse and three oxen. In the state of Wei è¡, fu was the name of a military unit (Chen 1994: 87). The conscription method according to settlements was called \"hill-community method\" (qiudianfa ä¸ç¸æ³), or \"hill-chariot method\" (qiushengfa ä¸ä¹æ³), and their products were called \"settlement weapons\" (zuozhoubing ä½å·å µ), \"settlement shields\" (zuoqiujia ä½ä¸ç²), and the system \"settlement conscription\" (zuoqiufu ä½ä¸è³¦).\n\nThe administrative reforms of Guan Zhong ç®¡ä»² (725-645) in the state of Qi established parallel structures of local administration and military units, showing that the army was expected to be constituted of men drawn from each village. Five families constituted a \"track\" (gui è») commanded by a \"track master\" (guizhang è»é·), and five soldiers a squad (wu ä¼). Ten \"tracks\" constituted one hamlet (li é), fifty soldiers a small force (xiaorong å°æ), commanded by a captain (si å¸). Four hamlets made one \"alliance\" (lian é£) commanded by an alliance head (lianzhang é£é·), and two hundred soldiers a company (zu å). Ten alliances made a township (xiang é) commanded by a township master (xiang liangren éè¯äºº), and two thousand men made a regiment (lÃ¼ æ ). Five townships were a banner (shuai å¸¥), corresponding to a division (jun è») of 10,000 men, commanded by a commander (shuai å¸¥) (Guanzi, ch. Xiaokuang å°å¡).\n\nTable 5. Conscription system of in the state of Qi é½ after Guan Zhong's ç®¡ä»² reforms living unit military unit size commander gui è» wu ä¼ squad 5 guizhang è»é· li é xiaorong å°æ small force 50 si å¸ lian é£ zu å company 200 lianzhang é£é· xiang é lÃ¼ æ regiment 2,000 xiang liangren éè¯äºº shuai å¸¥ jun è» division 10,000 shuai å¸¥\n\nThese relations mean that in Qi, each household was theoretically responsible for providing one man for military service. Yet it seems that in practice, the number of families providing two men or more was considerable when it came to the worst (Wang & Yang 1996: 442). The reforms of Guan Zhong made the inhabitants of the ducal domain virtually professional soldiers. Those liable for military service (junfu è»è³¦) were even segregated from merchants and craftsmen and not allowed to move. On the other hand, they were not any more liable for corvÃ©e or other forms of tax payment. Duke Huan é½æ¡å ¬ (r. 685-643) selected the best of them to serve in his administrative apparatus, while the common folks (shuren åº¶äºº) served in the army (He 1987: 44). The increasing frequency of wars destroyed the old distinction between persons serving in war (zhengzu) and the reserve (xianzu). In the late Spring and Autumn period, practically all reserve soldiers participated in battles (Chen 1994: 88).\n\nTraining was gradually opened to troops and officers, and not just the nobility. According to the law of some states, one school was built to instruct 80 households. In the state of Jin, certain dignitaries were responsible for training. Bian Jiu å¼ç³¾ (Luan Jiu æ¬ç³¾) trained the charioteers as chief charioteer (rongyu æå¾¡, yurong å¾¡æ), Xun Bin èè³ the elite infantry, Ji Yan ç±å the chariot-infantry teams, and Cheng Zheng ç¨é­ the train responsible for the horses (He 1987: 47).\n\nAlso during the Warring States period, squads were recruited from peasant households, which had basically the duty to protect the \"four neighbourhoods\" (silin åé°), but served in the army in times of war. According to the military book Weiliaozi å°ç¹å­ (ch. Wuzhi ling ä¼å¶ä»¤), fifty men constituted a home platoon (shu å±¬), and hundred man a home company (lÃ¼ é­).\n\nThe huge armies of the Warring States period were only feasible because the recruitment system had changed drastically. While in earlier ages, the king of Zhou and regional rulers used the inhabitants of the city and the royal/local domain to fill the ranks and files of their armies and only fell back on the villages outside in the second place, the rulers of the Warring States had a grip on the whole population of their states, regardless where and in which domains they lived. This choice was the result of administrative changes which laid all land in the hands of the central government and gave up domains for the nobility. The new recruitment was called \"group the households of all the people\" (bian hu qi min ç·¨æ¶é½æ°). This method expressed the possibility that the state had access to the services of the whole population and could \"group\" them in labour or military teams.\n\nThe state of Wei é­ was probably the first who transformed the traditional conscription system to an enlistment system (wuzu zhi æ­¦åå¶), with the expectation that this practice would yield highly trained professionals as a body from which, with increasing experience, also lower officers could be drawn. Moreover, professional soldiers would specialize on specific fighting tactics or particular types of weapons like the bow or crossbow. The reform was carried out under the supervision of the military expert Wu Qi å³èµ·, and when the latter fled to Chu, was applied successfully in this state, too.\n\nThe counsellor of Qin, Shang Yang åé (390-338), explained in his book Shangjunshu ååæ¸ that people served as farmers just as they served as soldiers. The armies of the Warring States period thus waged \"peasant wars\" (gengzhan èæ°, nongzhang è¾²æ°). For this purpose, Shang Yang wanted to train the farming population in a way that half of them worked the fields, while the other half learned how to fight. From each family, one male person of 23 sui and older was directly liable for military service (zhengzu æ­£å), while the others constituted a rotating reserve (gengzu æ´å). Yet others lived in garrisons (shuzu æå). In the state of Qin therefore, all male persons were usually called \"men of the squads\" (shiwu å£«ä¼).\n\nThe advisor Su Qin èç§¦ held that the capital city of Qi, Linzi è¨æ· (Shandong), was able to produce 210,000 troops. Perhaps this number did not only include males, but also females, because womenâliable for corvÃ©e just as the menâwould help to build defences. Even under-age persons and the elderly built an own \"regiment\" for the defence of a city, as the book Shangjunshu (ch. Bingshou å µå®) holds. Such statements are also found in chapters on defence in the book Mozi å¢¨å­.\n\nThe age of persons serving in the army remained between 30 and 60 sui, as before, but the household registration system of the Warring States period allowed to mark younger persons for the reserve (fu ä»). Instead of the age, the physical height was used as a precondition for service in the armyâ5 chi and more. It is quite probable that these regulations were not strictly adhered to when the state needed soldiers, for instance, after the disastrous battle of Changping, when Yan and Zhao were bereaved of their adult soldiers. Lord Xinling of Wei é­ tried to ameliorate the situation and sent home fathers, when fathers and sons served in the army, and older brothers, when also the younger one served in the army. In the end, he retained the younger persons in the armyâand defeated Qin (Wang & Yang 1996: 574).\n\nApart from conscription, Qin knew the mode of voluntary enlisting (mu å) with defined periods of service (Wang & Yang 1996: 575). Other military contingents consisted of persons who served in the army as a kind of penalty (lichen é¸è£, see chongjun å è»).\n\nWeapons\n\nPointed weapons\n\nFigure 3. Dagger-axes, axes, and swords of the Western Zhou period\n\nWestern Zhou-period weapons unearthed in Zhuyuangou ç«¹åæº and and Rujiazhuang è¹å®¶è near Baoji å¯¶é·, Shaanxi. The image shows ge æ-type dagger-axes (1-8), fu æ§ axes (9-10), and shortswords (duanjian ç­å, 11-12). Source: Zhongguo shehui kexue yuan kaogu yanjiusuo 2004: 124.\n\nThe Zhou used mainly the same materials as the Shang for their weapons, namely wood, stone, bone, and shell, and of course bronze. Yet both technical advancement and the consolidation of the economic base made it possible to produce more weapons and chariots for larger armies with more horses. The use of the traditional weapons spear (mao ç), bow and arrow (gong å¼, shi ç¢, the arrow later called jian ç®­), dagger (dao å), and ge æ dagger-axe tied to a long pole continued, while novel pointed weapons found entrance into the army, namely the cross-shaped spear-axe ji æ, and the long sword (jian å).\n\nFigures 4a-c. Ji æ spear-axes and ge æ dagger-axes\n\nLeft top: Drawings of two ji æ spear-axes, a combination of a lance and the ge æ dagger-axe. The upper type is the so-called picking halberd (ciji åºæ), the lower one a hook-halberd (gouji éæ). Archaeological finds date from the mid-Western Zhou, but the earliest written source using the word ji is Zuozhuan (Yingong 11, and Xuangong å®£å ¬ 2). From Shen 1992. Right top: Images of two dagger-axes (length 17.4cm, and 21cm), the upper one richly decorated with turquois stones. From Zhang 2017. Bottom: Eye-socket halberd (qiongji éæ), with a closed end instead of a lance or hook at the tip. The body is richly decorated with fierce masks. Length 14.3cm; unearthed in Zhuyuangou near Baoji, Shaanxi. From Zhongguo qingtongqi quanji bianji weiyuanhui (1996: 182).\n\nThe shape of spearheads changed in so far as the blade (ren å) became longer than the socket (qiong é). Simultaneously, the number of ridges was increased in order to stabilize the blade. Nailing became the most important mode of fastening the spearhead to the pole. The shaft of an infantry spear (qiumao é ç) was 2-zhang ä¸ long (see weights and measures), that of mounted troops (yimao å¤·ç) 2.4 zhang. The use of the spear decreased over time, as chariot-infantry teams became the most important tactical unit (Shen 1998: 457).\n\nThe ji halberd is practically a merger of a spear and the ge dagger-axe which is tied horizontally to a pole. In this combined shape, the weapon could be used for cutting and thrusting (\"hooking\" gou å¾, \"picking\" zhuo å, \"staking\" zhuang æ¨, and \"lancing\" ci åº, Yang 1994: 117). A Shang-period precursor of this combination was found in Gaochengtai èåèº, Hebei. The metal part of a ji was usually 1.6 chi-long, as the Kaogongji èå·¥è¨ says. In order to strengthen the stability of the pole during charges, the lower end was equipped by a spur (zun é) or with a protective cover with a flat end (dun é; Xu 2013).\n\nArrowheads (zu é) made of bone, horn, or bronze were made flatter and sharper than during the Shang period.\n\nThe origin of the crossbow might have been in south China, perhaps in the late Spring and Autumn period, as metal relics found in earlier times bore dateable inscriptions pointing at the 6th century or so (Gao 1964: 41). The most important transmitted source on the early history of the crossbow is the book Wu-Yue chunqiu å³è¶æ¥ç§, where the state of Chu is said to have been the place of origin, from which the use of the crossbow soon spread to the other regional states. Relics of a crossbow (metal and wooden parts) were unearthed from a Warring-States period tomb in Changsha é·æ², Hunan, in 1952; metal parts in a tomb in Luoyang æ´é½, Henan, in 1972; two mechanisms in Chengdu æé½, Sichuan, in 1955; and in 1982, a metal mechanism came to light in a tomb in Dayi å¤§é, Sichuan; to date, about a dozen of crossbow mechanisms from the late Zhou and the Qin period ç§¦ (221-206 BCE) have been found (Xie 2004: 52). Tombs in Lintong è¨æ½¼, Shaanxi, from the Qin period included many crossbows, discovered in 1975 and 1980. Some of them were used by the crews of chariots. The parts of the mechanism were cast, and not forged (Xie 2004: 53). Calculations show that the tractive force of a Qin crossbow corresponded to the weight of 492-738 jin æ¤ (see weights and measures; would be 1221-1832 N), and the shooting range to 138 to 831m (idem).\n\nFigure 5-6. Shu æ®³ clubs and crossbow mechanism\n\nLeft: Metal remnants of shu æ®³-type clubs or cudgels. It can be seen that they the sticks were heavily armed at the rear and the wood strengthened by rings between the metal and the handle. From Liu (2015). Right: Metal mechanism of a crossbow from the state of Chu. The lowest drawing shows the \"lock\" (jijian æ©ä»¶) which consists of three parts, namely two teeth (one of which being the sight, wangshan æå±±), a trigger (xuandao æ¸å), and a blocker (shuansai æ´å¡). Overall length 51.8cm. From Gao (1964).\n\nThe oldest sword excavated to far was only 20-30cm-long and did not have a ridge in the middle of the blade, making it prone to distortions. Moreover, the oldest swords had only a very simple hilt. This basic shape was constantly improved during the Western Zhou period, and in later phases, hilts were richly decorated with incrustations of turquois stone. The length of a sword was then determined by the bearer's height, with a length of 2-3 chi (30-60cm) and a weight of 2.06-3.75 jin æ¤ (1-1.7kg) (Yang 1994: 117).\n\nThe long sword only developed in the late Spring and Autumn period and was then rather designed for piercing and thrusting, not for slashing and cutting (Sawyer 1993: 371). Swords thereafter replaced various forms of halberds like the ge dagger-axes, but ji spear-axes remained an important infantry weapon in the Warring States period. The southern regional states developed a highly decorated type of ceremonial sword (labelled \"swords of King XY of Yue\", like Yue wang Gou Jian zhi jian è¶çå¥è¸å, and other names like of rulers like Buguang ä¸å  (Yiç¿³), or Yushi æ¼ç (Shiyu é¼«è).\n\nFigures 7a-c. Swords\n\nDevelopment of one particular sword type (Ea) over the whole Zhou period. It can be seen how the dagger evolved to a short sword, and then to a long sword from the Spring and Autumn period on. Decorations of the centre of the blade (not the edges) were fashionable during that time, before swords became more practical. From Tian (2013).\n\nComponents of a traditional Chinese sword with pommel (shou é¦), hilt (jing è; whole part called bing æ), hilt ring (gu ç®), hilt ears (er è³; in both cases, the tang is not covered by a hilt) guard (ge æ ¼), blade base (ben æ¬), blade shoulder (jian è©), edge (ren å), ridge (ji è, zhuji æ±è), flat (cong å¾), and tip (feng é). From Tian (2013). The right image shows the decorations on the guard of a sword from the kingdom of Yue. The decoration consists of characters with turquois stones, inscribed Zhezhi Yuyi è æ¨æ¼ç (Zhuji Shiyu è«¸ç¨½é¼«è, i.e. King Luying è¶çé¹¿é¢, r. 465-459), at the bottom of the image one of two hilt rings. The blade itself is made of bronze and its main area richly decorated with rhomboid patterns consisting of portions of metal with a higher content of tin. The edges are of quality metal. From Cao (2018).\n\nProtection\n\nWhile the shape of helmets (zhou å) was not changed, the functionality of cuirasses (jia ç²) was ameliorated. A leather cuirass found in a horse-and-chariot pit in Xi'an è¥¿åºµ near Jiaoxian è ç¸£, Shandong, consisted of a breast part and a back part, the breast cover made of three parts in the shape of a beast face (37Ã28cm), and the back cover of two round pieces of 11cm. Shields (dun ç¾), either smaller ones for mounted troops, or larger ones for infantry troops, were made of leather and strengthened by bronze parts, or leather mounted on a wooden frame. A shield discovered in a tomb in Liulihe ççæ²³ near Beijing consisted of seven parts arranged in the shape of a fierce animal (zhengning çç°) mask.\n\nArmour was made of tanned, lacquered, and finally coloured, leather pieces tied together to tunics (Sawyer 1993: 369). The length depended on the type of unit, the infantry wearing rather short-style tunics. Helmets were of bronze, and from the Warring States period on also of iron (Sawyer 1993: 370). The stirrup was not invented until the 3rd or 4th century CE, for which reason no heavy cavalry developed in earlier times, which does not mean that rider and horse did not wear any form of protection. A tomb from the state of Chu included a set of leather horse armour (Bai 1989).\n\nFigures 8-9. Body armour and horse armour\n\nLeft: Reconstruction of a body armour (kaijia é§ç²) from the very late Warring States period, tomb complex of the First Emperor. It is composed of many limestone (shihuiyan ç³ç°å²©) scales (0.7-1.1mm thick) tied together by copper wire. There were different modes of tying the segments of the collar, the shoulder protectors, the upper part of the body protection, and that for the belly. According to the position, the mineral scales had different shapes. The whole armour has, when put on, to be tied on the side of the body. It had a weight of no less than 23.18kg. From Song (2004). Right: Reconstruction of a horse armour found in a tomb of the state of Chu in Baoshan å å±± near Jingmen èé, Hubei. It consists of lacquered leather pieces. From Bai (1989).\n\nChariots\n\nChariot was introduced into China in c. 1200 BCE, but no major alterations of the vehicle occurred until the Spring and Autumn period, when several types of specialized chariots emerged, as such equipped with large shields for protection, towers for observation or command, such with battering rams, moveable ladders, or with multiple- bolt crossbows (Sawyer 1993: 363).\n\nShang inscriptions yield no evidence for the use of chariots as battle elements. Shang soldiers were apparently fighting on foot, but some of the Shangâs enemies used chariots, for instance, the Zhou (Sawyer 1993: 364). However it might have been, the importance of the chariot increased drastically in the Western Zhou and the Spring and Autumn periods, and massed chariot battles were usual during the time. Yet some authors doubt that the chariots might have had a decisive role in battles, as the construction of the vehicles with their long axles did not allow swift movements even in flat terrain. The advance of chariot formations cannot have been but at measured pace in order to coordinate the lines, so that it might have been easy for infantry to surround and obstruct chariot formations (Sawyer 1993: 365).\n\nChariots were pulled by two or four horses. Even if the general appearance of the chariot remained the same as under the Shang, the shape of the drawbar (yuan è½ ) was bent stronger, which took off some pressure from the yokes (e è»). The chest, where coacher and archer were sitting, became as large as 130-160cm (Yang 1994: 118). With the help of bronze linchpins (xia è½), the axle-caps (wei è») were fastened tighter at the side of the naves (gu è½) and above the axle (chou è»¸), Bronze fittings on the inner side of the naves protected them and reduced vibrations transmitted from the axle. Bronze fittings, often with beautiful designs, protected and strengthened drawbar and yokes. \"Phoenix bells\" (luan é¾, from luan é¸) were a common accessory tied to the axle-caps.\n\nChariots thus equipped are in bronze inscriptions called \"metal chariots\" (jinche éè»), while traditional sources use the words rongche æè» \"war chariot\" or gongche æ»è» \"chariot for charge\". Chariots used for attack were also called \"light\" (qingche è¼è»), such for attack during sieges \"advance chariot\" (linche è¨è») or \"chariots for charge\" (chongche è¡è»), while vehicles used for defence were called \"wide chariot\" (guangche å»£è»). \"Manoeuvre chariot\" (pengche è¹è») was a vehicle equipped with leather shields to ward off arrows.\n\nThe widespread custom to bury chariots along with a deceased lord helped to preserve quite a few vehicles or parts of them. Yet in most cases, the wood is rotten, and in such cases, only shadows of the vehicle remain.\n\nFigure 10. Reconstruction of a chariot of the Western Zhou period\n\nReconstruction of a mid Western Zhou-period chariot as based on the relics found in the tomb of the Lord of Jing äº (Xing é¢) in Zhangjiapo å¼µå®¶å¡ near Xi'an è¥¿å®, Shaanxi. Source: Zhang & Zhang 1994: 170.\n\nThe technique of the chariot improved during the Spring and Autumn period. Master Sun Wu å­«æ­¦ discerned light chariots (chiche é¦³è», qingche è¼è», gongche æ»è», wuche æ­¦è») and heavy chariots (geche é©è», zhongche éè», shouche å®è», pingche è¹è»). The former was used for attack, the latter for defence. War chariots had a long axis (therefore also known as changgu é·è½) and could barely overturn, even in rough terrain. They were also used for reconnaissance and inspections, then known as queche éè» or youque éé.\n\nHeavy chariots were an advancement of the Western Zhou zizhongche ééè» cart which had four wheels and was drawn by oxen. It was not used in war, but for transportation of equipment and supplies, and also to build corrals in open terrain. Some were protected against arrows with leather tarps, hence the name geche é©è». This tactic is mentioned in the book Sun Bin bingfa and the Classic Zhouli (part Chunguan æ¥å®, ch. Zongbo å®ä¼¯; part Xiaguan å¤å®, ch. Sima å¸é¦¬). Transport carts were accompanied by 25 men, which took over cooking, feeding the horses, and mending the equipment of the troops.\n\nSupreme commanders used a command chariot (zhihuiche ææ®è») of their own, and were accompanied by a rescue chariot (zuoche ä½è») in case the main chariot was damaged (He 1987: 41).\n\nCavalry\n\nCavalry emerged as a particular fighting unit between the early 5th century and 300 BCE. In earlier times, even the nomad tribes of the Hu è¡ the north had fought as infantry or with chariots. It might have been that cavalry was introduced by the Hu tribes and found entrance into the states of the Zhou empire when King Wuling of Zhao founded cavalry units to counter raids of the Hu tribes. Accordingly, he also changed the dresses and had mounted 'knights' wear rider jackets and trousers (Sawyer 1993: 367). Still, cavalry remained only an auxiliary force until the Han period.\n\nCavalry was employed mainly in the shape of \"unorthodox\" (qi) tactics by throwing them into battle by launching attacks from directions and in styles different from the \"orthodox\" (zheng) fighting style of infantry formations (Sawyer 1993: 370).\n\nArsenals\n\nThe king of Zhou usually handed over weapons to the troops before the beginning of a campaign. During the Spring and Autumn period, the regional rulers followed this custom. In each state, an arsenal was built which was administrated by a particular officer. The Zhouli lists the manager of arms (sibing å¸å µ), who kept and distributed \"the five [types/groups of] weapons and shields\" (wubing wudun äºå µäºç¾). The manager of halberds and shields (sigedun å¸æç¾) supervised chariots and the arms of the guard, and the manager of bows and arrows (sigongshi å¸å¼ç¢) the six groups of bows, four groups of crossbows, and the eight groups of arrows. The commandant of the stud (jiaoren æ ¡äºº) was responsible for the management of the five groups of horses. Banners and flags, and drums and bells were managed by individual officers. Similar functionaries are mentioned in the Zuozhuan (Xianggong è¥å ¬ 8) for the state of Song (Chen 1994: 83-84).\n\nGarrisons\n\nAfter the foundation of the Zhou dynasty and the initial wars against the last members of the Shang, the Duke of Zhou ordered the construction of a secondary capital in the east, namely Chengzhou in present-day Luoyang, Henan. This capital mainly served military purposes. A garrison of 8 eastern divisions would be ready to put down any further rebellion. At the same time, the military contingents around the western metropolitan region Feng-Hao è±é¬ (west of today's Xi'an, Shaanxi) were increased. The larger regional states were not just civilian units, but likewise served to defend the sovereignty of the Zhou. These were Wei è¡ and Song in the Central Plain, Yan ç in the northeast (close to present-day Beijing), Qi and Lu on the Shandong peninsula, and some smaller states in the Central Plain. Even the semi-barbarian state of Wu in the southeast was ruled by a member of the house of Zhou. Many of the statelets between the Yellow River and the Yangtze were founded and ruled by members of the Zhou house.\n\nThe only weak point of this network of military garrisons of the Western Zhou was the northwest, where the tribes of the Di ç, Rong æ and Xianyun remained strong and eventually ended the Western Zhou.\n\nCity walls and \"long walls\"\n\nThe ritual system of the Zhou fixed the theoretical length of city walls as 12 or 9 li é (6 or 4.5km) for the royal capital, 9 or 7 for a greater regional ruler, 7 or 5 for an average ruler, 5 or 3 for a small state. There was a construction unit for city walls of 1 du å µ (1 zhang high and 1 zhang wide), and 1 zhi é as 3 du (Yang 1994: 121). Outside the city wall a moat was dug out. Such work was supervised by special officials, keepers of security (zhanggu æåº) and surveyors (liangren éäºº; Zhouli, part Xiaguan, ch. Sima å¸é¦¬). Transmitted sources allege that the royal capital was constructed in a checkerboard pattern, with three gates at each side of the square city wall. Yet such a pattern might be an idealized picture created in much later times. While city walls were found in Luoyang, no fortifications were found in the \"metropolitan\" region of Feng-Hao.\n\nWith the growth of the economy (see Zhou economy), cities became centres of trade and wealth, and therefore also interesting objects in conquest wars. Accordingly, Warring Staters period strategists like Mozi or Sun Bin talk about siege and defence of cities. Cities were built in places that were easy to defend and difficult to assail. They were located at the banks of great rivers to secure water supply for drinking and to fill the city moats. Defence systems consisted of two types, namely inner city walls (cheng å; the word yuan å£ designates one side or stretch) with moat (chenghe åæ²³, chenghao åå£, hao æ¿ ) \"for the protection of the sovereign\", and outer walls or ramparts (guo é­) \"for the protection of the people\".\n\nThe royal city of Luoyang, for instance, was in the west protected by River Jian æ¾æ°´, and from the south by River Luo æ´æ²³. The city of Xintian æ°ç°, capital of Jin, was protected by the rivers Fen æ±¾æ²³ and Hui æ¾®æ²³, and Xinzheng æ°é­, seat of the lords of Zheng and Han, by the rivers Ji æ´æ²³ and Huang é»æ°´æ²³. Handan, Hebei, served from 386 to 228 as seat of the kings of Zhao. It consisted of two parts, the Royal City (wangcheng çå) with the palace, and the Great Northern City (dabeicheng å¤§åå) for the commoners. The Royal City was composed of three sections, each of which was surrounded by a wall. The base of the wall was 15-40m, and the ruins have height of 3-8m (Zhongguo shehui kexue yuan kaogu yanjiusuo 2014: 238). Handan had no city moat, but two rivers (Qin æ²æ²³ and Zhu æ¸æ²³) crossed the two parts of the city and secured the supply of water. The northern \"rampart\" city had a length of 4,800m and a width of 3,200m. In the northwest corner of the city, a natural hill (Lingshan éå±±) was integrated into the city wall.\n\nTraces of a moat are visible in the ruins of Linzi è¨æ· (Zibo æ·å, Shandong), the capital of Qi. The moat was filled by water from River Zi æ·æ²³ located east of the city. Unlike in Handan, the royal city and the city of commoners were not separated by a rift, but the royal city with its rectangular form was in the southwest corner of the city complex. The total length of the city wall is 14km, and the moats had a width of 25-30m (Zhongguo shehui kexue yuan kaogu yanjiusuo 2014: 250). The wall around the royal city was 20-38m wide, and protected by a moat from all four sides (between 13 and 25m wide), even in the parts connected with the large city.\n\nFigures 11a-b. Plans of the cities of Handan and Linzi\n\nArchaeological plans of the cities of Handan (Hebei), capital of Zhao, and Linzi (Shandong), capital of Qi. From Zhongguo shehui kexue yuan kaogu yanjiusuo 2014.\n\nWith the increasing frequency of wars between territorial states, there was the need to establish permanent border defences, not just to ward off troops from other regional states, but also raiding parties of the northern tribes. The most famous of these Warring States-period walls were the \"huge defences\" (jufang å·¨é²) of Qi, the \"square wall\" (fangcheng æ¹å) of Chu, the \"moat of River Luo\" (qianluo å¡¹æ´) of Qin, and the northern wall of the state of Yan.\n\nQi began to build walls in the mid-6th century and finalized it before 300 BCE. The southern wall was built to ward off armies of Chu and was built on the hills of the Taishan æ³°å±±, Yishan æ²å±±, Lushan é­¯å±±, and Lingshan éå±± ranges, and the western wall, built on the eastern banks of River Ji æ¿æ°´, was to prohibit invasions from Han, Wei, or Zhao. Part of this wall can be seen at Mulingguan ç©éµé (close to Linshui æ²æ°´, Shandong). The walls were made of pounded earth or stones, had a width of 8-10m at the base, and a height of 4m (Zhongguo shehui kexue yuan kaogu yanjiusuo 2014: 272).\n\nThe walls of Chu were in the north, aimed at defence against Qin, Han, Wei, and Qi, and were built in a region that was the main target of territorial ambitions in the Central Plain, corresponding to the Nanyang Basin åé½çå° in southwest Henan and northern Hubei. It ran along the ridges of Mt. Funiu ä¼çå±±, Mt. Tongbo æ¡æå±±, and beyond Mt. Wudang æ­¦ç¶å±±. Parts of it can be seen in Daguankou å¤§éå£ near Fangcheng æ¹å, Henan, where the vestiges of seven elevated terraces (tai èº) are preserved, as well as signal towers (fenghuotai ç½ç«èº). The base is 12m at the widest point, and the height ranges between 1.5 and 3 m.\n\nQin began around 400 to build a defensive wall along the western banks of River Luo, in order to impede Wei from further westward expansion. Remains of the pounded-earth wall are found close to Pucheng è²å, Shaanxi. Another wall runs from the slopes of Mt. Huashan è¯å±± westwards to the banks of River Wei æ¸­æ°´. This wall was perhaps used by both Qin and Wei.\n\nThe precursor of the famous northern \"Great Wall\" (changcheng é·å) date back to 271 BCE and served against the Yiqu tribes ç¾©æ¸ . It began in Lintao è¨æ´® and ended far north as in Ordos Qota (E'erduosi éç¾å¤æ¯) in Inner Mongolia, with a total length of 2,000km. In some places, the wall is 3m-high, and some ruins of signal towers, gates (chengzhang åé), watchtowers (chengdun åå¢©), and garrisons (gucheng å¤å) are preserved.\n\nThe opponent of Qin, Wei, also constructed walls in the west, with a length of about 200km. At Huayin è¯é°, the ruins are in some places as high as 18m, and in Dali å¤§è, up to 11.4m. This part of the wall was equipped with moats, fortifications (chengbao åå ¡), and signal towers. A southern wall of Wei was erected close to the capital Daliang å¤§æ¢ (Kaifeng, Henan). Ruins are found close to Zhengzhou é­å· and Mixian å¯ç¸£, where the walls were built of limestone (qingshi éç³).\n\nThe state of Zhao, threatened by raids of the Linhu æè¡ and Loufan æ¨ç © tribes, built a wall running from the northern bent of the Yellow River (area of Urat Front Banner çæç¹åæ, Inner Mongolia) through the province of Shanxi and into the western parts of Hebei (area of Wanquan è¬å ¨ and Zhangbei å¼µå). The exact course cannot be determined, but some parts are preserved.\n\nDuring the early Warring States period, the state of Yan built a wall along River Yi ææ°´ between the Taihang Range å¤ªè¡å±± and Dacheng å¤§å, Hebei. About 9km of this pounded-earth wall are preserved in Xushui å¾æ°´. The individual layers of the 7m-high wall are visible. After general Qin Kai ç§¦é had vanquished the Eastern Hu tribes æ±è¡, a wall was built in the north and northeast. Its course was close to that of the famous Qin-period wall, running from Zhangjiakou å¼µå®¶å£, Hebei, to Fuxin éæ°, Liaoning, and quite probably farther east. Ruins were discovered between Xinbin æ°è³ and Dandong ä¸¹æ± (at the border to North Korea), as well as fortified gates.\n\nIf the regional states were in fact military posts, they were joined by military roads supervised by special officials like the supervisor of frontier entries (siguan å¸é) or the director of defence works (sixian å¸éª). Like almost everything, the Zhouli also regulated the track width of various types of roads, from jing å¾ (path) to zhen ç (between fields), tu æ¶ (on ditches), dao é (on dykes), and lu è·¯ (along rivers). The latter corresponded to military roads. A standard track width for chariots was 8 chi.\n\nSignal fire\n\nSignal fire (fengsui ç½ç§) was used as a means of quick communication between the king's residence and that of the regional rulers. The most famous story of Western Zhou signal fire is the abuse of this institution by King You's å¨å¹½ç (r. 781-771) consort Bao Si è¤å§ which led to the loss of the western capital and the downfall of the Western Zhou.\n\nSignals and insignia\n\nArmies were guided in battle by the use of signal banners and drums and bells. There was a wide range of banners for different uses and with different decorations, as can be seen in the existence of a special radical for banners (ã«). Taichang å¤ªå¸¸ (dapei å¤§æ, ornated with sun and moon) was an important banner signalling the presence of the king. The regional rulers used the qi æ banner ornated with chime-bells, ministers-commander zhan æ (also written æ) banners, and grand masters wu ç© banners. Larger settlements were recognizable by a qi æ banner, \"villages\" (zhouli å·é) by yu æ banners, and \"townships\" (xianbi ç¸£é) by zhao æ banners. War chariots (daoche éè») were carrying sui æ banners, hunting chariots (youche æ¿è») jing æ signals, which consisted of an ox tail (mao æ) or of a streamer (liu æ).\n\nThe various ranks of nobility were accompanied by different drums, as the chapter Dasima in the Zhouli explains: the king had a large lugu è·¯é¼ drum with four faces, the regional rulers bengu è³é¼ drums with two membranes, generals (jiangjun å°è») jingu æé¼ drums with two membranes, but larger and shorter than a bengu drum, a regimental commander (shishuai) a hand drum (ti æ), and a battalion commander (lÃ¼shuai) a small pi é¼ drum.\n\nThe beating of drums was directed by bells. Chun é bells were used to \"harmonize the drums\" (he gu åé¼), zhuo é² bells to mark the rhythm (jie gu ç¯é¼), nao é bells to stop the drums (zhi gu æ­¢é¼), and duo é¸ bells to \"pervade the drums\" (tong gu éé¼) (Zhouli, part Diguan, ch. Guren é¼äºº).\n\nA relatively detailed description of the interaction between bells, drums, and banners during the winter training is found in the Zhouli chapter Da sima. It was important to keep the battle line, and therefore training also pertained to marching (xing è¡), running (zou èµ°), setting off (qi å), stopping (zhi æ­¢), and retreating (tui é) as reactions to the signals. Similar statements are found in the military classics Simafa and Weiliaozi.\n\nQuotation 2.

When the signal is given [the troops] stop and rest as in the beginning.\n\nTranslation according to Biot 1851, Vol. 2, 177-178.\n\nThe book Weiliaozi (ch. Lezu ling ååä»¤) explains that drums ordered advancement, double drums attack, bells ordered to stop, double bells to withdraw, and chimes (ling) transmitted orders. Banners were used to indicate the direction of formations.\n\nReward and punishment\n\nOne of the core principles of legalist statehood was \"reward and punishment\" (shang fa è³ç½°). A general had thus to make clear not only his commands, but to announce that the braves would be rewarded and the cowards be punished (Sunzi, ch. Shiji å§è¨). Such methods were not only applied in the state of Qin, but also in others. Daredevils of the state of Qi capturing the head of an enemy were rewarded with one zi é¿ (8 ounces) of gold. The state of Zhao rewarded those having captured a general with 100 pieces of gold. After having crushed the army of Qi, general Yue Yi of Yan was welcomed by the king of Yan out in the field, was hosted and given the title of Lord of Chang æåå.\n\nThe most complete system of reward was drafted by Shang Yang in the state of Qin. The reward depended on the rank of a captured enemy. For presenting the head of an officer (jue shou yi ji çµé¦ä¸ç´), the hero was given one rank of honour (ci jue yi ji è³çµä¸ç´, called gongshi å ¬å£«), according to a graded system. The deed was furthermore rewarded by a grant of 1 qing é  (see weights and measures) of arable land and 9 mu ç of land for buildings, and a servant who took over corvÃ©e duties. Finally, the hero was made an officer (Shangjunshu, ch. 19 Jingnei å¢å §). Apart from individual rewards, there were also collective rewards, mainly for troops storming a city. If a team of 18 troops killed 5 enemies, each of them was granted one rank of honour. There were in total 20 ranks of honour, the highest of which corresponded to a marquis (liehou åä¾¯).\n\nOfficers were rewarded in a different way. Officers who did not directly participate in a mÃªlÃ©e were rewarded according to the success of their company, with one rank of honour for 33 killed enemies. For higher ranks of officers, it became more difficult to attain such honours. After victory, the heads of enemies were laid down for three days and then distributed to the best soldiers, which in turn presented their \"booty\" to the local administration in their home district. Some officers were posthumously honoured by adding a further rank of honour, which was expressed by the number of trees planted around the grave. If a hero was killed on the battlefield, his son was granted the corresponding rank of honour. If one of the two had a criminal record, no reward was given.\n\nThe disciplinary law of the Qin was very harsh and foresaw the application of collective liability. In such a case, for instance, desertion of one person, or false report by one person, the whole squad or platoon was executed. Each soldier was constantly under strict observation by officers. If an officer did not press his men forward in due time, he was dismissed and expelled from the army. When, during a siege and storm, each man of a platoon had died except one, the remaining person was deemed a coward, and punished by mutilation. The spread of fear of the enemy was punished by execution. Wrong command was punished by exile.\n\nNothing is known about the martial law of other states, but it seems that the law of Qin was extremely harsh in comparison, and so contributed to the victory of Qin. As the philosopher Xunzi èå­ (313-238) said, \"Qin's decades-long victories were not due to good luck, but to the numbers [of paragraphs in their military law].\"\n\nWars and generals\n\nWestern Zhou period\n\nWar was seen as a means to tame the unruly ones and \"rectify the regional states\" (zheng bangguo æ­£é¦å). For this reason, the Minister of War applied the \"nine methods of punitive campaign\" (jiu fa zhi fa ä¹ä¼ä¹æ³), as described in the chapter Da sima in the Classic Zhouli. The nine reasons for punitive attacks were if a regional ruler or nobleman had threatened the weak and dishonoured the faint (feng ruo fan gua é¦®å¼±ç¯å¯¡), oppressed the good ones and harmed the people (zei xian hai min è³è³¢å®³æ°), was cruel in his jurisdiction and transgressed the borders of it (bao nei ling wai æ´å §éµå¤), neglected agriculture and made the people flee (ye huang min san éèæ°æ£), relied on force and discarded obeisance (fu gu bu fu è² åºä¸æ), mistreated or killed parents (zei sha qi qin è³æ®ºå ¶è¦ª), murdered a lord (fang shi qi jun æ¾å¼å ¶å), disobeyed orders and betrayed the government (fan ling ling zheng ç¯ä»¤éµæ¿), and created much disorder everywhere with the conduct of wild beasts (wai-nei luan niao-shou xing å¤å §äºï¼é³¥ç¸è¡).\n\nThe victory over the Shang was achieved in the battle of Muye ç§é, which is located close to present-day Xinxiang æ°é, Henan. The year of the war is unknown, even after many attempts to clarify it with the help of astronomical data mentioned in various sources (for instance, 1027 or 1046 BCE). The Zhou army consisted of a mixture of several allies, namely Yong åº¸, Shu è, Qiang ç¾, Wu é«³, Wei å¾®, Lu ç§, Peng å½­, and Pu æ¿®, and surprised the allegedly 70,000-strong army of the Shang king Zhou ç´, who fled and burnt himself in his palace. The history book Shiji å²è¨ (ch. Zhou benji å¨æ¬ç´) holds that King Wu's forces consisted of 300 rongche æè» chariots, 3,000 huben troops, and 45,000 jiashi, while his allies contributed 4,000 troops more. The defeat of a much stronger enemy might have been due to the larger number of chariots the Zhou used (Shaughnessy 1988: 228-229).\n\nThe most famous general participating in the battle was LÃ¼ Shang åå° (Jiang Ziya å§å­ç), who was appointed regional ruler of Qi in the far east. The battle against the Shang is mentioned in the inscription of the Li gui å©ç° bronze vessel. The owner of the vessel apparently also took part in the battle.\n\nQuotation 3. The victory of the Shang according to the Li gui å©ç° inscription ç·(=æ­¦ç)å¾åé¹(=å¯)ç²å­æãæ­²é¼(=è²orå®)ãå æ(=è)å¤(=å·©)å(=æ)åãè¾æªçæ(=å¨)é(?)å¸«ãæ(=è³)å(=å³)åå©éãç¨ä¹(=ä½)è¦å ¬å¯¶å°å½ã When King Wu å¨æ­¦ç rectified (i.e. defeated) Shang, it was on jiazi day (see calendar) at dawn. Jupiter was correctly in a favourable position. Accordingly, we were able to learn of the securing of Shang. On xinwei day, the King was at Jian é (?) garrison; he bestowed on me, Li å©, Scribe of the Right (youli å³å), bronze used to cast for my honoured forebear Tan è¦ this precious ritual vessel.\n\nTranslation: Cook & Goldin 2016: 11.\n\nAfter King Wu's å¨æ­¦ç victory of the Shang, he divided their territory in three parts and appointed the Shang prince Wu Geng æ­¦åº and his own brothers Guan Shu ç®¡å and Cai Shu è¡å as regional rulers. Yet after King Wu's death, Wu Geng rose in rebellion, along with the lords of some other states. The rebellion was motivated by Guan Shu's suspicion that the Duke of Zhou, regent for King Cheng å¨æç, tried to usurp the throne. The Duke of Zhou initiated a military campaign that first wiped out Wu Geng, killed then his half-brother Guan Shu, and arrested Cai Shu. He then thrusted eastwards and pacified the Nine Yi tribes ä¹å¤· in the Huai River æ·®æ²³ region which had supported the rebels. The surviving members of the Shang aristocracy were resettled to Chengzhou for better control.\n\nSeveral decades later, King Cheng himself pacified the Nine Yi once more, along with the state of Yan å¥. King Kang's å¨åº·ç campaign against the northern Guifang é¬¼æ¹ in the late 10th century is mentioned in the inscription of the Xiao Yu ding å°çé¼.\n\nDuring the reign of King Zhao å¨æ­ç, the southern border was unstable. He therefore decided to pacify the region of Chu æ¥ and Jing è and the tribes of the Baipu ç¾æ¿® and Man è ». Yet the royal army was caught in a surprise attack close to River Han æ¼¢æ°´, and King Zhao died in the floods when trying to escape.\n\nHis son, King Mu å¨ç©ç, appeased the Western Quanrong ç¬æ and forced them to move to what is today northern Shanxi, but was not able to suppress their martial spirit. Legend says that the King continued his march to the west and reached the Kunlun Range å´å´ where he met the Queen Mother of the West è¥¿çæ¯ (see the story Mu Tianzi zhuan ç©å¤©å­å³). Even if this story is beyond credibility, it demonstrates that Chinese interest in the western territories slowly increased.\n\nDuring the reign of King Yi å¨æ¿ç, the Quanrong became strong again and even invaded the metropolitan region. The king was forced to abandon his residence in Hao é¬ and founded a new one in Quanqiu ç¬ä¸ (Huaili æ§é, today's Xinping èå¹³, Shaanxi). The Duke of Shen ç³ was more successful in his war against the Quanrong. His victory was crowned by the Duke of Guo's è¢ defeat of the Quanrong in the battle of Yuquan ä¿æ³ somewhere in northern Shanxi. During the reign of King Li, the Quanrong (then called Xianyun) plundered the royal residence once more, so that the king decided to increase his army. He was indeed able to defeat the wild tribes several times and also freed some captured Zhou people.\n\nThe southeastern tribes of the Huaiyi also remained a source of permanent troubles. Under the command of the Marquis of E å©, King Yi's å¨å¤·ç army conquered several statelets in the Huai River region. Yet peace did not prevail for long, and rebellious Yi advanced as far west as Luoyang. With supreme power, King Li was able to pacify the region.\n\nInternal quarrels in the house of Zhou forced King Li to flee to Zhi å½ (today's Huoxian éç¸£, Shanxi), where he died. His son, King Xuan å¨å®£ç (r. 828-782 BCE), relaxed the involvement of the Zhou into regional affairs. In 824, the Xianyun once more invaded the metropolitan region and killed Qin Zhong ç§¦ä»², the lord of Qin. With strong contingents of chariots, Yin Ji å°¹å repelled the invaders, and Nan Zhong åä»² drove them farther away. King Xuan entrusted Qin Zhong's sons with the protection of the metropolitan region to the west, and thus created the regional state of Qin.\n\nJizi Bai å­£å­ç½, lord of Guo, heavily defeated the Xianyun in 823. When the danger from the northwest seemed to be settled, King Xuan ordered Fang Shu Gua æ¹åæ to command 3,000 chariots to crush the state of Chu in the middle Yangtze Region. The southeastern tribes under the leadership of the king of Xu å¾ were finally appeased by the royal army under the command of minister Nan Zhong and Grand Commander Huangfu å¤§å¸«çç¶.\n\nQuotation 4.

He severed five hundred heads and arrested fifty prisoners, and in this he was first. Valiant Zi Bai presented the severed ears to the King. The King greatly praised Zi Bai's uprightness The King went to the Grand Pavilion (Xuanxie å®£æ¦­) of the Zhou temple and then held a banquet [...]\n\nTranslation: Cook & Goldin 2016: 189, slightly changed.\n\nThe campaign is also mentioned in the Shijing, Part Daya, ode Changwu å¸¸æ­¦ \"Everlasting Martiality\".\n\nThese great victories led to a period of peace, even if King Xuan continued to wage wars against dispersed groups of Rong tribes in the north. In one of these campaigns, against the Jiangrong å§æ in 790, the army of the lord of Nan å was heavily defeated.\n\nThe downfall of the Western Zhou under King You was caused by a military alliance between the Xianyun, the Marquis of Shen, and the Marquis of Zeng ç¹. The Marquis of Shen had been the father-in-law of King You, but felt insulted when King You discarded his Queen and took a new consort, Bao Si. Even if legend interprets the conquest of the metropolitan region by the Xianyun as the result of a childish game by Bao Si (spoofing the military commanders by having lit the signal fires), the treasonous alliance of part the inner circle of the Zhou court with an outer enemy played a substantial part in the event.\n\nSpring and Autumn period\n\nThe number of military conflicts increased drastically during the Spring and Autumn period. Historians count no less than 376 military encounters during the 295 years of the period. (He 1987: 35). This was possible because of economic growth (see Zhou economy), different modes of recruitment, and better methods of exploiting revenues and resources.\n\nForced to resettle in the eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang, Henan) in 770, the house of Zhou had a royal domain (wangji) of no more than 600km2 (Chen 1994: 29). Nonetheless, the royal court was still respected and possessed considerable military superiority. Yet during the reign of King Ping å¨å¹³ç (r. 770-720 BCE), tensions with the regional state of Zheng to the east grew, and the crown princes of both houses were mutually exchanged as hostages. His successor King Huan å¨æ¡ç (r. 720-697) attempted to replace the house of Zheng as royal ministers by the house of Guo è¢. In this situation, King Huan had to rely on the support of the state of Jin, but in 718, Earl Zhuang of Quwo æ²æ²èä¼¯ (r. 732-717), by then master over Jin, rebelled against the King, who invested Marquis Ai æåä¾¯ (718-710). In 713, Zheng defeated the states of Song, Wei è¡, and Cai in the battle of Dai æ´ (Minquan æ°æ¬, Henan).\n\nIn 708, King Huan dismissed Duke Zhuang of Zheng, and ordered Chen, Cai, and Wei è¡ to attack Zheng, together with the royal army and that of Guo. The armies met in the battle of Xuge, but Zheng defeated the royal alliance. Xuge was the last time a king of Zhou personally commanded a military campaign, and the sign of the end of the military prowess of the Zhou. In the 7th century, the royal domain was cut down by presents of territories to Zheng, Guo, and Jin. Yet the legitimacy of the house of Zhou was not challenged. Many wars of the Spring and Autumn period were led to support the royal house or to act on its behalf.\n\nThe reason to take over the function of lord-protector (\"hegemonial lord\", ba é¸) over the regional rulers was the military strength of the Di and Rong tribes in west and north China, and later that of the southern state of Chu. The motto was \"respect the King and suppress the wild tribes\" (zun wang rang yi å°çæå¤·). In 663, the state of Yan in the north was attacked by the Mountain Rong (Shanrong å±±æ). Duke Huan of Qi was asked for help, and sent an army to the far north. He defeated the Shanrong at Guzhu å­¤ç«¹ (north of Hebei). In 660, Duke Huan helped Duke Dai è¡æ´å ¬ (r. 660) to the throne after the state of Wei è¡ had been devastated by the Di tribes. In 659, he helped the statelet of Xing é¢ against the Di tribes and defeated them with an allied army of Qi, Song, and Wei è¡. In 657, Duke Huan convoked the states at Yanggu é½è°· (Liucheng èå, Shandong) and it was decided to resist the northward advance of Chu. The states of Huang é» and Jiang æ± were rescued. In 646, Duke Huan led an alliance (meng ç) of states to help the statelet of Qi æ against the Huai tribes, and two years later supported the state of Zeng é«.\n\nYet in the end, Duke Huan of Qi was not able to prevent the northward expansion of Chu, and after Chu had conquered the state of Cai, both concluded in 656 the peace treaty of Shaoling å¬éµ (Leihe æ¼¯æ²³, Henan).\n\nThe battle of Chengpu åæ¿® (either today's Chenliu é³ç, Henan, or Juancheng éå, Shandong) in 632 marked the beginning of a hundred-year long conflict between the powers Chu and Jin. Duke Cheng of Song å®æå ¬ (r. 636-620) decided to get rid of the domination by Chu. King Cheng of Chu æ¥æç (r. 672-626) thereupon ordered his allies Chen, Cai, Zheng, and Xu è¨± to attack Song, which in turn asked Duke Wen of Jin ææå ¬ (r. 636-628) for help. Jin, supported by Qi and Qin, overwhelmed the two wings of Chu and forced the invader to retreat. Duke Wen of Jin took over the position of lord-protector which was confirmed in the interstate meeting in Jiantu è¸å (Yuanyang åé½, Henan) in 631.\n\nIn 596, King Zhuang of Chu æ¥èç (r. 613-591) attacked Zheng and forced the earl of Zheng into surrender. The relief forces of Jin hesitated before engaging Chu in the battle of Bi é² (Xingyang æ»é½, Henan), but this time Chu (commanded by the king and Shusun Ao å­«åæ) routed the army of Jin (commanded by Xun Linfu èæç¶, Shi Hui å£«æ, and Zhao Shuo è¶æ).\n\nA phase of dÃ©tente was initiated by Hua Yuan è¯å , a grand master in the state of Chu who had good relationships with dignitaries in Jin and Chu. A conference between the two competitors was held in the capital of Song (Shangqiu åä¸, Henan). Yet the third great battle between the two powers took place in 575 at Yanling é¢éµ (Henan) in marsh terrain unfavourable for Chu, so Luan Shu æ¬æ¸, Han Jue éå¥, and Xi Qi é¤é¡ were able to defeat King Gong of Chu æ¥å ±ç (r. 590-560).\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Dao ææ¼å "
