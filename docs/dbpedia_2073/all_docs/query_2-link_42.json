It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period è¥¿å¨ (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing è. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han æ¼¢ and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period æ¥ç§ (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu æ¥ (11th cent. - 223 BCE)\n\nMap according to Tan Qixiang è°­å ¶éª§ (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji ä¸­å½åå²å°å¾é. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu é¡é , himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor é»å¸. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li éé» was the minister for fire (huo zheng ç«æ­£) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku å¸å³. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong ç¥è. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong å ±å·¥, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui å³å take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu æå¾, Shen Hu åè¡, Peng Zu å½­ç¥, Hui Ren æäºº, Ji Lian å­£é£ and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao æ¹. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong ç or Mi ç¾ (originally written å¬­).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan é . Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's å¨æ­¦ç conquest of the Shang empire å (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou å¨æç (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou å¨æ­ç undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang ç) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi çç¹¹ settled near Mt. Jingshan èå±± (modern Nanzhang åæ¼³, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou è«¸ä¾¯) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang ä¸¹é½ (modern Zigui ç§­æ­¸, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi å­) Xiong Qu çæ¸ became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong åº¸ and Yangyue æç²µ. He made his oldest song Wukang æ¯åº· king of Goutan å¥äº¶, his second son Zhihong æ¯ç´ king of E é, and his youngest son Zhici å·çµ king of Yuezhang è¶ç« . Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang çé his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun å­£å¾ (Xiong Xun çå¾), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao è¡å (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun çç´, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong çé assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu æ¥æ­¦ç (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui é¨, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes ç¾æ¿® south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi çè²² mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen æ¥æç (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying é¢ (near modern Shashi æ²å¸, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi æ¯ (modern Xixian æ¯ç¸£ï¼ Henan), Shen ç³ (modern Nanyang åé½, Henan) and Deng é§ (modern Xiangfan è¥æ¨, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao èæ (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong å®), known as Xiong Jian çå (also written çè±), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun çæ² (also written çé µ), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng æ¥æç (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba é¸) Duke Huan of Qi é½æ¡å ¬ (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng ç) in the conference of Zhaoling å¬éµ (modern Yancheng é¾å, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu è¨±, Xian å¼¦ (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang é» (modern Huanchuan æ½¢å·, Henan) and Ying è±. Duke Xiang of Song å®è¥å ¬ (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song å® and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong æ³ (modern Zhecheng æå, Henan) and also the state of Zheng é­. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu é­¯åå ¬ (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi é½. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen ç³ who conquered the territory of Gu ç©, where Duke Huan's son Yong é was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui å¤ was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin æ. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin ææå ¬ (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu å­ç with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin ä»¤å°¹) Zishang å­ä¸, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen åè£ heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi è·. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu æ¥ç©ç (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong æ½å´. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang æ± (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu å ­ (a special reading, modern Lu'an å ­å®, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen é³.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son LÃ¼ ä¾¶, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang æ¥èç (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju ä¼è thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong èå¾ was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians æ of Luhun é¸æ¸¾, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang æ´é½ (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man çå­«æ»¿. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming å¤©å½) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi é² (near modern Zhengzhou é­å·, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong åº¸ (near modern Zhushan ç«¹å±±, Hubei), later Shu-Liao èè¼ (modern Shucheng èå, Anhui) and Xiao è­ (near modern Xuzhou å¾å·, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu ç³å of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling é¢éµ (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba é¸).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen å¯©, posthumously known as King Gong æ¥å ±ç (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao æ, posthumously known as King Kang æ¥åº·ç (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan å¡, who is also known as Jia'ao éæ (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei å, Zibi å­æ¯, Zixi å­æ³ and Qiji å¼ç¾. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo è« and Pingxia å¹³å¤. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling æ¥éç (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu å³. Qing Feng æ ¶å°, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace ç« è¯èº built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai è¡ in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu å¾, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai è³´ (modern Suizhou é¨å·, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu å¤§å¤«) Xi Fu æç¶ answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi ä¹¾æºª, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong è§å¾, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue è¶, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo å¸¸å£½é had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu ç¥¿. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima å¸é¦¬). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju çå± and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping æ¥å¹³ç (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian å»º, with a princess from Qin ç§¦. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen è»«. Grand Tutor (taifu å¤ªå ) Wu She ä¼å¥¢ and Junior Tutor (shaofu å°å ) Fei Wuji è²»ç¡å¿ intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu ä¼å­è¥, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang å  of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang åæ¢ lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli éé¢ and Juchao å± å·¢. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi å­è¥¿, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao æ¥æ­ç (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang å­å¸¸ took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju æè (modern Macheng éº»å, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng é²å¤¢ and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu ç³é®è¥ was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji ç¨· (modern Tongbai æ¡æ, Henan). Prince Fugai å¤«æ¦, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang å (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun é  (modern Shangshui åæ°´, Henan) and Hu è¡ (modern Fuyang éé½, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King HelÃ¼ éé­ of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince ZilÃ¼ å­é­ conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang ç« . He is posthumously known as King Hui æ¥æ ç (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng å to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai ç½å ¬. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi å­ç¶¦ and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi å¸é¦¬å­æ at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao å­é«, called Duke Ye èå ¬. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi æ.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai æ·®, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong ä¸­, who is posthumously known was King Jian æ¥ç°¡ç (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju è (modern Juxian èç¸£, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi å³èµ·, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue æç²µ, namely the Dongting æ´åº­ (Hunan) and Cangwu è¼æ¢§ (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang ç¶, posthumously known as King Sheng æ¥è²ç (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi ç, posthumously known as King Dao æ¥æ¼ç (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han é, Zhao è¶ and Wei é­, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang è§, posthumously known as King Su æ¥è ç (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu è¯å¤«, who is posthumously known as King Xuan æ¥å®£ç (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang åé .\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang å succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei æ¥å¨ç (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai æ§, posthumously known as King Huai æ¥æ·ç (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen é³è»« dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang æ­é½, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi å¼µå.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin èç§¦, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass å½è°·é, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang ä¸¹é½ in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong æ¼¢ä¸­. At Lantian èç°, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang é³å°, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu é­è¢, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan å±å, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi é½æ¹£ç (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan ç against Qin. Zhao Ju æ­é convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha åæ². A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass æ­¦é. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang å¸é½, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng æ©« to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang æ¥é è¥ç (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao è¶æ æç (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi ç½èµ· massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei æ·®å. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou å¨çèµ§ (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu æ­¦å ¬, to Zhaozi æ­å­, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang æ·®é½, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan çå  (or Wan å®) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie æ¥èçç (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi å·¦å¾), Lord Chunshen æ¥ç³å, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang å·¨é½ (modern Taihe å¤ªå, Anhui), later to to Shouchun å£½æ¥ (modern Shouxian å£½ç¸£, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling ä¿¡éµå of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao æ (or Yu ç ), who is posthumously known as King You æ¥å¹½ç (r. 238-228). Li Yuan æå, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You ç¶ (or Hao é), who is posthumously known as King Ai æ¥åç (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu è² è» (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian çç¿¦ defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan é ç, a great uncle of Xiang Yu é ç¾½, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang é¸ç) of West Chu è¥¿æ¥. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu èæ­¦ seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo åå) in the 10th century.\n\nTable 1.
