        "text": "As an imperial graduate, Huang Tingjian also served in the government and involved himself in various political activities. His most important achievements lay in poetry, and he attached great importance to reading and check the source of material. As he once said, \"Every character has its origin.\"\n\nHe was the initiator of the Jiangxi school of poetry, which had significant influence on later Practitioners. Though best known for his achievements in poetry, he was also a great calligrapher, highly skilled inxingshuandcaoshu.\n\nHuang first studied calligraphy under Zhou Yue, and later learned much from the calligraphic works of Yan Zhenqing, Yang Ningshi and Zhang Xu. He developed his own style -- robust, open and vigorous.\n\nHis most acclaimed handwritings have survived the challenge of time, and include Pine WindPavilion, Fragrance of Flower, and so on.\n\nMi Fu\n\nMi Fu, also named Mi Yuanzhang, was born in Taiyuang ofShanxi Provinceand later took residence inZhenjiangofJiangsu Province. Due to his eccentric disposition and crazy behavior, he was given the name of Mi Dian (Crazy Mi). For example, he would adore every stone he came upon, calling it brother. Boasting proficiency in poetry, painting, calligraphy, collection and authentication, Mi Fu was given the title of a poet, painter, calligrapher, collector and connoisseur."
