He is best known for his calligraphy, and he was regarded as one of the four greatest calligraphers in Song Dynasty. His style arises from that of calligraphers in earlier dynasties, but with a unique mark of his own. To Mi Fu the brush was not only the sword of his proud spirit but a magic stick, which brought life whenever he held it in his hands, were it in writing or in painting. The two arts were to him essentially one and the same.\n\nRemarks: the piece was returned from Japan.\n\nHuang Tingjian Calligraphy Scroll – Di Zhu Ming from Song Dynasty\n\nSize：Handwriting 37.6 X 824cm; Preface and Postscript 37.6 X 621cm\n\nAuction Price：RMB436,000,000\n\nAuction Company：Poly International ‘s Beijing Spring Auction\n\nAuction Date：2010-06-03\n\nLiterature：\n\nHuang Tingjian (Chinese: 黄庭堅) (1045–1105) was a Chinese artist. He is predominantly known as a calligrapher, but was also admired for his painting and poetry. He was one of the Four masters of the Song Dynasty, and who created a new style of his own. He was a master for the size and spacing of his characters as well as for a style that was very fluid. Previous calligraphers had generally kept to recognized styles, keeping their characters in regular shapes. But Huang broke from that tradition with brush strokes that flow, almost with a flourish, out of an informal square as if escaping from a cage.\n\nThe masterpiece, titled Di Zhu Ming, features a calligraphic representation of an epigraph originally composed by Wei Zheng, a famous Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) chancellor. The handscroll is considered to demonstrate the creativity of Huang's penmanship and his moral principle.\n\nThe item is also adorned with Huang's portrait and valuable inscriptions of several dynasties ranging from Song to Qing (1644-1911), stretching the calligraphy work to 15 meters in total.\n\nThe Copy of Wang Xizhi Calligraphy Scroll\n\nPing’an Tie (Safty Wish Script)\n\nSize：24.5 X 13.8cm\n\nAuction Price：RMB308,000,000\n\nAuction Company：China Guardian Autumn Auction in Beijing\n\nAuction Date：20-11-2010\n\nLiterature：\n\nThe scroll on silk with four lines of characters is a copy of ancient Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi's work. Wang is a Jin dynasty figure who is known as the Sage of Calligraphy. However, none of his works are known to have survived. The script copy formerly constituted nine lines of characters. But it was torn into two parts, and the 24.5-cm-long, 13.8-cm-wide piece that was sold at this auction is the first part with four lines composing 41 characters.\n\nZhang Zhao\n\nQING DYNASTY, QIANLONG PERIOD, EARLY 18TH CENTURY\n\n'SHI GU GE' BY HAN YU IN CURSIVE SCRIPT\n\nSize: 1203 X 56cm\n\nValuation: HKD15,000,000 – 25,000,000\n\nAuction Price: HKD90,260,000\n\nAuction Company: Sothebys Hong Kong Auction\n\nAuction Date: 07-10-2010\n\nLiterature:\n\n‘Shi Gu Ge’ By Han Yu in Cursive Script handscroll, ink on gold-flecked paper with a silk brocade wrapper, signed Zhang Zhao with three seals of the artist, an Imperial frontispiece by the Qianlong Emperor entitled Gui ci shen bi (‘ A Magnificent Verse Written with a Divine Brush’), dated the gengxu year corresponding to 1790, with 33 seals of the Qianlong Emperor, and one seal by the Xuantong Emperor.\n\nZhao Mengfu Calligraphy Scroll\n\nCursive Handwriting - The Tale of The Goddess of Luo River（17 Pages, written on 1301）\n\nSize：23 X 11.5cm X 18\n\nArtwork Material：Chinese Ink and Silk Scroll\n\nDynasty：Yuan Dynasty（1301）\n\nValuation：RMB30,000,000\n\nAuction Price：RMB80,080,000\n\nAuction Company：China Guardian Autumn Auction in Beijing\n\nAuction Date：2010-11-21\n\nLiterature：\n\nZhao Mengfu（1254—1322）, courtesy name Ziang, pseudonyms Xuesong (means “ Pine Snow”), and Xuesong Dao-ren (means “Master of the Pine Snow).\n\nAlong with three other famous calligraphers, Ouyang Xun, Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan, he was regarded as one of the Four Great Calligraphers of regular script. He was talented and knowledgeable. He was good at poetry, economics, calligraphy, painting, inscription, and playing bamboo pipes. He was also capable of judging. Among all these talents, calligraphy and painting were his best. He had created a new painting style for the Yuan Dynasty. Zhao was adept in many styles of calligraphy, such as seal character, official script, running script and the cursive hand, and he also created his own style, Zhaoti. His works were all filled a touch of nobility and elegance, an embodiment of his in-depth knowledge and cultivation."
