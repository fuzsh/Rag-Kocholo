        "text": "Nakabayashi Chikuto\n\nJapanese, 1776-1853\n\nLandscape in the Manner of Mi Fu\n\nAbout 1850, Edo period\n\nInk on paper\n\nAsian Art Association funds in honor of Ronald Otsuka\n\n2014.171\n\nIn this landscape painting, Nakabayashi Chikuto uses short, horizontal brushstrokes referred to as \"Mi dots\" to form the mountains and trees of his composition. The term acknowledges a painting technique associated with the Chinese painter Mi Fu. In his writings, Chikuto advocates fidelity to earlier Chinese styles and denounces the naturalism and realism favored by other Japanese painters of his time."
