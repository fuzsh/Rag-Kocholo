A bored English aristocrat, Joan Fontaine, leaves her lascivious nobleman husband (Ralph Forbes) for her family home in Cornwall, and takes her children. There she encounters pirates at a nearby creek and falls in love with the romantic French pirate, called The Frenchman, (Arturo de Cordova). Impulsively she joins the pirates on a raid of neighbor’s (Nigel Bruce) home and then returns home. The nobles join forces to capture the pirate, but she frees him. In the climax, Fontaine must chose to be with either her family or live a life of adventure with her pirate lover.\n\nThe colorful adventure features plenty of old-fashioned thrills. It also acts as a feminist escapist fantasy film.\n\nREVIEWED ON 3/25/2016 GRADE: B-\n\nDennis Schwartz: “Ozus’ World Movie Reviews”"
