        "text": "Editor's Week 2001\n\nDecember 19 - 2001\n\n[Sculptor, and Hitchcock devotee, Robert Schoen, author of the 'screenplay' called 'Hitch & Alma', concludes his thoughts about appearing on television alongside Hitchcock's daughter.]\n\nOne of the main inspirations for writing 'Hitch & Alma' was the poignant 1952 photo of Alma by Samson Raphaelson. She sits on a sofa before a luminous glass of juice, her tightly drawn face framed by her disheveled hair as she stares intently into the camera through her steel rimmed glasses, looking very much like a Hitchcock protagonist (or victim, for that matter.) For me, this Kafkaesque portrait speaks volumes about the extent of Alma's true involvement in her husband's vision. After my interview, I made a symbolic pilgrimage to the couple's Bel Air residence. I drove up the nearby hills and through the grand arched entrance of Bel Air itself, then along curving, manicured Belaggio Road, finally arriving before the nearly hidden gate leading to the surprisingly small cottage that was the setting for much of my screenplay/novel. Just being there, you could almost feel Hitchcock's presence. I have no idea what reaction, if any, Ms Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell had to my book. I sent her one of the first copies, but never heard back from her. So it will be interesting, to say the least, to see how our respective interviews for TV Ontario look when aired together. But I am certain, as I expressed in my interview, that Ms O'Connell is certainly entitled to the definitive last word on what went on in the Hitchcock home, and the obvious professional and private accord that existed between her parents. I hope she follows through with her stated intent to write a biography on her mother, Alma Reville Hitchcock. It would be a tremendous contribution to our understanding of the other half responsible for the Hitchcock legacy.\n\nDecember 18 - 2001\n\n[Interviewed for TV, Robert Schoen modified his earlier views on Hitchcock's relations with his leading ladies ...]\n\nAs I arrived at the Los Angeles Hotel's 'W' suite, where I was sat before the hot lights for my interview, little did I know that my recorded observations would be spliced next to those of the daughter of someone whom I had admired and studied for most of my life. Worse, that my comments might form a debate with this daughter over the morality of a man for whom I have nothing but admiration and respect. In other words, who was I to expound publicly on the private life of a man I had never met, effectively pitting my views against those of his loyal and only daughter? Thinking about my comments later, I felt as though I were reprising Doreen Lang's role of the accuser in The Wrong Man! And yet, was my point of view about Hitch and Alma as a couple, and stated in my book, really all that different from Ms. O'Connell's? I explained to the interviewer that the theme of the book (which I have always described as fictional) was to show how the Hitchcocks functioned as a professional couple who shared a mutual vision, which the director ultimately brought to the screen. As the 'MacGuffin' in my novel/screenplay, the director's secret longings for his leading ladies are expressed in a series of outtakes from his most famous films that he keeps locked away from Alma's prying eyes in the private screening room of their home. But Alma knows where the key to the room is hidden and all about her husband's fantasies, which she grudgingly accepts as part of his artistic process! However, since the publication of my book four years ago, I've developed a new hypothesis about Hitchcock's involvement with his leading ladies, which I expressed for the first time during the TVOntario interview. It occurred to me that Hitchcock, always the master of self-promotion, might have been trying to create for himself the public persona of a ladies' man, just to garner publicity for his films. In his role as producer, the bottom line to any film project was its financial return, and the press back then (as now) ate up any rumors of romance behind the cameras. Think of that staged photo of Grace Kelly in massive hooped gold gown trimming Hitch's hair during To Catch a Thief. Or Hitch's comments to screenwriter David Freeman about how Ingrid Bergman was 'constantly throwing herself at me.' Like a studio publicist, Hitchcock was known to frequently make up anecdotes about his leading ladies to illustrate a point or to publicize a movie. There is the often repeated story of how during the shooting of Vertigo he constantly shot take after take of Kim Novak plunging into San Francisco Bay. Then there's the story of how Hitch came to have a belated respect for Novak's acting ability after she showed up late for a dinner at his home claiming to have had a car breakdown. According to Hitchcock, she appeared at the door wearing a carefully placed grease smudge on her perfectly made-up face and a symbolic single hair out of place, just like a true movie star. If Hitchcock were capable of fabricating such white lies about a leading lady who was not quite his type, wouldn't he also be capable of exaggerating his interest in those who were his type?\n\nDecember 17 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. This week, sculptor and author Robert Schoen, whose 'screenplay' called 'Hitch and Alma' deals in somewhat bizarre and surreal fashion with Alfred Hitchcock's relations with the women in his life - his wife, his daughter, and several of his leading ladies - considers further the subject of his book, in particular Alma Hitchcock, née Reville.]\n\nTV Ontario's 'Saturday Night at the Movies', Canada's most watched television program, airs a weekly double feature of some of the finest films ever made, along with an original interview segment related to the films. For five years running, TV Ontario has hosted an annual Hitchcock double feature, and in the past they have interviewed many well-known Hitchcock actors, writers, biographers, and film authorities. As the author of 'Hitch & Alma', I was somewhat surprised and honored to be invited to Los Angeles this summer to be interviewed for this year's TVOntario's Hitchcock segment. Assuming that I would be one of many authors who would participate, I learnt that the only other interviewee that was scheduled to be taped for the Hitchcock program was Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell herself. Knowing how assertive Ms. O'Connell had been during the Hitchcock Centennial in defending her father's reputation against the long-published assertions that he had secret obsessions with his leading ladies, this put me in the awkward position of having to debate Hitchcock's daughter apropos one of the principal themes of my own book! Like Michelangelo or Picasso, Hitchcock is one of those artists whose personality is as fascinating as the art he created. The biographies of such men are essential reading to fully appreciate both their accomplishments and the recurring psychological themes found in their works. It is for this reason I have long admired Donald Spoto's masterful Hitchcock biography, 'The Dark Side of Genius'. Heroic in its scope and breath, it courageously attempts to link Hitchcock's life to his art. Yet this book was roundly attacked by Ms. O'Connell and others as both mean-spirited and inaccurate about Spoto's allegations concerning Hitchcock's attentions to Tippi Hedren and other actresses. While I felt Spoto's respect for his subject throughout was obvious, my one major reservation with the book, which I have read several times and refer back to constantly, was that it seemed to short-change Alma's role in both Hitchcock's life and art. Another of the book's glaring omissions, considering the importance of the recurring 'Mother' theme that runs through Hitchcock's oeuvre, concerned how Spoto did not adequately address in his book what elements in Hitchcock's life might have colored such a hostile portrayal of motherhood. In 1996, with the encouragement of Twelve Monkeys producer Robert Kosberg, I began to write a screenplay on Hitchcock's life in which I would try to construct a movie, not so much in the style of Hitchcock, as one that explored Hitchcockian themes such as shared guilt, the double life, and the profound sacrifices one makes out of love. Hitchcock's fascination with Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, or Tippi Hedren is nowhere as interesting as his complex love affair with his wife Alma. More tomorrow.\n\nDecember 11 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. Today's 'guest editor', like Thomas Leitch yesterday, teaches in the English Department of an American university: Dennis Perry, of Brigham Young University, Utah, is preparing a comparative study of Edgar Allan Poe's literary works and Hitchcock's films. The book will be published by Scarecrow Press in 2003. Here, in addressing a certain disparity between surface and event in The Birds (1963), Professor Perry seeks to raise our awareness of the humorous elements that contribute to an 'aesthetics of horror' governing that film.]\n\nIn doing the literature survey for a chapter of my book on the aesthetic relationship between Poe and Hitchcock, I was surprised to note how many critics see only the dark side of The Birds. While many critics hover over the problems associated with establishing a coherent reading of the film at all, an even greater number of scholars, particularly those ideologically committed to current social/critical theories, stress the dark ironies of a pathological film about Oedipal tensions, female punishment, male triumph, or homosexual assault. Partly as a result of my comparing the film to its sister Poe tale, \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" which is so much darker in its fatal conclusion, The Birds seems to cry out for a lighter reading to balance the critical scales. While I haven't space here to offer a definitive revision of the prevailing wisdom on the film, I will offer a few hints from which such a reading could be developed (and will be in my book). Briefly, then, I see at least three reasons for a more optimistic reading of the film: 1) its humor, 2) Cathy and her love birds, and 3) its apocalyptic imagery in relation to its 'ending.' First, in terms of its humor, besides the often noticed light romantic comic feel of the first part of the film, there are the raft of comic actors and funny characters leavening the graphic horror: Ruth McDevitt (the flustered bird shop owner), Richard Deacon (the man in the elevator), John McGovern (the perplexed Brinkmeyer), and Doodles Weaver (the shocked boat rental man). These are faces most often seen in television comedies and Disney movies and seem to offer reassurance that, after all, 'its only a movie.' Another source of humor is Hitchcock's comic reduction of his own suspense techniques (such as during Melanie's delivery of the birds in her absurdly vain way). One other strange manifestation of humor comes in the sometimes visually funny attacks themselves: the girl at Cathy's party kicking her legs mechanically under the fence with a bird on her neck (in fact, the entire party sequence , viewed with sound off, is incredibly artificial and funny), the jump cuts of Melanie watching the fire trail from the window, and Melanie's blind flailing at birds that are not there near the end. These scenes are Hitchcock's innovation in the aesthetics of horror - comic relief during horrific violence. Second, in many ways Cathy and her love birds are the invisible center of the film, bringing all of the characters together and helping to redeem Melanie by continually insisting on her presence (both consciously at the party and unconsciously 'willing' her to bring the love birds to Bodega Bay). Despite the obvious ambiguities (Camille Paglia wants to slap her and Robin Wood finds Cathy's characterization banal and awkward), Cathy is a powerful attractive force that eventually counteracts the chaotic violence of the birds. Finally, in my comparing The Birds to Poe's \"Masque\" as apocalyptic stories, the score of biblical references to fire, smoke, darkness, birds, plague, and the magic number seven (Poe's seven rooms and Hitchcock's seven major bird attacks which we witness) both link and separate the narratives. Poe's is an apocalypse with little hint of redemption - a darkly ironic reversal of its biblical imagery, presenting the catastrophe of global annihilation. However, Hitchcock's apocalypse more conventionally promises a millennial dawn - complete with optimistic shaft of light as hopeful goal for the now united Brenner party. To say, as Donald Spoto has, that the film 'simply stops,' is to ignore the subdued birds, Melanie and Lydia's subtle but significant reconciliation, and the talisman love birds that will seemingly continue to protect this group of people who have overcome complacent prejudice and neurotic clinging. And all of this is not to mention the two darker endings (Hunter's original ending and the obviously tempting Golden Gate Bridge shot) Hitchcock rejected. My conclusion is simply that despite its ambiguities and dissonances, there are far too many hopeful - and downright funny - elements in The Birds to ignore them and still claim to have captured the essence of Hitchcock or the film.\n\nDecember 10 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. Moving back into the chair of 'guest editor' tonight - he has already given us his review of the book 'The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion' - is Thomas Leitch, author of 'Find the Director - and Other Hitchcock Games', who teaches in the English Department at the University of Delaware. Professor Leitch is writing 'The Alfred Hitchcock Encyclopedia', to be published by Facts on File. Here he reviews the book by Peter Conrad, 'The Hitchcock Murders', which has just come out in paperback in the UK.]\n\nBy my informal count, Peter Conrads 'The Hitchcock Murders' (Faber and Faber, hb and pb) is the 66th book on Hitchcock to appear in English, and its single most remarkable feature is how little use it has for the other 65. Conrad, an Oxford historian of literature and culture whose many other books have often treated their scholarly progenitors with similar indifference, makes no bones about his impatience with academic criticism that uses Hitchcocks films to advance ideological agendas, overlooking how 'deliriously beautiful and achingly sad' Vertigo is in order to note its sexism, its attacks on the construction of masculinity, or its cinematic self-reflexiveness. It gradually becomes clear that Conrad has done his homework. He is armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of Hitchcocks literary sources, and he usefully draws attention to discrepancies between the transcripts of François Truffauts interviews with Hitchcock and the edited version that found its way into print. Even so, reading him is a bit like paying the proprietor of a private shrine for admittance to the sacred mysteries. Conrads Hitchcock is very much his own, introduced by his autobiographical reminiscence of sneaking into Psycho as a child of 13 and proceeding through what seem to be successive unmaskings of the director as a master of The Art of Murder, The Technique of Murder, and The Religion of Murder. Although the air of penetration to a thematic core - the unholy fascination with the taboos of death, mystery and the macabre Hitchcock managed more successfully than any Establishment artists of his century to communicate to the public - turns out to be largely illusory, Conrad is never less than an entertaining and well-informed guide to the films, which he tours with insouciant arbitrariness. Like God, Hitchcock arranged miracles in The 39 Steps, Shadow of a Doubt, and The Wrong Man. His technical tricks - the dream sequence of Spellbound, the long takes of Rope, the red suffusions in Marnie - invariably correspond to neurotic quirks that 'force us to share his surrealized vision of the world.' His facetious remark to Truffaut, 'I practice absurdity quite religiously,' was philosophically rigorous and literally true. Trying to follow Conrads larger argument is like driving down Broadway and hitting every red light for ten miles. But his gift for writing a nonstop series of provocative paragraphs may make 'The Hitchcock Murders' the one book on Hitchcock youd most want to take to a desert island - especially if, like Conrad, you were willing to dispense with all the others.\n\nDecember 6 - 2001\n\n[In his final report on the scripting, production, and post-production of Suspicion, Bill Krohn reveals a further mystery about the film's ending - which will be publicly solved here next month!]\n\nThe last ending but one written for Suspicion was a comic one. Hitchcock and Raphaelson started it on May 26, before Johnnies bedroom confession had been previewed, and revised it on June 14, the day after the first unsuccessful preview. (Here I can refer the curious to 'Hitchcocks Notebooks' by Dan Auiler, with one caveat: the script pages reproduced on pp. 69 and 76 are incorrectly dated 5/14 - they should be dated 6/14.) Perhaps anticipating that the preview ending would get laughs, Hitchcock and his collaborator devised a way for Lina to realize her error that was guaranteed to have that effect: a cutaway shows that the family dog is present in her bedroom when she starts to drink the glass of milk, and when she sets it down still full, Johnnie, with a remark about 'waste,' feeds it to the dog. Linas horrified reaction reveals her suspicions, and a discussion ensues that ends with Johnnie swearing to reform, and Lina passionately telling him that she believes him. Johnnie: 'Do you know - Im beginning to believe it myself!' They both laugh. The confessional ending was previewed again on June 23, and again drew a discouraging response from the crowd. Then, on June 25, just before flying to New York to appear on the radio show 'Information, Please,' Hitchcock reshot the ending in the bedroom, a fact I only discovered recently when delving into the production files for this guest editorial. Because only script and production files are available at UCLA, there is no way to tell, just from the scene numbers on the production report, what the content of this reshoot was. There are three possibilities: 1) It may have been the 'leave em laughing' ending just described. 2) Hitchcock may have tried reshooting the preview ending to make it work. 3) He may even have finally tried shooting the unhappy ending with the 'twist' of the letter, which was certainly foreshadowed in the body of the film. Only the continuity reports typed up daily by the script supervisor for use by the editor can tell us what Hitchcock filmed that day, and for several years now, RKO post-production records have been unavailable to scholars. Fortunately, a helpful soul in the Turner organization has promised to research the matter for me. I will report the results here in January, and in the meantime I invite the reader who has stayed with me this long to cast his or her eye over the evidence Ive presented and make an educated guess. (My money is on 2.) Whatever the mystery ending was, no account before this mentions it or any attempt to preview it. Instead, we know that Hitchcock rushed back from New York because the new head of production, Sol Lesser, had recut the film, and the director seems to have spent much of July getting his picture put back together The third and final ending he came up with in these tense circumstances - moving the wild car ride to the morning after Lina thinks Johnnie tried to poison her and shooting a brief confession scene on a cliff - was not just an editing job, as I too hastily stated in 'Hitchcock at Work'. It actually involved reshooting bits of the scenes leading up to the wild ride and most of the ride itself. Once again, Hitchcocks interview in the 'Tribune' offers the best explanation of how he came to this ending after doing everything in his power to pull off a long dialogue scene that would be right at home at the end of a film by Raphaelsons regular collaborator, Ernst Lubitsch. (Hitchcock would finally pull that one off with the help of a constantly moving camera in Under Capricorn.) 'Short stories and films are taken in all at one sitting,' he tells the 'Tribune' interviewer. 'There are no breaks to give the audience digestion time. The plot in each case must spin directly to a conclusion, and speed is essential to directness.' Speeded up, the 'twist' of Johnnies innocence worked with the audience, as Hitchcock points out when he sums up the Suspicion experience at the end of the piece: 'Well ... those troubles are over now, for better or worse. By the run, I judge that its for better! And the troubles were never as bad as they might have been. Id greatly prefer to have a story stall at the end than in the middle. There wont be any such difficulties with my next - I trust.'\n\n [Editor's note. My deep thanks to Bill Krohn for publishing his breakthrough research on Suspicion here first - a different version, with added emphasis on the aesthetic implications, will appear in the French journal 'Trafic'. Bill acknowledges inspiration for his reading of Suspicion to Mark Crispin Miller's essay \"Hitchcock's Suspicions and Suspicion\" - cited above on November 12 and 26 - and to the chapter on Suspicion in Donald Spoto's 'The Art of Alfred Hitchcock'. Bill would add that the first researcher to note the significance of three mooted titles for the film, all containing references to the mailing of a letter (e.g., Posthumously Yours), was Steven DeRosa on his 'Hitchcock and His Writers' website - there's a link to that site on our Links page. Finally, readers are encouraged to check back here in January when Bill will reveal what form of the film's ending was shot, or re-shot, on June 25, 1941. Could it have been the 'incriminating letter' ending?]\n\nDecember 5 - 2001\n\n[Today, Bill Krohn's penultimate report on the making of Suspicion adds more detail on the different revelations and explanations that were considered for the film's ending.]\n\nThe endings which appear in early drafts of Suspicion indirectly support Hitchcocks surprising statement that in the ending previewed Lina actually drank the milk and only realized her error about Johnnie when it dawned on her she wasnt dying - that is more or less what happens in all of them. Two other common features: in all the early endings Johnnie realizes that Lina has suspected him of murder - a detail that would be eliminated in the endings actually filmed - and none of them mentions suicide. It wasnt until the preview ending, written during the hiatus while Fontaine was out sick, that Hitchcock and Raphaelson hit on the idea of Johnnie planning to kill himself - a 'twist' that hardly had the shock value of Johnnie mailing the letter that would send him to the gallows in the last shot, although it must have looked like genius to Hitchcock in comparison to what he had on paper up to that point. In the November 28 draft by Harrison and Reville, which set the pattern for the ending, Johnnie berates himself after realizing what Lina has been thinking and compares his life to Hogarths 'The Rakes Progress.' (The comparison survives in the name of the London club where Johnnie claims he was when Beaky died: the Hogarth Club.) Raphaelsons initial contribution in his December 18 screenplay and additional drafts appended to it was to stick with the idea that Johnnie is as guilty as if he had done the things Lina imagined because he might have done them - a morally dubious (albeit very Hitchcockian) proposition that Raphaelson expanded into an even longer monologue by Johnnie about being born into the impoverished branch of an illustrious family and turning to gambling (and cheating) to pay for the expensive tastes he acquired in childhood, a monologue that builds up to the most infelicitous sentence Raphaelson, one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood, ever put on paper: 'You were writing my story more accurately than I lived it.' In one of these variants Johnnie even takes the theory of virtual guilt to the limit by shockingly announcing 'Youre right. Im your murderer. I killed you!' and going on to explain: 'You saw me as Beakys murderer, and yours. That makes me as guilty as if I had done it.' If we consider that all of these quotes are from drafts done just before and after the start of production, I dont think we have to posit a Machiavellian strategy of Hitchcocks to understand why, when he was signing off on the plans for the Village Street, he stuck a letter-box in the middle of it, just in case. If he were really trying to sabotage the happy ending to get his way, why would he keep trying to find a happy ending that worked? When Fontaine went home sick on April 23, he and Raphaelson started to rework the ending by cancelling the second part, which would have sent Johnnie off to fight the Battle of Britain, and trying out two ways of ending the film in the bedroom: in the first Johnnie says 'You were willing to die for me ... you never knew that at any moment since I first laid eyes on you, I would have died for you.' This harks back to a March 15 draft that still segued to the RAF, but the alternative typed up the same day, April 23, takes the conclusion in a different direction: Johnnies monologue about his sad childhood and virtual guilt is cancelled; instead he swears, 'No more betting, no more lying, no more cheating. You believe me, dont you dear?' Lina: 'Yes, of course I do.' They embrace, and in the last shot 'She looks out over his shoulder at the audience [italics mine] - she smiles, very maternally and very understandingly, while she strokes his hair. But we know she cannot believe him.' The collaborators subsequently hit on the suicide 'twist,' which was filmed in May and previewed in June, but their first attempt at a conclusion free of melodramatic speech-making (anticipating by almost forty years the last shot of Family Plot) would become the basis for yet another rewrite that Hitchcock initiated ten days after shooting wrapped, as soon as he had had a chance to see the whole film cut together with the preview ending in place. Significantly, the new ending that was started on May 26, which may even have been filmed, was a happy ending, too.\n\nDecember 4 - 2001\n\n[Bill Krohn reveals that there may have been a variant of the previewed ending of Suspicion whose script version is published on this website ...]\n\nAfter accessing memos in the RKO archives, Donald Spoto says that it was actually Hitchcock who, when the West-Ingster script for 'Before the Fact' was proposed to him, sold RKO on the idea of filming the story of a woman who imagines things, and who had Joan Harrison and Alma Reville start writing something along those lines. This meshes with what Lionel Godfrey says in 'The Light Touch', his biography of Cary Grant: that Hitchcock actually asked RKO to give him the project, and that he thought the West-Ingster script was 'beautiful,' but wanted to take the story in another direction. It is quite possible that Hitchcock only hit on the 'twist' of the incriminating letter, as a way of punishing Johnnie, after he had sold RKO on this approach, and after two new drafts with happy endings had been written. This would explain the late appearance of 'A Letter to Mail' in the last of three lists of suggested titles, dated December 10, preserved in the Hitchcock Collection at the Herrick Library. Perhaps if Michele Morgan had not had a thick French accent when she did her two screen-tests for Hitchcock in late1940 he could even have implemented the idea with Morgan and Olivier, RKOs first choice for the role. But when Morgan didnt work out, he may well have been hoist by his own petard, because it was evidently the next draft (finished on December 28), with dialogue by Samson Raphaelson, that sold the project to an enthusiastic Joan Fontaine, although Cary Grant, at least in retrospect, has said that he would have preferred to play a villain, as he was apparently willing to do for Hitchcock in Dial M for Murder. 'I thought the original was marvelous,' Grant told Nancy Nelson during the 70s. 'It was a perfect Hitchcock ending. But the studio insisted that they didnt want Cary Grant to play a murderer.' The 'perfect Hitchcock ending' would of course be the incriminating letter, which all witnesses have said the studio would have none of once they had stars like Fontaine and Grant. Why, then, did Hitchcock persist in laying the groundwork for this ending while filming, a decision that must have been made at the start of production when he was ordering sets to be built, including the village street set in which the letter-box plays such an ominous role? (The last-minute adjustments Hitchcock ordered for this set on March 11 consisted only of deepening the store behind the bookshop window. The letter-box must have been part of the original plans for the set, and therefore of Hitchcocks plans for the film.) Here again the 'Tribune' interview is helpful: 'Toward the end of the film Grant brings Miss Fontaine a glass of milk which she believes is poisoned. It seemed logical to me that she should drink it and put him to the test. If he wished to kill his devoted wife, then she might well want to die. If he didnt, fine and good; her suspicions would clear away and wed have our happy ending. We shot that finish. She drained the glass and waited for death. Nothing happened, except for an unavoidable and dull exposition of her spouses innocence. Trial audiences booed it, and I dont blame them. They pronounced the girl stupid to willfully drink her possible destruction. With that dictum I personally do not agree. But I did agree that the necessary half-reel of explanation following the wifes survival was really deadly.' In the preview ending as shot, Hitchcock says here, six months after the events he is describing, Lina actually drank the milk before discovering that Johnnie had contemplated suicide. Even though the preview cards do not show the audience balking at this idea, it is certain - and perfectly understandable now that we have a rough text of what was shown to them - that they balked at the 'necessary half-reel of explanation' that followed. But that is precisely the alternative Hitchcock was faced with when he went into production in early February, except that the 'half-reel of explanation' at that point was more like a full ten minutes. A review of the solutions that were tried on paper once he had committed to a happy ending will help us understand why, on strictly esthetic grounds, Hitchcock was simultaneously preparing the way for a solution he knew would work\n\nDecember 3 - 2001\n\n[Author of 'Hitchcock at Work', Bill Krohn, this week concludes his analysis of how key parts of Suspicion evolved during production and post-production. Today, more about Hitchcock's intentions.]\n\nThe following account of how the ending of Suspicion came to be is based in part on second-hand information because large areas of the RKO production record are currently hard to get at. But after picking the film apart into its successive script-versions, I want to speculate on its production in a way that leaves the door open to taking it seriously as one of Hitchcocks best 40s films, a flawed but brilliant first attempt at what would eventually be done to perfection in Rear Window. To supplement what Hitchcock said years later to Bogdanovich, Truffaut and Taylor, I will quote from a little-known interview that appeared in the 'New York Herald Tribune' on December 7, 1941 (no wonder no one read it!), when Suspicion was already a hit (half a million in profit, with virtually no foreign moneys coming in) and Hitchcock already hard at work on Saboteur. Stories had been appearing in print about RKOs struggle to do justice to 'Before the Fact' since before Hitchcock took on the project, and I have yet to find a contemporary review which doesnt talk about the ending as one of many that had been considered. His setting-the-record-straight interview with the 'Tribune' makes no mention of the 'incriminating letter' ending, which he would only begin talking about years later, but if we make allowances for the inevitable show of solidarity with the studio when Oscar ballots had yet to be mailed out (Suspicion eventually received three nominations), and if we put what he says together with what we know about the knotty process he had only recently brought to a successful conclusion, it gives us a pretty accurate glimpse of Hitchcocks thoughts about turning Francis Iless novel into a film. He begins by contrasting cinema with plays and novels and emphasizing what it has in common with short stories. 'The short story and the screen play have unity and speed in common,' he explains, 'and one thing more - each, in my opinion, requires a twist ending ... For instance, all through Suspicion belief piles up in the wifes mind and the audiences that the husband is a murderer. The written novel had time for soliloquy and brooding. So when the husband is proved actually to be a murderer it is psychologically right and proper. But that conclusion wouldnt do in a film or a short story. Build him up as a killer with all the tricks of a trade and then say yes, he is a killer, and the audience would ask a weary \"So what?\" Esthetically the novels outcome is perfect. In a picture it would be simply flat. No, its got to have a twist .... I knew as soon as I read Before the Fact that thered have to be a different ending ...' (And indeed, even the ending Hitchcock says he was not allowed to film would have been different from the novel.) 'It is axiomatic in Hollywood that unhappy endings breed commercial failures ... But supposing we had forgotten all that and made the husband a murderer - then wed have had the Hays Office to deal with. The code demands that a murderer face punishment by law. All right. The man poisons his wife and its psychologically right and as esthetic as all get-out [i.e., as esthetic as hell - Ed.]. But it will take an anti-climactic reel or two to turn him over to justice. Thats no good.' Hitchcock is omitting from his retrospective analysis the 'twist' of the incriminating letter, which would supply swift justice, solving both problems posed by making Johnnie a murderer, but what if this were a description of his reasoning in 1940 when he was first presented the Nathanael West-Boris Ingster script, which RKO was nervously considering filming with Laurence Olivier when Hitchcock came to RKO on a loan-out from David Selznick? One great flaw of that script, in which Johnnie is a very bad character indeed, is precisely the long wrap-up (Lina kills Johnnie in self-defense and is tried for it), and the same is true of an even earlier version in which he is hunted by the police and shot down in the woods. Given Hitchcocks esthetic, which dictated speed and surprise, it is perfectly logical that he, and not RKO, would have objected to this ending, assuming that he had not yet thought of the letter gimmick. This is just what the record seems to show he did\n\nNovember 28 - 2001\n\n[How did Hitchcock's mind work? Here's further evidence, assembled by Bill Krohn after delving minutely into the production of Suspicion.]\n\nHitchcock apparently didnt feel that the train compartment scene was quite right after reshooting it on May 7 and 8, because he retook the last few shots of the scene on May 14, just before the picture wrapped. This was presumably when Johnnies unscripted poke at the conductor about the stamp - 'Write to your mother!' - was added, perhaps at the suggestion of Cary Grant, who frequently contributed comic bits to his films. While it certainly adds nothing to the general 'postal theme' which had by now been scripted and filmed, the remark brings the encounter between Johnnie and the official to a highly satisfactory conclusion, and so has a reason to be in the film apart from the peculiar one of alluding to an ending that was never filmed. (The happy ending that would be unsuccessfully previewed on June 13 was being filmed, on May 14, 15 and 16, even as this new conclusion to the films first scene was added.) The same thing can be said for the cameo of Hitchcock mailing a letter in front of the village bookstore, which signals the beginning of the films sinister second half, when the possibility of murder has entered the picture via Johnnies remark at the end of the previous scene: 'One of these days it will kill him.' Already well-known to American audiences (his caricature had even appeared in ads for the comedy Mr and Mrs Smith), Hitchcock signals by his mere presence dark doings to come, even if his action in this walk-on would have appeared innocuous in 1941 to all but a very small handful of spectators close to the production who knew about the 'incriminating letter' ending. But only that handful of spectators would notice the imposing presence of the mailbox in the earlier tracking shot of Lina and Isobel, the mystery writer, walking down the street just before Lina spots the chairs Johnnie sold in the window of the antique shop: the looming black object comes between them and the camera, obscuring Lina as she tells Isobel that she has just bought her latest mystery novel for Johnnie. A little bit of spatial choreography to make RKOs one-set English village more real? Why not - but why a letter-box? And isnt it a virtual admission of the poverty of the set that the letter-box looms even larger when Lina is walking away from a very unpleasant conversation with Helen Newsham about Johnnies day at the races (during which the letter-box is visible behind them in a solitary front-angle shot that seems to have no other reason for being there), one that will lead her to have an even more unpleasant conversation with Johnnies erstwhile employer, Captain Melbeck, during which she will learn that her husband has been sacked for embezzlement? The second tracking shot was filmed on the 13th, right after Hitchcocks cameo, with camera rails laid in a different position than they had been on the 12th to put the camera closer to Linas troubled expression ... and to the letter-box. Could these repeated intrusions (four in the space of just under seven minutes of film) possibly be a very distant allusion to the cruel nickname Linas family gives her in Francis Iless novel? ('You funny little monkeyface,' Johnnie says fondly while theyre on their honeymoon, using his pet name for her for the first time. 'My family used to call me letter-box,' Lina replies, ashamed. In the October treatment, written before one of Hollywoods reigning beauties was cast as Lina, Joan Harrison has her explain that the nickname means her mouth is 'big enough to post a letter in.') Perhaps; although fans of Iless novel would probably be too busy bemoaning the massive liberties the filmmakers had taken with their source material to appreciate the homage. But when even the remotest possible public meanings have been ruled out, this slightly blurred dark mass that twice covers Lina's face like a dark cloud, a pure piece of mise-en-scène too fleetingly glimpsed to ever coalesce with a four-square literary device like the 'postal theme,' remains for me the most convincing proof that Hitchcock was up to something when he filmed these tracking shots, and his cameo in March, as the creator of this website persuasively argues in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story'. I will try to determine just what that might have been, from the skimpy, contradictory evidence available, when I return to the eternal question of the films ending before handing the reins back to Ken.\n\nNovember 28 - 2001\n\n[Bill Krohn further addresses his, and others', suspicions ...] [Revised.]\n\nNovember 27 - 2001\n\nAs we have seen, Hitchcock and Samson Raphaelson started revising the first scene of Suspicion almost as soon as it had been shot. It finally came together on paper on April 23 and on film on May 7 and 8. In the April 23 version of the scene, Johnnie cheekily takes a stamp from Linas purse (an idea that began to take shape in drafts dating from early March), which he tries to pay back in another scene rewritten on April 23 and filmed in May - the Hunt he has come to Linas village to ride in. After seeing her looking glamorous on a horse, he rides after her, grabs her horses reins to stop her, and offers her a stamp to repay the one he took. She rejects it and it flies out of his hand into a mud puddle. When he recovers it and brushes it off, he sees she has ridden away, leaving him with the stamp stuck to his fingers. (This scene was shot and later eliminated.) Persistent, Johnnie has friends take him to Linas home for a proper introduction. When they shake hands, Lina looks down to see, in an insert, that Johnnie has put a stamp in her hand. This detail was not scripted, but production memos show that Hitchcock was planning to shoot it as late as August 8, when the film was basically already finished. The stamps travels describe a new version of the symbolic circuit that was originally scripted between Johnnie and Linas father, and displacing this subtle postal battle between men into the love-game with the stamp makes the same points about Johnnie in a less obnoxious way: he seems to be after Linas money (the stamp on the train), but falls for her when he sees her looking beautiful on her horse (the stamp at the Hunt), and finally gets her to accept his symbolic repayment (the stamp in the sitting room), which he offers to a softer version of the girl he met on the train, curled up with a book about Modern Art while waiting for her parents to go to church, after which she will probably moon over his photo in 'The Illustrated London News'. Eventually Hitchcock would eliminate not only the collect telegram (never filmed), but the letter announcing the elopement (filmed and cut out), so that Linas hopeful trip to the post office to see if dear Johnnie has written, and her alibi about 'going to the post office' when they elope, would have become the logical conclusion of the romantic postal motif begun on the train, with Johnnie once again - belatedly - paying his debt. Do youngsters in England play 'post office'? In any event, that is what Lina and Johnnie have been doing, until another kind of postal motif erupts, putting their relationship in doubt - the series of sinister letters and telegrams in the films second half that make it appear that he is planning to murder her. This extended postal love game is actualized in the film, but in a truncated form: Hitchcock cut the horseback scene between Lina and Johnnie and never filmed the payoff in the sitting room, leaving the stamp motif 'unfinished,' as he told François Truffaut he was obliged to do with the blue footprints in The Man Who Knew Too Much (set up when Louis Bernard crashes into a man with a bucket of paint while fleeing the police in the marketplace), which he was planning to shoot on the Paramount backlot practically up to the moment the negative was cut. Left unfinished, Lina and Johnnies stamp game has taken on, for some critics, the dark meanings attached to letters in the second part of the film, and something Hitchcock added to the train scene when he reshot it for the third time on May 14 has certainly done nothing to allay those suspicions.\n\nNovember 26 - 2001\n\n[Our current guest-editor, Bill Krohn, emailed us tonight: 'It's a good thing your webpage favors the \"work in progress\" approach.' He thinks the final wrap-up on Suspicion will occur by the end of this week. Now read on ...]\n\nThe story so far: After starting production on Suspicion in early February of 1941 with an unfinished script and a last-minute cast that committed him to a happy ending, Hitchcock polished as he filmed, concentrating particularly on the films crucial first and last scenes, which were rewritten several times during production. Linas first meeting with Johnnie, which was filmed on the first day of production (February 10), was rewritten for the last time on April 23 and completely reshot in early May, just before wrapping, with a new opening. Hitchcock had originally planned to begin the scene and the film conventionally with an establishing shot of a train, followed by a closeup of the photo Lina sees of Johnnie in an illustrated magazine: pan up to the real Johnnie, dozing on the seat across from her. And this photo/reality substitution would have been repeated at the end, when Lina, searching for Johnnie after he runs away, sees a photo of him sporting an RAF uniform in the same illustrated magazine. But the April 23 rewrite (done after Hitchcock decided, perhaps because of cost overruns, not to film the RAF ending), had the scene beginning this way: 'Lina McLaidlaw is seated in the corner of a first-class railway compartment ... With a warning shriek, the train suddenly plunges into a tunnel ... As the train emerges out of the tunnel into the light once more, we find Johnnie Aysgarth in the act of stepping over Linas legs. JOHNNIE: \"Im terribly sorry - I hope I didnt hurt you.\"' The production report for May 7 notes that the 'light effect' took some minutes to set up, and when Hitchcock filmed it, he revised it in a very interesting way: The film begins without an establishing shot, in total darkness, with the sounds of a train and a compartment door banging shut: 'JOHNNIE: \"Im sorry - is that your leg?' Then, as the lights come on to show him stashing his bag over his seat: 'I had no idea we were coming into a tunnel.' This opening, which does away with the slightly risqué shot of Johnnie straddling Linas legs, could be taking place in the movie theatre, when the film goes dark after the directors credit and before the film begins. (In Notorious, their next collaboration, Hitchcock would introduce Grant as the silhouette of the man sitting in the seat in front of us, watching Ingrid Bergman being terribly gay at a party.) As Mark Crispin Miller has pointed out in an article about Suspicion as a predecessor to Rear Window, with its hero who is a surrogate for the voyeuristic movie audience, this suggests from the very first image that Lina is a spectator - specifically of the kind of romantic womans film that Suspicions title cards seem to be proposing. And at the end of the scene, Hitchcock uses the discarded opening to put her and us back into the mood for romance - Lina sees Johnnie looking dashing in 'The Illustrated London News', then raises her eyes to confirm that the rather boorish individual across from her is the same man. The spinsterish provincial, a closeted romantic, has found her hero. Incidentally, the photo she sees is actually a still from a scene that was shot for later in the film, when we would have seen newlywed Johnnie, who is supposed to be at his office, at the track with his friend Beaky - not shown in the photo - and the flirtatious Mrs Newsham. This insert of the shot in the newspaper is all that survives of that scene, which was eliminated in the editing - it would have been the only scene in the film showing Johnnie without Lina. The cut scene also would have put us out of synch with Linas suspicions in the next scene, when Mrs Newsham pulls up in her fancy car and twits her by revealing that she has run into Johnnie at the track, because it would have shown Johnnie resisting Mrs Newshams advances with the comment that he will never be unfaithful to Lina except with a racehorse. Without the racetrack scene, the film is entirely from the point of view of Lina, who has been subtly designated as the on-screen stand-in for the audience, so that when her romantic marriage with the dashing playboy on the train darkens into a Gothic chiller about the unsuspecting girl who married a murderer, we have no choice but to see it her way.\n\nNovember 19 - 2001\n\n[More from Bill Krohn on Suspicion. In a few days, it will all have come together ...] [Revised.]\n\nIn the Harrison-Reville first draft, the scene where Johnnie and Lina meet in a railway compartment begins when she notices that he is the handsome playboy she is reading about in an illustrated magazine, and does not take their acquaintance very far. The conductor informs Johnnie that he is travelling in a first-class compartment with a third-class ticket and obliges him to pay up. Johnnie is then joined by Helen Newsham and Cora, two fashionable friends who are also going to the country for the local Hunt, and the trio speculates that his dowdy travelling companion must be a governess - an impression that will change when they see her on horseback later that day. The postal theme, such as it is, is confined at this point to the little romantic motif of Lina 'going to the post office'. We can assume that the train scene was filmed on February 10, the first day of shooting, pretty much as it appears in the Reville-Harrison first draft, but Hitchcock must have been unsatisfied, because he ordered the set held. The wording of the production managers memo is intriguing: 'Set #1 [the train compartment] is not finished, will work again at the end of the Plot.' And in fact this scene would be completely re-shot (and the set rebuilt to accomodate a 'lighting effect') in May, at the same time as Hitchcock was filming the preview ending (Lina discovering that Johnnie has been planning to kill himself), which had also been merely sketched in when the film started shooting in February. Efforts to come up with a satisfactory first scene and last scene would continue throughout production - they were the only scenes to receive this kind of attention. The first rewrite of Lina meeting Johnnie on the train, dated February 18, introduces a transaction between them for the first time. When Johnnie needs a penny to get the conductor off his back, Lina shyly volunteers one. Joined by Helen and Cora, Johnnie learns that Lina is an heiress. Cora gives him a penny to return to Lina, betting him 5 pounds that he cant date this prude, and he begins a phony conversation with the latter about concerts and museums, while the other two women watch in amusement, until it dawns on her that shes being mocked. With wounded dignity, she gets up and leaves the compartment. This comic opening would be discarded, but it already shows Hitchcock and Raphaelson planning to establish Johnnies financial state and propensity for borrowing, so when the scene of the telegram arriving before the Ball was filmed six days later, Hitchcock could drop the harsh business of it being sent collect. In this phase of the script, the penny borrowed and repaid on the train initiates the rhythm that will structure the rest of the film: Johnnie does something that shocks Lina (the handsome playboy is supercilious and ill-mannered, if not literally penniless!), then reassures her (he always repays his debts - particularly his debts to her). Their evolving relationship is tainted now at the outset by ambiguity (the penny, the 5-pound bet), which will become more sinister with each new shock, but now the rhythm is nothing but the ebb and flow of what passes between the two of them - the General has been relegated to a supporting role, like the conductor. Undated pages inserted at the end of the February 18 script then show the collaborators hitting on the postage stamp idea, which would probably have been incorporated in a March 6 rewrite of the first scene that makes Johnnie more of a brash charmer, complaining to Lina about leaving the window open because he has a hangover, talking about how much he drank the night before, and going to sleep when she reads him a passage from her 'Child Psychology' book about narcissistic male children who are adored by their mothers. When the conductor wakes him up and demands payment, Lina again bails him out with a penny, but Cora and Helen are dropped in this version, as well as the rather nasty bet and the equally nasty prank that followed it. Then, in the loose pages I referred to earlier, when Lina stuffily insists on being paid back her penny ('I dont like to be taken for granted'), Johnnie first offers her a check and then takes an old letter out of his pocket, pries off the stamp and makes her take it. With this addition, all the elements of the scene that would finally come together weeks later had been assembled, including the idea that Johnnie should win us over by taking a verbal poke at the conductor. Forced to go through his pockets looking for change to satisfy the stern official, he pulls out a golf tee and a womans lipstick, and when he finds he is a penny short, before Lina offers to help, he asks the conductor if he couldnt use the lipstick. This suggestion picks up on a strategy he uses in the Reville-Harrison first draft to get rid of an interior decorator who is insisting on presenting a bill Johnnie knows he cant pay: 'Dont you think this room is a little effeminate?' he wonders out loud, then says hes sure it will be fine and shoos the poor fellow away. Like that bit of gay-bashing, the lipstick joke succumbed to Hitchcocks eraser and was never filmed, but it would eventually be replaced by the equally insulting parting shot that is in the film: 'Write to your mother!' When the scene on the train finally gelled on April 23, however, it would become part of a symbolic circuit much larger than the discarded one which made Linas marriage part of a struggle between Johnnie and the General, as we shall see in a later installment\n\nNovember 14 - 2001\n\n[Bill Krohn continues to track the evolvement of Suspicion ...]\n\nThere is no denying that both the stamp that Johnnie takes from Lina to pay for his railway ticket and the letter we see Hitchcock mailing halfway through Suspicion allude to the suppressed ending of what Ive been calling the Ur-Suspicion: Johnnie's mailing of the incriminating letter to Linas mother. However, this private meaning - which Hitchcock made public when he started talking to interviewers about how he would have liked the film to end - is not the only one. When the stamp Johnnie takes from Lina during their first encounter was written into the script on April 23 (the day the production shut down for two weeks because Joan Fontaine had fallen ill), it was being added to a script where stamps, letters and telegrams had an important role to play from the beginning. In the November 28 first draft written by Alma Reville and Joan Harrison, a postal theme is sounded when Lina says goodbye to her parents without telling them that shes eloping: instead, she says shes going to the post office 'to buy some stamps'. That phrase stayed in the script but didnt make it into the film, where Lina just says shes going to the post office. But another first-draft postal reference did survive. Earlier in the film a lovelorn Lina really does go to the post office hoping that there will be a letter from Johnnie - there isnt. Eliminating the irrelevant stamp reference while filming the touching elopement scene made for a perfect echo: Linas second trip 'to the post office' is not in vain because this time she and Johnnie are running away to get married. This modest romantic postal motif contrasts with the flood of sinister communications which arrive for Lina in the second half of the film when her suspicions have taken root: the telegrams announcing her fathers and Beakys deaths, the letter from Johnnies employer threatening him with prison if he doesnt replace the money he stole, and the letter from the insurance company informing Johnnie that the policy will be paid only in the event of Linas death. We can also add the most sinister letter of all, the one that would have hanged Johnnie if the Ur-Suspicion had been made - still a possibility, it would seem, while this first draft was being written. In his December 28 'final' draft, Lubitsch-collaborator Samson Raphelson added a comic variation on these two postal clusters, as we might call them: Lina's hoped-for letter from Johnnie never comes, but he does finally send a collect telegram (which Linas outraged father is obliged to pay for) announcing that Johnnie will be attending the Hunt Ball - an uninvited visit during which he sweeps Lina off her feet. The next day a boy delivers a letter and package to Linas parents after she has 'gone to the post office'. Reading the letter, which announces the elopement, General MacLaidlaw drops the package with an off-screen thud. This postal one-two punch is repaid with a kind of grim exactitude when Johnnie receives two nasty surprises from his reluctant father-in-law: the antique chairs, brought by messenger, that dash his hopes of a lavish wedding present, and the telegram announcing General MacLaidlaws death, followed by the reading of a will which leaves Johnnie and Lina nothing but a portrait of the deceased. But Johnnies part in all this rather Lubitschian one-upmanship didnt make it into the movie: the dialogue about the collect telegram was never filmed, and the arrival of the letter announcing Linas elopement was filmed but eliminated in the editing. (All the eliminated touches that I have described so far are in the script for sale from dealers like bookcity.com.) Instead, a symbolic circuit like the one I've sketched between Johnnie and Linas father was set up in the railway car at the beginning - a circuit this time connecting Lina and Johnnie, and with the stuffy conductor standing in for General MacLaidlaw before he ever appears. In my next \"Editor's Day\" item, I'll try to show how that suggestive little scene took root and grew as the story was being written and filmed.\n\nNovember 13 - 2001\n\n[Author Bill Krohn, Hollywood correspondent for 'Cahiers du cinéma', has his suspicions about Suspicion ... ]\n\nSee Ken Moggs introduction on this website to the original ending of Suspicion for background about RKOs attempts to produce a more faithful adaptation of Francis Iles 'Before the Fact' before Hitchcock ever came to the studio. The fact that one of these treatments was shown to Orson Welles when he arrived at RKO suggests that the studio might happily have let Johnnie be a murderer if the right actor played the part: because Welles had played many tragic heroes and hero-villains on stage and on the radio, audiences would have accepted him in the role, as they later did in The Stranger (1946). In fact, it appears that even as Joan Harrison and Alma Reville were writing a treatment and first draft based on the idea that Lina is imagining things, Hitchcock and the studio were still toying with a casting idea that would have made a darker story possible. On November 16 and again on December 2, 1940, two months before the start of production, Hitchcock directed screen-tests with Michele Morgan and Edmond OBrien. Is this, you wonder, why RKO was collecting lists of titles implying a murderous conclusion as late as December 10? (Fontaine and Grant were tested on January 31 and again on February 4, six days before the cameras rolled.) Since the first draft was finished on November 28, before the second Morgan-OBrien screen-test, Hitchcock May well have felt - given the systematic ambiguity concerning Johnnies guilt or innocence that had to be maintained in the audiences mind to the very end - that he would not have to have a whole new script written to start production on Id Die for You (one of the suggested titles), starring Morgan and OBrien, should the need arise. A French Lina, on the other hand, would have required more than a few adjustments, and in fact Claude Bonique-Mercier notes in a brief biographical sketch (in his 'Michele Morgan', 1983, p. 193) that the actress lost the chance to make her American debut under Hitchcocks tutelage 'because of her accent'. A studio memo about the tests leaves it open whether OBrien, an alumnus of Welles Mercury Playhouse who had been cast in a featured role in RKOs Hunchback of Notre Dame (1938), was a serious candidate to play Johnnie with a fake British accent: 'Test [of] Michele Morgan for the part of Lina, supported by Ed. OBrien.' Two things are certain: OBrien played the role not once but twice for Hitchcocks camera (where is that footage?), and if he had been cast opposite Morgan, the film could have been made as RKO had always planned, with a murderous Johnnie and a $650,000 budget. Perhaps the ambiguity of the screenplay that was being written would actually have permitted Hitchcock, with a few adjustments, to start making such a film on January 10, as RKO wanted, although the director was never overly solicitous about the studios deadlines for this picture. (The January 10 start date is mentioned in a December 12 memo from J. R. McDonough in UCLAs RKO archives). Did that built-in ambiguity subsequently encourage him to hope that, even with Fontaine and Grant, he might eventually turn Before the Fact (the title used during production) into the film he wanted to make (call it the Ur-Suspicion), just by shooting a different ending when the time came? Ken Mogg was the first Hitchcock scholar to suggest this possibility, and it is hard to disprove, even when the scripts at UCLA show no trace of any such ending ever being put on paper. Moreover, in 'The Alfred Hitchcock Story' Mogg cites three strong pieces of evidence that Hitchcock was preparing audiences for just such a conclusion. 1) When Johnnie and Lina meet in a railway coach in the first scene, he is traveling first-class with a third-class ticket and doesnt have enough cash to pay the stern conductor the difference, so he brashly asks Lina for help and settles for a postage stamp she has in her purse. As the conductor leaves, outraged at having to accept a stamp as 'legal tender', Johnnie fires a parting shot - 'Write to your mother' - which certainly seems to allude to the last scene of the Ur-Suspicion: Johnnie mailing the incriminating letter to Linas mother. 2) Later, just before Lina gets some unpleasant news from Helen Newsham in front of the village bookstore, Hitchcock himself is seen posting a letter in a nearby mailbox. 3) In an earlier scene, when Lina is walking through the village with Isobel, the mystery writer, the camera pans past that mailbox, which momentarily blocks our view of Lina. Noting Hitchcocks cameo in 'Hitchcock at Work', I interpreted it, like Gene Phillips in his study of Hitchcock, as 'a sly allusion', an in-joke which eventually became public when Hitchcock told Truffaut (and before him Peter Bogdanovich) how he had wanted the film to end, but Mogg argues persuasively that by inserting all these postal references Hitchcock was laying the groundwork for an ending he could spring on RKO after it became evident that audiences werent going to accept Johnnies innocence, just as he had made plans to shoot a sound version of Blackmail without telling British International. More about that mysterious 'postal theme' tomorrow.\n\nNovember 12 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. Newly published on this website, for the first time anywhere, is a script excerpt from Hitchcock's Suspicion giving the only ending of that film (with a mysterious possible exception which will also be unveiled on this website shortly: see entries for December 4, 5 and 6, below - Ed.) that was actually shot and previewed - apart, that is, from the ending we now have. Our guest this week, Bill Krohn, the author of the award-winning 'Hitchcock au travail'/'Hitchcock At Work', discusses his research into the various planned endings of Suspicion, plus some related matters.]\n\nThe best account of the imbroglio over the ending of Suspicion (1941) is given in John Russell Taylors biography 'Hitch' (1978). Hitchcock had previously told François Truffaut that his preferred ending would have been for Lina (Joan Fontaine) to knowingly let her adored husband Johnnie (Cary Grant) kill her, as in the book by Francis Iles, but only after giving him an incriminating letter to mail to her mother, which we would have seen him do in the last shot. Asked if the ending was ever filmed, Hitchcock told his biographer no, and Taylor, who had access not only to his subjects papers, but to the complete RKO files, added that the preferred ending was never even written down. Instead, from the outset Hitchcock and his collaborators wrote a screenplay about a woman who simply imagines that her neer-do-well husband wants to kill her to collect her insurance and pay back money which he has embezzled. In the ending that was first shot, Johnnie brings Lina a glass of milk she thinks is poisoned, she sets it down untouched, then steals into his room just in time to stop him from taking poison himself - and her paranoia is cured. For those who May wonder why two separate preview audiences laughed at this ending, it is now reproduced on this website. As I explained in 'Hitchcock at Work', Hitchcock then saved the day by moving a wild car ride that was to have come before the poisoning to the morning after, followed by a brief explanation (still involving Johnnies intention to commit suicide rather than go to jail) on a cliff overlooking the sea. When 'Life' magazine asked Hitchcock for stills showing 'the three endings for the film' (I'll explain 'three' later: see entries for December 4, 5 and 6, below - Ed.), so that the public could make up their own minds, Hitch refused. Unfortunately, exactly what he feared has occurred. Following the Truffaut interview and subsequent commentary - which made things even murkier - so much speculation has arisen that the avuncular presenter on American Movie Classics not long ago confided to viewers who had just watched the film that 'somewhere in the vaults of RKO' there is an ending in which Lina gets pregnant by another man and commits suicide! Those speculations, combined with the fact that the clifftop confession does play like something pulled out of a hat, have led some critics to undervalue one of Hitchcocks best '40s films. To the best of my knowledge, Mark Crispin Miller is the only critic who has taken seriously, in his essay Hitchcocks Suspicions and Suspicion, the idea of Lina as fantasist, and applied it at length to interpreting the film - although I recently appropriated his reading in my commentary for the French DVD of Suspicion, introduced by the chapter heading \"An English Bovary\". Most critics have just taken it for granted that Hitchcock made a film about a woman married to a murderer and tacked on an unsatisfactory ending after the real one was unsuccessfully previewed. Pascal Kanes 'Cahiers du cinéma' critique from 1971, which is unfortunately not available in English, makes that assumption and goes on to defend the film as an exemplary Hitchcock work, concluding that credulous Linas murder will still occur, being 'virtually programmed by the [happy] ending.' Since a more sophisticated version of this argument has been made by Ken Mogg, who lent me this pulpit, I will need to state the arguments pro and con ...\n\nNovember 7 - 2001\n\n[Finally, Richard Allen looks at Freud's theory of idealization ... ]\n\nOne final speculation ... and thanks, Ken, for allowing me to use your space to pontificate. In Freud's explicit theory of creativity - the theory of sublimation - perversion and sublimation are contrasting outcomes of the sexual instinct in human development. However, as Freudian theorist Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel has argued, Freud's concept of idealization intimates a different account of the relation of perversion to creativity: aesthetic activity is not a displacement of perversion but an enactment or realization of it, and the artwork is akin to a fetish object. 'Idealization,' Freud suggests in his essay \"On Narcissism,\" involves not a deflection of sexual instinct from sexual satisfaction but an investment of the sexual instinct in the aggrandization of the object, in particular the objectified self of the narcissist, that for Freud underlies all perversion. The incipient pervert conveniently fails to recognize the existence and authority of the father and the fact of sexual difference. He erects the fetish that sustains the narcissistic illusion that he is not differentiated from his mother, even though he knows that he must be. He manages to believe that his pre-genital sexuality is equal, if not superior, to the sexuality of the father, and in this way idealizes his abject, fragmented, infantile state with respect to heterosexual genital sexuality, as if it that state were whole and perfect, as if it were adequate to or even better than the phallic sexuality of the father. Freudian theory serves to exactly describe the relationship between creativity and perversion in Hitchcock and Oscar Wilde [cf. entry for October 30, above]. The revelation/ concealment of human perversity through the idealization of surfaces is the self-conscious and obsessive preoccupation of both artists. In the medium of film, Hitchcock discovered a form of representation that ideally suited the dramatization, the exhibition, of his own deepest obessions. As a medium of surfaces that precluded the kind of depth characterization afforded by the novel or even dramatic dialogue, silent cinema was used by Hitchcock to convey the sense that conventional forms of plotting and characterization embodied in the romance narrative were at once idealized surface, a hyperbolic reality more real than reality itself, and yet only skin deep. The performance of gentlemanliness and the masquerade of femininity, the romantic pursuit that is realized in the supreme explosive moment of the kiss, all this in Hitchcock's work, however elaborated and fully realized it becomes, is a pretext for the staging of a shadow world of perversity that is secreted beneath the veneer of orthodox values. Hitchcock's revelation/concealment of human perversity is not something hidden in his work, something that requires, say, a psychoanalytic theory to diagnose, for it is dramatized or staged in his art, and thereby made manifest through the supremely Hitchcockian strategies of performance, black humor, and suspense.\n\nNovember 6 - 2001\n\n[The life-and-death aspect of Shadow of a Doubt is discussed by Richard Allen ...]\n\nToday, some thoughts on the ring motif in Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Hitchcock's film elaborates a complex metaphor of the ring as the circle of life and romance, but also, equally, as an incestuous circle, the circle of death, expressed not simply in the ring exchanged between Uncle and niece but in the recurring image of the waltzing couples (waltzing widows and their beaus?) that occupies a surreal space in the narrative world of the film, neither simply imagined nor part of the ordinary world. Furthermore, shooting from the edge of the waltz and from below, the camera occupies a childlike view that bestows a larger than life quality on the dancers. The image is of identical couples, replicating the figure of a circle both in their individual dances and their collective movements. It is a circle of life, romance, and merriment. Yet there is a profoundly mechanistic quality to their movement as if the figures were puppets rather than people, their movements operating according to a pre-ordained scheme. It recalls the mechanism of the spinning-jenny where individual spools unwind on a larger circular wheel. It anticipates the merry-go-round of Strangers on A Train (1951) with its theme - 'Casey would waltz with the strawberry blonde as the band played on' - that links the waltz with a mechanism. The provenance of the merry-go-round as a figure of the uncanny lies in Dr Caligari and Variety (via Hitchcock's The Ring) and in the uncanny mechanical puppetry of E.T.A Hoffman. It is as if the circle of life is actually a figure of deathly repetition, of stasis. The waltz carries with it an aura of nostalgia, as if it represents a prelapsarian utopia of romance and leisure - artistocratic and Vienesse - before the fall into modernity and history. Dimitri Tiomkin's score introduces a modernist dissonance into the waltz, and when it first appears the image dissolves into a shot of rotting cars and a group of hobos - beneath the veneer of a timeless ideal lies the fallen temporality of modern civilization, of rot and decay. The second time we see the waltzing widows, the dresses of the female dancers in the foreground are edged in black, as if registering the death of the widows at the hand of Uncle Charlie and anticipating the resistance of Young Charlie to Uncle Charlie which occurs moments later when she begins to hum the tune and identifies it as the Merry Widow waltz. By the third time we see and hear the waltz motif after Young Charlie has guessed the provenance of the ring, the Merry Widow tune now begins to be vocalized by a female chorus, and Uncle Charlie, with his back turned, no longer owns the image. The final waltz occurs as Uncle Charlie, having struggled to the death with Young Charlie (a struggle that is itself a dance, an embrace), slips and falls into the vortex created by an oncoming train in a manner that suggests the wrenching spirals of Vertigo (1958). The theme of the waltz is now entirely appropriated by the female voice. Wrestling with the angel of death, Young Charlie has emerged victorious. It seems that the incestuous circle of death is finally redefined as the circle of life, and yet ... there remains the suspicion that Uncle Charlie has orchestrated his own death. In the image of the ring and the spiral Hitchcock approaches the most abstract statement of his philosophy.\n\nNovember 5 - 2001\n\n[Richard Allen will write for us again this week. Here he discusses The Lodger - this is an extract from a longer piece to be published in the next 'Hitchcock Annual'.]\n\nHitchcock's first re-working of the Jack the Ripper/Jekyll-Hyde myth in his film The Lodger (1926) is profoundly indebted to the 1913 novel by Catholic writer Marie Belloc Lowndes (sister of Hillaire Belloc). The Ripper myth is quoted by the heroine, Daisy, from a letter written to a newspaper: 'It seems to me very probable that The Avenger - to give him the name by which he apparently wishes to be known - comprises in his own person the peculiarities of Jekyll and Hyde, Mr. Louis Stevenson's now famous hero.' Lowndes's singular contribution to Hitchcock's career is that she domesticates the Ripper myth, she brings the sensational into the domain of the familial and the ordinary (as Hitchcock claimed for his TV shows). The character of Lowndes's lodger (aka The Avenger) conforms to William Ruskin's mid-century idea of a gentleman, exhibiting 'that fineness of structure in the body, which renders it capable of the most delicate sensation; and of structure in the mind which renders it capable of the most delicate sympathies' ('Modern Painters'). The psychological drama of the novel turns on the fact that while the proprietor of the lodgings, the kindly Mrs Bunting, increasingly suspects that the Lodger is The Avenger, her instinct is to protect him from exposure, to preserve his shameful secret. She is motivated by both class allegiance (she was in service) and by maternal/feminine feelings - a desire to care for and protect this good-looking young man of 'delicate sympathies'. Given the Lodger's evident indifference to women, the relationship between Mrs Bunting and her 'queer' lodger (the word is repeatedly used though not exactly in its contemporary sense) resembles the cliche of the overprotective mother and her homosexual son. Belloc-Lowndes was a society lady and an intimate of Constance Wilde, Oscar Wilde's wife. Her comments on Constance and Oscar are suggestive in this context. She writes in her diary: 'I was told by a friend, who did everything in her power to help them both, when it came to their day of shame and misery, that Constance was completely ignorant of Oscar's other life. To her he had always been the courteous, affectionate and indeed, devoted, husband.' Lowndes' experience of the Wilde affair from the perspective of Constance surely informs her portrayal of the relationship between Mrs Bunting and her lodger. In the novel, narrative suspense is subservient to the development of character psychology, in particular, to bestowing a level of depth and complexity upon the character of Mrs Bunting. But in Hitchcock's film ambiguity resides not in the motivations of character but in visual narration, in the legibility of appearances. Depth becomes a matter of surface, as it were. The pleasures of narrative suspense are not subservient to moral insight, as in Lowndes's novel, but become an end in themselves. A deadly serious question - is the Lodger a psychotic killer? - becomes in Hitchcock a source of entertainment, a macabre joke, thereby defining Hitchcock's aesthetic for the rest of his career.\n\nOctober 31 - 2001\n\n[Richard Allen discusses further literary resonances in Hitchcock. Comparing Hitchcock and Charles Dickens, he talks about the opening shot of Frenzy.]\n\nToday, some tidying up (ironically enough). The theme of pollution is linked in both Dickens and Hitchcock with human waste products. In Dickens's 'Our Mutual Friend' the pompous, vainglorious 'podsnappery' of the London elite is contrasted with the dirty polluted city represented by the murky Thames that at night is combed for corpses by human scavengers. Psychoanalytically speaking, the two sides of anality are the manifest, unavoidable presence of shit and the imperative to deny its existence, seen in obsessive cleanliness, order, and the sublimating fantasy of a spiritual elevation that might raise humans above their debased bodily condition. Arthur La Bern's novel on which Hitchcock's Frenzy [1972] is based conceives of London's Picadilly with its statue of Eros as London's anus. In Frenzy this role is accorded to the Pool of London: London's cesspool. The opening shot of the film May be thought to evoke the act of anal penetration as the camera sweeps beneath Tower Bridge. The pompous and grandiose government official (who looks like the murderer Rusk) articulates the fantasy of a shit-free environment but the camera soon reveals to us the cesspool which he seeks to magically wish away by official pronouncement. However, it is a particular piece of shit that floats in the cesspool, a female body with its buttocks exposed. The link between female sexuality, pollution and death is dear to Dickens. In 'David Copperfield', the fallen woman, Martha, is characterized in a famous passage precisely in terms of her affinity to the polluted Thames. In Hitchcock's film the whore actually floats in the cesspool of the Thames. Since pollution is equated with female sexuality, the opening camera movement can also be taken to evoke a more conventional form of sexual intercourse. Of course, both interpretations are needed. The London revealed by Hitchcock's camera is, metaphorically, a diseased or perverted whore: corrupted nature. And if London is a whore, the politician is the whore's pimp.\n\nOctober 30 - 2001\n\n[Richard Allen, contributor to and co-editor of 'Alfred Hitchcock: Centenary Essays' (1999), published by the BFI, today ruminates on the importance to Hitchcock of Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - a novel which the director read several times when he was young.]\n\nToday, more on literary connections. In 1891, three years after the London stage production of Stevenson's 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde', and after he had moved from Oxford to live in London, Oscar Wilde published 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'. In it, Wilde transposes the already established myth of Jack the Ripper as a Jekyll/Hyde figure into the sensibility of fin-de-siècle decadence and aestheticism. Dorian is afforded eternal youth by assuming the identity bequeathed upon him in the idealized portrait painted by Basil Hallward. Under the influence of the dandy Lord Henry, this immunity to physical decay allows Dorian to freely indulge his desires. However, the portrait unflinchingly registers his increasing depravity just as Hyde reveals the inner soul of Jekyll. 'Dorian Gray' is important to the development of the myth of Jack the Ripper as Jekyll/Hyde, and to Hitchcock's life-long preoccupation with that myth (see Theodore Price, 'Hitchcock and Homosexuality'), in at least four respects. First, in 'Dorian Gray', the dandy's gentlemanly persona considered as an artful fabrication that reveals/conceals dark desires is linked to the surface of the artwork that likewise reveals/conceals desires. Second, the visual pun of the decaying portrait renders literal the notion that art, as a form of idealization, murders its object. Wilde celebrates the converse, murder as a form of art, in his essay \"Pencil, Pen, and Poison\", on the artist murderer Thomas Wainwright (see Peter Conrad, 'The Hitchcock Murders'). Third, in 'Dorian Gray', art not only defies the temporality of human mortality and decay but also implicitly defies the futurity [optimism] of the romance narrative with its logic of character development and anticipation of a happy end. The creation of the artwork involves a displaced expression of perversion that 'suspends' the logic of narrative development. The brief romance developed between Dorian and the lower-class actress Sybil Vane is predicated upon Sybil mirroring in her endless roles as lover the idealized, de-temporalized identity of Dorian himself. Dorian in effect casts Sybil as an idealized version of the prostitute to mirror his own identity as an idealized version of Jekyll/Ripper. The moment that Sybil resolves to step outside her roles as a lover, assume her real-life identity as a woman, and 'fall' in love with Dorian, Dorian's desire is quenched and Sybil, rejected, precipitously dies by her own hand. Fourth, especially after the Wilde trials, where it was featured evidence, 'Dorian Gray' came to designate a work whose aestheticism functions as a displaced expression of homosexual desire - conventionally conceived as a form of perversion. Such notions, and a would-be defiance of them, lie at the heart of Hitchcock's 1948 masterpiece Rope.\n\nOctober 29 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. Associate Professor Richard Allen, former Chair of Cinema Studies at NYU, is writing a new book on Hitchcock. He has lately been comparing the novel and film of Rebecca, drawing extensively on biographies and critical studies of author Daphne Du Maurier to illumine some of the novel's and/or the film's more recondite aspects. One such aspect is the significance of the house and estate called 'Manderley'.]\n\nThere has been much discussion on the meaning of 'Manderley' in this column. Here is my take in a nutshell: 'Manderley', the man of/in the valley, stands not for Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier in the film) but more likely for the powerful, aristocratic, 'masculine' Rebecca. Du Maurier's novel suggests that English patriarchy between the wars, embodied in the ideal of the English country house, is a facade, a masquerade, maintained by 'masculine' women like Rebecca (and du Maurier herself). Its real foundation had already collapsed in the disaster of World War One. 'Manderley' does not simply become the hollowed out facade it appears when 'Rebecca' begins, it was always a facade. Du Maurier is nostalgic not for English patriarchy per se but for a moment when married lesbians (such as herself), provided they masqueraded their identity, could have their cake and eat it too. This suggests a female correlative of the Establishment homosexual spy culture that so fascinated Hitchcock. Written in 1938 on the cusp of war, 'Rebecca' describes an era that is clearly coming to an end, that has already come to an end: the facade both of the old class order, and the masquerade of femininity that serves it, is a fiction no longer tenable. This peculiarly English configuration of class, gender and sexuality between the wars is attenuated in Robert Sherwood's screenplay version, in favor of a more fairy-tale atmosphere. Englishness, the garden of England, takes on an imaginary quality as a kind of aristocratic never-never land, and the Joan Fontaine character fulfills the fantasy of the young American princess who marries into English civilization and culture (though Fontaine, of course, is an English-born actress) - but how little she understands! Rebecca's incipiently lesbian identity is more heavily disguised in the film but Hitchcock turns the resources of Hollywood to his advantage and evokes Rebecca's powerful, subversive presence through the strategy of intensifying and dramatizing surfaces. The medium of film thus allows Hitchcock to explore and undercut the manifest or apparent content of the heterosexual romance-narrative and the idea of the social order it supports and articulates. 'Rebecca' is of singular importance in Hitchcock's work because the subversive surface it manifests, its textual dandyism (if you will), is distinctly feminine, distinctly beautiful. Through his portrayal of its uterine corridors, shimmering watery surfaces, and monogrammed fabrics, 'Manderley' becomes in Hitchcock's Rebecca a sapphic temple or shrine of awesome beauty. Imagine - it was his first Hollywood film!\n\nOctober 24 - 2001\n\n[Hitchcock sometimes grew exasperated with Cary Grant, reveals Stephen Rebello ... ]\n\nAmong the many other revelations gleaned through interviews I conducted with Hitchcock associates, as well as through oral histories ... First, that the director's admiration of Grant was more a matter of shared business and creative interests than personal affinity. In fact, one longtime Hitchcock co-worker and confidante went so far as to assert that the director didn't flat-out like Grant and confined his dealings with the actor as much to the set as possible. On North by Northwest, for instance, the actor constantly challenged the screenplay and its writer Ernest Lehman (who liked Grant very much). Grant complained, among other things, that the script made absolutely no sense and that it made him shoulder too much of the action and far too much exposition. During location shooting for the film, Grant, one of the highest paid and most demanding actors in the business, astonished co-workers with a tight-fistedness that extended to his charging fans for autographs and occasionally asking Lehman or others to join him for dinners at local greasy spoons but always avoiding picking up the tab. Grant was a shrewd businessman whose contractual dealings on films exasperated Hitchcock. On North by Northwest, Grant and his agents insisted upon such perks as choice of leading lady (he championed Sophia Loren but Hitchcock rebuffed him), choice of director should Hitchcock depart the project, his choice of uniformed chauffeur, the right to insist that any remake of the film not be titled North by Northwest, a specific window of time before the film could be shown on television and his own 16mm and 35mm print of the film. The perfectionist actor seldom let up. When he saw the dailies of the film, he expressed to Hitchcock particular unhappiness with the entire Glen Cove, Long Island drunk driving sequence. Why? Vanity. He felt he didn?t look good. Was Grant worth the trouble? Absolutely. But Hitchcock's difficulties with him, and with other major stars, helps explain why, after North by Northwest, he often tended to work with newer or less expensive stars in such movies as Psycho, The Birds, Marnie, Topaz, Frenzy and Family Plot. Interestingly enough, the only other time that Hitchcock after Cary Grant worked with a big star was with Paul Newman and Julie Andrews on Torn Curtain. Apparently, he wasn't thrilled with either of them. Perhaps it's true that on a Hitchcock picture, there was only room for one star? Hitchcock himself.\n\nOctober 23 - 2001\n\n[Professor Leitch has indeed written an encore piece, which we'll publish soon. Today and tomorrow, though, Stephen Rebello returns to provide some little-known tidbits about actor Cary Grant.]\n\nAlfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant stand as one of movie history's most emblematic and ideal director-actor pairings. In Suspicion, To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest, Hitchcock adroitly exploited not only the actor's impeccably suave exterior and likeability but also a streak of ruthlessness, a sexual and moral complexity, that seemed to roil under Grant's carefully-maintained screen image. As an icon and as an actor, Grant was and is, simply, irreplaceable. If Hitchcock had his way, the star might have also joined him on several others of his projects, including a period romantic adventure based on the exploits of the rakish highwayman Jack Shepherd, as well as Rope, in which Grant was Hitchcock's first choice to play the college professor whose teachings help inspire two of his most brilliant students to kill a fellow student for thrills. After North by Northwest, Grant was also on the minds of Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman when they began plotting a project about a blind jazz musician who regains his sight after an eye operation only to find himself pursued by a killer. The project never came to fruition and neither, at least for Grant, did the possibility of his being the leading man in The Birds and Marnie (Rock Hudson was also offered the role of the Philadelphia book publisher). Then, again, the off-screen Grant was elusive, skittish, and indecisive. The list of movies to which he apparently committed only to back out at the last moment includes Sabrina, A Star Is Born, Some Like It Hot and My Fair Lady, to name a mere few. For To Catch a Thief in 1955, Hitchcock virtually had to coax Grant out of one of his series of self-imposed retirements; the fifty-one-year-old international star and sex symbol already thought himself too senior to be believable as a romantic leading man on screen, particularly opposite someone as spectacular as the twenty-seven-year-old Grace Kelly. Three years later, during casting for North by Northwest, the wooing process took the persuasive Hitchcock even longer. In researching the production history of that film for a book-length study, I learned through Hitchcock's notes that other possibilities for the leading male role included Frank Sinatra, William Holden, Dean Martin and James Stewart (though the director thought his Vertigo star too old). Tomorrow: Grant's darker side.\n\nOctober 22 - 2001\n\n[Editor's note. We seem to be getting through our guest-list at a rate of knots! Today's guest, Thomas M. Leitch, teaches English and Film at the University of Delaware. He is the author of the stimulating book 'Find the Director and Other Hitchcock Games' (1991) which even manages to include commentary on the unmade The Short Night. Professor Leitch has told us that if we mention that he is also the author of 'The Alfred Hitchcock Encyclopedia', forthcoming from Facts on File, he might write us an encore to today's entry - which is a book review.]\n\nHitchcocks work for television, from the hundreds of episodes of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' and 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' he introduced to the twenty television segments he directed himself, has always gotten short shrift from critics. Now comes a book that goes a long way toward redressing that neglect. 'The Alfred Hitchcock Companion', a profusely illustrated, doorstop-sized guide by Martin Grams, Jr., and Patrik Wikström (OTR Publishing, P.O. Box 252, Churchville, MD, 21028, $29.95 paper) makes thousands of details about Hitchcocks television programs public for the first time. Grams and Wikström have produced a prodigiously informative volume, vastly more comprehensive than its predecessor, John McCarty and Brian Kellehers 1985 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents'. A series of essays detailing Hitchcocks abortive attempts to host his own radio program, his relationships with AHP/AHH producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd, his working habits, and the critical and financial fortunes of the two programs set the stage for the main course: detailed synopses, complete cast credits, and transcriptions of each of Hitchcocks classic introductions and conclusions (including alternate versions that were recorded but not aired) for every episode, interspersed with interviews with technicians and stars of particular episodes. For the first time, fans can trace Hitchcocks facetious running battle with his unnamed sponsor or consult a 31-page index that will direct them, for example, to every one of the ten roles Patricia Hitchcock (who also contributes a brief introduction) played in her fathers television series. Nobody would want to read these closely-printed 658 pages straight through; its as a reference, not a critical study, that Grams and Wikström are most useful. And their volume has some surprising flaws for a reference book. The many photographic illustrations - studio portraits, stills from the series, backstage shots, and images of Hitchcock delivering his incomparably deadpan introductions - are fascinating, but poorly reproduced. Theres a shower of typos: names and obscure words are too often misspelled, and some of the indexs page references turn out to be inaccurate. And many pages are missing their numbers - a lack that can make tracking down particular items frustrating. The main limitation of the book, however, is its title, which doesnt begin to do justice to the wide range of material on display here, from Ken Kaffkes essay on the connection between Hitchcock and 'Mad' magazine to Grams and Wikströms comprehensive list of Hitchcock anthologies. Their volume, which immediately becomes the point of departure for future studies of Hitchcocks television work, should go a long way toward bringing that work out of the closet.\n\nOctober 17 - 2001\n\n[François Truffaut's La Sirène du Mississippi/Mississippi Mermaid (1969) reminds Inge Izzo of Hitchcock not just because it's based on a Cornell Woolrich novel and the Catherine Deneuve character is duplicitous, but also because Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a man who willingly, and lovingly, would die at his wife's hands. The Woolrich novel is called 'Waltz Into Darkness', a title that also fits Suspicion ...]\n\nWhen Johnnie, in Suspicion, arrives home from (supposedly) London, he probes Lina with questions. Did she tell the police about the corporation and his partnership with Beaky? What else did she tell them? That she was expecting him back from London any minute. Upon hearing this, Johnnie picks up the phone and calls the police (proactive as always). Unknowingly, though, he puts his foot in it by saying he stayed at his club. Now, Lina had earlier checked, and he was definitely not at his club. What should we make of this? Of course he later has a ready story for Lina about being in Liverpool. But why was he questioning her so closely? Also, he energetically and righteously condemns the mystery Englishman who took the brandy-bet with Beaky - but hey, wasn't Johnnie a betting man? These self-confident histrionics make us recall Beaky's enthusiasm about Johnnie's charm: he could lie his way out of anything, and what's more, he was so good that he was a treat to watch. Such details, placed at intervals throughout the film, are much more disturbing than if they were clustered around a final showdown. As for Lina, she has shown us that she is half in love with easeful death - if it were to be inflicted by the man she loves, Johnnie - by murmuring to Isobel, 'Is whatever it is painful?' François Truffaut made a film on a similar situation, Mississippi Mermaid. There we see Jean-Paul Belmondo ready to die (of poisoning) at the hands of his beautiful mail-order bride Catherine Deneuve. All very romantic! But back to Johnnie. Even the last image of the couple reunited is far from reassuring. It is Lina who (wilfully?) insists on starting anew, whereas Johnnie's final words are 'No, Lina, no.' At least he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Is Johnnie's arm around Lina really a comforting gesture, or is he merely going to bide his time until he can engineer another death and collect, rather than borrow on, his wife's life insurance? We know that Hitchcock wasn't allowed to make Cary Grant a murderer, but we May feel that he has just about kept his cake and eaten it too.\n\nOctober 16 - 2001\n\n[Inge Izzo comments further on the teasing nature of Suspicion ...]\n\nSuspicions, in Suspicion, are raised by cinematographic means ... Typically Hitchcock composes the frame so that our perceptions are coloured, and intensified, and we fall into the trap of all-but condemning Johnnie out of hand - that's to say, we are never dispassionate (with the result that we are constantly being tossed on waves of emotion like corks on the ocean). The classic instance of this is the scene with the glass of milk: the viewer's eye is directed to the luminous white glass lit from within by a torch globe, so that our whole attention is focussed at that one point. It is our heightened awareness (awakened earlier by talk of untraceable poisons: Hitchcock sets his trap carefully, and we fall into it most willingly!) that causes us to see Johnnie as a murderer, but in reality mightn't he be just a solicitous husband bringing his overwrought wife a nightcap? We suspect the milk is poisoned but we will never know for sure. It is the framing and lighting of the image, the looming shadow, the close-up of the clock, the fractured waltz of the soundtrack, which call forth our emotional response. There are thus two parallel stories running through the film, and we should have been alerted to this at the outset when Johnnie played with the two phrases 'kill you/kiss you'. At every heightened moment we believe Johnnie capable of planning murder. But at the same time, if we step back from this heightened cinematic intensity and shake off Hitchcock's magic, we could easily argue in favour of Johnnie's innocence - even generosity and concern towards Lina and Beaky. The film, true to its title (cf. Shadow of a Doubt), teases us continuously: we can never be sure. There are also actual details rather than cinematographic effects which seem to condemn Johnnie. For example, the job-offer letter from Captain Melbeck which Johnnie produces for Lina is shown in close-up but it is half-folded as if purposely hiding its true recipient. Also, Johnnie becomes uncharacteristically angry when Lina interferes with his and Beaky's real estate plans. And lastly, who was the 'Awlbeam, or Holebeam' mentioned by the French police as having given Beaky the fatal brandy, if not 'old bean' Johnnie? Sure, this was a familiar term at the time, but our ear has become so used to Beaky's repetitive use of it that we clamour for an explanation that will either incriminate or exonerate Johnnie. Let's not forget too that Beaky died before dissolving the partnership with Johnnie, so the latter stood to gain something from his death. All this is left hanging. Maybe Johnnie is indeed one of the 'happy murderers', alluded to by Isobel, walking around free and undetected.
