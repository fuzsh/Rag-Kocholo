        "text": "Synopsis\n\nTrouble erupts in a small, quiet New England town when a man's body is found in the woods. The problem is that almost everyone in town thinks that they had something to do with his death.\n\nProduction\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had read Jack Trevor Story's short comic novel \"The Trouble with Harry\" when it was published in 1949 and considered it would make a good black comedy.\n\nWhilst talking about the film to François Truffaut, Hitchcock said:[1]\n\nI didn't change [the novel] very much. To my taste, the humor is quite rich. One of the best lines is when old Edmund Gwenn is dragging the body along for the first time and a woman comes up to him on the hill and says, \"What seems to be the trouble, Captain?\" To me that's terribly funny; that's the spirit of the whole story.\n\nI've always been interested in establishing a contrast, in going against the traditional and in breaking away from clichés. With \"Harry\" I took melodrama out of the pitch-black night and brought it out in the sunshine. It's as if I had set up a murder alongside a rustling brook and spilled a drop of blood in the clear water. These contrasts establish a counterpoint; they elevate the commonplace in life to a higher level.\n\nIn his memoirs, producer Herbert Coleman asked Hitchcock why he had chosen the story:[2]\n\nI've always wanted to do a black comedy. This story is perfect for that. We'll make Harry [...] a low budget film. Without high-price stars. We'll cast it with New York stage actors.\n\nPre-Production\n\nAfter the box-office success of Rear Window and the glossy To Catch a Thief, Paramount were seemingly doubtful of the commercial appeal of the story and the budget was set at a modest $1,000,000 — less than a third of the budget of To Catch a Thief.[3]\n\nScreenplay\n\nthe Vermont countryside\n\nBefore departing for France to film To Catch a Thief in early 1954, Hitchcock handed the novel to John Michael Hayes to begin an adaptation. Although Hayes was keen to add a some extra action and suspense to the story, Hitchcock insisted on remaining faithful to the novel, and much of the film's dialogue is lifted verbatim. The only major change was relocating the location of the story from the English countryside to New England.[4]\n\nThe Hitchcocks had travelled through New England in 1951 and the director felt the autumnal colours of Vermont would act as a good counterpoint to the more macabre elements of the story.[5]\n\nWith Hayes' script nearing competition, Hitchcock attended to the small matter of actually acquiring the rights to the novel and instructed MCA agent Herman Citron to negotiate a purchase. Without mentioning the director's name, Citron purchased the rights for $11,000.[6][7]\n\nCasting\n\nGrace Kelly was initially approached for the role of Jennifer, but a contract dispute with MGM meant she would be unavailable. Hitchcock also considered the French actress Brigitte Auber — who had played the role of Danielle Foussard in To Catch a Thief — but her accent was a cause for concern.[8]\n\nthe cast of 'The Trouble with Harry'\n\nWhilst in New York with his wife, Herbert Coleman's daughter had recommended that they see the Broadway musical The Pajama Game, starring Carol Haney. Coleman was so impressed with the leading lady's performance that he visited her backstage, only to discover that he'd actually been watching Haney's understudy on stage — Shirley MacLaine. Coleman quickly arranged a screen test for MacLaine and her lack of film acting experience appealed to Hitchcock: \"All this simply means that I shall have fewer bad knots to untie\".[9]\n\nAlthough Cary Grant was briefly considered for the male lead, the film's budget wouldn't stretch to Grant's usually salary demands. Hitchcock also approached William Holden, but he wasn't available. Whilst in New York, Hitchcock met with and cast John Forsythe, who had previously appeared several times in the Suspense radio series, which was a favourite of the director.[10]\n\nFor the role of the retired captain, Hitchcock cast his old friend Edmund Gwenn, who appeared previously in The Skin Game, Waltzes from Vienna and Foreign Correspondent. Other roles were filled by accomplished Shakespearean actress Mildred Natwick, in the role of spinster Miss Gravelly, and the 7-year-old Leave It to Beaver star Jerry Mathers as the boy who discovers the body of Harry at the start of the film.\n\nLocations\n\nthe Congregational Church in Shanon, Vermont, which appears in the opening sequence\n\nHitchcock had initially planned to shoot the majority of the film — 23 days out of the 30 day schedule — on location, so producer Herbert Coleman and production manager \"Doc\" Erickson scouted for suitable scenic locations in Vermont around St. Johnsbury and Stowe. Unfortunately, a storm blew through the area at the start of September 1954, leaving trees bare, followed by heavy rain that washed out local roads. The start of filming was delayed whilst Coleman and Erickson searched for new locations untouched by the storms.[11][12][13]\n\nBy late September, with the help of Clifford Miskelley, the head of the Vermont Development Commission, the area around East Craftsbury and Craftsbury Common had been deemed suitable by Coleman and Erickson, which allowed the production to commence.[14][15]\n\nMost of the cast and crew stayed in The Lodge at Smugglers' Notch, near Jeffersonville.[16][17][18]\n\nPrincipal Photography\n\nVermont\n\non location in Vermont\n\nWith the weather unseasonably inclement for the time of year, a temporary indoor \"cover set\"[19] was built in an American Legion gymnasium in nearby Morrisville to allow filming to continue when it was too overcast outside. Unfortunately, it transpired that when heavy rain fell on the gymnasium's roof, the noise was picked up on the soundtrack, meaning that all dialogue had to be re-recorded later on.\n\nOn the morning of 12th October, whilst filming inside the gymnasium, a crane-mounted VistaVision camera broke free of it's fixings and crashed to the floor. The camera glanced Hitchcock's shoulder and pinned crew member Mike Seminerio to the floor, but neither was injured seriously by the accident.[20]\n\nWhen weather permitted, scenes were shot outdoors, however it became increasingly apparent that many of the exterior scenes would need to be filmed back in the studio, using rear projection when necessary. Paramount art director John B. Goodman hastily constructed a set with artificial foam rubber trees and replicated the hillock on which Harry's body is found. According to John Forsythe and John Michael Hayes, crates of leaves were shipped back to Paramount so that the on-set trees could be dressed.[21][22]\n\nThe location shooting also placed a strain on actor Edmund Gwenn, then 79 years old and suffering from acute arthritis. According to producer Herbert Coleman, Gwenn had great difficulty standing up and scenes were edited to try and hide this.[23][24]\n\nBy mid-October, location filming was abandoned and the majority of cast and crew returned to Hollywood. A small second unit, headed by producer Herbert Coleman, remained behind to capture the remaining exterior landscape shots, using stand-in doubles for the actors.[25]\n\nParamount Studios\n\nBack at Paramount, filming progressed quickly and principal photography was completed on Wednesday October 27th.[26]\n\nPhilip Truex, who played the body of Harry in Vermont, was unavailable for studio work, so a stand-in was used for the remaining shots of Harry's body, which were all framed to avoid showing the face.[27]\n\nThe Production Code\n\nthe Captain rests his arm\n\nAs with To Catch a Thief, the film's risqué dialogue and macabre humour pushed at the limits of what was deemed acceptable under the Production Code. To minimise the risk associated with costly reshoots to appease the censors, several scenes were shot with alternative action, including:[28]\n\nthe scene where Edmund Gwenn rests his arm on the bosom of the ship's figurehead\n\nthe scene where the short-sighted doctor trips over Harry's body\n\nPost-Production\n\nPost production of The Trouble with Harry — which lasted throughout November and December 1954 — overlapped with that of To Catch a Thief and required extensive redubbing of the scenes shot in the noisy gymnasium.[29]\n\nSteinberg's title sequence\n\nInitially, Hitchcock had wanted to use stop-motion photograpy of tree leaves budding for the opening credits, before deciding just to use footage of autumnal woodland. New Yorker artist Saul Steinberg was paid $3,000 to draw the title sequence in the faux-naïf style of Paul Klee.[30][31]\n\nPost production of the film was completed in time for Christmas and the Hitchcocks celebrated by holidaying in Europe.[32]\n\nThe Score\n\nWith Lyn Murray tied up scoring To Catch a Thief, he recommended his friend, Bernard Herrmann, with whom Hitchcock was extremely keen to work. Although Herrmann and Hitchcock had vastly differing temperaments, Herrmann later recalled they shared \"a great unanimity of ideas\".[33]\n\nAccording to Herrmann biographer, Steven C. Smith, Herrmann re-purposed — with permission — music originally composed for the CBS radio series \"Crime Classics\", as well as composing new material for the film.[34]\n\nThe popularity of the score led to Herrmann composing the short suite \"A Portrait of Hitch\", which he dedicated to Hitchcock:\n\nEveryone must be aware that Alfred Hitchcock appears in all his films, if only momentarily, and his caricature of himself is well known. With this in mind, I was inspired to compose a musical portrait of Hitchcock. The music I wrote for \"The Trouble with Harry\" furnished the ideal motifs and tunes for this piece. The film is in many ways the most personal and the most humorous of Hitchcock's entire output. It is gay, funny, macabre, tender and with an abundance of his sardonic wit. I hope that my interpretation of these moods will in turn be transformed into a portrait of \"Hitch\".\n\n— Bernard Herrmann[35]\n\nHerrmann went on to score all of Hitchcock's films through to Marnie (1964).\n\nReception\n\nthe state dinner in Barre, Vermont\n\nThe première of The Trouble with Harry was held in Barre, Vermont on Friday 30th September, 1955 and began with a state dinner hosted by the Governor of Vermont, Joseph B. Johnson. Cliff Miskelley, who had originally suggested East Craftsbury as an ideal location to Herbert Coleman, was the Master of Ceremonies and Hitchcock was made an \"Honorary Citizen and Mayor of Barre\".[36]\n\nTypically, the release of a Hitchcock film was preceded by an advertising campaign and then followed by a publicity tour in which Hitchcock toured, attended premières and gave press interviews. With Paramount concerned about the commercial appeal of the film, they requested a low-key launch with no accompanying tour, hoping for \"word of mouth\" publicity. As Hitchcock was already busy with the pre-production of The Man Who Knew Too Much remake, he agreed the studio's request.\n\nWhen The Trouble with Harry was released to US theatres, it was preceded by a short 3 minute film directed by Hitchcock entitled \"Vermont the Beautiful\", intended to promote tourism to the state.[37]\n\nAlthough the film performed disappointingly at the US box office — it was the only one of Hitchcock's Paramount films that failed to generate a domestic profit on initial release — it proved extremely popular in England and France, where the black humour was more appreciated.\n\nDigging up a dead body and pulling it around, taking it different places, is not considered funny, except by the British and some of the Europeans. But in the United States, death is not considered funny.\n\n— John Forsythe[38]\n\nThe Hitchcocks undertook an international publicity tour for the film during November and December 1955, telling press that he had considered making his customary cameo appearance by playing the role of Harry himself — \"But it is almost impossible to direct on your back\".[39]\n\nThe tour was notable for the fact that it was feared for two days that the plane carrying the Hitchcocks from India to the Far East might had crashed in the Bay of Bengal after it failed to arrive into Singapore on Saturday 3rd December. Eventually news emerged on the Monday that the take-off had been heavily delayed by technical problems and then had to return to Calcutta when the pilot reported more engine problems. Due to local immigration procedures in India, the passengers were forced to remain on the aircraft until further repairs were completed.[40]\n\n1963 re-release poster\n\nWhen the film was re-released in 1963, as a double-bill with the 1950s remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, US audiences were much more receptive to the black humour in the film — partly because Hitchcock's droll \"gallows humour\" had proved so popular in the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television episodes.\n\nInfluence\n\nThe film's primary influence was on the style of the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series, which premièred in October 1955. When writer James Allardice, who penned all of Hitchcock's introductions and conclusions for the series, asked the director for guidance on the tone of the monologues, Hitchcock requested that they be in the style of The Trouble with Harry.\n\nSee Also...\n\nFor further relevant information about this film, see also...\n\n1000 Frames of The Trouble with Harry (1955)\n\narticles about The Trouble with Harry (1955)\n\nawards and nominations\n\nbooks about The Trouble With Harry (1955)\n\ncomplete cast and crew\n\ndocumentaries\n\nquotations relating to the film\n\nsoundtrack albums\n\ntrailers\n\nweb links to information, articles, reviews, etc\n\nBlu-ray Releases\n\nreleased in 2012\n\nThe Trouble with Harry (1955) - Universal (Blu-ray, 2012)\n\nas part of the box set: Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection - Universal (Blu-ray, 2012)\n\nDVD Releases\n\nreleased in 2006\n\nThe Trouble with Harry (1955) - Universal (USA, 2006)\n\nAmazon (USA)\n\nNTSC 1.85:1 (anamorphic)\n\nreleased in 2005\n\nThe Trouble with Harry (1955) - Universal (USA, 2005) - part of a box set\n\nAmazon (USA)\n\nNTSC 1.85:1 (anamorphic) (01:39:21)\n\n...view older DVD releases\n\nImage Gallery\n\nImages from the Hitchcock Gallery (click to view larger versions or search for all relevant images)...\n\nposters\n\nlobby cards\n\nother images\n\nFilm Frames\n\n...loading images - please wait\n\nThemes\n\ntramps - the shoe stealing tramp (Barry Macollum)\n\nThe MacGuffin - Harry's corpse\n\ntaboo: sex - The double bed\n\nthe Hitchcock cameo - walking past the artist's stall (more details)\n\nCast and Crew\n\nDirected by:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nStarring:\n\nEdmund Gwenn - Captain Albert Wiles\n\nJohn Forsythe - Sam Marlowe\n\nMildred Natwick - Miss Ivy Gravely\n\nMildred Dunnock - Mrs Wiggs\n\nJerry Mathers - Arnie Rogers\n\nRoyal Dano - Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs\n\nParker Fennelly - Millionaire\n\nBarry Macollum - Tramp\n\nDwight Marfield - Doctor Greenbow\n\nShirley MacLaine - Jennifer Rogers\n\nProduced by:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nHerbert Coleman - associate producer\n\nWritten by:\n\nJack Trevor Story - original novel\n\nJohn Michael Hayes\n\nPhotographed by:\n\nRobert Burks\n\nEdited by:\n\nAlma Macrorie\n\nMusic by:\n\nBernard Herrmann\n\nCostume Design by:\n\nEdith Head\n\nProduction Design by:\n\nJohn B Goodman - art director\n\nHal Pereira - art director\n\nNotes & References\n\n↑ \"Hitchcock\" - by François Truffaut, chapter 11\n\n↑ The Man Who Knew Hitchcock: A Hollywood Memoir (2007) by Herbert Coleman, page 193\n\n↑ Producer Herbert Coleman recalled in his memoirs that Hitchcock had told Paramount management he could make the film for $450,000.
