        "text": "Aaron Breck Gordon. Badge for House Dun Tyr. Sable, an arch between two towers argent, charged on the arch with an increscent sable, all between in pale a griffin segreant Or, maintaining two swords proper, and a dragon dormant to sinister Or.\n\nThere was a virtually unanimous opinion among the commentors that this is too complex for a badge. As no intended meaning was given for the name, it is difficult to tell whether it would be acceptable. If the name is meant to mean \"House Dun-coloured Clothing\", the forms are correct and there is no conflict, but the name does not make a great deal of sense. If it is meant to be Welsh, the vowels are not quite right and the components would have to be switched in position which would bring it into conflict with the Barony of Tir-y-Don. . . If it is meant to be Gaelic, \"Dun\" would mean \"hill\" but it is not clear what the second component would mean unless they really want \"tur\" (=\"tower\") for something like \"Tower Hill\". (02/1989)\n\nAarquelle, Shire of. Device. Argent, on a pile inverted throughout azure between a fountain and a laurel wreath azure, an eagle displayed argent.\n\nNote that what was drawn on the emblazon was not a fountain which is, by definition, composed of an equal number of bars wavy (usually six). However, given the group name, we had to assume that a fountain was indeed intended and, under Rules AR 1c, may not be placed on either an azure or an argent field: the visual effect is that of three barrulets wavy couped azure floating isolated on the argent field. The device also conflicts with that of Raim y Hynndyll (\"Argent, on a pile inverted azure a lyre argent. \"). It should be observed that, although two different charges on either side of a pile charged with a third type of charge was not been specifically banned at the time three different charges on a field or three different charges on a pile were banned, this is visually three different charges on a divided field and clearly violates the spirit of the rules. (03/1987)\n\nAbaigeal Fairchild. Device. Quarterly vert and gules, five hearts, conjoined in annulo, bases to center, Or, voided vert, all within a bordure Or.\n\nOn the letter of intent, the charge conjunction was blazoned as \"a rose Or, each petal charged with a heart and seeded of a star vert\". This does not accurately represent the depiction here which is not really that of a heraldic rose, lacking as it does the barbing. The blazon of the local herald given on the letter (\"5 hearts in annulo, points to center, Or, voided vert\" is far more accurate, were the charges alone considered. However, for this to be totally accurate, the area at the center of the shield would have to be divided quarterly as is the remainder of the field and it is not: it is vert. All in all, this is not period style. Leaving aside the issue of whether a single heart is too complex to fimbriate under the new rules, there is no doubt that the \"voided heart\" effect is too complex, especially when the hearts are conjoined in this unusual manner to form a pseudo-rose. The anomaly of the field tincture at the center of the field only increases the difficulty of identification here: even if you try and call it a single rose, there is substantial agreement in the College that the petals of a rose should not be voided, whether or not it is so blazoned. . . (01/1990)\n\nAbd Adin Tinkar. Name and device. Per bend sinister wavy argent and azure, a winged torch and a winged bull rampant, each with wings elevated and addorsed, counterchanged.\n\nDespite Brigantia's statement in his letter of reply, the submittor's documentation does not show either that the formation of the name elements is \"period spelling\" or that the name is properly formed for Arabic practice. On the original letter of intent it was stated that the name \"Abd Adin\" was Arabic for \"servant of the faith\". Obelisk has demonstrated that this is incorrect (the first element is Arabic, the second is Hebrew, the latter fact being confirmed by Xeroxes included in the submittor's own documentation packet). Moreover, if the name were properly formed in Arabic, it would usually be formed with an article prefixed to the noun used and that noun would not be a proper name (the formation would probably be \"'Abd-al-Din\"). The Arabic formation \"abd\" is prefixive and functions similarly to a preposition or patronymic particle and thus under NR4 the Arabic \"abd\" should not be randomly combined with Hebraic \"Adin\", even if the latter were not a proper name. Additionally, \"Adin\" in Hebrew does not mean \"faith\", but rather is adjectival and means \"voluptuous\" (Odelain and Séguineau, Dictionary of Proper Names and Places in the Bible, p. 12) which would give quite a different meaning to the name, even if it were linguistically permissible. Finally, the submittor, who is female, should be warned that the names in \"abd\" were all masculine and it would be against either Arabic or Turkish practice for a woman to use such a name. It should be noted that no documentation was given for the Turkish byname beyond Xeroxes of dictionary pages showing \"tin\" and \"kâr\" as existing words in modern Turkish. No evidence was provided to support the construction of bynames in Turkish from the unmodified conjunction of two nouns. In fact, the word does appear as an orthographic variant of \"tinker\" dated to 1533 in the OED, but that form is not at all related to any Turkish original and has quite a different meaning. Unfortunately, since the submittor would accept no changes whatsoever to her name, we were compelled to return the submission as whole. (03/1988)\n\nAberafonydd, Shire of. Name and device. Or, a saltire wavy azure, surmounted by a laurel wreath vert, between four hop cones azure.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a case where the rules technically require a return of the name since it is a direct translation of the name of the Shire of Riversmeet in the Kingdom of the East. However, it has previously been ruled that translations of such generic names as these may be registered if the group with which it conflicts gives permission and we would suggest that Dragon approach the Shire of Riversmeet for such permission. Unfortunately, if the saltire is drawn with appropriate thickness, rather than as the conjunction of thin lines used on the emblazon the laurel wreath vert will almost completely fade into the azure saltire (it is nearly unidentifiable as it is). (11/1987)\n\nAbertridwr, Canton of. Name only.\n\nThere was a substantial feeling that this name conflicted by translation with the Barony of Three Rivers in Calontir. The problem of the Shire of Riversmeet (East) was also raised by several of the Laurel staff. (02/1988)\n\nAbrana von Sturzenhofacker. Name and device. Pily barry argent and vert, an Arabic rose and on a chief embattled purpure, three rivenstars elongated to base Or.\n\nThe documentation provided for the name as a Spanish feminine form of Abraham was Sisneros and Torres Spanish Given Names in New Mexico which by definition considers out of period names. While there was considerable discussion of the \"compatibility\" of the name, noone could document it from period. As it is, we are talking about a supposed feminine form from an undocumented masculine period form for a name which was not popular outside orthodoxly Jewish circles in period Spain (in which it would hardly have been used by a female!). Moreover, the normal Spanish forms for Abraham today, according to several modern naming sources, are Abram, Abraham and Abrahan, none of which have the terminal \"o\" to modify to \"a\" in a feminine form. As noted on the November, 1989, letter when Katrine Stürzenhoffacktor's name was accepted, the documentation of a family name from modern immigration documents such as those used on the letter of intent is dicey: \"even for the names used in the nineteenth century, because most clerks filling out the forms did not speak the languages in which the names were generated (anyone who has looked at the immigration records of those coming from Ireland, let alone eastern Europe, will know what we mean!). In this case, we have not been able to find anything like this name as a place name, much less one with the meaning given on the letter of intent ('fallen castle land'). However, when the usual 'sound slips' for nineteenth�century transcription are applied, the name does follow a well�known, if late period, occupational format for someone running a farm or estate. In this case, the actual form would combine 'Stürze' (meaning a 'fall', either literally or in the sense of ruins), 'Hof' (meaning a 'farm') and 'Faktor' (meaning a 'factor') for 'Stürzenhoffaktor'. With such a usage the preposition would naturally be dropped in period usage.\" While Silver Trumpet is correct in saying that it is not necessarily true that use of a distinctive charge must be limited to the individual or group who uses it first, in this case the issue of style intervenes. The submittor here proposes to use a slightly more complex variant of the \"rivenstar\" with six points (four greater and two lesser) as tertiary charges, i.e., where their identifiability would be diminished because of smaller size. While it is clear that the use of the \"classic rivenstar\", registered to the Barony of Rivenstar in August, 1979, would be \"grandfathered\" for that group, it does not seem that the modified \"rivenstar\" used here meets the standards for style that we have required for some time in Society heraldry. Even if it did, used as it is here, in a design that includes three different type of charges, two of which are variant forms of unusual charges, four tinctures and a visually distracting field combination, the \"rivenstar\" only adds to the excessive complexity of the device. Note that the primary charge has been previously registered in 1981 for Babur ibn Yesugai and Kaidu ibn Yesugai as a \"Mamluk rosette\" (not an Arabic rose) based on an illustration in Mayer's Saracenic Heraldry. (05/1990)\n\nAchbar ibn Ali. Device. Gules, a dragon statant erect affronty, head to dexter, wings displayed, Or, pierced through the chest with a sword sable.\n\nUnder both rules this conflicts visually and technically with Geoffrey Mandragora (\"Gules, a wyvern displayed Or charged with a rose sable.\"). Under the old rules, there would be at most a minor for type of monster. The weight to be attributed to the sword is dicey since its depiction is somewhat non�standard. However, its weight is clearly no more than that of a tertiary. Thus under the old rules it would give no more than a minor for change of type, yielding in toto two minors from Geoffrey's device. Under the new rules, even if one grants a difference for the type of monster, the same conflict exists. Note that the position of the monsters is essentially identical in both devices, although they are blazoned differently. (04/1990)\n\nAchmed Al'Gran Shaban. Change of name from Babur ibn Yesugai.\n\nThe commentors were totally unable to provide any evidence for \"Al'Gran\" as meaning \"left-handed\". Star noted that a thorough search of all his sources showed no Persian or Arabic words beginning with \"gr\". Moreover, the term that appears for the left hand in the Persian dictionaries that could be consulted appears to be \"dast-i chap\". The name could be registered as \"Achmed Shaban\" (= \"Achmed the Shepherd\"), but the submittor allowed no changes to his name save to form a holding name. Since this was a name only submission, no holding name could be formed. (12/1988)\n\nAchren of the Debatable Lands. Name only.\n\nThere was a considerable consensus in the College that the name Achren was too closely associated with the non-human for use in the Society. In the submittor's own documentation, the name is only associated with women of superhuman magical powers. Other citations which suggest Achren is closely associated with the underworld (and in some sources may even be an alternate name for Arawn) made commentors uncomfortable, particularly when taken in conjunction with the vulture on the device. (12/1988)\n\nAdan Calentaur. Device. Or, six trees vert.\n\nConflict with Viedma (\"Or, an olive tree vert.\"). (08/1987)\n\nAdela Ote. Device. Per chevron gules and counterermine, a garb of oats argent.\n\nConflict under both rules with Holsheff (\"Azure, a garb argent, banded gules.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 894): the only difference is the field. (03/1990)\n\nAdelaide de Beaumont. Badge. Argent, a pimpernel barbed gules, slipped, leaved and seeded proper, within a bordure sable.\n\nThere is a conflict with the cited device of Frances la Rouge (\"Argent, a meadow beauty, blossom pendant, gules, slipped and leaved, within a bordure sable.\"). The changes in type and tincture of the flower cannot be more than two strong minors, if that. (11/1986)\n\nAdelvarg na Midnathimmel. Name and device. Sable, a wolf statant atop a rock argent.\n\nThe elements in the given name could�not be documented as name elements, rather than independent words and the period Scandinavian languages, where they were not \"borrowing\" Biblical names, generally were like Old German, Old English and Old Norse in drawing \"prothemes\" and \"deuterothemes\" from a fixed pool of words. \"Varg\" does not appear in the Old Norse tradition of naming (or as a naming element in any of the cognate languages). The Old Norse name elements for \"noble wolf\" would produce \"Adalulfr\", although Old German Adelulf would be closer in sound. Also, the preposition here should be \"av\" (cognate with English \"of\"). He should also be aware that the primary meaning of \"htmmel\" in period and modern Germanic languages seems to be \"heaven\" (as in the German phrase \"Gott im Himmel!\"). The name \"Noble wolf of the Midnight Heaven\" made several people distinctly nervous. As the wolf is distinctly secondary in importance here, there is no visual conflict with Aodh of Gloghgriffin, cited in the letter of intent (\"Pean, a wingless griffin statant upon a rock issuant from base argent.\"). However, it is technically in conflict with Walter de Montagne (\"Sable, in chief a lion passant dismembered and in base a mount argent.\"). (12/1986)\n\nAdelvarg va Midnatthimmel. Name and device. Sable, a wolf statant to sinister atop a rock argent.\n\nAlthough both name and device were listed as resubmissions on the letter of intent, the name was actually being appealed, as there was no change made from the form returned. This appeal did not address the major objection to the given name, which was that neither \"varg\" nor any cognate form appears in the fixed pool of Germanic naming elements (either as a protheme or a deuterotheme). The submittor has provided copious documentation for the use of \"Adel\" as a protheme (which was never in dispute), but no evidence that \"varg\" was ever used in period or today in place of the \"ulf\" form that is common in Germanic names as a deuterotheme. It has long been established that the use of an element with meaning in one language does not necessarily mean that a translated form can be used in the same manner in another language. His argument basically is that, since \"ulf\" means \"wolf\" and is used, \"varg\" which also means \"wolf\" should also be used. This is not a valid argument. Also, no documentation has been provided for the use of \"va\" as a prepositional form, as opposed to the more familiar \"av\" that he has documented.\n\nIn resubmitting, he has attempted to avoid conflict with Walter de Montagne (\"Sable, in chief a lion passant dismembered and in base a mount argent.\"), but beast is very definitely secondary in importance here and the conflict must be held to still exist. It also now runs into technical problems with Guillaume le Chien Blanc (\"Sable, a samoyed dog statant to sinister proper and a chief argent.\") and Haroun ibn-al-Dhib al Abyadh (\"Sable, a wolf passant to sinister argent, in base a scimitar fesswise reversed Or.\"). (11/1987)\n\nAdendra Marlan. Name and device. Sable, a ferret statant argent, orbed vert, in chief a compass star, its greater rays wavy and an increscent argent.\n\nThe given name was stated to be manufactured as a feminine variant form of Aidan. Unfortunately, not only is the formation not really plausible in terms of Irish name formation, it is actually an existing feminine Greek adjective which means \"treeless\" and thus is not permissible for registration under NR10a (\"If a proposed name is found to be an existing word or name, it is treated as such, and not considered 'made-up'.\") Perhaps the lady could be persuaded to consider the documented form \"Edana\"? The derivation given for the surname is not linguistically valid, but since \"Marland\" is documented as a family name, this would be a reasonable variant. The device runs afoul of AR6c which bans the use of three or more different types of device in an arrangement which might be regarded as a group: in the usual period arrangement of three charges, two and one, the lower charge is considerably larger in order to fill the area of the shield, as is the case here. (04/1988)\n\nAdiantum, Barony of. Badge for Fern and Quill Award. Vert, in saltire a quill and a fern frond argent.\n\nUnfortunately, Crescent was correct in feeling that this might be visually in conflict with the device of Elinor Annora ferch Llewelyn (\"Vert, two quills crossed in saltire within an orle argent.\"): the quills on Elinor's device are halfway between the quill here and the fern frond here, both of which are in the range of Society quill pen depictions, and the result is that the badge looks a great deal like Elinor's device without the orle. (05/1989)\n\nAdlersruhe, Shire of. Name only.\n\nName withdrawn at request of Star Principal Herald. (03/1987)\n\nAdria of the Crosswinds. Device. Per saltire Or and argent, a saltire azure between in fess two wolf's heads, erased and respectant, sable and in pale two garden rosebuds gules, slipped and leaved vert.\n\nThis is just too busy: there are three types of charges (with two in a single group) and six tinctures (with three in a single group), not to mention the additional anomaly of the garden rosebuds. (03/1990)\n\nAdrian Blackfire. Device. Azure, a chevron inverted throughout Or, overall a wyvern couchant coward argent.\n\nThis does in fact conflict with Karina of the Far West (\"Azure, a wyvern statant argent.\" as reblazoned elsewhere on this letter) which has a wyvern statant in almost precisely the posture that is here blazoned as couchant. The wyvern on Adrian's arms is closer to the traditional statant than couchant in any case (a wyvern couchant would be in the same posture as a dragon couchant). (11/1987)\n\nAdriana Maria Presley. Device. Sable, in pale and a chevronel between in chief three escallops and in base a frog sejant to sinister argent.\n\nHowever this is blazoned, in appearance it includes a fimbriated chief, which is not permitted for Society usage. (12/1986)\n\nAdrienne du Val des Roses. Badge for House Val des Roses. Argent, a rose purpure, barbed vert, within a bordure nebuly purpure.\n\nConflict with Alyanora of Vinca (\"Argent, a periwinkle proper.\"). Obelisk is correct in noting that the flowers are virtually identical visually. (12/1987)\n\nAedrik Thorulfsson. Device. Per bend sable and gules, a borre�style gripping beast within and grasping an annulet argent.\n\nThe gripping beast is not a consistent heraldic charge which could reliably be rendered by a competent heraldic artist. The beast on the emblazon is in fact copied from a particular broach from Rinkaby. Additionally, there is a technical conflict with Comura Shimitsu (\"Sable, two chevronels couped counter�couched within and annulet argent.\"). (11/1986)\n\nÆdrik Thorulfsson. Device. Per bend sinister sable and gules, three tau crosses argent.\n\nConflict with Sean MacFflam of Ravenswaard (\"Sable, in sinister chief a tau cross argent.\"). There is a major point of difference for the number of crosses, but only a minor for the field. (03/1988)\n\nAegirjon of Cathanar. Name and device. Sable, in pale three squirrels pelts inverted in fess argent and a bezant.\n\nThe name \"Aegir\" is not Celtic, as stated on the letter of intent. Instead, it is the name of the Norse god of the sea, and such, is not eligible for use in the Society unless it has been documented to be used by normal human beings in period. Such documentation has not been forthcoming. The squirrel pelts are not standard heraldic charges and are not identifiable without the blazon (one member of Laurel staff blazoned this as \"three Caspars in fess\"!). If the submitter wishes to be \"squirrelly\", why not adopt the excellent suggestions of the Brachet meeting and use vair? (09/1989)\n\nÆlfgar the Pure. Device. Azure, a heron statant close Or.\n\nUnder both sets of rules this conflicts with Fithie (\"Azure, a crane argent.\", cited in Papworth, p. 305) and Roper (\"Sable, a stork Or.\", ibid.): there is no heraldic difference between a heron, a crane and a stork. Additionally, this representation of the bird is distinctly three-dimensional. . . (01/1990)\n\nAelfgifu of the Hazel Thicket. Device. Vair, on a chief azure, four feathers palewise argent.\n\nCrescent and Brachet are correct to cite a visual conflict with Llywelyn ap Evan (\"Per fess azure and vair ancient, three escallops in chief argent.\"): period heraldry did not really make that much distinction visually between a field divided per fess and one divided \"per chief\" (as Papworth sometimes calls it). In this case the \"enhancement\" of the line of division is even more diminished because the chief lies entirely along an azure portion of the field, which it should not. (05/1988)\n\nAelfgifu Wolfsängerin. Device. Vert, a wolf sejant ululant argent.\n\nThe device is functionally identical to the arms of de Wolf (\"Vert, a wolf sejant argent.\", as cited in Woodward, p. 228). It is also in conflict under both old and new rules with Robert Strongbow (\"Vert, a wolf rampant argent, grasping in its erect sinister forepaw a bow gules held fesswise and in its dexter forepaw a sheaf of three clothyard shafts Or, armed and flighted argent.\") as well as Gambow (\"vert, a wolf salient argent.\", cited in Papworth, p. 98). (05/1990)\n\nAlastair the Eastern Traveller. Device. Argent, a chevron inverted between a patriarchal cross gules and a plant of three thistles, slipped, proper.\n\nUnder both old and new rules this is a conflict with Grendon (\"Argent, a chevron reversed gules.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 373). (05/1990)\n\nAelfheri Lewyn de Romeilli. Name only.\n\nSadly, the submittor allows no changes, however minor, to the name as submitted. \"Ælfhere\" is a perfectly good Anglo- Saxon masculine name and the form here is presented as a \"perfectly good spelling variant\". Unfortunately, an examination of the actual citation that the submittor was using (Selten, The Anglo-Saxon Heritage in Middle English Personal Names, Vol. II, p. 14) indicates that the form terminating in an \"i\" is in fact the genitive of a Latinized form \"Ælferus\" or \"Elferus\", which is in common use in clerical contexts (Selten, ibid.). No examples of the name which we could find in the nominative (or in Anglo-Saxon) end in an \"i\". Otherwise, the name is fine, if a bit anachronistic in its components. (06/1988)\n\nAelfreda o Lyn Ewig. Device. Azure, a stag lodged and in chief a decrescent and increscent, all argent.\n\nUnder both the old rules, and the new rules, this is a conflict with Downes (\"Azure, a stag couchant argent.\", cited in Papworth, p. 59). Under the old rules there is a major point for addition of a group of secondaries (the two crescent variants form a single groups of charges). Under the new rules a single difference is derived from the same addition. (11/1989)\n\nAelfric of Purbeck. Badge. Or, fretty azure, on a pale gules, a cross potent fitchy Or.\n\nUnder both sets of rules this would be a visual conflict with Wright (\"Argent, on a pale gules, a cross crosslet fitchy Or.\", cited in Papworth, p. 1005): the two crosses are functionally identical. (01/1990)\n\nAelfric Rayden. Device. Argent, an abacus palewise within a bordure sable.\n\nAfter a comparison of the emblazons, we concluded that this was visually in conflict with the badge registered to Tadhg Liath of Duncairn (\"An abacus sable.\"): the nature of the abacus is such that the visual effect of the rotation is diminished to a great degree. (08/1989)\n\nAelfrun Errantmaid. Device. Azure, a bend sinister Or between a hedgehog statant to sinister and a quatrefoil argent.\n\nConflict with Dennis Flaxenhelm (\"Azure, on a bend sinister Or, a goblet upright sable.\"), with Blair Dubois (\"Azure, a bend sinister between a cat sejant guardant and a dove close Or.\"), and with Barbara Caballeus (\"Azure, a bend sinister Or between in chief an open book argent, leathered Or, and in base a horse trippant Or.\"). (02/1987)\n\nAelfwine the Wanderer. Device. Per fess Or and sable, a wolf rampant counterchanged.\n\nConflict with Barker (\"Per fess Or and sable, a lion rampant counterchanged.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 89). As complete difference of charge cannot exist between two quadrupeds, the technical conflict is clear and the visual conflict is striking. (08/1987)\n\nAeruin na Cantaireachet Sreagan. Device. Per bend vert and azure, a bend Or between a greyhound courant and three sheaves of three arrows argent.\n\nConflict with Floeda fram Beran Beorth (\"Per bend vert and azure, a bend between a bear passant Or and a mountain peak issuant from dexter base argent. \"): the most difference that may be derived from cumulative changes to a group of secondary charges is a major and a minor. (03/1987)\n\nAeruin na Cantairechet Sreagan. Device. Per pale sable and Or, two dragons combattant counterchanged, collared gules.\n\nThere is a conflict with Milo FitzLyon, cited on the letter of intent (\"Per pale Or and sable, two dragons combattant between two bars embattled to base counterchanged.\"): the addition of the collars is not a significant enough visual detail to add the minor point needed to clear this technically and the visual echo is very strong. Brachet is also correct in stating that this also infringes on Aaron Elvenspeed (\"Per pale vert and Or, two dragons serpentine combattant counterchanged.\"). (04/1988)\n\nÆthelflæda of Saint Hereswitha's Abbey. Device. Vert, a plate, overall a cross counterchanged argent and azure.\n\nThe arms of House (\"Vert, a cross argent.\") cannot be differenced merely by adding a roundel bearing the flag of Finland. In any case, the roundel is essentially an oddly tinctured counterchange and it is dubious whether it should be allowed more than a major point of difference under our rules. (07/1989)\n\nÆthelmearc, Consort of. Device. Gules, an escarbuncle argent within a chaplet of roses, in chief a coronet Or.\n\nIn all the pother over the proposed devices for the Heir and Heiress of the principality, the fact that this device contained a chaplet of roses more or less escaped notice. While Brigantia noted that the blazon had been selected specifically to distinguish it from the wreath of roses reserved to Queens and Ladies of the Rose, this is a distinction rather than a difference. Not only are chaplets regularly listed under \"wreath\", but several pieces of royal armoury have the wreath blazoned as a chaplet (most notably that of the Queen of the Middle). Moreover, this is depicted in much the same manner as the standard depiction of the wreath of roses on the device of the Queen of the East (albeit a bit thinner in the roses than is usual for the Queen's arms). As a territorial princess is not eligible to become a member of the Order of the Rose on the basis of her service to her principality, she may not use the wreath of roses (however blazoned) on her official or personal armoury. (04/1990)\n\nAethelred de Lowther. Device. Or, in pale six annulets sable between a pair of flaunches Or, fimbriated azure.\n\nAlthough the flaunches were blazoned on the letter of intent as \"azure voided\" they are in fact thin partial arcs of azure placed on an Or field: an almost classic instance of \"thin line heraldry\". In fact, as Crescent has noted, the voiding or fimbriating of flaunches has been banned since September, 1981: \"Flaunches voided and flaunches cotised are both non-period. . .\" (05/1988)\n\nAfonglyn, Shire of. Name only.\n\nThere documentation indicates that they wish the meaning \"River Valley\": that would be Glynafon in Welsh. The form here is the unmutated form for a place name which would mean \"valley river\". It's more common form in this meaning would be \"Afonlyn\". As there is some uncertainty whether the meaning or the name is more important to the group, we have returned the name as a whole. (04/1987)\n\nAghared Aethnen filia Cuneddae. Device. Azure, an aspen tree eradicated argent, leaved, within a bordure embattled Or.\n\nAlthough White Staff submitted new forms and indicated that the submitter would accept a raguly border in his comment letter of 1 March, 1989, this is not a valid substitute for a letter of intent which would allow for complete conflict checking. Since the submitter is not willing to agree to the conditions laid down by Derrick Gunther Valdemar for conflict with his device (\"Per pale sable and gules, a tree eradicated argent within a bordure embattled Or.\"), that conflict still stands. Given the nature of the change, pending the submission seemed inappropriate. (For those who were interested in the nature of the conditions and the reason why the submittor might refuse, the text of the condition reads: \"I agree to conflict on a condition. Any device that holds up a tree argent or Or and/or is embattled Or or argent does represent that tree of eternal life found in the holy scriptures of the Hebrews and the writtings [sic] of those followers of the only true Son of God which is Jesus Christ. The stipulation is that the lady who does wish to register this device must vow a vow to her local herald with two other nobles present and signing as witness that if ever asked what this tree represents she will answer \"The tree of eternal life which is found in heaven in care of Jesus Christ the only true Son of God. . .\". (03/1989)\n\nAgnes de Lanvallei. Device. Per chevron inverted azure and gules, a sprig of mint argent.\n\nConflict with the badge of the Atenveldt College of Bards (\"Azure, a branch palewise argent.\"). (04/1989)\n\nAgro d'Aix. Name.\n\nAgro is not a valid Latin or Greek name. Moreover, De Felice (Dizionario del Cognomi Italiani, p. 46) shows this as an Italian surname derived from an epithetic use of the adjective \"harsh\" or \"hard\". (12/1986)\n\nAhmed al-Kalbi al-Kahnzir. Name and device. Chequy vert and Or, a heart gules, pierced by a scimitar bendwise sinister inverted argent, all between in bend a crescent inverted and a boar's head couped gules.\n\nAs Star notes, the name conflicts with that of Ahmad al-Kalbi, a scribe in the service of the Caliph al-Ma'mun in the early ninth century. There was considerable feeling in the College that the use of the second byname, which means \"the Pig\", could be interpreted as offensive to those of Moslem persuasion when placed in a perfectly formed Arabic name. (Star's comment is typical, \"To use it as a name or epithet is so offensive that it is something that would not have been even considered, much less used, as a name either in period or since.\"). The device, which unites multiple unrelated design elements in a standard arrangement on a complex field comes under the heading of \"slot machine heraldry\" and is visually too complex. Additionally, the use of the inverted crescent gules and the boar's head was felt to increase the overall offensive effect with regard to Islamic beliefs. (11/1988)\n\nAidan Brandr Arinbjornson. Device. Vert, three swords in pall, hilts conjoined, blades enflamed, within a bordure of flames, all proper.\n\nAs noted by Mistress Keridwen, there is a standing precedent against the use of bordures of flame. If we may quote from the return of the device of Antoine le Rêveur in November, 88: \"Although we must admit that bordures of flame have been registered before, Hund is correct when he points out that what is depicted on the emblazon is in fact a bordure fimbriated (actually a bordure rayonny gules, fimbriated Or). It seems inconsistent to ban fimbriated bordures as non�period practise when they are plain and not to do so when they are more complex.\" In this case, the bordure of flame does not even stand as the only anomaly, but is accompanied by the three swords proper with enflamed blades in an unusual position (though one that is documented for swords in a few late period devices). The general effect is not period style under either the old rules or the new. (02/1990)\n\nAidan MacAlpin. Device. Vert, a satyr rampant to sinister argent, crined and furred sable, within a bordure rayonny argent.\n\nAlthough minor details of a charge may break tincture, the crining and furring of the beast here is not minor. The contrast between the sable of the lower extremities of the satyr and the vert of the field is so dim that lower portion of the monster fades into the field. Since the goatish nether regions of the satyr are its primary distinguishing features, this unacceptably reduces the identifiability of the primary charge. (08/1988)\n\nAilene nic Aedain. Device. Argent, a fret azure and a chief azure, fretty argent.\n\nConflict with Beltoft (\"Argent, a fret and a chief azure.\"), cited in Papworth, p. 879). (11/1988)\n\nAilis FitzUre. Name and device. Argent, a Solomon's knot azure, within three orles purpure, azure and purpure.\n\nBy the submittor's own documentation, \"Ure\" is the name of a river and cannot be used with the patronymic particle \"fitz\" (see the discussion on Eadmund FitzTonge below). The \"Solomon's knot\" is not a standard heraldic charge and no documentation has been provided for its use. Several commentors noted that from the blazon many heraldic artists would depict the \"Solomon's seal\" which is quite a different thing. Further, the use of the nested orles in different tinctures is an anomaly for period heraldic style. (02/1987)\n\nAindrea MacFirnaclachan. Name and device. Argent, a saltire vert between a pile and a pile inverted sable and in fess two thistles proper.\n\nThe patronymic is not properly formed: while there are occasional instances of patronymics formed with \"mac\" plus an occupational noun, we could find none with a a noun formation purely derived from a location. Moreover, the formation \"Fir na Clachan\" is not how Gaelic would indicate a man who lived in a stone house. The blazon does not really correctly describe the device as the sable is not really pile-shaped. The nearest blazon probably is \"Per saltire sable and argent, a saltire vert, fimbriated argent, between in fess two thistles, slipped and leaved, proper.\" However, this is not permissible since much of the \"fimbriation\" will fade into the argent portion of the field. This is not period style. (11/1987)\n\nAindreas MacRaibeart Boyd. Device. Quarterly Or and gules, a sun between three thistles counterchanged.\n\nConflicts technically with Jack Nimble (\"Quarterly Or and vert, a sun counterchanged.\"). (02/1987)\n\nAine Aislin Stirling. Name and device. Per chevron sable and argent, a chevron counterchanged between in chief a plate between in fess a decresent and an increscent argent and in base a thistle, slipped and leaved proper.\n\nAs Hund has noted, since all changes are to the secondary charges, this is in conflict with the device registered in June, 1988, for Gwenhwyfar Trelowarth (\"Per chevron sable and argent, a chevron counterchanged between a dove displayed argent and a wolf's head, erased and sinister facing, sable.\"). (03/1989)\n\nAine of the Hounds. Device. Per bend azure and ermine, in bend an Irish wolfhound's head erased and a rotweiler's head, couped and sinister facing, proper.\n\nAfter a long and difficult discussion, the force of opinion was that the use of two different varieties of dog's heads in a single group of charges reduced the identifiability of each to the point where the device was unacceptable. (05/1989)\n\nAislinn Columba of Carlisle. Device. Barry of eight Or and sable, on a chief triangular sable, a wolf passant to sinister argent.\n\nSince the difference between barry of six and barry of eight is negligible (Determination of Difference, p. 8, Dl), this conflicts with the Society device of Barry Goldman (\"Barry of six Or and sable.\"). (12/1986)\n\nAislynn Aelfbearn. Name and device. Or, a pale and on a chief gules, three tankards, lidded with boar's heads, Or.\n\nUnfortunately, the members of the College who commented that the byname is against the ban on claims of non-human descent in NR12 are technically correct. As she indicates no changes whatsoever may be made to her name, the submission as a whole must be returned. If this had not been the case, we would have modified the name to the form which was originally returned at Kingdom level (\"Ulfbearn\") since Laurel staff has been able to document the use of th \"Ulf\" instead of \"Wulf\" as a protheme in Old English sources. (07/1988)\n\nAlain de Trois Rivieres. Device. Per fess enhanced wavy purpure and azure, two seawolves combattant between a mullet and three spears issuant from base, points conjoined in fess point, Or.\n\nA complex line of division such as wavy is permitted for fields in which the divisions are of the same tincture category only in cases where the contrast between the tinctures is good and the line of division is not obscured by overlying charges. This device meets neither criterion: the contrast between purpure and azure is almost the poorest imaginable and the sea-wolves overly the line of division to such an extent that it is only by examining closely that it is possible to determine that it is not a plain line. (11/1987)\n\nAlan Lothinlarsson fra Jorvik. Badge for Kauthiflugarstaddir. Or, a housefly rampant guardant to sinister proper, garbed and capped in a jester's motley lozengy vert and gules (Musca domestica).\n\nA number of commentors had negative comments about the lack of period style in the fly and the household name, but when it comes down to it, the real problem is contrast. (After all, we do have lions playing bagpipes in the Society, don't we?. . .) The fly is proper an cannot be blazoned otherwise sine the body is blackish but the eyes are distinctly \"fly green\" and the wings are grey-white. Furthermore, motley may not be of two colours (it could be a colour and a metal). Were fly entirely sable and the motley better in contrast (e.g., argent and gules), then the badge would be more acceptable. However, we would like a bit more evidence on the proper formation of the place name, particularly the \"rogue fly\" component. (12/1989)\n\nAlan of Darkdale. Name only.\n\nUnder the old rules, this would have been a conflict with the Alan of the Dale (or Alan a'Dale) of the Robin Hood tales, since it adds only an adjective (the difference is precisely that between \"Mountain\" and \"Black Mountain\" and between \"of the dewy White Rose\" and \"of the Rose\" used as examples of conflict in the old rules). Under the Addition of One Phrase in the new rules, this is still not clear although both names have fewer than three phrases since the only difference is the addition of the adjective before the noun, which is not considered an independent phrase (V.3, p.6) is added by the addition of \"Dark\", the article and preposition specifically do not create difference. Addition of a surname here would carry it clear under both sets of rules. (11/1989)\n\nAlan of Gravesend. Device. Argent, a chevron gules, overall three piles in point counterchanged, the center one charged in chief with a cross of Calvary Or.\n\nThere was a general feeling in the College that this was non-period in style, being excessively \"op-artish\" in appearance. It is also overly complex. As Treble Clef put it, \"The field is the first layer. The chevron is the second. The piles are the third, and so the cross is the fourth layer, which is not allowed.\". (08/1987)\n\nAlan Quentin Garretson. Device. Argent, a bend sinister gules between a fleur-de-lys sable and a two-headed turtle vert.\n\nConflict with Helene of Glen Laurie (\"Argent, a bend sinister between a garden rose gules, slipped and leaved vert, and a squirrel sejant to sinister gules.\") (03/1988)\n\nAlanna of Ravenwood. Device. Argent, fretty, a raven volant to sinister sable within a bordure azure.\n\nAfter comparing the emblazons, it is clear that Crescent is correct in citing as a conflict the badge of Katherine Marie Yvonne Jette (\"Argent, an eagle volant to sinister, bearing upon its back a woman sejant to sinister, arm upraised and maintaining a flaming torch, all sable, within a bordure azure.\"). The two primary charges are so close in outline that the verbal differences between the two are visually negligible (the mass of the woman on the badge occupies the space of the upper wing on the device). Thus, although the two are blazoned quite differently, the only significant difference between the emblazons is the fretty which is not adequate difference between a Society device and Society badge. (12/1986)\n\nAlaric Dimitrievich Razvedcheckov. Device. Per chevron azure and Or, in sinister chief a demi-dragon Or.\n\nUnfortunately, Crescent and Silver Trumpet are correct in noting that, under the current rules, this conflicts with the fieldless badge of the Middle Kingdom \"A demi-dragon argent.\": since it is fieldless no difference can be given for field tincture or absolute position on the field. (08/1989)\n\nAlaric Kelson Palamon. Device. Per bend sinister vert and azure, a pile issuant bendwise sinister from dexter base gules, fimbriated, overall a hawk striking Or.\n\nWhile it is true that our rules allow ordinaries to be fimbriated, the overall effect of this device was of a field peculiarly tierced of three colours, with the bird overall. The fimbriation here is naught but \"thin line heraldry\" and it is difficult to see how it could be drawn with proper thickness without diminishing the identifiability of the bird. (06/1988)\n\nAlaric Liutpold von Markheim. Name only.\n\nThis submission was postponed on the June letter to allow further discussion by the College of the principles involved. Ultimately, the appropriate decision seemed to be to protect registered Society household names. (For a fuller discussion of the issues and a formal statement of precedent, see the section of the cover letter entitled \"On the Protection of Household Names\".) As House Markheim has been formally registered by the College (in August, 1979, as listed under the name of Waldt von Markheim in the Armorial), it is entitled to protection. (09/1987)\n\nAlaric Liutpold von Steinman. Change of device. Gules, an eagle displayed, wings inverted, on a chief embattled argent, three crosses formy gules.\n\nConflict with Stephanie of Ean Airegead (\"Gules, a dove migrant to chief and on a chief embattled argent, three tulips gules.\"). A number of us also felt rather strongly that this was visually in conflict with the arms of Poland (Gules, an eagle displayed argent, armed and crowned Or.\"), since the Or details are frequently omitted from period and modern depictions of the arms. (12/1988)\n\nAlaric of Phoenix Fens. Badge. Gules, in fess a harp and a lion rampant Or.\n\nHund and the others who called this in conflict with the familiar arms of Richard the Lionheart (\"Gules, two lions combattant Or.\") are correct: even under the old rules these famous royal arms would deserve additional protection and the only change here is the substitution of the harp for one lion. As we do not consider alternatives at the Laurel level, the mention of an alternative badge is somewhat superfluous, but it may be noted that the addition of a bordure to the current design would produce new conflicts such as Grey (\"Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure Or.\"). (01/1990)\n\nAlasdair MacDhonnchaid. Device. Argent, a thistle, slipped and leaved, proper, on a chief a demi-sum issuant from the line of division Or, all within a bordure counter-company vert and argent.\n\nThere are several problems with the device. First of all, a bordure should not surmount a chief in this manner. Secondly, the bordure countercompony of vert and argent adds an unacceptable level of complexity to the device since the vert potions of the bordure fade into the azure and the argent fades into the argent of the field, leaving an effect of isolated rectangles of tincture. Unfortunately, simplifying the device by merely removing the bordure would not resolve the difficulty since it would then conflict with Sandilans (\"Argent, a thistle vert, flowered gules, on a chief azure an imperial crown Or.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 860). (05/1987)\n\nAlasdair of Kerry. Device. Azure, a horse salient to sinister and in chief two estoiles argent.\n\nConflict with Boris of Woodland (\"Azure, a horse rampant to sinister between in chief a label throughout argent and in base a scimitar fracted in chevron inverted Or.\"). (01/1987)\n\nAlasdair Stuart Campbell. Badge for Argyllshire Highlanders. A boar's head erased close between three claymores in triangle argent.\n\nThe consensus of opinion in the College was that the conjunction of this badge, which differs by only a single point of difference from the badge of the Campbell chiefs, with the name Campbell and Argyll was presumptuous. Moreover, the name is in direct conflict with that of the actual regiment which is now known as the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (originally they were solely the Argyll Highlanders and under that name gained great fame in various parts of the British Empire). (03/1988)\n\nAlastar MacCrummin the Scot. Name and device. Argent, vetu ployé azure, a triangular trivet azure, enflamed proper, in chief two pheons inverted argent.\n\nAfter much discussion, we decided that the use of the epithet \"the Scot\" was inadvisable with the given name of three of the most famous kings of Scotland. As he did not allow any changes to his name, we could not drop the offending epithet. This device seemed to display too many anomalies to be considered consonant with period style: charging a chapé or vetu is extremely bad practise in itself and limiting the charges to the upper portion of the shield disturbs the balance of the device, the trivet is such that it cannot be clearly identified without depicting it in trian aspect and the flaming of only the legs and upper portion of the outer edge of the trivet is peculiar to say the least. (This is without considering the fact that the submittor's concept of flames proper are \"Or, fimbriated gules\", even on the argent field: that could be corrected by correct depiction of the flames.) (10/1988)\n\nAlberic Cordeau. Device. Sable, an armadillo rampant to sinister Or between four bezants in cross.\n\nWe were compelled to agree with Brachet and Treble Clef concerning the conflict with Ogle (\"Sable, five bezants in cross.\"). (09/1988)\n\nAlberic of Winter Hills. Badge for Winter Hills Holdt. Sable, a pithon erect to sinister, its dexter wing inverted and sinister wing elevated, argent.\n\nThere are three distinct problems with the badge. First of all, it is demonstrably non�period style and definitely a non�standard pithon. Secondly, as Crescent has pointed out, it is a commonly available piece of jewelry which is almost certainly in the public domain and arguably should not be reserved for use to one individual. Finally, if the pithon is drawn in a standard heraldic manner in the nearest heraldic position, there is a conflict with the device of Ferall von Halstern (\"Sable, a bearded pithon erect guardant, wings displayed, within a bordure embattled argent. Note: the submittor's personal name was stated in the letter of intent to have been registered, but we have no record of any submission passed under this name. (12/1986)\n\nAlbion Marcus Montelammartine. Name and device. Per chevron azure and Or, in chief a winged lion passant guardant, maintaining in its dexter paw a sword Or, all within a bordure compony Or and azure.\n\nThe citation from Withycombe (p. 9) used in the letter of intent to support Albion as a given name in period does not do so: what is actually said is that \"another possibly connected name is Albion, e.g., Sir Albion Richardson KC, b. 1874\". That is clearly out of period and, given the use of \"Albion\" to denote England even in Roman days, this must be considered an impermissible usage. He might do better to use a documented Latin form of the root name such as \"Albanus\", which Withycombe documents as early as 1201 (p. 9): it would go better with the second given name. The surname also has problems since it is not properly formed in either Spanish or French. If he wants proper Spanish for \"of the Mountain by the Sea\", he should use \"de Monte del Mar\". If he wants something closer to the submitted sound, he could use the actual French place name \"Montmartin sur mer\", suggested by Crescent. The use of a bordure compony where the bordure used one or both of the tinctures of the field has been banned by consensus of the College since last summer. It probably should be pointed out to the submittor that some members of the College were distinctly twitchy over the use of the winged lion of Saint Mark with the name Mark and \"by the sea\" in view of the associations of Mark as patron saint of Venice. (05/1988)\n\nAlcestis of Phoenixgate. Name only.\n\nSince Alcestis is the lady whom Hercules rescued from the underworld (in classic Greek mythological sources she is often referred to as the only \"normal\" mortal to have returned through the gates of death), using that given name in conjunction with the beast that ancient myth had dying only to rise again seemed to be too close to a claim to, if not immortality, the ability to rise from the dead. (11/1986)\n\nAldonza Dulcinea. Name and device. Argent, a bend sinister between a horse passant to sinister and a cat sejant to sinister sable.\n\nHer badge was passed under the name of Aldonza Pandora since the proposed Society name is clearly in conflict with the heroine of Cervantes' Don Quixote: both names are used for the tavern girl whom the Don chooses as the object of his chivalric adoration: the one name is her actual given name, the other her \"nom de guerre\" in his imaginary world. The peasant Aldonza Lorenzo becomes in his fantasy the aristocratic Dulcinea del Toboso. The device conflicts with Helene of Glen Laurie, cited in the letter of intent (\"Argent, a bend sinister between a garden rose gules, slipped and leaved vert, and a squirrel sejant to sinister erect gules: the maximum difference which may be derived from changes to a single group of secondary charges is a major and a minor point (DR9). (12/1986)\n\nAldred d'Inconnu. Device. Azure, on a bend sinister between a bunch of grapes and a goblet Or, a bendlet couped azure.\n\nConflict with Richard Andreivitch of Rus (\"Azure, on a bend sinister Or, an estoile sable.\"), Blair Dubois (\"Azure, a bend sinister between a cat sejant guardant and a dove close Or.\"), etc. (12/1988)\n\nAldwin Greenleaf. Device. Quarterly purpure and ermine, on a cross moline nowy argent between four unicorn's heads erased, counterchanged argent and purpure, a rose gules.\n\nWhile the secondaries have been simplified, the field has been made considerably more complex than in her previous submission, at the cost of materially reducing the identifiability of the cross, which has lamentably low contrast with half the field.When this is taken in conjunction with the overall complexity of the device (four tinctures and three types of charge with one group of charges in two tinctures), this crosses the threshold of acceptability. (03/1990)\n\nAldwin Yale of York. Badge for House Rising Star. Per bend sinister sable and Or, a compass star and a partisan counterchanged within a bordure embattled gules.\n\nWithdrawn at request of the Aten Principal Herald. (08/1988)\n\nAldwin Yale of York. Name for House Rising Star.\n\nThe household name conflicts directly with that of House Rising Star registered to Cameron of Caladoon in 1979. (09/1988)\n\nAleea Baga. Name only.\n\nThe submittor marvellously documented the elements of her name with a scholarly article from Names (the journal of the American Name Society) on Mongolian personal names. (Indeed, this article on an area for which we have so few sources was so good we might have reproduced it, at least in part, if the photocopy supplied with the forms had been better: if someone in the Eastern college has access to this article from the June, 1962 issue, we suspect many in the college would be grateful for a copy.) Unfortunately, while the examples support the usage of such elements in personal names in period, all the examples show the adjective preceding the noun and we must conclude that this is standard practise in Mongolian, at least for names.Thus the form of the name should be \"Baga Aleea\". Unfortunately, the submittor did not wish to allow any changes to the name so it could not be fully registered. (01/1990)\n\nAleen du Varnay. Blazon correction. Or, a rose gules, barbed and seeded proper, pierced by a sword fimbriated sable, all within an ivy vine in annulo vert.\n\nWhat appears on her original emblazon sheet and was reduplicated on the emblazon sheet on the letter of intent is not an annulet by any means. A note included in the paperwork stated \"should be more rounded, but she displays it correctly on her banner\". Unfortunately, we can only register what we see and the emblazon matches the current blazon better than it does the proposed modification (several commentors indicated that they had a hard time devising a reasonable emblazon which would have a true annulet around the central charges if the relative proportions were maintained). (03/1987)\n\nAlejanda Isabel Iglesias Domenench de Mac Murray. Change of name from Alejandra Isable Murray.\n\nThe submitter was appealing a modification of her name to register her device in November, 1988. Apart from a number of animadversions on the lack of expertise of the College of Arms with regard to Spanish naming practice and some statements designed to remedy this lack, the appeal consisted largely of documentation for \"Iglesias\" from the eighteenth century and \"Domenech\" from the mid-seventeenth century together with documents to show that these names were uses in the submitter's family in more recent times. While it is understandable that the submitter is proud of her Spanish heritage and wishes to incorporate allusions to this in her persona, we still need documentation of the usages here. It might be possible to give the benefit of the doubt to \"Domenech\" which is notes as Catalan and the name of somebody who entered the Order of Santiago in 1648, on the grounds that those who gained this honour were frequently of mature age and thus the name may be assumed to have been used prior to 1600. The same cannot be said to be true of Iglesias for the documentation there dates back no farther than 1768. Moreover, the submitter seems to be under a misapprehension as the usages of Spanish names in period and, to a lesser extent, in the present day. She is concerned that the name, as approved would make her the mother of her lord (who bears the surname MacMurray). That is certainly not the case. The name as approved would be correct for a late period Spanish woman married to a Scot. The submitter's argumentation states that the usage \"de MacMurray\" means \"belonging to Mac Murray\" and is necessary to indicate that she is married to (i.e., \"belongs to\" a Mac Murrary). In point of fact, as Brachet has noted, there is considerable evidence that the adoption of the husband's name upon marriage is a relatively recent phenomenon in Spain, occurring only i the last century or s. Even then, the use of \"de Mac Murray\" is something of a linguistic solecism, arising from a misunderstanding on the part of some Spaniards of the nature of the family name (there are documents in both Latin America and Napoleonic Spain which testify to clerks interpreting the names of exiled Scots as geographic entities). As the submitter notes, the patten of given name + Father's surname + conjunction + mother's surname is quite common of modern Spain, although there is some degree of doubt as to its common use in period. For most of the period, documents show a given name with a surname, often patronymic in nature, or a given name with a geographically derived byname, e.g. \"Juan del Enicina\" of \"Lucas Fernández\". In some cases, particularly where the individual was of high rank, both a patronymic and geographic byname would be used (e.b., \"Pedro López de Ayala\"). The use of the conjoint form seems to have been a later development, perhaps originally designed to show descent or inheritance from the mother when the matrical line was the more significant (a process similar to that of armorial quartering). Clearly, this occurred in period, although not so commonly as today, when it is the norm in middle and upper class Spanish families. However, we have not been able to find a single period example of the format given name + father's surname + conjunction + mother's surname + husband's surname, even if the preposition is dropped from her husband's surname. In short, the name she proposes might work in modern Spanish (although some purists might have problems with it),but it does not seem to be period style for Spanish names. (09/1989)\n\nAlejandro Arquero. Device. Sable, a dragon segreant argent, in dexter chief a rose Or, seeded gules.\n\nConflict with Alexander Greylorn (\"Sable, a dragon segreant incensed of icy breath and a chief rayonny argent.\") and Alfhild the Mad (\"Sable, a dragon rampant argent, armed Or, in chief two lymphads sailing to sinister, sails furled, flags flying and oars in motion, all Or.\"). (06/1989)\n\nAlejandro the Far Traveller. Device. Gules, on a pale bretassed argent three broken spears sable, ribboned gules.\n\nConflict with the badge of the Barony of Southdowns (\"Gules, on a pale bretassed argent, a raven striking gules.). (10/1986)\n\nAleksei Rurikov. Name only.\n\nCrescent is quite correct in indicating that the surname here is correctly formed to show descent from Rurik and the submittor's documentation indicates that it is in fact his intent to show his descent from Rurik, the original leader of the Rus. Unfortunately, this is tantamount to claiming membership in the House of Rurik, rulers of Russia from Kiev and Moscow for more than seven centuries, right down to the end of the sixteenth century. Rurik is in the same relationship here as Roman Yurievich was to the House of Romanov: logically we should protect \"Rurikov\" as we do \"Romanov\". (01/1988)\n\nAlessandra Raffaela di Luciano. Device. Azure, a swan naiant, wings elevated and addorsed, argent within a bordure Or, semy of escallops inverted azure.\n\nConflict with Sheryl of Thespis, cited on the letter of intent: \"Azure, a swan naiant argent, crowned Or.\" Sheryl's device has the swan in precisely the same posture and the echo is particularly striking. (10/1988)\n\nAlexander Baird. Device. Sable, a pall inverted of Wake knots cojoined Or, between three torteaux, fimbriated Or.\n\nThe primary issue here, as Crescent clearly indicated, is whether the pall of Wake knots could be considered acceptable for heraldic use in the Society or should come under the long- standing ban on \"knotwork\". The issue is not merely whether the charge or charges can be blazoned, as Crescent implies, but whether the charge or charges can be readily identified by the casual observer to be what they are. Commentary in the College, which was substantially opposed to dropping the ban on knotwork, reflects a reality here. While the conjoint charge can be easily blazoned, it cannot be readily identified without already being aware of the blazoning. Viewed at a distance, the central design element is as likely to be interpreted as a pall invected with some peculiar internal diapering as it is to be interpreted correctly as a conjoining of otherwise identifiable knots. When the separated knots are placed in a standard heraldic position, their familiar outline renders them identifiable. When this outline is diminished, as it is here, by reduction in size and conjoining, they are no longer clearly identifiable. This is the case with virtually all \"knotwork\", not matter how easily blazonable, and that is the most cogent reason for not permitting it in the Society. (09/1988)\n\nAlexander Chulannan. Name only.\n\nIt was the consensus of the commentors that the byname, which was presented in the letter of intent as a variant of \"Cullinan\", \"O Cuileannáin\" and \"Cullinane\", was not proved to be a valid variant. The forms presented did not have an aspirated initial letter and in a noun in apposition after a masculine noun such aspiration would be unlikely. Moreover, the switch to the internal \"a\" is not demonstrated (the old Irish forms of \"cuilean\" end in a simple \"en\" as do some later forms indicating that the \"a\" does not become dominant, particularly in the penultimate syllable). As the submittor allows no changes to the name, we have to return the name as a whole. (12/1988)\n\nAlexandre Lerot d'Avignon. Device. Purpure, on a pale between two snakes glissant palewise argent, a wolf rampant sable.\n\nConflict with Orin of the Argent Lions of Mightrinwood (\"Purpure, a pallet between two lions rampant addorsed argent. \") and Luerann Damask (\"Purpure, on a pale endorsed argent, three roses, barbed and seeded proper. \"). (03/1987)\n\nAlexandre Lerot d'Avignon. Name for House d'Avigne.\n\nSince the adjective \"avigne\" would not be preceded by the preposition \"de\", the name is incorrectly formed. Given the \"Avignon Papacy\" we felt that the change made to his personal name would not be acceptable for the household name. Unlike an individual, a house could be \"avigne\" so a household name like \"Hotel Avigne\" would be acceptable: this substitution was not made automatically so that the submittor could decide if the household name and personal name should \"match\". (03/1987)\n\nAlfred of Mercia. Name only.\n\nWhile Alfred the Great was not crowned King of Mercia, by the Peace of Wedmore he clearly became overlord of Mercia with the Ealdormen of Mercia clearly under his rule. (02/1987)\n\nAlfric Northwind. Badge. Azure, fretty, overall a compass star argent.\n\nConflict with the badge of the Barony of Rivenstar (SCA), Azure, a rivenstar argent. There is a CVD for the addition of the fretty to the field, but there was a clear consensus among those attending the meeting that there was not another for the difference between a rivenstar and a standard compass star. (06/1990)\n\nAlfric Rolfson. Device. Azure, on a fess engrailed to chief and invected to base argent, a drakkar sable, sailed gules.\n\nUnder both sets of rules this is definitely clear of De Verthon (\"Azure, on a fess argent, a bee volant en arriere sable.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 73) since there is a major change to the line of division of the fess and multiple changes to the tertiaries. The case for Anita Beaumaris (\"Azure, a fess invected between five natural seahorses, two, two, and one argent.\") and Stighull Malston (\"Azure, on a fess engrailed argent, three lozenges gules.\", as cited in Papworth, loc. cit.) is by no means as clearcut as it sounded when presented in the letter of intent. Whether changing one side of an ordinary to another similar line of division would count as a \"full weight\" minor charge under the old rules is definitely a matter for discussion. As Silver Trumpet has noted, the old rules would grant a minor for the difference between invected and engrailed, but that would apply where both sides of the ordinary differed: in this case only one side changes from each potential conflict. In the case of Stighull Malston, any difference derived from the fess might be enough technically under the old rules since the lozenges change in type, number and (partial) change in tincture would give a full point and only a major and minor were required. This would not be the case with Anita's armoury since there is only a minor for addtion of the tertiary under the old rules and a major for removal of the secondaries. Visually, since the fess here is in a sense both a fess engrailed and a fess invected, there is a very real problem under the old rules with both devices. Under the new rules, Anita's armoury is quite clear: no difference is required from the line of division since both the addition of the tertiary and the addition of the secondaries count full weight. The problem with Stighull Malston still remains, however: we would be inclined to grant difference between an ordinary invected and an ordinary engrailed on the grounds that the two were distinguished in period armoury and have traditionally be distinguished quite well in Society armoury. However, we cannot in conscience grant difference where the ordinary involves both lines of division. (02/1990)\n\nAlgrin the Dark. Device. Per bend sinister sable and Or, a tree eradicated counterchanged.\n\nUnfortunately, Seraph is correct in citing the badge of the Barony of Madrone as a technical conflict (\"A madrone tree eradicated proper.\"). (10/1988)\n\nAlienora an Coille. Device. Ermine, in pale a chevron wavy and a Catherine wheel gules.\n\nConflict with Iathus of Scara (\"Ermine, a cog wheel gules.\"): there is no way to call a full point of difference between the two types of wheel and the differences in position are derivative. (06/1988)\n\nAlina Meraud Bryte. See Gavin de Haga for household name. (11/1989)\n\nAlisane o Mynyddoed Taranllyd. Device. Sable, a saltire raguly overall a unicorn's horn palewise, all within a bordure argent\n\nThere was almost unanimous agreement amongst the commentors that so much of the argent alicorn lay on the argent saltire that it would be unidentifiable. (03/1987)\n\nAlisaundre Oliphant. Name for Maison Oliphant.\n\nThe name is in direct conflict with the Order of the Elephant, a period Danish chivalric order which was founded in 1462 is still in existence today. For those who are interested, Friar's New Dictionary of Heraldry (p. 134) gives its badge as a gold and white elephant with a black mahout, on its side a Greek cross, and on its back a red tower. (In other words, it is clear of the submitted badge for this lady under both rules.) (04/1990)\n\nAlix de Perigueux. Device. Azure, a pile inverted embattled between two fleurs�de�lys Or.\n\nTechnically, this does not conflict with the arms of France under old rules or new, but the use of the gold fleurs�de�lys on the blue field, especially in conjunction with one of the favourite period feminine names in the French royal family. Under the current rules, this is a conflict with Flaxney (\"azure, a fess between two fleurs�de�lys Or.\" cited by Dolphin, as the position changes in the fleurs are totally due to the change in ordinary. While this might clear if Laurel's proposal to the College on extending section X.2 of the rules to cases where there is a single group of identical secondaries is accepted, the submittor should be warned that many will interpret this design as a pretense to French royal status. (05/1990)\n\nAllan Grayson of Eaglescliff. Device. Per bend sinister Or and argent, a bend sinister azure surmounted by a triple-headed eagle displayed counterchanged.\n\nThere are two serious problems with the device. First, the complex counterchanging involving three colours is not period style. The parts of the eagle on the field are azure and the portion of the bird on the bend is divided per bend sinister Or and argent: the general effect is to make the charge overall unrecognizable at any distance. In any case, if it this were not the case, as Crescent and Treble Clef both have commented, the triple-headed eagle has been banned from use in the Society for nearly nine years because of its close association with the aspirations of the Holy Roman Empire (it appears in at least one period armorial as the imperial arms once Jerusalem has been reconquered). (05/1988)\n\nAllen Stuart MacClure. Device. Sable, on a fret argent, a unicorn sejant vert.\n\nAs Brachet has noted, this is in conflict with the arms of Blackmister (\"Sable, a fret argent.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 879). Also, as drawn, the green unicorn lay almost entirely on the lathes of the fret so had good contrast, but were it properly drawn overall as most Society heralds would try to draw it, it would violate the rule of tincture with the field. (08/1988)\n\nAlma Jolene Eamon. Name only.\n\nThe submittor's own name documentation for all elements was a rather dubious \"baby name book\". Members of the College did their best to document all elements of the name, but met with real success only with the common Irish given name \"Eamon\". Unfortunately, as Withycombe notes, \"Alma\" seems to have become popular as a given name in the nineteenth century after the Battle of Alma in the Crimean War. Several commentors alluded to the use of the name for the Queen of the Body Castle in Spenser's Faerie Queen, but this does not really demonstrate the use of the name in period since it is a clearly allegorical usage (\"alma\" is widely used in late medieval writings as the common Latin word for \"soul\"). Both Spenser and his audience would have understood the reference to indicate that the soul was master of the body (a nice Platonic view!): the fact that there is no evidence for the Spenserian usage having generated actual use of the name in the early seventeenth century only confirms this. The form \"Jolene\" apparently is a twentieth-century formation from popular name elements. While several commentors noted similarly pronounced diminutive forms from Joel documented as independent elements in period (see Reaney, Dictionary of British Surnames, p. 198, under \"Jolin\"), it seemed doubtful whether the submittor really wanted this masculine form for her given name. (01/1988)\n\nAlmaric von Mainze. Name and device. Chevronelly azure and argent, a lion rampant reguardant, maintaining in its dexter forepaw a sword inverted, Or.\n\nUnfortunately, there was an almost unanimous consensus that the name is in conflict with that of Alaric von Mainz, registered in December, 1988. As Star put it, \"These two names would be hard to distinguish in a small room, much less at an outdoor event.\" The device conflicts with that of William MacQueen of MacQueen (\"Per bend argent and azure, a mountain lion rampant proper.\"): while there is a major point for the difference in fields, we could not see granting a cumulative major for the changes to the lion, particularly since the sword is virtually invisible, since it lies almost entirely on an argent portion of the field. (06/1989)\n\nAlmina Inez Martyn Dorand. Name only.\n\nThe given name Almina was not adequately documented as an actual period form. The nearest related form would seem to be \"Mina\" which is only documented as an out-of-period diminutive of Wilhelmina. In any case, if the given name is in fact a valid Arabic feminine name, this name would consist of four languages: Arabic + Spanish + English + French (since the spelling of \"Dorand\" actually derives from French rather than Spanish of English). Since the lady allowed no changes to her name whatsoever, the submission must be returned in its entirety. (02/1987)\n\nal-Sahid, Canton of. Device. Sable, a tower within a laurel wreath, all within a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Shire of Scorched Earth (\"Gules, a tower within a laurel wreath all within a bordure rayonny Or.). (08/1987)\n\nAlys Katharine of Ashthorne Glen. Device. Vert, on a bend between two fleurs-de-lys Or, three Catherine wheels vert.\n\nConflict with Brendan MacUilliam \"Vert, on a bend between two trefoils Or, three Celtic harps palewise vert.\"), College of St. Brigid (\"Vert, on a bend between two straight-armed Saint Brigid's crosses Or, a laurel wreath vert.\") and David of Moorland (\"Vert, on a bend Or, three Moor's heads couped sable.\"). (08/1989)\n\nAlys Meghan Cattewynne. Badge. Gules, semy of cat's faces Or, a rose argent, barbed and seeded Or.\n\nDespite Laurel's well-known prejudice in favour of semy of cat's faces, we had to agree with Brachet that this does infringe on the white rose of York. (06/1989)\n\nAlys of Bath. Name only.\n\nAs Vesper has noted, this name is in conflict with that of a very famous Chaucerian character: \"Alison, wyf of Bath\". (Alison is a period derivative of \"Alis\" or \"Alis\".) (12/1988)\n\nAlyssa de Maris of Ravenstar. Name only.\n\nAlthough the given name was stated to be a variant of Alice, noone could document this particular variant. In both look and sound it is closer to the flower \"Alyssum\", which both in Greek and Latin refers to the plant which the ancients felt cured hydrophobia. In fact, in classical Greek there is an adjective, whose feminine form is identical to the proposed given name, which means \"curing madness due to hydrophobia\". (12/1987)\n\nAmalia Silvia. Device. Per saltire gules and Or, an acorn, slipped and leaved, proper between in chief two mullets in fess and in base a crescent argent.\n\nWhile the leaves are on the metal portion of the field and create no problem, the predominantly brown acorn (only the nut itself is Or, the cup and slip are brown) fades into the gules portion of the field. Note also that the two mullets in chief create a rather unbalanced effect. (11/1986)\n\nAmanda Blacchester. Device. Argent, semy of trefoils slipped vert, a swan statant close sable.\n\nConflict with Irving de Rosamonde MacChlurain (\"Ermine, a swan elevated and displayed, dismembered sable, collared Or, holding in its beak a thistle proper.\"): the visual effect of the trefoils and ermine spots is so close that at most a minor point of difference can be derived from the change and the visual echo is strong. Several commentors also adduced Brianna the Black Swan (\"Bendy sinister wavy of ten gules and Or, a swan naiant sable.\"). This is not only visually but technically clear: there is a major point for the difference in tinctures of the field and, under the current rules (DoD A4c), the semy is treated as the addition of charges and so counts as another major point of difference in addition to the difference in posture between close and naiant which traditionally would count as at least equivalent to a minor point of difference. (01/1989)\n\nAmarantha Randolph. Name only.\n\nThe letter of intent cited the given name as a construct from the Greek and stated that it was \"consistent with late period naming practice during the reign of 'Gloriana'\", implying an argument from the Spenserian usage of \"Gloriana\" in support of this name. Unfortunately, \"Gloriana\" is an allegorical usage and may be considered unique (it alluded to Queen Elizabeth as the Faerie Queen). Amarantha is indeed derived from the Greek for everlasting, but in period \"amaranth\" seems to have had two primary meanings. The first, still used today is for an actual family of flowers (including pigweed and tumbleweed!), as well as for a legendary flower which never dies. As a \"flower name\", this requires some serious documentation that the name, as such, was used in period. The second period usage of \"amaranth\" is equally difficult, since it refers to a type of gem. While such names were occasionally used in allegory and some came into popular usage (e.g., Margaret, derived from the Latin word for \"pearl\"), such gem names were not nearly as common in period as they are today. (01/1988)\n\nAmbiorix Draconis. Name and device. Purpure, a dragon's head erased Or.\n\nUnfortunately, the name Ambiorix seems to be a unique name for one of the greatest of the Gallic leaders who appear in Caesar's Gallic Wars. Indeed, his fame was only exceeded by that of Vercingetorix and it is arguable that Ambiorix, chief of the Eburones, who led a major revolt against Roman power in the 50's B.C. was a greater leader as he was not compelled to surrender to Caesar as was Vercingetorix. Also, the proper formation for the byname would have it in the nominative (\"Draco\"). Such a byname is perfectly legitimate and would be suitable both for a Romanized Gaul or a Roman. The device, unfortunately, conflicts with the badge of Sarkanyi Gero (\"A triskelion of dragon's heads Or, tongued gules.\"): no difference is created by the languing, which could just as well have been left to artistic discretion and the only other modification is the addition of the conjoined dragon's heads in base. (11/1987)\n\nAmbrose Mavrothakis. Name and device. Argent, a sinister glove bendwise sinister gules, grasping a garden rose bendwise, slipped and leaved, sable.\n\nThe device seemed acceptable, but the submittor allowed no changes whatsoever to his name and there are real problems with the byname. In the first place there is some real doubt as to the submittor's intent. The transliteration provided uses a \"theta\" at the beginning of the second element, but a \"delta\" appears in the Greek spelling provided in parenthesis next to it and these would not have the same linguistic value in medieval or modern Greek. Generally speaking, this is a medieval formation and the use of \"mavro\" to reflect the modern pronunciation of the medieval/modern Greek word for black is so common that only the most pedantic would object that the period pronunciation would produce the spelling \"mauro\" (the adjective is cognate with the imported English word \"Moor\" for a black). However, his forms indicated that he wished a Cretan form of a byname meaning \"Blackrose\", while the Xeroxes and the letter of intent point to a desired meaning closer to \"Black Rosethorn\". Unfortunately, this construction does not seem to provide either. Greek, classical or medieval, does not generally form bynames by simply concatenating a series of noun adjectives in the manner German does. When compounds are formed, they usually contain two identifiable elements (e.g., Chrysogonus, Paleologus) with contraction kept to a minimum. In this case, it is proposed that three forms \"mavros\", \"rhodon\" and \"akis\" coalesce to form \"Mavrothakis\" in which \"rhodon\" (meaning \"rose\"), which is the primary substantive on his initial forms, is reduced to the sort of dental glide which is commonly introduced in medieval Greek between a terminal vowel and an initial vowel in a compound. Actually, this byname sounds and looks like a number of epithetic family names which Laurel herself encountered in Crete, but the presence of the Blackrose on the gentle's device indicates that the meaning is as important to him as the sound. If changes to the name had been permitted, we would have attempted to construct a period Greek version of \"Blackrose\", but this was not possible. (03/1988)\n\nAmee de Jardyn. Device. Per chevron sable and azure, a chevron and in base an escallop inverted Or.\n\nConflict with the device of Chesley of Headless House (\"Per chevron sable and azure, a chevron between three fleurs-de-lys Or.\"). (01/1987)\n\nAmos MacAlpin. Device. Per bend sinister vert and azure, on a tankard argent, two halberds in saltire sable.\n\nConflict with Pia Dragonslayer (\"Azure, on a two-handled mug per pale Or and argent, a dragon segreant vert bearing a sword sable.\"). (07/1988)\n\nAmos MacAlpin. Device. Per bend sinister vert and azure, on a tankard argent, two halberds in saltire sable.\n\nThis submission had previously been returned for conflict with Pia Dragonslayer (\"Azure, on a tow-handled mug per pale Or and argent, a dragon segreant vert bearing a sword sable.\"). Star argues that a minor can be derived from the tincture of the field and the tincture of the mug and there is no disagreement on this point. He also argues that a minor can be derived from the difference between a one-handled and two-handled mug. We cannot agree as this is the sort of artistic difference that frequently is not even blazoned. Finally and most critically, Star argues that a major point should be derived from the changes to the tertiaries. Since the mug is not an ordinary, DR10 requires changes of type, tincture and number for this to be even considered for a major point of difference. As the tertiary in Pia's device is partially sable, these three changes are not present. Even if we were willing to grant that the changes of tincture of field and charge equate to a full major point of difference, there would be technical conflict problems. Moreover, since the changes to both sets of tinctures are of the lowest possible contrast with the green fading into the blue and the gold into the silver, the visual similarity between the two devices is particularly striking. (02/1989)\n\nAmron al-Tashali. Device. Or, in bend sinister a hooded veil affronty and a scimitar bendwise, a sinister gore, all sable.\n\nWhile Silver Trumpet is correct that the gore is usually considered by definition a secondary charge since it issues from the flanks of the shield, in spirit this is \"slot machine heraldry\". To this anomaly is added the marginally identifiable \"hooded veil\", which was only identifiable after reading the blazon (like Star, we took it at first to be a form of helm). While we sympathize with the submitter's selection of motifs, if Amron is a Tashali nija type, the device is just to anomalous in style to register, under old or new rules. (12/1989)\n\nAmyergorod, Shire of. Device. Pean, s sword inverted, the blade within a laurel wreath argent, all within a bordure embattled Or.\n\nAlthough the fact that the hilt of the sword is a trickele was blazoned on the letter of intent, this artistic license and can be omitted. Unfortunately, as the name of the group was returned in June, 1989, the device must be returned as well. (holding names may not be generated for groups.) (09/1989)\n\nAmyergorod, Shire of. Name only.\n\nThe letter of intent indicated that the submittors desired a name which meant \"Honor City\" in Russian. As several commentors noted, \"Amer\" does not mean \"honor\" in Russian. We believe that Crescent is correct in supposing that this is a misreading of the note in the Russian dictionary that cited \"honor\" as an American spelling of the word (the abbreviation would be \"Amer\"). Courtesy of Shofar, an analysis of several period styles for name formation for alternatives with the correct meaning have been provided. Perhaps the closes of these would appear to be \"Chestnogorod\". (06/1989)\n\nAn Tir, Crown Prince of. Device. Chequy Or and argent, a lion couchant, queue fourche, sable, gorged of a coronet argent.\n\nNote that the submitted device is not sufficiently different from submitted for the Crown Princess since they differ only by the type of gorging, which is at most a weak minor (by DR1c the minimum difference permissible between devices where permission to conflict has been granted is a major point). This also is in conflict with several devices cited by commentors. Given the extremely low contrast field, which appears to be argent in many lights, it visually conflicts with William the Silent (\"Argent, a natural panther passant guardant sable.\"). It also conflicts with Houri the Savage (\"Argent, a lion rampant sable, orbed and langued gules.\") since virtually no difference can be derived from the addition of the gorging and none whatsoever from the orbing and languing. (11/1987)\n\nAn Tir, Crown Princess of. Device. Chequy Or and argent, a lion couchant, queue fourche, sable, gorged of a wreath of hearts and roses argent.\n\nThis is not sufficiently different from that submitted for the Crown Prince. This must be returned for the same conflicts cited for the proposed device for the Crown Prince. (11/1987)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Badge for Lists Office. Sable, a scroll unrolled bendwise argent and overall a sword Or.\n\nConflict with the device of Morimoto Koryu (\"Sable, a crescent argent surmounted by a ken blade Or.\"). Since he is a resident of An Tir, perhaps a permission to conflict might be obtained. (11/1986)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Badge for Order of the Carp. Gules, a carp hauriant embowed Or.\n\nConflict with Beatrice Delfini (\"Per chevron argent, ermined gules, and azure, a dolphin hauriant embowed Or.\"). The fish on both pieces of armoury are virtually identical, leaving only the difference in the field. (08/1987)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Badge. Chequy Or and argent, a lion's head cabossed sable.\n\nThere is a strong visual conflict with Lenore of Lynxhaven (\"Or, a lynx's head cabossed sable, orbed Or.\") (09/1986)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Guild of the Black Kettle. Device. Argent, a demi�lion rampant queue�forchee sable crowned gules maintaining in dexter forepaw a wooden spoon proper and in base a kettle sable.\n\nThe crown is reserved to the arms of Kingdoms, Principalities and Royal Peers and may not be used, even with royal permission, by other individuals or groups. (09/1986)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Title for Imprimatur Pursuivant.\n\nWhile modern slang usage has tended to broaden the usage, the Latin term \"Imprimatur\" (i.e., \"let it be printed.\") is associated far too strictly with the episcopal power of censorship for us to be comfortable with its use in the Society. Even today, books of a religious nature published with the approval of the Roman Catholic authorities will have a \"Nihil Obstat\" and an \"Imprimatur\" and failure to obtain such approval for theological teachings can result in ecclesiastical sanctions. Neither the specifically religious overtones of the term nor the hint of censorship seem appropriate for a Society heraldic title. (05/1987)\n\nAna Ashford. Name for House Ruthendale.\n\nThe letter of intent implied that this was derived from Ruthven, which it would not normally be. As there is a Rutherford and Rutherglen documented, this would have been acceptable, but we were reluctant to change the household name unilaterally, given the confusion as to the lady's intent (does she want Ruthvendale or Rutherdale?). (07/1987)\n\nAna Isabel Barrios de Perez. Badge. Argent, a domestic cats paw print sable.\n\nSubmitted under the name Ana Isabel Barrios y Perez, this is the registered form of the submitter's name. The badge conflicts with Igor Medved (SCA), Argent, a bear's dexter pawprint azure (with only one CVD for tincture of the primary charge), Eric Bearsbane (SCA), Argent, on a bear's pawprint sable, a flaming sword proper (only one CVD for removal of the tertiary), and Rodrigo de los Lobos (SCA), Argent, on a wolf's pawprint sable, a crescent argent (same count as Eric Bearsbane). It has been previously ruled that there can be no difference given for type of pawprint (LoAR 21 February 1988, p. 11). (06/1990)\n\nAnastacia Marie Travarra. Badge. A plate surmounted by a sprig of belladonna.\n\nChevron is quite correct in noting that, with the plant drawn large, as on the emblazon, this is visually in conflict with Morgana of the Marshes (\"Argent, a sprig of belladonna proper, in canton an increscent azure.\"). If the belladonna were drawn smaller so that it lay on the plate entirely, this would then conflict with Sumer Redmaene (\"Purpure, on a plate a rose gules, seeded Or.\") and others. (12/1986)\n\nAnastasia Aleksandrovna. Name only.\n\nAlthough the father of the famous twentieth-century Alexandra, daughter of the last Romanov tsar, was in fact named Nicholas, her mother's name was alexandra and her grandfather's name was Alexander. While there is evidence that the \"-ovna\" ending is only used with the father's name (i.e., metronymics or general ancestral names are not commonly used in Russian),the general use of metronymics in the Society in contexts used in Russian), the general use of metronymics in the Society in contexts where the mundane world might not use them would seem to justify the extreme nervousness this name induced in many of the members of the College of Arms. (05/1987)\n\nAnastasia Elisabeth Fairfax. Device. Argent, a violet within a bordure purpure charged with four decrescents argent.\n\nThis is clear of Kateryne of Hindscroft (\"Argent, a violet purpure within an orle of hearts azure.\") since the number, type and tincture of secondary charge differs (for a major and minor) and the tertiaries add the necessary additional minor. The instincts of those who called this conflict were correct, however, since both these devices are in conflict with and appear to be cadet arms of those of Alyanora of Vinca (\"Argent, a periwinkle proper.\"). Unfortunately, when the present Laurel passed Kateryne's arms at her very first meeting, noone called the conflict and the Laurel files were still in transit from California. . . (02/1989)\n\nAnastasia von der Wilgenhalle. Device. Vert, two lambs dormant respectant and a weeping willow tree eradicated argent.\n\nConflict with Ioseph of Locksley (\"Vert, a tree eradicated argent.\"). (07/1988)\n\nAnastasia Winogrodzka. Badge. A cross of ermine spots conjoined vert.\n\nAs this is a fieldless badge, it conflicts with the arms of Blake (\"Argent, a cross fleury vert.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 608) and Dawbney (\"Or, a cross fleury vert.\", ibid., p. 616). With the best will in the world we could see no more than a minor point of difference between the cross of conjoined ermine spots and the cross fleury. (05/1989)\n\nAnastasia Winogrodzka. Badge. A Cross of four ermine spots vert.\n\nthis was originally returned in May, 1989, with the following commentary: \"As this is a fieldless badge, it conflicts with the arms of Blake (\"Argent, a cross fleury vert.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 608) and Dawbney (\"Or, a cross fleury vert.\", ibid, p. 616). With the best will in the world we could see no more than a minor point of difference between the cross of conjoined ermine spots and the cross fleury.\" White Stag has appealed this return on the grounds that the cross of four ermine spots is a distinct charge from the cross fleury (as illustrated by at least seven widely variant depictions which White Stag's excellent spots adds the dots of the ermine sports around the center of the cross (in the depiction used on the badge, this comes out to a sort of attenuated set of lozenges conjoined to form a voided square overlying the center of the cross). While not denying that there could be legitimate differences in the depiction of a cross of ermine spots, there was a fairly strong focus in commentary on the fact that the College has to consider the submitted emblazon and that emblazon is almost identical to a cross fleury, save for the frou-frou at its center. This being the case, this has to be considered in conflict with the cited devices, under both the old rules and the new, although they are farther apart under the new rules. (12/1989)\n\nAnastassia Mikhailovna Donskoi. Device. Azure, two axes in saltire argent, the shafts Or, between in fess two wolfhound's heads addorsed erased argent, in chief a cross flory argent surmounting four hearts conjoined in cross Or.\n\nThe charge combination in chief is unidentifiable at any distance. The cross, which lies almost entirely on the hearts Or, is metal on metal in fact and disappears into the Or to such an extent that it cannot be determined what it is. The hearts in cross are so ill-defined at that size (and so obscured by the overlying charge) that at first glance they appear to be some sort of obscure four petalled rose. It was the general consensus that simplification was in order. (01/1987)\n\nAndré d'Aquitaine. Device. Per bend azure and vert, a bend argent between a sun in splendour and a saddle Or.\n\nConflict with Megan of the Shore (\"Per bend azure and vert, a bend and in sinister chief a seagull volant to sinister argent.\"). (02/1988)\n\nAndreanna Innes. Badge. A Lacy knot lozengewise Or.\n\nThe bulk of standard heraldic works (e.g., Boutell, Brooke-Little's Heraldic Alphabet, Franklyn's Shield and Crest, etc.) show the Lacy badge in precisely this orientation so this must be considered to be a direct conflict. (05/1988)\n\nAndrée Diane Chartier de l'Oise. Device. Azure, an osprey rising, wings elevated and addorsed, and on a chief argent, three bunches of grapes azure.\n\nConflict with the arms of Knowles (\"Axure, a hoawk seizing a partridge argent, on a chief of the last three bolts of the first.\", as cited in Papworth, p. 310). (05/1989)\n\nAndree Nadine de Valois. Name only.\n\nUnfortunately, as Crescent has noted, there is really no way to be \"of Valois\" without giving the impression of claiming a relationship with the Valois dynasty of French royalty. If the lady wishes to be from this region (it is a region, not a city), she could be from one of the period towns or, as suggested by Crescent, use the name of the river from which the region takes its name (\"de l'Oise\"). It should also be noted that the citation in Withycombe offered in support of Nadine (p. 225) suggests that the name is an out of period French formation derived from a Russian form, which bears the appearance of a diminutive. (12/1987)\n\nAndrew Fletcher. Name and device. Per pale sable and Or, in chief three saltorels couped counterchanged.\n\nAs Silver Trumpet has noted, the politician Andrew Fletcher cited in the letter of intent is of some importance in Scottish history (the 1911 editionof the Encyclopedia Britannica, probably the best one to have appeared, contained a column and a half devoted to him). Even though he is out of period (1655�1716) he is important enough to protect and this is a direct conflict under both rules. As the submittor specifically forbade formation of a holding name, we have to return the device submission as well. (01/1990)\n\nAndrew Wigin MacAlister. Name and device. Gules, ermined Or, on a bend argent, a natural panther salient reguardant sable.\n\nThe name conflicts both with the registered Society name of Andrew MacAlistair and the name of Andrew Wiggin, the leading character in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. The device conflicts with Robyn of Mania (\"Gules, on a bend argent, a raven displayed palewise, wings inverted, sable, grasping in its beak a rose, flower to sinister, gules, slipped and leaved vert.\"). (07/1989)\n\nAndro Haldane of Menteith. Name and device. Per bend sinister embattled azure and argent, two compass stars counterchanged, on a chief argent, three card piques azure.\n\nThe letter of intent says that the spelling of the given name is derived from an entry in Black which documents the form as a surname in the fourteenth century. Unfortunately, as this is a known prefix derived from the Greek \"andros\" (as in \"androgyny\") and early Scots name forms used as surnames frequently are in oblique cases or are specifically varied for surname use, we need documentation of its use as an actual name. (The substitution of the \"o\" at the end of the name is not a usual variant of the nominative form.) Unfortunately, we could not substitute \"Andrew\" and register the name or even assign a holding name and register the device since he had forbidden any changes to the name, even the formation of a holding name. (01/1990)\n\nAndros Leonthalasios. Device. Argent, a lion headed merman affronty, head to sinister, proper, tailed vert, maintaining a sword and shield Or, all within an orle wavy azure.\n\nA substantially similar submission was returned in 1983 for overuse of proper and the use of an orle wavy crested. The latter problem has been corrected, but as Lymphad noted, the problem with the poor contrast and overuse of proper has not been addressed. The submittor, as is his right, appealed the return from kingdom level to Laurel. Unfortunately, we are compelled to agree with Lymphad: the only portion of the beastie which has adequate contrast with the field is the tail (vert). The head is Or, the weapons are a darker Or (bronze) and the body is light flesh tone, none of which show up well on an argent field. Note that the orle needs to be drawn much wider than it appeared on the emblazon sheet submitted. (08/1988)\n\nAneirin y Peabodie. Name and device. Gyronny of six per pale sable and argent, on a chief gules a griffin segreant to sinister Or.\n\nWhatever the derivation of the family name Peabody (or Peabodie), it is clear that it is not a Welsh noun which would use the common article. As the submittor was so adamant about refusing even minor changes to his name, we felt compelled to return the submission as a whole rather than assign a holding name. Note that we have reblazoned the device from the field \"per fess\" to reflect the realities of the proposed device as depicted on the emblazon sheet. This shows the gules area in chief in precisely that proportion which would have been used in period for a chief which had to accommodate a beast rampant and the appearance of a chief as the primary charge is increased by the proportions of the gyronny below. (10/1987)\n\nAneirin Ynis Peaboadie. Name and device. Gyronny of six per pale sable and argent, on a chief gules a griffin segreant to sinister Or.\n\n\"Ynis\" was stated to be a name from the Mabinogion, but the nearest name from that source which we could find is \"Ynyr\" and no indication of the tale or translation was given to guide us. \"Ynys\" generally means \"island\" in Welsh and is not a given name. Unfortunately, the commentors caught a technical conflict not found at the time of the device's original submission to the College: Durnhardt of Altenau (\"Checky sable and argent, on a chief gules a water bouget Or.\") (06/1988)\n\nAneirn Yryn Peaboadie. Name only.\n\nThe name had previously been submitted as \"Aneirin Ynis Peaboadie\" and been returned by Laurel because of the use of \"Ynis\" in an inappropriate manner with the note that the closest period given name form we could find was \"Ynyr\". This resubmission modifies the first given name unacceptably by dropping the final \"i\". It also uses a totally undocumented form \"Yryn\" as its second element. As the submittor again allows no changes to his name, the submission must be returned. (11/1989)\n\nAneirn Yryn Peaboadie. Device. Gyronny per pale of six sable and argent, on a chief gules a griffin segreant to sinister Or.\n\nCheck name. Note that the name was returned in November, 1989. A previous return of this device for conflict with Durnhardt of Altenau (\"Chequy sable and argent, a water bouget Or.\") was appealed on the grounds that the field division as blazoned by the submittor (\"Per fess gules and gyronny per pale of six sable and argent\") is a valid period division and that the reblazon alone creates the technical conflict. Unfortunately, there is a long�standing precedent in the Society that the blazon used does not affect a conflict between two emblazons. (That is what we mean when we say the picture, not the words used to describe that picture, are what is protected.) In period heraldry and in most modern heraldic circles, the field division shown here would be considered tantamount to a field with a charged chief since it is customary to expand the dimensions of the chief to accommodate the size of the charge placed upon it. In other words, a chief with a lion passant will be narrower than one with a lion rampant. This phenomenon appears commonly through period rolls of arms and is even commented on by period and modern authors (usually in discussions of the size relationships of ordinaries and their diminutives). In this case, the depiction is identical to that which would have been used for a plain field with a chief charged with a rampant beast. That being the case, this is a conflict with Durnhardt under both old and new rules: there is a major point or visual difference for the difference in field division. However, the minor given under the old rules for the change in type of tertiary would not have cleared the conflict even under the old rules since both are Society devices and there is a definite conflict under the new rules. (03/1990)\n\nAngela von Braun. Device.\n\nAzure, ermined Or, on a bezant a peacock feather proper. For the purposes of DR10, it is difficult to deny that the roundel, which is as simple geometrically as a cross or pale and is almost universally categorized as a sub-ordinary, should be considered equivalent to an ordinary. However, this does not resolve the problems for this device for the contrast is"
