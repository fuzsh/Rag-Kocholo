        "text": "They ask me to measure the impact you have had on my life,\n\nAs if I can pull a ruler from my pocket and find meaning\n\nsomewhere between tick marks –\n\nAs if the fullness of what you have done to me can live\n\nin the space between each inch –\n\nI hate\n\nthe imperial system, anyway.\n\n.\n\nThe word impact can mean so many things –\n\nA collision. A strike. A hit. A smack. A ram. A touch.\n\nRemind me the difference\n\nbetween affect and effect again?\n\n.\n\nVictim does a lot of heavy lifting, too.\n\nAm I a victim?\n\nSome call me\n\na survivor – part of me\n\nsurvived, at least\n\n(every action has an\n\nequal and opposite –\n\nDoes that make you a\n\nVictimizer?)\n\n.\n\nWell I guess we should\n\ndive right in I suppose\n\nthe Body Count is a good place\n\nTo start with\n\nThe body of my childhood\n\nravaged and gone\n\nThe body of my adulthood\n\nbroken and infirm and\n\nThe bodies of the\n\nchildren I thought to one day\n\nmake with it\n\nCounting a negative feels like\n\nan impossibility so let’s\n\ncall it an even infinity\n\n.\n\nI heard once about\n\nOpportunity Cost,\n\nso why don’t we throw that\n\non the books, as well –\n\nThe cost of lost opportunities and\n\nThe cost of loss itself and\n\nThe price of pennies and\n\nheld breaths and\n\nsick days or really\n\nmental health days because\n\nthere is no name for\n\nThe Sickness of not\n\nbeing able to\n\nmeet your own eyes in\n\nthe mirror\n\n.\n\nMy Statement is\n\nis that the impact on this victim is\n\nis that the collision of your fist is\n\nis that the strike of your match is\n\nis that the hit of your pipe is\n\nis that the smack of your lips is\n\nis that the ram of your body is\n\nis that the touch of your life is\n\nis that the affect of your effect is\n\nIs\n\nIs this.\n\nIs this enough?\n\nwe all returned to ancient Sodom\n\ndid heed its brimstone beacon\n\ntime after all just a construct\n\nmy brothers and I agreed to keep\n\nticking away\n\nand were greeted at the gate\n\nwith wine and whores and sand\n\nand Lot came by with men\n\nwe already knew were angels\n\nand they looked upon\n\nmy sweet cousin Jamie\n\nwho even back then they knew\n\nwould in 2009 be murdered\n\nand stuffed into a plastic box\n\nin some suburb of Louisville\n\nwhen he fled the closeness\n\nof creeks and hollers and hills\n\nfor some form of sodomite freedom\n\nand the angels said unto us we are sorry\n\nfor what you have all been through\n\ncause that’s not what this story is about\n\nbut we had already been through\n\nwhat we had already been through\n\nbecause of what this story would be\n\nand we joined the angry mob\n\nand called out with them to Lot\n\nto bring down the men that we might know them\n\nthat they might speak to the fullness of blazing ruins\n\nwhose smoke rises beyond time like a cracked furnace\n\nand Lot stood at his door, already drunk, and said,\n\nNo, my friends. Do not do this wicked thing!\n\nbut weary of being clutched between verses\n\nwe named this a time for gathering stones\n\nand cast them til thunder shook the earth with ink\n\nthe question is what do you want to drink\n\n& the answer is always yes. i am\n\nthe inside of a fountain in that i suck\n\nscum into my crevices like\n\na bottom-feeder turned loose\n\nin a field of carrion. i open\n\nmy blinds & stare down at traffic,\n\nshutter released longer & longer\n\nthe emptier the bottle gets—taillights\n\nblur to flowing cabernet & eastbound\n\ntraffic shines like sauvignon blanc.\n\n(my father was an oenophile\n\n& my childhood fever dreams\n\nare tinted like the contents of crystal\n\ngoblets.) i always imagine someone\n\nis watching me wobble across\n\nlinoleum floor, triple-sheeted & tossed\n\nto the wind. imagine with delight\n\nthat a stranger sees me stumbling, waves\n\nhello. i think of how much i care\n\nabout how glamorous i must seem\n\nwith a glass in my hand. in the mirror,\n\ni rake fingers through miles of hair,\n\nnearly manic—the question is what\n\ndoes it say that my beauty is all for show\n\n& no one is looking at me right now?\n\nThe most beautiful part of a man is the back of his neck\n\nwhen he’s sad. He has to be sad for his neck to be beautiful,\n\nexposed to the sky like a clam pried open,\n\na giant muscle straining out to nowhere.\n\nHe woke up yelling I love you to an empty house\n\nhe dreamed was being vaporized with you inside.\n\nEven a monkey can understand the glory of closing your eyes\n\nand forgetting you ever had them open.\n\nForgiveness isn’t holy but neither is loving every man\n\nyou meet no matter what good people are supposed to do.\n\nHe forgot to kiss you goodbye at the airport this morning\n\nand drove home wearing the sky for eyes.\n\nThe mountains were the molars and the foothills his cold blue jaw\n\nand pain used to be something he saw at the rodeo.\n\nAfter the divorce, after the kids\n\nare finally sleeping, I open\n\nthe kitchen drawer and stare\n\nat the new knives arranged neatly\n\non soft black shelf liner,\n\nand I weep as if someone has died.\n\nMy father has, of course,\n\nbut only now, years later\n\ndo I miss his slowness,\n\nhis somehow mournful\n\njoy in watching this world.\n\nAnd what is this world\n\nwe have created? Who\n\nare these children, cursing us\n\nbecause we made them;\n\nfull of black joy\n\nfor the shadows they are\n\nor will become,\n\nthey race the sun\n\nsliding over the rocks\n\nthat skirt the lake, then sliding\n\nfurther, past its never ending\n\nawakening -- and everything\n\nin its place still;\n\nthe poor knives that dream\n\non their black bed, and brush\n\nsoftly against each other, barely touching,\n\nand the lonely spoons\n\nthat spend their first night shining\n\nin the clean rubber compartment,\n\nback to back, unable to turn\n\nand face each other;\n\nwaiting only\n\nto carry our endless hunger, to feel\n\nthe hot wash of purity\n\nstorm across their bodies\n\nnight after night.\n\nstaring at her feels funny. funny in the casket of red velvet rope way, funny in the presentation of our findings way, the mirror way, the humiliation way. it’s the i know you’s preceding the differentiation. she’s been dead for sixty-six million years. her jaws rusted open, head thrown back, inevitably curving the spine, nerveless, attracting men who harden pathetically easily at curvatures of similar pretenses. they think she died of natural causes. i think she’s god. i think of the woman holding her baby up in front of the painting of the woman holding her baby. i turn my head upside down to see if i get the same revelation in understanding. the museum guide says they discovered her in the limestone beds of Southern Germany. i ask if he meant that she donated her body to science. i ask if she would have rather died in fetal position. he says he can’t answer for her. i say he’s been doing just that. he says my questions appertain to a different building, try the museum of art. i think he is confusing my inquiries for interpretative theories. ancient animals that carried eggs sixty-six million years ago are often just hollow calcium and pomewater. the parasaurolophus hides her young in the molten womb of the earth. the archaeopteryx dies sixty-six million years beforehand where nobody will ever find her. the diplodocus rots beneath falling stars. birds of heaven die in baptismal pangea; live to haunt halls of glass and signage. metaphors carve the notches in her vertebrae: to die to provide to self-paralyze to entertain to fossilize to oxidize to rot to comply to do it silently. she says only a meteor could outperform me.\n\nAll the good ones have been taken, you\n\nsolemnly declare. Books, men, houses.\n\nWe were taught to ration everything like\n\nwe’re at war. Flour, fruit, detergent, love,\n\ngrief. I never said I love you because I had\n\nonly one left in me and I was saving it for\n\nlater, like insurance. Plenty of fish in the sea\n\nI tell you. Do you ever imagine our father\n\nin his apartment this smoggy evening, only\n\nthe tacky glow of his work laptop to light\n\nhis face? Screaming over the phone about\n\ncommute, petrol, interest, us, liability.\n\nThen screaming about the phone bill he racks\n\nup. No fish in this economy, you say, some\n\ntook all and orphaned the sea. It’s Christmas\n\nand I don’t know what old age looks like\n\non him, he loves from the other side of a valve\n\nthat won’t turn. Guilt coaxes its way up but I\n\nshut the door. Don’t worry, it’ll trickle down.\n\nthe sun slices rain in half with a pocket knife\n\nand i mourn it with soggy fingers,\n\neyes coral pink like the time the skyline bled\n\ninto heat’s ripples. sweat boils in lungs, cooking\n\na feast of maggots—it leaves cherry blisters\n\non skin, bleach corroded leather and bloody knees\n\nsplit open & horrible\n\nveins licking the wind. a bouquet of serpent tongues.\n\nlittle writhing worms for bone marrow,\n\nlittle palms pressed\n\nagainst the inside of murky eyes—they say\n\neyes are the windows to the soul, all\n\ni know are little cobweb woven curtains\n\nand little woman shoulders cradling my little ghost.\n\nsometimes i drown in the shower the same way i do\n\nin stagnant pools & dream & burst into liquid tendrils\n\nlike body horror or a sonata or a clump of red moss—\n\nrusty waves flooding the sewer, palm prints\n\non water-varnished rocks, a timelapse of fungi\n\ngrowth until my neurons crumble and the world\n\nfolds in upon itself into a single ball of lint-\n\nadorn microfibre yarn, rage red august sunset,\n\nbroken ac and opaque smoke. all i know is everything\n\ncrammed into this empty room. the walls are bursting.\n\nAt school, I could not read\n\nthe assessment without the asses\n\nthey clung like nits to the root\n\nof the word. Those egg-round\n\ncheeks pinched firmly to the sment\n\nwaiting for the perfect moment\n\nto be born. You can’t just brush them off,\n\nMrs. Nurse said, those grape big grapes.\n\nDad did his thing— he massaged my head,\n\nbreaking up my skull into white lumps of dough\n\nin his hands, hands I wore as glasses.\n\nDad pushed me into cuneiform\n\nbooks he pulled from stacks. I couldn’t see\n\nhow the other children saw. The Indian\n\nin the Cupboard in 4th grade\n\nI wasn’t good enough to read. His rivers run backwards,\n\nMs. Mirror said, as she pointed left-my right\n\nto the map I’d drawn. The only one she’d hung\n\ninside the bathroom door above the wash\n\nyour hands. Dad figured it was all distraction—a cat\n\n5 hurricane of disoriented dreaming reversing the course\n\nof my headwaters to my mouth & 10-fingered delta distributaries.\n\nHe hid my soccer ball in the gravity\n\nwell beneath his bed where he thought I couldn’t reach it.\n\nBut I pulled it out like Magic Messy did—\n\ngenius footballer, foodie and astrophysicist,\n\nas Mr. CNN said— I reached into the singularity,\n\nlight-warping\n\nletter-bending homo\n\nphone & graphs oh mission!\n\nTrans’\n\nposition\n\nRev’s\n\nersals\n\nsub’s tits\n\nyou tions,\n\nmy tions,\n\nall the tions my heart caught\n\nlike fireflies beneath the dark\n\nprint & mind like a cupboard clinging\n\nto the indian in the corner forever in 4th grade\n\nnot allowed to read the nits on the roots\n\nof the rolling ball, my asses to the sment like Magic Messy did\n\nwhen eating casually a churrasco he revealed a bleeding\n\nlight, a chewed up, spat-out star left tumbling through the universe\n\nby an elusive black hole. Trapped it, touched it, and tapped it\n\nbeautifully into goal.\n\nNightlight eyes\n\nfor when it's dark\n\noutside, when other names\n\nare less likely to interrupt me.\n\nAll the same, other bodies\n\nwon't stop staring\n\nat my albino nightlights.\n\nThey want their own\n\neyes to be as red as mine.\n\nThey will pretend otherwise.\n\nThey will cut out one of my eyes,\n\nswallow it, then try to replicate it.\n\nThey will somehow manage\n\nto convince themselves\n\nthey're not torturing me.\n\nThey will tell me to relax\n\nwhile they torture me.\n\nThey will suddenly stab me,\n\nthen tell me I'm the one\n\nwho is filled with animosity\n\njust because I didn't stay silent.\n\nI was only supposed to scream inside\n\nmy own one-eyed head.\n\nI was only supposed to bleed in my own bed\n\nafter they got what they wanted."
