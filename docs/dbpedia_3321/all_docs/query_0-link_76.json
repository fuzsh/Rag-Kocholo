        "text": "AUGUST IS CHABROL/MELVILLE MONTH\n\nIn a complete departure from his Leon Morin characterization (reviewed and discussed in the previous column), Jean-Paul Belmondo slithers in and out of the dark sinister trappings comprising 1962’s LE DOULOS, written and directed by Morin‘s Jean-Pierre Melville (and now available in a new 4K restoration from Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Studio Canal).\n\nImagine Belmondo’s Breathless character, but thoroughly evil, and you have the noirish genes that make up the nefarious Silien.\n\nSilien, adorned in genre trenchcoat and fedora, wanders through the nocturne of rainswept Paris streets working his trade. Ostensibly a gangster, in deep with the mob, Silien’s specialty is the title sidebar (French for “snitch”). Yeah, he’s a rat – playing both sides of the pavement. Worse, he’s also a vicious psychopath, whose overt charm often leads to remorseless killing (men, women, innocent bystanders…doesn’t matter).\n\nOf course, this being a Melville pic doesn’t make him much different from the rest of the humans – cops and thugs. But at least they don’t squeal.\n\nEven Maurice Faugel, the supposed “hero” of the piece ain’t no angel. Released and obviously unreformed from prison, he immediately heads off to visit a kindly, aging gang leader, who gives him advice and help for a new heist…before the ex-con kills him (apparently, this elderly creep set him up).\n\nThe gendarmes aren’t any better – proved when loyalty is matter-of-factly shrugged off regarding the protection of Silien’s longtime police contact.\n\nIn Melville’s very capable hands, the direction and the screenplay (based on Pierre Lesou’s novel) is fever pitch – never letting up in suspense, and jaw-dropping violence.\n\nBelmondo, not surprisingly, is terrific, as is the doomed supporting cast, including Serge Reggiani (as Maurice), Jean Desally, Rene Lefevre, Marcel Cuvelier, Fabienne Dali, Monique Hennessy, Carl Studer, Philippe March, Paulette Breil, and, in an early role, Michel Piccoli.\n\nThe stark, downright gorgeous black-and-white cinematography comes courtesy of Nicolas Hayer, who shot Clouzot’s brilliant Le Corbeau. And Paul Misaki’s jazzy music score beautifully audibly underlines the treachery. The Carlo Ponti coproduction is aces, and so is this 1080p Blu-ray, which includes some wonderful extras including a documentary on Melville, and audio commentaries by film historian Sammi Deighan, and the movie’s assistant director Volker Schlondorff (who, like in Leon Morin, has a small bit). I should mention that DOULOS‘s associate director is a French filmmaker with one of my favorite names from the period, Charles Bitsch (okay, I admit it – I occasionally revert to an eight-year-old mentality). Speaking of favorites, this flick is Martin Scorsese’s bid for top gangster movie of all-time. Now think of Goodfellas, Casino, and The Irishman – and you have an idea what to expect. Just nastier.\n\nLE DOULOS. Black-and-white. Widescreen [1.66:1; 1080p High Definition]; 2.0 DTS-HD MA [French with optional English subtitles]. Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Studio Canal. CAT # K23874. SRP: $29.95.\n\nAUGUST IS CHABROL AND MELVILLE MONTH\n\nA concurrently gentle/tough (and sensual) mood piece, 1961’s LEON MORIN, PRIEST (now on Blu-Ray from the clerics at Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Studio Canal) may not on the surface seem like your typical Jean-Pierre Melville offering. Yet, all of his cynicism and contempt for…well, most everything…is there, if you look. And, truthfully, you really don’t have to look too hard.\n\nWorld War II is raging, and the Nazis have occupied a French Alpine village. Local denizen Barny and her fellow women (the majority of the men are either in the service, resistance fighters, or dead) cope the best they can.\n\nIndeed in the small office where Barny works, a complete mini-society of the outside world exists – rife with anti-semitism, greed, conspirators, collaborators (both political and sexual), patriots, hate-triots, trollops, do-nothings, cowards, heroines…the whole magillah.\n\nBeing a typical French woman, Barny pretty much hates everyone, and one day decides – just for the Hell of it – to invade her local parish and chastise the priests for their hypocrisy. It becomes a day she’ll long remember, as it changes her life.\n\nThe lone clergyman on duty is newbie Leon Morin – a far cry from the usual wizened dinosaur she’s used to. Young, usually soft-spoken, incredibly intelligent, and with a defiant demeanor brandishing his unchanging beliefs, Morin and Barny soon engage in frequent philosophical discussions examining all aspects of Christianity. He gives her books to read, however, much to his brusque delight, Barny’s mind is as strong as his; thus, the woman’s opinions aren’t broken, but, to an extent, bent.\n\nTo Melville’s credit, these sequences aren’t “deep dish,” boring, or eye-rolling fodder; they’re exciting, verbal clashes – often humorous, always snarky. A great friendship is born which, admittedly, Barny – a sexually frustrated widow – fantasizes will go to the next unholy level.\n\nBut she ain’t alone. Practically the entire female populace wants Morin – some shamelessly flashing their bodacious bodies in his unmoved face.\n\nAs Barny grows politically and socially – thanks, in part, to Morin – something new is added. She finds herself falling love with a beautiful Jewish coworker! Oy vey!\n\nUsing Morin as a confessional crutch – hoping for some advice to salve her woes – Barny angrily snaps back at her learned pal when he screams apathetically in response.\n\nWith so many things percolating on a personal plain, even the Nazis leaving the town in shame takes a back seat to the intimate simmering emotions that always seem to be on the verge exploding. Long story short: this is Melville at his best. Ditto, Jean-Paul Belmondo as the title character, a role unlike anything he was usually dealt – the closest being his turn as an intellectual in Two Women (curiously, that movie’s producer, Carlo Ponti, is also the co-producer of MORIN). Echoing Belmondo’s performance is Emmanuelle Riva as Barny, best known for Hiroshima, Mon Amor; she isabsolutely brilliant. The rest of the cast, including Irene Tunic, Nicole Mirel, Gisele Grimm, Marco Behar, Monique Eyaud, Nina Gregoire, Monique Hennessy, Edith Loria, Patricia Gozzi and Howard Vernon are not far behind (future director Volker Schlondorff, who worked as an assistant on this pic, turns up as a soldier). The striking widescreen black-and-white photography is by the superb cinematographer Henri Decai, and an excellent score by Martial Solal (incorporating works by Bach) provides a music equivalent.\n\nThe sardonic script for MORIN by Melville (from a novel by Beatrix Beck) is just terrific – the results giving the director a massive critical hit in 1961. Melville, we should note, was not that far removed from his intriguing on-screen creations. He prided himself on hating humans in general, had no time for bullshit, and made that point quite clear with everyone he met. He also loved the Movies, particularly the products from Hollywood, Expressionist Germany, and neorealist Italy. Like the later Cahiers gang, Melville wrote some spectacular essays on cinema which, mirroring his embryonic celluloid efforts, beat the Truffauts, Godards, and Chabrols to the punch. He especially bonded early with Godard, who screened his movies with Melville before showing them to the public; Jean-Luc often asked Jean-Pierre for pre-production input, and post-production suggestions. It’s likely that Melville’s professional relationship with Belmondo blossomed out of the actor’s appearance in Breathless. As Godard’s rep swelled along with his head, the alliance became increasingly volatile before erupting during a special private presentation. As Jean-Luc’s latest pic unspooled, a noticeably aggravated, pissed off teeth-grinding Melville shifted uncomfortably in his seat – eventually heaving his chest and biting his lip. When the film faded out, a beaming Godard ran down the aisle demanding “Well, what did you think?” Unable to contain himself, Melville jumped up shouting “IT’S APPALLING!” Godard, shocked, then furious, countered with “I’m the darling of international cinema! No one can talk to me like that and still be a considered a friend!” An elated Melville grinned – yelling “FINE!” before storming out; they never spoke again.\n\nNow, the reason for this story is to give you an idea of the kind of folks you meet in a Melville movie. It’s no-nonsense, brutal interaction, i.e., my kind of person.\n\nMelville, too, had a personal connection to LEON MORIN. Born Jean-Pierre Grumbach in 1917 to Jewish parents, he changed his name to “Melville,” in part, in homage to the Moby Dick author, but mostly as an alias during his dangerous participation as a member of the Resistance during WWII. After the war, he opted to go back to Grumbach, but the Melville moniker had stuck so well, that, rather than re-introducing himself, he kept the tag. In comparison to his New Wave competition (a movement he paved the way for), Melville’s filmography is fairly small (14 features). Nevertheless, the director’s Sixties/early Seventies output added to his worldwide fame with every new entry, and held the promise for even greater things before he succumbed to a fatal heart attack in 1973, at age 55.\n\nThe High Definition Blu-Ray of LEON MORIN, PRIEST is, as one might expect from reading the above, exceptional, and hails from a recent 4K restoration. It’s also the most complete (128 minutes) director’s cut – another plus (we say “most,” as, the usual prints clock in at 111 minutes; and Melville claimed his first cut ran nearly four hours!). Some cool extras abound, most prominently audio commentary by filmmaker/historian Mike Siegel and an interview with MORIN assistant director Volker Schlondorff.\n\nA thoroughly different kind of movie, LEON MORIN, PRIEST is an addictive way to become acquainted with its quirky, but innovative director.\n\nLEON MORIN, PRIEST.

SRP: $29.95.\n\nAUGUST IS CHABROL/MELVILLE MONTH\n\nLast summer – August to be precise – I devoted the entire month to my late BFF’s idol, Claude Chabrol. Mon ami in question was writer/director Ric Menello. To say Ric would have been thrilled by the number of Chabrol pics recently restored and made available in High Def 1080p would be an understatement.\n\nI suppose my tribute was a self-indulgent move that I suspected would be largely ignored by Supervista readers. Quite frankly, I didn’t care (how very French of moi!). Much to my joy, the pieces got huge favorable response. So, in honor of Ric (and cinema francais), I’m repeating the homage this August – the month that would have marked M. Menello’s 71st birthday.\n\nProb is there weren’t enough new Chabrol pics to stretch through the torrid summer month. Not an issue, as while Claude Chabrol was Ric’s favorite living director (until the auteur passed in 2010), Menello’s other ultra-fave master of cinema gaulois was the great Jean-Pierre Melville, an artist who often tread similar narrative paths as the undeniably more mischievous Claude\n\nMelville’s work spanned nearly thirty years, and produced a number of bona fide classics. Three terrific entries have now become available in America – a plus for movie buffs in search of snarky, frequently insidious takes on the human condition.\n\nThus, with pride and joy, I raise the curtain on Chabrol’s BLUE PANTHER and THE THIRD LOVER, and, Melville’s LEON MORIN, PRIEST, LE DOULOS, and, UN FLIC – all released through Kino-Lorber.\n\n1965’s THE BLUE PANTHER has always been a tough movie to defend, especially for Chabrol fanatics who consider it a disaster. Chabrol himself pegged the pic as an example from his “wilderness period,” a portion of the mid-late 1960s where he seemed lost…or, more specifically, had lost favor with his previously avidly supportive critics.\n\nThe title itself is the international one; the working moniker (and French release) was Marie-Chantal contre le Dr. Kha. The BLUE PANTHER name, of course, was a lame attempt to cash in on the Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers smash hit from 1963. That said, there actually IS a blue panther jewel that figures in the narrative – with far more lethal implications than anything Edwards’s and Sellers’s bumbling inspector ever tackled.\n\nMarie-Chantal is a stunning jet-setter, bored with life, constantly looking for a thrill. She’s adept in almost everything she tries, mostly surrounding fashion and loving. Traveling with her cousin Hubert on a super luxurious train, Marie-Chantal, like Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day in Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much, accidentally becomes acquainted with a Louis Bernard character, who passes the woman some crucial and dangerous information – along with the gem – which contains a heinous sidebar: the clue to a virus that can destroy all of Mankind. At this juncture, we leave Clouseau, and move into Bond territory – ruled by the diabolical Dr. Kha (a parody on Fleming’s mega villains). Soon, the groovy gal is joined by globe-trotting master secret agent Paco, who may or may not be in cahoots with Kha, but who nevertheless is passionately attracted to Marie (well, who WOULDN’T be!?). Together, they journey throughout some of the Sixties’s most glamorific locales (Morocco, Italy, and, natch, France) as Mlle. Chantal finds numerous delightful ways to rectify her boring world, while Paco just possibly is looking to save it (the planet, not our heroine’s universe).\n\nHave to say, maybe it’s my 1960’s retro jones, but I found BLUE PANTHER thoroughly engaging, funny, and even exciting. Drop-dead gorgeous Marie Laforet is wonderful as Marie-Chantal, a pampered person who we should want to smack in the kisser…yet we champion. The rest of the all-star Euro cast is likewise fetching, and includes Serge Reggiani, Charles Denner, Roger Hanin (as Bruno, the Louis Bernard character), Antonio Passalia, the superb Stephane Audran (then Mme. Chabrol, as a daft femme fatale),\n\nGerard Tichy, and Akim Tamiroff as the evil Dr. Kha. The movie’s vintage is such that the Bond dude, Paco, is portrayed by the excellent Francisco Rabal, an actor who is usually remembered for his middle-aged roles (not unlike those enacted by Fernando Rey).\n\nChabrol, who co-wrote the satire with Jacques Chazot, Christian-Yve, and Daniel Boulanger, does a deft job in the direction department (and even has a cameo appearance, perhaps in homage to the aforementioned Hitchcock flick and its creator). The lavish, spectacular location cinematography is by the great Jean Rabier, who captures the allure of the Italian-Spanish-Swiss-Moroccan locales (not suprisingly, these countries all had a financial hand as co-production participants) with stunning results that rival any 007 adventure.\n\nThe talented composer Pierre Jansen gives us a parodic score that works as both an admirable appendage to the action, as well a rollicking musical soundtrack spoof.\n\nAt one point in the filming, the pic was looking good enough to possibly warrant a series; however, the lukewarm response at the time of its release (particularly from Chabrol aficionados) pretty much put a nail in that coffin.\n\nThe Kino-Lorber/Studio Canal 4K 1080p restoration of BLUE PANTHER looks simply grand. Extras comprise commentary by Howard S. Berger, Steve Mitchell, and Nathaniel Thompson, and a trailer gallery.\n\nIt’s really a lot of fun, and definitely needs a reevaluation.\n\nBLUE PANTHER.

So be it, with the recent Blu-Ray trilogy, FRENCH NOIR COLLECTION, on view from the flic flicks at Kino-Lorber Studio Classics/Gaumont.\n\nAs the 1950s wound down, the French nouveau wave was revving up. The Cahiers gang was about to expand from merely writing about American cinema to embarking on their own celluloid excursions. While Chabrol, Truffaut, and Godard were arranging their transfers, other directors and scripters, influenced by the newbies scribblings and the American imports, helped pave the way.\n\nTrue enough, some dark stuff had been coming out of France for years (Quai des Orfevres, Le Diable Souffle, Riffifi), and, by the mid-1950s there was a plethora of fine Gallic thriller fare – with the men and women both wearing the prerequisite trench coats (Diabolique, for example). Jean Gabin was already a “living legend,” and his slide into French noir was easy-peasy (he’d take up residence there for most of the remainder of his career). Jeanne Moreau, who had appeared with Gabin in Jacques Becker’s 1954 classic, Touchez pas au Grisbi, was prepping for her own femme fatale entries, and Lino Ventura, too, was becoming a force to reckon with…usually as a badass on-screen…(and frequently off-screen as well). All three artists are featured in this trilogy (spread over two platters, and housed in a slipcover), encompassing SPEAKING OF MURDER, BACK TO THE WALL, and WITNESS IN THE CITY.\n\nThe pics have been re-mastered in new exquisite 2K transfers and look magnifique.Each selection further benefits from readable (and optional) English subtitles. LSS, all offer the continental approach to continental ops, and, in doing so, take the nocturnal rain-slicked pavement dramas to a new level.\n\n1957’s SPEAKING OF MURDER (Le Rouge et Mils), stars the phenomenal Jean Gabin. There’s really nothing left to be said about this adept craftsman, save that he’s one of the greatest screen actors of all-time. With a career spanning over forty years, Gabin defined “natural” in ways only pale copycats could only dream of. You genuinely can’t spot him “acting,” as everything he does seems so real – each movement, gesture, line delivery; sometimes his art is so astounding that his fellow thesps in the scene are taken aback – he’s on-script but it sure appears that he’s responding as himself…yet in-character.\n\nOf course, he was roped in by Hollywood where he quickly mastered the English language, and starred in a couple of Forties crime pics; but it was in his native France that he truly shined. Better yet, he’s like the poster child for international noir (tailor-made for la trench coat), with such delicious titles as The Flesh is Weak, Night is my Kingdom, Deadlier that the Male, and Love is my Profession to his credit. His gifted talent has prompted wags to dub him as the French Spencer Tracy, another actor renowned for his “natural” abilities, and, who first gained movie fame around the same time as M. G. (the mid-1930s); I often wonder if it shouldn’t be the other way around – that Tracy should be pegged as the American Gabin. Even better, the gruff icon never had an albatross like Katharine Hepburn tied around his neck (Jean’s one-time extracurricular squeeze was Marlene Dietrich; game over!).\n\nIn SPEAKING OF MURDER, Gabin plays Louis Bertain, a prosperous owner of ultra-modern super-garages. It’s a lucrative business, but perhaps not that lucrative in relation to Louis’s extravagant lifestyle. Indeed, Bertain finances, fences, and money launders big scores from a series of elaborate robberies. But that’s not all; he’s into the thrill, and is an active participant – in fact, the handpicked gang’s leader. Louis’s acquiring other “respectable” investors/moles results in distrust among his top henchmen, primarily lead boy, the violent and psychotic Pepito (an early, and terrifying Lino Ventura).\n\nBut there are other chinks in Bertain’s vulnerable armor. His kid brother, Pierre, just released for serving time for a minor crime, is set to be taken into the family business (for the present, that is relegated strictly to the garages); unfortunately, the green twentysomething has become enamored with nympho tramp Helene (a ridiculously young and beautiful Annie Giradot)\n\n. Louis, always the playa, begins romancing the conniving skank via an alternate identity to prove to his bro what a ho’ she is. This doesn’t quite make it past their first date, culminating in a bitch-slapping moment for the ages.\n\nWhen Pierre overhears Louis and Pepito planning their latest caper, le chat is out of the baguette. Pepito goes rogue, as does Louis for a jaw-dropping climax.\n\nAs cowritten by its proficient director Gilles Grangier and Michel Audland (from a novel by Auguste Le Breton (who also wrote the dialog), SPEAKING OF MURDER is a loving yet ferocious homage to American noir, stunningly photographed by Louis Page. An outstanding jazzy score by Denis Kieffer appends the dark, wet pavement visuals in this nasty Parisian take on The Asphalt Jungle.\n\n1958’s BACK TO THE WALL (Le Dos au Mur) takes us through a dazzling labyrinth of deceit, passion, and murder – one of the most ingenious noirs ever concocted on either side of the ocean (by noted mystery author Frederic Dard, who adapted the pic from his novel Deliverez-nous du mal). Suffice to say, Francois Chevane’s script doesn’t waste a frame. The movie opens with a rather nasty murder and body disposal, then presents the reason.\n\nHappily married wealthy industrialist Jacques Decrey enjoys his life with beautiful young wife Gloria more than any deal he’s ever negotiated. That all goes south when he discovers his beloved is an adulteress, lustily involved with Yves, an aspiring, but impoverished actor.\n\nThe brilliant mind that gave Decrey his riches now works to destroy the two lives that wrecked his. He begins to blackmail the lovers, knowing they have no way of paying. When Decrey gets the first payment from Yves and Gloria (she begs hubby for a “no questions asked” loan), he banks it, and sends the next request. It’s a delicious cat-and-mouse game, but the malevolent financier doesn’t stop there. He begins playing psychological games on his wife, planting clues that suggest her strapped paramour is behind the entire “plot,” using the money to enrich himself.\n\nThis causes suspicion, and eventual hatred for her one-time perfect extramarital detour. It’s all excellently directed by Eduardo Molinaro, an underrated genre presence, leading to a climax that, shall we say, doesn’t disappoint.\n\nThe cast is spectacular, beginning with the amazing Jeanne Moreau as Gloria, and with a wonderful turn by Gerard Oury as the cuckolded spouse (he manages to be concurrently poignant, and despicable – not an easy accomplishment; Oury, we should note, was primarily known as a comic performer, and later a writer/director – helming the global success, The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob). As the sidebar lover, Philippe Nicaud excels as a suave lowlife who one believes can pleasure and even care for the insatiable adulteress, but is also capable of using her. Terrific support is provided by Gerard Buhr, George Cusin, Robert Bazil, Jean Degrave, and Les Girls de la Nouvelle Eve; last but definitely not least, we must give a nod to Claire Maurier as a worldly, sexy barmaid. In an instance of life imitating art, beauteous actress Michele Morgan was originally cast as Gloria, but she uncomfortably withdrew, as she was in the midst of her own secret torrid affair…with Oury.\n\nThe smooth, slick black-and-white photography is flawlessly delivered by Robert Lefebvre. Only the score falls under par. Usually, French noirs from this period contained jazzy music that ratcheted up the cool factor; here, we have a composition by Richard Cornu, that comes off more like a Hollywood B-horror flick, the movie’s only fly in the ointment.\n\nDirector Molinaro scores again with 1959’s WITNESS IN THE CITY (Un Temoin dans la Ville), giving then strong supporting actor Lino Ventura one of his first leading roles (and a memorable one).\n\nAncelin, an on-the-surface decent guy and hard worker, is thrown for a loop when his unfaithful wife is thrown in a different way – from a moving train. The culprit is the cheating wife’s lover, who, through slippery loopholes and smarmy legal tactics, is acquitted.\n\nTime for the widower to swing into action. Confronting the murderer, the villain shrieks that he’s been legally cleared – to which the cold-as-ice Ancelin replies, “I haven’t dropped the charges!”. Lambert, a cabbie, called earlier to pickup the now-deceased ex-lover, waits outside while his murderer steals away.\n\nAnd here is where WITNESS becomes interesting (if it wasn’t so already!). Sympathies change, and psychotic obsession begins, as Ventura’s Ancelin becomes convinced the taxi driver saw him, and will tell the police. But it was just a missed fare for the late night shift worker, and he merely matter-of-factly mentions it to his coworkers when news of the man’s discovered body hits the airwaves.\n\nBut Ancelin can’t risk it. Now maniacally fixated on this innocent bystander, he moves in on Lambert and the man’s would-be love interest Liliane – a fetching dispatcher.\n\nTurns out we learn that, yes, Ancelin is a decent man, but one with strange kink – a never-let-go violent tendency for vengeance. Disturbingly, we also discover that this compulsive nature had reared its ugly head once before.\n\nA wonderful, twisty changing lanes suspense nail-biter, WITNESS is exactly what you’d expect from the skilled minds of scriptwriters Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, who wrote the story for my favorite movie, Vertigo. (additional dialog and screenplay polish was contributed via an accomplished cartel comprising director Molinaro, the aforementioned Gerard Oury, Alain Poire, Georges Tabet and Andre Tabet). Aside from Molinaro’s top-drawer direction is the brilliant widescreen camerawork, courtesy of no less than Henri Decae (with Jean Rabier as camera operator!). A nice music track by Barney Wilen underlines the narrative, which, aside from the great Ventura, features a top-notch supporting cast, including Franco Fabrizi (as Lambert), Daniel Ceccaldi, Robert Delban, Jacques Jouanneau, Micheline Luccioni, Ginette Pigeon, and, the tres-gorgeous Sandra Milo (as Liliane).\n\nThe movie was made in cooperation with the Paris Radio Cab network, and the M-like climax certainly explains why.

In fact, in means a lot. He was largely responsible for the migration of the rarely-seen art house title to the Anglo acceptance of earthy foreign product that redefined Fifties cinema for grownups. Even Allegret’s wacky romcoms are tinged with strong carnal vibes (albeit in a more playful, delightful way). Some of his other works were out-and-out banned by the Church (the dumb way to ensure box-office through the roof). But Allegret was way more than a cinematic crusader of the flesh – he was a gifted filmmaker, who always allied himself with the best in front of and behind the camera. Truth be told, he was the mentor for several of the Cahier youngbloods (most notably Roger Vadim) – and when one views the elder’s work, one can easily see the influence.\n\nFortunately, thanks to Icarus Films, we can now enjoy two of the director’s most popular titles, 1953’s JULIETTA and 1955’s LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER, now available in meticulously restored 2K DVD transfers (via painstaking archival work from several sources, including Les Films Pantheon, Les Films Jeudi, and CNC).\n\nBefore we begin, I must address these titles’s formats. In the wake of 4K and Blu-Ray, DVD has almost taken on a worst-case-scenario option. Leave us say that a great DVD can look sensational, and often be mistaken for a 1080p platter. These are great DVDs.\n\n1953’s JULIETTA, based on the novel by Louise de Vilmorin, and scripted by Francoise Giroud, takes a Lubitsch/Wilder plot and gives us something never before seen (by post-war cinema audiences) – a 100% female take on teenage girl obsession, raging hormones, and bizarre comedic situations – all packaged in 93 minutes of screwball romcom delirium.\n\nTeen Julietta Valendor knows she’s hot, and blithely accepts her wealthy mom’s “arrangement” to marry her off to an equally affluent prince (mater wants that title in the family). Dancing alone along the beach during the waning days of her summer vacay, Julietta erotically sings “I’m going to marry a prince/I don’t love him…” Soon, she is met by her equally beauteous, but far more experienced sister, Martine, who drags sis back to their villa to prepare for the train trip back to Paris.\n\nMeanwhile, in the City of Light, the prince anxiously awaits the day he can have his nubile, smoking barely legal bride by his side. Rather than being an evil von Stroheim type royal degenerate, he’s actually a decent dude, resigned to the fact that he must do his best to convince la jeune fille to trust and (hopefully) love him. Rosie, the prince’s gorgeous gal-pal/administrative assistant (who obviously feels more than friendship for her employer/buddy), regrets that she isn’t going to the regal altar, and, resigns herself to the backup booby prize man in her life.\n\nEn route home, due to “meet cute” cinema at its craziness, Julietta becomes stranded with fellow passenger, Andre Landrecourt, a famed attorney and landowner. With a convention in town and all hotels booked, Andre arranges for Julietta to stay in his palatial digs until morning when he can put her on the next train to Paris. But the young woman is already smitten, and plots to stay, bed, and wed the poor schmuck – who must leave to collect his lover for the weekend…you guessed it, Rosie.\n\nMost of the remainder of the movie revolves around the principal trio running through the estate, amusingly avoiding each other in crazed gags that oft border on slapstick. In fact, the rapid pace and total sexual buffoonery reminds me of the frantic Allan Dwan romantic comedies of the 1940s (Up in Mabel’s Room, Getting Gertie’s Garter); except here, the coital aspect – both in sparkling dialog and shameful (but funny) uninhibited lust – is heightened to the point where Columbia, the pic’s Anglo distributor (and likely co-financer via frozen funds) held the movie up for American release until 1957.\n\nThe cast is amazing – exactly who you wouldn’t expect. Julietta is portrayed by Dany Robin, mostly heralded as a fine “serious” actress (and best known to U.S. audiences for her roles in the Anatole Litvak drama Act of Love and Hitchcock’s Topaz); for the befuddled Cary Grant (or Dennis O’Keefe, if you got my Dwan reference) part of Andre, director Allegret chose Jean Marais, the actor immortalized in cinema for his starring gig in the original Cocteau version of Beauty and the Beast. Most fascinating is the choice for Rosie – a blossoming Jeanne Moreau. The fact that none of these stars are known for wacky comedy makes this treat even more ingratiating.\n\nOther top thesps include Nicole Berger (Martine), Bernard Lancret (the prince), Denise Gray, (Julietta’s social climbing mom), Francois Jous, Georges Chamarat, Renee Barell, and Alain Terrane.\n\nVisually, the movie offers viewers further pleasures, as it is photographed by the great and prolific Henri Alekan, cinematographer of the aforementioned 1946 masterpiece Beauty and the Beast (who began in the French film industry in 1931, working on such 1930’s Gallic classics as Fantomas, Fanny, and Port of Shadows; as d.p., he shot Wyler’s Roman Holiday, Topkapi, and Wings of Desire). The pic is awash with splendid lighting and sumptuous imagery, including locations at Boulogne-Billancourt. Additional pictorial joys include Marine, adorned in one of those (then) scandalous skimpy new things called bikinis, and, two bathtub scenes with each of the female leads (no doubt, this also added to Columbia’s sitting on the movie for four years).\n\nThere are some interesting background stories that emerged years after the pic’s release. Roger Vadim, burgeoning member of the New Wave, embraced Allegret, whom he called his mentor. True enough, Vadim has a production assistant credit on JULIETTA. His claims of how he helped get it made, however, are – shall we say – “creative.” Vadim swears that Marais hated the script by Giroud (who had worked on Renoir’s Grand Illusion), and refused to do the movie until he read the Roger Vadim rewrite. It’s a boast I find fanciful – and I’m being kind. In addition, Vadim likewise claimed that Allegret was ga-ga over the newbie filmmaker’s live-in girlfriend, Brigitte Bardot (then aged 18). Vadim adamantly maintained that he and Allegret desperately wanted – and fought for – Bardot to play the title role (admittedly, she would have been perfect). I can’t imagine that a high-profile project like this would EVER have eschewed a big star like Robin for an unknown. But that’s Vadim, ten percent talent, ninety percent bullshit.\n\nEven though Columbia denied the lucrative American market (and probably the UK, too) a peek at JULIETTA until 1957, it was a smash throughout France and the rest of Europe. By ’57, when it hit our shores, the “lascivious” nature of the movie had become a minor issue, as the foreign film market had already exploded on American shores, revelling in “adult” cinema – not only in art houses, but in nabes and drive-ins – a niche held for nearly a decade.\n\nThe Icarus Films DVD of JULIETTA, as indicated, looks resplendent in this new 35MM restoration. In French, with nicely translated (and readable) English subtitles, the movie’s audio further accentuates the title’s bubbly charm via a nicely composed score by Guy Barnard.\n\nIn the past fifty years, D.H. Lawrence’s 1928 novel of raw passion and adultery has practically become a motion-picture cottage industry. There have been remakes, sequels, prequels – softcore, hardcore, “after hours” TV takes, PBS mini-series, re-imaginings (outer space anyone?)…it never ends.\n\nIt’s therefore remarkable to think that it wasn’t until 1955 that the first film version was unveiled. And that’s what we have here, courtesy of director/co-writer Marc Allegret (who adapted the novel from Gaston Bonheur’s and Philippe de Rothschild’s play). The original story recounts a titled English couple, living in the country, whose wife – the beautiful, but cold Lady Chatterley is heated up by her colliding with the burly groundskeeper. Allegret’s pic was so influential that Lady Chatterely is often never portrayed by an English actress; the part (even when sticking to the Anglo roots) has become French to the max.\n\nUpdated to post-WWII, CHATTERLEY offers us a glimpse of the supposedly happy twosome. Alas, Lord C. was male-fate-worse-than-death wounded in the war, and can no longer satisfy his hottie spouse. She claims to not care, but we know better; those daily, sweaty horseback rides into the woods still can’t compensate until she eyes gameskeeper Oliver Mellors – barechested and chopping up logs with his massive axe.\n\nThe lady takes a fall off her steed and is revived in more ways than one in M. Hairy Chest’s cabin.\n\nOf course, we don’t really pity the cucked hubby, as he suggests that wifey take a lover, and even make a baby (to keep the lineage going). To these points the woman’s trashy sis Hillary likewise agrees (“You need a lover”). But refined Lady C. rebuffs this as outrageous – all the while getting railed like the 5:45 commuter special.\n\nThe scandal finally erupts, the wagging tongues flap rampantly; yet, because it’s French…things don’t necessarily end badly.\n\nI guess it’s a given that in the Fifties, LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER, the movie, would cause a scandal all its own. The title alone was responsible for its being banned in many English-language countries – 1955 America being the most prominent. The release of the pic caused a Supreme Court decision on pornography, foisted upon the citizenry by the high and mighty right wingers. Silly fools – had they learned nothing from Prohibition? Deny folks something for being wicked and bad, and they’ll positively kill to get their mitts on it.\n\nOnce again, Columbia served as the Anglo distributor – and watched their flick elicit controversy when or where ever it played. Art house screenings throughout the latter part of the decade, and into the 1960s branded the movie a cult classic. Seeing it now, though, one wonders what the whole brouhaha was all about. It’s certainly tame by even early Sixties standards, and definitely now comes off as an After School Special (especially when compared to the 1978 version starring Sylvia Kristel, today, also a “so what” shrugger).\n\nBut it was the first, and, thus, is important. The movie is also not a sleazy undertaking by any means, but a fairly large budget production, nicely cast, brilliantly photographed, and effectively scored.\n\nAs the notorious title character, celebrated French star and beauty Danielle Darrieux excels in spades. She’s appropriately icy and volcanic, as the scenario demands (before Bardot took over the ooo-la-la film industry as “BB,” Darrieux was referred to as “DD.”); Darrieux’s longevity in the Biz is legendary, from the 1930s (including a stint in Hollywood) to her death at age 100 in 2017. As her limp spouse, real-life Brit Leo Genn (speaking very good French) offers a respectable turn that also provides a twisted characterization – melding slimeball with sympathetic. Tunisian thesp Erno Crisa physically embodies the gameskeeper with the required gusto while the supporting roster of gossips and hypocrites ably comprise the talents of Janine Crispin, Gerard Sety, Berthe Tissen, Jean Michaud, Jacques Marin, Jacqueline Noel, Christian Marquand, and Rene Lord.\n\nThe photography, as mentioned, is spectacular – filmed in Val-de-Marne by the great Georges Perinal (a favorite of Michael Powell, Carol Reed, and Otto Preminger). A suitable score by Joseph Kosma appends the cinematic package.\n\nThe Icarus Films DVD of LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER looks every bit as good as JULIETTA, falling short only in the audio department (albeit slightly); the mono track exhibits a noticeable amount of sibilance during the 100-minute running time.\n\nLike JULIETTA (and other Icarus titles), it is a classy presentation in both visual quality and jacket packaging. I truly love this company.\n\nJULIETTA\n\nLADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER.\n\nBoth Black-and-white. Full frame [1.33:1]; mono audio [French with English subtitles] Icarus Films/Les Films du Jeudi/CNC.

It was based on a popular novel (Legitime Defense) by Stanislas-Andre Steeman that the director had read during the war, but now (1946) could not find a copy. His screenplay (which he co-authored with Jean Ferry) was culled mostly from memory – so vivid was the original literary source (hopefully, the author was paid for the screen rights).\n\nIt’s easy to see what attracted Clouzot to the novel, as it seems tailor-made for the director – packed with his dominant themes: infidelity, murder, deception, conspiracies, and, most relevantly, the oft truism that the majority of people are untrustworthy specimens deserving of your hate. Way to go, Stanislas-Andre and Henri-Georges!\n\nIn the (contemporary) mid-late 1940’s French showbiz world resides a fascinating creature named Jenny Lamour (formerly Marguerite Martineau). She’s a beauty and she knows it – clap your hands; not a pun, but a must since she’s also an aspiring actress and songstress, and craves applause.\n\nJenny is married to docile Maurice who on the surface seems to be a cuck, but he’s well aware of his wife’s treacherous peccadilloes and lets it slide; so he’s a dumb cuck. The weird thing is that they genuinely love each other, and that she would never consider leaving him. The horny stuff is purely an act to fuel her career; Maurice’s jealous lip-biting blind eye is wholly due to his, too, being in show business – a well-respected behind-the-scenes stage guy/accompanist. Yeah, he doesn’t like it, but he gets it.\n\nEnter Dora Monnier – a renowned photographer, who’s as gorgeous as her models. She is now Marguerite’s/Jenny’s principal visual publicist/shutterbug. Prob is, she was Maurice’s former lover – and she still carries the torch for him. Prob-plus is that she’s also falling for Ms. Lamour.\n\nWhat a world, what a world…\n\nDora makes a nice sidebar living shooting porn for rich perverts – the prime client being aged hunchbacked film producer Georges Brignon (the role Tully Marshall was born to play, and the character von Stroheim was born to celebrate). He brings comely pickups to Dora’s studio for “studies,” which he then, in the privacy of his apartment, drools over – with every part of his body. Ogling Jenny one afternoon, he immediately offers her a movie contract, and she gobbles the bait with the promise of more oral activity to come.\n\nLying to her husband (a visit to her sick granny), Maurice uncovers the truth, and creates an alibi at the theater – before going off to Brignon’s abode, lock and loaded.\n\nOnce there, he finds the little slimeball’s body; he panics, bolts, and wanders aimlessly through the nocturne, as his car has been stolen.\n\nMarguerite confesses to Dora that she clobbered Brignon with a champagne bottle during an attempted rape, and is now worried that committing a murder may hamper her debut into the motion-picture industry. The photographer learns that her favorite subject left an article of clothing at the crime scene, and volunteers to retrieve it.\n\nThis all becomes a confusing mess for elite Inspector Antoine, who is assigned to the case. Antoine is actually the main protagonist of the piece, and is wily in that Gallic way that only the French can be (very Maigret, but with way more baggage and snarkiness).\n\nHe is “the” man from the movie’s title locale (roughly translated as “headquarters,” and in France is the equivalent of Scotland Yard; outside of its native country, the pic is often referred to as Goldsmith’s Quay, and, was also released in some Anglo parts of the globe as Jenny Lamour). A widower and former Foreign Legion officer (who left to join the Paris police with his mixed marriage son), the inspector approaches every case with the undeniable given that everyone is a scumbag – a strategy that has never let him down. He soon discovers that the producer’s death was from a gunshot wound, not a bottle of vino – so there’s yet another suspect. Apparently, Brignon’s flat was more popular than Amazon during Prime Day.\n\nHow it all is solved is first-rate cinema, delivered by a A-list cast. Louis Jouvet is superb as Antoine, with Suzy Delair (Marguerite/Jenny), Simone Renant (Dora), Bernard Blier (Maurice), and Charles Dullin (Brignon) not far behind. Additional prime thesp backup is provided by Pierre Larquey, Jeanne Fusier-Gir, Claudine Dupuis, Leo Lapara, Henri Arius, Charles Blavette, and, in pre-star screen appearances, Dora Doll and Christian Marquand.\n\nThe stunning black-and-white camerawork by Armand Thirard often recalls the monochrome magic of Gregg Toland – utilizing several instances of deep focus. The music score by Francis Lopez is excellent as well, and features several tunes ably warbled by Delair (“Avec son Tralala,” “Danse avec Moi”).\n\nOf course, it’s all held together by the expertise of director-writer Clouzot, who here prefigures some of his finest subsequent efforts, including Dialolique and Le Verite.\n\nIn a case of life imitating art, a romantic kerfuffle permeated the filming. Clouzot was involved in a torrid affair with costar Delair (whom he discovered), but ended it when the wife of one of the costars (Lapara) came to see her husband work. The wife was Vera Gibson-Amado, who soon took Delair’s place, and later became Mrs. Clouzot, starring in several of her husband’s classic pics.\n\nAs indicated, the recent Blu-ray 4K remaster of QUAI DES ORFEVRES is excellent. There are a number of absolute “must” supplements included, key being a 1971 French TV program, Au cinema ce soir, featuring interviews with Clouzot, Delair, Blier, and Renant.\n\nA sexy, sarcastic, wonderfully entertaining mystery, QUAI DES ORFEVRES should occupy a space on every noir lover’s shelf.\n\nQUAI DES ORFEVRES.

SRP: $29.95.\n\nFRENCH TOASTS\n\nOne of the most intimate romantic dramas ever to go before a camera, Georges Lacombe’s 1946 MARTIN ROUMAGNAC, a longtime Holy Grail pic for international star-gazers, finally comes to home video in a stunning DVD restoration, thanks to the movie-lovers at Icarus Films/Les Films du Jeudi/CNC.\n\nThe reason for all the commotion about this pic – fairly obscure in Anglo regions – was the volcanic teaming of Marlene Dietrich and Jean Gabin. The former, after an appearance in a lackluster remake of Kismet (1944) sought artistic vindication by accepting the female lead in the French flick starring one of their country’s greatest stars. Gabin, too, had been less than pleased with his 1942 American debut (Moontide). The collision of these two pitbulls promised for some potentially rough times ahead; instead, the opposite occurred.\n\nThe story is classic – on and off the screen. On screen, we are treated to the tale of the title character – a successful builder in a French province, known for his fairness, kindness, and toughness. Living with his sister, he has accumulated a small empire – his construction work renowned throughout the local suburbs. Life is good.\n\nThen, there’s Blanche Ferrand. She, too, lives with a relative who owns a pet shop. Our intro to her is via a disgruntled lover arriving for a date, only to be told that the lady in question is not on the premises; she has gone out with a more promising prospect. When we at last initially eye Blanche, descending from the apartment steps above the shop, it rivals Barbara Stanwyck’s entrance in Double Indemnity. And that ain’t chopped liver! Mlle Ferrand is an experienced woman of the world, to put it mildly. She loves physicality, and the material gifts that go with it. Of course, there’s a name for that – and we never truly learn if Blanche is a pro, or merely a gifted amateur. Bored with small town living, she attends her first prizefight; she is appalled, but is instantly taken with ardent fan Roumagnac.\n\nThey “accidentally” meet later – an innocent date that turns into a fierce sexual relationship. Martin, who will not deny her anything, offers to build her a magnificent house (which she doesn’t even want, but doesn’t refuse).\n\nIt drains his wealth, and professional reputation. Soon, he is losing the business he spent years cultivating. All is consumed, but his (and her) lust, which leads to jealousy (a trip to Paris reveals that apparently every male in the city “knows” her).\n\nLong story short: Marlene turns it on full blast, and it’s Lola-Lola time all over again. The grim ending is quite adult (especially for 1946) and even shocking.\n\nLacombe’s and Pierre Very’s excellent, often sarcastic script (from a novel by Pierre-Rene Wolf) gives the two stars lots to chew on; their doomed liaison is believable, as are their characters – with the possible geographical exception of Dietrich playing an Australian. The supporting cast is superb, and includes Margo Lion, Jean d’Yd, Jean Darcante, Marel Peres, Camille Guerini, Henri Poupon, Lucien Nat, Paul Amiot, Marcelle Hainia, and, in an early but pivotal role, Daniel Gelin. The black-and-white photography is spectacular, and showcases the work of Roger Hubert (the brilliant cinematographer of Children of Paradise). All of this is underlined by a nice score, composed by Marcel Mirouze and Giovanni Fusco.\n\nThe direction is the essence of professionalism, but most of the kudos must go to the powerhouse chemistry of lead couple Gabin and Dietrich. You see, this is where the off-screen part figures in big time. The pair passionately ignited from the get-go, and every bit of their attraction toward one another is up there for us to behold with jaws sufficiently dropped. Now, to be honest, we know of Dietrich’s many affairs with her leading men – classic naughty Hollywood tales that provided unending gab for Golden Age gossips. This transcends all of that; it’s reciprocal true love. You can see the eye contact, the breathless hanging on to every word uttered (from both sides). A scene in a Parisian hotel room, where their plans to visit a casino is delayed due to their sexual incendiary nitro is one of the most erotic scenes ever put on film. Indeed, Marlene’s immortal legs undergoing an awesome and hurried stocking removal remains one tick shy of real-life foreplay couples porn.\n\nOf course, with two such strong personalities, it was a relationship unlikely to last. And it didn’t (both were married to other spouses anyway); but while it did, oh, brother! And it’s there for us to spy on.\n\nThe publicity for MARTIN ROUMAGNAC practically guaranteed its success across Europe, while damning it to near-banning mode everywhere else. It was finally released (as an art house title, and cut by nearly a half-hour) in the English-language world, under the lascivious title The Room Upstairs (referring to Dietrich’s apartment above her pet shop). Critics were lukewarm to the pic, but couldn’t deny the explosive energy between the stars. For years, collectors looked for a decent complete print (god-awful, edited dupes being the only material often available). The new 4K restoration is cause for Dietrich and Gabin fans rejoice. It’s near pristine 35MM, and looks as gorgeous as Marlene herself. And, for all those wary of the movie (“with those two costars, why haven’t I heard of it…?”), take a deep breath, and allow yourself a pleasant surprise. Even with Ms. D being gone from the narrative’s last act, Gabin’s formidable presence keeps the action going. To be concise, it’s a pretty good way to spend 108 minutes. Especially, if you’re a voyeur. Just bring a fire extinguisher.\n\nMARTIN ROUMAGNAC. Black-and-white. Full frame [1.33:1]. Mono audio [French w/English subtitles].

Old Hollywood was dithering, not knowing where to go or what to do. Hitchcock, post-Blow-Up, freaked he could never make a picture like that. Paramount’s biggest movie was Rosemary’s Baby, directed by upstart Roman Polanski. Warners had Bonnie and Clyde, and indy Joseph E. Levine turned out his most profitable effort ever, The Graduate. But Columbia was, as they colorfully used to say then, “the real shit.” The former home of Harry Cohn and The Three Stooges had been taken over by the youthful “guys with the beards,” as Billy Wilder referred to the suitless suits. Indeed, the Gower Street concern was now basically the stomping ground for BBS Productions (the triumvirate of Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson, and Steve Blauner), who had made a fortune with the creation of the short-lived bubblegum band The Monkees). You knew something was crazy wrong when a striving-for-legitmacy AIP turned down Easy Rider. BBS picked it up and made gazillions for Columbia, proving that the new kind of movies didn’t have to be beautifully shot, or have clearly recorded sound, or even be properly lit (the latter being the opposite for its participants). The era made superstars out of grindhouse staples and weird supporting actors – and detonated the floodgates for more of the same. Columbia, within a few years, released 5 Easy Pieces, The Last Picture Show, Shampoo, etc., etc. That said, perhaps their (and the industry’s) most celebrated kiss-off to the Sixties was 1969’s BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE, forever identified by a couples quartet still of supposed bed-hopping free spirits. And, goody, it’s now on limited edition Blu-Ray from the groovy denizens at Twilight Time huddled under a serape with the scraggly granola-eating staff at Columbia Pictures Industries.\n\nThe movie cuts immediately to the chase. Phony baloney upscale white couple Bob and Carol Sanders journey as fast as their sports car can vroom them to the retreat known as The Institute, a sexual freedom mountaintop dream meet for horny, aging rich people, never-enough nymphos (“I came because I want a better orgasm”), contradictory affluent hippies, and such. We instantly see a line of sun-worshipping naked hotties in Buddah squat position seemingly welcoming the scores of PhDs, CEOs, and STDs. Bob and Carol fit right in. They are a thirtysomething couple whose pretense for the visit is the former’s profession. He’s a successful documentary filmmaker (another contradiction!) out to record this mutating congregation of essentially hippie sexuality but without the bad hygiene (believability isn’t enforced by the lavish, immaculate surroundings, or the fact that their leader is Greg Mullavey, later Mary Hartman’s husband).\n\nThe weekend has a pronounced effect on the Sanders. They now know that by spiritually loving everything they can physically love anyone. They’re that full of shit (truth be told, they were probably at diaper capacity before the retreat). They amaze their besties, the Hendersons – a married uptight lawyer couple – with their newfound bs-erry. What’s more astounding is that the Sanders and the Hendersons (aka, Ted and Alice) could EVER have been BFFs.\n\nThe movie moves on as roaming film dude Bob has affairs, but justifies them by revealing all to Carol (“Bob’s had an affair. Isn’t that great!?”); Bob is less than pleased (at first) when Carol reciprocates with Horst, the tennis pro from their exclusive country club.\n\nAll of this compels Ted and Alice to become near-suicidal before they decide to give in during an excursion to Las Vegas – allowing us the aforementioned famous bed moment before making the final obvious statement: no matter WHAT your agenda, all people are full of crap.\n\nOnce one understands this, the movie is a hoot – although I still want clobber most of the cast, especially the Sanders. Nevertheless, director and co-writer Paul Mazursky (who scripted the piece with Larry Tucker, best known as Pagliacci, the psycho ward inhabitant in Sam Fuller’s Shock Corridor) manages to make BCTA an often hilarious dissection of over-privileged idiots out to reap the rewards of the sexual revolution. Luring top-billed Natalie Wood into the fray was major – and she’s great in it (and, admittedly, outrageously sexy). Robert Culp, as Bob, didn’t quite come off as well as the rest of the cast – although he’s great/grate as well (I kinda think he actually believed all the paisley manure, possibly wore those ruffled shirts, chains and spouted all the cringe-worthy phrases like “where it’s at,” “far out/out of sight,” “I can dig it,” and “mellow/bummer”).\n\nThe real winners in the pic were Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon, who became A-list stars because of their enactments of Ted and Alice (Gould’s candle power lasted nearly a decade!). The supporting cast is likewise memorable, and comprises Lee Bergere, Horst Ebersberg (as, you guessed it, Horst), K.T. Stevens, Donald F. Muhich, Celeste Yarnall, Lynn Borden, Linda Burton, Leif Garrett, Joe Pine, as well as Fellini-finale bits from Mazursky and Tucker.\n\nUnlike Easy Rider (a movie I detested then, and still do now), BCTA adopted a cinematic style reminiscent of the Golden Age. LSS, the widescreen Eastmancolor photography by veteran Charles Lang looks terrific. On the flip side, in another nod to the “times they are a-changing,” the music score is by Quincy Jones, with the now-iconic climactic tune “What the World Needs Now” by Burt Bacharach and Hal David (and here sung by Jackie DeShannon, then riding high due to her chart-buster “Put a Little Love in Your Heart”), like the pic, going through the roof.\n\nBy the time BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE came out, my family no longer summered in Fleischmann’s, NY. We were now ensconced in the lesser picturesque, but more teen-active rural hills of Budd Lake, NJ. For me, this was cataclysmic, as the movie theaters were no longer within walking distance. I was, thus, at the mercy of the car-driving adults. Worse, movie excursions were usually navigated by the so-called “cool kids,” a group I was definitely not a member of. My rare invites were only sanctioned when another body was needed for a carpool (generally because the first-choice mooks had already seen the designated movie). I had, in fact, often seen some of the selected titles earlier that year myself (Rosemary’s Baby), but never gave up a chance for the cinema (I recall most of these flicks were screened at a theater called The Strand, in the neighboring duchy of Hackettstown). Sometimes I lucked out (The Wild Bunch was a “go”); other times not (Once Upon a Time in the West was a “are you fucking kidding!?”). In the interim, there was Airport, The Russians are Coming, My Fair Lady, Goodbye Columbus, Chisum, The Big Mouth…obviously, a mixed bag). BOB & CAROL was a must; I figured I wasn’t going to embrace it, but I absolutely had to see what the fuss was about. I fully didn’t appreciate the pic until decades later, when the title was tinged with nostalgia; truthfully, it’s a great period piece\n\nI also fondly recall that my sister got involved with a publication that wanted to supply first-run movie audiences with the equivalent of Broadway’s Playbill. BCTA was the initial and (to my knowledge) only issue ever printed.\n\nThe Twilight Time High Def Blu-Ray of BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE is a superior transfer (you can practically discern every hair on Gould’s Brillo-embroidered chest). The mono track’s music can be accessed as an IMS. Other extras include two supplemental commentaries – one by motion-picture historians Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman; the other a vintage recording featuring then-surviving crew and cast members (director Mazursky, and costars Culp, Gould, and Cannon). There’s also a mini-doc, Tales of BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE.\n\nMore than a half-century later, BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE‘s notorious salaciousness is bupkis. Honestly, at best, it’s like a Love, American Style episode, directed by Joe Sarno. Still, as a relic of the late Sixties, it’s an quintessential embryonic “oh, wow” title that satirically dealt with counter-culture (although, I must, say, I prefer I Love You, Alice B. Toklas – also a Hackettstown Bijou special – way more).\n\nBOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE. Color. Widescreen [1.85:1; 1080p High Definition]; 1.0 DTS-HD MA. Twilight Time/Columbia Pictures Industries. SRP: $29.95.\n\nSUMMER MOVIE MEMORIES\n\nAn excellent action-adventure, based on a thrilling best-selling novel, 1965’s VON RYAN’S EXPRESS comes thundering into your collector’s platform via a terrific limited edition Blu-Ray steelbook, available (oh, the irony) as a German import (from WVE/SpiritMediaGMBH/20th Century-Fox Entertainment) through Amazon.de (“de” for Deutschland).\n\nWith the enormous success of the 1963’s The Great Escape (another summer pic I loved), rival studios – as they’re wont to do – jumped at the chance to repeat the box-office by searching high and low for ANYTHING involving a POW escape, ideally from the Nazis. Manna from Heaven arrived on the bookshelves via the acclaimed hit novel by David Westheimer. It was almost instantly snapped up by Hollywood, with Fox being the winner. Soon, the trades released the news that Frank Sinatra had been signed as the lead.\n\nThe story is quite the non-stop adrenaline squirter: a group of American, British, and anti-fascist Italian POWs, having had enough of incarcerated kraut cruelty, plot and succeed with a massive escape – the Nazis (natch) in hot pursuit. Managing to hijack a train, they hope to reach a portion of the Euro theater where they might rejoin their forces, or, better yet, maneuver the railroad into neutral Switzerland. Yep, folks, it really is as exciting as it sounds.\n\nWhat was equally heart-stopping in an anti-fun way was the actual production, brilliantly chronicled in Saul David’s 1981’s autobiography, The Industry, still, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written on motion-picture making in the waning studio days of the mid-1960s.\n\nDavid, who began his career in publishing, had a taste for the Movies, and soon finagled a producing deal at Fox, with VON RYAN, a plum assignment, being handed to him as a formidable test (it had been, after all, based on a huge book hit – a connection to David’s roots).\n\nFireworks began almost immediately on-location between the novice filmmaker and veteran star Sinatra, the latter playing every bit the Hollywood icon. Frank had sequestered a remote villa for himself and entourage, where he partied voraciously. While he was rarely absent for morning shoots (“film around me”), he was often never on time. That was nothing.\n\nSinatra at once sized up David as a newbie creampuff, and walked all over him, chiding the would-be mogul with the nickname “Mr. Producer,” and not in a complimentary manner. David took it, grateful that the remainder of the international cast behaved themselves – a nifty roster that comprised Trevor Howard, Raffaella Carra (the prerequisite hot female character, not in the book – who seemed to have been a resurrection of the Gia Scala part in Guns of Navarone), Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni, John Leyton, Edward Mulhare, John Van Dreelen, Adolfo Celli, Vito Scotti, Richard Bakalyan, Michael Goodliffe, Ivan Tressault, William Berger, James Sikking, Wolfgang Preiss, and a recently signed contractree, James Brolin.\n\nHe also was thankful that director Mark Robson proved easy to work with. Robson, the least of the key Val Lewton directors (Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise) had helmed 1957’s Peyton Place, a slam-dunk smash for Fox. He could do no wrong, despite his being a totally pedestrian talent. David remembered watching rushes in an Italian movie theater-turned-screening room, and realizing that, while professional, there was really nothing special about the footage. This was agreed to by the only other person in the joint, who made his presence known by criticizing the scenes as “one-two-three KICK! One-two-three KICK!…” The intruder was revealed to be none other than Darryl F. Zanuck, who pretty much told his producer to not expect any Oscars.\n\nAs his ulcers increased, David next had to negotiate an upcoming train chase through Rome – not with Italian authorities, but with Sinatra. When David outlined his schedule, Sinatra made it clear that this clashed with his Italian location schedule. As a result, the movie has some sensational actual on-location thrills atop a train – with the matching cuts being against a soundstage back projection.\n\nSpoiler alert below\n\nBut that wasn’t the ultimate heart attack topper. As production was winding down, Frank mentioned to David that it was getting stale – that the script by Wendell Mayes, Joseph Landon, author Westheimer, and even David himself needed a little something to get it off its feet. “Don’t worry,” said the From Here to Eternity Oscar-winner, “I got it figured out.” David was almost afraid to ask. “Von Ryan dies.” Mr. Producer nearly keeled over. The weeping would-be mogul reminded his star that he couldn’t do that – that the movie was based on a celebrated novel, that he couldn’t just change the ending, that, that… “Von Ryan dies,” repeated the Chairman of the Board.\n\nStressed to the max, David contacted the Fox suits back in California. After a lengthy back and forth, David meekly but positively re-approached Sinatra. “We’ve come to an arrangement.” “Which is?” “We’ll shoot both endings.” A smug Sinatra did the telltale death signal, talking about himself in the third person. “Frank says ‘no’!” The star underlined his disapproval with an admittedly valid response – in essence, that anytime you give those dumb Hollywood bastards a choice, they’ll invariably choose the wrong one.\n\nThe alternative was that Sinatra might walk, leaving David, wondering if he could get his old New York publishing job back, totally screwed.\n\nThus, the most nail-biting, grueling episode came when a first cut was shown to the author. David, while no Sinatra fan, nevertheless decided to do the noble thing, and take the bullet. As the end credits rolled, a shocked Westheimer turned to David, the color drained from his face. Before David could throw himself under the bus, Westheimer, with tears in his eyes, cried – fortunately salty eye droplets of joy. He thought the change was nothing short of sensational, and was astounded that such a climax hadn’t occurred to him while he was writing the novel. LSS, the author termed the new ending as an improvement on the book. Thankful he didn’t take credit, David responded with “It was Frank’s idea.” He also, no doubt, recalled Dino’s sober comment, “It’s Frank’s world, we just live in it.”\n\nVON RYAN’S EXPRESS went on to become a tremendous critical and box-office hit in the summer of 1965. As a reward, David was handed two big Fox projects, both of which became blockbusters, Our Man Flint and Fantastic Voyage. His future was assured (at least as assured as anyone’s future can be in Hollywood). Sinatra, in turn, was given a lucrative three-picture deal at 20th.\n\nThe import steelbook of VON RYAN’S EXPRESS is simply gorgeous, doing justice to d.p. William Daniels’s fine CinemaScope photography – the usually negligible warm DeLuxe Color looking vibrant and often spectacular. The excellent mono tracks (featuring a great Jerry Goldsmith score) are available in either English or a German dub, so collectors need not worry about language probs (extras include a photo gallery). That said, it IS a PAL Region B disc, so an all-region player is required to watch it (we’re Region A). If you’re in possession of the proper High Def equipment, pick it up – preferably along with a copy of The Industry. It’s well worth the search.\n\nVON RYAN’S EXPRESS. Color. Widescreen [2.35:1; 1080p High Definition] 2.0 DTS-HD MA. Region B only. WVE/SpiritMediaGMBH/20th Century-Fox Entertainment. Available through Amazon.de. SRP: $29.95 (approximate)."
