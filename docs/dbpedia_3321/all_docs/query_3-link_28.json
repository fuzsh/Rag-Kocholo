        "text": "“The Trouble with Harry” is Alfred Hitchcock casually meandering out of his element. Taking a hike into the hills of comedy, he spends the film sowing horror like apple seeds across small town America.\n\n“Harry” has the lush visual presentation of a Sirk picture, but the absurdist malice of later auteurs, from Kubrick to the Coens. It’s no surprise that the mixture of formality and satire only befuddled audiences of its time. “Harry,” was dead on arrival.\n\nIt’s telling of Hitchcock’s particular brand of mischief that “Harry,” along with “Shadow of a Doubt,” were cited as his own favorites amongst his work. To the British Hitch, small town America was just a virginal spring waiting to be shocked into spoiling. …\n\nAction! - The Master & The Fan: Hitchcock's Bumping Road To Mastering Suspense\n\nHitchcock returns to the comedy genre with an odd picture about a group of individuals who come upon the corpse of one of the inhabitants and the mystery of how it wound up there as some of them try to dispose of it.\n\nThis is the most charming of Hitchcock's comedies, even though at 90 minutes, it gets somewhat sluggish and overlong, due to the fact that there doesn't appear to be a lot of material for such a length. However, it is entirely because to Forsyth and MacLaine's performances, whose chemistry is simply very delightful, that the picture ends up being somewhat entertaining. There are also some…\n\nWhen I saw him, he was dead.\n\nHe looked exactly the same when he was alive, only he was vertical.\n\nFast-forwarding a bit to 1955, this is one of four Hitchcock film’s I have left to view past the 50s (The Wrong Man, Topaz, and Family Plot remain).\n\nThe Trouble With Harry is one of the few box office failures of Hitchcock’s illustrious career that just so happens to be one of the director’s absolute favorites he ever made. The film had been a part of what was once called the “5 Lost Hitchcock’s” along with Rear Window, Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rope because the rights were gifted to his daughter Patricia. This homespun black comedy yarn provides jaw-dropping shots…\n\nTaking a break from his back-to-back delivery of nail-bitingly tense thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry presents the master director experimenting with his storytelling ability in a new genre and although most of his films do have little elements of humour in it, this film qualifies as one of the few true comedies of his career.\n\nSet in a small town in Vermont, The Trouble with Harry concerns the town's residents & their actions when they discover the freshly dead body of Harry on the hillside and are clueless about what to do with it. A darkly comic outing from Hitchcock, the film features some hilarious situations surrounding a dead body & also works as a light-hearted but effective mystery.\n\nSkilfully…\n\nMy trouble with Harry the first time I saw him was I just didn't get it. I was a teenager, a Hitchcock fan, and it came to a theater near me as one of the five films he kept locked away for 30 years. I remember that it looked fabulous, but I didn’t think it was funny.\n\nHarry lay buried for 30 years. I dug him up today and rewatched. I recognized the autumnal Vermont glow as a mixture of Robert Frost and Douglas Sirk. I knew Hitchcock was contrasting this beauty with the ugliness of death. I could the family resemblance between Harry and the Coen brothers.\n\nI understood the film’s comedy without laughing much. I could tell it…"
