        "text": "Talking to an actor like Gregory Peck is about as close as you’ll ever get to any Hollywood celebrity of his generation. He had been one America’s best-loved and most enduring stars for more than four decades when I met with him at the Brussels Sheraton Hotel for a twenty-minute interview in January 1986. Like millions of others across the globe, I had the pleasure of growing up with his work, which is a long string of amazing performances, emphasizing on the importance of being earnest. The integrity of the characters he always played was entirely his own, as I was about to find out when he entered the hotel room, shook my hand, and said, with a big smile, “Good evening, how are you? Shall we talk a little bit?”\n\nIf I remember well, the first Gregory Peck film I saw as a child was the family drama “The Yearling” (1946). It couldn’t have been more appropriate, and later on, when I saw his other films such as “Roman Holiday” (1953), a charming light-hearted story about a reporter in the make and a princess on the run (played by Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn), I knew then I would be hooked for the rest of my life on the films of both of them.\n\nEarly in his career, Mr. Peck appeared opposite established actresses as Greer Garson, Ingrid Bergman, and Jennifer Jones—a choice made by his agent, he had told a reporter. “Carole Lombard once said, ‘It takes ten pictures to make a star.’ If the audience accepts you over a long period of time, they become accustomed to seeing your face on the screen, and if they like you, they’re looking forward to your next picture.” And that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIn all, Mr. Peck appeared in fifty-four features from 1944 (“Days of Glory”) until 1991 (Martin Scorsese’s remake of “Cape Fear”). He made six films with director and Hollywood studio craftsman Henry King, two were directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and Ava Gardner was co-star in three films (in an interview many years later, he remembered her as ‘a woman so beautiful’). In thirteen of his films, he played men of authority (Sheriff, Captain, Lieutenant, Colonel, Commander, General, President), but he will always be remembered for his most memorable Oscar-winning performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer who defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in “To Kill a Mockingbird” (1962, set in the Depression-era South), undoubtedly one of the most outstanding films of the 20th century.\n\nWith a screen persona described as serious, decent, restrained, and intelligent, though—as some claim—never very exciting, Mr. Peck was blessed with slightly melancholy good looks and a baritone voice expressing strength, sympathy, and tenderness. On the screen, he expressed so much with his mere presence that he hardly had to act at all. He simply had to be there.\n\nBut I’d better move on and get started, or else my twenty minutes will be over way too soon.\n\nMr. Peck, most of the characters you have played so far are very dignified and sincere. And as President of the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences, you moved the 1968 Oscar ceremony until after Martin Luther King’s funeral. Morality is a key word for you?\n\nPeople have different ideas of morality. I think maybe a sense of correctness, a sense of doing a thing as it ought to be done, whether it is morally or because of intuition, or a sense of fairness and rightness; I think that’s part of me, yes. I remember when Martin Luther King was killed, I think that was on a Thursday [April 4], the Oscar broadcast was to be on Monday night [April 8], and there were some people who said, ‘The show must go on. It’s a network, worldwide broadcast, we can’t change the arrangements.’ But I felt it was not right. Martin Luther King was a great man who had brought about great changes in America for the better. So I thought we had to make an exception: the show need not go on. So with a little persuasion, we were able to change it till Wednesday [April 10, one day after the funeral], and I’m glad that we did. Now Martin Luther King has a national holiday; we celebrated it only a few days ago. Business stops, children don’t go to school, banks are closed. Only George Washington and Abraham Lincoln have such days in the United States. It’s become evident that he did make enormous changes in our way of life, certainly for many of the thirty million black Americans, with opportunities for better education, better jobs, a better standard of living, and their opportunity to become part of the political process. Much of that is due to Martin Luther King, so he is truly a great American. I’m sure we made the right decision.\n\nIn the 1940s, you received four Academy Award nominations over a five-year period, back then quite a remarkable achievement. How do you feel about that now?\n\nWell, those four times that I was nominated, I didn’t win. But I felt it would have been wrong for me to win. One year the winner was Laurence Olivier in “Hamlet” [1948], another year it was Fredric March in “The Best Years of Our Lives” [1946]… Those winners were people I respected, so I quite agreed with the voters. Then there was a long lapse of about thirteen years before I was nominated again. I had more or less given up on the idea of ever winning an Oscar [laughs]. I thought I’d be one of those people who’d be working steadily but won’t have an Oscar. But then it happened. “To Kill a Mockingbird” just came. The book was written, the rights were bought by Robert Mulligan and Alan J. Pakula, and they thought I would be best for the role of Atticus Finch. When they brought me in, I was able to arrange for them the financing and distribution of the film with Universal, so I became a kind of partner. And then it happened for me. I believe the Academy Award is an honest award, honestly given—given by the people who make films, either artists or technicians. So it has a special meaning, and also because it’s now about sixty years that it’s been given. It’s here to stay. Some awards come and go. Down in my basement, I have plaques and cups that were given to me thirty or forty years ago, and the institutions don’t exist anymore. But I will always be pleased to have won an Oscar.\n\nIs “To Kill a Mockingbird” the film you’re most proud of?\n\nAs I go about, I hear more about “Mockingbird” from more people. In America, it seems to have struck an emotional cord. It’s still played often on the television, and it’s even shown in the schools when they study the period of the civil rights struggle in the 1960s. The film has a special meaning for children of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years who are becoming aware for the first time that we had drastic racial segregation in our country up until the 1960s. And they also seem to be touched by the relationship between the father and the children, by the fact that he treats them more or less as adults, he gives them credit and respects their own intelligence, their own point of view, their own rights. That seems to appeal to a lot of young people. So I guess, whether it would be my own choice or not, it seems to be the choice of the public.\n\nYou appeared with Lillian Gish in “Duel in the Sun” [1946]. Her mentor D.W. Griffith was still alive back then [he passed away in Hollywood in 1948 at age 75]. Did you ever get the chance to meet him in person?\n\nNo, I never did. He was still living in Hollywood, but I never had the opportunity to meet him. He was not in circulation; he was retired. But Lillian Gish [1893-1993, age 92 at the time of this interview] I still see quite often: she’s not retired [laughs], she’s still very active. She won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute just a few years ago [1984, Mr Peck won his in 1989], so it’s wonderful to see an event like that, when they show her as a young woman, almost seventy years ago, playing in “Broken Blossoms” [1919] or “Way Down East” [1920]. Even though Hollywood is not unified, there is not a common feeling of collaboration and give and take between studios—it’s more doggy dog—we still have a few traditions. One of them exists through the Academy, which continues to honor and respect people whose careers are in the past. One time I took pioneer and film director Raoul Walsh [1887-1980] to the American Film Institute for a seminar and a Q&A session. He was about ninety-one at the time. He was a great character, wearing his eye patch. He still rolled his own cigarettes, and he was a very colorful, profane, outspoken character from an earlier time. He was tougher, more independent, and had more self-confidence about his way of life and his code of behavior, without compromise. So the students were asking him many of the usual questions about the old times, and then one of them asked, ‘Mr. Walsh, I understand that you were once an actor. Is that true?’ And he said, ‘Sunny Boy, I played John Wilkes Booth, the man who shot Lincoln, in “The Birth of a Nation” [1915]!’ And there he was, sitting before them. There was a moment of silence, and then they stood and applauded. About fifty or sixty young people. It was like seeing a ghost [laughs], but there he was. So in spite of the fact that the film industry is commercial, competitive, and rather cold-hearted these days, through the Academy and such meetings at the American Film Institute, we do try to keep some of that tradition alive. It’s important that we do. It’s important to have respect for the artists of the past, as well as for the latest two hundred million dollar blockbusters.\n\nThroughout your career, you didn’t do too many romantic comedies, but “Roman Holiday” [1953] for example, you all turned it into one of the all-time classics.\n\nWhen they sent me the script of “Roman Holiday,” I signed for the picture. But about two weeks into the film, I called my agent, and asked him about the official billing. The contract had been drawn up as: ‘Gregory Peck in “Roman Holiday,” introducing Audrey Hepburn.’ So I said, ‘We can’t do this; we will all look like fools. I’m sure she’s going to win an Academy Award for the role she’s playing, and even though it’s her first starring role in an American picture, her name has to appear above the title.’ Because when we were shooting in Rome, we already knew that she would hit the screen like a bomb. And there hasn’t been anyone like her before, and so far, there hasn’t been anyone like her since. She was really born to play the princess in the film. So, she did win the Oscar for “Roman Holiday,” she became a sensation, and everybody wanted to work with her.\n\nBrussels (Belgium),\n\nJanuary 27, 1986\n\n+ Gregory Peck passed away on June 12, 2003, at his home in Los Angeles, at age 87.\n\n“Roman Holiday” (1953, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nDAYS OF GLORY (1944) DIR Jacques Tourneur PROD Casey Robinson SCR Casey Robinson (original story by Melchior Lengyel) CAM Tony Gaudio ED Joseph Noriega MUS Daniele Amfitheatrof CAST Gregory Peck (Vladimir), Tamara Toumanova, Alan Reed, Maria Palmer, Lowell Gilmore, Hugo Haas, Dena Penn\n\nTHE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM (1944) DIR John M.
