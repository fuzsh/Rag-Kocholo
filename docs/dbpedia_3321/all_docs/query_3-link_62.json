        "text": "Click a decade to jump to that decade’s class notes.\n\nA special first semester of my sophomore year in college\n\nby Karen Lake De Vos ’59\n\nIn May of 1956, an annual evening event took place in the lounge of Mary Trowbridge Hall at Kalamazoo College—room drawing for the following academic year. It was instituted by Mrs. Mordhorst, our housemother, more fondly referred to out of her earshot as Mrs. Mordhouse, our horse mother! So, all us converged in various garb, including bathrobes, slippers, heads wrapped in bonnets covering pin curls, rollers, spoolies, etc. and made ourselves comfortable reclining on couches, chairs and soft carpeting.\n\nSince I would be a sophomore the following fall, two sets of us had decided we wanted to be suitemates as we knew we’d be eligible for a suite with an adjoining bath. One by one, each of us drew a number out of a big jar that would determine the order in which we would get to choose a desired room. Unfortunately, all four of us drew high numbers, which meant we couldn’t choose until near the very end. So, we sat together and paid little interest to what was happening. Eventually, out of the blue, the housemother announced that due to shortage of space in the dorm in the fall, four girls would have to live in a suite at the home of the college president and his wife, Weimer and Jean Hicks. When she asked for volunteers, the four of us, without consulting each other, quickly stood up and said we’d love to be the chosen ones. And, we were!\n\nWhen fall arrived, the four of us made our way to the president’s home to unpack and get organized for the following year. The president’s wife welcomed us warmly, but did emphasize some rules we needed to follow. One that really excited us was a cleaning lady would clean our rooms weekly. Another was that we needed to remember that we were subject to all the rules that the girls in the dorm observed. She said that we could use the kitchen 24/7, as long as we didn’t get in her way when she was preparing meals. She also mentioned that she’d love our help when she entertained faculty groups in their home, something we were delighted to do.\n\nAs we settled into our college life, we began to realize how lucky we were to experience life in a home, especially with the president! We saw much less of him, though, because he was quite a workaholic. His wife, on the other hand, had established a somewhat independent lifestyle that revolved around her duties as “first wife” that included playing serious bridge several days per week and frequent golfing at the country club in spring, summer and fall.\n\nDuring the day, many enjoyable hours were spent drinking coffee around the kitchen table with Jean. After sundown, our adopted parents usually spent time in their spacious den. On many of those evenings after “per” (time we were required to be in at night), we knew we were welcome to join them. The president sometimes questioned us on events and happenings on campus and sometimes we did the same with him. On one occasion in the fall, when the four of us felt that student morale was a bit low, we decided to pass that information on to him. We decided our approach would be tactful and truthful, but, at the same time, very firm! When we broached the subject to him, his first reaction was surprise and then he became a bit defensive. We stood our ground, but the conversation ended without our feeling we’d been successful. We retired to our rooms with the feeling we’d been overruled!\n\nFor the next few days life went on as usual. Then, at Friday morning chapel (required attendance), it was announced that classes would be cancelled for the remainder of the day. Wow! Imagine how confidently we strolled into the den after dinner that night to thank him for listening to us!\n\nSeveral of us were enrolled in a bowling and golf class taught by the football coach Rolla Anderson, in a small attic room above the gymnasium. He would always begin class by reminding us about the importance of sports in family life by proclaiming, “The family that plays together, stays together!” After being instructed on the essentials of golf, we were required to play 18 holes. We knew that Jean was a golfer and she graciously offered to take us with her to the country club to fulfill the requirement. After being outfitted with balls and clubs, we set out to use the skills we had learned in instruction. After it took us almost three hours to complete four holes, she indicated that it was time for her to sign our cards indicating we’d completed 18 holes!\n\nWhen the president and his wife entertained faculty at social events in their home, we four helped serve refreshments and had the opportunity to mingle with our professors and their spouses. Through those associations, we were able to establish babysitting opportunities that added money to our meager finances.\n\nJean’s birthday arrived and she was waiting for her husband to come home from his office to take her on a pre-arranged dinner date. We waited with her as the clock ticked away the minutes, half hours and hours. We finally went up to our rooms, but when we heard the front door open, we immediately leaned over the railing above the entrance and proceeded to sing, to the tune of “God Save the Queen”:\n\nKing Weimer had a date.\n\nHe Stayed out very late.\n\nHe was the King.\n\nQueen Jeanie paced the floor.\n\nKing Weimer came in at four.\n\nQueen Jeanie met him at the door.\n\nGod save the King.\n\nThen we quickly disappeared in case there might be fireworks! But all was quiet as we knew she was accustomed to his workaholic schedule. However, as I recall, he did make up for his forgetfulness!\n\nAt the end of the semester, there was available space for us back in the dorm and we sadly packed our things and moved back in. But we left knowing we’d be welcomed back anytime, particularly if we needed quiet and solitary study time. We even spent a few overnights there preceded by den visits beforehand.\n\nOur senior year arrived so quickly and when graduation was near, we received invitations to a farewell dinner in their charming dining room. We eagerly accepted, knowing that she was a great cook! When we were seated at the table, there was a wine glass at each place! Wow! She gave a toast to four mature and capable women ready to begin life in the real world.\n\nThe following year I taught in Kalamazoo, so was able to visit with them. First, it was by myself and then, as my husband John ’53 and I began courting, he would come along for visits, too, since he was an alum, but had graduated before they arrived at the college.\n\nWhen Dr. Hicks retired, they moved to Naples, Florida, where he died a short time later of a sudden heart attack. John and I had a wonderful visit with Jean during one of our Florida sojourns and then she, too, passed.\n\nOf the four of us roommates, three survive and remain close, even though lots of miles separate us. We have frequently reminisced about how fortunate we were to have had such a unique experience.\n\nThose surviving are: Mary Ann (Wise) Dawson ’59, Laura (Smith) Germer ’59, and myself, Karen (Lake) De Vos ’59. Deceased is La Von (Bennett) Marcus ’59.\n\nWith memories of the 60s, Elvis and the Beatles, ’66 classmates gathered in Cleveland, home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in October 2021. Field trips to the Cleveland Museum of Art, Holden Arboretum and Cleveland Botanical Gardens served as a counter balance to the frenetic sounds and images of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The autumn getaway featured great food at local venues including Edwin’s, the socially engaged restaurant and training center. Nightly wine-tasting was hosted by classmate and oenologist, Gene Losey. Kathy (Shaw) Kortge played the Dobro and Gene played the guitar for sing-alongs. The repertoire ranged from the Kalamazoo alma mater and fight song to Peter, Paul and Mary.\n\nBill Sevald ’69 has published his novella Sika, the story of a former sled dog and the young woman who befriends her, set in Greenland. Readers describe it as “an excellent coming-of-age story” with intrepid female characters. The novella is available at online e-book sellers. Prior to Sika, Bill published Fishermen from Heaven in 2018, and The Stuttering Jock’s Opera in 2016.\n\nDaniell Mattern ’70, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Mississippi, has been named to the Doctors Andrew Stefani and Eldon Miller Memorial Chair for STEM Teaching and Research and is the inaugural holder of the position.

When he died last December, editors at Christian Century magazine asked for my reflection, which they published in their January 26 print edition and online.”\n\nSusan Dobrich ’76 retired as Cass County probate judge at the end of 2021. Susan has been the probate judge since 1995 and has also taken on the role of chief judge over the last several years. When she was appointed prosecutor in Cass County in 1983, she was the county’s first female prosecutor and one of only three in the state. In 1987, she went into private practice for several years before running for probate judge; she was elected in 1994 and took office the following January as the county’s first elected female judge. Many of her proudest achievements come from her efforts in the Family Treatment Court and spearheading the establishment of problem-solving courts in the county.

Cathy considered herself a joy seeker and spiritual encourager. She had many other endeavors as well, such as helping build homes for indigenous communities and performing wedding ceremonies. Cathy found tremendous joy and abundance in the simplest things, devoted her creativity and energy in the service of others and “lived life imperfectly with such great delight.” She will be dearly missed by all. Cathy is survived by her parents, three siblings, beloved horse, two dear companion cats and many extended family members.\n\nFaculty, Staff and Friends of the College\n\nDorothy J.
