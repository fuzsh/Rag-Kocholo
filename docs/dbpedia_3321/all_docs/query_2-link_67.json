        "text": "Based on a 1941 musical (with music by Kurt Weill and lyrics by Ira Gershwin!), Lady in the Dark is equal parts completely outrageous and enormously intriguing.* Focused as it is on a woman undergoing psychoanalysis (magazine editor Liza Elliott, played by Ginger Rogers), the film's foundation is absurd on its face. It's full of things like magical dream interpretation (I love him because he reminds me of my father? GASP.) and fundamentally offensive linkings of their looks to the value of women, and masculinity with power, all of which are taken so seriously as to be laughable from a modern perspective.\n\nBut! The film also features surprising frankness about mental illness, and not only allows Liza to express her…\n\nWhile one time Hollywood dress designer turned prolific studio director Mitchell Leisen has a certain degree of street cred in auteurist circles for infusing his films with a grace and glamour that reflects his refined personal style and taste, he’s often been handicapped by the fact that some of his most beloved films were written by then soon to be higher profile directors Preston Sturges (Easy Living, Remember the Night) and Billy Wilder (Midnight, Hold Back the Dawn). It didn’t help Leisen’s reputation that Wilder was not a fan of his overreaching script edits and would publically slag him. In one Wilder biography he was quoted as saying “On TV I would watch only a picture by a director I…\n\nStrait laced, silly, surreal, sexist. There are plenty of fitting adjectives to describe Lady in the Dark. A mid-40s technicolour musical starring Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland, it follows a workaholic magazine editor suffering from mental stress as she reluctantly undergoes therapy to uncover exactly what ails her. And while what we discover is fairly intriguing - a character study rooted in repression, overcompensation and some pretty dated attitudes towards gender roles - what we see can be simply spectacular.\n\nThe majority of Lady in the Dark is set in the real world; a drab, uninspiring setting with a plain colour palette and ordinary costuming. As Ginger's therapy begins though, and she begins to explore the troubling dreams she has…\n\nDreamy Oz-ish Technicolor fable centered on one woman's psychoanalysis and the three awful men she has to choose between. The more Ginger films I watch the more I flash back to a moment in Shall We Dance (maybe Top Hat) where her character's young same-sex crush is made reference to. It's a little aside, but when films like this pathologize the type of woman Rogers ended up being, it's hard to not think about a world where she was more aware of her sexuality, aware of choices and options that existed for her. So many films - this included - implore her characters to marry and have a child, to settle down, to stop being so stubborn and domineering. Ginger…\n\nRay Milland calls Ginger Rogers boss lady a couple of times and I absolutely loved it. Even if his character was an absolute tool, he got a singing number and was decked out in purple glitter during one of the dream sequences, so really, it kind of made up for it. He also said, \"Rage is a pretty good substitute for sex, isn't it?\" Which is pretty risque for 1944, oh my god?\n\nI basically muttered OOH, it's COLOR every five minutes like I've never seen color before, because it was nice to see the 1940s and 1940s fashions come to life, and let me tell you, I was not expecting so much pastel.\n\nAnyway, I found the film problematic…"
