        "text": "Lizzy Caplan, who originated everyone's favorite Mean Girls character Janis Ian in the seminal 2004 movie, recently enjoyed a night at the theater to support Ms. Norbury AKA Tina Fey's Broadway musical rendition of the high school story.\n\nNot only did Lizzy hang out with the Plastics — including Regina George (Taylor Louderman) and Gretchen Wieners (Ashley Park) — but she also spent time with Barrett Wilbert Weed, who plays Janis on stage, E! News reported. Oh, and the four women went through the infamous Burn Book. Seeing on-screen Janice meet stage Janice is like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs, but it's also totally grool.\n\nLizzy isn't the only person loving the Mean Girls musical. The play was nominated for a whopping 12 Tony Awards this year, tying with SpongeBob SquarePants for the most nods of the season. Among others, the production is nominated for Best Book of a Musical, Best Scene Design in a Musical, Best Costume Design, Best Direction, and the coveted Best Musical award."
