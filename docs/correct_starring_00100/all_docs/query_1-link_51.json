        "text": "Not to be that person, but not every classic film needs a remake!\n\nOkay, first off, I consider myself a rather seasoned professional when it comes to early 2000s teen flicks, and ‘Mean Girls’ (2004) is undeniably one of the best of the genre and perfectly captures the quintessential ruthless, deadpan, and witty high school clique humor that we love to watch and quote. Mean Girls is an absolute cult classic and in my opinion, it is the ‘It girl’ of all teen flicks, though I wouldn’t consider it a rom-com. I am also one of those people who believes that not every classic film needs a remake, especially when it has such a huge name to hold up to. I could say that I’ve watched the 2004 mean girls maybe a little over 15 times and I know all that there is to know about it, and it is safe to say that I am not the only one who is this obsessed with the movie, I mean why wouldn’t anyone be? From the characters to the music choices to the drama to the outfits — everything about the movie works so well and this is why I think that the 2024 remake completely missed the mark with it.\n\nRight off the bat, as a big fan of the original movie, I have to say it wasn’t quite what I expected. It seems like opinions are all over the place: folks new to the story seem to love it, while those with high hopes were left, well, disappointed.\n\nHere’s the thing about musicals: the songs are supposed to move the plot forward and reveal character emotions. But in this case, the songs in “Mean Girls” felt a bit…obvious. Take Regina George’s entrance song, for example. It literally starts with “My name is Regina George/I don’t care who you are/ I don’t care how you feel.” Sure, it gets the point across, but it feels like the movie is spoon-feeding us Regina’s personality instead of letting her actions speak for themselves. Maybe for someone completely new to the story, this intro works. But Rachel McAdams’ Regina in the 2004 movie felt so natural — she was just undeniably mean, and that was that. This 2024 version feels like Regina’s trying too hard, and the songs constantly remind us of her meanness.\n\nMcAdams’ portrayal had a certain depth. Even though she was ruthless, there was a strange charm to her. Remember Cady saying, “I hated her, but I still wanted to be her friend… I couldn’t stop talking about her”? That complex mix of feelings towards Regina seems lost in the remake. Except for Damian (played by Jaquel Spivey)! He absolutely nailed the character, even adding some new layers. Honestly, Damian was the only truly fun part of the whole movie for me.\n\nAnother character change that rubbed me the wrong way was Karen Smith… er, Shetty (Avantika Vandanapu). Karen’s my absolute favorite in the original, and the remake’s take on her just felt like a charm vacuum. Same goes for Cady (Angourie Rice), but hold on, let’s tackle Karen first.\n\nThe writers went way overboard trying to make Karen seem dumb. Sure, that’s part of her character, but Amanda Seyfried’s Karen in the 2004 version felt genuinely confused, not like she was actively trying to be an airhead. Her deadpan delivery and cluelessness about social cues were hilarious. Avantika’s Karen, however, comes across as bizarre and in-your-face dumb. It’s like they took the “dumb blonde” stereotype and cranked it to eleven. Some moments with Karen were kind of funny, I've got to admit, but honestly, most of her character felt like a lack of research, even though Tina Fey wrote both movies.\n\nCady Heron’s portrayal wasn’t much better. Played by Angourie Rice, she just seemed lost and awkward. Maybe it was the delivery, but she often didn’t land the jokes, which is a big deal for the lead character.\n\nOn Wednesdays we wear… Shein?\n\nThe costume design was the final straw for me. As any fashionista knows, costumes can make or break a movie. And the outfits in the original “Mean Girls” are iconic! Think pinks, hot pinks, Juicy Couture, velvet tracksuits, flared jeans — all perfectly capturing the era. Plus, the way the characters’ clothes change throughout along with the usage of color psychology in the film is genius. Cady starts in army pants and button-ups, then transitions to baby blues, pinks, and subtle jewelry. Each character has a distinct look created by pairing different shades of pink with other elements. It’s a fashion feast for the eyes!\n\nSo, you can imagine my disappointment with the remake’s costumes. Drumroll please…they’re a total flop. Someone on Twitter perfectly summed it up: “The new ‘Mean Girls’ wardrobe looks like the Shein clearance rack haul.” Hilarious, but sadly true. The outfits lack the same spark and personality as the originals. Another character wardrobe that I hated was Janis’s. For one — the true goth essence of Lizzy Caplan’s 2004 portrayal vanished without a trace. Sure, goths can dabble in other colors, but the remake went full-on 2020s “e-girl” aesthetic, completely missing the mark on Janis’s original dark and edgy style. Maybe a minor quibble, but hey, the details matter!\n\nSpeaking of details, the writing felt like a tired Netflix teen show script — the kind penned by someone who hasn’t interacted with a teenager since dial-up internet was a thing. The original “Mean Girls” captured the essence of high school life without relying on tired stereotypes. This 2024 version? It reeked of someone who despises teens and has built their entire perception of them on outdated sitcom tropes.\n\nNow, I appreciate their attempt to integrate social media. Janis weaponizing TikTok for revenge? Regina’s accidental viral fame after a sabotage attempt backfires? I get that its has been 20 years since the original, intriguing ideas, but the execution left me wanting more. Look, at this point, I’m channeling Regina George herself — this remake was a fetch… attempt. Cute, even. But ultimately, it just wasn’t for me. So, to conclude: skip the 2024 version and rewatch the classic. Now that is what makes fetch happen."
