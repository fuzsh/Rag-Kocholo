Her main goal throughout the story is to get revenge on Regina for spreading rumours about her, and she does this through the use of new girl Cady Heron, who is enlisted to help Janis take down Regina.\n\nJanis' character was written by Tina Fey. The character originally shared a name with a folk singer who appeared on the series premiere of Saturday Night Live on October 11, 1975 and had a Top Ten single \"At Seventeen\", which reached no. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart in September 1975 when Fey was five years old. The song is a stirring critique on high school angst, popularity delusions and teen barbarity. The singer was outed in 1976 and came out as a lesbian in 1993 with the release of Breaking Silence, her album which confronts teenage suicide and related issues. \"At Seventeen\" is played faintly during a scene in the 2004 version of Mean Girls.[2]\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nJanis is of Lebanese heritage.[3]\n\nJanis was best friends with Regina George throughout her childhood and was previously very fashionable and feminine. This all changed in eighth grade after Regina got her first boyfriend Kyle. Janis was upset that Regina was spending more time with Kyle than her, which annoyed Regina to the point that Regina did not invite her to her birthday pool party. Regina told Janis that she did not invite her because she thought Janis was a lesbian. This resulted in Janis's mother calling Regina's mother and shouting at her. After the incident, Janis had shaved half her hair and left school due to being upset about Regina's treatment of her. During her time away, Janis developed a different style and expression and grew a bitter hatred towards Regina for making everyone think she was a lesbian.\n\nJanis returned to North Shore High some time before Cady Heron joined. She stayed away from Regina and befriended Damian Leigh in that time.[4]\n\nFor the musical film adaptation, the role of Janis Ian is replaced by \"Janis ʻImiʻike\",[5] an actual lesbian (\"Pyro-Lez\") infamous for lighting Regina on fire.[6]\n\nPersonality[edit]\n\nJanis is a punk rocker outcast who is witty, artistic, manipulative, and opinionated. She sometime can seem aggressive, she cares deeply about her revenge on Regina.[7][8]\n\nRole in Mean Girls[edit]\n\nJanis begins the movie as a social outcast, and is always seen with Damian. Janis befriends Cady Heron and encourages her to pursue a friendship with the Plastics when she sits with them on her second day, with the goal of using Cady to find a way to take down Regina George as revenge for their fall out. While Cady initially sees Regina as sweet, Janis warns her the opposite is true. After Cady returns to Janis's house from a Halloween party in tears after Regina kissed her crush, Aaron Samuels, Janis concocts a plan to take down Regina, by ruining her relationship with Aaron and the other Plastics, and making her body fat.\n\nWhile plotting against Regina, Cady learns about Regina and Janis's past friendship around 8th grade, which crumbled as Regina believed Janis was lesbian (and had a crush on her) and spread rumours because of it. Cady slowly stops talking to Janis afterwards and the two hardly talked by the time Cady successfully overthrew Regina. The friendship was broken after Cady lied about being unable to attend Janis's art show due to going to a show with her parents in Madison the same night, when she actually stayed home and threw a party without inviting Damian or Janis. When they find out about this, they drive to her house and chastise her, which collapses their relationship.\n\nWhen the Burn Book is released (where Janis is called simply \"dyke\"), there is a riot and then the girls have to attend an apology workshop in the gymnasium. During Janis's apology, she reveals everything that she and Cady had done to Regina and at the end of her speech, she jokes that the reason she hates Regina so much is because of her \"big, lesbian crush\" on her, before receiving cheers from the other girls. At the Spring Fling dance, Janis is nominated for Spring Fling Queen (as Damian had rigged the vote as a joke) alongside Cady, Gretchen and Regina. She loses the crown to Cady, but is given a piece of it from Cady as a sign of mending bridges and forgives her. Janis ends the movie being friends with Cady and Damian and having begun a relationship with Kevin Gnapoor.\n\nRole in Mean Girls (2018 musical)[edit]\n\nJanis was included in Mean Girls's musical adaptation of the same name on Broadway, with the last name changed to Sarkisian. The role was originated by Barrett Wilbert Weed.[9]\n\nJanis's character is similar to in the original film. While in the film, Janis befriends Cady in class, in the musical, Janis and Damian Hubbard befriend Cady in the girls' bathroom to help her find a way to fit in.\n\nIn the musical, Janis (along with Damian) functions as a narrator to the audience as well as a character in the story, occasionally directly addressing the audience, especially in the opening (\"A Cautionary Tale\").\n\nRole in Mean Girls (2024)[edit]\n\nJanis' character remains very close to the original 2004 film and musical, however one notable change is with her sexuality and ethnicity. Here she is openly queer and Polynesian instead of Lebanese. While the original film had the subtle final punchline of Janis being Lebanese as why Regina had thought she was a lesbian (having misheard her the first time she mentioned it), the 2024 film's versions sees Damien say that Janis came out to Regina by getting matching plushes with pride pins but that after playing a game of spin the bottle during a party, Regina began flaunting around the plush, naming it Sissy Lez, an abbreviation for \"obsessed lesbian\". This infuriated Janis so much she lit the plush on fire, which also caused Regina's bag to set on fire. Near the end of the film, Janis is seen attending the Spring Fling with an unnamed girlfriend.[10] She is now referred to by the surname ʻImiʻike and is played by Auliʻi Cravalho.\n\nReception[edit]\n\nJanis's character has been perceived as more villainous as time goes on, but the character is still positively received.[4][11]\n\nNotes[edit]"
