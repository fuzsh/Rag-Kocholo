        "text": "LOS ANGELES: Lizzy Caplan, known for films like \"Mean Girls\" and series \"Masters of Sex\", will play the female lead in \"Fleishman Is in Trouble\" set up at FX on Hulu.\n\nIt follows the story of recently separated fortysomething Toby Fleishman, who dives into the brave new world of app-based dating with the kind of success he never had dating in his youth, before he got married at the tail end of medical school.\n\nBut just at the start of his first summer of sexual freedom, his ex-wife disappears, leaving him with the kids and no hint of where she is or whether she plans to return.\n\nBrodesser-Akner will serve as the writer of the nine-episode series and will executive produce it along with Sarah Timberman, Carl Beverly and Susannah Grant.\n\nJonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the director duo behind \"Little Miss Sunshine\", will direct multiple episodes of the show.\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts with \"Fleishman Is in Trouble\", Caplan won't be joining the newly announced \"Party Down\" revival.\n\nOther cast members Ken Marino, Adam Scott, Jane Lynch, Martin Starr, Ryan Hansen, and Megan Mullally are all slated to reprise their roles in the cult classic, which follows a group of dreamers working on a Los Angeles catering team."
