        "text": "The cast of Mean Girls on Thursday joined forces to raise money for the Thirst Project, which is so fetch.\n\nLindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lizzy Caplan, Lacey Chabert, Jonathan Bennett, Rajiv Surendra, Daniel Franzese, Jan Caruana and Stephanie Drummond teamed up to film a video to promote their mission, which was shared on social media.\n\nOct. 3 has become known as “Mean Girls Day” by fans of the film, after a line in the pic when Bennett’s Aaron Samuels asks Lohan’s Cady Heron what the date is.\n\n“Today, of course, I’ll ask you what day it is,” Bennett said at the start of the video. Continued Franzese, “We’re also going to ask that you give.”\n\nSeyfried added that in honor of the date, the cast of Mean Girls was asking fans to contribute to the Thirst Project. The organization donates fresh water wells to developing countries to bring clean water to those that need it.\n\nAdded Lohan, “We all know Cady was from Africa, but this year we want to help building a well in Uganda.”\n\nBennett later explained that it only costs $8,000 to build a well for an entire village, while Seyfried added that each well will bring water to 500 people for the rest of their lives.\n\n“In honor of Oct. 3, we’re asking that you give just $3,” said Chabert before she instructed viewers to donate at my.thirstproject.org/meangirls.\n\nBennett concluded the video by reciting his famous line. “I guess there’s nothing left to say but, ‘Hey, guys — what day is it?'” he asked before his former castmates answered that it was Oct. 3.\n\nWatch the full clip below."
