        "text": "Lizzy Caplan was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2014 for her portrayal of Virginia Johnson on the TV show Masters of Sex. Elizabeth Caplan graduated from the Alexander Hamilton High School Academy of Music in Los Angeles in 2000. The year before, she had landed her first role on the TV show Freaks and Geeks, a critical and cult favorite. Recurring roles followed on Smallville and the vampire drama True Blood. She also appeared in films such as 2004’s Mean Girls and 2008’s Cloverfield, for which she won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2012, she premiered two films at the Sundance Film Festival, Save the Date and Bachelorette. Later that year she played the recurring character Julia on the TV show New Girl, and the following year began work on the critics’ favorite Masters of Sex, in which she plays one of the two central characters, who were noted sex researchers in the 1960s."
