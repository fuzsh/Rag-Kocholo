Otherwise, they wouldn’t have the chance to see such a talented and multifaceted actress grace their screens in so many different acting roles, from being an illusionist in Now You See Me 2 to being a V addict in HBO’s True Blood. Strong actors have a way of showing true versatility. They can be multiple different characters on screen and make it believable. Here is a list of Lizzy Caplan’s top 5 acting roles that strongly stand out.\n\n1 - Castle Rock Season 2\n\nCastle Rock Season 2 takes a different turn from the previous season. In this TV show, Lizzy Caplan has to get into the skin of Annie Wilkes, a mentally ill nurse who is stuck at Castle Rock. Caplan portrays what goes on with a woman isolated from the rest of the world.\n\n2 - Masters of Sex\n\nLizzy Caplan displays her versatility in Hollywood by playing the role of Virginia Johnson in Masters of Sex. Being a comedy star, Caplan’s transition into drama is impressive. Masters of Sex is a TV series off Thomas Maier’s book, Masters of Sex. This series tells the story of two researchers (William Masters and Virginia Johnson) curious to know more about human sexuality.\n\n3 - 127 Hours\n\n127 Hours is a tale of survival about an adventurous traveler whose arms are trapped in a boulder. In a story about a temerarious man, one would typically expect attention to not shift from the main guy. However, Lizzy Caplan catches the audience’s attention in this movie by playing the role of the traveler’s sister.\n\n4 - Mean Girls\n\nProbably one of the best teen comedies in the early 2000s, Mean Girls is widely applauded for perfectly mirroring the struggles of high school teenagers. Lizzy Caplan gave the main cast a run for their money by demanding the audience’s attention despite playing a supportive role. For sure, only talented actors can put up that kind of performance!\n\n5 - Cloverfield\n\nIn this thrilling movie, the story revolves around a group of New Yorkers. They have to go through the experience of horror and disaster after a gigantic monster hits the city. As a main character, Lizzy Caplan successfully interprets the role of Marlena Diamond. Cloverfield was so successful that the production team created sequels of the movie, including 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nUpcoming Lizzy Caplan Roles\n\nIn 2022, Lizzy Caplan joins Joshua Jackson and other actors in reimaging the Fatal Attraction Hollywood movie into a TV series. And that is not even all. Knowing the worth of Lizzy Caplan, the production crew of Fleishman Is in Trouble TV series has successfully wooed the stunning actress to join the cast. Want to see more?
