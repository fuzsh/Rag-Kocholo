        "text": "Fleishman Is in Trouble - an FX miniseries centred on a 40-something man navigating life after an acrimonious divorce - has been well received since its original release in November last year.\n\nAnd as Disney+ gears up to roll out the entire series on Wednesday 22 February, we have homed in on one of the show's stars, Lizzy Caplan, and traced back her filmography.\n\nWho Is Lizzy Caplan In Fleishman Is In Trouble?\n\nDr. Toby Fleishman is the aforementioned divorcee, played by Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). After throwing himself into dating apps for the first time, Toby begins to achieve romantic success that he failed to obtain in his youth.\n\nBut amid his turned-around luck, his ex-wife Rachel (Claire Danes - Stardust, Temple Grandin) disappears off the face of the earth, leaving him with their children. He is then left juggling fatherhood, a promotion and a long line of prospective sexual partners, all whilst trying to comprehend what happened to his ex-wife - and their marriage.\n\nThere to help him along the way are Libby (Lizzy) and Seth (Adam Brody - The O.C., Mr. & Mrs. Smith) - his best friends dating back to school. Lizzy also narrates the story.\n\n'It’s been the greatest joy of this show – the amount of people who have reached out to me,' Lizzy told The Guardian.\n\nMean Girls\n\nLizzy, 40, was just 22 when this high school cult classic was released, and her role as feisty outsider Janis Ian put her on the map.\n\nThe gothic sidekick managed to convince Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) to go against the 'Plastics' and conjured up a revenge plan against ultimate Mean Girl Regina George (Rachel McAdams).\n\nIn 2017, a Twitter thread suggesting Janis was the true 'Mean Girl' did the rounds, with Lizzy later describing her character as 'layered'.\n\nOf whether her breakthrough character was secretly a mean girl, the actress joked, 'Yeah, of course! But she was way craftier than the other mean girls. She was a mean girl with spy plans — with purpose.'\n\nAnd while she has never said no to a Mean Girls reboot, there is a requirement in place.\n\n'Listen, if everybody was on board, if the script was anywhere near as good as the original one was, then I don't see how I could say no to that. But I'm not really waiting by the phone,' she admitted.\n\nFreaks And Geeks\n\nLizzy landed her debut television role in another high school-led drama, Freaks and Geeks. The show - which ran for a year until 2000 - reflected the 'sad, hilarious unfairness of teen life'.\n\nLizzy played Sara, whose crush on Nick Andopolis (Jason Segal) formed much of her airtime, and she eventually started dating him in the final episode.\n\nThe series - despite its minimal success when it first aired - has often been listed as one of the greatest television shows of all time.\n\nBut it was a struggle for Lizzy to adapt to the newness of being on a TV show at the time.\n\n'I had zero fun on the Freaks and Geeks set,' Lizzy admitted in a 2021 interview. 'I didn't talk to anybody. They were really intimidating to me.'\n\nMasters Of Sex\n\nSet in the 50s through to the 60s, Lizzy's leading role in Masters of Sex earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nThe period drama - also nominated for a Golden Globe Award - explored the research and relationship between William Masters (Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (Lizzy) - two researchers of human sexuality.\n\nIt ran for three years and was cancelled in 2016 after the fourth season.\n\nLizzy was immediately drawn to her character, as she detailed back in 2014. 'I was so enamoured with this woman, and her story, and who she was, that I knew it would be such a privilege and an honour to get to play her.'\n\nJason Mraz's You And I Both Video\n\nIn 2003, ahead of her big break, Lizzy featured as Jason Mraz's love interest in his music video for You and I Both.\n\nIt was love at first sight for the musician when he went to the bank and set his sights on beautiful cashier (Lizzy). After several failed attempts at getting her to serve him - and a small and wrongful stint in jail - Jason got his happily ever and they drove away together.\n\nTo date, the video has been streamed over 15m times.\n\nIs Lizzy Caplan Married?\n\nYes. She tied the knot to British actor Tom Riley in 2017, after he proposed the year before. He is known for his roles in The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window, Da Vinci's Demons and The Nevers.\n\nThe couple first met in January 2015, when Lizzy was filming Now You See Me 2, and they welcomed a son Alfie in 2021."
