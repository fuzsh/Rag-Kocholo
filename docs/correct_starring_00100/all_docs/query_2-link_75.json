        "text": "The Story of the 50\n\nWhen Schmidtâs plans for his 29th birthday fall apart, Jess takes charge and enlists the help of her schoolâs party hungry vice-principal (guest star Rachael Harris). Meanwhile, Nick begrudgingly has his first date at Schmidtâs party with a beautiful lawyer (guest star Lizzy Caplan) who harbors a secret, and the gang wonders who placed a 50 dollar bill in the douchebag jar.\n\nJess and Julia\n\nNick panics when Julia (guest star Lizzy Caplan) doesnât want to put a label on their relationship. Meanwhile, Jess enlists Julia to help her get out of a traffic ticket, Winston reconnects with a former booty call (guest star Kali Hawk) and Schmidt is baffled as to why his shower towel is always damp.\n\nValentine's Day\n\nSingle for the first time on Valentineâs Day, Jess convinces Schmidt to be her wingman as she attempts to have an attachment-free fling with a handsome stranger (guest star Ryan Kwanten). Nickâs romantic plans are foiled when he finds himself spending more time with Juliaâs (guest star Lizzy Caplan) law firm assistant (guest star Clark Duke) than with her. Winston becomes one of the girls when Shelby (guest star Kali Hawk) invites him over on the holiday.\n\nBully\n\nWhen Jess tries to intervene with a classroom bully she finds herself the target of the bad seed student (guest star Joey King). Schmidt, meanwhile, is thrilled over his post-Valentineâs sexcapades, but hates that his paramour wants to keep it a secret; and Nick goes into a tailspin when Julia (guest star Lizzy Caplan) sends him a cactus.\n\nBurning House of Love\n\nSookie's painful childhood revelation about her Uncle Bartlett spurs Bill into action. Despite her skepticism, Tara agrees to pay for an exorcism to purge a demon out of Lettie Mae. In search of V juice, Jason travels to Fangtasia, where he bonds with an adventurous young woman named Amy. A trio of rednecks decide to exact vigilante justice on a pack of vampires who crashed Merlotte's in search of their wayward mate, Bill."
