        "text": "By Tatayana Yomary\n\nDec. 12 2023, Updated 4:48 p.m. ET\n\nThe Gist:\n\nThe original \"mean girls\" made their first television debut in 2004 with the film Mean Girls.\n\nMuch of the cast went on to become Hollywood A-listers.\n\nMean Girls got renewed interest after it was announced a follow-up movie, also titled Mean Girls, would release in January 2024, and star Tina Fey.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nYou can’t sit with us! On April 30, 2004, pop culture received a facelift thanks to the hit movie, Mean Girls. The movie, which stars Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, documents a homeschooled teenager who makes the switch to public school and unintentionally joins the mean girl clique known as “The Plastics.” Cady falls for the “Queen Bee” Regina George’s (Rachel McAdams) boyfriend and learns the ins and outs of the girl world — from catty fights to juggling different friend groups.\n\nAlthough it’s been nearly 20 years since the release of Mean Girls, most millennials still consider the film to be one of the best comedies ever made. And since Mean Girls features a number of cast members who have gone on to become Hollywood A-listers, fans are wondering what the crew is up to these days. Keep reading to get the 4-1-1 on where the Mean Girls cast is now!\n\n1. Lindsay Lohan (Cady Heron)\n\nLindsay may have gained notoriety as a child star, but the 37-year-old has since become a respected actress. After Mean Girls, she appeared in a slew of movies and TV series including 2007's Georgia Rule, 2008's Ugly Betty, and 2014's 2 Broke Girls.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAt a point, Lindsay's life was impacted by substance abuse issues. However, Lindsay went on to appear in two other projects — Falling For Christmas and Cursed — both of which released in 2022. Not to mention, she also jumped the broom with financier Bader Shammas and welcomed her first child, a son named Luai Shammas, in July 2023.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2. Rachel McAdams (Regina George)\n\nRachel established herself as the \"Queen Bee\" who instilled fear and envy in the hearts of many, but the now-45-year-old is considered a treasure in the entertainment world. Rachel went on to star in the 2004 Nicholas Sparks-inspired film The Notebook and won over hearts across the country. She also stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Christine Palmer in Doctor Strange films. These days, Rachel is busy balancing the roles of motherhood with two sons and her acting career.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n3. Amanda Seyfried (Karen Smith)\n\nAfter Amanda Seyfried portrayed our favorite ditzy yet gorgeous teenager, the actress went on to star in 2010's Dear John, a film inspired by Nicholas Sparks's bestselling novel of the same name. Amanda also sprinkled her magic in TV series and movies such as 2012's Les Miserables, 2017's Twin Peaks, and 2020's You Should Have Left.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAdditionally, Amanda secretly married Thomas Sadoski in March 2017. The pair shares a daughter and son, Thomas and Nina, who were born in March 2017 and September 2020.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n4. Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners)\n\nLacey Chabert's hair was so big that it was full of secrets — well not these days. Like the rest of The Plastics, Lacey has gone on to lead a successful entertainment career. The 41-year-old has had multiple acting roles in movies and TV shows including 2009's Ghost of Girlfriend's Past, 2013's Slightly Single in L.A., and various Hallmark movies. Lacey married David Nehdar in December 2013 and had a daughter named Julia in September 2016.\n\nUnfortunately, she could never make \"fetch\" happen.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n5. Jonathan Bennett (Aaron Samuels)\n\nPretty boy Jonathan Bennett has also become quite the catch in Hollywood. The 42-year-old has moved on to other notable movies and TV series including 2005's Cheaper by the Dozen, 2012's Divorce Invitation, and 2016's Hit the Floor. Jonathan also made an appearance in Ariana Grande's 2019 music video \"Thank U, Next\" which pays homage to Mean Girls. Jonathan is currently married to his longtime partner, Jaymes Vaughn.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n6. Lizzy Caplan (Janis Ian)\n\nLizzy Caplan was a fan-favorite in Mean Girls for her no-nonsense personality and her hilarious way of always mispronouncing Cady's name. After Mean Girls, Lizzy has become quite the TV series talent throughout her career, and even received several award nominations for her role in the Showtime series, Masters of Sex. Lizzy is also now married like the rest of her MG co-stars, having tied the knot with Tom Riley in September 2017. The two also share a son named Alfie.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n7. Daniel Franzese (Damian)\n\nDamian may have been too gay to function, but fans forever live for his character in Mean Girls. After his monumental role in the fukn, Daniel starred in various movies and TV shows such as 2005's War of the Worlds, 2009's Kill Theory, and 2016's Recovery Road. Daniel also finished the project, Hypnotized, which has yet to be released.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n8. Tina Fey (Ms. Norbury)\n\n\"I'm a pusher, Cady!\" That line continues to live rent free in our heads when we need to step it up and live up to our true potential. Though she had previously found success as a comedian on Saturday Night Live, she found further acclaim writing for and starring in Mean Girls. These days, she's best known for creating series like 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Mr. Mayor, and plenty more.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOne of Tina's more recent projects include Only Murders in the Building, playing the role of Cinda Canning. And if you didn't get enough of the mean girls in the iconic 2004 film, you'll be happy to hear Tina is reviving the film with another Mean Girls, which debuts in 2024. Tina is writing the screenplay for the movie (and starring in it), and will also be working alongside Lorne Michaels, who is producing it.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n9. Tim Meadows (Mr.Duvall)\n\nTim Meadows may have nabbed a supporting actor role in Mean Girls, but it's one fans of the show will never forget. After MG, the SNL alum has flexed his acting skills in 2010 and 2013's Grown Ups and Grown Ups 2, Trainwreck in 2015, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and other roles. Tim also appeared in the TV series, Poker Face Season 1, which debuted in January 2023. The show has also been confirmed for a second season, which has been delayed until 2024.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDwayne Hill (Coach Carr)\n\n\"Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die!\" While Coach Carr, played by Dwayne Hill, may have held a smaller role in the teen drama film, it's definitely one you won't forget! Some of the projects Dwayne worked on following Mean Girls include voicing a character for Atomic Betty: The No-L Nine (2005-2006) and Total Drama (2007). The former \"high school coach\" also served as the voice for characters in Z-Baw: Mejores Amigos (2012).\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n10. Amy Poehler (June George)\n\nLast but certainly not least, we have Amy Poehler. As yet another former SNL star, the hilarious actress stole our hearts as Regina's \"cool mom\" in Mean Girls. Over the years, we've watched Amy impress audiences with other popular roles. These days, she is perhaps best known for portraying Leslie Knope in Parks and Recreations.\n\nMean Girls is currently available to stream on Paramount+."
