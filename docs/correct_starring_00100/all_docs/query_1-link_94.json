If you are one of these individuals, please watch Mean Girls (the 2004 film) before you watch Mean Girls (the 2024 musical film), I beg of you.\n\nFirst, how folks didn’t know this was a musical before going to watch is beyond me. This film has been advertised for ages as the film version of the musical. Additionally Rene Rapp, beautiful songstress that she is, who portrayed the infamous Regina George on Broadway, plays Regina George on the film. This, for me, was the giveaway."
