        "text": "Everyone, Lizzy Caplan included, can agree. As a society, we do not necessarily need a Mean Girls sequel, but that doesn't mean that everyone—Lizzy Caplan still included—wouldn't gobble up a Mean Girls sequel in a friggin' heartbeat. Lindsay Lohan, still riding that career comeback high, has said on multiple occasions that she'd be thrilled to bring back Cady Heron if she could. Now Caplan, who played Janis “You Are a Mean Girl” Ian in the film, has said she'd of course say yes to a reboot if one should come her way.\n\n“Of course I would want to be a part of it,” she told Grazia magazine. “I would be an idiot not to join.” That said, Mean Girls was the teen movie that arguably did end all teen movies. As much as audiences would love it, Caplan doesn't think Mean Girls is really desperate for an epilogue. “But to me it feels like Mean Girls had a really good beginning, middle, and end,” she added. “I don’t know what’s left of the story.” What if the hype is better than the real thing? Now that would be a tragedy.\n\nLuckily, Lacey Chabert, who played princess of frozen breakfast pastries Gretchen Wieners, already has some ideas. “I think it would be so much fun to see where these women are now, and if their kids are the new mean girls,” she told Jimmy Fallon. “I would love to know what they’re doing.”\n\nPersonally, I think it would be worth it just to see Lohan back in her defining element, which Caplan clearly supports. “I am so on board with this return of Lindsay Lohan. I’m just pumped,” she told Grazia. “She was such an incredible talent when she was working as a kid and a young adult, so I’m happy to see that she’s coming back.”"
