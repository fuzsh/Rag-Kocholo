The iconic teen comedy Mean Girls has become a staple in modern pop culture, and its appreciation has been once again revived with the 2024 musical version of the film. And despite the movie’s new version earning $28 million in its first three days in theaters, according to Billboard, Mean Girls’ original star remains the winner of the social media popularity contest.\n\nThat’s right, Lindsay Lohan, who famously played the 2004 Mean Girls protagonist, Cady Heron, has been named the most influential star of all the Mean Girls movie’s cast, earning a jaw-dropping amount of money, according to a new Instagram study.\n\nSocial poker site Replay Poker analyzed the Instagram accounts of cast members starring in the original 2004 Mean Girls and 2024’s new musical adaptation to reveal the stars with the highest maximum earnings per sponsored post on the platform.\n\nCast members such as Rachel McAdams, who played the original idolized antagonist Regina George in the 2004 Mean Girls, Tina Fey, Lizzy Caplan, and Jon Hamm are not currently active on Instagram and, therefore, did not feature in the study.\n\nLindsay Lohan, who famously played Mean Girls’ protagonist, Cady Heron, has been named the most influential star of all the Mean Girls movie’s cast\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: lindsaylohan\n\nBut Lindsay, the original Mean Girls lead, came up as the most prominent actor in the entire franchise, ranking higher than every other cast member.\n\nSince gaining immense popularity in the early 2000s for her roles in various films, including Mean Girls, the 37-year-old actress has accumulated over 14.2 million followers on Instagram.\n\nAnd thanks to her legion of fans on the platform, she can earn up to £46,700 ($58,769.4) for one sponsored post on Instagram, almost double the amount of any other Mean Girls star, Replay Poker noted in their study.\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Mean Girls’ original Karen Smith, was named the second most influential cast member.
