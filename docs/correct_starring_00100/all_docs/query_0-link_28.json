        "text": "Janis Ian is one of the most iconic characters of all time thanks to her unforgettable one liners and gothic look- so you'll be surprised to know Lizzy Caplan been in some of your favourite shows, she just looks completely different!\n\nMean Girls wouldn't be the iconic film it is without Janis Ian front and centre calling everyone out on their BS in her hilariously badass attitude and the actress, Lizzy Caplan, will certainly be known for the role forevermore.\n\nHowever, Lizzy, 38, has been a working actress ever since the 2006 comedy and been in some enormous shows and films including New Girl, Cloverfield and Hot Tub Time Machine to name a few.\n\nShe also looks nothing like Janis Ian, in what may be slightly less surprising news.\n\nIs Mean Girls On Netflix UK?\n\nMean Girls stopped Lizzy Caplan landing roles for a while\n\nAfter the film that put her on the map came out, Lizzy revealed to The Independent:\n\n\"I remember after Mean Girls I didn’t work again for a long time.\"\n\n\"After Mean Girls, I didn’t work again until I dyed my hair blonde and got a spray tan.\"\n\n\"If they made Mean Girls now, I think that character would not be so pushed aside for future roles.\"\n\n\"There’d be more opportunities for somebody playing the weird goth girl in a movie than there was back then.\"\n\nUh, yeah?! It's one of the most memorable and hilarious roles of all time.\n\nNow You See Me 2\n\nPeople love to point out characters from other films popping up elsewhere and pretty much everyone was surprised to see Janis, AKA Lizzy, oozing with glamour in 2016 heist thriller, Now You See Me 2.\n\nStarring alongside acting legends Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg and Mark Ruffalo, Lizzy plays a witty, multi-talented thief and the director, Jon Chu, said he wrote the role for Lizzy before even knowing she was available, being a huge fan after seeing Mean Girls.\n\nThe power that film has!\n\nNew Girl\n\nLizzy took on the role of Julia Cleary, Nick's girlfriend and no nonsense lawyer and for many it was the the first time they were seeing Lizzy un-Janis'ed (that can be a word, right?)\n\nIf you're wanting to catch her episodes they're in the very first series, so, no spoiler or anything but things don't work out between her and Nick!\n\nApocalyptic Cloverfield came out just two years after Mean Girls, in 2008, which couldn't be further from the comedy but Lizzy couldn't resist returning to the genre, starring in Hot Tub Time Machine in 2010.\n\nAll in all, she continues to have a successful acting career in a wide range of genres- but no one, not even here, is denying Janis will likely remain her most recognisable and career-defining role ever.\n\nBecause duh, it was iconic!"
