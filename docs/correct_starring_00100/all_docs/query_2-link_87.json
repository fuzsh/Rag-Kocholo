        "text": "In a perfect world Mean Girls Day (October 3) would always fall on a Wednesday, because that’s when we wear pink. But, alas, that is simply not the way the calendar works. We celebrate the film on this date because of the infamous line in which our protagonist Cady Heron says, “On October 3 he asked me what day it was.” The “he” refers to Cady’s crush, Aaron Samuels, and she replies with the obvious, “It’s October 3.”\n\nFrom the moment it premiered in 2004, Mean Girls left an indelible mark on pop culture. If you’ve ever stepped foot in a high school, you know how much the movie just gets everything from the social politics, the stereotypes, and the agony of navigating it all. Mean Girls is a timeless look of navigating these tumultuous high school/teenage years.\n\nMany of Mean Girls’ stars were relatively fresh faces to the big screen 18 years ago. But where are the Plastics and the people they tormented now? Here’s a look at how the cast has fared over the years.\n\nWhere is Lindsay Lohan Since Playing Cady Heron in Mean Girls?\n\nMean Girls was essentially a star vehicle for Lindsay Lohan, who had already been working in the entertainment biz since the age of 3. The movie catapulted the young actress’ success even further, which turned out to be both a good thing and a bad thing. Lohan continued to work, starring in movies like A Prairie Home Companion, Just My Luck and Machete, but her personal life garnered more attention than her roles. Next up for the New York native is the film Irish Wish opposite Jane Seymour. The film is part of Lohan’s two-picture creative partnership with Netflix. She’s currently living in Dubai with new husband Bader Shammas, and we would not-so-secretly love to see her join the cast of Real Housewives of Dubai.\n\nWhere is Rachel McAdams Since Playing Regina George in Mean Girls?\n\nAs the wicked leader of The Plastics, Regina George could cut anyone down in an instant. Rachel McAdams nailed the role perfectly, which caught the attention of studio execs far and wide. The actress has gone on to enjoy a successful career in film, notably starring in The Notebook, The Time Traveler’s Wife and Spotlight. But perhaps the project we’re most excited about for McAdams is coming up next year in the film adaptation of Judy Blume’s Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret.\n\nWhere is Jonathan Bennett Since Playing Aaron Samuels in Mean Girls?\n\nIt’s no surprise that new girl Cady immediately fell for popular guy Aaron Samuels. Jonathan Bennett, whose previous credits included bit parts on All My Children and Boston Public, was a gem as the hot guy with a good heart. After Mean Girls the actor worked consistently, but it was when he appeared as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars in 2014 that Hollywood really renewed its interest in him. Now Bennett can be seen hosting a slew of Food Network competition shows and inked a deal with Hallmark Channel, among other projects. He married his longtime partner James Vaughan in 2022.\n\nWhere is Amanda Seyfried Since Playing Karen Smith in Mean Girls?\n\nAmanda Seyfried was a soap opera darling before tackling her Mean Girls' role of ditzy Karen, who could predict the weather with her “ESPN.” She appeared on both All My Children and As the World Turns. While her character is best known for her dim-witted comments, Seyfried is smart as a whip, choosing incredible projects that opened up to her after the film. You might remember her as Sarah Henrickson on Big Love and Sophie in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Recently Seyfried took home the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie this year for her portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout.\n\nWhere is Lacey Chabert Since Playing Gretchen Wieners in Mean Girls?\n\nAside from Lohan, Lacey Chabert was the most well-known Mean Girls cast member when it premiered. The actress already had a slew of credits to her name, including Claudia Salinger in the hit 90s series Party of Five. Now if you want to keep up with Chabert, just look at Hallmark Channel. She’s regularly premiering a new feel-good movie for the network and we’re totally here for it.\n\nWhere is Lizzy Caplan Since Playing Janice Ian in Mean Girls?\n\nWhether the character is popular or not, Lizzy Caplan always plays a strong woman. In some capacity, everyone could all relate to her loner Janice Ian in Mean Girls. Since 2004 Caplan has been busy with many memorable TV roles (like New Girl, Party Down and Truth Be Told). But her big moment came with the portrayal of Virginia Johnson in Masters of Sex, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Up next for Caplan is a retelling of the classic 80s movie Fatal Attraction.\n\nWhere is Daniel Franzese Since Playing Damian in Mean Girls?\n\nAs a confidante to both Cady and Janice, Damian was that ride-or-die friend everyone needs in and out of high school. Actor Daniel Franzese has done a ton of television work since Mean Girls, including series regular roles in Conviction, Looking and Recovery Road. More recently he appeared as a contestant on RuPaul’s Secret Celebrity Drag Race performing as Donna Bellissima.\n\nCelebrate Mean Girls Day by saying \"Mean Girls\" into your voice remote!\n\nMore Must Watch Shows and Movies to Check Out . . .\n\nAre You Ready for Some Football?
