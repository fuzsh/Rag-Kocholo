        "text": "Today is Mean Girls day - the day when the hottest boy in school asks Cady what day it is:\n\n\"On October 3rd he asked me what day it was.\"\n\n\"It's October 3rd!\"\n\nMean Girls is a film that defined a generation – a kind of 21st century Clueless, only more quotable.\n\nAnd it brought a lot of shiny young stars to our attention. But who's made the most out of their time at North Shore High? Whose careers have sunk slowly but surely without trace?\n\nAnd where is Lindsay Lohan now?\n\n9. Rajiv Surendra (Kevin G)\n\nOk, so Surendra hasn't really done any acting since his all-singing, all-mathsing (totally a word) turn in Mean Girls, unless you count this short film 6ft in 7 Min. But he IS completely buff now.\n\n8. Lindsay Lohan (Cady Heron)\n\nPoor Lindsay Lohan. We really wanted to put her higher up on this list for old times' sake. But we are bound to tell the truth, and the truth is that things haven't been looking great for LiLo.\n\nHer potential was no more obvious than in Mean Girls itself, but it sadly turned out to be a career peak. In recent years she's mainly been reduced to guest roles in TV shows (2 Broke Girls, Eastbound & Down) and appearing as herself (Anger Management, Scary Movie 5).\n\nShe recently lost a court case against the makers of GTA who she said caricatured her in the game.\n\nAnd her next project is The Shadow Within – a story about a private investigator from a family of werewolves. Could this be the big break she's looking for? Sources say 'no'.\n\n7. Jonathan Bennett (Aaron Samuels)\n\nMean Girls' love interest has been fairly busy since 2004... starring in films you've never heard of. Mining for Ruby, A Christmas Kiss II, Cats Dancing on Jupiter, A Dogwalker's Christmas Tale... we could go on.\n\nHe did have a minor recurring role in Awkward. too, so there is that...\n\n6. Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners)\n\nThe one-time Party of Five actress may not have had much in the way of high-profile acting gigs since she failed to make 'fetch' happen, but she might have the best geek cred out of all her fellow Plastics.\n\nShe has continued to be a successful voice actor, having played Meg Griffin in the first season of Family Guy before giving it up to *some* actress called Mila Kunis. Chabert is DC's go-to for the voice of the Justice League's Zatanna, a recurring contributor to Transformers: Rescue Bots and has shown up every now and then on Robot Chicken. Not too shabby.\n\n5. David Reale (Glenn Coco)\n\nThe surprisingly handsome extra whose face you probably never even saw has done pretty well for himself, considering he had no lines, snuck onto the set and was never officially hired at all.\n\nReale showed up in the US versions of both Queer as Folk and Skins, as well as a recent recurring role in Suits as IT specialist Benjamin. And who doesn't love Suits?\n\n4. Daniel Franzese (Damian Leigh)\n\nTo be honest, Franzese didn't go stratospheric after Mean Girls, but he recently proved that he was far from 'too gay to function' by landing a key role in the second season of Looking and its recent movie spinoff/finale.\n\nWe'll next see him alongside Agent Carter herself in the Hayley Atwell-starring TV legal drama Conviction. Things are looking sunny for our Daniel.\n\n3. Amanda Seyfried (Karen Smith)\n\nMaking the most of her amazing ability to tell when it's raining, Amanda Seyfried has appeared in some major blockbusters including Les Misérables, and Mamma Mia! – not to mention the underrated horror comedy Jennifer's Body.\n\nThings have been quieter for her lately, but she recently reunited with her Les Mis co-star Russell Crowe for Fathers & Daughters and, most importantly, the new season of Twin Peaks. That's a damn fine post-Mean Girls career.\n\n2. Lizzy Caplan (Janis Ian)\n\nThe dark horse of the cast, Lizzy Caplan has had one of the most interesting careers since 2004. She's turned up all over the place in projects ranging from Cloverfield and True Blood to Hot Tub Time Machine and 127 Hours.\n\nYou might have spotted her in the One-Shot short Marvel film attached to its Avengers Blu-ray, and she recently joined the cast of the surprisingly enjoyable Now You See Me 2.\n\nCouple all of that with her work on the acclaimed Masters of Sex (which scored her an Emmy nomination and is back for a fourth season any day now), and you've got the makings of a star still on the rise.\n\n1. Rachel McAdams (Regina George)\n\nWe all saw this coming. You can't do such a good job of playing queen bee Regina George without having a certain... let's just call it a 'quality'.\n\nThat quality has done well for Rachel McAdams. Audiences of all types really identify with her, and she manages to bring likability to films like The Notebook and The Time Traveler's Wife which *could* be considered mediocre otherwise.\n\nBut, she's not just made of romantic dramas. She's been part of the Woody Allen renaissance with her part in Midnight in Paris, and she was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the Oscar-winning drama Spotlight.\n\nShe's also achieved the ultimate success an actor can aspire too – she'll be starring in Marvel's next movie Doctor Strange (although we still don't know her character's name). McAdams is a bonafide, bankable Hollywood star."
