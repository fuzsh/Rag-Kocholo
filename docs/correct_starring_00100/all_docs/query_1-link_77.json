        "text": "Spawning a stage show, endless parodies, and a more recent movie musical, Mean Girls is truly a timeless coming-of-age classic.\n\nThe film has become what many of the stars are best known for, including Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and writer Tina Fey.\n\nTimeless does not mean it is ageless though, as the 2004 hit movie shockingly celebrates its 20th anniversary on April 30.\n\nMean Girls has been a staple of cinema since its release, following the life of Cady Heron as she navigates the shift from being homeschooled in Africa to an American high school.\n\nCady inadvertently climbs the social hierarchy and topples queen bee, Regina George, shattering the school’s delicate pecking order in the process.\n\nTwo decades on, the film has ascended into the ranks of truly iconic as scenes are still quoted year-on-year.\n\nJingle Bell Rock and ‘You go, Glen Coco’ rear up around Christmas while social media is rendered unusable for gifs and think-pieces on October 3.\n\nThe dedication to this film was evident in the huge backlash to even suggesting it could be rebooted – with Renee Rapp’s turn as Regina ruffling a few millennial feathers.\n\nWhile 2024’s movie musical wasn’t the absolute travesty fans feared, it hasn’t held a candle to the dizzying heights of the so very ‘fetch’ original.\n\nFrom high-profile scandals to career transformations, we take a look at what the OG Mean Girls cast has been up to in the last two decades.\n\nWhere are the Mean Girls cast now?\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nThe Parent Trap and Freaky Friday star Lindsay Lohan, 37, was already a well-known face in the world of film before she took on the role of Cady Heron.\n\nHer Mean Girls appearances cemented her status as a teen icon and led to roles in Herbie: Fully Loaded and Just My Luck before she launched her music career, releasing two albums.\n\nDespite her career being dogged by multiple arrests and a rehab stint, 2022 saw Lohan’s return to acting and 2023 saw her welcome her first child with husband Bader Shammas.\n\nShe returned to screen in a cameo in the movie musical but was said to be disappointed with an insult used in the film which had been aimed at her in her youth.\n\nThe ‘fire crotch’ comment has since been edited out but a source had told Metro.co.uk she was ‘very hurt’ over the use.\n\nLindsay went on to star in Irish Wish, a romantic comedy which aired on Netflix but was hit with backlash for a ‘painful’ lack of actual Irish actors.\n\nJonathan Bennett\n\nJonathan Bennett, 42, won the hearts of many as both Cady and Regina’s love interest Aaron Samuels – and who can blame them with that smile.\n\nHe went on to appear in Cheaper by the Dozen 2 before securing a role in teen drama Veronica Mars as Casey Gant.\n\nJonathan also made his way into the world of TV as the host of Cake Wars and Halloween Wars on the Food Network.\n\nNot content with life on the silver screen, the actor also made his Broadway debut in Spamalot in January 2024, alongside Ariana Grande’s boyfriend Ethan Slater.\n\nRachel McAdams\n\nOne of the most quotable characters in film history, Rachel McAdams, 45, owned every part of her appearance as Regina George.\n\nIn the same year as Mean Girls, she starred in the smash hit blockbuster The Notebook before the Bafta Award-winning actor nabbed roles in the likes of About Time, The Vow, The Time Traveller’s Wife, and Doctor Strange.\n\nMost recently, she appeared in the 2023 film Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret alongside Kathy Bates, Benny Safdie, and Abby Ryder Fortson.\n\nShe did return to Mean Girls, after skipping the reunion advert, as she made a quick cameo to introduce new Regina, Renee, as the musical act in an episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nTina Fey\n\nComedian Tina Fey, 53, reprised her role as Ms Norbury in the Mean Girls musical film, having helped write each version of the story.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live writer helped pen the original film and went on to receive critical acclaim for her appearances in 30 Rock and the Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\n\nShe has most recently created the TV series Mr Mayor, starring Ted Danson and Holly Hunter.\n\nTim Meadows\n\nTim Meadows, 62, also returned to the musical Mean Girls as he reprised his original role as Mr DuVall.\n\nHe and Tina continued the romance sparked in the original film by confirming the teaching pair were an item in the musical – although it’s not really a sequel.\n\nThe stand-up comedian was one of the longest-running cast members on the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, where he appeared for 10 seasons from 1991 to 2000.\n\nPost-Mean Girls, he appeared in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Semi-Pro, Grown Ups 2, and most recently Nicolas Cage-starring Dream Scenario.\n\nAmy Poehler\n\nBefore becoming an iconic character in Parks and Recreation, Amy Poehler, 52, was a cool mom to Regina in Mean Girls.\n\nAnother well-known face on Saturday Night Live, Poehler previously co-hosted the show’s news parody segment, Weekend Update.\n\nShe and Tina are life-long friends and a formidable comedy duo so it’s no surprise they have continued to appear together in award show hosting duties and other projects.\n\nThe Golden Globe-winning star is also known for her appearances in Baby Mama, Sisters, and Wine Country.\n\nIn 2015, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to television.\n\nLacey Chabert\n\nLacey Chabert, 41, made up 1/4 of The Plastics as Gretchen Wieners after previously being recognisable as the voice of Eliza Thornberry in the hit animated show The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nEagle-eyed fans might also spot her as Jenny in Daddy Day Care and the iconic parody film Not Another Teen Movie, starring Chris Evans, before her Mean Girls break.\n\nThe actor, who also provided the voice of Meg Griffin in Family Guy’s first season, went on to land roles in 2006 horror remake Black Christmas and animated festive flick All I Want For Christmas is You.\n\nShe has appeared in more than 30 Hallmark films, with the most recent being the 2023 release Haul out the Holly: Lit Up.\n\nAmanda Seyfried\n\nAmanda Seyfried, 38, completed The Plastics as the ditzy yet downright hilarious Karen Smith.\n\nShe joined Bennett in Veronica Mars in the role of Lily Kane, while also going on to appear in hit films Jennifer’s Body, Ted 2, and Les Miserables.\n\nThe Dear John star is arguably best known for her work in the Mamma Mia! franchise as Sophie, as well as Golden Globe and Emmy-winning series The Dropout.\n\nShe floods her social media with cute animal pictures, including her dogs and horses, as well as chic selfies as she lives her best life.\n\nDaniel Franzese\n\nDamian is the best friend we all wanted in school, and in Mean Girls, the viper-tongued high schooler was played by Daniel Franzese, 45.\n\nAfter shooting to fame due to the teen comedy, he released several live comedy shows and starred in films such as the 2010 remake\n\nHis portrayal of HIV-positive Eddie in the second series of HBO show Looking has led to him becoming a well-known AIDS activist in the US.\n\nDaniel is often involved in meet and greets with fans, frequenting comic and drag conventions across the globe.\n\nLizzy Caplan\n\nAfter becoming a well-known face on Freaks and Geeks, Lizzy Caplan, 41, turned her attention to film and starred as Janice Ian in Mean Girls.\n\nHer work is incredibly prolific with comedy roles in Hot Tub Time Machine and New Girl contrasting her work on dramas like 127 Hours.\n\nShe went on to gain further acclaim in Cloverfield, The Interview, and Allied, as well as TV shows such as Related, The Class, Party Down, and the TV adaptation of Fatal Attraction which aired in 2023.\n\nArguably her biggest role came in 2013 when she starred in Showtime series Masters Of Sex as Virginia Johnson, which saw her nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nLizzy also met her husband, Tom Riley, while she filmed Now You See Me 2 in London and the pair share a son, born in 2021.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Messy Met Gala?
