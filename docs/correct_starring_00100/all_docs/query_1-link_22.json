        "text": "About five minutes into Mean Girls, Damian (played by Daniel Franzese) asks Cady (Lindsay Lohan), a girl he’s never met, a question: “Is that your natural hair color? It’s gorgeous.” He then leans over, takes a chunk of Cady’s hair in his hand, and holds it to his own. “See! This is the color I want,” he gestures to his best friend, Janis (Lizzy Caplan). As Cady reels from this clear invasion of her personal bubble, Janis takes the opportunity to introduce her over-comfortable companion. “This is Damian,” she tells Cady. “He’s almost too gay to function.”\n\nIn 2004, when Mean Girls was released, characters like Damian — also known as the Gay Best Friend trope — were few and far between. When they did make their way to screens, they were often played as broad stereotypes meant to provoke laughs with their stereotypical sass. While Damian was definitely one of Mean Girls’ most reliable quote machines (I’d credit his character with the majority of the film’s most-recognizable lines), he was a noticeable improvement on the stereotype. In fact, after Janis’ introductory joke, Damian’s sexuality is rarely brought up again. As Franzese recalls now, “Damian was able to just survive and thrive as whoever he was authentically.”\n\nOn April 30, Mean Girls turns 15. Ahead of a stand up performance celebrating the anniversary at Comic Strip Live in New York City, them. spoke with Franzese about the role that catapulted him to fame. The actor has launched a successful stand-up career in the years since while taking on other memorable roles, like Eddie, the HIV+ bear he played on HBO’s Looking. But as he admits during our conversation, portraying a character like Damian was something of a double-edged sword, too.\n\nWhat was the early casting process for Mean Girls?\n\nThe casting director that put me in Party Monster called me in for Damian; the script said that he was “probably fat and definitely gay,” which I thought was hysterical. I read for her and that was all I heard about it. That was in Spring. In Fall, they were still looking for the character, so she was like, “I’m going to have you read for Tina Fey and Mark Waters.” They liked my audition, but everyone thought I was too old. I was 26 and I was playing 16. But Rachel McAdams was 28!\n\nEventually, they flew me out to LA for a table read — but I still didn’t have the part! The table read was like my final audition. I did so well during the table read that I made Lorne Michaels do a spit-take, while the guy who was originally playing Aaron Samuels got fired. He was sitting next to me. He was an actor that everyone would know and he just got fired on the spot.\n\nSo there was another Aaron Samuels originally?\n\nYeah. He was like 16. They asked him to shave and take his hat off and sit up straight, but he kept playing it cool — just slouching and half-assing it. And I was next to him going full-force trying to get that part. Nobody was going to stop me.\n\nHow do you think Damian fit into the lineage of the “gay best friend” trope in film?\n\nI think Damian was the first gay role I saw where the character was just comfortable being himself and there wasn’t too much focus on his being gay. He was able to just survive and thrive as whoever he was authentically. I remember Tina and Mark saying that Damian probably hadn’t even had his first kiss yet. You knew he was gay. You knew that Janis knew. But other than that, it was kind of like, “[My sexuality] is something I’m going to check out after school.” I hadn’t really seen that perspective before.\n\nDo you have a favorite line from the movie?\n\nI really like “I want my pink shirt back,” because it’s the one line I got to improvise.\n\n“Oh my god, Danny DeVito, I love your work” is mine — especially since, in recent years, he’s become such a stan-worthy icon thanks to his Twitter presence.\n\nI actually got to meet him last year! I went up to him and said, “Dude, I’m the guy that says, ‘Danny Devito, I love your work’ in Mean Girls” and he gave me a fist-bump.\n\nI want to talk about your performance of “Beautiful” at the North Shore Talent Show.\n\nFunny story: Linda Perry, who wrote the song, wasn’t going to release it for the movie. But they told her that my character was gay and that’s why she let me sing it in the movie. They gave me a whole list of songs at first and said, “If we can’t get ‘Beautiful,’ these are the alternatives.” I remember I was going to sing the Whitney Houston song “One Moment In Time” instead. But then, because my character was gay, Linda Perry allowed me to sing “Beautiful.”\n\nYou didn’t come out publicly until years after the film came out. How was it to play such a visibly queer character at a time when you were in the closet yourself?\n\nIt was actually pretty nerve-wracking. I was randomly dating somebody in Toronto before we even started filming there. He wanted to visit the set, but I always got nervous and I’d introduce him as my friend. It was just weird and it actually ruined our relationship and we stopped dating. But Jonathan Bennett [Aaron Samuels] and I came out to each other. We were secretly going out to clubs together. We were acting a certain way in front of people involved in the movie and trying to live a double life. But I don’t think it would have affected the role at all if I was out or not because I think Tina probably thought I was gay when she first hired me anyway.\n\nI wasn’t proven wrong. As soon as the movie was over, I kept meeting the gay glass ceiling. They wouldn’t let me audition for straight roles. I wasn’t getting called for things I was normally auditioning for. I had been getting called for The Sopranos, and it seemed like I was circling getting on the show at some point, because I’m Italian and from New York. But after Mean Girls, The Sopranos auditions dried up. I had become famous for playing one thing, but Hollywood, a very What-Have-You-Done-For-Me-Lately town, just didn’t think my talent could go beyond that.\n\nDid it feel weird to go after this role knowing there could be negative repercussions for your career?\n\nI felt that way a little bit, but it was so funny and well written that it didn’t matter. Damian wasn’t made fun of; he was celebrated. I prayed about it a bit and if I was going to do a gay role, it was going to be this one. But then, immediately after, I was offered all these other gay parts that were all so stereotypical — just making fun of gays. I was like, “You know what? I can’t.”\n\nI stayed unemployed for many years after Mean Girls because I refused to go backwards on the movement. I turned down a lot of money as my fame was rising. And to be famous and not have money? It’s a very weird thing to be famous and not be able to pay your rent. But I felt that there was a progression in gaysploitation in cinema. I felt myself pushing the envelope, so if I just held out, something worthy would come along.\n\nYou eventually got the role of Eddie in HBO’s Looking, which I think is the perfect representation of what you said you were holding out for.\n\nYes. It was difficult though, because I waited ten years for something like that — a role that was that important. That role was so freeing for me because I had come out of the closet and I was offered it without even having to audition. It just felt so serendipitous — it felt like something I was supposed to be doing, to be on a set where it’s not only okay to be gay but it was cool to be gay. It was nice to commit to that for a project on HBO and play a character that was HIV+ and loved not in spite of it but because of it.\n\nEddie also provided some much-needed bear representation on TV.\n\nEven within our own LGBTQ+ community, there’s a lack of people of size shown in pop culture. It was nice to play a sexualized bigger male. I hadn’t really seen that before that much, if at all.\n\nI’ve dated guys that have fetishized bigger men and I’ve heard from multiple of them that one of the reasons they were attracted to us is because of seeing James Gandolfini with his shirt off in The Sopranos. It sounds funny, but if you’re not seeing that on TV, how do you know what’s attractive? A lot of times, in commercials or on sitcoms, the guy of size is used as the butt of a joke for being big. But when we show him sexually — James Gandolfini sleeping with his Russian girlfriend on The Sopranos or Eddie having sex with Agustín on Looking — it’s an opportunity to go, “Damn, that looks kind of hot.”\n\nFinally, in honor of Mean Girls’ 15 year anniversary, I want to know what your favorite scene to film was and why.\n\nI loved filming the part where I sing “Beautiful,” because when I’m singing it, the only person in the audience that day was my mom and she was hysterically laughing. She had come to visit Toronto and me, her, and Lizzy Caplan stayed up that night and made pepperoni bread for the cast and crew.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nGet the best of what's queer.
