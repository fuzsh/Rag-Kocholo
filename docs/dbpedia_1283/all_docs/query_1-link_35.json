It already has opened 13 of the planned 25 new locations for 2019, a spokeswoman told VMAIL.\n\nEyemart Express ranked as the No. 11 optical retail business in the 2019 Vision Monday Top 50 Optical Retailers report, with annual sales of roughly $265 million. The company plans to increase its footprint by opening 25 locations and completing expansion into four new states by the end of this year. The four states are: Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.\n\n“The drive behind our aggressive growth strategy is to make prescription eyewear accessible and convenient for more communities,” Bender said in the announcement. “Seeing clearly should not be a burden or an excessive expense for any family. We work hard to make all our locations an affordable one-stop shop for all eyewear needs.”\n\nEyemart Express carries more than 2,000 fashionable, low-cost frames for prescription glasses and sunglasses that support a variety of customer needs, according to the announcement. Frames range from exclusive private label brands to well-known brands. Stores also feature onsite labs, so 90 percent of glasses can be ordered and received on the same day—some in as little as 30 minutes, according to the announcement.\n\nThe company noted that its growth helps entire communities, as well. “Job creation is an important factor in determining new store locations — we examine where Eyemart Express can make the biggest contribution to local economies with career opportunities,” Bender said. More than 300 jobs will be created for hourly wage earners as a result of the optical retailer’s expansion this year, according to the announcement.\n\n“When local associates join our team, they are taught everything about prescription eyewear and are truly trained in a trade,” Gianna Venturi, chief people officer, said. “They become opticians and have those skills for the rest of their lives.”"
