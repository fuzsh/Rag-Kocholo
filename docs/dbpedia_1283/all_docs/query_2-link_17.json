        "text": "I am new to the area (West Cary) and need new glasses. Iâ€™m looking for an optical center with a good optician, trendy selection of frames, and a staff that can recommend frames that look good on you. I have very poor vision and rely heavily on the input of the staff. Thanks and Happy New Year!\n\nHello all. I have been purchasing my eyeglasses from Lenscrafters for awhile. Because I have to get Progressives, they run up the prescription cost. My EyeMed is excellent insurance with frame allowances. What other places do you all use to get your prescription glasses? I just purchased new Vogue glasses today that were expensive as usual because of the Progressive prescription. They would be cheaper if not for that. I was looking online at Zenni. I got sunglasses back in 2016 from them, but they were free under a promotion. I do have 30 days after I get them if I am not satisfied to return them. Thanks."
