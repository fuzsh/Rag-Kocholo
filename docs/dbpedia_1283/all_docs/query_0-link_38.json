        "text": "We visited the store in Jonesboro\n\nWe visited the store in Jonesboro, AR on July 31, 2024, Cailey T. was the only associate working the front. She was awesome. If she was working with a customer ,she greeted the new ones when they came in and told them to pick out their frames. We went back in less than an hour to pick up the glasses and she was still very busy. She was very friendly and knowledgeable of her job. She just needed help that day.\n\nDate of experience : July 31, 2024\n\nExcellency\n\nJimmy Saba(General) is the Best Everrrrr. I came into his establishment, unsure of what I really wanted. Jimmy didn't rush me. Also, he informed me of the specials they had. Well, I ended up getting 2 pair of glasses. When I say that Jimmy took care of my needs.....he indeed did his thing. Jimmy, thank you so much and thanks for excellent customer service. Ask for Jimmy Saba at Eyemart Express off Capital Blvd., Raleigh, NC. You won't be disappointed....I promise\n\nScarlette Holloway\n\nDate of experience : July 26, 2024\n\nCame through the door at 5:45 pm\n\nCame through the door at 5:45 pm. It was like I was a ghost. I mean totally ignored. So I went to have a seat. A man walked in after I was seated about 15 min. He was greeted and seen. As I sit there waiting. I left frustrated at 6:15.\n\nThere should be a sign in sheet to sign in and be seen. The rudeness of the employees is a different story.\n\nDate of experience : July 31, 2024\n\nAugusta Manager\n\nWent in and ordered glasses and sunglasses from them. First set of glasses I disliked and went to exchange the frame. To start with manager came up to counter and said she will be right with me. Walked off to do what she was doing. Then stopped and talked to some contractors in the office as I stood at front desk waiting. After about 20 minutes of her yapping an assistant came and helped me as she continued to yap at contractors due to flood in-store. The associate that attempted to help me wanted to charge me again. Manager stepped in and corrected. Glasses arrive I go to pick them up manager helps me after I had to interrupt her with what she was doing. Handed me my glasses and said I was allset. I got her to adjust them and she Said they were my regular glasses but they were not. They were my readers. Good thing I figured it out before I drove with them. The manager in Augusta Maine should not be in management. Her assistant should be the manager. She is kind of lost or burnt out. Someone is going to hurt or killed because of a wrong decision.\n\nAs a follow up the gentleman that works for them stepped up to the plate and figured out the issue. Issue resolved.\n\nDate of experience : July 22, 2024\n\nVisited Store in Springfield Illinois‚Ä¶\n\nVisited Store in Springfield Illinois Absolutely was shocked the Store was filled with people only two opticians. Was told to wait when asked if I needed to Check in 30 min later asked again, and was told they are full I would need to schedule an appointment. I called the next morning to be greeted by Optican Gayle who was extremely Rude, very aggravated that I had questions. I am a retired Optican, and know the information she was giving was incorrect. I explained I needed to make an appointment she proceeded to tell me the Doctor was leaving at 1:30 not happening. This Store needs a revamp it‚Äôs potential to succeed is limitless if you have Staff that are there to serve the Public, and be blessed they have a job instead of angry, rude, and of no assistance if I could rate this store a 0 I would very dissatisfied\n\nDate of experience : July 12, 2024\n\nForewarning: Shop Anywhere Other Than Eyemart Express\n\nPrices are a bit high compared to other better quality glasses/shops on the gulf coast and online. The customer service is not good at all, unless you speak directly with a manager. Called to see if I could get a replacement pair of my glasses that were destroyed and lost in a near fatal car accident I was recently in. After going through unnecessary trouble with a rude employee who kept talking over me and claiming she couldn‚Äôt find my acct/purchase history info, I spoke with the manager who asked me ONE question and pulled up the acct/purchase history with ease. I purchased a pair of glasses in Jan 2024 for $141.88 and bought the $30 1-year warranty along with it. The manager tells me I can‚Äôt have the glasses replaced bc the $30 warranty for these unnecessarily expensive PLASTIC glasses only cover scratches, cracks, or breaks.. not lost/stolen items‚Ä¶ NEVER buying from eyemart express again. ‚úåüèΩ\n\nDate of experience : June 09, 2024\n\nDon't shop if wearing Bifocals.\n\nHave always shopped at Eyemart Express in granger on University Dr, never had any problems before. Had to have this last pair made over 3 times because they couldn't get the bifocal line right. I even went to second eye Dr for another exam to see if that was the problem., The eye Dr did change the prescription to see if that would help. The district manager was very helpful trying to make things right and TJ at Eyemart Express was wonderful. Problem Being I paid money for glasses and sunglasses I still can't wear to this day. (4/25/2024) I'm still wearing my old glasses because I truly feel it's the manufacture of the glasses. They are so thick and look different. I can't believe how many people while sitting there were having their glasses remade because the bifocal wasn't right. Word of WARNING! if you wear bifocals don't shop at Eyemart anymore.\n\nDate of experience : August 01, 2023\n\nBeware of the Upscale!\n\nI was planning on buying two pairs of glasses so was happy to see their sale of 2 glasses for $40. Saleswoman insisted I needed progressives. Took me to a different rack and picked out different frames. Insisted I should use my insurance. With insurance the total came to over $300! I then wanted to return to the frames on sale and she kept pushing progressives. Luckily my husband came to my rescue and reminded her of the sale two progressives for $80. You can see that sale online but not in the store. At that point I was ready to take my prescription to a competing eyeglass store in the same plaza. I carried on with sale. It is a good deal and my glasses were ready within a half hour. My feelings towards the salesperson who kept insisting on getting progressives and taking advantage of my insurance was not good. She would have easily taken advantage of me. That is not a feeling I like. I will be trying the competition if I need to replace these glasses in the future.\n\nDate of experience : June 03, 2024\n\nMeridian Idaho location:\n\nMeridian Idaho location:\n\nMy first experience with Eyemart Express was frustrating because they got my original order wrong and charged me an additional $10.00 to re-order. Then they refused to repair scratches even though I had them less than 30 days. They blamed it on the employee \"who no longer works here\" who failed to add the anti-scratch (again ordered wrongly) and insisted on an additional $50.00. The Manager girl did not seem interested in trying to make this right with me (rude) and I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nDate of experience : July 01, 2023"
