        "text": "Owensboro, Kentucky is home to a new Eyemart Express store and they've teamed up with WBKR to celebrate. Eyemart Express prides itself on \"same-day\" service. You can get an eye exam and get your glasses all in the same day. Eyemart Express says other stores claim that level of service, but they \"deliver!\" And they deliver quickly. According to their website, some orders can be filled within 30 minutes.\n\nAt Eyemart Express, same-day walk-in appointments are accepted. The store hours are as follows:\n\nMonday through Friday 9 AM - 7 PM\n\nSaturday 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nHere at WBKR, we're teaming up with Eyemart Express for a really cool contest, just in time for the holiday gift-giving season. You could win a cool stocking stuffer for someone on your shopping list or, if you wear or need glasses, you could just keep the prize for yourself if you win one. We're giving you the chance to win a $150 gift certificate and we have multiple certificates to give away. If you'd like to register for a chance to win, keep reading!\n\nEyemart Express takes major forms of vision insurance from companies like EyeMed, Spectera and Superior Vision. If you carry a different brand and would like to see if it's accepted, you can simply call the Owensboro office at (270) 713-0966.\n\nOwensboro's Eyemart Express store is located at 5040 Frederica St, Suite A. It's adjacent to Zaxby's in front of Towne Square Mall.\n\nIf you'd like a shot at winning a $150 Eyemart Express gift certificate, simply fill out the form below. But hurry! The deadline to register is 11:59 CST on Friday, December 1st. We'll be awarding a total of FIVE certificates. Good luck!"
