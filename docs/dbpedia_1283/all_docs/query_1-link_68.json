        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS -- Eyemart Express, a discount one-hour eye care retailer, is opening its first stores in Michigan as part of an aggressive 30 store expansion in small and mid-sized markets across the country.\n\nThe two new stores will be in Grand Rapids, at 3468 28th St. next to Jared's across from the Centerpointe Mall, and in Kalamazoo, at 6483 S. Westnedge Ave. across from Crossroads Mall next to Men's Wearhouse.\n\n\"We are excited to open two new stores in the Greater Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo Area. Eyemart Express is devoted to bringing shoppers value combined with the convenience of an in-store optical lab,\" says Dr. Doug Barnes, owner and president, of the chain that sells glasses starting at $39.\n\n\"Our concept is built around providing a great selection of brand name frames at prices lower than the competition along with the convenience of one-hour service. In fact, in light of the downturn in the economy, we've lowered prices to give an even better value to our customers.\"\n\nAfter opening its first store in 1990 in Appleton, Wis., the chain now has 107 stores in 25 states."
