        "text": "Partnership with national optical retail chain reinforces Sunbit’s position as the Buy Now, Pay Later technology for Local Service Providers and Retailers.\n\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) - Sunbit, the preferred buy now, pay later technology of service providers and retailers, announced today that it has been selected by Eyemart Express, a leading national optical retailer known for providing affordable and high-quality prescription eyewear in as little as 30 minutes, as the company’s preferred Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) technology partner. Eyemart Express selected Sunbit as its technology partner based on Sunbit’s proven track record in the optical retail space. With this new partnership, Eyemart Express is the first national value optical chain to offer consumers access to a fast and flexible payment option in stores for new glasses and accessories.\n\nWith 229 stores in 41 states, Eyemart Express ranks among the Top 10 optical retailers in the country with its family of brands: Vision 4 Less, Visionmart Express, and Eyewear Express. The company sought a BNPL partner with a national footprint that was also able to deliver an exceptional customer experience in a market where long-term relationships within local communities matter.\n\n“Eyemart Express has a national footprint and recognized from the onset that a successful financing program would require the ability to serve our customers from all walks of life, and provide responsive support for our stores,” said Bill Butler, Chief Operations Officer at Eyemart Express. “Sunbit’s proven track record in the retail sector enabled us to test and launch the program quickly. We are proud to be the first national value optical chain to offer our customers a user-friendly and accessible financing solution in our stores with this partnership.”\n\nSunbit offers access to a 3-month, true no interest plan to all approved patients at participating optical practices, giving customers the ability to buy the eyewear they desire—including upgrades like UV coating and progressive lenses.\n\n“We’re so pleased to have been selected by Eyemart Express to bring BNPL to their customers,” said Idan Tzror, Sunbit’s Head of Retail Operations. “We’re focused on improving the buying and selling process for merchants and consumers in local communities. This relationship is such a solid example of that commitment. We were able to train 30 associates a day - in person - so that they can now confidently offer their customers the option to buy now, and pay over time when checking out.\n\nIn its three months since partnering with Sunbit, Eyemart Express has seen nearly 90% of customers approved for payment plans through Sunbit technology. Customers who choose to buy now and pay over time are spending more than customers who choose to pay with cash or traditional credit cards. Sunbit can be found in nearly 7,000 locations across local communities throughout the United States.\n\nAbout Eyemart Express (https://www.eyemartexpress.com/):\n\nEyemart Express, a national optical retailer known for providing high-quality prescription eyewear in as little as 30 minutes, has been improving people’s lives by helping them see better for more than 30 years.
