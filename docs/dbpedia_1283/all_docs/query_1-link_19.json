        "text": "FSA/HSA\n\nWe happily accept both Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Health Savings Accounts (HSA) to cover the cost of your eyewear, eye exams, and other vision expenses. Both accounts must be linked to a major credit card. The only difference is that FSA funds expire while HSA funds do not.\n\nMedicaid\n\nMedicaid widely varies between states. We accept Medicaid in some states but not in others. Visit your local store, and we’d be happy to provide you with the necessary information and walk you through any questions you might have.\n\nCare Credit/Sunbit\n\nCareCredit is a healthcare credit card designed to assist you with health and wellness costs. It can cover deductibles, exams, frames, and prescriptions. To apply, visit the CareCredit site.\n\nSunbit is a buy now, pay-over-time option available in-store only. Choose from flexible payment plans with no hidden costs or fees in as little as 30 seconds.\n\nMedicare Advantage\n\nWe do not accept regular Medicare as administered directly by the Federal government (CMS), but we do accept Medicare Advantage plans, the majority of which add extra coverage such as routine vision exams and eyewear allowances.\n\nVSP\n\nYes, we accept VSP insurance plans and can help maximize your out-of-network benefits. As one of the largest vision insurance providers, VSP can provide coverage for eye care services that includes exams and prescription eyewear. Visit your local store and use your VSP Insurance to get a free 2nd pair of glasses.\n\nCan I get a free pair of glasses using my insurance?\n\nYes, in many instances, your insurance plan allows you to get a free pair of glasses.\n\nCan you help me with my coverage?\n\nYes, we’re happy to assist with your claim, even if it’s out of network!\n\nDo you take most insurance?\n\nYes, we accept over 1,000 insurance plans including EyeMed, DavisVision, and UnitedHealthcare.\n\nCan I get the best prices even without insurance?\n\nEven if you don’t have insurance, our prices are so low that you won’t even need it!"
