        "text": "One Door, Inc., the leading provider of cloud-based visual merchandising software, today announced a new agreement with national eyewear retailer, Eyemart Express. Eyemart Express will implement One Door’s Merchandising Cloud platform to create and execute merchandising plans that reflect the changing needs of their customers, as well as support the various store footprints that exist across the chain.\n\n“With a selection of over 2,000 high-quality frames that can be made into prescription eyewear the same day, our goal as a value optical chain is to make eyewear accessible and convenient for more communities,” said Paula Puleo Blomquist, Chief Customer Officer at Eyemart Express. “Doing this requires that we transform our merchandising processes, accelerate our ability to match store selections to local needs, and communicate more effectively with store teams. Merchandising Cloud will help us automate our current, manual, planning process and give stores the clear, tailored, guidance they need to deliver a unique, superior customer experience.”\n\nMerchandising Cloud is a cloud-based platform that transforms the way retailers plan, execute and analyze their in-store merchandising. Instead of static planograms, Merchandising Cloud delivers a mobile-first guided and interactive experience tailored to each user in each location. Additionally, Merchandising Cloud uses AI-based Computer Vision and analytics to give retailers real-time visibility into what’s happening in every store.\n\n“To succeed in today’s rapidly changing retail market, innovative retailers like Eyemart Express are recognizing the need to invest in new, digital, capabilities.” said Tom Erskine, CEO of One Door. “We’re excited to work with them to transform and accelerate their merchandise planning, and digitally enable their stores to be a high-quality, one stop shop for all consumer eyewear needs.”\n\nAbout One Door, Inc.\n\nOne Door, Inc. is the leading provider of cloud-based visual merchandising software. With One Door’s Merchandising Cloud platform, space planners, visual merchandisers and store operations teams work across silos to plan, execute and analyze store merchandising plans in a unified, cloud-based application. The result is higher sales, more store team efficiency, and better customer experiences. Learn more at onedoor.com.\n\nAdvertisement"
