        "text": "Eyewear and Beyond\n\nGlasses are a simple, cost-effective, means of correcting vision. Are there other options? Of course. We also offer contact lenses and co-manage corrective surgeries like the Lasik procedure for those who prefer the no-glasses look. Based on the findings of your first or follow-up eye exam, our team can help you decide the best option for you.\n\nDiabetic Eye Care\n\nIf you have diabetes, preventing and managing conditions like diabetic retinopathy is top priority. Our optometrists are well-versed in how diabetes impacts eye health. Regular exams are crucial for early detection and treatment and can reduce the risk of vision loss. Schedule your appointment with us and give your eyes the attention they deserve.\n\nContact Lenses\n\nWe offer a wide range of contact lens brands, including the world’s most advanced photochromic lenses, developed to suit various lifestyles and preferences. From daily disposables to specialized contacts for astigmatism, we’ll help you find contacts with an element of comfort and enhanced convenience in mind.\n\nChildren’s Appointments\n\nChildren require special attention when it comes to eye health, and that’s where we shine. Our pediatric services are all about helping young eyes grow strong and healthy. From routine exams to managing common childhood eye conditions, our providers make sure every visit is relaxed and comfortable for little ones.\n\nMedicare & Medicaid Eye Exams\n\nQuality eyewear and eye care should be accessible to everyone. We accept Medicare and Medicaid for eye exams, helping patients of all ages and backgrounds in Fort Collins, CO and the surrounding mountain regions. Contact us to learn what your vision insurance covers.\n\nEye Disease Management\n\nManaging eye diseases takes expertise, precision, and care. Our clinic specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of various eye conditions. From glaucoma and macular degeneration to dry eye syndrome, our team employs the latest advances in eye care technology and treatments. Trust our experts to provide the care you need for optimal vision health.\n\nFort Collins Frames: Quality Eyeglasses\n\nWhile lenses are the part of glasses which actually affect your vision, frames can affect your appearance and confidence. If you really like your frames, you’re probably going to forget or forego them less often.\n\nEyemart Express prides themselves in maintaining a relevant, broad inventory of frames to compliment all lenses and faces. High fashion? High efficiency? They’ve got it all and, since they make the lenses in-house, can quickly set you up with the perfect match of lenses and frames.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Started your path to better vision."
