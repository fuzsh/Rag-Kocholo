The experience was very condescending..the eye doctor called me the daughter grandfather to which he does not know me. He should keep in mind that as he being from India and a person of color he should stick to his job and not try to be a comedian...yet the eye glass store was perfect...loved the way the personnel treated their customers in a kind and timely manner."
