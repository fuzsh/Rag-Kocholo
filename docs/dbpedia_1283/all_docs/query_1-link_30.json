        "text": "It’s been way too long since I’ve purchased glasses! The last time I bought glasses I was still married, so it’s been over 10 years! Luckily, I got to check out the new Eyemart Express in Rock Hill yesterday. It’s the store’s grand opening so I wanted to go down and do some shopping. I was shocked at the number of styles they have available! They have over 2,000 styles to choose from. I was all over that place trying on all kinds of glasses.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me when I was at Eyemart Express is the customer service. Not only are the folks there super friendly, they’re really helpful. They know their stuff! They helped me find frames that fit my face, and they helped me pick out colors that complemented my complexion and that were funky.\n\nJason Harvey is the manager at the Rock Hill store and he’s great! He took me on a tour of the facilities and showed me the lab. It’s really cool to see how the glasses are made. If you don’t have a current prescription or haven’t had your eyes examined in a while, Eyemart Express can help you there too. Here’s a quick interview I did with Jason about the store.\n\nI know some folks are wary about going into a store and shopping, but Eyemart Express has added new safety measures. All employees are wearing masks, there are only a limited number of people in the store at one time, and they have increased their sanitization steps. Because of the pandemic, I didn’t think I’d be able to try frames on. BUT, I was able to! When you enter the store you’re given a small basket. Every frame you try on goes into the basket. When you’re done shopping, the associates take the frames and put them into a UV light sterilizer. So cool!\n\nTo celebrate their grand opening, Eyemart Express is hooking you up with an awesome deal. Right now you can get two pairs of single vision glasses for $19 or two pairs glasses with progressive lenses for only $68. That’s a heck of a deal! Heck, I paid more for one pair of glasses over 10 years ago!\n\nOne of the things I really like about Eyemart Express is that they are there for the community. They offer an additional 20 percent on everyday discounts to all health care professionals, first responders, school faculty and staff members, and military members and their families with valid IDs.\n\nIn honor of their 30th anniversary, customers who make a purchase at the store this year will automatically be entered to win a $2020 gift card. This gift card can be used on frames, sunglasses, lens treatments, and accessories. One winner will be selected each month! Sweet! 2020 isn’t all bad!\n\nVisit EyemartExpress.com to see all of our store details and to shop online. You’ll really enjoy the selection and the customer service at Eyemart Express. They’ve got glasses for the whole family! When ya go into the Rock Hill store at 2427 Cross Pointe Dr, Rock Hill, SC, make sure you tell em I sent ya in!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eyemartexpress/videos/706436703241584\n\nMelany Myers is a Gastonia native and has spent most of her life here in North Carolina.
