At My Education Discount, our goal is to discover, procure, and share all discount opportunities available to the U.S. education community. While the use of our services is – and always will be – free to educators and staff, the information we provide on our website includes links to various retailers and organizations, some of which pay us a commission on applicable purchases and/or actions at no additional cost to you.
