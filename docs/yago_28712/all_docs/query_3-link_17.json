        "text": "Sir Guildford \"Guilford\" Dudley\n\nBorn 1535 in Northumberland, England\n\nAncestors\n\nHusband of Jane (Grey) Dudley — married 25 May 1553 in Durham House, London, England\n\nDied 12 Feb 1554 at about age 19 in Tower Green, Tower of London, London, England\n\nProfile last modified 21 Jun 2024 | Created 9 Feb 2013\n\nThis page has been accessed 4,651 times.\n\nBiography\n\nGuilford was the son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. Power-hungry and eager to sustain the cause of the Protestants, his father locked him into an unlucky marriage with Jane Grey, the nine days queen. Mary I imprisoned the young couple in the Tower and had them beheaded on the same day [1]. Northumberland was arrested and beheaded after his army was defeated. [2]\n\nIronically, Guilford's brother, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester became Queen Elizabeth I's favourite.[2]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 12 Feb 1554\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Ashley, Mike (2008).
