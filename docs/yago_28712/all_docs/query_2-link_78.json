        "text": "Are you looking for a show similar to \"Bridgerton\"?\n\nMaybe one that doesn't take itself so seriously and isn't afraid to dive a bit into the historical fantasy genre?\n\nThen look no further than \"My Lady Jane,\" the newest hit series from Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe show premiered on Thursday, June 27, and is based on the book \"My Lady Jane\" by Cynthia Hand, Jodi Meadows and Brodi Ashton. It stars newcomer Emily Bader as Lady Jane Grey and Edward Bluemel as her husband Lord Guildford Dudley.\n\n\"My Lady Jane\" pokes fun at itself with the narrator recalling the real tale of the Tudors and how Lady Jane Grey ended up on the throne.\n\n\"Intellectual rebel, a bit of a pain in the ass and a political pawn for her ambitious noble family,\" the narrator said. \"Jane was married without her consent and crowned queen against her will. Then, just nine days later, she was branded a traitor. And wham ... off with her head.\"\n\n\"My Lady Jane\" does not shy away from changing history and makes that very clear from the beginning.\n\n\"Jane could have been the leader England needed,\" the narrator said. \"But instead, history remembers her as the ultimate damsel in distress. (Expletive) that. What if history were different?\"\n\nHere's where to watch \"My Lady Jane,\" which has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhat happens in 'My Lady Jane'?\n\n\"My Lady Jane\" explores the story of Lady Jane Grey, who had the shortest reign in British history of about nine days before being executed by her cousin Mary Tudor at the age of 16 ... with some embellishments of course.\n\nThe show is not realistic by any means but takes on the genre of historical fantasy as it replaces Catholics and Protestants with Ethians ― or people capable of changing into animals ― and Verities, or ordinary humans who despise the former, including the show's Princess Mary.\n\nThis becomes a big plot point as Lady Jane Grey ends up being forced to marry Lord Guildford Dudley, who changes into a horse (except not by choice) during the day.\n\nFor much of the series, Jane wants her independence. She does not want to be married and instead would rather be an herbalist, taking an interest in plants and healing.\n\nSoon after she gets thrown into being queen, she must navigate that, her marriage, the Ethians and people who basically want her dead.\n\nDoes Jane die in 'My Lady Jane'?\n\n*Spoiler alert for the Season 1 finale of \"My Lady Jane\"*\n\nThe narrator's \"What if history were different?\" promise comes true.\n\nThe Season 1 finale sees Lady Jane Grey being brought out to be beheaded and Lord Guildford Dudley put on a pyre. But the two escape their executions with the help of King Edward and some Ethians, among others.\n\nThe two ride off together as Guildford is finally able to control his Ethianism and changes into a horse after Jane declares her love for him.\n\nWho narrates 'My Lady Jane'?\n\nThe narrator of \"My Lady Jane\" is English actor Oliver Chris, who has had roles in \"King Charles III,\" \"Green Wing\" and BBC's \"The Office.\"\n\nHow many episodes in 'My Lady Jane'?\n\nThere are eight episodes in Season 1 of \"My Lady Jane.\"\n\nWill there be a Season 2 of 'My Lady Jane'?\n\nAlthough Amazon Prime has not confirmed a Season 2 of \"My Lady Jane,\" the ending of Season 1 leaves the door wide open. The show has gotten praise on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.\n\n'My Lady Jane' trailer\n\nHere is the trailer for Amazon Prime Video's \"My Lady Jane\":\n\nWhere to watch 'My Lady Jane'\n\nIf you're interested in watching this snarky, funny, romantic and historically inaccurate period drama, look no further than Amazon Prime Video. The show is an Amazon Prime Original, so all eight episodes of Season 1 are exclusively available on the platform.\n\nYou can start a 30-day free trial to binge-watch Season 1 of “My Lady Jane.”\n\nPrime Video is available as a part of the Amazon Prime membership, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually for an individual. The student membership costs $7.49 per month or $69 per year.\n\nMore period drama: What time does ‘Bridgerton’ Season 3 Part 2 come out?
