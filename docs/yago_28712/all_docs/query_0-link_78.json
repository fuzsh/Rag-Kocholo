After completing a foundation course at RADA, he graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in Acting.\n\nDoes Edward Bluemel have a girlfriend IRL?\n\nIt appears Edward is currently in a relationship! He’s currently dating American comedian Mary Beth Barone, who is based in New York City. Mary, 33, often shares photos of her beau on social media — and so does he! The first photo Edward posted of Mary was in 2021, so it looks like they have been together for around three years."
