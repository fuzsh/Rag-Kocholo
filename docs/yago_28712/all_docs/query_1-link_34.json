        "text": "It was actually a double wedding, for Jane’s sister Katherine was also being married, her bridegroom being William, Lord Herbert, the son of the Earl of Pembroke, an ally and friend of Northumberland... The joint wedding ceremony was conducted with great pomp and splendor to underline the importance of the occasion. Durham House had been refurbished with new tapestries, Turkish carpets and new hangings of crimson and gold tissue. The King sent magnificent jewels for the young couples, and commanded his Master of the Wardrobe to supply all the wedding finery, including cloth of gold and silver tissue and rich clothes. Lady Jane wore a gown of gold and silver tissue brocade embroidered with diamonds and pearls. The entire Council attended the wedding, but the wedding banquet and the masques and jousts that followed it were held in private, with no foreign ambassadors being invited. However, the festivities were marred by an outbreak of food poisoning, caused by a cook carelessly selecting the wrong leaves for a hot salad. Guilford Dudley was one of those affected.\n\nAfter the celebrations were over, Jane returned with her parents to Suffolk Place, while her sister Katherine was sent to live with her new husband at Baynard’s Castle... It had been agreed by the Suffolks and Northumberland that the marriages should not be consummated just yet... Jane, with some relief, went back to her studies, while Katherine and William Herbert were given separate bedchambers... History does not record whether or not either couple had any affection for each other; in Jane and Guilford’s case, it is more likely that they were merely indifferent.\n\n“The Children of Henry VIII,” by Alison Weir Portraits by Richard Burchett, 1854"
