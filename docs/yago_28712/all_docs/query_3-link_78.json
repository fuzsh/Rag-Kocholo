        "text": "Amazon Prime Video’s new drama series My Lady Jane poses a looming question: “What if history were different?”\n\nThe historical fantasy show, which premiered on Prime Video in June 2024, reimagines the brief and tragic reign of the real titular character of the series, blending historical context with an alternative, fantastical spin.\n\nLady Jane Grey, often dubbed England's \"Nine Day Queen,\" briefly ascended to the throne in 1553. Her story is one of political maneuvering, religious conflict and untimely tragedy. The new series is a “radical retelling,” per the show’s description, where the fates of Jane and other historical figures are altered, while still paying homage to the real events of the 16th century. Oh, and there’s a major fantasy twist.\n\nThe series, created by Gemma Burgess and based on the best-selling novel by Brodi Ashton, Cynthia Hand and Jodi Meadows, incorporates the spirit and context of the real Jane, while deviating from reality both through fantasy and altered history.\n\nBut how much of My Lady Jane is rooted in the history of the actual queen from which the show takes its name? Read on for the true story of Lady Jane Grey, and how her narrative differentiates from the series.\n\nWho was Lady Jane Grey?\n\nBorn in 1537 in Bradgate, Leicestershire, England, Jane was the great-granddaughter of Henry VII (think, The Tudors). She was supremely well educated in classical languages and Protestantism and, like her character on the show, was known for her scholarly pursuits rather than traditional aristocratic activities such as sports or hunting, per palace management organization, Historic Royal Palaces.\n\nJane also spoke several languages, including Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and was deeply passionate about theology and scholarly correspondence. According to Historic Royal Palaces, when prompted why she wasn’t outdoors, Jane said, “I wist all their sport in the park is but a shadow to that pleasure that I find in Plato. Alas, good folk, they never felt what true pleasure meant.”\n\nWho was Lady Jane Grey married to in real life?\n\nIn 1553, Jane was married to Guilford Dudley, the son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland — who went on to be a pivotal force in Jane’s ascent to the throne.\n\nJane’s marriage to Guilford was orchestrated by Dudley to strengthen his family's influence and to position his son as the potential king. Biographers have noted that Jane herself was not in favor of the union.\n\n“We know Jane didn't really want to be married to him,” Nicola Tallis, author of Crown of Blood: The Deadly Inheritance of Lady Jane Grey, told Time. Tallis also added that there’s a “source” that suggests Jane’s mother was also “really, really against this marriage to Guilford Dudley.”\n\nThe marriage and Jane’s subsequent claim to the throne were part of a larger political maneuvering. The dying King Edward VI, who was Jane's cousin, was persuaded by Dudley to name her as his successor to ensure a Protestant heir, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth, per Britannica.\n\nWhat happened to the real Lady Jane Grey?\n\nJane’s reign as queen began on July 9, 1553, following the death of Edward VI from tuberculosis. However, her hold on the throne was precarious. Mary Tudor, Edward's half-sister and rightful heir by an act of Parliament and Henry VIII's will, garnered significant popular support, per Britannica.\n\nOn July 19, 1553, just nine days after Jane's proclamation as queen, Mary successfully claimed the throne, leading to Jane’s imprisonment in the Tower of London. Initially, it seemed Jane might be spared, but her father’s involvement in subsequent rebellions against Mary sealed her fate. On Feb. 12, 1554, Jane and her husband Guilford were executed for high treason.\n\nWhat is fact amid the My Lady Jane fiction?\n\nIn the opening of the series pilot, a narrator gives an accurate historical recap (albeit with wit and modern flare) of the events that occurred prior to Jane taking the throne (Edward VI’s death, “bloody shocker” of Jane’s crowning), and what happened nine days later (“off with her head.”)\n\nBut the recap ends with the question, “What if history were different?” and the series that ensues deviates from historical accuracy to offer a more whimsical (and less tragic) retelling of Jane’s story.\n\nStill, My Lady Jane maintains the essence of Jane's spirit, highlighting her intellectual curiosity and the political intrigue that surrounded her rise and fall. The show also borrows aspects of the real Jane’s story (getting married against her will) and giving it an alternative narrative (she ends up falling in love with Guilford despite the odds).\n\nIn the end, it’s a fantastical reimagination, exploring the factual conflicts through otherworldly elements. In My Lady Jane, the conflict between Protestants and Catholics is reinterpreted as a struggle between regular humans (called Verities), and Ethians (humans who can transform into animals). In the show, Jane (played by Emily Bader) promotes unity and respect for Ethians during her brief reign. Her husband, Guilford Dudley (Edward Bluemel), is depicted as an Ethian who, from time to time, doubles as a horse."
