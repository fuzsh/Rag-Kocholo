Katy Perry, a prominent figure in contemporary music, was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California. Perry's foray into music began with church choir performances during her childhood. At age 16, she released a gospel album under the name Katy Hudson. Transitioning from gospel to pop, she marked her debut with the wildly successful single "I Kissed a Girl" in 2008, followed by her first album as Katy Perry, "One of the Boys." She chose Perry as her stage name after her mother's maiden name. Perry's impact solidified with her 2010 release, "Teenage Dream," which yielded a series of chart-topping singles like "California Gurls" and "Firework." Her penchant for catchy hooks and vivid lyrics garnered significant attention. After the release of her third pop album, "Prism," Perry performed a sampling of her monster hits at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show. Featuring fireworks, an animatronic lion and guests Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz , the performance won two Emmy Awards. Perry was a part of another major sporting event when her motivational single "Rise" was named as the official anthem of the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. Her presence expanded to television, as she assumed a judging role on "American Idol." She has also seen success as an actress, guest-starring in shows such as "How I Met Your Mother" and "Raising Hope". She made her movie debut voicing Smurfette in "The Smurfs" (2011). Perry's artistry delved into new dimensions with her 2019 album "Witness," showcasing her willingness to experiment. Motherhood further enriched her perspective with the birth of her daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom in 2020. In 2021, Perry began a concert residency named "Play" at Resorts World Las Vegas. Showcasing Katy Perry's bold, colorful, and campy style, it received rave reviews and sold-out crowds.
