        "meta_description": "Katy Perry was born Katy Elizabeth Hudson to pastors Mary and Maurice Hudson. She started singing in her church choir before rising to fame as a pop star. In 2001, she released her first record, a Christian album called Katy Hudson. But as Perry grew up, so did her music taste. In 2007, she released the successful pop album One of the Boys, which featured the hit single “I Kissed a Girl.” Perry’s next record, 2010’s Teenage Dream, shot her into superstardom. She has since dropped three more studio albums: 2013’s Prism, 2017’s Witness and 2020’s Smile. Perry was the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show performer in 2015, breaking the record for the most-watched show in Super Bowl history before being usurped by Rihanna in 2023. Since its 16th season in 2017, Perry has served as a judge on American Idol. In October 2010, Perry married British comedian Russell Brand in India, the same place they got engaged after just four months of dating. Brand filed for divorce in December 2011, which Perry was informed of in a text message shortly before a live performance. Their divorce was finalized in 2012. Following her split from Brand, Perry dated John Mayer on and off from 2012 to 2014. She moved on with DJ Diplo, whom she dated for nearly a year before calling it quits in March 2015. Perry sparked a romance with Orlando Bloom in January 2016. The pair briefly split in February 2017 but were back together by January 2018. Bloom proposed on Valentine’s Day in 2019, but the couple pushed back their wedding amid the COVID-19 crisis. They welcomed their first child together, daughter Daisy Dove, in August 2020. Perry kicked off her Las Vegas residency Play in December 2021. The live show is set to conclude in November 2023.",
