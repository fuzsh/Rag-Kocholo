        "text": "When Katy Perry burst onto the music scene back in 2007 with her hit single “I Kissed a Girl”, we thought we were seeing double because she is the spitting image of actress Zooey Deschanel! There are always actresses and singers who look alike but the similarity between these two talented women is uncanny - they could almost be twins with their dark hair, pale skin and blue eyes! They both also share a quirky fashion sense, a love of vintage fashion and bright colors. Both of them definitely have a strong sense of style both when dressing casually and at red carpet events - Katy loves sequins, Hello Kitty and things shaped like fruit so it’s always easy to spot her in a crowd! Both are California girls - Katy Perry was born October 25th, 1984 in Santa Barbara and Zooey in Los Angeles on January 17th, 1980. Despite both growing up in sunny California - they had very different upbringings. Katy’s parents are both Christian pastors and Zooey’s mom was an actress and her father a director.\n\nMusic Love\n\nWhat a lot of people don’t know is that they both have a lot more common musically than you might think. Even though we mostly know Zooey Deschanel from movies like 500 Days of Summer, Elf and Almost Famous, she’s an accomplished singer and musician as well with two albums released called Volume One and Volume Two - she even sang in the movie Elf! She plays keyboards percussion, banjo and the ukulele and started her singing career performing in a jazz cabaret act called If All the Stars Were Pretty Babies. When she was in high school, she wanted a career in musical theatre! Katy Perry also started young - she knew she wanted to embark on a musical career so finished high school early so she could get started! By the time she became a famous pop star, she had already recorded a gospel album and another one which was never released. Now that’s what we call a happy coincidence - not only do Katy and Zooey look like twins, they both have the talent and passion for music!\n\nLooking lovely with blunt cut bangs Katy (L) Zooey (R)\n\nZooey (L) and Katy (R) both rocking a headband\n\nZooey on the left and Katy on the right\n\nRelated Articles:"
