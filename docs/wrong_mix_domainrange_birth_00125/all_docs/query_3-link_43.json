She later adopted her mother's maiden name to lessen confusion with actress Kate Hudson. Now singing as Katy Perry, she released Ur So Gay in 2007, spurring criticism of it for homophobia, though such is far from clear-cut. Perry claims the song is about her excessively emo ex-boyfriend.[2] A second single in a similar vein, I Kissed a Girl climbed to #1 on the Billboard 100, June 2008, and she has been a consistent presence in pop music ever since.\n\n[1] Interview with Zack, \"Katy Perry: The New Gay Interview\", The New Gay, 10 June 2008: \"I love my men. I'm not a lesbian, but I can appreciate the beauty of women. Thats what [I Kissed a Girl] is about: me opening up a magazine and seeing Scarlet Johansen and saying, if she wanted to to kiss me I wouldn't say no.\"\n\n[2] Interview with Mike Burr, \"Bathing Suits, Guyliner, and Mercury Worship\", Prefix Magazine, 6 February 2008. \"[Ur So Gay] is about a specific guy that I used to date and specific issues that he had. The song is about my ex wearing guyliner and taking emo pictures of himself in the bathroom mirror. The listeners have to read the context of the song and decide for themselves.\"\n\nFather: Keith Hudson (Evangelical preacher)\n\nMother: Mary Hudson\n\nBoyfriend: Johnny Lewis (actor, together 2006)\n\nBoyfriend: Travie McCoy (musician, together 2008)\n\nHusband: Russell Brand (comic actor, m. 23-Oct-2010, sep.
