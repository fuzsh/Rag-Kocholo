        "text": "Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter and television judge. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager.\n\nWhy She and Her Songs Rock\n\nShe has powerful vocals.\n\nMany of her music videos are amazing and well-edited.\n\nShe has catchy songs like \"Roar\", \"Dark Horse\", \"Firework\", \"Hot n Cold\", etc.\n\nHer outfits are always on point.\n\nShe has a great sense of humor.\n\nShe's very devout of her self-care.\n\nShe is a great actress and voice actress and is well-known for voicing Smurfette in The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2. She even described Smurfette's character as \"vulnerable\" and \"complex\".\n\nShe supports the United States' armed forces. In 2010, she performed for the troops along with other singers at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, California. In 2012, Katy actually trained with Marines and featured them in the music video for her song \"Part of Me\".\n\nShe featured Rebecca Black in her \"Last Friday Night\" video when Black was being criticised for her song \"Friday\".\n\nShe's not afraid to open up about serious topics, like depression, insecurity and addiction.\n\nShe supports Black Lives Matter and Pride.\n\nShe doesn't hide her opinions or feelings.\n\nShe is able to tell others that they must love who they are and be proud of their flaws.\n\nWhen she hits it just right, the result is catchy tunes with powerful messages.\n\nShe changes with every album to try new things, and she's not afraid to do so.\n\nHer concerts are all very unique and show that being crazy can be good sometimes.\n\nShe really knows how to help others in times of need. Along with travelling on behalf of UNICEF as a goodwill ambassador to help bring attention to the most vulnerable children around the world, Katy has routinely donated massive sums to charities she supports, like the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and the SPCA. In 2016, Hillary Clinton surprised Katy by presenting her with the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award at a UNICEF gala to acknowledge her hard work and dedication to the organization.\n\nShe has words of wisdom and has given many inspirational quotes, such as \"I think it's important for people to see, and young kids to see, you don't have to be perfect to achieve your dreams.\"\n\nThroughout her career, she has sold 11 million albums and 81 million singles worldwide.\n\nBad Qualities\n\nShe has been known for her longtime rivalry with Taylor Swift, but it ended quite some time ago and now they're friends.\n\nShe has a history of saying the exact wrong thing, time and again. For example, she joked about Britney Spears' mental health.[1] and made racially insensitive comments about Barack Obama.[2]\n\nHer album Witness received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences.\n\nHer music videos for \"Bon Appetit\" and \"Swish Swish\" were both poorly received as the former was viewed as overly sexual and disgusting in general and the latter was viewed as very \"cringy\" and way too commercial with all the references to memes (specifically the hated Backpack Kid).\n\nHer instances of rather questionable, disturbing, creepy and downright predatory behavior (which include accusations and caught-on-camera moments) and/or outright sexual misconduct that she got called out on but never got punished for whereas most men who had similar allegations got punished immediately. They include giving an unwanted kiss to a contestant on American Idol (which was caught on live TV,[3] even the said contestant was uncomfortable because of what she did),[4] being accused of sexual assault by her male co-star from the Teenage Dream music video[5] (in which she allegedly forcefully pulled down his pants which exposed his crotch area in front of her friends who then laughed at him), and groping Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes on two separate occasions (of which there is the former video on YouTube; however, the latter issued an apology to her[6]). This is a big example of double standards.\n\nWhile she does a great job as an actress, some of her movies, like The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2, are a total hit or miss.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nKaty Hudson (2001)\n\nOne of the Boys (2008)\n\nTeenage Dream (2010)\n\nTeenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012)\n\nPrism (2013)\n\nWitness (2017)\n\nSmile (2020)"
