        "text": "A singer and model who co-wrote Katy Perry’s “Walking On Air” is missing after being evicted from her Beverly Hills rental — and her friends are desperate for help in finding her.\n\nCamela Leierth-Segura, 48, a Swedish-born musician, was last seen June 29, according to a missing-persons report posted by the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonita.\n\nShe had recently been evicted from her rental property in Beverly Hills, her landlord told KABC.\n\nFriends and neighbors told the outlet she was struggling to pay her rent.\n\nNeighbors noted there were dead plants on her balcony, as well as a “For Rent” sign outside.\n\nAlso missing is Leierth-Segura’s 19-year-old cat, Morris, the outlet said.\n\nLeierth-Segura’s friend Liz Montgomery, a writer, reported her missing to police in July after her family in Sweden was unable to contact her.\n\nThe missing woman’s sister also got in contact with a friend from New York to help, according to the outlet.\n\n“We are desperately seeking information on the whereabouts of our dear friend, and sister, Camela Leierth, who may also be using the name Camela Leierth Segura,” Montgomery wrote on Instagram.\n\n“We are extremely worried about her safety, and despite our best efforts, the local authorities have not been able to locate her,” she wrote.\n\n“She means the world to us and time is of the essence,” the friend added.\n\nLeierth-Segura’s friends said her 2010 silver Ford Fusion with California plate 6KZJ725 was last seen in Beverly Hills, according to KABC.\n\n“I’d like to think nothing bad happened, but do I think something bad happened? Yeah,” friend Cecilia Foss told the outlet.\n\nLeierth-Segura was one of several songwriters credited on Perry’s “Walking On Air,” a song from her 2013 album, “Prism,” that was described as a deep house and disco tune with ’90s EuroVision vibes, Deadline reported.\n\nShe also collaborated with the Swedish band Kent and was an accomplished solo artist, according to Los Angeles Magazine.\n\nLeierth-Segura is described as a blond, white woman with blue eyes, standing 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 125 pounds.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Beverly Hills Police Department at 310-285-2184."
