In January, he announced that he and his husband, Bobby Boyd, found a buyer for Matthew Perry's Malibu beach house. \"Could I beeeee anymore excited to announce the sale of this home?! he captioned an Instagram post at the time. \"JUST SOLD OVER ASKING! Matthew Perry’s Malibu mansion for $13,100,000 with [Bobby].\" Just two months prior, he revealed he had teamed up with Josh Altman to co-list Kim Kardashian's former home for $5.295 million.\n\nIn July 2020, Josh announced that he represented the buyer in yet another major sale. \"We closed today, escrow on Lori Loughlin and Mossimo [Giannulli]’s house,\" he told Extra at the time. \"We closed that today, which was a great sale. That one we sold to my buddy Justin [Mateen], who created Tinder… We closed that at $18.75 [million].\"\n\n“It’s just stunning,\" he added. \"Really a magnificent house.\""
