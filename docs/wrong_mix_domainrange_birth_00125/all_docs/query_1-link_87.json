        "text": "Resilience comes from positivity, learning, growing, understanding, and gaining knowledge and skills. The book, Communicating Hope and Resilience Across the Lifespan, explains resilience as adjusting to circumstance, to thrive, and regaining equilibrium after exposure to disruptive forces and adverse events. This book by Bech and Socha also taught me that having close relationships and resources, being healthy, strong, and fit, and believing in a higher power and being involved in spiritual communities, are all protective factors when coping in the process of resilience. When thinking about resilience and whom portrays it well I immediately thought of Katy Perry. I did not think about her because she went through illness or a huge disaster but she overcame others opinions and many rejections to make her dream come true. Perry had to learn how to have a normal and healthy life, eventually over come disapproval and heart break, and eventually slight depression.\n\nKatheryn Hudson, better known as Katy Perry was born on October 25, 1984, in a very conservative household. With pastors as parents she was only able to listen and watch the Sister Act 1 soundtrack and movie. Kathryn and her two other siblings were also “not permitted to watch such cable channels as MTV and VH1,” Katheryn told Seventeen Magazine (Bio.com). At age nine Katy Perry began singing lessons and a few years later at the age of 13 she learned how to play the guitar. She also started rebelling around this time as well by ‘piercing her own nose’. Perry became interested in having a musical career so she and her mom went off to Nashville multiple times to record a gospel album released in 2001. This album reached a few hundred people before it went bankrupt. Katy ended up getting her GED and became focused on her music and moved to Los Angeles at the young age of 17. She told Seventeen Magazine, “It was five years of living in L.A. with no money, writing bad checks, selling my clothes to make rent, [and] borrowing money” (Bio.com). Along with this hardship, she dealt with many disappointments before getting her ‘big break’ that she was determined to get. Even though people had thought of her as ‘damaged goods’ she demonstrated resolute, perseverance, and strength of purpose.\n\nKaty Perry signed with Capitol in 2007 after having three other record deals fall apart. Her first single released was “Ur So Gay” but her career wasn’t fully kicked off until her single “I Kissed a Girl” was released in 2008. Katy Perry’s success continued from here, hitting Billboard charts #1 with multiple songs, “beating Mariah Carey’s career total record of 45 weeks with all her hits,” and becoming Billboard’s Woman of the Year (Bio.com). Perry explained in her documentary that her dream since she was 9 years old was to be on stage in front of thousands of people in a shiny costume; well, her dream came true. She said, “I feel a real connection to fairytales, sometimes I even feel like I live in a fairytale.” The real question, from everyone close to her, was “can Katy survive this tour?” because she never had done anything like this before.\n\nWhile Katy was very busy traveling all over the world she was able to craft normalcy. Crafting normalcy is to create the quality or condition of being normal no matter the circumstance. We learn this from the Buzzanell article Resilience: Talking, Resisting, and Imagining New Normalcies Into Being, that “people say and do things to put their lives back in order, to achieve normalcy.” Katy Perry’s life illustrates this idea by seeing how she was able to work out with a personal trainer who went on tour with her. Perry had provided sustainability for herself who is being able to “endure and remain healthy and capable over time; to maintain a desired state of health and well being.” Katy eventually married Russell Brand who she would fly back and forth to see when she was performing near him. She mentioned in her movie, “I am just trying to keep my marriage alive.” Unfortunately, some things just are not meant to work out no matter how much optimism and flexibility Katy showed towards her marriage. Optimism is the “expectation of a positive outcome and a focus on the most hopeful aspects of a situation” and flexibility is the “capability to adapt to new, different, or changing requirement, or adaptability,” defined by the Resilience Solution Group. Katy showed this by flying back and forth on her days off between shows, many times out of the country. Also she mentioned that, “if you can believe in something great you can achieve something great.” She stated in her movie, “being in love is the dream, and then the reality of making it work with your marriage is not like the movies. There’s a lot more compromise and sacrifice or it just won’t work.” Russel Brand and Katy Perry’s marriage ended due to irreconcilable differences and she went through a very rough and depressing stage in her life.\n\nThe talented singer and songwriter was able to realize that “the bad that comes along with the good is a journey and [she] learned a lot from that journey.” Katy showed resilience in many of her statements and actions in her movie. She felt like she, “got a second chance at a brilliant life,” even though she already has one. Perry also realized, “I just need to remind myself that I have [it].” Katy also portrayed mindfulness, “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. Mindfulness encourages us to observe actively but without judgment and to engage with rather than with withdrawal from life’s vicissitudes” (Buzzannell). She made this very obvious in her meet and greets at shows and the way she lived and conversed with people. She loved everyone and made it her purpose to let others know that by doing so much for her fans and living in the moment and paying attention to the details and people occurring at that moment.\n\nKaty Perry: Part of me documentary said, “It was a year full of tremendous success and heart break.” Katy Perry proved to herself and her fans that she would and did make it. Having a spiritual community, containing her family and her relationship with God really helped her get through the hardships. Also, her fans and crew were another community that helped her to push herself. Perry had that connectedness, mentioned in the Resilience Solutions Group, to “develop and maintain close ties with other people and the community” with many people (Buzzanell).\n\nShowing all seven qualities of resilience, I have found inspiration from Katy Perry and how she proved herself and continued to show that no matter what breaks you down, you have the opportunity to get back up. She balanced her career and romantic life for as long as she could and showed that there were a “range of possibilities and a mix of alternative actions.” Perry had hope in a ‘brilliant’ and successful life by using many goals. One goal was to “make people smile and leave their heart with hope and happiness.” Finding and being resilient comes in many shapes, forms, and sizes. It takes time with a positive and hopeful mind to get there but the outcomes are worth the perseverance.\n\nWork Cited\n\nBio.com. A&E Networks Television, n.d.
