        "text": "Katy Perry really wants to live in a convent. Surely, this would make her Pentecostal pastor parents proud. The pop singer’s pursuit isn’t to purify any “sins”—like falling under the starlet spell of guitar wizard John Mayer or marrying (and divorcing) outrageous comedian Russell Brand, many a parent’s nightmare.\n\nIn 2015, Perry shelled out nearly $15 million for a sprawling 8-acre Los Feliz, California villa estate (formerly the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary convent) because it’s unique, spectacular and blessed with good karma. Or so we thought.\n\nThe new American Idol judge’s curious case for the elusive convent just got stranger before an official magistrate. An elderly nun who challenged Perry’s purchase of the Medievalish hilltop estate died suddenly during a March 9th court proceeding, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nSister Catherine Rose Holzman, 89, collapsed at a court hearing indirectly related to her order’s protracted lawsuit with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over who owns the right to sell the Spanish-Gothic estate, which boasts 30,000 square feet of interior living space, an adjacent prayer quarters, an Esther Williams-style fountain pool, and a Medieval-like tower.\n\nArchitect Bernard Maybeck built the estate in 1927 for Earle C. Anthony who founded radio station KFI-AM in Los Angeles. The house was then sold in the 1950s to Catholic philanthropists Daniel and Bernadine Murphy Donohue. In 1972, Holzman and her fellow Sisters pooled their money to purchase the property from the Donohues at a deep discount. The nuns lived in the estate until 2011 when the Archdiocese forced their relocation.\n\nThen things got really messy. When the nuns sold the large estate to Silver Lake, California businesswoman Dana Hollister in 2015, the Archdiocese balked, claiming the Sisters didn’t have the right to sell. Concurrently the Archdiocese approved a sale to Katy Perry for $14.5 million (including $10 million cash).\n\nEverything was complicated by the fact that Hollister already moved into the estate, took control of the title, and changed the locks. Perry and the Archdiocese sued Hollister, citing both interference and an invalid sale (the Archdiocese claims Hollister paid just $44,000 and a non-recourse promissory note that didn't guarantee future payment).\n\nIn April 2016, a judge blocked the nuns sale which should have cleared a path for Perry to finally purchase the estate. Last fall, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled Hollister acted with malice and fraud, stating she knew the nuns didn't have the authority to sell the estate. The trial jury awarded Perry and the Archdiocese compensatory damages and later punitive damages—totaling more than $15 million.\n\nHollister (a real estate investor who intended to convert the convent into a boutique hotel) subsequently filed for bankruptcy, according to MyNewsLA. The nuns, emboldened by religious conviction and perhaps nostalgia for their former home, stood by Hollister.\n\nThey even appealed to a higher power to assist them—the Vatican, which oversees the Archdiocese. That unlikely effort seems a longer shot after Holzman’s tragic death at the post-judgment hearing. Despite the legal dispute, Archbishop José H. Gomez released a statement on Holzman’s passing:\n\n“Sister Catherine Rose served the Church with dedication and love for many years and today we remember her life with gratitude,” he said. “We extend our prayers today to the Immaculate Heart of Mary community and to all her friends and loved ones.”\n\nAs far back as 2015, a conciliatory Perry attempted to charm the nuns during a meeting, even reportedly singing \"Oh Happy Day,\" for them. The pop star told them she plans to live in the estate with her mother and grandmother, sit in the meditation garden, sip tea and find herself.\n\nThe nuns were apparently unimpressed. Holzman wrote to an Archdiocese official: “In selling to Katy Perry, we feel we are being forced to violate our canonical vows to the Catholic Church.”\n\nIn a 2015 Billboard interview, Holzman questioned Perry’s morality, stating, “Katy Perry represents everything we don't believe in. It would be a sin to sell to her.” Sinning, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder, as Perry wasn't the one punished by a jury.\n\nMoney talks. And patience is a virtue. The “By The Grace of God” singer is taking the high road—the one at the Los Feliz hilltop. This pastors’ daughter (a former gospel singer herself), is a judge’s gavel from living in her dream home. And after a lifetime of good deeds, Sister Catherine Rose Holzman is also taking the high road—to heaven."
