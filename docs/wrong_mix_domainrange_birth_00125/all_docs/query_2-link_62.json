        "text": "To kick off its 100th season, the LA Phil is joining forces with CicLAvia for a car-free, music-filled fest on September 30 that stretches from Downtown’s Walt Disney Concert Hall to the orchestra’s summer home at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nCelebrate LA!’s afternoon of pop-up performances culminates in a free concert at the Hollywood Bowl, where Gustavo Dudamel will lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic with performances from Herbie Hancock, Kali Uchis, Youth Orchestra Los Angeles (YOLA) and more.\n\nThe latest addition to that concert lineup: Katy Perry. The pop star is slated to perform a short selection of her hits with Dudamel and the LA Phil. Free tickets to her performance, as well as the rest of the evening, will be available via a lottery that opens on August 20 and closes on September 2. Winners will be notified in early September and able to claim two tickets.\n\nEarlier in the day, you can bike, skate or walk between Downtown L.A. and Hollywood as more than 1,800 musicians, artists and dancers will perform at six pedestrian hubs across the eight-mile route. Announced performers include DāM-FunK, Dengue Fever, Dustbowl Revival, Jeff Goldblum and the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra, Ozomatli and more.\n\nHubs in MacArthur Park (Park View St between Wilshire Blvd and 6th St, inside the park), Koreatown (Liberty Park at Wilshire Blvd between Serrano Ave and Oxford Ave), Melrose (Melrose Ave at N Windsor Blvd) and Hollywood (Vine St between Hollywood Blvd and Yucca St) will remain car-free from 9am to 4pm. A shuttle-serviced hub at the Hollywood Bowl (on the Kagan Patio) will wind down at 2pm to prepare for the evening’s concert.\n\nIf you’re shut out of the Katy Perry concert, the Grand Ave Hub (Grand Ave between 1st and 3rd street, outside of the Concert Hall) will host additional performances until 8:30pm."
