        "text": "After a two-year legal battle with a group of nuns (true story), Katy Perry has finally moved into a Los Feliz convent, listing her now unneeded Hollywood Hills estate for $US15 million â€“ about $18.8m Australian dollars.\n\nDomain reports the pop singer has owned the two-home compound since 2013, with the adjacent properties encompassing close to four hillside acres at the top of Los Angeles's famous Runyon Canyon Park.\n\nPurchased by Perry for $US11.2 million ($14.1m), the \"faux compound\" boasts a mock Mediterranean-style house and a mid-century modern home built in 1953.\n\nThe star is said to have quietly listed the estate as a whisper listing and hopes to get around $19 million Australian dollars for the sale.\n\nThe property loving pop princess also recently bought a $US19 million 5-bedroom, 5-bathroom home in Beverly Hills.\n\nMLS"
