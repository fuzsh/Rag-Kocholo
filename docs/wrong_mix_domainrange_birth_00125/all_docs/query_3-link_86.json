        "text": "Follow @TOMOinc\n\nKaty Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson; October 25, 1984) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born in Santa Barbara, California, Perry grew up listening to only gospel music and sang in her local church as a child. After earning her first year of high school, she began to pursue a career in music. As Katy Hudson, she released a self-titled gospel album in 2001, which was unsuccessful. She later recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed the majority of a solo album from 2004–05, the later of which was never released. Perry is the first female artist to get five hits on the Billboard Hot 100 in one year.\n\nAfter signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single “UR So Gay” [Vinyl]\n\nthat November, which garnered public attention but failed to chart. She rose to fame with the release of her second single “I Kissed a Girl“\n\nin 2008, which went on to top international charts. Perry’s first mainstream studio album One of the Boys\n\nfollowed later that year and subsequently became the 33rd-best selling album worldwide of 2008. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, while “I Kissed a Girl” and her second single “Hot N Cold“\n\nboth received multi-platinum certifications. In 2009, Billboard magazine named her the 51st-best-selling music artist of the 2000–2009 decade.\n\nHer second studio album Teenage Dream\n\nwas released in August 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album included the Billboard chart-toppers “California Gurls“, “Teenage Dream”, “Firework ”\n\n, “E.T. ” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)”. The album produced five Hot 100 toppers, and was only the second album—after Michael Jackson’s Bad—to do so. With “E.T.\n\n” at number one on the chart of May 12, 2011, Perry became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, she remained in total 69th consecutive weeks in the Top 10.\n\n1984–2006: Early life and career beginnings\n\nPerry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California to Keith, a West Coast scenester in the 1960s, and Mary Hudson (née Perry), an evangelist who grew up in Southern California and had “a tempestuous first marriage in Zimbabwe”. Perry has German, Portuguese, Irish, and English ancestry. She is the second child of two pastors.She has an older sister and younger brother. Perry’s mother’s aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry. Perry was incorporated into her parents’ ministry and sang in their church between the ages of nine and seventeen. She grew up listening to gospel music, was not allowed to listen to what her mother called “secular music”, and attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, Perry learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED after her freshman year at Dos Pueblos High School and decided to leave school in the pursuit of a career in music. Perry initially started singing “because [she] was at that point in [her] childhood where [she] was copycatting [her] sister and everything she [would do].” Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, while Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed them in front of her parents, who suggested she take vocal coaching. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at the age of nine and continued until she was sixteen. She later enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short period of time.\n\nAt the age of 15, Perry’s singing in church attracted the attention of rock veterans from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to polish her writing skills. In Nashville, Perry started recording demos and was taught by country music veterans on how to craft songs and play guitar. Perry signed to the Christian music label Red Hill, under which she recorded her first album at the age of 15. Performing as Katy Hudson , she released the self-titled Gospel-rock album in 2001. The album was unsuccessful, however, after the label ceased operations at the end of 2001. She later changed her surname to Perry, her mother’s maiden name, because “Katy Hudson” was too close to film actress Kate Hudson.\n\nAt the age of 17, Perry left her home for Los Angeles, where she worked with Glen Ballard on an album for record label Island. Growing up listening to mostly gospel music, Perry had few references when she began recording songs. Asked by the producer with whom she would like to collaborate, Perry had no idea. That night, she went with her mother to a hotel. Inside, she turned on VH1 and saw producer Glen Ballard talking about Alanis Morissette; Ballard produced Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, which had had a “huge influence” on Perry. She expressed interest in working with Ballard to her initial collaborator, who arranged a meeting for her with Ballard in Los Angeles. Perry presented one her songs to Ballard, and received a call back a day later. Ballard then helped Perry develop her songwriting over the next few years. The album was due for release in 2005, butBillboard reported it also went nowhere. Perry was dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group. Some of Perry and Ballard’s collaborations included “Box”, “Diamonds” and “Long Shot”, were posted on her official MySpace page. “Simple”, one of the songs she recorded with Ballard, was released on the soundtrack to the 2005 film Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nPerry signed to Columbia Records in 2004. However, the label was not amenable with her vision, not putting her in the “driver’s seat”. Instead, one of Columbia’s ideas was to pair Perry with the record production team The Matrix, who was working on an album, to serve as its female vocalist. Although the album was later shelved, she caught the attention of the music press: Her burgeoning music career led to her being named “The Next Big Thing” in October 2004 by Blender magazine.With no album project ongoing, Perry began recording her own. Eighty percent completed, however, Columbia decided not to finish it and dropped her off the label. While waiting to find another label, she worked in an independent A&R company called Taxi Music. In 2006, Perry was featured in the tail-end of the video to P.O.D.’s single “Goodbye for Now”. She made a cameo appearance in Carbon Leaf’s video, “Learn to Fly”. She also appeared in other videos like Timbaland’s “If We Ever Meet Again” and more. There were other videos she was included in too.\n\n2007–09: One of the Boys and MTV Unplugged\n\nWhile in the process of being dropped by Columbia in 2006, the company’s publicity executive Angelica Cob-Baehler enthusiastically recommended Perry to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. At the time Flom was leading a complete revival in fortunes at the label and looking to crown recent achievements by breaking a global pop act. Despite mixed reactions from fellow Virgin executives, Flom became convinced that Perry could be that breakthrough star, and at the start of 2007 extended discussions with Columbia resulted in Katy Perry signing to the newly created Capitol Music Group, a merger between Virgin and Capitol. As part of the deal, the label secured the masters to the unfinished album, recorded while at Columbia, that would go on form a significant part of her official mainstream debut album, One of the Boys\n\nOne of the Boys was released on June 17, 2008 to mixed critical reviews. The album has reached number nine on the Billboard 200, and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Perry released her second single, “Hot n Cold”, which became her second top three single in dozens of countries around the world, including the United States where it reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the charts in Germany, Canada, and Denmark. After Perry wrapped up her appearance at the Warped Tour, she went on tours in Europe. She later launched her first headlining tour, the Hello Katy Tour, in January 2009. “I Kissed a Girl” earned Perry a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards. Perry was nominated in five categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Female Video, but lost to Britney Spears. She won Best New Act at the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards, which she co-hosted,[ and Best International Female Artist at the 2009 BRIT Awards. On February 9, 2009, both “I Kissed a Girl” and “Hot n Cold” were certified three-time platinum by Recording Industry Association of America for individual digital sales of over three million. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized Perry in its 2010 version as the “Best Start on the US Digital Chart by a Female Artist,” for having her first two singles sell over two million digital copies.\n\nIn December 2008, Perry apologized to British singer Lily Allen for remarks in which she called herself a “skinnier version” of her, saying she meant it as a joke. Allen retaliated and told a British radio station that she “happen[ed] to know for a fact that she [Perry] was an American version” of her because their record company needed “to find something controversial and ‘kooky'” like her. In January 2009, Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour visited North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, the Hello Katy Tour. It began on January 23, 2009 and ended on November 28, 2009, were performed 89 concerts during the world tour. He opened some concerts the band’s tour No Doubt, the Summer Tour 2009.\n\nOn May 16, 2009, Perry performed at the opening ceremony of the annual Life Ball in Vienna, Austria. In June 2009, lawyers acting for Katy Perry opposed the recent trademark of Australian fashion designer Katie Perry who uses her own name to market loungewear. Some media outlets reported this as a lawsuit, which Katy Perry has denied on her blog. Katie Perry the designer reports on her blog that at a hearing with IP Australia on July 10, 2009, the singer’s lawyers withdrew their opposition to the trademark. During the summer of 2009 Perry filmed a cameo appearance for Get Him to the Greek her scene, in which she kisses her future fiancé Russell Brand was cut, and does not appear in the final film. Discussing the issue with MTV, Perry hypothesized there may have been some fear that seeing the two make out would have taken viewers out of the experience. In 2009, Perry was featured on two singles: a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3’s song “Starstrukk” in August (the idea for the collaboration came after Perry’s tour that featured 3OH!3 as the supporting act). The song was released over iTunes on September 8, 2009; and “If We Ever Meet Again “, the fourth single off Timbaland’s album Shock Value II in December. In October 2009, “Katy Perry MTV Unplugged ” revealed that Perry was one of the artists to perform for them, and that she would be releasing a live album of the performance, including two new tracks, “Brick by Brick” and Fountains of Wayne cover “Hackensack”. The album was released on November 17, and includes both a CD and a DVD, debuted at #168 on the US Billboard 200chart.\n\nPublic Image\n\nPerry is known for her unconventional style of dress. It is often humorous, bright in color, and reminiscent of different decades, and she frequently used fruit-shaped accessories, mainly watermelon, as part of her outfits. Since the Teenage Dream era, Perry has included more glamorous and food-related outfits in her wardrobe. Having learned dancing at an early age, she fantasized about having her own style. Perry’s transformation into an artist began with fashion, inspired by American film actress Dominique Swain’s portrayal in 1997 film adaptation of the novel Lolita. She defines her fashion style as “a bit of a concoction of different things”.Johnny Wujek, Perry’s stylist, described her style, upon meeting her for the first time, as “very colorful and vintage”. Her fashion has caught the attention of designers. In June 2008, a publicity photo that showed Perry posing with a switchblade was criticized.The picture was defended as only an effort to give Perry a “sexy, harder edge”. The criticism leveled at her was mocked by Perry who subsequently posed with a spoon instead. She has appeared in FHM Magazine’s 100 Sexiest Women poll twice, ranking at No.23 in 2009 and No.37 in 2010.\n\nMore about Katy\n\nOfficial site\n\nSee All Katy Albums\n\n.\n\nAnd the Vinyl Albums\n\nKaty Import CD\n\nand Also the live album"
