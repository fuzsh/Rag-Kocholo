        "text": "Katheryn Elizabeth \"Katy\" Hudson, better known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American award-winning recording artist, businesswoman, philanthropist, and actress from Santa Barbara. She is also the first female artist to have 5 number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 from one album, (Teenage Dream) and the second artist to accomplish such a feat (the first artist being Michael Jackson with his 1987 album Bad). She is also noted for her fashion, which is often humorous, bright in color, reminiscent of different decades, and has often included food designs. Her philanthropy includes working with UNICEF to assist Madagascar children with education and nutrition.\n\nRebecca Black starred as herself in Katy Perry's music video for \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" and also gave Perry a makeover for the music video, indicating that Perry and Black are most likely good friends. The two also performed Black's hit during a show on the California Dreams Tour.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (née Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson. Her parents are born again Christians, each having turned to God after a \"wild youth\". Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry. Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry. She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer, and an older sister, Angela. From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years. Her family struggled financially, sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.\n\nGrowing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat Lucky Charms as the term \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, \"I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility.\" Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.\n\nCareer Beginnings[]\n\nDuring her freshman year of high school, Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar. After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson. She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour. Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December. Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.\n\nIn 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped. Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler/Anne Previn, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, and Max Martin and Dr. Luke. In addition, after Devine suggested they become a \"real group\", she recorded with the Matrix. Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After she was dropped from Columbia, Perry worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.\n\nPerry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\", which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie. In September 2004, Blender named Perry \"The Next Big Thing\". She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for Cupid's Chokehold.\n\nBreakthrough with One of the Boys[]\n\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material. Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", aimed at introducing her to the music market. A digital EP led by \"Ur So Gay\" was later released to create interest. Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008, stating it was her \"favorite song\". In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\", and appeared as herself during a photo shoot in June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.\n\nPerry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008, as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it. The track reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. One of the Boys, released on June 17, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide. \"Hot n Cold\" was released in September and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100, while topping charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009 and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100. The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.\n\nAfter finishing the Warped Tour 2008, Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act. She embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[63] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of the band No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[64] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies.[65] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys, as well as two new songs, \"Brick by Brick\" and \"Hackensack\".[66] It was released on November 17, 2009. Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[68] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, in January 2010. The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious groups and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiousity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success. After her relationship with McCoy ended in December 2008, Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film. She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.\n\nTeenage Dream and marriage[]\n\nAfter serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[77] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring rapper Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010. The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June. She also served as a guest judge on The X Factor UK later that month[81] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[82] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on Billboard in September. Released on August 24, 2010,[84] the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. It received mixed reviews from music critics, and has since sold 5.7 million copies globally. In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single. It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.\n\nA remixed version of \"E.T.\" featuring rapper Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011. It topped the Hot 100 chart for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the Hot 100. \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June, and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[93] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011 and a 2013 Guinness World Record. On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100. In October, \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single. The song peaked at number three on the Hot 100 and number two in Canada. On February 13, 2012, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart. Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23. Wide Awake was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single, peaking at number two on the Hot 100 and number one in Canada and New Zealand. On January 5, she was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan. That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units.\n\nPerry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream from February 2011 to January 2012. The tour grossed $59.5 million globally and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John, Claudia Leitte, and Rihanna. In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online. Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.\n\nIn December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\". In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey. The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012. She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011. The film was a financial success worldwide, while critics gave mostly negative reviews. She hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011, with Robyn as the episode's musical guest. Perry's work on the episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised her performance in the episode's digital short featuring her and Andy Samberg. In March 2012, she guest starred as a prison security guard named Rikki on the Raising Hope episode \"Single White Female Role Model\". On July 5, 2012, Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was released to theaters through Paramount Pictures. The film received positive reviews and grossed $32.7 million worldwide at the box office.\n\nPerry began to venture into business when she endorsed her first fragrance, Purr, in November 2010. Her second fragrance, Meow!, was released in December 2011. Both perfumes were released through Nordstrom department stores. Electronic Arts recruited her to promote their new expansion pack for The Sims 3: Showtime, before releasing a separate stuff pack featuring Perry-inspired furniture, outfits, and hairstyles, titled The Sims 3: Katy Perry's Sweet Treats, in June 2012. The following month, she became the spokesperson and ambassador for Popchips and made an investment in the company. She was ranked third on the 2011 Forbes list of \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" with earnings of $44 million, and fifth on their 2012 list with $45 million. Billboard dubbed her as their \"Woman of the Year\" for 2012.\n\nShe married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010, in a traditional Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan. Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage. Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led to the end of their marriage, and that he never spoke to her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism. She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide. After the marriage ended in 2012, Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.\n\nPrism and Super Bowl XLIX halftime show (2013-16)[]\n\nIn November 2012, Perry began work on her fourth album, Prism. She told Billboard, \"I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the coloring and the tone\" and \"I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality.\" Although she told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have \"darker elements\" in Prism following the end of her marriage, Perry revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented \"I felt very prismatic\", which inspired the album's name. Roar was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013. It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Unconditionally\" was released as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013, and peaked at number 14 in the United States.\n\nPrism was released on October 18, 2013, and has sold 4 million copies as of August 2015.[148] It received positive reviews from critics[149] and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.[150] Four days later, Perry performed the songs from the album at the iHeartRadio Theater in Los Angeles.[151] \"Dark Horse\" was released as the album's third single on December 17, 2013, and became her ninth U.S. number-one single on January 29, 2014.[152][153] In 2014, \"Birthday\"[154] and \"This Is How We Do\"[155] followed as the album's fourth and fifth singles, and reached the top 25 on the Hot 100.[53] Prior to ending her relationship with Mayer in February 2014, she recorded and co-wrote a duet with him titled \"Who You Love\" for his album Paradise Valley. The song was released on August 12, 2013. Perry's third headlining tour, The Prismatic World Tour, began in May 2014 and concluded in October 2015.
