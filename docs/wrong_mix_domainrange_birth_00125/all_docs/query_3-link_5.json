        "text": "From Kissing a Girl (and liking it) to the Super Bowl and beyond.\n\nKaty Perry is one of the biggest stars of the last 15 years.\n\nShe's also been an ever-present in the showbiz columns, as well as juggling her day job with duties as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and LGBT activist.\n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom welcome first baby with super cute name\n\nWatch Katy Perry's stunning performance of The Beatles classic track 'All You Need is Love'\n\nListen to Smooth's Leading Ladies Live Playlist on Global Player\n\nBut how much do you know about Katy Perry and her stunning career to date?\n\nDo you know her real name, where she was born, or which character she played in The Smurfs movies?\n\nRead on for all the fast facts.\n\nHow old is Katy Perry and where is she from?\n\nKaty Perry was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n√©e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson. She celebrated her 38th birthday in 2022.\n\nHer parents moved across the country when she was a pre-teen, eventually returning to Santa Barbara where she attended Santa Barbara Christian School.\n\nShe would eventually move to Los Angeles just before her career took off.\n\nWhat is Katy Perry's real name?\n\nKaty Perry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson and actually released her debut album under the name Katy Hudson (more on that later).\n\nShe borrowed her mum's maiden name for her stage name when she jumpstarted her life in the music business.\n\nHow many times has Katy Perry been married, and how many children does she have?\n\nIn one of the quirkiest celebrity relationships we an remember, Katy Perry married comedian-turned-actor/turned-activist/turned-conspiracy-theorist Russell Brand in 2010 in a Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan They divorced in 2012.\n\nShe has been dating actor Orlando Bloom since 2016, and they've been engaged since February 2019.\n\nIn August 2020, Perry and Bloom announced the birth of their first child - a daughter named Daisy Dove Bloom.\n\nWhat is Katy Perry's net worth?\n\nWith over a decade at the top of the pop world and five top ten albums under her belt, Katy Perry has shifted a lot of records.\n\nShe also followed up a run of major international arena tours with her absolutely massive Las Vegas Play Residency.\n\nThat two-year run is estimated to have raked in over $40 million alone, and that will have contributed to her estimated net worth of $330 million.\n\nHow did Katy Perry get into music?\n\nWhen 'I Kissed A Girl' shot to number one in the UK and US in 2008 soon after the quirky and controversial Ur So Gay EP, it seemed as though Katy Perry was an instant hit.\n\nBut as is so often in the pop world, her apparent overnight success was a long time coming.\n\nShe followed in her sister Angela's footsteps and had singing lessons when she was nine years old, and sang in her parents' church until she was 17.\n\nKaty also started playing guitar and publicly performing her own songs when she was 13, and after picking up some early qualifications left Dos Pueblos High School to have a career in music.\n\nAfter training in Nashville, she released the Christian rock album Katy Hudson in 2001 when she was just 16. It wasn't a hit.\n\nThe following year she moved to LA and shifted from gospel to secular pop, bouncing around record labels.\n\nA planned album for Island Def Jam affiliate Java was shelved in 2005. The following year a Columbia records album Fingerprints was also dropped.\n\nPerry kept some of those songs, while 'I Do Not Hook Up' and 'Long Shot' ended up with Kelly Clarkson and 'Rock God' went to Selena Gomez & the Scene.\n\nAround the same time, she recorded a bunch of songs with The Matrix production team, which also disappeared for a few years before eventually being released in 2009.\n\nBy that point, Katy Perry had signed to Capitol Records in 2007, and soon released the Ur So Gay EP, the 'I Kissed A Girl Single' and One of the Boys album, and finally, was a superstar.\n\nWhat are Katy Perry's biggest songs?\n\nAfter her flop album Katy Hudson in 2001, Katy Perry broke through with her One of the Boys album in 2008, following it up with the US NINE TIMES platinum Teenage Dream in 2019 and five-times platinum Prism in 2013.\n\nKaty Perry's biggest songs include:\n\nI Kissed A Girl\n\nHot n Cold\n\nCalifornia Gurls (featuring Snoop Dogg)\n\nTeenage Dream\n\nFirework\n\nET (featuring Kanye West)\n\nLast Friday Night (TGIF)\n\nThe One That Got Away\n\nPart of Me\n\nWide Awake\n\nRoar\n\nDark Horse (featuring Juicy J)\n\nRise\n\nChained to the Rhythm (featuring Skip Marley)\n\nNever Really Over\n\nWhat films has Katy Perry been in?\n\nAs well as appearing as herself in various concert movies and documentaries, including of course Katy Perry: Making of the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2015, Katy Perry has also appeared in proper films.\n\nShe had a cameo as herself in comedy sequel Zoolander 2 in 2016, having previously voiced Smurfette in 2011's The Smurfs and 2013 follow-up The Smurfs 2."
