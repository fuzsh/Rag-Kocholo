        "text": "Katy Perry has been engaged to actor, Orlando Bloom, since 2019.\n\nPerry is currently performing shows at The Theatre at Resorts World Las Vegas as of 2022.\n\nKaty Perry listed her longtime Beverly Hills estate for $19.5 mil in 2022.\n\nPerry and Bloom recently purchased a new home in Montecito, CA for $14.2 mil.\n\nSinger, songwriter, and A-list pop star Katy Perry has made quite the name for herself as a global superstar. With that success has come a hefty real estate portfolio. So, let’s find out a little more about the singer, including Katy Perry house photos!\n\nBorn in 1984 and raised in Santa Barbara, Perry grew up with very religious and conservative parents and her initial attempt at breaking into the music industry was with a gospel album. Born as Kathryn, Perry decided to go down an alternative route when her gospel album didn’t produce much success. She shortened her name to Katy, overhauled her image, and released her first single ‘I Kissed A Girl’. Following the hit record, Perry is known for her hit songs such as ‘Teenage Dream’, ‘Roar’, ‘Last Friday Night’, ‘Part of Me’, “Firework’, ‘California Gurls’ and ‘Swish Swish’.\n\nWhere does Katy Perry live?\n\nAs of 2022, Perry and fam are living in a gorgeous Montecito estate in Santa Barbara County! Katy and hubby, Orlando Bloom, purchased the home in 2020 for $14.2 million to act as home base for their growing family.\n\nMore on Katy Perry house and Orlando Bloom House below!\n\nKaty Perry House Montecito / Orlando Bloom House\n\nKaty Perry House Beverly Hills (Former)\n\nKaty Perry House Hollywood Hills (Former)\n\nKaty Perry House Montecito / Orlando Bloom House\n\nIn October 2020, it was revealed that Katy Perry and Orland Bloom scooped up a stunningly renovated home in celebrity-loved Montecito for $14.2 million. Listed by the previous owner, former CEO of both Chrysler and Duracell C. Robert Kidder, the couple got quite a deal compared to the original $19.25M asking price.\n\nThe stunning 7,000+ square foot home boasts 6 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a full detached guest house, and a pool cabana. The rare property is actually made up of 4 parcels and is accessible only via a long, dramatic, tree-lined driveway.\n\nKaty Perry House Beverly Hills (Former)\n\nKaty Perry purchased her $17.995 million Beverly Hills mansion in 2017. The home is 5,427 square feet and boasts 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. It is a secluded property that is well hidden and offers the star a private residence in a gated community in Coldwater Canyon, a celebrity-filled area of Beverly Hills. A few of her uber-famous neighbors were Jennifer Lawrence, Adele, and Cameron Diaz.\n\nUpon approaching the home, you will travel along a ¼ mile long paved driveway before reaching large and magnificent gates. There is said to be off-street parking for up to 20 cars on this driveway. The home features large glass panels that open up the high-ceilinged rooms even more. Outside there is a large and spacious backyard that has a double-edged infinity pool, landscaped grassy areas, shady veranda, and spectacular views of the woody canyon.\n\nThe home is fairly contemporary, yet has a traditional look about it. The driveway and front of the house are shaded by beautiful trees and greenery which gave the pop star even more privacy. The surroundings are, well, not much really! In this Californian home, the neighbors are not that close, as the mansion is in the midst of the undeveloped land.\n\nIn 2022, Katy decided it was time to part ways with the lavish property and listed it for $19.5 million. As of now she is still looking for a buyer.\n\nWhat is Katy Perry’s address? Oh, so you want all our secrets, huh? You can have them here: Katy Perry’s House address and more photos!\n\nKaty Perry House Hollywood Hills (Former)\n\nPrior to upgrading to her new digs, the Swish Swish singer owned another mansion in Hollywood Hills, which she sold in October 2017 for $9.5 million. This home had 4 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms and was located in Output Estates, another lavish area of Hollywood.\n\nSimilar to her new abode, this home was also hidden behind a long driveway and security gate, to give the star the privacy she craves when away from the spotlight. Separated into four buildings, the home features a main house, a two-story guest home, a gym, and a guardhouse for security. Boasting a summery Mediterranean style, the property features a two-acre garden with a pool, cabana area, spa bath, and seating space that overlooks the spectacular views of Los Angeles and its surroundings.\n\nIn early 2019, Katy sold one of the 2 homes on the compound for $9.4M to famed restauranteur and founder of the celeb-loved Mr. Chow, Michael Chow.\n\nHow much is Katy Perry worth?\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Katy Perry’s net worth is between $330-$350 million. This money is made up of her music and tours, of course, but also in part thanks to her endorsement deals with the likes of Covergirl, Claire’s, and H&M. She is now also appearing on ABC’s reboot of “American Idol” as one of the expert judges. Her latest album “Witness” was released in June 2017 and she is currently in the middle of her tour.\n\nHow many times has Katy Perry been married?\n\nKaty Perry has been married once, and unfortunately, she has also been divorced once. Who was Katy Perry married to? She and bad boy comedian, actor, and activist Russell Brand married in 2010 only to divorce in 2012.\n\nBut fast-forward a few years, and now the pop princess is engaged to Hollywood hottie, Orlando Bloom! Her engagement ring is quite unique!\n\nWhy did Katy Perry and Russell Brand divorce?\n\nAfter marrying in October of 2010, Katy Perry and Russell Brand’s relationship didn’t last very long. They decided to part ways just 14 months later, in December 2011. Brand reportedly ended their marriage via text message, much to Katy, her family, and her fan’s despair.\n\nPerry spoke to Hollywood Reporter just after the divorce was finalized in 2012 and said she wouldn’t ever speak about what actually caused their marriage to end. “Nobody knows what really happened except the two people who are in it,” she told them.\n\nReports have mentioned, however, that the pair’s relationship was full of up and downs and a whole lot of turmoil. They even had a huge argument just before their actual wedding ceremony took place. Brand claims, however, that their individual busy schedules for work were what was tearing them apart the most.\n\nHe told Billboard, “The marriage didn’t last for a very long time, and I think that is to do with the undulating nature of fame.” He also claims that there are no hard feelings between the pair saying, “I still feel very warm towards her. I feel like when I hear about her or see her, ‘Aw there’s that person. There’s that person in the world.’ ”\n\nKaty’s movie “Part of Me” was an incredible display of her dedication to her craft. Because her relationship woes were taking place during filming, fans got an inside look into how difficult it was for her.\n\nWhat makeup does Katy Perry use?\n\nKaty Perry is super down to earth, and she has certainly proved this in her choice of everyday makeup. She is known to love wearing drugstore makeup, rather than fancy and expensive brands. Her makeup artist Todd Delano actually uses pretty much the same.\n\nWhen asked about Katy’s ‘best’ look, he told Allure, “I make sure her skin is clean and hydrated before I begin, and I almost always prep her skin with a primer. As for foundation, right now I’m loving CoverGirl Ready Set Gorgeous Foundation for Katy, because it’s oil-free and actually pulls oil and sweat away from your face rather than trapping it under your foundation. It’s genius for high-energy performances. Oh, and of course, I always set her foundation with powder no matter what. I think Katy is at her best when she keeps it fresh and natural: dewy skin, defined brows, mascara, and lip gloss.”\n\nOf course, she’s a spokesperson for Covergirl makeup, as she even has her own line with the cosmetic brand. She wore a face made up from entirely Covergirl makeup to the 2017 Grammy Awards. The Katy Kat Pearl Collection includes a highlighter, eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick, and she says her collection was inspired by mermaids and ‘pearlescent vibes’.\n\nHow tall is Katy Perry?\n\nKaty Perry stands at a pretty average 5′ 6” tall.\n\nDid Katy Perry get a breast implant?\n\nThe rumor mill has been extra-busy recently with the idea that Katy Perry has had a boob job. But is it true? She has been the focus of speculation about her alleged surgery for a while now, but in January 2018 she finally spoke out about the issue. She told Daily Star, “I’ve done lasers and had [filler] injections under my eyes for the hallowing – which I’d recommend to everyone who wants a solution for their dark circles. But all of my assets are real. People tend to think they’re fake, but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nIs Katy Perry left handed?\n\nYep, she’s a leftie alright!\n\nKaty Perry Music\n\nWhen was Part Of Me by Katy Perry released?\n\nKaty Perry’s song ‘Part Of Me’ is one of the top three records on her ‘Teenage Dream: The Complete Conception’ album. It was also the first single on the album and was released in 2012. Reports say that the song was originally leaked two years prior, but Perry had tweaked the lyrics before it’s official release in 2012.\n\nWhat is TGIF Katy Perry?\n\nTGIF stands for Thank God It’s Friday and is part of the song title ‘Last Friday Night (TGIF)’ that was released in 2010. The record is one of the singles on Perry’s ‘Teenage Dream’ album. That particular album is actually the second album in history to have five number-one singles, following Michael Jackson’s ‘Bad’.\n\nWhen will Katy Perry tour?\n\nKaty Perry is currently performing shows throughout Oct 2022 at The Theatre at Resorts World Las Vegas! So, if you’re looking to see the pop sensation on stage, get your tickets while you can!\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/profile/katy-perry/\n\nhttp://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/katy-perry-russell-brand-divorce\n\nhttps://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7744671/russell-brand-katy-perry-divorce-video-interview\n\nhttps://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Who-Has-Katy-Perry-Dated-43253259\n\nhttps://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/674683/last-friday-night-katy-perry-age-boob-job-plastic-surgery-rumours\n\nhttps://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8260911/50-cent-trey-songz-domestic-violence-allegations\n\nhttp://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25330\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-biggest-songs-of-the-summer-the-2010s-so-far-20140806/katy-perry-last-friday-night-t-g-i-f-20140806\n\nhttp://www.capitalfm.com/artists/katy-perry/news/2017-2018-world-tour-dates-tickets/\n\nhttps://www.katyperry.com/tour/\n\nhttps://www.allure.com/story/katy-perry-makeup-artist-todd-delano\n\nhttps://www.teenvogue.com/story/katy-perry-grammys-makeup-drugstore-how-to\n\nhttp://variety.com/2017/dirt/real-estalker/katy-perry-beverly-hills-house-1202031000/\n\nhttps://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/151032/katy-perry-beverly-hills-mansion-photos\n\nhttps://www.hellomagazine.com/travel/gallery/2017100242853/katy-perry-selling-hollywood-hills-home\n\nhttps://www.ticketmaster.com/katy-perry-tickets/artist/1265325\n\nhttps://variety.com/2022/music/news/katy-perry-on-conquering-las-vegas-with-a-show-that-combines-pee-wees-playhouse-with-what-would-liza-do-1235191002/"
