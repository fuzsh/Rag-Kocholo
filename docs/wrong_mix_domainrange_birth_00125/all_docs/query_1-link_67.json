        "text": "Katy Perry might return to American Idol, even though she said her goodbyes this weekend after being one of the singing competition’s judges for seven years.\n\nThe 39-year-old pop star ended her reign during Sunday’s (May 19) finale, which was filled with tearful goodbyes with her fellow judges. Following the live show, Perry told ET that she was a “little tired” because she had been crying all night.\n\nAbi Carter was crowned the season 22 winner, and Perry said that was the “cherry on top” for the night since it’s been “a while” since a female won the competition. The last female winner was actually in season 18, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just Sam was crowned that year’s virtual winner. Before that was season 16’s Maddie Poppe. She noted that Abi was her “pick from the beginning.” Perry said that the win was “my present from the universe.”\n\nKaty Perry’s Goodbye To Idol\n\nOne of the hardest parts for Perry was saying goodbye to her fellow judges, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. Perry admitted that Richie simply telling her that he’d miss her was the first thing to set off the waterworks. But, in classic Katy Perry fashion, she made light of the situation and ordered pizza during the show, “and that helped,” she noted.\n\nShe shared the moment on social media, turning to the camera briefly to shrug, then threw the pepperoni slice into the crowd. The fans seemed confused, even though they tried catching the slice. Perry then playfully danced for the cameras.\n\nThe “Firework” singer found a way to honor her time on the show through her impeccable fashion. With a flair for the dramatics, Perry was suspended high off the ground, wearing a personalized skirt of the top 24 contestants from each season. She told ET in her interview that she found it a good way to “honor” her time there. “It was a fun surprise because I was raising up, and you just saw more and more contestants.”\n\nHer gold-plated top also featured seven roses, which she noted is obviously for the seven seasons she has served as a judge.\n\nKaty Perry Might Return To Idol\n\nAs for her hopes on who would replace her on the judges’ panel, Perry didn’t have a specific name in mind, but she did share her thoughts on what qualities she thinks they should have. “I hope it’s someone fearless. I hope it’s someone that doesn’t mince their words, maybe someone a little polarizing just like myself,” Perry said.\n\nNoting that people have criticized her for being a judge and saying things like, “‘She’s awful! She should go!’ And there’s a lot of people that are like, ‘She speaks her mind! She’s authentic!’ Whatever, you can’t win ’em all.” Able to take the heat, Perry says she prefers it better that way to be hated because “that means you actually have a point of view.”\n\nAs for the reaction to her exit, Perry felt like everyone acted as if she were dying. She admits she’s going on tour, and as we reported, she is leaving Idol after seven years to focus on her music. She has been teasing KP6, and though fans are highly anticipating her 6th studio album, she teased, “Keep that seat hot. I mean, who knows? I loved everything I got to experience and learn.”\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
