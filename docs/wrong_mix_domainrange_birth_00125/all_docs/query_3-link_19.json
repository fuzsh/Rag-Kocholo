        "text": "Background Information[]\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, California), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Known for her influence on modern pop music and her campy style, she has been referred to as the \"Queen of Camp\" by Vogue. Pursuing a career in gospel music at 16, Perry released her debut album, Katy Hudson, under Red Hill Records in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name \"Katy Perry\" from her mother's maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records.\n\nAppearances[]"
