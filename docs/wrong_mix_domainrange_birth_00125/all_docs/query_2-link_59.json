        "text": "Looks like Katy Perry is back in the Los Angeles real estate game with a major purchase in Beverly Hills. TMZ reports that the pop star has agreed to pay close to $19 million in an off-market deal for the five-bedroom home.\n\nA little under 5,500 square feet in size, the home is located in a very well-guarded gated community in celebrity-filled Coldwater Canyon. Situated on over an acre of open space, it’s accessed by a quarter-mile long driveway and surrounded by lushly landscaped green space. Features include an infinity pool and multiple verandas and outdoor sitting spaces.\n\nAccording to Variety, the seller is Cody Leibel, son of Canadian developer Lorne Leibel (and apparently among the youngest Ferrari Enzo owners). Leibel appears to be in line for a decent profit on the sale, having purchased the home for a little over $9 million back in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, Perry is fresh from a very well-publicized legal battle with a group of elderly nuns over the right to purchase a former convent in Los Feliz—a fight which she seems to have won for now.\n\nThe singer also owns a pair of properties in the Hollywood Hills which she purchased for a total of $11.2 million in 2013."
