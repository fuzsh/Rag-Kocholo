        "text": "Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter and television personality.\n\nShe is known for her influence on modern pop music and her camp style, being dubbed the “Queen of Camp” by Vogue and Rolling Stone.\n\nAt 16, Perry released a gospel record titled Katy Hudson (2001) under Red Hill Records, which was commercially unsuccessful.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name “Katy Perry” from her mother’s maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records, but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records.\n\nRecently Katy Perry closed a music deal with Carlyle-backed label Litmus Music. The value of the deal is said to be $225 million. As a result of the deal, her net worth increased to approximately $340 million, making her one of the richest, self-made women in the Union State.\n\nThe agreement includes the copyrights of Perry’s Ace Records label, as well as the copyrights of her five albums released between 2008 and 2020. One Boy, Young Dream, PRISM”, Witness and Smile.\n\nBoth the Billboard and Variety confirm this information. Litmus Music, which was founded in 2022 by music industry veterans Hank Forsyth and Dan McCarroll and received a huge investment of $ 500 million from Carlyle Gather, was quick to purchase music.\n\nKaty Perry’s Legacy\n\nIn previous deals, Litmus acquired the rights to feature Keith Urban’s song “Admirable” and in June acquired the rights to music producer Benny Bianco’s hit song, which features songs by Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Camila Cabello.\n\nThis change is one of the most important music trends of 2023. Rapper Dr. Dre is said to have sold most of his personal collection, his contract with NWA, and other sources of income from music for a total of over $200 million.\n\nAdditionally, Bieber decided to share the rights and management of Ace records for the same amount in the same month.\n\nAlthough Katy Perry is 38 years old, she failed to enter the Forbes list. The 2023 rankings of self-made women in America were announced in June. However, there is no doubt that this list will have a strong rival in the coming years.\n\nAt the time of list evaluation, his fortune was estimated at less than $200 million (his 2023 list has a bottom line of $225 million), mainly due to profits from interviews, recordings, and being a judge for American Idol. ). As her results spread widely, she joined other female artists such as Rihanna, Taylor Quick, Madonna, Beyoncé, Celine Dion, Dolly Parton and Barbra Streisand.\n\nPerry stepped into music in 2008 by presenting her single “I Kissed A Girl” to great fans. The song quickly reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for seven weeks. Perry was awarded first place at the event.\n\nShe went through a remarkable transformation and became the third highest-earning woman of the year. Its latest earnings reached $135 million; That’s more than Taylor Quick, Rihanna, and Miley Cyrus combined during the same period.\n\nShe also gave a good performance at the Super Bowl halftime show that same year.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore:"
