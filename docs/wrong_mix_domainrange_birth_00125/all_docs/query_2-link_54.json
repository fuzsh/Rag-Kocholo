The couple, who welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove, in August, purchased a palatial compound in Montecito.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

The living room is outfitted with wide plank wood floors and a fireplace, with multiple sets of French doors that lead outside.\n\nThere’s a family room with another fireplace, built-in bookshelves and a bar, in addition to a separate office with dark wood accents.\n\nThe kitchen is fitted with a center island and sage green cabinetry, with a full breakfast area. It’s open to a family room, which in turn provides direct access to a dining patio with a built-in barbecue. There’s also a separate, more formal dining room inside.\n\nThe owner’s suite is situated on the second floor, with a fireplace, terrace, dressing room, walk-in closet and two bathrooms.\n\nOutside, there’s a pool with patterned tile details, a cabana and plenty of entertaining and seating areas. There’s also a full tennis court.\n\nThe actor and the pop star are planning on using the home as their primary residence, reports People. Perry is a Santa Barbara native, and “loved” growing up there. According to the outlet, the duo were scoping out homes in the area for a while, and “agree that raising their little girl in Montecito will be amazing.” Perhaps this is why Perry recently listed her spare Beverly Hills home for sale, though it appears that the couple are hanging onto their larger Los Angeles estate, also in Beverly Hills."
