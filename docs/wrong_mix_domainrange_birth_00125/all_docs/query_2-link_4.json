        "text": "Looks like Katy Perry is in hot water again over real estate — several years after she sparred with two nuns over an 8-acre Los Feliz, California spread.\n\nThe “Dark Horse” singer and her fiancé, Orlando Bloom, have been involved in a three-year legal suit over the Montecito, California mansion they purchased back in 2021 for $14.2 million.\n\nLocated at 1569 E. Valley Rd., the Daily Mail revealed that 83-year-old Carl Westcott had moved into the home just two months before Perry, 38, and Bloom, 46, bought the 8.9 acre estate.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Post, Westcott claims that a July 14, 2020 contract for the sale of his home was done when he “lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature and probable consequences of the contract.”\n\nWestcott, who served in the US Army as a 101st Airborne service member, had purchased the home that May 29 with the intent to live in there “for the rest of his life,” court documents state.\n\nHe claimed that due to his age, poor health from Huntington’s disease (a deadly brain disorder), and “a major six-hour surgery less than a week before the proposed contract,” it had “seriously impaired [his] mental faculties to the point he was of unsound mind and not competent to give his free, voluntary, or intelligent consent to the contract.”\n\nAbout a week after the contract was signed, on July 22, 2020, Westcott said he started to “feel mentally clear again,” after the opiates from his surgery wore off — and sent a letter to the real estate agency representing the property.\n\n“Mr. Westcott sent an email to Berkshire Hathaway, in its capacity as the dual agent for seller and buyer,\n\nthat he did not want to sell his home.”\n\nIn response, Perry and Bloom wrote a letter to Westcott letting him know how much they loved the home and wanted to purchase the estate for more money than what he paid for it.\n\nWestcott said he “gave it his deepest consideration, but that he is in the final few years of his life and he cannot sell his home.”\n\nA lawyer for Perry and Bloom then advised him that the couple was not willing to walk away and is obligated to complete the sale.\n\nThe estate occupies over 9,200 square feet and boasts eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms.\n\nA trial over the matter is set for later this month.\n\nThe Post has reached out to reps for Westcott and Perry.\n\nMeanwhile, the case is reminiscent of the 2015 legal suit Perry was involved in with Catholic nuns known as the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary located in Los Feliz.\n\nFifty-two sisters had first purchased their structure back in 1972 and lived there until 2011 when just five sisters remained, and they were forced to relocate.\n\nBut the Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez insisted the medieval Spanish-Gothic-Tudor estate go to Katy Perry, who was willing to pay for the property in cash.\n\nIn 2016, a judge ruled against the nuns and Perry was granted the home."
