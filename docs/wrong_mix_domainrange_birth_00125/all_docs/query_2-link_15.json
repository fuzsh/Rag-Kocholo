        "text": "Last Friday night was a victorious one for Katy Perry. Following a lengthy legal battle over the rights to a Montecito estate, the pop star officially filed the deed for the contested California property on Friday, May 17, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe saga began in July 2020, when Perry and her partner, actor Orlando Bloom, were looking for a new home in the SoCal enclave to accommodate their growing family; at the time, the “Firework” singer was pregnant with their daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom. Perry’s business manager, Bernie Gudvi, made a $15 million offer on a home on her behalf (topping a competing offer from journalist and Kennedy scion Maria Shriver in the process). The estate’s owner, entrepreneur Carl Westcott, signed a contract accepting the off-market bid before attempting to rescind the sale a few days later. Perry and Westcott then sued each other for ownership of the property, which includes a pool and two guesthouses.\n\nWestcott claimed that he was not of sound mind when he signed the contract to sell the roughly two-acre estate, which he had bought just a few months earlier for $11.25 million, due to a battle with Huntington’s disease and the painkillers he was on following a recent back surgery. Perry’s team asserted that Westcott had simply changed his mind after failing to find another home in the competitive local market. Near the end of last year, the court sided with Perry, stating in their decision that “Wescott presented no persuasive evidence that he lacked capacity to enter into a real estate contract.”\n\nEven after nearly four years in court, the legal drama isn’t quite over yet; Perry has so far paid $9 million for the home. A second phase of the trial, scheduled for July, will determine any damages owed by Westcott, which could total up to $6 million, or the remaining balance owed by Perry.\n\nWestcott has since moved into a residential mental health facility, the WSJ reports. Perry and Bloom bought a nearby $14.2 million compound in October 2020. Time will tell if the Grammy-nominated musician will keep both of the properties."
