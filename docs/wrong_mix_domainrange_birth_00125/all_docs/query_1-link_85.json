        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAccording to the proposed statement of decision submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, Judge Joseph Lipner underscored his viewpoint on the breach-of-contract conflict. Lipner emphasized the importance of upholding the July 2020 agreement involving the property's owner, entrepreneur Carl Westcott, and Bernie Gudvi, who was acting as the buyer on behalf of Perry.\n\nA judge in Los Angeles ruled in favor of Katy Perry's purchase of a $15 million residence in Montecito, California, after the property owner attempted to cancel the sales agreement, citing being in an \"unsound mind\" when the contract was signed.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nWhat's in Sitharaman's Budget for you?\n\nAccording to a proposed statement of decision filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday on Wednesday, Judge Joseph Lipner provided his perspective on the breach-of-contract dispute. Lipner emphasized that the contract from July 2020, involving the home's owner, entrepreneur Carl Westcott, and Bernie Gudvi, who was buying the property on behalf of Perry, \"should be honored.\"\n\nWestcott \"presented no persuasive evidence that he lacked capacity to enter into a real estate contract,\" the judge wrote in his decision. \"Moreover, (Westcott) entered into other contracts shortly before and shortly after the contact at issue here. Westcott has not attempted to rescind any of these other contracts for lack of capacity.\"\n\nThe court's decision remains tentative and will be finalized after 10 days unless one of the parties takes action by submitting a document that addresses contested matters or proposes new terms not previously covered in the preliminary decision.\n\nKaty Perry had intended to reside in the house with her fiancé Orlando Bloom and their daughter Daisy Dove, who was born in August 2020.\n\nGudvi's claims for damages are set for a two-day trial in February, during which Katy Perry is expected to provide testimony.\n\nThe individual in question asserted that he was not in his right state of mind due to painkillers when he sold his Montecito property to Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom.\n\nThe agreement between Westcott and Gudvi in July 2020 stipulated the sale of the property for $15 million. However, four days later, Westcott attempted to retract the contract, as noted by Judge Lipner.\n\nFollowing this, two weeks later, Westcott filed a complaint to nullify the contract, to which Gudvi responded with a cross-complaint citing a breach of contract just two days after. The trial took place over seven days from September 27 to October 5, with closing arguments presented on November 3.\n\nAccording to the judge's filing on November 7, Westcott, who had purchased the property in May 2020, earned a profit of $3.75 million from the sale.\n\nIn Westcott's 2020 complaint, it was revealed that the business transaction occurred shortly after the entrepreneur underwent surgery. He purportedly received multiple medications for his recuperation, which allegedly resulted in an impaired state. He realized he \"had not been himself due to the combination of his age, frailty, Huntington’s disease, the six-hour surgery and especially the intoxicating effects of the opiate painkillers he had been taking several times each day,\" per his complaint.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings, Westcott's legal team presented testimony from a doctor specializing in geriatric psychiatry, who affirmed that the homeowner was experiencing cognitive impairment at the time of entering the contract. In his decision, the judge wrote that the court \"did not find his expert opinion of lack of capacity supported, credible or persuasive.\"\n\nAs per Westcott's complaint, subsequent to informing the buyers of his decision to reconsider the sale, he received a letter from Perry and Bloom expressing their keenness to acquire the property.Despite the pressure to sell, Westcott maintained his stance, citing his advanced age and positioning himself in the \"final few years of his life.\"\n\nAfter his firm refusal to proceed with the sale, Westcott reportedly received a letter from an attorney representing Gudvi, Perry, and Bloom, as indicated in Westcott's lawsuit. The letter communicated that Perry and Bloom were unwilling to withdraw from the purchase of Westcott's property and insisted that he was obligated to fulfill the sale.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
