From his complex and unpopular monetary reform, which included denominations of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 50, 500 and 1,000 Zhu. These coins were largely similar in weight and appearance, and were difficult to use. It also explains why so many people hoarded earlier currency to use rather than the current official token coinage.
