        "text": "Obverse and reverse signify the two flat sides of a coin, also seen with paper money. They offer an assorted variety of images and inscriptions to represent a specific person or significance. Most people donâ€™t completely understand the meaning and intentions of the two faces of coins, especially Roman coins, but through the study of coins, one can identify that there are intentional differences between the two. The understanding and use of legends allow us to be able to broaden our knowledge and interpretations of coins.\n\nLooking at inscriptions, coins that display a portrait are typically show a visual of the emperor so that he gets widespread recognition, while not specifically realistic (Collective database- 2017). The portraits do not only show the present emperor but they also show his authority. The inclusion of crowns, which you will see in some of the coins on this page, was used as a way to show recognition from battle. Looking at coins without portraits, they were typically to show respect to a family member or the founding of a new city.\n\nNumismatics and the study of coins are very important because it gives insight to not only to specific coins but also history. Studying coins allows us to understand inscriptions on coins, acting like captions to the images on them. Without being able to go from the Latin abbreviation to the translation, it is very difficult to be able to understand it, and, thus, it would be harder to be able to learn about the visuals on the coin. Analyzing coins is such a key part in dating coins. If we can understand who the individual on the coin is, after identification from the inscriptions, we can get an idea of when this coin might be dated form, based on the historical context. For this reason, it is very common to see the dating of a coin to be the years that the emperor, who is on the coin, was in power; we can see this in Coin 055 from the Burkhart Collection. Studying coins is not just studying what is on the coin, but it is also studying what the coin is made out of. With the knowledge of the material of the coin, we can learn a lot about Roman history. It provides us with insight about their available resources and even the materials' value in their eyes. Overall, it is important to study coins because we learn about the relationship between Romans and their coinage and get historical insight about the life of Romans. Because there are such limitations on primary sources, it is important to use coins as evidence to gain insight about Roman economics, history, value and beliefs, and materials"
