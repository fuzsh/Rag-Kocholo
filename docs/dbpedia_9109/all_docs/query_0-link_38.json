        "text": "The Ming coins were usually attractive and carefully cast - they were cast in various denominations, and many large and attractive Ming coins remain among the most popular collectible Chinese coins.\n\nThe Ming Dynasty or Empire of the Great Ming , was the ruling dynasty of China from 1368 to 1644, following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty. The Ming, one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history, was the last dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Hans. Ming rule saw the construction of a vast navy and a standing army of one million troops. The Ming dynasty is often regarded as both a high point in Chinese civilization as well as a dynasty in which early signs of capitalism emerged. Although the Ming capital Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng, which was itself soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty, regimes loyal to the Ming throne (collectively called the Southern Ming) survived until 1662."
