        "text": "Sri Lanka is a country with a long history and a similarly long and rich economic history. A study of that history will doubtlessly prove fruitful not only for economists but for everyone in the society. Coins used through different time periods of a country play an important role when studying the history of that country. Although small in size, a coin has the ability of giving a wealth of information about the economic and cultural history of the country where it was used, through signs that remain on them.\n\nWhy does Sri Lanka appear Magnified on Ptolemy’s world MAP ?\n\nExtract of the world map by Ptolemy\n\nThe image depicted here is an extract from the world map by Ptolemy who lived in 150 A.D in Rome.The map is drawn to considerably precise longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates. However, despite his accurate depiction of the Mediterranean, Europe and the Middle Eastern regions on the map; Sri Lanka appears significantly over-sized. This is no coincidence. It illustrates the recognition Sri Lanka had in the eyes of the world before and during Ptolemy’s time. Although it is small in length and width, the world as a whole considered Sri Lanka to be of great worth.\n\nIn the past, Sri Lanka managed to garner the attention of the world partly due to the fact that it was uniquely placed at the center of the Silk Road that spanned from Far East Asia to Europe. It was also a doorway to entering the Overland Silk Road. Traders and explorers from the East and West would converge on this island. Sri Lanka functioned as a trading center for these travelers. There are Greek, Roman and Chinese texts that include a multitude of information that serve as testament to this.\n\nThese facts reveal the Economic history of Sri Lanka. Upon close inspection of the great irrigation projects of those times, it becomes clear that the disciplines of engineering and agriculture were highly developed in Sri Lanka. The island also had an efficient trading system in place.\n\nInformation detailing these endeavors can be found in epigraphs, ‘Vansha Katha’ (Chronicles of Dynasties), ancient texts and letters as well as in archeological evidence. Coins and epigraphs have a special place among this evidence. Being primary pieces of evidence regarding the economic history of Sri Lanka, these coins and epigraphs can be found in large numbers scattered across the island. Aside from local sources, afore mentioned records by international traders and foreigners also provide information about the trade mechanisms of Sri Lanka’s past. This information is extremely advantageous in the attempt to construct a timeline for the history of Sri Lanka’s economy.\n\nSri Lanka’s currency-use can be divided into following periods.\n\nAnuradhapura Era\n\nPolonnaruwa to Kotte Era\n\nKandy Era\n\nColonial Era\n\nPost-Independence Period since Establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon\n\nAnuradhapura Era\n\nCoins used in Anuradhapura Era\n\nKahapana\n\nSwastika coins\n\nManeless Lion coins\n\nLakshmi Plaques\n\nKahavanu or Lankeshvara coin\n\nForeign Coins\n\nAnuradhapura Kingdom (377 BC– 1017AD)\n\nThe Anuradhapura Kingdom named for its capital city, was the first established kingdom in ancient Sri Lanka. Founded by King Pandukabhaya in 377 BC. Epigraphs reveal a multitude of Information about trade and currency use during the Anuradhapura era. These records suggest that the production and distribution of coins were done systematically. At the time, the director in charge of coin production was known as “Rupadaka” (Periyakada Vihara Epigraph). The official who authorized the produced coins was known as “Rupawaapara”. (Kaduru Wewa Epigraph)\n\nSource: Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau\n\nAccordingly, the coins authorized by the King carried the Royal stamp. When these coins passed from one to another, various unique markings were added by each owner. As a result, these coins bear a multitude of different symbols. One particular coin contains 20 such markings which include the sun, the moon, a tusker, a dog, and a tree. It has been determined that over 500 unique markings were used on the ‘Kahapana’ coins. It is believed that these coins were initially produced in India and not in Sri Lanka. Due to international trade, these coins reached Sri Lanka via Indian vendors. Consequently, based on these coins, Sri Lanka produced its own ‘Kahapana’.\n\nThe ‘Kahapana’ had been in use in Sri Lanka from 3rd century B.C. to 1st century A.D. Anuradhapura, Tholuwila, Wessagiriya, Sigiriya, Bunnapola, Dedigama, Minuwangoda, Udawalawe, Ambalangoda, Tissamaharama, Vallipuram, Kantharodai, Jaffna, Mulativu, Maanthota, Padaviya, Trincomalee are some of the many places where this type of coins have been found.\n\nOn one side of the coin, there is an image of a walking tusker, a stupa drawn using three half moons, a swastika and a Bo tree with three branches inscribed in a square. On the flipside, there is a swastika, a trident and a stupa. However, when considering the coin as a unit of currency, it is probable that it was in the same category as a ‘Kahapana’.\n\nOn the coin face, the goddess Lakshmi is standing on a lotus flower grasping two lotus stems that are protruding from either side of the flower. The stems, which reach her shoulders, each carry a blossomed lotus flower upon which stands a tusker holding a clay water vase. The image depicts the goddess bathing in the water pouring out of the vases held by the two tuskers. In some versions of this coin, goddess Lakshmi is shown seated on a lotus flower.\n\nThe Lakshmi coins have been found is such places as Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Wallipuram and Thirukethiswaram as well as Kantharoda, Mannar, Mulativu, Chilaw and Thissamaharama.\n\nArabic Coins\n\nThese coins are minted using metals such as copper and silver. On the face, there are devotional phrases in Arabic. The year of issue is inscribed on the flipside.\n\nPolonnaruwa to Kotte Era\n\nCoins used in Polonnaruwa to Kotte Era\n\nMassa Coins\n\nDambadeni Coins / Coins of the Middle Ages\n\nLion Coins\n\nCetu Coins\n\nPolonnaruwa Kingdom (1017 A.D.–1057 A.D.)\n\nThe period covers the kingdoms of Polonnaruwa 1017-1070, 1070-1232, Dambadeniya 1232 – 1272, Yapahuwa 1272-1293, Kurunegala 1293-1340, Gampola 1341- 1374 and Kotte (Sithavaka 1521-1593) 1372-1597. Kings of Chola dynasty that ruled from 1017 – 1070 A.D, issued a “Kahawanu” that was similar to a “Kahawanu” that was minted in the last half of the Anuradhapura era. It was made of copper. A unique characteristic of these coins was that each one bore the name of the king in power at the time of its production. This was the first coin produced in the country that bore the name of the ruler.\n\nSource: Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau\n\nKandy Era\n\nCoins used in Kandy Era\n\nAngutu Massa/Koku Coins/ Laarin\n\nDambadeni kasi\n\nSalli\n\nIndian ‘Waragama’\n\nTuttu\n\nPanama\n\nTangama\n\nKandyan Kingdom (1474 A.D. – 1815 A.D.)\n\nKandy was the last capital of the Sinhala monarchy. Kandyan Kingdom which was founded about 1474, remained an independent kingdom until the “Hill Country Agreement” dated March 2nd, 1815 was signed transferring Sri Lanka’s autonomy to the British. The Portuguese and Dutch established in the maritime areas in the 16th – 18th Centuries i.e. during Kandyan era. According to historical texts, a few different types of currency were in use during in the heyday of the Hill Country Kingdom also known as “Sinhale”.\n\nColonial Era\n\nEven though we divided Sri Lanka’s past into eras such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy; in all those eras, the entirety of Sri Lanka was never governed by one King. In different instances, the island was invaded by foreign powers. However, until the Kotte Era, the only invaders were the Chola. Despite such instabilities, we were able to make profits through international trade (via the Silk Road), win praise and maintain our splendid international reputation. But in 1453 A.D, the situation changed as a consequence of the fall of Constantinople (Capital of the Byzantine Empire). Europeans began to seek a route to the East over the great ocean. Eventually, the Europeans were victorious in the East and the West. As a result, Sri Lanka was colonized by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English respectively.\n\nCoins used in Portuguese Period\n\nSaint type coins (St. Thome) - Gold Tanga Malakka - Silver Cruzado Ginimassa - Silver Cakram Panam (Gold/Silver) Laarins Gold Pagodi\n\nPortuguese Period (1505–1658)\n\nIn 1505, the Governor and Viceroy of the Portuguese State of India was Don Francisco de Almeida. His son was Lorenzo de Almeida. He was in the process of attacking and thieving Muslim ships. The common belief is that Lorenzo de Almeida and his team were caught in a storm while pursuing a group of Muslim ships and were consequently washed ashore somewhere near Galle, Sri Lanka. But it is hard to believe that the avaricious Portuguese of that time turned their attentive eye towards the prosperous trade center that was Sri Lanka only after such a coincidental happening. The Portuguese took control of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka in 1505 A.D. and then from 1506 – 1658 a few different types of coins were minted and circulated.\n\nCoins used in Dutch Period\n\nRix Dollar Duits Coins from Zeeland Hollandaise coins Coins from Utrecht Coins from West freaseland Coins from Guilderland Stuivers\n\nDutch Period (1658–1796)\n\nIn 1658 A.D, the Dutch drove out the Portuguese and took control of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. First Batticaloa (in 1638), then Galle (in 1640), Colombo (in 1656) and finally Jaffna (1658) came under Dutch control. In 1638, after they acquired the Portuguese Fort, the Dutch made a treaty with King Rajasingha II (1635-1687). Section 14 of the treaty contains a multitude of rules regarding the use of money. According to the agreement, unless sanctioned by the King or the Dutch government, the acts of printing, producing publicizing, minting counterfeit coins or circulation was deemed illegal.\n\nDucatoon\n\nBathavian Mintage\n\nCeylon Stuivers - 1\n\nCeylon Stuivers - 2\n\nCeylon Stuivers - 3\n\nCoins used in British Period\n\nTharaka Pagodi Farthing British Stuiver Fanams Rix Dollar (Silver coin - 1825) Half Rupee Rupee (Indian Rupee) Quarter Rupee Duits\n\nBritish Period (1796–1948)\n\nThe French revolution resulted in a major shake-up among the European powers and in 1796 the Dutch were easily supplanted by the British, who in 1815 also won the control of the kingdom of Kandy, becoming the first European power to rule the whole island. But in 1802, Sri Lanka became a Crown Colony and in 1818 a unified administration for the island was set up.\n\nThere are two types of coins the English used for transactions in Sri Lanka. The first was a gold coin minted in Madras known as ‘Tharaka Pagodi’ or the Star Pagodi. One Star Pagodi was the equivalent of 45 Panam or 180 Thuttu. The second type of coin was a Copper one. They were minted in England in 1794 and 1797. It was equivalent to 1/96 (gold coin) and 1/48 (copper coin) of a Rupee. ‘United East India Company’ was printed on one side with the year it was issued. The Royal Coat of Arms and the value of the coin could be seen on the other side of the coin.\n\nLike the Dutch, the English also issued banknotes in addition to coins. The first series was issued in 1800. Up until 1801, monetary quantities were recorded in English publications using the Star Pagodhi system. But this method changed after the areas under British control came under the Chief Secretary in charge of Colonial Regions. From then on, Pathaga, Panam and Thuttu were used in recording monetary quantities. Thus the ¼ Pagodhi became equivalent to 1 Pathaga. (1/4 Pagodhi=1 Pathaga)\n\nFrom 1808 to 1818, ½, 1 and 2 Pathaga (silver) were minted occasionally and their values appeared on the coins as 24, 48 and 96 respectively. In 1803-1817, the copper coins Panam, Thuttu and Thuttu Deka (two Thuttu) were issued as well.\n\nDuring the British period, notes were issued by three authorities:\n\n1. Notes Issued by the General Treasury (1827 – 1855) - Pound Notes\n\nOne pound\n\nTwo pounds\n\nFive pounds\n\n2.

The Board of Commissioners issued subsidiary notes for the values of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents and 1 rupee. Of these notes, the 5 cents carried imprints of postage stamps of 2 cents and 3 cents.\n\nIn addition to these subsidiary notes, the Board of Commissioners issued notes worth 1 rupee, 2 rupees, 5 rupees, 10 rupees, 50 rupees, 100 rupees, 500 rupees, 1,000 rupees and 10,000 rupees.

The Monetary Law Act provided for establishment of a Monetary Board to administer, among other functions of the CBSL, the issue of currency, which included both notes and coins.\n\nCoins issued by the Central Bank of Ceylon\n\nThe notes issued by the British were used in Ceylon up to 1951 and the coins were used up to 1963. The first Sri Lankan coin series was introduced in 1963. The Emblem of Ceylon was introduced in the obverse of this coin series. This series consisted of coins in the denominations of:\n\nOne cent (Aluminium) Two cents (Aluminium) Five cents (Brass) Ten cents (Brass) Twenty-five cents (Copper / Nickel) Fifty cents (Copper / Nickel) One rupee (Copper / Nickel)\n\nRupees 5 (Nickel / Brass) and Rupees 2 (Copper / Nickel) circulation coins were introduced in 1984 instead of the five rupee and two-rupee notes.\n\nIn 2005, the Central Bank issued a new series of circulation coins of Rs.5 and Rs.2 by changing their weight and alloy, while Re. 1, Cts.50 and Cts.25 coins were issued by changing the size, alloy, weight and colour.\n\nA new 10 Rupees circulation coin was introduced to the existing coin series in 2009. The coins were made of Nickel Plated Steel with the shape of 11 lobed.\n\nIn 2016, the metal of 1 Rupee and 5 Rupees coins were changed to Stainless Steel from Brass Plated Steel, considering the long lifespan and lower cost. Additionally, the Edge Letterings were removed in the 5 Rupees coin to reduce costs further.\n\nIn 2017, a new series of circulation coins was introduced with face value of Rs.10, Rs.5, Rs.2 and Re.1 (Stainless Steel – AISI 430) with objectives of reducing the cost of coins minting, increasing the durability of coins, giving more portability, and identifying easily by visually impaired people. Accordingly, the size, weight, shape, edge, and design of all four coins were changed, reflecting a progressive pattern of diameter and thickness. These new coins are circulating along with the previous issued coins.\n\nEleven series of currency notes issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka since 1950 are as follows;"
