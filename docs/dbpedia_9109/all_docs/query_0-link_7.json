        "text": "May 25, 2016 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nSee also silver ingots during the Qing period\n\nSilver ingots (yinding éé , yinkuai éå¡, yinliang éå ©) were one of the common currencies in imperial China. Since the Han period æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE) they served as a means of payment, but were not very widespread in contrast to the standard type of money, copper cash. Since about 1100, the use of silver as a means of payment and storage of money became more widespread, but it was until the late 19th century never controlled by any government institution, even if tax payments in silver were accepted. Moreover, and the silver liang å © (tael, see weights and measures) was the official unit of account in late imperial times.\n\nDuring the Yuan period å  (1279-1368) silver even overshadowed copper cash as the prevalent currency. Yet even then, paper money was still denominated in copper cash, not in silver ingots. While copper cash had fix denominations (five zhu é, later 1 wen æ), silver ingots were valued according to weight and purity, and there thus known as yinliang éå © \"silver tael\" in late imperial times, tael/liang being a unit of weight.\n\nIn 1375 Emperor Taizu æå¤ªç¥ (r. 1368-1398) of the Ming dynasty æ (1368-1644) tried to replace silver by paper notes denominated both in copper cash and silver tael, but the inflatory value of the notes caused the abolishment of paper money in the early 15th century, and silver became the common means of payment for taxes and larger sums, while copper cash was used for daily transactions on the market â both constituting a bimetallic currency system. During the whole Ming period silver ingots or silver crumbs remained the major means of payment. In 1570, for instance, more than 90 per cent of market transactions were carried out in silver, and data from 1581 show that just one per cent of taxes were paid in copper cash.\n\nThe purchasing power of silver during the Ming period was much higher than in earlier ages. One dan ç³ (a volume measure) of rice, for instance, had cost 1.84 tael/liang during the Song å® (960-1279) and Yuan periods, but 0.94 during the Ming; a bolt of silk was sold at 1.57 tael/liang during the Song and Yuan, and for 0.6 during the Ming period.\n\nSilver ingots were cast in the shape of small \"boats\" called baoyuan å å¯¶ or baoyin å¯¶é. Still today, this shape is used as a symbol for wealth and prosperity, and seen in New Year's prints, as well as used for lavish wedding gifts of precious metals. Other shapes of ingots were bars, weights (ma ç¢¼, for easier testing the weight), horse hooves (mati é¦¬è¹) or \"crumb silver\" (suiyin ç¢é). Ingots were cast in different sizes (dading å¤§é , zhongding ä¸­é , xiaoding å°é ), the largest weighing no less than 50 liang (c. 1,850g). They were inscribed with the name of the producer, the weight and the place of origin, and bore at least one chop of an assayer, in many cases several.\n\nThe exact shape, size and weight of the silver ingots differed from region to region, just as did the exact weight. The official kuping tael åº«å¹³ of the Ministry of Revenue (hubu æ¶é¨) was the standard weight, but the tael on the markets of Beijing differed from that weight, not to speak of the markets in the many provinces. The same was true for the fineness of the silver. Those of standard fineness were called wenyin ç´é, zuyin è¶³é or zuwen è¶³ç´. The purity of standard silver taels was .935374. If it was not reached, a discount (shenshui ç³æ°´ or shengshui åæ°´) was necessary.\n\nEven the designations for silver ingots differed from province to province. In Zhejiang and Jiangsu they were called yuansi yin å çµ²é, in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi yansan yin é¹½æé, in Shanxi xicaoyin è¥¿éªé or shuisi yin æ°´çµ²é, in Sichuan tucao yin åéªé, liucao yin æ³éªé or huixiang yin è´é¦é, in Shaanxi and Gansu yuancao yin å éªé, in Guangxi beiliu yin åæµé, and in Yunnan and Guizhou shicao yin ç³éªé and chahua yin è¶è±é. Other names were qingsi éçµ², baisi ç½çµ², danqing å®å¾, shuangqing éå¾, fangcao æ¹éª or changcao é·éª. In the trade port of Canton (Guangzhou å»£å·) they were called xisi ç´°çµ², or sai-si the local tongue, a word spelled \"sycee\" by Western merchants.\n\nThe Qing dynasty æ¸ (1644-1911) fixed the official exchange rate between silver and copper cash as 1 tael of silver to 1,000 pieces (wen) or 1 string (guan è²«, diao å) of copper cash. Yet because neither the weight and purity of silver ingots was really exact, nor was the weight and authenticity of copper cash, this exchange rate was permanently negotiated in different markets.\n\nWhen silver tael were used as a unit of account, the term \"virtual silver\" (xuyin èé) was used. In the ledgers of the Ministry of Revenue, the kuping tael was used as a unit of account, but in local account books, the Shanghai silver tael (guiyuan yin è¦å é), Hankou silver tael (yianglie yin æ´ä¾é) or Tianjin silver tael (xinghua/hanghua yin è¡åé) were common. Kuping as well as local standards emerged as popular silver units during the Xianfeng reign-period å¸è± (1851-1861). After the Second Ango-Chinese War (Convention of Peking 1860) the Customs tael (guanping yin éå¹³é) was widely used, or the grain tribute tael (caoping yin æ¼å¹³é, see tribute grain), which became the standard monetary unit for tax payment.\n\nMuch more easy to use were foreign silver dollars (yangyin æ´é) which poured into China from the 18th century on. They had a very reliable fineness and weight, and were willingly accepted on the Chinese markets. Qing China produced its own silver coins (yinyuan éå ) from 1882 on. In 1933, the Republican government demonetized the silver tael.\n\nSources:\n\nCong Hanxiang å¾ç¿°é¦, Hong Jiaguan æ´ªè­ç®¡ (1992). \"Yinding éé \", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Zhongguo lishi ä¸­åæ­·å² (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), Vol. 3, 1408.\n\nCai Maoshui è¡èæ°´ (1997). \"Wenyin ç´é\", in Men Kui éå·, Zhang Yanjin å¼µçç¾, ed.
