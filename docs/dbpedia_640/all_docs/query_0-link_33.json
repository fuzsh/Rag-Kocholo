Here is the link, and a number so you could access the meeting by telephone.\n\nTopic: Sausalito Historical Society Zoom Annual Meeting\n\nTime: May 13, 2021 07:30 PM Pacific Time (US and Canada)\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n\nhttps://zoom.us/j/8359682890\n\nMeeting ID: 835 968 2890\n\nDial by your location\n\n+1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n\n2021 Election and Ballot\n\nThe principal order of business will be to elect four members to serve two-year terms on the Board of Directors from July 2021 to June 2023. We are fortunate to have four well-known, very qualified candidates, all of whom are currently serving on the Board, and who have been nominated by unanimous vote of the Directors on April 15th.\n\nTami Bell\n\nTami grew up in Marin City where his parents settled soon after World War II. He attended Marin City and Sausalito Schools, then Tamalpais High and the College of Marin. He received a B.S. in History from Cal, and a law degree from Hastings School of Law in San Francisco.\n\nHis professional career has led Tami between positions relating to social justice, and education as a classroom teacher and administrator.\n\nIn 2017, when the Sausalito Historical Society led Sausalito’s civic celebration of 75th Anniversary of the creation of Marinship, Tami participated in several productions as Joseph James, a singer who became a welder, challenging work rules which discriminated against African Americans. With the support of the NAACP, the California Supreme Court sided with Mr. James in a landmark Civil Rights case. Mr. Bell is continuing his role as Joseph James as part of the SHS Schools Program.\n\nThe SHS Board of Directors selected Tami to fill a vacancy on the Board in March 2021, and now has nominated him for a full term.\n\nStanford Hughes\n\nRenowned architect Stanford Hughes is perhaps best known in Sausalito for his work on the renovation at Cavallo Point Lodge and his work on the Praca de Cascais in downtown Sausalito. Stanford earned his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Oregon and attended the Masters of Architecture program at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to establishing BraytonHughes Design Studios in 1989, he was Associate Partner and Director of the Interior Design Studio at Skidmore Owings and Merrill in San Francisco. In addition to his work on Cavallo Point, he has been project designer for many historic renovations including the Hotel Del Coronado, San Diego; the Palace Hotel, San Francisco; the Casa Palmero Spa, Pebble Beach; the Stanford University Green Library; and the Olympic Club Lakeside Clubhouse. He has taught design at numerous colleges and universities, including the University of California, Berkeley and the California College of Arts & Crafts (where he was Chairman of the Interior Architecture Department from 1991 to 1993). He was a member of SFMOMA's acquisitions committee for the Architecture and Design Department, and served on the advisory board for the University of California's Extension Program for Interior Design. He is a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects. Locally, you may have heard him speak at the Sausalito Woman’s Club on the work of Julia Morgan, California’s first woman architect and the designer of their clubhouse - where his wife is a member. Stanford says, “History is something you cannot design.” He shares his hands on experience and knowledge of historic architecture with our community by adding his skills and expertise to the resources the Society provides for people researching Sausalito’s historic buildings.\n\nRoberta Maloy\n\nRoberta has lived in Sausalito for 30 years, and Marin County for even more. She is a member of the Sausalito Woman’s Club and serves on the board of the nonprofit Richardson’s Bay Maritime Association. She worked on the celebrations for the Marinship 75th anniversary. Currently she is the SHS secretary. A California native, she was born in Berkeley, raised in Arcata, got her MA and BA from San Francisco State University, worked in telecommunications finance management, and as the personal assistant and office administrator for Michael Rex Architects. She loves to sing, particularly as a member of the Blenders, a vocal trio that entertains around the Bay Area. She always enjoys learning more about Sausalito’s history, and is pleased to be asked to serve on the SHS board for another 2-year term. She has enjoyed sharing the Society with the residents of our wonderful Sausalito and Marin County while serving as Secretary of the SHS.\n\nNick Roby\n\nAlthough I have lived most of my life in Sausalito, actually, I was born in Hong Kong while my father was working for Wells Fargo Bank. We returned to Sausalito when I was just six months old. I began my 'higher education' at the Sausalito Nursery School. I subsequently went to private schools in Marin & San Francisco. From five years old until I was ten or so, I spent my afternoons at the Bay Model Visitor Center while my mother worked on MARINSHIP 1942*1945, the museum exhibit about Sausalito's WWII shipyard. In high school, I volunteered at the kiosk downtown, which was just a damp wooden shed by the ferry landing at the time. After high school, I went to New York for college, C.W. Post, and then spent two years as a reporter for a local TV station. In the winter of 2004, during a blustery snowstorm, I asked myself, 'What am I doing here?' and moved back to Sausalito in April of that year. Since moving back, I have worked at Edelman Productions; KRON TV and subsequently for the past nine years have been at the Redwoods Retirement Community. My mother was on the SHS board 2004-2006 and throughout my entire life I have appreciated the role of the Society in the community. I think it is so important to know our heritage. It is an honor to serve on the Board in this wonderful community that I love so much!\n\nHOW TO VOTE\n\nYOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS THIS YEAR:\n\nYOU MAY VOTE BY EMAIL by replying to: info@sausalitohistoricalsociety.org (Clicking the link should generate an an email with the ballot .

She was widely known as the Editor of the Marin Scope, from the time she and her husband, Paul Anderson started the paper in 1972. We had been without a home-town paper since the demise of the Sausalito News in 1960. (Copies of both papers may be found online at the California Digital Newspaper Collection). The Andersons sold the Scope in 1998. Billie was a Director of the Sausalito Historical Society from 2003 to 2008, serving several years as Treasurer. For many years, she contributed articles to the Scope on behalf of the SHS.\n\nKim Huff, president of the Sausalito Woman’s Club wrote to their members that “Billie was a strong voice for the club as well as the Community. She joined the club in 1989 and went right to work serving the membership. She served on several committees during her time as a member, most notable Budget and Civics, she served as Treasurer for the SWC as well as on the Board and Chairwoman of the Scholarship Recognition Fund.”\n\nOn a personal note, representing the Little League, I wrote a column for the Scope for several years in the 1990s, working with Billie, Paul, Privette, and all of the staff. I had a wonderful time; their suggestions were always improvement.\n\nJerry Taylor\n\nA Look Back\n\nSpeaking of the Marin Scope, here is a story from May 6, 1975, in the early days of the Sausalito Historical Society:\n\nHistorical Society Starts to Catalogue Donations\n\nA comprehensive cataloguing of historical items given to the Sausalito Historical Society over the past few months will commence this Saturday. May 10, under the direction of Mrs. Robert (Francis) Shinn. Mrs. Shinn will carry on her work in the Society's new headquarters on the top floor of the Civic Center at 420 Litho Street. New donations can be brought to this location on Saturday, where they will be accepted for evaluation by the Society's board. All past donors will be sent an acknowledgement of their gifts.\n\nThe first item to be recorded in the Society's ledger of acquisitions will be a \"hand harpoon.\" circa 1860, which was discovered by 12-ycar-old Richard Frey in the backyard of his home on Princess Street. Richard made an impromptu presentation of the harpoon to Society Chairman Jack Tracy after dedication ceremonies of the new Civic Center on March 8. The Historical Society hopes other residents will follow this example.\n\nAnd you did. Here is a copy of the SHS Accessions Catalog, showing this harpoon as the first item accessed in 1975 (our first year), and the article which is quoted above as the second item in our collection:\n\nCatalog Report\n\nObject Id\n\nObject Name\n\nCatalog\n\nTitle\n\nDate\n\nDescription\n\n1975.1.1\n\nHarpoon\n\nObject\n\nSeal harpoon circa 1860s\n\n1860\n\nA hand-wrought fishing spear / seal harpoon from circa 1860s, found at Princess & Bulkley.\n\n1975.1.2\n\nClipping, Newspaper\n\nArchive\n\nHistorical Society Starts to Catalogue Donations\n\n1975\n\nA photocopy of an article from the Marin Scope sometime in May, 1975 about the Sausalito Historical Society starting to catalogue acquisitions. It includes a picture of Jack Tracy and 12-year-old Richard Frey, who found the fishing spear / seal harpoon in 1775.1.1.\n\nOur founder, Jack Tracy, with 12 year-old Richard Frey. Richard is holding the harpoon.\n\n(This photo accompanied the original article. In the article, Richard’s name was spelled incorrectly, as Fray.)\n\nRichard, who now lives in Windsor, contacted the SHS recently and spoke with Jerry Taylor. We in-tend to record an Oral History with him when conditions permit.\n\nAs for the harpoon, it is now displayed behind glass in the Ice House.\n\nThe Cazadero and the Model\n\n1902 introduced a new chapter in Sausalito’s history, as Mr. John Martin and associates purchased the pioneer North Pacific Coast Railroad. Over the next few years, the new North Shore Railroad:\n\nConstructed a new ferry terminal building in Sausalito;\n\nAdded a third rail so both narrow gauge and standard gauge trains could operate to Mill Valley and within most of Marin County;\n\nAdded a fourth rail to carry electric current to power local passenger trains; and\n\nFilled in “the Pond”, which became Depot Park, now known as Vina del Mar Park.\n\nAnd, most pertinent to the title of this article:\n\nPurchased the ferryboat Cazadero in 1903.\n\nThe Cazadero was built by the John W. Dickie Company of Alameda. She was a classic SF Bay ferryboat:\n\ndouble-ended\n\nSide Paddle Wheels\n\nWalking Beam Engine\n\n257’ in length, 1,682 gross tons\n\nLaunched with a striking list, later counteracted by adding concrete\n\nCapacity of 2,000 passengers\n\nShe joined a fleet of boats which shuttled between Sausalito and the San Francisco Ferry Building: Ukiah, Sausalito, Tiburon, and Tamalpais (#2). After 1907, they sailed under the banner of the Northwestern Pacific. In the 1920s the Eureka, Mendocino, Redwood Empire, and Santa Rosa replaced the older boats. The Cazadero lasted until the end of service, she was sold in 1941 and converted into a barge.\n\nAbove: Cazadero in Richardson’s Bay. Below: Close up of Cazadero’s Walking Beam which transferred motion from the Vertical Engine to the Paddle Wheels\n\nIn late December 2020, the Historical Society was contacted by Mr. Richard Aufort. He wanted to donate a model of the Cazadero, crafted by his father Rene Aufort. In Richard’s words, he wanted “to bring the Cazadero home to Sausalito”.\n\nAccepting the beautiful model on behalf of the Sausalito Historical Society are Secretary Roberta Maloy, and former Secretary, now head of Accessions, Sharon Seymour, flanking Richard Aufort.\n\nRichard came from his home in Oregon to visit his mother in the Bay Area, transporting the model and case in his car. We look forward to the re-opening of our facilities on the top floor of City Hall when you may enjoy this precious gift, in person.\n\nRene C Aufort was born in LaRochelle, France on Feb 9, 1927, and brought to San Francisco at the age of four by his parents, Harry and Fabienne. He spent his childhood in the Bayview and his adult years in the Sunset until 1962 when he moved with his family to Millbrae, Ca. Growing up in San Francisco he attended Balboa High School where he competed in long distance running. Rene joined the Navy after high school and served in the Pacific at the end of WWII, working as an electrician. He then pursued his love of art by studying oil painting at the SF Art Institute and was part of the Bay Area Figurative School.\n\nIn 1950 Rene joined the San Francisco Police Department from which he retired in 1976 as Captain of Northern Station. After retirement he and Rita opened a popular kitchenware and antique store, Renita's, in Millbrae which was in business for 15 years. Rene was an accomplished carpenter, woodworker, artist and boat model builder. He and Rita spent many years golfing and traveling the world together and with friends.\n\nHe had a calming nature, was modest about his successes and generous with both time and money to family and friends, always helpful and accepting of all people. He had a clever, dry sense of humor and will be remembered for his quick wit.\n\nRene Aufort passed away peacefully May 18th 2018, with his wife of 71 years, Rita, children Renee and Richard, daughter in law Fran and beloved dog Corky at his bedside.\n\n(Lightly edited from the San Francisco Chronicle, May 22 to May 27, 2018.)\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nTerms Ending 6/30/22\n\nPeter Bowes, Treasurer\n\nLauri Flynn\n\nNora Sawyer, Vice President\n\nJim Scriba\n\nSela Seleska\n\nJerry Taylor, President\n\nTerms Ending 6/30/21\n\nTami Bell\n\nStanford Hughes\n\nRoberta Maloy, Secretary\n\nNick Roby\n\nAmbassadors\n\nSandra Bushmaker\n\nAbbot Chambers\n\nLarry Clinton\n\nJohn Cox\n\nSusan Frank\n\nTom Hoover\n\nLeon Hunting\n\nSallie Hunting\n\nJan Keizer\n\nJames Meyer\n\nMichael Moyle\n\nVicki Nichols\n\nCarl Nolte\n\nMichael Rex\n\nBarbara Rycerski\n\nLinda Sempliner\n\nSharon Seymour\n\nDana Whitson\n\nThank you for being a member of the Sausalito Historical Society, and thanks for reading this far.

Let us know if you'd like membership materials mailed out to you.\n\nFor the Sausalito Historical Society,\n\nJerry Taylor\n\nThis year marks the 125th anniversary of the incorporation of Sausalito. That was a significant event in 1893, and like most events hereabouts, it wasn’t without controversy.\n\nSeveral prominent – and vociferous – citizens opposed the idea, concerned that they would be unduly taxed to pay for improvements to a newly-incorporated town.\n\nThe Sausalito News pointed out in its maiden issue (February 12, 1885) that Sausalito “has no local government, but the necessity of incorporating is becoming generally recognized and before long measures will be taken to this end.” Jas. H. Wilkins, editor and proprietor of the paper, made no bones about being a booster for Sausalito’s potential growth and development: “We hope that the News will do effective work in heralding the merits of Sausalito Township to the world, and that it will more than earn any compensation it may receive from its patrons.”\n\nHowever, the road to incorporation proved rocky. The matter was put to a vote in June 1888, but low voter turnout led to its defeat. By then, the Sausalito News was under the control of J.E. Slinkey and his editor, A.D. Bell. Slinkey had already established himself as a local mover and shaker. According to Sausalito historian Jack Tracy, “He had a hand in almost everything that happened in Sausalito in the 1880s, and his El Monte (Hotel) was a gathering place for political and social groups.” Slinkey and Bell expressed their disappointment with a gloomy report that began, “After the result of Saturday's election we may as well give up all thought of incorporating this town, for more than one reason. Some of our people, while they can grumble at bad government, do not recognize that it is not only their privilege but their highest duty to cast their vote at every election, whether it be municipal, state or national. The lukewarmness of the class that consider themselves so superior to their fellow creatures that it is almost beneath them to touch a ballot, are the bane, and may be the ruin of all government.”\n\nThe following year, a Citizens Meeting was held at the San Francisco Yacht Club to hear a report from the committee on incorporation. The News reported that committee members Major O. C. Miller (Owner of the Pines and one time president of the Sausalito Bay Land Company) and Dr. H. J. Crumpton (Postmaster, physician and surgeon) “reported verbally through J. W. Sperry, chairman of the committee, who said: ‘We have considered carefully this matter of incorporation, and while it is perfectly feasible, we believe it is impossible at the present time, owing to opposition from a number of residents on the hill and the Portuguese residents in the valley. The benefits to be derived from incorporation may be seen and more fully appreciated later on and those who are now against the measure may be then convinced of their error’.” Sperry was a prominent landowner who later became the first mayor of Sausalito.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a new committee was formed to consider the best means for improving Sausalito, either by incorporation or by forming a village improvement society and “the raising of funds by a pro rata levy on the property holders here.”\n\nWhile the debate dragged on, the Sausalito News continued toeditorialize in favor of the former choice. In January 1891, under new publisher Harry Elliot, the News declared: “Every vote for incorporation is a vote for improvement. Every step in the direction of improvement enhances the value of your property. Every vote for incorporation will assist in the equalization of taxation. Every vote for incorporation is a vote for a good sewer-age system. Every vote for incorporation means that Sausalito wants to become as clean, healthy and attractive a town as there is anywhere. Every vote for incorporation means the bettering of the condition of the masses. Every vote for incorporation is a squelcher on old-fogyism.”\n\nThe issue came up again in 1893, but opponents stacked the deck by bringing in outside agitators. At a meeting in July, the News reported, “a number of boys and nonresidents or electors of the district proposed to be incorporated, were present and took part in the ‘viva voce,’ voting. It would be well to appoint a sergeant-at-arms for future meetings and exclude all who have no interest in the proceedings. Also a list should be prepared, taken from the Great Register, of those electors who reside in the proposed town for even at the preferential election, should one he held, people may vote who have no right to do so. What is wanted is an expression of opinion by the people who will be affected by incorporation and not of outsiders.”\n\nSausalito’s controversy attracted attention as far away as the town of Wheatland, in Yuba County, where the local newspaper, The Four Corners, stated: “In Sausalito they are having big times over the question of incorporation. No town in the State perhaps has more codfish aristocrats than Sausalito, and they reside on the hill. They feel considerably elevated above the common people below, and these two factions have it hot and heavy as the election approaches.” Codfish Aristocracy was a disparaging term for the nouveau riche in 19th-century Boston, and in this case referred to hill dwellers and summer residents.\n\nJack Tracy was the man who started it all – almost accidentally. In 1974 the state requested a city-wide inventory of what Sausalito officials felt was historically important — mostly buildings. Tracy, the fourth-generation Californinan who was then in an electrical-appliance business with his brother, got involved in that project.\n\nAccording to a 1983 San Francisco Examiner profile, when the city moved its offices into the abandoned Central School in 1975, Tracy was asked to put together a historical display of whatever he could round up from various groups and individuals.\n\n“The whole affair was supposed to be short and routine,” reported the paper. “About 150 people, some band music and speech-making, and a brief glimpse at Tracy’s overnight collection of the town's past, and the party would be over.” However, the collection turned out to be much more complete and significant than anyone had imagined.\n\n\"We scrounged everything we could find in Sausalito,” Tracy recalled. “People had never seen so much of Sausalito's history at once. Hour after hour, the mayor would ask us to remain another hour.\n\n“The people walked through the historical exhibit and then they went home and started calling other people.\n\n\"We'd opened in the morning and didn't close until 6 o'clock that night. The people had never seen such a collection. That's what started it all.\"\n\nA short time later then-Mayor Evert Heynneman offered Tracy the top floor of City Hall. Tracy, who wasabout to retire, decided to form the Historical Society and started soliciting memberships. Heynneman later succeeded Tracy as head of the Society. The first new member was Edward Couderc, a moving company man. Couderc also owned the Ice House, which was located on Caledonia Street at the time.\n\nTracy also recalled his first contribution to the SHS archives. \"A boy, Richard Fray, came up to me and said, 'I think I have something you'd like,' and asked if I wanted it. It was an old rusted fishing spear the boy had found, and it remains on display and is recorded as the museum's first gift.\"\n\n(In fact, the spear is displayed in a glass case at the Ice House, which the SHS eventually acquired for $1).\n\nTracy was quickly joined by other volunteers as the little museum launched itself. By April, 1975, a full-on membership drive was announced in the MarinScope: “The need for a Sausalito Historical Society is more pressing today, when large and impersonal forces are working to obliterate our heritage, than in any previous period. A Society is being currently proposed that will be available to all former and present residents of Sausalito. Participation is the primary requisite for membership. The aims of the Society will be to recover, house and maintain what is left of Sausalito’s rich past. Several hundred historical items have already been pledged for display and maintenance by the Society -- Indian artifacts, maps, letters and photographs. Sufficient furniture and office equipment have been donated to launch the organization in its new headquarters on the top floor of the Civic Center.\n\n“Member dues will be used to meet the expenses of preserving the Society’s historical collection and to cover operational costs.”\n\nOne of the earliest members was Liz Robinson, who soon became the Society’s official archivist.\n\nIn an oral history recorded with one-time SHS board member Dorothy Gibson, Liz recalls meeting Tracy when he visited her and her husband, Babe Lamerdin, who was donating some photos of the fabled schooner Zaca\n\n“Jack was so enthusiastic and talked with such passion, Babe and I decided to help, so I started going down on Saturdays, accessioning teetering piles of fabulous photographs, documents, artifacts, newspapers. He’d worked out a very simple system based on a night course he’d taken on archival management and had some basic rules about how to do this. He approached it methodically, but it was about 100 years’ worth of work. When I saw what needed to be done, I just became a regular at the Society.\n\n“Jack was there all day every day. People had heard about the project and would drop in to talk and he was so interested in what they had to say. He had so much in his head, it was like a computer filing system where bits of information just clicked into place and he made connections and was fitting together all the parts of what people were telling him.\n\n“Jack was kind of rumpled looking, wore a white t-shirt with dark hair sort of flopped over his face. He smoked constantly and his desk was always heaped with cigarette butts which wasn’t good sense for a historical collection. He had the order of things in his head, but there was lots of stuff that needed attention.\n\n“He was always very welcoming when people came in and put them at ease so they wanted to talk and they’d have a little show and tell and he’d make some sort of connection. There was always a lot of activity and people coming in with wonderful stories.”\n\nThe first board meeting of the Sausalito Historical Society was held on October 1, 1975 in the Society’s new quarters on the top floor of City Hall. According to the hand-written minutes of that meeting, Director Jack Tracy was joined by board members Vera Clouette and Phil Frank, plus Marjorie and Ben Pulsifer. Fritz Warren was absent. Membership had already reached 80 individuals."
