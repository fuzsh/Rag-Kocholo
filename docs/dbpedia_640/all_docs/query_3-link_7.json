        "text": "This is a list of fighter aces in World War II from Germany. A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. It is relatively certain that 2,500 German fighter pilots attained ace status, having achieved at least five aerial victories.\n\nGerman day and night fighter pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories during World War II, over 25,000 British or American and over 45,000 Soviet aircraft. 103 German fighter pilots each shot down 100 or more enemy aircraft, for a total of approximately 15,400 victories. Approximately 360 German fighter pilots shot down from 40 to 99 enemy aircraft for a total of approximately 21,000 victories. Approximately 500 German fighter pilots shot down from 20 to 39 enemy aircraft for a total of approximately 15,000 victories. These achievements were honored with 453 German day fighter pilots and Zerstörer (destroyer) fighter pilots and 85 German night fighter pilots (including 14 crew members), for a total of 538 German fighter pilots, receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\n\nGerman losses, on the other hand, were very high as well. Roughly 12,000 German day fighter pilots were killed or are still missing in action, with a further 6,000 being wounded. The Zerstörer (destroyer) pilots suffered about 2,800 casualties, either killed or missing in action, plus another 900 wounded in action. German night fighter losses were also high, in the magnitude of 3,800 pilots or crew members killed or missing and 1,400 wounded. Hans-Ulrich Rudel was the most decorated flying ace in the Luftwaffe, primarily as a ground-attack bomber pilot with over 800 vehicles destroyed in addition to his victories over opposing aircraft.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Germany's highest-scoring pilots shot down many more aircraft than the most successful Allied pilots. During the first years of the war, German day fighter pilots tended to enjoy favourable tactical circumstances; for instance, during the Battle of Britain British pilots generally tried to attack the German bombers rather than the fighters protecting them. German combat tactics during this period also tended to be superior to those of the Allies, with formation leaders in particular often having a higher chance of success.\n\nFormal and informal Luftwaffe practices also contributed to the high numbers of victories achieved by some pilots. The normal practice in fighter units was for the highest-scoring pilot to lead formations, regardless of their rank, which placed them in the best position to shoot down Allied aircraft. The German pilots also typically conducted much more combat flying than their Allied equivalents: while the western Allied air forces frequently rested their fighter pilots or rotated them out of combat zones after a certain number of missions or flying hours, German pilots were required to fly until they became casualties.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the German archives made available to the public, including microfilm rolls of wartime records not seen since January 1945. They show that although the Luftwaffe generally did not accept a \"kill\" without a witness (in which instance it was considered only a probable and didn't count in the victory scoring process), some pilots habitually submitted unwitnessed claims and these sometimes made it through the verification process, particularly if they were made by pilots with established records. Unlike all of the other air forces that fought during World War II, the Luftwaffe did not accept shared claims, but sometimes it happened. Each claim should have referred to a particular aircraft, but some victories were awarded to other pilots who had claimed the destruction of the same aircraft. From mid-year 1943 through 1944, the OKW communiques often overstated Allied bomber losses by a factor of up to two; these claims existed only in the communiques and weren't used in victory scoring. Defenders of the German fighter pilots maintain that overclaims were eliminated during the confirmation process, but the microfilms show that this wasn't always the case. Stringent reviews and comparisons of Allied archives and German archives show that 90 percent of the claims submitted were confirmed, or found to be \"in order\" for confirmation, up to the time the system broke down altogether in 1945.\n\nBy surname: A–F • G–L • M–P • Q–S • T–Z\n\nAccording to Obermaier, 103 Luftwaffe pilots were credited with more than 100 aerial victories. Mathews and Foreman, authors of Luftwaffe Aces – Biographies and Victory Claims, researched the German Federal Archives and list 94 Luftwaffe pilots in this category. The authors differentiate between confirmed and unconfirmed claims. In consequence the following pilots were not listed by Mathews and Foreman.\n\nEberhard von Boremski, listed with at least 88 aerial victories, plus two unconfirmed claims, potentially further aerial victories with EJG 1.\n\nKurt Bühligen, listed with 99 aerial victory claims, plus nine further unconfirmed claims.\n\nWalther Dahl, claimed at least 90 aerial victories, plus further 13 unconfirmed claims.\n\nSiegfried Freytag, listed with 89 aerial victories.\n\nFriedrich Geißhardt, listed with 93 aerial victory claims, plus eight further unconfirmed claims.\n\nHartmann Grasser, listed with more than 96 aerial victory claims, plus six further unconfirmed claims.\n\nKurt Tanzer, listed with at least 35 aerial victories.\n\nKurt Ubben, listed with 93 aerial victory claims, plus 13 further unconfirmed claims.\n\nFranz Woidich, listed with 82 aerial victory claims, plus thirty further unconfirmed claims.\n\nAdditionally, Spick lists Horst-Günther von Fassong with 136 aerial victories, Rudolf Rademacher with 126 aerial victories, and Herbert Rollwage with 102 aerial victories. Further more, the US historian David T. Zabecki states that Friedrich Wachowiak was credited with 140 aerial victories, and Paul-Heinrich Dähne with 100 aerial victories. Lastly, the authors Raymond F. Toliver and Trevor James Constable list Rudolf Müller with 101 aerial victories.\n\nThis along with the ! (exclamation mark), indicates the first pilot to reach the 100th, 150th, 200th, 250th, or 300th victory claim.\n\nThis and the ? (question mark) indicates information discrepancies listed by Obermaier, Prien, Stemmer, Rodeike, Bock, Mathews and Foreman.\n\nName 100th Claim 150th Claim 200th Claim 250th Claim 300th Claim 15 July 1941! 24 October 1941 26 October 1941 31 March 1942 14 January 1943 17 March 1943 22 April 1942 12 May 1942 14 May 1942 4 September 1942 26 September 1942! 18 May 1942 19 May 1942 27 January 1943 22 April 1944 20 May 1942 29 August 1942! 17 June 1942 15 September 1942 22 July 1942 24 July 1942 25 July 1942 1 August 1942 5 August 1942 9 July 1944 22 August 1942 5 July 1943 31 August 1942 2 February 1943 5 September 1942 6 September 1942 17 December 1942 15 September 1942 12 August 1943 19 September 1942 22 September 1942 22 September 1942 30 September 1942 5 March 1943 3 October 1942 25 April 1943 22 October 1942 7 August 1943 29 August 1943 28 November 1943 25 October 1942 29 October 1942 26 January 1943 10 November 1942 19 December 1942 8 August 1943 30 November 1943 12 February 1944 5 January 1945 2 January 1943 14 January 1943 26 January 1943 16 March 1943 27 April 1943 27 April 1943 5 July 1943 5 May 1943 6 May 1943 8 June 1943 25 May 1944 20 November 1944 8 June 1943 15 June 1943 18 August 1943 8 September 1943 14 October 1943! 4 July 1943 25 March 1944 25 July 1944 6 July 1943 17 July 1943 21 July 1943 21 July 1943 2 August 1943 12 August 1943 17 August 1943 18 August 1943 12 October 1943 3 September 1943 13 August 1944 14 September 1943 4 April 1944 26 August 1944 27 October 1944 20 September 1943 13 December 1943 26 March 1944 4 June 1944 24 August 1944! 11 October 1943 26 July 1944 28 October 1944 15 October 1943 16 July 1944 16 October 1944 25 October 1943 2 November 1943 14 June 1944 6 November 1943 22 November 1943 22 October 1944 12 January 1944 15 January 1944 28 May 1944 5 February 1944 22 March 1944 31 May 1944 17 August 1944 23 March 1944 December 1944 31 March 1944 11 April 1944 24 October 1944 8 April 1945 11 April 1944 22 April 1944 ?[Note 1] 3 May 1944 6 May 1944 19 May 1944 24 May 1944 1 June 1944 7 June 1944 8 June 1944 8 June 1944 ?[Note 2] 13 June 1944 ?[Note 3] 15 June 1944 15 June 1944 23 August 1944 24 March 1945 16 June 1944 June 1944 14 July 1944 17 July 1944 July 1944 20 July 1944 17 February 1945 21 July 1944 ?[Note 4] 24 July 1944 23 August 1944 31 August 1944 14 September 1944 14 September 1944 24 September 1944 15 April 1945 30 September 1944 23 February 1945 9 October 1944 16 October 1944 January 1945 28 February 1945 25 March 1945 26 March 1945 April 1945 14 April 1945 21 April 1945\n\nThe Luftwaffe fighter force defended the airspace of German-occupied territory against attack, first by RAF Bomber Command and then against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the Combined Bomber Offensive. In particular, combating the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, flying in a combat box, posed a challenge to the Luftwaffe daytime fighter force. In consequence, the destruction of a heavy bomber, or the Herausschuss (separation shot)—a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box which was counted as an aerial victory—was considered an exceptional achievement. In consequence, the Luftwaffe introduced a point system in 1943 which accounted for the difficulties in shooting down a heavy bomber. Although a single heavy bomber shot down or damaged still counted as one aerial victory, the accumulated points earned a fighter pilot awards, medals and promotions. The point system worked as follows:\n\nThree points were granted for the destruction of heavy bomber.\n\nTwo points were earned for the Herausschuss of a heavy bomber.\n\nOne point was awarded for the endgültige Vernichtung (final destruction), a coup de grâce inflicted on an already damaged heavy bomber.\n\nThis along with the * (asterisk), indicates that the pilot was either killed in action (KIA), missing in action (MIA), died of wounds (DOW) or killed in a flying accident (KIFA).\n\nThis and the / (slash) indicates information discrepancies listed by Aders, Caldwell, Forsyth, Girbig, Held, Obermaier, Spick, Ring, Mathews, Foreman and Zabecki."
