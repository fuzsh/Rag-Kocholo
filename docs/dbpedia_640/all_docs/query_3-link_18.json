Despite recent advances in understanding their taxonomic and genomic compositions, little is known about how their transcriptomes vary globally. Here, we present a dataset of 187 metatranscriptomes and 370 metagenomes from 126 globally distributed sampling stations and establish a resource of 47 million genes to study community-level transcriptomes across depth layers from pole-to-pole. We examine gene expression changes and community turnover as the underlying mechanisms shaping community transcriptomes along these axes of environmental variation and show how their individual contributions differ for multiple biogeochemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we find the relative contribution of gene expression changes to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar waters and hypothesize that in polar regions, alterations in community activity in response to ocean warming will be driven more strongly by changes in organismal composition than by gene regulatory mechanisms.\n\nVideo Abstract\n\nClick here to view.(133M, mp4)\n\nKeywords: Tara Oceans, global ocean microbiome, metatranscriptome, metagenome, microbial ecology, gene expression change, community turnover, biogeochemistry, eco-systems biology, ocean warming\n\nHighlights\n\n•\n\nA catalog of 47 million genes was generated from 370 globally distributed metagenomes\n\n•\n\nMeta-omics data integration disentangled the mechanisms of changes in transcript pools\n\n•\n\nTranscript pool changes of metabolic marker genes show distinct mechanistic patterns\n\n•\n\nCommunity turnover as a response to ocean warming may be strongest in polar regions\n\nA global survey of gene and transcript collections from ocean microbial communities reveals the differential role of organismal composition and gene expression in the adjustment of ocean microbial communities to environmental change.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMicroorganisms perform ecological functions and drive biogeochemical cycles that transform matter and energy on a global scale (Falkowski et al., 2008). Recent advances in sequencing technology and the analysis of DNA extracted from environmental samples (metagenomics) have made it possible to systematically characterize the taxonomic and genomic composition of microbial communities in diverse biomes (Fierer et al., 2012, Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012, Sunagawa et al., 2015). In the ocean, such biodiversity surveys have been conducted on local (Karl and Church, 2014, Venter et al., 2004), as well as regional and global scales (Biller et al., 2018, Kent et al., 2016, Rusch et al., 2007, Sunagawa et al., 2015). These and similar efforts (Delmont et al., 2018, Duarte, 2015, Kopf et al., 2015, Tully et al., 2018) have provided valuable baseline data that reveal the biodiversity of ocean microbial taxa, the repertoire of genes and genomes in the ocean, and the ecological factors that structure ocean microbial communities.\n\nDespite the rich information that can be obtained about the gene-encoded functional potential in an environment, metagenomics alone cannot predict which, and in what amount, specific functions contribute to the molecular activity of microbial communities in situ, because genes may be variably expressed or not expressed at all. In contrast, metatranscriptomics enables the analysis of the pool of transcripts from genes that are actually expressed in an environmental sample (Helbling et al., 2012, Moran et al., 2013, Poretsky et al., 2005) and therefore provides a more accurate depiction of ecologically relevant processes that are occurring (e.g., in response to diurnal or other variations in environmental conditions) (Ottesen et al., 2014, Poretsky et al., 2009). In addition, the integration of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to quantify levels of gene expression, that is, the relative amount of expressed transcripts per gene, has revealed a number of important insights. For example, the ecological importance of photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and ammonium uptake has been highlighted in Prochlorococcus, which is abundant in oligotrophic waters of the tropical and subtropical ocean, because genes encoding these functions were among the most highly expressed genes in their genomes (Frias-Lopez et al., 2008). Picocyanobacteria, in general, have been found to contribute more to the community pool of transcripts than expected by abundances inferred from metagenomics, whereas the opposite has been shown for some heterotrophic bacteria, including those from the highly abundant SAR11 clade (Dupont et al., 2015, Frias-Lopez et al., 2008, Shi et al., 2011).\n\nIn contrast to studying differences between gene and transcript abundances within samples, understanding why a pool of community transcripts (metatranscriptome) changes from one sample to another has received much less attention. Notably, changes in metatranscriptomes can result from alterations in the relative abundance of organisms and their associated genes (community turnover) and/or by changes in the expression of genes encoded among the community members (Satinsky et al., 2014) ( ). For microbial communities in the Amazon River Plume, it has been shown, for example, that higher transcript levels for some functions (e.g., acquisition of phosphorous) could be explained by increased gene abundances in free-living communities whereas for other functions (e.g., sulfur cycling, vitamin biosynthesis, and aromatic compound degradation) higher transcript levels were attributed to increased gene expression levels in particle-attached communities (Satinsky et al., 2014). However, global-scale biogeographic patterns of community turnover versus gene expression-driven changes in metatranscriptomes, and the ecological determinants of the relative contribution driving these two mechanisms, have not yet been studied for marine or any other environmental microbial communities.\n\nHere, in order to better understand the basis of metatranscriptomic differences across environmental gradients (e.g., latitude and depth) in the ocean, we leveraged efforts from the Tara Oceans (2009–2013) expeditions (Karsenti et al., 2011) and analyzed an environmentally contextualized dataset (Pesant et al., 2015) of metatranscriptomes and metagenomes, which includes a circumpolar representation of the climate change-impacted Arctic Ocean (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010, Overland et al., 2018). To capture the abundances of genes and transcripts from ocean microbial communities at the species level, we established a reference catalog of non-redundant protein-coding sequences (hereafter, genes). Using this integrated information, we determined for a number of biogeochemical processes involved in photosynthesis, as well as in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, varying contributions of community turnover, and gene expression changes to metatranscriptome differences across latitude and depth. We further compared, as a function of temperature, the relative contributions of these mechanisms and hypothesize how they will differ between polar and non-polar regions in response to ocean warming.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nA New Meta-omics Resource for Global Ocean Microbiome Research\n\nThe dataset for this study consists of metatranscriptomic (n = 187) and metagenomic (n = 370) samples collected at 126 globally distributed sampling stations across a latitudinal range of 142° ( ; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199). The samples originate from the light-penetrated, epipelagic waters from the surface (SRF), deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), and mixed water layer, and dark waters from the mesopelagic (MES) layer, from 5 m to 1,000 m in depth (median depths of 5 m, 50 m, and 550 m for SRF, DCM, and MES, respectively). The 187 prokaryote-enriched metatranscriptomic libraries were generated and sequenced to an average depth of 28 Gbp per sample (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199), after protocol optimization for low-input RNA samples (Alberti et al., 2014) (STAR Methods). These data were analyzed in conjunction with a set of 131 virus-, 59 giant virus-, and 180 prokaryote-enriched metagenomes (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199), which include prior sequencing efforts of Tara Oceans (Sunagawa et al., 2015), virus-enriched metagenomes from polar (n = 44) and non-polar (n = 42) regions (Gregory et al., 2019, Roux et al., 2016) (see STAR Methods for definitions), and 41 prokaryote-enriched metagenomes from the Arctic Ocean (new to this study).\n\nWe aimed to capture whole community-level variations in community turnover and gene expression changes and to place these data into the context of geographic and environmental gradients at a global scale. Notably, the applicability of this approach critically depends on the evolutionary distances between the organisms present in the environment and those represented in genomic sequence databases (Nayfach et al., 2016). Ideally, genome sequences would be available for all organisms that comprise the communities of interest, thus facilitating the integration of gene abundance and gene expression data to assess whole-community compositions. Such analyses appear to be within reach for the human gut microbiome, for which appropriate genomic resources have recently become available (Almeida et al., 2019, Nayfach et al., 2019, Pasolli et al., 2019). However, for ocean microbiome samples, less than 10% of metatranscriptomic, and less than 5% of metagenomic data, can currently be resolved at the species-level using available marine genomic sequence databases ( A).\n\nTo overcome this limitation, we generated an updated version of the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC.v2; original version in Sunagawa et al., 2015) based on 370 metagenomes with extended geographic coverage, particularly for the Arctic Ocean ( ). Among the 47 million non-redundant genes, 24.5% were reconstructed, although partially detected elsewhere ( ), in the Arctic Ocean samples alone, highlighting the added value of sampling genomically underexplored environments. Using this reference, nearly 70% of the genes could be taxonomically annotated, and 61% showed homology to known (i.e., existing) orthologous groups (OGs) in the database used for gene functional annotation (eggNOG version 4.5) (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016) (STAR Methods). We further grouped the remaining 39% of the genes in the OM-RGC.v2 that represent unknown genes (i.e., genes of unknown function without detectable homology to known sequences), into ∼250,000 gene clusters (GCs) based on shared sequence similarity ( C; STAR Methods). We identified significant differences when comparing transcript abundances between depth layers (for 5,439 GCs) or between polar and non-polar regions (for 31,339 GCs), or correlations with environmental parameters (for 21,648 GCs) ( ). These findings suggest ecologically relevant yet unknown functions of these genes in response to environmental variation. A benchmarked analysis of conserved co-expression as a method for identifying functionally related genes (Stuart et al., 2003) suggests that some of the GCs are likely to represent unidentified players in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and energy production/conversion ( ; Table S1).\n\nIn contrast to existing ocean genomic reference databases, we found the OM-RGC.v2 to capture the majority of gene-encoding metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data (70% and 51%, respectively) ( A) used in this study, making it a suitable resource to address our aim of analyzing whole-community metatranscriptomic compositions. All gene sequences can be queried online for their abundance, expression, and geographic distribution (Villar et al., 2018), and they are linked to contextual environmental parameters (Pesant et al., 2015) facilitating additional gene-centric explorations in the future.\n\nVariation of Meta-omic Compositions across Latitude and Depth\n\nHaving established resources to quantify whole-community taxonomic, genomic, and transcriptomic compositions, we next sought to identify patterns and drivers of compositional structure across major axes of environmental variation in the ocean biome at a global scale. Numerous studies have revealed that microbial communities are vertically stratified in the ocean, with a striking boundary between epipelagic and mesopelagic zones (DeLong et al., 2006, Giovannoni and Stingl, 2005, Sunagawa et al., 2015). Polar and non-polar communities have also been shown to separate into distinct groups with different species-level taxonomic compositions (Ghiglione et al., 2012, Gregory et al., 2019). Critically, however, the shared gene content between different strains of the same species may be as low as 40%, as has been shown, for example, in Escherichia coli (Mira et al., 2010). Furthermore, gene functional redundancy in microbial communities (i.e., when the same gene functions are encoded by different taxa) may help to maintain important community functions in cases of biodiversity loss (Bell et al., 2005). Thus, it is difficult to predict whether gene functional compositions and gene expression-regulated transcriptomic repertoires would follow the same patterns of taxonomic composition changes.\n\nTo address this question, we first aimed to locate the boundaries of differentiation (Ludwig and Cornelius, 1987) in epipelagic waters (SRF and DCM) along the latitudinal gradient for different community-compositional measures derived from the prokaryote-enriched metatranscriptomes and metagenomes (STAR Methods). From the equator northward, no significant differentiation was identified in epipelagic waters until a latitude of 40°N. At this point, the degree of differentiation increased significantly for all community-compositional measures and peaked at around 60°N. A similar trend was also observed for the southern hemisphere ( ) and is consistent with the taxonomic compositional differences observed between polar and non-polar waters for bacterial (Ghiglione et al., 2012, Gregory et al., 2019) and viral communities (Ghiglione et al., 2012, Gregory et al., 2019). We further found that the differentiation is reflected by significant enrichments of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the order Flavobacteriales (e.g., Formosa, Polaribacter, NS5, NS7, and NS9 marine groups), the class Gammaproteobacteria (OM182 clade and Piscirickettsiaceae), and eukaryotes (e.g., Phaeocystis), as well as by depletions of Prochlorococcus spp., members of the Rhodospirillaceae family, and members of the SAR11 and SAR406 clades toward higher latitudes ( ). Here, the congruent patterns observed for both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic differentiation—measured as changes in the relative abundance of gene and transcript copies at the level of OGs—indicate that on a global scale, taxonomic composition largely shapes the composition of gene functional content. Organismal composition also dominates over gene regulatory variations in shaping community-level transcriptomic compositions across ecological boundaries.\n\nIndeed, we found that all community-compositional measures were highly correlated ( ), and their variability in the epipelagic ocean was, among a set of 27 environmental parameters, best explained by seawater temperature ( A). This result complements earlier reports of temperature as an important factor driving the taxonomic composition of ocean microbial communities (Fuhrman et al., 2006), which was corroborated by a later analysis of a globally distributed set of samples that accounted for geographic effects and disentangled temperature from other environmental parameters to confirm that it acts as a key driver of taxonomic and gene functional compositions in epipelagic, non-polar open ocean waters (Sunagawa et al., 2015). In fact, the identification of an ecological boundary starting at 40°N and peaking at 60°N coincides with a steep temperature decrease between the North Atlantic and Arctic waters that were sampled ( ) and relates to additional oceanographic features. At ∼40°N/S, the 15°C annual-mean isotherm effectively delineates the permanently stratified ocean from the subpolar and polar regions (Behrenfeld et al., 2006), while winter mixing in the North Atlantic is the strongest (deepest mixed layer depth) at ∼60°N (Montégut et al., 2004). The ecological boundary we describe here for microbial community compositions could thus be due to physico-chemical changes driven by the variability in the vertical mixing of oceanic water masses, which is linked to differences in sea surface temperature.\n\nWe next quantified metatranscriptomic richness (i.e., the unique number of OGs detected by cDNA sequencing), as a proxy for the diversity of transcribed gene functions, and compared this to taxonomic and metagenomic richness (i.e., the unique number of detected OTUs and OGs, respectively, detected by DNA sequencing). As measures of diversity, the latter two provide information about the stability (McCann, 2000), functionality (Cardinale et al., 2006), and possibly productivity (Tilman, 1995, Vallina et al., 2014) of ecological communities. In addition, we sought to quantify the fraction of the gene-encoded functional potential in a given community that is actually transcribed at a given time by comparing metatranscriptomic and metagenomic richness.\n\nTaxonomic and metagenomic richness were highly correlated, without showing signs of saturation, supporting the previous observation that functional redundancy in the marine ecosystem is rather low (Fierer et al., 2013, Galand et al., 2018), and both were found to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar communities at all tested depth layers ( B). These data are congruent with studies suggesting a decrease in the taxonomic diversity of communities with increasing latitude (Fuhrman et al., 2008, Gregory et al., 2019, Ibarbalz et al., 2019, Sul et al., 2013) and an associated decrease in gene functional diversity, although other studies have also proposed alternative patterns of latitudinal diversity gradients (Ghiglione et al., 2012, Ladau et al., 2013, Raes et al., 2018). In contrast, metatranscriptomic richness was not correlated with taxonomic richness and only poorly correlated with metagenomic richness, and no significant difference was found between polar and non-polar microbiomes or between any depth layers ( B). This unexpected disparity between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic richness patterns suggests that the non-transcribed proportion of a given metagenome is higher in mesopelagic waters and non-polar regions relative to epipelagic waters and polar regions. This could be due to a higher proportion of dormant or dead, and passively sinking, microbes in the mesopelagic compared to the epipelagic ocean. Alternatively, these observations may reflect the prevalence of genome streamlining in surface ocean waters (Swan et al., 2013), where per genome, the number of genes is expected to be lower (Mende et al., 2017). The proportion of transcribed genes is thus expected to be higher than in mesopelagic waters. Future studies will be required to determine whether the apparent saturation of simultaneously transcribed gene functions, despite increasing numbers of encoded gene functions, is a feature that is also common in microbial communities from other biomes.\n\nDifferential Abundance and Expression of Biogeochemical Cycling Genes\n\nThe pool of microbial community transcripts may vary along environmental gradients as a function of community turnover and/or changes in gene expression ( and ; STAR Methods). To disentangle the individual contributions of these mechanisms across environmental gradients for genes that are involved in ecologically relevant processes, we integrated 122 prokaryote-enriched, matched metatranscriptomes and metagenomes and quantified the differential abundances and expression levels for a set of biogeochemical marker genes across depth layers and between polar and non-polar waters ( ).\n\nAs a first step, we sought to validate both data quality and our analytical approach by testing whether patterns for genes involved in well-studied processes, including carbon fixation, photosynthesis, and nitrogen cycling could be observed. As expected, we found that the most differentially abundant transcripts between epipelagic and mesopelagic layers included those from the photosynthesis marker genes, psaA and psbA, and genes encoding the subunits of RuBisCO (rbcL and rbcS), the key enzyme required for carbon fixation ( A). Moreover, we observed that abundances of the rbcL and rbcS transcripts were highly correlated with those of psaA and psbB, which is consistent with the expectation that carbon fixation is primarily driven by photoautotrophs rather than chemoautotrophs (Raven, 2009, Shively et al., 1998, Swan et al., 2011). This is further supported by the observation of low RuBisCO gene expression levels in mesopelagic waters, despite the presence of chemoautotrophs ( ). In addition to psbA, the abundances of other photosynthetic marker genes, including markers for the photosynthetic reaction center (petC, petE, and petH) and the cyanobacteria-specific antenna proteins (apcA, apcF, cpcA, cpeA, and cpeT), were lower in polar than in non-polar waters ( B). This result likely reflects the depletion of cyanobacteria in colder environments (Marchant et al., 1987) ( ) and an underrepresentation of eukaryotic phototrophs in the prokaryote-enriched samples we analyzed here.\n\nWith respect to nitrogen cycling, we detected both gene and transcript abundances for denitrification marker genes (napA, nirS, norB, and nosZ) to be enriched in mesopelagic versus epipelagic waters ( A). As expected for this predominantly anaerobic process (Zehr and Ward, 2002), transcript abundances were particularly high in oxygen-depleted waters, although interestingly, similar transcript levels were also observed in some well-oxygenated Arctic water samples ( ). Transcripts of nitrogen fixation marker genes (nifK, nifH, and nifD) were more abundant in non-polar than in polar regions, with the highest abundances detected in waters between 20° and 35° (absolute latitude) with low nitrate and nitrite concentrations ( ). These data generally agree with the long-standing expectations that nitrogen fixation activity is higher under conditions of nitrogen limitation and is primarily driven by cyanobacteria in tropical and subtropical regions (Dixon and Kahn, 2004, Stal, 2009). However, more recent studies have provided additional evidence for an extended geographic and depth range (Blais et al., 2012, Harding et al., 2018, Moisander et al., 2017) and for a wider taxonomic breadth of nitrogen fixing organisms including non-cyanobacterial heterotrophic diazotrophs (Bombar et al., 2016, Delmont et al., 2018). Given these findings, we further investigated the biogeography of the nifH gene in more detail and determined which organisms not only encode this gene, but also express it. Specifically, we analyzed the distribution of nifH gene and transcript abundances among 24 nifH-encoding “species” that were detected in the 122 matched metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. From this analysis, we found that a number of Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, for which genomes have recently been reconstructed (Delmont et al., 2018), were not only abundant, but also among the top contributors to the nifH transcript pool in the studied samples ( ). Additionally, for the first time, to our knowledge, we detected nifH gene expression in mesopelagic Arctic waters and reconstructed the nif operon-containing genome of its carrier (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3352180; STAR Methods), a candidate heterotrophic Deltaproteobacterium or a member of the Myxococcota phylum according to a recent proposal for a standardized bacterial taxonomy (Parks et al., 2018), that awaits further characterization.\n\nIn spite of the potential biases inherent to our approach that are related to the collection of spatially discrete data over a period of more than 3 years and to the sampling process itself (e.g., unaccounted effect of seasonality or potential changes in transcript abundances during the sampling process), we were able to corroborate expected patterns of metabolic processes using metatranscriptomic data at global scale. In addition to validating our methods, we demonstrated how our community-centric approach for analyzing metatranscriptomes can be used in conjunction with metagenomic data, and furthermore, bridge to new genome-resolved insights. Building on the robustness of our analysis, we next focused on disentangling the mechanisms that underpin the differences in community transcriptomes across depth and latitude. Notably, we observed cases in which transcript abundance changes could be mainly attributed either to differences in gene abundance or gene expression or a combination of these mechanisms. As described above, the enrichment of transcripts from denitrification marker genes in mesopelagic versus epipelagic waters are mainly driven by changes in gene abundance ( A). In this case, gene abundance changes, due to environmental filtering of organismal community composition in response to higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations in mesopelagic waters, dominate the observed community transcriptomic differences. Conversely, a higher transcript abundance of marker genes for anaerobic dissimilatory sulfate reduction (aprA and aprB) in epipelagic waters is driven by an increased expression of these genes, despite no significant differences in the abundance of these genes between depth layers ( A). A taxonomic breakdown shows that 39% and 59% of aprA and aprB genes were encoded by Proteobacteria, and only 2% of each gene could be assigned to taxa containing known sulfate reducers (Archaea, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and Deltaproteobacteria) (Muyzer and Stams, 2008). These results suggest that the significance of alternative uses for aprA and aprB in oxic waters, namely to detoxify cells by catalyzing the oxidation of sulfite accumulated in the cytoplasm, as described for clades such as SAR11 and SAR116 (Meyer and Kuever, 2007, Smith et al., 2016), may be of global relevance.\n\nA more complex scenario for observing differences in transcript pools is exemplified by a number of marker genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction (cysD, cysH, cysI, cysJ, and cysN), for which the observed differences across the latitudinal gradient (i.e., higher transcript abundances in non-polar versus polar regions) result from a combination of community turnover and gene expression changes. In this case, the increased transcript abundance in non-polar waters results from higher expression levels, despite a lower abundance of genes. Interestingly, we found the transcript abundance of these marker genes to be anticorrelated with that of dmdA ( ), the key gene for the demethylation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (Howard et al., 2006), which results in incorporation of carbon and sulfur into bacterial biomass (Kiene et al., 1999). Based on these data, we hypothesize that the global-scale expression of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway may be downregulated in response to the availability of DMSP, which is used by prokaryotes as an alternative source for sulfur assimilation (Kiene et al., 2000). Notably, if turnover and differential gene expression are both operative, relying on gene abundance alone may lead to false predictions including patterns that would suggest the opposite of what is manifested at the transcript level (e.g., non-photosynthetic carbon pathways with higher epipelagic expression levels but higher mesopelagic gene abundances of mct and abfD).\n\nTurnover Dominates over Gene Expression Differences in Polar Water Communities\n\nIn light of global climate change, a better understanding of how ocean microbial communities will respond to ongoing changes is urgently needed (Cavicchioli et al., 2019, Overland et al., 2018). In particular, the Arctic region has experienced some of the highest ocean surface water temperature anomalies recorded to date (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010). Ocean warming models (scenario RCP 8.5, business as usual) predict that mean surface water temperatures will increase by 2°C to 5°C in the Arctic by the end of the century (Alexander et al., 2018), highlighting a critical need to better understand how these changes will impact microbial communities in this region. Given that these projections focus on surface temperature changes and due to their major contribution to biogeochemical cycles (Field et al., 1998), we sought to assess the response of epipelagic communities to environmental variation, as reflected by measurable differences in their metatranscriptomic composition, and subsequently to use these spatially discrete data to hypothesize on future projections.\n\nSpecifically, we aimed to disentangle ( ; STAR Methods) whether differences in microbial community transcriptomes are impacted more strongly by community turnover and/or by gene expression changes along the temperature gradient at their sampling locations. To this end, we divided all samples into groups of 15 samples (bins) using a sliding window along the temperature gradient, so that each group reflected the range of ocean warming expected before the end of the century (median temperature difference within each bin: 1.6°C; A). We then quantified the different mechanisms of metatranscriptome changes within each bin ( ; STAR Methods) and found that in warmer epipelagic waters, the relative contribution of community turnover to metatranscriptomic compositional dissimilarities is significantly lower than that of gene expression changes. In contrast, the effect of community turnover in colder (predominantly Arctic) waters is higher or in the same range as gene expression changes ( A). Overall, community turnover was found to be significantly higher in polar communities than in non-polar communities (p < 0.001), whereas gene expression changes displayed the opposite pattern (p < 0.001) ( B). Interestingly, the shift in the relative contributions of the different mechanisms of metatranscriptome changes occurs at ∼15°C and therefore coincides with the ecological boundary previously identified, which, as such, not only delineates communities differing in their composition but also in the mechanism shaping their transcript pool. We further found that the effect of temperature was greater than that of other environmental variables, such as nitrate/nitrite concentrations and salinity ( ), suggesting a higher acclimatory capacity of microbial communities in warm than in cold epipelagic waters in response to temperature variations.\n\nFinally, by extrapolating our results from spatially discrete data to potential consequences of climate change (Blois et al., 2013), we hypothesize that the relative impact of organismal composition changes on microbial community transcriptomes will be greater in polar than in non-polar waters. This extrapolation, however, needs to be interpreted within the limitations of the data analyzed here, namely that it cannot account for the evolutionary adaptation of microbial communities to gradual changes with time. As such, further studies resolving long-term temporal dynamics of metatranscriptome changes are required to improve our understanding of the contributions of community turnover and gene expression changes in the context of environmental changes. Notwithstanding, the present results provide a first global-scale evaluation of the mechanisms underpinning the changes in community transcriptomes as well as a framework for future work.\n\nConclusions\n\nLarge-scale oceanographic sampling expeditions, such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) or GEOTRACES (Anderson et al., 2014, Koltermann et al., 2011, Woods, 1985) have been extremely valuable in building our understanding of the ocean circulation, and the distribution of major nutrients and elements including trace metals, as well as their contribution to the climate system. However, our geochemical and physical knowledge of the ocean remains incomplete without incorporating the processes that regulate biogeochemical cycles at planetary scale (Falkowski et al., 2008). Analyzing the repertoire of genes and transcripts from environmental samples can inform us about the potential and activity of microbial communities that drive these cycles at global scale and thus help us to understand the intertwined processes that shape the physico-chemical state of the ocean through biological activity.\n\nIn this study, we describe global biogeographical patterns of microbial community transcriptome compositions and demonstrate how changes in these compositions can be attributed to community turnover and/or gene expression changes as the underlying mechanisms. Assessing the mechanisms that underlie such compositional differences, as demonstrated here, can help us to determine whether changes in the molecular activities of microbial communities are regulated by gene expression changes or by a turnover of organisms containing genomic modifications that arose over evolutionary time. In addition, an improved understanding of the ecological factors that drive community compositional and diversity changes can help us to better predict how ocean microbial communities will respond to environmental changes. For example, the consistent identification of temperature as a major explanatory factor for global-scale community-level differences in genomic (Sunagawa et al., 2015) and transcriptomic (this study) composition, as well as taxonomic diversity (Gregory et al., 2019, Ibarbalz et al., 2019), has wide-ranging implications, in particular for the Arctic Ocean, given the current projections of disproportionately high warming rates in this region (Alexander et al., 2018, IPCC, 2014).\n\nNotably, the analyses of this study were enabled by a systematic, highly contextualized, pan-oceanic set of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data that, along with the OM-RGC.v2, complements other large-scale datasets that have been developed for eukaryotes (Carradec et al., 2018, Ibarbalz et al., 2019), prokaryotes (Biller et al., 2018), and viruses (Gregory et al., 2019). Together, these will pave the way for an eco-systems level understanding of ocean plankton diversity, function, and activity across boundaries of organismal size ranges. To reach this goal, it will be important to integrate temporal meta-omics data, ideally from global observations, to account for seasonal variations and other concomitant environmental changes, such as increased stratification, acidification, nutrient availability, and deoxygenation of the oceans (Bopp et al., 2013, Schmittner et al., 2008). Such concerted efforts are required to further refine gene-to-ecosystem models (Coles et al., 2017, Garza et al., 2018, Guidi et al., 2016) and to inform environmental and climate policies (Le Quéré et al., 2018), which must consider not only how microorganisms are impacted by but also how they may affect anthropogenic climate change (Cavicchioli et al., 2019).\n\nSTAR★Methods\n\nKey Resources Table\n\nLead Contact and Materials Availability\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Shinichi Sunagawa (ssunagawa@ethz.ch).\n\nExperimental Model and Subject Details\n\nGenetic and environmental data were collected at 126 sampling stations across all major oceanic provinces during the Tara Oceans expedition (2009 - 2013). Stations with absolute latitude above 60° were generally considered to be polar. Additionally, station 155 (at 54.5°N) was considered a polar station based on a manual evaluation of associated environmental data. The sampling was conducted within the mesopelagic layer (MES, 200-1000 m) and within the epipelagic layer at the sea surface (SRF, 5-10 m) and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM, 20-200 m) layer, with the exception of nine epipelagic samples that could not be classified as either SRF or DCM (MIX, 25-200 m). The sampling strategy and methodology are described in detail elsewhere (Pesant et al., 2015). Information about the samples used in this study is provided in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199. Environmental data measured or inferred at the depth of sampling are published at the PANGAEA database (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875582). Additional information used throughout the manuscript is available at https://www.ocean-microbiome.org.\n\nMethod Details\n\nExtraction of nucleic acids and sequencing of DNA and cDNA\n\nMetagenomic DNA and RNA were extracted from prokaryote and girus-enriched size fraction filters as described previously (Alberti et al., 2017). For the DNA libraries, extracted DNA was sonicated to a size range of 100-800 bp. The DNA fragments were subsequently end-repaired and 3′-adenylated before Illumina adapters were added using the NEBNext Sample Reagent Set (New England Biolabs). The ligation products were then purified by Ampure XP (Beckmann Coulter), and the DNA fragments (> 200 bp) were PCR-amplified with Illumina adaptor-specific primers and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The amplified fragments were then size selected (∼300 bp) on a 3% agarose gel. For the metatranscriptomic libraries, ‘low-input’ cDNA synthesis methods adapted to prokaryotic mRNA were used (Alberti et al., 2014) (STAR Methods). Briefly, total RNA was depleted of rRNA using the Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kit for Bacteria (Epicentre) and then concentrated to 10 μL total volume with the RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (ZymoResearch). The amount of depleted RNA was measured by Qubit RNA HS Assay quantification, and 40 ng or less was used to synthesize cDNA with the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Clontech). Additional details are described elsewhere (Alberti et al., 2017). All libraries (DNA and RNA) were subjected to profile analysis using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) and qPCR (MxPro, Agilent Technologies, USA), and then sequenced with 101 base-length read chemistry in a paired-end flow cell on Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing machines (Illumina, USA).\n\nQuantification and Statistical Analyses\n\nGeneration and annotation of the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog v2\n\nTo pre-process raw sequencing reads, we removed the adapters and primers from the whole reads and trimmed low-quality (quality value < 20) nucleotides from both ends. Reads shorter than 30 nucleotides after trimming as well as reads (and their mates) that mapped to quality control sequences (PhiX genome) were discarded. Then, all single-end reads (inserts with one discarded read) were removed. Finally, the reads (and their mates) that mapped onto sequences in a ribosomal sequence database were removed using the SortMeRNA software (Kopylova et al., 2012). After these pre-processing steps, we used MOCAT (version 2) (Kultima et al., 2016) to generate sets of high-quality (HQ) metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads (option read_trim_filter; solexaqa with length cut-off 45 and quality cut-off 20), and to remove reads matching Illumina sequencing adapters (option screen_fastafile with an e-value of 0.00001). We then assembled the HQ metagenomic reads (option assembly; minimum length 500 bp) and predicted gene-coding sequences [minimum length 100 nucleotides (bp)] on the assembled scaftigs [option gene_prediction; MetaGeneMark]. We used CD-HIT v4.6 (Fu et al., 2012) to cluster the gene-encoding nucleotide sequences using cutoffs of 95% sequence identity and 90% alignment coverage of the shorter sequence. We then selected the longest sequence as the representative sequence for each cluster. After removing sequences shorter than 100 nucleotides, we obtained a set of 46,775,154 non-redundant, contiguous, gene-encoding nucleotide sequences, which we operationally defined as “genes” (Sunagawa et al., 2015). We refer to this set of genes as the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog version 2 (OM-RGC.v2).\n\nTo assign a taxon to each sequence in the OM-RGC.v2, we built a reference database from UniRef90 (59.2M proteins from release 2017_08 made available on 2017-08-30) (Suzek et al., 2015), supplemented with a set of 19.4M sequences from marine transcriptomes and single-cell amplified genomes (Carradec et al., 2018). We then removed sequences of viral origin from the reference database and replaced them with sequences from the Virus-Host DB (release 80 of 2017-04-05) (Mihara et al., 2016). We obtained taxonomic classification of each reference sequence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information taxonomy database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy release of 2017_10_26) (Mihara et al., 2016, NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2018), with the exception of the virus taxonomic lineages, which we modified as described previously (Carradec et al., 2018) to better reflect the classification of eukaryotic viruses.\n\nSequence similarities between OM-RGC.v2 sequences and the reference database were computed in protein space using MMSEQS2 (Steinegger and Söding, 2017) with the following parameters: search–max-seqs 1000 -a -e 1E-5 -v 3. Taxonomic affiliation was assigned using a weighted Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) approach. For each marker gene, all protein sequence matches in the reference database with a bitscore value ≥ 90% of the bitscore of the best match were kept. We excluded outlier taxa by using a weighted LCA that covered at least 75% of all bitscores.\n\nWe used BlastKOALA (Kanehisa et al., 2016) and eggNOG-mapper (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017) to functionally annotate the OM-RGC.v2 according to orthologous groups in the KEGG database (release 86.1) and the eggNOG database (version 4.5.1), respectively. In total, 23.6% of the genes were annotated to a KEGG orthologous group (KO), and 60.9% were annotated to an eggNOG orthologous group (OG). In total, we annotated 9,026 KOs and 76,022 OGs. Genes that were not annotated to any OG were clustered de novo to define uncharacterized gene clusters (GCs). The clustering was performed with MMSEQS2 with the following options: –cluster-mode 2–cov-mode 1 -c 0.9 -s 7–kmer-per-seq 20. GCs supported by at least 10 sequences were kept (249,914 GCs in total). Thus, of the 39% of genes without known homologs in the eggNOG database, ∼250,000 were grouped de novo by homology into high confidence (minimum cluster size = 10) gene clusters (GCs), accounting for 21.8% of all the genes in the OM-RGC.v2 ( ).\n\nProfiling of taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic compositions\n\nWe used three different metrics of microbiome composition: the taxonomic composition, corresponding to the abundance profile of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs); the metagenomic composition, corresponding to the abundance profile of functionally annotated groups of genes (OGs or KOs); and the metatranscriptomic composition, corresponding to the transcriptomic abundance profile. We performed the profiling on the prokaryote-enriched subset of the dataset, including 187 metatranscriptomic samples and 180 metagenomic samples, of which 129 pairs were coupled ( ).\n\nTaxonomic profiling was performed using 16S/18S ribosomal RNA gene fragments directly identified in the Illumina-sequenced metagenomes (Logares et al., 2014) as follows. We extracted 16S/18S reads, referred to as mitags, and used USEARCH v9.2.64 (Edgar, 2010) to map them to cluster centroids of taxonomically annotated 16S reference sequences from the SILVA database (Pruesse et al., 2007) (release 128: SSU Ref NR 99; https://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/release_128/Exports/taxonomy/tax_slv_ssu_128.txt), which had been clustered based on a 97% sequence identity cutoff beforehand. Multiple hits were allowed (default parameters, except maxaccepts = 10,000 and maxrejects = 10,000), although only the mitags mapping to a unique reference sequence were used to compute abundances at the OTU level. The mitags mapping to more than one reference sequence (i.e., from different OTUs) were further processed to determine their taxonomic affiliation at a higher taxonomic level. Then, these were assigned to the taxonomic level (domain, phylum, class, order, family, or genus) that was common to all the corresponding reference sequences. Abundance tables at all levels were built by counting the number of mitags assigned to each taxon in each sample and the number of unassigned mitags. Only OTUs assigned to Bacteria and Archaea were considered and the abundance table was rarefied (8,766 reads/sample) using the rrarefy function in the R package vegan (Dixon, 2003) to correct for uneven sequencing depths among samples.\n\nWe generated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic composition profiles by mapping HQ reads from prokaryote-enriched metagenomes (n = 180) and metatranscriptomes (n = 187) to the OMRGC.v2 using MOCAT (options: screen and filter with length and identity cutoffs of 45 and 95%, respectively, and paired-end filtering set to yes). The per-sample abundance of each reference gene in the catalog was calculated as the gene length-normalized insert count (MOCAT option profile), i.e., mean number of reads per base, for both data types. We subsequently converted the gene abundance profiles into functional profiles by taking the sum of the length-normalized abundances across reference genes belonging to the same functional group (i.e., OG, KO or GC).\n\nWe determined the mapping rates of the prokaryote-enriched metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to the OM-RGC.v2 by summing the number of HQ reads that were aligned with the parameters described above. For other databases [MarRef database v3, updated 2019/01/19 (Klemetsen et al., 2018) and a collection of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reconstructed from Tara Oceans samples (Delmont et al., 2018)], we estimated the mapping rates by aligning the HQ reads using bwa and filtering the alignments with similar parameters (query aligned > = 80%, length > = 45bp and identity > = 95%). The mapping rates were then defined as the proportion of HQ reads from a metagenome or metatranscriptome that mapped to the reference after filtering. To compare the mapping rates to the reference genomes (which include intergenic regions) with those to the OM-RGC.v2 (only gene-encoding sequences), we corrected for the average coding density of prokaryotic genomes using the value of 87% (Hou and Lin, 2009, Mira et al., 2001). We additionally confirmed this estimate by using the genome statistics available from 3,491 finished bacterial and archaeal genomes downloaded from IMG (mean: 87%, min: 41%, max: 98%, 95%, CI: 74%–94%).\n\nNormalization and transformation of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles and computation of gene expression profiles\n\nPer-cell normalization:\n\nWe normalized the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles to relative cell numbers in the sample by dividing the gene abundances by the median abundance of 10 universal single-copy phylogenetic marker genes (MGs) (Milanese et al., 2019, Sunagawa et al., 2013). The MGs were selected as either OGs (COG0012, COG0016, COG0018, COG0172, COG0215, COG0495, COG0525, COG0533, COG0541, and COG0552) or KOs (K06942, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01889\",\"term_id\":\"183756\",\"term_text\":\"K01889\"}}K01889, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01887\",\"term_id\":\"183754\",\"term_text\":\"K01887\"}}K01887, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01875\",\"term_id\":\"195134\",\"term_text\":\"K01875\"}}K01875, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01883\",\"term_id\":\"1036032716\"}}K01883, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01869\",\"term_id\":\"172935\",\"term_text\":\"K01869\"}}K01869, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01873\",\"term_id\":\"192633\",\"term_text\":\"K01873\"}}K01873, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K01409\",\"term_id\":\"168752\",\"term_text\":\"K01409\"}}K01409, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K03106\",\"term_id\":\"331943\",\"term_text\":\"K03106\"}}K03106, and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K03110\",\"term_id\":\"333325\",\"term_text\":\"K03110\"}}K03110) to normalize the OG and KO profiles, respectively. MGs are particularly suitable for normalizing metatranscriptomic data to provide estimates of relative per-cell gene copies, because they represent constitutively expressed housekeeping genes. In support of that notion, the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic abundances of the MGs were previously shown to be highly correlated, indicating that the MGs are constitutively expressed across many different conditions (Milanese et al., 2019). The normalized metagenomic abundance can therefore be interpreted as the per-cell number of gene copies of a given functional group. Accordingly, the normalized metatranscriptomic abundance can be interpreted as the relative per-cell number of transcripts of a given functional group. We applied this normalization procedure to all of the functional (i.e., KO, OG, and OG+GC) metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles used in this study.\n\nTransformation to counts, variance stabilization, and log2 transformation:\n\nWe converted the normalized profiles to integer counts ranging from 0 to 109 using a pseudo-count (i.e., normalized abundance profiles were divided by their maximum, multiplied by 109, and subsequently rounded). We then corrected the count-normalized metagenomic and metatranscriptomic abundance profiles using variance-stabilizing transformation as implemented in the DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014). This step yielded log2-transformed profiles, which are approximately homoscedastic (i.e., all genes display approximately constant variation across samples). For each sample in the resulting profiles, the abundance values were centered on the median of the 10 MGs, so the resulting values after variance stabilization can also be interpreted as the relative number of genes/transcripts per cell.\n\nComputation of gene expression profiles\n\nThe gene expression profiles, representing the relative number of transcripts per gene copy, correspond to the ratio between the metagenomic composition profile (reflecting the number of gene copies per cell) and the metatranscriptomic composition profile (reflecting the relative number of transcripts per cell). Because of the log-transformation, the expression profiles were computed as the difference between the log2-transformed metatranscriptomic profile and the log2-transformed metagenomic profile ( ).\n\nComputation of taxonomic and functional richness\n\nTaxonomic richness was calculated as the number of OTUs detected in a given sample. Functional richness was computed as the number of OGs detected in a given sample after rarefaction of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles using RTK (https://github.com/hildebra/Rarefaction) (Saary et al., 2017).\n\nEcological boundaries, patterns, and drivers\n\nWe detected ecological boundaries using the split moving-window distance analysis (Ludwig and Cornelius, 1987) as implemented in the EcolUtils R package (https://github.com/GuillemSalazar/EcolUtils). We used the Euclidean distance of the log2-transformed taxonomic (mitags), metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles (eggNOG annotation) with a window size of 10 samples. The significance was computed based on 10,000 permutations and a significance threshold of p = 0.01.\n\nWe assessed differential OTU abundances along the latitudinal gradient by computing the latitudinal niche value for each OTU (that is, the abundance-weighted mean absolute latitude of each OTU). The significance of the latitudinal niche values was computed by comparing the observed values to 1,000 simulated values after randomization of the abundance table. The analysis, built on previous developments (Stegen et al., 2012, Stegen et al., 2013), was performed using the niche.val function in the EcolUtils R package (https://github.com/GuillemSalazar/EcolUtils). As was done previously (Salazar et al., 2015), OTUs that appeared in less than 10 samples were excluded from the analysis.\n\nWe related the normalized and log2-transformed taxonomic, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles (eggNOG annotation) of the epipelagic samples to 27 environmental factors through partial Mantel tests (corrected for spatial distance) with 10,000 permutations and Bonferroni correction. We performed pairwise comparison of environmental factors using Spearman correlation with Bonferroni correction. Spatial distances between sampling stations were computed as the shortest distance between two sampling stations while avoiding landmasses, and using the geographical coordinates of each sampling station. For that purpose, we used the bathymetry across the globe (available in the R package maptools) to construct a raster object. We then applied the Dijkstra algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959) to compute the shortest distance between sampling stations,considering only the coordinates corresponding to elevations below 0 m (i.e., excluding land masses).\n\nAnnotation of gene clusters by co-variation patterns\n\nAs a culture-independent approach to predict gene function, we analyzed co-variation patterns of the genes in the OM-RGC.v2 with unknown function and no detectable homology to known sequences, which accounted for 39% of all the genes. Specifically, we first benchmarked the co-variation analysis to 1) evaluate the extent to which the pairs of OGs that were involved in a common metabolic process could be linked through covariation, 2) determine which type of covariation best identifies metabolically related OGs (i.e., co-variation based on gene abundance, transcript abundance, or gene expression levels), and 3) find the correlation cut-off (rmin) that provides optimal identification of metabolically related OGs. For that purpose we used a reduced profile with only the OGs occurring in at least 10% of the samples to avoid spurious correlations based on insufficient data points. We computed all pairwise Pearson correlations between OGs based on the log2-transformed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and expression profiles. We linked each OG to a second OG by finding the best correlated OG. The pair of OGs was considered linked if the Pearson’s r value was high enough (i.e., if r > rmin). Whenever possible, the functional eggNOG-based annotation included a KEGG-based annotation for each OG, which we used to determine whether pairs of OGs were involved in a common metabolic process by checking if the corresponding KOs were involved in a common KEGG reaction, module, or pathway. For benchmarking, true positives (TPs) were defined as the number of OGs involved in a common metabolic process that were also linked through co-variation. False positives (FPs) corresponded to pairs of OGs that were linked through co-variation that were not involved in a common metabolic process. True negatives (TNs) corresponded to pairs of OGs that were not involved in a common metabolic process nor linked through co-variation. False negatives (FNs) corresponded to pairs of OGs that were involved in a common metabolic process, but were not linked through co-variation. We assessed the predictive power of the co-variation analysis by computing the false-positive rate [FPR = FP / (FP + TN)]) and the true positive rate or sensitivity [TPR = TP / (TP + FN]). We computed the FPR and TPR for rmin values between 0 and 1 (step of 0.1) and built receiver operating characteristic curves by plotting FPR against sensitivity for each data type (gene co-abundance, transcript co-abundance, and co-expression) and each metabolic linkage definition (shared reaction, module, and pathway) ( ). We subsequently used co-expression analysis to annotate all of the unknown genes, grouped into ∼250k GCs by finding the GCs that could be linked to either an OG or a second GC. Specifically, we used co-expression analysis with an rmin value of 0.86, the lowest Pearson’s r value that assured an FPR < 5%, which gave an FPR of 4.7%, 3.7%, and 3.9%, and a sensitivity of 15%, 26% and 33% for pathways, modules, and reactions, respectively). We identified significant associations for 16,706 GC-GC pairs and 810 GC-OG pairs. Among the GC-OG pairs, 702 pairs linked a GC to an existing OG of unknown function, and the other 108 pairs linked a GC to an existing OG of known function (Table S1).\n\nDifferential gene expression and gene abundance of microbial biogeochemical cycling genes across depths and latitude\n\nWe built a list of marker KOs for microbial metabolism relevant to marine biogeochemical cycles by selecting KOs that could be uniquely associated to KEGG pathways involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, or nitrogen or sulfur metabolism (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199). Out of 72 marker KOs, 52 were detected in the dataset.\n\nWe used the log2-transformed KO profiles to compute the differences in mean gene and transcript abundances and the mean expression for all marker KOs between the polar and non-polar samples, and between epipelagic and mesopelagic samples. We tested the significance of the differences using the Mann-Whitney test with Holm correction for multiple testing and p < 0.05 as the threshold for significance after correction. For the polar/non-polar comparison, only epipelagic samples were used.\n\nAnnotation of nifH genes\n\nWe broke down the KO for the nifH gene ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"K02588\",\"term_id\":\"192885\",\"term_text\":\"K02588\"}}K02588) and identified 24 constituent genes found in the OM-RGC.v2 and detected in the matched metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. We then used the gene and transcript abundances of those genes for a detailed analysis (see ). We re-annotated the 24 individual genes by comparing them to a nifH-specific compilation of databases (Delmont et al., 2018). The compilation included the FunGene database (Fish et al., 2013) and the Zehr database (Heller et al., 2014), both containing nifH genes curated from the NCBI GenBank database, and the Farnelid database, containing amplicon sequences from a large-scale survey of nifH genes in the surface ocean (Farnelid et al., 2011) as well as the assemblies from the original study (Delmont et al., 2018). The compilation of databases was downloaded from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5259421. We compared the 24 genes against the compilation database using blastn (Camacho et al., 2009) with default parameters. For phylum level annotation, we only considered the best hit with at least 50% of the query aligned and to investigate the presence of the same gene in the database we used a minimum identity of 95% and an alignment length above 80%. Following up on a gene characterized as uncultured cyanobacterium, we identified it to be derived from the UCYN-A genome (Zehr et al., 2008)\n\nReconstruction of a metagenome-assembled genome of a putative nitrogen-fixing organism from Arctic mesopelagic waters\n\nWe co-assembled four metagenomes from the mesopelagic Arctic Ocean (Stations 201, 205, 206, and 209) using megahit v1.1.2 (Li et al., 2016) (parameters:–presets meta-large -t 48 -m 0.99–min-contig-len 2000) and dereplicated the resulting assemblies with cd-hit v4.6.8-2017-0621 (compiled with make MAX_SEQ = 10000000 and parameters: -c 0.99 -T 64 -M 290000 -n 10). We then back-mapped the dereplicated assemblies with the prokaryote-enriched Arctic metagenomes using bowtie v2.3.2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), and subsequently filtered (samtools view -q 10 -F 4 -Sb) and sorted (samtools sort @48) the alignments. We binned the assembled contigs with metaBAT2 v2.12.1 (Kang et al., 2019) using jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths (parameters:–minContigLength 2000–minContigDepth 1) to build the profile and selected a minimum contig size of 2 kbp for the binning step. We subsequently refined the bins as follows: (i) each bin was re-assembled with CAP3 v021015 (Huang and Madan, 1999) (parameters -o 25 -p 95) and (ii) overlapping contigs were manually checked in Geneious R10 to resolve polymorphic regions.\n\nWe screened the bins by blasting the nifH gene sequence against the assemblies and identified a candidate metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) containing a sequence with > 99% identity to the nifH sequence. Using CheckM v1.0.8 (Parks et al., 2015), we assessed the quality of the corresponding MAG, which showed 86.6% completeness, 1.9% contamination, and 0% strain heterogeneity. The MAG was taxonomically annotated using GTDBTk 0.3.0 (Parks et al., 2018) with the database release r89. This annotation attributed the MAG as a member of an uncultured class within the Myxococcota phylum (formerly a class within the Deltaproteobacteria). Additionally, the GTDBTk results showed an average nucleotide identity of < 77% with an alignment fraction < 10% with the closest placement in the database, suggesting a high level of phylogenetic novelty. The functional annotation of the MAG was performed using Prokka v1.13 (Seemann, 2014) with options–gcode 11 and–kingdom using the domain inferred by CheckM, as well as by additional hmmer searches (v 3.1b1) against the PFAM (release 31.0), KEGG (release 2019-02-11), COG (release 2014) & TIGRFAM (release 15.0) databases. Based on this annotation (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3352180), we hypothesize that the assembled genome is from an organism with heterotrophic metabolism, as it did not contain any identifiable genes from the photosynthetic machinery or any complete pathway for carbon fixation. The contig and gene sequences of the reconstructed genome are available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3352180.\n\nDecomposition of metatranscriptomic profiles and metatranscriptome-based community distances\n\nWe developed an analytical framework to measure how much of the difference in transcript abundance between samples was the result of differences in gene abundance (reflecting community turnover) and how much was the result of differences in gene expression (reflecting gene expression changes) ( ). The framework is based on the computation of the expression profiles (Enorm) as the ratio between the log2-transformed transcript (Tnorm) and gene (Gnorm) abundance profiles (Tnorm/Gnorm), which results in the following linear equality (Figure S7): log2(Tnorm) = log2(Gnorm) + log2(Enorm). That is, after log2-transformation, the normalized transcript abundance of a given functional group in a given sample equals the per-cell-normalized gene abundance plus the per-cell-normalized expression. We used that equality to derive an equation for the dissimilarity between two metatranscriptomic profiles. The resulting equation using the squared Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure is:\n\ndi,j(log2(Tnormi,j))=di,j(log2(Gnormi,j))+di,j(log2(Enormi,j))+Ii,j\n\n[equation 1]\n\nwhere\n\nIi,j=∑0k(log2(Enormj,k)−log2(Enormi,k))·(log2(Gnormj,k)−log2(Gnormi,k))\n\n[equation 2]\n\nand di,j is the squared Euclidean distance between samples i and j computed across k features (i.e., OGs).\n\nEquation 1 allows us to analytically decompose the dissimilarity between two metatranscriptomes into the dissimilarities between the corresponding metagenomic and expression profiles, and a third term, Ii,j (hereafter referred to as the ‘interaction component’), which corresponds to the weighted scalar product of the profiles. Given that the scalar product of centered vectors corresponded to their correlation coefficient, the interaction component can be interpreted as the mean correlation between the changes in abundance and expression between two samples for all functional groups. Consequently, Ii,j > 0 when changes in metagenomic abundance and expression between two samples are positively correlated, Ii,j < 0 when those changes are anticorrelated, and Ii, j = 0 when the changes are orthogonal.\n\nWe decomposed the metatranscriptomic dissimilarity between all samples into the abundance-based dissimilarity (i.e., community turnover), the expression-based dissimilarity (i.e., gene expression changes), and the interaction component (Equations 1 and 2). We then analyzed the dataset using bins in order to investigate how the communities respond to environmental variation of magnitude similar to that of predicted future environmental changes. Indeed, the median temperature difference within each bin was1.6°C, much in line with predicted climate change induced variations (Alexander et al., 2018). We used a moving window to compute the median ratio between the abundance-based and expression-based distances for all pairwise dissimilarities in bins containing 15 samples each along the whole range of seawater temperatures. Thus, values above 1 represent bins where community turnover dominates over gene expression changes, whereas values below 1 represent bins where gene expression changes dominate over community turnover. For each bin, the difference between the mean ratio and 1 (equal contribution of both processes) was computed using the Wilcoxon test with Holm correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nData and Code Availability\n\nAll raw reads are available through ENA at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena using the identifiers listed in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473199.
