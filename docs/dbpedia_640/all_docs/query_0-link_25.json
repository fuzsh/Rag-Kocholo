        "text": "From Country Church to Majestic Cathedral\n\nAt its founding in 1812, Trinity Episcopal Church had just 25 communicants. Both Trinity and Columbia have grown over the last 200 years, taking us from a small, country church to an urban parish with more than 3,600 baptized members.\n\nIn November 1976, the Diocese of Upper South Carolina voted to make Trinity Church, Columbia, its cathedral parish. Over the course of Trinity's history, we have been the spiritual home to members of Congress, judges, legislators, and governors, and we've played a leading role in the affairs of the city, the state, and the church.\n\nOur digital archive collection is available through the University of South Carolina Library.\n\nA Churchyard of Distinguished Graves and Historic Trees\n\nUnder the ancient oaks and magnolias of Trinity’s Churchyard are buried some of South Carolina’s distinguished sons and daughters: General Wade Hampton, General Peter Horry, and Private Robert Stark (all Revolutionary heroes); Dr. Thomas Cooper, president of the South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) and friend of Thomas Jefferson; General Wade Hampton; Henry Timrod, Poet Laureate of the Confederacy; six governors of the state; and eight bishops of the Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Famous Windows of Trinity Cathedral\n\nThe great love Trinity’s parishioners have always had for their place of worship can be seen in every detail, and most especially in our stained glass windows. Click through the images below to get a full view of our windows, or come by to see them in person - this is just a fraction of our collection, and their in-person impact cannot be overstated.\n\nSaint Paul (1968)\n\nSaint Paul (1968)\n\nFound at: North Transept\n\nSaint Paul holds a book in his left hand as testimony to his writings and a sword in his right hand. At Ephesians 6:17 Paul advises his followers “And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” Behind Paul is a sailboat, on which he traveled around the eastern Mediterranean to meet his congregations (Acts 13.4,13). Acts 27 & 28 tell of his voyage to Rome to face charges. He sails up the coast of Asia Minor in a coasting vessel, probably like the one depicted here, to the island of Malta, where he is shipwrecked. He then proceeds to Rome in a large boat conveying wheat from Egypt to Rome.\n\nThe crossed swords at the top of the window are also representative of this saint—one refers to the good fight he fought, the other to his martyrdom by the sword. The bottom of the window carries another emblem associated with Saint Paul—the serpent and the fire. In Acts 28:2-6 a viper attacks and bites him while shipwrecked on Malta. Paul threw the viper into the fire. The natives waited for his collapse and certain death, but when he survived, they pronounced him “a god.”\n\nThis window was created by Powell and Sons Company/Whitefriars of London, England.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by the congregation of Trinity Church to the glory of God and in loving memory of the Right Reverend Louis Chester Melcher, D.D. (1898-1965). The memorial is fitting, for just as St. Paul journeyed to the gentiles as the great apostle, so too did Bishop Melcher journey to Brazil in 1948 as a missionary bishop. He served as rector at Trinity from 1939-1948 and is buried in the churchyard.\n\nFeeding the Five Thousand\n\nFeeding the Five Thousand\n\nFound at: South Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates Matthew 14:19, in which Jesus took five loaves and two fish, looked to heaven, blessed the food, and gave it to the disciples to feed “about five thousand men, beside women and children.” (Matt. 14:21) In the left lancet, a boy holds a basket-like tray with two fish. In the background, three disciples, identified by their nimbus, prepare to distribute the food. In the right lancet, Jesus lifts his right hand in blessing and holds bread in his left hand. Baskets filled with bread sit at his feet. The tracery light shows two fishes.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by Margaret Brooker to the glory of God and in appreciation of loved ones.\n\nMission of the Church in the Sacraments and Sacramental Rites\n\nMission of the Church in the Sacraments and Sacramental Rites\n\nFound at: Seibels Chapel\n\nOne of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.\n\nA descending dove over the baptismal font symbolizes Baptism. In the story of the baptism of Jesus, Mark says the Holy Spirit descended “like a dove.” (Mark 1:10)\n\nThe wafer and chalice represent the Eucharist. The chalice is the “cup” (or “Holy Grail”) that Jesus used at the institution of the Lord’s Supper. (Matt. 26:17-9)\n\nInterlocking rings with the symbol represent marriage. The Greek letter chi (X) is the first letter of the Greek word for “Christ.” (Χριστος) The Greek letter rho (Ρ) is the second letter of Christ’s name in Greek. They are laid one on the other to make a monogram. The rings signify the joining of a man and a woman in unending union; the symbol indicates the presence of Christ in the marriage.\n\nOrdination is represented by the chasuble (sleeveless outer vestment) with gold orphrey (bands of rich embroidery usually on the back of the chasuble and forming a cross) and the stole, traditional clerical vestments reaching to the ankles, close-sleeved, and girded at the waist with an opening in the center to go over the head of the celebrant. The chasuble represents the robe the Roman soldiers placed on Christ after they scourged him (John 19:2). The stole—a long band worn over the shoulders and down both sides of the front—signifies the ordination of the wearer and marks the sacredness of the sacramentals. It represents immortality, the yolk of obedience, and the reign of Christ.\n\nTwo keys, one gold and one silver crossed saltire (St. Andrew’s Cross) refer to Matthew 16:19, where Jesus said to Peter, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” The colors gold and silver refer to heaven and earth and the keys represent Penance, a sacramental rite involving repentance, acceptance of penalties, and absolution.\n\nFlames and a sword represent Confirmation. Flames represent the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The sword often portrays courage against the forces of evil—the Christian witness to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit against sin, death, and the devil. It becomes “the sword of the spirit”—the responsibility of those confirmed to bear witness to Christ.\n\nMemorial: The Seibels Chapel was given by Edwin Grenville & Rosamund Kershaw Seibels and John Jacob & Bertha Willingham Seibels in memory of the members of the Seibels family who have worshiped in this parish.\n\nThe Shand Window\n\nThe Shand Window\n\nFound at: The Altar\n\nAfter the death of Dr. Peter Shand (1800-1886), Rector of Trinity for over 50 years, the congregation took up a collection for a suitable memorial. The result was that the five lancets of the original apse were replaced by this great window, called “The Shand Window” and the four accompanying Belcher lancets. The tablet was inscribed with a tribute to Dr. Shand and placed in the eastern wall of the chancel.\n\nIn the middle window, Jesus holds a child in his arms; a young woman kneels at his feet with her arms around another child. Matthew 19:14 recalls the time when Jesus, rebuking his disciples, said to them “Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nIn the arch of this window is a quatrefoil—a beautifully crafted ornamental design of a four-petaled flower.\n\nThe four adjacent lancets feature the quatrefoil with four candlesticks decorated at their base with Messianic (or Christian) roses, (five white petals with yellow styles and stamens in the center), a symbol of the Messiah. Isaiah 35:1 says that when the Messiah comes into the world it will be like a desert that will “blossom as the rose.” Combined with the candlestick, it is a symbol that Christ, “the Light of the World” (John 8:12), is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy.\n\nThese windows and the windows over the doors going into the Legislative Hall of the SC State House across the street make up one of the largest collections of Belcher Mosaic Glass in the world, outside of a museum. The quatrefoil is present in each of these four windows as well. These five windows in the apse behind the altar make an exquisite centerpiece for the cathedral’s other windows.\n\nMemorial: A memorial to the Reverend Peter Johnson Shand, D.D., was given by his congregation in loving commemoration of his faithful ministry at trinity church. Dr. Shand came from Charleston, S.C., in 1833 as a lay reader. He was ordained to the priesthood, became rector of Trinity in 1834, and served in that capacity until his death on All Saints’ Day 1886. He is interred in the churchyard.\n\nThe Miracle of Changing Water into Wine (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of Changing Water into Wine (1981)\n\nFound at: South Clerestory\n\nJesus’s first miracle occurred at the wedding in Cana of Galilee (John 2:1-11). Two interlocking rings before a cross at the top of the left lancet indicate a wedding. “Six waterpots of stone” (John 2:6) are shown at the bottom of the lancets. Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at the wedding and is probably the seated woman in green on the left. Standing is probably a member of the wedding party telling Mary that there is no wine. (John 2:3) Kneeling is a servant who was told by Mary, “Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.” (John 2:5) Jesus is shown in the right lancet. The tracery light shows a flower, perhaps a lily, symbolic of resurrection.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of John Will Walker (1914-1979) by his wife Annie Lee Walker.\n\nThe Miracle of the Ten Lepers (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of the Ten Lepers (1981)\n\nFound at: South Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the story recorded in Luke 17:12-19: As Jesus entered a village he encountered ten lepers who stand away from him but beg him, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” (Luke 17:13) Jesus tells them, “Go shew yourselves unto the priests.”’ As they walked away, with their canes, they were made clean. This window shows one of them, a Samaritan, kneeling at Jesus’s feet and thanking him as the other nine walk away. Jesus asked, “Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory, save this stranger.” In the right lancet, Jesus raises his hand in blessing and says to the Samaritan “Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.” (Luke 17:17-19)\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in memory of Alida Gonzales McMaster by Cecilia E. McMaster, her daughter.\n\nSaint Stephen (1998)\n\nSaint Stephen (1998)\n\nFound at: North Transept\n\nIt is appropriate that St. Stephen be next to St. Paul, since as Saul before his conversion, Paul both supported and witnessed the execution of St. Stephen. (Acts 8:1)\n\nActs 6:1-15 and 7:55-60 say Saint Stephen was the first-century martyr accused before the Sanhedrin. He was one of seven deacons appointed by the apostles to distribute alms.\n\nMany Hebraic Jews objected to his preaching and charged him with blasphemy against Moses and God. While he was being charged, he saw a vision and was dragged out and stoned.\n\nThe two angels above St. Stephen represent the heavens and his vision. They are holding the rocks with which Saint Stephen was stoned and a book representing his studies.\n\nSaint Stephen is dressed in a deacon’s dalmatic, a form of dress appropriate today but perhaps not in use in the first century.\n\nThis window was executed by Willet Studios of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by William Willet (1869-1921) in 1899 partly in opposition to the wide use of opalescent glass, such as that in the Narthex partition. Willet thought that transparent stained glass better served the architectural purpose of windows and he emphasized the use of traditional medieval materials and techniques. By winning the commission over Louis Comfort Tiffany and others for the Cadet Chapel at the US Military Academy at West Point in 1910, he was considered the leading American stained glass artist. (Waggoner) His company today is known as Willet Hauser Architectural Glass.\n\nMemorial: Given by Frances Harvey Morris and family.\n\n1862 Window\n\n1862 Window\n\nFound at: South Transept\n\nAt some point in time, a broom/tool closet had been installed between the original staircase and the wall. During the restoration of the Cathedral (2008-2011), the removal of this closet and the moving of the staircase revealed the only remaining window that had been installed in the expansion of the church in 1861-1862. This window is not stained glass but “Victorian painted glass.”\n\nThe Diocesan Window (1977)\n\nThe Diocesan Window (1977)\n\nFound at: The South Transept\n\nThis rose window, a companion to the rose window in the north transept, is called the Diocesan window and was installed after Trinity became the Cathedral Parish of the Diocese of Upper South Carolina. The petals radiate outward from the oculus of the window, which shows the sun setting behind a mountain, illustrating the motto of the Diocese of Upper South Carolina, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,” Psalm 121:1\n\nWith each petal the circular form of the image represents a shield, symbolizing the protection of God. The shields in the petals of this and other rose windows represent the protection of God. On each shield is an image of God from Psalm 121. Clockwise from the one o’clock position:\n\nThe keeper of mankind, “My help cometh from the Lord,” expressed by the hands of God and man.\n\nThe maker of heaven, “My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth,” expressed by stars, comet, and galaxy\n\nThe maker of earth, expressed by the earth and the moon.\n\nThe protector of man asleep, “he that keepeth thee will not slumber,” expressed by a shield above a sleeping man\n\nThe protector of man at work, “he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep,” expressed by a shield above a working man\n\nThe protector of man at worship, “the LORD is they shade upon thy right hand,” expressed by a shield above a man at prayer.\n\nThe protector by day, “The sun shall not smite thee by day,” expressed by the sun over a field.\n\nThe protector at night, “nor the moon by night,” expressed by the moon and three stars over a house.\n\nThe protection of God, “The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil,” expressed by the shield of the Lord above.\n\nThe going out, “The LORD shall preserve thy going out,” expressed by a thatched mission church.\n\nThe coming in, “and thy coming in,” expressed by a simple home.\n\nThe giver of eternity to man, “from this time forth, and even for evermore,” expressed by the symbols of resurrection—the cross and two Easter lilies.\n\nThe window was designed by Columbia attorney Augustus T. Graydon (1916-2007), a life-long active member of Trinity, and Crosby Willet of the Willet Studios, who created the window.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by the state-record foundation to the glory of God and in memory of the Gonzales family, who served the cathedral and the state so faithfully.\n\nThe Prophets Daniel and Ezekiel (1975)\n\nThe Prophets Daniel and Ezekiel (1975)\n\nFound at: North Transept\n\nThis pair of lancets comprise one of the two windows in the Cathedral that illustrate the four prophets of the Old Testament. These portrayals of the Old Testament Prophets provide a wonderful parallel for the four Evangelists who are portrayed in the Narthex windows.\n\nDaniel, who lived during the Babylonian Captivity, is shown in the center of the lancet with his hands together in prayer, as he did three times daily (Daniel 6:10). Daniel was known for his various visions in which he saw the future of Israel and the world.\n\nThe ram’s head at the top of the right lancet depicts Daniel’s vision of a two-horned ram, which drives away those in all directions with impunity. The two horns represent the kings of the Medes and Persians (Daniel 8:8-9, 20).\n\nAt the bottom of the lancet, a lion reminds us of the story of Daniel in the lion-pit. Daniel 6:16-23 says King Darius issued an edict that said if anyone should present a petition to any god or human other than the king himself, that person would be thrown into the lion-pit. When Daniel disregarded the edict and continued to pray to his god, his enemies quickly told King Darius, who, with reluctance, followed through on his threat. As Daniel was being cast into the pit, the king said, “Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.” When the king returned the next day, he found that God had sent an angel to close the lions’ mouths and Daniel was saved.\n\nEzekiel, portrayed in the left lancet, is known for his prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, the restoration to Israel, and the new temple. Like Daniel, he lived during the Babylonian Captivity in the 6th century BC. Ezekiel’s right hand is raised in blessing, his left hand holds a model of the new temple. As an exiled priest, he dealt with the everyday problems of worship in a foreign land, dreamed of a new Jerusalem, inspired hope and faith in his fellow exiles, and influenced the development of the synagogue.\n\nWillet Studios executed these two lancet windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by family and friends to the glory of God and in loving memory of the Right Reverend John Adams Pinckney, 1905—1972, and Hilda P. Pinckney, Bishop Of The Diocese Of Upper South Carolina from 1963 to 1972. Bishop Pinckney is interred in the churchyard.\n\nThe Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah (1975)\n\nThe Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah (1975)\n\nFound at: South Transept\n\nThis pair of lancets depict Old Testament prophets. Their arches are obscured in the church by a balcony support, but the obscured portion contains no pictorial subjects.\n\nJeremiah (right lancet), the ninth of the prophets is generally believed to be the author of the Book of Jeremiah, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, and the Book of Lamentations and is cited in the New Testament (Hebrews 8:8-12; 10.16-17). He lived in the late 7th century BC, some 60 years after the death of Isaiah. He correctly predicted the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple (Jeremiah 38:2). He was persecuted by his family, priests, and the princes of Judah, who threw him into a cistern, depicted at the top of this window, atop palm leaves, symbols of rejoicing.\n\nJeremiah is shown holding a stone. Tradition says he was stoned to death by the Jews in Egypt because of his unpopular messages against the rebellious Israelites.\n\nIsaiah (left lancet) was a prophet who lived in the Kingdom of Judah in the 8-7th centuries B.C. when Assyria conquered the Kingdom of Israel, Judah’s northern neighbor. Judah allied itself with the Assyrians, lest its chief city, Jerusalem fall. Isaiah 37:1-23 tells of Isaiah’s prophecy to Judah’s king Hezekiah that God would visit His wrath on the invaders. The Assyrians lost 185,000 men and the king never attacked Judah again. (2 Kings 19; 2 Chronicles 32) Isaiah is best known for his “Song of the Suffering Servant,” (Isaiah 52:13-53:12), widely taken by Christians as a prophecy of the coming of the nature, suffering, and death of Jesus Christ. According to John 12:41, Isaiah “saw [Jesus’] glory and spake of him.”\n\nIsaiah is here portrayed holding a saw. The Talmud (Yevamot 49b) and the Muslim tradition record that after the death of Hezekiah the unrighteous Israelites had Isaiah executed by being sawn in half (as was the Apostle James the Lesser), but there is no Christian authority for this.\n\nThe top of the window shows the scroll on which he recorded his prophecies, and a pair of tongs with which a seraph placed a live coal on Isaiah’s lips to purge him of his sins. (Isaiah 6.5-7)\n\nThe Willet Studio executed these two lancet windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Jane Tucker Dana (1896-1972) and Francis Johnstone Dana (1890-1981) by Frank J. Dana, Frank J. Dana Jr., and Anne Dana Beach.\n\nThe Lamar Window (1846)\n\nThe Lamar Window (1846)\n\nFound at: North Transept\n\nThis group of four lancets is partially obscured by the east stairwell to the transept balcony. The center of each section is etched glass (two green, one yellow, one purple, the dominant colors of the church calendar) surrounded by a stained glass border. Made in Munich, Germany, these are the last of the original lower nave windows of the 1846 church.\n\nMemorial: To the glory of God and in thanksgiving for those who have faithfully served this parish for more than a century by Mr. And Mrs. William Francis Lamar Jr., William Francis Lamar III, and William Francis Lamar IV.\n\nSaint Peter\n\nSaint Peter\n\nFound at: South Transept\n\nIn the upper portion, two angels bear a shield with gold and silver keys saltire (crossed diagonally). The keys refer to Matthew 16:19, where Jesus said to Peter, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” The colors gold and silver refer to heaven and earth.\n\nIn the center, Peter holds an open book in his left hand, which usually refers to the word of God, and a staff in his right hand.\n\nIn the lower portion, a cock crows—an image from Matthew 26:75, “Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.” Behind the cock is the inverted cross, on which Peter is said to have been crucified, deeming himself unworthy of being crucified in the same position as Jesus, according to the apocryphal “Acts of Peter.”\n\nThis window, a companion to the St. Paul Window in the north transept, was produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nMemorial: The Saint Peter window was given in loving memory of the Right Reverend Clarence Alfred Cole, D.D., Bishop of Upper South Carolina, 1953-1963, by the congregation of Trinity Church. Bishop Cole is interred in the churchyard.\n\nThe Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (1910)\n\nThe Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (1910)\n\nFound at: The Bapistry\n\nThis window pictures Joseph holding a pair of turtledoves, alongside Mary, the mother of Jesus, Simeon holding the Christ child, and Anna. It was made by Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany, one of the world’s foremost studios for stained glass, founded in 1848.\n\nJesus was brought to Jerusalem to be presented to the Lord according to the law that required “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons” as a sacrifice (Luke 2:24)\n\nLuke 2: 25-40 records the story of Simeon, a just and devout man who was told by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah. Guided by the Holy Spirit, he went to the temple. When Mary and Joseph brought in the child “to do for him after the custom of the law,” (2:27) Simeon took him in his arms and praised the Lord saying: “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.” (2:29-32)\n\nThis passage appears also in the services of Evening Prayer and Compline in the Book of Common Prayer under the title Nunc Dimittis.\n\nLuke 2:36-38 tells the story of Anna, who, after her husband’s death, “never left the temple but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer.” She came upon the scene in the temple, thanked the Lord, and began to talk “about the child to all who were looking for the liberation of Jerusalem.”\n\nMemorial: The window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Hugh Smith Thompson (1836-1904) and Elizabeth Clarkson Thompson (1840-1909) by their children and grandchildren. The Thompson burial plot is located just outside this window in the churchyard.\n\nThe \"I Am\" Rose Window (1977)\n\nThe \"I Am\" Rose Window (1977)\n\nFound at: The North Transept\n\nA rose window is formed like a great rose blossom in full bloom. Each petal of this window graphically presents twelve unique sayings of Jesus, (beginning at the position of one o’clock and moving clockwise).\n\n“I that speaketh unto thee am he [the Messiah]” (John 4:26) is depicted by the letters IHΣ at the heart of the sunburst.\n\n“I am the bread of life” (John 6:35) is depicted by wheat and a loaf of bread combined with the crux ansata (Latin: “cross with a handle”), after the Egyptian hieroglyph Ankh, which means “life.”\n\nAt Rev. 21:6 Jesus said “I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life.” The petal shows lambs drinking from a fountain of water pouring from a rock.\n\n“Before Abraham was, I am” (John 8:58) is depicted by the palm branch of triumph, peace, and eternal life and crown of eternal rule.\n\n“I am the light of the world” (John 8:12) is depicted by a candle lighting the globe.\n\n“I am the door” (John 10:9) is depicted by a door.\n\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16) is depicted by a hand. The hand is probably the best-known symbol of God the Father and the only one used for the first eight centuries.\n\n“I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman” (John 15:1) is depicted by a grapevine and grapes.\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6) is depicted by the combination of a path, a flaming torch, and the cross of life.\n\n“Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for I am” (John 13:13) is depicted by a crown and scepter.\n\n“I am the resurrection, and the life” (John 11:25) is depicted by the phoenix, a mythological bird believed by the ancients to set its nest and itself on fire when old, only to be subsequently resurrected from the ashes.\n\n“I am alpha (A) and omega (Ω), the beginning and the end, the first and the last.” (Rev. 22:13) Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the eternity of our Savior.\n\nAt the heart of the rose is the lamb of God, Agnus Dei. The lamb was a sacrificial animal in antiquity, which came to symbolize Jesus, who was sacrificed for our sins: St. John the Baptist, just after the baptism of Jesus, twice pointed him out saying, “Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1,29,36).\n\nThis window was created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by the Hampton family as a memorial to all the members of the Hampton family, who have served this place since its founding in 1812.\n\nChrist's Ministry\n\nChrist's Ministry\n\nFound at: Seibels Chapel\n\nOne of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.\n\nThe cross in the foreground and the crown of thorns represent Christ’s victory over death, selfishness, and pride by his suffering, death, and resurrection. This crown, plaited by the soldiers and placed on the head of Jesus during his trial before Pilate, was a mockery, a symbol of humiliation and suffering (John 19:2).\n\nThe feet of Christ ascending commemorate the ascension of Christ to heaven on the fortieth day after Easter, “Holy Thursday,” (Acts 1:9).\n\nThe shield of the blessed Trinity is pictured with the three curving sides, equal in length, carrying the Latin words, “non est” (is not), while the short straight bands have the word “est” (is). The outer circles bear the words “Pater” (Father), “Filius” (Son), and “Spiritus Sanctus” (Holy Spirit). The inner circle bears the word “Deus” (God). The circles emphasize eternity and God’s never-ending love.\n\nThe Dove is the usual symbol of the Holy Spirit and always contains the triradiate nimbus around its head. The dove represents the descent of the Holy Spirit at Jesus’s baptism, and thus the gift of God’s guidance at baptism.\n\nThe cross and white banner with red cross symbolize Christ’s victory over death, sin, and the devil. The white banner represents the body of Christ, which is attached to the cruciform staff; the staff represents the cross on which Jesus died and through which the risen Christ saves the world. Red symbolizes the blood of martyrs.\n\nThe coins, basin, and towel represent Maundy Thursday, the betrayal of Judas, and the Last Supper. The coins are an emblem of the treachery of Judas in his conspiracy with the chief priests to betray Jesus (Matthew 26:15). On the night Jesus was betrayed, Maundy Thursday, he and his disciples met for the last meal together. He took a basin and washed their feet (John 13:5). This symbol along with the towel represents his humility and servitude, the evidence of Christ’s love, and his estimate of true greatness in his kingdom.\n\nEvents in the Life of Christ\n\nEvents in the Life of Christ\n\nFound at: Seibels Chapel\n\nOne of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.\n\nThe Créche and the Epiphany Star express the birth of Christ. The illustration suggests the simplicity that typified the birth and life of Jesus.\n\nThe pair of turtle doves to be offered as a sacrifice according to the law of the Lord expresses the presentation of Jesus in the temple (Luke 2:24).\n\nBranches of the palm tree, regarded as sacred from early Semitic times, express his entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. Carried by the Jews as a sign of triumphant rejoicing, the palm branches were spread before Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem just before his crucifixion (John 12:13).\n\nThe scourges, a symbol of passion, express the forty lashes minus one that Jesus suffered before his crucifixion. (Deut.25:3)\n\nThe three gold crowns of equal size represent the three wise men, or magi, who came to Bethlehem to pay homage to the infant Jesus. (Matt.2:1-12)\n\nThe Easter lily symbolizes resurrection as it blooms at the time of Jesus’s resurrection.\n\nThe Rose Window\n\nThe Rose Window\n\nFound at: Seibels Chapel\n\nOne of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.\n\nEaster lilies symbolize the Resurrection; a dove, the Holy Spirit, which descends “like a dove.” (Mark 1:10).\n\nThe Benediction Window (1997)\n\nThe Benediction Window (1997)\n\nFound at: The Sacristy\n\nThis window displays a special benediction often used by the Reverend Manney Reid, beloved assistant rector of Trinity, 1974-1980.\n\n“Now may the peace of the running waves be with you. May the peace of the flowing air be with you. May the peace of the shining star be with you. May the peace of the quiet earth be with you. May the peace of the Christ of Peace be with you.”\n\nThis window was created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Anne Maybank Cain, 1904-1991, by her children Eleanor Cain Pope and William Lowndes Cain.\n\nThe Mary and Martha Window (1992)\n\nThe Mary and Martha Window (1992)\n\nFound at: The Sacristy\n\nSince the sacristy is the area where the Altar Guild performs its many duties, it is fitting that its window should portray the loving relationship in Bethany where Jesus lodged with Mary and Martha after his entry into Jerusalem.\n\nBiblical texts portraying these distinctly human relationships are found in Matthew 26:6-13, Luke 10:38-42, John 11, and John 12:i1-11.\n\nIn the upper scene, Mary sits at the feet of Jesus while busy Martha chastises her for not helping to prepare the evening meal. Symbols at the top of the lancets explain each woman’s role. The low stool—the stool on which she sat at the master’s feet—symbolizes Mary. The water container—the symbol of liturgical purification—symbolizes Martha and parallels the cleansing of the house.\n\nIn the lower scene, another meeting between Jesus and this family of Bethany is illustrated. The scene includes Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. (John 11) Mary anoints the feet of Jesus with costly ointment and wipes them with her hair. Judas, the group’s treasurer, remonstrates at this extravagance; but Jesus replies, “The poor always ye have with you, but me ye have not always” (John 12:8).\n\nMemorial: This window was given to honor and hold in memory the Women of Trinity Cathedral Parish who have not only given faithful service but have sought a close relationship with God and the Christian family. Their names are listed on a plaque near the window. The donors are listed in the Trinity Memorials book.\n\nThe First Narthex Partition\n\nThe First Narthex Partition\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nEach of the partitions is made up of 3 lancets.\n\nLeft\n\nThis lancet mirrors the right lancet. At the top of the window are the letters XP. In the center is the Easter lily—the variety that usually symbolizes the Resurrection, but also typifies female purity and virginity and stands for the Virgin Mary. The lily of the valley, another symbol of female humility and purity, decorates the lower part of the lancet.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Annie Sloan Beverley by her family.\n\nCenter\n\nAt the top, a descending dove symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The crown and the cross in the center symbolize the reward of life after death for the faithful who believe in the crucified Savior. “Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee the crown of life” (Revelation 2:10). At the bottom of the window are three calla lilies, the usual symbol of the Virgin Mary and the Angel of the Annunciation.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of James Mercer Gibbes by his family.\n\nRight\n\nThis window mirrors the left lancet, featuring an Easter lily and a lower lily of the valley. At the top of the window is the Chi-Rho monogram of Christ.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Jane Beverley Sloan by her husband, Colonel John T. Sloan.\n\nThe Second Narthex Partition\n\nThe Second Narthex Partition\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nEach of the partitions is made up of 3 lancets.\n\nLeft\n\nThis lancet mirrors the right lancet. A dove flies from left to right holding an olive branch, symbol of eternal peace in its beak, the Greek letter A (alpha) dominates the center, and three calla lilies are shown in the lower section.\n\nCenter\n\nThis lancet, located near the west balcony where nineteenth-century choirs customarily sang, represents music in the church service. A lyre dominates the center, with an open hymnal in the background, and the lower part carries roses, symbolizing messianic hope. At the top of the window is a cross pattée, whose sheltering wings symbolize the protective power of the cross.\n\nRight\n\nThe three calla lilies in the lower portion pair this lancet with the left lancet. The dove with the olive branch in the upper part flies from right to left and the center contains the Greek letter Ω (omega), completing the reference to Rev. 22:13: “I am alpha (A) and omega (Ω), the beginning and the end, the first and the last.” Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the eternity of our Savior.\n\nMemorial: These lancets were given by the Daughters of the Holy Cross in memory of Ethel Hope Evans, daughter of the Reverend W.E. Evans, D.D., who died just after Dr. Evans was called to Columbia and before the family moved here. Dr. Evans served as Rector of Trinity from 1893 to 1900.\n\nThe Annunciation and Adoration of the Shepherds (1958)\n\nThe Annunciation and Adoration of the Shepherds (1958)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on north side of the Lower Nave that depict the life of Christ. These windows, and the five on the south side depicting the acts of the apostles, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThe right lancet shows Mary standing at a lectern. A dove sends down light from above as the angel Gabriel tells her that she will give birth to a son who will be named Jesus. Luke 1:26-38 relates the story and Luke 1:30 furnishes the inscription: “Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.” Below that inscription are three Easter lilies, symbolic of the purity of Jesus’s birth.\n\nThe left lancet tells the Christmas story from Luke 2:8-16. Mary cradles the baby Jesus in her arms, while Joseph looks over her shoulder. At Mary’s feet, three shepherds with a lamb kneel in adoration of the baby. Above Mary, a bright star, a thatched roof, and cattle remind us of the baby’s humble birthplace. Beneath the scene is inscribed Luke 2:14: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace.” Below that inscription is a cradle, emblematic of Christ’s birth.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of the Right Reverend Henry Disbrow Phillips, D.D., 1882-1955, and Ella Reese Phillips by Mrs. Henry D. Phillips.\n\nThe Motherhood Window (1991)\n\nThe Motherhood Window (1991)\n\nFound at: The Sacristy\n\nNature, motherhood, and nurturing are vividly depicted in this unusual window. Framed at the top are the names of two biblical mothers: Eve, the mother of humankind, and Eunice, the mother of Timothy.\n\nOn the left panel are male and female cardinals, a white-tailed deer with her fawns, an opossum and her young, a song sparrow, an eastern cottontail, a pileated woodpecker, bobwhites with chicks, a southern blue flag, bufflehead ducks, a Carolina wren, and a box turtle. On the right panel are a female marsh hawk, a scarlet tanager, a crow, a red fox and her young, a gray squirrel, a great horned owl, Carolina jasmine, a red-headed woodpecker, a great egret, a great blue heron, and a bullfrog. The flora and fauna displayed are native to South Carolina.\n\nThis window was designed by Willett Studios in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: The Motherhood Window, which is about love, children, and God, was given in loving memory of Rebecca K. Bettis by her husband and children, and in memory of Bennett S. Masaschi by his wife.\n\nThe Baptism of Christ and the Calling of the Apostles (1931)\n\nThe Baptism of Christ and the Calling of the Apostles (1931)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on north side of the Lower Nave that depict the life of Christ. These windows, and the five on the south side depicting the acts of the apostles, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThe right lancet of this window illustrates Luke 3:21-22. A dove with the tri-radiant nimbus brings down the Holy Spirit in the form of a shaft of light upon John baptizing Jesus while others watch. “Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came down from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.” (Luke 3:21-22). Beneath that inscription is a scallop shell, a symbol of baptism.\n\nThe left lancet illustrates Matthew 4:18-21, in which Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw Peter and Andrew casting their nets. Behind the figures is a ship, the barque of Peter. The inscription below the scene is Matthew 4:19: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Beneath that inscription is a cross.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Davidge Gambrill (8 August 1836-14 December 1905) and Emma Guignard Gambrill (7 May 1847-25 November 1928) by their niece Mary Gambrill Jenkins.\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount and Christ Charging the Apostles (1931)\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount and Christ Charging the Apostles (1931)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on north side of the Lower Nave that depict the life of Christ. These windows, and the five on the south side depicting the acts of the apostles, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nIn the right lancet, Christ preaches the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) to the people arrayed in front of and behind him, above and below him. The inscription is Matthew’s introduction to the Beatitudes: “He opened his mouth and taught them” (Matthew 5:2).\n\nIn the left lancet, Jesus charges the Disciples to go forth in the world and preach his Word. The inscription reads “Preach, saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matthew 10:7). None of the disciples is facing Jesus because they are already setting forth on their separate ways.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in memory of George Lippard Baker, 27 July 1862-6 January 1924, sometime vestryman, by his wife, Mrs. George L. Baker.\n\nJesus and the Children (1907)\n\nJesus and the Children (1907)\n\nFound at: Satterlee Hall\n\nThis window was placed in the first Satterlee Hall, which was completed in 1907. Later, this building, minus the window, was given to Saint Peter’s Church in Great Falls, South Carolina. When the Parish House was completed in 1926, it included a large, auditorium-like room, now named Satterlee Hall. The window was placed in that room in the location that corresponded to its location in the original hall.\n\nThe subject matter is similar to that of The Altar Window, except that in this window Jesus sits with the children around him.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in memory of Paul Ellis Moseley by his parents Mr. And Mrs. George Moseley.\n\nThe Resurrection and the Ascension (1958)\n\nThe Resurrection and the Ascension (1958)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on north side of the Lower Nave that depict the life of Christ. These windows, and the five on the south side depicting the acts of the apostles, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nIn the right lancet of this window, Christ rises on the third day from the tomb which had been provided by Joseph of Arimathea (I Corinthians 15:3-4). Two Roman soldiers had been stationed at the tomb, but the soldiers are asleep. Behind Jesus, and also guarded by soldiers, are the three crosses on Golgotha where he was crucified. The inscription reads, “And the third day He shall rise again” (Luke 24:7). Jesus is surrounded by an aureole, an elongated nimbus used only in depictions of Jesus, or the Virgin and Child.\n\nBeneath the inscription is a peacock, a symbol of immortality, particularly of Christ and the Resurrection, since when the peacock loses his feathers he gains back more beautiful ones.\n\nThe left lancet shows the feet of Christ ascending forty days after the Resurrection (Luke 24:50-53; Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11) as five disciples along with Mary and Mary Magdalene look on. Acts 1:2-9 states that he ascended in the presence of all eleven remaining Apostles. The inscription reads, “He was taken up; and a cloud received Him out of their sight” (Acts 1:9).\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in gratitude to Roberta Aldrich for her years of loving service to the children of Trinity Church by her “Sunday School Children” and friends.\n\nThe Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Matthew 20:1-15 which compares the kingdom of heaven to a vineyard owner who hires workers early in the day to work for a denarius, an amount of money usually paid for a full day’s work. He goes out again at noon and at three in the afternoon and hires workers offering them the same amount of money as those he hired earlier. He goes out at 5:00 and hires more workers to work the little that remains of the day.\n\nIn the right lancet, the owner offers a denarius to a worker in the left lancet while workers hired earlier in the day are at work in the background. The baskets of grapes show that others have been working, harvesting grapes from the arbors like the one behind the worker. At the end of the day, the owner pays all the workers a denarius. The other workers complain that they have not been paid more than those who were hired later. Jesus says to one of them, “didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee…So the last shall be first, and the first last; for many be called, but few chosen.” (Matt. 20:13-16)\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Theodore Marion DuBose, Jr., M.D. (1886-1960) and Sally Hammond DuBose (1886-1976) by Dr. Hugh H. DuBose, their son.\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Walking on Water (1979)\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Walking on Water (1979)\n\nFound at: Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the story told in Matthew 14: 22-33 following the miracle of the loaves and fishes. After feeding the multitude, Jesus (in the left lancet) dispersed the multitude and told his disciples to take a boat across the Sea of Galilee while He went to a mountain top to pray until evening. When Jesus came down in the evening, the disciples were being tossed on the sea by opposing winds. Jesus walked on the water toward the disciples, telling them, “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.” (Matt. 14:27) Peter then said, “Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.” (Matt. 14:28)\n\nThe left lancet shows Jesus walking on the water at night (stars in the sky) toward the boat, telling Peter “Come.” (Matt. 14:29) The right lancet shows Peter crossing the water with the other disciples huddled together in the boat. All the disciples were frightened, especially Peter, who, when he began to sink, called to Jesus for help. Jesus rebuked him, saying “O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” The tracery light contains a quatrefoil.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of James Smith Heyward and Caroline Salley Heyward by their daughter Natalie FitzSimons Heyward.\n\nThe Parable of the Lost Sheep (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Lost Sheep (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable at Luke 15:3-7, in which Jesus asks the Pharisees, “What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?” Unlike the other illustrations of the parables, this one depicts Jesus (identified by his triradiate nimbus) as the shepherd, pulling his lost sheep in the left lancet to safety with his crook.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God with great joy and thanksgiving by Mr. and Mrs. Christopher FitzSimons iii and their family.\n\nThe Last Supper and the Crucifixion (1958)\n\nThe Last Supper and the Crucifixion (1958)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on north side of the Lower Nave that depict the life of Christ. These windows, and the five on the south side depicting the acts of the apostles, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThe right lancet portrays the Last Supper, the meal Jesus shared with the Apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion, mentioned in all four Gospels (Matt. 26:17-30; Mark 14:12-26; Luke 22:7-39; and John 13.1-16:26) and I Corinthians 11:23-26. Christ is at the head of the food-laden table surrounded by his disciples. Judas, his back turned to the table, holds a bag of coins in his right hand and shields his face with his cloak. The lower part of this lancet shows a chalice, a wafer, and the inscription, “He took the cup and gave thanks” (Luke 22:17).\n\nThe left lancet shows Jesus on the cross with a nail mark on his foot. Standing before him are Mary and the Apostle John. Jesus is looking at Mary saying, “Woman, behold thy son!” And to John, “Behold thy mother!” (John 19:26-27.) At the top of the green cross is a page of papyrus with the letters written by Pontius Pilate and placed on the cross, “INRI”—the initial letters of the Latin words “Iesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum—Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,” though the words were written in Hebrew and Greek as well as Latin (Luke 23:38; John 19:19-20). The inscription beneath the scene reads, “The Son of man is betrayed to be Crucified” (Matthew 20:18). Below the inscription is a snake twined around a cross, symbolizing the necessity of Jesus’s death for the salvation of mankind from John 3:14-15: “And as Moses lifted up the servant in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:14-15)\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Walter Bedford Moore, Jr. (1886- 1953) and Elizabeth Finley Moore (1894-1976) by his wife and family.\n\nThe Saint Matthew Window (1973)\n\nThe Saint Matthew Window (1973)\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nThree money bags at the top of the window refer to Matthew’s former occupation as a tax collector—his occupation before Jesus said to him, “Follow me.” (Matt. 9:9-13)\n\nIn the center of the window, a barefooted Saint Matthew is shown with a nimbus about his head. He holds a quill in his right hand and an open book in his left.\n\nThe winged creature with the face of a man at the bottom of the window is a frequent attribute of Matthew, as is the book that Matthew holds in his left hand because, according to St. Jerome, Matthew “began his narrative as though about a man, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.” (Matt. 1.1)\n\nAll five windows in the narthex — four depicting the Gospel writers and the Great West Window — were created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in thanksgiving for Georgia Hull Herbert and Robert Beverley Herbert by their children Robert Beverley Herbert, Jr., James Hull Herbert, Georgia Herbert Hart, and Mary Herbert Taylor.\n\nThe Coming of the Holy Spirit and the Healing of the Lame Man (1958)\n\nThe Coming of the Holy Spirit and the Healing of the Lame Man (1958)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on south side of the Lower Nave that depict the acts of the apostles. These windows, and the five on the noth side depicting events in the life of Christ, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThe left lancet shows a descending dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit descending on the twelve Apostles (Matthias has replaced Judas) gathered together on the day of Pentecost (fifty days after Easter). Pentecost was the Greek name for the Hebrew Festival of Weeks commemorating God’s giving of the law to Moses on Mt. Sinai. God used the same day to deliver the Holy Spirit to the Apostles (and others), making Pentecost “the birthday of the church.” The inscription reads, “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.” (Acts 2:1-4) Beneath the saddle bar is a flame like the ones that settled on the apostles’ heads in Acts 2:3.\n\nThe right lancet shows the first recorded act of an Apostle, Peter healing a crippled beggar. (Acts 3:1-10). Peter (cloaked in blue) and John (in red) were stopped at the temple gate by a lame man asking for alms. Peter said, “Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.” (Acts 3:6) With his right hand Peter raises the crippled man to his feet, with his left hand he gestures forward, telling him to walk. John, a generation younger than Peter, has no beard. With his right hand, blesses the beggar. The inscription beneath the scene reads., “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up.”\n\nThe lower part of the lancet shows a fountain whose waters pass beneath a bridge that turns the one stream into three, symbolizing the holy trinity. Beneath the saddle bar is a portrayal of the sacred river of Ezek. 47, in which a river issues from below the temple (the same building before which the healing takes place) which also appears in Rev. 22.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in grateful appreciation of Bishop John J. Gravatt and Mrs. John J. Gravatt (Helen Stevens) by the Reverend and Mrs. B. Duval Chambers.\n\nThe Saint Mark Window (1973)\n\nThe Saint Mark Window (1973)\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nThe upper portion of the window carries a symbol often used to refer to the Holy Bible—a lone open book with a quill. In the center, Saint Mark, with a nimbus about his head, holds a scroll.\n\nThe winged lion at the bottom is the second creature of Revelation, associated with Saint Mark at Rev. 4:7. In his gospel, Saint Mark emphasized the royal dignity of Christ; the lion, as the king of beasts, characterizes that dignity. Saint Mark also emphasized the resurrection, and in the early days of Christianity, the lion was a figure of the resurrection.\n\nAll five windows in the narthex — four depicting the Gospel writers and the Great West Window — were created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Jessie Thomson Crawford (1899-1961) by her children: Geddings Hardy Crawford, Jr.; Louise Crawford Moorefield; and Emma Jeanne Crawford Kean.\n\nThe Parable of the Prodigal Son (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Prodigal Son (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Luke 15:11-32. The younger son asks his father to distribute his estate to him and his brother before the father dies. The father agrees. The son wastes his share prodigiously in another town and facing starvation returns home offering to be one of his father’s servants. The father, however, greets him on the road home, and orders a fatted calf to be killed for a feast to celebrate his return. The elder son complains that he has behaved responsibly and honorably and has not even received a goat in return. The father replies that “It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:32)\n\nIn the left lancet, the rather poorly dressed son returns home as the industrious brother sits behind him with a spade. In the right lancet the father rushes to embrace his son with the fatted calf in the background. The tracery light contains a trident symbolizing the Trinity.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God with great joy and thanksgiving by the Clifford Poinsett Exum Family.\n\nBaptism and Laying on of Hands (1958)\n\nThe Trinity Window (1969)\n\nThe Miracle of the Paralytic (1978)\n\nThe Parable of the Unprepared Builder (1981)\n\nSt. Paul on the Road to Damascus and St. Paul Preaching in Athens (1934)\n\nSt. Paul on the Road to Damascus and St. Paul Preaching in Athens (1934)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on south side of the Lower Nave that depict the acts of the apostles. These windows, and the five on the north side depicting events in the life of Christ, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThough Paul was not one of the original Apostles, approximately half of Acts treats Paul’s life and works in founding churches in Asia Minor and Europe from approximately 30-60 AD. He is credited with writing 14 of the 27 books of the New Testament. Originally a persecutor of Christians named Saul of Tarsus, who witnessed and supported the stoning of St. Stephen, he was journeying from Jerusalem to Damascus on business when the resurrected Jesus appeared in a light that blinded Saul for three days. (Acts 9:1-29) At the top of the left lancet a beacon is inscribed with the words Jesus spoke to Saul: “Saul, why persecutest thou me?” (Acts 9:4) Blinding light from the beacon shines down on the group. The inscription reads “Suddenly there shone from Heaven a great light.” Below the inscription are the emblems of Paul, a book, indicating the scriptures surmounting a sword, the symbol of his martyrdom.\n\nThe right lancet shows St. Paul preaching to the Athenians outside the court that tried murder and corruption charges in Athens, the Areopagus (in the background is the triangular pediment of a Greek temple with columns). Paul tells the Athenians that they have an altar to an unknown god, to whom they pray in their ignorance, but the God who made the world does not live in “temples made with hands.” (Acts 17:22-24). He tells them of the Resurrection; some scoff but some want to hear more later. The inscription reads, “And hath made of one blood all nations of men.” (Acts 17:26) Below the inscription is a cross with flame behind it, recalling Paul’s words, “The Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. (Acts 13:47)\n\nMemorial: This window was given in memory of Morris Lumpkin, 5 December 1888-22 May 1933, vestryman, a lover of church music, by his wife, Frances White Lumpkin.\n\nSt. Paul’s Vision and St. Paul Before Agrippa\n\nSt. Paul’s Vision and St. Paul Before Agrippa\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on south side of the Lower Nave that depict the acts of the apostles. These windows, and the five on the north side depicting events in the life of Christ, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThe left lancet portrays St. Paul’s “vision in the night” of a Macedonian man, who begs him, ‘Come over into Macedonia and help us” (Acts 16:9). Paul and Silas were in Troas, on the coast of Asia Minor, uncertain where to preach next. To judge by the nimbus surrounding the figure’s body, he is probably an angel adorned with blond hair that is typical of Macedonians like Alexander the Great. The large Roman province of Macedonia incorporated ancient Macedonia and many other territories. The vision calls Paul to extend the preaching of the Gospel from Asia to Europe.\n\nThe bottom of the lancet shows a sword with a snake coiled around it, the symbol of St. Paul, beneath the inscription “Come over into Macedonia and help us.”\n\nThe right lancet shows Paul standing in chains with balls and chains on his feet before King Herod Agrippa I, the Roman governor of Judea, and his sister Berenice (Acts 25:23-26:32) in Caesarea, where Paul had been imprisoned for two years. Behind Agrippa and Bernice is a tent canopy topped by an eagle, the symbol of Roman rule. In the lower left is Festus with the scroll containing the charges against Paul. The ball-and-chain shackles are shown in the lower part of the window beneath the inscription, “So worship I the God of my Fathers” (Acts 24:14).\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Mary Heyward Belser, 1888-1942, by her husband and children.\n\nThe Miracle of the Woman Healed by Faith (1979)\n\nThe Miracle of the Woman Healed by Faith (1979)\n\nFound at: Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates Matt. 9:20-22 in which a woman hoping to be cured of a twelve-years’ blood disease, touches the hem of Jesus’s garment. In the left lancet, the woman kneels before Jesus, as two disciples look on. Jesus, who had been walking away from her, turns back toward her in the right lancet and heals her with his hand raised in blessing, saying, “Take heart, my daughter, your faith has healed you” (Matthew 9: 20-22). The tracery light shows a flower.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Theodore Marion DuBose, M.D. (1858-1939) and Frances Beverly Means DuBose (1862-1947) by David S. DuBose.\n\nThe Parable of the Good Samaritan (1978)\n\nThe Parable of the Good Samaritan (1978)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Luke 10:29-37, by which Jesus answers the question, “Who is my neighbor?” A man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and left him for dead.\n\nThe two robbers are shown at the top of the right lancet. Shortly after the robbers departed, a priest and then a Levite came by, shown in the background of the left lancet. Both crossed to the other side of the road and ignored the beaten man. Then a passing Samaritan bandaged the wounds of the stricken man and befriended him, as shown in the lower parts of both lancets.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was oven to the glory of God and in memory of Helen Purdy Dehon (1894-i957) and Theodore Dehon, Jr., (1895-1974), by their daughter, Elizabeth M. Dehon.\n\nSaint John Writing and Glory (1958)\n\nSaint John Writing and Glory (1958)\n\nFound at: The Nave\n\nOne of five windows on south side of the Lower Nave that depict the acts of the apostles. These windows, and the five on the north side depicting events in the life of Christ, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.\n\nThese two lancets (unlike the other pairs of lancets) should be viewed as one scene, linked by the identical backgrounds and the water at the bottom of both windows. St. John the Apostle, at the direction of an angel, receives the revelation of the risen Christ.\n\nThe left lancet shows the angel pointing as John turns his head towards the returned Jesus. John holds a quill and an open book in obedience to Jesus’s command: “Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter. What thou seest, write in a book” (Revelation 1:11). Behind John are some of the monasteries dedicated to John and the doorway entrance to the cave on the rocky island of Patmos where he had been exiled toward the end of the reign of the emperor Domitian (A.D. 81-96) and where he received the revelations.\n\nThe right lancet shows John’s vision: Surrounded by seven golden lampstands in the midst of which is Jesus, wearing a long robe down to his feet, with a golden belt. His hair is white “like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.” (Rev. 1:12-14) His feet are pointed down indicating his movement between earth and heaven. In Rev. 1:16, he holds seven stars in his right hand, while in this window he raises three fingers indicating the blessing of the trinity. In his left hand he holds a book with an Alpha on one page and an Omega on the other. His head wears a crown symbolic of Jesus as Lord and King.\n\nMemorial: This window was given through an endowment fund to the glory of God and in loving memory of Kirkman George Finlay 1877-1938, Rector of Trinity Church 1907-1921, First Bishop of the Diocese of Upper South Carolina 1922-1938. Bishop Finlay is interred in the Trinity churchyard.\n\nThe Saint John Window (1973)\n\nThe Saint John Window (1973)\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nThis window shows Saint John, with a triradiate nimbus, holding a scroll in his left hand and a cup with an emerging serpent in his right. John’s association with a chalice derives from Matt. 20:23 and Mark 10:39 in which Jesus promises John and James that they will “shall drink indeed of my cup.” The snake appears to come from an old non-Biblical legend that John was offered a cup of poisoned wine, but he blessed the wine, the poison turned into a serpent and slithered out of the cup and he drank unharmed.\n\nAt the top, the window shows an open book with quills. Below, it shows a winged eagle, the fourth beast of Revelation. St. Jerome associates this beast with John, who, “having taken up eagle’s wings and hastening toward higher matters, discusses the Word of God.”\n\nAll five windows in the narthex — four depicting the Gospel writers and the Great West Window — were created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of John Shreiner Reynolds (1887-1918) by Emily Bellinger Reynolds.\n\nThe Miracle of the Raising of Lazarus (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of the Raising of Lazarus (1981)\n\nFound at: Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the story of Jesus raising Lazarus of Bethany to life after four days of death in John 11. Jesus stands at the tomb with his right hand raised in healing. Behind him is Martha, the sister of Lazarus, who has led him to the tomb. Jesus says, “Lazarus, come forth.” In the right lancet, a standing Lazarus, wrapped in burial clothing, emerges from the tomb with his palms upraised, an ancient Christian attitude of prayer called the “orans (praying) position.”\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Mary Childs Seabrook (1897-1979) and Cotesworth Pinckney Seabrook (1897-1964) by their children: Robert C. Seabrook, Mary S. Sasnett, and Ellen S. Lovvorn.\n\nThe Parable of the Sower (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Sower (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Matthew 13:3-8, in which a sower scattered seeds on a pathway that were eaten by birds, and on stony ground, where their sprouts were scorched by the sun, and on thorns, which choked them. This is depicted in the right lancet. In the left lancet the sower casts seeds on fertile soil, which rewards him as much as a hundredfold. The window clearly illustrates the point of the parable—Christians must make themselves receptive ground for the gospel.\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Elizabeth Nicholson Nelson (1912-1981) and Patrick Henry Nelson (1910-1964) by their children Nina Nelson Smith, Elizabeth Nelson Adams, and William Shannon Nelson II.\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Stilling the Tempest (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Stilling the Tempest (1981)\n\nFound at: Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the account in Matthew 8:23-27. Jesus and the disciples board a boat to cross the Sea of Galilee moving towards modern-day Jordan. This represents the expansion of the faith beyond Jewish people to the Gentile world. During the trip a storm threatens to sink the boat. The disciples are terrified but Jesus sleeps through the storm.\n\nIn the left lancet, Jesus is about to be awakened by a disciple saying “Lord, save us: we perish.” (Matt. 8:25) In the right lancet, the disciple in the foreground seems to be trying to rouse Jesus while in the background two disciples struggle with the torn and broken sails. Jesus rebukes them saying, “‘Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?’ then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.” (Matt. 8:26)\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Helen Calhoun Adams, their mother (1900-1978), and Robert Adams VI, their brother (1933-1937), and in honor of Robert Adams, Jr., their father (1904-1983) by Julian Calhoun Adams and Weston Adams II.\n\nThe Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Luke 18:10-14 in which a Pharisee and a tax collector went to a temple to pray. The Pharisee, shown in the left lancet, thanked God that he was not an extortionist, an unjust man or an adulterer like the publican. The publican, shown in the right lancet, lowers his head asking God only to be merciful to a sinner. Jesus says, “I tell you [the publican] went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted (Luke 18:14).\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.\n\nMemorial: This window was given to the glory of God and in memory of Henrietta McWillie Nelson Weston (1906 -1977) by her husband William Weston, Jr., M.D.\n\nThe Saint Luke Window (1972)\n\nThe Saint Luke Window (1972)\n\nFound at: The Narthex\n\nThe top of the window shows a closed book and a palette with brushes. Beginning in the 8th century, Luke was said to have been the first icon painter and Guilds of St. Luke housed and protected painters.\n\n“Luke, the beloved physician.” (Colossians 4:14) is shown here with a nimbus, holding a scroll in his right hand and in his left hand a mortar and pestle. Over his shoulder he wears a horn to hold his medicines.\n\nThe lower portion of the window shows a sacrificial calf, the third creature of Revelation. The calf is associated with Luke because he began his gospel with the story of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, (Luke 1:5-80), who was murdered in the temple (Matt. 23:35). Luke’s gospel goes on to focus on the sacrifice, priesthood, and atonement of Jesus.\n\nAll five windows in the narthex — four depicting the Gospel writers and the Great West Window — were created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given in loving memory of Joan Shreiner Reynolds Faunt (1918-1969) by Emily Bellinger Reynolds.\n\nThe Parable of the Talents (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Talents (1981)\n\nFound at: North Clerestory\n\nThis window illustrates the parable in Matthew 25:14-30, in which a master, depicted in the left lancet, has returned from his travels and listens to the three servants to whom he had entrusted money. The servant who received five talents has doubled his money and is shown to the master’s left. The servant standing in the right lancet was given two talents doubled his money also, but the servant kneeling with a shovel, buried his talent in the ground and had only the one talent he had been given. The master takes the talent and gives it to the servant with ten talents, saying, “For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” (Matt. 25:29)\n\nIn August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass.

The petals radiate outward from the oculus of the window, which shows the sun setting behind a mountain, illustrating the motto of the Diocese of Upper South Carolina, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,” Psalm 121:1\n\nWith each petal the circular form of the image represents a shield, symbolizing the protection of God. The shields in the petals of this and other rose windows represent the protection of God. On each shield is an image of God from Psalm 121. Clockwise from the one o’clock position:\n\nThe keeper of mankind, “My help cometh from the Lord,” expressed by the hands of God and man.\n\nThe maker of heaven, “My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth,” expressed by stars, comet, and galaxy\n\nThe maker of earth, expressed by the earth and the moon.\n\nThe protector of man asleep, “he that keepeth thee will not slumber,” expressed by a shield above a sleeping man\n\nThe protector of man at work, “he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep,” expressed by a shield above a working man\n\nThe protector of man at worship, “the LORD is they shade upon thy right hand,” expressed by a shield above a man at prayer.\n\nThe protector by day, “The sun shall not smite thee by day,” expressed by the sun over a field.\n\nThe protector at night, “nor the moon by night,” expressed by the moon and three stars over a house.\n\nThe protection of God, “The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil,” expressed by the shield of the Lord above.\n\nThe going out, “The LORD shall preserve thy going out,” expressed by a thatched mission church.\n\nThe coming in, “and thy coming in,” expressed by a simple home.\n\nThe giver of eternity to man, “from this time forth, and even for evermore,” expressed by the symbols of resurrection—the cross and two Easter lilies.\n\nThe window was designed by Columbia attorney Augustus T.

Each petal of this window graphically presents twelve unique sayings of Jesus, (beginning at the position of one o’clock and moving clockwise).\n\n“I that speaketh unto thee am he [the Messiah]” (John 4:26) is depicted by the letters IHΣ at the heart of the sunburst.\n\n“I am the bread of life” (John 6:35) is depicted by wheat and a loaf of bread combined with the crux ansata (Latin: “cross with a handle”), after the Egyptian hieroglyph Ankh, which means “life.”\n\nAt Rev. 21:6 Jesus said “I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life.” The petal shows lambs drinking from a fountain of water pouring from a rock.\n\n“Before Abraham was, I am” (John 8:58) is depicted by the palm branch of triumph, peace, and eternal life and crown of eternal rule.\n\n“I am the light of the world” (John 8:12) is depicted by a candle lighting the globe.\n\n“I am the door” (John 10:9) is depicted by a door.\n\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16) is depicted by a hand. The hand is probably the best-known symbol of God the Father and the only one used for the first eight centuries.\n\n“I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman” (John 15:1) is depicted by a grapevine and grapes.\n\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6) is depicted by the combination of a path, a flaming torch, and the cross of life.\n\n“Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for I am” (John 13:13) is depicted by a crown and scepter.\n\n“I am the resurrection, and the life” (John 11:25) is depicted by the phoenix, a mythological bird believed by the ancients to set its nest and itself on fire when old, only to be subsequently resurrected from the ashes.\n\n“I am alpha (A) and omega (Ω), the beginning and the end, the first and the last.” (Rev. 22:13) Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the eternity of our Savior.\n\nAt the heart of the rose is the lamb of God, Agnus Dei. The lamb was a sacrificial animal in antiquity, which came to symbolize Jesus, who was sacrificed for our sins: St. John the Baptist, just after the baptism of Jesus, twice pointed him out saying, “Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world” (John 1,29,36).\n\nThis window was created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nMemorial: This window was given by the Hampton family as a memorial to all the members of the Hampton family, who have served this place since its founding in 1812.\n\nChrist's Ministry\n\nEvents in the Life of Christ\n\nThe Rose Window\n\nThe Benediction Window (1997)\n\nThe Mary and Martha Window (1992)\n\nThe First Narthex Partition\n\nThe Second Narthex Partition\n\nThe Annunciation and Adoration of the Shepherds (1958)\n\nThe Motherhood Window (1991)\n\nThe Baptism of Christ and the Calling of the Apostles (1931)\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount and Christ Charging the Apostles (1931)\n\nJesus and the Children (1907)\n\nThe Resurrection and the Ascension (1958)\n\nThe Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Walking on Water (1979)\n\nThe Parable of the Lost Sheep (1981)\n\nThe Last Supper and the Crucifixion (1958)\n\nThe Saint Matthew Window (1973)\n\nThe Coming of the Holy Spirit and the Healing of the Lame Man (1958)\n\nThe Saint Mark Window (1973)\n\nThe Parable of the Prodigal Son (1981)\n\nBaptism and Laying on of Hands (1958)\n\nThe Trinity Window (1969)\n\nThe Miracle of the Paralytic (1978)\n\nThe Parable of the Unprepared Builder (1981)\n\nSt. Paul on the Road to Damascus and St. Paul Preaching in Athens (1934)\n\nSt. Paul’s Vision and St. Paul Before Agrippa\n\nThe Miracle of the Woman Healed by Faith (1979)\n\nThe Parable of the Good Samaritan (1978)\n\nSaint John Writing and Glory (1958)\n\nThe Saint John Window (1973)\n\nThe Miracle of the Raising of Lazarus (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Sower (1981)\n\nThe Miracle of Jesus Stilling the Tempest (1981)\n\nThe Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (1981)\n\nThe Saint Luke Window (1972)"
