For the 1003 entry, for instance, the Greater Annals record a short poem describing the miraculous survival of a laborer who fell from St. Gall’s roof during repairs undertaken by the abbot, Burchard. These repairs can be read in light of the slightly earlier 1000 entry, which records that ‘our people were struck by fire’ during a storm. Though both entries are in verse, they are in different hands, and are divided by a laconic 1001 entry — in three more hands — recording the death of abbot Gerhard and the appointment of Burchard. The state of the abbey’s roof thus constitutes one of the many micronarratives present in the Greater Annals, an everyday story recording a decidedly local and even parochial concern — Burchard’s repairs are otherwise unattested — but vividly recounted, in prose and in verse and with attendant miracles, by no less than five interlocutors. In short, the story of the roof’s repairs is emblematic of the Greater Annals as a work of collective monastic remembrance — perhaps unparalleled for its period.\n\nThe Greater Annals of St. Gall are based, in their earliest passages, on the St. Gall continuation of the Annales Alamannici, which extends until 926. Substantial emendations have been made to the earlier material in the Greater Annals, however, and they cannot be said to be merely a continuation of the Annales Alamannici.2 Despite being a much-relied-upon source for Ottonian and Salian history — for the years 918–1024 they provide an entirely independent account and for 1025–1044 a detailed account which overlaps with several other well-known sources — the Greater Annals have yet to be translated into English (though there is a recent, and superlative, German translation by Roland Zingg). This introductory essay serves to familiarize the reader with the context and production of the Greater Annals, as well as highlight several of the themes of the text most useful or interesting to the medievalist audience. I especially focus on the role of the Greater Annals as an independent witness with often-diverging viewpoints to many of the important events of early medieval European history and its unique status as a repository of institutional memory and identity for the monks of St. Gall.\n\nSt. Gall in Context\n\nAccording to local tradition, the abbey of St. Gall was first founded as a hermitage by the Irish saint Gallus, a companion of Saint Columbanus, who is said to have become a hermit there in 612.3 On his death some decades later he was buried there, and the location became both a destination of pilgrimage and a shelter for the surrounding populace.4 Around 720, the site was placed in the custody of the Alemannian priest Otmar, who founded an abbey on the location.5 By the ninth century St. Gall had become a favorite recipient of both local and royal patronage, and a series of grants over the course of the 800s gave the monks of St. Gall independence from the bishopric of Constance and the right to freely elect their abbots.6 As its lands grew, so too did the political influence of its abbots. Abbot Gozbert (816–37) rebuilt the abbey and secured the canonization of its founder Otmar; Abbot Grimald (841–72) was chancellor and chaplain to Louis the German (r. 843–76) as well as abbot of Weissenburg.7 This culminated with the career of Abbot Salomon (890–919), also (as Salomon III) the Bishop of Constance, who acted as an advisor to four kings.8 The fortunes of the abbey declined following several disasters — most notably the sack by Hungarian raiders in 926 and a fire in 937 — but by the beginning of the eleventh century St. Gall was again a preeminent center for learning and scholarly production, especially under Abbot Burchard II and his schoolmaster Notker Labeo.9\n\nSt. Gall acts, for many historians, as the example par excellence of Carolingian monastic culture.10 This is no doubt a function of the extraordinary wealth of manuscript evidence which survives at the abbey: the Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen today contains some 2,000 manuscripts, of which at least 400 are pre-millennium; hundreds more produced in the St. Gall scriptorium have been distributed to libraries across Europe.11 Of this surviving corpus, a significant portion concerns the history of the Abbey itself. We possess multiple saints’ lives concerning not only the founders of the monastery, Gall and Otmar, but other figures of historical significance like Notker the Stammerer (d. 912) and the anchoress-saint Wiborada (d. 926).12 The Casus Sancti Galli, a chronicle of the monastery’s history begun by the monk Ratpert in the ninth century, continued c. 1050 by Ekkehard IV up to 972, and then sporadically continued up until the fourteenth century, presents an organized and at times highly stylized account of events at the monastery.13 The survival of a rich collection of charters, over 800 of which date from before the millennium, allows for the intricate reconstruction of social and economic history in the region.14 Finally, and uniquely among monasteries of this era, we have the famous Plan of St. Gall, a schematic drawing from around 820 possibly intended to be used in the rebuilding of the monastery. This plan has engendered much scholarly debate about the nature and function of Carolingian monasticism.15 The inclusion of an external school on the Plan has also contributed to a lively debate about the nature of lay education in the Carolingian era.16\n\nAt the same time, St. Gall also had a tremendous scholarly and artistic output. Beyond the plentiful saints’ lives, St. Gall was also responsible for Notker Balbulus’ Gesta Karoli magni, the aforementioned Casus Sancti Galli tradition, and numerous biblical commentaries, hymns, and poems.17 Notker Labeo, the schoolmaster in the early eleventh century, is often regarded as the father of German literature for his sponsorship of a broad vernacular translation program and the composition of many vernacular poems.18 The abbey is also vitally important to historians of medieval sacred music and book illumination; forms developed at St. Gall can be found across the continent.19 Historically, the Latin epic Waltharius has also been considered a production of the abbey, although more recent investigations have problematized this identification and raised the possibility of other places of authorship.20\n\nSt. Gall’s annalistic tradition is no less important, though it has received less scholarly attention in its own right, perhaps because of the allure of subjects such as the Casus Sancti Galli, the Plan of St. Gall, or Waltharius. No less than eight separate annals are associated with St. Gall; these range from shorter productions of merely a few entries to the much more substantial Annales Alamannici and the Greater Annals of St. Gall. These latter, which are related, number among the most important historical sources for Carolingian and post-Carolingian Europe. Indeed, the Greater Annals especially might be counted among those annals most familiar to a non-medievalist audience, given their somewhat provocative appearance in Hayden White’s work on narrative.21 It is thus all the stranger that they have not thus far received an English translation. This lacuna has been made even starker by two recent publications, Roland Zingg’s excellent edition of the St. Gall annalistic tradition in 2019 as well as Emily Albu and Natalia Lozovsky’s translation of the Casus Sancti Galli of Ekkehard IV, which shares material with the Greater Annals, in 2021.22 Both publications highlight the remaining work to be done on the Greater Annals and the continued necessity of bringing the work, and St. Gall’s unique place in history, to the attention of new audiences. The goal of the present translation, then, is to facilitate the accessibility of the annals to researchers, instructors, and students.\n\nManuscripts, Composition, and Authorship of the Annals\n\nThe Annals are extant in three manuscripts. The earliest, St. Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 915, which includes the annals at pp. 196–236, is the autograph.23 St. Gallen 915 was the book used for the abbey’s officium capituli, the reading from select texts and commemoration of the dead at Prime.24 As such, it included not only the Greater Annals but two martyrologies, the necrology of St. Gall, and the Rule of St. Benedict, as well as other important records like the confraternity agreements between St. Gall and Reichenau and extensive computus tables.25 Readers of the Greater Annals would thus have read them in light of other texts, especially the necrology, which recorded the deaths of many of the figures described in the annals. A second copy of the annals can be found in the twelfth-century St. Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 453, an updated officium book which contained many of the same texts as St. Gallen 915.26 The annals in St. Gallen 453 were copied directly from the autograph in St. Gallen 915.27 The final manuscript, Wien Österreichische Nationabibliothek Cod. Ser. n. 4427, fols. 9v–37r, is a very late copy of the autograph, from the eighteenth century.28\n\nThe autograph version of the annals in St. Gallen 915 is a fantastic hodgepodge, written by at least thirty-three hands over the course of more than a century and incorporating a complex variety of form and content. It is written in a single hand down to halfway through the 955 entry.29 This portion of the text is primarily based on the Annales Alamannici (and its St. Gall continuation), itself a composite text first written at Murbach in the eighth century and continued at Reichenau up to 876, after which it finally came to St. Gall.30 The Greater Annals are far from a mere copy in this period, however; numerous additional entries have been inserted, covering especially subjects related to the abbey of St. Gall, and previous entries have been excerpted and truncated, qualifying this portion of the Greater Annals as a work in its own right.31 From 919 the Greater Annals are entirely independent, and the portion of the work from this point to 955 seems to comprise the creation of a single author.32\n\nFrom the middle of the 955 entry through the 1024 entry the hand changes at minimum every few entries, and sometimes within the same entry.33 The topics of these entries do not display a consistent narrative and do not appear to follow logically from one another; it seems that entries for this period were recorded on an ad hoc basis by a rapidly-shifting cast of authors. At least four of these entries, and possibly more, were definitely much later insertions rather than contemporary records.34[34] This portion of the text is thus a bricolage, a collaborative effort with little apparent in the way of order or consistent theme. This section also features one of the most distinctive and interesting phenomena of the Greater Annals, their tendency to slip into verse. From 971, the Greater Annals include no fewer than fifteen poems written in dactylic hexameter —in twelve different hands.35 These entries constitute stand-alone poems on a wide variety of subjects, from natural disasters and political events to the death and appointment of abbots and the repair efforts to the monastery roof in 1003. This section also includes a number of erasure marks apparent in the digitized manuscript, which would be a fruitful avenue for future research into the manuscript.36 I have endeavored to note these in the translation.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 1025 entry through the end of 1044, the Greater Annals are again in a single hand.37 This period of the text, covering the reign of Emperor Conrad II and the first few years of Henry III, has deep structural parallels to Wipo of Burgundy’s Vita Chuonradi imperatoris and especially Hermann of Reichenau’s Chronicon.38 Following the work of Harry Bresslau in the nineteenth century, scholars have conceived of these three texts as deriving from a single original work of annals, traditionally termed the Swabian World-Chronicle.39 The development of this text and its relatives, however, is not well understood, and there are several problems with the assumed direct descent from a lost work of annals to these three works.40 For instance, while the Vita Chuonradis has structural parallels to the Greater Annals, it excludes much of the specific information, including personal names and the place-names; at other points, such as a miracle description in 1037, the two match almost exactly.41 Hermann’s Chronicon, on the other hand, has obvious similarities to the 1025–1044 section of the Greater Annals, but also has similar entries from earlier than 1025, suggesting that Hermann may have drawn directly on the Greater Annals rather than on a hypothetical predecessor.42 Despite controversies regarding the origin of the text, this section presents a trove of information regarding imperial history and the personal relationships of the imperial elite with the emperor. Here the sense of St. Gall’s monastic identity which pervades the earlier portions somewhat fades away; at times local history entirely disappears in favor of imperial narrative, though a few entries still note the deaths and appointments of abbots or the visit of imperial figures to the abbey.43 A solitary final entry in 1056, describing the death of Emperor Henry III, concludes the Greater Annals.\n\nIt is thus misleading to speak of the authorship of the Greater Annals, or really even consider it a single ‘work’ with a single purpose. These were the product of generations of communal effort, occasionally harnessed toward a particular point but more often disparate, bricolage, and hodgepodge. The Annals as written fade in and out of narrativity, at times driving home particular points or arguments but at others seeming to represent a more diffuse communal memory of the brothers of St. Gall. The famous dictum of Hayden White that the Greater Annals did not constitute a narrative might have been formulated very differently had he looked, say, at the 888–955 section of the annals, which sets out the tale of the invading Hungarians up until their final defeat; conversely, it is absolutely confirmed by the narrativeless chaos of the 955–1024 section.44\n\nThe Greater Annals have a long tradition of study in the modern era. Melchior Goldast published the editio princeps in 1606, though he was unaware of the autograph and only utilized St. Gallen 453 for this edition.45 In 1826 Ildefons von Arx, then the librarian at St. Gall, published an edition for the first volume of the Monumenta Germaniae Historia which for the first time utilized both medieval manuscripts.46 The 1826 edition continues to be the most widely used version because of its wide accessibility, though the 1884 edition by Carl Henking added significant annotation and commentary.47 The Greater Annals were not edited again until 2019, when Roland Zingg published his study of St. Gall’s annalistic tradition.48 The Zingg edition improves on previous editions in several respects, especially in accurately noting the dating system and changes in hand in the original manuscripts, as well as depicting its various idiosyncrasies (of which there are many).49 Zingg also provided a translation into German on facing pages; this is the first full translation of the Greater Annals into a modern language.50 The Zingg edition and translation mark a new epoch in the study of the annals: without them, the current effort would have been entirely impossible.\n\nThemes and Analysis\n\nFrom a purely utilitarian perspective, the Greater Annals are useful to medieval historians, as are their source the Annales Alamannici, because they often represent independent or divergent opinions on political events. Alemannia was very rarely the center of the Carolingian or post-Carolingian world; scandals, controversies, or even simple politics were often looked at from a different perspective from the texts to which historians are accustomed.51 To take an interesting example, the Greater Annals entry for 876 notes that ‘Emperor Charles the Second began to rule’. It is unclear from the text as written whether the entry means Charles ‘the Bald,’ who was crowned emperor in 875, or Charles ‘the Fat,’ for whom 876 marks rather the beginnings of his reign as king of Alemannia after the death of his father Louis the German. While Charles ‘the Fat’ would indeed go on to become emperor, and to reunify the Carolingian empire through a series of surprise inheritances, this would not happen until 881 and 884 respectively.52 The Annales Alamannici, upon which the Greater Annals are based in this period, do not mention either Charles in 876, though they do note the elevation of Charles ‘the Fat’ to imperator in 881.53 Depending on which Charles we think this is, the Greater Annals annalist has then shifted the focus and transformed the narrative of his source material in different ways, either crowning Charles ‘the Fat’ emperor from his first appearance or inserting Charles ‘the Bald,’ otherwise unreferenced in the Greater Annals. The resulting product thus becomes either a piece of Alemannian patriotism highlighting the career of Charles ‘the Fat’ or a piece of Carolingian cosmopolitanism situating St. Gall within the greater Carolingian world.\n\nPerhaps the classic example of Alemannian perspective in the Annals is its treatment of the ascent of Henry the Fowler, king of East Francia from 919 to 936. The Greater Annals in the early tenth century, like their source the St. Gall continuation of the Annales Alemannici, are generally careful to note the comings and goings of East Frankish kings.54 They describe the death of Arnulf and the succession of his son Louis in 900, the death of the king of Lotharingia, Arnulf’s natural son Zwentibold, in 901, the death of Louis and Conrad I’s election in 911, and the death of Conrad in 918. This makes it all the stranger that the annals ignore the election of the Saxon king Henry the Fowler, traditionally dated to 919. The 919 entry, which does not rely on any information from the Annales Alamannici, instead describes a war between Burchard, dux of Alemannia, and Rudolf, king of Burgundy. Henry does not appear until 925, when he is recorded granting the abbacy of St. Gall to Engilbert — itself an odd entry, given that Engilbert was already ‘made abbot’ in the 924 entry.\n\nOne could take this tendency to deviate from ‘mainstream’ sources of history as evidence of a massaged and propagandistic account. But taking the Greater Annals as a distortion of truth is too simplistic — it must be considered instead that they represented an alternative viewpoint. Especially for cases like Henry the Fowler, the Greater Annals provide valuable evidence that the political narratives we have come to accept might be underlaid by a more complicated reality. Johannes Fried famously used the absence of notation regarding Henry’s election — and the corresponding absence in the continued Annales Alamannici — to argue that Henry’s authority may have been only gradually recognized outside of Saxony.55 Another possibility is that the spotty updating of the annals at this time led to an oversight in the inclusion of relevant information; the 955 annalist may not have had access to the details about exactly when Henry had come to the throne. Whatever the case, it is interesting that the founding moment of the nascent Saxon dynasty — by 955 well-ensconced as not only Germany’s power du jour but Europe’s as well — was not included in this text.\n\nBy 936, firmly in the period of the annals composed solely by the 955 annalist, the focus on East Frankish kingship had returned — the annals record that ‘King Henry died’ and ‘his son Otto succeeded him in royal power’. Even in the reign of Otto, however, the Alemannic perspective of the 955 annalist shines through. A good example is the 953 rebellion of Liudolf, Otto I’s eldest son and dux of Alemannia since 949. Liudolf had married Ida, the daughter of the previous dux of Alemannia, making him in some sense a hereditary successor.56 The best-known version of this story, described by Widukind of Corvey, depicts Liudolf as a jealous plotter, working against his father out of fear of being pushed out by Otto’s new wife Adelaide.57 In the Greater Annals, however, the analysis is much more neutral; the annalist merely writes that ‘discord arose’ between Otto and Liudolf, papering over the act of rebellion entirely.58 A previous entry, in 948, had described the royal heir as ‘dear to God and all the Saints’ on the occasion of his visit to St. Gall. This favoritism may have been motivated by loyalty to Liudolf as the dux of Alemannia, although it is also possible that the different opinions are down to different time frames — the Greater Annals annalist likely wrote in 955, when Liudolf was still alive, while Widukind wrote ten years after his death in 957.\n\nBy comparison, the rebellion of the Alemannian dux Ernest against his stepfather Emperor Conrad, from 1025–30, is told with much less sympathy to Ernest. Ernest and his co-conspirators are depicted in no uncertain terms as rebels, authors of an attempt ‘prohibited by God’ who would eventually be removed from office.59 This is, however, a fairer account than the (related) description given by Wipo of Burgundy, which twice describes Ernest as rebelling diabolo suadente, ‘at the instigation of the devil’, and depicts Ernest’s mother Empress Gisela taking the side of the emperor against Ernest in 1032.60 Ernest was even more of an Aleman than Liudolf; his like-named father was dux of Alemannia from 1012 to 1015, and through his maternal line he was a descendent of the Conradines who had intermittently held the office since 926. It is possible to take the unfavorable account of his actions as representing the further unity of the empire at the beginning of the eleventh century: as imperial power increased, local loyalties proved less durable than they once had been. Given the possible derivation of this account from a lost annal, however, we must also consider that the biases of this unknown author are equally unknown — and in any case, by the time of the lost annals’ composition, Ernest had been dead for more than a decade.\n\nIndeed, another historical subtheme detectible in the longue durée of the annals is the changing nature of political power in Alemannia. This undercurrent is in fact present from the very first entry in 709, which describes the death of one dux Godfrid. Godfrid was one of the last semi-independent Aleman rulers; his death came in the middle of a protracted fight against Carolingian influence.61 Unlike its source material the Annales Alemmanici, which begin with the death of Pippin II’s son Drogo and therefore center ‘national‘ concerns from the beginning, the Greater Annals therefore consciously focus on local matters from their very start.62 For the next two centuries, local Alemannian political power takes a backseat, though the Aleman Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, is at least mentioned.63 The true story of the Alemannian duces begins in the tenth century, with the struggle for dominance of Alemannia among several competing groups, most especially the Conradine and Hunfriding families. The depiction of these leaders changes over the course of the text; early duces like Ercharger and Burchard I are depicted as quasi-royal warrior-dukes, while later figures, especially Hermann III and Ernest I who both died tragically early, are depicted as models of elite, youthful manhood.64\n\nThe place where we can get the closest to sustained authorial intent in the Greater Annals is in the sections composed or altered by the 955 annalist. That the later pieces of this section, especially from 888 onwards, were intended to act as a unified whole can be seen by the annalist’s treatment of the Hungarians. From their introduction in the 888 entry, the Hungarians are consistently referred to as Agareni, ‘Hagarenes’— that is, descendants of the biblical Hagar, often identified in the period with Arabs or Muslims.65 That this was a conscious stylistic choice can be seen from the fact that the annalist altered the entries from 892 to 919, which he had copied from the Alemannic Annals, from Ungri to Agareni.66 The appellation cannot be said to have been especially accurate — no other source from the period connects the Hungarians to Islam, and they do not seem to have been historically Muslim or to have incorporated Islamicate cultural elements.67 The misascribed identity was even noticed by Ekkehard IV, who noted in a gloss on Orosius that ‘some of our idiots now call [the Hungarians] Hagarenes’.68\n\nRather than an identification aiming for accuracy, however, the depiction of the Hungarians as Agareni can be taken as an argument for the eschatological significance of the fight against the Hungarians. The 955 annalist wrote in the aftermath of the sacking of St. Gall by the Hungarians in 926; he might well have been at the monastery when this occurred.69 With the communal memory of this traumatic event in mind, it seems that the annalist rewrote the conflict with the Hungarians in the key of apocalypse, building up to the climactic defeat of the Hungarians by Otto in 955 itself.70 Given that the defeat of the Hungarians was the final entry in the 955 annalist’s hand, this probably functioned as the instigating event for the copying and updating of the annals. At the annalist’s crafting, the history of the early tenth century became a world-historical struggle between Christianity and Islam. So too does the Hungarian threat connect to the order of government in the Christian world — the 955 annalist dates the first coming of the Hungarians to 888, implicitly connecting it to the deposition of the Alemannian Charles ‘the Fat’ by Arnulf of Carinthia.71 In 892 he again blames Arnulf, writing that he ‘unleashed the Hagarenes from where they were enclosed.’ Interestingly, the annalist appears not to have noticed the first reference to the Hungarians in the copied 863 entry, where they are described as Huns. He thus introduces the Hungarians twice, once in 863 and once in 888.\n\nThe Greater Annals are also an excellent source for the understanding of local, monastic history in the Middle Ages. Notes regarding the community of St. Gall continue throughout the course of the text, beginning with simple entries regarding the deaths and appointments of abbots, but growing over the course of the annals to include such fascinating tidbits as the enclosure of anchorites and the visits of kings and members of the royal family to the monastery. Many of these entries, especially in the bricolage 955–1024 section, revolve around a well investigated theme of monastic communal identity — anxiety surrounding the boundary between the sacred space of the cloister and the secular world outside. To monks of this period, the cloister, a square of specialized buildings surrounding a central courtyard which was inaccessible to laymen in nearly every circumstance, represented a retreat from the world.72 A pair of entries in 965 and 966, for example, written at the same time sometime after 1050, recapitulate the well-known story from Ekkehard IV’s Casus Sancti Galli of the reformist abbot Ruodman sneaking into St. Gall’s cloister to search for evidence that the monks were breaking the rule of St. Benedict. Belle Tuten has suggested that the final moment of this episode, in which Ruodman hides in the St. Gall latrine, can be interpreted as showing Ruodman’s suspicion of illicit sexual behavior.73 Whether this is the case or not, the episode certainly belongs within the context of tenth-century struggles over monastic reform; Ruodman sought to prove that the St. Gall monks were insufficiently strict in their keeping of the rule — though he violated it himself by entering the cloister in secret. The importance of the privacy and secrecy of the cloister is reemphasized by a long verse entry in 1004 which describes the monks sleeping after a meal on the Saturday before Easter, noting that ‘by divine law, no one from the laity sneaks in there’.\n\nA final theme which appears as a notable undercurrent throughout the whole course of the annals is the experience of natural phenomena as marvels, miracles, and portents within the monastic community.74 Every section of the Annals, including the earliest pieces adapted from the Annales Alemannici, is full of earthquakes, thunderstorms, floods, and comets. These are often implied to have a causal relationship with events on earth. Thus the deaths of Eberhard of Franconia and Giselbert of Lotharingia in 939, for instance, are presaged by an eclipse of the sun. In another entry, the decision of Kerhilt to became an anchoress in 952 is set against two of the ‘greatest thunderstorms’ hitting the monastery, but doing no damage. The implication is that the holy enclosure of Kerhilt protected the monastic community from the ravages of the storm. The death of Louis the Pious in 840 comes with an eclipse that also presages the civil war and division of the empire by his sons; a comet seen in 975 was immediately followed by the deaths of three St. Gall monks. In 995 civil war in Bavaria and Burgundy as well as war with the Slavs in the northeast are paired with drought and a cattle plague.\n\nPrinciples of Translation\n\nThe language of the annals is not difficult, but it is decidedly uneven; especially the intermittent poetic entries can present a level of linguistic ambiguity that makes grasping their meaning challenging. Where this is the case, I have generally relied on Zingg’s translation; places where my reading differs substantially from Zingg’s are marked in the notes. While I have endeavored to supply a literal translation of the Latin, in places where this would make the English impenetrable, I have opted instead for an idiomatic translation that preserves the sense, rather than the literal meaning, of the original. I have generally translated the present perfect tense, which sits awkwardly in English historical prose, as simple past. With the goal of conveying the sense of brevity which pervades many of the more abbreviated entries, I have followed previous translators in excluding indefinite articles from these entries; the first two words of the annals, hiemps dura, are thus translated ‘hard winter’ rather than ‘a hard winter.’75 I have left terms for which the translation into English tends to be unhelpful or misleading untranslated. The primary example of this is the term dux; a translation of ‘duke’ implies to the modern reader a rigidity and structure to the system of titulature and landholding which was absolutely not the case for the majority of the period, while the more literal ‘leader’ obscures the ways in which the term had begun to be used as a proper title. Ducatus is likewise left untranslated; the term in the period did not yet have the sense of full-fledged ‘duchy’ or ‘dukedom’ but had become more institutionalized than simply ‘authority,’ ‘status’ or ‘position’. Miles is always translated as ‘warrior’, to avoid the anachronistic implications of ‘soldier’ or ‘knight’. Regulus is translated as ‘kinglet’ to preserve its pejorative implications; princeps as ‘ruler’ or ‘leader’ based on context. I have translated comes, which connected with the administrative unit of the pagus had a more regular meaning than dux over the period covered by the annals, as ‘count’. Names of people have been standardized in cases where this is usual practice (e.g. Charles for Carolus, Louis for Hludowicus); names of places have been standardized across the board. I have supplied explanatory notes for matters which might be ambiguous from the text alone, while also attempting not to overburden the text with annotation.\n\nThis translation is based on the text of the autograph manuscript, St. Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 915, and excludes entries which only occur in the later manuscripts. Because we possess the autograph, and because of the importance the compositional process of the text holds to its interpretation, I have inserted notes on the nature of the manuscript, such as erasures or corrections, where possible. I have noted brief impositions by a different hand in <angle brackets> and places where the hand changes permanently with ||. Line breaks in verse are noted by /.\n\nTranslation\n\n709 Hard winter.

The same day in the region of the Gauls an innumerable army of Saracens was completely destroyed by a certain queen named Tota, except their king and 49 men with him.168 The same year Eberhard, dux of the Fanks, was killed, and Giselbert, dux of the Lotharingians, ended his life in the Rhine.169\n\n940 A hard year, deficient in produce.170\n\n941 A miraculous sign appeared in the heavens, and there was a mortality of cattle.\n\n942 Thieto abandoned his abbacy and Cralo, his uterine brother, succeeded him on Tuesday, May 30.171\n\n943 The whole army of the Hagarenes was killed by the Bavarians.172\n\n944 An earthquake occurred on the Tuesday after Easter, around cockcrow on May 16.

Alawic of Reichenau, abbot of blessed memory, began to suffer a paralyzing disease.\n\n958 The venerable Abbot Cralo departed his life. Burchard succeeded him, a noble man born from a lineage of ancient kings, wise and beautiful and fine in appearance.190 The same year Alawic, abbot of Reichenau, died and in his place Ekkhard was placed over that same monastery, a place of delights.191\n\n959 A hard year, and in many regions a disappointing harvest, and many died from hunger. Bertrata192 || was confined in a cell [i.e., became an anchoress] at Saint George.193\n\n960\n\n961 || King Otto made a second campaign into Italy with a great army in the month of August.\n\n962 The same king was consecrated by Pope Octavian on the purification of St Mary, a Sunday.194\n\n963\n\n964\n\n965195 || Ruodman abbot of Reichenau entered the cloister at night and in secret, so that, if he was able to uncover something approximating an accusation, he might make it public; thus he entered as a wolf into a sheepfold. But having been caught, discovered by the shrewdness of the monk Ekkehard, who bore a lantern before him. He [Ruodman] was expelled, seeking many forgivenesses, by no means without shame. And this is what he was plotting:196\n\n966 Arrival and entrance of eight of the bishops and just as many of the abbots to the monastery of St. Gall to examine our life and our observation of the rule [of St. Benedict]. By the gift of God, when they depart they will charitably give the best testimony, as they promised the brothers.197\n\n967 Thietbert the priest died.198\n\n968 || This year an eclipse of the sun occurred on December 22, on the 28th day of the moon, on the third hour of the day.\n\n969 A furious whirlwind appeared with great ruin to the buildings and the trees on the third of August.199\n\n970\n\n971 || This year the benign Notker was made abbot./The monthly moon, which changed fifteen day before the kalends/of the month of Theseus, marked when he was about to come.200\n\n972201\n\n973 || The august Emperor Otto and dux Burchard and Bishop Odalric and his nephew Adalbero and Count Odalric and the monk Ekkehard in that year retired from this world.202\n\n|| What portion you will have given has been what you wished to give/seven or even eight times over, oh holy God.203\n\n974204\n\n975 || A comet was seen in the time of autumn. Soon followed the death of Abbot Notker, and of his predecessor Burchard and Notker the doctor.205\n\n976 Ymmo was ordained abbot.206 In this year serious contention arose regarding the kingdom between emperor Otto and his nephew Henry dux of Bavaria, son of Henry.207\n\n977\n\n978 || Lothar king of the Franks, acting contentiously against emperor Otto regarding the borders of his kingdom, invaded Aachen, as if it was the seat of the kingdom of his fathers, and also seized the land between the Moselle and the Rhine which was taken hold of in the reign of Otto [the Great].208 Otto [II] immediately led 30,000 horsemen into Francia against him, and wasting it hostilely, made a most famous expedition.209\n\n979 || Gebhard was made bishop.210\n\n980 || Bertrata, having died in her enclosure, sought the heavenly place./Hartker soon after bound himself to his cave.211\n\n981212\n\n982 || Emperor Otto, not satisfied with the borders of his father, while he was at Rome, departed to occupy Campania, Lucania, Calabria, Apulia, and all the further parts of Italy up to the sea of the Sicilians and Trapani. Because of this the Constantinopolitan emperor, under whose rule lay this whole land, first tried fruitlessly to urge him from what he had begun through envoys.213 Then he led the Saracens from Sicily and other islands of the sea and the borders of Africa and Egypt against him [Otto] in battle. With these [Otto] fought unsuccessfully. For determining, when he noticed a few men on the shore of the sea like bandits, that they came for plundering, he attacked with a small group to take them by surprise. Then surrounded by a boundless multitude, which had concealed itself by night in the mountains, with everyone in his army having fled or been killed or captured, [Otto] scarcely escaped by ship to a certain castle of his. We have seen, however, many of the captives who returned after, just as many laity as churchmen, one of whom was the bishop of Vercelli, weakened by long imprisonment in Alexandria.214\n\n983 In this year the emperor, thinking to avenge himself on those Saracens who live in Sicily, wished to invade Sicily by the ruse of Darius, a certain king of the Persians, with a bridge made of linked ships just as he [Darius] invaded Greece, but he was prevented by his premature death and burial in Rome. His son Otto ruled in his place, the third of this name, at four years of age, with whom at the same time ruled his mother Theophanu, whom his father received from the nobles of the Greeks as a wife.215\n\n984 || Here at a mature age that father passed from life/to the peace of the fatherland; YMMO216 passed away today./Our people should vigilantly remember this one with good reason:/many memorials to him remain in the place of Gall.217\n\n985218\n\n986219\n\n987\n\n988\n\n989 || A bright comet appeared on the day of Saint Lawrence.220\n\n990 || Abbot Odalric left his life, and Gerhard was put in his place.221 And the monk Ekkehard died.222\n\n991 || Faillanus Scottus of blessed memory departed from this world.223 || And empress Theophanu died in the ninth year of her widowhood with many nobles of her kingdom.\n\n992\n\n993\n\n994\n\n995 || Henry dux of the Bavarians, son of Henry, died. Civil war preceded his death, with the ruin of many of the nobles of the Bavarians. This year Rudolf in Burgundy, who succeeded his father Conrad in the kingdom, having attempted to deprive certain of his own [family] of their paternal inheritance, was attacked by them.224 Then this kinglet, although he had an extensive army, was nevertheless easily defeated and driven to flight. Also a noteworthy year for the excessive dryness of the air, with many cattle in this region killed, and many men also.225 For to such a degree were all the rivers of Europe drained that almost none were not full of shallows. Between those Saxons and those Slavs who are called Weletabi, slaughtering with mutual carnage and fire; they disturbed the whole of Germania between the Danube and the place of the ocean to the greatest degree.226\n\n996\n\n997227\n\n998 || In the month of February a comet was seen, and, receding not far from the sun, for a few days it appeared around daybreak.\n\n999228\n\n1000229 || It thundered from the height of the heavens, our people were struck by fire/but no one was harmed. Praise to you, Christ God! ||Amen!\n\n1001 ||Abbot Gerhard ||died this day.\n\n|| The Lord has entrusted our management to Burchard/A man who has already prepared himself for everything.230\n\n1002 || Emperor Otto died in Rome without an heir. Henry, of the royal lineage and also dux of the Bavarians, third by this name, succeeded him. Hermann, dux of Alemannia and Alsace, was trying to divide the kingdom with him by force, and to gain a part of it.231 But with the matter unfinished, having attempted revenge on those who agreed with the king against him in Strasbourg, [Hermann] invaded the city and ordered it plundered, and setting the worst example violated the sacred places. Soon subjugated by the king, he did not complete a year from that day. His son, a small boy, the cousin of the king, was ordained dux by the people.232\n\n1003 || A new matter: while Burchard restored to Gallus his roofs,/a peasant fell headfirst from the highest point./He offered our people a much too pitiable spectacle./But after he fell, he lifted up his head and sat up./Marvelously, he rose whole through Gallus and praised him.\n\n1004 With the final preparations for Easter made solemnly in the spirit on Holy Saturday/the brothers received accustomed sleep after the meal./A silence led by faith sought our innermost spaces/into which, by divine law, no layman enters unknown./By the exertions of the fathers, an altar devoted in these [spaces] is potent:/it is said that there Gallus has his everlasting rest/He himself taught by his appearances that one should seek him there:/the father appeared, as he had taught, and loosened their tongues.233\n\n1005 Behold, hunger — never was any through the ages more ferocious.\n\n1006 || A new star appeared of unaccustomed brightness, glittering in form and lashing the eyes, not without terror. In what a wonderful manner it was at times more contracted, at times more expanded, and occasionally extinguished. It was seen however for three months near the eastern horizon, beyond all signs which are visible in the heavens.\n\n1007 A serious plague, which suddenly ravaged the populace with widespread death.234\n\n1008 || Kerhilt, raw and green before God, but an elder by age/died in the cloister, unlocking the prison of her flesh.\n\n1009\n\n1010\n\n1011 || The anchorite Hartker is changed for the better, as I hope./Let him be at your right hand on the eighth day, good Christ!\n\n1012 || This boy dux Hermann is placed among his fathers;/then the man, his brother-in-law Ernest, takes up the emblems of office.235\n\n1013 Henry in Italy, with chosen soldiers, at Rome/scarcely having considered it, was made and created Caesar.236/These matters accomplished just as he determines, he returned from there/and part of the people of that land soon defected from him/after Hartwin was already defiling the Scepter for a while.237/Sorrowful comets burned in an uncommon way/for a long time, indeed, through different places:/now in the middle of the earth, now the interior below the east/now it concealed itself beyond the arctic pole./And a plague without name followed, wasting bodies/seething the intestines, then flowing with blood.\n\n1014\n\n1015 || Old Kotelint, her finished days worth lamenting/went up to the heavenly groom, for whom she interred herself in life./238\n\nIt causes repentance and sorrow, it grieves and pains, it stupefies, it trembles:/a solitary death without precedent happened by unfortunate chance./I would never want to know the tormented beast of the forest/I would prefer quivers and arrows broken entirely/than the youth of dux Ernest, wrongly cut down in its bloom./O, stop the hand guiding the wavering spear/from piercing our peaceable [dux] rather than the deer!/Although you would by no means commit any crime by free will,/the blood of the dux, companion, was borne out by a faithful friend./Peace to the dux, and Father, who is a lover of gentle peace,/may you number him among your peacemakers.239\n\n1016\n\n1017\n\n1018\n\n1019\n\n1020\n\n1021 || The whole globe was shaken by an earthquake from every direction;/horrid portents sounded, like a split in the abyss.\n\n1022 || Emperor Henry, having invaded Apulia with mighty force, was received honorably and splendidly by the rejoicing Beneventines; and forced Troia, Capua, Salerno, and Naples, cities of his empire defecting to the Greeks, to surrender. Troia, well-defended with her strong men and with every military preparation, became a longer delay and a sticking point for victory. Nevertheless, although, damaged, she damaged and wounded many in her defense and killed very many, in the third month after she was besieged, she gave her hand as a supplicant to the emperor [i.e. surrendered], and he promised her safety and grace in victory, having given an oath of guarantee. And having accomplished these things he returned, leading away the ruler of Capua with him into custody. But around the departure from Italy, a plague afflicted his army and consumed the majority, so that it is not possible to remember how the body of the Roman Empire was so destitute of its limbs without misery and sadness. A horrible summer, with more thunderstorms and terrifying lighting than mortals are accustomed to, and a movement of wind thundering from the east shook buildings and tore trees up by their roots. Lord Abbot Burchard, most elegant mirror of the holy church, and Ymmo and Burchard, youths of good nature, died on this campaign. Notker, the most learned and benevolent man in our memory, Heribert and the two Rudperts, men of the highest innocence, Dietrich, and Liudolt || died with the disease raging widely.240 Also Rudhard, bishop of Constance died and Heimo succeeded him, and Thietbald was made abbot.241\n\n1023\n\n1024 Pope Benedict died.242 Emperor Henry died. And Conrad was consecrated in the kingdom at Mainz on the birth of saint Mary.243\n\n1025 || The savage kindling of contention arose on the sacrosanct day of Easter at Augsburg between king Conrad and his cousin Conrad.244 Also Ernest, his cousin, dux of Alemannia, and Count Welfhard, after having united with him [the second Conrad], dared to rebel against the king at the same time.245 But this rash enterprise, having been prohibited by God, had no effect.246\n\n1026 King Conrad celebrated Christmas in Aachen, and having entered Italy around springtime, subjugated nearly the whole of it on this side of Rome to himself, with Luca alone resisting him with margrave Reginhero.247 Heimo bishop of Constance died, and Warman was appointed to the same church.248\n\n1027 The aforementioned king, coming to Rome, was ordained emperor of the Romans by the blessed Pope John on the holy day of Easter.249 Returning from there through Alemannia, he held a public assembly at Ulm. And there he received dux Ernest (that is, his stepson) and Count Welfhard and the others accused of treason, who surrendered to him, and he decided to transfer them to various places for safekeeping. Also, the castle which is called Kyburg, besieged for three months as Count Werinhero resisted at length and in vain, was captured by the same king.250 At the same time Empress Gisela, having entered the monastery of St. Gall with her son Henry and given presents most kindly, obtained fraternity there.251\n\n1028 The same Henry, the son of the emperor, with his father present, was crowned at Aachen on the most sacred day of Easter, anointed with oil by Pilgrim, Archbishop of Cologne.252\n\n1029\n\n1030 Ernest dux of the Alemannians, having effected a rebellion against his stepfather the emperor again, lost favor along with his ducatus, and Hermann, his brother, acquired the same ducatus, with his mother the empress having obtained it by entreaties.253 The emperor invaded Hungary and ravaged the same region from the nearest part up to the Fisca river. Meanwhile, Ernest the former dux took hold of a certain castle which is called Falchenstein with the aforementioned Werinhero, his soldier, and afflicted neighboring regions with no minor slaughter of their inhabitants. But a certain count called Manegold entered battle with him, suffering this in place of the emperor. In this [battle] both of them died and very many others on both sides were killed on the octave of Saint Lawrence.254\n\n1031\n\n1032 With King Rudolf having died, Odo, the son of his sister, pursued the kingdom of the Burgundians with a strong company, as if it was his paternal inheritance.255 And he fortified any captured townships with his protection, while at the same time the emperor pursued war against the Polish Slavs.256\n\n1033 The same emperor led many soldiers with him, nearly in the middle of winter, into Burgundy, and besieged the castles Murten and Neuenburg. Hindered by the excessive force of cold, however, he returned with the matter unfinished. Then in the next summer he took the war to Odo. He [Conrad] utterly destroyed his [Odo’s] cities with plunder and fire, and by that necessity he forced that same man to come to him as a supplicant, following the promise, although feigned, of restitution.257\n\n1034 Bishop Warmann and the venerable Abbot Dietbald died. They were succeeded by Bishop Eberhard and Abbot Notpert.258 Emperor Conrad again entered Burgundy with an army, and subjugated all those townships with fortifications to his dominion as far as the Rodan river, and came to Geneva. There, having truly been received honorably by Heribert Archbishop of Milan and the other leaders of Italy and Burgundy, he was led forth crowned on the feast of St. Peter in Chains,259 and elected king in the kingdom of the Burgundians.260\n\n1035 A league of strong conspirators appeared in Italy. For inferior warriors, oppressed more than necessary by the unjust domination of their superiors, all having united at the same time, resisted those ones.261 Not less did certain from among the enslaved, having conspired against their lords with a violent faction, establish judges, courts, and laws for themselves from their own number; they mixed up right and wrong. The bishop of Milan and the other senators of Italy, rising up against them to stop them, attempted to draw them back from such insolence, if they were able. But by no means did they wish to acquiesce to them, unless it was granted to those ones [the rebels] in writing by the king that they held the inviolable right of their fathers.262\n\n1036 Emperor Conrad joined his son Henry in matrimony with the daughter of Cnut, king of the English.263 And Conrad committed to his cousin [Conrad] the ducatus of Adelbero in Carinthia, having deprived him [Adalbero] of it.264 Having gathered an army, he [Conrad] departed for Italy at the beginning of winter.265\n\n1037 The same emperor, having celebrated Christmas at Verona, went from there to Milan. There, he was received honorably by the archbishop and the citizens. However, as he [the archbishop] bore feigned loyalty, proceeding from there, he[Conrad] led the same [arch]bishop with him to Pavia and, having imprisoned him suddenly as if he was guilty of treachery, he gave him to the patriarch of Aquila for safekeeping.266 Having craftily escaped him [the patriarch] by flight, for this reason the archbishop was received gratefully in the city by the triumphant Milanese. But the emperor, desiring to take revenge on them, besieged the city with a strong company and left the property of the bishopric to the army to be ravaged. But a marvelous and previously unfamiliar prodigy happened there at that time. For on the sacrosanct day of Pentecost, at sunrise, lighting was seen to move above the army, thunder to bellow, with the citizens within those walls not perceiving any of this. It is also said that not a few horses and men there were transfixed by lightning, and certain of them truly were seized by a demon. A war between Gozelin and Odo was carried on, in which Odo, defeated, died, and his army was scattered here and there.267\n\n1038 The wife of king Henry and his brother Hermann, dux of the Alemans, died. The same king received his ducatus, with the kingdom of Burgundy, from his father the same year, with those leaders of the same kingdom having sworn him loyalty with an oath.268\n\n1039 Emperor Conrad passed away and his son Henry took up the governance of the kingdom.269\n\n1040 The same king enters the monastery of St Gall, and in that same year, having attempted to tame Bretislav dux of Bohemia, who was refusing to endure the bridle of his command, alas, he lost many of his men — and not the lowliest of them — in the forest through which he ordered his men to journey.270 For Count Werner, made the leader of this venture by the others, while ignorant of the ambush before him along with the others, recklessly entered a forest between the narrow gorge of the path, simultaneously arriving in a place excessively unfavorable to him and also favorable enough to the ill intent of the enemy.271 Overwhelmed there by spears of every kind thrown from afar, they died unavenged, since, when those [enemies] had entangled them in the density of the forest, there was no opportunity to strike back or to join battle.272\n\n1041 The aforementioned king, holding deep pain in his heart, added a new [army] to the old army, and then entered Bohemia, more cautious than before. He destroyed fortresses, consumed towns with fire, and finally compelled the same dux to give his son to him as a captive, and made him follow him to Regensburg. The same year Peter king of the Hungarians, having been foully expelled from his own kingdom by a certain count, came to the same King Henry asking for help.273 Pitying this unfortunate one, the most pious king, although harmed by him in the past, wept for the lot of human weakness. That same king [Henry] supplied him with paternal comfort through both words and material things.274\n\n1042 King Henry, having brought many warriors with him, attacked Hungary and ravaged the greatest part of it.\n\n1043 A most notable year, with the excessive overflow of rain and paucity of the fruits of the earth. The aforementioned king [Henry], desiring to restore Peter to his ancestral throne, equipped a huge ship with greatest force, and about to tempt the fortune of war, again entered Pannonia by the Danube. Having entered, he did many things bravely and many things successfully, and he compelled that counterfeit and false kinglet to give up his unjustly-possessed wealth. Furthermore, he bound him with an oath, that he would not exceed the borders of his kingdom; but the matter for which he came he has not yet achieved, hindered, I believe, by the will of God. For the same Peter, as long as he reigned, stood out as a sinner in many ways. From there returning to Ulm the same king [Henry] held a general assembly, then came to Constance in time for the synod, where he remained, entering a covenant with just as many bishops as other of the best men of the kingdom, as a diligent <public> advocate for all that was to be conducted there. But on the fourth day, which is commonly called indulgence, he himself with the bishop ascended the stage as an eloquent orator, and began to encourage the populace to peace with a splendid sermon. At the end, moreover, he concluded his speech thus: that he pardoned everyone who was guilty towards him, and compelled all those who were present, at times with entreaties and at times through his authority, to do that as well. What was profitably begun there, he ordered to be taught throughout the whole of his kingdom. And not long afterwards, with all matters having been completed in peace, he married the daughter of William, dux of Poitiers.275 Empress Gisela died.276\n\n1044 Great hunger. After the same often-mentioned king [Henry] had gathered aid from everywhere, he departed for Pannonia a third time. That kinglet met him with an infinite multitude, with an approach that seemed undaunted, and when he was able to prevent his [Henry’s] crossing of a certain river, he permitted him to cross deliberately, having considered it an easier battle for himself within the borders of his own kingdom, and retreating more difficult for an enemy pressed against a river. But something very different from what he hoped occurred: in the end, our leader decided to engage the other as soon as possible, and to bring courage to his words, saying that it is better to lay down one’s life bravely in battle than to lie beneath the mockeries of the enemy as if a worthless slave. Indeed he himself [Henry], armed so that his bravery was greater than others’, drew up the battle line to suit the place and his forces, and with the signal having been given attacked the enemy and laid low those resisting him as if he was a tempest. Without delay he became the victor with the favoring mercy of Christ, and immediately he conquered the city, where he apprehended the wife and sons of the king, along with a huge amount of money. Peter he restored to his own kingdom, and with things done well he returned to Saxony.277\n\n1045\n\n1046\n\n1047\n\n1048\n\n1049\n\n1050\n\n1051\n\n1052\n\n1053\n\n1054\n\n1055\n\n1056 || Emperor Henry died, and his son Henry succeeded to the kingdom.278\n\n1057\n\n1058\n\n1059\n\n1060\n\n1061\n\n1062\n\n1063\n\n1064\n\n1065\n\n1066\n\n1068\n\n1069\n\nFor discussions of the text see especially Wilhelm Wattenbach and Robert Holtzmann, Deustschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittlelater: Die Zeit der Sachsen und Salier 1.

Liudolf and Ernest are conflated into one character in the later romance Herzog Ernst — see Althoff, Rules and Rituals, pp. 237–39.\n\nPaul Fouracre, The Age of Charles Martel (London, 2000), pp. 51–52.\n\nRoger Collins, ‘Frankish Past and Carolingian Present in the Age of Charlemagne’, in Am Vorabend der Kaiser Krönung: Das Epos ‘Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa’ und der Papstbesuch in Paderborn 799, ed. by Peter Godman, Jörg Jarnut, and Peter Johanek (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2002), pp. 301–22 (p. 315).\n\nEntry 799.\n\nEntries 1012 and 1015.\n\nFor the evolution of the term, see Anthony Hilhorst, ‘Ishmaelites, Hagarenes, Saracens’, in Abraham, the Nations, and the Hagarites: Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Perspectives on Kinship with Abraham, ed. by Martin Goodman, George H. van Kooten and Jacques T.A.G.M. van Ruiten (Leiden: Brill, 2010), pp. 421–34; also Norman Bade, ‘Muslims in the Christian World Order: Comprehension and Knowledge of the Saracens in Two Universal Histories of the Carolingian Empire’, Millennium, 10 (2013), 293–310. It is worth noting the competing Pauline interpretation, from Galatians 4:22–31, which many medieval Christians took to indicate that Hagar represented synagoga, i.e. the Jewish community — see e.g. Deeana Klepper, ‘Historicizing Allegory: The Jew as Hagar in Medieval Christian Text and Image’, Church History, 84 (2015), 308–44 (pp. 315–18).\n\nEntries 899, 900, 902, 908, 909, 910, 913.\n\nFor the early Hungarians see especially Pál Engel, The Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895–1526, trans. by Tamás Pálosfalvi (London: I.B. Tauris, 2001), pp. 8–24.\n\n‘idiotae nostri quidam nunc Agarenos vocant’, a sentiment repeated in his Casus sancti Galli as well. Noted by Natalia Lozovsky, ‘The Uses of Classical History and Geography in Medieval St Gall’, in Mapping Medieval Geographies: Geographical Encounters in the Latin West and Beyond, 300–1600, ed. by Keith D. Lilley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 65–82 (pp. 71–72); Meyer von Knonau, Ekkeharti (IV) Casus sancti Galli (St. Gallen: Verlag von Huber & Comp., 1877), p. 298, note 998.\n\nFor the importance of the sack, see Vogler, ‘Historical Sketch’, p. 16.\n\nFor the function of apocalypse in tenth-century literature and politics, see especially Levi Roach, ‘Emperor Otto III and the End of Time’, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 23 (2013), 75–102; Daniel Verhelst, ‘Adso of Montier-en-Der and the Fear of the Year 1000’, in The Apocalyptic Year 1000: Religious Expectation and Social Change, 950–1050, ed. by Richard Landes, Andrew Gow, and David van Meter (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 81–92 (pp. 84–85).\n\nOther sources also blame Arnulf for the entry of the Hungarians; Regino of Prüm implicitly connects the Hungarian migration to the dissolution of the Carolingian empire by placing his ethnography of the Hungarians in 889, the year after the death of Charles the Fat.\n\nSee the analysis in Mayke de Jong, ‘Carolingian Monasticism: The Power of Prayer’, in The New Cambridge Medieval History II: c. 700–c. 900, ed. by Rosamond McKitterick (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 622–53 (pp. 636–40); De Jong, ‘Internal Cloisters’, pp. 209–21; Rachel Stone, ‘“In What Way Can Those Who Have Left The World Be Distinguished?”: Masculinity and the Difference Between Carolingian Men’, in Intersections of Gender, Religion and Ethnicity in the Middle Ages, ed. by Cordelia Beattie and Kirsten A.

Zingg, Annalistik, p. 145; White, Content of the Form, p. 6.\n\nGodfrid, dux of Alemannia from the late seventh century. The decision to being the Annals with the death of Godfrid, rather than the death of the Pippinid Drogo recorded in the Annales Alemannici, frames the entire work’s more local perspective.\n\nPippin II (r. 680–714), father of Charles Martel.\n\nCharles Martel, Mayor of the Palace 718–41.\n\nEudo ‘the Great’, dux of the Aquitainians c. 700–35/740, and the Muslims of what became al-Andalus. ´Saracen’, of uncertain origin, was a common ethnoreligious slur in the Middle Ages.\n\n‘The Venerable’ Bede, who actually died in 735. Bede’s manuscripts were an important presence at St. Gall — see Joshua A. Westgard, ‘Bede and the Continent in the Carolingian Age and Beyond’, in The Cambridge Companion to Bede, ed. by Scott DeGregorio (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 201–15.\n\nLikely somewhere between Tours and Poitiers. While there has been some controversy as regards the date, 732 seems likely — see William Watson, ‘The Battle of Tours-Poitiers Revisited’, Providence: Studies in Western Civilization, 2:1 (1993), repr. at https://deremilitari.org/2013/09/the-battle-of-tours-poitiers-revisited/.\n\nThat is, Septimania, the region of southern France abutting the Mediterranean.\n\nLaconic language like this refers to Charles campaigning in Saxony, rather than merely being present there.\n\nCarloman, mayor of the palace 741–47, and Pippin, mayor of the palace until 751; thereafter Frankish king until 768.\n\nThat is, became a monk.\n\nIn a later hand. It is unclear to whom this is meant to refer; if Carlomann, who died in 754, it is incorrect.\n\nThis entry is erased, though legible, in the autograph; it is not present in the twelfth-century copy. For this event and the potential involvement of Pope Zacharias, see Rosamond McKitterick, ‘The Illusion of Royal Power in the Carolingian Annals’, The English Historical Review, 115 (2000), 1–20.\n\nPope Stephen II, 752–757.\n\nSaint Boniface, famed ‘Apostle to the Germans’.\n\nA confusion of Childeric III with Chilperic II (r. 715–21), who had indeed been raised as a monk and known as Daniel before his elevation to the kingship.\n\nProbably referring to the so-called ‘donation of Pippin’, in which Pippin confirmed papal territorial control of much of Italy.\n\nA significant gift from the Byzantine emperor — see Judith Herrin, ‘Constantinople, Rome and the Franks in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries’, in Byzantine Diplomacy, ed. by Jonathan Shepard and Simon Franklin (Aldershot: Ashgate Variorum, 1992), pp. 91–108 (pp. 100–01).\n\nWarin and Ruthard were Frankish counts in the region of Alemannia.\n\nPresent-day Stein am Rhein, near where the Rhine drains from Lake Constance. Otmar, an Alemanic priest charged with the custody of St. Gall’s relics, is considered to have founded the abbey of St. Gall, though the date of that foundation is disputed.\n\nAn entry not in the Annales Alemannici.\n\nCarloman I, r. 768–71.\n\nThat is, Charlemagne; r. 768–814: King of the Franks from 768, King of the Lombards from 774, Emperor from 800.\n\nDesiderius, King of the Lombards 756–74. The latter half of the sentence, describing Desiderius at Corbie, is new to the Greater Annals.\n\nThis was Charlemagne’s son, formerly Carloman, who was renamed in association with the disinheritance of Charlemagne’s eldest son Pippin ‘the Hunchback’.\n\nThe dates 782–89 were erroneously labeled ΨCXII–ΨCXVIIII, i.e. 812–19, and corrected in a later hand.\n\nTassilo III, dux of the Bavarians 748–88, d. 796. For the context of this event, which constituted the final Carolingian takeover of Bavaria, see Stuart Airlie, ‘Narratives of Triumph and Rituals of Submission: Charlemagne’s Mastering of Bavaria’, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, sixth series, 9 (1999), 93–119.\n\nI.e., Avars.\n\nThat is, became a monk.\n\nPippin ‘the Hunchback’. The two events are connected; the conspiracy’s goal had been to place Pippin on the throne. See Carl I. Hammer, ‘“Pipinus Rex”: Pippin’s Plot of 792 and Bavaria’, Traditio, 63 (2008), 235–76.\n\nWilhelm of Gellone, Count of Toulouse 790–811.\n\nFor the trope of the perfidious Saxons, see Robert Flierman, ‘Gens perfida or populus Christianus? Saxon (in)fidelity in Frankish historical writing’, in The Resources of the Past in Early Medieval Europe, ed. by Clemens Gantner, Rosamond McKitterick, and Sven Meeder (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015), pp. 188–205.\n\nBy Vandals, the annalist means Avars; Zotanus is not a personal name but a mistake for the Avar title Tudun, a type of regional military leader. See Walter Pohl, The Avars: A Steppe Empire in Central Europe, 567–822 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2018), pp. 361–63.\n\nGerold, Prefect of Bavaria 788–99. According to other sources, he died in battle with the Avars.\n\nIn a later hand, and of unclear meaning. The date here has the 800 written out in full, octingentesimus i; it is thus possible that the entry refers to the anno domini dating.\n\nBishop Haito of Basel (c. 806–23), on a mission to Constantinople.\n\nWerdo, Abbot of St. Gall since 784.\n\nEmperor Louis the Pious, 814–40.\n\nGozbert, abbot of St. Gall 816–37.\n\nThe schoolmaster at Reichenau for over twenty years and an important figure in the history of Carolingian monastic education. From the perspective of St. Gall, he is particularly vital because of his authorship of the second Life of St. Gall. Wetti is also the subject of the Vision of Wetti, a much-studied example of Carolingian dream literature.\n\nThis was the ‘refoundation’ of St. Gall under Gozbert, who entirely rebuilt the church.\n\nBernwig, abbot of St. Gall 837–41.\n\nThat is, the sons of Louis the Pious: Lothar, Louis ‘the German’, and Charles ‘the Bald’.\n\nGrimald, abbot of St. Gall 841–72.\n\nThe treaty of Verdun, which divided the Carolingian empire into three sections. West Francia, corresponding to much of modern-day France, went to Charles ‘the Bald’; Middle Francia, a span of wealthy territories stretching from the Low Country down through Burgundy to Italy, went to the eldest son Lothar; and East Francia, corresponding to the western and southern portions of modern Germany, went to Louis ‘the German’.\n\nFor earthquakes in the St. Gall record see especially Monika Gisler, Donat Fäh, and Virgilio Masciadri, ‘“Terrae motus factus est”: Earthquakes in Switzerland before A. D. 1000. A Critical Approach’, Natural Hazards, 43 (2007), 63–79. Walafrid Strabo, abbot of Reichenau since 838, one of the most important authors of the so-called ‘Carolingian Renaissance’ and writer of a metrical life of St. Gall.\n\nFor animal pestilences in the early Middle Ages see Timothy P. Newfield, ‘Early Medieval Epizootics and Landscapes of Disease: The Origins and Triggers of European Livestock Pestilences, 400–1000 CE’, in Landscapes and Societies in Medieval Europe East of the Elbe: Interactions Between Environmental Settings and Cultural Transformations, ed. by Sunhild Kleingärtner, Timothy P. Newfield, Sébastien Rossignol and Donat Wehner (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013), pp. 73–113.\n\nSaint Meinrad of Einsiedeln.\n\nSeemingly the Hungarians/Magyars.\n\nErasure mark around text.\n\nPossibly Rinderpest/measles — see Timothy P. Newfield, ‘Human-Bovine Plagues in the Early Middle Ages’, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 45 (2015), 1–38.\n\nIso, schoolmaster of St. Gall. According to Ekkehard IV, he taught notable figures like Notker the Stammerer, Salomo III of Constance, and the monks Tuotilo and Ratpert.\n\nHartmut, abbot of St. Gall 872–83. Erasure mark around text.\n\nLouis the German, king of East Francia 843–76.\n\nSeemingly by suicide — see Ekkehard IV, Casus, chapters 43–44, trans. by Albu and Lozovsky, pp. 125–29. The Latin, cecidit, has the meaning not only of ‘died‘ but also of ‘fell.‘ A marginal note in the manuscript in a later hand points the reader towards the Vita Notgerii for more information.\n\nAlthough the text is unclear, it seems likely to me that this is Charles ‘the Fat’, king of Alemannia from 876, Frankish emperor 881–87, d. 888 after his ouster by his nephew Arnulf of Carinthia. Usually counted as Charles III, after Charlemagne and Charles the Bald, not Charles II. See the discussion in the introduction above.\n\nJohn VIII, Pope 872–82.\n\nThat is, made emperor.\n\nThe dates from 882–89 were erroneously labeled ΩCXII–ΩCXIX, i.e. 912–19, and corrected in a later hand.\n\nThat is, East Francia, after the heirless death of his brother Louis ‘the Younger.‘\n\nBernhard, abbot of St. Gall 883–90.\n\nArnulf of Carinthia, king of East Francia from 887, emperor 896–99. Hagarenes here meaning the Hungarians, a connection which continues in the annals until the year 955 (see the discussion in the introduction above). A similar apposition, implicitly linking the death of Charles and the elevation of Arnulf to the entry of the Hungarians, is made by Regino of Prüm in the 888–89 section of his Chronicon.\n\nSalamon III, Bishop of Constance, abbot of St. Gall 890–919.\n\nPossibly drawing on imagery from the Alexander legends, in which the ‘unclean peoples’ of Gog and Magog — often equated to invaders from the Eurasian steppe — were locked behind the Caspian gates.\n\nLouis ‘the Child’, king of East Francia 900–11.\n\nReferring to the old Roman province of Noricum in southern Bavaria. For the relationship of the Norici to the Bavarians, see especially Matthias Hardt, ‘The Bavarians’, in ‘Regna’ and ‘Gentes’: The Relationship between Late Antique and Early Medieval Peoples and Kingdoms in the Transformation of the Roman World, ed. by H.-W. Goetz, J. Jarnut, W. Pohl, and Sören Kaschke (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 429–62.\n\nZwentibald, natural son of Arnulf, king of Lotharingia 895–901.\n\nThe word for feast is brandium, i.e. prandium, referring usually to breakfast or animal fodder. The implication may have been to compare the Hungarians to animals. Chussol is Kurszán, a leader of the Hungarians whose exact position is disputed.\n\nAdalbert of Babenberg; a casualty of an ongoing feud with the rival Conradine family. See Regino of Prüm, Chronicon, s.a. 906, ed. by Friedrich Kurze, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores rerum Germanicarum in usum scholarum separatim editi, 50 (Hannover: Impensis Bibliopolii Hahniani, 1890), pp. 150–53.\n\nThe Battle of Pressburg (usually dated to 907). For the other sources on the battle see Kurt Reindel, Die Bayerischen Luitpoldinger 893–989: Sammlung und Erläuterung der Quellen (Munich: Beck, 1953), pp. 62–67.\n\nAdalbero, Bishop of Augsburg 887–909.\n\nIt is unclear if the use of Norici here is a classicizing reference to the Bavarians or implies a specifically southern Bavarian section of the army.\n\nConrad I, king of East Francia 911–18.\n\nNotker ‘the Stammerer’, best known for his Gesta Karoli Magni and his Liber Hymnorum, an important early collection of sequences.\n\nHatto, Archbishop of Mainz 891–913; Otbert, Bishop of Strasbourg 906–13.\n\nErchanger, dux of Swabia 915–17; Udalrich, Count of Thurgau c. 912–17; Arnulf, dux of Bavaria 907–37.\n\nBy Erchanger. The story is recounted, in highly stylized form, by Ekkehard IV, Casus, chapters 17–19, trans. Albu and Lozovsky, pp. 47–55.\n\nLuitfrid appears as a nephew of Erchanger and Berhtold in the Casus telling.\n\nThe Vita Wiboradae describes her enclosure in a cell abutting the church of St. Magnus, 500 meters north of the monastery of St. Gall.\n\nRudolf II of Burgundy, 912–37, and Burchard II of Alemannia, 917–26.\n\nAccording to the Vita Wiboradae, Rachildis became an anchoress after seeking out Wiborada.\n\nHartmann, Abbot of St. Gall 922–25.\n\nEngilbert, Abbot of St. Gall 925–33.\n\nDiscussed in much more detail in the Vita Wiboradae.\n\nHenry I, King of East Francia 919–36.\n\nThiet"
