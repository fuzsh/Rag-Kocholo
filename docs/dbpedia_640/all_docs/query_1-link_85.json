        "text": "L-alanyl-L-glutamine ingestion maintains performance during a competitive basketball game.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoffman, Jay R; Williams, David R; Emerson, Nadia S; Hoffman, Mattan W; Wells, Adam J; McVeigh, Daniele M; McCormack, William P; Mangine, Gerald T; Gonzalez, Adam M; Fragala, Maren S\n\n2012-03-07\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of L-alanyl-L-glutamine (AG) ingestion on basketball performance, including jump power, reaction time, shooting accuracy and fatigue. Ten women (21.2 Â± 1.6 years; height: 177.8 Â± 8.7 cm; body mass: 73.5 Â± 8.0 kg), all scholarship NCAA Division I basketball players, volunteered for this study. Subjects participated in four trials, each consisting of a 40-min basketball game with controlled time-outs for rehydration. During the first trial (DHY) subjects were not allowed to rehydrate, and the total weight lost during the contest was used to determine fluid replenishment during the subsequent three trials. During one trial subjects consumed only water (W), while during the other two trials subjects consumed the AG supplement mixed in water using either a low dose (1 g per 500 ml) (AG1) or high dose (2 g per 500 ml) (AG2) concentration. All data assessed prior to and following each game were converted into a Î score (Post results - Pre results). All performance data were then analyzed using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. During DHY subjects lost 1.72 Â± 0.42 kg (2.3%) of their body mass. No differences in fluid intake (1.55 Â± 0.43 L) were seen between rehydration trials. A 12.5% (p = 0.016) difference in basketball shooting performance was noted between DHY and AG1 and an 11.1% (p = 0.029) difference was seen between AG1 and W. Visual reaction time was significantly greater following AG1 (p = 0.014) compared to DHY. Differences (p = 0.045) in fatigue, as determined by player loads, were seen only between AG2 and DHY. No differences were seen in peak or mean vertical jump power during any trial. Rehydration with AG appears to maintain basketball skill performance and visual reaction time to a greater extent than water only.\n\nDouble-blinded, placebo-controlled trial on intravenous L-alanyl-L-glutamine in the incidence of oral mucositis following chemoradiotherapy in patients with head-and-neck cancer\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCerchietti, Leandro C.A.; Navigante, Alfredo H.; Internal Medicine Department, Instituto de Oncologia Angel H. Roffo, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires\n\n2006-08-01\n\nPurpose: We performed this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of L-alanyl-L-glutamine in the prevention of mucositis in patients with head-and-neck cancer. Methods and Materials: Thirty-two patients with head-and-neck cancer were treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (radiotherapy daily up to 70 Gy plus cisplatin/5-fluoruracil once a week) and were asked to participate. Twenty-nine patients received the CRT schedule and were double-blindly assigned to receive either intravenous L-alanyl-L-glutamine 0.4 g/kg weight/day or an equal volume of saline (placebo) during chemotherapy days. Results: Fourteen patients received L-alanyl-L-glutamine and 15 received placebo. Mucositis was assessed by the Objective Mucositis Score (OMS)moreÂ Â» and the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. There was a significant difference in incidence of mucositis developed in patients receiving placebo compared with those who received L-alanyl-L-glutamine (p = 0.035). The number of patients with severe objective mucositis (OMS >1.49) was higher in the placebo group compared with the L-alanyl-L-glutamine group (67% vs. 14%, p 0.007). L-alanyl-L-glutamine patients experienced less pain (three highest Numeric Rating Scale scores of 1.3/10 vs. 6.3/10 respectively, p = 0.008) and need for feeding tubes (14% vs. 60% respectively, p = 0.020) compared with placebo patients. No adverse effects related to the drug or the infusions were noted in either group. Conclusion: For patients with head-and-neck cancer receiving CRT, intravenous L-alanyl-L-glutamine may be an effective preventive measure to decrease the severity of mucositis.Â«Â less\n\nEnzymatic production of L-alanyl-L-glutamine by recombinant E. coli expressing Î±-amino acid ester acyltransferase from Sphingobacterium siyangensis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirao, Yoshinori; Mihara, Yasuhiro; Kira, Ikuo; Abe, Isao; Yokozeki, Kenzo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAn enzymatic production method for synthesizing L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Ala-Gln) from L-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride (AlaOMe) and L-glutamine (Gln) was developed in this study. The cultivation conditions for an Escherichia coli strain overexpressing Î±-amino acid ester acyltransferase from Sphingobacterium siyangensis AJ 2458 (SAET) and reaction conditions for Ala-Gln production were optimized. A high cell density culture broth prepared by fed-batch cultivation showed 440 units/mL of Ala-Gln-producing activity. In addition, an Ala-Gln-producing reaction using intact E. coli cells overexpressing SAET under optimum conditions was conducted. A total Ala-Gln yield of 69.7 g/L was produced in 40 min. The molar yield was 67% against both AlaOMe and Gln.\n\nOral supplementations with L-glutamine or L-alanyl-L-glutamine do not change metabolic alterations induced by long-term high-fat diet in the B6.129F2/J mouse model of insulin resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBock, Patricia Martins; Krause, Mauricio; Schroeder, Helena Trevisan; Hahn, Gabriela Fernandes; Takahashi, Hilton Kenji; SchÃ¶ler, Cinthia Maria; Nicoletti, Graziella; Neto, Luiz Domingos Zavarize; Rodrigues, Maria InÃªs Lavina; Bruxel, Maciel Alencar; Homem de Bittencourt, Paulo Ivo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this work, we aimed to investigate the effects of long-term supplementations with L-glutamine or L-alanyl-L-glutamine in the high-fat diet (HFD)-fed B6.129SF2/J mouse model over insulin sensitivity response and signaling, oxidative stress markers, metabolism and HSP70 expression. Mice were fed in a standard low-fat diet (STA) or a HFD for 20Â weeks. In the 21th week, mice from the HFD group were allocated in five groups and supplemented for additional 8Â weeks with different amino acids: HFD control group (HFD-Con), HFDÂ +Â dipeptide L-alanyl-L-glutamine group (HFD-Dip), HFDÂ +Â L-alanine group (HFD-Ala), HFDÂ +Â L-glutamine group (HFD-Gln), or the HFDÂ +Â L-alanineÂ +Â L-glutamine (in their free forms) group (HFD-AlaÂ +Â Gln). HFD induced higher body weight, fat pad, fasted glucose, and total cholesterol in comparison with STA group. Amino acid supplementations did not induce any modifications in these parameters. Although insulin tolerance tests indicated insulin resistance in all HFD groups, amino acid supplementations did not improve insulin sensitivity in the present model. There were also no significant differences in the immunocontents of insulin receptor, Akt, and Toll-like receptor-4. Notably, total 70Â kDa heat shock protein (HSP72Â +Â HSP73) contents in the liver was markedly increased in HFD-Con group as compared to STA group, which might suggest that insulin resistance is only in the beginning. Apparently, B6.129SF2/J mice are more resistant to the harmful effects of HFD through a mechanism that may include gut adaptation, reducing the absorption of nutrients, including amino acids, which may explain the lack of improvements in our intervention.\n\nDesign of composite microparticle systems based on pectin and waste material of propolis for modified l-alanyl-l-glutamine release and with immunostimulant activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nVilla Nova, MÃ´nica; Ratti, Bianca A; Herculano, Leandro S; Bittencourt, Paulo R S; Novello, ClÃ¡udio R; Bazotte, Roberto Barbosa; Lautenschlager, Sueli de Oliveira Silva; Bruschi, Marcos Luciano\n\n2017-12-12\n\nCatabolic conditions like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cancer, and burn can cause immunosuppression. Amino acids such as alanine and glutamine are essential for the activity of the immune system. Propolis is immunostimulant and the waste of propolis extraction has been reused with technological and therapeutic purposes. Therefore, this study describes the association of propolis byproduct extract (BPE) with pectin to prepare spray-dried microparticles containing the dipeptide l-alanyl-l-glutamine as stimulant systems of neutrophils. The use of a factorial design allowed selecting the best formulation, which was characterized by morphology, size, and entrapment efficiency analyses. In addition, the systems were characterized by thermal and X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, in vitro drug release, and in vitro cytotoxicity and stimulation test of neutrophils. Small well-structured microparticles with good entrapment efficiency values were achieved. Thermal stability of formulation was observed, and it was proved that pectin, BPE and l-alanyl-l-glutamine were dispersed throughout the matrix. The drug was released from the microparticles during 24âh governed by swelling and diffusion. The drug-loaded formulations showed a significant stimulating effect on neutrophils. These structures could increase the activity of immune cells, and other in vitro and in vivo studies should be performed in the future.\n\nSupplementation of l-Alanyl-l-Glutamine and Fish Oil Improves Body Composition and Quality of Life in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Christina; Kato, Tomoko S; Ji, Ruiping; Zizola, Cynthia; Brunjes, Danielle L; Deng, Yue; Akashi, Hirokazu; Armstrong, Hilary F; Kennel, Peter J; Thomas, Tiffany; Forman, Daniel E; Hall, Jennifer; Chokshi, Aalap; Bartels, Matthew N; Mancini, Donna; Seres, David; Schulze, P Christian\n\n2015-11-01\n\nSkeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance are clinical hallmarks of patients with heart failure. These have been linked to a progressive catabolic state, skeletal muscle inflammation, and impaired oxidative metabolism. Previous studies suggest beneficial effects of Ï-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine on exercise performance and muscle protein balance. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 31 patients with heart failure were randomized to either l-alanyl-l-glutamine (8 g/d) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (6.5 g/d) or placebo (safflower oil and milk powder) for 3 months. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 6-minute walk test, hand grip strength, functional muscle testing, echocardiography, and quality of life and lateral quadriceps muscle biopsy were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Oxidative capacity and metabolic gene expression were analyzed on muscle biopsies. No differences in muscle function, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, or hand grip strength and a nonsignificant increase in peak VO2 in the treatment group were found. Lean body mass increased and quality of life improved in the active treatment group. Molecular analysis revealed no differences in muscle fiber composition, fiber cross-sectional area, gene expression of metabolic marker genes (PGC1Î±, CPT1, PDK4, and GLUT4), and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. The combined supplementation of l-alanyl-l-glutamine and polyunsaturated fatty acid did not improve exercise performance or muscle function but increased lean body mass and quality of life in patients with chronic stable heart failure. These findings suggest potentially beneficial effects of high-dose nutritional polyunsaturated fatty acids and amino acid supplementations in patients with chronic stable heart failure.

S. F.; Bazotte, Roberto B.; Peralta, Rosane M.; Buttow, Nilza C.; Pedrosa, Maria Montserrat D.; de Godoi, Vilma A. F.; Natali, Maria Raquel M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe evaluated the effects of the supplementation with L-glutamine and glutamine dipeptide (GDP) on biochemical and morphophysiological parameters in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. For this purpose, thirty animals were distributed into six groups treated orally (gavage) during thirty days: non diabetic rats (Control) + saline, diabetic + saline; Control + L-glutamine (248 mg/kg), Diabetic + L-glutamine (248 mg/kg), Control + GDP (400 mg/kg), Diabetic + GDP (400 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) and confirmed by fasting glucose â¥ 200 mg/dL. Physiological parameters, i.e., body mass, food intake, blood glucose, water intake, urine and faeces were evaluated during supplementation. After the period of supplementation, the animals were euthanized. The blood was collected for biochemical assays (fructosamine, transaminases, lipid profile, total protein, urea, ammonia). Moreover, the jejunum was excised and stored for morphophysiological assays (intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal wall morphology, crypt proliferative index, number of serotoninergic cells from the mucosa, and vipergic neurons from the submucosal tunica). The physiological parameters, protein metabolism and intestinal enzyme activity did not change with the supplementation with L-glutamine or GDP. In diabetic animals, transaminases and fructosamine improved with L-glutamine and GDP supplementations, while the lipid profile improved with L-glutamine. Furthermore, both forms of supplementation promoted changes in jejunal tunicas and wall morphometry of control and diabetic groups, but only L-glutamine promoted maintenance of serotoninergic cells and vipergic neurons populations. On the other hand, control animals showed changes that may indicate negative effects of L-glutamine. Thus, the supplementation with L-glutamine was more efficient for maintaining intestinal morphophysiology and the supplementation with GDP was more efficient to the organism as a\n\nSupplementation with L-Glutamine and L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine Changes Biochemical Parameters and Jejunum Morphophysiology in Type 1 Diabetic Wistar Rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nda Rosa, Carlos Vinicius D; Azevedo, Silvia C S F; Bazotte, Roberto B; Peralta, Rosane M; Buttow, Nilza C; Pedrosa, Maria Montserrat D; de Godoi, Vilma A F; Natali, Maria Raquel M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe evaluated the effects of the supplementation with L-glutamine and glutamine dipeptide (GDP) on biochemical and morphophysiological parameters in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.

Forty Wistar rats were distributed into 5 groups: sedentary; trained (CTRL); and trained supplemented with l-alanyl-l-glutamine, l-glutamine and l-alanine in their free form (GLN+ALA), or free l-alanine (ALA). All trained animals were submitted to a 6-week ladder-climbing protocol. Supplementations were offered in a 4% drinking water solution for 21 days prior to euthanasia. Plasma glutamine, creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (MYO), and erythrocyte concentration of reduced GSH and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were measured. In tibialis anterior skeletal muscle, GLN-GSH axis, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP-27), and glutamine synthetase were determined. In CRTL animals, high-intensity RE reduced muscle glutamine levels and increased GSSG/GSH rate and TBARS, as well as augmented plasma CK and MYO levels. Conversely, l-glutamine-supplemented animals showed an increase in plasma and muscle levels of glutamine, with a reduction in GSSG/GSH rate, TBARS, and CK. Free l-alanine administration increased plasma glutamine concentration and lowered muscle TBARS. HSF-1 and HSP-27 were high in all supplemented groups when compared with CTRL (p < 0.05). The results presented herein demonstrate that l-glutamine supplemented with l-alanine, in both a free or dipeptide form, improve the GLN-GSH axis and promote cytoprotective effects in rats submitted to high-intensity RE training.\n\nAlanyl-glutamine and glutamine plus alanine supplements improve skeletal redox status in trained rats: involvement of heat shock protein pathways.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetry, Eder Ricardo; Cruzat, Vinicius Fernandes; Heck, Thiago Gomes; Leite, Jaqueline Santos Moreira; Homem de Bittencourt, Paulo Ivo; Tirapegui, Julio\n\n2014-01-17\n\nWe hypothesized that oral l-glutamine supplementations could attenuate muscle damage and oxidative stress, mediated by glutathione (GSH) in high-intensity aerobic exercise by increasing the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Adult male Wistar rats were 8-week trained (60-min/day, 5 days/week) on a treadmill. During the last 21 days, the animals were supplemented with either l-alanyl-l-glutamine dipeptide (1.5 g/kg, DIP) or a solution containing the amino acids l-glutamine (1g/kg) and l-alanine (0.67 g/kg) in their free form (GLN+ALA) or water (controls). Plasma from both DIP- and GLN+ALA-treated animals showed higher l-glutamine concentrations and reduced ammonium, malondialdehyde, myoglobin and creatine kinase activity. In the soleus and gastrocnemius muscle of both supplemented groups, l-glutamine and GSH contents were increased and GSH disulfide (GSSG) to GSH ratio was attenuated (p<0.001). In the soleus muscle, cytosolic and nuclear HSP70 and HSF1 were increased by DIP supplementation. GLN+ALA group exhibited higher HSP70 (only in the nucleus) and HSF1 (cytosol and nucleus). In the gastrocnemius muscle, both supplementations were able to increase cytosolic HSP70 and cytosolic and nuclear HSF1. In trained rats, oral supplementation with DIP or GLN+ALA solution increased the expression of muscle HSP70, favored muscle l-glutamine/GSH status and improved redox defenses, which attenuate markers of muscle damage, thus improving the beneficial effects of high-intensity exercise training.

Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oral supplementations with L-glutamine in its free or dipeptide forms (with L-alanine) on liver glutamine-glutathione (GSH) axis, and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70)/heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) expressions. Adult male Wistar rats were 8-week trained (60 min/day, 5 days/week) on a treadmill. During the last 21 days, the animals were daily supplemented with 1 g of L-glutamine/kg body weight per day in either l-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide (DIP) form or a solution containing L-glutamine and l-alanine in their free forms (GLN+ALA) or water (controls). Exercise training increased cytosolic and nuclear HSF1 and HSP70 expression, as compared with sedentary animals. However, both DIP and GLN+ALA supplements enhanced HSF1 expression (in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions) in relation to exercised controls. Interestingly, HSF1 rises were not followed by enhanced HSP70 expression. DIP and GLN+ALA supplements increased plasma glutamine concentrations (by 62% and 59%, respectively) and glutamine to glutamate plasma ratio in relation to trained controls. This was in parallel with a decrease in plasma ammonium levels. Supplementations increased liver GSH (by 90%), attenuating the glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to GSH ratio, suggesting a redox state protection. In conclusion, oral administration with DIP and GLN+ALA supplements in endurance-trained rats improve liver glutamine-GSH axis and modulate HSF1 pathway.\n\nL-glutamine\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nL-glutamine is used to is used to reduce the frequency of painful episodes (crises) in adults and children ... oxygen to all parts of the body).

The supplement comprised a mixture of essential (l-threonine) and conditionally essential (l-glutamine) amino acids, polar lipids, oat bran rich in beta glucans and yeast extract. Young (1-2years) horses of both sexes were allocated to control (n=7) and treatment groups (n=7) and studied for 9weeks. Horses in the treatment group received the supplement daily for 8weeks. After 8weeks of supplementation, horses were studied for one additional week. Outcome measures included body mass, weight gain, results of clinical examination, hematology and plasma chemistry. There were no adverse events associated with supplementation and horses in both groups showed normal weight gain, clinical signs, hematology and chemistry. l-Glutamine, which is not yet listed as GRAS, was considered with respect to its potential for nutritional support and safety when ingested orally. It is concluded that this oral supplement, when ingested by horses at twice the recommended daily level, was safe and does not pose a health risk when used in accordance with good feeding practice.

METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive TPN supplemented with a conventional amino acids mixture (STD group) or the same solution supplemented with alanyl-glutamine; both solutions were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. On the seventh day of TPN, D-xylose and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran were administered orally. One hour later, superior mesenteric vein (SMV) D-xylose and plasma FITC-dextran concentration were measured. Intestinal blood flow and calculated intestinal substrates flux were measured with ultrasonic transit time flowmetery. RESULTS: Plasma FITC-dextran increased significantly in the STD group. Intestinal blood flow and SMV D-xylose concentration did not differ between the groups. Mucosa weight, villus height, mucosal wall thickness, mucosal protein, and DNA and RNA content in jejunal mucosa were significantly increased in the alanyl-glutamine group. Jejunal mucosal glutaminase activity and net intestinal uptake of glutamine (glutamine flux) were significantly higher in the alanyl-glutamine group as compared with the STD group. CONCLUSION: Addition of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide to the TPN solution improves intestinal glutamine metabolism and prevents mucosal atrophy and deterioration of permeability.

Wistar rats (n 8/group) were submitted to 8-week RE, which consisted of climbing a ladder with progressive loads. In the final 21 d before euthanasia, supplements were delivered in a 4 % solution in drinking water. Glutamine, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), TNF-Î±, specific IL (IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were evaluated in plasma. The concentrations of glutamine, TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-10, as well as NF-ÎºB activation, were determined in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) skeletal muscle. HSP70 level was assayed in EDL and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RE reduced glutamine concentration in plasma and EDL (P<0Â·05 v. sedentary group). However, l-glutamine supplements (l-alanine plus l-glutamine (GLN+ALA) and DIP groups) restored glutamine levels in plasma (by 40 and 58 %, respectively) and muscle (by 93 and 105 %, respectively). GLN+ALA and DIP groups also exhibited increased level of HSP70 in EDL and PBMC, consistent with the reduction of NF-ÎºB p65 activation and cytokines in EDL. Muscle protection was also indicated by attenuation in plasma levels of CK, LDH, TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², as well as an increase in IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1. Our study demonstrates that chronic oral l-glutamine treatment (given with l-alanine or as dipeptide) following progressive RE induces cyprotective effects mediated by HSP70-associated responses to muscle damage and inflammation.\n\nOral supplementations with free and dipeptide forms of L-glutamine in endotoxemic mice: effects on muscle glutamine-glutathione axis and heat shock proteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nCruzat, Vinicius F; PantaleÃ£o, Lucas C; Donato, JosÃ©; de Bittencourt, Paulo Ivo Homem; Tirapegui, Julio\n\n2014-03-01\n\nSepsis is a leading cause of death in intensive care units worldwide. Low availability of glutamine contributes to the catabolic state of sepsis. L-Glutamine supplementation has antioxidant properties and modulates the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). This study investigated the effects of oral supplementation with L-glutamine plus L-alanine (GLN+ALA), both in the free form and L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide (DIP), on glutamine-glutathione (GSH) axis and HSPs expression in endotoxemic mice. B6.129F2/J mice were subjected to endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli, 5 mg.kg(-1), LPS group) and orally supplemented for 48 h with either L-glutamine (1 g.kg(-1)) plus L-alanine (0.61 g.kg(-1)) (GLN+ALA-LPS group) or 1.49 g.kg(-1) of DIP (DIP-LPS group). Endotoxemia reduced plasma and muscle glutamine concentrations [relative to CTRL group] which were restored in both GLN+ALA-LPS and DIP-LPS groups (P<.05). In supplemented groups were re-established GSH content and intracellular redox status (GSSG/GSH ratio) in circulating erythrocytes and muscle. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance was 4-fold in LPS treated mice relative to the untreated CTRL group, and plasma TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² levels were attenuated by the supplements. Heat shock proteins 27, 70 and 90 (protein and mRNA) were elevated in the LPS group and were returned to basal levels (relative to CTRL group) in both GLN+ALA-LPS and DIP-LPS groups. Supplementations to endotoxemic mice resulted in up-regulation of GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase and glutamate cysteine ligase mRNA expression in muscle.

Generally, L-valyl-L-alanine has a greater sorption capacity for the studied compounds, but the thermal stability of the L-alanyl-L-valine clathrates is higher. Unusual selectivity of L-valyl-L-alanine for vapors of few chloroalkanes was observed. The correlation between the change in the surface morphology of thin film of dipeptides and stoichiometry of their clathrates with organic compounds was found. This discovery may be used to predict the influence of vapors on the morphology of films of short-chain oligopeptides.\n\nEndogenous glutamine production in critically ill patients: the effect of exogenous glutamine supplementation\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Glutamine rate of appearance (Ra) may be used as an estimate of endogenous glutamine production. Recently a technique employing a bolus injection of isotopically labeled glutamine was introduced, with the potential to allow for multiple assessments of the glutamine Ra over time in critically ill patients, who may not be as metabolically stable as healthy individuals. Here the technique was used to evaluate the endogenous glutamine production in critically ill patients in the fed state with and without exogenous glutamine supplementation intravenously. Methods Mechanically ventilated patients (nâ=â11) in the intensive care unit (ICU) were studied on two consecutive days during continuous parenteral feeding. To allow the patients to be used as their own controls, they were randomized for the reference measurement during basal feeding without supplementation, before or after the supplementation period. Glutamine Ra was determined by a bolus injection of 13C-glutamine followed by a period of frequent sampling to establish the decay-curve for the glutamine tracer. Exogenous glutamine supplementation was given by intravenous infusion of a glutamine containing dipeptide, L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 0.28 g/kg during 20 hours. Results A 14% increase of endogenous glutamine Ra was seen at the end of the intravenous supplementation period as compared to the basal measurements (Pâ=â0.009). Conclusions The bolus injection technique to measure glutamine Ra to estimate the endogenous production of glutamine in critically ill patients was demonstrated to be useful for repetitive measurements. The hypothesized attenuation of endogenous glutamine production during L-alanyl-L-glutamine infusion given as a part of full nutrition was not seen.

Patients who received 0.4 g/kg/d alanyl-glutamine and isonitrogenous PN were assigned to an alanyl-glutamine-supplemented PN (Gln-PN) group and a control group, respectively. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and glutamine, body fat mass (FM), immunologic function, and intestinal permeability were measured before and after surgery. Serum glutamine levels of the Gln-PN group significantly exceeded that of the control group (P < .001; Gln-PN, baseline 460.7 Â± 42.5 vs 523.3 Â± 48.6 Âµmol/L on postoperative day 14 [POD14], P < .001; control, baseline 451.9 Â± 44.0 vs 453.8 Â± 42.3 Âµmol/L on POD14, P = .708). Lactulose/mannitol ratios of both groups decreased over time (Gln-PN, baseline 0.129 Â± 0.0403 vs 0.024 Â± 0.0107 on POD1 4; control, baseline 0.125 Â± 0.0378 vs 0.044 Â± 0.0126 on POD14, P < .001 in both groups). CD4/CD8-positive T-lymphocyte ratios significantly rose in both groups, with significant intergroup difference (P < .001; Gln-PN, baseline 1.36 Â± 0.32 vs 1.82 Â± 0.30 on POD14, P < .001; control, baseline 1.37 Â± 0.25 vs 1.63 Â± 0.31 on POD14, P < .001). In the Gln-PN group, FM increased from 3.68 Â± 1.68 kg at baseline to 5.22 Â± 1.42 kg on POD14 (P < .001). FM of control group increased from 3.84 Â± 1.57 kg at baseline to 5.40 Â± 1.54 kg on POD14 (P < .001). However, there were no significant intergroup differences (P = .614). Gln-PN significantly boosted the immune state and decreased the intestinal permeability of CRE patients. However, Gln-PN was not superior to standard PN in improving the nutrition state and intestinal motility of surgical patients with CRE-induced intestinal obstruction.

Then, we hypothesized that chemotherapy may increase the incidence of hyperammonemia without comparable change of major parameters of hepatic/renal disorder. To verify our hypothesis, we examined the increase in blood ammonia level with 1-h intravenous infusion of alanyl-glutamine on day 1-4 after cisplatin (CDDP) administration in rats and assessed the correlation with hepatic/renal parameters. Hepatic parameters (glutamate-oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT] and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [GPT]) with CDDP did not change until day 3 and only GOT increased on day 4. Renal parameters (plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) with CDDP continuously increased up to day 4. Alanyl-glutamine infusion significantly elevated blood ammonia level of CDDP rats with the peak on day 3, although the same dose did not change that of control rats. These results indicates that CDDP enhances the increase in blood ammonia level by glutamine supplementation without correlating with primary parameters for hepatic/renal dysfunction. Â© 2018 S.

The ratio of the two activities did not change through several stages of purification, anionic and cationic polyacrylamide disk gel electrophoresis, and partial thermal inactivation. The two activities had parallel blood clearance rates in mice. l-glutamine was found to be a competitive inhibitor of l-asparagine hydrolysis. A separate l-glutaminase enzyme free of l-asparaginase activity was separated by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography.

Kidney function and the histological findings of AKI were investigated in an experimental rat model with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and compared with and without treatment with carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine). Material/Methods Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups consisting eight rats in each: Group 1 â control; Group 2 â septic shock; and Group 3 â septic shock treated with carnosine. Femoral vein and artery catheterization were applied in all rats. Rats in Group 1 underwent laparotomy and catheterization. The other two groups with septic shock underwent laparotomy, CLP, catheterization, and bladder cannulation. Rats in Group 3 received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 250 mg/kg carnosine, 60 min following CLP. Rats were monitored for blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature to assess responses to postoperative sepsis, and 10 mL/kg saline replacement was administered. Twenty-four hours following CLP, rats were sacrificed, and blood and renal tissue samples were collected. Results Statistically significant improvements were observed in kidney function, tissue and serum malondialdehyde levels, routine blood values, biochemical indices, and in histopathological findings in rats in Group 3 who were treated with carnosine, compared with Group 2 exposed to septic shock without carnosine treatment. Conclusions Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) has been shown to have beneficial effects in reducing AKI due to septic shock in a rat model of septicemia.

It was hypothesized that glutamine ingestion would quicken the recovery rate of peak force production and decrease muscle soreness ratings over a 72-hr recovery period. Sixteen healthy participants (8â/8â; 22 Â± 4 years) volunteered in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Supplement conditions consisted of isoenergetic placebo (maltodextrin, 0.6 gÂ·kg-1Â·day-1) and L-glutamine (0.3 gÂ·kg-1Â·day-1 + 0.3 gÂ·kg-1Â·day-1 maltodextrin) ingestion once per day over 72 hr. Knee extensor peak torque at 0Â°, 30Â°, and 180Â° per second and muscle soreness were measured before, immediately following, 24, 48, and 72 hr posteccentric exercise. Eccentric exercise consisted of 8 sets (10 repetitions/set) of unilateral knee extension at 125% maximum concentric force with 2-min rest intervals. L-glutamine resulted in greater relative peak torque at 180Â°/sec both immediately after (71 Â± 8% vs. 66 Â± 9%), and 72 hr (91 Â± 8% vs. 86 Â± 7%) postexercise (all, p < .01). In men, L-glutamine produced greater (p < .01) peak torques at 30Â°/ sec postexercise. Men also produced greater normalized peak torques at 30Â°/sec (Nm/kg) in the L-glutamine condition than women (all, p < .05). In the entire sample, L-glutamine resulted in lower soreness ratings at 24 (2.8 Â± 1.2 vs. 3.4 Â± 1.2), 48 (2.6 Â± 1.4 vs. 3.9 Â± 1.2), and 72 (1.7 Â± 1.2 vs. 2.9 Â± 1.3) hr postexercise (p < .01). The L-glutamine supplementation resulted in faster recovery of peak torque and diminished muscle soreness following eccentric exercise. The effect of L-glutamine on muscle force recovery may be greater in men than women.\n\nDoes an L-glutamine-containing, Glucose-free, Oral Rehydration Solution Reduce Stool Output and Time to Rehydrate in Children with Acute Diarrhoea? A Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGutiÃ©rrez, Claudia; Villa, SofÃ­a; Mota, Felipe R.; Calva, Juan J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis study assessed whether an oral rehydration solution (ORS) in which glucose is replaced by L-glutamine (L-glutamine ORS) is more effective than the standard glucose-based rehydration solution recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO-ORS) in reducing the stool volume and time to rehydrate in acute diarrhoea. In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in a Mexican hospital, 147 dehydrated children, aged 1â60 month(s), were assigned either to the WHO-ORS (74 children), or to the L-glutamine ORS (73 children) and followed until successful rehydration. There were no significant differences between the groups in stool output during the first four hours, time to successful rehydration, volume of ORS required for rehydration, urinary output, and vomiting. This was independent of rotavirus-associated infection. An L-glutamine-containing glucose-free ORS seems not to offer greater clinical benefit than the standard WHO-ORS in mildly-to-moderately-dehydrated children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea.

Bacterial pathogen entry into host poses an abrupt and dramatic environmental change, during which successful pathogens gauge multiple parameters that signal host localization. The facultative human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes flourishes in soil, water and food, and in ~50 different animals, and serves as a model for intracellular infection. L. monocytogenes identifies host entry by sensing both physical (e.g., temperature) and chemical (e.g., metabolite concentrations) factors. We report here that L-glutamine, an abundant nitrogen source in host serum and cells, serves as an environmental indicator and inducer of virulence gene expression. In contrast, ammonia, which is the most abundant nitrogen source in soil and water, fully supports growth, but fails to activate virulence gene transcription. We demonstrate that induction of virulence genes only occurs when the Listerial intracellular concentration of L-glutamine crosses a certain threshold, acting as an on/off switch: off when L-glutamine concentrations are below the threshold, and fully on when the threshold is crossed. To turn on the switch, L-glutamine must be present, and the L-glutamine high affinity ABC transporter, GlnPQ, must be active. Inactivation of GlnPQ led to complete arrest of L-glutamine uptake, reduced type I interferon response in infected macrophages, dramatic reduction in expression of virulence genes, and attenuated virulence in a mouse infection model. These results may explain observations made with other pathogens correlating nitrogen metabolism and virulence, and suggest that gauging of L-glutamine as a means of ascertaining host localization may be a general mechanism.

The approval of hydroxyurea for children was long overdue, having been authorized by the FDA for adults in 1998 and by the European Medicines Agency for adults and children in 2007, but the approval of L-glutamine was a surprise to many in the field. There are few published studies of L-glutamine as a treatment for SCA, so all can be reviewed in this brief manuscript. Accordingly, there are many unanswered questions about L-glutamine and its role in current therapy for SCA.

Intravenous glutamine infusion dose- dependently increases plasma glutamine levels, thereby correcting hypoglutaminemia. Glutamine may be transformed to glutamate which might limit its application at a higher dose in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, the optimal glutamine dose required to normalize plasma glutamine levels without increasing plasma and cerebral glutamate has not yet been defined. Methods Changes in plasma and cerebral glutamine, alanine, and glutamate as well as indirect signs of metabolic impairment reflected by increased intracranial pressure (ICP), lactate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, electroencephalogram (EEG) activity were determined before, during, and after continuous intravenous infusion of 0.75Â gÂ L-alanine-L-glutamine which was given either for 24Â hours (group 1, nâ=â6) or 5Â days (group 2, nâ=â6) in addition to regular enteral nutrition. Lab values including nitrogen balance, urea and ammonia were determined daily. Results Continuous L-alanine-L-glutamine infusion significantly increased plasma and cerebral glutamine as well as alanine levels, being mostly sustained during the 5Â day infusion phase (plasma glutamine: from 295âÂ±â62 to 500âÂ±â145Â Î¼mol/ l; brain glutamine: from 183âÂ±â188 to 549âÂ±â120Â Î¼mol/ l; plasma alanine: from 327âÂ±â91 to 622âÂ±â182Â Î¼mol/ l; brain alanine: from 48âÂ±â55 to 89âÂ±â129Â Î¼mol/ l; pâ<â0.05, ANOVA, post hoc Dunnâs test). Plasma glutamate remained unchanged and cerebral glutamate was decreased without any signs of cerebral impairment. Urea and ammonia were significantly increased within normal limits without signs of organ dysfunction (urea: from 2.7âÂ±â1.6 to 5.5âÂ±â1.5Â mmol/ l; ammonia: from 12âÂ±â6.3 to 26âÂ±â8.3Â Î¼mol/ l; pâ<â0.05, ANOVA, post hoc Dunnâs test).

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of supplementation with 2% l-glutamine and 1% l-glutathione on neurons and enteric glial cells of ileum of diabetic rats. Thirty male Wistar rats have been used according to these group distributions: Normoglycemic (N), Normoglycemic supplemented with l-glutamine (NG), Normoglycemic supplemented with l-glutathione (NGO), Diabetic (D), Diabetic supplemented with l-glutamine (DG) and Diabetic supplemented with l-glutathione (DGO). After 120days, the ileum was processed for immunohistochemistry of HuC/D and S100Î². Quantitative and morphometric analysis have been performed. Diabetic rats presented a decrease in the number of neurons when compared to normoglycemic animals. However, diabetes was not associated with a change in glial density. l-Glutathione prevented the neuronal death in diabetic rats. l-Glutathione increased a glial proliferation in diabetic rats. The neuronal area in diabetic rats increased in relation to the normoglycemics. The diabetic rats supplemented with l-glutamine and l-glutathione showed a smaller neuronal area in comparison to diabetic group. The glial cell area was a decreased in the diabetics. The diabetic rats supplemented with l-glutamine and l-glutathione did not have significant difference in the glial cell body area when compared to diabetic rats. It is concluded that the usage of l-glutamine and l-glutathione as supplements presents both desired and side effects that are different for the same substance in considering normoglycemic or diabetic animals.

Excision wounds of size 500 mm(2) and depth 2 mm were made on the dorsal portion of male Wistar rats (230-250 g) and were used for the study of oral L-glutamine (1 g/kg) treatment on the rate of contraction of wound and epithelisation. Histological evaluation of wound tissue was also performed. Six-centimetre-long two linear-paravertebral incisions in male Wistar rats (230-250 g) were used to study the effect of L-glutamine (1 g/kg, p.o.) treatment on tensile strength, total protein and hydroxyproline content in the incision model. Oral administration of L-glutamine (1 g/kg) significantly decreased wound area, epithelisation period and wound index, whereas the rate of wound contraction significantly increased (P < 0Â·001) when compared with vehicle control rats in the excision wound model. Tensile strength, hydroxyproline content and protein level were significantly increased (P < 0Â·001) in L-glutamine (1 g/kg, p.o.)-treated rats when compared with vehicle control rats in the incision wound model. Histological evaluation of wound tissue from L-glutamine (1 g/kg, p.o.)-treated rats showed complete epithelialisation with new blood vessel formation and high fibrous tissues in the excision wound model. In conclusion, oral administration of l-glutamine (1 g/kg) promotes wound healing by acting on various stages of wound healing such as collagen synthesis, wound contraction and epithelialisation.

The bonding and coordination behavior in these complexes have been discussed on the basis of IR and 119Sn MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic studies in the solid-state. Their coordination behavior in solution has been discussed with the help of multinuclear ( 1H, 13C and 119Sn) NMR spectral studies. The 119Sn MÃ¶ssbauer and IR studies indicate that L-proline and trans-hydroxy- L-proline show similar coordination behavior towards organotin(IV) compounds. Pentacoordinate trigonal-bipyramidal and hexacoordinate octahedral structures, respectively, have been proposed for the tri- and diorganotin(IV) complexes of L-proline and trans-hydroxy- L-proline, in which the carboxylate group acts as bidentate group. L-Glutamine shows different coordination behavior towards organotin(IV) compounds, it acts as monoanionic bidentate ligand coordinating through carboxylate and amino group. The triorganotin(IV) complexes of L-glutamine have been proposed to have trigonal-bipyramidal environment around tin. The newly synthesized complexes have been tested for their antiinflammatory and cardiovascular activities. Their LD 50 values are >1000 mg kg -1.\n\nEarly Administration of Glutamine Protects Cardiomyocytes from Post-Cardiac Arrest Acidosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Yan-Ren; Li, Chao-Jui; Syu, Shih-Han; Wen, Cheng-Hao; Buddhakosai, Waradee; Wu, Han-Ping; Hsu Chen, Cheng; Lu, Huai-En; Chen, Wen-Liang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPostcardiac arrest acidosis can decrease survival. Effective medications without adverse side effects are still not well characterized. We aimed to analyze whether early administration of glutamine could improve survival and protect cardiomyocytes from postcardiac arrest acidosis using animal and cell models. Forty Wistar rats with postcardiac arrest acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) were included. They were divided into study (500âmg/kg L-alanyl-L-glutamine, n = 20) and control (normal saline, n = 20) groups. Each of the rats received resuscitation. The outcomes were compared between the two groups. In addition, cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were exposed to HBSS with different pH levels (7.3 or 6.5) or to culture medium (control). Apoptosis-related markers and beating function were analyzed. We found that the duration of survival was significantly longer in the study group ( p < 0.05). In addition, in pH 6.5 or pH 7.3 HBSS buffer, the expression levels of cell stress (p53) and apoptosis (caspase-3, Bcl-xL) markers were significantly lower in cardiomyocytes treated with 50âmM L-glutamine than those without L-glutamine (RT-PCR). L-glutamine also increased the beating function of cardiomyocytes, especially at the lower pH level (6.5). More importantly, glutamine decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased these cells' beating function at a low pH level.\n\nProtective effects of l-glutamine against toxicity of deltamethrin in the cerebral tissue\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVarol, Sefer; Ãzdemir, Hasan HÃ¼seyin; Ãevik, Mehmet UÄur; Altun, YaÅar; IbiloÄlu, Ibrahim; Ekinci, Aysun; IbiloÄlu, AslÄ±han Okan; Balduz, Metin; Arslan, Demet; Tekin, Recep; Aktar, Fesih; AluÃ§lu, Mehmet Ufuk\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Deltamethrin (DLM) is a broad-spectrum synthetic dibromo-pyrethroid pesticide that is widely used for agricultural and veterinary purposes. However, human exposure to the pesticide leads to neurotoxicity. Glutamine is one of the principal, free intracellular amino acids and may also be an antioxidant. This study was undertaken in order to examine the neuroprotective and antioxidant potential of l-glutamine against DLM toxicity in female Wistar albino rats. Materials and methods The rats were divided into the following groups (n=10): Group I: control (distilled water; 10 mL/kg, po one dose), Group II: l-glutamine (1.5 g/kg, po one dose), Group III: DLM (35 mg/kg, po one dose), and Group IV: DLM (35 mg/kg, po one dose) and l-glutamine (1.5 g/kg, po one dose after 4 hours). Total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1Î², and IL-6 levels and apoptosis were evaluated in brain tissue. Results DLM-treated animals had a significant increase in brain biochemical parameters, as well as TOS and TAS. Furthermore, the histopathological examination showed neuronal cell degeneration in the cerebral tissue. l-Glutamine treatment decreased the elevated brain levels of TOS and neuronal cell degeneration. There was no difference in tumor necrosis factor-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 levels between the groups. Conclusion l-Glutamine may reduce the toxic effects of DLM in the cerebral tissue through antioxidant properties.

For centuries, researchers have looked for ways to promote and accelerate fracture healing. This controlled animal study examines the effects of glutamine on fracture healing. The left tibias of 10 standardized albino rats were broken at the distal third to produce a closed fracture. L-glutamine/L-alanyl solution (2.0 mL/kg) was administered through the tail veins of half the rats for the first 7 d, and physiologic serum alone was given to the control group. On the 21st day, all rats were euthanized and their left legs removed; after histologic observation, the tibias were examined under light microscopy. In the glutamine-injected group, development of primary callus was quicker and more regular than in the control group. The control group produced insufficient fibrous callus, and the glutamine group attained formed cartilaginous callus. Glutamine was noted to have positive effects on healing of traumatically fractured bone through attainment of positive nitrogen balance. This effect was minimal in enhancing the quality of fracture healing under conditions of stress, but some effect was noted on the speed of healing. Further research is needed in this area.\n\nl-Glutamine supplementation promotes an improved energetic balance in Walker-256 tumor-bearing rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Heber Amilcar; Bazotte, Roberto Barbosa; Vicentini, Geraldo Emilio; Lima, Mariana Machado; Guarnier, Flavia Alessandra; Hermes-Uliana, Catchia; Frez, Flavia Cristina Vieira; Bossolani, Gleison Daion Piovezana; Fracaro, Luciane; FÃ¡varo, Larissa Dos Santos; Manzano, Mariana InocÃªncio; Zanoni, Jacqueline Nelisis\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe evaluated the effects of supplementation with oral l-glutamine in Walker-256 tumor-bearing rats. A total of 32 male Wistar rats aged 54 days were randomly divided into four groups: rats without Walker-256 tumor, that is, control rats (C group); control rats supplemented with l-glutamine (CG group); Walker-256 tumor rats without l-glutamine supplementation (WT group); and WT rats supplemented with l-glutamine (WTG group). l-Glutamine was incorporated into standard food at a proportion of 2 g/100 g (2%). After 10 days of the experimental period, the jejunum and duodenum were removed and processed. Protein expression levels of key enzymes of gluconeogenesis, that is, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, were analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, plasma corticosterone, glucose, insulin, and urea levels were evaluated. The WTG group showed significantly increased plasma glucose and insulin levels ( p < 0.05); however, plasma corticosterone and urea remained unchanged. Moreover, the WTG group showed increased immunoreactive staining for jejunal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and increased expression of duodenal glucose-6-phosphatase. Furthermore, the WTG group presented with less intense cancer cachexia and slower tumor growth. These results could be attributed, at least partly, to increased intestinal gluconeogenesis and insulinemia, and better glycemia maintenance during fasting in Walker-256 tumor rats on a diet supplemented with l-glutamine.\n\nInhibiting glutamine uptake represents an attractive new strategy for treating acute myeloid leukemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWillems, Lise; Jacque, Nathalie; Jacquel, Arnaud; Neveux, Nathalie; Trovati Maciel, Thiago; Lambert, Mireille; Schmitt, Alain; Poulain, Laury; Green, Alexa S.; Uzunov, Madalina; Kosmider, Olivier; Radford-Weiss, Isabelle; Moura, Ivan Cruz; Auberger, Patrick; Ifrah, Norbert; Bardet, ValÃ©rie; Chapuis, Nicolas; Lacombe, Catherine; Mayeux, Patrick; Tamburini, JÃ©rÃ´me\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCancer cells require nutrients and energy to adapt to increased biosynthetic activity, and protein synthesis inhibition downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has shown promise as a possible therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Glutamine contributes to leucine import into cells, which controls the amino acid/Rag/mTORC1 signaling pathway. We show in our current study that glutamine removal inhibits mTORC1 and induces apoptosis in AML cells. The knockdown of the SLC1A5 high-affinity transporter for glutamine induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor formation in a mouse AML xenotransplantation model. l-asparaginase (l-ase) is an anticancer agent also harboring glutaminase activity. We show that l-ases from both Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi profoundly inhibit mTORC1 and protein synthesis and that this inhibition correlates with their glutaminase activity levels and produces a strong apoptotic response in primary AML cells. We further show that l-ases upregulate glutamine synthase (GS) expression in leukemic cells and that a GS knockdown enhances l-aseâinduced apoptosis in some AML cells. Finally, we observe a strong autophagic process upon l-ase treatment. These results suggest that l-ase anticancer activity and glutamine uptake inhibition are promising new therapeutic strategies for AML.

Previously we reported that chronic consumption of the NNSs sucralose or L-glucose led to increased calories consumed post-exposure; however, a recent study suggested this effect occurs because NNSs acutely suppress food intake, leading to a caloric debt. Here we show that acute ingestion of sucralose in the context of a low-carbohydrate diet causes a pronounced increase in calories consumed. Moreover, neither sucralose nor L-glucose had a lasting effect on food intake during chronic exposure; however, both NNSs enhance food intake post-exposure. Together these data confirm that sucralose and L-glucose promote food intake under a variety of experimental conditions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We induced ERS by exposing the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2) to tunicamycin (TUNI) to explore the potential of l-glutamine to reduce ERS-induced apoptosis. Our experiments demonstrated that exposing cells to TUNI results in spontaneous ERS and encourages the upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Prolonged TUNI-induced ERS was found to increase apoptosis mediated by C/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), accompanied by GRP78 downregulation. Treatment with l-glutamine was found to promote cell proliferation within the growth medium but to have little effect in basic Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium. Finally, in the milieu of TUNI-induced ERS, l-glutamine was found to maintain a high level of GRP78, alleviate CHOP-mediated apoptosis and activate the inositol requiring enzyme 1Î± (IRE1Î±)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) axis. A specific inhibitor of the IRE1Î±-XBP1 axis reversed the protective effect of l-glutamine by blocking the expression of IRE1Î±/XBP1s. We propose that the functional effect of l-glutamine on intestinal health may be partly due to its modulation of ERS and CHOP-mediated apoptosis.

As glutamine can enhance immune function in animals, this study was conducted with mice to test the hypothesis that dietary glutamine supplementation will improve pregnancy outcome in PCV2-infected dams. Beginning on day 0 of gestation, mice were fed a standard diet supplemented with 1.0% L-glutamine or 1.22% L-alanine (isonitrogenous control). All mice were infected with PCV2 (2000 TCID50) on day 10 of gestation. On day 17 of gestation, six mice from each group were euthanized to obtain maternal tissues and fetuses for hematology and histopathology tests. The remaining mice continued to receive their respective diets supplemented with 1.0% L-glutamine or 1.22% L-alanine through lactation. The PCV2 virus was present in maternal samples (serum and lung) of most mice in the control group but was not detected in the glutamine-supplemented mice. Dietary glutamine supplementation reduced abortion, decreased fetal deaths, and enhanced neonatal survival. The glutamine treatment also reduced concentrations of interleukin-6, while increasing concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-Î± and C-reactive protein, in the maternal serum of mice. Furthermore, glutamine supplementation attenuated microscopic lesions in maternal tissues (lung, spleen, and liver). Collectively, these results indicate that dietary glutamine supplementation is beneficial for ameliorating reproductive failure in virus-infected mice. The findings support the notion that gestating dams require adequate amounts of dietary glutamine for the optimal survival and growth of embryos, fetuses, and neonates, and have important implications for nutritional support of mammals (including swine and humans) during gestation and lactation.\n\nSchiff bases attached L-glutamine and L-asparagine: first investigation on antimutagenic and antimicrobial analyses.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakiyan, Iffet; Anar, Mustafa; OÄÃ¼tcÃ¼, Hatice; Agar, Guleray; SarÄ±, NurÅen\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThis study was conducted to evaluate the antimutagenic and antimicrobial activities of Schiff bases attached L-glutamine and L-asparagine. Antibacterial activities of the compounds against S. aureus, Sh. dys. typ 7, L. monocytogenes 4b, E. coli, S. typhi H, S. epidermis, Br. abortus, M. luteus, B. cereus, P. putida, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans were studied. These compounds were investigated for antimutagenic properties against Aflatoxin BÄ± (AFBÄ±) using micronuclei (MN) assay in human lymphocyte cell culture in vitro. The protective role of these compounds against AFBÄ±-induced MN is probably related to its doses.\n\nImmunohistochemical study of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) enteric neurons in diabetic rats supplemented with L-glutamine.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlves, Eder Paulo Belato; Alves, Angela Maria Pereira; Pereira, Renata Virginia Fernandes; de Miranda Neto, MarcÃ­lio Hubner; Zanoni, Jacqueline Nelisis\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this work was to study the area of the varicosities of nerve fibers of myenteric neurons immunoreactive to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-IR) and of the cell bodies of VIP-IR submucosal neurons of the jejunum of diabetic rats supplemented with 2% L-glutamine. Twenty male rats were divided into the following groups: normoglycemic (N), normoglycemic supplemented with L-glutamine (NG), diabetic (D) and diabetic supplemented with L-glutamine (DG). Whole-mounts of the muscle tunica and the submucosal layer were subjected to the immunohistochemical technique for neurotransmitter VIP identification. Morphometric analyses were carried out in 500 VIP-IR cell bodies of submucosal neurons and 2000 VIP-IR varicosities from each group. L-Glutamine supplementation to the normoglycemic animals caused an increase in the areas of the cell bodies (8.49%) and varicosities (21.3%) relative to the controls (P < 0.05). On the other hand, there was a decrease in the areas of the cell bodies (4.55%) and varicosities (28.9%) of group DG compared to those of group D (P < 0.05). It is concluded that L-glutamine supplementation was positive both to normoglycemic and diabetic animals.\n\nThe neuropharmacology of L-theanine(N-ethyl-L-glutamine): a possible neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing agent.\n\nPubMed\n\nNathan, Pradeep J; Lu, Kristy; Gray, M; Oliver, C\n\n2006-01-01\n\nL-theanine (N-ethyl-L-glutamine) or theanine is a major amino acid uniquely found in green tea. L-theanine has been historically reported as a relaxing agent, prompting scientific research on its pharmacology. Animal neurochemistry studies suggest that L-theanine increases brain serotonin, dopamine, GABA levels and has micromolar affinities for AMPA, Kainate and NMDA receptors. In addition has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models possibly through its antagonistic effects on group 1 metabotrophic glutamate receptors. Behavioural studies in animals suggest improvement in learning and memory. Overall, L-theanine displays a neuropharmacology suggestive of a possible neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing agent and warrants further investigation in animals and humans.\n\nInfluence of Nutritional Conditions on Production of l-Glutamine by Flavobacterium rigense\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNabe, Koichi; Ujimaru, Toshihiko; Yamada, Shigeki; Chibata, Ichiro\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe nutritional conditions for the production of l-glutamine by Flavobacterium rigense strain 703 were investigated. The optimum concentration of ammonia for achieving the highest yield of l-glutamine (25 mg/ml of broth) was relatively broad, from 0.9 to 1.6%, whereas fumaric acid had a narrow optimum range, near 5.5%. High concentration of inorganic ions such as chloride or sulfate ion clearly inhibited cell growth. Therefore, ammonium salts other than (NH4)2-fumarate were unsuitable for the highest production. The optimum concentration of (NH4)2-fumarate was 7%. To reduce the concentration of fumaric acid in the medium, many substances were evaluated as substitutes. The fumaric acid concentration required for highest l-glutamine yield could not be replaced by any one of the compounds tested. However, part of fumaric acid could be replaced with succinic acid and cupric ion; 4% (NH4)2-fumarate plus 2.5% succinic acid or 5% (NH4)2-fumarate plus 1 mM cupric ion produced results similar to 7% (NH4)2-fumarate in the fermentation medium.

One important strategy used in the laboratory is the growth of cultures in the presence of an enzymatic substrate which, once transformed by the appropriate microbial enzyme, generates a detectable colour or fluorescence output. Such substrates have previously been prepared by our group and others and are available as commercial diagnostic kits, however they all suffer from some degree of diffusion when used in a solid growth medium. This diffusion complicates the detection and differentiation of species in polymicrobial cultures and so we sought to improve on our previous work. In this work we have prepared and evaluated a series of novel fluorogenic enzyme substrates based on N-substituted-2-aminoacridones. All of the prepared substrates were found to be suitable for the detection and differentiation of certain microorganisms, however those based on the 2-amino-10-benzylacridone core in particular showed no apparent diffusion when incorporated into solid growth media. On transformation these substrates generated brightly fluorescent colonies that are clearly contrasted with the background medium due to the difference in emission wavelength (Î»em 445-450 nm for the substrate, Î»em 550 nm for the product). Here we have shown that our L-alanyl aminopeptidase substrate, 2-(N-L-alanylamino)-10-benzylacridone, is particularly suited to the detection of Gram-negative bacteria, and our Î²-alanyl aminopeptidase substrate, 2-(N- Î²-alanylamino)-10-benzylacridone, to the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens when grown on solid media incorporating these substrates. The resulting fluorophore shows no apparent diffusion from the colonies of interest, and the enhanced sensitivity offered by fluorescent emission may allow for the detection of these organisms as microcolonies using automated fluorescence microscopy.\n\nAlanyl-glutamine dipeptide restores the cytoprotective stress proteome of mesothelial cells exposed to peritoneal dialysis fluids.\n\nPubMed\n\nKratochwill, Klaus; Boehm, Michael; Herzog, Rebecca; Lichtenauer, Anton Michael; Salzer, Elisabeth; Lechner, Michael; Kuster, Lilian; Bergmeister, Konstantin; Rizzi, Andreas; Mayer, Bernd; Aufricht, Christoph\n\n2012-03-01\n\nExposure of mesothelial cells to peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) results in cytoprotective cellular stress responses (CSR) that counteract PDF-induced damage. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the CSR may be inadequate in relevant models of peritoneal dialysis (PD) due to insufficient levels of glutamine, resulting in increased vulnerability against PDF cytotoxicity. We particularly investigated the role of alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) dipeptide on the cytoprotective PDF stress proteome. Adequacy of CSR was investigated in two human in vitro models (immortalized cell line MeT-5A and mesothelial cells derived from peritoneal effluent of uraemic patients) following exposure to heat-sterilized glucose-based PDF (PD4-Dianeal, Baxter) diluted with medium and, in a comparative proteomics approach, at different levels of glutamine ranging from depletion (0 mM) via physiological (0.7 mM) to pharmacological levels (8 mM administered as Ala-Gln). Despite severe cellular injury, expression of cytoprotective proteins was dampened upon PDF exposure at physiological glutamine levels, indicating an inadequate CSR. Depletion of glutamine aggravated cell injury and further reduced the CSR, whereas addition of Ala-Gln at pharmacological level restored an adequate CSR, decreasing cellular damage in both PDF exposure systems. Ala-Gln specifically stimulated chaperoning activity, and cytoprotective processes were markedly enhanced in the PDF stress proteome. Taken together, this study demonstrates an inadequate CSR of mesothelial cells following PDF exposure associated with low and physiological levels of glutamine, indicating a new and potentially relevant pathomechanism. Supplementation of PDF with pharmacological doses of Ala-Gln restored the cytoprotective stress proteome, resulting in improved resistance of mesothelial cells to exposure to PDF. Future work will study the clinical relevance of CSR-mediated cytoprotection.\n\nA multi-ingredient containing carbohydrate, proteins L-glutamine and L-carnitine attenuates fatigue perception with no effect on performance, muscle damage or immunity in soccer players.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaclerio, Fernando; Larumbe-Zabala, Eneko; Cooper, Robert; Allgrove, Judith; Earnest, Conrad P\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe investigated the effects of ingesting a multi-ingredient (53 g carbohydrate, 14.5 g whey protein, 5 g glutamine, 1.5 g L-carnitine-L-tartrate) supplement, carbohydrate only, or placebo on intermittent performance, perception of fatigue, immunity, and functional and metabolic markers of recovery. Sixteen amateur soccer players ingested their respective treatments before, during and after performing a 90-min intermittent repeated sprint test. Primary outcomes included time for a 90-min intermittent repeated sprint test (IRS) followed by eleven 15 m sprints. Measurements included creatine kinase, myoglobin, interleukine-6, Neutrophil; Lymphocytes and Monocyte before (pre), immediately after (post), 1 h and 24 h after exercise testing period. Overall, time for the IRS and 15 m sprints was not different between treatments. However, the perception of fatigue was attenuated (P<0.001) for the multi-ingredient (15.9Â±1.4) vs. placebo (17.8Â±1.4) but not for the carbohydrate (17.0Â±1.9) condition. Several changes in immune/inflammatory indices were noted as creatine kinase peaked at 24 h while Interleukin-6 and myoglobin increased both immediately after and at 1 h compared with baseline (P<0.05) for all three conditions. However, Myoglobin (P<0.05) was lower 1 h post-exercise for the multi-ingredient (241.8Â±142.6 ngÂ·ml(-1)) and CHO (265.4Â±187.8 ngÂ·ml(-1)) vs. placebo (518.6Â±255.2 ngÂ·ml(-1)). Carbohydrate also elicited lower neutrophil concentrations vs. multi-ingredient (3.9Â±1.5 10(9)/L vs. 4.9Â±1.8 10(9)/L, P = 0.016) and a reduced (P<0.05) monocytes count (0.36Â±0.09 10(9)/L) compared to both multi-ingredient (0.42Â±0.09 10(9)/L) and placebo (0.42Â±0.12 10(9)/L). In conclusion, multi-ingredient and carbohydrate supplements did not improve intermittent performance, inflammatory or immune function. However, both treatments did attenuate serum myoglobin, while only carbohydrate blunted post-exercise leukocytosis.\n\nA Multi-Ingredient Containing Carbohydrate, Proteins L-Glutamine and L-Carnitine Attenuates Fatigue Perception with No Effect on Performance, Muscle Damage or Immunity in Soccer Players\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNaclerio, Fernando; Larumbe-Zabala, Eneko; Cooper, Robert; Allgrove, Judith; Earnest, Conrad P.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe investigated the effects of ingesting a multi-ingredient (53g carbohydrate, 14.5g whey protein, 5g glutamine, 1.5g L-carnitine-L-tartrate) supplement, carbohydrate only, or placebo on intermittent performance, perception of fatigue, immunity, and functional and metabolic markers of recovery.

This study determined whether maternal binge alcohol exposure and L-glutamine supplementation could affect maternal-fetal hemodynamics and fetal regional brain blood flow during the brain growth spurt period. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to one of four groups: saline control, alcohol (1.75â2.5 g/kg body weight), glutamine (100 mg/kg body weight) or alcohol + glutamine. A chronic weekend binge drinking paradigm between gestational days (GD) 99 and 115 was utilized. Fetuses were surgically instrumented on GD 117 Â± 1 and studied on GD 120 Â± 1. Binge alcohol exposure caused maternal acidemia, hypercapnea, and hypoxemia. Fetuses were acidemic and hypercapnic, but not hypoxemic. Alcohol exposure increased fetal mean arterial pressure, whereas fetal heart rate was unaltered. Alcohol exposure resulted in ~40 % reduction in maternal uterine artery blood flow. Labeled microsphere analyses showed that alcohol induced >2-fold increases in fetal whole brain blood flow. The elevation in fetal brain blood flow was region-specific, particularly affecting the developing cerebellum, brain stem, and olfactory bulb. Maternal L-glutamine supplementation attenuated alcohol-induced maternal hypercapnea, fetal acidemia and increases in fetal brain blood flow. L-Glutamine supplementation did not affect uterine blood flow. Collectively, alcohol exposure alters maternal and fetal acidâbase balance, decreases uterine blood flow, and alters fetal regional brain blood flow. Importantly, L-glutamine supplementation mitigates alcohol-induced acidâbase imbalances and alterations in fetal regional brain blood flow. Further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms responsible for alcohol-induced programming of maternal uterine artery and fetal circulation adaptations in pregnancy.

Since abstinence from ethanol causes a hypodopaminergic and a hypoopioidergic environment in the reword system circuits, manifesting with withdrawal symptoms, food supplements that contains D-phenylalanine a peptidase inhibitor (of opioide inactivation) and L-amino-acids (for dopamine synthesis) were used to replenish a lack in neurotransmitters and alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 20 patients suffering from alcohol addictions starting a detoxification therapy have been included in a prospective, randomized, double blind study. The patients have been randomly devided in two groups. One group recieved for a period of 40 days a food supplement containing D-phenylalanine, L-glutamine and L-5-hydroxytriptophan (investigation group), and the control (placebo) group. On the first day of hospitalization the patients performed a SCL-90-R test, and blood samples were taken for measuring liver enzymes, total bilirubin, unbound cortisol and lymphocyte populations. The same was done on the 40th day of hospitalization. During the therapy a significant decrease in SCL-90-R psychiatric symptoms scores and a significant increase in CD4 lymphocyte count was observed in the investigation group. The cortisol values were significantly, but equally decreased in both groups, the same was with the liver enzymes and the total bilirubin values. We conclude that abstinence causes a major stress for the patients. The use of food supplement containing D-phenylalanine, L-glutamine and L-5-hydroxytriptophan alleviates the withdrawal symptoms and causes a rise in CD4 lymphocyte population, but it dose not affect the serum cortisol levels, which are probably more affected by liver inflammation and the liver restitution.\n\nA Tracer Bolus Method for Investigating Glutamine Kinetics in Humans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMori, Maiko; Smedberg, Marie; Klaude, Maria; TjÃ¤der, Inga; Norberg, Ã ke; Rooyackers, Olav; Wernerman, Jan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGlutamine transport between tissues is important for the outcome of critically ill patients. Investigation of glutamine kinetics is, therefore, necessary to understand glutamine metabolism in these patients in order to improve future intervention studies. Endogenous glutamine production can be measured by continuous infusion of a glutamine tracer, which necessitates a minimum measurement time period. In order to reduce this problem, we used and validated a tracer bolus injection method. Furthermore, this method was used to measure the glutamine production in healthy volunteers in the post-absorptive state, with extra alanine and with glutamine supplementation and parenteral nutrition. Healthy volunteers received a bolus injection of [1-13C] glutamine, and blood was collected from the radial artery to measure tracer enrichment over 90 minutes. Endogenous rate of appearance (endoRa) of glutamine was calculated from the enrichment decay curve and corrected for the extra glutamine supplementation. The glutamine endoRa of healthy volunteers was 6.1Â±0.9 Âµmol/kg/min in the post-absorptive state, 6.9Â±1.0 Âµmol/kg/min with extra alanyl-glutamine (pâ=â0.29 versus control), 6.1Â±0.4 Âµmol/kg/min with extra alanine only (pâ=â0.32 versus control), and 7.5Â±0.9 Âµmol/kg/min with extra alanyl-glutamine and parenteral nutrition (pâ=â0.049 versus control). In conclusion, a tracer bolus injection method to measure glutamine endoRa showed good reproducibility and small variation at baseline as well as during parenteral nutrition. Additionally, we showed that parenteral nutrition including alanyl-glutamine increased glutamine endoRa in healthy volunteers, which was not attributable to the alanine part of the dipeptide.

We randomly allocated 180 piglets to three treatments with three replicates of 20 piglets each, fed with diets containing 0.62% Ala, 0.5% Ala-Gln, 0.21% Ala+0.34% Gln, respectively. The duration of the experiment was 28Â d. The results showed that Ala-Gln increased average daily gain of piglets, and decreased the ratio of feed to gain (PÂ <Â 0.05). Ala-Gln supplementation increased the concentrations of Gln and glutamate and decreased the activity of glutamine synthetase in liver and skeletal muscle (PÂ <Â 0.05). Ala-Gln increased the expression of glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenate (PÂ <Â 0.05). The increased phosphorylation of eIF-4Â E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in Ala-Gln treatment were associated with phosphorylation of the mTOR in liver and skeletal muscle. Ala+Gln did not affect the phosphorylation abundances of mTOR, 4E-BP1, or S6K1 (PÂ >Â 0.05). Ala-Gln supplementation inhibited the mRNA expressions of MAFbx and MuRF1 in skeletal muscle of piglets (PÂ <Â 0.05). Taken together, Ala-Gln supplementation improved the growth performance of piglets, enhanced the metabolism of Gln, upregulated protein synthetic signaling in liver and skeletal muscle and decreased protein degradative signaling in muscle of piglets. Moreover, these effects of Ala-Gln were more effective than those of Ala+Gln. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Dysfunctional cellular stress responses aggravate peritoneal injury associated with PD fluid exposure, potentially due to peritoneal glutamine depletion. In this randomized cross-over phase I/II trial we investigated cytoprotective effects of alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln) addition to glucose-based PDF. Methods In a prospective randomized cross-over design, 20 stable PD outpatients underwent paired peritoneal equilibration tests 4 weeks apart, using conventional acidic, single chamber 3.86% glucose PD fluid, with and without 8 mM supplemental AlaGln. Heat-shock protein 72 expression was assessed in peritoneal effluent cells as surrogate parameter of cellular stress responses, complemented by metabolomics and functional immunocompetence assays. Results AlaGln restored peritoneal glutamine levels and increased the primary outcome heat-shock protein expression (effect 1.51-fold, CI 1.07â2.14; p = 0.022), without changes in peritoneal ultrafiltration, small solute transport, or biomarkers reflecting cell mass and inflammation. Further effects were glutamine-like metabolomic changes and increased ex-vivo LPS-stimulated cytokine release from healthy donor peripheral blood monocytes. In patients with a history of peritonitis (5 of 20), AlaGln supplementation decreased dialysate interleukin-8 levels. Supplemented PD fluid also attenuated inflammation and enhanced stimulated cytokine release in a mouse model of PD-associated peritonitis. Conclusion We conclude that AlaGln-supplemented, glucose-based PD fluid can restore peritoneal cellular stress responses with attenuation of sterile inflammation, and may improve peritoneal host-defense in the setting of PD.

Alterations in these parameters can persist into adulthood and low birth weight can lead to altered fetal programming. Glutamine has been associated with the synthesis of other amino acids, an increase in protein synthesis and it is used clinically as a nutrient supplement for low birth weight infants. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of repeated maternal alcohol exposure and L-glutamine supplementation on fetal growth and amino acid bioavailability during the third trimester-equivalent period in an ovine model. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to four groups, saline control, alcohol (1.75-2.5 g/kg), glutamine (100 mg/kg, three times daily) or alcohol + glutamine. In this study, a weekend binge drinking model was followed where treatment was done 3 days per week in succession from gestational day (GD) 109-132 (normal term ~147). Maternal alcohol exposure significantly reduced fetal body weight, height, length, thoracic girth and brain weight, and resulted in decreased amino acid bioavailability in fetal plasma and placental fluids. Maternal glutamine supplementation successfully mitigated alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction and improved the bioavailability of glutamine and glutamine-related amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and asparagine in the fetal compartment. All together, these findings show that L-glutamine supplementation enhances amino acid availability in the fetus and prevents alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction.\n\nResidual gastric volume evaluation with ultrasonography after ingestion of carbohydrate- or carbohydrate plus glutamine-enriched beverages: a randomized, crossover clinical trial with healthy volunteers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes, Paulo Cesar; Caporossi, Cervantes; Aguilar-Nascimento, Jose Eduardo; Silva, Ageo Mario Candido da; Araujo, Viviane Maeve Tavares de\n\n2017-01-01\n\n- Abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 hours with maltodextrin (CHO)-enriched beverage is a safe procedure and may enhance postoperative recovery. Addition of glutamine (GLN) to CHO beverages may include potential benefits to the metabolism. However, by adding a nitrogenous source to CHO beverages, gastric emptying may be delayed and increase the risk of bronchoaspiration during anesthesia. - In this study of safety, we aimed at investigating the residual gastric volume (RGV) 2 hours after the intake of either CHO beverage alone or CHO beverage combined with GLN. - We performed a randomized, crossover clinical trial. We assessed RGV by means of abdominal ultrasonography (US) in 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) after an overnight fast of 8 hours. Then, they were randomized to receive 600 mL (400 mL immediately after US followed by another 200 mL 2 hours afterwards) of either CHO (12.5% maltodextrin) or CHO-GLN (12.5% maltodextrin plus 15 g GLN). Two sequential US evaluations were done at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of the second dose. The interval of time between ingestion of the two types of beverages was 2 weeks. - The mean (SD) RGV observed after 8 hours fasting (13.56Â±13.25 mL) did not statistically differ (P>0.05) from the RGV observed after ingesting CHO beverage at both 120 (16.32Â±11.78 mL) and 180 minutes (14.60Â±10.39 mL). The RGV obtained at 120 (15.63Â±18.83 mL) and 180 (13.65Â±10.27 mL) minutes after CHO-GLN beverage also was not significantly different from the fasting condition. - The RGV at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of CHO beverage combined with GLN is similar to that observed after an overnight fast.\n\nEffects of L-glutamine on rectal temperature and some markers of oxidative stress in Red Sokoto goats during the hot-dry season.\n\nPubMed\n\nOcheja, Ohiemi Benjamin; Ayo, Joseph Olusegun; Aluwong, Tagang; Minka, Ndazo Salka\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe experiment investigated the ameliorative effects of L-glutamine administration on rectal temperature (RT), erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), serum antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in Red Sokoto goats during the hot-dry season. Twenty eight healthy Red Sokoto goats, comprising 14 experimental (administered 0.2Â g/kg of L-glutamine dissolved in 10Â mL of distilled water, once daily for 21Â days) and 14 control (administered equivalent of distilled water) goats served as subjects. Rectal temperature (measured at 6:00, 13:00 and 18:00Â h) and blood samples (taken at 8:00Â h) were obtained from all subjects weekly, before, during and after L-glutamine administration. Data obtained were compared using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. The dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity and temperature-humidity index for the study period ranged between 24.0 and 37.5Â Â°C, 26.0 and 84.0% and 73.0 and 86.3, respectively. L-glutamine administration decreased (PÂ <Â 0.05) RT, EOF and MDA and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in experimental group, compared to controls during weeks 1, 2 and 3. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase activities were higher (PÂ <Â 0.05) in the experimental group than in the controls only during week 1 of L-glutamine administration. In conclusion, L-glutamine administration mitigated increases in RT, EOF and serum MDA concentration and enhanced serum SOD, GPx and catalase activities and may be beneficial in heat-stressed goats during the hot-dry season.\n\nGlutamine and alanyl-glutamine dipeptide reduce mesenteric plasma extravasation, leukocyte adhesion and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) release during experimental endotoxemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nScheibe, R; Schade, M; Grundling, M; Pavlovic, D; Starke, K; Wendt, M; Retter, S; Murphy, M; Suchner, U; Spassov, A; Gedrange, T; Lehmann, Ch\n\n2009-12-01\n\nGlutamine (GLN) appears to be an essential nutrient during organism development and critical illness.
