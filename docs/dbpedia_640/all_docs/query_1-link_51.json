Brueghel’s paintings represent cultural attitudes towards nature, such as the taxonomic schemes of natural history catalogues of the time. The categories employed by contemporary naturalists to characterize animals also reveal a pansophic approach; they defined species in terms of their literary, biblical, or morphological associations. Brueghel, like the sixteenth-century natural historians Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi, combined empirical methods with textual knowledge to achieve a comprehensive and veristic representation of animals that incorporated different systems of belief. Brueghel’s development of the paradise landscape, which paralleled his encounters with patrons and collectors who had a keen interest in nature, reveals the evolution of his descriptive and cataloguing approach in which he applied the prevalent scientific and religious schemes of ordering the universe. His paintings chronologically follow Ulisse Aldrovandi’s methodology in which description leads to definition, definition to classification, and classification to knowledge.

Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles). Brueghel was the first artist to classify species using the format of a panel painting. He adhered to Aldrovandi’s division of species into homogeneous groups based on biological and physical resemblance. Furthermore, by depicting animals’ behavior and natural habitats, Brueghel translated the written information in natural history catalogues into a pictorial format. The naturalistic description of animals formed the basis of Brueghel’s approach, but his ultimate quest for an appropriate framework within which to present species led to his formulation of an encyclopedic representation that incorporated the scientific, religious, courtly, and artistic language of his time.

PREFACE My research on Jan Brueghel’s paradise landscapes grew out of five years of practically living with his Entry o f the Animals into Noah's Ark in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. The more I studied the painting the more I realized how little we know about the artist, in particular his approach to nature. The extant literature on Jan Brueghel the Elder does not include a careful examination of his paradise landscapes and animal representations. Klaus Ertz, in his monograph on the artist and in the recent exhibition catalogue Breughel-Brueghel, has never done more than present a straightforward formalistic analysis of Brueghel's oeuvre. His catalogue raisonne is a good reference book and starting point, despite some of his questionable attributions. The catalogue of Flemish paintings in the Prado Museum by Matias Diaz Padron is useful, because it addresses some of these problems of attribution and attempts to clarify them. More work has been done on Brueghel’s flower paintings, the most important of which is by Beatrijs Brenninkmeyer-De Rooij, who examines his working methods and discusses the artist’s juxtaposition of copies after botanical prints and studies from nature. Matthias Winner’s lengthy articles on the drawings are somewhat comprehensive except for the absence of the sketches of animals that I found most useful to my research. Important documentation exists in the form of Brueghel’s letters to Cardinal Borromeo, published by Giovanni Crivelli. Jean Denuce and Charles Duvivier compiled other letters and documentation revealing some of the activities of Brueghel and his son Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A thorough analysis of Brueghel's landscapes and flower paintings in the collection of Borromeo appears in Pamela Jones’s book Federico Borromeo and the Ambrosiana. She explains how these works can be understood within the context of the Cardinal’s religious and aesthetic views. Finally, Stefania Bedoni attempted to reconstruct the painter’s travels throughout Italy as well as Italian collectors’ interest in his work. I have consulted many relevant scholars to whom I am grateful for their expertise. Numerous discussions with Lee Hendrix have helped me unravel the connection between Hoefnagel and Brueghel. Michael Jaffe, David Jaffe, and Julius Held have shared their views with me on the relationship between Rubens and Brueghel and the possible sources for their animal representations. Fritz Koreny, the foremost expert on nature imagery in Northern Renaissance art, has discussed his ideas about artists’ nature studies with me on separate occasions. For information on zoological collections in the Netherlands and Italy, I consulted Fernand Schrevens, the curator of the Antwerp Zoo library, Arthur MacGregor, Lucia Tongiorgio Tomasi, and Paula Findlen. I am grateful to David Rimlinger, Curator of Birds at the San Diego Zoo, and John Allman, Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, for their assistance with the identifications of animals and birds. I have also benefited from conversations with others, in particular Melanie Gifford on the techniques of Brueghel, and Karl SchQtz on the paintings in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, who supported and encouraged my pursuits for many years. Most of all, I am grateful to my husband, Christophe, who has been a constant source of inspiration, support, and compassion during the entire process.

In Brueghel's works, a multitude of exotic and native European species coexist harmoniously in a lush landscape setting. While he studied the majority of the animals from life, he also selectively imitated artistic sources. In the early modem period, the naturalistic representation of animals did not always depend solely on direct observation, but on artistic knowledge and interpretation as well. Insofar as the descriptive process was not necessarily synonymous with objective viewing, Brueghel’s interpretative description encodes cultural attitudes towards nature, such as the taxonomic schemes of natural history catalogues of the time. These contributed to the complexity of his pictorial negotiation of multiple paradigms. The novelty of Brueghel's paradise landscapes lies in the impressive assemblage of animals studied mainly from life and presented simultaneously as figures of a religious narrative and subjects of a scientific order. The examination of this combination of approaches forms the basis of my dissertation. Despite a common biblical subject matter, the few earlier paradise landscapes by Hieronymus Bosch and Lucas Cranach I differ from Brueghel’s paintings in their imaginary and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

In this respect, his representations have more in common with the naturalistic independent animal studies by artists, such as Albrecht Diirer. However, such images display different approaches and functions from Brueghel's paradise landscapes. Diirer’s monumental representations have an empirical value because of their isolated and accurate depiction. Like other forms of painting from life, including portraits or cityscapes, they sometimes have a documentary status, especially when they are inscribed with dates and identifications. Brueghel’s presentation of a wide range of species within an artificial composition, on the other hand, was not meant to function as a record of a specific moment. In this dissertation I intend to determine the nature of Brueghel's approach to describing animals and see what role the cultural context may have played in the development of his paradise landscape. The two main elements to be considered are the strategies employed in the artistic representation of animals, and the scientific and cultural attitudes of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in particular the privileging of empirical evidence as opposed to inherited tradition in natural historical inquiry. I shall place Brueghel’s landscapes within a culture that produced some of the first scholarly catalogues and encyclopedias. Was his 1 Only a few earlier variants of the paradise landscape genre exist in paintings, most notably Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden o f Eden of ca. 1500 (Prado, Madrid), Lucas Cranach I's Adam and Eve in Paradise of 1530 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), Herri met de Bles’s Garden o f Eden of 1525-1530 (Mauritshuis, the Hague), Frans Pourbus I’s Orpheus Enchanting the Animals of 1570 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

I shall demonstrate that Brueghel’s particular approach to nature imagery and landscapes together with the cataloguing culture of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century contributed to the unique character of his paradise landscapes, which functioned as visual catalogues o f nature. In his works, the linguistic mode of the natural history encyclopedia, in which the illustrations are accompanied by texts, was supplanted by purely visual descriptions. Thus, his paintings, in effect, translated the written information provided by the catalogue into a pictorial format. In other words, they replaced words with images. Chapter One establishes Brueghel’s process of representing animals and addresses the fundamental issue of the imitation of nature versus the imitation of art in the description of animals, paying particular attention to Brueghel’s drawings and oil sketches. I shall demonstrate how these different strategies contributed to the perception of “naturalism” during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Since Brueghel’s depictions of animals often remain inseparable from their overall function in the paradise landscapes, they must be viewed within a cultural context. Thus, in Chapter Two I examine the culture of cataloguing as well as the tradition of animal and landscape painting that constitutes Brueghel’s artistic grounding.

Together they provide the foundation for his contextualization of animals in paradise landscapes. Chapters Three, Four, and Five deal with Brueghel’s application of religious and scientific strategies of interpreting and organizing nature. His encounters with different patrons demonstrate the role that the cultural context played and the way Brueghel traversed ecclesiastic and courtly realms, developing tools that he applied to his paintings. The chronology of Brueghel’s works reveals the evolution of his articulation of the paradise theme and his impulse to catalogue species. His approach paralleled the methodology of sixteenth-century naturalists, which involved the consecutive processes of description, naming, and classification. At the same time, his paradise landscapes followed the narrative sequence of Genesis. Brueghel’s reference to the naming of the animals in his Creation o f Adam and his emphasis on the subsequent scientific step of ordering in the Allegory o f the Four Elements and The Entry o f the Animals into Noah’ s Ark corresponded to the taxonomic process of zoologists. In Chapter Five I focus on Brueghel’s painting of The Entry o f the Animals into Noah’ s Ark as the culmination of the artist’s efforts to achieve a visual equivalent to natural historical description and classification. I have applied an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Brueghel’s depictions of animals, because the nature of the subject matter requires an exploration of Renaissance zoology, religious views on nature, and the culture of collecting and cataloguing animals and naturalia.

Textual knowledge is also the thread that ties Brueghel’s paradise landscapes together.

I shall therefore demonstrate the critical role drawings and oil sketches played in his description of animals ad vivum. A discussion of the imitation of nature as opposed to the imitation of art is fundamental to understanding how Brueghel, or for that matter any other artist interested in the depiction of species, approached his subject. How does the purely experiential method of studying a specimen first-hand differ from the reliance on artistic knowledge? What were the purposes of these approaches? Although Brueghel seems to depend mainly on live species for his paradise landscapes, he imitates Peter Paul Rubens’s depictions of the horse, lions, and leopards in the Entry o f the Animals into Noah’ s Ark of 1613 (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles). How then does one reconcile Brueghel’s experiential approach with this imitative one? I shall address this question by examining the nature of Brueghel’s imitation of an artistic source and ascertain how it relates to the methods of other artists as well as to standard theories of depicting animals. This will help us to understand the perception of naturalism at the time. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

His oeuvre consists of about 150 extant drawings, ranging primarily from Italian ruins, city views, and landscapes, to figure and animal studies.1 Most of them function in a similar manner as observations of nature and daily life. Brueghel’s consistent use of watercolor, already evident in his earliest drawings of the 1590s, supports Karel van Mander’s statement that Brueghel studied with his grandmother, the miniaturist Mayeken Verhulst Bessemers.2 His combination of pen and brush endows his drawings with an atmospheric and naturalistic quality that the medium of chalk, which he never used, could not achieve. Unfortunately, we only know of two independent animal drawings by Brueghel. His drawing of ostriches in gouache and watercolor, and pen and brown ink depicts the full body of the bird as well as a sketch of its head (Fig. 2).3 The ostrich appears in the same manner in his Entry o f the Animals into Noah's Ark and in a different pose in his Allegory o f Air in the Doria Pamphilj Collection (See figs. 31, 88). Brueghel might have seen an ostrich at the court of the Emperor Rudolf Q in Prague, since one appears in Rudolfs bestiary entitled Museum, which was begun 1 For the most useful discussion of Brueghel’s drawings, see M. Winner, “Zeichnungen des Alteren Jan Brueghel,” Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 3 (1961): 190-241; M. Winner, “Neubestimmtes und Unbestimmtes im Zeichnerischen Werk von Jan Brueghel d.

Brueghel was evidently impressed by the height of the ostrich, since he inscribed its measurements in the upper right: “9 voeten hooghe” (9 feet high). This inscription implies that he saw the bird in person. The color notations articulate what he apparently could not accomplish with the faint watercolors. They suggest the further possibility that he may not have had enough time to carefully color the ostrich if, indeed, he had studied a live specimen. Brueghel’s inclusion of such notations reveals the important role that color often played in the description of a species and demonstrates his application of artistic vocabulary to the observation of nature. In other words, the spectrum or catalogue of colors, which was readily available to the artist, allowed Brueghel to accurately describe the specimen using his own terminology. His contemporary Jacques de Gheyn II even created a catalogue of colors in which he described every shade that he could produce.5 In a sense, the palette provided painters with an artistic form of classification. Color notations appear frequently in sixteenth-century artists’ animal studies. Jacques de Gheyn Q inscribed his studies of a porcupine fish in pen and black ink 3 Sale, Sotheby’s New York, January 20, 1982. 4 Cod. min. 129-130, Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna. See H. Haupt et al., Le Bestiaire de Rodolphe II: Cod min. 129 et 130 de la Bibliotheque nationale d'Autriche (Paris: Citadelles, 1990). 5 Van Mander describes this book in his Schilder-Boeck: “...he divided a panel up into some hundred squares and marked them with numbers in figures in a little book and painted these squares with various colours, various shades, greens, yellows, blues, reds, flesh colours and other mixtures, giving each as much as he could its own shade, and for each of them wrote that down separately in the little book, as described.” Van Mander, Schilder-Boeck, fo l. 294v.

For example, a pencil drawing of flying fish (fol. 18), a large boar’s head (fol. 39), and the head of an ibex in black chalk (fol. 47) all have inscriptions denoting the colors of the species. It seems only natural that an artist would make his first sketch in pen or pencil, since a live animal could not be relied upon to pose long enough for a detailed watercolor. The precise watercolors of fish by Jacopo Ligozzi and Giorgio Liberate were also first drawn in o pencil. Albrecht Dttrer’s silverpoint drawing of a seated lion that he saw in Ghent demonstrates the preliminary stage of describing an animal without color (Fig. 4). He manages to successfully capture the features of the beast with the most economic use of line. His inscription “Zw Gent” validates it as a study from life; indeed, he saw this particular lion in Ghent in 1S21 during his trip to the Netherlands and mentions this drawing in his diary.9 Brueghel’s other independent drawing in the Louvre of roosters in pen and ink depicts them from six different angles (Fig. S). As in the ostrich drawing, 6 See K. G.

He must have studied it from life, since he could not physically move around a stationary two-dimensional image the way he could a live model. Unlike the ostrich, the rooster was a common bird that he could have observed anywhere. Such a study might therefore not require certain descriptive tools, such as color notations. His encounter with the ostrich was probably a rare one that necessitated a more careful record of its appearance. More common in Brueghel’s oeuvre are drawings of animals in landscapes, such as his brown ink and watercolor drawing of Deer in the Park o f Mariemont Castle (Fig. 6).1 0 In this drawing he depicts deer grazing and resting at Mariemont Castle, a scene that recalls his numerous paintings of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella in the gardens of their various estates, often surrounded by animals and birds. He later used this study for a painting of the Infanta in the Park o f Mariemont of about 1621 (Prado, Madrid). This study, like most of his landscape drawings, which include horses and cattle, reflects Brueghel’s particular approach to animals. The function of these drawings differs from that of an independent study due to the landscape settings. The animals form part of an environment and therefore do not become the exclusive subject matter. For this reason they do not receive the same careful attention as Brueghel’s sketches of birds. 1 0 See Cabinet d ’ un Amateur.

In Brueghel’s Study o f Horses, Carriages, and Peasants in the Albertina, Vienna, he pays particular attention to the various positions of the horse, especially its hind legs (Fig. 7). Brueghel drew all the poses close together and seems to have worked from left to right. Since each configuration appears to evolve from the previous one, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether each pose is observed from life or whether one study alone provided the basis for the subsequent views. A sketch of horse drawn carriages and cows in the Courtauld Institute Galleries, London, further demonstrates Brueghel’s careful observation of an animal’s anatomy. He used gray wash to model the animals with fine hatching as well as broader strokes. The preparatory drawing of birds for the Allegory o f Air of ca. 1611 in the Doria Pamphilj Collection does not qualify as a study from life, but rather as a compositional sketch (Fig. 8). The extraordinary juxtaposition of such a large variety of birds would have been impossible in actuality. In the final painting, Brueghel strayed slightly from the preparatory drawing by moving some of the birds around. He left a space in the drawing for the allegorical figure, which Hendrick van Balen painted. This drawing provides some insight into the process of creating a collaborative painting. In this case, Brueghel evidently dictated the composition, since for him the representation of the birds was the most important element of the painting.

Indeed, a natural question that arises is why there are so few extant drawings of animals by Brueghel. The most logical explanation is that such drawings would likely have been destroyed through repeated use in the copying process. The numerous copies of Brueghel’s paradise landscapes by his son and workshop attest to the existence of pattern drawings used for the mechanical reproduction of paintings. Furthermore, the collaborative nature of many of Brueghel’s works, as well as his own imitation of Rubens’s animals, demonstrates the widespread interaction between various workshops in Antwerp. This practice of exchanging motifs was quite common and not limited to the Netherlands.1 3 As with early sixteenth-century Netherlandish landscape drawings, which were a newer art form at the time, animal studies done naer het leven were probably in high demand in the late sixteenth century.1 4 Exotic animal motifs in particular were oflen repeated precisely, probably because few artists had access to such rare specimens.

Some examples of workshop copies after Brueghel’s sketches demonstrate the influence of his inventions. His Country Road with Peasants Going to Market in the Albertina is beautifully drawn with blue wash. What was the purpose of this drawing? Did it function as a study from life, as a model for the workshop, or both? The answer can be partly found in a drawn copy by a member of his workshop in the Albertina (Fig. 9). The copyist was unable to master the anatomy of the horses and figures, which appear shorter and rather stocky. He also overlooked certain details due to his lack of technical finesse. The Study Sheet with Carts, Livestock, Country Folk and Horsemen by Brueghel’s workshop in the Rijksprentenkabinet provides further insight into workshop methods and reveals the pedagogical function of model drawings (Fig. 10).1 5 On the recto the copyist imitated motifs from some of Brueghel’s paintings in a manner that recalls the pattern sheets in model- or sketchbooks. He or someone else then traced the drawing on the verso to practice executing the motifs. Such workshop copies can be rather easily distinguished from Brueghel’s studies of figures and animals ad vivum. The copyist’s tight delineation of figures, which do not overlap each other, differs from the fluid and unrestrained technique of Brueghel’s life studies. Since we know of similar study sheets by both Brueghel and his workshop, one assumes that many more were circulated in his 1 5 M. Schapelhouman, Nederlandse tekeningen omstreeks 1600 (S’Gravenhage: Staatsuitgeverij, 1987), 24. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 14 studio. Brueghel’s sketches of people and horses provided artists with a large repertory of motifs for paintings. Brueghel’s other drawings that study figures from life display a comparable approach to his animal sketches. His Sketches o f Peasants in the Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth, the Laundresses in the Nationalmuseum Stockholm, and the Sketches o f Market Folk and Horses in the Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts in Brussels demonstrate Brueghel’s preoccupation with people going about their daily chores (Figs. 11, 12). He closely observed their movements and interactions with other figures. His descriptive process involved first recording the appearance of a peasant rather carefully and then rendering the various poses in a cursory fashion. Like the drawing of roosters, the figures are shown from numerous angles. These sketches have a different function from those of animals, which are records of specific species. The men and women who inhabit Brueghel’s drawings do not have individual facial features, but rather represent more generic peasant types, since his main concern in this instance was to record their activities and movements. He was particularly preoccupied with the horse’s anatomy in the Brussels sketch, since he drew various positions of its legs. He dated this sketch “1 februwari 1602,” thereby providing the scene with some specificity and veracity. Dates, like signatures, tend to authenticate an image in the eye of the beholder. For Brueghel, such an inscribed drawing probably functioned in a mnemonic manner resembling a diary entry. Similarly, Savery’s pen and brown ink peasant studies in Berlin include color Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The function of Brueghel’s sketches, such as the one in Brussels, as records of his direct observations becomes more apparent when seen in the context of the rest of his drawings oeuvre, which consists of a large number of topographical and site-specific studies. He drew many accurate views of towns, including Rome, Naples and Prague, as well as Italian ancient ruins and palaces, such as Tervuren, which are easily recognizable.1 6 His drawing of the town of Spa (Fondation Custodia, Paris) records the appearance of the houses in the square with precision and is inscribed “Spa Bruegel fee. a di 22 Agusto 1612.”1 7 Again, the inscription authenticates the drawing for the viewer. Brueghel cherished such specific views, since he placed them within his painted landscapes. This variety of actual sites for his backdrops afforded him with a wider repertory of motifs. Brueghel often inserted actual Italian ruins, such as the Temple of Sibilla Tiburtina in Tivoli, in his landscapes, predominantly coastal ones.1 8 This motif, which he recorded in a drawing dated 1593 (Fig. 13) recurs in two paintings he produced in Rome: the Rest on the Flight into Egypt in a private collection and the Coastal Landscape with the 1 6 For his numerous drawings of Italian views and ruins, see Winner, “Zeichnungen des Alteren Jan Brueghel,” 190-241; and Winner, “Neubestimmtes un Unbestimmtes,” 122-160. 1 7 Winner, “Zeichnungen des Alteren Jan Brueghel,” 219-220. 1 8 His numerous drawings of Italian views and monuments indicate that Brueghel, like his father, primarily studied the topography during his stay in Italy, which offered much more diversity than the flat countryside of the Netherlands.

Interestingly, his paradise landscapes with Adam and Eve, which feature somewhat wooded landscapes, do not include Italian motifs or any other specific monuments. Apparently, Brueghel found coastal landscapes more appropriate for the inclusion of Italian buildings and ruins. While Brueghel relied on his accurate skills of observation for the topographical and animal drawings, he applied different descriptive tools to each: dates and locations as opposed to color and height notations. Brueghel’s Oil Sketches of Animals Brueghel’s four known oil panel sketches provide us with more substantial examples of animal studies.2 0 He used many of the animal motifs as models for some of his paradise landscapes and hunting scenes. His sketch in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, includes numerous studies of monkeys, donkeys, and cats (Fig. 14). One of the monkeys is a cercopithecus preussi, which is the same as the one in the Entry o f the Animals into Noah's Ark. The other one is a cebus apela, called a brown capuchin 1 9 See Ertz’s discussion in Breughel-Brueghel: Flamische Malerei um 1600, Tradition und Fortschritt, exh. cat (Essen: Kulturstifhing Ruhr Essen, and Vienna: Kunsthistorisches Museum, 1997), 144-146, 199-200. 2 0 For the panels in Vienna, see K.

He painted the entire bodies of the cercopithecus preussi, donkey, and cat with careful attention to their coloration and hair. Brueghel also made detailed studies of their heads nearby, recalling his drawings of an ostrich and roosters. His pure outline drawings of the donkey examine it from different angles and in several poses.2 2 Brueghel demonstrates the various degrees of representing an animal, ranging from the basic delineation of its contours to its modeling and coloring. The overlapping studies of the cat on the right display a particularly interesting technique, since they appear to grow out of one another organically. Each form evolves into another in a fluid and natural manner. Brueghel applied the same descriptive approach to his oil sketch of dogs in the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Fig. 15). He evidently had a hunting scene in mind, since he included a bleeding boar on the right and used the dogs for his paintings of Diana on the Hunt that he painted with Rubens and Hendrick van Balen.2 3 Four different types of pure bred hunting dogs, which most likely belonged to the Archdukes Albert and 211 am grateful to John Allman at the California Institute of Technology for identifying these species.

Brueghel shows the beagles, known for their excitability, in rather animated poses. Jan Brueghel the Younger also painted an oil sketch of dogs, which includes a black and white hound that he copied after his father’s sketch.2 4 He used the study in preparation for his Sleeping Nymphs Watched by Satyrs, also copied after his father.2 5 Another sketch on panel attributed to Brueghel depicts ducks and other birds, many of which, such as the northern lapwing, recur in the Entry o f the Animals into Noah's Ark (Fig. 16).2 6 Again, he observes them in various poses, flying, walking, and sitting. As in the other sketches, he isolates some of the birds’ heads and describes them more precisely. Brueghel’s Oil Sketch o f a Pheasant, Deer, Bird, and Monkeys is slightly different, since it includes fewer species, two of which, the pheasant and deer, are clearly dead (Fig. 17). Such studies of inanimate creatures were relatively common among artists for practical reasons. In this case, Brueghel needed examples of dead game for The Return from the Hunt painted with Rubens and Van Balen in 1620 (Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlung, Schloss Schleissheim). The monkey, which resembles a talapoin, appears to be drawn from life in two different poses. It recurs in exactly the same manner holding cherries in the Madonna and Child in a Garland in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich (See fig. 116). by Brueghel and Van Balen (private collection). 2 4 Sale, Sotheby’s Amsterdam, November 14, 1990.

What was the likelihood of Brueghel having some of these animals brought to his studio or painting them on panel ert plein air? This latter practice is virtually unheard of during this period and only becomes a common practice centuries later. Sixteenth-century artists, such as John White (d. ca. 1593) who accompanied Sir Walter Raleigh on explorations to America in 1585 and 1587, produced mainly watercolor drawings of observations of flora and fauna in the wilderness.2 7 Besides its easy and practical transportability, watercolor could convey the illusionistic effect of a live specimen.2 8 Brueghel, however, did not have to travel long distances to depict certain rare animals, many of which formed part of the Brussels menagerie of his patrons the Archdukes Albert and Isabella.2 9 He therefore could have easily recorded the animals directly on panel. In any case, the accurate appearance and behavior of exotic species, such as the cercopithecus preussi which does not appear in any artistic or natural historical illustration, leaves little doubt that Brueghel employed an experiential approach based on direct observation. The status of the sketches as records of nature can in turn be linked to their practical purpose as pedagogical aids in the workshop. They probably functioned in a 2 7 See P.

The inaccessibility of the exotic monkeys, which Brueghel probably observed in the Archdukes’ menagerie, contributed to their value as studies done from life. Brueghel’s workshop and followers apparently considered his animal representations to be the epitome of what was natural and, as a result, imitated them. In addition to the oil sketches of animals by his son and followers, the copies of his paradise landscapes, which range from faithful replicas by his son and workshop to freer variant copies by his followers, reveal the extensive influence of his first-hand observations. Brueghel’s son, Jan the Younger (1601-1678), inherited his father’s technique, since he produced eight known oil sketches on panel, predominantly depicting animals, birds, and figures.3 0 His Sketch o f Roebucks shows the animals in three different poses with an emphasis on their heads (Fig. 18). Jan borrowed these motifs from his father’s paintings of St. Hubertus. Similarly, his other sketches also tend to imitate Jan I’s depictions. Ertz dates most of Jan’s sketches to around 1620, before Jan Q embarked upon his trip to Italy. The stylistic difference between the father’s and son’s sketches is apparent in the more careful and forced delineation of Jan n’s studies, often the sign of a copyist. Jan II’s copies demonstrate the didactic role that his father’s oil sketches played in the workshop. 3 0 For illustrations and descriptions of Jan II's oil sketches, see Ertz, Jan Brueghel der Jungere, 501- 507.

They provide a useful comparison to Brueghel’s oil sketches due to their similar subject matter and approaches, and frequent use of color. Many medieval and early Renaissance modelbooks, particularly the ones from Lombardy, include animals, because they were difficult to capture in still poses. Giovannino de’Grassi’s sheets of animals in his '‘Bergamo modelbook” of ca. 1400 are drawn in detail with coloration and usually display more than one species on each page.3 1 The watercolor on folio 4, which depicts an eagle, squirrel, lion, goat, and falcons, includes the names of the animals. Another sheet represents a variety of birds in profile and fastidiously rendered in watercolor (Fig. 19).3 2 Apparently De’Grassi understood that an animal's description was incomplete without the combination of outline and color. The later sketchbooks of animals of the 1420s and 1430s by Antonio Pisanello resemble Brueghel’s more closely in their attention to movement and free graphic expression. Pisanello sacrificed the precise technique of his early modelbook drawings of animals, which have lifeless appearances, for the spontaneous and informal pen sketches of species drawn ad vivum.3 3 His Studies o f a Peacock in pen and ink in the Louvre are sketched freely from life in various positions (Fig. 20). His 3 1 Taccuino di disegni, cassaf. 1.21, Biblioteca Civica A. Mai, Bergamo. See R. W. Scheller, A Survey o f Medieval Model Books (Haarlem: Erven F. Bohn, 1963), 7, 12, 22-29; and F.

The duck and dog, which are shown from two sides, are most likely first-hand observations. They could be easily studied, since the duck is dead and the dog is sleeping. Like Brueghel’s sketches, this sheet shows the animals and birds from different angles and in color. The animals’ clearly defined presentation in two tiers resembles early modelbooks. The Sloane book of sixteenth-century northern natural history drawings entitled Vishen, Vogelen, Dieren, Vruchten 1637 in the British Museum, which contains numerous examples of species studied from life by various hands, also includes some oil paintings. One sheet by a sixteenth-century northern artist depicts a dog’s head in oil on linen canvas, a rather interesting medium.3 6 A 3 3 See F.

Apparently, once the artist captured the precise appearance of the animal, he found it unnecessary to replicate its coloring when studying its behavior. Thus, the function of the drawing dictated the technique. Brueghel employed such strategies accordingly in his oil sketches. It is useful to compare Brueghel's technique to that of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), who produced two oil sketches on panel depicting men of foreign races studied from life. Like Brueghel’s sketches, the tronies or heads are portrayed from different angles and with varied expressions. In his Four Studies o f the Head o f an African of ca. 1617, Rubens observes the same sitter from different angles and distances, and with various expressions (Fig. 23). It is interesting that he used the same medium as Brueghel for these life studies.3 7 They are unusual in Rubens’s oeuvre, in which oil sketches usually function as preparatory compositional designs. The preparatory sketches also tend not to be as finished as these head studies, which have a different purpose as records of exotic men. Similarly, Rubens applied color to 3 7 Rubens’s other oil sketch of Two Studies o f a Levantine is in a private collection. Haverkamp- Begemann claimed that Rubens was inspired by Brueghel to paint his oil sketches ad vivum, since a Sketch o f Africans attributed to Rubens in the Graf Harrach’sche Gem&ldegalerie in Vienna includes animal feet by a hand that resembles Brueghel’s style. However this connection seems quite unlikely. See E. Haverkamp-Begemann, “Purpose and Style: Oil Sketches of Rubens, Jan Brueghel, Rembrandt,” in Stii und Uberlieferung in der Kunst des Abendlandes.

The first artist to produce independent oil panel paintings of animals around 1560-1566 was the German artist Ludger tom Ring the Younger (1522-1584). Like Brueghel, he juxtaposed a variety of species, including a civet cat, bat, porcupine, rabbit, and dog, on a single panel (Fig. 24).3 9 However, their neat and finished quality suggests that they had a didactic function in the workshop or more likely that they were objects of curiosity painted for specific collectors. The fact that some of the creatures imitate artistic models accounts for the images’ high level of precision, which would be more difficult to achieve in a life study. A further comparison to the oil sketches of animals by Brueghel’s contemporary Roelandt Savery (1576-1639) also demonstrates how Brueghel’s works functioned more as preparatory drawings than as finished paintings. Savery, a specialist in animal painting and court painter to Rudolf n, produced quite a few studies of species in oil on panel.4 0 They include the Parrot, Frog and Crab of ca. 1605 (Fig. 25); Cow in a Landscape (1604, private collection, Germany); two signed 3 8 See A.

Lorenz, ed., Die Maler tom Ring, exh. cat (Milnsten Westf&lisches Landesmuseum fhr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte Monster, 1996), 422-425. He also painted three peacocks on panel. 4 0 His drawings of animals include a bison, elephant, camel, dodo, monkey, dog, oxen, stags, horses, eagles, sheep, and lions. See J. Spicer, The Drawings o f Roelandt Savery (Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1979). Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 25 paintings of roosters (ca. 1612, Boymans van-Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam); Two Dogs in a Landscape dated 1612 (unknown location); and a crowned crane with other birds among reeds (unknown location). Most of them depict common species that Savery could have easily observed from nature, including the more exotic crane that appears in Rudolfs Museum. Unlike Brueghel’s oil sketches, these paintings place the animals and birds in landscapes and have a rather finished quality. Savery also tended to focus more on a single species, thereby providing it with a monumental and portrait-like appearance. His sketch of a Chained Ape and Tree Trunk in oil on paper, a unique technique for Savery, displays more similarities to Brueghel’s sketches (Fig. 26).4 1 Like the monkey in Brueghel’s Vienna panel, Savery’s is shown seated in full view together with a study of its head in profile. Such comparisons reveal how Brueghel's oil sketches often make more sense when viewed in the context of drawings than paintings. A survey of drawings by Brueghel’s Netherlandish contemporaries who specialized in animal paintings allows one to understand his oil sketches in terms of the drawing techniques and approaches consistently used for nature studies. Such a discussion will further distinguish his sketches from finished compositional oil easel paintings. In addition to Savery’s oil sketches, his drawings of animals also have similar characteristics to Brueghel’s studies. Savery’s Eight Studies o f Stags is quite unique in its approach to articulating their different poses (Fig. 27). He added a 4 1 Spicer dates the sketch to around 1603-1606, because of its inclusion in Savery’s paintings of Orpheus in Vienna and Darmstadt. Spicer, Savery, S36.

This shortcut provides the animals with a dynamic and continuous sense of movement. In his lively depiction of a Leaping Bull, signed and dated 1618 in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Savery focused on the animal’s actions in a more straightforward manner and placed it within a landscape.4 2 His signature and date on animal drawings such as this one imply that they were conceived as finished independent works. Perhaps collectors appreciated the immediate quality and ad vivum status of such drawings. Interestingly, on the verso of two naer het leven figure drawings in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Savery drew studies of a deer and a bison. Like the figures on the recto, the animals are most likely also drawn from life, since he could have observed them in Rudolf II’s animal park. Many of these drawings are not in color, which is not surprising given the swiftness of hand required to sketch a live animal. Color could be added later as in his large Stag’ s Head in blue, red and yellow chalks (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin). Jacques de Gheyn Q (1565-1629) also produced numerous studies of animals, birds, and reptiles in various poses and often in color.4 3 He made rather precise colored renderings of either dead or sick species from different perspectives, such as adopts the traditional iconography of its captive condition established by Pieter Bruegel in his painting of Two Chained Monkeys in Berlin (See fig. 58). * 2 See ibid., 570. 4 3 For comprehensive studies of De Gheyn’s work, see I. Q. van Regteren Altena, Jacques de Gheyn: An Introduction to the Study o f his Drawings (Amsterdam: Swets and Zeitlinger, 1935); and I.

Van Mander wrote in his Schilder-Boeck that De Gheyn initially turned his attention to nature studies in order to experiment with colors 4 5 De Gheyn’s album of 22 watercolor and tempera drawings (1600-1604), purchased by Rudolf Q in 1604, depicts flowers that he observed in the Leiden University Botanic Garden and a crab, mouse, and insects (Fondation Custodia, Paris).4 6 His Four Studies o f a Horse's Head in pen and ink represents the animal from different angles in a clustered configuration (Fig. 28). One almost has the sense that the various sketches grew out of one another organically, much in the same way that Brueghel’s studies of cats and donkeys in Vienna are closely interconnected and often overlapping in form.4 7 In the “attentive eye.” See S. Alpers, The Art o f Describing (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), 85-89. 4 4 For an illustration, see Boon, Netherlandish Drawings o f the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, cat. nos. 239-240. 4 5 Van Mander, Schilder-Boeck, fo l. 294v. 4 6 His precise renderings of species provided models for later works, such as the Munich Prayerbook by an unknown illuminator and apparently commissioned by Rudolf Q around 1607. They demonstrate the influence of the scientific atmosphere of Leiden, where he lived from 1595 to about 1602. See F. Hopper, “Jacques de Gheyn II and Rudolf II’s Collection of Nature Drawings,” in E. Fuctkovd et al., Prag um 1600: Beitrdge zur Kunst und Kultur am Hofe Rudolfs 1 1 (Freren: Luca, 1988), 124-131; and Boon, The Netherlandish and German Drawings o f the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries o f the Frits Lugt Collection (Paris: Institut Nlerlandais, 1992), no. 80. 4 7 Similarly, the clustered formation of rotating views of a cow in Anthony van Dyck’s Study o f Cows in Chatsworth produces a remarkable sense of fluid motion. Popham made the interesting suggestion that the Study o f Cows in the British Museum, a copy afrer Van Dyck’s original at Chatsworth, might be by Brueghel. It has traditionally been attributed to a member o f Rubens’s studio. Since Jan Brueghel the Younger set up a workshop with Van Dyck around 1616, my guess is that he would have been more likely to copy the drawing than his established father, who was busy at the time painting the Allegories o f the Five Senses with Rubens.

As we have seen in other animal drawings, the donkey’s entire body is represented together with two sketches of its head. De Gheyn took his observational skills further in a study of a lion in eight poses, mainly shown lying down or seated, and of its head from three angles (Fondation Custodia, Paris).4 9 These examples of animal studies by Brueghel's contemporaries demonstrate the extent to which movement, multiple views, and often color were considered essential elements in the description of an animal from life. Like these artists, Albrecht DUrer (1471-1528), one of the first specialists in nature studies, selectively applied the different descriptive elements of movement and color to his animal drawings depending on their purposes. His Studies o f Hares in pen and black ink shows them in profile and from the rear, twice in their entirety, and twice with their heads only (Fig. 29).5 0 His main concern here was to capture the movements of the animal. On the other hand, his precise watercolors of species cat. (London: British Museum, 1977), 152-153; and C. Brown and H. Vlieghe, Van Dyck, exh. cat.

His pen and black ink drawing includes a rather careful rendering of the goat’s body as well as three sketches of its head probably after life (British Museum, London).

Artists, such as Hans Hoffmann and Joris Hoefnagel, and even naturalists, such as Conrad Gesner, emulated his model, which was considered to be the epitome of naturalism. For this reason, many of the animal studies that followed imitated not nature itself but rather Diireresque images that objectively conveyed the appearance of the real specimen. On a more practical level, painters also turned to such sources, because of the difficulty involved in accessing and capturing the precise appearance of a live animal in a drawing. What are some of the similarities between these artists’ studies from life? The representation of movement is a key characteristic of the animal drawings. Aristotle felt that one could not properly define animals without an understanding of their movement, ‘Tor an animal is something perceptible and it is not possible to define it without reference to movement....”5 1 In Van Mander’s chapter on animals in Den Grondt der Edel vrij Schilder-const (The Foundation of the Noble Free Art of Painting), he discusses the necessity to study an animal’s behavior: “[There is] nothing better to refer to than nature itself in order not to err.... Pay attention to how each animal lies, runs, stands and turns about.”5 2 In his discussion of the horse, he writes that, “We must also study the horse’s attitude, not as in a human figure: that designs for his workshop. See illustration in J. Rowlands, Drawings by German Artists (London: British Museum Press, 1993). 5 1 Aristotle, vm, Metaphysica, quoted by J. Muller, “Rubens’s Theory and Practice of the Imitation of Art,” The Art Bulletin 64, no. 2 (June 1982): 230. 5 2 K. van Mander, Den Grondt der edel vry schilderconst (1608), ed. H.

Many of the nature studies discussed above were painted in watercolor, gouache, or oil, following Durer’s influential example. Artists sometimes chose the medium of oil on panel for the sketches, which involved more expensive materials than a mere drawing on paper. Those who did not include color in their drawings often added color notations instead. Without color, the depiction of an animal's precise appearance remains incomplete. Surely the select few who had permission to view the books of animal watercolors in Rudolf A's collection, such as the one by De Gheyn, were as astounded by the vivid pigments as by the incredible variety of species. Van Mander expresses the impression that the colors of animals have on the viewer: “The power of colors is apparent in many manners in birds and beasts, which gives them a noble, remarkable ornament....”5 6 Theorists and naturalists praised the virtues of color in the imitation of nature. Van Mander, in his chapter on animals in Den Grondt der Edel vrij Schilder-const, 5 3 Ibid., 9: 17. Unless noted to the contrary, English translations are by Honig et al. 5 4 Van Mander wrote of Masaccio: “The art of painting well, insofar as she achieves her greatest strength consists entirely in the representation of natural and lively visible things.” K. van Mander, Het Schilder-Boeck, reprint of the 1604 edition, P. van Wesbusch, Haarlem (Utrecht: Davaco, 1969), fo l. 102r; as translated by Hendrix, Hoefiiagel, 75. 5 5 In Abraham de Bruyn’s animal engravings, the various species are depicted in lively poses.

Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 31 devotes much attention to the importance of color in the representation of an animal, writing, “Make sure that your handling of the paint is always characteristic,” and “color then animals after nature.”5 7 He describes how animals provide the artist with a wide range of colors to discover: That nature has given us such a variety of scales is to be well detected in all things, which gives the eyes a pleasurable enjoyment~for example, the well-spoken Parrot, other birds, shellfish, and many more created things, show how all colors accompany each other. Thus nature, who teaches us everything, is nurse and mother of the art of painting (11:9). Drawing alone was not sufficient for Van Mander, “for through colors the dead lines of drawing begin to move to live and they are truly resuscitated” (12: 1). He believed that the essence of an object could not be understood without the knowledge of its colors. “Color is in itself the external visibility of such an object of which it is an attribute, and also of this object’s substance” (13: 5). Van Mander summarizes his stance on the subject by referring to the ultimate creator: “ ...in short, color makes everything appear visible that is in the world created by God” (13: 9). Brueghel’s religious contextualization of a vivid array of animals in his paradise landscapes underscores this view. The importance of the paint medium as a vehicle of accurate representation was also emphasized by the natural historian Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605), who wrote: There is nothing on earth that seems to give more pleasure and utility to man than painting, and above all paintings of natural things: 5 6 Van Mander, Den Grondt, 13: 13 and 9:35. 5 7 Ibid., 9:47.

He wrote that everything we know in the world, we know through color.5 9 He was aware of the limitations of his printed encyclopedias, since the artist’s original models for these illustrations were in watercolor; he therefore had color applied to the copies destined for important people.6 0 Brueghel’s patron Cardinal Federico Borromeo devoted a large section of his Tre Libri delli Laudi Divine to color. He deals with questions regarding its nature and definition and discusses its infinite variety and mutations.6 1 For him, colors represent every aspect of the visible and natural world. He demonstrates the divine beauty of birds, animals, precious gems, and jewels using chromatic terms. Borromeo writes that in the representation of colors, one ultimately recognizes the art of the sovereign painter God. In a sense, Brueghel’s paradise landscapes celebrate not only the impressive scope of God’s creation, but also its vivid and kaleidoscopic appearance. Furthermore, the spectrum of colors in these paintings underscores and 5 8 “Non trovo al mondo cosa che mi paia che dia piu vaghezza all’huomo, et utility che la pittura massime delle cose naturali: perchg per quei individui da un ecc.te pittore depinti veniamo in cognitione delle spetie straniere quantunque in lontani paesi nate.” A Is.

In his description of Brueghel’s flower still life, Borromeo writes: Then when winter encumbers and restricts everything with ice, I have enjoyed from sight~and even imagined odor, if not real-artificial flowers...expressed in painting...and in these flowers I have wanted to see the variety of color, not fleeting, as some of the flowers that are found [in nature], but stable and very endurable.6 2 In Borromeo’s eyes, the colors of the flowers in Brueghel’s painting, which do not fade, substitute and surpass their real counterparts. Similarly, Brueghel’s oil sketches of animals not only replicate the experience of seeing a species first-hand, but also replace such a momentary encounter. They were therefore most likely painted on panel for the sake of preservation. The combination of the technique (oil on panel and color), naturalistic approach (rotating views and depiction of behavioral patterns), and particular subject matter (life studies of animals) produced a highly valued artifact. Within a culture that treasured natural and man-made specimens, such sketches done ad vivum would have been valued as curiosities with documentary status, meriting preservation on panel.6 3 Similarly, the Lombard studies of animals, which were prized possessions of 6 1 A. Martini, “/ Tre Libri delle Laudi D ivine’ ' di Federico Borromeo: Ricerca storico-stilistica (Padua: Antenore, 1975), 264-268. Borromeo’s book was published posthumously in 1632. 6 2 F.

The first part of the inscription refers to easel painting: “Nobile si quid humus, si quid tenet Amphritite / Spectatu dignum si quid Olympus habet / Aetnula naturae dextra pictura potenti / Semper victuras transtulit in tabulas.” (When the earth is home to something noble, when the sea, when the heavens contain something worthy of sight, then skilled Painting, competing with mighty Nature, has transferred it to wooden panels, which will live on forever.)

When making assumptions about the physical reality of Brueghel’s representations of animals, the views and approaches presented above help us to understand the perception of naturalism in art. The elements of color, movement, multiple views, and detail do not necessarily signify that a drawing accurately depicts a live species. These illusionistic devices employed by Brueghel can only provide a resemblance to the real specimen. However, the effect on the viewer does play an important role. Evidently, Brueghel’s precise descriptions of animals and flowers achieved their desired effect on collectors, such as Cardinal Borromeo who described their ability to replace the actual specimens. His skillful replication of the animals’ true physical and behavioral qualities enhances the credibility of their representation. Although the level of resemblance depends on the mode and quality of the image, such associations involve more than an aesthetic judgment, but also an Castle Administration, and London and New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997), 179-180.

Brueghel’s and other artists’ consistent approach to nature studies displays a systematic method based on careful observation and various degrees of description. The Imitation of Art: Brueghel and Rubens How does one reconcile Brueghel’s animal studies done from life with his selective imitation of his friend and frequent collaborator, Peter Paul Rubens?6 6 His copies of Rubens’s horse, lion and leopard motifs in the Entry o f the Animals into Noah’ s Ark represent rare instances of Brueghel’s imitation of an artistic source.6 7 What motivated Brueghel’s decision to imitate a painting rather than to study a species from life? I shall demonstrate how these citations correspond to the specific functions of the animals in particular contexts. It shall become evident that Brueghel and his contemporaries shared a perception of naturalism that did not depend exclusively on the experiential approach, but rather coincided with the codes and expectations of their culture. Not only did Brueghel imitate some of Rubens’s animals, but Rubens also based his lions and horse on Italian Renaissance sculptures, which had antique sculptures as their models. This sequence of replications reveals the evolution of an 6 5 Leonardo da Vinci, quoted in Ames-Lewis, Drawing in the Italian Renaissance Workshop, 101. 6 6 In addition to their collaborations on paintings, Brueghel’s close personal and professional relationship with his fellow court painter Rubens is revealed in Rubens’s portait of Brueghel and his family (ca. 1612-1613, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London), painted about the same time as the Entry o f the Animals into N oah’ s Ark. 6 7 The only other species that Brueghel imitates in his paradise landscapes is Joris Hoefhagel’s eagle from the Four Elements; see my discussion in Chapter Four.

According to Whitney Davis, an image cannot be understood on its own, because its meaning lies in its replication, which he defines as a “sequential production of similar material morphologies...that are substitutable for one another in specific social contexts of use.”6 8 Does Davis’s replication theory allow one to gain a better understanding of Brueghel’s copies after Rubens’s images of animals, which were perceived as naturalistic depictions by his contemporaries? And how does the history of these images help explain the criteria artists used to tackle the representation of certain animals? By unraveling the artistic lineage of the horse, lions, and leopards, we shall gain more insight into the precise nature of Brueghel’s approach. For his Entry o f the Animals into Noah’ s Ark, Brueghel imitated the horse in Rubens’s equestrian portraits, most notably the Equestrian Portrait o f the Archduke Albert and the Riding School, both of which are now lost and known only through copies and photographs (Figs. 31, 32,33).6 9 The frontal view of the horse was clearly inspired by Rubens, who popularized this type of authoritative representation. Brueghel referred specifically to the white horse on the left side of the Riding School, which can be identified as a white Spanish/Arabian stallion, the horse of choice in 6 8 W.

Since this portrait appears in the center foreground of the Allegory o f Sight of ca. 1617, painted with Rubens, Brueghel was obviously familiar with it (See fig. 100). Brueghel included thi"
