People lost their minds because it was 80% of the price of a regular iPod but had only 20% of the storage. But it was small! Turned out Apple knew that the vast majority of iPod owners used about 1GB, enough for a few hundred songs, so didn’t care about the “lack” of storage.\n\nI bet they believe the same about the Mac Mini—that most people will plug one thing in: a monitor. Their keyboard and mouse will be wireless and they’ll be happy.\n\nReactions: _Mitchan1999\n\nCapeto\n\nmacrumors 6502\n\nJul 9, 2015\n\n491\n\n1,116\n\nAug 8, 2024\n\n#352\n\nIf true, this might be the first Mac I purchase on its release day.\n\nReactions: Jumpthesnark\n\nUK-MacAddict\n\nmacrumors 65816\n\nMay 11, 2010\n\n1,034\n\n1,262\n\nAug 8, 2024\n\n#353\n\nCan‘t the people who have been asking for a 27’ iMac just buy this thing with a paired studio display?
