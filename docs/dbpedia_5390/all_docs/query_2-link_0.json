        "text": "Broadcast syndication arm of CBS Entertainment Group\n\nCBS Media Ventures, Inc. (formerly CBS Paramount Domestic Television and CBS Television Distribution) is the television broadcast syndication arm of CBS Studios, a division of the CBS Entertainment Group, in turn a division of Paramount Global,[1] founded on 2006 by CBS Corporation from a merger of CBS Paramount Domestic Television and King World Productions.\n\nOn launch, the division was led by King World CEO Roger King, who had his own production company merged into the division, until his death in 2007. It was formerly the main distribution arm of Paramount Media Networks (now handled by Paramount Global Content Distribution), the CBS and The CW television networks, which are currently handled by former parent company CBS Studios. The division also consists of CBS's home entertainment arm, CBS Home Entertainment.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division has distribution rights to acquired television series, mini-series and made-for-television films from the following libraries:\n\nParamount Global's flagship TV network, CBS, handles the television broadcasting rights to much of its own archived theatrical films and those of sister film studio, Paramount Pictures.\n\nAs CBS Television Distribution, the division formerly distributed the films from the libraries from Republic Pictures and Carolco Pictures. Until 2021, it was responsible for international television distribution rights to a few episodic serial programs which aired on HBO by Rysher Entertainment through its Paramount Global Content Licensing division; it has since being handled by Paramount Global Distribution Group (both of these are currently known as Paramount Global Content Distribution). It also acted as an advertising sales representative for Debmar-Mercury, which is now owned by Lionsgate.[2]\n\nThis is the sixth distribution name for CBS: CBS Television Film Sales (1952–1958) was the first,[3] CBS Films, Inc. (1958–1968) was the second,[4] CBS Enterprises (1968–1970) was the third,[5] Eyemark Entertainment (1995–1999) was the fourth and CBS Paramount Domestic Television (2006–2007) was the fifth. The first 3 CBS distribution monikers were also used for a separate media company-turned-conglomerate connected to CBS which evolved to what is now historically known as the first/original incarnation of Viacom Inc..\n\nThe current moniker for the overseas distribution arm CBS Media Ventures since 2009 is CBS Studios International, now Paramount Global Content Distribution.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAs CBS Paramount Domestic Television\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Paramount Domestic Television rebranded to CBS Paramount Domestic Television as an interim syndication arm.\n\nAs CBS Television Distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nThe previous distribution arm of CBS, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, merged with King World Productions to form CBS Television Distribution on September 26, 2006.[6] On January 16, 2007, the studio launched a separate home video division, CBS Home Entertainment, for release of in-house-made shows on home video which would be distributed through the second incarnation of Viacom via Paramount Home Entertainment (which continues till date).[7]\n\nOn February 25, 2007, CBS Television Distribution sold shows produced by Showtime to its parent subsidiary for self-syndication and broadcast.[8] Later that year on August 18, CBS Television Distribution acquired a 50% stake in online talent search service Big Shot from Madison Road Entertainment and Maverick Television.[9] On November 20, 2007, CBS Television Distribution began carrying first-run episodes of Everybody Hates Chris on its-owned stations and those of Fox in 2009,[10] with CBS signing a deal with Nickelodeon on March 2, 2008 to bring reruns of Everybody Hates Chris to air for cable broadcast on its Nick at Nite channel.[11]\n\nOn October 6, 2012, John Nogawski left his role as president of CBS Television Distribution[12] with programming president Aaron Meyerson following in his footsteps a week later.[13] On October 22, 2013, former executive of Telepictures Productions, Hilary Estey McLoughlin, joined CBS Television Distribution as head of creative affairs.[14] On March 2, 2015, CBS Television Distribution renewed Judge Judy through to the end of the 2019–20 television season.[15]\n\nWith a growing international syndication business, CBS sought to split the group.
