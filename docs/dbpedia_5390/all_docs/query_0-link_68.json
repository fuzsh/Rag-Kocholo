        "text": "For nearly four decades, the Disney Legends Awards program has honored gifted animators, Imagineers, songwriters, actors, business leaders, and more for the significant impact they’ve had on the Disney legacy. This year, we’ll be honoring the 2024 class of Disney Legends during D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event on Sunday, August 11, at 5 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, this ceremony will celebrate the new class and look back at their many contributions to Disney magic.\n\nThe Disney Legends program, a treasured tradition of The Walt Disney Company, began with inaugural inductee Fred MacMurray (The Shaggy Dog, The Absent-Minded Professor, The Happiest Millionaire) in 1987. The awards ceremony is just one of the many spectacular events fans can enjoy during the three-day D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event.\n\nColleen Atwood\n\nFor Colleen Atwood, designing costumes for movies both fantastical and fabulous is like creating her own Wonderland. This prolific costume designer has been nominated for an Academy Award® a dozen times and has won four Oscars, including for her visually evocative work in Alice in Wonderland (2010).\n\nBorn in Ellensburgh, Washington, Colleen briefly studied painting at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. Working in high fashion retail at designer boutiques, her strong sense of visual style enabled her start as a fashion advisor. Through that world, Colleen was offered an unexpected opportunity to be a production assistant in the art department on Ragtime (1981). In New York, she was fortunate enough to align with many filmmakers such as Jonathan Demme, Michael Apted, and Michael Mann.\n\nColleen was then introduced to filmmaker Tim Burton—and soon would be Burton’s “go to” costume designer. Their first film together, Edward Scissorhands, was the first of 12 Burton movies she designed costumes for, including Disney’s live-action reimagining of Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dumbo (2019). The upcoming Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024) will mark the creative duo’s 13th collaboration.\n\nFor the over 50 films and TV series she’s costumed, many of them center on visually stunning imaginary environments that call for a lot of world-building. It’s Colleen’s ability to cross and blend genres in her approach to character costuming that has enabled her work in such fantastic films as Planet of the Apes (2001), Into the Woods (2014), Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016), Lady and the Tramp (2019), and The Little Mermaid (2023).\n\nAngela Bassett\n\nIt takes a strong woman to portray a strong female character, and Angela Bassett fits the bill. From her breakout role as single mother Reva Devereaux in John Singleton’s Boyz n the Hood (1991), to her portrayal of fierce Queen Ramonda of Wakanda in Marvel’s Black Panther films, Angela’s unmistakable voice, signature delivery, and grand presence command immediate attention.\n\nBorn in New York City, Angela lived in North Carolina until the age of four, when her family moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. The first Black student attending Boca Ciega High School to be admitted to the National Honors Society, Angela went on to Yale, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in African American Studies in 1980 and a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama in 1983. In 1988, she moved to Los Angeles.\n\nAngela has portrayed many real-life characters, including Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, but it was her powerful portrayal of Tina Turner in Touchstone’s What’s Love Got to Do with It (1993) that earned her numerous accolades, including an Academy Award® nomination and a Golden Globe® for Best Actress, making her the first Black performer to win this category. She received two Emmy nominations for outstanding narrator for National Geographic’s The Flood (2018) and the Disney+ docuseries The Imagineering Story (2019), and was nominated for her second Academy Award, this time in the Best Supporting Actress category, for the role of Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). She is also the star and executive producer of the hit ABC drama 9-1-1; voiced Dorothea Williams in Disney and Pixar’s Oscar-winning animated feature Soul (2020); and received an Honorary Academy Award in 2024.\n\nMartha Blanding\n\nMartha Blanding helped put the “happy” in The Happiest Place on Earth. As the first-ever full-time Black Tour Guide, Martha personified the philosophy of creating happiness for others while embodying the principles of hospitality and courtesy Walt Disney sought to establish for Disneyland cast members.\n\nA proud native of South Central Los Angeles, Martha was studying to become a teacher when she decided to take a chance working at Disneyland in 1971. Hired as a Tour Guide, she quickly attained full-time status and, within a year, climbed the ladder to become a VIP Hostess—touring such notables as Diana Ross, Elton John (who would later become a Disney Legend), Olivia Newton-John, Cary Grant, and Cher, plus domestic and international government officials, including a delegation from the USSR.\n\nMartha later became the first-ever Black female in management at Disneyland (and one of the first Black management members at The Walt Disney Company), as an expert merchandise, candy, and film buyer for nine years, and eventually as the senior manager of Disneyland Resort Merchandise Special Events. In this role, she worked with world-renowned artisans, celebrities, and Disney Legends. She also became a pioneering producer of the Official Disneyana Convention, a forerunner of today’s D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event.\n\nA co-founder of PULSE, an employee resource group for Black cast members, Martha routinely served as a trusted mentor to fellow employees. Adding to her many “firsts” during her groundbreaking career before retiring in 2022, Martha also became the first Black employee to commemorate 50 years with The Walt Disney Company—and now she becomes the first Black Disney Parks employee designated a Disney Legend.\n\nJames L. Brooks\n\nAcclaimed for character-driven, writer-centric projects that deftly combine comedy and poignancy—such as 20th Century’s Broadcast News (1987)—James L. Brooks is a TV and film icon responsible for some of the most beloved entertainment projects of all time. Jim made one of the most impressive directorial debuts in film history with Terms of Endearment (1983), for which the multi-hyphenate took home three Oscars® for writing, producing, and directing.\n\nGrowing up in New Jersey, Jim’s career trajectory kicked-off as a writer for CBS News in New York. When he moved to Los Angeles in 1965, a chance meeting with established writer Allan Burns led to his writing for television comedies—and before long, he created the groundbreaking ABC series Room 222 in 1969 and Taxi in 1978.\n\nIn 1986, Jim founded his production company, Gracie Films, where he and his team are trailblazers in the world of television. At Jim’s invitation, Matt Groening created animated interstitials for the company’s The Tracey Ullman Show featuring a dysfunctional family that led to a full-fledged animated series—the first since the 1960s: The Simpsons, in 1989. The longest-running primetime scripted show in television history, The Simpsons quickly exploded into a cultural phenomenon.\n\nCurrently in its 35th season, The Simpsons has won 37 Emmy® Awards. Jim also co-produced and co-wrote The Simpsons Movie in 2007. He continues to serve as executive producer of the misadventures of the animated citizens of Springfield, and maintains that the series has not outlived its popularity—especially now with it streaming on Disney+. He’s currently working on his next feature film for 20th Century Studios, Ella McCay.\n\nJames Cameron\n\nJames Cameron is an acclaimed filmmaker, ocean explorer, and environmental advocate. As director, writer, and producer, he’s responsible for some of the world’s most memorable films—including The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Titanic (1997), Avatar (2009), and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022), the latter three being among the four highest-grossing films of all time. Titanic alone won 11 Oscars®, including James’ for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Editing. He is currently in post-production on Avatar 3, and in pre-production on Avatar 4 and 5.\n\nTeaming up with Walt Disney Imagineering in 2011, he helped to steer the creation of an Avatar-inspired area of Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. The result, Pandora – The World of Avatar, is an area which immerses guests in an interactive environment that brings the world of the film series to life, and features the popular attractions Avatar Flight of Passage and Na’vi River Journey.\n\nUnder his Earthship Productions banner, James has produced 12 documentaries, including six about Titanic, as well as three other deep ocean exploration films—most in partnership with National Geographic. He executive produces National Geographic’s Secrets series, including the Emmy® Award-winning Secrets of the Whales and Emmy-nominated Secrets of the Elephants, with Octopus launching on Earth Day 2024. He also executive produced the OceanXplorers series, due in fall 2024 from National Geographic.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, California, to Hollywood power couple Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Jamie Lee Curtis excelled as a performer early on—winning people over with her exuberant personality. Originally planning to major in law enforcement, an acting manager suggested Jamie Lee try auditioning. To her surprise, she was signed to a contract at Universal, one of the last performers to be so engaged. She was later cast as iconic “Scream Queen” Laurie Strode in John Carpenter’s thrilling classic Halloween (1978), establishing her trajectory as a bona fide movie star.\n\nThe Oscar® winner has demonstrated her versatility with a variety of captivating roles over her career, including suburban housewife-turned-international-spy Helen Tasker in True Lies (1994), and no-nonsense mom Tess Coleman in Disney’s remake of the classic body-swap comedy Freaky Friday (2003). In 2023, Jamie Lee returned to both Disney and the macabre genre to portray the legendary Madame Leota in Haunted Mansion, inspired by the classic Disneyland theme park attraction. The author of 13 best-selling books, all exploring core childhood issues, she is also the founder and CEO of My Hand In Yours™—a charitable organization that offers comfort and celebratory gifts where 100% of every sale is donated directly to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nFor her many performances, Jamie Lee has received a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globes®, and nominations for a Primetime Emmy® and a Grammy®. Most recently, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022).\n\nSteve Ditko\n\nOriginally hailing from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Steve Ditko’s love for comics began at a young age. After serving in the U.S. Army, where he drew comics for the Army newsletter, one of his idols, Batman artist Jerry Robinson, became his mentor. By the early 1950s, Steve’s first work appeared in print, and shortly thereafter he made his way to Atlas Comics—the precursor of Marvel Comics.\n\nThe artist would quickly leave his mark, leading Stan Lee to rechristen Amazing Adventures as Amazing Adult Fantasy (later Amazing Fantasy) to showcase Steve’s talents. In 1962, that collaboration led to one of the most popular comic book characters of all time. The introduction of Spider-Man in Amazing Fantasy #15 stands as one of the landmarks of both Steve’s career and Marvel history.\n\nSteve went on to co-create most of Spider-Man’s now-infamous rogues’ gallery and re-envisioned many of Marvel’s iconic characters to what we know today. He redesigned Iron Man’s armor into the popular red-and-gold design, and in the Hulk comics, he codified Bruce Banner’s transformations to be a function of his anger. It is perhaps with Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, that Steve truly expressed his visionary impulses—the early stories in Strange Tales could only have come from the mind of Steve Ditko. He left Marvel to pursue other work in 1966 but returned in 1979. In the 1990s, Steve helped to co-create all-new characters, including Speedball and Squirrel Girl.\n\nOne of the greatest artist-writer talents in comic book history, Steve’s imagination and creative vision changed the comics industry and super hero storytelling forever.\n\nMark Henn\n\nMark Henn joined Walt Disney Animation Studios in 1980, where he became an assistant animator on The Fox and the Hound (1981). His first major assignment was animating Disney’s most beloved character, Mickey Mouse, in Mickey’s Christmas Carol (1983)—Mickey’s first big-screen appearance in 30 years.\n\nMark would go on to serve as the supervising animator for five female leads, more than any one artist in the history of the studio: Ariel (supervised with fellow Disney Legend Glen Keane), Belle (supervised with James Baxter), Jasmine, Mulan, and Tiana. He also animated Simba from The Lion King (1994), the title character in Pocahontas (1995), and Giselle from Enchanted (2007). Most recently, Mark has helped a whole new generation of Disney animators bring “the illusion of life” to character animation in CG features such as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). He was lead 2D animator on Big Hero 6 (2014) and Frozen (2013), and served as a 2D animator for “Mini Maui” in Moana (2016). In 2000, Mark brought his vast animation experience to directing with the acclaimed short, John Henry.\n\nIn 2013, he received the prestigious Winsor McCay Award for lifetime achievement, ASIFA’s highest award in animation. And in 2018, befitting his longtime association with Mickey Mouse, Mark was commissioned to paint Mickey’s official portrait for the character’s 90th anniversary. From Mickey and a little mermaid to Mini Maui, the enchantment of Disney animation is personal for this animator.\n\nFrank Oz\n\nCreator. Director. Producer. Performer. Writer. Actor. Icon. Superlatives all that describe the one and only Frank Oz.\n\nAs a respected director, Frank has helmed more than a dozen films—including co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Jim Henson, The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), Touchstone Pictures’ What About Bob? (1991), In & Out (1997), Bowfinger(1999), The Score (2001), Death at a Funeral (2007), Muppet Guys Talking (2017), and others, as well as the 2021 Hulu presentation of the long-running Off-Broadway hit he also directed, Derek DelGaudio’s In & Of Itself.\n\nA four-time Emmy® winner, Frank is the recipient of The Art Director’s Guild Contribution to Cinematic Imagery Award, The Comedy Awards’ Creative Achievement Award, The Saturn Lifetime Achievement Award, two George Foster Peabody Awards, three Gold Records, two Platinum Records, and a host of other accolades and honors.\n\nHe originated and performed the characters of Grover, Bert, and Cookie Monster for Sesame Street, along with Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Sam Eagle, and Animal for The Muppet Show, performing in hundreds of television shows and specials with The Muppets—including the memorable Muppet*Vision 3D for Disney Parks.\n\nFrank also originated and performed the character of Yoda for George Lucas’ Star Wars galaxy, first in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and followed by Return of the Jedi (1983), The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), Revenge of the Sith (2005), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\n\nHe’s also acted in several live-action movies, from The Blues Brothers (1980) to Knives Out (2019), and has voiced characters in Disney and Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. (2001), Inside Out (2015), and Inside Out 2 (2024).\n\nKelly Ripa\n\nKelly Ripa is one of the most powerful voices in media, with a diverse body of work both on and off camera. With a career at ABC spanning over 30 years, Kelly has welcomed viewers with her sharp wit every morning as co-host and executive producer of the nationally syndicated show Live.\n\nBeginning her career in entertainment as an actress, Kelly has starred in numerous celebrated television series—appearing on such shows as the soap opera All My Children and the sitcom Hope & Faith.\n\nKelly and her husband Mark Consuelos ventured into the development side of entertainment when they began their production company, Milojo Productions. Milojo produces content across multiple platforms, producing the Emmy®-nominated documentary The Streak for ESPN and the critically acclaimed documentary Off The Rez for TLC.\n\nShe’s earned numerous accolades over the years, including multiple Daytime Emmy® Awards, the prestigious Excellence in Media Award from GLAAD and Glamour’s Woman of the Year Award. She was also recognized by The Hollywood Reporter as part of the Women in Entertainment Power 100 list, as well as the publication’s 35 Most Powerful People in Media.\n\nIn September 2022, Kelly added New York Times best-selling author to her resume, when her collection Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories was published. Additionally, she recently launched the second season of her own podcast titled Let’s Talk Off Camera with Kelly Ripa. She lives in New York City with Mark Consuelos, and together the couple have three children.\n\nJoe Rohde\n\nRetiring in 2021 as a portfolio creative executive with 40 years at Walt Disney Imagineering, Joe Rohde was the overall creative executive and supervising designer for Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park, including later expansions such as Expedition Everest – Legend of the Forbidden Mountain and Pandora – The World of Avatar. Joe’s other notable projects include The Adventurers Club (formerly a part of Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World); Aulani, A Disney Resort & Spa in Ko Olina, Hawaiʻi; and Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! at Disney’s California Adventure Park.\n\nJoe grew up in Honolulu and the San Fernando Valley, creating art and theater sets, acting in school productions, and exploring film backlots with his cameraman father. He attended Occidental College, graduated with a major in studio art, and went to work as teacher—where at 25, he was recruited by Walt Disney Imagineering. His first assignment was as a model builder for the Mexico Pavilion at EPCOT.\n\nJoe’s big Imagineering break came with the development of a certain animal-focused theme park for the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park would prove to be a celebration of animals; a passionate argument for the coexistence of conservation and communities; and a recognition of the essential role that ecosystems play in our existence. Joe was also instrumental in creating the Disney Conservation Fund, which has disbursed over $125 million in grants to projects worldwide. He is well known for his intensive focus on the philosophy of narrative placemaking and experiential storytelling.\n\nJoe now uses his art to raise funds for both international conservation and local community projects. In 2022 he received the Disney Conservation Fund’s first Conservation Legacy Award, and he’s appeared on numerous documentaries about Imagineering.\n\nJohn Williams\n\nThe unforgettable music of John Williams is the soundtrack of our lives.\n\nIn a career spanning more than six decades, this most prolific of movie composers has created the music for more than 100 films—including all nine Star Wars saga films and all five Indiana Jones films. Born and raised in New York, John moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1948. Venturing back to the East Coast to attend The Julliard School, he later returned to Los Angeles to commence his career.\n\nEarly on, Williams composed the music for more than 200 television films and numerous TV series including Lost in Space for 20th Century Fox. John’s artistic partnership with director Steven Spielberg, now in its 50th year, led to an introduction to fellow Disney Legend George Lucas and what became the biggest film phenomenon of its time, Star Wars (1977).\n\nJohn has received five Academy Awards® and 54 Oscar® nominations—most recently for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)—making him the Academy’s most-nominated living person and the second-most-nominated person in the history of the Oscars... a number second only to Walt Disney. He has also received seven British Academy Awards (BAFTA), 26 Grammys®, four Golden Globes®, and five Emmys®, as well as the National Medal of Arts, the Kennedy Center Honors, and an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II."
