        "text": "Just in time for its 50th anniversary, The Carol Burnett Show is set to soon be available for streaming.\n\nCBS Television Distribution has inked a deal to acquire digital multicast rights to the series’ entire 11-season run. That’s 276 hours worth of the celebrated CBS variety show, many of which have not seen the light of day since their original air date.\n\n“I’m thrilled to be back home at CBS, and I’m so happy that future generations will be able to see and enjoy the fun we had in those 11 wonderful years,” Burnett said.\n\nCBS has been very keen to stay in the Burnett business. A 2017 anniversary special aired on the broadcast network and fetched a formidable 17.2 million viewers.\n\n“Carol Burnett is one of the very finest comedic performers in the history of television,” said CTD president Paul Franklin. “Acquiring digital rights to her library allows us to not only ensure that the show’s legacy is protected, but that her genius is also shared with audiences for years to come.”"
