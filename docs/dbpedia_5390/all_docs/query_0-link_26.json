        "text": "This article is about the original incarnation of Viacom. For the current (2005-present) incarnation formerly known as Viacom, see Paramount Global. For other uses, see Viacom (disambiguation).\n\nBackground\n\nViacom Enterprises was the television distribution division of the CBS Television Network, formed in 1952 as CBS Television Film Sales, later renamed to CBS Films in 1958, CBS Enterprises, Inc. in 1968, then to Viacom in 1970. In 1971, it was spun-off to comply with FCC regulations prohibiting television networks from distributing their programs under their own names. Subsequently, Viacom formed \"Viacom Productions\" to produce first-run television series airing on the major television networks.\n\nThe company was popular during the 1970s and 1980s, originally distributing CBS-produced shows such as I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show. In later years, they've distributed shows from numerous other production companies, including MTM Enterprises, Filmways Television, Carsey/Werner, Lorimar Television, Rankin/Bass, and Hanna-Barbera (the latter mostly internationally). They also distributed several Four Star shows, and early Nelvana TV specials, as well as most movie releases from Romulus Films, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Tomorrow Entertainment, Regency Enterprises, New World Pictures (until 1984), Orion Pictures, New Line Cinema, EMI Films, Cannon Films, and the Terrytoons library, among others, until they formed their own syndication companies. In 1971, Viacom and its production division formed \"Viacom International, Inc.\" as their new parent company for distributing programs overseas.\n\nWithin a decade, Viacom was bought by cinema chain National Amusements, becoming part of the newly-reincorporated \"Viacom, Inc.\" On January 1, 1990, as part of a restructuring, Viacom Pictures was formed. On March 11, 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications, Inc. and Viacom Enterprises was folded into Paramount Domestic Television (later \"CBS Television Distribution\" and now \"CBS Media Ventures\"), by transferring the domestic rights of the Viacom library. Viacom International was later reorganized as the parent company of MTV Networks and Showtime Networks. Viacom transferred the international rights of the said library into Paramount International Television, while Viacom Productions was reincorporated as a production sub-division of Paramount Television. The Viacom Enterprises logo of the era was still used for \"Viacom Productions\" with an updated variant, and would remain until 1999, receiving another update to the logo to reflect the company's new status after merging with former parent company CBS. The 1999-2004 Viacom logo would be its last, as the final two series to end under the Viacom Productions name would be Ed and The Division.\n\nIn light of serious financial troubles brought on to Viacom, the production unit was folded into Paramount Network Television (now \"CBS Studios\") in 2004. Paramount took control of the remaining Viacom-produced series in 2005. On December 31 of that year, Viacom was reincorporated as \"CBS Corporation\", ceasing to exist officially. A \"new\" Viacom was established on the same day, as the holding company for Paramount Pictures, the MTV Networks, BET Networks, and their non-television firms. By 2009, most Viacom-distributed TV productions were distributed under CBS Media Ventures (formerly \"CBS Paramount Domestic Television\" and \"CBS Television Distribution\") and outside the U.S. under Paramount Global Content Distribution (formerly \"CBS Paramount International Television\" and \"CBS Studios International\"), while the previous Viacom-distributed movies, and some Viacom Domestic Media Networks TV shows were distributed by Paramount with U.S. over-the-air rights licensed to Trifecta Entertainment and Media. On December 4, 2019, Viacom and CBS re-merged, forming ViacomCBS. On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS was renamed to Paramount Global, putting the Viacom name to rest after 51 years.\n\nBefore the Paramount purchase, Viacom titles were distributed on home video by Magnetic Video Corporation, CBS Video Enterprises (coincidental as Viacom would later own CBS), Warner Home Video, VidAmerica, Forum Home Video and U.S.A. Home Video, among others. A little known fact is that Viacom actually stands for \"Visual Audio Communications\".\n\n1st Logo (June 4, 1971-June 1976)\n\nVisuals: On a purple background, the letter \"V\" slides in from the right of the screen, settling in the left-hand side. Then the text \"iA\" slides in, settling beside the \"V\". When this happens, the color of the background changes to green. Then, the text \"COM\" slides in, settling beside \"VIA\" and changing the background to red. This forms the word \"ViACOM\". Finally, the word zooms out as the words \"A\" and \"pRESENTATiON\" fade in to the left and right of it, respectively, revealing the text in its entirety as the background changes to blue.\n\nTrivia: The logo is actually in the same font as The Mary Tyler Moore Show logo, Peignot.\n\nVariant: The logo is in B&W on early '70s prints of The Andy Griffith Show, Perry Mason, I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Our Miss Brooks, The Phil Silvers Show, The Twilight Zone, and The Beverly Hillbillies, among other classic shows. It also appears on a VHS of The Andy Griffith Show released by Premier Promotions, titled The Andy Griffith Show Double Feature Volume 33.\n\nTechnique: Camera-controlled/cel animation.\n\nAudio: Four synthesized pinball-like chimes that ascend in pitch. The first 3 play as each part of \"ViACOM\" slides in, and the last, which plays over the zoom-out, has a \"zap\" sound that blends in with the last bell, combined with a synth chord and gurgling, telephone-like sounds.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThe logo may be silent on some prints.\n\nThe soundtrack might sound distorted on some prints. This happens because lab technicians print the soundtrack onto the film at a louder volume than usual.\n\nOne variation has the soundtrack out-of-sync with the logo. This was seen on Season 11, Episode 20 (Me-TV airing) and Season 12, Episode 12 (Odyssey/Hallmark airing) of My Three Sons.\n\nOn a 1985 French airing of Hawaii-Five-O, a beeping sound is heard instead.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe color version turned up on many season 11 and 12 episodes of My Three Sons on Odyssey Network/The Hallmark Channel back in the early 2000s. Many variations have also been spotted on these episodes when shown on Me-TV, as part of an unusual combo with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo preceding it (with the exception of one episode, S12 E23, which first aired on August 2, 2018). These sightings mark the first known time this Viacom logo has been seen on national American television since the Odyssey/Hallmark airings from the early 2000s.\n\nIn the original 2002 write-up of this article, it was suggested that the same prints of My Three Sons that had this logo had aired on Nick at Nite between 1988 and 1990.\n\nAmazon prints of these episodes also preserve this logo, as they use the same aforementioned prints.\n\nThe dark variant was spotted on several color episodes of My Three Sons and the Magnetic Video VHS release of 5 Terrytoon Cartoons Featuring Heckle and Jeckle.\n\nThis logo can also be found on earlier 16mm syndication dupes of shows/movies distributed by Viacom, mostly before 1976, which occasionally appear on eBay. Such shows include: My Three Sons, Hogan's Heroes, and The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nThis logo is also preserved at the end of a 16mm print of the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! episode \"What the Hex Going On?\" from South Africa, following the 1969 Hanna-Barbera \"Multiplying Rectangles\" logo.\n\nThis logo can also be seen on some older prints of episodes of Whirlybirds, Petticoat Junction, pre-mid-1970s prints of The Rookies (which is now with Sony Pictures Television), Family Affair, The Houndcats, the Canadian produced TV series The Amazing World of Kreskin, and foreign prints of The Banana Splits and Friends Show, Josie and the Pussycats, Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley in Their Flying Machines, The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, The Roman Holidays, The Harlem Globetrotters, among others; that includes 16mm kinescopes. It is unknown whether it was seen on early international Space Ghost and Dino Boy reruns. Check old 16mms.\n\nOlder international prints of Charlie Brown specials from A Charlie Brown Christmas to approximately It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown may have this logo. Check 16mms if they turn up.\n\nOnly a small amount of home media releases retain this logo.\n\nAt least one VHS release of The Houndcats has this logo (that one being the UAV Corporation release), but it is unknown how many more have it, including releases from Trans World Entertainment, or the current DVD releases.\n\nIt can also be found on the U.S. VHS release of The Andy Griffith Show by Premier Promotions.\n\nThis logo has also been sighted on a DVD release from Mill Creek, '100 Awesomely Cheesy Movies', which is a repackaging of another two Mill Creek DVD sets. On \"The Swingin' Seventies\" section of the DVD, the 1970 TV movie adaptation of Jane Eyre retains the color logo at the end.\n\nLegacy: This logo isn't anywhere close to being as well known (or feared) as its successors, not only because of its short lifespan but also because it was commonly plastered with newer logos. The pinball sounds in this logo gave it the nickname \"Pinball\".\n\n2nd Logo (June 1976-September 13, 1986)\n\nVisuals: On a sky blue (or lavender) background, the text \"A Viacom Presentation\" in a Palatino-like typeface zooms in from the center of the screen at a very fast pace, then stops abruptly (on the filmed variant) when it gets near the screen. Then, a stylized navy blue \"V\" (a downward trapezoid with a curved line in the near center) appears from the center. At first it is small, but the \"V\" starts to move gradually closer and closer towards the screen, almost to the point where it takes up nearly the entire frame. The logo then suddenly cuts to black or fades to black (depending on the version of the logo).\n\nVariants:\n\nTwo versions of this logo have been used throughout its life.\n\nThe original version of this logo was filmed, and was used from 1976 until 1985.\n\nVideotaped variants have the words \"A\" and \"Viacom\" spaced farther apart, and the animation is also much smoother. This was used from 1978 to 1986.\n\nFilmed Variants:\n\nA black and white version of the filmed \"V\" was used in the earlier years.\n\nAn early color variant of the filmed version exists, where the \"V\" is black, with a light blue background. The more common version premiered by 1977.\n\nSome filmed variants feature the \"V\" actually stopping right before it cuts to black. This was largely common in its earlier years (especially in black & white variants).\n\nDark variants of the Film-O-Vision version in color and B&W, due to film deterioration, exist.\n\nThe first second is lopped off on the 1979 version of Magnetic Video's VHS release of Blue Hawaii.\n\nA \"blacked-out\" variant also exists, which can be found on film prints of episodes of Greatest Heroes of the Bible on the Internet Archive, which has the \"V of Doom\" music on either the \"END OF PART ONE\" or \"THE END\" card, likely due to sloppy plastering.\n\nSimilarly, one 16mm print of an episode of Speed Buggy stopped after the credits, but the logo's audio still plays over the frozen screen.\n\nVideotaped Variants:\n\nThe logo has seen several different color variants appear. Color variants include black and white, a purple background with dark blue \"V\", and a faint purple background with a blue \"V\", among others.\n\nA videotaped variant featuring a yellow \"V\" was used on some syndicated prints of The Honeymooners, appearing in a giant moon over a city skyline where the credits appear. This is a result of a chroma-key mistake. This variation was given the nickname \"V of Moon\". A corrected version of this was seen on a WPIX airing.\n\nThere is also a variant with a jungle green background and a Charleston green \"V\".\n\nThere is a rumored purple variant where the background is lavender and the V is purple.\n\nA turquoise variant with an ultramarine blue \"V\" was used in 1984. The \"V\" also stops moving before the screen fades to black.\n\nA videotaped variant of this logo has an orange background and a midnight blue \"V\", seen on 1978 episodes of You Don't Say!. There is also a warp speed version of this.\n\nA videotaped variant with the logo superimposed in a circle over a moving starfield background was used on the short-lived series Hot City. This is nicknamed the \"V in Space\".\n\nA \"warp-speed\" videotaped variation where the logo and music are sped up exists. This was used alongside co-distributor logos and was seen from 1979-1986.\n\nA variant where the \"V\" is dark red on a pink background also exists, which appeared on the 1985 syndicated series The Star Games. It also appeared on a 1994 rerun of an episode of The Andy Griffith Show.\n\nA videotaped variant with a lime background also exists, which was found on an episode of The Andy Griffith Show on TBS Superstation in 1992, and on the Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Wrongful Writ\" on a TBS Superstation broadcast from March 13, 1991.\n\nA high pitched, slightly sped-up version of the videotaped variant also exists, which was spotted on the Cannon episode \"He Who Digs a Grave (Part 2)\" on MeTV. As of May 2019, this variant is still intact.\n\nTechnique:\n\nCamera-controlled/cel animation for the filmed version.\n\nChyron effects (possibly done in Scanimate) for the videotaped version.\n\nAudio: Here are the main music variants used on this logo:\n\nUsually, the music used is a five-note synthesized fanfare (composed on an ARP Odyssey synth), complete with a timpani drum roll playing throughout with a final, rather loud pound at the end. This was composed by Viacom’s music director at the time. Even after the logo fades (or cuts) to black, the timpani's echo can still be heard. It is different for both the filmed and videotaped variants, with the audio quality being clearer for the latter.\n\nThe very first version of this logo featured the \"Pinball\" music from the first logo as a placeholder and was used eventually until late 1978 (and was also often used when replacing the original \"Pinball\" logo, possibly a bad plastering error). This variant is known as the \"V of Pinball\".\n\n1976-1981: The very first version of the normal 1976 music was slightly faster-paced and low-pitched. This was used on the black and white and early color variants of the logo, and it was also used in tandem with the standard filmed variant from the mid-to-late 1970s.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn some cases, the closing theme of the show is used, or none.\n\nThe turquoise variant of the logo has two extra pounds of the timpani at the end.\n\nSometimes, the \"V of Doom\" music cuts off right before the last timpani beat, removing the final echo in the process, which can be found on the Magnetic Video release of Don't Give Up the Ship.\n\nSometimes on the filmed variant, the first note or two can be cut off. Often, the final bit of the show's closing theme will play over the logo briefly. This is caused by a bad splice on the film between the credits and the logo. An example of this would be the Season 11 finale to My Three Sons.\n\nOn The Beverly Hillbillies episode \"Christmas with the Clampetts\", and perhaps other episodes from the first two seasons, it has a generic theme (the show's theme couldn't be used due to it being copyrighted while episodes from the first two seasons have fallen into the public domain) playing over the filmed version of this logo.\n\nOn the Have Gun, Will Travel season 3 episode \"Fragile\" on Me-TV and H&I, the 1987 Paramount Television theme plays faintly over a black screen before the videotaped variant appears, due to a double plaster.\n\nOn the Hot City variant, the music starts playing over the last bit of the closing song.\n\nOn a 1985 WTBS airing of Girls! Girls! Girls!, a split second of the \"Pinball\" music can be heard before the normal music starts, due to sloppy plastering.\n\nA print of the B&W filmed variant where the fanfare is badly warped also exists. It's rumored to be found on an Andy Griffith VHS release called Mayhem in Mayberry.\n\nAvailability: Most shows that had this logo have been updated with either the \"V of Steel\" or \"Wigga Wigga\" logos, or those of Paramount Domestic Television, CBS Paramount Domestic/Network Television, or CBS Television Distribution. However, newer variants might be seen on local stations that show older Viacom shows, such as The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, Rawhide, Hogan's Heroes, The Twilight Zone, and Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C. All variants of the \"V of Doom\" (with the exception of the \"V of Pinball\" until evidence is found) can be seen on VHS tapes of The Andy Griffith Show released by various video outlets such as Premier Promotions and sometimes (though mostly the videotaped variant) by UAV Corporation.\n\nV of Pinball:\n\nThe B&W filmed variant with the \"Pinball\" theme can be found on the Magnetic Video releases of King Creole (also on the Key Video re-releases) and Visit to a Small Planet.\n\nThis variant was also resurfaced on a 16mm print of The Phil Silvers Show.\n\nIts color counterpart has been seen on the 1975 TV movie Eric, and is also intact on the film's VHS release, the Magnetic Video release of Girls! Girls! Girls! (also on the 1985 Key Video re-release), the Australian Magnetic Video VHS release of All in a Night's Work, and on one mid-1970s print of an early color episode of Gunsmoke, which aired on Superstation WTBS back in 1986.\n\nFilmed Variant:\n\nIt can be found at the end of most Viacom syndication prints of the time, on shows such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show, I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, The Phil Silvers Show, and My Three Sons. It was also seen on the Season 11 finale of My Three Sons on Hallmark back around 2000, and was again seen on a Me-TV airing of the latter on July 2, 2018, with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo preceding it.\n\nIt is also seen on some TV movies from the era, such as Police Story, The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan, and Top Secret (1978), among others. It can also be found on the original Magnetic Video VHS releases of many feature films, such as Last Train from Gun Hill and possibly All in a Night's Work; those featuring Elvis Presley, including G.I. Blues (also on the 1985 Key Video re-release) and Blue Hawaii; those featuring Jerry Lewis, including Don't Give Up the Ship and at the end of earlier video prints of the 1981 film Firebird 2015 AD and the 1980 film The Unseen, while the videotaped variant makes an appearance at the beginning of the latter film (the same also applied to an '80s broadcast on the USA Network).\n\nThe faster music variant is preserved on the 1985 Family Home Entertainment release of Little Lord Fauntleroy and its 1988 SLP reissue.\n\nThe filmed variant can be seen on Cozi TV airings of episodes from the first two seasons of The Beverly Hillbillies, due to said network using public domain prints of that show.\n\nIt was also seen on Nelvana's first special A Cosmic Christmas, and is intact on current prints of the special whenever it gets aired on TV, as well as on Amazon Prime and Nelvana's Keep it Weird YouTube channel (where it is followed by the 2004 Nelvana logo), in addition to Terror In The Wax Museum on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe B&W filmed variant was once spotted on an episode of Perry Mason on Me-TV before it was replaced with a later print sometime in 2015.\n\nIt can also be spotted on almost every episode of The Millionaire, which could occasionally be seen on Decades, prior to the network turning into Catchy Comedy in 2023.\n\nThe color variant of the filmed variant was seen on some prints of The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and currently on three episodes of Gunsmoke on Me-TV (\"The Witness\", \"Eleven Dollars\", and \"Kitty's Love Affair\") and one episode (\"Like Old Times\") on CBS Drama in the UK.\n\nThe B&W filmed variant variant can also be spotted on DVD releases of The Beverly Hillbillies released by the Platinum Disc Corporation, Madacy Entertainment, Mill Creek Entertainment, and GoodTimes Entertainment, among other companies.\n\nIt is unknown if this is preserved intact on the Magnum Entertainment releases of The Deerslayer, The Last of the Mohicans (1977) or California Gold Rush, the Magnetic Video VHS release and 1985 Key Video re-release of Roustabout, or the 1985 Key Video re-issue of Blue Hawaii.\n\nLate 1970s-early 1980s broadcasts of The Alvin Show and international broadcasts of Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley in Their Flying Machines, The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, Josie & The Pussycats, Speed Buggy, Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, The Funky Phantom, The Super Globetrotters, and Help!... It's The Hair Bear Bunch! also ended with this logo; 16mm prints of at least the former two shows retain the logo. It is unknown whether it is preserved on The Banana Splits and Friends Show, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! or Space Ghost and Dino Boy reruns from the era (apparently, for the latter, Hanna-Barbera's World of Super Adventure cut the logos). Again, check old 16mm prints.\n\nOlder international prints of Charlie Brown specials from It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown to approximately You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown may also have this logo. Check 16mm prints if they turn up.\n\nAs of 2024, this can be found on episodes of Monster Squad on Tubi.\n\nThe low-tone variant was used from 1976 to 1978 on syndicated prints of shows such as The Millionare and Hawaii Five-O. It decreased in usage through 1979 and the early '80s, but it was still used on Hawaii Five-O as late as 1981.\n\nA blue variant with a green noise is shown on the 2024 Rifftrax Grimtrax video-on-demand release of the TV edit of the 1980 movie Virus (AKA: Virus: Day of Resurrection).\n\nVideotaped Variant:\n\nThe videotaped version was seen on Perry Mason on Me-TV, but since 2015, they have started to use remastered DVD prints with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo. However, these older prints can still be seen on FETV.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of most Cannon episodes, mostly between seasons 3-5, shown on Me-TV (and whenever it was shown on Decades, also owned by the parent company of Me-TV, Weigel Broadcasting), and can also be found on DVD of these seasons; the DVD of Season 3 has a combo of this with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo following it, while the remaining two seasons have the videotaped VoD alone.\n\nSeveral of the \"Classic 39\" episodes of The Honeymooners, as well as the \"lost\" episodes also had this logo when they previously aired on WGN America and TBS Superstation. Newer prints of the \"lost\" episodes use the MPI Home Video logo instead, as they used DVD prints as the source material.\n\nIt was also seen on episodes of The (New) Price is Right from 1976-1980.\n\nThe 1978 and 1983 variants were formerly seen on two episodes of The Twilight Zone on Syfy (\"You Drive\" and \"One for the Angels\"), until the channel acquired updated prints sometime in 2015.\n\nIt was also seen on a 2012 airing of The Missiles of October on Me-TV, before the 1990 \"Wigga Wigga\" logo; however, newer prints, such as a Decades airing, used the 2007 CTD logo instead.\n\nThe warp-speed variant was also resurfaced on a rerun of The Bob Newhart Show S5 episode \"Making Up Is the Thing To Do\" on Me-TV, Hallmark Channel, Decades (occasionally), Sundance, and FamNET, after the decorated MTM Enterprises logo and preceding the 2013 20th Television logo, and is also available on various season 5 and 6 episodes of that show on Shout Factory's 2014 complete series set, as well as solo releases of said seasons and Me-TV airings of most season 6 episodes, with the logo on a majority of those episodes being followed by the 2013 20th Television logo.\n\nIt can also be seen on two season 3 episodes of Have Gun, Will Travel on Me-TV and H&I (\"Fragile\" and \"The Black Handkerchief\").\n\nIt was also seen on some episodes of All in the Family before Columbia Pictures Television Distribution (now Sony Pictures Television) acquired the syndication rights to that show.\n\nThe videotaped variant was also resurfaced on two Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C. VHS releases released by Forum Home Video in 1989, as well as The Devil and Daniel Mouse, which is included as an extra on the Blu-ray release of Nelvana's Rock & Rule.\n\nIt also makes an appearance at the start of the original VHS release of the 1980 film The Unseen (also intact on an '80s USA Network airing), while the filmed variant appears at the end.\n\nThis logo was also seen on a Decades airing of the season 2 Bob Newhart Show episode \"The Modernization of Emily\".\n\nThis variant had also resurfaced on GSN and Buzzr airings of a 1980 episode of To Tell the Truth.\n\nThis logo was also seen on the original broadcasts of Family Feud's first syndicated run (where it was preceded by in-credit text), but does not appear to have ever been retained in repeat airings.\n\nThis also made appearances on Sky Go New Zealand prints of some episodes of All in the Family (such as season 1 episode 2).\n\nSilent Variant:\n\nIt can be found on old VHS releases of the 1963 movie Fun in Acapulco and the 1966 movie Paradise, Hawaiian Style from Magnetic Video (both of which plaster over the Paramount logo at the end of the film, though the Spanish-dubbed version, as well as the 1985 Key Video reprint (In English) of the latter film uses the standard \"V of Doom\" music), the 1974 TV movie The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman from Prism Entertainment, and the 1976 movie The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena.\n\nIt is also retained on the 1985 Key Video re-issue of Fun in Acapulco.\n\nIt was also spotted on an '80s USA Network airing of the 1968 movie Mission Mars (it is unknown if it's intact on any VHS releases of the movie).\n\n16mm prints of Fun in Acapulco also have this variation.\n\nLegacy: This logo gained a reputation as one of the scariest logos of all time when it was used, due to its animation and music (more so with the warp-speed and B&W variants), earning the unofficial nickname \"V of Doom\". Nonetheless, it has been known to be a memorable one for those who grew up with this logo, and has been a fan favorite in the community.\n\n3rd Logo (June 24, 1978-1985)\n\nVisuals: On a sea green/dark blue background, a black \"V\" and the name \"Viacom\" zoom in together and stop smoothly once they take up most of the screen.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the \"V\" slides in from the left with \"Viacom\" sliding in from the right.\n\nA variation features a copyright stamp for \"Viacom International\" appearing at the bottom once the \"V\" stops zooming almost completely.\n\nA version with a mirrored \"V\" has also been spotted, where the logo flips up.\n\nA still version exists.\n\nOn For Heaven's Sake, the logo animates on a television, before being switched off by a character from the show.\n\nTechnique: Usually camera-controlled/cel animation, but for the still logo, a still, printed image.\n\nAudio: Only the closing theme of the show or TV movie, or none.\n\nAudio Variant: On some programs, a re-orchestrated/rearranged version of the previous logo's theme, punctuated by a steel-stringed guitar, is heard.\n\nAvailability: This logo was used for network television productions.\n\nDuring the 1980s, it was seen on various shows and TV movies produced by this company, such as The Master, The Devlin Connection, Amanda's, Dear Detective, Ace Crawford: Private Eye, The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair, and To Race the Wind, among others; however, very few have been released onto VHS or DVD.\n\nOlder prints such as VHS releases might have this logo intact but the later releases such as on DVD or Blu-Ray generally plaster this with the CBS Television Distribution logo. Cases in point; To Race the Wind, on which said variant was intact on a 2011 True Movies 1 airing of the film (before the silent 1995 Paramount Domestic Television logo), and The Devlin Connection, The Master and The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair, which were released on video by Trans World Entertainment (but the DVD releases of the latter two use the CBS Television Distribution logo instead).\n\nThe version with the re-orchestrated theme was created for the 1979 ABC series The MacKenzies of Paradise Cove (also known as Wonderland Cove), and also appeared on the unsold 1978 ABC pilot Snavely.\n\nIt is unknown if it's preserved on the U.S.A. Home Video releases of East of Eden (1981) or For Ladies Only; it is, however, preserved on the Starmaker Video reprint of the former film.\n\nTrue Entertainment (now GREAT! TV) airings of Kids Don't Tell have this intact.\n\nThis is kept intact on The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair whenever it is aired on LEGEND in the UK, although DVD prints remove this and replace it with the CBS Television Distribution logo.\n\n4th Logo (1981)\n\nVisuals:\n\nOpening: On a black background, a \"V\" rotates towards the center of the screen in a rainbow trail. Then the trail moves behind the logo, and the \"V\" flashes to bright cerulean. The word \"Viacom\" in the same color flashes in with the word \"presents\" below. As the opening theme starts, the camera slowly zooms up to the left corner of the \"V\" until it engulfs the screen with blue.\n\nClosing: At the end of the reel, a \"V\" is seen with the word \"Viacom\" in blue and the word \"from\" above the \"V\", and they all zoom in towards the viewer.\n\nTechnique: Motion-controlled animation.\n\nAudio: The opening and closing themes of the syndie promo or none.\n\nAvailability: The only sighting that has come up is a sales tape for individual stations to purchase syndication rights for Viacom-owned shows. The tape used for the captures above is from a Hawaii Five-O sales tape.\n\n5th Logo (1983-1986)\n\nVisuals: The logo starts in outer space. The words \"Special\" and \"Delivery\" streak through the sun in the background, leaving a rainbow trail. Then on a blue/black gradient background, the two words fly towards a stylized gold ring with wings and the familiar \"V\" from the 2nd logo on its base. \"From Viacom\" with \"Viacom\", bigger and set in its corporate font, also fly towards the ring, settling inside it. The logo then constantly shines, occasionally flashing. At the end, a firework flash effect emerges from the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nA short variant exists.\n\nA extended version also exists, where \"From Viacom\" streaks in after \"Special\" and \"Delivery\", followed by the border being formed, rotating and dropping down as a rainbow-trailing outline, before retracting and fading to gold, flashing once. The rest of the logo plays out normally.\n\nTechnique: Motion-controlled animation.\n\nAudio: After a drum roll at the start, a majestic 13-note fanfare plays, with the last note held out. The last half plays for the short version, while it's extended for the long version.\n\nAvailability: It was seen on the 1984 Twilight Zone Silver Anniversary special, as well as mid-'80s prints of classic Rankin/Bass TV specials (including Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town), and some TV movies from the era, among others.\n\n6th Logo (December 1, 1985-May 24, 1987)\n\nVisuals: On a black background is a still image of the Viacom \"V\" logo in blue, and the name \"Viacom\" in white below.\n\nVariant: On Really Weird Tales, the \"V\" and name are smaller and colored orange.\n\nTechnique: A still graphic.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show/TV movie or none.\n\nAvailability: This logo was used for network television productions, replacing the 3rd logo.\n\nIt was once seen on original airings of the first 3 episodes of the first season of Matlock on NBC plus its pilot episode (from March 1986), as well as on the Andy Griffith reunion special Return to Mayberry and the first five made-for-TV movie revivals of Perry Mason, but most have all fallen victim of being plastered with the \"V of Steel\" or \"Wigga Wigga\", 1995 or 2003 Paramount Domestic Television, CBS Paramount Network Television (\"Wallpaper\"), or CBS Television Distribution logos.\n\nA November 2013 airing of Return to Mayberry on Me-TV left this logo intact, followed by a silent 1995 Paramount Domestic Television logo. However, on November 21, 2017, a rebroadcast on said network had it plastered with the CBS Television Distribution logo as it used a newer print. It is also plastered on the film's DVD release and also the Blu-Ray version (said special is included as an extra on the season 1 Blu-ray of The Andy Griffith Show).\n\nIt is preserved on the VHS releases of Return to Mayberry, Perry Mason Returns, Really Weird Tales, and a Brazilian VHS release of the Matlock pilot movie Diary of a Perfect Murder, among possible others.\n\nIt was also preserved on Perry Mason: The Case of the Notorious Nun when it aired on Encore Mystery, but Encore Suspense airings cut the end theme off early and plaster it over with the CBS Television Distribution logo, while Me-TV and Hallmark airings plaster it over with the 1990 \"Wigga Wigga\" logo.\n\nIt is preserved on the 2016 Kino Lorber DVD of Really Weird Tales, followed by the \"Wigga Wigga\" and CBS Television Distribution logos.\n\n7th Logo (May 13, 1985-1986)\n\nVisuals:\n\nOpening: Against a space background with twinkling stars, a metallic steel outline of the Viacom \"V\" and \"Viacom\" in its familiar Palatino-like font zoom back with a metallic steel trail effect. The trail effect finishes as the \"V\" turns solid and metallic and \"Viacom\" turns solid grey. The logo shines in a similar manner as the \"Special Delivery\" logo before flying downwards and offscreen.\n\nClosing: Against a city skyline with a purple night sky with most of the building's lights switched on and twinkling stars (a colorized version of the city from the opening credits of The Honeymooners), the metallic textured \"V\" forms out of light particles. The word \"Viacom\" forms in the same manner as in the opening variant. The logo shines once completed.\n\nVariant: An extended version of the closing variant exists on the sales tape for The Lost Honeymooners, where the logo shines multiple times after completing.\n\nTechnique: Backlit/slit-scan animation.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show. Promotional reels featured Christopher Plummer saying \"...Because Viacom (pronounced as \"Vee-a-Com\") presents, for the very first time in syndication...\".\n\nAudio Variants: On some occasions, Plummer's voice is not used. Sometimes, when the closing theme or when the Viacom \"V of Doom\" music plays over the logo, he instead says \"From Viacom\" (once again pronouncing it as \"vee-a-com\").\n\nAvailability:\n\nBoth variants appeared on a sales tape for The Lost Honeymooners.\n\nThe closing variant has been seen on at least two Honeymooners specials, those being Jackie Gleason Presents: the Honeymooners Reunion and Season's Greetings From the Honeymooners. The former has not been seen since its one and only airing in 1985 while the latter was a special premiere for 3 lost Honeymooners episodes.\n\n8th Logo (September 13, 1986-December? 1989)\n\nVisuals: The logo starts out with a screen that's divided in two, with a black/purple gradient on top and silver on the bottom, with a bright light flare shining between. The silver part then rotates counter-clockwise (a la CBS/Fox Video), revealing it is a steel version of the \"V\" logo as the background changes to a black/blue/purple gradient. The word \"Viacom\" flies in from the upper-left of the screen and settles underneath the \"V\", reflecting the text. The finished logo shines.\n\nVariants:\n\nA couple of \"warp-speed\" versions exist, the first of which is a slower version of the regular jingle and the second of which is an ultra warp speed version (featuring a higher pitched jingle), can be seen on various programs, if they haven't been plastered.\n\nVHS releases containing this logo and select TV broadcasts have the \"V\" shining three times.\n\nA warp speed version of the three shines variant exists, which was seen on the syndicated version of Super Sloppy Double Dare.\n\nA variant where the \"V\" shines four times also exists, which was seen on episodes of Rawhide, Perry Mason, Matlock (seasons 1-4), Hogan's Heroes, The Adventures of the Little Koala, Finders Keepers (Toffler version), Easy Street (1986 series), and the 1986 revival of Split Second. There is also a warp speed version of this, as well as an ultra warp speed variant.\n\nA still variant also exists.\n\nA variant where the \"V\" doesn't shine at all also exists, which was only seen on We Love Lucy; the 30-minute re-edit of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.\n\nOn the 1987 Celebrity Double Dare pilot, the logo is revealed with a computer-generated effect before animating.\n\nA B&W variant of the logo exists, which is used on B&W shows.\n\nAnother sped-up variant of this logo with the music at the normal speed exists.\n\nA variant which plays at a slightly slower speed also exists.\n\nOn Fox's Family Double Dare, the logo fades in after the Nickelodeon logo, with the \"V\" already in place and shining two times before fading out.\n\nA variant where both the \"V\" and \"Viacom\" appear to be in higher contrast exists, making the logo look shinier than normal.\n\nOne version had a midnight blue screen with text saying \"DISTRIBUTED BY\", and then after a second, it cut to the \"V\" in the middle of its animation, with the full music playing throughout.\n\nAnother version cuts to when the \"V\" starts rotating. This is unofficially known as the \"in-progress\" variant.\n\nA variant where the logo starts off in black and white, but quickly changes to color also exists, which was spotted on a 1988 rerun of The Andy Griffith Show on TBS Superstation.\n\nThe British Braveworld Video VHS release of King Creole has a variant that cuts off the first or so second from the logo.\n\nOn an episode of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams on GetTV, the logo starts fading during the second time it shines.\n\nOn some episodes of 1990s TBS Superstation airings of Perry Mason, the logo is colored green.\n\nOn the 1988 Milwaukee Public Access (Viacom) parody of Star Trek titled Far Trek, cheap text in red that says \"COMMUNITY ACCESS NORTHSHORE\" fades in.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A series of pindrop-like synth notes and a high synth drone, later joined by a descending synth chord, and a \"glittery\" noise for when the \"V\" shines.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn some cases, it uses only the closing theme of the show or none.\n\nSome episodes of Cannon and Perry Mason on Me-TV have/had the \"V of Doom\" music playing over this (MeTV later received updated CBSTD prints of the aforementioned episodes of both, though the aforementioned Perry Mason prints have since resurfaced on FETV).\n\nSome episodes of Gunsmoke, Matlock (seasons 1-4), and one episode of Hogan's Heroes (seen in Australia) have the 1990 \"Wigga-Wigga\" music playing over this. A Russian print of the Father Dowling Mysteries episode \"The What Do You Call a Call Girl Mystery\" also features this over the warp-speed variant, which continues into the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo.\n\nA variant of the extended warp-speed (three wipes) variant includes a voice-over, which was seen on a sales tape for the un-aired game show I Predict. As the logo animates, the voice-over is heard saying: \"A Ron Greenberg Production, in association with Viacom.\" (Pronounced \"Vee-a-com\", similar to Sandy Hoyt on Split Second).\n\nOn a late-1980s print of the movie Running, the normal variant features two very faint copies of the theme playing and overlapping each other that are both off-sync with the animation, making them continue long after the logo fades to black.\n\nAvailability:\n\nRegular Variant (One Wipe):\n\nIt is currently seen on Rawhide on Me-TV, Decades (occasionally) and H&I.\n\nIt is also currently seen on most episodes of The Phil Silvers Show on Me-TV, Forces TV (UK) and occasionally seen on Decades (Now Catchy Comedy), and it is preserved on the season 2 Shout! Factory DVD release of the show, and on most episodes from seasons 3-4 of TPSS on DVD (season 1 on DVD and the UK DVD releases use the 2007 CTD logo instead), and was on most episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, as well as Gunsmoke (mostly color reruns) on Me-TV before they were issued updated prints by CBS, although for The Beverly Hillbillies, it can still be seen on some episodes (the earliest episode to have this is \"Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch\"), and as for Gunsmoke, it can still be seen on certain episodes from season 14 (the third color season) onward.\n\nIt was also spotted on the 1989 film Sonny Boy on TCM as well as AMC, and has also been spotted on syndicated prints of Cannon films, such as Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\n\nThis can also be seen on most episodes of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams on DVD.\n\nIt was also seen on '80s prints of other Viacom-distributed shows, including at one point in time, episodes of The Andy Griffith Show (particularly reruns on TBS Superstation), as well as episodes of I Love Lucy on Nick at Nite (as well as AMC briefly), Have Gun-Will Travel on Encore Westerns, various prints of The Cosby Show and Roseanne, Rawhide on the Hallmark Channel as well as Encore Westerns, The Millionaire on TV Land, and various episodes of Hogan’s Heroes on Forces TV in the United Kingdom and Fox Classics in Australia, among possible others.\n\nIt is unknown if this was seen on '80s prints of The Dick Van Dyke Show, The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse, Petticoat Junction, The Houndcats, The Harlem Globetrotters (1970s cartoon), Hawaii Five-0, Amigo and Friends, Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C., The Honeymooners, Whirlybirds and Our Miss Brooks, among possible others.\n\nIt can also be seen on the Perry Mason made-for-TV movies from 1987-89, along with some prints of previous ones (though most use the warp speed variant), but the DVD releases plaster it over with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo. However, it is still preserved on some VHS releases such as the UK VHS release of Perry Mason: The Case of the Lethal Lesson, but these aren't easy to come by, and as far as we can tell, have never been released to VHS in the United States.\n\nIt was also seen on some episodes of Perry Mason on Me-TV before they were issued updated prints by CBS, but these prints can still be seen currently on FETV.\n\nThis logo (and its extended variants) is also seen on various game shows syndicated by Viacom from 1986-1990, including Split Second (most Gametv and Buzzr reruns retain it; some episodes on Buzzr plastered it with the current Fremantle logo, though), Double Dare (this includes later prints on iTunes and on Paramount+), and Remote Control.\n\nThe B&W variant can be found at the end of select VHS releases of The Andy Griffith Show that were released by Premier Promotions, including notably The Andy Griffith Show Collector's Series Volume 12: Mayberry Classics, and had also resurfaced on a Season 08 episode of Rawhide on Me-TV and H&I.\n\nThis logo was also spotted on UK VHS releases of Fun in Acapulco, King Creole, Roustabout and All in a Night's Work, older prints of Dempsey and Makepeace, Father Dowling Mysteries, a Decades broadcast of The Blue Knight (1975), at least one episode of The Twilight Zone on the French version of the Sci-Fi Channel, a Movies! broadcast of the 1971 docudrama Evel Knievel, a Escape (now Court TV Mystery) airing of the 1989 film Night Game, a TCM UK broadcast of Wild Geese II (1985), the 1987 Cannon film Three Kinds of Heat, which can also be found on Netflix UK, Amazon Prime, Paramount+ and Epix.com, and international prints of seasons 1-4 (and some of season 5) of Matlock, though most use the warp speed variant. It is still seen on a few Season 3-4 episodes of Matlock on CBS Justice (UK).\n\nThe \"in-progress\" variant can be found on the MCA/Universal Home Video VHS release of Super Force, the unsold Baby on Board pilot from 1988, as well as at least one episode of Rawhide on Me-TV.\n\nIt has also been seen on some episodes of A Different World on Netflix.\n\nIt was also spotted on syndicated prints of the 1979 Canadian sports drama, Running.\n\nThis also resurfaced on episodes of All in the Family on Sky Go New Zealand (such as the pilot).\n\nThis can also be seen on a late-2010s print of the film Katherine on YouTube Movies & Shows.\n\nThe green version was only seen on 90s TBS Superstation airings of Perry Mason (such as the episode “The Case of the Fickle Filly”).\n\nExtended Variants (3-4 Wipes):\n\nThe long variant (three wipes) can be found on the Family Home Entertainment VHS releases of The Adventures of the Little Koala and was on at least one episode of Perry Mason on Me-TV before being issued an updated print by CBS, while the long version with four wipes made its premiere on the short-lived NBC-aired sitcom Easy Street, and was last spotted on the Toffler version of Finders Keepers on the now-defunct Nick GAS network. This was also seen on the aforementioned game shows distributed by Viacom in the late 1980s; reruns of these shows on Nick GAS, as well as Paramount+, retain the logo. The three wipes variant was also spotted on a 2017 FETV broadcast of the Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Poison Pen Pal\".\n\nSilent Variant: Originally, it could only be seen on syndicated TV prints of The Stepford Wives (the 1975 version), though it was later resurfaced on the Forces TV print of the Hogan's Heroes episode \"The Most Escape-Proof Camp I've Ever Escaped From\", which is from season 2, although Fox Classics’ print has the theme present on it.\n\nWarp Speed Variant:\n\nThis can currently be found on some episodes of Rawhide on Me-TV, Decades (occasionally) and H&I.\n\nIt is also seen on older prints of Matlock (season 1-4, 1989 episodes; current TV and streaming prints use the 8th logo instead, while the DVD release of S1 uses CBS/Paramount and every other season on DVD uses the 2007 CTD logo instead). FETV's print of the Matlock S1 episode, \"The Don, Part 1\" had this preserved. Many Season 3 and 4 episodes of Matlock on CBS Justice (UK) as well as a few season 2 episodes and 2 season 1 episodes keep this logo intact. Its spin-off Jake and the Fatman (DVDs and TV prints of seasons 1 and 2 use CTD instead), Father Dowling Mysteries (including a few early season 3 episodes), and a Brazilian VHS release of Fatal Confession: A Father Dowling Mystery (and DVD print) all have this logo. It is also preserved on the Brazilian VHS release of Jake and the Fatman.\n\nThis is also preserved on the season 1 DVD release of Father Dowling Mysteries, preceded by the 2007 CTD logo and can be seen on the other two seasons as well. Decades airings used the DVD prints of Father Dowling Mysteries as well.\n\nA 2002 article on this logo said that this was seen on prints of Father Dowling Mysteries that aired on PAX (now Ion Television).\n\nIt was also seen on a 2016 British Horror Channel airing of Murder by Moonlight, and was presumably present on the film's original CBS broadcast.\n\nIt is unknown if this is preserved on season 3 and 1990 episodes of S4 of Jake and the Fatman on DVD.\n\nThe \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" variant is only known to exist on Superboy. However, the show's DVD release from Warner Home Video retains it.\n\nIt was also seen on that aforementioned program's episode \"A Day in the Double Life\".\n\nWarp Speed Variant (Extended):\n\nIt is usually plastered by either the 1990 \"Wigga-Wigga\", 1995 Paramount Domestic Television, 2006 CBS Paramount Domestic/Network Television (\"Eye in the Sky\" or \"Wallpaper\"), or 2007 CBS Television Distribution logos, though they have been spotted on a few episodes of Rawhide on Me-TV and H&I, and the four wipe version was also spotted on an Australian television print of the Hogan's Heroes episode \"Request Permission to Escape\", which is the last episode of season 1. When the episode aired in the UK on Forces TV, the last wipe was cut off. It was also seen on UK airings of some episodes of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.\n\nSped-Up Variant: Seen on Perry Mason: The Case of the Poisoned Pen. It was also seen on Season 3 and 4 episodes of Matlock, when last aired on CBS Justice in the UK.\n\nUltra Warp Speed Variant: The ultra warp speed version can be seen on Netflix's prints, most official YouTube prints, some VHS releases, and The Family Channel airings of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show and The Legend of Zelda (1989 cartoon), although international prints have the 1988 Saban International logo instead. The logo is also retained on the DVD release of the latter show's episode The Power of the Triforce as well.\n\nLegacy: Its CGI makes this logo a favorite among the logo community. It is known by the fan nickname \"V of Steel\".\n\n9th Logo (1990-May 11, 2000)\n\nVisuals: On a shaded blue background, a silver \"V\" flies in from the bottom, and moves towards the left. As it does so, a zig-zag line comes out of it to form the other letters in the word \"VIACOM\". The logo is seen shining throughout. The individual letters separate from the zig-zag line, with the \"A\" and \"M\" still having the form of zig-zags. The completed logo then shines.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis is often unofficially nicknamed as the \"Wigga Wigga\" logo, derived from the sounds heard as the zig-zag line appears.\n\nMany people think the announcer is mispronouncing the name Viacom. It is indeed pronounced with a long \"i\" sound, like in \"prize\", although the original pronunciation of the name pre-1986 was indeed with a short \"i\" sound, like in \"pizza\", hence Christopher Plummer's pronunciation as \"vee-a-com\". The post-1986 pronunciation was used by the announcer on the Magnetic Video logo several years before it became the official pronunciation.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a filmed variant seen on some TV movies from the era, like the 1996 Sabrina, the Teenage Witch television movie. Also seen on a British rerun as well as the Russian CBS Drama channel airing of the Father Dowling Mysteries season 2 episode \"The Ghost of a Chance Mystery\", which plastered over the \"V of Steel\" logo.\n\nSeveral shows have the name already formed during the later years, with the only animation being the shining of the letters.\n\nThere is a text variation on this logo for Viacom Productions. It has the \"VIACOM\" text already formed, but a line slides in from the right and forms \"PRODUCTIONS\" (in the Futura Extra Bold font), after which the \"C\" and \"O\" in \"VIACOM\" shine. This shorter variation was seen on network TV productions from 1998-2000. There was another variant of this in which the text doesn't shine at all, used on Diagnosis: Murder.\n\nOn original ABC broadcasts and on reruns of the Sabrina, the Teenage Witch pilot on ABC Family (now Freeform), The Hub (now Discovery Family), Antenna TV, and Pluto TV, this logo is still (a la the 1985 \"V of Happiness\" logo), on re-runs on said networks, it is followed by the 2003 Paramount Domestic Television logo (but plastered on DVD and Paramount+ by the CBS/Paramount \"Eye In The Sky\" logo).\n\nA black & white version of this exists on some prints of older B&W shows (most feature the color version).\n\nOn the 1997 TV movie The Right Connections, the words \"in association with\" are seen over the logo's background, then fades out when the animation starts. It was also spotted on another TV movie, In the Doghouse (1998), as well as the short-lived UPN series from 1995, Deadly Games.\n\nOn WPIX's print of the Honeymooners episode \"The Sleepwalker\", the logo freezes before it is fully formed. The audio is also distorted in this variant. It's likely an error in production.\n\nOn the 1996 TV movie Brothers of the Frontier (last seen on CBS Justice UK, and Disney Channel in the United States) and a Me-TV airing of the Matlock S7 episode \"The Class\", the short version of the logo is played in slow motion.\n\nOn the 1998 TV movie Inferno and the 1999 TV movie The Apartment Complex, the Productions variant has the text \"Viacom Productions, Inc. Exclusive Distributor\" in two lines below.\n\nTechnique: 2D motion-controlled animation by Atlantic Motion Pictures.\n\nAudio: Again, there have been several musical variations accompanied with a male voiceover saying \"Viacom\" near the end:\n\nUsually, a synthesized rock score is used, complete with drums, horns, and even a guitar. Four telephone-like \"wigga-wigga\" sounds are heard as the line zig-zags. (The music is actually \"Block\" from a Korg M1 synthesizer.)\n\nFor the (then-)newly-formed Viacom International, the same logo is accompanied by different music. A synthesized whoosh and timpani drum is heard first, leading into a jingle played on a flute sample (\"HardFlute\" taken from Program B on a Korg T1 synthesizer) being heard as the line uncurls. As the logo finishes, a faint choir is heard in the background. Synthesized \"shining\" sounds can be heard throughout the entire logo. The voice-over is still heard. Composed by Michael Rubin, known for his work on Blue's Clues.\n\nThere is a version where the voice-over cuts in earlier.\n\nSome versions have no voice-over. The Viacom Productions logo is one of these, except the variant used on Diagnosis: Murder and the TV movie Haley Wagner, Star. An extremely short version with no voice-over was seen for a brief time in 1996. This version is also followed by the 1995 Paramount Domestic Television logo.\n\nThere was a warped version during later years.\n\nThere is a low toned variant for the short version that appeared after an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn some cases, it used the closing theme of the show, generic network music on CBS, NBC, and ABC, or it was silent.\n\nThere is a variant with the \"V of Doom\" theme playing instead on several early-1990s syndie prints of classic TV movies from the era, plastering the 1976 filmed logo.\n\nThere is another variant with the \"V of Doom\" music playing faintly instead on some episodes of The Twilight Zone on Syfy, Perry Mason, and The Honeymooners both on Me-TV and last aired on WGN America. Sometimes, the short version plays with the normal music, but the \"V of Doom\" music can be heard again faintly in the background. This is sometimes called the \"Ghost of the V of Doom\".\n\nThere is a variant with the \"V of Steel\" theme playing instead on one episode of Gunsmoke as well as a Hungarian-dubbed rerun of the Father Dowling Mysteries season 1 episode \"The What Do You Call a Call Girl Mystery\" on AXN Crime. Father Dowling Mysteries S2 EP1 on the Russian CBS Drama channel also features this.\n\nOne episode of Rawhide on Me-TV has the warp-speed version of the logo with the warp-speed \"V of Steel\" music playing over it.\n\nA variant with the sped-up \"V of Steel\" music was reportedly sighted on a British rerun of the Matlock episode \"The Brothers\".\n\nAnother variant with the warp-speed VoS music playing under the regular version was spotted on a Hungarian-dubbed rerun of the Father Dowling Mysteries season 1 episode \"The Mafia Priest Mystery: Part 2\" on AXN Crime. This is unofficially called the \"Ghost of the V of Steel\". This may also have been spotted on an Australian rerun of Jake and the Fatman.\n\nThe Viacom Productions variant has used the 1999 music from the next logo on certain occasions. This has been sighted on an international print of the eighth episode of Season 7 of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, \"Bada-Ping!\", an Antenna TV airing of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch S7 episode \"Sabrina Unplugged\", and has also been reported to appear on some episodes of the final season of Diagnosis: Murder.\n\nA variant of the original \"Wigga Wigga\" logo without the announcer in it also exists.\n\nOn the TV movie My Body, My Child, the warped theme plays over the regular variant.\n\nAt the end of a Russian print of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, the 1971 Lorimar jingle plays over this logo. This is due to a plaster error.\n\nAvailability: This logo is quite infamous for plastering the older Viacom logos. Many of the shows that had this logo have been updated with either the Paramount Domestic Television, the CBS Paramount Domestic or Network Television logos (\"Eye in the Sky\" or \"Wallpaper\") or CBS Television Distribution logos by now, especially on DVD releases, but it is still seen on some shows and TV movies.\n\nRegular Variant:\n\nIt was spotted on the film I'm All Right Jack on TCM, the miniseries The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw on Grit (and possibly the DVD release), two episodes of Cannon on the season 3 DVD (and one episode on Me-TV, S03 E03), syndicated prints of Cannon Group films such as Masters of the Universe, and one episode of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams on DVD.\n\nIt has been spotted on reruns of color episodes of Gunsmoke on Me-TV and TV Land, albeit in split screen form on the latter channel, and was also spotted on The Alvin Show when rerun on Nickelodeon.\n\nHowever, later prints of Gunsmoke episodes from Season 12 (the first color season) and Season 13 and are now restored and now use CTD, though it can possibly still be spotted on almost all other episodes from Season 14 on (needs further confirmation).\n\nIt was also seen when Have Gun, Will Travel aired on Encore Westerns in the early 2010s, as well as some episodes of Perry Mason, Hogan's Heroes (these prints now air on UK television network Forces TV and Australian cable channel Fox Classics), and The Beverly Hillbillies on Me-TV and occasionally Decades before they both were issued updated prints by CBS (though it can be still be found in the majority of color episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies (S05-S09) and formerly on select episodes of Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C.; for the latter show, all episodes have been restored and use either CBS-Paramount or CTD.\n\nFETV prints of Perry Mason still have this logo intact on many episodes.\n\nIn the past, episodes of I Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour on Nick at Nite and TV Land had this logo as well.\n\nIt could also be seen on the Perry Mason TV movies from 1990-95, and some prints of older ones, but DVDs plaster it with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo.\n\nThe high pitched variant resurfaced on a British television broadcast of California Gold Rush.\n\nThis can also be found on Family Affair, My Three Sons (it also appeared on Season 11, Episode 12 of that show after the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo on a June 14, 2018 airing on Me-TV), VHS releases of Payoff (1991), a True Movies UK broadcast and Me-TV airings of the 1973 TV film A Dream for Christmas, the 2009 Warner Archive DVD-R of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973), the Republic Pictures VHS of Rent-a-Kid, the Prism Entertainment VHS of Memories of Murder (The original Lifetime broadcast used the warp speed 1986 \"V of Steel\" logo instead), VHS copies of The Right Connections, The Operation (AKA: Bodily Harm) (plastering the 7th logo which was used on the original CBS broadcast and also kept on a Lifetime airing), later Movies! broadcasts of Day of the Animals (1977) and The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, the Mexican VHS release of the Greatest Heroes of the Bible episode \"Abraham's Sacrifice\", They Watch, the Starmaker Video VHS releases of Last Train from Gun Hill, Donner Pass: The Road to Survival, Little Lord Fauntleroy (1980), The Incredible Rocky Mountain Race, and Perry Mason: The Case of the Lost Love, among possible others, a Brazilian VHS of the Sunn Classics adaptation of The Fall of the House of Usher, the Kino Lorber DVD of Really Weird Tales (after the 5th logo), a Brazilian VHS of the Viacom co-produced Italian film Blood Ties, the Vidmark Entertainment VHS of Murder by Moonlight, and international prints of Rawhide, along with some later prints on Heroes & Icons.\n\nIt was also spotted on a 2005 Superstation WGN (now NewsNation) airing of Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990), an old syndicated print of the New Line film Alone in the Dark (1982), an old syndicated print of Embryo (1976), a 2003 WE TV airing of Tears in the Rain (1988) and Sky Go New Zealand prints of some episodes of All in the Family like season 2 episode 6.\n\nIt also appears at the end of the 1977 TV movie The Last of the Mohicans when aired on LEGEND.\n\nWarp Speed Variant:\n\nIt's currently found on Matlock on WGN America, Me-TV, Decades (formerly), FETV, Pluto TV, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (it plasters over the the 7th logo on many episodes from seasons 1 to 4, and the 5th logo on later syndicated prints of the pilot episode for that show; DVDs use the CBS/Paramount \"Wallpaper\" logo for season 1 while 2-9 have CTD). Some episodes from seasons 6 and 7, and possibly 8, use the regular variant instead.\n\nAlso seen on the first 3 seasons and early season 4 episodes of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch on Antenna TV, Pluto TV, and Fuse (DVDs have the CBS/Paramount \"Eye In The Sky\" logo for season 1, while seasons 2-3 have the \"Wallpaper\" logo and 4-7 have CTD. Hulu prints use the CBS/Paramount \"Wallpaper\" logo for season 1, Paramount+ uses the DVD prints).\n\nIt's also seen on the first five seasons of Diagnosis: Murder on DVD, Encore Suspense, Me-TV, Decades (occasionally), and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (however, DVDs of season 2 use the 2006 CBS/Paramount \"Wallpaper\" logo instead).\n\nIt was also preserved at the end of the DVD print of the Jake and the Fatman S4 episode, \"It Never Entered My Mind\", which is included on the Diagnosis: Murder season 1 DVD.\n\nUltra Warp Speed Variant:\n\nThe version where the voice-over cuts in earlier was formerly seen on S1 episodes of The Twilight Zone on Syfy (though some episodes were known to contain the 2nd logo); currently, Syfy and Me-TV had acquired new, updated prints with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo.\n\nWas spotted on a Me-TV broadcast of the Gunsmoke episode \"P.S. Murry Christmas\", and can possibly be seen on episodes from the later seasons.\n\nIt was also intact on many Season 17 episodes of Gunsmoke on the UK CBS Channels.\n\nThis was also seen on at least one episode of Rawhide on H&I and the TV movie My Body, My Child on True Movies UK.\n\nThis variant also appeared on some Season 2 episodes of Matlock and some season 2 episodes of Father Dowling Mysteries when aired on CBS Justice (UK).\n\nProductions Variant:\n\nSeen on a few season 4 episodes of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Seasons 5 through 7 episodes of Diagnosis: Murder, among other Viacom productions at the time.\n\nInternational Variant:\n\nIt was present on syndicated and international prints (though some used the regular variant) of The Cosby Show and Roseanne, but it is now plastered with the Carsey-Werner Distribution logo, though some prints have survived, but not all of them.\n\nThe international version, and sometimes the regular variant, can be seen on some episodes of A Different World on Netflix, including the pilot, and was also seen on Terrytoon prints that were distributed around in the 1990s, as well as reportedly, one episode of The Beverly Hillbillies on the Fox Classics Network in Australia.\n\nLegacy: Another beloved logo by some for its CGI, music (especially on the International variant), and voice-over.\n\n10th Logo (September 24, 1999-August 8, 2004)\n\nVisuals: On a smoky blue background, the letters of \"VIACOM\", in a clear glass font, appear stacked on top of each other, with the \"V\" in front and the \"M\" in back. The letters then shrink and spread out to form the word as normally read. The background is revealed to have the letters of the word rapidly fading and blurring in and out. After \"VIACOM\" settles in, the text \"PRODUCTIONS}}\" (in Futura Extra Bold) appears from the mist and moves up to settle below the text. The byline \"a Paramount company\" (in the Paramount Pictures logo's font) fades in below that, with a line above that separates the two.\n\nVariants:\n\nA still version of this logo exists (a la the 1985 \"V of Happiness\" logo).\n\nStarting in 2002, the logo is slightly enhanced. The word \"VIACOM\" is made bolder and, when the letters are stacked, look brighter. In addition, the background is darker and has more contrast.\n\nSometimes on the 2002 version, \"in association with\" spreads out above.\n\nMultiple 16:9 variants (usually of the 2002 version) exist - one stretched from 4:3, one cropped to 16:9 (seen on widescreen movies and shows), and a native 16:9 version. The cropped version may also be zoomed out with borders (to account for the two aspect ratios).\n\nAnother 16:9 version exists wherein the 4:3 version is zoomed out without borders, thus causing the sides of the letters to copy themselves into three. This can be found on the French printing of the TV movie Finding John Christmas (entitled À la recherche de John Christmas).\n\nA shorter version cuts to either the first quarter or to the last.\n\nThere is a slower version.\n\nA filmed version appears on some TV movies.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio:\n\nSeptember 27, 1999-August 8, 2004: A descending crystallized wind chime-like sound effect culminating in a \"boom\" and a frantic synth-driven theme, with a robotic voice faintly saying the word \"Viacom\" after.\n\nThe 2002 enhanced version has the robotic voice sped up.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSeptember 30, 1999-May 11, 2000: Very early broadcasts featured the 1990 and 1998 network TV music. This can be seen on \"updated\" airings of season 7 episodes of Diagnosis: Murder on Me-TV and one season 4 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, \"The Wild, Wild Witch\".\n\nThere is also a silent variant.\n\nA version in which the wind chime sound effect plays faster also exists.\n\nA sped-up higher pitch version also exists.\n\nSometimes, it has the end theme of the show or TV movie or generic network music, as seen on NBC and CBS.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt can be seen on any show or TV movie produced by Viacom from 1999-2004; these include seasons 4-7 of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch on Antenna TV and Pluto TV (plastered on the DVD releases and on Paramount+ by the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo) and Fuse, The Division on Start TV, season 1 of The 4400 last aired on USA Network, and seasons 7 & 8 of Diagnosis: Murder on Me-TV, Decades (occasionally), Encore Suspense, DVD, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, as well as the final two TV movies spun off from that show (however, the DVD print of the last film \"Without Warning\" uses the CBS Television Distribution logo instead).\n\nThe still version can be seen on some season 8 and \"updated\" season 7 episodes of Diagnosis: Murder on Me-TV, Encore Suspense, Decades (occasionally), Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, DVD releases, and original CBS airings from 2000-2001.\n\nIt was also spotted at the end of several made-for-TV movies such as Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story, A Diva's Christmas Carol, Three Blind Mice, Bad Apple and Bang Bang, You're Dead, among others. It is unknown if it is preserved on VHS and/or DVDs of these respective films.\n\nIt was also seen with the Triage Entertainment logo on the Lifetime series Beyond Chance (starting with the fourth episode), which hasn't been reran for years.\n\nThe 2002 variant of this logo was also seen at the end of a July 8, 2023 UK airing of the 2004 TV movie The Legend of Butch & Sundance on LEGEND.\n\nLegacy: It's not a well-known logo like the previous ones, but it's considered another well-made logo with some really cool effects."
