        "text": "After having to postpone their traditional fall primetime TV lineups in 2023 due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, networks promised an even bigger 2024.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike ended in September 2023 after nearly five months, while the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) came to a tentative agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) that November.\n\nIn the wake of the strikes’ conclusion, ABC and CBS announced in early November 2023 that their 2024 TV schedules are packed with beloved series, including Grey’s Anatomy’s 20th season and the return of NCIS for season 21 and NCIS: Hawai’i for season 3.\n\nCBS pushed Kathy Bates’ new Matlock revival and Damon Wayans‘ Poppa’s House to the 2024-2025 TV season.\n\nABC, meanwhile, acquired Fox’s 9-1-1 in May 2023.
