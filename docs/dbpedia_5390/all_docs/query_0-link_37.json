        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Did Mighty Mouse snort cocaine or was the heroic TV rodent simply a victim of misinterpretation?\n\nAccuracy in Media said Monday CBS will remove a 3 -second segment of 'Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures,' because of pressure from media watchdog groups who said the cartoon depicted the mouse inhaling the substance up his nose. Criticscontend the sequence givesthe impression the mouse is snorting cocaine.\n\nReed Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Media, released a statement from CBS saying that producer Ralph Bakshi had asked that the footage be removed, although he insisted it had been 'the subject of misinterpretation.'\n\n'These 3.5 seconds of footage have been taken totally out of context by individuals who seem to be searching for sinister undertones in a cartoon that is absolutely innocent,' Bakshi said in the CBS statement.\n\nIn the statement, network officials defended the cartoon, saying there 'is nothing whatsoever improper' about the episode or the deleted fragment.\n\nBut Irvine said, 'Everybody I know thinks it depicts cocaine.'\n\nThe cartoon episode tells the story of Mighty Mouse and a young damsel-in-distress, Polly Pineblossom, who sells flowers and is menaced by an evil capitalist driving a limousine with dollar signs emblazoned on the doors.\n\nThroughout the cartoon, Polly spurns the flying mouse's aid, telling him there are 'others less fortunate than me,' which propels the super hero into other adventures.\n\nThe offending fragment occurs after Mighty Mouse has completed one of his heroic deeds and is sitting around a campfire with those he has rescued. One of the animals tells Mighty Mouse he joined the campfire group to 'help those less fortunate.'\n\n'I know someone else like that,' recalls the mouse, who earlier had bought a flower from Polly Pineblossom, and, reaching into his cape pulls a handful of a pink substance and inhales. Critics allege the substance is cocaine, defenders say it is nothing more than Polly's crushed flower petals."
