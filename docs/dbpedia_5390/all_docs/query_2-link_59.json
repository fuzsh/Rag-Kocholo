        "text": "Origins\n\nThe history of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) began in 1927 when talent agent Arthur Judson, unable to obtain work for any of his clients on the radio programs carried by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), established his own network, United Independent Broadcasters. Judson’s network subsequently merged with the Columbia Phonograph and Records Co. and changed its name to the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting Company. Plagued with mounting financial losses, the network was purchased for a modest $400,000 by William S. Paley, whose father owned the company that made La Palina cigars, one of the network’s principal advertisers. On January 18, 1929, the newly christened Columbia Broadcasting System signed on the air.\n\nUnder the direction of the enterprising Paley as the network’s longtime chairman, CBS made media history beginning in the late 1920s. Realizing that the key to radio success was large audiences that would attract advertisers, Paley offered programming free to affiliated stations in return for having a certain part of their schedules devoted to sponsored network shows. From 22 stations in 1928, the network grew to 114 stations in a decade. By 1932 it was posting an annual profit of $3 million. Although the most popular radio stars and programs of the 1930s and ’40s were heard over the rival National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network, CBS nonetheless maintained a huge audience, thanks largely to the dynamic leadership of Paley’s second in command, Frank Stanton, who served as president of CBS from 1946 to 1971. The network also built up a strong and influential news division under the guidance of Edward R. Murrow and his successors. And while it lagged behind the RCA Corporation-owned NBC technologically, CBS took a major step forward in the late 1940s with the development of long-playing records by its Columbia Records division. In 1938 CBS acquired the American Recording Corporation, which later became Columbia Records. Peter Goldmark of CBS laboratories invented high-fidelity long-playing records, and the Columbia record label introduced them to the public in 1948.\n\nThe presence of stars such as Phil Harris, Fred Allen, Bing Crosby, and Kate Smith on CBS swelled the network’s listenership. With the emergence of television during the 1940s, the appearance of performers became as important as their voices, and in 1948 Paley staged a talent raid of rival NBC, signing up stars such as Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (better known as Amos ’n’ Andy), Edgar Bergen, George Burns and Gracie Allen, and Jack Benny, who proved as popular on television as they had been on radio. As a result, CBS was able to make a smooth transition into the new medium, in which it consistently outrated its competition through the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nMoving to television\n\nDuring this period CBS Television enjoyed a reputation as the “Tiffany Network,” exhibiting high quality and sophistication in its dramatic programs (Studio One [1948–58]; Playhouse 90 [1956–61]) and variety series (notably The Ed Sullivan Show). Even so, the network earned some of its highest ratings with such rustic situation comedies as The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962–71), and Gomer Pyle, USMC (1964–69).\n\nDevelopments in the late 20th and early 21st centuries\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s CBS diversified into the production of books, magazines, musical instruments, and toys, but from 1985 to 1988 the company divested itself of all these other operations and also sold its highly successful record unit, which was bought by the Sony Corporation. Thenceforth, under the direction of Lawrence Tisch, who had been brought in in 1986 to prevent a hostile takeover by cable-TV mogul Ted Turner, CBS concentrated on the core of its operations—television and radio broadcasting. Although the new administration’s budgetary cutbacks caused the network to lose some of its standing in the industry, CBS scored a number of significant successes in the years that followed, notably the acquisition of talk-show host David Letterman, who hosted The Late Show from 1993 to 2015, and the debut of the pioneering “reality” television series Survivor (2000– ). For many years the only self-owned broadcasting network in the United States, CBS relinquished its independence in 1995 when, amid falling television ratings and a decline in the number and quality of affiliate stations, it was sold to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5.4 billion. This firm, which had once been one of the world’s largest makers of electrical equipment, converted itself in the 1990s into a media company through the purchase of CBS and other firms. To mark this transformation Westinghouse in 1997 dropped its own corporate name and assumed the name CBS Corporation. In the early 21st century CBS’s most valuable television property was its CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000–15) franchise—including the spin-offs CSI: Miami (2002–12), CSI: New York (2004–13), and CSI: Cyber (2015–16)—along with the related shows Cold Case (2003–10) and Without a Trace (2002–09)."
