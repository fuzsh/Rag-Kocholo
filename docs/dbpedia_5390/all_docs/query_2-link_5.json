        "text": "Background[]\n\nCBS Television Distribution was the syndication division of CBS Studios established on September 26, 2006 as a distribution subsidiary, after CBS Corporation merged CBS Paramount Domestic Television with King World Productions, CBS Paramount International Television (spun-off as \"CBS Studios International\", later \"ViacomCBS Global Distribution Group\", now \"Paramount Global Content Distribution\"), and CBS Home Entertainment. The merger wouldn't take effect on screen until September 2007, when the King World and CBS Paramount Domestic Television logos were retired in favor of this company's logo. However, Merv Griffin's Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune began using the logo in October 2007. It was renamed to CBS Media Ventures in 2021.\n\n(August 20, 2007-January 11, 2021)[]\n\nLogo: In a studio with blue lights all over, we see the words \"CBS TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" with \"CBS\" in the trademark Didot font and the Eyemark on its left side, \"TELEVISION\" and \"DISTRIBUTION\" in Helvetica next to it, and \"DISTRIBUTION\" below \"TELEVISION\", floating above a reflective ground (which ripples at the beginning, like water) in front of a wall with clouds projected on it. The camera zooms away from the logo until it's over.\n\nTrivia: On first-run series from the company, the logo is animated at 30 fps. However, when it plasters older logos on syndicated reruns and DVDs of some older shows, it is animated at 24 fps.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe longer variant shows the camera zooming away from the CBS Eyemark at the beginning, \"TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" zooms back in place, and then the camera moves away from the logo until it stops behind some black girders. As it zooms out, the \"S\" in \"CBS\" briefly shines. It was seen on the company's official website prior to the rebrand to CBS Media Ventures.\n\nA black & white version is used on B&W shows.\n\n2010-: Another variant starts off with the animation from the extended version, but is in warp speed.\n\nOn some first-run shows such as The Insider and Entertainment Tonight, the final scene or the end credits crossfade to the logo (sometimes its longer variant).\n\nSometimes, the logo fades out early.\n\nOn the 2013 revival of The Arsenio Hall Show, a copyright stamp for Eye Productions, Inc. appears below.\n\nOn a recent print of the second part of the two-part TV movie The Key to Rebecca, the logo is strangely squished.\n\nA short version exists on Hot Bench and some episodes of Inside Edition, only the finished product is seen.\n\nAnother short version exists on 2012-2021 episodes of Judge Judy where the zoom-out is almost over.\n\nOn a MeTV print of a Star Trek episode, there is a 1967 copyright at the bottom. Other Star Trek variants feature a 1968 Paramount/Norway copyright or a 1978 Paramount copyright.\n\nFull-screen, wide-screen and scope versions exist.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A beautiful 7-note string sounder, which sounds like a re-orchestration (and slight rearrangement) of the music in the CBS Paramount Network Television logo. The fourth note is accompanied by a beautiful beat, which is actually part of a timpani roll accompanying notes 1-4. This fanfare's composed by Gregory Smith. The following versions are commonly used:\n\nA short version exists where the theme has a faster pace.\n\nSometimes, the logo would have 6 (minus the first note) or all 7 notes. For the full 7-note version, the first note may be cut in half (on some first-run shows) or be heard in full (often heard on syndicated prints of shows produced by CBS Productions, CBS Paramount Television, and CBS Television Studios).\n\nThere is a longer version of the theme where there is a gap between the last two notes. This version has a cymbal on the fourth and sixth notes; the first one plays when the timpani stops.\n\nThe extended version has a brief brass/synth stinger before the longer version of the theme plays.\n\nSometimes, the end theme is used instead.\n\nSometimes, it can be silent.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn the revival of The Arsenio Hall Show, only the last 3 notes are used.\n\nOn Jeopardy!, you can still hear part of the 1999 King World thunderclap sound effect before the theme is playing, probably due to a plaster error. This is unofficially called the \"Ghost of the 1999 King World thunderclap\". However, on the first few episodes under this logo, the short 1999 King World thunderclap, and the first part of the long version of the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo music played, which continued to the short version of that said logo.\n\nOn MeTV's print (same as the DVD print) of the Hawaii Five-O episode \"Wednesday, Ladies Free,\" the 1987 Paramount Television music is used. This also happened again on Russian prints of various episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and the \"Sins of the Father\" episode on The Next Level Blu-ray, as well as the Friday the 13th: The Series episode \"Hate on Your Dial\" on the Season 3 DVD. (as the German print) and the 1988 series of the Mission: Impossible episode \"The Fixer\". Either occurrence is most likely due to a plastering error.\n\nA \"high-tone\" version of the short version jingle is on Acorn Media's DVD release of the mini-series Washington: Behind Closed Doors and on all PAL prints of shows.\n\nA double high-tone (very high-pitched) and slightly faster version of the short version jingle exists on a recent print of the two-part TV movie The Key to Rebecca.\n\nOne episode of The Love Boat had the 1988 Worldvision \"Whoosh Globe\" music playing over it instead due to a plaster error.\n\nA Spanish print of The Love Boat S2 episode \"Love Me, Love My Dog/Poor Little Rich Girl/The Decision\" has the 1988 Worldvision Enterprises theme in low-tone playing over this.\n\nOne episode of Gomer Pyle-USMC on MeTV and a Season 10 episode of Judge Joe Brown on The Roku Channel had the CBS Paramount Domestic Television \"Wallpaper\" music play over it instead due to a plaster error.\n\nA Russian print of Father Dowling Mysteries S1 EP3 has the Viacom 1990 \"Wigga-Wigga\" theme over this, continuing from the 1986 \"V of Steel\" logo; it's presumably due to the audio track being from a different source.\n\nOn a French print of the TV movie Perry Mason: The Case of the Murdered Madam, the warp-speed \"V of Steel\" theme plays over the logo due to a plastering error.\n\nOn a June 3, 2010 Encore Westerns airing of one episode of Rawhide, the 1990 Viacom \"Wigga-Wigga\" short music is heard due to bad plastering.\n\nOn an H&I print of one episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the theme is low toned.\n\nOn a MeTV airing of an episode of Laverne and Shirley, you can faintly hear the 1975 Paramount Television \"Blue Mountain\" logo music in the background due to a plaster error.\n\nOn the format sales presentations to The Brady Bunch and Becker, a triumphant, extended version of the 1st CBS Paramount Television logo is heard. Plus, you can also hear the first five notes of the CTD logo.\n\nOn a GetTV airing of Dan August, the CBS Television Studios/CBS Studios International logo music plays due to a plastering error.\n\nOn a Russian airing of Early Edition, the 3rd Sony Pictures Television International music was used in an attempt to plaster the 2003 SPTI logo.\n\nAvailability: No longer current, but still ultimately common.\n\nIt appeared on new episodes of shows that were originally produced and/or distributed by CBS Paramount Domestic Television and/or King World Productions, which are Judge Judy, Montel, Dr. Phil, Entertainment Tonight, The Insider, Judge Joe Brown, Jeopardy!, Wheel of Fortune, Rachael Ray, and Inside Edition.\n\nIt was also seen on new shows that the company produced from 2007 to 2021, such as The Doctors, Swift Justice with Nancy Grace, Excused, The Jeff Probst Show, the 2013 revival of The Arsenio Hall Show, The Test, Hot Bench, Face the Truth, DailyMailTV, and The Drew Barrymore Show.\n\nIt can also be seen on local reruns of Half & Half, One on One, and Maximum Exposure (the latter title to have followed after the Paramount Domestic Television logo of the time). This logo is also seen on Everybody Loves Raymond in local syndication, which plasters over the King World logo. However, it was preceded by the 2006 King World logo on some TV Land reruns. It was also seen on the remastered version of Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nThe extended version was seen on their website (without music) and on the final two seasons of Montel.\n\nIt can also be seen on syndicated reruns of CBS shows, such as the CSI franchise, and Everybody Loves Raymond.\n\nIt was also seen on airings of films made by CBS Films on networks like Showtime and Syfy.\n\nThe short version should be found on every remaining release of the original \"Five-O,\" from #4 to the end, along with most DVD releases of older CBS-owned programming from late April 2008 onward. Also seen until September 2011 on syndicated reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation in which this logo replaced the 1987 Paramount Television logo. This happened again on that said show's Next Level Blu-ray.\n\nThis logo also plasters over Viacom logos on Viacom-produced shows on DVD, including seasons 2-9 of Matlock, the Acorn Media DVD of the 1981 miniseries East of Eden, seasons 1-2 of Cannon, seasons 4-7 of Sabrina The Teenage Witch, seasons 1-2 of Jake & The Fatman, 4 out of 5 films on the VEI DVD release of The Diagnosis Murder Movie Collection, the made-for-TV Perry Mason movies, and the Kino Lorber DVDs of The Master among others. CBS Drama (UK) airings of Matlock also use this logo, as did a November 2017 MeTV airing (and possibly DVD and Blu-ray releases) of Return to Mayberry. However, this follows the \"V of Steel\" and \"Wigga-Wigga\" on the Father Dowling Mysteries DVDs and Decades airings, the \"Gold V of Happiness\" and \"Wigga-Wigga\" on the Kino Lorber DVD release of Really Weird Tales, and the \"V of Doom\" and \"Wigga-Wigga\" on seasons 3-5 DVDs of Cannon, and also follows the Children's Video Library logo on Hulu's print of Thanksgiving in the Land of Oz (which is the same as the DVD print).\n\nThis also plasters the Rysher Entertainment logo on Nash Bridges: The Fourth Season on DVD and on H&I airings.\n\nThis was seen on a 2019 reissue of the pilot movie of Walker, Texas Ranger on DVD.\n\nThe second season of Dave's World on DVD, the first and second seasons of Caroline in the City on DVD, getTV airings of The Kid Who Loved Christmas (with the 1989 Paramount Television logo before this logo), Start TV airings of the 1st 2 seasons of Early Edition, Decades airings of Matt Houston (with the 1984 Warner Bros. Television Distribution logo before or after this logo) Brooklyn Bridge (with the 1990 Paramount Television logo after this logo), MeTV airings of season 1 of Touched by an Angel and The (New) Twilight Zone, and all four seasons of Duckman on DVD, also used this logo.\n\nThis also made an unusual (for a television logo) theatrical appearance during Fathom Events' The Twilight Zone: A 60th Anniversary Celebration, a limited theatrical screening of six Twilight Zone episodes, which took place on November 14, 2019. This was due to using regular television prints for the screening."
