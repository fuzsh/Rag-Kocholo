The show was ranked the second-greatest animated TV show of all time by TV Guide. If that isn't an indication of its success, we don't know what is!\n\nFelix the Cat\n\nAired: 1953 â€“ 1961\n\nBudget: $10,000 per episode\n\nBefore Mickey Mouse and Disney stole his success, Felix the Cat was the first animated character to have the same admiration as movie stars. \"Felix the Cat\" was a part of the silent film era, the black and white cat is one of the most recognizable cartoons in history.\n\nPat Sullivan, along with lead animator, Otto Messmer, kept the show going from 1929 to 1930, and in 1953 Felix cartoons began airing on American television. Felix has since starred in other television programs and two feature films.\n\nMister Rogersâ€™ Neighborhood\n\nAired: 1968 â€“ 2001\n\nBudget: $45 million in total\n\n\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" is one of the most cherished shows of all time.

The sitcom aimed towards children had six seasons and 234 episodes and starred Barbara Billingsley, Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, and Hugh Beaumont.\n\nThe Cleavers represent \"The American Dream,\" the ideal version of a 1950s family, and centered around \"The Beaver.\" The adventurous boy seemed to always get into trouble, whether it be at home, school, or in the neighborhood.\n\nMighty Mouse Playhouse\n\nAired: 1955 â€“ 1967\n\nBudget: $50,000 per episode\n\n\"Mighty Mouse Playhouse\" was a collection of short films starring the animated character Mighty Mouse. CBS ran the show for a half-hour from 1955 until 1967, making the character much more popularized than ever before.\n\nThe low-budget animation company was sold to CBS when more and more companies left behind short films and moved towards television shows. \"Mighty Mouse\" had a total of an astounding eighty short films throughout its run!\n\nSpeed Racer\n\nAired: 1967 â€“ 1968\n\nBudget: $120,000 per episode\n\n\"Speed Racer\" got its start as a Japanese graphic novel, otherwise known as a manga. The show featured the adventures of an ambitious young pilot who became a professional racer. The Speed Racer, known in Japan as \"Mach GoGoGo,\" debuted in America in fall 1967 and was more contemporary animation.\n\nSome say the original episodes underwent minor editing to reach the form which aired in America while others say it underwent significant editing. Either way, the show was considered appropriate entertainment for the whole family.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You?\n\nAired: 1969 â€“ 1975\n\nBudget: $130,000 per episode\n\nOver the years, Scooby-Doo has become one of the most recognizable television characters of all time.

With all of the changes made to the show, the main cast's names remain the same!\n\nThe Electric Company\n\nAired: 1971 â€“ 1977\n\nBudget: $7 million in total\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous educational series for children, \"The Electric Company,\" had 780 episodes throughout six seasons.

Interestingly enough, it was sponsored by Kellogg's, the cereal company.\n\nThe show was made up of three segments, one featuring Huckleberry Hound, the second with Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, and last but not least, Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinx. As we know, the Yogi Bear sketch was trendy and ended up getting its own series.\n\nThe Archie Show\n\nAired: 1968 â€“ 1969\n\nBudget: Unknown\n\nBefore there was \"Riverdale,\" there was \"The Archie Show.\" The comedic sitcom was based on the comic strip called \"Archie Comics.\" The show featured the characters we know and love; Jughead, Archie Andrews, Veronica, Reggie Mantle, and Betty Cooper.\n\nThe fresh group of friends was part of a pop band, and their song \"Sugar, Sugar\" was a #1 hit in reach life. Though the show only had seventeen episodes, it would go on to spark movies, books, comic strips, and more!\n\nSpider-Woman\n\nAired: 1979- 1980\n\nBudget: $100,000 per episode\n\nVoiced by none of other than Joan Van Ark Spider-Woman was the female version of the Marvel Comics character, Spiderman. The television series based on the character aired in 1979 and ran for one season - a total of sixteen episodes.\n\nThe cartoon was very different from the comic book on which the show was based; for example, the show did not feature any dark elements. The reason for this was most likely that the television show was sanitized for a child audience.\n\nThe Mickey Mouse Club\n\nAired: 1955 â€“ 1996\n\nBudget: $50,000 per episode\n\n\"The Mickey Mouse Club\" was a variety of television show that aired for more than 40 years. The show aired intermittently and did not have a set schedule, with a total of fourteen seasons and 620 episodes.\n\nThe show was created by none other than Walt Disney and featured teenage performers who hadn't had prior acting experience.

In 1994 Universal Pictures release a family comedy by the same name.\n\nThe Gumby Show\n\nAired: 1955-68\n\nBudget: $2.8 million in total\n\nArt Clokey created the \"Gumby Show,\" and after he showed the pilot of the kids' show to an executive at NBC, he was asked to make a second pilot. That's when \"Gumby on the Moon\" was created.\n\nThe segment was a significant success on the \"Howdy Doody Show,\" and that's when Clokey was given a single season. The show featured claymation and ran from 1955 to 1968, though it is still well-known today. To this day, Gumby is one of the most famous examples of stop-motion claymation.\n\nThe Jackson 5ive\n\nAired: 1971-73\n\nBudget: $6.6 million in total\n\nAs you may have already guessed by the name, the show followed the lives of Jermaine, Marlon, Tito, Michael, and Jackie Jackson - The Jackson Five. The show was animated and was created for ABC by Jules Bass.\n\nThe band got their start in 1965, so they had been around for a few years before they got their own animated series. The famous five brothers were voiced by actors, though Diana Ross voiced herself, and like most 1970s Saturday morning series, \"The Jackson 5ive\" had an adult laugh track.\n\nThe Osmonds\n\nAired: 1972\n\nBudget: $40,000 per episode\n\nMuch like \"The Jackson 5ive,\" \"The Osmonds\" was an animated series based on the Osmond family. Though unlike The Jackson 5ive, the show was voiced by the brothers themselves. The show aired for a few months in 1972 and had seventeen episodes in total.\n\nThe show was an interesting one as it followed the Osmonds as they traveled around the world performing music. Each episode opened with the family in a new location.\n\nStar Trek: The Animated Series\n\nAired: 1973-74\n\nBudget: $100,000 per episode\n\n\"Star Trek: The Animated Series,\" followed the space adventures of the Starship Enterprise as it traveled through the intergalactic worlds.

Of course, that wasn't the last we saw of \"Star Trek.\"\n\nSchoolhouse Rock!\n\nAired: 1973-79\n\nBudget: $50,000 per episode\n\n\"Schoolhouse Rock!\" aired from 1973 until 2009. The series aired during ABC's Saturday-morning kids' shows and consisted of educational short musical films.\n\nThe show turned \"boring\" topics like science, history, economics, math, and grammar, into fun, in a way that didn't make kids feel like they were learning. \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" won an Emmy, there were 64 episodes in total airing new episodes and songs until 1979, and playing reruns all the way to 2009.\n\nLooney Tunes\n\nAired: 1930-1969\n\nBudget: $28 million in total\n\nYou're probably well aware that \"Looney Tunes\" is one of the most popular cartoon series of all time. The show had many versions, but the one that ran from 1930 to 1969 is considered the \"original\" series. It was a rivalry between Warner Bros. and Walt Disney that started it all.\n\nThe show began in the late twenties as a competition against Mickey Mouse shorts. Throughout time, \"Looney Tunes\" has expanded into amusement parks, video games, comic books, and toys!\n\nTop Cat\n\nAired: 1961-62\n\nBudget: $21,000 per episode\n\nAnother sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera, \"Top Cat,\" ran in the early sixties for a total of 30 episodes and one full season.

You weren't expecting that, now were you? The show featured a team of scientists on a mission along the Amazon River when their raft hits a rock.\n\nThe team capsizes and is swept down a whirlpool only to find that when they resurface, they're in a realm in which humans live alongside dinosaurs, prehistoric creatures, and neanderthals. The series ran for thirty minutes, and unfortunately, there were only sixteen episodes in total. This is a show we'd love to see make a comeback!\n\nCool McCool\n\nAired: 1966-67\n\nBudget: $15,000 per episode\n\nFrom the man who brought you \"Batman,\" we introduce to you \"Cool McCool.\" The show created by Bob Kane, the show followed a spy who defeated villains even though he wasn't a good detective.\n\n\"Cool McCool\" had a satirical spin to it as it was poking fun at James Bond, which was very popular at the time. NBC was the original airing network, and the show ran from 1966 to 1967.\n\nCommander McBragg\n\nAired: 1963-73\n\nBudget: $500 per episode\n\nVoiced by veteran voice actor, Kenny Delmar, Commander McBragg was a character based on the stories from \"The Four Feathers,\" \"Another Thin Man,\" and \"Baron Munchausen.\" The show followed a retired British military commander, McBragg, who would tell stories to his gentleman's club.\n\nThese stories would only last a minute and a half, hence the low budget. The episodes aired for a decade; they were mainly featured on \"Tennessee Tuxedo and his Tales.\"\n\nThe Funky Phantom\n\nAired: 1971-72\n\nBudget: $50,000 per episode\n\nWhat most would claim is the Australian version of \"Scooby-Doo,\" next up we have \"The Funky Phantom.\" In total, there were seventeen episodes of \"The Funky Phantom,\" which aired on a subsidiary of ABC, Air Programs International.\n\nThe show featured three teen detectives who drove around the country, solving crimes and mysteries. Scooby-Doo's role was swapped out by a ghost from the Revolutionary War era.

The Vulture Squadronâ€™s primary goal is to trap Yankee Doodle Pigeon and prevent him from delivering paper messages to the other side of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe show repeated the phrase \"stop the pigeon,\" or \"catch the pigeon\" so many times, it was often mistaken as the title of the show!\n\nMilton the Monster\n\nAired: 1965-68\n\nBudget: $30,000 per episode\n\n\"Milton the Monster\" features the adventures of Milton, a monster with a Frankenstein-like head that releases steam or smoke depending on what mood he's in. Milton was created by Professor Weirdo, who also created a ghoul named Heebie and a cyclops named Jeebie.\n\nWhile creating Milton, Professor Weirdo used too much \"tenderness tincture,\" which makes him the opposite of mean; in fact, the monster is quite friendly. The series had one season and a total of twenty-six episodes.\n\nSabrina and the Groovie Goolies\n\nAired: 1972-73\n\nBudget: $20,000 per episode\n\n\"Groovie Goolies\" was set in the same realm as \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,\" and \"The Archie Show,\" which made for an exciting twist every time the groups crossed paths. \"Sabrina\" was a spinoff of the original show, \"Groovie Goolies,\" a show about monsters that lived in a decrepit castle.\n\nAfter they were canceled as a lone show, they were featured in eight \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" episodes during the shows 1972 season.\n\nThe Beagles\n\nAired: 1966-67\n\nBudget: $10,000 per episode\n\nThe show aired on CBS and ABC and was originally black and white but was telecast in colors in its later episodes! \"The Beagles\" featured a duo of pups who parodied, The Beatles. \"The Beagles\" followed the adventures of the band during their troubles and triumphs on the road.\n\nAmerican audiences will remember it from Saturday mornings on ABC or CBS while the show was featured on Channel 9 in Australia throughout the seventies.\n\nThe Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show\n\nAired: 1972\n\nBudget: $65,000 per episode\n\nA spinoff of the ever-so-famous \"The Flinstones,\" \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show,\" featured two of the youngest members of the Flinstones family. Now that they've grown up, they're facing all the challenges of being a teenager at Bedrock High School.\n\nThe show also featured a Bedrock Band, leading some critics to believe that the show had a lot in common with Archie. The show aired on CBS and was canceled after one season, which is surprising considering how long the original \"The Flinstones\" aired.\n\nShazzan\n\nAired: 1967-69\n\nBudget: $10,000 per episode\n\nYes, you read that right; it's \"Shazzan,\" not the superhero show, \"Shazam!\" The two shows have different premises, \"Shazzan\" features the adventures of two teen siblings, Chuck and Nancy, who use the help of a genie named, Shazzan, to help them face uncertainties and dangers as they travel around the world.\n\nCreated by Alex Toth, the show aired on CBS from 1967 to 1968. Though the show had a great storyline, it aired for a lone season, eight half-hour episodes that were made up of two 11-minute segments.\n\nBatman\n\nAired: 1966â€“1968\n\nBudget: $100,000 per episode\n\n\"Batman\" was an adaptation from the DC comic book character, and this sixties show was one of the first live-action adaptations of the superhero! Though we may be used to a particular persona Batman portrays, this show was different from the action depictions of the superhero we know today.\n\nThe show had upbeat theme music, simplistic mortality, and humorous storylines. The show's creator, William Dozier, described the show was the only sitcom that didn't have a laugh track.\n\nThe Magical World of Disney\n\nAired: 1954â€“1991\n\nBudget: $6,000 per episode\n\nAs you know, Disney's had its fair share of iterations over the years, \"The Magical World of Disney\" was the first. The show began airing in 1954 and contained cartoons of all your classic favorites, Donald Duck, Bambi, and more.\n\nABC aired the program first on Friday nights and then on Sunday nights - where it had its greatest success. Since the network favorited it, it became a staple of ABC's Sunday night lineup for more than twenty years.\n\nAnnie Oakley\n\nAired: 1954â€“1957\n\nBudget: $10,000 per episode\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous sharpshooters of the wild, wild west, Annie Oakley has had books, movies, and of course, television shows based on her life. \"Annie Oakley\" featured Gail Davis in the title role, wearing the same fringed cowgirl outfit in every episode.\n\nThe show reportedly made over fifteen copies of the look for the production. The show had eighty-one episodes, all in black and white, and allegedly had minimal resemblance to Annie's actual life.\n\nDennis the Menace\n\nAired: 1959â€“1963\n\nBudget: $30,000 per episode\n\n\"Dennis the Menace\" starred Dennis, the Mitchell family's mischievous son who often went back and forth with their neighbor, George Wilson.

Season one of the comedy-mystery show was made up of short animated episodes created by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. The shorts came out after the live-action movies that were released in the sixties.\n\nThe first \"The Pink Panther Show\" episode featured two Panther cartoons and one Inspector cartoon. The show made history by becoming NBC's first production to have a fitted laugh track for broadcast television.\n\nThe Addams Family\n\nAired: 1973\n\nBudget: $50,000 per episode\n\n\"The Addams Family\" has had its fair share of televisions series and movies, with the first airing in 1964. The 1973 version of \"The Addams Family\" aired nearly ten years later in 1973 and was broadcast on NBC's Saturday mornings.\n\nThe show took the Addams family on tour in a Victorian-style RV - weird even for the Addams family, right?! One of the most intriguing facts about this reboot is that it featured a ten-year-old Jodie Foster.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood\n\nAired: 1955â€“1960\n\nBudget: $20,000 per episode\n\n\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was a black-and-white television show that aired on BBC and consisted of 143 episodes that starred Richard Greene as the legendary outlaw.\n\nThe show consisted of a few dramatized tales from the books, but most of the show's storylines were new and created by the show's writers and producers.
