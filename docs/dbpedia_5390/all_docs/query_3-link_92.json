        "text": "Logitech on Wednesday denied reports that the company is working on a \"forever mouse\" that could come with a subscription fee for regular software updates, after comments by its CEO suggesting it could introduce such a product in the future received immediate backlash.\n\n\"There are no plans for a subscription mouse,\" said Logitech communications head Nicole Kenyon in a statement given to several media publications. Kenyon was responding to reports based on comments made by Logitech chief Hanneke Faber on The Verge's Decoder podcast with Nilay Patel.\n\nDuring the podcast, Faber said that the Logitech innovation center team in Ireland showed her a \"forever mouse\" that is designed to be used for many years. It's a \"little heavier\" than a standard mouse, and it has \"great software and services\" that get constantly updated.\n\nPatel asked Faber if she could \"envision a subscription mouse,\" to which she responded \"possibly.\" Faber went on to explain that customers would \"never have to worry about [their mice] again,\" which is similar to Logitech's video conferencing services.\n\nWhen asked whether Logitech had some other model for monetization than subscription fees or advertising, Faber said no, and that she was \"intrigued\" by a forever mouse that has an accompanying business model around software updates.\n\nKenyon sought to downplay the comments, saying: \"The mouse mentioned is not an actual or planned product but a peek into provocative internal thinking on future possibilities for more sustainable consumer electronics.\"\n\nArticle Link: Logitech Says It Has No Plans for a Subscription-Based 'Forever Mouse'\n\nIf you take the time to actually listen to the podcast you will find that it is actually the podcaster Nilay Patel that puts the idea of a subscription mouse into the head of Logitech's chief Hanneke Faber which she then run's with. At no point in that podcast do you hear Faber being the first one to suggest forever mouse subscription. Patel is the one that does it and then you can hear Faber just goes with the flow saying she thinks it's a good idea, an idea put into her head by Patel.\n\nTherefore there needs to be very clear reporting on this because at no point did Faber make the suggestion of a subscription model for a forever mouse, that suggestion originated from podcaster Nilay Patel. Faber just happened to agree with him.\n\nThe post from MR just shows how Faber's comments on the forever mouse have been distorted by the media.\n\nwild that people didn‚Äôt read the clear overtone of this being a hypothetical, one-off idea in the original interview. people really bitched and moaned so much about an obvious hypothetical that they had to come out like ‚Äúhey, just so you know, this was a hypothetical!‚Äù\n\nthat being said. corporations lie all the time, so if they do end up making a \"\"\"forever mouse,\"\"\" yall go ahead and boycott Logitech as you wish‚ÄîI‚Äôll join in bc I don‚Äôt look to them for products to begin with ü§†\n\nI just can‚Äôt comprehend what ongoing software updates would be useful for mice in the first place!\n\nMy mouse and keyboard uses something called Logi Options+, but it is not really that important, just tell me how much life I have left battery wise and configure keys and buttons, but it is not running all the time,, the other thing is logibolt app, which just allows me to add devices to the dongle . but i would not pay a subscription for it."
