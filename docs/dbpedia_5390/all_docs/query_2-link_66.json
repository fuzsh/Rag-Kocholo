        "text": "Definitely BBC for Dynasty.\n\nI can't remember the ins and outs, but I remember there was a huge fuss and comotion when ITV tried to snatch the rights to Dallas away from the BBC. I could be wrong but IIRC there were some episodes released on VHS which I think hadn't been shown on UK television at the time and I remember going to my local video rental place to rent them.\n\n1\n\nDynasty was on BBC1. So was Dallas. Thames put a bid in the late 80s to try and take Dallas to ITV but pulled there bid and it remained on the BBC until the show was originally cancelled\n\nIf I remember right the final 2 seasons of Dallas was moved to a late Sunday afternoon slot on BBC1.\n\nDarren\n\n0\n\nIt was strange that the BBC had all of the 80's big Soaps, Dallas, Dynasty, The Colbys, Knots Landing and Flamingo Road and ITV only had Falcon Crest that was no where near as popular as any of the BBC shows when you would have thought ITV would have been the home of the big Soaps.\n\n0"
