        "text": "Exactly one year after the start of the 2023 writers strike left TV Town pulling out its collective hair trying to figure out what to put on the air, CBS announced its schedule for the 2024 fall TV season, and it's back to business, baby.\n\nCBS appears to be giving its shows a little cushion anyway, as the network is scheduling its big premiere week to start Sunday, Oct. 13. (For comparison, back in 2022 — the last \"normal\" fall TV season — CBS premiered all its big shows starting Sept. 19.) The most-watched broadcast show of the season (with help from the cushy post-Super Bowl premiere slot), Justin Hartley's Tracker, kicks off CBS's fall season in a new time slot on Sunday, Oct. 13, inching up an hour to anchor the evening and lead into a new season of The Equalizer at 9/8c starting Oct. 20. (Previously, Tracker and The Equalizer were scheduled to return on Oct. 27.) Come midseason, they will be joined by new series Watson, a reimagining of Sherlock Holmes' partner, starring Morris Chestnut.\n\nMondays will be NCIS night, with the original NCIS paired with the new prequel series NCIS: Origins (here's everything we know about NCIS: Origins), which tells the story of a young Leroy Jethro Gibbs. Tuesdays belong to the FBI franchise, with FBI, FBI: Most Wanted, and FBI: International all airing back to back to back. Survivor anchors Wednesday nights once again, and it will be joined by the new mountaineering competition The Summit.\n\nMore fall TV schedules:\n\nABC 2024-2025 fall TV schedule\n\nNBC 2024-2025 TV schedule\n\nFox 2024-2025 fall TV schedule\n\nThe CW 2024-2025 fall TV schedule\n\nFX 2024 fall TV schedule\n\nNew fall TV shows\n\nYoung Sheldon may be ending, but the spin-off Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage keeps The Big Bang Theory prequel's vibes going at 8/7c on Thursdays, followed by a new season of Ghosts, Kathy Bates' new series Matlock, and Season 2 of Elsbeth. S.W.A.T., Fire Country, and the final season of Blue Bloods hold down Friday nights, with the NCIS: Sydney taking over for Blue Bloods at midseason.\n\nRenewed CBS TV shows returning in fall 2024\n\n48 Hours, 60 Minutes, Blue Bloods, The Equalizer, FBI, FBI: International, FBI: Most Wanted, Fire Country, Ghosts, NCIS, The Neighborhood, Survivor, S.W.A.T.\n\nRenewed CBS TV shows returning midseason\n\nNCIS: Sydney\n\nNew CBS TV shows for the 2024-2025 season\n\nGeorgie & Mandy's First Marriage, Matlock, NCIS: Origins, Poppa's House, The Summit, Watson\n\nCanceled CBS TV shows that won't be back\n\nBob Hearts Abishola, CSI: Vegas, Loteria Loca, NCIS: Hawai'i, So Help Me Todd, Young Sheldon\n\nSummer TV schedules:\n\nABC 2024 summer TV schedule\n\nNBC 2024 summer TV schedule\n\nCBS 2024 summer TV schedule\n\nFox 2024 summer TV schedule\n\nCheck out the full CBS fall TV schedule below.
