        "text": "(Check out my previous Ralph Bakshi review here: Fire and Ice)\n\nFrom 1983 to 1987, Ralph Bakshi had no luck getting any project off of the ground. Too many studios had seemingly lost money on his films, despite many making money as well. Besides, none of his current projects interested in studio execs enough for them to take a chance on it. Since 1981 on American Pop, Bakshi had been working alongside an interesting young animator with a ton of ambition named John Kricfalusi. He had developed a group of characters into an Underground Comix type screenplay called Ren and Stimpy, and the two directors had optioned this project to execs of TV studios alongside Bakshi projects during this time, as well, and again to no avail.\n\nFinally, in 1987, after offering up every project they had developed conceptually to the network heads at CBS, and being turned down for every single one, an exec asked what other projects they could potentially develop. Bakshi decided, seemingly on a whim, to mention a potential new adaptation of an old Terry Toons serial he had worked on, before becoming an independent animator, entitled Mighty Mouse. He told the execs that he had acquired the rights to the franchise, which was a blatant lie as Bakshi had no clue who owned the rights and certainly had not acquired the himself.\n\nThe network, sensing profitability in the reboot of a classic series directed and produced by one of America’s most iconic living animators, immediately greenlit Bakshi’s suggestion and hired him and his team to develop the property into a two season series of 19 episode, which were comprised of a total of 48 segments. To his supreme luck, when Terrytoons had folded, CBS actually bought out the rights to their works and had all of the old material and paperwork sitting in a vault somewhere. The execs who greenlit his proposed project didn’t even know that they themselves owned the rights and hence took Bakshi’s ploy hook, line, and sinker. Bakshi’s next move was to find out for himself who owned the rights. And when he realized the irony of the situation, he and Kricfalusi must have had a few laughs over the whole thing. Bakshi simply asked CBS’s copyright department for the rights to the property and was given them for nothing.\n\nIn the lore surrounding Ralph Bakshi, it is often assumed that this new adaptation of Mighty Mouse was also directed by him. However, he merely served as a creative consultant in the early stages of the project’s creation and produced the series in an executive role, though he ceded most of the work to four units of animators, each headed by a different young director who had either worked with him on projects in the past or came highly recommended by Kricfalusi. These four men included Kricfalusi himself, Eddie Fitzgerald, Steve Gordon (The Lord of the Rings, American Pop, Hey Good Lookin’, Fire and Ice), and Bruce Woodside (The Lord of the Rings, Fire and Ice). And ultimately, if any creative force was the auteur behind the project, it was Kricfalusi, who gathered the team, worked as an animator, a coordinator, a director, a character designer, and the head writer of the series, which catapulted him to fame in the nineties and placed his name forever at the front guard of that decade’s wave of animators in the creator-driven animation renaissance.\n\nThe series was wildly popular for the network and promised to give Bakshi the opportunity to work on many more projects in the coming years as all producers really care about is the success of your last work. It was zany, wacky, quirky, and weird in a way that few animations before it ever had been, and prefigured the TV animation paradigm of the next twenty years, influencing it and likewise making it possible for shows like Ren and Stimpy, The Animaniacs, Cow and Chicken, and even Futurama to air air on network television.\n\nWhile the show certainly did give other animators many chances to create bolder, more daring, more surreal, and even more true to life animation in the coming decades, it had the opposite effect for Ralph Bakshi himself. In mid-1988, the American Family Association, or AFA, came down against Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures for supposedly promoting drug use. In one episode, titled ‘The Little Tramp,’ a flower is destroyed by the endlessly spinning wheels of industrialism and capitalist excess. Might Mouse, in a break from his battles with this monstrous beast of a foe, finds the flower, which signifies to him the loss of spirit in human workers these forces promote, or at least necessitate through their operations. He mourns the loss of the crushed flower and in the process of crying over it, he sniffs the flower and accidentally snorts it, thereby making it part of himself, absorbing the chaotic potential of nature’s loss and devastation, the revolutionary potential of hatred of the proletariat for the bourgeois modes of economic expansionism that do so through vampirisim of their worker’s productivity.\n\nThe AFA said this portion of the episode was meant to promote snorting coke, which was ludicrous. But so many newspapers and media outlets picked up the story that it became a signifier for doing coke, and as such, Bakshi pulled the short segment of the scene from future airings. The AFA took this as an implicit recognition of guilt and de facto admission to the inclusion of revolting content into his cartoons. And despite the series being critically acclaimed and much-beloved by viewers, CBS cancelled the series in 1988. The result of this action was to make Bakshi, once again, a pariah to mainstream studios. And even though Kricfalusi was ultimately in charge of the greenlighting the segment, and Bakshi had warned against its inclusion even before it was aired, he, and not Kricfalusi, took the hit.\n\nBakshi never again was given the opportunity to create a theatrically-released fully-animated film. Instead, for the rest of his career, he dabbled in live-action/animation cross-overs, in TV films, and in short works for TV series, usually as a one-off director on someone else’s series. But Bakshi was never one to compromise his vision if he could help it. And as such, there are a few more artistic successes in his career past this point, which are worth going into detail about, and which I will be alerting a, hopefully, interested audience to in the coming weeks before moving along to review the short film career of Le Quebecois animation director Frederic Back.\n\nCody Ward"
