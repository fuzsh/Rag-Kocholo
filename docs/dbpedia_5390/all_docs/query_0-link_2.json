        "text": "Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures is an American animated television series. It is a revival of the Mighty Mouse cartoon character. Produced by Bakshi-Hyde Ventures (a joint venture of animator Ralph Bakshi and producer John W. Hyde) and Terrytoons, it aired on CBS on Saturday mornings from fall 1987 through the 1988–89 season. It was briefly rerun on Saturday mornings on Fox Kids in November 1992.\n\nThe quality of Mighty Mouse as compared with other 1980s animated television series is considered by animation historian Jerry Beck to \"foreshadow the higher quality [animation] boom coming in the next decade.\" It was one of the first Saturday morning cartoons on CBS to be broadcast in stereo.\n\nControversy[]\n\nThe show's content sometimes crossed into controversial territory. In \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\", it is hinted that peripheral male characters Gandy Goose and Sour Puss are showering together, and — in a dream sequence — that Pearl Pureheart has a lovechild with Mighty Mouse's unhinged nemesis the Cow.\n\nDuring the production of the episode \"The Littlest Tramp\", editor Tom Klein expressed concern that a sequence showing Mighty Mouse sniffing the remains of a crushed flower resembled cocaine use. Bakshi did not initially view the footage; he believed that Klein was overreacting, but agreed to let him cut the scene. Kricfalusi expressed disbelief over the cut, insisting that the action was harmless and that the sequence should be restored. Following Kricfalusi's advice, Bakshi told Klein to restore the scene, which had been approved by network executives and the CBS Standards and Practices department. The episode aired on October 31, 1987, initially without controversy.\n\nOn June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association (AFA), alleged that \"The Littlest Tramp\" depicted cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. Concerning Bakshi's involvement with Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, the AFA claimed that CBS \"intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then allowed him to insert a scene in which the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine.\" Bakshi responded, \"You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm not going to get into who sniffs what. This is lunacy!\"\n\nBakshi defended the episode, saying, \"I despise drugs. I would be out of my mind to show a cartoon character snorting cocaine in a cartoon\", and stating that Wildmon had interpreted the scene out of context. \"Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly. But even if you're right, their accusations become part of the air we breathe. That's why I cut the scene. I can't have children wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine.\" On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage.\n\nWildmon claimed that the edits were \"a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine\". Bakshi agreed to the removal of the offending 3½ seconds from future airings of the episode because of his concern that the controversy might lead children to believe that what Wildmon was saying was true. Wildmon's group then demanded the removal of Bakshi but, on July 25, 1988, CBS released a statement in support of him."
