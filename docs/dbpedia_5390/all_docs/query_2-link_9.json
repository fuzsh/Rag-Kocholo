For its current incarnation, see CBS Studios.\n\nBackground\n\nCBS Productions was the production arm of the CBS Television Network, formed in 1952 to produce shows in-house, instead of relying solely on outside productions. Its first production was CBS Television Workshop, a drama anthology series that featured an early appearance of Audrey Hepburn. Before 1978, it was simply known as the \"CBS Television Network\". From 1978-1996, the name \"CBS Entertainment Productions\" co-existed.\n\nFrom September 2004 to 2006, it functioned as an in-name-only unit of Paramount Television, but its logo remained on-screen until 2006. On January 17, 2006, it was merged with Paramount Television to form \"CBS Paramount Television\", whose main production division, CBS Paramount Network Television, continued to produce the former CBS Productions shows that were still running. Currently, all of the CBS library except certain shows they merely held rights to, is owned by Paramount Global themselves and is distributed by CBS Media Ventures. However, CBS has certain domestic or international rights on co-produced series.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, CBS Productions was revived as an in-name-only unit of CBS Paramount Network Television (later known as \"CBS Television Studios\") by producing non-CBS network produced programs such as 90210 for The CW. On October 8, 2020, as part of a brand unification of all of the CBS divisions, CBS Productions was folded into the then-newly renamed CBS Studios.\n\nHistorical Note: The CBS logo was created by William Golden and Kurt Weiss on October 17, 1951 and was introduced on broadcast on October 20, 1951.\n\nCBS Television Network\n\n1st Logo (January 13, 1952-March 6, 1968)\n\nVisuals: Over a white background, the logo starts with CBS' huge Eyemark logo, with a second Eyemark replacing its pupil. As the camera zooms in on the second Eyemark's pupil, it opens up like a camera shutter to reveal the words \"CBS TELEVISION NETWORK\" in the Didot font. The pupil later closes.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the TV movie Destination Space, the text \"In Association with the\" is seen first, before it fades out and the rest of the animation takes place.\n\nSometimes, the pupil remains open for a longer time than usual, or the logo fades out before the pupil closes.\n\nOn the TV special Stars in the Eye, after the pupil closes, the word \"Presents\" appears with superimposed footage of fireworks behind it, which transitions into the intro.\n\nThere exists a color variant, with the background being an off-white color and the Eyemark and shutter being a shade of brown.\n\nA variant exists where the 2nd eyemark’s pupil is replaced with a decorated keychain one, and the chains reveal the text and then close after a few seconds.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation. Designed by William Golden and animated by Kurt Weiss.\n\nAudio: Usually none, particularly on modern prints.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn current prints of Perry Mason season 3 episode 1, the logo uses a version of the generic CBS theme from the era.\n\nIn other cases, it included a male announcer saying \"This is the CBS Television Network\" or simply \"This is CBS\", or the opening/closing theme of the show.\n\nOccasionally, voice actors (including Hal Simms) doing promotional announcements regarding upcoming programming accompanied this card. \"See/Watch (NAME OF SHOW) on most of these (same) stations.\"\n\nAvailability: This logo was the standard closing card for the CBS network and appeared mostly on filmed series produced for CBS.\n\nThis logo appeared on Perry Mason, Gunsmoke, and Rawhide, among other shows.\n\nIt is intact on every show released on DVD that CBS produced during this period (except for The Honeymooners, as the prints were sourced from syndication airings of the show).\n\nThis is also seen on some newer TV prints of Perry Mason, Rawhide, and pre-fall 1965 episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, which started in early 2009, followed by the silent 2003 Paramount Domestic Television logo on said show, and on more than one occasion, the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo.\n\nThe variant with the CBS theme can be seen on season 3 episode 1 of Perry Mason on IMDb TV and CBS Drama/Justice UK (now RealityXtra) airings.\n\nThis logo also made an appearance following the 1965 20th Century Fox Television logo on the S2 Blu-ray release of Lost in Space, despite the latter series airing in color by 1966.\n\n2nd Logo (In-credit variants) (January 13, 1952-May 28, 1985, 1987-1988)\n\nVisuals: CBS Productions only used different on-screen versions of the following in-credit text with the CBS Eyemark logo below it, taking place against a blue background:\n\nA\n\nCBS TELEVISION NETWORK\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nDepending on the series, the text could read \"PRODUCED BY THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK\", \"THIS HAS BEEN A CBS TELEVISION NETWORK PRODUCTION\", \"(PRODUCED) IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK\", or \"A CBS TELEVISION NETWORK PRESENTATION\".\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the Eyemark is omitted.\n\n1959-1962: The text appears on a Eyemark wallpaper background.\n\n1962-1965: The text appears on a gray background with the N.A.B. \"Seal of Good Practice\" or \"Television Code\" logo.\n\n1962-1964: On early seasons of Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies, the \"IAW\" variant fades after the 1961 Filmways logo.\n\n1962-1966: The logo is in grayscale.\n\n1963-1975: The text appears on a blue background with a black CBS Eyemark at the lower left corner and the text \"FILMED AT CBS STUDIO CENTER, STUDIO CITY, CALIFORNIA\" next to the Eyemark.\n\n1964-1965: The notice is shown on the lower right-hand corner on the Filmways logo.\n\n1965-1969: On The Wild Wild West, there is an additional in-credit name for Michael Garrison on a grayscale background (season 1 only), blue background (subsequent seasons) reading \"A MICHAEL GARRISON PRODUCTION\" before that logo faded to the \"IAW THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK PRODUCTION\" logo.\n\n1968-1970: On shows from Talent Associates, the Eyemark appears at the center, sandwiched between the respective in-credit text.\n\nThe Eyemark is either black or white.\n\nOn some episodes of My Three Sons, this logo is sometimes seen in a completely different font.\n\nOn the Dr. Seuss TV specials from 1971-1975, such as The Cat in the Hat, the logo is just text, in this format:\n\nthis has been a\n\nCBS\n\nTELEVISION NETWORK\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nin association with\n\nThen, it cuts to the DePatie-Freleng Enterprises logo.\n\nTechnique: A still graphic.\n\nAudio: The end title theme from any show playing.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn some shows from 1959-1962, a majestic 4 note tune (sometimes with a drum roll) or a custom fanfare for each show (Rawhide used a 10-note fanfare, of which the first 6 notes were from the beginning of the Rawhide theme; The Twilight Zone used a 13-note fanfare; Perry Mason used a 5-note fanfare with a drum roll) plays instead.\n\nIt appears on the Film Score Rundowns channel and the UCLA collection, all of these fanfares have a nickname called \"The CBS Eye\" and were composed by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt appears on The Twilight Zone, Perry Mason, Rawhide, Gunsmoke, Get Smart, Gilligan's Island, the original Hawaii Five-O, and Have Gun, Will Travel, among other key shows.\n\nThis was also seen on The Wild Wild West, as well as the 1965-1972 episodes of My Three Sons.\n\nThe Filmways shared version appears on 1962-1965 episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nIts last use was on the 1985 TV movie Brotherly Love.\n\n3rd Logo (April 21, 1963?-1967)\n\nVisuals: There is a black Eyemark zooming out to the top of the screen on a gray background. \"CBS\" appears letter-by-letter in a dramatic fashion in white.\n\nTrivia: A color variant has been rumored to exist, but it is not yet known whether the rumor is true; the only alleged recording to have been uploaded online is considered fake, as it was done via color correction in Sony Vegas Pro 11.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: A commanding trumpet which sounds a little like the theme tune to Superman: The Animated Series. The fanfare was rumored to be composed by Morton Stevens.\n\nAudio Variant: On Western Hero, the logo is silent.\n\nAvailability: This logo was another standard closing card for the CBS network and appeared mostly on filmed series produced for CBS.\n\nIt was seen on original network airings of Hogan's Heroes, Pistols 'N' Petticoats, Hazel, Lassie, My Favorite Martian, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Lucy Show, The Andy Griffith Show, Captain Kangaroo, Password, Art Linkletter's House Party, The Red Skeleton Hour, The Jackie Gleason Show, To Tell the Truth, What's My Line?, I've Got a Secret, Mission: Impossible, Gunsmoke, and The Gary Moore Show, among other shows.\n\nIt was also seen on the original 1965 broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas and quite possibly How The Grinch Stole Christmas!.\n\nCBS Productions (first era)\n\n1st Logo (1983-1985)\n\nVisuals: It's the same as the 1983 CBS Theatrical Films logo, but \"THEATRICAL FILMS\" is replaced by \"PRODUCTIONS\".\n\nClosing Variant: The logo is still and \"IN ASSOCIATION WITH\" is added above the logo.\n\nTechnique: Same as the 1983 CBS Theatrical Films logo.

I Luv U, and made its final appearance on the September 6, 1996 edition of The Gordon Elliott Show.\n\nSeen on post-season 2 episodes of Evening Shade, seasons 1-3 of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, CBS Soap Break, the first two seasons of The Gordon Elliott Show, and seasons 3-6 of Rescue 911, among others.\n\nIt was also seen on the Caroline in the City episode \"The Pilot\", on some prints.\n\nIt is still intact on DVD prints of the first two seasons of Walker, Texas Ranger (also intact on H&I and Peacock), the first three seasons of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, and the final two Gunsmoke TV movies: The Long Ride (1993) and One Man's Justice (1994), as well as the first season of Touched by an Angel.\n\nHowever, the DVD releases of the first two seasons of Caroline in the City, and the second season of Dave's World both plaster this logo with the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo instead.\n\nThe in-credit version was seen on the game show The Hollywood Game.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of the Family Home Entertainment and Golden Books Family Entertainment VHS releases of Frosty Returns (however, it is plastered by the 1997 logo on current CBS airings and the Classic Media logo on the Frosty The Snowman DVD release in which this special is included).\n\nCBS Productions (second era)\n\n1st Logo (September 13, 1995-1998)\n\nVisuals: Over a textured yellow or gold CBS Eyemark background, there is a pair of ghostly gray hands holding up a gray CBS eye logo. The logo then fades to a closer shot of the hands holding the logo, with the text \"CBS PRODUCTIONS\" in a Futura font and with \"CBS\" in a bigger font, along with a CBS Eyemark below, in front of them.\n\nTrivia: This logo was based on the CBS 1995-96 on-air identity, \"You're on CBS\".\n\nVariant: Sometimes, the hands holding up the CBS eye logo are omitted, so there is only the text on the textured yellow background.\n\nTechnique: Live-action.\n\nAudio: A haunted theme with a thud sound, none, a generic theme on NBC and CBS, or just the end title theme playing over the logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt appeared on such shows like seasons 3 and 4 of Walker, Texas Ranger, the first 2 seasons of Caroline in the City, the final season of Rescue 911, the first season of Early Edition, post-1995 episodes of Dave's World, Moloney, and even the first season of Kids Say The Darndest Things.\n\nAlso seen on seasons 4 and 5 of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, seasons 2 and 3 of Touched by an Angel, and the first seasons of Promised Land and Early Edition.\n\nHowever, this logo was plastered by the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo on most current prints of Early Edition including the DVD and Start TV airings, and on the DVD releases of the first two seasons of Caroline in the City, and by the 2006 CBS Paramount Network Television \"Wallpaper\" logo on Walker, Texas Ranger: The Complete Third Season on DVD, but it is still intact on Peacock's prints of the latter series.\n\n2nd Logo (September 15, 1997-November 28, 2019)\n\nVisuals: There is a flash of light, which dies down to reveal the CBS Eyemark logo (with the light coming from the center of it) with \"CBS PRODUCTIONS\" next to and below it, floating above a floor in a blue-lighted white studio with a CBS logo pattern (with the color variations of the Eyemark) on the walls. The text is in the network's familiar Didot font and the entire logo is brown. The logo then slowly zooms away.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo was based on the CBS 1997-98 on-air identity, \"The Address is CBS: Welcome Home\", which was designed by Pittard Sullivan.\n\nIf one looks closely in the 1997 version of this logo as the light dies down, another CBS Eyemark located in the center of the bigger Eyemark can be seen.\n\nVariants:\n\nStarting in 1999, a better-known version debuted, which omits the light. The logo is redone in a lighter shade of reddish-brown, and the font is smaller, with the metallic silver outline more visible. However, the original text can still be seen in the reflection on the floor.\n\nNow & Again continued to use the original version, and Walker, Texas Ranger continued to use the original version until its end in 2001. Snowden's Christmas also used the original version on the VHS release despite the CBS premiere using the 1999 logo.\n\nFive widescreen versions exist for the 1999 version.\n\nOn season 1 of The Amazing Race, the logo is above the 1985 Touchstone Television logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio:\n\nMostly none or the outro of the end title theme from any show playing over the logo until 2009. On occasion, the music score from the 97-98 on-air look plays over the logo, along with voice actor Mark Elliott reading a short promo.\n\nJune 23, 2009-March 13, 2016: A light orchestral sounder, played by low strings, low horns and a piano with a bang of a timpani and a clash of cymbals. It sounds a little bit like the 3-note CBS jingle, which was used between 1992 and 2020. Composed by Jeff Cardoni. This debuted on the second season of The Cleaner, and was last heard on CSI: Cyber.\n\nThere are two short versions. The first starts a split-second before the cymbals end, and the second has the theme truncated.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Kids Say the Darndest Things, Now & Again and The Brian Benben Show, a mysterious synth sounder is heard.\n\nOn Now & Again, this theme trails into the 1995 Paramount Domestic Television logo, but on current prints, it is cut-off by the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo's theme.\n\nOn Earl Jenshus' \"earlier works\" demo reel, a long version of the mysterious synth sounder is heard. This can be seen here.\n\nOn Listen Up!, the abridged version of the Fox Television Studios logo's theme is played, as a result of this logo plastering it.\n\nOn The Beautiful Life: TBL, the shortened 2006 CBS Paramount Television jingle is heard.\n\nOn Russian TV prints of Early Edition, this logo is short and almost still with the ending theme playing over it.\n\nOn one episode, a bad plaster job also resulted in this logo having the music for Columbia TriStar Television.\n\nCBS, NBC and The CW airings used their generic themes.\n\nOn most episodes of Family Law, the scream from the preceding 2000 Paul Haggis Productions logo extends into this logo.\n\nOn seasons 1-4 of Without a Trace and the 6th episode of season 1 of Cold Case, the thunder sounds from the Jerry Bruckheimer Television logo finishes over this logo.\n\nOn season 1 of The Amazing Race, the 1989 Touchstone Television logo's theme is heard.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on Walker, Texas Ranger seasons 5-8, seasons 4-9 of Touched by an Angel, The District, The Gregory Hines Show, Still Standing, Yes, Dear, The King of Queens until the 6th episode of season 9, the final season of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (and the two TV movies that followed it), the last few seasons of Promised Land, Kids Say the Darndest Things, The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS, and the CSI franchise, among others. This was regularly used until summer 2006 when this logo was replaced by the 2006 CBS Paramount Network Television logo.\n\nThis logo is not plastered over on syndicated reruns of shows except on season 5 of Walker, Texas Ranger on DVD and Early Edition reruns on GMC (now Up) and DVD releases, which have the 2007 CBS Television Distribution logo instead.\n\nWhen the company was revived in 2008, this logo was seen on The Cleaner, 90210 (until season 4), the short-lived Melrose Place revival (except the pilot episode which used the 2009 CBS Television Studios logo), the first three seasons of The Good Wife, and the first two seasons apiece of Hawaii Five-0 and Blue Bloods.\n\nStarting in 2012, most of the shows that used this logo began using the 2009 CBS Television Studios logo.\n\nHowever, the logo was also seen on CSI: Cyber, and The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS continued to use this logo until 2019, with the CBS Studios logo replacing it starting in 2020.\n\nIt was also seen on CBS' airings of Nelvana's series such as The Dumb Bunnies, Rescue Heroes, Franklin, and Tales from the Cryptkeeper. Current prints skip ahead to the Nelvana logo.\n\nIt can also be seen on later seasons of Touched by an Angel on MeTV and Start TV airings.\n\nCopyright Stamps\n\nHere is some information about the copyright stamps on CBS Productions shows:\n\n1952-1974: © [YEAR] Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.
