        "text": "Ukraine is considering seeking a new aid package from the International Monetary Fund in 2013 after the expiration of its existing $15.6 billion bailout, which has been frozen since last March, President Viktor Yanukovych said.\n\nThe IMF program is a “barometer” that shows the former Soviet republic where it has problems and where “everything is fine,” Yanukovych said yesterday. Disbursements to Ukraine were halted because the government failed to raise household utility tariffs, a move the Washington-based lender has sought to trim losses at state-controlled energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy."
