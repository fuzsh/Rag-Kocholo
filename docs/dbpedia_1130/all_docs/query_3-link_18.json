        "text": "The businessman's press service told this to the 112 Ukraine television channel, while commenting on reports in the media about his return to the country.\n\nEarlier, journalists of the Schemes project, referring to three independent sources, said that Khoroshkovsky arrived in Kyiv on a private flight on Tuesday, May 21.\n\nKhoroshkovsky is a Ukrainian politician, businessman, former owner of the Inter television channel. He served as economy minister in the government led by Viktor Yanukovych, head of the State Customs Service under President Viktor Yushchenko, SBU chief under President Viktor Yanukovych, as well as finance minister and first deputy prime minister in the government led by Mykola Azarov.\n\nKhoroshkovsky left Ukraine at the end of 2012. According to media reports, he lived in Monaco. His departure abroad was preceded by a conflict with former Prime Minister Azarov. In December 2012, Khoroshkovsky, while serving as first deputy prime minister, tendered his resignation. He substantiated his decision by \"disagreement with Mykola Azarov's re-appointment as prime minister.\"\n\nIn 2014, Khoroshkovsky tried to return to politics. He was No. 2 on the ticket of the Strong Ukraine party led by Sergiy Tigipko. A group of people's deputies tried to remove him from registration because of his absence in the country for two years.\n\nop"
