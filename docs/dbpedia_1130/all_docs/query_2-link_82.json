        "text": "By Andrii Ianitskyi 17-07-2013\n\nOligarchs still control the main channels on Ukrainian TV, but the list of media owners has changed a little.\n\nValeriy Khoroshkovskyi, the former first vice-premier of Ukraine, sold the Inter Group of nine channels, including flagship Inter, to Dmytro Firtash for US$2.5bn in February. The real value of the transaction may be lower, as Firtash had held an option for 50% of the group’s shares since 2010, the conditions of which were not disclosed. The price was politically motivated rather than a true valuation. After taking control of Inter Group, Firtash sold 20% to the chief of the presidential staff, Serhiy Lyovochkin.\n\nFirtash’s DF Group business depends on gas supplies from Russia, so perhaps Inter will be used as a mouthpiece of the Kremlin before the presidential elections in Ukraine in 2015. The changes at the channel indirectly confirm this view. After the transaction, Inter secured the most popular Ukrainian political talkshow, Shuster Live. Almost all other channels (except ICTV) have abandoned the genre.\n\nInter Group has changed direction and begun to economise. In May 2013, Firtash refused to pay for the MTV brand and restarted the music network under its own brand, Zoom. Inter also dropped Star Media and Studio Quarter 95’s dance show Maydan (Go Dance!) on grounds of cost.\n\nThe other media owners have remained the same:\n\n• Victor Pinchuk (StarLightMedia Group, six channels, the main one being STB) is the son-in-law of the former president of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma (1994-2004). His company became the most financially successful media group in the country in 2012 with income of US$226m.\n\n• Rinat Akhmetov (Ukrayina Group, five channels, including Ukrayina) is a former MP and the richest man in the country. In January-March 2013, Ukrayina achieved the third highest audience share of 18-54s in cities of more than 50,000 people, behind STB and 1+1.\n\n• Ihor Kolomoyskyi (1+1 Group, five сhannels, including 1+1) is a businessmen (finance, airlines, oil etc). His flagship channel remained in the top three and launches many shows in the autumn.\n\nIn addition, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych’s oligarchical group is behind a media holding nicknamed ‘Family’ by commentators and journalists.\n\nIn fact, Family is controlled by state channel Pershyi Natsionalnyi (0.8% share of 18-54s, according to GFK Ukraine). The group influences local public television stations in the regions and also governs the National Bank of Ukraine’s satellite channel BTB (Banking TV). Political commentators write that Family has also gained control over small private stations Tonis, Business and TVi. In Ukraine, TV channels owners are hidden behind offshore companies, making it difficult to identify the proprietors.\n\nStarLightMedia’s main channel, STB, was the most successful in January-May this year, with an average daily share of 11.7% of 14-49s and 11.6% of 18-54s (towns with over 50,000 inhabitants. Source: GFK Ukraine). Then came, in descending order of importance, 1+1, Ukrayina and Inter. StarLightMedia’s other networks are ICTV and The New Channel.\n\nSTB became a leading net thanks to new seasons of shows including Kholostyak, Ukraine’s Got Talent and Hata na tata. There are currently fewer popular STB shows now the high season is over.\n\nSTB is now casting the fourth season of Kholostyak (The Bachelor). The third season ended on Friday May 24 with a 5.17% rating and a 19.3% share of 18-54s.\n\nThe fifth season of STB’s Ukraine’s Got Talent, airing on Saturdays from 19.00, ended on June 1 with a rating of 4.27% and 16.91% share of 18-54s.\n\nA third season of Shine’s cooking format MasterChef has also been ordered.\n\n1+1’s third season of Talpa talent show format The Voice aired on Sundays at 20.15, having kicked off in March with a 5.76% rating and an 18.37% share of 18-54s. This fell to a 3.4% rating and 12.2% share for the final on June 2.\n\nFirtash’s Inter still wins with politically driven shows on Fridays at 20.30 and has no serious rivals. The channel’s weekend news coverage is also popular. For instance, Details of the Week (Sunday, 19.59) led the programme rankings on May 25-26 with a 6.7% rating and 21.1% viewer share in 18 cities with a 50,000-plus population. Saturday’s news programme Details of the Week took second place, and Inter’s concert by popular local singer Stas Mikhailov was third.\n\nAlso, Inter topped the ratings on May 9, when Ukraine commemorates the end of the Second World War.\n\nKolomoysky’s 1+1 has announced the release of several adapted shows, including versions of the BBC’s The Great British Bake-off and Eyeworks’ Celebrity Splash, due to air this fall.\n\nIn the fall, the network will also launch Let’s Kiss, based on Israeli relationship drama Shall We Kiss.\n\nUkrayina is screening the second part of DNA – Portrait of a Nation, from local studio Show Time Production. The first part examines the DNA of Ukrainian men and the second looks at women, casting a light on the origins of Ukrainians.\n\nThe 1+1 group starts making its own series this summer and aims to sell them internationally, especially in the states of the former Soviet Union. The channel has also bought the formats to reality show Love is in the Air (Endemol) and gameshow Bet on Your Baby (Electus International) and is adapting them. It also has rights to two Israeli formats, Armoza’s The Gran Plan and Lotus’s Can You Face It?, although they have no air dates yet.\n\nIt seems that 1+1 wants to take the lead with new products by the end of the year.\n\nStarLightMedia’s STB is preparing new seasons of proven hits that give high ratings but has so far given no details about new shows.\n\nInter is in limbo because its new owner, Firtash, has a political agenda. The channel is further developing its news programme Details of the Week and political talkshow Shuster Live. This marks a change in strategy, which saw the Go Dance! format optioned in France (Effervescence), the US (MY Tupelo Entertainment), Norway (Nice Entertainment Group) and China (Metan Development Group).\n\nUkrayina has traditionally prioritised sport, such as acquiring the rights to the Euro 2016 football championship.\n\nRecently STB news programme Vikna Novyny (Windows News) lost its parliamentary correspondent Olga Chervakova, who went to Firtash’s Inter, according to journalists’ trade union website nmpu.org.ua. In the past year, another well-known journalist, Natalia Sokolenko, left Vikna to join an NGO because of what she claimed was covert advertising in the news.\n\nPolitical website Ukrainska pravda (Ukrainian Truth) wrote in detail about the controversial change of ownership at TVi, a small channel with a 0.20% share of the 18-54 audience that was sympathetic to the opposition. According to the site, the channel is now controlled by Family, the political group associated with President Yanukovych. Because of the ownership change, more than 30 journalists left the channel.\n\n1+1 has launched a number of own-produced daily shows. June 3 saw the debut of 100,000 for the Truth (15.45, Monday-Friday), produced with Friends Production, in which judges award participants money for openness and candor. Another was makeover show Beauty in 12 Hours on May 20 (14.45, Monday-Friday).\n\nWhat Ukraine lacks is strong public or independent channels without political control. For instance, state-controlled Pershyi Natsionalnyi is unpopular and biased and its reform or privatisation has been on the agenda for many years. It remains a propaganda channel of the government and is widely available but has almost no audience.\n\nThere is no comedy channel like Russia’s Pepper, which airs video clips all day, making it the country’s number one brand last year.\n\nUkraine’s 200,000 Crimean Tatars have their own ethnic TV station, yet more than eight million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine do not have their own channel. They watch Ukrainian TV or Russian satellite TV in their native language. However, there is virtually no news about Ukraine on Russian TV and what little there is is biased. An ethnic Russian channel would enjoy popular support in south-eastern Ukraine."
