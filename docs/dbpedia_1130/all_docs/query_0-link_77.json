        "text": "\"This article examines the evolution of the state in Ukraine from an object of elite predation in early 1990s into a dominant actor in relations with non-state actors under Kuchma, an instrument of elite struggles for power and rents under Yushchenko and a return to a centralized state authority under Yanukovych. Despite its different transformations the state in Ukraine has been continuously characterized by the prevalence of informal levers of power and the absence of strong formal institutional foundations. As a result, after twenty years it still lacks the prerequisites of effective governance in a modern state – an impersonal bureaucracy, rule of law and mechanisms of accountability. This institutional void produces Ukraine’s vicious cycling between hybrid types of authoritarianism and democracy leaving the state dysfunctional and incomplete. Keywords Post-Soviet; State building; State-society relations; Informal institutions; Ukraine\"\"\"\n\nThis article is the first to explore and compare the dynamics of party-building between the three main political forces that competed for power during the last decade in Ukraine – Viktor Yushchenko's Nasha Ukrayina (Our Ukraine), Yulia Tymoshenko's Batkivshchyna (Fatherland), and Viktor Yanukovych's Partiya Rehioniv (Party of Regions). We show that their political trajectories can be explained by differences in their organizational structure and distribution of resources within the party's leadership. When a party depends on resources linked primarily to one individual, it will develop a personalized decision-making structure advantaging its leader, and the party's fortunes will be tied to the popularity (or lack of same) of the leader. By contrast, when a party relies equally on resources from several groups, a more consociational style of decision-making is likely to emerge. Using Ukraine as a case study, the article shows that personality-led parties will be more vulnerable to defections and less capable of absorbing potential competitors. On the other hand, coalition-led parties are better capable of surviving defeats, maintaining internal cohesion, and merging with like-minded parties.\n\nThis article traces the rise and establishment of the Ukrainian oligarchs as ‘party substitutes’ in transitional time around the Orange revolution. I argue that the transitional nature of the political system during that time formed a specific environment of political uncertainty. In this context, the elected officials were more prone to seek accommodation of interests beyond traditional voter base to have a continued political relevance, reputation, safe exit and/or political immunity rather than re-election. Ukrainian oligarchs, who had navigated a complex balancing during Kuchma presidency for years and accumulated a wealth of material and organizational resources, became logical providers of such “political goods” to the Ukrainian transitional leaders. Thus, during the post-Orange years, the Ukrainian economic elites tipped the institutional balance from depending on government for ‘krysha’ and immunity towards utilizing the government resources in their augmented role as party substitutes for personal economic gains.\n\nHave there been changes in political institutions, parties, leaders, and regional political orientations in Ukraine after the \"Orange Revolution\"? If so, are the changes revolutionary or evolutionary? Most previous studies refer to the 2004 presidential elections and mass protest actions as a revolution. To test this claim, this article analyzes political changes in Ukraine. Survey data are used to compare changes in pro-Russian and pro-Western orientation, support for major parties in the 2002, 2006, and 2007 parliamentary elections, and support for leading presidential candidates since the 2004 presidential elections. The implications of these changes for development of democracy in Ukraine are also considered.\n\nUkraine has been subject to several attempts of economic reforms since independence in 1991, but has not managed to fully transition to a market-based system. As a result, the Ukrainian economy has ended up in a semi-transformed state with many shortcomings. A main problem is that basic institutions like the rule of law have never been properly established. Instead, a powerful oligarch class emerged along with the early privatisations and their influence led to state capture, which has effectively hindered market reform and nurtured vested interests and corruption. This report attempts to assess the potential of the Ukrainian economic reforms started in 2014 to become sustainable, in the sense that institutions underpinning a market economy may become permanent and sustain economic growth. The report also discusses the significant foreign assistance supporting the reform process, and oligarch influences that represent risks to sustainability. In the concluding assessment, it is found that although the risks for failure of the reforms remain present, for instance in the form of oligarch power, the opportunities for success appear to be quite strong. Reforms addressing corruption and establishing an independent judiciary have been started, and Ukraine has an engaged civil society that plays a key role in keeping the reforms on track and monitoring the behaviour of the political establishment.
