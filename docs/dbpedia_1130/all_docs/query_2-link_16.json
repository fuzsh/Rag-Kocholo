        "text": "To many, Dmitry Firtash is an example of all that is wrong with Ukraine.\n\nCo-owner of RosUkrEnergo and Group DF, Firtash is one shrewd Ukrainian businessman. He’s made headlines of late because of a real estate connection to Paul Manafort, Trump’s beleaguered ex-campaign chairman. That’s put a cherry on top of the reputation problems he has in the U.S., where Firtash is now lumped into the unsavory ‘Friend of Putin’ category and is wanted by Chicago courts in a bribery scandal involving India and Boeing’s offices there. But this very private businessman and well-known philanthropist now living in Vienna is much more than some pawn in the ongoing Trump-Russia plot.\n\nHis lawyers are Democrats and Republicans. They are working against the FBI that wants him extradited on bribery allegations. The FBI did not comment. The U.S. District Court of Northern Illinois Eastern Division says Firtash ran a “criminal enterprise” in referencing the India operation.\n\nFirtash’s Chicago-based trial lawyer Dan Webb did not return requests for comment. Webb is famous for his work on the Iran-Contra affair’s prosecution of Admiral John Poindexter. He was a special prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice under Presidents Nixon and Ford.\n\nFirtash’s DC attorney Lanny Davis, a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton, also did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe political and legal pressures against Firtash are symptom of a larger disease ailing Ukraine. Despite pulling out of Russia’s orbit in 2014, and despite its leadership’s overtures to joining the transparent, market-driven European Union, Ukraine is – at best – moving at a snail’s pace in battling endemic corruption. Some American investors are suffering as the result.\n\nFirtash was the headliner in a recent Washington Times editorial published on line last week. The op-ed pointed out President Trump’s Sept. 21 meeting with his counterpart Petro Poroshenko, where Trump said Ukraine needed to do a better job protecting American businesses there. The writer highlighted a lawsuit filed in Kiev by two Ukrainian-Americans who emigrated to the U.S. in 1989 under the Soviet regime – Vadim and Ilya Segal of New York City. The brothers filed a suit against Group DF for what they say was an illegal appropriation of their soy crushing agribusiness firm Kakhovka Prom-Agro in 2010.\n\nFirtash is one of a handful of “man behind the curtain” types who control the levers of power in Ukraine. Even now, while living in another country.\n\nTo Poroshenko’s credit, most of this happened under the previous administration of President Viktor Yanukovych, a close friend and political associate of Firtash’s, and a political ally of Vladimir Putin. Yanukovych was ousted in a popular uprising in February 2014 and now lives in a villa outside of Moscow. It is believed that he fled the country with hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n“It was practically impossible to sue Firtash in Ukraine until 2014 because he held sway with the judicial system through Yanukovych…all of our claims always failed,” says Vadim Segal, who lost a company he estimates to be worth $100 million.\n\nKakhovka was taken over by Nadra Bank, then owned by the holding company Group DF. The Segals have been in a legal fight to get it back. It is not fully operational and is now run by a relative of Firtash's friend Sergey Levochkin, who once served as Yanukovich's former Chief of Staff. Levochkin's family member was hired by Nadra Bank, a bank that is now defunct.\n\nIt’s a tangled web.\n\nSee: Global Campaign Against Firtash? -- Kyiv Post\n\nCaught Between Russia And The U.S.: The Curious Case Of Dmitry Firtash -- The Guardian\n\nWhat Election Meddling Really Looks Like -- Forbes\n\nFor those accustomed to wacky corporate breakups in ex-Soviet states, Kakhovka is a script from similar playbooks. It’s got legal threats and intimidation, a failed oligarch-controlled bank once bought from the state for a song and later absconded with central bank bailout funds. And it has the usual cloak-and-dagger rumors and allegations involving cabinet level bureaucrats that make for whodunnit fiction. For instance, Firtash's gas-trading entity RosUkrEnergo is partially owned by the Russian government, thus adding the pre-requisite does of foreign intrigue.\n\nAnswers to the key questions of who wronged whom are hard to get because the people in charge of justice there are often in cahoots with the very business leaders they are tasked to prosecute.\n\nIn a real sense, Firtash is simply an organic part of the scene. He is doing business in a world that, for the most part, resembles pre-1991 and the “roaring 1990s”. It was a time when crony capitalism, for lack of a better description, was the order of business. Government officials gave their business partners good deals to run corporate fiefdoms in energy, in utilities, in telecom and in media. Firtash is doing what everyone did, and to a greater extent still does.\n\nMarket watchers say Firtash is still a force to be reckoned with.\n\n“I’d say Firtash was the de-facto head of Naftogaz (the Ukrainian state-owned oil and gas company) under Yanukovych, and was benefiting from the gas trade with Russia because RosUkrEnergo, the company he controlled, bought cheap from Gazprom and marked it up in Ukraine for sale by Naftogaz. That’s been destroyed with Yanukovych gone,” says Mark McNamee, a senior analyst for Europe from Frontier Strategy Group in London.\n\nThe Firtash and Naftogaz connection is a part of a story that pits RosUkrEnergo-friendlies in Kiev and Russia’s Gazprom on one side; Ukrainian nationalists and EU-hopefuls on the other.\n\nSome people within Naftogaz who wished to remain anonymous have said that close Firtash associates, namely Yuriy Boyko, the former Vice Prime Minister and a former Minister of Energy, are not interested in reforming that company. However, Boyko is in the opposition today, and Poroshenko and his people are calling the shots.\n\nDespite this, all of Naftogaz’s independent advisory board quit last month, citing ongoing and persistent corruption.\n\nSuch is the environment in which Firtash operates, and American corporate investors must navigate. In a background such as this, the Segal brothers look like the good guys.\n\nFirtash is not a solo operator. Oleksandr Granovsky, a pro-Poroshenko lawmaker, was “deeply involved” in what they say was the illegal takeover of Kakhovka, Segal says.\n\n“If you want a great example of why this country is the way it is now…Firtash is the guy,” McNamee says. “People like him can limit the reform movement in many ways. It’s incredible that he can still wield power, even from Austria.”\n\nAccording to a RosUkrEnergo shareholder who did not want to be quoted on the recorded, Firtash still has control of his Ukrainian assets, including that one. He thinks the U.S. extradition on the Indian titanium mining deal that never closed is a stretch.\n\nHe admits that Firtash is still an influential political figure in Ukraine with like-minded allies within the legislative and judicial branches of government, which makes the plight of those who stand up to him bitter.\n\n“Firtash is a careful man. I’m not sure he is the villain people make him out to be,” the shareholder says.\n\nThe Segal brothers disagree. They say the judicial system keeps discriminating in favor of Firtash, even in the Poroshenko years.\n\nThe Immigrants vs The Oligarch\n\nIn looking for financing for their agribusiness operations, the Segal brothers picked the wrong bank.\n\nNadra Bank lent around $23 million to the Segals for their soy processing operation. The bank folded in 2015 following a spate of bad loans that began in 2009 during the global financial crisis. Firtash acquired the Bank in 2011. He called back new loans from companies like Kakhovka Prom-Agro in order to remain solvent. The bank went through a controlled insolvency by the National Bank of Ukraine, a process led by Valentina Zhukovska, a former employee of Valerie Khoroshkovsky – a media executive who also happened to be the former head of the Security Service of Ukraine. He purchased Firtash’s Inter media assets in the mid-2000s. Firtash and Levochkin – the man whose family member now runs Segal’s company -- bought Inter back in 2013.\n\nAfter the controlled insolvency of the bank, Firtash used the central bank as a cover, got early payments from new loans, including from Kakhovka, slapping on extra fines that added nearly 35% to the debt total, and took the money for himself and his key partner at DF, Ivan Fursin, according to Segal’s attorneys.\n\nThe bank filed a suit against Kakhovka for not paying Nadra “on time.” But the case was considered bogus and thrown out in 2014 after the fall of the Yanukovych government. That gave the Segals a legal claim to their business once more, a legal claim still tied up in the courts. Group DF transfered ownership of their company twice to a web of offshore entities.\n\nUkrainian investigators went after the Segal brothers again this year over suspected fraud and conspiracy.\n\n“We haven’t had any real support from members of parliament,” says Viktor Grigorivich Petrunenko, Segal’s attorney in Kiev. “They are afraid of Firtash. He holds a lot of influence through his Ukrainian media holdings and can destroy any politician’s reputation,” he says.\n\nElections are still a year and a half away.\n\nFirtash’s lawyers have been able to keep him out of American courts, for now.\n\nIn February, an Austrian appeals court approved an extradition request from the United States, but that’s as far as it went. He was arrested by the Austrians in March. A month later, they refused to send him to the U.S.\n\nFirtash's lawyer Dan Webb was quoted saying in the Chicago Tribune recently that the extradition is ongoing.\n\nSome say that the Ukrainian billionaire has nine lives, but may be running out of them soon.\n\nUkraine: Same As It Ever Was?\n\nUkraine is getting better. But taking two steps back in Ukraine is easier than taking one step forward.\n\nTransparency International said in recent reports that Ukraine has made improvements on their corruption perceptions index, moving to 131 from 142 in Yanukovych’s last year.\n\nBut, “not a single person charged with corruption under the Yanukovych regime has been prosecuted three years later,” says Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, head of Transparency International in Kiev.\n\nConsidering the opposition is supposedly in power, this does not bode well for removing establishment figures paying lip-service to Ukraine’s momentous, European home coming.\n\nTwo of Naftogaz’s London-based advisors – Paul Warwick and Marcus Richards – basically said the Poroshenko government lacks political will to change the system.\n\n“Not one of the actions that are under the government’s control have been carried out. On the contrary, the level of political meddling in Naftogaz’s work continues to grow and has become, unfortunately, an obvious norm,” Naftogaz quoted the two men as saying in their resignation letter.\n\nWhile Ukraine’s government is constantly traveling to Europe and the U.S. desperately trying to prove to Western leadership that it is ready for the big-time, and has sworn off the kleptomania of post-Soviet times, it hasn't.\n\n“If President Poroshenko’s hands are clean and he wants to demonstrate that he is serious about combating corruption and leading Ukraine into a future it can be proud of, then he and Ukraine must make clear that Firtash and his group will be forced to return their ill-gotten gains,” Mark Pfeifle, a former deputy national security advisor under George W. Bush, writes in The Hill.\n\nThe argument has been that the Kremlin pulls the strings in Kiev. Like here in the U.S., Trump was supposedly Putin’s puppet. Putin supposedly controlled Yanukovych. He rejected a trade deal with Europe in favor of a Gazprom deal that ultimately led to the Euromaidan movement and yet another color revolution in Ukraine.\n\nBut what is more true is that local billionaire oligarchs, wishing to maintain control of economic fiefdoms, are the real powers. Firtash has always been just one of a handful of them working within the same system.\n\nThe odds of that changing are looking slim.\n\nUkraine recently floated a bond and found ample investors to fund the government. That means Ukraine might not need the International Monetary Fund, after all. The IMF requires economic reforms in exchange for loans. Foreign bond lords are only interested in yield and getting paid on time.\n\nUkraine is a country in search of itself. Some corporate investors, at least, are losing hope that leaving Russia’s orbit would amount to sweeping changes.\n\n“Corruption, treatment of Western investors, and political obstacles limit Ukraine’s chance of a real integration with Europe where it belongs,” says Segal. “Without a strong and unified political system, Ukraine’s outlook for a brighter economic future isn’t at all clear.”"
