Some have decided to cash in their chips, while others have reached backroom deals or are trying to. In January, former First Vice Prime Minister Valerii Khoroshkovskyi sold the Inter television network, Ukraine’s largest, before seeking exile in Europe. Kharkiv mega-millionaire Oleksander Yaroslavskyi said he was forced to sell his Metalist soccer club and won’t do <strong>business</strong> in the city again. Meanwhile, the slow death of Aerosvit airlines is widely believed to be an elaborate attempt by <strong>its</strong> billionaire owner, Igor Kolomoisky, to evade being swallowed up by the <strong>Yanukovych</strong> <strong>business</strong> <strong>clan</strong>, which is voraciously pursuing valuable properties to enhance <strong>its</strong> influence and control of the country. “With this group coming to power, they’ve begun to force out others and now we have open financial-corporate wars in very rough forms,” said Dr. Oleh Soskin, chair of the Institute of Society Transformation in Kyiv. “<strong>Yanukovych</strong>, his sons and his closest circle are devouring and taking over all the smaller players around them on Andrey Skakodub/UNIAN Valerii Khoroshkovskyi, whose wealth is estimated at $395 million, is widely believed to have been forced to sell his television networks before leaving Ukraine.

Ukraine’s political and economic map.” Western observers, such as Dr. Anders <strong>As</strong>lund of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and Dr. Alexander Motyl of Rutgers University in Newark, were predicting the current scenario as early as the autumn of 2012. They also predicted the oligarchs Vladimir Gontar/UNIAN Igor Kolomoisky, whose estimated wealth is $3.4 billion, is widely believed to be fighting off an attempt by the <strong>Yanukovych</strong> <strong>business</strong> <strong>clan</strong> to take control of his airlines, including the defunct Aerosvit. Vladimir Andreev/UNIAN Oleksander Yaroslavskyi, whose estimated wealth is $940 million, said he was forced to sell his Metalist soccer club by Kharkiv City Council Chair Hennadii Kernes.

Participating along with him in the ambassadorial roundtable on the subject at the Woodrow Wilson Center are (from left): Ambassadors Steven Pifer and John Herbst, and moderator Dr. William Pomeranz. by Yaro Bihun Special to The Ukrainian Weekly WASHINGTON – Three U.S. ambassadors whose service in Ukraine covered almost half of the two decades since it gained independence recently discussed the problems and successes of Ukraine’s development thus far and what they envision for it in the future. William Green Miller, Steven Pifer and John Herbst were featured on January 30 in Washington at the Woodrow Wilson Center Kennan Institute’s “Ambassador Roundtable: Reflections and Recommendation on U.S.- Ukrainian Relations.” And their assessment, in a nutshell, was that Ukraine’s road to developing a truly democratic, just and economically viable and fair society has been a difficult one, but that it may well achieve that goal in the not too distant future. Starting off the discussion Ambassador Miller, the second to serve in Kyiv (1993-1998) following Roman Popadiuk (1992-1993), set what turned out to be the general tone of the assessment of Ukraine’s accomplishments by noting that any discussion of the current state of Ukraine would have to be “sober and dismal.” He added, however, that anyone who really knows Ukraine would also be convinced that ultimately it will achieve <strong>its</strong> goal of becoming a democratic and prosperous country, “one of the great nations in Europe,” as he phrased it. <strong>As</strong> of today, however, Ukraine is neither, he said. It is an oligarchy, a “criminal plutocracy ruled by the few for the benefit of the few.” Ambassador Miller characterized the imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and former Internal Affairs Minister Yurii Lutsenko by the current government of President Viktor <strong>Yanukovych</strong> “not only as an action of political vengeance, but as a clearly unjust and crude attempt to establish authoritarian control and to eliminate any effective political opposition.” Since the early years of <strong>its</strong> independence Ukraine has lost ground, and all of the aspects of life of <strong>its</strong> citizens – social, educational, political and economic – have deteriorated, he said. Be they workers, teachers, doctors, policemen or judges, he said, hardly any of them earn enough to maintain a normal decent life. Only a tiny minority does – those who live in Ukraine’s “megamansions.” <strong>As</strong> a result, he said, corruption flourishes, with bribes and service charges expected for almost every transaction in everyday life.
