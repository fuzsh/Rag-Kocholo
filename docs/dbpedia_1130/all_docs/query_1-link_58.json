The appointment will be announced in the nearest future.\n\n23:54 – Question: your opinion on gambling business?\n\nZelensky: grey economy brings up corruption. In the US gambling is legalized. If we do that – we can spend this money on healthcare or social projects. But it’s the bad time to legalize gun-owning.\n\n23:50 – Question: you had a powerful start. Now, some people say it was fun and good to elect you but it’s not fun anymore. What do you respond to them?\n\nZelensky: I’ve been responding all day today. My team supports me. I really want to stress that the Steinmeier formula will start to work only after the new law on special status of Donbas is adopted.\n\n23:44 – Question: please come visit Mezhyhirya, and restore the local monastery.\n\nBesides: when will the Verkhovna Rada adopt our state symbols?\n\nZelensky: I’ll bring this question to the Verkhovna Rada.\n\n23:37 – Question: what did you do to bring the killers of Kateryna Handziuk to justice?\n\nZelensky: I hired a new Prosecutor General.

Such as resuming the avia-traffic?\n\nZelensky: To end the war, the desire must be expressed by both sides. I called Putin, I spoke with him. Humanitarian missions must be the priority.\n\n23:14 – Question: Gordon Sondland told earlier that he briefed you before speaking with Trump. Did he brief you about Bidens?\n\nZelensky: I had no briefings prior to the phone conversation with Trump.\n\n23:11 – Zelensky: forbidding to mine amber is ineffective. We need to sell licenses for this activity.\n\n22:50 – Question: Are you going to fire Andriy Bohdan who said that the “No capitulation” protest was paid for?\n\nZelensky: The protesters spoke rude words about me. We need to respect each other. They never apologized. I want apologies from the people who chanted offensive slogans about me. I am sure that Mr.Bohdan didn’t mean to offend anyone.\n\n22:49 – the press-marathon resumes.\n\n22:33 – Another break. Stay tuned.\n\n22:28 – Question: when will the killers of Kateryna Handziuk be brought to justice?\n\nZelensky: The Prosecutor General works for less than 5 months. Give him more time.\n\n22:21 – Question: US-Ukraine relations. Trump calls himself a dealmaker. Right after talking to you, Trump had a phone call with Putin. Do you have any concerns that Trump can make a deal with Putin?\n\nZelensky: Maybe they can have some deals, but I hope they are not involving Ukraine. I want to believe Trump when he says he supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\n22:20 – another question on meeting with Giuliani. The position of Zelensky remains unchanged: no official comments on that.\n\n22:17 – the President supports so called big privatization. He also reassured the future investors and told that the reprivatization is out of the table.\n\n22:17 – the marathon lasts over 12 hours.\n\n22:06 – Question: comment on the freedom of speech in Ukraine. a number of Channels in Ukraine are to be closed. what’s your opinion on that?\n\nZelensky: These are the licensing questions, not politically motivated.\n\n22:02 – Question: during your phone conversation with Trump you said France doesn’t do enough to help Ukraine. What else should France do, in your opinion?\n\nZelensky: There are questions of PACE and Nordstream 2. France did a number of steps towards Russia, Nevertheless, I’m grateful to France for all the help it provides and I have high hopes for the Normandy Format meeting.\n\n21:53 – Question: Comment on Japan-Ukraine relations.\n\nZelensky: I’m going to meet the Japanese PM soon during my official visit to Japan. We will discuss lots of important issues, in particular, investments and cybersecurity\n\n21:49 – Question: you did a lot to free Ukrainian prisoners from Russia. But thousands of Ukrainians continue to go to Russia to earn money, or to study, or as tourists. Don’t you think they can potentially become new prisoners of Kremlin?\n\nZelensky: We’re all free people, everyone is free to choose. If people choose to work in Russia – we all are to blame. If a person has no choice – we can’t stop him from going there. But if the person has choice but still goes there – we need more communication to explain all the risks.\n\n21:42 – Question: do you feel that the oligarchs Pinchuk and Kolomoisky are trying to influence you?\n\nZelensky: No I don’t. I see no sense of being anyone’s puppet\n\n21:37 – the press marathon resumes.\n\n21:24 – Another break. Stay tuned.\n\n21:17 – Question: comment on the killing of Heorhiy Gongadze.\n\nZelensky: I agree it’s time to bring this story to its logical end. But my main priority now is ending the war.\n\n21:15 – Question: the Minister of Education said that all the Russian speaking schools will start teaching in Ukrainian next year. What’s your opinion on that and is there a possibility that the language law will be revised?\n\nZelensky: It’s not a good time to discuss language law. Regarding the schools – I’ll have to talk with the Minister to figure this out.\n\n21:08 – Question: would you rather call yourself a good president or a good family man?\n\nQuestion: I made my choice. I am a good president. Though children are very important to me. So I would rather not choose.\n\n21:05 – Question: what is the possible date of the Normandy meeting? Also: you promised that if you fail to stop war in the Donbas, you will resign. What time span did you mean?\n\nZelensky: the date of the Normandy format meeting will be known next week. As for resigning – I will resign if the society wants so.\n\n20:58 – Question: how do you evaluate Ukraine-Turkey relations?\n\nZelensky: We spoke with President Erdogan. We are interested in developing cooperation – especially in agriculture. Also, we are starting to develop joint IT projects, infrastructural projects. I want our relations were closer than between Turkey and Russia\n\n20:53 – Question: what’s your stance on land reform?\n\nZelensky: In the first stage only Ukrainians will be able to buy land.\n\n20:47 – the press marathon resumes. Question: how can you talk about the implementation of Minsk agreements when the society is deeply divided on the question of Donbas reintegration?\n\nZelensky: I do not believe that the third of the Ukrainian population agrees to give autonomy to Donbas. This question is very complicated. Yes, our citizens have different opinions.\n\n20:40 Protests on the 1st floor.\n\n20:38 Question: In June, the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation to PACE boycotted the session after Russia was reinstated.\n\nZelensky supports this decision.\n\n20:26 – Another break.

Why?\n\nZelensky: We want to have results. That is why we can not disclose any information yet.\n\n20:13 Question: Does Ukraine have a certain “formula” for IDPs?\n\nZelensky: First of all, we have to provide them with flats and work.\n\n20:10 Question: Is it difficult for Olena Zelenska to be the First Lady?\n\nZelensky: She really helps me, although it is not easy for her.\n\n20:07 Question: How much do Ukrainians pay for milk?\n\nZelensky: I don’t know. I don’t drink milk. My salary is 20,000 hryvnias.\n\n19:59 Question: Why was it decided to form a new composition of the Central Election Commission?\n\nZelensky: I don’t know those people who were appointed as the member of the Central Election Commission. We just wanted to have new officials.\n\n19:52 Question: What are 3 media you watch/read to get information.\n\nZelensky: I rely just on my eyes. I meet people. That’s it. I know a lot about the rhetorics of every media.\n\n19:47 Question: How are you going to get rid of the oligarchy media model? Is there any plan?\n\nZelensky: We are going to propose a bill. First of all, we have to discuss it with our media. I think I can convince the oligarchs not to interfere in the editorial policy.\n\n19:43 Question: Could you affirm that “Privatbank” will not be returned to its former owner?\n\nZelensky: If a court rule that “Privatbank” has to be returned to its former owner? Everything depends on a court’s ruling.\n\n19:38 Question about “Privatbank”\n\nZelensky: If there will be talks with former owners of “Privatbank”, they will be held with the participation of international experts. For example, representatives of the International Monetary Fund. In any case, I will support Ukraine.\n\n19:29 Question: The ideological paradigm of your Government continues to be unclear. What is going to be with the Language Law?\n\nZelensky: My ideology is very simple – to put an end to the war and increase economic growth. We don’t have to focus on the Language Law. This is not the main issue in our war-torn country. It is not the priority.\n\n19:18 Question: Officials who worked during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych return to Ukraine. Among them is Valeriy Khoroshkovsky. What does connect you?\n\nZelensky: I really met Mr. Khoroshkovsky. As far as I know, he visited Ukraine during these 5 years. I don’t want to talk about him. He is not my advisor. He has no influence on my team. It was our personal meeting.\n\n19:20 Question: What are you going to do to return Ukrainians?\n\nZelensky: to stop the war in Donbas, invest in the economy.\n\n19:15 Question: Ukrainians expect tariffs to be decreased.\n\nZelensky: Since this summer, we have started to decrease tariffs.

What else does he have to do for you to fire him?\n\nZelensky: His free time is about his image. These decisions are difficult now. I need professionals, who don’t violate laws. He is a professional. I do need results now. This is my team. If they don’t violate our laws, they will continue working.\n\n18:38 Question: You are now being under pressure because of this international scandal. Do you think that this is because of our former President?\n\nZelensky: He will be punished for all his actions. He accuses me of what is going on now. I am not going to accuse him of anything. We have to change the image of Ukraine. People want to believe us. People believe that I want to stop the war.\n\n18:33 Question: In Lviv, police officers have beaten Ukrainian war veterans in Lviv. A man was killed. This took place during protests. How will you react?\n\nZelensky: Everyone will bear responsibility. We are “cleaning” our country. If we want to save our country, we must remember that we have equal rights.\n\n18:29 Question: Are you going to support the so-called “Banderization” of Ukraine?\n\nZelensky: I think we have a lot of modern day heroes. Why don’t we support them? Any person who made this country independent deserves to be respected.\n\n18:26 Question: What is going to be implemented in the Law on Special Status of Donbas? What are you going to tell Mr. Putin at a meeting in the Normandy Format?\n\nZelensky: I can not tell you what I am going to discuss with Mr. Putin.

The press conference is lasting for over 8 hours.\n\n18:16 – Question: is your promise to leave your position if you violate the law still valid?

Same goes for my team.\n\n18:12 – Question: how do you feel regarding one of the biggest political figures from Yanukovych’s times – Andriy Portnov – who returned to Ukraine after you won the elections?\n\nZelensky: We do not work with him. His return after I won must be a coincidence.\n\n18:10 – Question: what’s your stance on legalizing cannabis?\n\nZelensky: I haven’t seen the bill from the Servant of the People regarding that issue. We do not know if our society is ready for such a move.

And why won’t you take the invitation of Russian media, in particular – of “60 minutes’ with Skabeyeva?\n\nZelensky: Russian media do not tell the truth about Ukraine. I have no time to speak with media who do not support Ukraine’s independence. As for Matios, I’ll fire Bakanow if I learn Matios consults him.\n\n17:25 – Question: you do a lot to free the Kremlin’s prisoners. Throughout these 5 years, over 3000 Ukrainians have been prisoners in Russia or temporarily occupied territories.

Lukashenko assured that there is no threat of Russian invasion from Belarus.\n\n17:07 – Zelensky: Ukraine should have good relations with the neighboring countries, including Poland. All the historical issues must stay in the past. Ukraine and Poland should develop closer economic ties, in particular – to develop joint enterprises. Some of Ukraine’s neighbors don’t see Ukraine as a part of the EU. We need better relations with these countries.\n\nПрезидент сказав, що хоче повернення громадян із Польщі.

What’s your biggest disappointment so far? Have you made any mistakes?\n\nZelensky: The people from big politics are my biggest disappointment. Too many intrigues. As for mistakes – we’ll talk about that after I finish my cadence.\n\n16:15 – Question: Regarding Privatbank, you said you’re going to act in the best interests of the state. So do you think it would be in interests of the state to cancel the nationalization of Privatbank and to provide Kolomoisky with compensation?\n\nZelensky: we will fight for Ukraine’s interests. The state cannot afford losing money.\n\n16:10 – Zelensky: there were never any talks in Minsk about trading Donbas for Crimea. I do not want a frozen conflict in Ukraine – the Transnistrian scenario is not acceptable.\n\n16:04 – Question: why did Andriy Yermak and Rudolf Giuliani meet in Madrid?\n\nZelensky: Well, Madrid is a beautiful city. And the sides needed to confirm that the leaders of two countries – the US and Ukraine – are ready to have an official meeting.\n\n16:01 – Question: environment issues. People in Zaporizhia are experiencing huge environmental problems.\n\nZelensky: we will do everything we can to solve this issue.\n\n15:57 – Question: resuming water supply to Crimea – did Putin ask Ukraine to do that?

Will you sign the legislation on the capital?\n\nZelensky: Now the legislation is being studied in committees. After Rada votes for it – I’ll look into it and if the law is good – I will sign it. I cannot name the candidates for the head of Kyiv City Administration.\n\n15:17 – Question: A number of MPs from your Servant of the People faction did not support voting against the legislation on illegal enrichment. Some groups of interest within the faction are linked with oligarch Kolomoisky. How are you going to solve this?\n\nZelensky: We have no groups that work in interests of any oligarch in Servant of the people faction. Some individuals really try to influence the decisions of MPs. But the situation is under control.\n\n15:07 – Question: After the visit to the US, there were rumors that you experienced an emotional breakdown. How are you holding up emotionally? And how does the Servant of the People party plan to win the elections in now-occupied Donbas – if they are held there?\n\nZelensky: I am perfectly fine. I am not weak. I’ve been busy, discussing important issues, including land sales moratorium. I met with farmers to discuss that. Ukrainians must own their land. We need to figure out what to do with the foreigners who want to buy our land\n\n15:00 – Question: you are being accused of using populist rhetorics. The era of poverty continues, though you promised to end it. The oligarchs are still in power. Can you comment on that?\n\nZelensky: I’m not a populist.

Zelensky promised to look into this problem. Short break.\n\n14:25 – Short questions series: (Journalist – Zelensky)\n\n– are you afraid of Putin?\n\n– no.\n\n– of Steinmeier?\n\n– no.\n\n– do you realize that the Steinmeier formula may lead to civil war?\n\n– that’s not true.\n\n– will Ukraine return Privatbank to Kolomoisky?\n\n– no.\n\n– will Kolomoisky receive compensation for Privatbank?\n\n– this depends on the court decision.\n\n– did the IMF mission leave because of the Privatbank situation?\n\n– no. they just ended their work here.\n\n– will you continue appointing your friends and relatives to the high positions?\n\n– I never appointed any of my relatives, this conversation is over.\n\n14:20 – Question: Are you ready to publish transcripts of your phone conversations with the leaders of other countries?\n\nZelensky: No. I am the President, not a news anchor. There are such things as tactics and strategies. Actions like this may endanger lives.\n\n14:10 – Question: Do you think that Ukrainians interfered with US Elections 2016? Yes or no?\n\nZelensky: I have no info on that. We need to investigate this question.\n\n14:02 – Question: before being elected you promised to sell some state assets after you come to power. You promised not to introduce a special status to Donbas. You gave some other promises. Can you say now that there are some promises you are not intended to fulfill?\n\nZelensky: I have already started to fulfill my promises.\n\n13:50 – Question: all the biggest criminal cases of last months seem politically motivated. When will the laws finally start to work as intended?\n\nZelensky: Recent court cases against heavyweight politicians are absolutely not politically motivated, I assure. If anyone in my team violates the law – I’ll fire this person.\n\n13:40 – a break in the Q&A session was announced. Stay tuned.\n\n13:35 – Question: American lobbyist Cohen published documents proving that he was lobbying your interests. Can you comment on that?\n\nZelensky: I never asked any Americans to lobby my interests and never paid for that. This might be his private initiative.\n\n13:30 – Question: there are several conflicting groups in the Servant of the People party. Does this mean that you are not strict enough?\n\nZelensky: People chose these MPs. I cannot control them – we are a democracy. If they fail to meet people’s demands – the party will be disbanded in a year.\n\n13:25 – Question: why didn’t you meet with the Netherland’s Prime-minister?\n\nZelensky: I talked with him on multiple occasions – including the themes of Tsemakh and MH17. In NY we just had conflicting schedules.\n\n13:20 – Question: would you like to apologize before Merkel and Macron for the comments you made about them in your phone call with Trump?\n\nZelensky: We talked with Angela Merkel just recently. We have good relations. I am an honest person, a speak my mind. Steinmeier is on Ukraine’s side too.\n\n13:17 – Question: any comments on your contacts with Rudy Guliani?\n\nZelensky: with all due respect, we have our own country. I am not going to comment on that and I am not going to change my position.\n\n13:04 – Question: In your phone call with President Trump you mentioned that the new Prosecutor General is ‘100% my man’. Is this man going to conduct an investigation on Biden’s case?\n\nZelensky: I am absolutely sure that the new Prosecutor General is an honest man. He is not corrupted and he will investigate any case, not just Burisma. In cooperation with the US, if needed. I am not going to give more comments on this, because I don’t want to get involved in the US elections.\n\n12:57 – Zelensky: we still have problems with our judiciary system. But I cannot influence judges.\n\n12:56 – Zelensky: former Secretary of the Defense and Security Council Oleksandr Danyluyk hoped to become a prime minister. The fact that another candidate was chosen may have influenced Danyluyk’s decision to resign.\n\n12:40 – Question: Can you define what’s happening in Donbas now? Is this war? Do we need martial law?\n\nZelensky: I came to power as a president of peace. Society wants peace. We are not ready to wage war, to return our territories, including Crimea, because this means losing people. That’s why we chose diplomacy. Martial law would mean chaos.\n\n12:26 – Question: Are you going to fire your press-secretary after she pushed a Radio Svoboda journalist?\n\nZelensky: In my opinion, this journalist did not behave correctly. He is a big man and he jumped on a woman. Besides the legislation, there are some human norms, ethics. As a press-secretary, Julia had no right to react the way she did. But she just couldn’t suppress her emotions.\n\n12:24 – Question: Why didn’t you fire Kyiv mayor Klitschko yet? Who is going to be the new Kyiv’s mayor?\n\nZelensky: we need a new law on the capital. I will talk with Klitschko before deciding what to do next.\n\n12:22 – Question: Are there any red lines Ukraine is not ready to cross to end the war?\n\nZelensky: Normandy Format talks will show. If I feel the offers there are not acceptable – I’ll come back and we will not resume this plan.\n\n12:10 – Question: The head of your administration said the protests against Steinmeier formula was paid for. What’s your take on that? And are you ready to relocate your administration to Zolote after the troops’ withdrawal?\n\nZelensky: Steinmeier formula is not yet implemented. This is just a tool to facilitate the negotiation process. Ukraine withdraws its troops only in places where it can guarantee the safety.\n\n12:01 – Question: You promised the new faces in power, but Avakov stayed. You promised to fight oligarchs, but Kolomoiskiy is gaining power. Aren’t you concerned that this will harm your credibility?\n\nZelensky: Let’s talk percentage. The percentage of new faces is very high. Do you have any problems with Oksana Markarova? No, she is a professional. As for Avakov, he is on probation. We want to see new faces in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n11:57 – Question: The 7 days ceasefire is the precondition for the troops’ withdrawal. But the aggressor never stopped firing at Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nZelensky: This is not true. We’re going to withdraw troops only near the settlements where the ceasefire is being held.\n\n11:52 – Question: what will you do if the veterans won’t agree to withdraw from Zolote? Are you going to use force against them?\n\nZelensky: No. We’re going to discuss this issue with the veterans. I already had a meeting with the representatives of the veteran moves. But some plans cannot be voiced due to strategic reasons.\n\n11:47 – Question: do you support the idea of social preferences for veterans?\n\nZelensky: Yes I do. We’re discussing this issue with the relevant ministries.\n\n11:40 – Zelensky: Ukraine will never give up its territories and its sovereignty. We want to stop this war. There is a chance Russia is tired of it as well. I want to find ways to talk with Russia. I support the idea of the peacekeeping mission on the Ukraine-Russia border.\n\n11:29 – Question: What’s the international reaction on Russia stalling the process of the troops’ withdrawal on the Donbas contact line? In particular – what’s the reaction from Germany?\n\nZelensky: I am grateful to Angela Merkel for support. She is the person who unites us in the Normandy Format.\n\n11:25 – Question: what about the Ukrainians who still are imprisoned in Russia?\n\nZelensky: we will never forget Ukrainians who stay behind bars in Russia or occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas. We have the lists of these people. Some names are still unconfirmed – and this is a problem. But Russia says no exchanges are possible without the talks in Normandy Format. If the Normandy Format keeps being postponed, we’ll look for other ways to get our people home – including my direct negotiations with Putin.\n\n11:19 – Question: you had a conversation with Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU. What were you talking about?\n\nZelensky: I honestly don’t remember. I have many conversations. Mayne Mr.Sondland will publish the transcript – it seems to be a trend now.\n\n11:16 – Question: Ukraine is in the center of US politics. Are you going to visit the White House? How are you going to deal with this scandal?\n\nZelensky: we need to strengthen relations with the US. We had a meeting with Donald Trump. Not it’s very important that the US president comes to Ukraine. I don’t want to get involved in the US election process and I would like to minimize comments on that.\n\n11:12 – Question: many of the new faces in the government turned our to be your colleagues and close friends. The head of the Defense Committee is the husband of your friend. And he keeps skipping the meetings of the Committee. Don’t you think it poses a threat to national security?\n\nZelensky: He is a professional. Yes, I know these people personally. I trust the head of the Defense Committee. Now he is at the hospital.\n\n11:10 – Question: comment on the changes in the Labor Code, that give more rights to the employers.\n\nZelensky: we’ll change the Labor Code and make it more modern.\n\n11:07 – Question: one of your pre-election promises was the so-called economic passport of the Ukrainian citizen. When will this promise be fulfilled?\n\nZelensky: Ruslan Stefanchuk is responsible for that. We need a bill first. Our party is working on that\n\n11:02 – Question from UATV: how do you see returning Crimea? What’s your strategy? You told that we’ll have new legislation and we’ll develop it together – how will that happen? Via referendum? Will there be amnesty for those who were against Ukrainian territorial integrity?\n\nZelensky: Everything should be discussed in Normandy Format. As for Crimea, unfortunately, this issue was not discussed in Minsk format. That’s why we need the Normandy format.\n\n10:57 – Question: what will happen to the private entrepreneurs after the new legislation is introduced?\n\nZelensky: Which media do you work for? Your owner is from the Czech Republic? I think that the media should be independent and Ukrainian. As of now, many people declare themselves private entrepreneurs to avoid extra taxes.\n\n10:55 – Question: what will happen with Privatbank? will it be returned to its previous owner, taking into account that this is a crucial issue in our relations with IMF?\n\nZelensky: I will take the position that is in the best interests of Ukraine. I cannot influence the judicial system. This is a very complicated issue.\n\n10:51 – Question: name the sides of the conflict in the Donbas?\n\nZelensky: Ukraine and Russia. Russia participates in the Minsk process – this is proof enough.\n\n10:49 – Question: what about the local elections? When will they be held?\n\nZelensky: as soon as we can.\n\n10:43 – Question: what’s your take on the protests against Steinmeier formula? How will the election on the occupied territories be held?\n\nZelensky: We did not have enough communication with Ukrainians. Poroshenko is against the troops’ withdrawal. Those who live near the contact line want the troops to be withdrawn. I am open to communicating with people. I am not afraid of the new Maidan. I have unprecedented support from people.\n\n10:39 – Question: While you were having the phone conversation with Trump, did you know that the US military aid to Ukraine was frozen?\n\nZelensky: I got this information later. Military aid was not discussed during this conversation.\n\n10:33 – Question: when will the meeting in the Normandy Format happen? Is Russia trying to stall the process?\n\nZelensky: We need to define real steps to stop the war. The date of the Normandy Format meeting depends on Russia. We did everything that we could to make it happen.\n\n10:25 – Question: when will corrupted officials be held responsible? You promised to jail them – when will it happen?\n\nZelensky: Our new parliament works very fast, we lifted the parliamentary immunity. But I have no direct influence on the law enforcers. We wait for some results by November 1st.\n\n10:16 – Question: comment on your phone talks with Trump. How this scandal around Trump’s impeachment influence Ukraine-US relations?\n\nZelensky: It doesn’t influence at all. I wanted to invite Trump to Ukraine.\n\n10:10 – Zelensky: inability to provide all the IDPs with the housing and means to live was the biggest mistake. Ukraine will not forget and will not abandon people living in occupied territories. Reconstruction of the bridge, new checkpoints, and reconstruction of roads near the demarcation line are the best arguments for the people in occupied Donbas.\n\n10:06 – Question: what would you say to the citizens of occupied Donetsk and Luhansk, who are afraid to be returned to Ukraine?\n\nZelensky: all Ukrainians are equal. My main goal as the President is to stop the war.\n\n10:02 – Zelensky started the marathon by ordering coffee\n\n10:00 – The press-marathon is about to start. According to Zelensky’s press-secretary, it will last up to 10 hours. Over 300 journalists have accredited to ask their questions to the Ukrainian President."
