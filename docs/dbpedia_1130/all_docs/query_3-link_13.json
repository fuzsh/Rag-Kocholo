        "text": "29 September 2023, 08:14 PM\n\nExclusive\n\nUkrainian and British flags at the entrance to the estate, which is located in the suburbs of London (Photo:Screenshot of the UP video)\n\nIn an interview with NV Radio on Sept. 28, Tkach told how oligarchs live and what they do in the United Kingdom, whether there are many rich Russians there, and what the UK can do to counter such emigration and enact asset confiscation of Russian citizens.\n\nNV: Please tell us whom did find in the UK? Who are the “fighters” of this “London Battalion”?\n\nVideo of day\n\nTkach: We continue this path, i.e., to look for those figures who are wanted by the Ukrainian law enforcement system. It’s not easy as they’re in different countries and cities. And we continue to look for them.\n\nIn this issue, we managed to find [lawyer Andriy] Dovbenko. This is the person who was called a “mouthpiece” for the Justice Ministry under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Later, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine [NABU] declared him wanted, and even arrested him in absentia. We found him in London and even managed to ask him a question.\n\nWe also found millionaire Pavlo Fuks. This is a well-known figure. He also appeared in Ukraine during Poroshenko’s presidency. He began to actively participate in various business projects, in particular, those related to state property and companies. He bought out the debts of state-owned companies. Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council [NSDC] imposed a full array of sanctions against him in 2021.\n\nLater, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he left the country. Although, if we look at the database, our sources in the border guard service say he is in Ukraine. He just left the country without ever scanning his passport. In the spring of this year, Ukraine’s SBU security service charged Fuks with tax evasion and various manipulations with state property, which, according to the SBU [security service], were causing harm to the country. We found him in London, despite the fact that he’s supposed to be in Ukraine.\n\nWe also found many real estate properties of Ukrainian oligarchs. In particular, we wanted to talk to [former PrivatBank co-owner] Hennadiy Bogolyubov. And for me, as a journalist, one of the main news is that Bogolyubov is leaving the country. There have been many conversations since 2019, including in the public space, about the fact that both Bogolyubov and [his business partner Ihor] Kolomoisky aren’t leaving Ukraine. They came to Ukraine and are staying here because they think that one of them can be detained in some European country at the request of U.S. law enforcement.\n\nWe managed to establish that Bogolyubov was going to leave the country. According to our sources, he should have ended up in London. He also has real estate there, we found it as well. But he flew to [the Greek island of] Corfu.\n\n[We found] many real estate objects associated with [Serhiy] Taruta, a lawmaker from the Batkivshchyna parliamentary faction, who is now a well-known millionaire; with [Kostyantyn] Zhevago, who seems to have real estate in all developed and rich countries. We also found the property of [former SBU chief Valeriy] Khoroshkovskyi’s wife.\n\nOf course, oligarch [Oleksandr] Yaroslavskyi from Kharkiv turned out to be a UK citizen. He owns a property in central London that was purchased for nearly GBP 55 million ($70.7 million) in 2013.\n\nTherefore, there’s a lot of news. Many people and many things have actually been found.\n\nNV: Yaroslavskyi is a UK citizen. What’s the status of the rest of people you mentioned? Does the UK provide asylum to these people?\n\nTkach: We need to talk about this because it’s an important topic now.\n\nFor example, Dovbenko is currently in the process of obtaining political asylum in the UK, according to our sources in political circles. I asked Dovbenko a question: what grounds does he have for obtaining this asylum? Since I didn’t see (perhaps you or our listeners or viewers saw) any political activity, any speeches, any disagreement, any struggle in Dovbenko’s life in Ukraine?\n\nIn fact, this is a trend. What’s happening now? Many of the so-called refugees from Ukraine are engaged in obtaining political asylum in certain countries. It’s clear the citizens’ rights and freedoms are important in civilized countries, such as Austria, France, or the United Kingdom. By manipulating, finding, or inventing arguments, they’re trying to get this political asylum so that they aren’t extradited to Ukraine at the request of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.\n\nAnd this is not an isolated case. As far as I know, these are [Oleksandr] Tupytskyi, who is the former head of the Constitutional Court, and former head of the National Bank of Ukraine [Kyrylo] Shevchenko, as well as Zhevago. We see, we’ve been watching for almost a year how he fights to avoid being extradited to Ukraine, inventing stories about some kind of political persecution.\n\nAnd Dovbenko followed this path. In fact, this is probably the easiest way. He’s trying to prove that he’s [being persecuted in Ukraine] for some political reasons. Although it’s difficult for me to imagine that. And it was difficult even for Dovbenko to explain during our communication.\n\nAs for Fuks. He has a so-called golden visa. He previously invested in government securities. There is a rule: if you seem to invest GBP 2 million ($2.5 million) in the UK, you get residency rights. And he used this right during the full-scale invasion, leaving Ukraine. And he lives with this so-called golden visa in London.\n\nNV: Vadym Novynskyi, who was a Russian oligarch, obtained a Ukrainian passport during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych. Does Fuks also have Ukrainian citizenship?\n\nTkach: Of course. As far as I remember, he appeared in Ukraine’s information space when he returned, so to speak, to Ukraine... Because he was born in Kharkiv and had Ukrainian citizenship. Then he moved to Russia to do business. By the way, he built the well-known Moskva-City complex, which has now been actively hit by [Ukrainian] drones. It was Fuks’s company that was engaged in construction at one time.\n\nAnd then, sometime in 2015, Fuks left Russia. The situation is unclear: either he was in danger, or due to criminal cases, or some conflicts with local businesses. And he used his Ukrainian citizenship.\n\nNV: Are Tupytskyi, who headed the Constitutional Court, and Shevchenko, who headed the National Bank of Ukraine, in Austria? Aren’t they in the UK?\n\nTkach: No, they’re in Austria. I told you just an example that there is such a trend. All these fugitives, like Dovbenko, who is currently in the UK, are trying to claim political asylum.\n\nNV: What do you know about the extradition requests for these people? In particular, against those who have been charged. Are there extradition requests for those people who are in the UK from the Ukrainian side?\n\nTkach: I don’t know. I won’t say because I don’t know. I know that Dovbenko was arrested in absentia. Then it seems to have been cancelled. Now he’s in the process of [obtaining asylum] and cannot leave London, the United Kingdom, because he must stay there until he is either granted or denied asylum. That’s why he’s there now.\n\nNV: How do the people you mentioned feel in London? Is everything okay with financial support? Fortunes, estates, houses? Do they have any problems outside Ukraine?\n\nTkach: Everything is fine. You know, according to our observations, everything is fine.\n\nTake Dovbenko, for example. As we managed to establish, his wife Hanna Ohrenchuk bought a house in London for GBP 4.5 million ($5.8 million) a few weeks before their wedding in 2019. And he lives there now. Responding to our questions, he says that he didn’t know how all this was bought and how much it cost, for what money. It just happened. Maybe the bride didn’t tell him.\n\nAs for Fuks. He says that he has certain restrictions under Ukrainian sanctions. He says that he has some funds frozen. But in general, everything is fine. He lives in an expensive residential complex in central London across the street from Hyde Park.\n\nBy the way, how did we find him? We saw a car, a new Range Rover SUV, seems to be a 2023 or 2022 model, with Ukrainian license plates, Kharkiv-based, but they’re stylized as UK black and white plates. And that’s why this car caught our eye. Because it’s strange: there are Ukrainian license plates, there are UK ones, and here was such a mix. And this way, after driving behind this car, we saw that Fuks was there.\n\nBut in general, everything is fine with him. The only thing he says is that he has nothing to do in London.\n\nI wonder if Ukrainian, in particular, oligarchs, billionaires, millionaires, when they are somewhere outside the country, have the opportunity to make use of their “business acumen” in other countries. Fuks says that there is nothing to do in London after all. He lives and takes care of his family. And this is another evidence that it’s difficult for those who achieve some serious success in Ukraine to achieve such success in countries where law enforcement and judicial system works in a completely different way, namely independently and transparently. And, in fact, all other branches of government, which cannot be involved in business and private issues, work in the interests of society.\n\nNV: If the corrupt origin of the funds withdrawn from Ukraine, with which all these assets were purchased, including in the UK, is proven, can they be seized?\n\nTkach: An arrest may be imposed, but, firstly, it’s a long way, and secondly, it’s a very huge volume of work for the Ukrainian law enforcement system, which must do it perfectly. It’s clear there can be a lot of manipulation on the part of the defense of these or other people. It’s clear the UK law enforcement and judicial systems, in particular, are very particular on these matters.\n\nIf Ukrainian law enforcement officers and courts do their homework, anything is possible.\n\nNV: Did you talk to the UK side about these “paratroopers” from Ukraine?\n\nTkach: Actually, with interest. Several media outlets have recently contacted me to talk. I won’t say which ones, but they’re definitely interested in it. And they’re interested both in Russia’s and our own oligarchs and politicians.\n\nIt’s a matter of interest for journalists. And we understand that both Ukrainian and Russian millionaires and billionaires have been investing there for many decades, particularly in London. And we understand the UK could do a lot, could make it impossible, for example, to launder money by certain people on its territory. But on the contrary: their legislation was built in such a way that it encouraged this activity. It’s clear that such magnet-hubs have the highest standard of living. And that’s why all of them have been investing in real estate there for decades. Through trust funds, offshore companies, undisclosed ultimate beneficiaries. This has been going on for years. And I suspect that may be happening now.\n\nNV: What about Russian citizens in the UK?\n\nTkach: That’s the trouble with [rich] Russians [in London]: there are a lot of them. In fact, if compared with our Ukrainian oligarchs, the volume is much larger. There are simply Russians in every house.\n\nIf we check in the registers these most expensive cottage towns and London suburbs, as well as mansions... Just for you to understand that these mansions cost GBP 50-60 million ($64.3 million and $77.1 million), hundreds of millions, and even GBP 200 million ($257 million).\n\nThere is a lot of real estate owned by the Russians, especially those who have direct influence and involvement in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf we talk about this process, which I hope will not only be declared publicly, but also implemented; if we talk specifically about the arrest, confiscation, and transfer of these assets to Ukraine for reconstruction, defense, and general existence, these are huge amounts [of money], which, after all, would greatly help our state.\n\nI hope that political statements and preliminary arrests, sanctions, and “freezes” will lead to the practical application of these sanctions. Because sanctions (I don’t get tired of repeating this) are a mechanism and a tool, firstly, for influence, and secondly, they are supposed to be a tool to stop [Russian dictator Vladimir] Putin and the Kremlin.\n\nPutin and the Kremlin don’t stop trying to destroy and conquer Ukraine, killing our citizens, including civilians. But at the same time, we see that even in the UK, people like [Russian oligarch Mikhail] Fridman get some concessions, some allowance. Previously, they could spend thousands of pounds there, now they can spend hundreds of thousands, up to millions, and they are slowly doing so.\n\nThey’re engaged in protecting their lives in these countries, particularly in the UK. And in fact, they very often receive some concessions. This cannot happen until the sanctions come into effect.\n\nAnd now we see that sanctions don’t stop either Russia, or Putin and the Kremlin. It seems that last week the European Union lifted sanctions on several people associated with the Kremlin. And it’s not normal.\n\nIf the goal is for this tool to work, and not just to politically pretend that there is opposition to the Kremlin, it’s necessary to bring it to its logical conclusion. First, don’t lift sanctions, don’t move an inch until they produce an effect. Secondly, to realize these assets, not only to seize and sell them, but also to transfer the money to Ukraine, because Russia has caused us a lot of trouble here, both with our infrastructure and civilian objects. And someone must pay for all this."
