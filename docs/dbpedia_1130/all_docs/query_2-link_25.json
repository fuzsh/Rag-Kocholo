Follow Hromadske!\n\nThe First “Pro-European” Parliament\n\nThe parliamentary elections in Ukraine are over and expectations are running high that the new government will be the most pro-reform and pro-European in the history of Ukraine. Voters largely shunned far-right parties like Svoboda and Right Sector, and populist Oleh Lyashko’s Radical Party got only around 7.5% of the vote, much less than pre-election polls had predicted.\n\nPerhaps more surprising is the number of votes that the Opposition Bloc and their allies in the single mandate districts got. The politicians who had strong ties to ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych use all means to stay in power. Gaining roughly 10% of the vote for the nationwide party-list vote and likely a sizeable portion of the seats overall when counting all of their allies running in single mandate districts.\n\nWaning Enthusiasm For Elections in Ukraine, Explained\n\nThe turnout for Ukraine’s crucial parliamentary elections on October 26 has failed to live up to expectations.\n\nmedium.com\n\nWhile many of these figures, like Mikhail Dobkin, the former governor of the Kharkiv Oblast who cheered on the Berkut during Maidan, are anathema to the Maidan activists and politicians in the new parliament, they will have to find a way to sit in the same parliament with them.\n\nWith the exception of the new Samopomich (Self-Reliance) party, all of the other parties have a number of old faces in their ranks. Many of these returning politicians were forced to join Yanukovych party in 2012 so worked on both sides of the aisle at one time or another.\n\nBelow is a quick rundown of some of the old faces and/or more controversial figures from five of the six parties as well as some MPs from the single member districts.\n\nBloc of Petro Poroshenko\n\nThe president’s party has a number of new faces amongst its ranks, some with less than impeccable credentials.\n\nDuring Yanukovych’s term in office Sergei Tregubenko was the deputy minister of agrarian policy and headed the governmental Agricultural Inspection Service, both of which have a reputation of being corrupt bribe taking machines. A case was opened by the General Prosecutor’s office against his old boss Mykola Prysyazhnyuk for selling off government property and, according to the Minister of Interior, also happened to have around $340,000 in cash laying around his home when law enforcement came by to speak with him back in March.\n\nValery Ishchenko’s alleged assistant (and Kyiv City Council deputy) G. Yarosehnko was caught up in a scandal back in June. Yaroshenko took a trip down to Dnipropetrovsk and gathered a number of leading exporters in the reagion, where he allegedly presented himself as a new silent representative of Ukraine’s security services. According to several sources, he told them to think how much they were going to be willing to pay their new inspector to make sure they had no issues with their businesses.\n\nThe political tradition of bringing the family into the government does not look like it is going anywhere any time soon. 29 year old Oleksei Poroshenko, running under his father’s party banner, won the 12th district in the president’s home region of Vinnitsya. While not illegal, it does little to inspire more confidence in the party.\n\nFormer political prisoner and Minister of Internal Affairs Yuri Lutsenko’s wife Iryna Lutsenko will be at her husband’s side in the new Rada as well.\n\nTwo of Poroshenko’s god-children’s parents, Yuri Stets’ and Oksana Bilozir, will also be joining the party too.\n\nPeople’s Front\n\nOriginally polling at barely breaking the 5% minimum barrier needed to get into parliament, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk’s People’s Front party surprised many by topping even President Poroshenko’s party with 22% of the vote.\n\nWhile the party has a number of “fresh faces” in its ranks, including well known anti-corruption activist Tetiana Chornovol and several individuals who have served in the Anti-Terrorist Operation in east Ukraine. Not all of them, however, are without their own ideological baggage.\n\nOne such future MP from the People’s Front is Andriy Biletskiy, a commander of the Azov volunteer battalion and the Patriot of Ukraine nationalist organization, who won the vote in his single mandate district in Kyiv. According to right-wing political movement expert Anton Shekhovtsov, the Patriot of Ukraine is a neo-nazi organization and a “racist movement.”\n\nOpposition Bloc\n\nMade up almost entirely of former Party of Regions figures, their role in the new parliament formally will likely be very limited. It has been surmised that some of them want to gain seats solely for the purpose of receiving immunity, a right granted to all MPs in the Rada.\n\nConsidered the architect of the Yanukovych regime, Serhiy Lyovochkin was the Head of the Presidential Administration from 2010 until 2014, leaving only after the ‘dictatorial laws’ were passed. His sister, who voted for those very laws, Yulia Lyovochkina will be joining him in the new parliament.\n\nMikhail Dobkin emerged from relative obscurity during the Maidan protestors as a pro-Yanukovych hardliner. Dobkin was the appointed governor of the Kharkiv Oblast up until his dismissal by the interim government back in March. Dobkin famously said of the Maidan protesters that, “they need to be disarmed, and those who choose to resist and kill people need to be physically destroyed.”\n\nOpposition Bloc outperforms forecasts, expected to be fourth largest party\n\n\"We are the voice of eastern Ukraine, the industrial party of the country and of the real economy,\" Yuiry Boyko told…\n\nwww.kyivpost.com\n\nOne of the more famous MPs from the aptly named oppositional party, Nestor Shufrich has rose to the top of the remaining anti-Maidan politicians in parliament. Shufrich had very close direct political ties to grey cardinal and scandalous pro-Russian political figure Viktor Medvedchuk.\n\nOther ex-Party of Regions figures include: Yuri Boiko (ex-Minister of Energy/Vice PM and a close associate of oligarch Dmitro Firtash), Aleksandr Vilkul (ex-Vice Prime Minister and headed several of Rinat Akhmetov’s enterprises), and billionaire Vadim Novinskiy (a Russian citizen who was granted a Ukrainian passport by Yanukovych himself).\n\nOleh Lyashko’s Radical Party\n\nWhile Lyashko’s party secured half, or in some cases less-than-half, of the votes that pre-election polls had predicted, they will still have a notable presence in parliament. Multiple accusations have been made in independent and corporate Ukrainian media outlets that Lyashko is a political project of ex-head of Yanukovych’s presidential administration Serhiy Lyovochkin, who also has close ties to gas magnate Dmitro Firtash.\n\nLyashko, who until recently was the only official member of his party, had one of the most well-funded political campaigns with regular television spots and billboards throughout the country, has not revealed how his campaign was financed. The journalist/editor turned politician first entered parliament with Yulia Tymoshenko’s Batkivshchyna party back in 2006.\n\nLike other parties, Lyashko’s team consists of a grab bag of individuals including soldiers, a 2013 Eurovision contestant, a Olympic games silver-medalist (who did campaigning for the Party of Regions in the past) and a few other individuals worth noting.\n\nValeriy Voshchevskiy has been working in the government for quite some time in various capacities, though never as an elected official. He has worked in former president Kuchma’s Presidential Administration and under oligarch Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi in the Ministry of Economy (under Prime Minister Yanukovych) among other positions. He also apparently worked for Russian businessman Alexandr Babakov who holds shares in many Ukrainian energy companies and is currently an MP in the Russian Duma.\n\nIgor Mosiychuk is a compatriot of Andriy Biletskiy and also a member of the extreme right wing Social-National Assembly. He has a long, well-documented history of participating in far right movements. He was recently elected as a representative in the Kyiv City Council, where he ran on the Radical Party’s ticket.\n\nAnd then there is the virtually unknown bureaucrat Valeriy Tarasyuk. Tarasyuk is one of seven members of the National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities Regulation which approves licenses and sets the rules on who can use what energy and how. It also sets basically everyone’s electricity and gas prices.\n\nBatkivshchyna (Fatherland)\n\nAs many predicted, Yulia Tymoshenko’s long-standing party has seen its influence sharply decline. The party expects to get around 17 seats in the new parliament with many of its former party members moving to People’s Front or Poroshenko’s Bloc.\n\nAware that it needed to try something new, the party loaded the top of its party list with new faces, three of which were noticeably active on Maidan. All seven of these newly minted politicians will be in the next Rada.\n\nA majority of the party, however, consists of long-time Tymoshenko loyalists or associates. Ivan Kirilenko, who was once very close to disgraced Prime Minister Petro Lazarenko, has known Tymoshenko since she was doing gas deals in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nA career SBU officer, Andriy Kozhemyakin has been with the party since 2006 after working under former interim President Oleksandr Turchynov when he was head of the SBU.\n\nOther members of past governments include Boris Tarasyuk (Minister of Foreign Affairs 1998–2000, 2005–2007), Oleksandra Kuzhel (first became an MP in 1994, former Party of Region’s MP Serhiy Tigipko ally), and Serhiy Sobolev (an MP in nearly every convocation of parliament since 1990).\n\nSingle Mandate Districts\n\nOf the 135 MPs from single majority districts in the previous parliament, 82 of them have succeeded in getting re-elected. Some candidates ran as independents, while others ran as a member of a political party.\n\nBloc of Petro Poroshenko and People’s Front saw the largest gains, winning 69 and 18 seats, respectively. Batkivshchyna and Opposition Bloc won 2 additional seats a piece.\n\nThe real question is how many of the 96 independent candidates that won seats are former Party of Regions members or associates and what role they will play in the next convocation of the Verkhovna Rada. In the Kharkiv Oblast alone 13 of the 14 single mandate districts went to former Party of Regions politicians.\n\nVolodymyr Lytvyn began his political career as an assistant to then President Leonid Kuchma back in 1994. Lytvyn stuck with his political patriarch until the end of Kuchma’s time in office. He was the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada under Kuchma, Yushchenko and Yanukovych.\n\nThe younger brother of Yanukovych’s last Presidential Administration Head, Serhiy Kliuev ran and won a seat as an independent candidate. Like his brother Andriy, Serhiy was put on an EU sanctions list in March. He is considered part of the inner circle of the Yanukovych regime.\n\nAnother seat in parliament will go to Serhiy Kivalov, the former Head of the Central Election Commission whose deliberate abuse of power during the 2004 presidential election led to the first Maidan. He recently placed a statue outside of the law academy that had a face conspiciously similar to his own.\n\nIf the parliamentary elections were a competition to get as many of your family members into parliament as possible (and it is), the Baloga family is far and away the winner. Three brothers and a cousin all won the elections in their single mandate districts in western Ukraine. Viktor Baloga has worked as the Minister of Emergency Situations during both the Yushchenko and Yanukovych presidencies.\n\nA Reform Government?\n\nMany commentators are rightly very skeptical about whether or not the new parliament will succeed where all previous parliaments have failed in the past.\n\nWith a number of well-intentioned and committed Maidan activists and a handful of volunteer battalion commanders making it into the new Rada, there is a sense of hope that the Ukrainian parliament and government will not revert back to its old ways. Only time will tell.\n\nP.S.\n\nOver half of the new Ukrainian parliament will be filled with fresh faces.\n\nOur friends from the Hromadske investigative team did a small background check on them. Check it out:\n\nUkraine Votes 2014: The Truth Behind Top-Contenders\n\nA series of investigative reports on major political parties running for the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nmedium.com\n\nGet up to speed on Ukraine.
