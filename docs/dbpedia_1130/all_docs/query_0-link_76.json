Certainly the situation in the Ukraine is different from that in Canada (if for no other reason than that the World Bank is putting $5 mil into OGP activities in the Ukraine), but this below is worth a look to get an idea of the scale, breadth and seriousness with which the OGP (particularly for Civil Society) is being taken in at least this one country.

April 18 - OLEKSII KHMARA REPORTS ABOUT UKRAINIAN OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS AT THE OGP ANNUAL MEETING How the process moved forward you can find out from his speech. \"I represent Ukraine, the country, where geographical center of Europe is located and which residents aspire to become a part of the European Union. At the same time, I come from a country, which was a part of the Soviet Union for the long 70 years - the most closed political system of the world. Why am I relating to this? In countries from my region there exists such a notion as \"facade democracy\". This is the phenomenon, when all laws and public governance seem to respond generally established standards, however they don't lead to any real reforms, whereas constant imitation of reforms is taking place\".
