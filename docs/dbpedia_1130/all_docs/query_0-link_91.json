        "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky is a young Ukrainian politician who unexpectedly won the country's presidential elections in 2019. Previously, Zelensky was known in Ukraine and Russia as a showman, film actor, screenwriter, producer, and former captain of the 95th quarter team in KVN.\n\nAn important role in the biography of Vladimir Zelensky was played by the 95th quarter studio. From 2010 to 2012, Vladimir was also a member of the board and general producer of the Ukrainian TV channel Inter.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky announced his intention to participate in the presidential elections in Ukraine. It is curious that at first Vladimir Zelensky \"tested\" himself as a presidential candidate in the TV series Servant of the People, which received a good rating in Ukraine. Zelensky himself played in it a simple Ukrainian who, thanks to a Youtube video, became president and changed the life of the country for the better.\n\nIn the first round, Vladimir won a fairly confident victory, gaining more than 30% of the vote. Having productively spent the period between two rounds and won the debate, according to most experts, Zelensky won Poroshenko in the second round, gaining almost 3 times more votes.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, Zelensky took office as President of Ukraine and immediately announced the dissolution of the Rada.\n\nChildhood and Education of Vladimir Zelensky\n\nVladimir Alexandrovich Zelensky was born on December 23, 1978, in the city of Kryvyi Rih, Dnepropetrovsk region.\n\nFather - Alexander Semenovich Zelensky - Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor, Head of the Department of Informatics.\n\nMother - Rimma Vladimirovna Zelenskaya - a housewife.\n\nBy nationality, Vladimir Zelensky is a Jew, which he himself repeatedly stated on the stage, in particular, while still playing in KVN.\n\nMy father worked in Mongolia for four years, so Vladimir Zelensky spent his childhood in the city of Erdenet. Returning to Kryvyi Rih, Vladimir began to study at gymnasium No. 95 with an in-depth study of the English language. As a teenager, Zelensky dreamed of becoming a diplomat, according to his biography on Wikipedia.\n\nThe boy grew up as an active, addicted child. Even in kindergarten, he came up with different games for his peers. During his school years, Vladimir Zelensky went in for sports (weightlifting, basketball, volleyball), loved music (he learned to play the piano, and guitar), participated in a theater group, and was engaged in ballroom dancing. In general, he was a multi-talented child. At school, Vladimir organized a team of graduates and played KVN with a team of teachers - the students won.\n\nIn the photo: Vladimir Zelensky in childhood\n\nAfter school, Vladimir Zelensky entered the Kryvyi Rih Economic Institute of the Kyiv National Economic University, where he received higher education - a law degree. However, he did not have to work in his specialty.\n\nThe creative career of Vladimir Zelensky\n\nCreativity completely captured the young man. First, he was invited to the KVN team - \"Zaporizhzhia-Kryvyi Rih-Transit\" as a director of dance numbers. But very soon Zelensky himself began to participate not only in dances but also in other performances of the team.\n\nThen he and the guys created the 95th Quarter team, where Vladimir became the author of many numbers and the captain (1997). Two years later, the \"95th quarter\" was in the Major League of KVN. In parallel with the performances, they traveled with concerts, and visited almost all CIS countries. Vladimir Zelensky, in addition to working in a team, additionally wrote scripts for concerts and corporate parties. The team enjoyed success, it seemed that they were at the peak of their glory.\n\nHowever, in 2003, a serious conflict situation arose between the team and Alexander Maslyakov 's AMiK company, as a result of which KVN left KVN. As in the case of other comedians, the financial issue quarreled with Krivorozhtsev with Maslyakov. Allegedly, Vladimir was offered to stay in KVN as an author and editor, but without a team. After that, he preferred to develop a career with the team, but not in KVN.\n\n\"95 Quarter\" - political cabaret\n\nAt the end of 2003, the Ukrainian TV channel \"1 + 1\" offered the \"95th quarter\" to make a series of concerts consisting of the best numbers of the team, which played an important role in the biography of Zelensky and his project.\n\nIn the photo: Vladimir Zelensky during the concert program of the Kvartal 95 studio (Photo: Zuma / TASS)\n\nOn Ukrainian TV, the work of \"Kvartal 95\" instantly became in demand. Channel \"1 + 1\" invited the guys to perform with the most successful numbers. At the same time, the Kvartal 95 studio appeared. Vladimir became one of its owners.\n\nIn 2005, Zelensky and his colleagues created the Evening Quarter program, a political cabaret project that quickly became popular in the country. The politicization of Ukrainian society after the first Maidan also played its role, while criticism of the new orange government was in great demand - this was done at a good level by the show of Zelensky and other ex-Kvnschikov. President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko, the next president Viktor Yanukovych, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and other well-known politicians were constantly parodied by the actors of the 95th quarter.\n\nVladimir Zelensky was the inspirer and spokesman for the ideas of Kvartal 95, but above all, he proved to be a successful manager who brought together talented authors and actors.\n\nIn 2006, at the International Media Competition, the team of the Kvartal 95 studio received the Golden Pen in the Best Entertainment Program of Television nomination. Then the \"95 quarter\" was the award \"Cover of the Year\" and the Prize of the National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting \"Teletriumph\" in the nomination \"Entertainment Program of 2006\".\n\nIn 2009, Cypriot Art Fox Studios Ltd became the main owner of the Studio Kvartal 95 asset, which, according to Wikipedia, was associated with the owner of Inter, the oligarch Valery Khoroshkovsky. During this period of his career on the Inter channel, Zelensky was for some time the general producer (2010-2012), promoting various television projects.\n\nThe Evening Quarter studio, headed by Zelensky, spawned the Ukraine, Get Up, and Fight Club programs. As a TV presenter, together with Ruslana Pysanka, Zelensky hosted the show \"Office Romance\", which was also broadcast by the Inter channel. In addition, Vladimir took part in the project \"Dancing with the Stars - 1\", in which, together with his partner Alena Shoptenko, he took first place.\n\nIn 2010, Zelensky launched the Make the Comedian Laugh program, in which he became the host along with Dmitry Shepelev. Then he led the show \"Hot Chair\".\n\nIn the photo: Vladimir Zelensky's performance at the concert of the Kvartal 95 studio (Photo: Zuma / TASS)\n\nIn October 2012, Inter stopped cooperation with Studio Kvartal 95, as was reported in the news, due to an increase in prices for Zelensky's studio products. As a result, Kvartal 95 switched to the 1 + 1 channel. 21 editions of Evening Quarter and Evening Kyiv were estimated by experts at $9 million a year. Evening Quarter was at that time considered the highest-rated show of the Inter TV channel, its average audience share was 65 percent (people over 18 years old, living throughout Ukraine).\n\nIn 2012, as part of the TV show \"Kyiv Vecherny\", aired on the channel \"1 + 1\", the political animated series \"Fairytale Russia\" was released, among the heroes of which were recognizable President Yanukovych, Prime Minister Azarov, oppositionists Yatsenyuk, Tymoshenko and others\n\nZelensky's career also progressed successfully in Russia. \"Ukrainian Quarter\" as a version of the show \"95 Quarter\" in 2010 came out on the channel \"STS\". Vladimir, together with Philip Kirkorov, were the hosts of the New Wave program.\n\nVladimir Zelensky's film career\n\nVladimir Zelensky also proved himself in the film business, in particular in the Russian market. Zelensky himself starred in the comedy Love in the City about three friends from New York. In addition to Vladimir, Alexei Chadov and Ville Haapasalo played in the film, as well as Vera Brezhneva, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, Olesya Zheleznyak. Philip Kirkorov also appeared in a small but important role in the film.\n\nIn the photo: actors Svetlana Khodchenkova as Nastya and Vladimir Zelensky as Igor in a frame from the film \"Love in the City\" directed by Marius Weisberg (Photo: TASS / Leopolis Film Company)\n\nThe audience liked Love in the City, so sequels followed. The collections of the first and second films amounted to more than 300 million rubles (in Russia and the CIS), and Love in the Big City 3, released in 2014, was able to collect more than 500 million.\n\nIn the photo: producer Lev Nikolaou, actors Alexei Chadov, Liza Arzamasova, Vladimir Zelensky, singer Vera Brezhneva and producer Georgy Malkov (from left to right) at a press screening of the film at the Atrium cinema, 2009 (Photo: Maxim Shemetov / TASS)\n\nIn the photo: actors Svetlana Khodchenkova (Nastya) and Vladimir Zelensky (Igor) on the set of the film \"Love in the Big City-2\" directed by Marius Weisberg, 2010 (Photo: TASS / Leopolis Film Company)\n\nIn 2011, a remake of Ryazan's \"Office Romance\" appeared on the screens. But this time, there was no success. The viewer involuntarily compared Novoseltsev- Myagkov and Novoseltsev-Zelensky, and the comparison was not in Vladimir's favor.\n\nIn the photo: actors Svetlana Khodchenkova (Lyudmila Kalugina) and Vladimir Zelensky (Anatoly Novoseltsev) in a scene from the film \"Office Romance. Our Time\" directed by Sarik Andreasyan, 2011 (Photo: TASS / NBC Universal Press Service)\n\nAnother comedy in which Vladimir Alexandrovich starred is Rzhevsky against Napoleon. In this picture, Zelensky played the role of Napoleon. Once again, critics and the public were disappointed. However, the fees in the movie, as reported, were quite good.\n\nIn the photo: actors Pavel Derevyanko (Lieutenant Rzhevsky / Countess Rzhevskaya), Mikhail Efremov (Leo Tolstoy), and Vladimir Zelensky (Napoleon) (from left to right) on the set of the film \"Rzhevsky against Napoleon\" directed by Marius Weisberg, 2012 (Photo: TASS / Film company \"Central Partnership\")\n\nDespite the negative reviews, in 2012 Zelensky again starred in the romantic comedy 8 Best Dates, this time with Oksana Akinshina. The film was not successful at the box office.\n\nIn 2012, the film \"I'll be There\", produced by Zelensky, won the Russian film festival \"Kinotavr\".\n\nAfter Euromaidan and Zelensky's transition to the ranks of fans of the Kyiv authorities, in particular, who supported the military operation against Donbas, it could not but affect his career in Russian show business. The continuation of the film \"8 new dates\" caused a scandal in Russia. Activists of the National Liberation Movement held a series of pickets in many cities of the country with posters “ Vladimir Zelensky is a bloody buffoon” or “Zelensky is a sponsor of the murders of Donbas residents.” Many were offended that a Ukrainian actor with an anti-Russian position helping the ATO wanted to make money on films in Russia.\n\nN photo: actor Vladimir Zelensky (Ostap), world champion in power all-around Vasily Virastyuk, actors Yuri Koryavchenkov (Batya), Sergei Kazanin, and Evgeny Koshevoy (Evgeny) (from left to right) during the filming of the New Year's musical \"Cossacks\", 2009 (Photo): Vladimir Sindeev/TASS)\n\nRussophobia did not affect Zelensky’s desire to make money on films in Russia; in 2016, another Russian film in the series, “8 Best Dates,” was released. Instead of Akinshina, now Vera Brezhneva played with Zelensky. It was reported that the film with Zelensky and Brezhneva failed at the box office, however, according to Kinopoisk, he collected more than $ 2 million - a little more than his budget.\n\nThe series \"Matchmakers\" - from success to the ban of the SBU\n\nA bright place in the biography of the studio \"Kvartal 95\" was taken by the series \"Matchmakers\", which received recognition not only in Ukraine but also in Russia. Since 2008, six seasons of the series \"Matchmakers\", the musical \"New Year's Matchmakers\", the TV show \"Matchmakers at the Stove\", the series \"Tales of Mityai\" and the animated series \"Svatiki\" have been filmed. \"Matchmakers\" of Zelensky's studio were shown on Russian channels \"Russia-1\", \"Dom Kino\", Ukrainian \"Inter\", \"1 + 1\" and \"ICTV\".\n\nThe success of the series \"Matchmakers\" was largely based on Russian actors, in particular, Fyodor Dobronravov and Tatyana Kravchenko. In 2015, Zelensky reported problems with filming due to disagreements, the producer himself and his studio Kvartal-95 are on the side of the Ukrainian government in the armed conflict in the Donbas, and Russian actors, a native of Donetsk Tatyana Kravchenko and Fyodor Dobronravov, think otherwise, to In addition, Dobronravov, Lyudmila Artemyeva, and Nikolai Dobrynin were deprived of the opportunity to visit Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the desire to make money on the series won over the controversy, and in July 2017 the shooting of the 7th season started. But in the autumn of the same year, the series was banned from being shown on the territory of Ukraine - this was done by the Ukrainian authorities supported by Zelensky.\n\nWhen it came to personal interests, Zelensky was not afraid to express his claims to the SBU. The Ukrainian actor and producer, due to the ban on the series \"Matchmakers\" in Ukraine, posted a video on the social network with the title \"It's boiling!\".\n\n“The media are discussing such an important issue for our country – to ban the series “Matchmakers”. Without this, the economy does not grow at all,” Zelensky said in a video message. He added that \"if someone does not like the word 'matchmakers', the word 'godfathers' is closer to you, you will first overcome your nepotism, and then you will fight with our 'matchmakers'.\"\n\n“This is a Ukrainian series, invented by me and my colleagues. This series was filmed with our money, our people. Who you are? If you are a security service, then take care of safety so that walking the streets is not scary!” Zelensky\n\n\"1 + 1\" filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine because of the ban on \"Matchmakers\" and in the summer of 2018, it was withdrawn. On June 21, 2018, the shooting of the series \"Matchmakers 7\" was resumed in Minsk. The final episodes of the season were going to be filmed in Georgia, and the premiere was scheduled for March 2019.\n\nThe career of President Zelensky - first in the \"Servant of the People\"\n\nIn the photo: a poster of the series\n\nIn 2015, the television series \"Studios Kvartal 95\" \"Servant of the People\" was released with Vladimir Zelensky in the title role (director Alexei Kiryushchenko). The series, under the meaningful subtitle \"The Story of the Next President,\" told how history teacher Vasily Goloborodko swears a lot in front of his students, outraged by the problems surrounding the inhabitants of Ukraine. Then a student of his class shoots a monologue on a mobile phone and uploads it to the Internet, after which Zelensky's hero becomes so popular that he puts forward his candidacy for the presidential election and somehow magically wins. In the future, “President Zelensky” voices various banal populist initiatives, the series even includes shots in which he shoots deputies from a machine gun – realizing one of the main wishes of Ukrainian citizens of various views.\n\nThe Servant of the People series became the highest-rated TV series on Ukrainian television in 2015, it was watched by more than 20 million viewers, and 98 million people watched it on the YouTube channel of Kvartal 95.\n\nServant of the People was acquired by TV channels in Estonia and Kazakhstan. Then Studio Kvartal 95 sold the rights to show the series Servant of the People to Netflix, the world's largest Internet TV platform.\n\nIn the photo: Ukrainian presidential candidate, actor, and showman Volodymyr Zelensky on the set.

In August 2018, filming began for the third season, which is scheduled for release in March 2019.\n\nThe series \"Servant of the People\" was criticized by Ukrainian nationalists for the Russian language of the characters, at the same time, President Zelensky is quite anti-Russian, approximately corresponding to the position and views of the actor himself at this stage of his biography.\n\nThe political career of Volodymyr Zelensky, 2019 presidential candidate\n\nDuring the Euromaidan, Zelensky practically did not voice his position. And then, after a further break between Ukraine and Russia, Vladimir gradually began to make a political career. Zelensky actively supported official Kyiv in the civil war in Donbas, spoke out against the DPR and LPR, and against Moscow and Russia in general.\n\nParticipants of the \"95th quarter\" constantly spoke to the soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine, it is also known that they transferred funds to support the punitive \"anti-terrorist\" operation (ATO). Speech, according to Ukrainian publications, was about the amount of one million hryvnias (approximately), which went to buy personal hygiene products and medicines for soldiers.\n\n“If Russian performers express anti-Ukrainian views, for me they simply cease to be stars,” Zelensky said in an interview. And before the start of the film \"Eight Best Dates\" in Russia, Vladimir Zelensky was reminded of this ambivalent position. After all, he criticizes our country, but he earns money in it.\n\nIn February 2015, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, at the request of the deputy of the Moscow municipal district of Yakimanka Dmitry Zakharov, began checking information about the financing of Zelensky, as well as other Ukrainian cultural figures, Ukrainian security officials.\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, a source in the Presidential Administration of Ukraine noticed that the musician and leader of the Okean Elzy group Svyatoslav Vakarchuk or actor Vladimir Zelensky could become Poroshenko’s competitors in the elections.\n\nIn September 2018, many were surprised by the news that Volodymyr Zelensky was in second place in the ranking of candidates for the presidency of Ukraine - 7.8% of the residents of the “square” support his candidacy. 6.8% of respondents are ready to vote for the current leader Petro Poroshenko. Further in the ranking were deputy Anatoly Gritsenko, head of the political force Opposition Bloc Yuriy Boyko, deputy Vadim Rabinovich, deputy Oleg Lyashko, musician and leader of the Okean Elzy group Svyatoslav Vakarchuk.\n\nAccording to the survey, the main demand of the respondents to the future president of Ukraine is the cessation of hostilities in the East of Ukraine (66%).\n\nPictured: Ukrainian comedian and actor Volodymyr Zelensky (right) shakes hands with an employee of the Central Election Commission (CEC) as he submits documents for registration as a presidential candidate, Kyiv, January 25, 2019 (Photo: Zuma/TASS)\n\nAccording to many analysts, Zelensky is promoted by the oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, on whose channel the showman's programs are broadcast. Kolomoisky has a big grudge against the current President Poroshenko.\n\n“Kolomoisky is now busy with the main task: not passing Poroshenko to the second round. Therefore, he put on the main candidate for himself (of course, Tymoshenko) and the technical one (Zelensky). The rest doesn’t matter to him,” political scientist Vladimir Kornilov commented on Zelensky’s chances as a presidential candidate.\n\nIn the photo: life-size figures of Ukrainian presidential candidates Yulia Tymoshenko and Volodymyr Zelensky, installed by a group of activists on one of the streets of the city on the eve of the presidential elections, 2019 (Photo: Pavlo Gonchar / SOPA Images via ZUMA Wire / TASS)\n\nPolitical scientist Dmitry Galkin noted that \"Kolomoisky openly supports Zelensky, who helps to weaken the position of the incumbent president.\"\n\nRussian actor Ivan Okhlobystin noted in an interview that the US authorities were disappointed in Poroshenko and would soon let him escape to some “warm country”. In addition, the artist expressed the hope that the Ukrainian showman Vladimir Zelensky would become the new president of the \"square\".\n\nIn the photo: Vladimir Zelensky's performance at the concert of the Kvartal 95 studio (Photo: AP / TASS)\n\nOn January 1, Volodymyr Zelensky announced his intention to participate in the presidential elections in Ukraine, which are scheduled for the end of March 2019. On New Year's Eve, on the air of the Ukrainian TV channel \"1 + 1\", the showman spoke about his intention to participate in the presidential elections.\n\nIn the photo: people walk past a poster with the inscription \"Servant of the people - president!\" in Kyiv, Ukraine, January 31, 2019. Servant of the People is a television series starring Ukrainian actor and presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelensky. The series tells the story of Vasily Goloborodko (actor Volodymyr Zelensky), a 30-year-old high school history teacher who wins the Ukrainian presidential election after a viral video opposing government corruption in Ukraine (Photo: Zuma/TASS)\n\nIn January, a scandal broke out in Ukraine when it was revealed that the Cypriot company Green Family LTD, which is a co-founder of the Kvartal 95 studio, owns three companies in Russia. Zelensky reacted heavily to publications in the media, in a video message he said that his company works only in Ukraine.\n\n“We don't work in Russia after what she did to Ukraine. We don’t go there, we don’t perform there, a criminal case has even been opened against me there because I and the Kvartal 95 company helped our army with finances, ”he stressed.\n\nHowever, this apparently turned out to be a joke, since Zelensky then promised that he would come out of the owners of a Cypriot company that owns a business in Russia.\n\n“The solution I have is the following, very simple and which removes everything. I realized that I can get out not from this company, which is there (in Russia. - Note), but from the Cypriot company, which is the owner of those companies. And that's it. Here we found this solution today, and I will come out soon, ” Zelensky was quoted as saying.\n\nPresidential elections in Ukraine, results\n\nAlready on the afternoon of March 31, the news appeared on the data of the first exit polls of the presidential elections in Ukraine. Journalist Mustafa Nayem cited the results of five polls at once. Since, according to Ukrainian law, it is forbidden to publish the results of exit polls before the end of the voting, the authors place them under the guise of “marketing research on the alcohol preferences of Ukrainians”, and the candidates in them are encrypted under the guise of brands of alcoholic beverages.\n\nVladimir Zelensky corresponds to ZeBrovka, Petro Poroshenko - chocolate liqueur, Yulia Tymoshenko - Widow Clicquot, and Yuriy Boyko - Moscow vodka Boykaya.\n\nAccording to the results of these polls, the first round was won by Zelensky, for whom 26.8% to 28.8% of the voters cast their votes. Four out of five polls showed that Zelensky's opponent in the second round will be the incumbent President Poroshenko with a score of 17.43% to 20.5%.\n\nLater, the results of the national exit poll in the presidential elections in Ukraine became known. According to the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, and the Oleksandr Razumkov Ukrainian Center for Economic and Political Studies, Vladimir Zelensky and Petro Poroshenko are entering the second round.\n\nVladimir Zelensky received 30.4% of the vote, Petro Poroshenko - 17.8%, Yulia Tymoshenko - 14.2%, and Yuriy Boyko - 9.8%.\n\nIn the photo: presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelensky during the announcement of the preliminary results of the first round of voting in the presidential elections in Ukraine, March 31, 2019 (Photo: Anna Marchenko / TASS)\n\nOn April 2, the Central Election Commission of Ukraine confirmed the exit of the showman and head of the Servant of the People party Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as the current president of the country, Petro Poroshenko, to the second round of elections.
