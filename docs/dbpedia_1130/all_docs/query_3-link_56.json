        "text": "20 photos\n\nPhoto: Romeo United Yachts\n\nThe discrete X5 luxury yacht wasn't destined to embrace innovative technologies or demonstrate exceptional performance. This is a pleasure craft that focuses on the \"luxury\" part through flawless good looks and extravagant interior styling based on rare, precious materials. That is mostly why it was able to find a new owner fast, even nine years after its debut.\n\nThe X5 will become a decade-old next year, just in time for the beginning of a new chapter under different hands. The 2015 Princess was recently sold through a discrete in-house deal for a hefty sum, considering its age and size. Not technically a superyacht, the 40-meter (132-foot) X5 matches much bigger boats when it comes to sophisticated amenities and extravagant styling.\n\nAllegedly built for Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi, a Ukrainian millionaire and politician, the X5 made waves at its 2015 debut with its fabulous interiors, the result of a close cooperation between Princess's in-house design studio, the famous Italian brand Fendi Casa, and the owner himself.\n\nLike a true classic masterpiece, the X5 features high-gloss cherry wood throughout, highlighted by sumptuous textiles such as velvet and leather in bold, royal colors, particularly red, yellow, and gold. Rare, expensive materials become decorative elements on their own.\n\nThe formal dining area, for instance, revealed a stunning back-lit Onyx panel and a huge Macassar ebony table for ten. Each en-suite bathroom displayed an individual pattern created through custom marble combinations. The most striking of them was the master bathroom, of course, fitted with a rare Nero Portoro marble shower against the neutral-toned marble throughout.\n\nAn abundance of Fendi items, including fabrics, furniture, and accessories, further enhanced the opulent décor. To describe the X5 as a \"floating mansion\" would not be an understatement, at least style-wise. The luxury pleasure craft was also voluminous enough to comfortably accommodate up to ten guests and pamper them with luxurious amenities scattered across its three decks.\n\nThe X5's advantage in terms of size was the ability to reach higher speeds. Comfortably cruising at 14 knots (26 kph), this sleek watercraft could hit up to 23 knots (42.5 kph) powered by twin MTU engines. At moderate speed, it could cover more than 1,500 nautical miles (2,400 km), burning 300 liters per hour.\n\nThe prestigious UK-based Olesinski studio was responsible for the X5's naval architecture and exterior in collaboration with the yacht's builder, Princess Yachts. At the time of its delivery, this was the fourth hull in the Princess 40M series. This award-winning luxury yacht builder goes back to the 1960s when it first started building motor yachts in Plymouth as Marine Projects LTD. The '60s were remarkably prolific for this British builder, who had delivered more than 150 yachts by 1969. Today, it's part of Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMH) and continues to deliver well-crafted luxury yachts.\n\nThe X5's alleged original owner eventually moved on to a bigger and bolder custom superyacht estimated at $180 million. The Princess yacht was sold in 2022 and recently changed hands once again for almost $14 million (€12,9 million)."
