He was also finance minister and first deputy prime minister in the government of Mykola Azarov. He was a member of the so-called political group of Dmytro Firtash and Serhiy Lyovochkin. His departure from Ukraine is said to be connected with a dispute with the then prime minister, as Khoroshkovsky opposed Azarov's appointment for another term.\n\nIn 2014, Khoroshkovsky attempted to get back to politics and ran for parliament as number two on the party list of Sergiy Tigipko's Strong Ukraine. Yet, Khoroshkovsky was not elected to parliament as Strong Ukraine failed to get the required number of votes."
