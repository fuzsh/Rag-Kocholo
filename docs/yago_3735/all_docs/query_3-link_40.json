        "text": "John McCarthy\n\nBorn September 4, 1927, Boston, Mass.; one of the fathers of artificial intelligence and creator of the programming language LISP.\n\nEducation: BS, mathematics, California Institute of Technology, 1948; PhD, mathematics, Princeton University, 1951.\n\nProfessional Experience: Princeton University: Procter Fellow, 1950-1951, Higgins Research Instructor, 1951-1953; Stanford University: acting assistant professor, mathematics, 1953-1955, professor, computer science, 1962-present, director, Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), 1965-1980, Charles M. Pigott Professor of Computer Science, 1987-present; assistant professor, Dartmouth College, 1955-1958; MIT: assistant professor, communications science, 1958-1961, associate professor, communications science, 1961-1962; Bobby R. Inman Professor of Computer Science, University of Texas, Fall 1987; fellow, ACM, 1994.\n\nHonors and Awards: member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences; ACM Turing Award, 1971; president, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 1983-1984; First Research Excellence Award, International joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1985; IEEE Computer Society Pioneer Award, 1985; member, National Academy of Engineering, 1987; Kyoto Prize, Inamori Foundation, 1988; member, National Academy of Sciences, 1989; National Medal of Science, 1990; fellow, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 1990; member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAt Princeton University, John McCarthy was a Proctor Fellow and later Higgins Research Instructor in mathematics. He was associated with the faculty of Dartmouth College and MIT, and more recently has been Charles M. Pigott Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University.\n\nMcCarthy has been interested in artificial intelligence since 1949, and coined the term in 1955 in connection with a proposed summer workshop at Dartmouth College. His main artificial intelligence research area has been the formalization of common sense knowledge. He invented the programming language LISP in 1958, developed the concept of time-sharing in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and has worked on proving that computer programs meet their specifications since the early 1960s. Since 1978, his most recent theoretical development is the circumscription method of non-monotonic reasoning.\n\nHe was chosen as the 1971 ACM Turing Award recipient and awarded the 1988 Kyoto Prize for outstanding accomplishments in advanced technology. He has proposed the design of a new language entitled \"Elephant 2000\" which will never forget any event in its history, and which would probably not be implemented before the year 2000. Most recently he has been working on formalization in context.\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\"There's no reason we can't build machines that think.\" (National Geographic, 1982)\n\n\"We should try to make AI systems as good as children.\" (Network posting, July 16, 1987)\n\nDiscussing the absence of parentheses in his proposed language \"Elephant 2000\": \"Having invented the language LISP, I decided that I had used up my fair share of parentheses.\" (Keynote speech, ACM Computer Science Conference, San Antonio, Texas, March 1991)\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBiographical\n\nMcCarthy, John, \"History of LISP,\" in Wexelblat, Richard L., ed., History of Programming Languages, Academic Press, New York, 198 1, Chapter 4.\n\nSignificant Publications\n\nMcCarthy, John, \"A Time-Sharing Operator Program for Our Projected IBM 709,\" unpublished memorandum, MIT, Cambridge, Mass., reprinted in Ann.
