        "text": "Lisp is a programming language that has an overall style that is organized around expressions and functions. Every Lisp procedure is a function, and when called, it returns a data object as its value. It is also commonly referred to as “functions” even though they may have side effects.\n\nLisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in the world which is invented by John McCarthy in the year 1958 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nFeatures of LISP Programming Language:\n\nIt is a machine-independent language\n\nIt uses iterative design methodology and is easily extensible\n\nIt allows us to create and update the programs and applications dynamically.\n\nIt provides high-level debugging.\n\nIt supports object-oriented programming.\n\nIt supports all kinds of data types like objects, structures, lists, vectors, adjustable arrays, set, trees,hash-tables, and symbols.\n\nIt is an expression-based language\n\nIt can support different decision-making statements like if, when,case, and cond\n\nIt will also support different iterating statements like do, loop,loopfor, dotimes and dolist.\n\nIt will support input and output functions\n\nBy using lisp we can also create our own functions\n\nThese are the features of LISP Programming.\n\nHello World program in LISP:\n\nwe can start writing a string by using the write-line method\n\nSyntax:\n\n(write-line string)\n\nExample:\n\nOutput:\n\nHello Geeks\n\nNaming Conventions:\n\nThe naming Conventions mean the way we are declaring variables in a program. It includes the variable names and syntax formats\n\nLets us discuss the conventions\n\nA variable can contain any number of alphanumeric characters other than whitespace, open and closing parentheses\n\nExample:\n\nAcceptable – hello,saisravan, etc\n\nNot Acceptable – hell()0,sat{ sravab{,,,,,,,,etc\n\nA variable can not contain double and single quotes, backslash, comma, colon, semicolon, and vertical bar.\n\nExample:\n\nAcceptable – hello,saisravan, etc\n\nNot Acceptable – hell””)0,sat//*& sra//>vab{,,,,,,,,etc\n\nA variable can not start with a digit but. it can contain any number of digits\n\nExample:\n\nAcceptable – hello88Geeks, r56lisp, ,,,,,etc\n\nNot Acceptable – 40geeks,4klll,….etc\n\nExample Code: For acceptable names\n\nOutput:\n\nhello hello99 hello geeks hello_Geek hello123"
