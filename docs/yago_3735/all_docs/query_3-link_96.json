        "text": "We suggest a new representation of defeasible entailment and specificity in the framework of default logic. The rep- resentation is based on augmenting the underlying classical language with the language of conditionals having its own (monotonic) internal logic. It is shown, in particular, that nonmonotonic inheritance reasoning can be naturally repre- sented in this framework, and generalized to the full classical language. The problem of nonmonotonic, defeasible inference can be seen as the main objective, as well as the main prob- lem of the general theory of nonmonotonic reasoning. An impressive success has been achieved in our understanding of it, in realizing how complex it is, and, most importantly, how many different forms it may have. Many formalisms have been developed and implemented that capture signifi- cant aspects of defeasible inference, though a unified picture has not yet emerged. In this study we will suggest a new representation of defeasible inference in the fra...\n\nRepresenting and reasoning about narratives together with the ability to do hypothetical reasoning is important for agents in a dynamic world. These agents need to record their observations and action executions as a narrative and at the same time, to achieve their goals against a changing environment, they need to make plans (or re-plan) from the current situation. The early action formalisms did one or the other.\n\nThe 2007 Spring Symposium Series was held Monday through Wednesday, March 26-28, 2007, at Stanford University, California. The titles of the nine symposia in this symposium series were (1) Control Mechanisms for Spatial Knowledge Processing in Cognitive/Intelligent Systems,(2) Game Theoretic and Decision Theoretic Agents,(3) Intentions in Intelligent Systems,(4) Interaction Challenges for Artificial Assistants,(5) Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning,(6) Machine Reading,(7) Multidisciplinary ..."
