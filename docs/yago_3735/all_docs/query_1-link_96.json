Even though Wikipedia does call Speedcoding such, the description gives no indication that it provided\n\nstrong abstraction from the details of the computer.\n\nAll it apparently offered were\n\npseudo-instructions for common mathematical functions: logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations\n\nwhich is a far cry from sophisticated language constructs (functions, loops, conditionals) that are commonly associated with \"high-level\"."
