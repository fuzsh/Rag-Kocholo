        "text": "1.  WELCOME!\n\n2.   Presented By:  Adarsh Saxena(15MCA13)  Rohit Gupta(15MCA15)  Devesh Kumar(15MCA16) John McCarthy (1927-2011)\n\n3.   Early life and education  Academic Career  Contributions In Computer Science  Philosohpy of A.I  Awards and Honors  Conclusion Content\n\n4.   Born in Boston, Massachusetts U.S.A. in Sept 4 1927.  Father name was John Patrick.  Mother name was Glatt McCarthy. Early life and Education\n\n5.   McCarthy was exceptionally intelligent.  Graduated from Belmont High School two years early.  McCarthy was accepted into Caltech in 1944.  Served in the U.S Army.  In Caltech he received a lecture from John Von Neumann.  Received a Ph.D in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1951. Contd..\n\n6.   After short term appointment at Stanford University, McCarthy became an Assistant Professor at Dartmouth in 1955.  Moved to MIT in 1956.  In 1962, McCarthy became a full Professor at Stanford.  Retired In 2000.  McCarthy championed mathematical logic for A.I. Academic Career\n\n7.   John McCarthy is one of the \"founding fathers\" of artificial intelligence, together with Marvin Minsky , Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon.  McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\", and organized the famous Dartmouth Conference in summer 1956. This conference started AI as a field.  In autumn 1956, McCarthy served on the committee that designed ALGOL, which became a very influential programming language by introducing many new constructs now in common use. Contributions In Computer Science\n\n8.   In 1958, he proposed the advice taker, which inspired later work on question-answering and logic programming.  John McCarthy invented Lisp in the late 1950s. Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications after its publication in 1960.  Around 1959, he invented so-called \"garbage collection\" methods to solve problems in Lisp. Contd..\n\n9.   In 1961, he was perhaps the first to suggest publicly the idea of utility computing.  In 1966, McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of chess games with counterparts in the Soviet Union; McCarthy's team lost two games and drew two games .  From 1978 to 1986, McCarthy developed the circumscription method of non-monotonic reasoning. Contd..\n\n10.   McCarthy is also credited with developing an early form of time-sharing. Contd..\n\n11.   In 1979 McCarthy wrote an article entitled \"Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines.\" In it he wrote, \"Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs, and having beliefs seems to be a characteristic of most machines capable of problem solving performance.\" In 1980 the philosopher John Searle responded with his famous Chinese Room Argument, disagreeing with McCarthy and taking the stance that machines can not have beliefs simply because they are not conscious (he says that machines lack 'intentionality', a term commonly used in the philosophy of mind). A vast amount of literature has been written in support of one side or the other. Philosohpy of A.I\n\n12.   Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (1971).  Kyoto Prize (1988).  National Medal of Science (USA) in Mathematical, Statistical, and Computational Sciences (1990).  Inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum \"for his co-founding of the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and timesharing systems, and for major contributions to mathematics and computer science.\" (1999) Awards & Honours\n\n13.   Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science from the Franklin Institute (2003).  Inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame (2011), for the \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems\".[29][30]  Named as one of the 2012 Stanford Engineering Heroes.[31] Contd.."
