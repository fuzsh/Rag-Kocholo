        "text": "By lowering costs, it allowed more people to use computers and laid the groundwork for the interactive computing of today.\n\nThough he did not foresee the rise of the personal computer, Dr. McCarthy was prophetic in describing the implications of other technological advances decades before they gained currency.\n\n“In the early 1970s, he presented a paper in France on buying and selling by computer, what is now called electronic commerce,’’ said Whitfield Diffie, an Internet security specialist who worked as a researcher for Dr. McCarthy at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nIn the study of artificial intelligence, “no one is more influential than John,’’ Diffie said.\n\nWhile teaching mathematics at Dartmouth College in 1956, Dr. McCarthy was the principal organizer of the first Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The idea of simulating human intelligence had been discussed for decades, but the term “artificial intelligence,’’ originally used to help raise funds to support the conference, stuck.\n\nIn 1958, Dr. McCarthy moved to MIT, where, with Marvin Minsky, he founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was at MIT that he began working on what he called List Processing Language, or LISP, a computer language that became the standard tool for artificial intelligence research and design.\n\nAround the same time he came up with a technique called garbage collection, in which pieces of computer code that are not needed by a running computation are automatically removed from the computer’s random access memory.\n\nHe developed the technique in 1959 and added it to LISP. That technique is now routinely used in Java and other programming languages.\n\nHis MIT work also led to fundamental advances in software and operating systems. In one, he was instrumental in developing the first time-sharing system for mainframe computers.\n\nThe power of that invention would come to shape his worldview to such an extent that when the first personal computers emerged with local computing and storage in the 1970s, he belittled them as toys.\n\nHe predicted, wrongly, that in the future everyone would have a relatively simple and inexpensive computer terminal in the home linked to a shared, centralized mainframe and use it as an electronic portal to the worlds of commerce and news and entertainment media.\n\nDr. McCarthy, who taught briefly at Stanford in the early 1950s, returned there in 1962 and in 1964 became the founding director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Its optimistic, space-age goal, with financial backing from the Pentagon, was to create a working artificial intelligence system within a decade.\n\nYears later he developed a respect for the challenge, saying that creating a thinking machine would require “1.8 Einsteins and one-tenth the resources of the Manhattan Project.’’\n\nArtificial intelligence is still thought to be far in the future, although tremendous progress has been made in systems that mimic many human skills, including vision, listening, reasoning, and, in robotics, the movements of limbs. From the mid-’60s to the mid-’70s, the Stanford lab played a vital role in creating technologies, including robotics and machine-vision natural language.\n\nIn 1972, the laboratory drew national attention when Stewart Brand, the founder of The Whole Earth Catalog, wrote about it in Rolling Stone magazine under the headline “SPACEWAR: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums.’’ The article evoked the esprit de corps of a group of researchers who had been freed to create their own virtual worlds, foreshadowing the emergence of cyberspace. “Ready or not, computers are coming to the people,’’ Brand wrote.\n\nDr. McCarthy had begun inviting the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley hobbyist group, to meet at the Stanford lab. Among its growing membership were Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, who would go on to found Apple.\n\nBut Dr. McCarthy still cast a jaundiced eye on personal computing. In the second Homebrew newsletter, he suggested the formation of a “Bay Area Home Terminal Club’’ to provide computer access on a shared Digital Equipment computer. He thought a user fee of $75 a month would be reasonable.\n\nAlthough Dr. McCarthy initially missed the significance of the PC, his early thinking on electronic commerce influenced Diffie at the Stanford lab. Drawing on those ideas, Diffie began thinking about what would replace the paper personal check in an all-electronic world.\n\nHe and two other researchers went on to develop the basic idea of public key cryptography, the basis of all modern electronic banking and commerce, providing secure interaction between a consumer and a business.\n\nA chess enthusiast, Dr. McCarthy began working on chess-playing computer programs in the 1950s at Dartmouth. Shortly after joining the Stanford lab, he engaged a group of Soviet computer scientists in an intercontinental chess match after he discovered they had a chess-playing computer. The match consisted of four games and lasted almost a year. The Soviet scientists won.\n\nJohn McCarthy was born into a politically engaged family in Boston. His father, John Patrick McCarthy, was an Irish immigrant and a labor organizer.\n\nHis mother, the former Ida Glatt, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, was active in the suffrage movement.\n\nHe entered the California Institute of Technology in 1944 and went on to graduate studies at Princeton University, where he was a colleague of John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel laureate economist and subject of Sylvia Nasar’s book “A Beautiful Mind,’’ which was adapted into a movie.\n\nIn 1971 Dr. McCarthy received the Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery, for his work in artificial intelligence. He was awarded the Kyoto Prize in 1988, the National Medal of Science in 1991, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2003.\n\nBesides his daughter Sarah, of Nevada City, Calif., he leaves his wife, Carolyn Talcott; his daughter, Susan of San Francisco; and a son, Timothy of Stanford.\n\nHe remained an independent thinker throughout his life. Some years ago, one of his daughters presented him with a license plate bearing one of his favorite aphorisms: “Do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense.’’"
