        "text": "If youâre interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence (AI), youâll need to know how to code. But where do you start? What is the best programming language for AI? And what platforms should you begin with? This article will provide you with a high-level overview of the best programming languages and platforms for AI, as well as their key features.\n\nAs it turns out, thereâs only a small number of programming languages for AI that are commonly used.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nPython emerges as one of the leading AI programming languages, valued for its simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong community support, making it an excellent starting point for beginners.\n\nR and Julia are highlighted for their specialized capabilities in statistical analysis and high-performance numerical computing, respectively, catering to specific needs in AI development.\n\nWhile traditional languages like C++ and Java retain their relevance for performance-intensive applications, emerging languages and platforms offer new possibilities, emphasizing the importance of choosing a language based on the projectâs specific requirements and the developerâs expertise.\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence is one of the most fascinating and rapidly growing fields in computer science. Itâs already transforming the world around us as we speak. And itâs as hot a job market as you can get (see Gartner forecasts).\n\nAI aims to create intelligent computer systems. Itâs essentially the process of making a computer system that can learn and work on its own.\n\nMachine learning (ML), on the other hand, deals with the methods and techniques used so that a computer system can âlearnâ how to perform certain tasks and even predict certain outcomes, without being explicitly programmed for it.\n\nA (Very) Brief History of AI\n\nThe term âartificial intelligenceâ was first coined in 1956 by computer scientist John McCarthy, when the field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline. In the years since, AI has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an âAI winterâ), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.\n\nFor most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals, application domains (such as medicine and robotics), and/or particular implementation approaches (such as symbolic computation and connectionism).\n\nThe traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include:\n\nreasoning\n\nknowledge representation\n\nplanning\n\nlearning\n\nnatural language processing\n\nperception (computer vision)\n\nmoving and manipulating objects (robotics)\n\nTodayâs and Tomorrowâs AI\n\nToday, AI is used in a variety of ways, from powering virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to more complex applications like self-driving cars and predictive analytics.\n\nIn the foreseeable future, artificial general intelligence (AGI, also called strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action) is still among the fieldâs long-term goals â with common approaches including statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.\n\nBest Programming Languages for AI Development\n\nHere are the most popular languages used in AI development, along with their key features.\n\nPython\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nPython is the most popular AI programming language itâs one of the hottest languages going around, and itâs also easy to learn!\n\nPython is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level, built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development (RAD), as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.\n\nKey features of Python:\n\nIt has simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability (and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance).\n\nIt supports modules and packages (which encourages program modularity and code reuse).\n\nIt has an extensive standard library (available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms).\n\nWhat makes Python good for AI:\n\nIt has a rich set of libraries for data analysis and manipulation, such as Pandas, making it easy to work with the data.\n\nIt has a number of libraries specifically for machine learning, such as TensorFlow and Keras.\n\nIt has solid scientific and computation libraries, such as scikit-learn and NumPy.\n\nIt can even be used to program microcontrollers with projects like MicroPython, CircuitPython, and Raspberry Pi.\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: TensorFlow and Keras\n\nDescription: Open-source libraries for machine learning and deep learning, developed by Google. Used in various applications, from voice/image recognition to drug discovery.\n\nIf youâre starting with Python, itâs worth checking out the book The Python Apprentice, by Austin Bingham and Robert Smallshire, as well as other the Python books and courses on SitePoint.\n\nR\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nR is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics thatâs supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.\n\nThe R language is something of a lingua franca among statisticians, as itâs widely used in official statistics (see uRos2020 and uRos2022), but also on data mining and for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R has an active user base of about two million people worldwide.\n\nKey features of R:\n\nIt has an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical display.\n\nIt has an effective data handling and storage facility, providing a wide variety of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.\n\nIt offers extensive graphical facilities for data analysis and display, either directly at the computer or on hardcopy devices â including interactive web-based interfaces such as Shiny.\n\nItâs a well-developed, simple and consistent programming language that includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions, and input/output facilities (including connections to relational databases).\n\nWhat makes R good for AI:\n\nItâs designed specifically with statisticians in mind (unlike Python, which was designed as a general-purpose language).\n\nIt has many features that are useful for AI development, such as linear and nonlinear modeling, time series analysis, classification, and clustering.\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Microsoft R Server\n\nDescription: An enterprise-scale server for running and managing R workloads, used in big data analytics, including machine learning projects.\n\nJulia\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nJulia is a relatively new (launched in 2012), high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax thatâs familiar to users of other technical computing environments.\n\nKey features of Julia:\n\nItâs designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing.\n\nIts easy to use and learn.\n\nIt can call C and Fortran libraries directly (thereâs no need to write wrappers or interface code).\n\nIt can be used for parallel and distributed computing.\n\nIt comes with an extensive standard library, including differential equations, optimization, and machine learning.\n\nWhat makes Julia good for AI:\n\nIn addition to being fast, Julia is also very flexible (which makes it easy to experiment with different models quickly).\n\nIt has a number of well-developed machine learning libraries, such as Flux, MLJ, and KNet.\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Celeste\n\nDescription: A project aimed at cataloging the visible universe, processing petabytes of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Demonstrated Juliaâs capability for high-performance scientific computing.\n\nC++ and C\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nC++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming, and was designed with portability, efficiency and flexibility of use in mind. The main competitor to C++ is Microsoftâs C#, which is very similar in syntax but offers some additional features and benefits like a more managed memory model as well as LINQ (Language Integrated Query) support out of the box, amongst other things.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nC++ has also been found useful in widespread domains such as computer graphics, image processing, and scientific computing. Similarly, C# has been used to develop 3D and 2D games, as well as industrial applications.\n\nKey features of C++ and C#:\n\nTheyâre both object oriented, supporting data abstraction using classes, objects and inheritance.\n\nC++ is a compiled language, meaning that itâs converted directly into machine code that can be run on a computer. C# is a managed language and runs on top of a virtual machine, which makes it portable across different platforms.\n\nC++ offers more control over memory management than C#, but this also means thereâs more room for error.\n\nWhat makes C++ and C# good for AI:\n\nBoth languages are widely used in game development, and many games make use of AI.\n\nTheyâre both high-performance, due to being compiled languages and offering low-level control when necessary.\n\nC# has a wide range of available libraries and tooling support from Visual Studio.\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Game AI in Unreal Engine (C++)\n\nDescription: The Unreal Engine, widely used for game development, leverages C++ for its AI capabilities, including pathfinding and decision-making in complex environments.\n\nProject: Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (C#)\n\nDescription: A deep learning framework used to train algorithms to think like the human brain, applied in areas such as speech recognition and search relevance.\n\nJava\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nJava is a versatile and powerful programming language that enables developers to create robust, high-performance applications.\n\nKey features of Java:\n\nItâs object-oriented (supporting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).\n\nItâs platform-independent (bytecode can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine).\n\nItâs statically typed (ensures type safety at compile time).\n\nIt has a large standard library.\n\nIt supports exception handling (which helps to manage errors and exceptional conditions gracefully) and multi-threading (which enables concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program).\n\nWhat makes Java good for AI:\n\nItâs fast, reliable, and has great tooling support (making it easy to develop complex AI applications quickly and efficiently).\n\nItâs used in many mission-critical applications, so itâs battle-tested.\n\nIt can be used for both desktop and mobile apps (using the Android Studio).\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Deeplearning4j\n\nDescription: An open-source, distributed deep-learning library for Java and Scala, used in industry for fraud detection, text mining, and image recognition.\n\nJavaScript: A Dynamic Force in AI Development\n\nDespite its roots in web development, JavaScript has emerged as a versatile player in the AI arena, thanks to an active ecosystem and powerful frameworks like TensorFlow.js. As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript enables AI applications to run directly in the user interface, facilitating real-time user interactions and data processing without the need for server-side computation.\n\nKey Features:\n\nVersatility and Accessibility: With Node.js, JavaScript extends its reach from client-side to server-side, allowing for a unified language across the full stack of development.\n\nFrameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow.js, Brain.js, and Synaptic provide robust tools for machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning, making advanced AI technologies accessible to web developers.\n\nWhat Makes JavaScript Good for AI:\n\nReal-Time Data Processing: Ideal for applications requiring immediate data analysis and feedback, such as interactive web experiences and live data visualization.\n\nWide Adoption and Community Support: A vast and active developer community drives innovation and provides extensive resources for learning and troubleshooting\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Brain.js\n\nDescription: A JavaScript library for neural networks that enables AI development directly in the browser or on Node.js, making machine learning accessible to web developers.\n\nScala: Bridging Functional and Object-Oriented Programming for AI\n\nScala, a language that combines functional programming with object-oriented programming, offers a unique toolset for AI development. Its ability to handle complex data types and support for concurrent programming makes Scala an excellent choice for building robust, scalable AI systems. The languageâs interoperability with Java means that it can leverage the vast ecosystem of Java libraries, including those related to AI and machine learning, such as Deeplearning4j.\n\nKey Features:\n\nHybrid Paradigm: Scalaâs integration of functional and object-oriented programming paradigms allows developers to choose the best approach for their task.\n\nImmutability: Scala encourages the use of immutable objects, which can simplify development and reduce errors in concurrent applications.\n\nType Inference: Scalaâs sophisticated type inference system reduces verbosity, making code cleaner and more readable.\n\nWhat Makes Scala Good for AI:\n\nScalability: Its name derived from âscalable languageâ, Scala is designed to grow with the demands of its users, from small scripts to large systems.\n\nRich Ecosystem: Scala benefits from its compatibility with Java, providing access to a plethora of libraries and frameworks essential for AI and machine learning projects.\n\nExample Projects:\n\nProject: Apache Spark\n\nDescription: A unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing. Scalaâs concise syntax is ideal for data science workflows.\n\nHonorary Mentions: Lisp and Prolog\n\nLisp and Prolog are not as widely used as the languages mentioned above, but theyâre still worth mentioning.\n\nLisp (also introduced by John McCarthy in 1958) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, parenthesis-based syntax. It was originally created for artificial intelligence research. Today, Lisp is used in a variety of applications, including scripting and system administration.\n\nProlog (general core, modules) is a logic programming language from the early â70s thatâs particularly well suited for artificial intelligence applications. Its declarative nature makes it easy to express complex relationships between data. Prolog is also used for natural language processing and knowledge representation.\n\nComparison of AI Programing Languages\n\nLanguage Good for AI Becauseâ¦ Key Features Python Rich set of libraries for data analysis, ML, and scientific computing.

Haskell Purely functional programming language, making it excellent for mathematical computations and abstract reasoning. Statically typed, lazily evaluated, supports high-order functions, which is beneficial for AI algorithms requiring high levels of abstraction.\n\nProgramming Languages to Avoid in AI Development\n\nThese are languages that, while they may have their place, donât really have much to offer the world of AI.\n\nCOBOL is an old language that was created in the 1950s and 1960s. It was designed for business applications and isnât really suited for anything else.\n\nFORTRAN is another old language, dating back to 1957. It was designed for scientific and engineering applications and, like COBOL, isnât really suitable for anything else.\n\nPascal is a language that was created in the 1970s and isnât really used much anymore outside of academia.\n\nBasic is a language that was designed for beginners and has been largely superseded by other languages such as Python.\n\nThat said, you might think that a completely left-of-field language such as JavaScript â which is primarily used for web development â also wouldnât have much to offer to AI, right? And yet, there are quite interesting active projects â such as TensorFlow.js (backed by Google) â for developing machine-learning models in JavaScript, which can be used directly in the browser or in Node.js. So, who knew?!\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is here; itâs already happened. And as itâs transforming the way we live and is changing the way we interact with the world and each other, itâs also creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n\nAs with everything in IT, thereâs no magic bullet or one-size-fits-all solution. When choosing a programming language for AI, youâll have to test the water, possibly switching languages depending on factors such as the task at hand, the platform you and your team are using, and your own preferences and expertise.\n\nThat being said, Python is generally considered to be one of the best AI programming languages, thanks to its ease of use, vast libraries, and active community. R is also a good choice for AI development, particularly if youâre looking to develop statistical models. Julia is a newer language thatâs gaining popularity for its speed and efficiency. And if youâre looking to develop low-level systems or applications with tight performance constraints, then C++ or C# may be your best bet.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nFive Simple Ways to Build Artificial Intelligence\n\nWhat is GitHub Copilot?
