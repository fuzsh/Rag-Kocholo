        "text": "The Lisp Programming language is unveiled and Commodore launch the PET 2001. All on today’s On This Day from TEST Huddle.\n\n1959 – Lisp Programming Language Unveiled\n\nLisp, the programming language that will provide the basis for most significant work in the field of artificial intelligence, is first unveiled. The programme language was created by John McCarthy and was regarded at the time as second high-level programming language to pass into mainstream use, following FORTRAN. Lisp was designed to provide a practical mathematical notation for computer programming. It’s name is derived an amalgam of “LISt Processing language”.\n\n1977 – Commodore PET 2001\n\nThe Commodore PET 2001 is unveiled. The computer is Commodore’s first full-featured computer, at the West Coast Computer Faire. The PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) includes a MOS Technology 6502 processor, 4KB RAM, 14KB ROM, a built-in keyboard, a 9-inch monochrome display, and a cassette tape drive. On the same day, Apple introduce the Apple II computer, their first micro-computer.\n\nImages: Wikipedia"
