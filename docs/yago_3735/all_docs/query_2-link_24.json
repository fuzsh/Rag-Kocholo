        "text": "John McCarthy is a pioneer of AI, or artificial intelligence, and a popular computer scientist. He made enormous contributions to mathematics and computer science and made significant inventions in the fields of artificial intelligence and interactive computing systems.\n\nEarly life\n\nMcCarthy was born in 1927 in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Patrick McCarthy, was a Catholic who became a labor organizer and business manager of the Daily Worker, a national newspaper owned by the Communist Party of the USA.\n\nJohn’s mother, Glatt, was a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant who worked in the wire service as a daily worker and later as a social worker.\n\nHis family and John lived through the Great Depression during the 1930s. The recession caused them to move to Los Angeles. His excellence became quite evident even though his health prevented him from studying.\n\nJohn was self-taught throughout his academic life. When health permitted, John entered public school and skipped several grades due to his self-study.\n\nBeing a sickly child, John turned to reading books for comfort. Eventually, his family changed in hopes that his health would improve.\n\nAlthough this happened, and he also proved to be a prodigious scholar, skipping three grades in 1944, he entered the California Institute of Technology.\n\nDespite the fact that he took some time off from his schooling for a number of reasons, including his army duty as a clerk, John graduated 4 years later with a degree in mathematics.\n\nEducation\n\nIn 1948, John received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, and later, in 1951, he received a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University. Between the years 1955 and 1958, he held professorships at Dartmouth College; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1958–62, where he worked on the earliest time-sharing systems; and later, between 1953 and 1962, at Stanford University, he founded SAIL, or Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, which was the main center for research in this field.\n\nAlthough he started in mathematics, he joined the new computer science department in 1963 at Stanford and remained there until his retirement.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDr. John McCarthy was married three times. Vera Watson was his second wife and also a member of the American Women’s Himalayan Expedition. She died in a climbing accident that happened in 1978 in Annapurna.\n\nBesides Sarah and California, he is survived by his wife, Carolyn Talcott, another daughter, Susan, of San Francisco, and a son, Timothy.\n\nHe remained an independent thinker throughout his life. A few years before, his daughters had given him the license plate bearing his favorite proverb: “Do the math or be condemned to talk nonsense.”\n\ncareer\n\nDr. John’s career followed the arc of current computing. John was responsible for the seminal advances in this field and is often called the father of computer time-sharing, which was a major development of the 1960s that enabled many people and companies to draw from one single computer, like a mainframe, without having one.\n\nReducing costs made it possible for many people to use computers and laid the foundation for interactive computing.\n\nAlthough he did not foresee the rise of the personal computer, John was prophetic in describing the consequences of various technological advances years before they gained currency.\n\nIn the 1970s, he presented one paper in France on computer buying and selling, now called electronic trading.\n\nAnd when it comes to studying artificial intelligence, no one is more influential than McCarthy.\n\nWhile teaching mathematics in 1956 at Dartmouth, Dr. John was also the organizer of Dartmouth’s first artificial intelligence conference.\n\nHis idea for an intelligence character has been debated for years, but the term “artificial intelligence” — originally used to help raise money to support conferences — stuck.\n\nDr. John moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958, and there, with Marvin Minsky, he founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nIt was at MIT that he began work on List Processing Language (Lisp), a programming language that became a standard tool for artificial intelligence research and design.\n\nEvolution of AI\n\nDuring the summer of 1956, John began working on a program that would help a computer play chess. To limit his possible moves and speed up this game, John developed the method known as alpha-beta heuristics, which effectively allows the computer to eliminate moves that would benefit the opponent.\n\nThis was the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), a term John coined that year while organizing the first conference on models of intelligence in computers.\n\nJohn became an associate professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958 and established his first artificial intelligence laboratory there. He started to create a computer language that would be called List Processing Language, or LISP.\n\nIt remains a common language, especially in artificial intelligence research. While at MIT, John began to develop different ways of sharing time on computers that would enable networking simply by allowing multiple people to share their data on the same large computer.\n\nBesides, he initiated work on the idea of giving computers “common sense”, an idea that would baffle programmers for years.\n\nAI achievements\n\nProgramming languages, the Internet, the Internet, and robots are some of the technological innovations that McCarthy paved the way to. He coined the term “artificial intelligence”, wrote the first computer language for symbolic computation, LISP (which is still today the most preferred language in AI), and founded timesharing.\n\nHuman-level AI and common sense were his main contributions in this field. Furthermore, Dr. John has written many papers on the theories of various computations that are the foundation of software science today.\n\nIn the field of engineering, he proposed some basic concepts of the time-sharing system and was also involved in its development.\n\nThe work paved the way for the development of computers on a large scale today.\n\nBesides his academic contributions, Dr. John established his first artificial intelligence research project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was also the founder of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory."
