After 1962, the development of LISP became multi-stranded, and different ideas were pursued in different places.\n\nThis paper was presented at the ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference, June 1-3, 1978. It was pubished in History of Programming Languages, edited by Richard Wexelblat, Academic Press 1981. At the time, there was essentially no challenge to my memory ."
