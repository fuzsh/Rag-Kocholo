Addressing public safety, capital improvements and the property tax rate will be priority issues for the next Greenacres City Council.

Because of his experience, The Post endorses incumbent Councilman John Tharp to keep his District 1 seat. Tharp, 43, was appointed to the council in 2011 to fill the vacancy left when Richard Radcliffe resigned.

Since then, Tharp — who was then elected in 2013 — has been a strong voice for fiscal responsibility and stability on the council. “I always try to ask, ‘How much will this cost me,’ from a resident’s perspective,” Tharp told The Post Editorial Board. “We’re in a good fiscal position now, so we can continue doing more to address the city’s needs.”

He said, for example, the city has added several more full-time positions in the Public Safety Department this year, “and I think folks feel safe because we have incredible response times. But crime is an issue, and we still need to grow our staff.”

His opponent, 47-year-old Lisa Rivera, is a school treasurer and political neophyte who wants the city to address what she considers rampant code enforcement issues and a lack of identity. But while she is passionate about the city, Rivera would benefit from some time on an advisory committee to get a closer view of how the city’s government works.
