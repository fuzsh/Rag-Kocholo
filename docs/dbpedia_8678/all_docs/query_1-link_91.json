He married Elizabeth Jordan. Abt 1750 they migrated to Murderkill Hundred, Kent Co., on the Delaware {River} where he had been granted 180 acres of land. (John, along with his brother William, had sold their land in Talbot Co, Maryland in 1750). John and William were on the Murderkill Tax List in 1751. John then moved to Mispillion Hundred, Kent upon Delaware in 1756 as shown by the Tax List. [1]\n\nSome researchers find his last Tax list mention in 1764 in Mispillion Hd., Kent upon Delaware and give 1764 as his death date but it is likely that he is the John Tharp (Sr.) in the Baltimore Hd., Sussex Co. Delaware 1782 Tax List, [2]\n\nJohn remarried to a Mary Unknown probably in Baltimore Hd., Sussex Co. Delaware as she is the adminx. of his Sussex Co. Will and was living near daughter Ruth who had married Benjamin Long of that place.\n\nJohn Tharp's Inferred death place was Delaware as his probate was in Sussex, Delaware; administration of estate was assigned to Mary Tharp July 4, 1790. (Note: this must be estate of John Sr. because his son John (b1756) married Leah Morris, and relocated to North Carolina, then Indiana.) [3]\n\nThe Wikipedia account of the William Tharp who became a governor of Delaware confirms this relocation: \"Tharp was born in Farmington, Delaware, the son of James and Eunice Fleming Tharp. His great grandfather had settled near Frankford, Delaware in 1735.\" except the year is suspect.
