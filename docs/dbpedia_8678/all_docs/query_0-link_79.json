        "text": "TILER PECK (Curator, Dancer, & Choreographer) (Curator, Dancer, & Choreographer) Regarded as a “dance luminary” (Washington Post), “pure joy in toe shoes” (Los Angeles Times) and “the ballerina who can stop time (and re-start it too)” (New York Times), Tiler Peck is widely recognized as one of the top American ballerinas of our time. A Principal Dancer with New York City Ballet (NYCB), an actress, choreographer, author and designer, Peck continues to evolve as an artist and add to her extensive repertoire.\n\nIn May of 2022, Peck curated and directed the highly anticipated inaugural Artists at the Center for New York City Center, and has since developed the program into the critically acclaimed show, Turn it Out with Tiler Peck and Friends. The program, which features premieres from William Forsythe, Alonzo King, Jillian Meyers and Michelle Dorrance, enjoyed a sold-out world premiere in New York City and a European debut in London at the prestigious Sadler’s Wells Theatre. Now, Tiler is excited to be touring the show in her home state of California.\n\nLast month, Peck had choreographic premieres at Northern Ballet in Leeds and at Cincinnati Ballet and is making her first ballet for New York City Ballet this February.\n\nTiler added the title of curator when she launched and starred in the Los Angeles Music Center’s presentation of BalletNOW. She was the subject of the Hulu feature documentary, Ballet Now, and also choreographed the box office smash action movie, John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. She performed with Josh Groban at Radio City Music Hall in a special streamed later on PBS, she appeared in Season 7 of Ray Donovan opposite Liev Shreiber and the Netflix series Tiny Pretty Things, and was the first ballerina ever to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Tiler also guested on Dancing with the Stars for three seasons and on Julie Andrews’ Netflix series, Julie’s Greenroom, and starred in the film Ballet 422.\n\nBorn in Bakersfield, California, Tiler began her dance training at the age of two at her mom’s dance studio. At 14, she entered the School of American Ballet. The same year, she became an apprentice with NYCB and within a few months was asked to join the corps de ballet. Tiler was promoted to Soloist in 2006 and to Principal Dancer in 2009.\n\nAt 11, Tiler made her Broadway debut in The Music Man and next appeared on Broadway as Ivy Smith in the Tony-nominated On The Town. She played Louise in the Emmy-nominated production of Carousel (New York Philharmonic, Live From Lincoln Center) and more recently played the title role in Susan Stroman’s musical, Little Dancer (Kennedy Center). She is due to star in the production on Broadway.\n\nTiler had the honor of performing for President Obama at the 2012 and 2014 Kennedy Center Honors. She was the 2004 Mae L Wien Award winner, the Janice Levin Honoree for 2006-2007, winner of the Léonide Massine’s Positano Premia La Danza for International Emerging Artists and a 2004 recipient of a Princess Grace Foundation–USA Dance Fellowship. In 2013, she was named in Forbes 30 under 30 in Hollywood Entertainment and won the Princess Grace Statue Award. She also received the 2016 Dance Magazine Award. Tiler developed and produced a daily ballet class, #TurnItOutWithTiler, initially aimed at helping people stay connected and moving during the pandemic. The show’s down to earth tone coupled with its very necessary purpose attracted the attention of enthusiasts like Jennifer Garner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Leslie Odom Jr and Josh Groban, who all guested on the show.\n\nHer first children’s book, Katarina Ballerina (Simon & Schuster) was published in 2020, and Katarina’s adventures continue in Katarina Ballerina & The Victory Dance (2022), where she helps a fellow ballet dancer follow his dreams.\n\nWith a passion and keen eye for fashion, Tiler recently launched the “Love, Tiler” collection with Só Dança and designed the capsule collection, Tiler Peck X STATESIDE, in collaboration with the popular Los Angeles-based womenswear line. Her second capsule collection for STATESIDE released in early 2023."
