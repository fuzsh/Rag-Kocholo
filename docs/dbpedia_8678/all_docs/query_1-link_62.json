        "text": "Resources for Jamaican Research:\n\nThe Tharp Papers\n\nCourtesy of the Cambridge County Records through the kind efforts of Edward Crawford of the U.K.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Tharp estates records are one of the few that have survived for 18th century Jamaica. The reason for this was a prolonged lawsuit involving the Tharp family in the nineteenth century. In brief the original entrepreneur, John Tharp, disinherited his children .in a family quarrel and left most of his property to his baby grandson but alas the latter turned out to be mentally handicapped. Attempts by a variety of people to get hold of the money lead to a horrendous lawsuit of the Jarndyce v Jarndyce variety. Happily this has preserved the records. A Tharp descendant still lives in their Cambridgeshire country house I am told.\n\nAccess\n\nThe Tharp papers can be found at the Cambridge County Records, Castle Court, Shire Hall, Castle Hill, Cambridge, CB3 OAP, England, UK. To find it you leave the Cambridge of the colleges and sightseers north west by the Magdalen Bridge and go about 150 200 yards up the hill. At the top on the right is the large County Hall administrative building where the reception will direct you.\n\nThe email address is [email protected]\n\nThe County Archivist, Cambridgeshire County Council, is Dr Philip Saunders, Tel. No. (UK) 01223 717281\n\nIn 1998 photocopying charges were £2 a page by mail, 25p if you were on the premises Last year, the research fees were quoted as £12.00 for the first half hour, £9.00 for subsequent half hours up to a 2 hour maximum search There is a short pamphlet, Good Hope: Jamaica, a short history by Patrick J. Tenison, published in Jamaica 1971 that gives some details of one of these estates.\n\nEdward Crawford\n\nTharp estates in Jamaica 1670-1870\n\nNote\n\nOften the English and Jamaican estates are considered together in the High Court of Chancery. Therefore some further information about the estates will be found under:- R.55.7.106-119\n\nNotes that have added by the library in manuscript to the original typescript index are enclosed in brackets thus {1809}. ERC 1998}\n\nOnly the number (and letter) on the left hand side of the slip are essential for a proper reference. The slip number, which runs with each group of records with the title, is not part of the document reference and the bundle numbers of deeds are now redundant. e.g. R55.7.122(a) id the feoffment of 1000 acres in St James Parish to Thos Williams R.55.7.128(i) is Produce returns from Jamaica estates etc.\n\nStart of Index\n\nR.55.7.5.21.
