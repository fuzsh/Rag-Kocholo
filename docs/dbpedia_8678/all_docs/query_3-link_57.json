        "text": "Isabelle Tharp, a fourth-year student pharmacist in the Drake University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS), was named one of three finalists for the 2021 Next-Generation Future Pharmacist Award sponsored by Parata Systems and Pharmacy Times. The winner will be announced during the Next-Generation Pharmacists Award Gala held on October 8 in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe national Next Generation Pharmacist™ awards program honors pharmacists, technicians, students and industry advocates in 11 categories who are defining the future of pharmacy. The Future Pharmacist Award is given to a student pharmacist who demonstrates spirit and passion for the profession of pharmacy through a combination of academic achievement and evidence of industry advocacy, patient advocacy, technology innovation, or civic leadership/environmental stewardship to the profession.\n\nTharp, originally from Dubuque, Iowa, has built an impressive record of leadership and advocacy as a Drake student pharmacist. Tharp is a past president of the American Pharmacists Association – Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP), and previously served as president-elect, social media chair, and on the Generation Rx Committee. Through her involvement in APhA-ASP, Tharp has attended several regional and national events, competed as a top ten finalist of 125 students in the National Patient Counseling Competition, was awarded an APhA Foundation Scholarship, and was selected as the 2021 APhA Good Government Student Pharmacist-of-the Year.\n\nTharp’s commitment to advocating for the pharmacy profession and needs of patients is also exemplified by her service as a former legislative intern for Iowa State Representative John Forbes, PH’80. Besides her involvement in APhA-ASP, Tharp is a member of Phi Lambda Sigma, a pharmacy leadership society. She was also a 2021 recipient of the C. Boyd Granberg Student Excellence Award for her leadership, academic achievements, and involvement in student organizations.\n\n“This is a well-deserved honor for Isabelle and recognizes her leadership and outstanding work,” said Renae Chesnut, dean and professor of the College. “Our college’s outstanding record over the past 12 years in this award is a testament to the opportunities that Drake students have to develop outstanding leadership skills and make an impact on our community.”\n\nThe CPHS has a stellar record in the Next-Generation Future Pharmacist Award with more finalists and winners than any other college/school of pharmacy. Previous finalists (and winners) include:\n\n2010 – Kathryn McDonald Starbuck\n\n2012 – Huy Nguyen\n\n2013 – Natalie Schmitz\n\n2014 – Laura Vollmer (winner)\n\n2015 – Natalie Roy\n\n2018 – Matt Glasow (winner)\n\n2019 – Drake Reiter (winner)\n\n2021 – Isabelle Tharp\n\nAbout the Next-Gen Pharmacist™ Awards\n\nSponsored by Parata Systems and Pharmacy Times, this national awards program honors pharmacists, technicians, students and industry advocates who are defining the future of pharmacy. More than 200 pharmacy leaders have been named finalists or winners since 2010. An independent panel of judges evaluates all entries for adherence to professional standards, experience as it relates to each category, and advancement of the profession. The three highest-scoring entries in each category are named finalists, and the top-scoring entry is named the category winner."
