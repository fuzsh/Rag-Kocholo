Notably, this announcement included the first off-channel communication case brought by the SEC as a result of a referral from an RIA exam, which could lead examiners to focus on off-channel communications during regular RIA examinations.\n\nAlso in industry news this week:\n\nFidelity and Advyzon are teaming up to offer RIAs a combined custodial platform-AdvisorTech bundle aimed at smaller RIAs, though its unclear whether Fidelity will take on some of the smallest firms\n\nA report indicates that RIA M&A grew in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2023, with new firms joining the list of top acquirers and buyers looking to acquire larger firms\n\nFrom there, we have several articles on retirement:\n\nWhy retirement is not just a one-time transition, but a series of opportunities to adjust one's priorities, both financial and personal, and how advisors can help clients navigate them\n\nHow one retiree found a sense of purpose (and why he sold his ego-boosting sports car) after a sudden, unexpected retirement\n\nHow sabbaticals during one's working years can serve as helpful 'previews' for how an individual wants to structure their retirement\n\nWe also have a number of articles on advisor marketing:\n\nHow a \"zero-click\" social media strategy can boost an advisor's visibility and credibility\n\nWhy some advisors are turning to in-person events amidst a surge of interest in digital marketing\n\nHow \"marketing channel harmony\" can help advisors increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing messages\n\nWe wrap up with 3 final articles, all about fame:\n\nThe difference between fame and influence, and why the latter might be preferable for advisors and others\n\nWhy famous individuals are often scammed by those they trust the most, and how advisors can help clients of all types avoid some of these schemes\n\nAn exploration of the psychology of fame-seeking, and why those who prioritize it can experience more mental stress than those with more internally focused goals\n\nEnjoy the 'light' reading!\n\nRead More...\n\nA common concern many individuals have when contemplating retirement spending is that they may live longer than expected and thus risk outliving their money. This sentiment can lead advisors to build financial plans based on the conservative assumption that clients will live a very long time. Yet, while a longer plan will extend the longevity of the portfolio, it also relies on lower annual portfolio withdrawals. For couples, it becomes crucial to consider other income sources, such as Social Security benefits, annuities, and pensions, that may be reduced or eliminated when one spouse dies. The loss of these additional income streams by one spouse can create a significant mortality risk for the surviving spouse, potentially leaving them with less income than expected. Which means that plans that anticipate both members of a couple living to the same (very old) age might overlook the mortality risk of one spouse dying earlier than planned, which can significantly influence the surviving spouse’s sources of income and overall financial situation.\n\nTo manage these potential outcomes, advisors can use a more rigorous process to account for and manage both longevity and mortality risk. For example, advisors can calculate a client's spending capacity using expected mortality-adjusted cashflows to manage mortality risk. Rather than giving a plan 'credit' for all non-portfolio income that would be received if clients live to their projected date of death, advisors can instead average out the non-portfolio income that a couple would receive across a wide range of mortality assumptions based on statistical probabilities that treat death as variable and uncertain. Using a comprehensive approach to examine a client's mortality risks can be an opportunity for the advisor to highlight potential pain points and vulnerabilities and offer clients a strategy to plan for them.\n\nIn addition to examining the factors that shape mortality risk, advisors can also weigh several factors when assessing a client's longevity risk, from demographic trends (e.g., projecting life expectancy based on the client’s sex and affluence) to health and family history and even to the client's own tolerance for longevity risk. Advisors can establish a systematic process to adjust and optimize plans for longevity, customizing the plan length for clients beyond choosing arbitrary default age settings in their planning software packages.\n\nUltimately, the key point is that creating a plan based on how long a client will live is most effective when both mortality and longevity risk factors are considered. Actuarial science offers tools that can help advisors assess these considerations so that they can adjust mortality assumptions and longevity expectations as part of an ongoing process of monitoring and updating a plan. And by making these adjustments collaboratively and regularly, advisors can help clients develop a relevant and realistic strategy to manage their mortality and longevity risks as they journey into retirement!\n\nRead More...\n\nWelcome everyone! Welcome to the 398th episode of the Financial Advisor Success Podcast!\n\nMy guest on today's podcast is Eric Wulff. Eric is the CEO of Marcum Wealth, an RIA based in Cleveland, Ohio, that oversees $2.5 billion in assets under management for approximately 2,700 client households.\n\nWhat's unique about Eric, though, is how he has built Marcum Wealth into a multi-billion-dollar firm under the umbrella of a national accounting firm, in large part by cultivating mutually beneficial relationships with the firm's internal CPAs to get them comfortable providing referrals of their accounting clients to his financial planning business.\n\nIn this episode, we talk in-depth about Eric's process for generating internal referrals from the accounting firm's CPAs, which do not necessarily come automatically despite the affiliation between the accounting firm and his RIA, how Eric's firm takes a \"give to get\" approach with CPAs and their accounting clients to demonstrate the value it can offer both them and their clients (so that advisors in his firm are top of mind when accounting clients have questions on financial planning topics or face a life transition), and how Eric's firm's exit planning services in particular have been able to drive referrals by helping the accounting firm's CPAs maintain their long-term relationships with their business-owner clients as the owners plan to monetize their businesses, encouraging a continued relationship between that client and the financial advisor and CPA when they sell their company (and may no longer need traditional business accounting services anymore).\n\nWe also talk about how Eric has created a systematized planning process to create a common standard across its multiple advisor offices nationwide, how Eric's firm uses a centralized planning team to prepare financial plans in a consistent manner (and to allow its advisors to spend more time working directly with clients), and how Eric has found success presenting financial plans to prospects before they become clients, despite the unpaid work upfront that it takes to prepare and present them, as it shows the prospects specifically how Marcum Wealth can meet their planning needs and encourages them to start an ongoing planning relationship to implement the planning recommendations.\n\nAnd be certain to listen to the end, where Eric discusses the key differences between CPA firms and RIAs, particularly the contrast between the goal of CPAs to maximize the efficiency of their billable hours and the more long-term client relationship-building done by financial advisors, how Eric approaches acquisitions, targeting younger or mid-career advisors who want to grow and develop their practice within the local office of the CPA firm (rather than approaching retiring firm owners for acquisition as they exit), and how Eric's firm not only survived the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which occurred less than 2 years after he opened Marcum Wealth, but was able to use it as a growth engine for the firm as the Wall Street implosion led more consumers to begin showing a preference for the benefits of the RIA model for financial advice instead.\n\nSo, whether you're interested in learning about cultivating client referrals from CPA firms, leveraging a centralized planning team to give advisors more time to spend with clients, or systematizing the planning process to create consistent standards across multiple offices, then we hope you enjoy this episode of the Financial Advisor Success podcast, with Eric Wulff.\n\nRead More...\n\nIn the modern era of financial advice, the advicer/client relationship is tightly centered on trust. And because of that foundation of trust, in an ideal advisor/client relationship, mistakes, disagreements, and concerns are surfaced quickly; action items are agreed and acted upon by everyone involved; and everyone feels aligned and accountable to their overall objectives.\n\nThe reality, however, can be a little more complicated – not only when it comes to getting clients to ask questions, give honest feedback, and raise (productive) disagreements; but also to get everyone truly aligned on (and excited about) action items and objectives. This can be frustrating for advisors: after all, clients are paying for advice, but if they never really seem 'bought into' that advice and don't act on recommendations, it can be hard for the advisor to feel like they've provided much value to the relationship.\n\nIn his book \"The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team\", Patrick Lencioni discusses similar issues that commonly occur among teams in the workplace. He posits that teams can suffer from a series of 5 \"dysfunctions\" which inhibits a team's ability to align on objectives, act on them, and actually track and discuss the results. Dysfunction in teams can be insidious – the vast majority of people in the workplace are well-intentioned and don't intentionally sow dysfunction. However, even well-meaning people can occasionally contribute to dysfunctional relationships, teams, and company cultures.\n\nIn the book, Lencioni gives insights into how dysfunction can be rooted out of a workplace – many of which can also be applied to the client/advisor relationship, where well-meaning clients and advisors can on occasion contribute to a dysfunctional relationship. As an example, a dysfunctional client/advisor relationship can look like one where the client doesn't bring forward their \"true\" issues to a meeting, or where they have reservations about an advisor's recommendations but feel hesitant to express them to the advisor. Then, because the client isn't \"bought in\" to the recommendations, they simply don't act on what the advisor recommends.\n\nThe good news is that dysfunction isn't necessarily permanent – in fact, it can be improved upon or even resolved entirely. For advisors looking to resolve dysfunction, the first action item often comes with a candid conversation with a client centered on how the client feels the relationship is going, ranging from their comfort with bringing important issues to meetings to their alignment with the advisor on action items. Once an advisor understands not only where they see dysfunction themselves, but also where their client sees it, they can begin the work of uprooting and resolving it. Depending on the situation, this can involve exercises to rebuild trust or working with clients to name how they experience and work through conflict.\n\nOnce dysfunction in relationships is worked through and relationships become more functional, an advisor/client relationship can enter a positive feedback loop: clients bring what matters most to meetings, advisors present recommendations, reservations and questions are resolved in-meeting, everyone is aligned on what their actions are and why they matter, and implementation and results are tracked and celebrated. This then incentivizes clients to continue to bring issues forward, and reinforces an advisor's value many times over.\n\nUltimately, the key point is that few people intend to add dysfunction to relationships – it's something that runs the risk of creeping into client/advisor dynamics often because of good intentions. But the good news is that with proactive and mindful conversations, the advisor and client can not only resolve dysfunction, but in fact create a stronger dynamic than existed previously, where clients and advisors are constantly working through the issues that matter most!\n\nRead More...\n\nOver the past few decades, financial advisors have explored new ways to structure, build, and grow successful businesses alongside a growing acceptance that \"successful business\" can be defined in many different ways. Nevertheless, while firm owners have a variety of options available for structuring and building their businesses, the reality is that they can only prioritize a limited number of goals at one time, which then begs the question – how can firm owners navigate the options of work/life balance, margins, and firm growth to set and build their businesses to fit their goals?\n\nIn our 144th episode of Kitces & Carl, Michael Kitces and client communication expert Carl Richards discuss how advisors can navigate the \"calculus\" between growth, time, and margins to define success on their own terms, then build a firm to fit their vision.\n\nWhile \"success\" for an advisory firm can mean several different things, certain commonalities continue to crop up as firms develop: namely, that not all types of growth are possible at once. In the quest to develop and individualize their businesses, advisory firm owners eventually reach a crossroads where they must choose amongst the continual fast growth of the firm, high margins, and the amount of time an advisor puts into the business. And while some firms strive to have all 3 of these features, the reality often comes down to \"choosing 2\" (e.g., an advisor can have high margins and high growth, but it's extremely difficult to do so while also working a low number of hours).\n\nThis \"choose 2\" dynamic lends itself to 3 kinds of advisory firm owners: enterprise firm owners, who maintain high margins and high growth, but put in longer hours to maintain both of those goals; lifestyle firm owners, who can put in fewer hours with higher margins, but sacrifice high growth to ensure they don't exceed their own capacity; and boutique firm owners, who have high growth and work fewer hours at the cost of lower margins – often because they are more mission- and purpose-driven, and thus may choose business initiatives that are less-focused on 'optimized' business growth.\n\nUltimately, the key point is that while there are many ways to build an advisory firm, there is no standard definition of 'success', which means that it's up to firm owners to decide which metrics they want to prioritize in order to build the type of firm that matches their personal and professional goals!\n\nRead More..."
