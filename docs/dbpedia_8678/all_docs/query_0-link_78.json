        "text": "We’re a week into the Biden Administration, and, so far, things are off to a slow start, at least on the confirmation front. Unlike the relatively swift pace of confirmations that kicked off the Bush and Obama Administrations, the Senate has, thus far, confirmed just four nominations, matching the pace set under President Trump. What has moved fast, in contrast, is the pace of judicial vacancies, as a total of 17 federal judges (1 circuit; 16 district) have either moved to senior status or announced their departures in the past week. With the number of judicial vacancies growing rapidly, it’s worth asking when the White House will start nominating judges.\n\nThe process before a nominee is sent to the senate is fairly extensive. For district court judges, it typically starts with a recommendation made by a home-state senator or representative. Some senators will solicit applications through a public process, while others recommend based on references or pre-existing relationships. The Biden Administration has instructed Democratic Senators to submit recommendations for existing vacancies by January 19. While not many senators have met that deadline, it’s safe to say the White House has at least a few names to begin considering.\n\nAfter the recommendation, the nominee is submitted to the Department of Justice for vetting, where the Office of Legal Policy reviews the nominee’s background, character, and experience. This process can be lengthier or shorter depending on the nominee, but will typically take at least a few weeks. Simultaneous to this process, the nominee will also undergo review by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIf multiple candidates for a vacancy go through the vetting process, the White House must select who will be the primary candidate. Assuming that no issues have arisen during the vetting process, the nominee can then be formally announced and submitted to the Senate.\n\nOne wrinkle is that most Administrations (barring only the second Bush and the Trump Administrations) would submit their nominees to the ABA for evaluation before sending the nominee to the Senate. The Biden Administration, to my knowledge, has not made any announcement as to whether they will participate in the ABA pre-nomination vetting process. If they do so, the ABA process can further delay a nomination being sent to the Senate. Even if they don’t, the process is still likely to take a couple of months, at the fastest.\n\nIn other words, assuming senators have complied with the White House’s request and have submitted their recommendations by January 19, we can expect nominees coming out in March and April.\n\nWhile this may seem like a long time, March is actually relatively fast for Presidents to nominate their first judges. President Carter nominated his first district court judge on March 29th of his first year, and his first appellate nominee on August 16. President Reagan’s first nominees hit the Senate on July 1st of his first year, and, while President George H.W. Bush renominated a few of his predecessor’s picks in February, he did not make his own nominations until August 4. Similarly, President Clinton’s first lower court nominations were made on August 6 of his first year. President George W. Bush got out his first nominees in May, while President Trump got his first appellate nominee, Judge Amul Thapar, to the Senate on March 21, 2017. Surprisingly, despite criticism for the slowness of his nomination pace, President Obama got his first nominee to the Senate the fastest in modern history, nominating Judge David Hamilton to the Seventh Circuit on March 17, 2009.\n\nNonetheless, it’s possible that President Biden’s appellate nominees may be announced sooner, as the vetting process on them may have begun before January 19. As such, depending on the vetting process, we may well see some nominees to the appellate seats as early as mid to late February.\n\nAt the end of 2020, as the 116th Congress came to an end, it sent back around thirty judicial nominations unconfirmed to President Trump. Now, as the Biden Administration prepares to take office, it faces a critical question: how many of them, if any, should they renominate to the federal bench.\n\nThis is a question facing every incoming Administration, as the old one almost inevitably leaves some judicial nominees unconfirmed. While putting forward nominees from the prior administration can help with judicial dealmaking and efficiency, it also risks upsetting the President’s base. So far, no Administration has chosen to renominate all of their predecessor’s pending judges, instead making that determination on an ad hoc basis.\n\nJohnson to Nixon\n\nAt the end of the Johnson Administration, for example, two Supreme Court nominees (Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice; and Homer Thornberry to be Associate Justice); one circuit court nominee (Barefoot Sanders for the D.C. Circuit); and three district court nominees (David Bress to District Court for the District of Columbia; Cecil Poole to the Northern District of California; William Byrne to the Central District of California) were left unconfirmed. President Nixon chose not to renominate any of the Johnson holdovers at the outset of his Administration, instead picking the following:\n\nJudge Warren Burger to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\n\nGeorge MacKinnon to the D.C. Circuit\n\nBarrington Daniels Parker to the District Court for D.C.\n\nJudge Gerald Levin to the Northern District of California\n\nJudge David Williams to the Central District of California\n\nHowever, in 1971, Nixon did choose to nominate Byrne to a different seat on the Central District of California, where he served until his death in 2006.\n\nFord to Carter\n\nFor his part, after the resignation of Nixon, President Ford largely maintained the same nominees. However, after his own loss in 1976, Ford had two appellate nominees and eight district court nominees pending before the U.S. Senate. President Carter chose not to renominate any of the ten. However, he did later nominate Richard Bilby, who Ford had unsuccessfully put up for a Ninth Circuit seat, for the District of Arizona, where he served until his death in 1998.\n\nCarter to Reagan\n\nAt the end of the Carter Administration, the Senate left four appellate nominees and twelve district court nominees pending. On January 1, 1981, Carter appointed one of the pending nominees, Judge Walter Heen, to the District of Hawaii using a recess appointment. For his part, President Reagan declined to renominate Heen, letting his appointment expire at the end of the year. He did, however, renominate two other judges:\n\nI. Leo Glasser for the Eastern District of New York\n\nJohn Sprizzo for the Southern District of New York\n\nReagan to Bush\n\nPerhaps because it was a transition between two Presidents of the same party, President George H.W. Bush was more open to renominating his predecessor’s nominees. At the end of his term, President Reagan left seven appellate nominees pending:\n\nJudith Richards Hope for the D.C. Circuit\n\nStuart Summit for the Second Circuit\n\nJacques Wiener for the Fifth Circuit\n\nFerdinand Francis Fernandez for the Ninth Circuit\n\nPamela Rymer for the Ninth Circuit\n\nGuy Hurlbutt for the Ninth Circuit\n\nSusan Leibeler for the Federal Circuit\n\nBush chose to renominate three of the seven (Wiener; Fernandez; and Rymer), who were all confirmed. To fill the other seats, Bush chose Clarence Thomas, John Walker, Thomas Nelson, and Jay Plager respectively.\n\nReagan also left ten district court nominees pending:\n\nHoward Levitt for the Eastern District of New York\n\nJames McGregor for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nAdriane Dudley for the Virgin Islands\n\nMarvin Garbis for the District of Maryland\n\nShannon Mason for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\nMelinda Harmon for the Southern District of Texas\n\nRobert Bonner for the Central District of California\n\nVaughn Walker for the Northern District of California\n\nWilliam Erickson for the District of Colorado\n\nDonald Abram for the District of Colorado\n\nOf those ten, Bush chose to renominate five (Garbis; Dudley; Harmon; Bonner; Walker). All of them except for Dudley were confirmed. For the other seats, Bush nominated the following:\n\nCarol Amon for the Eastern District of New York\n\nDonald Lee for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nRebecca Beach Smith for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\nDaniel Sparr for the District of Colorado\n\nEdward Nottingham for the District o Colorado\n\nBush also chose to renominate McGregor to a different seat on the Western District of Pennsylvania in 1990, where he was ultimately blocked by conservative opposition.\n\nBush to Clinton\n\nAt the conclusion of the Bush Administration, ten appellate nominees and forty two district court nominees were left unconfirmed, a significantly higher number than previous Administrations. Of these fifty two nominees, President Clinton renominated none of the appellate nominees and just two of the district court nominees.\n\nDavid Trager for the Eastern District of New York\n\nJoanna Seybert for the Eastern District of New York\n\nHowever, later in the Administration, Clinton nominated an additional two nominees from the leftover list to different seats.\n\nGeorge O’Toole for the District of Massachusetts\n\nRichard Casey for the Southern District of New York\n\nOf the remaining forty eight nominees not renominated under Clinton, thirteen were renominated for federal judgeships by President George W. Bush.\n\nJohn Roberts for the D.C. Circuit (subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court)\n\nFranklin Van Antwerpen for the Third Circuit\n\nJay Waldman for the Third Circuit (passed away before the Senate could act on the nomination)\n\nTerrence Boyle for the Fourth Circuit (never confirmed)\n\nCarlos Bea for the Ninth Circuit (Bea had been unsuccessfully nominated to the Northern District of California by H.W. Bush)\n\nWilliam Quarles for the District of Maryland\n\nLeonard Davis for the Eastern District of Texas\n\nAndrew Hanen for the Southern District of Texas\n\nPercy Anderson for the Central District of California\n\nJohn Walter for the Central District of California\n\nLarry Hicks for the District of Nevada\n\nRonald Leighton for the Western District of Washington\n\nJames Payne for the Northern District of Oklahoma (jointly with the Eastern and Western Districts)\n\nClinton to Bush\n\nSimilar to George H.W. Bush before him, President Clinton faced an opposition Senate through his final term, and thus, a number of his appellate and district court nominees were left unconfirmed at the end of his term. Specifically, the Senate did not process seventeen appellate nominees and twenty four district court nominees before the end of the 106th Congress. In response, President Clinton appointed one of his appellate nominees, Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit in a recess appointment.\n\nFor his part, George W. Bush renominated three of Clinton’s appointments. Specifically, Bush renominated:\n\nJudge Roger Gregory for the Fourth Circuit\n\nJudge Legrome Davis for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nJudge David Cercone for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, later in his tenure, President Bush renominated an additional two stalled Clinton appellate nominees as part of an agreement with Democrats:\n\nJudge Helene White for the Sixth Circuit\n\nJudge Christine Arguello for the Tenth Circuit (nominated to the District of Colorado)\n\nBush to Obama\n\nAt the end of the Bush Administration, the Senate left ten appellate and twenty district court nominees unconfirmed. Of the thirty pending nominees, President Obama renominated just one: Marco Hernandez for the District of Oregon.\n\nHowever, later in his Administration, Obama nominated another two of the stalled Bush nominees to the federal bench:\n\nJudge John Tharp for the Northern District of Illinois\n\nWilliam Jung for the Middle District of Florida (never confirmed)\n\nIncidentally, Obama also renominated three stalled Clinton appointees:\n\nJudge Andre Davis for the Fourth Circuit\n\nJudge James Wynn for the Fourth Circuit\n\nJudge Dolly Gee for the Central District of California\n\nObama to Trump\n\nDue to a dramatic slowdown of confirmations in the last two years of his Presidency, President Obama saw 59 judicial nominees left pending before the Senate, more than any other President in recent history. This list included one nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, seven to the courts of appeal, and forty four nominees to the district courts.\n\nOver the course of his term, President Trump renominated sixteen of these nominees, more than any other president in the last fifty years. Specifically, he renominated:\n\nJudge Mary McElroy for the District of Rhode Island\n\nJudge Gary Brown for the Eastern District of New York\n\nDiane Gujarati for the Eastern District of New York\n\nJudge John Milton Younge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nJudge Susan Paradise Baxter for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nJudge Marilyn Horan for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nJudge Robert Colville for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\nJudge Stephanie Gallagher for the District of Maryland\n\nDonald Coggins for the District of South Carolina\n\nKaren Gren Scholer for the Northern District of Texas (previously nominated to the Eastern District)\n\nJames Hendrix for the Northern District of Texas\n\nWalter Counts for the Western District of Texas\n\nDavid Nye for the District of Idaho\n\nKathleen O’Sullivan for the Western District of Washington (announced but withdrawn before confirmation)\n\nScott Palk for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nWilliam Jung for the Middle District of Florida\n\nTrump also renominated four nominees who stalled under President Bush (not including Jung who is accounted for above).\n\nThomas Marcelle for the Northern District of New York (never confirmed)\n\nColm Connolly for the District of Delaware\n\nThomas Farr for the Eastern District of North Carolina (never confirmed)\n\nDavid Novak for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\nTrump to Biden\n\nPresident Trump leaves office with twenty six unconfirmed judicial nominees, including one appellate nominee (Judge Raul Arias-Marxuach to the First Circuit); and 21 district court nominees. These nominees are largely focused on two states: New York, which has six pending nominees; and California, which has ten. Outside those two states, the remaining five unconfirmed district court picks are:\n\nJudge Barbara Jongbloed for the District of Connecticut\n\nJennifer Togliatti for the District of Nevada\n\nFred Federici for the District of New Mexico\n\nBrenda Saiz for the District of New Mexico\n\nEdmund LaCour for the Middle District of Alabama\n\nOf those five, three: Federici, Saiz, and LaCour, were blocked by Democratic home state senators, and, as such, would be unlikely to be renominated in a Biden Administration. Jongbloed is a Democrat chosen by Senators Blumenthal and Murphy who cleared the Judiciary Committee unanimously before stalling on the floor. However, she’s also 61 years old and relatively middle-of-the-road. Without a Republican Administration, it is more likely that the Senators push for a younger candidate rather than seeking to renominate Jongbloed. This leaves Togliatti as the most likely contender in this group for renomination.\n\nIn addition, the New York and California groups are packages that include a number of Democrats, who could all potentially be renominated. This includes:\n\nJennifer Rearden for the Southern District of New York\n\nHector Gonzalez for the Eastern District of New York\n\nJudge Steve Kim for the Central District of California\n\nJudge Sandy Leal for the Central District of California\n\nKnut Johnson for the Southern District of California\n\nShireen Matthews for the Southern District of California\n\nIn addition, Biden may look to the thirty five Obama nominees who were not renominated by Trump. Of those, many are likely too old to be considered for nomination today, but the following could be considered for current vacancies:\n\nInga Bernstein for the District of Massachusetts (Bernstein turns 60 this year so she may be passed over for a younger candidate)\n\nJulien Neals for the District of New Jersey (will almost certainly be renominated)\n\nAnne Traum for the District of Nevada (will likely be renominated)\n\nBeth Andrus, Kathleen O’Sullivan, and J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington (will likely be renominated)\n\nRegina Rodriguez for the District of Colorado\n\nAdditionally, the following could be considered for renomination if vacancies open:\n\nRebecca Ross Haywood for the Third Circuit\n\nJudge Lucy Koh for the Ninth Circuit or the Federal Circuit\n\nStephanie Finley for the Western District of Louisiana\n\nJudge E. Scott Frost for the Northern District of Texas\n\nJudge Irma Ramirez for the Northern District of Texas\n\nEdward Stanton for the Western District of Tennessee\n\nClare Connors for the District of Hawaii\n\nJudge Suzanne Mitchell for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nJudge Patricia Barksdale for the Middle District of Florida\n\nJudge Philip Lammens for the Northern or the Middle Districts of Florida\n\nAs a bottom line, every President since Nixon has renominated at least one of their predecessor’s failed nominees for the federal bench. As such, it would not be surprising to see at least a few unconfirmed nominees from the past two Administrations put forward again by President Biden.\n\nTo err on the side of understatement, this was an eventful week. From Democrats winning control of the U.S. Senate to violent insurrectionists temporarily seizing control of the U.S. Capitol to the U.S. Congress certifying the win of President-elect Biden to questions about the resignation or removal of President Trump, there has been plenty to focus on. As such, it is somewhat understandable that the selection of Judge Merrick Garland to be the next Attorney General of the United States has slipped under the radar to an extent. This selection would not only place a veteran of the Department back at its head, but it would give the incoming Administration a chance to add a new judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nAnd the Biden Administration is looking for these opportunities. After the Trump Administration’s historic successes in appointing judges to the federal bench, only 49 vacancies are currently open for the new administration to fill, significantly lower than the 114 that Trump inherited from President Obama. Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that more seats will open.\n\nAs we discussed, judges (particularly appellate judges) have started to become more strategic in their retirement announcements, with their potential successor playing some role in many of their decisions. There are currently sixty four appellate judges eligible for senior status, at least some of whom were waiting for Senate control to become fixed before making a decision whether to vacate their seats. Now that control has been decided, it wouldn’t be surprising to see announcements of vacancies in the coming months. Here are the appellate judges who are currently eligible for senior status (and those who would become eligible during the 117th Congress). If vacancies arise in the coming weeks, they are likely to come from this group.\n\n(All eligibility dates are approximate)\n\nD.C.
