James Pennewill\n\nWilliam Tharp was born November 27, 1803, and died January 1, 1865. He was the great grandson of John Tharp of Sussex county, England, who settled in Kent county, Delaware, in its early history, and his was one of the oldest families of the county. William Tharp had several children, who married and settled in the town of Milford and its vicinity, one of whom was Ruth, the mother of ex-Governor William T. Watson. He was born near Farmington in Kent county, and there resided at the time he was elected Governor. When elected Governor he moved to Milford, at which place he lived during the remainder of his life. He was defeated in 1844 for the office of Governor by Major Thomas Stockton, the Whig candidate, and among his supporters at this election was his grandfather, Beniah Fleming, who cast a ballot for his grandson, William Tharp. Some years before that time he was defeated by William Roe for the office of State Senator by a majority of one or two votes, and during his campaign against Stockton there was a song much used at political meetings by the opposite party, the chorus of which was in part as follows: \"How can he beat Stockton if he couldn't beat Roe, Hurrah for the Delaware soldier.\" Governor Stockton died during his term and William Tharp was elected to the office by the Democratic party of 1846. His Secretary of State was Daniel M. Bates of Kent county.\n\nGovernor Tharp was the owner of a large quantity of land, much of which was cleared up and improved under his own supervision, and he was regarded as a very successful and progressive farmer. He was considered a strong man naturally, and was a very substantial citizen. He was prominent and popular in his community, highly respected by his people, and his life was useful and successful.\n\n[Source: Delaware Governors, 1898] tr. by mkk\n\n* * * NEWS ITEMS * * *"
