After I got to know the team, I knew I could play a role in serving and growing their dealership network.\"\n\nTharp has joined Carmigo immediately following the launch of its wholesale platform - Carmigo Turn. He will be working alongside the company's product and marketing teams to bring the platform to new dealerships across the southeast, and use their feedback to shape its future offerings.\n\n\"John has joined our team at the perfect time,\" said Andrew Warmath, CEO and Co-Founder of Carmigo. \"We've already seen how Turn can help dealerships protect their profits and navigate a never-before-seen used car market.
