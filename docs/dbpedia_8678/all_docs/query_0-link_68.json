        "text": "Attorney General Phil Weiser\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser was sworn in as the State’s 39th Attorney General on January 8, 2019. As the state’s chief legal officer, Attorney General Weiser is committed to protecting the people of Colorado and building an innovative and collaborative organization that will address a range of statewide challenges, from addressing the opioid epidemic to improving our criminal justice system to protecting consumers to protecting our land, air, and water.\n\nAttorney General Weiser has dedicated his life to the law, justice, and public service. Before running for office, Weiser served as the Hatfield Professor of Law and Dean of the University of Colorado Law School, where he founded the Silicon Flatirons Center for Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship and co-chaired the Colorado Innovation Council.\n\nWeiser served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the U.S. Department of Justice and as Senior Advisor for Technology and Innovation in the Obama Administration’s National Economic Council. He served on President Obama’s Transition Team, overseeing the Federal Trade Commission and previously served in President Bill Clinton’s Department of Justice as senior counsel to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, advising on telecommunications matters.\n\nBefore his appointment at the Justice Department, Weiser served as a law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the United States Supreme Court and to Judge David Ebel at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe son and grandson of Holocaust survivors, Weiser is deeply committed to the American Dream and ensuring opportunity for all Coloradans. Weiser lives in Denver with his wife, Dr. Heidi Wald, and their two children.\n\nORDER OF THE COIF\n\nThe English Order of the Coif, an ancient and honored institution of the Common Law, was an association of distinguished lawyers from whose members the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas were appointed and who for centuries had the exclusive right to be barristers in that Court. Later, judges of the King’s Bench and the Exchequer were appointed from its members. The Order took its name from the coif, or cap, that all members wore. The American Order was formed in 1911 for the purpose of promoting scholarship among law students. Under the Order’s constitution, the top 10 percent of the graduating class of each school is eligible for membership.\n\nHONORARY ORDER OF THE COIF\n\nWe are pleased to honor Judge Regina M. Rodriguez ’88 as the 2023 Honorary Order of the Coif Recipient. Judge Rodriguez is the newest member of the Colorado federal district court bench. She was confirmed by the US Senate in June, 2021 and appointed by President Biden to the federal district court bench on July 1, 2021. Judge Rodriguez is a 1988 graduate of the University of Colorado School of Law, and she practiced as a trial attorney here in her home state of Colorado for over 30 years before joining the bench."
