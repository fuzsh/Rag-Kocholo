Tharp seen on the far left was a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office. He's now a partner at the Mayer Brown law firm.

There were extensive reviews of 46 potential applicants for the position. Kirk says Tharp stands out above the rest.

"John Tharp is a corruption fighter, he is a third generation Marine who has given birth to a fourth generation Marine as well, a family man, a father of three. I look forward to the vetting by the department of justice and hope to have the honor of being nominated by the president," Kirk said.

The Tharp recommendation now goes to the U.S. Senate for advice and consent. From there it goes to the White House where President Obama will decide whether to nominate him.
