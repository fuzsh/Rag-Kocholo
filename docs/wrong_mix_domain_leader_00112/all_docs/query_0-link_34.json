The subcommittee met at 2:30 p.m., in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John E. Sununu (chairman of the subcommittee), presiding. Present: Senators Sununu, Biden, and Bill Nelson. opening statement of senator john e. sununu Senator Sununu. Good afternoon and welcome to today's hearing of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Terrorism. Today we will examine the Broadcasting Board of Governors [BBG] and evaluate whether we have found the right media mix and media message in the Middle East, a region whose importance to our country we all know well. We will have two panels of distinguished witnesses. Panel one includes Mr. Tomlinson, Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors; Mr. Pattiz, Governor of the Broadcasting Board and Director of the Middle East Service; and Mr. Harb, News Director of Alhurra, the Middle East Television Network. Panel two includes Mr. Ford, Director of the International Affairs and Trade at the General Accounting Office; Dr. Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor of Peace at the University of Maryland; and former Ambassador Rugh of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. We also have Dr. Ghareeb, Adjunct Professor of Mideast History and Politics at American University. I want to thank all the panelists for being here today to talk about the new Government-funded Alhurra TV network, Radio Sawa, and all of the challenges of matching the media to the audience in the Middle East. To win the war on terrorism, we need to not only defeat terrorists in the field, we need to defeat their ideas, their anti-democratic, anti-freedom, and the anti-American message that they espouse around the world, and most particularly in the Middle East. Today we will examine a key tool in the war on terrorist attempts to spread hatred and intolerance, the Broadcasting Board of Governors and the Middle Eastern services, Alhurra satellite TV and Radio Sawa in particular. A free, open, and fair media is vital to a free nation and a lasting democratic process. The dissemination of facts and open discussion of ideas are essential to the functioning of free institutions. The Broadcasting Board of Governors plays a vital role in the promotion of our foreign policy because it promotes and sustains freedom and democracy by broadcasting accurate and objective news and information about the United States and the world to audiences overseas. The BBG supervises all U.S. Government-funded, non-military international broadcasting, in 54 languages to more than 100 markets worldwide. Its services include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting as well. In 2002, the BBG began broadcasting Radio Sawa to the Middle East, and in 2004, just 2 months ago, the BBG started its Alhurra satellite television broadcasts. The board's total 2004 budget for all activities is $590 million and for 2005 the request is just shy of $570 million. The BBG transmits news, information, and accurate reports of U.S. Government policy, as well as thoughtful criticism, giving citizens of countries throughout the region the ability to judge for themselves, which is obviously an essential foundation for freedom and free thinking. Last week here in the Foreign Relations committee, we held a series of hearings on the June 30 transition date in Iraq that were a fine example of the democratic process at work. Administration witnesses and non-governmental experts testified and Senators from both sides grappled with the tough issues we and the Iraqi people face during very challenging times. BBG seeks to set a standard of solid journalism in a region where a history of government-controlled media has left the public cynical and journalists too often seem to equate strident criticism of the United States with independent reporting. The BBG describes ``marrying the mission to the market'' as the fundamental strategy of U.S. international broadcasting today. But they must determine how to best reach large audiences in very complex, competitive media environments with news, as well as perspectives on American culture and information on official U.S. Government positions and policies. This task is further complicated by what is becoming an increasingly varied Middle Eastern broadcasting scene. While government-owned media still dominate national land-based TV and radio, satellite technology has created new stations that are competing vigorously for different segments of the market. We will ask our panelists a number of questions. In our first panel, we will examine Alhurra TV and Radio Sawa as examples of innovation at the BBG. What media are most influential in the Middle East now? Is it TV? Is it radio? Is it newspapers or is it the Internet? How does the BBG identify its audience? How is the audience segmented? How does the BBG select the media and the programming to reach different audiences? And of course, how do we measure success? On the second panel, we will see an overview of the GAO's recent work evaluating the performance of the BBG. Our panelists are uniquely qualified to further our understanding of the political environment and the media marketplace in which Alhurra and Radio Sawa operate. All three panelists on our second panel are distinguished authors with great personal experience in the region. We want to better understand what journalists in the region see as their role and their responsibilities, ask what attitudes are among different countries and different people in the Middle East toward the United States. What do people think of these new broadcasting groups, Alhurra and Radio Sawa? And how can the United States most effectively promote the development of free, fair, and open media throughout the region? As our members of the subcommittee appear, I will interrupt the proceedings to give them an opportunity to at least offer opening remarks and submit remarks for the record. But I do want to move along very quickly today, and as such, I will turn immediately to our panelists and ask you to summarize any written testimony that you have. Rest assured, we do have a fair number of questions. Again, thank you all for participating and we will begin with Mr. Kenneth Tomlinson. [The prepared statement of Senator Sununu follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator John E. Sununu Good afternoon and welcome to today's hearing of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Terrorism of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Today we will examine the Broadcasting Board of Governors and evaluate whether we have found the right media for the message in the Middle East, a region whose importance to our country we all know well. We will have two panels of distinguished witnesses. Panel one includes Mr. Tomlinson, Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors; Mr. Pattiz, Governor of the Broadcasting Board and Director of the Middle East Service; and Mr. Harb, News Director of Alhurra, the Middle East Television Network (METN). Panel two includes Mr. Ford, Director, International Affairs and Trade of the General Accounting Office; Dr. Telhami, Anwar Sadat Professor of Peace at the University of Maryland; former Ambassador Rugh of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Georgetown University; and Dr. Ghareeb, Adjunct Professor of Middle East History and Politics, School of International Service, American University. Thank you for coming today to discuss the new U.S. Government-funded Alhurra, Radio Sawa, and the critical challenge of matching the media to the audience in the Middle East. To win the war on terrorism we must not only defeat the terrorists in the field; we must also defeat their ideas, and the anti-democratic, anti-freedom, and anti-American message they espouse around the world-- and most particularly in the Middle East.

In 2002, the BBG also began broadcasting Radio Sawa to the Middle East, and in 2004, the BBG started its Alhurra satellite television broadcasts. The Board's total FY 2004 budget for all its activities is $592 million, and the FY 2005 request is $569.3 million. The BBG has requested $42.7 million for FY 2005 for METN. The Congressional Budget Office and the BBG estimate METN will cost between $37 and $42 million annually from 2004-2008. The BBG transmits news, information, and accurate reports of U.S. Government policy, as well as thoughtful criticism, giving citizens of countries throughout the region the ability to judge for themselves, an essential foundation of freedom. Last week, here in the Foreign Relations Committee we held a series of hearings on the June 30 transition date in Iraq that were a terrific example of the democratic process at work. Administration witnesses and nongovernment experts of distinction testified, and Senators from both sides of the aisle grappled with the tough issues we and the Iraqi people face in a dynamic discussion. BBG seeks to set a standard of solid journalism in a region where a history of government controlled media has left the public cynical and journalists too often seem to equate strident criticism of the United States with ``independent'' reporting. The BBG describes ``marrying the mission to the market'' as ``the fundamental strategy of U.S. international broadcasting today.'' The BBG must determine how it can best reach large audiences in complex, competitive media environments with news as well as ``perspectives on American culture and information on official U.S. Government positions and policies.'' The task is complicated by what is becoming an increasingly varied Middle Eastern broadcasting scene. While government-owned media still dominate national land-based TV and radio, satellite technology has created new stations that are competing vigorously. We will ask a number of questions. In our first panel discussion with Mr. Tomlinson, Mr. Pattiz and Mr. Harb, we will examine Alhurra TV and Radio Sawa as examples of innovation at the BBG. What media are most influential in the Middle East now: TV, radio, newspapers, the Internet? How does the BBG identify its audience? How is the audience segmented? How does BBG select the media and programming to reach the various audiences? How does BBG measure success? Might BBG's success in certain markets slow the growth of free, fair, open and privately owned local stations? On the second panel, Mr. Ford will give us an overview of GAO's recent work on the BBG. Dr. Telhami, Ambassador Rugh and Dr. Ghareeb are uniquely qualified to further our understanding of the political environment and media marketplace in which Alhurra and Radio Sawa operate. All three are distinguished authors with long experience in the region. What are the political as well as commercial dynamics of broadcasting companies in the Middle East now? What do journalists in the region see as their role and responsibilities? What are attitudes toward the U.S.? What do people think of Alhurra and Radio Sawa? How can the U.S. most effectively promote the development of free, fair and open media in the Middle East? How might Alhurra and Radio Sawa contribute to those goals? I would like to offer Senators Biden and Nelson a chance to make opening remarks, and then let us begin with Mr. Tomlinson. To ensure as much time as possible for discussion, I would ask witnesses to confine their remarks to about five minutes. Their testimony can be entered in the record in full. STATEMENT OF HON. KENNETH Y. TOMLINSON, CHAIRMAN, BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS Mr. Tomlinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief. You have the statement for the record. I will point out that Norm Pattiz has both a film which is going to be fascinating insight into Alhurra, our new television voice, but we also have preliminary survey data from the region to show the kind of quick impact we have had in the region, as well as definitive survey data from Nielsen demonstrating the extraordinary success of Radio Sawa. I will also point out that last night for the first time in 19 years, Norm Pattiz was not court side for a Lakers playoff game, which is an indication of the seriousness that he has brought to the table here. Because I assure you that in past years, he never would have missed a playoff game for such a hearing. To my left is Mouafac Harb, who is News Director of Radio Sawa and News Director of Alhurra. I was walking down the hallway of VOA today and someone stopped me and said, you know, I think Mouafac Harb might be the most important single person involved in broadcasting public diplomacy, and I really could not disagree with that. I am honored to be with both of these gentlemen. On February 14 of this year, with the enthusiastic support of President Bush and key leaders of the administration and the Congress, BBG launched its new Arabic language television network called Alhurra. Alhurra was created out in northern Virginia in a little more than 4 months, a state-of-the-art studio that we would be proud for anyone to see. But on that day that as we opened with the magnificent sets that Norm Pattiz was responsible for putting together, the extraordinary thing to me was the sea of Middle Eastern faces--news men, news women enthusiastically working to make this network a successful model of journalistic standards in this world. President Bush spoke of open debate and truth when he described what this network can mean to the people of the Middle East. The network will challenge the voices of hate and repression with truth and the voices of tolerance and moderation. Viewers will witness free and open discussions not just about the conflict in the Middle East, but also about subjects critical to that region's future--economic development, human rights, respect for minorities. Our competitive edge in the Middle East is our dedication to truth and free and open debate. People have asked from the beginning how in the world will you guys be able to compete with Al Jazeera and others out there. I contend that time and again Radio Sawa is demonstrating that it is first-rate. If you give accurate news, if people come to depend on the news, if they hear free and open debate, they will come to such a station. We are also proud of what we have done in other aspects of international broadcasting. Voice of America has been active in a number of different areas, which we will mention as we go along today. Especially important at Voice of America is a new daily news program to Iran, obviously, in Persian. It has been a terrific success and we are proud of it. Now, Radio Sawa has been a phenomenal success, and Norm will have a lot to say about that in terms of the Nielsen survey. We were asked repeatedly on Alhurra how are you going to know anyone is listening to you. I have never been involved in a project that I had more faith was going to be a success than the Alhurra project, but I am glad that we have some quick survey data indicating the initial impact. We will have more data in the summer. I am an old print journalist and my attitude, Mr. Chairman, toward some of this is the attitude of Mark Twain who said, ``figures lie and liars figure.'' But we do need the statistical indication of our presence there, and that we will give you today. The board also has been involved, in addition to our Persian initiative, in expansions at VOA in Indonesia. We have an important new service to Pakistan in Urdu language broadcasting that our colleague Steve Simmons of the Board of Governors has been a great force behind. We have a lot to tell you about and we look forward to your questions. I will end on just one quick note. We are frequently asked about coordination. We are frequently asked about the way we work with other aspects of the administration. Of course, Senator Biden, being the father of this broadcast board, put together a force that would, in fact, be a firewall and serve a unique role in communications around the world. But I have served four administrations in Washington, as the Director of the Voice of America, a member of the BIB board and the like, and I have never seen a better working relationship between the White House and international broadcasting than we have now. We have the White House Office of Global Communications to thank for that. They were enormously supportive and helpful in developing what we are doing at Alhurra. Let me close on this. We need to understand the importance of maintaining the strength of public diplomacy and the traditions of international broadcasting. I am convinced we will not be successful in our overall mission of delivering our message to the world if we fail to grasp that these are two different spheres and that they operate according to two different sets of rules. It is very important that government spokesmen take America's message to the world passionately and relentlessly. We should not be ashamed of public advocacy on behalf of freedom and democracy and the United States of America. International broadcasting, on a parallel and complementary track, is called upon to reflect the highest standards of independent journalism as the best means of demonstrating to international audiences that truth is on the side of democratic values. We in America are fortunate that telling the truth works to our long-term advantage. That is why international broadcasting, I believe, is so important in this country. We thank you for the invitation. We look forward to answering your questions, and I look forward to Norm's presentation because he usually does a pretty good job. [The prepared statement of Mr. Tomlinson follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Kenneth Y. Tomlinson Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to talk about the efforts of the Broadcasting Board of Governors to communicate with the people in the Islamic world. I am joined by fellow board member Norman Pattiz, the father of Radio Sawa and an irrepressible force for international broadcasting, and by Mouafac Harb, the News Director for the Middle East Television Network. Together we hope to give you a full picture of the BBG's efforts to assist the war on terrorism, and become a continuously available source of news for the people of the Middle East. As this committee well knows, the BBG has greatly expanded its reach and broadcast hours to the Islamic world in the past three years. There has been literally an enormous increase in the availability of U.S.-sponsored news and information on radio and television to this region. Radio Sawa, Radio Farda, VOA-TV's Persian programming, and now the Middle East Television Network (MTN) are relative newcomers on the scene, but are making a big impact. On February 14 of this year, with the enthusiastic support of President Bush and key leaders of the Administration and Congress, the BBG launched its new Arabic-language television network called ``Alhurra'' (``The Free One'' in Arabic). Even before this station went on the air, it was heavily criticized in the Arab world as a propaganda arm of the U.S. Government. It has been called a ``voice of the CIA'' whose aim is to ``brainwash Arabs'' and described as part of ``a long- term plan to dominate the minds and ideas of Iraqis and Arabs.'' But Alhurra is none of these things. Its mission is that of all U.S. international broadcasting--to promote and sustain freedom and democracy by broadcasting accurate and objective news and information about the United States and the world. Through its adherence to Western journalistic standards, through its objective, accurate reporting, Alhurra can gain the credibility we need to build an audience and offer Middle Eastern audiences a new balanced view of world events. While criticism in the Arab press continues, we are connecting with the people--our target audience--and they are sending us hundreds of e-mails to welcome us. ``You are much needed to balance biased news controlled by those full of hatred to western world,'' reads one. ``This is the first step to fight the `hate culture' that feeds terrorism,'' says another. ``I hope your channel [will help] our Arab brothers . . . to tell the truth from all that is going on.'' In a little more than four months, the BBG established a state-of- the-art broadcast facility in Northern Virginia to house Alhurra. Since October some 900,000 feet of cable have been installed in this facility. But what is truly extraordinary is the sea of Middle Eastern faces--newsmen and newswomen--enthusiastically working to make this network a successful model of journalistic standards. Many of these individuals are well known media figures in the Middle East and gave up promising careers overseas to practice journalism with MTN. President Bush spoke of ``open debate'' and ``truth'' when he described what this network can mean to the people of the Middle East. The network will challenge the voices of hate and repression with truth and the voices of tolerance and moderation. Viewers will witness free and open discussions, not just about conflict in the Middle East, but also about subjects critical to that region's future--economic development, human rights and respect for minorities. Our competitive edge in the Middle East is our dedication to truth and free and open debate. We will provide an example of democracy and a free press in a media market dominated by sensationalism and distortion. That is also the basis for the success of the Voice of America's new Persian-language satellite television program ``News and Views'' to the people of Iran. Less than three months after that program was launched last summer, one independent survey showed ``News and Views'' was reaching a remarkable 12 percent of the country's over- 18 population. Typical of what creative broadcasting can do is the new segment launched by ``News and Views'' called ``Your Voice.'' Iranian viewers were invited to submit e-mails on the controversy surrounding the February 20th parliamentary elections--from the banning of candidates to calls for an election boycott. We opened a dialogue that is allowing Iranians to share their views with other Iranians--and the response has been extraordinary. My predecessors likewise brought innovation to our radio broadcasts that proved to be vital to the success of our Afghan Radio Network which broadcasts in Dari and Pashto, our youth-oriented Radio Farda to Iran, and Radio Sawa to the Arab world. When Norm Pattiz was in the process of creating Radio Sawa, he traveled throughout the Middle East to negotiate heretofore unattainable agreements for American AM and FM transmitters in Middle Eastern countries so that we could be heard on the radios of choice in the region. Radio Sawa has been a phenomenal success. A survey by ACNielsen research last fall demonstrated that Sawa has achieved market dominance--an average listenership of 42 percent in the important age group between 15 and 29--in key Middle Eastern countries. Radio Sawa faced the same skepticism as Alhurra before it was launched. Critics conceded Arabs might listen to our music, but not our news. Yet this same ACNielsen survey found that, in a region where skepticism towards the U.S. is high and boycotts of U.S. products are common, Radio Sawa was found to be a reliable source of news and information by 73 percent of its weekly listenership. In a matter of months, Sawa built the largest radio news-gathering operation in the Middle East presenting up-to-the minute news 24 hours a day and over 325 newscasts per week. It was the very reliability of our Sawa news that made us the leading source for news in Iraq even as we went to war there. News also accounts for the surprising audience that ACNielsen documented for Sawa among older listeners in target countries in the Middle East--better than 20 percent among the general population over 30. Mr. Chairman, I will submit for the record highlights of this survey. Under the leadership of Mouafac Harb, Sawa's outstanding News Director who also assumes that post for Alhurra, the station also is the source of a host of shows that explore freedom and democracy. In Indonesia, the Voice of America has enhanced its radio and TV offerings to reach this large Islamic population. ``Jurnal VOA,'' a 25- minute live, interactive news program, appears on Indonesia's ``Metro TV.'' Another TV offering, ``Doing Business,'' airs every Monday on TVRI. ``VOA Direct Connection,'' a half-hour weekly radio program, airs each Friday evening on more than 40 satellite affiliates around Indonesia. This month, we launched a new one-hour interactive talk show, ``Salam VOA,'' that will air on JTV in Surabaya. In addition, VOA will supply Trans TV with a weekly 5-minute U.S. election wrap-up, to air on its morning news program. We anticipate doubling our radio broadcasts to five hours a day and increasing TV from one to five hours a week. The Board's latest initiative is a new youth-oriented Urdu broadcast to Pakistan where listeners would be served contemporary Pakistani and western music along with news and current affairs features and subjects ranging from education to business to health. We hope to increase our hours of broadcast as well as the power of our broadcasts to this key country in the war on terrorism. Just this week we began broadcasting to Iraq over channel 12 in Baghdad, available through terrestrial transmission. Iraqis also have access to Alhurra's programming delivered via Arabsat. In the weeks ahead, we will be phasing in special programming for Iraq, including newscasts, talk shows and roundtables. Additional terrestrial transmitters in Basra and three other cities should be on-line in the near future. Much of criticism of Alhurra--again before we even launched--was that we would be the mouthpiece of the U.S. Government, sending cleared messages and propaganda to taint Arab minds. None of our programming in any part of the world seeks to do this. VOA's long-standing Charter, and more recently the U.S. International Broadcasting Act, guard against this. But we must demonstrate this every day to our audiences and earn their trust and loyalty over time. This does not mean that we ignore our mission to promote and sustain freedom and democracy. Our programming frequently features U.S. policymakers and programming that accurately explains the U.S. policy measures that so often are maligned in the Middle East. In continuing all of our broadcast initiatives, we will strive to give our listeners the same tool we have always provided through international broadcasting: the information they need to compare their political, economic, and social systems to those that exist elsewhere in the world, and to assess their own leadership. In creating a broadcast environment that also reflects the foreign policy priorities of the United States, we look to the Department of State for guidance, expertise, and participation in our programs. I have served four Administrations in Washington--all of them connected with international broadcasting. Never have I seen a better working relationship between the White House, the State Department; and international broadcasting. The White House Office of Global Communications has been extraordinarily supportive in helping us assess priorities and expand what we are doing as in Middle East Television. This office also has been a major enabler in helping the BBG to gain access to policy makers for interviews on major world events. Under Secretary Margaret Tutwiler, who represents the Secretary at Board meetings, has been deeply interested in broadcasting's strategic goals and priorities and is a full participant in Board decision- making. Our diplomats overseas also have helped-us gain valuable transmission resources in countries to which we broadcast. We need to understand the importance of maintaining the strength of public diplomacy and the traditions of international broadcasting. I am convinced that we will not be successful in our overall mission of delivering our message to the world if we fail to grasp that these are two different spheres and that they operate according to two different sets of rules. It is very important that government spokesmen take America's message to the world--passionately and relentlessly. We should not be ashamed of public advocacy on behalf of freedom and democracy and the United States of America. International broadcasting, on a parallel and complementary track, is called upon to reflect the highest standards of independent journalism as the best means of demonstrating to international audiences that truth is on the side of democratic values. Thirty years ago, RFE/RL and VOA began broadcasting the Watergate hearings. Those broadcasts caused heartburn for many in Washington, but looking back we see they constituted a veritable civics lesson on the importance of separation of powers and rule of law. Over the years I have heard so many citizens of post-communist countries tell how those broadcasts helped them understand the real meaning of freedom and democracy. Alhurra is fortunate to make its debut in a Presidential election year. It will cover the U.S. race from one end to the other, showing day by day how our election process works. We in America are fortunate that telling the truth works to our long-term advantage. That is why international broadcasting is so important to this country. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my formal statement. I will be happy to answer any questions that your subcommittee might have. Senator Sununu. Thank you, Mr. Tomlinson. At this time, I would like to call on the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator Nelson, for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BILL NELSON Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A large scale international television and the Internet, I think, is essential in winning the war on terrorism. When we hear the commentary in the last few days of what is, in fact, happening on the ground being, to be charitable, misconstrued by some of the Arab television networks, it becomes all the more important that the interests of the free world have an ability to communicate with people of different civilizations. So in the course of this hearing, which I am going to have to be in and out of, Mr. Chairman, we are going to be examining whether investment and recapitalization of the transmission capabilities are needed and increasing our television programming and broadening our outreach to the Muslim world. This is most timely that you are having this subcommittee hearing. We have already expanded our services to the region in Arabic and Persian. This committee is one which voted to increase the President's budget for broadcasting when we moved the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act earlier this year. So thank you for the opportunity and I thank the witnesses for coming and testifying to us. Senator Sununu. Thank you, Senator Nelson. At this time, we are pleased to take the testimony from Norman Pattiz. Welcome. STATEMENT OF HON. NORMAN J. PATTIZ, GOVERNOR, BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS Mr. Pattiz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, Senator Nelson. It is a pleasure to be here. I will just expand on what Chairman Tomlinson said about my missing the first Lakers playoff game in 18 years in order to be here. That is true, but I am a broadcaster by trade and I considered this an honor and a privilege to have been appointed by two Presidents of different parties to do something that is arguably more important than it has ever been, or as important as it has ever been certainly in our history, that takes advantage of what I have done for a living all my life in a country that has been very, very good to me. So go Lakers, but priorities are priorities, and this is where I need to be and this where I am. I got involved in the Broadcasting Board of Governors about 3 years ago. I was sworn-in in November of 2000, and at the time, I was the only broadcaster on the board. I am happy to say that we now have a number of people with broadcast and journalism experience, but I was the only broadcaster. As such, I was asked to serve as the co-chair of the Language Review Committee, which is the committee that is mandated by Congress to, on an annual basis, look at how we deploy our resources across the 60-plus language services that we broadcast in every year. One area stood out when I was taking a look at the various areas that we were funding, not because of what we were doing, but because of what we were not doing. That area was the Middle East. At the time, our total commitment to the Middle East was 7 hours a day of Arabic language programming from the Voice of America Arabic Service, transmitted on short wave which practically nobody listened to, on a very weak medium wave signal out of the Island of Rhodes. That was our commitment to Middle East broadcasting. I reported that to the board and the board in so many words said, congratulations, Norm, good job. We are now forming a Middle East committee. You will be the chairman of it. Go fix it. So within a month, I was on my way to the Middle East with some staffers to assess what was possible in the region, and a lot was possible. But first, impressions of what was going on in the region. Taking a look at the media environment in the region--and I am not saying this is what takes place in every aspect of the media environment--it is not uncommon at all to hear hate-speak on radio and television, incitement to violence, disinformation, government censorship, and journalistic self-censorship. It is within that environment that the Arab street gets its impressions not only of U.S. policy, which they despise, but of our culture, our society, our people, our values. We thought we needed to do a much better job of presenting accurately what our policies are so that our audiences could make more informed decisions. And we need to reach the largest possible audience that we could reach. There was a tremendous opportunity with Radio Sawa, which at the time we did not know was going to be ``Radio Sawa.'' We knew it was going to be something in Arabic on the radio. I met with heads of state, ministers of information, academics, journalists. We did some focus groups in several countries. And it was obvious that there was an opportunity to reach a very large percentage of the population, the largest percentage of the population actually, which is the 30 and under segment that is underserved by the media and is incredibly important to the long-term interests of the United States. By putting something on the air that was contemporary; that took advantage of the best in Western broadcasting techniques and technology; that utilized AM, FM, digital audio, satellite technology; and that fulfills the role of ``marrying the mission to the market;'' we attracted an audience for our primary mission, which is a journalistic mission. So we put Radio Sawa on the air, which was a mix of Western and Arabic music, heavily researched. Let me just say that Radio Sawa and Alhurra are the most researched projects in the history of international broadcasting. The fact of the matter is I cannot do a project if I do not have the research with which to determine what the opportunities are within the marketplace, who it is we are trying to reach, who it is we are trying to communicate with, and what those messages ought to be. If you do not have that, then you are shooting blanks. So we got a lot of information to find out what it would take to resonate with our audience because radio, unlike television, is a very different medium. Radio is a medium of formats, and people tend to listen to their favorite radio stations to the exclusion of other radio stations. Television is very different. It is a medium of programs, and consequently, people tune into various programs at various times because they want to see those programs. But they are not intrinsically loyal to a particular television station. It does not define who they are. It is different with radio. A lot of people define who they are by the radio station they listen to. I dare say if I stepped into any one of your automobiles today and checked the settings on your radios, I would know something about who it was who was driving that car. So radio has a very unique way of connecting primarily with the 30 and under audience, and Radio Sawa has used all of that knowledge that we have to deliver a very, very large audience to news and information that is second to none. We broadcast over 5 hours of original news and informational programming every single day. We break for special events when events on the ground warrant it. We will go for 4, 5, 6 hours continuously in order to fulfill our journalistic mission. And from the very beginning, we knew that Sawa was going to be successful based upon the original research that we were doing and the tracking research that we do on a regular basis. We have had a lot of negative information passed around in the press in the Middle East and some over here about the chances for success of Alhurra. I have not been too terribly concerned about that, nor do I think the chairman or Mouafac have been terribly concerned about that, because frankly it is everything we heard about Radio Sawa. The difference is when we started Radio Sawa, we did it market by market, and when we started Alhurra, we did it via satellite throughout the whole region. So the entire media world knew we were coming and had their thoughts, and they were giving us their thoughts well in advance of us even being on the air. Having said that, knowing that these are supposed to be brief remarks--and I have probably worn out my welcome and there is a short video we want to show you--I want to give you some information that has just been completed on Radio Sawa and on Alhurra. We have been doing research on Sawa for a number of years now. Well, for 2 years. We have been on the air for 2 years. And Sawa has shown that it can generate a significant audience, and we have the research result--and I believe we have supplied it to the committee--of the latest Nielsen study showing that Sawa, in terms of 15-plus numbers, has a very large share across the region. In terms of its target audience numbers, it has an even larger share across the region. In terms of reliability and credibility, it is viewed very highly by its listeners for the reliability and credibility of the news, coming from an obviously American radio station. I will just say this. Shortly after going on the air in Amman, Jordan, we did a research study that showed that within 30 days Sawa was the favorite radio station of over 50 percent of our target audience and was listened to weekly by 90 percent of our target audience. But in terms of news credibility, only 1 percent of our audience, a month after it went on the air, thought we were reliable and credible. Six months later, we still had those large numbers for ``favorite radio station'' and those large numbers of people who were listening every week, but in terms of news and information reliability and credibility, the number had gone up to 40 percent. So the point is to those people who will say if you cannot trust the messenger, do not trust the message--our mission is to walk the walk. Our mission is to give them an example of what a free press is in the American tradition, and we have demonstrated with Radio Sawa that they will listen and they will be affected. As a matter of fact, that same Nielsen research shows that, by a margin of about 2 to 1, slightly under 2 to 1, Radio Sawa listeners have a more positive view of the United States of America than do non-Radio Sawa listeners. This is a long-term project. We are late in the game. Nothing is going to get changed overnight, but I think we are definitely having an effect with Sawa. As far as Alhurra is concerned, since we have demonstrated the fact that a U.S.-sponsored radio station can be viewed as reliable and credible and very popular amongst its audience, then we ought to engage in television where the real game is taking place and where 90 percent of the Arab population gets its news and information. So we have put together a 21st century news and information-driven television station. It is news and information-driven but it is not all news and information. We also have magazine shows. We have travel shows, shows on health and fitness, shows on fashion, shows on food, a number of different kinds of programming to attract a wider body of viewers so that we can affect them with our news and information programming. Every hour at the top of the hour and at the bottom of the hour, we do news even when we are doing the programming that is not primarily news and information. In prime time, we do two 1- hour live newscasts. Obviously, we break for breaking stories, as we have done on many occasions over the last few weeks, to cover the breaking stories that are going on within the region. But the question that we get asked over and over again, even though we have only been on the air for 2 months and we have only been 24 hours for about 3 weeks, is who is listening, who is watching. Well, it is early. We have research in the field right now that will ask many, many, many questions. But in order to get a feel for where we are, we contracted with Ipsos-Stat, which is the French company that does research in the Middle East and provides much of the audience research for television throughout the Middle East. We contracted with them to do a telephone survey in several cities throughout the region to get a sense of whether or not people had even heard of us, whether people were watching us, and what they felt about us. This is very preliminary stuff, and it is really the information that we would normally just use internally to let us know how we are doing and what we need to focus on. But it came back a few days ago, and I wanted to share it with you because, quite frankly, it is very impressive. It is more impressive than we anticipated. This is a telephone survey, so it is people who have telephones and it is also people who have access to satellite television. Now, you have 300 million people in the region. And 170 million of them are over the age of 15, and about 40 percent of those people have satellite access. So you are talking about in excess of 70 million people here. So this is a big chunk of people. In taking a look at individual cities, let me just tell you which cities we looked at because I am going to mention them by country. But I want you to know which cities we actually looked at because these are more city numbers than country numbers. In Egypt, we surveyed Cairo and Alexandria. In Jordan, we surveyed Amman, Irbid, and Zarka. In the Emirates, we surveyed Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In Lebanon, Beirut. Kuwait, Kuwait City. Saudi Arabia, Jeddah and Riyadh. Syria, Damascus and Aleppo. The information is as follows. In terms of weekly listening, persons 15-plus, in Egypt, 18 percent; in Jordan, 37 percent; in Lebanon, 40 percent; in the Emirates, 19 percent; in Kuwait, 44 percent; in Syria, 29 percent; and in Saudi Arabia, 19 percent. These are significant numbers for a station that has been on the air for a very, very short time, and has only been on the air 24 hours a day for a very, very short period of time. The fact that we got all that negative publicity was probably a blessing in disguise. I think it is very interesting that they issued a fatwah against us in Saudi Arabia, yet in spite of that, we can show that 19 percent answered affirmatively. Let me give you a sense of news reliability because we asked those same people how reliable do you feel the news on Alhurra is. In the categories of ``very reliable'' and ``somewhat reliable,'' in Egypt, 40 percent said reliable; in Jordan, 44 percent; in Lebanon, 54 percent; in the United Arab Emirates, 65 percent; in Kuwait, 61 percent; in Syria, 37 percent; and in Saudi Arabia, 70 percent. So this is real, real preliminary stuff, but it is an indicator and it is a good indicator. We are there, and we are a player in this marketplace right now. We will have full and complete research within the next 45 to 60 days which is being done right now, and then we will have another Nielsen survey which we will be doing in June and July. With your indulgence, what I would like to do is direct your attention to that monitor over there and give you a sense of what this station looks like. We have taken a short promotional video and edited it down to an even shorter promotional video with some English narration, and added some recent coverage in the American media--a piece that was done on the News Hour that shows you how the American media has covered what we are doing--and then some very quick cuts of our people in the field doing the various types of programming, the live news, the roundtable discussions, the interviews, and so forth. This piece runs just a little bit over 3 minutes, so with your indulgence, Mr. Chairman, I would like to play that for you. Senator Nelson. Was that fatwah issued with the approval of the Government of Saudi Arabia? Mr. Harb. I do not think it was, but the person who issued the fatwah is a government employee. Senator Nelson. It was. Mr. Harb. Yes, sir. Mr. Pattiz. He is a government employee. I do not know that you could get the Saudi Arabian Government to say it issued a fatwah, but this is a religious leader who is in the employ of the Saudi Government. Senator Nelson. And did that fatwah get issued before the most recent bombing in Saudi Arabia? Mr. Pattiz. I think it was issued before we ever hit the air. Do not watch, do not participate, do not buy commercials, which I thought was interesting since we are non-commercial. If memory serves me, that was something that was issued before we had even started broadcasting on February 14, or at least shortly thereafter. Senator Nelson. Maybe they are changing their tune, Mr. Chairman, after the most recent bombing. [Video shown.] [The prepared statement of Mr. Pattiz follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Norman J. Pattiz Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I welcome the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss our most recent programs in the Middle East and to give you a quick video glimpse of some of the stories covered by Alhurra as well as the quality of its production. As Mr. Tomlinson mentioned, Alhurra has been on the air for just over two months. We have plunged into a Middle East media environment that is rich in satellite programming and critical, breaking news. But it is not an environment that is steeped in same traditions of journalism and objective news analysis that we are familiar with. Television and radio broadcasters in the region are, for the most part, government owned, and reflect a particular point of view that can be destructive to opinion about the United States. We hope to make a difference by filling the gap in accurate, objective news coverage. Before I play the short video clip on Alhurra, I would like to emphasize that the products the BBG has initiated over the past three years were heavily researched before we invested in them. We believe we can be most successful when we tailor our program mix to the audience we are trying to reach, using music and other non-news feature programming when appropriate. We must also broadcast in a manner that is sensitive to the culture and traditions of our audiences. Our formats must be appealing, and our programs compelling and technologically state-of-the-art in order to compete. In the Middle East, while audiences lack objective information about the United States and our leadership in the world, there is no lack of satellite stations that are competing with us for the same audience. We must set ourselves apart, and I believe that Radio Sawa and Alhurra television are doing that. For the development of Radio Sawa, we traveled to the region and identified a target audience of the large portion of the population that is under the age of 35. We researched what programming would draw them to an AM or FM station, and when we found they would be attracted by modern music, we researched their music preferences. This music- based format, along with features designed to appeal to young audiences, provides the foundation for our news and information programming. So far, it has worked. As Chairman Tomlinson mentioned in his statement, the audience listens, and they listen for the news. Let me add another survey result to what you have already heard about Sawa listening. In a survey conducted in Morocco--Radio Sawa's newest market in the Middle East--in February 2004, Nielsen found that 72 percent of the general population over the age of 15 listened to Radio Sawa. Sawa is even stronger in its 15 to 29 core age group. Among this market segment, Sawa showed a listening rate of 87.5 percent. The rate of listening among audiences over the age of 30 is 63.5 percent, and 77 percent of weekly listeners found Sawa's news reliable. The success of Radio Sawa helped fuel the creation of Alhurra, our television broadcast to the Middle East. After funding first became available in April 2003, we assembled a highly skilled team of professionals to take on the daunting task of getting a 24 hour a day station on the air by the beginning of 2004. After months of overcoming the many daily challenges that came our way, we launched the program on February 14. We believe we have a sophisticated product that will compete favorably with the well-established, and well-funded, satellite stations that exist in the region. The BBG's use of research also applies to program delivery, which can also pose major diplomatic and engineering challenges. As you know, we are navigating a world where all transmission options are not uniformly available or utilized in every region. Not only do we ``marry the mission to the market'' when we develop our program content, but we also do so when we choose transmission options. Some markets still require shortwave delivery. Other markets, as in the Middle East and surrounding regions, are much like the U.S. market: they listen to AM and FM radio, and get much of their news from television. Gaining access to AM and FM frequencies requires permission from foreign governments to install or lease transmission within their boundaries. Intense effort from the BBG, together with committed assistance from the State Department, has provided a network of about 20 AM and FM transmitters from Morocco to Kuwait to support Radio Sawa, and is working to establish terrestrial transmission in Iraq. I'd now like to play a short video which will give you a clear idea of the substance and flavor of Alhurra. Senator Sununu. Thank you very much for your presentation. Mr. Harb, welcome. STATEMENT OF MOUAFAC HARB, NEWS DIRECTOR, ALHURRA, MIDDLE EAST TELEVISION NETWORK, BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS Mr. Harb. On behalf of my colleagues at Radio Sawa and Alhurra, I thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am honored to have been given a role in establishing both Radio Sawa and Alhurra television. We have been fortunate in the leadership and support we have received from the administration, Congress, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. It has been deeply satisfying to see Sawa and Alhurra develop from inspiration to reality with staff, stations, and a steadily growing audience. The mission of this new Middle East television network is to broadcast accurate, timely, and relevant news and information about the region, the world, and the United States to a broad Arab-speaking audience. By doing this, we seek to foster freedom and democracy in the Middle East. That is a tall order. I am proud to tell you that we are beginning to fill it. All of us who work in these operations can feel it, and the data we have gathered--and Governor Pattiz just mentioned a little bit about it--although early, appear to back that up. It will take time, but I am confident we will succeed. Until Sawa and Alhurra began broadcasting, people in the Arabic-speaking world got a steady diet of variations of just one story: Arab humiliation. The actual events are different from story to story and day to day. But they all carry this one message. It tells them that the Americans and the Israelis are the source of all the trouble in their lives. They bear no responsibility themselves. News outlets in the Middle East, especially television news outlets, see themselves as mirrors of public opinion and their audience's emotions. So they come at their reporting with a point of view already in place, and as a result, they broadcast material that inflames viewers against America. In the past few years, the Middle East has been a two- channel television market when it comes to news and information. The ratings for these two channels have been largely determined by one person and not by good journalism, and that person is Osama bin Laden. He knows neither channel wants to be frozen out and he plays that for all it is worth, rewarding one or the other with an exclusive tape of his latest threats. It is not about going out to find a scoop and go after a story. You wait in your newsroom praying for a tape to show up from al-Zarqawi or Osama bin Laden and then all American networks and Western networks will carry the message. Well, it is not a two-channel market anymore, and the new player does not need to please bin Laden. Since February 14, Alhurra has brought a new idea to journalism in the Middle East--telling the truth. We do our work the way it is supposed to be done. We play it straight and we behave like news professionals because that is what we are. As Mr. Pattiz mentioned, we were businesslike in our approach. We are heavily researched and we studied our market from Morocco to the Persian Gulf. We used what we learned to shape our product. What came out was the region's first news and information channel dedicated to telling the story completely and accurately. That means going beyond just reporting what happened. We provide background and context to explain why something happened and what the ramifications might be. An example of this happened a couple of weeks ago in our coverage of the assassination of Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantissi. Alhurra was ending one of its hour-long newscasts when the story broke. We immediately reported it on the newscast. Then we followed up the initial report with 5 hours of live coverage, including reaction and analysis from around the world and a look at what this would mean for the future of Hamas, the Palestinian people, and Israeli/Palestinian relations. You cannot do that kind of work with amateurs. We have been able to recruit the best and the brightest, real pros from inside and outside the Middle East, from the United States as well. On the editorial side, most of the people are from the region and were hand-picked to be representative of the wide territory we serve. Everyone we have hired shares our sense of journalistic values. In fact, during the first round of interviews that I have conducted myself, many of them asked me if Alhurra would be pure propaganda and if it could really be free, especially if it was funded by the government. My answer, of course, was it will be free. The fact that they were asking this question and they were concerned about this, they had just passed a major step for getting the job. For some of my colleagues, joining the staff of Alhurra involved personal sacrifice, moving half a world away from family and friends to work for an organization that some people back home have been taught to believe is their enemy. I work with courageous people. Alhurra has been on the air only 2\\1/2\\ months. In that time, the Middle East has endured some of the toughest news stories of the decade. Alhurra has been there to cover them. We were the first to report on a number of stories, and we have garnered exclusive interviews. We created a program schedule for Alhurra that is flexible enough that we can break into regularly scheduled programming to cover breaking news if it is warranted. Also in that short period of time, we have been on the receiving end of a lot of unfocused criticism from our competitors and their keepers. That tells us that we have their attention. It is very important to mention here that most of the vicious articles that were directed at Alhurra came before we launched Alhurra and they came from media outlets funded by so-called friendly Arab governments. I think Alhurra and Radio Sawa were the first attempt by the United States to reach out directly to the Arab audience. Television is a real ``me too'' industry. If a program succeeds on one network, you are likely to see copies start popping up on the other ones. This is true everywhere. We are working to establish the gold standard that the other guys will want to rip off: the best technology, the finest professionals, the most innovative programming, the most eye-catching sets that you saw on the video, and the most compelling visuals. Our brand is freedom and democracy. We want them to follow us there. Thank you again for allowing me to appear before you today. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Senator Sununu. Thank you, Mr. Harb. Let me begin the questioning with Mr. Tomlinson. Even here in the United States we have disagreement and discussion domestically about our policies overseas, whether it is the peace process or the current situation in Iraq or any other issue that affects the Middle East. Does that make it more difficult for the Board of Governors to carry out their mission in the region, the fact that we have policy disagreements here at home? Mr. Tomlinson. I do not think so, Mr. Chairman. Twenty-some years ago, I came to town as the Director of the Voice of America in the early days of the Reagan administration at the height of the cold war. My first observation about what we were doing was people were trying to get the Voice of America to speak with one voice. And I said you cannot understand American democracy, you cannot understand what this country is all about if you try to speak with one voice, because we have to reflect the voices of America across the political spectrum. We can do so in such a way as to emphasize majority opinion. We do not have to be a slave to making sure we put forward divisions in American society. But we have a very strong administration. We have very strong feelings about some of the things the administration is doing. I think by enabling people to see how we operate that they will see how democracy could operate in their own countries. I often go back to the fact that in the early 1970s or mid- 1970s, Radio Free Europe and Voice of America made the decision to broadcast the Watergate hearings live. There was a lot of consternation about that because people were saying why are we exposing to the Communist world divisions in American society. The fact of the matter is, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I had so many people in Eastern Europe, so many from the former Soviet Union say to me, you know, broadcasting those hearings was absolutely essential to demonstrating to us what democracy is really all about because, after all, democracy is about the rule of law. Democracy is about the separation of powers. Democracy is about concepts that you can only understand sometimes when you see it in action. That is why, as I was saying earlier, I am so happy we are launching Alhurra in the year of a Presidential election. Senator Sununu. Is there a danger that the BBG's Government-supported broadcasting will ultimately make it more difficult for private, independent stations to develop in the Middle East? Mr. Tomlinson. I do not think so because I think we establish a model. We are very proud of the competence of our news operation. I was so proud seeing that film because it reflected what I have seen out there in northern Virginia. I am so proud of this colleague here and the many people who serve with him. We set a standard and I think the standard is going to come to be seen as what broadcast journalism should be, as opposed to false reporting and sensationalism for the sake of stirring people up. What we do is real journalism. In putting forth this standard, I hope that when local entities begin broadcasting, that they will go with our standard as opposed to the Al Jazeera standard. Mr. Pattiz. Can I get a piece of that? Mr. Tomlinson. Why certainly. Senator Sununu. Mr. Pattiz, please. Mr. Pattiz. Thank you. Mr. Tomlinson. Just so long as you agree with me. Mr. Pattiz. I never disagree with you, Mr. Chairman, never publicly anyway. I cannot see any instance where the success of projects like Radio Sawa or Alhurra or any of the other projects that we do around the world would have any kind of a chilling effect on local media. The fact of the matter is it should have quite the opposite effect. As a businessman, when I go out and put a radio program or a format or a new station or what have you out on a market, I take a look at that market and I see what is working and I see how many people are watching it. I see what chunk of those people I can wind up getting. I think it creates a more vibrant and exciting marketplace that creates more opportunities. We already have, in the case of Sawa, lots of imitators that have sprung up because of the success of Radio Sawa. Senator Sununu. If I could ask both you and Mr. Harb to speak to that point, provide a couple of specific examples of the changes that you have seen in other broadcasters as a result of the product that is being produced by either Radio Sawa or Alhurra. Mr. Pattiz. Is that to me? Senator Sununu. Yes. I assume each of you may know of one or two examples. Mr. Pattiz. Oh, sure. I can talk about Jordan and Egypt, as it relates to Radio Sawa. It has only been a matter of weeks with Alhurra. Even though we have seen some adjustments. Maybe you would like to talk about Alhurra, Mouafac, and I will talk about Sawa. We have already seen in many places where Sawa broadcasts music-driven radio stations that are basically following our play lists to attract audience. We originally started talking to the Egyptians about trying to get transmission within Egypt, which we have not secured. When I went to Qatar and met with Sheikh Hamad bin Jaber Al Thani who runs Al Jazeera radio and television in the Government of Qatar and asked him for an FM frequency, his response was ``what took you so long'' and they gave it to us. But in Egypt, we have been asking very aggressively for the last 3 years, and we still cannot get transmission within Egypt. We cover Egypt, but we cover Egypt from Cyprus. But in Egypt, they have now put FM radio stations on the air with formats very similar to Sawa. So we are seeing this happening all over the place. [The following letter containing additional information for the record was subsequently forwarded by Mr. Tomlinson.] Broadcasting Board of Governors, 330 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, DC, June 3, 2004. The Honorable John E. Sununu, Chairman, Subcommittee on International Operations and Terrorism, Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your interest in the establishment of a viable frequency for Radio Sawa audiences in Egypt. We heartily agree that reaching Egyptian audiences is a high priority for U.S. international broadcasting, given the largely anti-American tone of Egyptian media. As you know, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has been working with the Government of Egypt for nearly three years to find an agreeable in-country broadcast presence that would allow Radio Sawa to be heard clearly and regularly in Cairo and other major cities. As the Egyptian Ambassador's letter to you attests, it has been difficult to find a solution that satisfies the legal and technical demands of both parties. However, in recent weeks, representatives of our two governments have had a number of productive exchanges which, we believe, can lead to the establishment of a quality radio signal into Cairo. In previous discussions regarding transmission sites for Radio Sawa, the Egyptian Government has pointed us toward Egypt's ``Media City'' outside of Cairo, where it houses a number of government and commercial broadcast entities. The BBG's earlier proposal to establish an AM transmitter at this site met with technical problems, potentially interfering with other, already established, broadcast entities at the site. We have scaled-back our proposal to provide for the installation of an FM transmitter in Media City that would not pose similar interference problems. The location of an FM transmitter 32 miles outside of the city of Cairo is perhaps not our preferred option. However, we believe this proposal resolves the objectives of all parties in the current environment, and we are hopeful that this proposal will fit more satisfactorily within the parameters the Egyptian Government has set. Radio Sawa is an important link in our effort to reach out to young people in the Arab world. We believe that its music programming, together with its accurate, objective news, will help to renew our relationship of trust and dialogue in the region. We are hopeful that we can reach an agreement that allows us to reach out more effectively in Cairo. We greatly appreciate your interest in this important project. We will be happy to keep you informed as we make progress on our transmission capabilities in Egypt. Sincerely, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, Chairman. Senator Sununu. Mr. Harb. Mr. Harb. Yes. Since Governor Pattiz mentioned and talked about Sawa and our affect on the radio industry in the Middle East, I will focus more on the television industry. I would like to start by saying Arab independent media is a myth. There is not today an independent Arab media. They are all funded by governments or ruling families or, in some cases, intelligence agencies in the Middle East. So there is not an independent media that we are preventing. However, we are trying to affect indigenous media by trying to raise their professional standards. It is still a bit early to see that effect, but I have noticed a few things in the production values. More channels right now, including Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya and other television channels are imitating the way we present the news. I am not trying to simplify the question, but even Al Jazeera anchors smile now at the end of the newscast. One of the important things as a news director I would love to see--and I am starting to witness some of it--is to set the agenda of those media outlets in the morning, even if they do not imitate or carry what we say. Based on the editorial decisions that we make in the morning, we could influence some director of news on another channel on what stories to carry that day. And you see more American stories coming from the U.S. because they are trying to compete with us. Senator Sununu. A final question before we go to Senator Nelson. Mr. Pattiz, you mentioned Egypt not cooperating in helping to provide broadcast channels for, I think, Radio Sawa in particular. What other countries have shown that kind of resistance to being supportive of these kinds of open media outlets? Mr. Pattiz. Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon. Senator Sununu. And what countries have been most accepting? Mr. Pattiz. Well, almost every place else in the region. We have FM stations throughout the region, all throughout North Africa. We just launched a few months ago--I think it was 5 or 6 months ago--in Morocco. We are getting stunning results, and we are up to about 8 FM stations there now. In Amman, Jordan, a place where you would not think that a station like Radio Sawa would be accepted quite that easily--it is 60 percent Palestinian by birth or by heritage--we are an instantaneous hit. Sawa has maintained its popularity, though its news credibility has gone down a bit--which you would expect from there because of some of the things that have gone on in the region. I think we are doing a really good job in Iraq now that we have FM frequencies rather than just broadcasting on AM frequencies from outside the area. The Persian Gulf countries have been very, very cooperative. I think we have nearly two dozen FM stations on the air right now with the permission of the host governments. Mr. Tomlinson. Mr. Chairman, may I make one parallel point? Senator Sununu. Yes. Mr. Tomlinson. The important thing about satellite broadcasting is that satellite television is going to be to our future what short wave was in the past because satellite television goes over local censors of FM frequencies and enables us to go directly to the people. In the same sense, we are looking at many regions in the world where we want to expand satellite broadcasting, and we have had great success in recent months and recent years in terms of support from the administration and from Congress. There is a great line from The Right Stuff, ``no bucks, no Buck Rogers.'' In the 10 years following the end of the cold war, our budgets for international broadcasting were cut a very real 40 percent, and we have reversed that. I think it is important to get this satellite broadcasting going in this region and others, and we thank you for your attention because I think with your attention will come greater support for all we do. Senator Sununu. Senator Nelson. Senator Nelson. Mr. Chairman, I have a number of things that I want to cover here, but first of all, I want to tell you a story. When I was a kid 17 years old, I was selected to represent America to be taken with a group of adults to speak over Radio Free Europe to the kids behind the Iron Curtain. For a 17-year- old kid, that was quite an experience. Radio Free Europe was broadcasting out of Munich at the time and then after the broadcast, which in itself was a tremendous experience for a 17-year-old, they then took me to the German-Czechoslovakian border at a little village called Tillyschanz where I saw for the first time the attempts to enslave by seeing the strands of barbed wire and the machine gun nest and the watchtower, the guard tower, and the dogs and the perfectly raked soil and the dragon's teeth, which are the concrete pyramids to keep a vehicle from crashing the fence and so forth. I became, at that early age and that experience and then ultimately years later seeing the fall of the Berlin Wall, absolutely convinced it was the right position that our government was taking at that time. Radio Free Europe was considered separate so that it was not an arm of the U.S. Government. So you know I am on your side on this. Now, I want to ask you a little more delicate question. With the success that you are having with the new television station and the radio station, which I hope is true and I hope it is going to get better and better, other than Castro's jamming, why have we not had the success with Radio and TV Marti? I was an original sponsor of that back in the 1980s when I was in the House. Can you contrast the two? Mr. Tomlinson. I think, Senator Nelson, we cannot underplay the impact of that jamming. That jamming has been as intense in Cuba as any place on the face of this Earth in the history of international broadcasting. But we have responded to that situation by, in the first place, trying to get into Cuba cassettes of Television Marti. We have tried to add satellite broadcasting so that if people can develop receivers, they can get it without regard to the jamming. We are seeking additional ways to get into Cuba. It is very difficult because, as you well know, we cannot interfere. We do not want to do anything to interfere with U.S. broadcasting. So it means we have to find a means of getting extra broadcasting into Cuba that does not send signals into the United States. Having said that, we also have been engaged in a great deal of program reform of Marti in recent months. We got a new director of Marti, Pedro Roig. He set about increasing the relevance of programming. He set about making the program, by the way, more news oriented because people are after information. We are focused now on upgrading Marti because we think that Marti can give the same results that we have seen elsewhere if our broadcasting is as professional as it was in Eastern Europe. I was on the broadcasting board that ran Radio Free Europe for better than 8 years, and I came to respect the professionalism of that place. I came to respect, as Senator Biden did, that there was a mission orientation and there was a scholarship level that was brought to that operation. That was professional, professional, professional. That is what we have tried to do in recent months at Marti, and that is what we are going to demand of Marti. So we cannot stop the jamming. But we can reform programming, make sure the programming is relevant to the people of Cuba, and making sure it is relevant to information- deprived people. So often those information-deprived people in Cuba are not interested in what is going on in south Florida. They are interested in what is going on on their own island or what is going on in terms of Cuba and its relations with other countries. Senator Nelson. Is there any reason to believe that now that you are broadcasting on TV Marti off of a satellite geostationary over the eastern Atlantic, that you are getting more into Cuba despite the jamming now that you are going off the satellite? Mr. Tomlinson. Now that we are on satellite? Senator Nelson. Yes. Mr. Tomlinson. No hard evidence yet, but I believe we are going to see that evidence in the coming months as we find ways to get receivers into Cuba because the great thing about the satellite signals is they cannot be jammed if you have a receiver. Now, granted, as soon as we went up with that satellite, there was a big crackdown on little dishes throughout Cuba. This will remain a problem because the local community operations will be looking for those dishes. The dishes of today are very small and, if we can get receivers in, we will be able to get the truth in. Senator Nelson. All right. Back to the Middle East and Central Asia. Has your television station considered broadcasting last week's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings--there were a series on Iraq--and broadcasting them with Arabic subtitles? I would commend it for your consideration because between Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden, they had--and you talked about scholarship--they had a series of witnesses that came forth that were respected scholars and presented a good demonstration of a democracy discussing different ideas. I think it would offer Iraqis a better understanding of the United States and our motives if they were seeing it through the eyes of a hearing instead of just the diet of what they are getting on Arab television. I wish you would. That is something to commend. You do not need to answer. Mr. Harb. We did. Senator Nelson. You already have? Mr. Harb. We covered last week the confirmation hearing for Ambassador Negroponte and we also covered the Armed Forces hearings where Secretary Wolfowitz was speaking and he was asked questions. So we do cover those hearings, live with simultaneous translation in Arabic. Senator Nelson. Did you cover these hearings that I am talking about? Mr. Harb. The Armed Forces one we did. Senator Nelson. Foreign Relations. Mr. Tomlinson. We will check, but you are exactly right. Mr. Harb. But we do cover those hearings. Senator Nelson. I think the substance was in those hearings that Chairman Lugar held, and was different than the substance that was in the Negroponte hearing. Mr. Tomlinson. We catch you. Senator Nelson. OK. Now, I would conclude with this. We have been told both publicly and privately of what Al Jazeera is doing with the truth. Obviously, what you all are doing is one way to try to counter that. Do you have any reason to believe that Al Jazeera is going to become more balanced in its approach as contrasted with what we are being told Al Jazeera is just totally biased? Mr. Tomlinson. It is almost worse than that, Senator. They are willing to go with false information, willing to distort for the purposes of stirring up the people in that region. Senator Nelson. So what can we do? Mr. Pattiz. Well, I think we do what we are doing. I think we provide a different perspective that has not existed in the region. Obviously, the very quick preliminary numbers that we have shown you indicate that we are attracting an audience, and I think we work to continue to build that audience and to put on information that is different. This is a big problem. I have had this conversation with Senator Biden. We are 8 to 9 years late. When the satellite revolution started taking place in the Middle East, you had a confluence of two major events: first of all, the availability of satellite technology which would make it available to anybody who had a satellite dish without the necessity of the host government giving you permission. Second, is the population boom that is taking place where you have large numbers of people under the age of 20 who have absolutely no historical memory of anything that took place because they are certainly not getting it from their media. So we have an opportunity to provide the kind of information that is not readily being supplied in the region, and we have to do that. Obviously, we are going to be doing it. Potentially between Radio Sawa and Alhurra, I think there is just no doubt that we are going to be available to tens of millions, and that is a tremendous opportunity for us. Just to illustrate what it is you were talking about, I was at Alhurra a couple of weeks ago. Mouafac and I were standing by the monitors. We, like every other television network in the world, are monitoring what everybody else is doing. So we have got all the Arab TV satellite stations up on monitors. I watched a promo for Al Jazeera news, and here is what that promo looked like. It showed the Sheikh Yassin funeral. It showed a Hamas demonstration having to do with the Sheikh Yassin funeral. It showed American flags and Israeli flags being stomped on and burned. It immediately cut to a scene of several Hasidic Jews praying at the Western Wall, and then it immediately cut to a scene of Israeli soldiers in conflict with Palestinian youth. And that is the promo that they were using for their news, which they had run over and over again probably for several days. So what we are doing is providing Alhurra. We are the free one. The way we position our station is very different from the way they position their stations. This is not going to be easy. It is not going to be quick, but it is absolutely necessary. I cannot think of a more cost efficient way to reach the region, and to reach the number of people that we can reach in the region, and have the kind of effect that we are showing with Radio Sawa where, by a margin of 2 to 1, Sawa listeners say they have a more positive view of the United States of America than do non-Sawa listeners. Mr. Tomlinson. Senator Nelson, if I could add one more thing. I think American democracy is based on the premise that the people are not stupid. I think that applies in societies other than the United States. When we came out with Sawa, people said, oh, the people of the Arab world will never accept news from Sawa. They boycott American products. Why would they pay any attention to the news on an American-sponsored radio station? And maybe in those early weeks, they did not. Norm talked about the initial impact in Jordan. When only 1 percent of the people said they took Sawa news as credible, even though they were listening to the station in huge numbers. But then as they came to understand that the news was accurate and they could turn on Sawa to find out what was really happening in the world and they could get what was really happening in the world quickly--if you do not have censorship, if you do not have spin, you can get that news out quicker--and then the figures started to grow. Now in the latest survey, you will see that 70 percent of the people who listen to us in Jordan say that our news is credible and believable. I believe this is another manifestation of the fact that, whether it is here or in the Arab world, in the long run the people are not stupid. And if you give them the truth, give them accurate news, in the end we will have an impact. Senator Sununu. Thank you, Senator Nelson. Senator Biden, welcome. Senator Biden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Maybe you all should broadcast in the United States. Seventy percent of the people think the news is credible. I do not want to offend my news folks back here, but I do not think there is any newspaper in America--at any rate, having said that--you would be violating Federal law, if you did, obviously. You are not allowed to do that. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing. I apologize for coming late. As all three of the witnesses know, particularly the chairman and Norm, this is sort of a hobby horse of mine, and I want to start off by complimenting you. You guys are doing a great job. You have gone out and hired a serious person. I am serious. A big deal. The thing I hope and I know that my friend, Senator Nelson, understood, Ken, from what you said about Radio Marti and, for example, the comparison to Radio Free Europe. There were 4 decades of institutional memory, genuine scholarship. As a matter fact, the library at Radio Free Europe was the place where Ph.D. candidates from Harvard and Yale and Stanford and Penn and Georgetown and Delaware went to write their theses to get information because it was hard. We had a hard fight here relative to the Board of International Broadcasters when a lot of people thought, when the wall came down, that we only needed the Voice of America, which is very positive. But there was this gigantic fight. It is the only time in my entire career I ever threatened to filibuster if, in fact, it did not allow for journalistic independence and to keep Radio Free Europe and extend it to Radio Free Asia and so on. Now, you guys are a logical extension of all that, but with almost an illogical conclusion. Norm, even I was skeptical when I sought you out to be on the board. What made me realize it was riding literally on a flight to Los Angeles hearing Westwood One again and the interviews with the rock stars. I am not joking. I really mean it. That package you came up with and sold is essentially a less sophisticated version of what you are doing now. As you said to me, why is the nation which basically invented radio and how to use it and to market it, why the heck were we behind the 8-ball? You have exceeded, I must tell you, my expectations in terms of the rapidity with which all of you have done this. But I suggest to the chairman--and I know how busy we all are, but if you get a chance, Mr. Chairman, to go out to Alhurra to the studio in Springfield, Virginia, and spend, as I did and others have--I guess I was only there a couple hours. It is breathtaking. It is breathtaking. First of all, because of your leadership and the leadership of this committee and the Senate and the House, we were able to give them enough money, though most people did not think it was enough--and not enough time. But it amazed me how quickly you got that studio up and running. Guys like me spend a fair amount of time in studios doing interviews around this town and around this country. I have not seen anything like it. NBC, CBS, CNN. I guess, in part, it is because everything is brand new, but the way you set it up, it is absolutely the state-of-the-art, No. 1. No. 2, what everybody should know is you went out and hired serious people like your colleague from other endeavors. Is there anybody from Al Jazeera you hired? Mr. Harb. Yes. Senator Biden. How many people do you have roughly? Mr. Harb. Four or five. Senator Biden. How about any other Arab television network? Mr. Harb. We have managed to recruit from most leading satellite channels. Senator Biden. And you see their anchors. I mean it. They have every vestige of what has caused American television stations to succeed. They are very attractive anchors, men and women. You guys did it as if you were setting up a new CBS, if it was CBK or something, a new network here. It is amazing. But the most important thing I think is you did what was the key to success in the independent radio stations in the 1950s. You hired indigenous people. Did you all go into this in your testimony about not only indigenous people, you hired here at the ``network headquarters''? My phrase. I know it is not a network headquarters but at headquarters. Tell me about what is in the field. Do you have reporters in the field? Mr. Harb. Yes, we do. Senator Biden. By field I mean, Baghdad, Damascus, wherever. Mr. Harb. Yes, sir, we do have reports based from northern Iraq to even someone on the outskirts of Fallujah right now reporting for us. We have people from Najaf, Iraqi reporters. We have people in---- Senator Biden. And they have cameras? Mr. Harb. They have cameras. They report via camera, via satellite link, or sometimes if it is breaking news, they call us over the phone all from the Middle East. Mr. Pattiz. When you put the news staff of Radio Sawa and the news staff of Alhurra together, we have one of the largest, if not the largest, Arabic language news gathering organizations in the world. Senator Biden. Tell me when my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Senator Sununu. Oh, you are not even close. Senator Biden. Let us talk about radio for a second. Surveys in Morocco said 88 percent of the people in Casablanca and Rabat listen to Radio Sawa. Is there any American radio station with any numbers like that? And do not tell me Westwood One. Mr. Pattiz. Maybe if you included every single Westwood One program that we have on NBC, CBS, and CNN, all of which are our networks. But no. Senator Biden. All kidding aside. Mr. Pattiz. No, it is not possible. Senator Biden. It is not, is it? Mr. Pattiz. No, it really is not. Senator Biden. Why is it not possible? It is important, I think, for people to understand and for me to understand why it is possible there and not here. When I say this, Norm, people look at me and they do not believe. They know American radio. I say it to American broadcasters, American news people, and I say 88 percent, and they say, now, wait a minute. That is not possible. There is not a single TV or radio station that has 88 percent and few have even 88 percent in their own little market. But why? Mr. Pattiz. Well, first of all, there are 10,000 commercial radio stations here in the United States. I mean when I went over there, I could feel it. I could just smell it. There was a hole big enough to drive a fleet of Mack trucks through. The nature of radio over there is different than the case with television. They have a very vibrant television market over there, but in radio it is a vast wasteland. It is government- controlled. It is mostly news and information. It is boring. It is government radio. Senator Biden. That is the point I want you to make. That is an important point for the credibility of what we are doing and why this was a good idea. The second question about radio. Is there an ability to expand the market? Is there another Sawa in the making or is Sawa sufficient? In other words, does it make sense for us to think about multiplying the radio piece or is that sufficient like Radio Free Europe was sufficient with Radio Liberty. Do you understand what I am trying to say? Mr. Pattiz. Yes, absolutely, Senator. My personal opinion? Senator Biden. Yes. Mr. Pattiz. I think now with the launch of Alhurra television, that what we have is a vehicle that is youth oriented, that reaches very effectively on radio an audience that is 30 and under and does it very effectively. And now we have a television outlet that is mass appeal that does not have a particular target audience by formats because television is not a medium of formats. It is a medium of programs. So in television we can target particular audiences based upon the individual programs that we put on the air. I think, considering the resources that we have and the needs that we have, that those services in the Middle East will get the job done. As we become more successful and create more imitators and broaden the market and create competition and create more successful indigenous broadcasters and our audience share as a function of that goes down, that is when we will have to become more like the narrowcasters that exist in America today because there are no broadcasters in America. Everybody is a narrowcaster and everybody talks about Fox News and CNN. Senator Biden. Explain what you mean by narrowcaster because people listening will not know what that means. Mr. Pattiz. The use of the word ``broad,'' refers to reaching a huge percentage of people. It was not unusual for a television network to have a 30 share. Well, it is very unusual fo"
