        "text": "The Foreign relations of Egypt are the Egyptian government's external relations with the outside world. Egypt's foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the Middle East, Africa, and within the Non-Aligned Movement as a whole. Cairo has been a crossroads of the Arab world's commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and religious institutions are at the center of the region's social and cultural landmarks.\n\nEgypt has been seeking to play a role in the resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEgypt played an important role in the negotiations leading to the Madrid Conference of 1991, which, under United States and Soviet sponsorship, brought together all parties in the region, including for the first time a Palestinian delegation, to discuss Middle East peace.\n\nThis support has continued to the present, with former President Hosni Mubarak often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the Sharm El-Sheikh \"Summit of the Peacemakers\" attended by President Bill Clinton and other world leaders.\n\nIn 2000, he hosted two summits at Sharm El-Sheikh and one at Taba in an effort to resume the Camp David negotiations suspended in July 2000, and in June 2003, Mubarak hosted President George W. Bush for another summit on Middle East peace process. Another summit was convened in Sharm El Sheik in early 2005, which was attended by Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. The former Egyptian Chief of Intelligence, General Omar Suleiman, played a substantial role in negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and was highly respected on both sides.\n\nList of

and war. Border control methods can be \"harsh, sometimes lethal.\" This has strained relations with Egypt's southern neighbors, and with Israel and the members of the EU as these immigrants attempt to move on to wealthier countries.[189]\n\nThe dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become a national preoccupation in both countries.[190][191] Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat, fearing that the dam will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile.[192] Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said: \"Survival is not a question of choice, but an imperative of nature.\"[193]\n\nCountry Formal relations established Notes Algeria See Algeria–Egypt relations\n\nAlgeria has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Algiers.\n\nAngola 18 February 1976 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 18 February 1976[194]\n\nAngola has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Luanda.\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo 30 June 1960 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 30 June 1960[195]\n\nDR Congo has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Kinshasa.\n\nDjibouti 22 July 1977 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 22 July 1977, when the first Ambassador of Egypt to Djibouti, Mohamed Samy Heiba, presented his credentials to President Hassan Gouled Aptidon.[196]\n\nDjibouti has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Djibouti City.\n\nEthiopia See Egypt–Ethiopia relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Addis Ababa.\n\nIn 2021, Ethiopia closed its embassy in Cairo due to financial reasons.[197] In November 2022, Ethiopia reopened its embassy in Cairo.[198]\n\nGuinea-Bissau 11 June 1974 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 11 June 1974[199]\n\nEgypt is accredited to Guinea-Bissau from its embassy in Conakry, Guinea.[200]\n\nGuinea-Bissau is accredited to Egypt from its embassy in Algiers, Algeria.\n\nBoth countries are full member of the African Union.\n\nKenya See Egypt–Kenya relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Nairobi.\n\nKenya has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nLibya 3 September 1953 See Egypt–Libya relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 3 September 1953 when first Libyan Minister to Egypt Ibrahim El-Senoussi present his credentials to General Naguib.[201]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Tripoli and a consulate-general in Benghazi.\n\nLibya has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria.\n\nMauritania 21 October 1964 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 21 October 1964 when UAR (Egypt) officially recognized the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.[202] Morocco See Egypt–Morocco relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Rabat.\n\nMorocco has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nNigeria\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Abuja and a consulate-general in Lagos.\n\nNigeria has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nRwanda 10 February 1971 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 February 1971[203]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Kigali.\n\nRwanda has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nSenegal\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Dakar.\n\nSenegal has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nSomalia See Egypt–Somalia relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Mogadishu.\n\nSomalia has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nSouth Africa 1942 See Egypt–South Africa relations\n\nThe first South African mission in Egypt was established in 1942 as a consulate-general.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Pretoria and South Africa has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nBoth countries are full members of the African Union, G-24, Group of 77 and Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nSouth African Department of Foreign Affairs about relations with Egypt\n\nSouth Sudan 9 July 2011 See Egypt–South Sudan relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 9 July 2011[204]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Juba.\n\nSouth Sudan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nSudan 4 January 1956 See Egypt–Sudan relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 4 January 1956 when first ambassador of Egypt to Sudan general Mahmoud Seif El-Yazal Khalifa presented his letters of credentials.[205][206]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Khartoum and a consulate-general in Port Sudan.\n\nSudan has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Aswan.\n\nTanzania 14 November 1962 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 14 November 1962 when Mr. Mustafa F.

To achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance US–Egyptian relations to foster a peace process with Israel. After a seven-year hiatus, both countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations on February 28, 1974.\n\nMilitary cooperation\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the peace treaty with Israel, between 1979 and 2003, the US has provided Egypt with about $19 billion in military aid, making Egypt the second largest non-NATO recipient of US military aid after Israel. Also, Egypt received about $30 billion in economic aid within the same time frame. In 2009, the US provided a military assistance of US$1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$ 1.85 billion in 2024), and an economic assistance of US$250 million (inflation adjusted US$ 355 million in 2024). In 1989 both Egypt and Israel became a Major non-NATO ally of the United States.\n\nMilitary cooperation between the US and Egypt is probably the strongest aspect of their strategic partnership. General Anthony Zinni, the former Commandant of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), once said, \"Egypt is the most important country in my area of responsibility because of the access it gives me to the region.\" Egypt was also described during the Clinton Administration as the most prominent player in the Arab world and a key US ally in the Middle East. US military assistance to Egypt was considered part of the administration's strategy to maintaining continued availability of Persian Gulf energy resources and to secure the Suez Canal, which serves both as an important international oil route and as critical route for US warships transiting between the Mediterranean and either the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Egyptian military provides indirect support for the foreign policy of Egypt in the region. Egypt is the strongest military power on the African continent, and the whole Middle East\n\nWar on Terror\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite differences and periods of friction in relations between the two countries, the US-Egyptian relations under Mubarak have evolved moving beyond the Middle East peace process towards an independent bilateral friendship. It was in the US interest that Egypt was able to present moderate voice in Arab councils and persuade other Arab states to join the peace process and to normalize their relations with the US.\n\nHowever lately Egyptian-American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the US in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks, but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed US military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq, continued to oppose US occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with US requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella.\n\nThe issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in Iraq, despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree.\n\nPost-Mubarak relations with U.S.\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 21, 2012, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood's son, Sam, was detained by the Egyptian government and not allowed to leave the country as part of a politically charged criminal investigation by the Egyptian government into the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) monitoring local elections in Egypt. LaHood's son is the Egypt director of the International Republican Institute. The Egyptian government has detained twelve NGO representatives from leaving Egypt.[224]\n\nOn February 5, 2012, Egyptian authorities charged LaHood's son and 42 other individuals with \"spending money from organizations that were operating in Egypt without a license.\" Nineteen Americans are part of the 42 charged. The U.S. government has made it clear that $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt could be withheld if the investigation is not finished quickly. Faiza Abu Naga, Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation, is seen as the person pushing the investigation forward, straining U.S. and Egypt relations.[225]\n\nOn 7 October 2020, in line with Egypt's Vision 2030, US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Egypt's Ministry of International Cooperation signed an agreement to add $22.8 million to the five-year Inclusive Economic Governance bilateral assistance agreement. The funding was intended to improve the investment environment and empower women to join the labor force.[226]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Washington, DC and consulates-general in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and New York City.[227]\n\nUnited States has an embassy in Cairo.[228]\n\nCountry Formal Relations Began Notes Afghanistan 10 May 1928 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 May 1928 when has been signed Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and Egypt.[229]\n\nAfghanistan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Kabul.\n\nArmenia 9 March 1992 See Armenia–Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 9 March 1992[230]\n\nEgypt was one of the first countries in the Arab world which recognized the independent Armenia in 1991.\n\nIn May 1992, the first diplomatic mission of Armenia in the Arab East was inaugurated in Cairo.[231]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Yerevan.\n\nEgypt had a sizable Armenian community since the 19th century. Many ethnic Armenian Egyptians remain in Egypt to this day.\n\nAzerbaijan 27 March 1992\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 27 March 1992.[232]\n\nOn December 26, 1991, the Arab Republic of Egypt recognized the independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan.[233]\n\nAzerbaijan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Baku.\n\nBahrain 5 June 1972 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 5 June 1972.[234]\n\nBahrain has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Manama.\n\nBangladesh 15 September 1973 See Bangladesh-Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 15 September 1973.[235]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh has an embassy in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nEgypt was one of the first Arab states to recognize Bangladesh's independence.[236] President Anwar Al Sadat enjoyed a close rapport with Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In 1973, Egypt gifted 30 tanks to the Bangladesh Army.\n\nBoth nations are members of the OIC and the Developing 8 Countries, and identified among the Next Eleven economies. Present-day relations are characterized by a growing trade and economic relationship.\n\nChina 30 May 1956 See China–Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 30 May 1956[237]\n\nChina has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Beijing and consulates-general in Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nGeorgia 11 May 1992 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 11 May 1992[238]\n\nEgypt is accredited to Georgia from its embassy in Yerevan, Armenia.\n\nGeorgia has an embassy in Cairo.[239]\n\nGeorgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relation with Egypt\n\nGeorgian foreign minister visits Egypt\n\nIndia 18 August 1947 See Egypt–India relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 18 August 1947[240]\n\nModern Egypt-India relations go back to the contacts between Saad Zaghloul and Mohandas Gandhi on the common goals of their respective movements of independence. In 1955, Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser and India under Jawaharlal Nehru became the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. During the 1956 War, Nehru stood supporting Egypt to the point of threatening to withdraw his country from the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1967, following the Six-Day War, India supported Egypt and the Arabs. In 1977, New Delhi described the visit of President Anwar al-Sadat to Jerusalem as a \"brave\" move and considered the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel a primary step on the path of a just settlement of the Middle East problem. Major Egyptian exports to India include raw cotton, raw and manufactured fertilizers, oil and oil products, organic and non-organic chemicals, leather and iron products. Major imports into Egypt from India are cotton yarn, sesame, coffee, herbs, tobacco and lentils. The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum is also currently negotiating the establishment of a natural gas-operated fertilizer plant with another Indian company. In 2004 the Gas Authority of India Limited, bought 15% of Egypt Nat Gas distribution and marketing company.\n\nIn 2008 Egyptian investment in India was worth some 750 million dollars, according to the Egyptian ambassador.[241]\n\nPresident Mubarak of Egypt visited India in 2008. During the visit he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.[242]\n\nIn 2023 India has invited Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as the chief guest of the 74th Republic Day parade.[243] Also Representing the main branches of the Egyptian armed forces, 144 soldiers participated in the parade.[244]\n\nIndonesia 10 June 1947 See Egypt–Indonesia relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 10 June 1947.[245]\n\nIndonesia has an embassy in Cairo and Egypt has an embassy in Jakarta.\n\nEgypt was one of the first countries to recognize Indonesia's independence.\n\nGamel Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia were two of the five founding members of the Non-aligned Movement.\n\nBoth countries are members of the OIC, the Non-aligned Movement, and the G20 developing nations.\n\nIran 1939\n\n(Diplomatic relations severed 1980)\n\nSee Egypt–Iran relations\n\nIn 1939, diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran were upgraded to ambassadorial level, and Youssef Zulficar Pasha was appointed as Egypt's first ambassador in Tehran. In the same year, Princess Fawzia of Egypt, the sister of King Farouk I, married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran. However, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Egypt's relations with Iran have been mostly strained. Egypt is the only Arab country not to have an embassy in Iran.[246] Contentious issues include Egypt's signing of the Camp David Accords with Israel in 1979, its support for Iraq in Iran's eight-year conflict, the Islamic Republic's hailing of Khalid Islambouli, the late President Anwar Sadat's assassin as a religious hero, seeing as there was both a street and mural named after him (however, the honorer was changed to Muhammad al-Durrah, the 12-year-old Palestinian boy shot and killed during the outset of the Second Intifada), and close Egyptian relations with the United States, and most of the Western European countries. In 2007, relations between the two have thawed in the fields of diplomacy and economic trade, only to collapse during the Gaza War (2008–09) when the Iranian and Egyptian politicians exchanged blames over inaction towards the escalation. Despite wavering tensions between Tehran and Cairo, the two countries are members of the OIC and the Developing 8\n\nIn 2010, leaked diplomatic cables revealed that Mubarak expressed animosity toward Iran in private meetings, saying the Iranian leaders are \"big, fat liars\", and that Iran's backing of terrorism is \"well-known\".[247] According to one American report, Mubarak views Iran as the primary long-term challenge facing Egypt, and an Egyptian official said that Iran is running agents inside Egypt in an effort to subvert the Egyptian regime. he also stated that if Iran will reach a nuclear weapons, Egypt will also consider reaching such weapons.[248]\n\nIraq See Egypt-Iraq relations\n\nSince 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's \"natural role\" among Arab countries. In January 1984, Iraq successfully led Arab efforts within the OIC to restore Egypt's membership. However, Iraqi-Egyptian relations were broken in 1990 after Egypt joined the UN coalition that forced Iraq out of Kuwait. Relations have steadily improved in recent years, and Egypt is now one of Iraq's main trade partners (formerly under the Oil-for-Food Programme).\n\nIsrael 26 January 1980 See Egypt–Israel relations\n\nThe state of war between both countries which dated back from the 1948 Arab–Israeli War ended in 1973 with the Egypt–Israel peace treaty a year after the Camp David Accords. Since then, relations have improved.\n\nBeing a pioneer of peace making in the region and driven from its belief that a peaceful Middle East is the best solution for the development of Egypt, the third Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's groundbreaking trip to Israel in 1977, the 1978 Camp David Accords, and the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty represented a fundamental shift in the politics of the region; from a strategy of confrontation to one of peace as a strategic choice. Egypt was subsequently ostracized by other Arab states and ejected from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989.\n\nHowever, due to circumstances of today's Israeli–Palestinian conflict, full normalization of relations between these two countries is still halted and sometimes fought against in both countries. The Egyptian ambassador to Tel Aviv is often withdrawn, and the peace has been called a cool peace due to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Tel Aviv and a consulate-general in Eilat.\n\nIsrael has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria.\n\nJapan 1922 See Egypt-Japan relations\n\nEgypt-Japan relations are described by the Egyptian ambassador to Japan as a \"very strong friendship\",[249] with embassies mutually established.[250] At present, the two nations maintain a cordial relationship with strong economic and trade relations.[251]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Tokyo.\n\nJapan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nJordan 28 May 1947 See Egypt-Jordan relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 28 May 1947 when Mohamed Bey Yassin, Egyptian Minister in Transjordan with residence in Baghdad presented his credentials.[252]\n\nOn April 6, 1972, the Egyptian government severed relations in protest for a Jordanian plan for federation with the West Bank, which didn't take PLO interests unto considerations. These relations were restored on September 11, 1973.[253] They were severed again in 1979, this time by the Jordanian government, in protest for the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Following the outbreak of the Lebanon War of 1982, the US government put pressure on both governments to reach accommodation for the purpose of formulating a joint peace strategy vis-a-vis the Israeli government,[254] and relations were restored on September 25, 1984.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Amman.\n\nJordan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nKazakhstan 6 March 1992 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 6 March 1992.[255]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Almaty, Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan has an embassy in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nIn 2006, President Mubarak of Egypt visited Kazakhstan on the third leg of a three-country tour. During the visit he met with Kazakh President Nazarbayev. Mubarak stated that 30 trade and economic cooperation agreements had been concluded between the two countries.[256]\n\nKuwait 2 December 1961 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 2 December 1961[257]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Kuwait City.\n\nKuwait has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nLebanon 30 November 1944 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 30 November 1944 when was opened Legation of Lebanon in Cairo.[258]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Beirut.\n\nLebanon has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria.\n\nMalaysia 1957[259] See Egypt–Malaysia relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nGamel Abdel Nasser gave a headquarters for the Malay Association in Egypt as a gift to Malaysia in 1959.\n\nBoth countries are members of the OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nMongolia 2 April 1963 See Egypt–Mongolia relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 2 April 1963[260]\n\nCairo currently hosts Mongolia's only embassy on the African continent.[261][262]\n\nOman\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Muscat.\n\nOman has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nPakistan 20 October 1947 See Egypt–Pakistan relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 20 October 1947 when the Egyptian Government has agreed to the establishment of a Pakistan Embassy in Cairo and to the appointment Mr. J. A. Rahim as Chargé d'Affaires.[263]\n\nPakistan and Egypt have diplomatic and trade relations. Both countries are members of the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), \"the Next Eleven\" and the \"D8\". Relations between the two countries were established after Pakistan was established. Pakistan President General Muhammad Ayub Khan, visited Egypt in 1959 and Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser visited Pakistan in 1960.[citation needed]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Islamabad.\n\nPakistan has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nPalestine See Egypt–Palestine relations\n\nEgypt has representative offices in Ramallah and in Gaza City.\n\nPalestine has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nPhilippines 1955-01-18 See Egypt–Philippines relations\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Manila.\n\nPhilippines has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nQatar 1 November 1971 See Egypt-Qatar relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 1 November 1971[264]\n\nLately, relations have not been at its best. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, has described the 2013 political transition in Egypt as a \"military coup\".[265] It is worth mentioning that the main problem between the two governments is the Qatari support to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.[265]\n\nThe Egyptian government, along with those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar on 5 June 2017. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced it was closing its air and sea ports to Qatari transportation. The Egyptian, Saudi, Bahraini, and Emirati governments cited Qatar's continuing support for \"terrorism\", such as the Muslim Brotherhood.[266] Islam Hassan argues \"Egypt has had troubled relations with Qatar for many years, except of Mohamed Morsi's period in power. The Egyptian government has seen Qatar as a source of instability. TheEgyptian regime also sees that Qatar challenges its rule by financing the Muslim Brotherhood, and other organizations, which the regime has outlawed and consider terrorist organizations. Thus, the Egyptian regime has been trying to push back on Qatar by any means. The current issue between the Saudi bloc and Qatar seemed to be an opportunity to put pressure on Qatar to stop financing the Muslim Brotherhood, its affiliates, and supporters, and to support the Sisi regime.\"[267][268]\n\nSaudi Arabia 7 May 1936 See Egypt–Saudi Arabia relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 7 May 1936 when was signed a Treaty by Egypt and Saudi Arabia in Cairo which included Egypt's recognition of Saudi Arabia as an independent and sovereign state.[269]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate-general in Jeddah.\n\nSaudi Arabia has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria.\n\nSouth Korea 13 April 1995 See Egypt–South Korea relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 13 April 1995.[270]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Seoul, South Korea.[271]\n\nSouth Korea has an embassy in Cairo.[272]\n\nBilateral Trade 2011:\n\nExports: 18.1 billion US dollars\n\nImports: 802 million US dollars\n\nThe number of South Koreans living in Egypt in 2011 was about 905.\n\nSouth Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade about relations with Egypt\n\nForeign relations of South Korea#Europe.[273]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Damascus.\n\nSyria has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nThailand 27 September 1954 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 27 September 1954[274]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Bangkok.\n\nThailand has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nTurkey 8 May 1925 See also Egypt–Turkey relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 8 May 1925.[275]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Ankara and a Consulate General in Istanbul.\n\nTurkey has an embassy in Cairo[276] and a Consulate General in Alexandria.[277]\n\nTrade volume between the two countries was US$5.25 billion in 2018 (Egyptian exports/imports: 2.19/3.06 billion USD).[278]\n\n100,971 Egyptian tourists visited Turkey in 2017.[278]\n\nYunus Emre Institute has a local headquarters in Cairo since 2010.[279]\n\nEgypt was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until 1805.\n\nThere is a free trade agreement in force between the two countries.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates 10 January 1972 See Egypt-United Arab Emirates relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 10 January 1972.[280]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate-general in Dubai.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nVietnam 1 September 1963\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 1 September 1963.[281]\n\nVietnam first opened its commercial representative office in Egypt in 1958, and opened an embassy in Cairo in 1963.\n\nEgypt's embassy in Hanoi was opened in 1964.\n\nYemen 11 April 1946 Both countries established diplomatic relations on 11 April 1946[282]\n\nSee also: Egypt–European Union relations\n\nEuropean Union relations with Egypt are based on a partnership relation within the Euro – Mediterranean and Middle East area, which is of vital strategic importance and a key external relations priority for the EU.\n\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched at the 1995 Barcelona Conference between the European Union and its originally 12 Mediterranean Partners: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, and the Palestinian Authority. Libya currently has observer status at certain meetings. Since the enlargement, in May 2004 and January 2007, the co-operation and needs covers 35 countries, the EU of 27, including Cyprus and Malta and the 10 Mediterranean Partners.\n\nEgypt has also taken an active role regarding Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, such as its participation in the technical meeting of which it was the speaker for the Arab group. Additionally, the first meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary assembly was co-chaired by an Egyptian.\n\nEgypt has been one of the leading recipients among the Mediterranean partners in terms of total funds received from the MEDA programme, the principal financial instrument of the European Union for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is focused on policy-led, national structural reform and liberalisation programmes with a sector-wide approach.\n\nThe EU is Egypt's biggest trading partner currently accounting for 42% of Egyptian exports and 37% of imports, with the balance of trade still in the EU's favour. Trade between the EU and Egypt has risen by more than 5% in the last five years to reach around 11.6 billion euro in 2004. Egypt's main exports to the EU in 2004 were energy (39%), textiles and clothing (15%), agricultural products (9%), and chemicals (5%). Major imports from the EU were power generating machinery (21%), chemicals (16%), transport equipment (16%), and food and agricultural products (10%). Egypt has a serious but improving trade deficit that has put considerable pressure on the Egyptian pound.\n\nTrade relations with the EU are good although there are several outstanding trade and phyto-sanitary issues. These range from specific market access issues and difficulties for businesses facing a highly regulated and complex system through to restrictions in the export of agricultural goods (potatoes) and fishery products because they do not conform with EU quality norms.\n\nEgypt is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\n\nSome time after the starting of the Arab Spring, in March 2011 the European Union adopted the joint declaration ' A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean', aimed at making a number of initiatives in the field of civic society support, financial assistance and further access to the EU market dependent upon advancement in the democratization process.[283]\n\nAs far as Egypt was concerned this declaration envisioned the further deepening of the previous Free Trade Agreement stipulated in 2004, geared towards the inclusion of areas such as trade in services, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, and investment protection. To the 2011 declaration, a preliminary phase of the negotiations followed in June 2013, when the EU and Egypt began an exploratory dialogue on how to deepen trade and investment relations, in particular through the possible negotiation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA).[284]\n\nIn August 2014, the European Union discussed the possibility of revising provision of aid to Egypt.[285] However, divisions over the appropriate stance to adopt among European diplomats persisted, coupled by the fear that the vacuum might be soon filled by other actors, following a Saudi Foreign Minister's declaration that the Kingdom was ready to step in[286] and those of Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi about the possibility to appeal to Russia for foreign aid.[287] Therefore, the only measure upon which the Foreign Ministers agreed was to suspend the sale of arms and materials that could be used for repression,[286] but fell short to halt aid program which could damage civil society.\n\nEarlier in July 2013, EU High Representative Catherine Ashton had visited Egypt in an attempt to promote reconciliation among the parties involved. She is credited for being the only foreign diplomat to get access to deposed president Mohamed Morsi.[288] In an official statement released at the end of a following visit held in April 2014, the Representative raised the issue of the death penalties and incarceration of journalists and activists.[289] At the same time, her later declarations about el-Sisi's bid for presidential candidacy as \"difficult\" but \"brave\"[290] sparked harsh criticism among supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, who claimed the Representative, who advanced logistical reasons, did not make any efforts to get in touch with them and members of their Anti-Coup Alliance.[291]\n\nIn April 2014, the European Union agreed to conduct electoral monitoring, for the first time, in occasion of the Presidential elections scheduled for 26/27 May 2014. Other organizations declined to join, as in their opinion this would legitimize what they called an unlawful take on power.[292]\n\nA contract for the sale of 30 Rafale fighter jets was signed between the defense ministries of Egypt and France in May 2021. The official value of the contract was not disclosed at first and was later exposed to be worth 3.75 billion euro or $4.5 billion, by an investigative website called Disclose. In December 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron received criticism for not controlling the sale of weapons to Egypt on its poor human rights record, stating counter-terrorism concerns. The Egyptian defense ministry cited that the deal would be supported via a 10-year loan without disclosing its value or any further details. Rights organizations have denounced the deal and accused the French president of overlooking the increasing violation of freedom in Egypt under the regime of President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. France's armed forces, finance, and foreign ministries were unavailable for comment. However, French officials claim that Paris, under one of its policies, is avoiding criticism of countries on their human rights records to work with them effectively in private.[293]\n\nOn 3 February 2022, around 175 Members of European Parliament wrote a joint letter to foreign ministers and ambassadors to the UN Human Rights Council and requested them to secure the establishment of a UN human rights monitoring and reporting mechanism on Egypt. The MEPs were concerned that despite devastating human rights crisis in Egypt, the international communities persistently failed to take any meaningful action to address the situation. The Egyptian authorities, under President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, have \"brutally and systematically\" repressed all forms of dissent and severely curtailed civic space.[294]\n\nCountry Formal relations established Notes Albania 14 March 1956 See Albania–Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 14 March 1956[295]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Tirana.[296]\n\nAlbania has an embassy in Cairo.[297]\n\nAustria\n\nAustria has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Vienna.\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgium has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Brussels.\n\nBulgaria 5 November 1925 See Bulgaria–Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 5 November 1925[298]\n\nBulgaria has an embassy in Cairo.[299]\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Sofia.\n\nCroatia 1 October 1992 See Croatia–Egypt relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 1 October 1992[300]\n\nCroatia has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Zagreb.\n\nCyprus See Cyprus–Egypt relations\n\nDiplomatic relations between both countries were established soon after Cyprus gained its independence in 1960.\n\nCyprus has an embassy in Cairo.\n\nEgypt has an embassy in Nicosia.\n\nDuring an April 2009 meeting at ministerial level, the countries explored ways to develop closer ties, with plans for increased collaboration both on tourism and energy related activities.
