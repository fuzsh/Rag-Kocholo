He had nearly a quarter of a century of service with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its Standard Reference Data Program. From 2004 to 2001, He was senior executive for Information International Associates (Oak Ridge TN) and in 2011 founded R&R Data Services (Gaithersburg MD). Rumble’s expertise in scientific data management and scientific informatics, as well as his broad scientific background, has expanded both company's breadth of experience and knowledge in managing scientific and technical information.\n\nAt NIST, Rumble led development of scientific and technical databases. Under his leadership, NIST produced and sold more than 70 PC databases of scientific information, generating millions of dollars of\n\nannual revenue. Dr. Rumble led NIST into the Internet and Web eras with the release of over 25 online data systems in virtually every area of science and engineering. When he left NIST, Rumble had oversight of direct customer service throughout the world as Chief of the NIST Measurement Services Division. The Division provides fee-based services to make instruments and measurements directly traceable to the fundamental units. It also provides critically evaluated databases in many areas of science and technology. During his time at NIST, he also worked closely with industry on database standards, including an international standard for industrial data exchange (ISO 10303). In 1998, he was elected President of the CODATA, the ICSU Committee on Data for Science and Technology), which is the leading international group for scientific and technical data.\n\nIn addition to his service to CODATA, Dr. Rumble is a Fellow of the ASTM International, a Fellow of ASM International, a foreign member of the Russian Federation Academy of Metrology, a Fellow of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and recipient of the U.S. Department of Commerce Silver Medal. In 1993–94, Rumble was a Department of Commerce Fellow working in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. In 2006, Dr. Rumble was awarded the CODATA Prize for his accomplishments. He has written and lectured extensively on scientific data management. Dr. Rumble holds a Ph.D. in chemical physics from Indiana University.\n\nDaniel Schaffer is a senior communications specialist with TWAS, the academy of sciences for the developing world, in Trieste, Italy, a UNESCO-affiliated organization dedicated to building scientific capacity in the developing world. He has written on science and technology issues both in the developed and developing world for more than 20 years. Earlier in his career, he served as director of communications at the University of Tennessee's Energy, Environment and Resources Center and an editor and speechwriter for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States.\n\nHe has published books with Harvard University Press, Johns Hopkins University Press and World Scientific, and has produced educational programmes for WCBS-TV in New York City and award-winning documentaries aired on public television stations in the United States. He was the founding editor and editor-in-chief of Forum, a science policy journal published by the University of Tennessee, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He holds a Ph.D. from Rutgers University, USA, where he studied issues related to urban and suburban growth.\n\nCurtis E. Woodcock is a Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment at Boston University. His research specializations include remote sensing, particularly of land cover and land use change. He currently serves as the Team Leader of the USGS/NASA Landsat Science Team; Co-chairs the Land Cover Characteristics Implementation Team for GOFC-GOLD (Global Observations of Forests and Land Cover Dynamics); is a member of NASA’s Land Cover and Land Use Change Science Team.\n\nHuanming Yang co-founded BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute) in 1999 and is currently its President and Professor. He and his collaborators have made a significant contribution to the Human Genome Project, the HapMap Project, and the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as to sequencing and analyzing genomes of the first Asian individual, rice, chicken, silkworm, giant panda, ant, cucumber, maize, soybean, and many microorganisms. Dr. Yang has received many awards and honors, including Research Leader of the Year by Scientific American in 2002 and Award in Biology by the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) in 2006. He was elected as a Foreign Member of EMBO in 2006, an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007, a Fellow of TWAS in 2008, and a Foreign Fellow of Indian National Science Academy in 2009.\n\nTilahun Yilma is the Director and Distinguished Professor of Virology at the International Laboratory of Molecular Biology (ILMB) at UC Davis.
