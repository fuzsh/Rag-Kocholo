        "text": "Central to the story of the Egyptian diplomat Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s time as secretary general of the United Nations was his relationship with the US. By the end of his controversial five years in the post, from the start of 1992 to the end of 1996, Boutros-Ghali, who has died aged 93, believed that he had served the world body well. But he was also convinced that he was a victim of American domestic politics. Although he always sought to shrug off the US administration’s refusal to support renewal of his mandate, he regretted what he saw as the vendetta that undermined his endeavours to improve the UN’s effectiveness of the world organisation in the post cold war age.\n\nBoutros-Ghali had been consistently demonised by the Republican party. He also had his critics among the Democrats. However he convinced himself – possibly quite wrongly – that President Bill Clinton had decided to drop him in the belief that to do otherwise would lose precious votes for his own run for re-election.\n\nThe experience reinforced Boutros-Ghali’s view that the US, the only remaining superpower, was incapable of providing consistent leadership and lacked the commitment to turn the UN into a credible instrument of international security. So he devoted himself to championing the interests of developing countries, especially of the French-speaking world.\n\nFrom 1997 until 2002 he acted as secretary general of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Living most of the time in Paris, Boutros- Ghali also supported a campaign for the establishment of a UN parliamentary assembly, and was director of Egypt’s National Council of Human Rights (2003-2012). His memoir of his tenure at the UN, Unvanquished: A US-UN Saga (1999), confirmed the disappointments he suffered there.\n\nAll along, Boutros-Ghali had an uneasy relationship with the Americans. President George HW Bush made no secret of US misgivings when, in 1991, Boutros-Ghali put himself forward as a candidate for the UN post. Then, in the summer of 1992, only a few months after “Boo-Boo’s” election, they clashed famously over the UN’s role in Bosnia and Somalia, and the Americans tried to force his resignation. Clinton, inaugurated as president at the start of 1993, never once invited him to the White House for one-to-one talks. Boutros-Ghali, fatally, made little attempt to curry support with the US Congress or the American media.\n\nYet, Boutros-Ghali, born in Cairo to Youssef and Sophie (nee Sharobim), might have been expressly bred for the top UN post. As an Egyptian, he was African enough to win acceptance among Africa’s UN membership. But as a member of a distinguished Coptic Christian family (his grandfather had been Egypt’s first Coptic prime minister, and his father had served as finance minister) he was a sophisticated intellectual, who had moved from academia to politics, served as President Anwar Sadat’s minister of state for foreign affairs (1977-91) and then for a short time as deputy foreign minister, and was fully experienced in international diplomacy. He was considered almost – if not quite – “one of us” by the western powers.\n\nFrance championed him because he had studied international law at the Sorbonne, because French was his preferred language, and because France, next to Egypt, was his favourite country. The Russians and Chinese were confident that he would be his own man and not a western puppet. Though he was more comfortable in the francophone world, Boutros-Ghali also spoke fluent English. And though he was Arab, he was not a Muslim, and his wife Leia (nee Nadler), a second-generation Egyptian, was Jewish.\n\nHe was excoriated by Muslims and remained under threat of assassination because he had joined Sadat in 1977 on the historic journey to Jerusalem and afterwards played a key role in the Camp David negotiations between Egypt and Israel. But by the time Boutros-Ghali became UN secretary general, the first stirrings of a new mood towards a wider Middle East peace settlement were apparent, and the Arab members of the UN accepted his election without protest. However, the Americans considered Boutros-Ghali was already too old when he put himself up for election in 1991, and worse, too arrogant, too close to France, too preoccupied with the problems of the African continent.\n\nWith the end of the cold war Bush was consumed with his vision of a New World Order. He questioned whether Boutros-Ghali had the stamina and dynamism to steer the UN into uncharted territory. Bush backed Canada’s Brian Mulroney for the UN post, but did not want to offend Egypt by casting a veto against Boutros-Ghali.\n\nThe British too were lukewarm, and had another preferred candidate. But Boutros-Ghali, championed by the French president, François Mitterrand, lobbied hard. He gave an undertaking, which he failed to keep, not to seek re-election after his first term. Late in November 1991, after a series of secret ballots in the security council, Boutros-Ghali emerged the victor with 11 votes out of 15 in his favour, and of course no veto from any of the permanent members.\n\nBoutros-Ghali was taller than photographs usually projected. He was an austere dresser, normally sporting well-cut suits and only rarely allowing himself any informality. A workaholic, to his wife’s disappointment he took little interest in New York’s social glitter. Nobody ever accused him of courting popularity. He gained the muted respect of senior aides, but reluctant to delegate, he often failed to inspire their loyalty. He was widely perceived as stiff, autocratic, cynical and uncaring. Yet among confidants he could be warm and funny and exercise an old world charm. He was an enthralling raconteur.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York each lent several masterpieces for display in the elegant town-house occupied by the secretary general. But Boutros-Ghali kept pride of place for a series of Matisse drawings, a gift from one of the artist’s models. Many years ago, before his marriage to Leia he hastened to explain, he had had a relationship with her, and she gave him the drawings on his appointment.\n\nDaunting challenges faced Boutros-Ghali after his installation in his lofty 38th floor office in the UN’s headquarters. During the cold war, the UN’s potential had been stymied by the east-west divide and the frequent use of the Soviet veto. Now it was at last placed to fulfil its promise: to address global problems of the environment, of population, of women, of development and human rights, and above all, to help build an institutional framework for international peace and security. As a first step he decided to streamline the bulging UN secretariat, reducing the number of under secretaries and appointing high-calibre personnel. In deference to American complaints about inefficiency and over-spending, the US was invited to nominate the person to head the top budget and management job.\n\nBoutros-Ghali’s aim was to set in motion a radical reform programme to relaunch the UN during its 50th anniversary in 1995. In this task he was encouraged by the first ever summit of the security council, which commissioned him to draw up a blueprint for the improvement of the “UN’s capacity for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and peacekeeping”.\n\nIn June 1992, he came up with his answer, the ambitious Agenda for Peace – easily the best reform proposals yet put forward for the UN. He envisaged a revamped organisation with enough teeth to stifle conflict and promote peace settlements. He called on member governments to create a standby peacekeeping army by establishing specially trained peacekeeping units for deployment at short notice under the UN command. They would have to be available both for peacekeeping duties and to underpin preventive diplomacy by interposing themselves between potential adversaries. The Agenda for Peace also insisted on new measures to end the UN’s chronic financial crisis, and on greater use of regional organisations for the implementation of security council mandates.\n\nMember states professed to welcome Boutros-Ghali’s recommendations – but failed to act on them. They, and he, had other preoccupations. By mid-1992, the UN was already engulfed by peace-keeping operations in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, as well as in Cambodia. The security council, its members divided over the best course of action in Bosnia, was nevertheless adopting mandate after mandate, charging the secretary general with running the UN Protection Force in Bosnia and Croatia, with the enforcement of “safe havens” in Bosnia and supervision of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. He warned that the UN could only accomplish this if the membership provided him with enough properly trained and equipped forces, and were prepared to pay the costs.\n\nRashly, he also complained that Yugoslavia was “a rich man’s war” because the western powers were focusing too much on ex-Yugoslavia at the expense of Somalia, of Afghanistan and other trouble spots. Britain and the US responded with outspoken criticism of Boutros-Ghali’s UN stewardship. Matters were made still worse when he accused Britain of treating him like “a wog”.\n\nRelations with Britain were gradually improved; but with the US they steadily deteriorated. The Republicans depicted Boutros-Ghali as a sinister, power-hungry figure planning to impose world government. Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, became vociferous in demanding Boutros-Ghali’s head. As US ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright (promoted to become secretary of state in the second Clinton administration) campaigned to bar Boutros-Ghali from a second term. She charged that he had failed to initiate vital administrative and budgetary reforms, and betrayed the security council’s trust.\n\nAll this persuaded Clinton that Boutros-Ghali’s candidacy was a thorn in his re-election campaign. Without forewarning, the secretary of state, Warren Christopher, informed Boutros-Ghali that the US was prepared to veto his re-election. As consolation prize,the US was prepared to propose a one-year extension of his term, allowing him to remain until his 75th birthday.\n\nBoutros-Ghali curtly dismissed Christopher’s proposition. He might have accepted two more years – enough to complete his reform programme. But a mere 12 months were interpreted as an insult. Even though all other members of the security council initially cast votes inhis favour, the US refused to alter course. In mid-December, the others caved in. In his place the security council unanimously elected Kofi Annan.\n\nBoutros-Ghali had been the sixth incumbent of the secretary general’s post, but only the first to serve a full term after the cold war. It was a unique opportunity to adapt the UN for a new world freed from the shackles of east-west confrontation. During his first couple of years he played a fairly sure hand. With his Agenda for Peace and his efforts to trim the bloated UN bureaucracy and improve coordination with the its specialised, autonomous organisations, Boutros-Ghali demonstrated his leadership qualities. But from the outset it was evident that he had a poor understanding of political realities and lacked the personality to lobby effectively, work with the media or to gain public understanding for his ideas.\n\nThen came the conflicts in Bosnia and Somalia, with the UN blamed – often quite wrongly – for many of the ills that beset international efforts to secure peace. This set Boutros-Ghali at odds with the US, and to a lesser degree with Britain. They lost confidence in him, and he, feeling increasingly embattled, seemed to lose nerve in his ability to achieve reform, acting more and more on the defensive. His decision to run for a second term, breaking the undertaking that he would keep to on, provoked embarrassment among UN member countries friendly to him.\n\nThe powers of the secretary general will always be severely circumscribed by the policy dictates of the security council. Boutros-Ghali could never have met all the expectations that were vested in him. Even so, had he continued with his Agenda for Peace in the second half of his term of office, he might have gone down in the annals of the United Nations as a significant player in post cold war politics. As it is, he will more likely be remembered as a diplomat who began his tenure at the UN with impressive reforming zeal, but ended it, disillusioned and frustrated, and without the tangible achievements he had sought to round off a lifetime of public service.\n\nHe is survived by Leia."
