        "text": "On November 4, 1995, then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin attended a peace rally in Tel Aviv’s Kings Square. Speaking to the crowd of one lakh people, Rabin said, \"I always believed that most people want peace and are ready to take a risk for it.\"\n\nThe rally was conducted in support of the Oslo Accords -- a series of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) that aimed to establish a framework for peace between the two parties in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe rally ended at 9.30 pm. As Rabin walked down the city hall steps toward the open door of his car, a young Jewish man shot him with a Beretta 84F .380 ACP caliber semi-automatic pistol. Rabin was rushed to a hospital where he died from blood loss and a punctured lung.\n\nYitzhak Rabin's assassination was a reminder of the fate of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who was killed 14 years before him.\n\nYitzhak Rabin and Anwar Sadat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in different years, for trying to bring peace to the troubled Middle East. But the Nobel, and their efforts, cost them their lives.\n\nCoincidentally, their killers were radical members of their own communities, who were angry at them for \"betraying\" their country by advocating peace.\n\nANWAR SADAT AND THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS\n\nSince its birth in 1948, Israel has found itself in conflict with its Arab neighbours and such was the antagonism that the newborn nation had to face a war against five Arab countries.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel captured more territories from its Arab neighbours -- the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.\n\nEgypt, undergoing an economic crisis, found it hard to counter Israel, which was backed strongly by the United States and other Western powers. But the humiliation in 1967 forced the new president, Anwar Sadat, to launch a daring attack on the Jewish state to regain the lost territory.\n\nIn 1973, Egypt joined hands with Syria to launch a surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. With the Jewish army busy observing the holy day, the armies of Egypt and Syria made inroads into the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights, respectively. Other Arab nations, like Iraq and Jordan, also backed Egypt and Syria in the 1973 war.\n\nAfter the initial surprise, the Israeli Defense Forces counterattacked and recaptured the Golan Heights and most of the Sinai Peninsula. Israel emerged victorious, but with heavy casualties.\n\nEgypt's Anwar Sadat realised that the lost territories couldn't be won back through military campaigns. So he took the diplomatic route and sought the US's support in recovering territories lost to Israel.\n\nIn 1977, Sadat undertook a bold journey to Jerusalem, offering Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin a peace treaty in return for the occupied Sinai Peninsula.\n\nDespite its initial reluctance, Israel took a chance at peace at the US's persuasion. Anwar Sadat was invited to Israel and he spoke before a session of Israel’s Parliament, the Knesset, in November 1977.\n\nAfter 12 days of negotiations and US President Jimmy Carter serving as a mediator, Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin signed the Camp David Accords on September 17, 1978, in the White House. The Accords ensured that both Egypt and Israel achieved their primary goals -- Egypt regained the Sinai Peninsula and Israel got its first formal recognition from an Arab state.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe same year, Sadat and Begin shared the Nobel Peace Prize. The following year, they signed the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.\n\nANWAR SADAT KILLED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS\n\nHowever, after signing the peace treaty with Israel, then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat faced a huge backlash in the Arab world. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League at the behest of Syria, which was still nursing its wounds from the Yom Kippur War of 1973.\n\nNot only did he face the anger of the Arab nations, but Sadat also became a public enemy of Islamists in Egypt as well.\n\nOn October 6, 1981, Anwar Sadat was reviewing troops on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. Suddenly, a group of officers of the Egyptian army, led by Lieutenant Khaled el Islambouli, approached him with arms. Sadat thought it to be a part of the military parade and stood there to salute them. But the armed men shot him, as Talaat al-Sadat, Anwar Sadat's nephew, told CNN.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnwar Sadat was taken to hospital but died from internal bleeding.\n\nHis killer, Khaled el Islambouli, had connections to the terrorist group Takfir Wal-Hajira, a radical Islamic extremist movement that rejected established governments.\n\nYITZHAK RABIN SIGNS PEACE TREATY AND IS ASSASSINATED\n\nIn January 1993, secret negotiations were initiated by Terje Larsen, a Norwegian sociologist, and Yossi Beilin, a member of Israel's Labor Party government, for a peace treaty between Israel and Palestine. The aim of this treaty was to formalise the two-state formula for the state of Palestine.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) met for peace in Oslo, Norway.\n\nArafat, who once led an armed struggle against Israel through his PLO, had declared the independence of the Palestinian state in 1988. However, with a shift in the political climate of the Middle East after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Arafat found it wise to come to the negotiation table with Israel.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn brief, Arafat had supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which damaged the support for the Palestinian cause in the Arab world. Kuwait was among his major supporters, and by going against it, Arafat had brought scrutiny to his cause.\n\nIn Oslo, Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin agreed that the PLO would recognise Israel and renounce terrorism, while Israel would grant Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza limited self-rule. This agreement was formalised when Rabin and PLO Negotiator Mahmoud Abbas signed a Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, commonly referred to as the \"Oslo Accord\", in the White House on September 13, 1993.\n\nThe Oslo Accords were based on the 1978 Camp David Accords -- signed by Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin -- and were intended to be an interim agreement that allowed for initial steps towards peace. Subsequently, Jordan also normalised ties with Israel in 1994.\n\nYitzhak Rabin was a former soldier who also served as Israel's army chief of staff. In 1994, Rabin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, and Yasser Arafat, after the signing of the Oslo Accords.\n\nBut like in Anwar Sadat's case, the peace treaty signed by Rabin made him subject to anger and ridicule of radical Jewish elements. They saw the Oslo Accords as a \"betrayal\" of Israel and a danger to the country's security.\n\nOn November 4, 1995, a Jewish man shot dead Yitzhak Rabin. His killer was Yigal Amir, a law student at Tel Aviv University. In court, Amir showed no regrets for his actions and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nPEACE TREATIES SIGNED BUT NO PEACE IN SIGHT\n\nAttempts at Israel-Palestine peace have been bloody, claiming the lives of two top leaders, who were also Nobel Peace laureates.\n\nBut their efforts didn't go in vain. The Camp David and Oslo Accords were stepping stones to normalisation of diplomatic ties.\n\nWith the help of the US and the powerful EU bloc, Israel has managed to normalise its ties with most of the Arab nations. In 2020, Israel signed a peace treaty with the UAE, officially referred to as the Abraham Accords. Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco also normalised relations with Israel.\n\nIsrael was on the verge of signing a similar agreement with Saudi Arabia in 2023 when Hamas, a terrorist group controlling the Gaza Strip, launched an offensive in Israel, killing over a thousand of its citizens. The Hamas's attack has jeopardised the Israel-Saudi agreement, with the Arab country suspending talks with the Jewish state till it stopped its retaliatory actions in Gaza."
