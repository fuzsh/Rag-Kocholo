Social\n\nidentity constitutes a conceptual bridge between individuals and\n\ncollective groups (like 􀞆peoples􀞇 or 􀞆minority groups􀞇) or between such\n\ncollective groups. Numerous international legal rules are infused with\n\nsocial identities and international law often institutionalizes collective\n\nidentities. Diverse identities (e.g. regional, ethnic, and historical) often\n\naffect the perception, judgment, and behaviour of international legal\n\nactors. The chapter exposes the key elements of social identity and\n\nbriefly discusses mutual links between international law and social\n\nidentity. It elaborates on the links between the European Union􀞇s\n\nidentity and its external trade law aimed at promotion of compliance\n\nwith international human rights law. The potential of social identity\n\nliterature as an instrument to interpret certain international legal\n\nprovisions is illustrated with regard to the definition of 􀞆minority\n\ngroups􀞇 as well as to rules concerning dis􀁔ualification of adjudicators.\n\nKeywords:􀀂􀁢􀀂social identity,􀀂sociology,􀀂international law,􀀂inter-group relations,􀀂European\n\nUnion,􀀂Human rights,􀀂regional identity,􀀂minority groups,􀀂social constructivism,􀀂international\n\ntrade law\n\nUniversity Press Scholarship Online\n\nOxford Scholarship Online\n\n/via4i0. %\n\nTHE SOCIOLOGY OF\n\nINTERNATIONAL LAW\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃2􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nWho I am is closely interwoven with ideas about the society in\n\nwhich I live and the views of others who also inhabit that same\n\nsocial context 􀞔 Identity involves personal investment, often on a\n\nmassive scale, to the extent that people are willing to die to claim\n\nor protect their own identities, but it is always socially located.\n\nKath Woodward,􀀂Understanding Identity1\n\nI.􀀂Introduction􀀂91\n\nII.􀀂Social Identity􀀂93\n\na.􀀂Key issues in social identity􀀂93\n\nb.􀀂The construction of social identity􀀂95\n\nc.􀀂The consequences of social identity􀀂98\n\nIII.􀀂Identity in International Relations􀀂102\n\nIV.􀀂Social Identity and International Law􀀂104\n\na.􀀂Identity matters􀀂104\n\nb.􀀂International institutions􀞇 identity and the\n\nenforcement of human rights treaties by EU\n\ntrade measures􀀂106\n\nc.􀀂Social identity as an interpretative tool􀀂116\n\nV.􀀂Concluding Remarks􀀂126\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃3􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nI.􀀂Introduction\n\nInternational law is infused with social identities. States and other\n\ninternational actors operate in multilayer maps, and factors located on\n\ntheir identity maps often motivate and constrain their activities in the\n\ninternational legal􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.92)􀀂 system. Collective entities (such as states\n\nand international institutions) hold multiple identities; some are\n\ninstitutionalized in various legal rules, while others are semiinstitutionalized\n\nin diverse soft laws or informal international groups.\n\nThese identities often affect the perception, judgment, and behaviour of\n\ninternational actors, including their positions and the behaviour they\n\nundertake regarding international legal rules. Thus, for example,\n\nnational identities influence states􀞇 decisions to develop or employ\n\ncertain weapons of mass destruction, and international institutions􀞇\n\nidentities motivate certain international actors to promote compliance\n\nwith international human rights treaties. Economic and political\n\ndimensions of international law are often overlain with a social identity\n\ndimension. While, in reality, these dimensions are inseparable, this\n\nchapter is devoted to a social identity analysis of international law.\n\nIdentity is a central concept in the sociology􀞇s established conceptual\n\ntoolbox.2􀀂The term 􀞆identity􀞇 has become central to many fields of\n\nsociology and social science over recent years.3􀀂Identity matters in our\n\ndaily life and affects people􀞇s perceptions and attitudes towards other\n\npeople, as well as their own behaviour. As 􀀭enkins explains: 􀞆one of the\n\nfirst things that we do on meeting a stranger is attempt to identify\n\nthem, to locate them on our 􀞊mindscapes􀞋􀝷􀞇.4􀀂Prominent identities\n\ninclude ethnicity, nationality, geographical location, gender, religion,\n\noccupation, and historical roots.\n\nSection􀀂II􀀂exposes the basic tenets of social identity and Section􀀂III\n\nbriefly examines the role of identity in international relations literature\n\n(according to the constructivist approach). Section􀀂IV(a)􀀂discusses\n\ncertain links between international law and social identity (including\n\nrules regarding the use and production of weapons of mass destruction\n\n(WMD)). Section􀀂IV(b)􀀂analyses the links between the European Union􀞇s\n\n(EU) identity and its external trade policy aimed at the promotion of\n\ncompliance with international human rights law. Section􀀂IV(c)􀀂explores\n\nthe employment of social identity tools as a complementary\n\ninterpretative instrument to clarify the content of certain international\n\nlegal provisions (such as those relating to minority groups and\n\ndisqualification of adjudicators). Section􀀂V􀀂provides a summary of our\n\nconclusions and suggests some topics for future research.􀀂(p.93)\n\nII.􀀂Social Identity\n\na.􀀂Key issues in social identity\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃4􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nSocial identity5􀀂has been explored in the sociological literature and in\n\nthe social psychological literature.6􀀂Though the two perspectives on\n\nidentity present some differences regarding their origin, orientation,\n\nand language,7􀀂there are also substantial similarities and overlap.

Sociological literature inclines to underline the dynamic\n\nand interpretative aspects of identity, and particularly its link to the\n\n􀞆social role􀞇,20􀀂underscoring that having a particular identity often\n\npressures individuals to behave according to social expectations related\n\nto the particular role (such as 􀞆parent􀞇 or 􀞆teacher􀞇).21􀀂Where people\n\nidentify with a group or social role, they tend to adopt the meaning that\n\naccompanies the􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.95)􀀂 particular identity, and act accordingly to\n\nrepresent that meaning.22􀀂In this sense, identity is the set of meanings\n\nthat are tied to the self, and those meanings often operate across\n\nvarious social roles and situations.23\n\nSocial groups, like individuals, strive to establish their identity and this\n\ngroup identity often outlives its members.24􀀂Groups interact with other\n\ngroups and their individual members to construct a group identity. This\n\ncollective identity has two dimensions: the identity of the particular\n\ngroup vis-􀂢-vis its members, and the group􀞇s identity as it relates to\n\nother groups.25􀀂Groups and individuals identified with the group\n\nmaintain reciprocal relationships; individuals affect the development of\n\nthe group identity, and the group guides the actions of its members.26\n\nGroups strive to establish an independent identity from other groups,\n\nand also struggle with group members to maintain the group􀞇s identity\n\nequal to, if not more important than, the individual members􀞇 identity.27\n\nb.􀀂The construction of social identity\n\nSocial identity is formed in a dialectic process between internal and\n\nexternal categorizations. Human beings have the propensity to\n\ncategorize individuals into groups,28􀀂and social categorizations􀞂both\n\ninternal and external􀞂are cognitive tools that segment, classify, and\n\norder the social environment. These categorizations do not merely\n\norganize the social world, they also provide a system of orientation for\n\nself-reference: they define the individual􀞇s place in society.29􀀂Individuals\n\ndefine themselves as belonging to some social groups, and certain\n\naspects of their self-image are derived from the social categories to\n\nwhich they perceive themselves as belonging. Individuals selfcategorize\n\nthemselves differently according to the contexts in which\n\nthey find themselves and the contingencies with which they are\n\nfaced.30􀀂Thus, individuals always act in the context of a complex social\n\nstructure out of which multiple identities emerge.31􀀂(p.96)\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃6􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nSocial categorization:\n\nThe identity formation process begins with categorization undertaken\n\nby an external collective group or categorization that is done internally\n\nby the individual.32􀀂In both cases, identity emerges (and is maintained)\n\nwithin a two-way relationship between self-categorization and collective\n\ncategorization. Thus, individuals present themselves in a particular way\n\nand that presentation is accepted or contested by significant others,\n\nand others􀞇 responses feed back to the presenter. Similarly, individuals\n\nmay internalize collective identity into their self-identity and that\n\ninternalization is likely to modify the way they present themselves to\n\nothers.33􀀂Consequently, some scholars view the identity construction\n\nprocess as 􀞆negotiations􀞇 between individuals and the collective.34\n\nInternal or external aspects of identity may be dominant at different\n\nstages of identity formation and often interact simultaneously.35\n\nBoundaries:\n\nAs discussed above, identity consists of two core elements of similarity\n\nand difference. Some scholars emphasize the role of highlighting the\n\ndifferences (􀞆boundaries􀞇) between social groups in the process of\n\nconstructing and maintaining􀀂collective identity.36􀀂Barth explains (in\n\nthe context of ethnic groups) that 􀞆groups only persist as significant\n\nunits if they imply marked difference in behaviour, i.e., persisting\n\ncultural differences.􀞇37􀀂From this perspective, group identification is\n\nconstructed 􀞆across the group boundary􀞇;38􀀂highlighting difference visà-\n\nvis other groups generates internal similarity among the group\n\nmembers.39\n\nSymbols and rituals􀀂are often part of the formation and maintenance of\n\ngroup identity.40􀀂Symbols and community rituals often generate or\n\nreinforce a sense of shared belonging.41􀀂These symbols spawn an image\n\nof group homogeneity and often mask diversity among members of the\n\nidentity group. Thus, symbols allow individual diversity and collective\n\nsimilarity to co-exist within social groups.42􀀂􀀂(p.97)\n\nLanguage􀀂(including dialect) and the construction of social identity are\n\ninextricably linked.43􀀂Language indicates how societies classify their\n\nenvironment (both physical and social) and each social group has its\n\nown distinctive system of classification, which, in part, maintains\n\nboundaries between insiders and outsiders.44􀀂Thus, 􀞆􀀾t􀁀o choose one\n\nlanguage over another provides an immediate and universally\n\nrecognized badge of identity􀞇.45􀀂Language often reflects distinctive\n\nregional, ethnic, religious, or historical backgrounds. Ethnic groups\n\nmay utilize language as a symbolic means of fostering or developing\n\nidentity, or as a means of defence against encroachment by outsiders.46\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃7􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nCollective narratives and memories􀀂often contribute to the emergence\n\nand maintenance of social identities.47􀀂Collective narratives place an\n\nidentity group within a historically constituted world, and they render\n\nthe world intelligible and coherent to their members.48􀀂Such stories49\n\n􀞆constitute narrative bonds􀞇 that frequently delineate the social groups􀞇\n\nboundaries.50􀀂Collective memories51􀀂occasionally produce a\n\ncommemorative narrative about a particular past.52􀀂Such social\n\nmemories often suggest a moral message and provide some normative\n\nguidelines regarding the appropriate behaviour.53􀀂Collective memories\n\npreserve the store of knowledge from which the group derives\n\nawareness of its unity and peculiarity.54\n\nInstitutions􀀂often reflect and reinforce identities.55􀀂Most collective\n\nidentities are institutionalized to a certain degree, and the prominent\n\nexamples are ethnic56􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.98)􀀂 or gender identities.57􀀂Organizations58\n\n(such as nation states) are occasionally involved in shaping social\n\nidentities,59􀀂and particularly in collective identification.

Even in the absence of\n\nmultiple identities, a similar question arises regarding the factors\n\naffecting the likelihood of activating􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.99)􀀂 a single identity. 􀞆Identity\n\nsalience􀞇 refers to the probability that an identity will be invoked and\n\nform the basis for action in diverse situations.70􀀂Identity salience\n\nincludes quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative\n\nelement relates to the number of people or groups to whom a person or\n\ngroup is tied through identity. Generally, the more people or groups are\n\ntied to a particular identity, the more likely it is that a specific identity\n\nwill be activated. The qualitative aspect relates to the relative strength\n\nof identity ties with other people or groups which are associated with\n\nthe particular identity. Generally, stronger identity ties are more likely\n\nto lead to a more salient identity.71\n\nDepersonalization:\n\nOnce an identity is activated, the core process underlying many\n\nconsequences relates to depersonalization (i.e., viewing people as a\n\nfunction of their respective group membership, rather than in terms of\n\ntheir individual characteristics or interpersonal relationships).72\n\nDepersonalization effectively brings self-perception and behaviour into\n\nline with the relevant in-group prototype, thus transforming the self\n\nfrom being a unique individual into a member of the group73􀀂and\n\ntransforming individuality into group behaviour.74􀀂Once identity is\n\nactivated, the main impact relates to people􀞇s perception (including\n\nself-perception), evaluations (including self-evaluation), and behaviour\n\ntowards other people.75\n\nPerception:\n\nAt the cognitive level, the activation of social identity leads individuals\n\nidentified with a group to accentuate perceived similarities between the\n\nself and other in-group members, and people tend to perceive􀀂\n\nthemselves􀀂as more similar to other group members.76􀀂Individuals also\n\ntend to emphasize perceived similarities among the group members77\n\nand this stereotyped perception enhances the sense of group\n\nhomogeneity.78􀀂On the other side of the identity boundary,􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.100)􀀂\n\nidentification with a group tends to sharpen the perceived differences\n\nbetween group members and out-group members;79􀀂out-group\n\nmembers are more likely to be perceived as undifferentiated.80\n\nEvaluation:\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃9􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nIdentification with a group tends to enhance self-evaluation which\n\nconstitutes a motivation for social identification.81􀀂The enhanced selfworth\n\nthat accompanies group identity does not regularly accompany\n\nunilateral identification with a group but it rather derives from the\n\ngroup􀞇s acceptance of the individual as a member.82􀀂People identified\n\nwith a particular group tend to evaluate members of the group\n\npositively83􀀂and to evaluate people belonging to other groups negatively\n\n(the latter attitude tends to further enhance their own self-esteem as\n\ngroup members).84􀀂Perceived similarity within the group tends to\n\npromote greater liking, trust, and solidarity with in-group members.85\n\nGroup identity is often accompanied by stereotyping, (i.e., attributing\n\nspecific personal traits to people based on their membership in a social\n\ngroup).86\n\nBehaviour:\n\nIdentification with a group demands some loyalty and behavioural\n\nconformity, and group members orient their behaviour towards other\n\nmembers.87􀀂From a social psychological perspective, conformist\n\nbehaviour is a natural corollary of the group members􀞇 similar\n\nperceptions.88􀀂As discussed above, the sociological analysis of identity\n\nemphasizes the important function of 􀞆social role􀞇,89􀀂and 􀞆enacting􀞇 the\n\nrole according to the group􀞇s expectations is likely to enhance selfesteem.\n\nA perception of poor role performance may engender doubts\n\nabout self-worth, and produce symptoms of distress.90􀀂􀀂(p.101)\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the most undesirable impacts of social\n\nidentity relate to behaviour towards non-members.

Constructivists argue that identity\n\nformation occurs before, or at least concurrently with, interest\n\nformation.111􀀂Collective identity strongly implies a particular set of\n\ninterests. Hopf presents the example􀀂of the identity of a 􀞆great power􀞇\n\nwhich implies specific interests differing from those implied by the\n\nidentity of a 􀞆􀀨uropean Union member􀞇􀀑112􀀂From this perspective,\n\ninterests are dependent on identities,113􀀂and Wendt states: 􀞆􀀾h􀁀ow a\n\nstate satisfies its corporate interests depends on how it defines the self\n\nin relation to the other, which is a function of social identities at both\n\ndomestic and systemic levels of analysis.􀞇114􀀂Consequently, changes in\n\nstate identity also affect national security interests and policies of\n\nstates,115􀀂and call for taking particular actions.116\n\nNorms either affect the formation of identities in the first place\n\n(generating expectations of new particular identities in a given context)\n\nor prescribe behaviours for already constituted identities (generating\n\nexpectations about how a particular identity will influence behaviour in\n\nvarying circumstances).117􀀂The link between norms and identity is\n\nparticularly strong with regard to 􀞆constitutive norms􀞇 that define group\n\nmembership.118􀀂The above links between identity and norms indicate\n\nthat identities and the norms associated with them ensure a􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.104)􀀂\n\nminimal level of predictability. Thus, durable expectations between\n\ninternational actors require inter-subjective identities that are\n\nsufficiently stable to ensure a predictable pattern of behaviour in the\n\ninternational system.119\n\nSocial identity analysis of international law is often associated with the\n\nconstructivist approach in international relations literature. As\n\nelaborated below, collective identity often facilitates, motivates, and\n\nconstrains activities of collective actors in the international legal\n\nsystem.\n\nIV.􀀂Social Identity and International Law\n\na.􀀂Identity matters\n\nNumerous international legal rules and concepts are infused with social\n\nidentity. International law often institutionalizes (to various degrees)\n\nidentities that are encoded into diverse international instruments.

Thus, a state may be identified with its role as a\n\n􀞆leader􀞇 in a particular sector of international law while not purporting\n\nto lead in other spheres.

The impact of national\n\nidentity is notable on the employment of chemical weapons. Price and\n\nTannenwald emphasize the link between the legal prohibition against\n\nusing chemical weapons and the identity of a 􀞆civilized nation􀞇. Their\n\nstudy reveals that the origins of the chemical weapons 􀞆taboo􀞇 were\n\nimplicated in exclusionary practices that distinguished between\n\ncivilized and uncivilized areas of the globe.128􀀂The breaches of this\n\nlegal prohibition and their justification (e.g., by Italy against Ethiopia in\n\n1935􀞁6,129􀀂and by Iraq in 1998) reflect the understanding that modern\n\nwarfare between industrialized states is qualitatively different from war\n\ninvolving an 􀞆uncivilized nation􀞇.130􀀂They explain that 􀞆[t]he symbolic\n\nconnection of CW [chemical weapons] with standards of civilized\n\nconduct has made it more difficult for advanced nations to employ\n\nthese weapons against each other􀞇.131􀀂Thus, compliance with the legal\n\nprohibition to employ chemical weapons is occasionally tied to the\n\nidentity of 􀞆civilized nation􀞇.􀀂􀀂(p.106)\n\nCollective identities are occasionally involved in the production of\n\nnuclear weapons. In a well-known article published in􀀂International\n\nSecurity, Sagan presents three states􀞇 motivations for developing\n\nnuclear weapons: increasing national security against foreign threats;\n\nadvancing domestic and bureaucratic interests; and providing an\n\nimportant normative symbol of a state􀞇s modernity and identity.132\n\nRegarding the link between this powerful weapon and national\n\nidentity,133􀀂Sagan presents some nuclear decisions as serving important\n\nsymbolic functions􀞂shaping and reflecting a state􀞇s identity.134􀀂The\n\nsignificant link between decisions to build nuclear weapons and\n\nnational identity135􀀂was evident, for example,136􀀂in France􀞇s\n\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in the 1950s137􀀂and its reluctance to\n\nstop nuclear testing in the mid-1990s.138􀀂The influence of national\n\nidentity on nuclear weapon􀞇s policy is explicit in Japan􀞇s policy after\n\nWorld War II. As Mochizuki explains, Japan􀞇s decision not to build\n\nnuclear weapons relates not only to 􀞆pragmatic pacifism􀞇 but also to the\n\ncentral motive relating to its national identity as a 􀞆peace state􀞇.139\n\nThe following sections elaborate on the impact of the EU􀞇s collective\n\nidentity on promoting the enforcement of human rights treaties, as well\n\nas the employment of theoretical tools and empirical evidence drawn\n\nfrom social identity literature as an interpretative instrument to clarify\n\nthe content of certain international legal rules.\n\nb.􀀂International institutions􀞇 identity and the enforcement of human rights\n\ntreaties by EU trade measures\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃14􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nInternational institutions􀞇 identity:\n\nThe formation and activities of international institutions often reflect\n\ncollective identities. Membership in these organizations often\n\nrepresents various identity ties, such as regional (e.g., Organization for\n\nAmerican States that also represent certain ideological traits);140\n\nreligious (e.g.,􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.107)􀀂 Organization for the Islamic Conference);141\n\nhistorical (e.g., the Commonwealth of Nations);142􀀂or ideological (e.g.,\n\nNATO).143\n\nThe identity of an international institution144􀀂regularly co-exists with\n\n(and is often related to) its members􀞇 national identities, as well as with\n\nthe identities of other international institutions with whom it is\n\naffiliated. The latter identity link is prominent concerning the ties\n\nbetween Islamic Conference, the Arab League, and the African\n\nUnion,145􀀂or between the EU and the Council of Europe.146\n\nLike other identity groups, international institutions often construct\n\ncommon symbols, including flags, anthems, a special memorial day (e.g.\n\nto celebrate the establishment of the organization),147􀀂and,\n\noccasionally, collective narratives as well.148􀀂The identities of\n\ninternational organizations may be discerned from their constituent\n\ndocuments,149􀀂and particularly provisions regarding the admission of\n\nnew members150􀀂and exclusion/suspension of existing members151\n\nwhich highlight the 􀞆boundaries􀞇 between them and other international\n\ngroups.152􀀂(p.108)\n\nSimilarly, the practice of international institutions in other spheres\n\n(such as sanctions imposed on non-members or decisions adopted by\n\ntheir judicial organs), also contribute to the formation or change of\n\ntheir identity.

The EU often\n\npresents itself as a human rights promoter in the international\n\narena.181􀀂This external feature of the EU􀞇s identity arises, for example,\n\nfrom Articles 3(5)182􀀂and 21(1)183􀀂of the TEU,184􀀂as well as diverse\n\npublic documents of the EU bodies. Thus, for instance,185􀀂the EU\n\nCouncil stated in a 􀞆strategic􀞇 document (2012):\n\nThe European Union is founded on a shared determination to\n\npromote peace and stability and􀀂to build a world founded on\n\nrespect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law.􀀂These\n\nprinciples underpin all aspects of the internal and external\n\npolicies of the European Union􀀂􀞔 The EU will continue to throw\n\nits full weight behind advocates of liberty, democracy and human\n\nrights the world􀞔.􀀂The EU will speak out against any attempt to\n\nundermine respect for universality of human rights.186\n\n􀀂(p.112)\n\nAs noted previously, social identity consists of two core elements of\n\nsimilarity (mainly on the internal level, among the group􀞇s members)\n\nand difference (mainly on the external level, vis-à-vis non-members).\n\nGroups need a certain level of both similarity and differentiation from\n\nothers, and social identity derives from the tension between the sense\n\nof belonging and the sense of distinctiveness.187􀀂An analysis of the\n\ncurrent EU constitutional framework for human rights protection\n\nreveals rather a clear difference between the importance accorded to\n\nhuman rights in EU external relations as compared to internal\n\nrelations.188􀀂The existing constitutional framework (with the exception\n\nof anti-discrimination law) assigns a more circumscribed role to human\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃17􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\nrights within the context of internally focused EU policies, and the\n\ndominant focus is external, empowering, and even obliging the EU to\n\npromote human rights actively in its international policies.189\n\nThis EU bifurcated approach may be explained by some sociological\n\nliterature which emphasizes the role of highlighting social differences\n\nbetween the particular social group and other groups in the process of\n\nconstructing and maintaining collective identity. Emphasizing\n\ndifferences vis-à-vis other groups tends to foster internal similarity\n\namong group members.190􀀂The EU􀞇s emphasis on external human\n\nrights policies underlines its identity as a liberal-democratic group191\n\ntowards other international groups.\n\n􀀷he EU􀞇s social role as human rights promoter and e􀁛ternal trade\n\ninstruments:\n\nSociological literature underlines the link between social identity and\n\nsocial role, underscoring that having a particular identity often\n\npressures individuals and groups to behave according to social\n\nexpectations related to their particular role.

Such expectations create\n\nsocial pressure on the EU and affect its behaviour in the international\n\nsystem.\n\nThe EU􀞇s identity as human rights promoter is projected out through a\n\nvariety of frameworks,196􀀂and this section focuses on trade measures.\n\nThe two principal trade instruments in this sphere are conditioned\n\npreferences for developing countries and human rights clauses in trade\n\nagreements with non-members.

The EU􀞇s identity, however, does\n\nnot ensure that all members will comply with its human rights norms.\n\nGenerally, a member whose bond with the group is weak (or socially\n\nalienated from the group) is less likely to be committed to the group􀞇s\n\nnorms.211􀀂From this perspective, if an EU member is significantly􀀂􀀂􀀂(p.\n\nSocial Identity, International Groups, and International Law\n\n􀀳􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃19􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃62\n\n􀀳􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀷􀀨􀀧􀀃􀀩􀀵􀀲􀀰􀀃􀀲􀀻􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀧􀀃􀀶􀀦􀀫􀀲􀀯􀀤􀀵􀀶􀀫􀀬􀀳􀀃􀀲􀀱􀀯􀀬􀀱􀀨􀀃􀀋􀁚􀁚􀁚􀀑􀁒􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀁖􀁆􀁋􀁒􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓􀀑􀁆􀁒􀁐􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀋􀁆􀀌􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁓􀁜􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀀳􀁕􀁈􀁖􀁖􀀏􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛􀀑􀀃􀀤􀁏􀁏􀀃\n\n􀀵􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗􀁖􀀃􀀵􀁈􀁖􀁈􀁕􀁙􀁈􀁇􀀑􀀃􀀸􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁗􀁈􀁕􀁐􀁖􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁗􀁋􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀏􀀃􀁄􀁑􀀃􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁐􀁄􀁜􀀃􀁓􀁕􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀃􀁒􀁘􀁗􀀃􀁄􀀃􀀳􀀧􀀩􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁈􀀃􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁓􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀁄􀀃\n\n􀁐􀁒􀁑􀁒􀁊􀁕􀁄􀁓􀁋􀀃􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀲􀀶􀀲􀀃􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁒􀁑􀁄􀁏􀀃􀁘􀁖􀁈􀀃􀀋􀁉􀁒􀁕􀀃􀁇􀁈􀁗􀁄􀁌􀁏􀁖􀀃􀁖􀁈􀁈􀀃http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/page/privacy-policy􀀌􀀑􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁅􀁖􀁆􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁈􀁕􀀝􀀃\n\n􀀸􀁑􀁌􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀃􀁒􀁉􀀃􀀲􀁛􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁇􀀞􀀃􀁇􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀝􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁜􀀃􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀛\n\n115)􀀂􀀂 less identified with the group or perceives itself as socially\n\nmarginalized in the European Community, it is more likely to breach the\n\ngroup􀞇s norms, including those relating to human rights.\n\nAs already noted, certain international institutions possess the capacity\n\nto authoritatively identify people or groups as belonging to a certain\n\ncategory and thus may stigmatize their incumbents.

As elaborated below,\n\nsome external acceptance of the particular group by the international\n\ncommunity is needed for the group􀞇s legal protection.\n\nThe relative weight assigned to the respective elements of self-identity\n\nand external acceptance should vary according to the aim of the\n\nparticular legal regime. Where the specific legal instrument aims at􀀂\n\ngranting certain benefits􀀂to the members of a group (e.g., rights\n\nconcerning ancestral lands),279􀀂both elements should be carefully\n\nexamined. From this perspective, Article 1(2) of the Convention on\n\nIndigenous Peoples which provides that self-identification is the\n\n􀞆fundamental criterion􀞇280􀀂should not be interpreted as determining\n\nthat the internal element is the crucial element in the concept of social\n\nidentity. On the other hand, it should be noteworthy that the needed\n\n􀞆external􀞇 recognition does not imply that recognition by the particular\n\nparty which is bound to respect the group􀞇s rights (and often to assume\n\nthe corresponding burden) is a prerequisite for legal recognition of the\n\nsocial group.281􀀂In such cases, recognition by groups of states,\n\ninternational institutions, or international tribunals may fulfil the\n\nelement of external recognition.\n\nWhere the specific legal regime is􀀂designed to protect a group􀞇s\n\nmembers􀀂from discrimination or persecution, identification of the\n\npersecuted persons is often undertaken by members of the persecuting\n\ngroup (even where the persecuted individuals do not identify with the\n\npersecuted group). In such cases, it is suggested that both internal and\n\nexternal recognition be examined; but the centre of gravity should\n\ncertainly be shifted to external identification by the persecuting group.\n\nThe absence of self-identification by the persecuted individuals should\n\nnot bar their protection under the relevant international instrument.\n\nIn addition to the elements of the 􀞆social group􀞇, it is desirable that\n\nlegal decision-makers take into account additional elements of social\n\nidentity. Since the closely connected concepts of 􀞆social group􀞇 and\n\n􀞆social identity􀞇 are elusive, it is neither desirable nor possible to define\n\nthem in a precise and rigid fashion. Consequently, it is suggested to\n\ninterpret these concepts in a flexible manner. It is desirable that legal\n\ndecision-makers who are called upon to apply this concept broaden\n\ntheir scope of examination and examine evidence regarding additional\n\nfactors discussed above, including symbols and rituals, language\n\n(including dialect), and collective narratives.

The common features that mark the\n\nboundaries of a particular group are widely labelled 􀞆the objective\n\nelement􀞇 in legal literature, mainly in contrast to the 􀞆subjective\n\nelement􀞇 of group identity (or 􀞆group consciousness􀞇). From a\n\nsociological perspective, these common features are not necessarily\n\nstrictly objective, and often present significant subjective aspects.\n\nSome of the common features, like religious or other beliefs, are not\n\nalways objectively discerned by members of other groups. Still, these\n\nfeatures are very 􀞆real􀞇 for the members of the particular group. As\n\nJenkins states: 􀞆[g]roups may be imagined, but this does not mean that\n\nthey are imaginary. They are experientially real in everyday life.􀞇283\n\nConsequently, an examination of the 􀞆objective􀞇 elements of a social\n\ngroup may require evidence as to the inter-subjective meanings shared\n\nby the members of the particular group􀞇s members.\n\nV.􀀂Concluding Remarks\n\nStates and other international actors operate in complex identity\n\nnetworks that often affect their positions and activities in the\n\ninternational legal system. International legal rules and social identities\n\ninteract in various manners, and diverse international identities (e.g.,\n\nlocal, ethnic, and historical) are occasionally encoded into international\n\nlegal rules. Social identity constitutes a conceptual bridge between\n\nindividuals and collective groups (like 􀞆peoples􀞇 or 􀞆minority groups􀞇) or\n\nbetween collective groups (such as states or international institutions).\n\nConsequently, the impact of social identities on international law is\n\nparticularly noticeable regarding legal rules regulating various links\n\nbetween individuals and social groups (e.g., affiliation with in a\n\nminority group), ties between states and a variety of international\n\ngroups, and links between international groups (e.g., among regional\n\ngroups). From this perspective, parallel to the central notion of 􀞆intergroup\n\nrelations􀞇 in social identity literature, it is possible to explore\n\nnumerous international law rules as regulating diverse aspects of\n\n􀞆inter-national-group relations􀞇.\n\nAs discussed above, international institutions often present significant\n\naspects of identity groups (such as symbols, rituals, and collective\n\nnarratives). International organizations􀞇 rules regarding accession of\n\nnew members and suspension of existing ones often reflect the social\n\nboundaries that distinguish between the relevant international identity\n\ngroup and other international groups.

The interpretative contribution\n\nof tools and empirical knowledge drawn from social identity studies has\n\nbeen illustrated here with regard to the concepts of 􀞆social\n\ngroups􀞇 (which underlies diverse collective groups in the international\n\nsystem), 􀞆impartiality􀞇 of adjudicators, and states succession.286􀀂While\n\nsuch an interpretation is expected to improve the quality of\n\ninterpretation of various international legal rules, social identity\n\nanalysis does not imply that additional methods of interpretation\n\n(including the conventional tools of legal interpretation) should not be\n\nconsidered.\n\nThis chapter discusses several prominent examples illustrating the\n\nmutual links between social identity and international law.
