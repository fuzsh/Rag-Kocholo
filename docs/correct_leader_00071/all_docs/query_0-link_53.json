In 1912 it fell before a new party, the New Zealand Political Reform League (usually called the Reform Party), led by a dairy farmer, William Ferguson Massey, who served as prime minister until 1925.

        "text": "Nationalism and war\n\nBy the late 19th century many New Zealanders were coming to regard themselves as a new nation. Most of those of European background had been born in New Zealand and had no memories of or nostalgia for Britain, often called “home.” In the 1890s New Zealand Natives Associations were established by native-born European New Zealanders. Success in sports, especially rugby, spurred national pride. An even greater influence was war. New Zealanders served on the British side during the South African War (1899–1902), during which time they earned a reputation as being superior to the British at fighting a guerrilla war. World War I greatly stimulated national sentiment. During the warfare at Gallipoli, Turkey, and later in France, New Zealanders proved to be excellent soldiers. But while the war boosted nationalist sentiment among both troops and civilians, the price was terrible: nearly one of every three men between the ages of 20 and 40 was killed or wounded. The loss in leadership in the following years was considerable.\n\nAt home the war brought prosperity, as export markets were assured and prices good. Domestic unity was only slightly shaken by the antiwar feeling of a faction on the political left. Massey remained prime minister, but, in the wartime coalition government (1915–19), Ward and the Liberals carried great weight. The Reform Party stayed in office until 1928, led after Massey’s death in 1925 by Joseph Gordon Coates. The party survived the first postwar economic depression but not that of the mid-1920s. Led by Ward, the Liberals, under the new name of the United Party, were victorious in 1928; they thus had to face the deepening depression of 1929–30. After Ward’s death (1930) and at the height of the depression, Reform and United formed a new coalition (1931) under the premiership of George Forbes, which lasted until the election of 1935 brought in a Labour government.\n\nSome postwar developments were of great importance. In external affairs Massey led a delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and signed the Treaty of Versailles and so committed New Zealand to membership in the League of Nations. New Zealand thus began to acquire the status of a sovereign state, though Massey denied this consequence. The Liberals, especially Seddon, had already taken steps toward autonomy within the empire. At the series of colonial and imperial conferences from 1887 onward, New Zealand had followed Canada and Australia in asserting its right to a voice in certain foreign policy issues. Seddon argued vehemently against British reluctance to acquire more Pacific islands while permitting German influence to grow in Samoa.\n\nNew Zealand legislation to restrict Asian immigration was sharply and obstinately at variance with British policy. Western Samoa (now Samoa), which New Zealand had captured from the Germans in 1914 and over which it was granted a mandate in 1920, also provided occasions for British and New Zealand differences.\n\nReform leaders professed little love for the principle of Commonwealth autonomy. New Zealand took a passive part in the conferences leading to the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and did not adopt it until 1947. But the substance of autonomy had been enjoyed before.\n\nThe major domestic achievement of the Reform administration was a system of export-marketing agencies in which authority was shared by producer and state. That system laid the foundations of a collectivist marketing structure. J.G. Coates was the most energetic minister in Forbes’s coalition government. His attempts to counter depression concentrated on the farmer in order to revive the country. To increase export receipts, he devalued the New Zealand pound. He also protected farmers against foreclosure and set up a credit agency.\n\nWhen overseas prices began to recover in 1934, the country was financially strong, but little had been done for the unemployed. Conditions in towns and relief camps led to rioting, violence, and widespread discontent, all of which were favourable to the Labour Party. The Labour Party had been formed by socialist and radical groups in 1916. During the 1920s it was predominant only in working-class electorates. In its quest for votes, however, Labour increasingly abandoned its socialist theories and adopted welfare and credit-reform proposals, which had wider appeal. In the election of 1935 Labour won a considerable victory; successful in the towns, the party also won in many rural areas. Prices for dairy exports were slowest to recover, and many dairy farmers were drawn by Labour promises of a guaranteed price. The victory was particularly notable in terms of seats, for a right-wing third party (the Democrat Party) split the conservative vote to Labour’s advantage. The National Party, successor to the coalition, was rendered temporarily ineffective.\n\nThe new ministers, among whom the most notable were Peter Fraser and Walter Nash, showed great energy. Led by Michael Joseph Savage, they had the good fortune to govern a country to which prosperity was returning. The farmer enjoyed increased earnings; the worker, increased wages and shorter hours. Jobs were multiplied by a public works and housing program. The education system was revitalized. In 1938 the Social Security Act provided a state medical service, extended the pension system, and increased benefits. The expansion of secondary industry was accelerated after the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\n\nNew Zealand during World War II and the postwar decades\n\nThe alacrity with which New Zealand went to war in 1939 showed that dominion autonomy had not weakened the country’s ties with Great Britain. At first the war resembled that of 1914; troops were sent to Egypt to train for the European conflict. There they were directly involved by the enemy advance there and saw action in Greece, Crete, North Africa, and Italy. After 1941 New Zealand was directly threatened by Japan, which meant New Zealand had to concentrate forces in the Pacific. Well before the end of the war, the strain upon the country’s manpower, together with the demands of home production, forced a reduction of commitments in the Pacific.\n\nThe Pacific theatre was dominated by the United States, the forces of which provided New Zealand’s sole defense. The fact that disaster was averted by American, not British, forces required a change in New Zealand’s attitudes; security was conferred by a foreign, though friendly, power. External relations in the postwar period reflected that new situation, chiefly through the ANZUS pact (1951), a defensive alliance between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\nAt home the entire economy was mobilized in the war effort and subject to controls. Conscription and direction (directed allocation of the labour force to strategic industries) sent manpower into the military forces and essential occupations. Heavy taxation, war loans, bulk purchase, and controlled marketing kept the economy in a firm grip. They also kept inflation in check; with price control and wage restraint, they amounted to a complete policy of economic stabilization, applied by a Labour government that remained in power until 1949. Savage died early in the war. Fraser, his successor, and Nash were chiefly responsible for the tasks of administration during the war and of reconstruction after peace returned.\n\nSidney Holland led the revival of the National Party, which culminated in victory in 1949. Discontent with controls and with the rising cost of living helped to swing support away from Labour. The National government benefited from its vigorous handling of a serious waterfront dispute in 1951, but in later elections its majority narrowed until Labour returned in 1957. In 1960 the National Party, led by Keith (later Sir Keith) Jacka Holyoake, was returned to power, which it retained until 1972. In that year Labour won a huge victory under Norman Eric Kirk. His death in office in 1974 was the prelude to as great a National victory in 1975, under a new leader, Robert Muldoon.\n\nAfter World War II, New Zealand began to play a relatively independent role in world affairs. That development, in fact, had begun before the war, when the Labour government’s attitude to the League of Nations was coloured by an idealism that clashed with British policy. During the war, Fraser had insisted on an independent voice in the councils of the Allied Powers. At the formation of the United Nations in 1945, he became a notable spokesman for the small powers and made a large impression on the Trusteeship Council. None of those developments weakened New Zealand’s close affinity with Great Britain, its loyalty to the Commonwealth, or its dependence upon the United States.\n\nGeography and insecurity shaped postwar foreign policy. With Australia, New Zealand claimed a voice in settlement in the South Pacific Commission (now the Secretariat of the Pacific Community) and in the transfer of authority in Western Samoa, successfully completed in 1962. New Zealand became deeply involved in Southeast Asia. From 1951 it provided assistance through the Colombo Plan. New Zealanders fought in Malaya (now part of Malaysia), Korea, and Vietnam. Further, New Zealand became a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1954 and supported the United States by sending troops to Vietnam. That reflected fear of the growth of communist power in Asia. The independent spirit of the postwar years was modified to a greater dependence on Western powers during the 1950s and ’60s. In the later 1960s, involvement in the Vietnam War led to a vigorous and continuing public debate on foreign affairs. After Vietnam, debate turned largely on the problem of South African apartheid, especially in the context of sports relations with South Africa and with African countries at Commonwealth and Olympic games.\n\nThe 1970s and ’80s were difficult economically for New Zealand. The combination in the early 1970s of high energy prices and Great Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community (later succeeded by the European Union) brought about a severe economic recession. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and thousands emigrated to Australia. The response of Muldoon’s National government was interventionism on an unparalleled scale: the government borrowed funds from overseas and ran up huge budgetary deficits, in part to finance large industrial developments; in the early 1980s it placed a freeze on wages and prices; and it attempted to regulate interest rates. Dissatisfaction with that program led in 1984 to the election of a Labour government, headed by David Lange.\n\nWilliam Hosking Oliver Keith Sinclair Raewyn Dalziel\n\nA major change during that period was the growing participation of women in the workforce and their assertion of rights in the public arena. In the 1970s and ’80s the women’s movement was well organized, and an increasing number of women entered the mainstream political arena or engaged in feminist politics. By the 1990s women had attained the highest governmental offices.\n\nNew Zealand in the late 20th and early 21st centuries\n\nThe David Lange government and Labour’s changing leadership (1984–90)\n\nThe fourth Labour government initiated one of the most-sweeping policy reversals in the country’s history as, one after another, restrictions on free enterprise that had been imposed progressively over some 50 years were removed. Among the reforms, agricultural subsidies were eliminated, income tax rates reduced, and controls on wages, prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange lifted. The government also took a strong stand against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region, and its decision to ban nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed vessels from New Zealand’s ports strained relations with the United States. Popular support for the Labour program was reflected by the party’s 1987 general election victory.\n\nIn the late 1980s inflation was finally brought under control, but unemployment continued to rise. Prime Minister Lange began to face substantial opposition within his own party, especially as a result of the privatization of state-owned enterprises, which was initiated in 1987, and over his conflict with the finance minister, Roger Douglas. Douglas was pushing for economic measures, such as a flat-scale tax system and deregulation of the labour unions, that the prime minister considered extreme. Lange dismissed Douglas in December 1988, but in August 1989, with the aim of shoring up Labour’s poor standing in the polls, Labour MPs voted to return Douglas to the cabinet. Lange resigned a few days later and was replaced by justice minister Geoffrey (later Sir Geoffrey) Palmer. In just 13 months, however, Palmer was himself replaced by Mike Moore, a former minister of foreign affairs, who held onto the position of prime minister for only eight weeks before the National Party’s landslide victory in the October 1990 general election. James Brendan Bolger, the National leader, became prime minister. The National Party had campaigned for reduced government spending on social programs and the elimination of such labour practices as compulsory unionism but pledged to maintain New Zealand’s antinuclear stand.\n\nThe James Bolger and Jennifer Shipley governments (1990–99)\n\nThe 1993 elections proved to be the closest in some time, with the National Party managing a narrow win over Labour. Though initially facing political uncertainty, Bolger saw his popularity rise with strong economic growth and his condemnation in 1995 of France’s nuclear testing in the South Pacific. In 1996 the country held its first elections under the mixed-member proportional system, which voters had approved by referendum three years earlier. Though no one party managed a majority in the elections, after much negotiation, the National Party formed a coalition government with the small New Zealand First Party. The new administration, however, was plagued by inexperience and factionalism. In addition, inability to allay concerns regarding social welfare issues, particularly the country’s superannuation (retirement savings) scheme, resulted in unrest.\n\nIn November 1997 Bolger resigned, and the National caucus elected Jennifer Shipley as its leader and the country’s first female prime minister. That government, however, also struggled. After Shipley dismissed Winston Peters, of New Zealand First, as deputy prime minister and treasurer in 1998, the coalition between the two parties dissolved. Shipley was left with a minority government; later that year the country suffered a recession. At the 1999 election the National Party was voted out of office. Labour formed a coalition with Alliance (a breakaway group of smaller parties), and Labour leader Helen Clark became the first directly elected woman prime minister.\n\nThe Helen Clark government (1999–2008)\n\nThat Labour government remained in power for three terms, winning elections in 2002 and 2005. It moved away from the economic liberalization policies of the fourth Labour government, modifying employment relations legislation, providing a minimum wage and income support for families, and developing a voluntary savings plan known as Kiwisaver. Its overall policy was to focus on what New Zealand needed to do to compete in an increasingly global economy while protecting its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nThe Labour government returned to a more independent foreign policy, declining to serve in a combat role during the Iraq War and restricting expenditure on the defense forces, at some cost to its close relationship with Australia. The economy expanded under Labour, with low inflation and low unemployment prevailing until 2006, when it started to worsen ahead of the global economic downturn that reached its crisis in 2008.\n\nJohn Key’s first term as prime minister (2008–11)\n\nIn the midst of the economic crisis, the tide began to turn against a government that had been in power for nine years. The National Party, under John Key, returned to power in 2008 on a platform of taxation change and a rolling back of what had come to be called “the nanny state.” Winning the most votes but falling short of an absolute majority, the National Party was able to form a government with the support of three smaller parties, including the Māori Party. The latter had formed in 2004 as a result of the Labour government’s denial of Māori claims to customary rights over areas of the country’s shoreline and seabed.\n\nIn the 1970s and ’80s Māori had become much more active politically and culturally. Māori activism for social and economic rights intensified; demands included the use of the te reo Māori language in education, broadcasting, and official settings and the preservation of Māori arts and culture. Arguing from the rights and obligations of the crown set out in the Treaty of Waitangi, Māori sought the return of land and compensation for the loss of access to natural resources that had occurred since 1840.\n\nIn 1975 the Treaty of Waitangi Act established a tribunal to examine and make recommendations on Māori claims of crown breaches of the treaty principles. A 1985 amendment to the act permitted claims for historical breaches and opened the way for many more claims. The Waitangi Tribunal investigated the claims and made recommendations to the government. Beginning in the early 1990s, the government approved substantial financial, land, and resource compensation for past injustices. Among the more notable awards were a 1998 monetary settlement with the South Island’s Ngāi Tahu tribe that at the time was the largest and oldest land claim in the country’s history, and a 2008 land exchange with a group of seven North Island tribes. The government also apologized for the suffering and injustices inflicted on Māori and made plans to settle all historical grievances within a short period of time.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries the diversity of New Zealand’s population increased greatly. Immigration increased markedly in the early 1990s, with the introduction of a points-based immigration system that rated applicants on a combination of skills, education, age, offers of employment, and qualifications. Under that system many applicants could qualify to gain residency fairly easily. There was a marked shift in the immigrants’ countries of origin, from traditional sources such as Great Britain to Asia, particularly Taiwan, China, and South Korea. Such growing diversity was accompanied by a debate as to whether New Zealand was still a bicultural country or should be more properly seen as a multicultural society.\n\nIn September 2010 a strong earthquake struck Christchurch and its surrounding region; although there were no fatalities, the city suffered extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure. In February 2011 Christchurch was struck by another, far more damaging earthquake, whose epicentre was located just a few miles from the city’s central business district. The quake killed 185 people and devastated the city centre. The rebuilding of the city centre and repairs to damaged housing and roads throughout the city were expected to take several years to complete.\n\nRaewyn Dalziel\n\nJohn Key’s second term as prime minister (2011–16)\n\nKey won a second term as prime minister when the National Party scored a historic victory in the general election in November 2011, capturing some 48 percent of the vote (the largest total for any party since the advent of mixed-member proportional representation in 1996) and 60 seats in the House of Representatives, along with maintaining the support of its junior partners in the ruling majority coalition. Key remained popular with voters and won a third term in the September 2014 election. One of his campaign promises was to hold a national referendum on choosing a new national flag versus retaining the old one. A two-year search for a new design brought more than 10,000 submissions from the public, and five finalists were chosen. Public opinion polls, however, showed that 60 to 70 percent of citizens preferred the existing flag. In the final referendum, held in March 2016, the country’s voters chose to retain the existing flag.\n\nThe Bill English government (2016–17)\n\nIn December 2016 Key surprised New Zealanders by announcing his resignation as party leader and prime minister so that he could spend more time with his family. His preferred successor, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Bill English, who had previously led the National Party in 2001–03, took office on December 12. The National Party then made a strong showing in the general election in September 2017—especially for a government seeking its fourth consecutive term—capturing some 46 percent of the vote and 58 seats in the House of Representatives, the largest total for any party in the election but not enough to form a majority government. With special votes (those by New Zealanders who were overseas or who had registered to vote on polling day) still to be counted, English sought to form a coalition government with the kingmaker populist New Zealand First party (winner of nine seats), as did Jacinda Ardern, the leader of the Labour Party, which tallied about 36 percent of the vote and 45 seats but which also could count on the support of the Green Party (securer of seven seats). Ardern, at age 37, had taken over as Labour leader at the beginning of August 2017, when opinion polling had painted a dire picture of the party’s chances in the upcoming election.\n\nThe Jacinda Ardern government (2017–23)\n\nWhen the special votes were tabulated, both Labour and the Green Party gained one seat each at the expense of the National Party, which fell to a total of 56 seats. In mid-October, after weeks of negotiation, Winston Peters, New Zealand First’s leader, announced that his party would enter a coalition government with Labour, which prepared to rule with “confidence and supply” support from the Green Party. In the process, nearly a decade of National Party rule came to a close, and the charismatic Ardern became New Zealand’s youngest prime minister in some 150 years. In June 2018 Ardern put New Zealand in the international spotlight when she gave birth to her first child, which made her the first leader of a country in nearly three decades to give birth while in office.\n\nNew Zealand was back in the headlines around the world in 2019, this time as a result of deeply disturbing events, when two mosques in Greater Christchurch were attacked on the afternoon of March 15, resulting in the deaths of some 50 people and injuries to about 50 others. Allegedly, shortly before beginning the rampage, the suspect, a 28-year-old Australian national who was a white supremacist, published a 74-page hate-filled anti-immigrant manifesto on social media in which he indicated his intention to attack the mosques. The attack on Al Noor Mosque, in central Christchurch, was streamed live on Facebook by the assailant, apparently using a head-mounted camera, which showed him firing indiscriminately in and around the mosque with semiautomatic assault weapons and shotguns, taking 42 lives. The video feed ended while the gunman was traveling some 3 miles (5 km) to undertake an attack on a mosque in the suburb of Linwood, where he killed eight more individuals. After he was apprehended by police, explosive devices were found attached to several vehicles.\n\nPrior to those attacks, the worst mass shooting in the history of modern New Zealand had occurred in 1990 in the town of Aramoana, where a gunman killed 13 people in an incident prompted by a dispute with a neighbour. Ardern characterized the assaults on the mosques as a “terrorist attack” and said that the event had made for one of the “darkest days” in the country’s history. She then called for New Zealand’s gun laws to be changed, a contentious proposal in a country with an extremely high percentage of gun owners (more than one million guns in a population of some 4.9 million people).\n\nIn December 2019 New Zealand was once again plunged into a state of national mourning when a volcanic explosion on uninhabited White Island (Whakaari) claimed the lives of 22 members of an excursion group made up of adventure tourists and guides. Still reeling as the new year began, the country was then forced to deal with the onset of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that was sweeping the globe. Ardern’s government adopted a “go hard and go early” approach that quickly closed New Zealand’s borders to international travelers and imposed a strict nationwide lockdown. Although these aggressive public health policies dealt a shocking blow to the country’s tourism-dependent economy (GDP fell by more than 12 percent in the June 2020 quarter, the worst quarterly decline in New Zealand economic history), they were extraordinarily effective. New cases of COVID-19 (the disease produced by the virus) disappeared for some 100 days until August, when an outbreak in Auckland led to another national lockdown. By October the virus was again contained. New Zealand had limited the spread of the virus to about 2,000 and the death toll to 25 lives.\n\nIn parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for September but held in October, the Labour Party won a historic landslide victory, capturing some 49 percent of the vote (and 64 seats) to become the first party in 24 years to be able to form a majority government without dependence on a coalition partner. The Green Party, which had been part of Ardern’s ruling coalition, also increased its share of the vote, to 8 percent (up from 6 percent in 2017). Meanwhile, the opposition National Party registered its worst performance at the polls in decades, dropping to 27 percent of the total vote for a loss of 21 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Ardern government was forced to jettison its “zero COVID” policy in response to the challenges of combating the outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant of COVID-19, which spiked in New Zealand in November 2021. The next wave of the virus to hit the islands, the Omicron variant, dwarfed the incidences of the Delta variant when it crested in March 2022. In response to the changing nature of the pandemic, the government shifted the emphasis of its response from lockdowns to vaccination and “living with the virus.” But because of its earlier dependence on lockdowns, New Zealand was slow to roll out its vaccination program, which did not begin until February 2021. Nevertheless, by the end of February 2022, nearly 80 percent of New Zealanders were fully vaccinated, which helped to prepare the country to face the subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks that peaked at midyear 2022 and during the transition to 2023.\n\nHowever, many New Zealanders took issue with the government’s COVID-19 policies, objecting first to the lockdowns and then to vaccines and mandates that required military personnel, police, teachers, doctors, and nurses to be vaccinated. Proof of vaccination was also required for entrance to stores and restaurants. These complaints, combined with growing concern with economic issues such as the rising cost of living and falling housing values, contributed to a significant decline in Ardern’s popularity. For most of 2022 the National Party led Labour in preference polling.\n\nConspiracy theories swirled among those most adamantly opposed to Ardern’s rule, and death threats against her began mounting. In February 2022 a large convoy of trucks and cars descended on the capital to demonstrate against Ardern and her policies, bringing traffic to a standstill and disrupting life in Wellington by following the playbook that hard-line conservatives had used in Canada. Protesters camped outside New Zealand’s parliament for weeks (setting fire to tents and mattresses) before they were forcibly removed by law enforcement officials. In the process, scores of demonstrators were arrested.\n\nAll these developments wore on Ardern. On January 19, 2023, she shocked the country by announcing her intention to resign as prime minister by February 7. “You cannot, and should not” lead a country, she said, “unless you have a full tank.…I know what this job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.”\n\nThe Chris Hipkins government (2023– )\n\nThe Labour Party acted quickly to choose Ardern’s replacement, 44-year-old Chris Hipkins, who had been in charge of implementing the country’s response to the global pandemic, first as the interim health minister and then as COVID-19 response minister. He was sworn in as prime minister on January 25. At the same time, Carmel Sepuloni was sworn in as deputy prime minister. She became the first person of Pacific Island heritage to take that role.\n\nWithin a matter of days, the country was beset with an onslaught of catastrophic weather as heavy rain pelted the North Island. On January 27 alone, Auckland was inundated with 9.8 inches (249 mm) of rain, the equivalent of a typical summer’s worth of precipitation. The rain and flooding continued into February, but the worst was yet to come. In the middle of the month, New Zealand was buffeted by Cyclone Gabrielle. The worst storm to hit New Zealand in a century, it dropped an additional 6–16 inches (150–400 mm) of rain and brought winds that reached high speeds between 80 and 100 miles (about 130 and 160 km) per hour, causing flooding and widespread damage and occasioning the declaration of only the third national emergency in New Zealand history.\n\nAs the year unfolded, New Zealand’s economy also experienced rough going, suffering from the effects of the inflation that gripped much of the world. When New Zealanders voted in the country’s regularly scheduled national election in October, many of them cited the high cost of living and their perception that Labour had failed on its promises as the impetuses for their votes. When the bulk of votes had been counted, Labour claimed only some 27 percent of them (down from about 50 percent in the 2020 election), whereas the National Party took some 39 percent. Although special votes (mostly from New Zealanders abroad), constituting some 20 percent of the total vote, remained to be counted, it was expected that the National Party would secure about 50 seats and that its preferred potential coalition partner, ACT, was on track to take 11 seats, setting the stage for National leader Christopher Luxon, a former business executive, to become the next prime minister. What remained to be seen was whether those seat counts would be changed enough by special votes to necessitate the involvement of New Zealand First in the government, either through inclusion in the ruling coalition or a confidence-and-supply agreement."
