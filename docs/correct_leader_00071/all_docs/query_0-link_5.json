        "text": "Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Holyoake, and our distinguished guests this evening:\n\nAs the Prime Minister was surveying this very elite group this evening, he reminisced about the fact that it was just 1 year ago that he was in this house and in this room, and the host on that occasion was President Johnson.\n\nHe noted one of the guests who is here tonight who was also here 1 year ago. He, of course, raised the question, and I thought of it, too, as to whether or not he was a Democrat or a Republican. I will not reveal who that guest is, but I will only say that in this room, Mr. Prime Minister, are Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThere are people all the way from New York to Hawaii to the State of Alaska, and there are people from all walks of life. And what unites them tonight is the fact that they all are friends of New Zealand, and they are delighted to be here to honor you and Mrs. Holyoake on this occasion.\n\nI want to speak quite personally in that respect about my own debt to your country, and perhaps in speaking that way I can bring to those of our guests who have not been to New Zealand--and many of you have not been there--some of the feeling I have for this country which is so far away geographically, but so close to us in ways that are far more important.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, in World War II, I was stationed on a very barren island at the tip of the Solomons--Green Island. I don't know why they called it Green Island; it had no water. All it had was 25,000 troops there, a Marine combat air transport detachment--I was the Naval Operations Officer with that detachment-and the 25,000 troops were a New Zealand division.\n\nI learned to know New Zealand through New Zealanders and General [Harold Eric] Barrowclough, who was the commander of that division, who later became the Chief Justice of New Zealand. And I, as did many Americans who served with New Zealanders in World War I and II and the later generations in Korea and now in Vietnam--knowing New Zealanders you feel very much at home with them and you realize that we have very much in common.\n\nThen in 1953, in this room, one of the predecessors of the Prime Minister, Prime Minister [Sir Sidney George] Holland, was here as one of the very first state guests of President Eisenhower. After the dinner, Prime Minister Holland suggested to President Eisenhower that the Vice President ought to take a trip. He said he ought to go to New Zealand and Australia and to the other countries of Asia.\n\nPresident Eisenhower, who knew how to take advice, particularly from a distinguished Prime Minister, did take that advice and as a result of what the Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1953 said to the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States and Mrs. Nixon took a 70-day trip to New Zealand and other points in Asia.\n\nIt was then, in 1953, that we really visited New Zealand for the first time. We learned then to know the land as well as the people, the greenest land I have ever seen--I can say that despite my half Irish background because I have never really seen all of Ireland--but this great, green land, with its spectacular beauty, but primarily with the great spirit in its people, a spirit that we know in America from its political leaders, a spirit that we know also from those like Edmund Hillary, who was the first man to climb Mount Everest, a spirit that again transcends differences in population, differences insofar as miles between our two countries are concerned.\n\nWhat I would like really to say to this group tonight is this: The Prime Minister, in our meeting today in which we covered a number of very important issues, and in which we found we looked at the Pacific and Asia through basically the same principles, referred facetiously to the fact that New Zealand was a country of only 3 million, and the United States was one of 200 million, and New Zealand had 3 million people and 100 million sheep.\n\nI can only say in response to that, that those 3 million people in New Zealand are a strong people, and I speak as one who knows them. They are a people who have stood with us and with the allies of freedom in two World Wars, and in Korea and in Vietnam.\n\nThe Prime Minister, a man that I have met briefly before and have learned to know on this trip, represents that country in the councils of the world, speaks for it with a voice that carries far beyond his land because he speaks to principles that transcend the size of a country and that, in effect, reach all the peoples of the world.\n\nBecause his country, as is ours, is deeply dedicated to the principles of independence, to the principles of self-determination, to the principles of freedom which allows us to survive, and his country to survive, and which must survive in other parts of the world if what we believe in is to remain for our children in the years to come.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, it has been a privilege for us to know you and we hope that our guests, after dinner--at least most of them--will have a chance to talk to you again.\n\nI can only say in conclusion that next year, which will be the 200th anniversary of Captain Cook's discovery of New Zealand, will be a great year in the history of your country.\n\nFor those of us who will not be able to attend it, we salute you now. We salute New Zealand. We salute you for your leadership of a great people and in saluting you, we do so by raising our glasses in the traditional toast to Her Majesty the Queen."
