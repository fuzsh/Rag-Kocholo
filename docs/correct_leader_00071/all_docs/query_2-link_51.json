        "text": "Sir Keith Holyoake, New Zealand Prime Minister from 1960 to 1972, famouslyÂ counselled first-term Members of Parliament to âbreathe through their nosesâ,Â suggesting that it was in their best interests to keep their heads down andÂ mouths shut. Perhaps this recommendation is instrumental in the low profile ofÂ first-term MPs in New Zealand and the subsequent dearth of informationÂ available about these individuals.Â Within political science, scholarly attention has tended to focus on the âpowerÂ holdersâ â senior leaders and those perceived to have the most influence. InÂ New Zealand, this has resulted in a growing field of literature about primeÂ ministers, party leaders, and the few parliamentarians who reach cabinet. ThisÂ thesis steps back from power holders to shed light on new MPs.Â It is important to know who new MPs are. Within parliamentary systems MPsÂ often serve long apprenticeships before being promoted to the senior positionsÂ of their party and government. Thus MPs who enter parliament today may holdÂ significant influence in the future. However, very little is known aboutÂ legislators when they enter parliament. Do all Members of Parliament wish toÂ become ministers or prime ministers, or do they have more modest aspirations,Â such as being the best local MP they possibly can? By understanding theÂ motivations of our neophyte politicians we can better understand the types ofÂ people who are likely to become significant political actors in the future.Â This study aims to understand how and why individuals become MPs and howÂ they adapt to the role once they have been elected.Â This thesis uses information gained from two rounds of interviews conductedÂ with first-term Members of Parliament during their first nine months in office.Â Thus this research presents an insight into how MPs view candidate selectionÂ and follows them through their first few months in the job as they reconcileÂ their pre-election expectations with the roles expected of MPs. The result is anÂ account of how individuals become MPs and the roles they develop onceÂ elected."
