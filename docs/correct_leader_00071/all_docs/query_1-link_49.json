        "text": "New PM of New Zealand: Chris Hipkins has been sworn in as the 41st Prime Minister of New Zealand. He is a strong leader in New Zealand politics. He played an important role in health management during the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nChris Hipkins will remain in the post of PM till the month of October this year, after which general elections are proposed in the country. He has become the PM of the country at a time when there are many challenges at the global level. At the same time, there are no fewer challenges for the Labor Party.\n\nThe previous Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern recently announced that she is resigning, and confirmed a national election for October of the year 2023.\n\nArdern stated she “no longer had enough in the tank” to do the job. “It’s time,” she said at the party’s annual caucus meeting on Thursday,\n\n“I’m leaving, because with such a privileged role comes responsibility. The responsibility is to know when you are the right person to lead and also when you are not. I know what this job takes. And I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s that simple,” she said.\n\nIt is confirmed that her term as the prime minister will conclude no later than 7 February, and she will play her role as an MP until the election later this year.\n\nWhat does the Prime Minister of New Zealand do?\n\nThe parliamentary government form of New Zealand on the British model where the head of government is the prime minister.\n\nThe concerned candidate is generally the leader of the governing political party in Parliament and the leader of the cabinet.\n\nthe governor-general appoints the prime minister, but by convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the House of Representatives. The prime minister is always a member of parliament.\n\nWhile previously the titles premier and first minister were used to refer to each of the principal ministers until 1869 when premier became customary.\n\nThe title prime minister was first used formally in the Schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873 in New Zealand. It wasn't used as an official title until Richard John Seddon, in early 1893.\n\nThough some historians consider James FitzGerald as the first Prime Minister, neither he nor his successor was not officially given the title. The first Prime Minister of New Zealand was Henry Swell who served in the year 1856\n\nNine have been known to hold the position for more than one period while Richard Seddon was the Prime Minister for thirteen years between 1893 and 1906, and held the office for the longest term.\n\nEdward Stafford, who assumed office at age 37, was the youngest prime minister and Walter Nash was the oldest who left office at the age of 78.\n\nThere have been three prime ministers who are women, including The incumbent prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who assumed office on 26 October 2017.\n\n— All India Radio
