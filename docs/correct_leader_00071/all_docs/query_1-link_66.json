After spending twelve years as the deputy prime minister of New Zealand, he served as the 28th prime minister from February until December 1972.\n\nQuick Facts 28th Prime Minister of New Zealand, Monarch ...\n\nClose\n\nThe Second National Government, in office since 1960, appeared worn-out and out of touch, and at the time of Marshall's appointment it seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. After Labour's victory in the 1972 general election, Marshall became Leader of the Opposition. He was determined to remain as leader of the National Party, but in July 1974 was challenged for the leadership by Robert Muldoon, his deputy, rival and successor."
