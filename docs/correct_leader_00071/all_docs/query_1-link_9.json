It was elected at the 1963 general election on 30 November of that year.\n\nThe 1963 general election was held on Saturday, 30 November.[1] A total of 80 MPs were elected; 52 represented North Island electorates, 24 represented South Island electorates, and the remaining four represented Māori electorates; this was a gain of one electorate for the North Island from the South Island since the 1960 election. 1,345,836 voters were enrolled and the official turnout at the election was 89.6%.[1]\n\nThe 34th Parliament sat for three sessions, and was prorogued on 21 October 1966.\n\nSession Opened Adjourned first 10 June 1964 4 December 1964 second 27 May 1965 1 November 1965 third 26 May 1966 21 October 1966\n\nThe National Party had come to power at the 1960 election, and Keith Holyoake had formed the second Holyoake Ministry on 12 December 1960, which stayed in power until Holyoake stepped down in early 1972. The second National Government remained in place until its defeat at the 1972 election towards the end of that year.\n\nThe table below shows the number of MPs in each party following the 1963 election and at dissolution:\n\nAffiliation Members At 1963 election At dissolution National Government 45 45 Labour Opposition 35 35 Total\n\n80 80 Working Government majority 10 10\n\nNotes\n\nThe Working Government majority is calculated as all Government MPs less all other parties.\n\nThe table below shows the results of the 1963 general election:\n\nKey\n\nNational Labour Social Credit\n\nElectorate results for the 1963 New Zealand general election Electorate Incumbent Winner Majority Runner up General electorates Ashburton Geoff Gerard 3,419 Albert George Braddick Auckland Central Norman Douglas 3,227 John Strevens Avon John Mathison 5,117 Stan Dodwell Awarua Gordon Grieve 3,373 Noel Valentine Bay of Plenty Percy Allen 3,025 Peter Riden Buller Bill Rowling 1,671 Ernie King Christchurch Central Robert Macfarlane 1,915 Dave Patchett Clutha Peter Gordon 3,595 Les McKay Dunedin Central Phil Connolly Brian MacDonell 1,170 George Robert Thorn Dunedin North Ethel McMillan 2,524 Edgar Whittleston Eden John Rae 3,335 Frank Knipe Egmont William Sheat 3,047 John Seddon Fendalton Harry Lake 2,740 Bruce Barclay Franklin Alfred E.
