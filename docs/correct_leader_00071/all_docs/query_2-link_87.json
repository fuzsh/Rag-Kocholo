        "text": "Since 1977, when Sir Keith Holyoake was appointed Governor-General, New Zealand has had a mixed bag of identities filling the role of the Queen's representative.\n\nNone since has been as controversial as that former politician (the first such appointed to the role) except possibly another with strong political connections, Dame Catherine Tizard.\n\nSir Paul Reeves, a man of the cloth, was our first Maori Governor-General, and Dame Cath our first woman.\n\nSir Michael Hardie-Boys, in some minds, was the \"best\" local Governor-General since the war, filling the role during the introduction of MMP, and was popular, thoughtful and entirely without pretension.\n\nHe was followed by Dame Silvia Cartwright, another former judge, notable in the role for her meticulous constitutional correctness, and the present office-holder, former lawyer Sir Anand Satyanand, another popular, down-to-earth representative.\n\nOur next Governor-General, Jerry Mateparae, like his predecessors, will bring his personality to the job and may well prove to be as popular as the best of them.\n\nHe is not a particularly recognisable figure outside Wellington, since, as head of the Defence Force and before that the army, his entire career has been spent more or less out of the view of the wider public.\n\nHe is also relatively youthful, at 56, to be appointed to a job that will last a minimum of five years (Sir Paul Reeves was 53).\n\nHis age was a significant factor in his appointment, according to the Prime Minister, and may turn out to be beneficial to the institution itself if Lieutenant-general Mateparae can connect with a younger adult age group.\n\nTheir indifference to the office and its constitutional significance is the likeliest cause of the gradual erosion of respect for it, and the slow but steadily increasing acceptance of republicanism.\n\nHis appointment could not be regarded as a surprise, since he was an obvious candidate once he had retired from the army.\n\nLt-gen Mateparae was a particularly suitable appointment to head the defence forces at a time of considerable stress and strain within its constituent elements, caused by a succession of cut-backs, spending scandals, equipment problems, and demands for greater efficiencies.\n\nHe served in that role with distinction.\n\nAs the first Maori leader of the army, he brought mana to the force and added to his own.\n\nHe comes from a modest family background in Wanganui and began his working life as an army private in 1972, and spent in all 38 years in the force.\n\nHe is also a family man, with five children, two of whom will join him and Mrs Mateparae at Government House.\n\nIt is, however, quite inappropriate that Lt-gen Mateparae should continue to occupy until the end of June the office of director of the State's most secret foreign intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau, pending his installation at Government House in August.\n\nThe role of Governor-General is constitutionally neutral; indeed, must be - and must be seen to be - separate from the political thrust and parry of the day.\n\nAs head of the GCSB, Lt-gen Mateparae will have frequent, if not daily, communication with the Prime Minister to whom he is accountable, and with other officials.\n\nIt is all very well for the Prime Minister to excuse himself by stating he took advice from the State Services Commission to see if there was any conflict of interest, and had been assured there was not.\n\nPublic perception, in this instance, is reality.\n\nIt is surprising the Leader of the Opposition, himself a former minister of defence, who was consulted about the appointment weeks ago, has not already spoken out.\n\nThat misjudgment aside, the choice of Lt-gen Mateparae will be widely welcomed, particularly as he does not come from the usual legal background of most of those who have recently held the post.\n\nHis strong Maori linkage is important, since the relationship between Maori and the Crown is of such significance to Maori these days, and it is also good for our multi-cultural nation to have representatives of different ethnicities in our highest office.\n\nHis remarks on Tuesday - that he feels he could develop themes he has been interested in such as the notion of service to others, the \"drive for excellence\" and harnessing the strengths of young New Zealanders - are also a comfortable fit with many recent speeches and statements by the Prime Minister."
