        "text": "Please note that the term Premier was used until 1899.\n\nPrior to self-government there were two “unofficial ministries” led by James FitzGerald (14 June to 2 August 1854) and Thomas Forsaith (31 August to 2 September 1854). They were neither Premiers nor Colonial Secretaries.\n\nYou can find more detail on all MPs in the Roll of members of the NZ House of Representatives, 1854 onwards.\n\n[1] There were no political parties before 1890\n\n[2] Frederick Whitaker was a member of the Legislative Council and a member of the House of Representatives at different times. Both his terms as Premier were while he was a member of the Legislative Council.\n\n[3] George Waterhouse was a member of the Legislative Council\n\n[4] Daniel Pollen was a member of the Legislative Council"
