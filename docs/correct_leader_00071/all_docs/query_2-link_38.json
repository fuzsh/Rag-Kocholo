        "meta_description": "On March 12 1910 Masayoshi Ohira was born. He was Japanese Prime Minister from December 1978 until June 1980. He was the last Japanese Prime Minister to die in office after suffering a fatal heart attack on June 12 1980.\n\t\n\tHe was born in present day Kan'onji, Kagawa and attended Hitotsubashi University. After serving in the house of representatives, he became foreign minister (1962–64, 1972–74) and Minister of Finance (1974–76). A Liberal Democrat (LDP), he was elected Prime Minister in 1978.  In the general election of 1979, the LDP narrowly failed to win an outright majority, but enough independent members of the Diet joined the party to enable Ohira to remain in office, and he was duly reappointed on 9 November of that year. On 16 May 1980, a vote of no confidence was held in the Diet. Ohira expected the motion to fail, and was visibly shaken when it passed 243–187. Given the choice of resigning or calling new elections, Ohira chose the latter and began campaigning for LDP candidates. He was hospitalized for exhaustion on 31 May and died of a massive heart attack 12 days later.\n\t\n\tThe pictures shown here are of Masayoshi Ohira and New Zealand Prime Minister Keith Holyoake. These images are from October 1972 when Ohira was Foreign Minister of Japan. Ohira visited New Zealand from 14 to 16 October 1972. Keith Holyoake was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1960 to 1972. He later served as Governor General of New Zealand from 1977 to 1980. The images presented here are a selection from a Ministry of Foreign Affairs files on country profiles. They often include images of foreign visits by New Zealand politicians and foreign politicians visiting New Zealand.  \n\t\n\tReference: AAEG W2972 Box 1 12 <a href=\"https://collections.archives.govt.nz/web/arena/search#/?q=R9591955\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">collections.archives.govt.nz/web/arena/search#/?q=R9591955</a> \n\t\n\tFor further queries please email Research.Archives@dia.govt.nz \n\t\n\tFor updates on our On This Day series and news from Archives New Zealand, follow us on Twitter twitter.com/ArchivesNZ\n\t\n\tMaterial from Archives New Zealand",
