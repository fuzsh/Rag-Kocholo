        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nDeputy Prime Minister of\n\nNew Zealand\n\nIncumbent\n\nWinston Peters\n\nsince 27 November 2023\n\nDepartment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Style\n\nMr Deputy Prime Minister (informal)\n\nThe Honourable (formal)\n\nHis Excellency (diplomatic)\n\nMember of\n\nCabinet of New Zealand\n\nExecutive Council\n\nReports to Prime Minister of New Zealand Appointer Governor-General of New Zealand Term length No fixed term Formation 13 December 1949; 74 years ago ( ) First holder Keith Holyoake Salary NZ$334,734 annually\n\nThe deputy prime minister of New Zealand (MƒÅori: Te pirimia tuarua o Aotearoa) is the second-most senior member of the Cabinet of New Zealand. The officeholder usually deputises for the prime minister at official functions. The current deputy prime minister is Winston Peters, who has held the position twice before, and will serve until 31 May 2025 due an arrangement under the current coalition government in which he would then be succeeded in the position by ACT leader David Seymour.\n\nThe role existed on an informal basis for as long as the office of prime minister/premier has existed, but the office of \"deputy prime minister\" was formally established as a ministerial portfolio in 1949. This means that Keith Holyoake is considered the first deputy prime minister. It was formally designated as a full cabinet level position in 1954.\n\nAppointment and duties\n\nThe post of deputy prime minister was formally established in 1949. Eighteen individuals have held the position (two of them doing so twice) and of those people: Holyoake, Marshall, Watt, Muldoon, Palmer, Clark and English have eventually served as prime minister. The deputy prime minister has always been a member of the Cabinet, and has always held at least one substantive portfolio.\n\nThe deputy prime minister \"...can, if necessary\" exercise the statutory and constitutional functions and powers of the prime ministership if the prime minister is unavailable or unable. They can also do the same as acting prime minister, in consultation with the prime minister if it is appropriate and practicable. The deputy prime minister can also temporarily act as interim prime minister until the leadership of the government is determined in some cases, like the death of the prime minister.\n\nThe position is most commonly held by the deputy leader of the largest party, but since the adoption of the MMP electoral system in 1996 and the greater frequency of coalition governments in New Zealand, the role may instead go to the leader of a junior government party. This occurred has occurred three times with Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First, and once Jim Anderton, leader of the Alliance. The Sixth National Government, formed in 2023, intends to share the role of deputy prime minister between its two coalition partners for half the term each. Twice, the Labour Party has appointed a senior minister who was not the deputy party leader as the deputy prime minister (Grant Robertson and Carmel Sepuloni).\n\nLittle scholarly attention has focused on deputy prime ministers in New Zealand or elsewhere. In 2009, an article by Steven Barnes appeared in Political Science where nine 'qualities' of deputy prime ministership were identified: temperament; relationships with their Cabinet and caucus; relationships with their party; popularity with the public; media skills; achievements as deputy prime minister; relationship with the prime minister; leadership ambition; and method of succession. Barnes conducted a survey of journalists, academics, and former members of parliament to rank New Zealand deputy prime ministers up to that time since 1960. Across the nine deputy prime minister 'qualities', Don McKinnon achieved the number one ranking, followed by Brian Talboys, Michael Cullen, and Jack Marshall. In a second 'overall' ranking, Cullen was ranked number one, followed by Talboys, McKinnon, and Marshall. Winston Peters, Jim Anderton, and Bob Tizard were ranked lowest in both sections of the survey.\n\nList of deputy prime ministers of New Zealand\n\nKey\n\nAlliance Labour National NZ First"
