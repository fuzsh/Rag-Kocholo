Tyne & Wear Metro

The Metro covers the metropolitan county with 60 stations, with some stretches underground. It is fully mapped in OSM but there is more detail that can be added.

The Metro is operated by Nexus and Wikipedia has lots more info, including a map.

The majority of the line is above ground so it should be tagged railway=light_rail.

Metro stations

Stations can be mapped as railway=station and station=light_rail. Add platforms (railway=platform and public_transport=platform and platform number), ticket machines (amenity=vending_machine and vending_machine=public_transport_tickets), footbridges/subways, footpath links to road network etc. Most stations have cycle parking so add amenity=bicycle_parking. Benches, litter bins, station buildings, shops etc too.

Add railway=subway_entrance at the entrances to the underground stations.
