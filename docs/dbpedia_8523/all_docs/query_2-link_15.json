        "text": "A man who was born on leap day in 1940 has finally been able to celebrate his \"real 21st birthday\".\n\nRonald Mustard, from Sunderland, is 84 years old but has only been able to mark the exact day he was born every four years.\n\nA surprise celebration, which was themed around 1961 - when he was actually 21 - was held at dementia-friendly care home Archers Court in the city.\n\nStaff decided to throw the former painter and decorator a party to mark the \"milestone\", while helping him remember his younger days as part of his care.\n\nShe helped arrange the surprise bash, which included residents and staff dressing up as hippies while dancing to music from that era.\n\n\"He's the best person on this earth,\" Ms Mustard told BBC Look North.\n\n\"He's been mine and my brother's wingman for years and we're here to celebrate his 21st.\"\n\nSo-called 'leaplings' are rare and there is about a one in 1,461 chance of being born on 29 February.\n\nSharon Easterbrook-Smith, who runs the care home in Farringdon, said therapy with songs from residents' younger years was proven to help those with memory loss.\n\nShe said: \"Our people who live here have advanced dementia and music therapy is absolutely outstanding.\n\n\"It does really benefit the individuals... it's about unlocking memories.\"\n\nMs Mustard added that her father's ability to socialise and take part in activities \"had all come back\" after moving into the care home a year ago."
