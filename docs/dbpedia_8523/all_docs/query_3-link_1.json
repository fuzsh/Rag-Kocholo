        "text": "By plane\n\n[edit]\n\n(NCL IATA) is 6 miles northwest of Newcastle and served by the Metro. There are flights from London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris CDG, Dublin, other European and Med cities and Dubai. Domestic flights also connect Exeter, Southampton, Belfast and Aberdeen.\n\nManchester Airport (MAN IATA) has many long-haul flights and is just over 3 hours to Newcastle by train.\n\nDurham Tees Valley Airport (MME IATA) near Darlington has very few flights and is ill-served by public transport.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\n\nNewcastle has frequent trains from London King's Cross, taking 3 hours via Peterborough, York, Darlington and Durham, and continuing north to Berwick-upon-Tweed, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Trains also run hourly from Bristol and the southwest via Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds and York, from Liverpool via Manchester, Leeds and York, and from Carlisle via Hexham and continuing to Sunderland and Middlesbrough.\n\nSunderland has five direct trains from London, otherwise change at York.\n\nFor the other towns, change at Newcastle for the Tyne and Wear Metro. Washington has neither mainline nor Metro trains, change at Newcastle for the bus.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBuses by National Express and Megabus take 7 hours from London Victoria to Sunderland and Newcastle. There are also buses to Newcastle from London via Heathrow airport and the Midlands, from Liverpool via Manchester and Leeds, and from Glasgow via Edinburgh.\n\nRegional buses ply from Durham, from Carlisle via Hexham, and from Berwick-upon-Tweed via Alnwick and Morpeth.\n\nBy road\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main north-south route divides around the cities like a county-sized traffic island. For most destinations, including Newcastle, Gateshead and Washington, stay on A1(M) (which sweeps to the west) until the relevant turn-off. For Sunderland, South Tyneside and the north Tyneside towns, take A19 which bypasses to the east and goes through the Tyne Tunnel (toll).\n\nFrom Glasgow or Stranraer (for ferries from Ireland) head for Carlisle then follow A69 east - this road climbs no great hills and is rarely closed by winter weather. From Manchester cross the Pennines on M62 to join M1 / A1(M) north.\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nTyne & Wear Metro is quick and inexpensive, and is the best option between the area's towns. There are two lines, mostly overground: Green Line runs from Newcastle Airport to South Gosforth, Newcastle city centre, Gateshead, Heworth, Sunderland and South Hylton. Yellow Line makes a great loop north from St James in Newcastle city centre to Wallsend, North Shields, Tynemouth, Whitley Bay then South Gosforth, back through city centre (crossing itself at Monument) then Gateshead, Heworth, Jarrow and North Shields. So for the north bank of Tyne always take the anti-clockwise loop, but for Whitley Bay you could go either way.\n\nTrains run between 06:00 and 23:00, normally every 6-10 min but in 2021 / 22 this is scaled back to 12-15 min. There are three fare zones: a single for one is £2.10, two zones £3, all zones (eg from the airport) £3.70. A day-ticket for one zone is £3.30, for two is £4.40 and for all is £5.40. Plusbus tickets are not valid on the Metro.\n\nTicket machines take cards or cash. Main stations have ticket barriers. Outlying stations may have no gates or leave them open at quiet times, but ticket inspectors patrol and are wearily familiar with lame excuses by fare dodgers. Smoking is banned on the entire system, including open-air stations.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTyne and Wear has an extensive network, and for some areas such as Washington it's the only public transport. Fares are the same as the Metro but bus is slower, eg Newcastle to Tynemouth is an hour by bus and 30 min by Metro.\n\nMost routes across the region are by Go North East:\n\nBus 1 every 20 min from Gateshead to Newcastle, Wallsend, North Shields, Tynemouth and Whitley Bay.\n\nX1 every 15 min from Newcastle to Gateshead, Washington and Peterlee.\n\nBus 2 and 8 every 30 min between Sunderland and Washington.\n\nBus 9 every 30 min between Jarrow and Sunderland.\n\nBus 20 every 15 min from Durham to Sunderland and South Shields.\n\nBus 21 every 30 min from Durham to Chester-le-Street, Angel of the North, Gateshead and Newcastle\n\nX22 between Gateshead and Metrocentre.\n\nBus 27 every 15 min from Newcastle to Gateshead, Heworth, Jarrow and South Shields.\n\nBus 50 every 30 min from South Shields to Washington, Chester-le-Street and Durham.\n\nRoutes to the north are by Arriva:\n\nX8 every 30 min from Newcastle to Gosforth, Cramlington and Blyth.\n\nX12 hourly from Durham to Newcastle.\n\nBus 43 hourly from Newcastle to Gosforth, Cramlington and Morpeth.\n\nBus 51 hourly from Newcastle to Wallsend and Whitley Bay.\n\nStagecoach have short town routes, but also:\n\nBus 10 every 30 min from Hexham to Corbridge, Prudhoe, Blaydon, Metrocentre, Gateshead and Newcastle.\n\nX24 every 30 min between Sunderland, Gateshead and Newcastle.\n\nDay tickets are only valid for individual operators."
