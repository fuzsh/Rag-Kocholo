        "text": "Eloise Huff Garriss McManus, 102, passed away peacefully on August 4, 2024 at Brookridge Retirement Community in Winston Salem. Eloise was born May 23, 1922 in Pikeville, NC to Grey Cabe and Leta Huff Garriss. She graduated from Pikeville High School as valedictorian in 1938 and from Meredith College in 1942. Job searches led her to Sanford, NC where she met her future husband, Cummins W. McManus, Jr. (Mac), whom she married on March 11, 1944.\n\nEloise and Mac spent 45 happy years in Sanford and were very active in First Baptist Church. Together they owned and operated Mac’s Business Machines, Inc for 38 years. This plus rearing two children and keeping up with all their activities kept her busy.\n\nIn Sept 1989 Mr. and Mrs. McManus moved to the Brookridge Retirement Community in Winston Salem and joined Knollwood Baptist Church. Since they had been very involved with the Lions Club in Sanford, no time was lost in transferring membership to the Lions Club and Lady Lions in Winston Salem. Eloise continued to stay busy at Brookridge with many volunteer activities—the main one as manager of the “convenience store” (gift shop) until she was 98.\n\nIn addition to her parents, she was also preceded in death by her husband in 2001; her sister Frances Garriss Baker and husband Herbert; great-niece LeeAnn Baker; her sister-in-law and husband Bess McManus and Earl Vaughn.\n\nSurviving are her daughter, Frances McManus LeRoy and friend Dwight Mace of Holden Beach, NC and son David Cummins McManus and wife Laura of Louisville, KY. Her grandchildren are Forrest LeRoy (Dina) of Apex; David LeRoy (Erika), great-granddaughter Bella, step-great-grandsons Fernando and Dominick of Hillsborough; Meredith LeRoy Hunter (Nicholas), great-grandsons Ran and Caladin of Sanford. Also surviving are a special niece, Anne Baker Adams, nephews Herb Baker (Linda) of Winston Salem; Grey Baker (Pat) and Dr. Clifton Baker (Teresa) of Denton. Also surviving are numerous great and great-great-grand nieces and nephews and many cousins in NC, GA, SC and TN.\n\nA visitation will be held on Friday, August 9, 2024 from 1:30-2:30 at Rogers Pickard Funeral Home in Sanford. The service of remembrance will follow at 2:30. A Celebration of Life Service will be held at Brookridge Retirement Home in Winston Salem at 10:30 on Saturday, August 10.\n\nMemorials may be made to Brookridge Benevolent Fund, 1199 Hayes Forest Dr., Winston Salem, NC 27106, or Knollwood Baptist Church, 330 Knollwood St., Winston Salem, NC 27103."
