        "text": "Dear Roker Report,\n\nStanding on the Palatine Hill in Rome, among the glories of Ancient Rome, I can’t help but reflect on the current state of play at Sunderland AFC.\n\nRome wasn’t built in a day, and Sunderland won’t be transformed back into a Premier League side in a few years. That’s fair and reasonable.\n\nHowever, I’m sorry, Kristjaan Speakman, if this is another ‘et tu brute’ comment, but I take serious issue with the recruitment policy.\n\nA reluctance to pay the market rate for players of the requisite quality to gain promotion to the Premier League appears to overlook the revenue gained by promotion, and in my opinion, the enhanced value of a player who is/was in the Premier League instead of the Championship.\n\nAlso, as a kind of financial ‘belt and braces’, the right player will increase in value if he’s successful. This applies to Ellis Simms and many more players besides.\n\nAm I right or am I wrong? Is it rocket science? If the answer is yes, please can Sunderland hire and be advised by a rocket scientist as soon as possible?\n\nGrazie…but I suspect that I’ll enjoy the Aperol I’m about to drink considerably more than the 2024/2025 season.\n\nArrivederci.\n\nChris Walton\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Chris. Thank you for your letter.\n\nThis is the eternal question that hovers over Sunderland’s current way of operating.\n\nDo we loosen the purse strings in the knowledge that fees paid for players could be offset by the riches of the Premier League, or do we stay on our current course and show faith with the players we already have to hopefully deliver top flight promotion without greater financial outlay?\n\nAfter last season, you could hardly blame the fans for demanding changes to the current structure, but at the same time, it’s obvious that those overseeing it have an unshakable belief in what they’re doing.\n\nThis season is crucial and will go a long way to determining what the immediate future of the club might hold. For the sake of a season of progress and not further stagnation, I really hope we get it right.\n\nDear Roker Report,\n\nOnce again, thanks for publishing my grumblings and also for your admirable attempts to put a positive face on your response. Oh, to have been born in Manchester, Liverpool, or London!\n\nYou correctly suggest that Sunderland’s recent recruitment has enjoyed ‘mixed results’ and includes signings ‘that haven’t worked out’. However, I would say that you’re putting it mildly.\n\nI’ve named a complete team of players who’ve fallen well short of the standard the club should be aiming for and I haven’t even included Eliezer Mayenda and Adil Aouchiche- two others who’ve flattered to deceive.\n\nLeeds, West Ham, and Spurs allowed Niall Huggins, Aji Alese, and Dennis Cirkin to join us, and all three deals included considerable sell-on clauses, should they flourish and reach their considerable potential. However, so far, they’ve all missed more games than they’ve managed to play.\n\nMeanwhile, the club pays their wages and spends thousands of pounds on treatment and rehab before one or all three suffers another injury and drops out of the team. I would call that good business on behalf of their previous clubs and it would be interesting to see their past medical records!\n\nYou mention the fact that our recruitment team have had some outstanding successes. Presumably, you’re thinking of the likes of Trai Hume, Dan Ballard, and Jack Clarke?\n\nThose three, along with Anthony Patterson, Luke O’Nien, Dan Neil, Chris Rigg, and hopefully Alan Browne should form the framework of a squad capable of competing at the top end of the Championship, and if Huggins, Cirkin, or Alese could make 30+ appearances apiece, so much the better.\n\nYou might have noticed that I’ve omitted Patrick Roberts, Pierre Ekwah, and Jobe Bellingham, and the first two because at times they blow hot and cold.\n\nYou simply don’t know which version of a talented player has run down the tunnel, and in the case of Roberts last season, the talented version stayed in the tunnel!\n\nAs for Jobe, while acknowledging that he did score seven goals last season, I still think there’s a great deal of hype around him which is linked to his big brother. He constantly runs down blind alleys with the ball and repeatedly fails to see a simple pass or a player in a better position.\n\nI feel that a good proportion of our 35,000+ crowd seemingly agree with me, as Sunderland fans aren’t easily conned. A frequent defence of Jobe’s end-of-season decline was that he was overplayed. Whose fault was that? Who was picking the team?\n\nFinally, why has Kristjaan Speakman brought in another talented, ‘dodgy winger’ who needs to get up to speed before he can compete?\n\nTop class, dedicated professional athletes don’t allow themselves to fall so far behind that they have to play catch up, and if Alexandre Mendy does arrive, he’ll present exactly the same problem.\n\nSorry to be so negative, but it’s part of the illness/affliction which began when, as a twelve-year-old boy, I first entered Roker Park in 1962 to witness a dreadfully boring draw against Aston Villa.\n\nI was hooked!\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Alan. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nOn the subject of Jobe, I think we’ll have to agree to disagree.\n\nI think he’s an exceptionally talented footballer with a huge role to play for us during the coming season, as well as someone who’s conducted himself impeccably since arriving. You’ve got a slightly different view, which is absolutely fair, but what I’d also say is that I rarely heard Jobe being criticised on the terraces or the concourses last season, even as he went through ups and downs in form.\n\nI think the majority of Sunderland fans are fully behind this lad, and I see no reason why that should change during 2024/2025.\n\nOn the subject of our recruitment, I certainly wasn’t attempting to create a narrative or peddle an agenda with my previous reply.\n\nI’ve broadly backed the current strategy since it was implemented and I do believe that it’s been a far more fruitful way of working than the way we used to do business. That’s not to say that it’s not without flaws, and in my opinion, this summer’s transfer business has been largely underwhelming thus far, with Alan Browne the only signing who improves our starting eleven.\n\nSpeaking of our summer business, Ian Poveda, who you mention in your letter, is very much a wildcard signing, and I’m not entirely sure where he fits in at this stage.\n\nTo my mind, we’re currently four players (two strikers, a central defensive midfielder and a centre back) short of having a competitive Championship squad.\n\nIf we don’t add those players before the window closes and Régis Le Bris doesn’t have the resources he needs come September, Kristjaan Speakman and company will rightly be criticised, just as they should be praised when they get things right.\n\nI think that’s a fair way of assessing the job they’re doing at Sunderland.\n\nDear Roker Report,\n\nI went to the Stadium of Light ticket office and they told me they don’t deal with tickets.\n\nIf I have a problem, I should go back to the ticket office and they will give me a temporary ticket.\n\nJust the ticket.\n\nT Young\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Thank you for your letter.\n\nIt’s disappointing to hear that there are still glitches within the club’s ticketing system, but with any luck, the opening of the new ticket office will bring about a positive change in customer experiences when dealing with such problems.\n\nWe’re owed that at the minimum.\n\nDear Roker Report,\n\nI’ve been to the ticket office three times.\n\nI was told it would be sent out on 29 July, then 31 July, but I still haven’t received my card.\n\nIt’s getting to be a bit of a joke, but they take your money straightaway.\n\nRoderick Stanger\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Roderick. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nOnce again, it’s a real shame to hear that fans are experiencing issues with their tickets. Generally, the rollout of 2024/2025 season cards seems to have been reasonably smooth, but clearly there have been some issues.\n\nI really hope it gets sorted for you as soon as possible."
