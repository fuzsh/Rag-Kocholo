Another is that it derives from a term of abuse coined by the Scottish Jacobites in the 1745 Rebellion because of the defence of the town of Newcastle against them by supporters of King George (Geordie) II. The second theory is more plausible because the term Geordie is properly used for natives of Newcastle only. Others originating from the north-east are Tynesiders (from the towns along the Tyne, from Blaydon and Newburn downstream), Northumbrians, Durhamites (Dunhelmians if you are posh) or Makems (from Sunderland). Stephenson, born in Wylam, Northumberland, was not a Geordie except as a corruption of his Christian name.\n\nRobin King, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nI watched Billy Conolly's tour of the UK the other night and he said it was something to do with the name of the lamps the minors used to use. All the other minors in Britain started using a new kind of lamp but those in Newcastle kept the old type of lamp (which I think was known as a Geordie or something close) and the other minors would refer to those in Newcastle as 'Geordies'. Billy connolly said this is definately the true story and I beleive Billy!\n\nJulie, Hampshire UK\n\nThe inhabitants of Newcastle were called \"Geordies\" long before George Stevenson invented the Geordie safety lamp.\n\nIan Ross, Edinburgh Scotland\n\nThe original Geordies were miners from Felling coal pit. After an explosion in 1812, George Stephenson invented the Geordie lamp in 1914. So all north east miners were nicknamed Geordies. Also railwaymen, keelmen and sailors.\n\nBryan Oakley, Felling, Tyne Wear\n\nThe third possible origin is from George Stephenson, who in 1815 invented the miners' lamp. The Northumberland miners used this lamp in preference to that invented by Sir Humphrey Davy at the same time, and the lamp, and eventually the miners themselves became known as Geordies.\n\nSean Thompson, the toon! england\n\nIt is more likely that it refers to support for brave King George 2nd, the last English & British monarch to lead his troops in battle, because Newcastle upon Tyne was one of the few ports to support King Charles 1st in the Civil War & while there was support for the Jacobites in the countryside of Northumberland it was not so in the great city of Newcastle, which was always wary of the Scots anyway. A question any Geordie should be able to answer, \"Who won the battle of Trafalgar?\" Answer: Admiral Collingwoood, Nelson's second in command. I don't care - I'm a Devonian & so Frankie Drake is the greatest English & British 'Sea King'!\n\nPeter Dorr, BOSTON -The Original Lincolnshire\n\nThinking that geordies are named after the so called mineing lamp is just ridiculous! Geordies have been named so long before by our support for King George the second and have many a deep history of this in our TOWN! And ever since we are notorious for liking a good scrap.\n\nadam nowell (geordie ) , newcastle tyne and wear\n\nThe various explanations are interesting but there's earlier evidence of the use of Geordie. If you read The Steel Bonnets by George MacDonald Fraser you'll get more information, although he doesn't identify where the word Geordie comes from. English-Scottish relations along the border between the two countries were always very strained from 1000 to the 1600's. There was constant pillaging, looting, kidnapping, murder, and assorted mayhem. The Border Reivers feuded continuously with each other as a way of life. There were many important families on either side of the Border, who still live in the region today. The reivers all had colourful names- - Ill Will Armstrong, Jock Stowlugs Armstrong, Fergie the Crow Bell, Nebless Clem Croser, Jock Halfe Lugs Eliot, Fingerless Will Nixon, . Geordie was a common name among these Border families - mentioned in Fraser's book are Geordie Kang Irvine, Ill-Drowned Geordie Nixon, Jingling Geordie.\n\nHenry Spall, North Shields England\n\nWell I have read all these so called stories on here and I would like to let every one know my side of the so called story. Firstly my dad was born in 1898 in the village of Seaton. Nr Newcastle upon Tyne. He used to tell me stories from his grandfather about how the Geordies became about. Well one of the stories, one have you have mentioned is more then likely to be true the story of king George his men were known as Geordies men this goes back as far as my Great Great Grandfather.
