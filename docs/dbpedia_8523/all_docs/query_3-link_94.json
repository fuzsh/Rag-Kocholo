        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Iraqi and Syrian occupation of town is nowadays forgotten, let bygones be bygones. But in 200 AD the Roman army recruited from those territories and brought so many to serve here that the depot fort was called Arbeia, the Arab place. Their job was to tote supplies from the ship wharves to the old castle of Pons Aelius, then up the military roads west along Hadrian's Wall (built 80 years earlier) or north into the bandit lands of the Picts. The Romans left around 400 AD and in their wake eventually grew up a kingdom of Northumbria, which knew the town as Munucceaster. But again and again, the region was devastated by Viking raids: what it needed was a new castle.\n\nRobert Curthose obliged in 1080, fearing attack by Scots or rebels, though he mostly warred with his own family. (He was the eldest son of William the Conqueror but was disinherited, to spend his last 20 years in dungeons.) His wooden Novum Castellum was soon replaced by a stone castle, then another in 1172 which is the ruin you see today. Its walls were extended to protect the entire town, which stood out against the Scots and for several months against Cromwell; the region was Royalist in the Civil Wars then fell to assault.\n\nNewcastle became industrial early in the Middle Ages, from salt-panning, coal that was shallow and easily mined, limestone quarried for masonry and quicklime, and farm produce from the fertile hinterland. Trade and transport by sea were important, including from London in an era when roads were miserable cart tracks, but it was only one of many ports along the Tyne, and small sailing vessels didn't need much harbour facilities. The burgesses of Newcastle set fire to the rival port at North Shields, but their masterstroke in 1290 was to win a Royal monopoly on local mining and export of coal. This lucrative cartel was only busted in 1750, while the other ports subsisted on other trade such as fish.\n\nThe city's industrial heyday was in the 19th century, with deep mining of coal, smoke-stack industry including shipbuilding, and a busy port. Urban squalour co-existed with the elegant central district of Grainger Town and Grey Street, nowadays one of the finest cityscapes in Britain. There were horrible accidents, cholera and a devastating factory explosion, but there was also electric lighting, steam-hauled railways and turboprop ships. The 20th century brought the slump of the miners' strike, the Depression and wartime bombing. There was enough variety and innovation of trade for the city to recover, with a growing public sector, two universities and attractive new architecture. By the 21st century, Newcastle could re-launch itself as a year-round leisure travel destination.\n\nThe climate is cool in summer (around 20°C) and seldom below freezing in winter. It's not particularly wet but can rain any time: see Tyne and Wear climate chart. Daylight hours range from 4:30AM to 9:45PM in the summer, to 8:30AM to just after 3:30PM in winter.\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nVisit Northeast England\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nAn alternative is Manchester Airport (MAN IATA), with a great range of long-haul flights, saving the hassle of a change in Heathrow or Amsterdam. From the airport railway station, it's 3 hours to Newcastle: you may need to change at Manchester Piccadilly or York.\n\nTo and from the city\n\n[edit]\n\nBy Metro: A journey on the Tyne and Wear Metro takes around 20–25 minutes, with up to 5 trains per hour running during the day and up to 4 trains per hour running in the evening and on Sunday. As of July 2022, a single three-zone ticket costs £3.90 and an all-day three-zone ticket costs £5.70.\n\nBy bus: Stagecoach operate the half-hourly X78 service, which runs express to Eldon Square via Ponteland Road, with an average journey time of around 20–25 minutes.\n\nBy taxi: There is a taxi rank at the airport, with an average fare of around £15.00–£20.00.\n\nBy car: The airport is situated off the A696, which can be reached easily from a number of principal routes, including the A1, A68 & A69. The estimated journey time to the city centre from Newcastle International Airport is 15–20 minutes, with an increased travel time during peak hours.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Great Britain\n\nNewcastle is on the East Coast Main Line, with the following services:\n\nLNER trains running once or twice an hour between Edinburgh (90 min) and London King's Cross (3 hours) via York (one hour).\n\nLumo also operate a few trains between Edinburgh and London.\n\nCrossCountry runs hourly from the West Country via Birmingham (3 hours 30 min), Sheffield (2 hours 15 minutes), Leeds (90 min) and York.\n\nTransPennine Express runs from Liverpool via Manchester Victoria (2 hours 30 min). The direct train from Manchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly remains suspended in March 2023.\n\nNorthern Trains run from Carlisle (90 min) via Hexham and from Middlesbrough (80 min).\n\nFor timetables, fares, disruptions and real-time service information see National Rail. You can supplement your rail ticket with a Plusbus ticket for local buses. See the \"Get around\" section for further information. In most cases, few travellers benefit.\n\nCentral Station is on both lines of the Tyne & Wear Metro, with frequent trains to the airport, suburbs, Gateshead and outlying towns. See below.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom north or south follow A1(M), which passes west of the city by Metrocentre. For most central destinations, use Exit 69 onto A184, which brings you in via Gateshead and the Tyne Bridge. Don't take A19, which bypasses the city away to the east via the toll tunnel. From Glasgow or Stranraer (from Ireland) head via Carlisle onto A69.\n\nNewcastle Park & Rides are aimed at commuters from rural Northumberland, so they're mostly north and west:\n\nCallerton Parkway and Kingston are on the Metro Green Line from the airport,\n\nNewcastle Great Park at Wide Open uses the bus (but is closed in 2022)\n\nRegent Centre to the north is on the Metro Yellow Line, as is Walkergate to the east.\n\nHeworth near Gateshead is the only P&R south of the River Tyne: it's on both Metro lines but not particularly convenient for the A1.\n\nThe city centre has multi-storey carparks with over 10,000 spaces, charging around £2 per hour M-Sa 8AM-5PM and free at other times. Street parking is a last resort: it's pricey, is typically for a maximum of one hour, and the only space you can find is obstructed by a builder's skip.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Express buses take 7-8 hours from London Victoria via Milton Keynes, Sheffield, Leeds, Middlesbrough and Sunderland; one-way fares from London start from £7. There are three morning departures, one afternoon and one overnight. Four buses a day run from Liverpool via Manchester airport and city and Leeds, though you may need to change. Three a day run from Birmingham via Sheffield and Leeds, and three a day from Glasgow via Edinburgh.\n\nMegabus have five buses a day from London Victoria, for similar fares. The fastest take 7 hours, but some take 10 hours via Heathrow airport, Coventry, Birmingham airport and city, Manchester airport and city, Huddersfield, Leeds, Middlesbrough and Sunderland. Megabus don't use Newcastle bus station, they stop on John Dobson Street a couple of blocks east of Eldon Square, close to the universities.\n\nStagecoach Bus 685 runs from Carlisle via Brampton, Haltwhistle (for Hadrian's Wall), Hexham, Corbridge and Heddon-on-the-Wall. It's supposed to be an hourly service but is sporadic in 2022. See Tyne and Wear#Get around for regional bus routes: you're always better by train or Metro where available, for instance from Berwick-upon-Tweed, Durham or Sunderland.\n\nis simply a 5-bay bus stop with no waiting room or ticket office, but it's near city amenities. It's on Churchill St a quarter mile west of the mainline and Metro stations.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nPort of Tyne, 7 mi (11 km) east of city centre, has overnight DFDS ferries from IJmuiden near Amsterdam. See Tynemouth#Get in for how to get there.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nWalking is always first choice for city centre, the university main campuses, Quayside and the opposite river bank of Gateshead.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nNewcastle is a reasonably cycle-friendly city, with cycle lanes and lock-up points. A few Metro stations have secure storage for bicycles, but only fold-away bikes are permitted on Metro trains. You don't need a bike in town, but might use one to explore Hadrian's Wall path or venture out to the coast. See Tyne and Wear#Get in for long distance bike routes.\n\nNewcastle doesn't have a bike-share scheme, and the shops sell bikes and kit but don't hire, however there is one rental facility:\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nGo North East Q3 or Quaylink runs every 30 min south from Great Park P&R through Gosforth, Jesmond, Haymarket and Pilgrim St in city centre, then east along Quayside to St Peter's, Walker and Wallsend. Bus 33 also runs between Gosforth, Jesmond and the centre.\n\nBus 1 runs every 30 min from Gateshead to Market St in city centre, then east to Wallsend and the coast.\n\nThese city buses ply the streets and don't use the bus station. See Tyne and Wear#Get around for buses to the outlying towns, and individual towns' \"Get in\".\n\nThe bus companies offer day-tickets and longer passes, but these are only valid for the issuing company, with a variety of fare zones. For instance a Go North East day-ticket for city centre in 2022 is £5.30, more than separate there-and-back singles.\n\nPlusbus is a supplement to your rail ticket, valid for local buses but not the Metro. A day ticket is adult £4, child £2. The travel area corresponds to Fare Zones A+B, so it costs more than an ordinary single, and only makes sense for multiple journeys. 7-day and longer tickets are available.\n\nBy Metro\n\n[edit]\n\nTyne & Wear Metro is quick and inexpensive, and is the best option for outlying areas. There are two lines, mostly overground, but running together underground through the city centre.\n\nThe Green Line runs from the airport to South Gosforth, the city centre, Gateshead, Heworth, Sunderland and South Hylton.\n\nThe Yellow Line makes a great loop north from St James in the city centre to Wallsend, North Shields, Tynemouth, Whitley Bay then South Gosforth, back through the city centre (crossing itself at Monument) then Gateshead, Heworth, Jarrow and North Shields. So for the north bank of Tyne always take the anti-clockwise loop, but for Whitley Bay, you could go either way.\n\nTrains run between 6AM and 11PM, normally every 6-10 min but in 2021/22 this is scaled back to 12-15 min. There are three fare zones: in 2022 a single for one is £2.30, two zones £3.20 and all zones (e.g. from the airport) £3.90. A day ticket for one zone is £3.60, for two is £4.70 and for all is £5.70. Plusbus is not valid on the Metro.\n\nTicket machines take cards or cash. Main stations have ticket barriers. Outlying stations may have no gates or leave them open at quiet times, but ticket inspectors patrol and are wearily familiar with lame excuses by fare dodgers. Smoking is banned in the entire system, including open-air stations. All stations on the network offer step-free access from street to train, and the metro carriages have ample space for wheelchairs. Mobility scooters are not allowed on the Metro.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nYou might use train rather than Metro or bus for a few districts, for similar fares:\n\nnorth via Manors (for both universities) to Cramlington and Morpeth. Manors Metro is 100 yards north of Manors railway station so it's not mapped as an interchange, but a short walk.\n\nwest via Dunston (west edge of Gateshead) and Metrocentre to Prudhoe, Corbridge, Hexham and Carlisle.\n\nsoutheast via Heworth to Sunderland, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough.\n\nA new line is under construction in 2022 through the northern suburbs to Blyth and Ashington. It might open in 2024.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nOperators include Premier (incorporating Newcastle Taxis) ☏ , LA Taxis ☏ , Blueline ☏ , and Uber. They all get mixed reviews for reliability and general state of repair of vehicles and drivers. A ride from city centre to the airport in 2022 is around £15, and to the ferry terminal is £18."
