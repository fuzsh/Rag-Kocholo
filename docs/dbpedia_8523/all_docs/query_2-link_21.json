        "text": "Sunderland's population decreased\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Sunderland fell by 0.5%, from around 275,500 in 2011 to around 274,200 in 2021.\n\nThis means Sunderland was one of only three local authority areas in the North East to see its population decline. The regional population increased by 1.9%, while the population of England increased by 6.6%.\n\nIn 2021, Sunderland was home to around 14.2 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 14.3 in 2011. This area was among the top 30% most densely populated English local authority areas at the last census.\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nThe population of Sunderland decreased by around 0.5%\n\nPercentage population change, Sunderland and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% North East ▲1.9% Sunderland ▼-0.5% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nAn older Sunderland\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Sunderland increased by two years, from 41 to 43 years of age.\n\nThis area had a slightly higher average (median) age than the North East as a whole in 2021 (42 years) and a higher average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 65 to 74 years rose by just under 6,600 (an increase of 26.2%), while the number of residents between 35 and 49 years fell by around 8,400 (14.5% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 65 and 74 years increased by 2.4 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nFamily in Sunderland\n\nSunderland saw England's joint third-largest percentage-point fall (alongside Burnley and South Ribble ) in the proportion of households including a couple with only non-dependent children (from 8.1% in 2011 to 7.4% in 2021).\n\nEngland's largest decreases in the percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children occurred in Isles of Scilly (from 4.8% to 2.2%) followed by North East Derbyshire (from 7.8% to 6.9%).\n\nBecause of its small size, comparisons to Isles of Scilly should be made with caution.\n\nDespite the decrease, Sunderland was in the highest 15% of English local authority areas for the share of households including a couple with only non-dependent children in 2021.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children in Sunderland decreased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nRise in private renting\n\nIn 2021, 14.8% of Sunderland households rented privately. This figure increased from 12.2% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in four households (26.6%) lived in socially rented housing, compared with 27.1% in 2011. The percentage of Sunderland households that owned their home (outright or with a mortgage or loan) decreased from 59.8% to 58.1%.\n\nThis area had the region’s second lowest percentage of privately-rented homes. Across the region, only South Tyneside , with 13.2%, had a lower percentage.\n\nPrivate renting in Sunderland increased by 2.7 percentage points\n\nHealth in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 43.6% of Sunderland residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 41.4% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" rose from 32.8% to 33.1%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Sunderland residents describing their health as \"very bad\" decreased from 2.1% to 1.8%, while those describing their health as \"bad\" fell from 6.9% to 6.0%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in bad health in Sunderland decreased by 0.9 percentage points\n\nChange in unpaid care\n\nSunderland saw the North East's joint second-largest percentage-point rise (alongside Middlesbrough and South Tyneside) in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing between 20 and 49 hours of weekly unpaid care (from 2.0% in 2011 to 2.7% in 2021). These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nAcross the region, only Hartlepool saw a greater rise in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing between 20 and 49 hours of weekly unpaid care (from 1.8% to 2.9%).\n\nEvery local authority area across the North East saw a rise in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing between 20 and 49 hours of weekly unpaid care, as the regional proportion grew from 1.7% to 2.3%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of those providing between 20 and 49 hours of weekly unpaid care in Sunderland increased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nSunderland residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 256,500 Sunderland residents said they were born in England. This represented 93.5% of the local population. The figure has decreased from around 260,200 in 2011, which at the time represented 94.4% of Sunderland's population.\n\nScotland was the next most represented, with just over 2,500 Sunderland residents reporting this country of birth (0.9%). This figure was down from around 2,800 in 2011, which at the time represented 1.0% of the population of Sunderland.\n\nThe number of Sunderland residents born in Nigeria rose from just under 450 in 2011 (0.2% of the local population) to around 1,200 in 2021 (0.5%).\n\nIn 2021, 93.5% of Sunderland residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nMore adults never married or in a civil partnership\n\nOf Sunderland residents aged 16 years and over, 38.7% said they had never been married or in a civil partnership in 2021, up from 35.3% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over 4 in 10 people (42.6%) said they were married or in a registered civil partnership, compared with 45.2% in 2011. The percentage of adults in Sunderland that had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership decreased from 9.2% to 9.0%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who had never been married or in a civil partnership was greater across the North East (3.7 percentage points, from 34.4% to 38.1%) than in Sunderland (3.4 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 3.3 percentage points, from 34.6% to 37.9%.\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had never married or registered a civil partnership in Sunderland increased by 3.4 percentage points\n\nFall in unemployment\n\nIn 2021, 3.2% of Sunderland residents (aged 16 years and over) said they were unemployed. This figure decreased from 5.3% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in two people (50.4%) said they were employed (excluding full-time students), compared with 51.5% in 2011. The percentage of retired Sunderland residents increased from 23.2% to 24.7%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were unemployed was greater in Sunderland (2.1 percentage points) than across the North East (1.8 percentage points, from 4.8% to 3.0%). Across England, the percentage fell by 1.1 percentage points, from 4.0% to 2.9%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were unemployed (excluding full-time students) in Sunderland decreased by 2.1 percentage points\n\nWorking hours in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 8.0% of Sunderland residents aged 16 years and over and in employment said they worked 15 hours or less per week. This figure was the same in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under 1 in 13 people (7.6%) said they worked over 49 hours per week, compared with 8.9% in 2011. The percentage of adults in employment working 31 to 48 hours per week increased from 60.9% to 62.8%.\n\nThis area had the region’s lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked 15 hours or less per week. North Tyneside had the North East's next lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked 15 hours or less per week (8.1%), while Newcastle upon Tyne had the region's highest percentage (11.9%).\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, 8.0% of usual residents aged 16 years and over and in employment said they worked 15 hours or less per week in Sunderland\n\nReligion in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 39.5% of Sunderland residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 21.9% in 2011. The rise of 17.6 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Sunderland. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the North East, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 23.4% to 40.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 53.2% of people in Sunderland described themselves as Christian (down from 70.3%), while 4.5% did not state their religion (down from 5.6% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 39.5% of usual residents in Sunderland reported having \"No religion\"\n\nNational identity in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 2.9% of Sunderland residents did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK. This figure increased from 2.5% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, 0.6% of residents identified with a UK and non-UK national identity, compared with 0.2% in 2011. The percentage of residents in Sunderland that identified as \"British only\" increased from 13.3% to 60.2%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK was greater across the North East (1.1 percentage points, from 2.9% to 4.1%) than in Sunderland (0.5 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points, from 8.2% to 10.0%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Sunderland increased by 0.5 percentage points\n\nDisability in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 11.9% of Sunderland residents were identified as being disabled and limited a little. This figure increased from 11.5% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in nine people (11.2%) were identified as being disabled and limited a lot, compared with 13.2% in 2011. The proportion of Sunderland residents who were not disabled increased from 75.3% to 76.9%.\n\nSunderland saw the North East's joint second-largest rise (alongside County Durham and South Tyneside) in the proportion of residents who were identified as disabled and limited a little. This area had the region’s second highest proportion of residents who were identified as disabled and limited a little.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a little in Sunderland increased by 0.4 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in Sunderland\n\nIn 2021, 1.0% of Sunderland residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category, up from 0.5% in 2011. The 0.5 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the North East, the percentage of people from the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" ethnic group increased from 0.5% to 1.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 3.5% to 4.2%.\n\nIn 2021, 94.6% of people in Sunderland identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 95.9% in 2011), while 3.0% identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category (compared with 2.7% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category increased from 0.6% in 2011 to 0.9% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 1.0% of usual residents in Sunderland identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place.
