        "text": "This historic deal marks a new devolution agreement between the government and the local authorities of Northumberland, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland, and County Durham. The devolution deal transfers new powers and a Â£1.4 billion investment fund over 30 years, which will enable the new Mayor and the councils to plan for the long term, with certainty, and unlock the benefits of devolution for 2 million people living in the area.\n\nBuilding on existing collaboration across the region and with central government, the new North East MCA will replace the existing North of Tyne MCA and the Mayor, as well as the non-mayoral North East Combined Authority. This will bring the region together and provide a more strategic economic geography, which encompasses the whole Tyne and Wear region, as well as Northumberland and Durham. These changes are subject to the statutory processes, including local consultation and Parliamentary approval.\n\nIn addition to the 30 year investment fund, the deal will devolve the MCA control over the Adult Education budget so they can shape provision in a way that best suits the needs of local people; give control to the region of over half a billion pounds to upgrade public transport through a new City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement; and provide immediate support to build new affordable homes on brownfield sites. There will also be a funding pot available to help place based regeneration across the region."
