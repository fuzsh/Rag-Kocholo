        "text": "County of England\n\n\"T&W\" redirects here. For the unitary authority in Shropshire, see Telford and Wrekin.\n\nMetropolitan and ceremonial county in England\n\nTyne and Wear ( ) is a ceremonial county in North East England. It borders Northumberland to the north and County Durham to the south, and the largest settlement is the city of Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nThe county is largely urbanised. It had a population of 1.14 million in 2021. After Newcastle (300,125) the largest settlements are the city of Sunderland (170,134), Gateshead (120,046), and South Shields (75,337). Nearly all of the county's settlements belong to either the Tyneside or Wearside conurbations, the latter of which also extends into County Durham. Tyne and Wear contains five metropolitan boroughs: Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, all of which form part of the North East Combined Authority, along with County Durham and Northumberland. The county was established in 1974 and was historically part of Northumberland and County Durham, with the River Tyne forming the border between the two. Its county council was abolished in 1986, but the county continues to exist.\n\nThe most notable geographic features of the county are the River Tyne and River Wear, after which it is named and along which its major settlements developed. The county is also notable for its coastline to the North Sea in the east, which is characterised by tall limestone cliffs and wide beaches.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 600s and into the 700s Saint Bede lived as a monk at the monastery of St. Peter and of St. Paul writing histories of the Early Middle Ages including the Ecclesiastical History of the English People.[4]\n\nRoughly 150 years ago, in the village of Marsden in South Shields, Souter Lighthouse was built, the first electric structure of this type.[5]\n\nThe Local Government Act 1888 constituted Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and Sunderland as county boroughs (Newcastle had \"county corporate\" status as the \"County and Town of Newcastle upon Tyne\" since 1400). Tynemouth joined them in 1904. Between the county boroughs, various other settlements also formed part of the administrative counties of Durham and of Northumberland.\n\nThe need to reform local government on Tyneside was recognised by the government as early as 1935, when a Royal Commission to Investigate the Conditions of Local Government on Tyneside was appointed.[6] The three commissioners were to:\n\nexamine the system of local government in the areas of local government north and south of the river Tyne from the sea to the boundary of the Rural District of Castle Ward and Hexham in the County of Northumberland and to the Western boundary of the County of Durham, to consider what changes, if any, should be made in the existing arrangements with a view to securing greater economy and efficiency, and to make recommendations.\n\nThe report of the Royal Commission, published in 1937,[7] recommended the establishment of a Regional Council for Northumberland and Tyneside (to be called the \"Northumberland Regional Council\") to administer services that needed to be exercised over a wide area, with a second tier of smaller units for other local-government purposes. The second-tier units would form by amalgamating the various existing boroughs and districts. The county boroughs in the area would lose their status. Within this area, a single municipality would be formed covering the four county boroughs of Newcastle, Gateshead, Tynemouth, South Shields and other urban districts and boroughs.[8]\n\nA minority report proposed amalgamation of Newcastle, Gateshead, Wallsend, Jarrow, Felling, Gosforth, Hebburn and Newburn into a single \"county borough of Newcastle-on-Tyneside\". The 1937 proposals never came into operation: local authorities could not agree on a scheme and the legislation of the time did not allow central government to compel one.[9]\n\nTyneside (excluding Sunderland) was a special review area under the Local Government Act 1958. The Local Government Commission for England came back with a recommendation to create a new county of Tyneside based on the review area, divided into four separate boroughs. This was not implemented. The Redcliffe-Maud Report proposed a Tyneside unitary authority, again excluding Sunderland, which would have set up a separate East Durham unitary authority.\n\nThe white paper that led to the Local Government Act 1972 proposed as \"area 2\" a metropolitan county including Newcastle and Sunderland, extending as far south down the coast as Seaham and Easington, and bordering \"area 4\" (which would become Tees Valley). The Bill as presented in November 1971 pruned back the southern edge of the area, and gave it the name \"Tyneside\". The name \"Tyneside\" proved controversial on Wearside, and a government amendment changed the name to \"Tyne and Wear\" at the request of Sunderland County Borough Council.[10]\n\npost-1974 pre-1974 Metropolitan county Metropolitan borough County boroughs Non-county boroughs Urban districts Rural districts\n\nTyne and Wear amalgamates 24 former local government districts, including five county boroughs.\n\nGateshead Gateshead - Blaydon • Felling • Ryton • Whickham Chester-le-Street Newcastle upon Tyne Newcastle upon Tyne - Gosforth • Newburn Castle Ward North Tyneside Tynemouth Wallsend • Whitley Bay Longbenton • Seaton Valley - South Tyneside South Shields Jarrow Boldon • Hebburn - Sunderland Sunderland - Washington • Houghton-le-Spring • Hetton-le-Hole Easington\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nTyne and Wear either has or closely borders two official Met Office stations, neither located in one of the major urban centres. The locations for those are in marine Tynemouth where Tyne meets the North Sea east of Newcastle and inland Durham in County Durham around 20 kilometres (12 mi) south-west of Sunderland. There are some clear differences between the stations temperature and precipitation patterns even though both have a cool-summer and mild-winter oceanic climate.\n\nGreen belt\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: North East Green Belt\n\nTyne and Wear contains green belt interspersed throughout the county, mainly on the fringes of the Tyneside/Wearside conurbation. There is also an inter-urban line of belt helping to keep the districts of South Tyneside, Gateshead, and Sunderland separated. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county's districts contain some portion of belt.\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Tyne and Wear County Council was abolished in 1986, several joint bodies exist to run certain services on a county-wide basis. Most notable is the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority, which co-ordinates transport policy. Through its passenger transport executive, known as Nexus, it owns and operates the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail system, and the Shields ferry service and the Tyne Tunnel, linking communities on either side of the River Tyne. Also through Nexus, the authority subsidises socially necessary transport services (including taxis) and operates a concessionary fares scheme for the elderly and disabled. Nexus has been an executive body of the North East Joint Transport Committee since November 2018.\n\nOther joint bodies include the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums, which was created from the merger of the Tyne and Wear Archives Service and Tyne and Wear Museums. These joint bodies are administered by representatives of all five of the constituent councils. In addition the Northumbria Police force covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear.\n\nThere have been occasional calls for Tyne and Wear to be abolished and the traditional border between Northumberland and County Durham to be restored.[17][18]\n\nTyne and Wear is divided into 12 parliamentary constituencies. Historically, the area has been a Labour stronghold; South Shields is the only Parliamentary constituency that has never returned a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons since the Reform Act of 1832.\n\nGeneral Election 2019 : Tyne and Wear Labour Liberal Democrats Conser­vative Brexit Others Green Turnout 247,317\n\n36,417\n\n160,155\n\n47,142\n\n10,504\n\n16,010\n\n517,545\n\nOverall Number of seats as of 2019 Labour Liberal Democrats Conser­vative BNP UKIP Others Green 12 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAt the level of local government, all of the region's five unitary authorities were controlled by Labour in 2019.\n\nNewcastle and Sunderland are known for declaring their election results early on election night.[19] Therefore, they frequently give the first indication of nationwide trends. An example of this was at the 2016 European Union referendum. Newcastle was the first large city to declare, and 50.6% of voters voted to Remain; this proportion was far lower than predicted by experts.
