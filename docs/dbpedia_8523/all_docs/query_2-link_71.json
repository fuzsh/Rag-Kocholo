        "text": "Riots erupted Friday evening for a third night in the United Kingdom, linked to a mass stabbing earlier in the week that killed three young girls.\n\nSeveral hundred people rampaged in Sunderland's city center, in northeast England, attacking police and setting fire to buildings and vehicles.\n\nBroadcaster Sky News reported that around 30 other protests — mostly organized by far-right groups — were planned across the UK this weekend. Several anti-racism counterprotests are also expected.\n\nHow did the violence in Sunderland unfold?\n\nAn anti-immigrant protest began around 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC/GMT) in Sunderland's Keel Square, to the north of the city center, under the title Enough is Enough.\n\nThe Sunderland Echo newspaper described how crowds of demonstrators, many wearing balaclavas, waved England flags as they set off on their march, which quickly got out of hand.\n\nDuring the subsequent riots, a police station was set on fire and an overturned car was set ablaze.\n\nYouths threw bricks and other missiles at officers as fireworks and flares were let off, local media reported.\n\nAround the same time, a stand-off unfolded between police and protesters outside a nearby mosque.\n\nSome of the crowd shouted insults about Islam, while others chanted in support of Tommy Robinson, a far-right, anti-Islam campaigner and activist, local media reported.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles, adding\n\nthat they were guilty of \"an act of sacrilege.\"\n\nEight people were arrested for offenses such as violent disorder and burglary and three police officers were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries.\n\nSunderland Central MP Lewis Atkinson said a link could be drawn between the disorder and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded in 2009 by Robinson, but has since disbanded. The EDL's supporters remain active.\n\nA similar anti-immigration protest and counterdemonstration took place in the northwestern English city of Liverpool, near one of the city's mosques. Liverpool lies close to Southport, where Monday's stabbings took place.\n\nThe UK Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Yvette Cooper vowed the rioters would \"pay the price for their violence and thuggery,\" and called on the police to \"take the strongest possible action and ensure they face the full force of the law.\"\n\nSouthport mass stabbing sparked several nights of riots\n\nThe Sunderland riots marked a third night of violence in response to Monday's mass stabbing at a dance studio in Southport, a seaside town in northwest England.\n\nThree children were killed in the knife attack, and ten other people – eight of whom were children – were injured.\n\nA 17-year-old boy has been charged with several offenses, including the girls' murder, which happened during a Taylor Swift-themed workshop.\n\nSince the Southport attack, far-right social media channels have been awash with false claims that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\n\nPolice have emphasized that the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain.\n\nHe was remanded to a youth detention center and will next appear in court in October.\n\nViolent incidents erupted in the following days in Southport, the northeastern town of Hartlepool, and London in reaction to the killings.\n\nOn Friday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who took office less than a month ago, paid a second visit to Southport to meet with local leaders.\n\nStarmer has promised a new \"national\" response to the disorder, linking police forces across the country through shared intelligence and the expanded use of facial recognition.\n\nSecurity stepped up in case of weekend violence\n\nPolice forces nationwide said they were prepared for more far-right rallies and counterdemonstrations over the weekend.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said it had a \"proportionate and risk-based\" plan as pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests were held in the UK capital.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said a dispersal notice had been authorized for the city center to deal with planned demonstrations on Saturday.\n\nAround 150 people carrying St George's flags shouting, \"You're not English anymore\" and \"pedo Muslims off our street\" were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counterprotesters shouting \"Nazi scum off our streets.\"\n\nPolice in Southport said they had \"extensive plans and considerable police resources\" on hand to deal with any disorder this weekend.\n\nPolice also mounted a significant security operation in Belfast city center, after a small group of anti-Islamic protesters gathered at the front of City Hall, chanting \"Islam Out.\"\n\nMosques across the country have also been put on an increased state of alert, the Muslim Council of Britain said.\n\nmm/rmt (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"
