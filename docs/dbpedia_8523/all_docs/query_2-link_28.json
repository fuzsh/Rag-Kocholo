        "text": "While you’re here, you can take part in our many Attractions; ride on a horse drawn wagon, fire the mighty potato cannons, pick out your own Halloween pumpkin, and stay for lunch at the Corn Cafe, serving farm fresh food all day.\n\nYoung kids will delight in our larger-than-life playground featuring a giant double drain-tube slide, a jump pad, tractor tire jungle gym, and giant games! Older kids (and adults!) can enjoy a race around the track in our pedal carts at Dave’s Derby. And folks love to check out the view of the maze from the perspective of our giant walk-in camera obscura!\n\nVisitors to Mike’s Maze will encounter activities, games, and amusements to entertain the entire family. Located on a working farm at the foot of Mount Sugarloaf, visitors enjoy gorgeous views of the New England foliage.\n\nEvery year we concoct a brand new maze, along with themed games that will challenge you to solve puzzles and problems, and lead you on your exploration through the corn! Be prepared to laugh and learn as you wander the 8-acre maze, encountering installations and trivia at every turn!\n\nThe idea for Mike’s Maze was born at a Christmas party almost twenty years ago when two friends, farmer Mike Wissemann (pictured here with his son, David) and artist Will Sillin, decided to combine talents and create corn art.\n\nWill designed the inaugural maze and fashioned it using a rented ATV and a GPS. After the first year was a success, they decided to make each maze bigger and more detailed than the last.\n\nWill developed a precise strategy to perfect his corn art by creating a grid system and removing individual stalks of corn for greater detail and precision.\n\nAfter a decade and a half of making his world famous art in corn at Mike’s Maze, and designing creative games to pair with them, Will stepped down as our Resident Corn Artist after the 2014 season in order to spend more time exploring his other areas of artistic interest."
