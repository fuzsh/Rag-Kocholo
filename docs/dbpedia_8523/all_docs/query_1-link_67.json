        "text": "Bruce Odes David Holden, 50, of Dumas, passed away on Thursday, January 6, 2022, in Live Oak, TX. Funeral services are scheduled for 2 oâ€™clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, January 11, 2022, at Bible Baptist Church in Dumas with Rev. Johnny Widener, pastor of the church officiating. Interment will follow in Dumas Cemetery. Arrangements are entrusted with Beeson-Morrison Funeral Directors.\n\nBruce was born June 27, 1971, in Joplin, MO, to John and Janie (Rush) Holden. He worked for Wal-Mart for over 20 years, becoming manager of the Dumas store in 2019. Bruce made sure there was coffee by always being the first in the office and usually the last one to leave. He was a staunch supporter of the Dumas Demons, especially the band where his daughter Victoria played percussion. Bruce had several passions in his life including watching WWE Monday Night Wrestling with his companion dog, Toby and was well known for his love of bright colored shoes. He was of the Baptist faith and had just earned his degree in ministry from Grand Canyon University. Bruce was a loving father, uncle and friend and he will be dearly missed by all who knew him.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his grandparents, his father John and a sister, Brandi.\n\nBruce is survived by his mother: Janie Erb of Dumas, TX; his daughters: Victoria Holden of Dumas, TX and Natasha Pequignot and daughter Chloe of Hiram, OH; brother: John Holden and wife Ann of Joplin, MO; sister: Jody Jensen and husband Brad of Springfield, MO; and many numerous other family and friends."
