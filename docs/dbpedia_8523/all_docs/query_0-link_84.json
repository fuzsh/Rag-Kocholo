        "text": "This was not, actually, a trial match, as such, but it was one of the earliest representative association football matches, coming just four weeks after the second unofficial international between England and a 'Scottish' team, on the same ground ('The Oval'). It was just a logical step to split the country into two sections to face off against each other, though it would be another ten years before the fixture would take off as an annual trial match. The game was the suggestion of Charles Alcock, the secretary of the Football Association, who had organised the unofficial internationals and was keen to further the FA's influence in the north. Alcock, himself, had been born in Sunderland and was in the North's team, along with the future Lord Kinnaird, who was to play for Scotland against England in the second official international, at The Oval in 1873. The North's goalkeeper, James Kirkpatrick, who had helped to recruit players to face England in the unofficial games, played under the pseudonym of 'A.Scott'.Next unofficial international: v. Scotland (25 February 1871 at Kennington) 1-1Baker, Betts, Crake, Lubbock, Stephenson, Vidal and Walker from The South, plus Alcock and Hooman from The North, played for England.Hogg, Kinnaird, Kirkpatrick and Nepean from The North, plus Chappell from The South, played for 'Scotland'. The return fixture between amateurs and professionals was held at 'The Oval' as part of a charity festival in aid of London's hospitals. It was attended by the Prince of Wales and was preceded by a rugby match in which a London team defeated a combined London Scottish and Welsh side. The Gentlemen were all well-known internationals, apart from Brann, who would make his England debut, seven days later, and they looked like they would triumph again after Cobbold, once more, gave them the lead. The Players only had one survivor from the game at Preston, two months earlier (James Costley), but they introduced six Scots and were captained by Fergus Suter, the first recognised professional. More than half of the team were from Preston North End, and their familiarity told in the second half.\n\nNext international: v. Scotland (27 March 1886 at Glasgow) 1-1Bailey, Bambridge, Brann, Cobbold, Lindley, Squire, Arthur Walters and Percy Walters from the Gentlemen, played for England (Dewhurst was in the original selection). With the Players fielding five Scots and a Welsh goalkeeper, they came from behind twice to record a second successive victory in their third meeting of 1886. Whether it was the realisation that the English 'Gentlemen' could no longer compete with the best British professionals is unclear, but it was felt that a club match between Corinthians and Preston North End would be a more appropriate test of the two classes of competitors and these teams were invited instead to compete at 'The Oval', three months later, in The Queen's Golden Jubilee Festival (they drew 1-1, though Preston included an amateur, Fred Dewhurst, in their side). The sequence of representative games was shelved, but it would not be the last time that select teams of amateurs and professionals would face off against each other.\n\nNext international: v. Ireland (5 February 1887 at Sheffield) 7-0Haworth from the Players, plus Arthur, Bambridge, Cobbold, Dewhurst, Lindley and Sayer from the Gentlemen, played for England (Amos, Davenport, Goodall and Lofthouse were reserves). Four weeks before the trial, a preliminary trial match was staged between the Professionals of the South and the Amateurs of the South at White Hart Lane, in an effort to pick the best possible southern-based players from both classes to face The North. The good form of the Corinthians had given the Football Association renewed hope that the amateur game could still be a match for the professionals. It ended 1-1 and eight players (three of them amateurs) earned their place in The South's line-up against The North, as Bristol City hosted the fixture for the first time, but only Stanley Harris from the pre-trial impressed enough to win a full cap. It was a fourth successive away win for The North.Next international:v. Ireland (25 February 1905 at Middlesbrough) 1-1Stanley Harris and Woodward from The South, plus Bloomer, Bond, Booth, Leake, Roberts, Williamson and Wolstenholme from The North, played for England (Bluff and Bridgett (replacing Brearley) were reserves). Issues of nationality were the focus when the selections for this trial match were announced. Millwall's James Jeffrey had to be dropped from the Stripes when the FA discovered that he was Scottish. He was immediately replaced by Tony Whitson. Meanwhile, Robert Evans was selected for the Whites despite having already won ten caps for Wales, including four times against England. Much to the consternation of the FA of Wales, who had selected him to play against Ireland in Belfast five days after the trial match, the Football Association discovered that Evans had been born in Chester and was three weeks old when his Welsh parents moved him over the border into Wales. Purely because of his birthplace, the FA, as was their right, claimed him as one of their own. He was carried off injured in the trial, but went on to score on his England debut and made four appearances for them. Although the Whites were convincing winners, with Harold Fleming making up for his penalty miss of the previous year, Jock Simpson (born in England of Scottish parents) was the man of the match, creating numerous opportunities for the Stripes that were simply not taken. He had been impressing for Falkirk in the Scottish First Division, but signed for Blackburn Rovers after the game.Next international:v. Ireland (11 February 1911 at Belfast) 2-1Evans, Fleming, Pennington, Shepherd, Warren, Wedlock and Williamson from the Whites, plus Simpson and Sturgess from the Stripes, played for England. In the Football Association's Golden Jubilee year, it was decided to use the Charity Shield to revive a meeting between professionals and amateurs, rather than invite the League Champions, Sunderland to face the Southern League Champions, Plymouth Argyle, as was customary, due to the unsportsmanlike behaviours seen in Sunderland's FA Cup Final defeat against Aston Villa. It was, effectively, a clash between the FA's two national teams, but the intention to play the same England team that had defeated Scotland, six months earlier, to win the British Championship, was scuppered when three players had to withdraw. However, the difference between the classes was painfully evident as the Professionals scored almost at will. Eight days later, the worst mining disaster in British history killed 440 men at Senghenydd, near Caerphilly, and the FA donated the proceeds from the Charity Shield to the disaster fund.\n\nNext amateur international:v. Ireland (8 November 1913 at Belfast) 2-0Barlow, Brebner, Burn, Dines, Farnfield, Knight, Peacock and Woodward played for England (Sharpe was in the original selection). The success of The North team in the previous trial match had prompted the selectors to choose seven of the team that had beaten The South, with two injured (Chedgzoy and Seddon), and the captain and goalkeeper restored. Illness and an FA Cup replay denied them Cresswell and Seymour, with Chedgzoy's replacement, Butler, also injured, proving once again that the timing of these trial matches on a Monday was not ideal. Another injury was sustained by Frank Moss, who, after scoring the only goal, went off with a twisted knee, five minutes into the second half.\n\n(Barton, Bradford, Jack, Stephenson and Wadsworth played for England in the second trial after playing for The North in the first, whilst Sewell played for The Rest in the second trial after playing for the North in the first, and Elkes and Meehan played for The Rest in the second trial after playing for The South in the first).\n\nNext international:v. Wales (3 March 1924 at Blackburn) 1-2 Barton, Jack, Smart, Stephenson, Tunstall and Wilson from England, plus Kean and Sewell from The North, and Mort and Roberts from The Rest, played for England (Bromilow and Chambers were reserves, Wadsworth was in the original selection). An amateur representative side had only ever beaten a professional select in their very first meeting in 1886, but they lifted the Shield for the first time with an astonishing annihilation of their opponents. They were not facing as strong a professional line-up as for the two previous meetings, however, as the side was restricted to the squad that had toured Australia in the close season, though they had played together many times and four of them had full international caps. The Amateurs lost their captain to injury before the game and the first half was a close contest, but it was the Amateurs who used the new offside law to better effect. Ernie Simms was a limping passenger after twenty minutes and didn't appear for the second half which was two minutes old when Baker saved a penalty from Stan Seymour. The match was over as a contest from this point, with the Amateurs scoring four more goals before their opponents could manage a single consolation.Next international:v. Ireland (24 October 1925 at Belfast) 0-0Armitage, Ashton and Baker from the Amateurs, played for England.Next amateur international:v. Ireland (7 November 1925 at Maidstone) 6-4Armitage, Ashton, Baker, Bellamy, Bower, Bryant, Caesar, Kail, Macey and Twine played for England. The Amateurs retained the Shield with another six-goal beating and this time gave the Professionals a two-goal start. Once again, it was the Amateurs that finished much the stronger side, now against a team with five full internationals, four of whom were in the forward line. As in the previous year, the Professionals were restricted to the members of a touring squad that had spent their close season playing together, this time in Canada. Though it was an entertaining contest, the attendance was very poor and the Amateurs were denied the chance to go for the hat-trick, a year later, when the FA decided to invite club sides again.\n\nNext amateur international:v. Ireland (6 November 1926 at Belfast) 3-0Bellamy, Cartlidge, Gates, Kail, Macey and Twine played for England. For the first time ever, an England trial team was unchanged and they were the first to score eight goals, though a large part was due to the incredible goal machine that was Bill Dean, who had now scored fourteen goals in just four trial matches. He went on to set an all-time record of sixty top-flight goals that no one has come anywhere near to challenging since, giving him a grand total of 71 goals for club and country in all competitions in the 1927-28 season. Despite the success of the trial selection, only six of the team played in the next international, where they were humiliated by their biggest rivals.\n\nNext international:v. Scotland (31 March 1928 at Wembley) 1-5Dean, Edwards, Goodall, Hulme, Kelly and Smith from England, plus Healless and Hufton from The Rest, played for England (Bishop was in the original selection). England managed to avoid defeat for the first time in four years, impressing the selectors enough for them to use almost the same side against Scotland, but not a great decision, in hindsight. This was, not only, an international trial, but also a trial for a game of two referees, one in each half of the field. However, it was also a game with no controversial incidents, so the officials were not given a strong test. A further trial dispensed with linesmen, but the system was not popular with referees and was never implemented.\n\nNext international:v. Scotland (6 April 1935 at Glasgow) 0-2Barker, Bastin, Britton, Geldard, Hapgood, Hibbs, Male and Westwood from England, plus Alsford, Brook and Gurney from The Rest, played for England (Carter and Gardner were reserves, Bray was in the original selection). England were originally due to face 'The Rest', as per usual, but the Football Association then decided to change their approach. None of the 22 players selected could assume that they were first choices and none of the team that had lost at home to Wales in the previous month, were selected. 'Ginger' Richardson caught the eye with a second-half hat-trick, but it wasn't enough, and nor were his 43 goals scored during the 1935-36 season, to earn him a place at Wembley. The Manchester Guardian, sensing that the match would have little or no bearing on the upcoming international and that the selectors already knew their preferred line-up, re-named it as the \"Mainly Improbables\" versus the \"Very Unlikelies\". They were spot on in their assessment, as England would have been unchanged against Scotland, but for three injuries, and even then, their replacements were not participants in the trial match, prompting the Guardian to proclaim that it must have been \"the FA's little jest!\".Next international:v. Scotland (4 April 1936 at Wembley) 1-1Dawes and Willingham from the Probables were reserves. With the players again \"enormously numbered\", in the third successive trial match to be played in Lancashire, this was to be the last of these annual fixtures, although a live second-half commentary was broadcast on the radio. It had been switched to the beginning of the international season, but the Football League's victory against the Irish League, a week earlier, had seemingly provided the selectors with all that they needed to know, rendering the official trial, once again, barely relevant. Indeed, they left their seats, ten minutes before the end, and announced their international selection just fifteen minutes after the final whistle. Next international:v. Ireland (23 October 1937 at Belfast) 5-1Barkas, Brook, Geldard, Goulden, Hall, Sproston and Woodley from the Probables, plus Copping, Crayston and Cullis from the Possibles, played for England (Scott and Smith were reserves, Young was in the original selection). The football authorities were quick to react to the declaration of war in September 1939 and suspended all competitions, mindful of the criticism that they had received for playing a full league season in 1914-15, but with little actual combat occurring in the first eight months (what became known as the 'Phoney War'), football resumed with revised wartime regional leagues. Hundreds of players had joined the Army and were only allowed to play football when their service commitments would allow, but the Football Association arranged a number of representative games in aid of the Red Cross Fund and there were two initial meetings between FA select teams and the Army, at Aldershot and Reading in the autumn. By the beginning of 1940, and with two wartime internationals already played, they had enough available strength to stage what was, effectively, a wartime trial match. It was the first representative match to be held in London during the war. There was a live second-half commentary on the radio and there were no crowd restrictions, but the attendance was disappointing. It was an entertaining spectacle, however, with Jackie Martin giving England a two-goal lead in the first ten minutes, before the Army came back to lead 3-2, five minutes before the interval, but just two minutes after half-time, Matthews scored the winner for England. The Army included a South African goalkeeper and two Scots (Beattie and Fagan).Next wartime international:v. Wales (13 April 1940 at Wembley) 0-1Bacuzzi, Bartram, Copping, Goulden, Hapgood, Matthews and Willingham from England, plus Compton and Cullis from the Army, played for England (Mercer was in the original selection).\n\nAll of the England team played for England in wartime internationals, as did all of the English players in the Army team, with the exception of Geldard, who was a full international. Harry Goslin was killed in action in Italy in December 1943. The Football Association continued to arrange international and representative games throughout the war in aid of war charities, but England only played against Scotland and Wales, with other selections badged as 'FA XI' or 'The Army in England' and consisting of various strengths according to the conditions of the time. Towards the end of the 1943-44 season, England beat Scotland, 3-2 at Hampden and, a week later, staged a trial match for the selectors to choose their team for the following week's final match of the season. It was held in aid of service charities and all 22 players were in either the Army or the Royal Air Force. Nine of the England team were from the Army and they made four changes from the previous week (Britton, Ditchburn, Elliott and Rowley coming into the side, with Carter and Swift moving to the Combined Services, and Matthews and Soo left out). There were three Scots in the Combined Services team (Busby, Macaulay and Strauss).Next wartime international:v. Wales (6 May 1944 at Cardiff) 2-0Britton, Compton, Cullis, Ditchburn, Elliott, Lawton, Mercer, Rowley and Smith from England, plus Carter and Scott from the Combined Services, played for England (Hagan was a reserve).\n\nAll of the England team, plus Carter, Oakes, Scott and Swift from the Combined Services, played for England in wartime internationals (though Drake was a full international). In the first peacetime season, things were not quite back to normal as players were still in the armed forces and the leagues were still played on a regional basis. A British International Victory Championship was held and a week prior to the deciding match, the grand setting of Wembley Stadium was used for a trial match. Sadly, a spate of withdrawals due to injuries and club commitments at the business end of the season, devalued the game somewhat and the attendance was poor, though it was an entertaining game. Nevertheless, as a trial it was fairly irrelevant. The following week's team line-up was announced at half-time. The Army team included Preston North End's Scottish international, Andy Beattie, no stranger to wartime representative matches, but his last game for his country had been four years earlier.Next victory international:v. Scotland (13 April 1946 at Glasgow) 0-1Elliott, Franklin, Hardwick, Scott and Shackleton from the FA, plus Compton, Hagan, Lawton, Mercer, Swift and Wright from the Army PT Corps, played for England (Soo and Stubbins were reserves, Matthews was in the original selection).\n\nAll of the players selected for the FA XI (with the exception of Reg Williams) played for England either in wartime, victory, charity or full internationals, as did all of the English players selected for the Army PT Corps, except Allen, Cater and Wardle. Proceeds from this evening match went to ex-England international, Willie Hall, who scored five goals in half an hour against Ireland in 1938, but had had his right leg amputated below the knee, due to thrombosis. He would lose his other lower leg in the following year. The Combined team was selected by Nottingham Forest manager and former England international, Billy Walker and was comprised mostly of players from Midlands clubs, with Scotsman, Tom Johnston, one of three players from the second-division host club (Brown would have been a fourth). Hall was from Newark-on-Trent and began his career at Notts County. England were ten days away from their first full international for seven years.\n\nNext international:v. Ireland (28 September 1946 at Belfast) 7-2Carter, Hardwick, Finney, Lawton, Mannion, Scott, Swift and Wright from the FA, played for England (Hancocks and Shimwell from the Combined team were reserves, Matthews was in the original selection).\n\nJohnson and Stubbins had played for England in victory internationals, but Forrest never represented his country. Brown had played for England in wartime and victory internationals. On three separate occasions in the 1920s, the Football Association had used the Charity Shield to reward players that had played for them on summer tours. In 1950, they decided to arrange a meeting between two separate touring squads; one which had represented England in their first World Cup, in Brazil, and the other, an FA squad that had visited Canada and the United States, in the month before the World Cup. Hughes was stretchered off with a twisted knee after fifteen minutes and he was substituted by Taylor, who was in both squads, but did not play in the World Cup. The only man to play for both squads was Matthews, who was in the tour team, whose captain, Flewin had played for England in a wartime international in 1944.\n\nNext international:v. Ireland (7 October 1950 at Belfast) 4-1 Baily, Dickinson, Mannion, Ramsey, Williams and Wright from the World Cup team, plus Matthews from the tour team, played for England (Eckersley and Finney were in the original selection). The appointment of Walter Winterbottom as the FA's National Director of Coaching was beginning to have an impact with the introduction of an England Under-23 team at the beginning of the year in a friendly against Italy in Bologna, and it was to be the catalyst for a new era of annual trial matches. With England's second World Cup appearance coming up in Switzerland at the end of the season, and Hungary having recently shown how far superior they were against England's old-style football, a squad of 32 players was chosen as to be \"in the forefront of consideration for one or other of the tours\" scheduled for the full international squad and a B squad, prior to the tournament. In addition to this, curiously, was the trial match in which the Under-23s (styled as 'Young England') would face an England team comprised of players that were all, at least, thirty years of age (Bartram was forty) and none of whom had been included in the squad of 32, though four of the selected Young England team were (Byrne, Hooper, Pilkington and Taylor). Only two of the England team (Matthews and Shackleton) would play in a full international again. It was intended that Arsenal's Joe Mercer would captain England at Highbury in his last match before retirement, but he sustained a double fracture of his right leg, three weeks earlier, on the same ground and had to miss the occasion. It was played on the eve of the FA Cup Final and staged in London so that fans arriving a day early for the Wembley showpiece could take in this extra game with the intriguing prospect of seeing a team of legends taking on the best of young talent, as well as it being a great test for the potential future stars. The plan was a huge success, with the biggest crowd ever seen at an international trial and they saw the ageing stars outshine their young counterparts with a skilful display.FA Cup finalists unavailable: Tom Finney and George Thompson of Preston North End, and Ronnie Allen, Ray Barlow, Jimmy Dugdale and Johnny Nicholls of West Bromwich Albion (though only Finney for England, and Dugdale and Nicholls for Young England, would have been eligible for the trial match because of their age). Next international: v. Yugoslavia (16 May 1954 at Belgrade) 0-1 Byrne from Young England, played for England. Next B international: v. Yugoslavia (16 May 1954 at Ljubljana) 1-2 Hooper and Quixall from Young England, played for England (Edwards was a reserve).\n\nBartram had played for England in wartime internationals. Byrne and Hines were 23 at the start of the season, but were not eligible to play for the Under-23s in Italy, and Byrne, Quixall and Taylor were already full internationals. The success of the previous year's fixture prompted the Football Association to stage another meeting between players over thirty years of age and those under 23, at Highbury on the eve of the Cup Final. They had already selected 17 players for a continental tour, including Dickinson (who was not in the original selection for the Highbury game) and Matthews (now aged forty), who were the only still-active international players in the over-thirties line-up. Four of the team had played their last full international in the 6-3 humiliation by Hungary at Wembley, 18 months earlier. Eckersley and Baily (who was not in the original selection) were actually 29 years old. Six of the Young England players were in the full-international squad for the tour, and Blunstone, Haynes and Quixall had already won full caps. For the second year in a row, Hines was a late replacement and he was now 24 years old. Frank Swift, at 41, came out of retirement to play in goal for England, six years after his last league game, and he admirably kept a clean sheet for 55 minutes after pulling a muscle in the early stages. His replacement was Arsenal's 25-year-old Welsh international goalkeeper, Jack Kelsey, who kept his goal intact as the more experienced stars overwhelmed their younger opponents.FA Cup finalists unavailable: Jimmy Meadows and Don Revie of Manchester City, and Jackie Milburn of Newcastle United (though only Milburn, at thirty years old, would have been eligible for the trial match because of his age). Next international: v. France (15 May 1955 at Paris) 0-1 Matthews from England, plus Blunstone, Flowers and Sillett from Young England, played for England (Hooper, Reg Matthews and Quixall were reserves). The fixture had not been played on the eve of the previous year's FA Cup Final, with the England squad preparing for a showpiece game with Brazil at Wembley, and a London select team taking on Basel in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in north London at Tottenham. Earlier that season, however, in September 1955, the Under-23s had played a behind-closed-doors floodlit practice match at Tottenham against an England team that was not age-restricted and held them to a 2-2 draw. For the return of the fixture and, what was to be, the last appearance of an over-thirties team, Stan Matthews was now the grand old age of 42 but, together with Finney, Lofthouse and Wright, had not yet ended his international career. England had three World Cup qualifying matches later that month and the FA had named a squad that included Haynes (who was already a full international) and Stevens from the Young England team, with Clough and Norman as reserves. Groves was now 24, but had been 23 at the start of the season. Young England beat the elder statesmen for the first time and they were watched on television, as well as the crowd at Highbury, although their goals were scored before the live broadcast.TV Coverage: Second half live on BBC (commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards, David Pegg and Tommy Taylor of Manchester United (though only Edwards and Pegg would have been eligible for the trial match because of their age). Next international: v. Republic of Ireland (8 May 1957 at Wembley) 5-1 (World Cup Qualifying) Finney, Matthews and Wright from England, plus Haynes from Young England, played for England (Lofthouse and Stevens were reserves). Next under-23 international: v. Bulgaria B (19 May 1957 at Sofia) 1-2 A'Court, Anderson, Armfield, Bloomfield, Clough, Douglas, Hopkinson, Neal, Shaw and Smith from Young England, played for England (Norman was a reserve). With the World Cup in Sweden, the following month, and England reeling from the tragic losses of Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards and Tommy Taylor, together with the other twenty people that perished in the Munich air disaster, three months earlier, the Football Association decided to dispense with the over-thirties team and let the full international side (less the following day's FA Cup finalists) take on a \"past and present\" Young England. Three players were over the age of 23 (Broadbent, 24, Hall, 28 and Sillett, 25). Six of the eleven had full caps and all were included in the initial World Cup squad of forty players (Clough, Hall and Hayes failed to make the final 22-man squad, as did Langley from the England team). Chelsea hosted the match for the first time. England held the edge with their experience, but it wasn't a convincing performance.TV Coverage: Second half live on BBC (commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Tommy Banks, Eddie Hopkinson, Nat Lofthouse and Ray Parry of Bolton Wanderers, and Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet of Manchester United (Charlton, Hopkinson and Parry were still eligible for the Under-23s). Next international: v. Portugal (7 May 1958 at Wembley) 2-1 Clayton, Douglas, Finney, Haynes, Howe, Kevan, Langley, Slater and Wright from England, played for England (McDonald and Robson, and Norman from Young England, were reserves). The annual fixture returned to Highbury and with tours coming up for both squads, Young England reverted back to a fully Under-23 team (albeit with four players unable to play after the end-of-season tour, due to having reached 23 years of age). Brabrook and McGuinness (who was brought in as a replacement) had already won full caps, whilst Armfield, Greaves and McGuinness had been selected for the full squad's tour of the Americas. It was a lively encounter with England racing into a three-goal lead, but Young England (wearing borrowed Arsenal shirts in the second half) fought back and almost pulled off a famous victory.TV Coverage: Last 35 minutes live on BBC (commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Ron Baynham and Dave Pacey of Luton Town (Pacey was still eligible for the Under-23s). Next international: v. Italy (6 May 1959 at Wembley) 2-2 England were unchanged. Next under-23 international: v. Italy (7 May 1959 at Milan) 3-0 England were unchanged from the original Young England selection, with Setters replacing McGuinness. To celebrate the Football Association's centenary year, and the Football League's 75th anniversary, the annual fixture played on the eve of the FA Cup Final was changed to allow two teams representing each organisation to play one another. Due to the fixture congestion caused by an extremely harsh winter, the Cup Final had been put back three weeks, but Alf Ramsey was now England's manager and oversaw a rare meeting between 22 English players without age restriction. Five of the league's team had won full caps and six had been named in the squad for England's upcoming central-European tour, but obviously, the league was weakened by their best English players being on the opposite side and no Scottish, Irish or Welsh players included. Nevertheless, they gave a good account of themselves and were good value in a six-goal thriller.TV Coverage: Second half live on ITV (commentator Gerry Loftus).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Gordon Banks and Graham Cross of Leicester City, and Bobby Charlton and David Gaskell of Manchester United. Next international: v. Czechoslovakia (29 May 1963 at Bratislava) 4-2 Eastham, Greaves, Milne, Moore, Norman, Smith and Wilson from England, plus Paine and Shellito from the Football League, played for England (Byrne, Flowers, Hunt, Kay, Melia and Springett were reserves, Armfield was in the original selection). Next under-23 international: v. Yugoslavia (29 May 1963 at Belgrade) 4-2 Hinton from England, plus Bonetti, Labone and Dobson (as a substitute) from the Football League, played for England. After a year's absence, Young England returned to face their seniors, with two of the side (Tambling and Thomson) having previously been capped at full-international level. Three of the selected line-up (Pickering, Thompson and Thomson) had been selected for the upcoming tour from which they would each return with full caps. The game was closer than the scoreline suggested, with England's superior finishing making the difference. Alf Ramsey also had the luxury of the Football League team to try out fringe members of his squad and selected five of the England team (plus Mullery, with two in reserve) and three from the Young England team to face the Italian League in Milan, nine days later, a game which they lost by the only goal.TV Coverage: Second half live on BBC1 (commentators Kenneth Wolstenholme and Walley Barnes).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Dave Wilson of Preston North End, and Johnny Byrne, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore of West Ham United (Hurst, Moore and Wilson were still eligible for the Under-23s). Next international: v. Uruguay (6 May 1964 at Wembley) 2-1 Banks, Charlton, Cohen, Eastham, Greaves, Milne, Norman, Paine and Wilson from England, played for England (Flowers, and Thompson from Young England, were reserves). Next under-23 international: v. Hungary (13 May 1964 at Budapest) 1-2 Badger, Bailey, Bonetti, Chivers, Cross, Talbut, Tambling and Venables from Young England, played for England (Deakin was a reserve). Once again, Tambling and Thomson were the only Young England players that had been previously capped at full international level, but Ball and Jones had been the only members of the side to earn a place in England's full-international squad to tour Europe. The youngsters nearly pulled off only their second victory in their tenth appearance in the fixture, but they were pegged back at the end in a largely uninspiring game.FA Cup finalists unavailable: Jack Charlton, Norman Hunter and Paul Reaney of Leeds United, and Ian Callaghan, Tommy Smith and Peter Thompson of Liverpool (all but Charlton were still eligible for the Under-23s). Next international: v. Hungary (5 May 1965 at Wembley) 1-0 Banks, Bridges, Cohen, Connelly, Eastham, Greaves, Moore, Paine, Stiles and Wilson from England, played for England (Ball from Young England was a reserve, Bobby Charlton was in the original selection).

West Germany (25 May 1965 at Freiburg) 0-1 Stiles from England, plus Armstrong, Ball, Jones, Mobley, Murray, Thomson and West from Young England, played for England (Badger, Hollins and Tambling were reserves). Despite only one of the Young England side (captain, Bobby Thomson) being a full international, the world champions were torn apart by the pretenders to their throne. Rodney Marsh of Third Division Champions, Queen's Park Rangers, in particular, impressed as he waltzed through the England defence, beating four men in a mazy dribble before dispatching the ball in the back of the net to complete the humiliation of their illustrious opponents, in front of the lowest crowd recorded for the fixture. Yet, Marsh was one of only three members of the team to subsequently win full caps.TV Coverage: Highlights on BBC1 (commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme).FA Cup finalists unavailable: Peter Bonetti and John Hollins of Chelsea, and Jimmy Greaves, Cyril Knowles and Alan Mullery of Tottenham Hotspur (Hollins and Knowles were still eligible for the Under-23s).

A poor game brought this meaningless fixture to an end after 15 years. Young England had remained unbeaten in the last five encounters, but with squads already announced for the British Championship and subsequent tours, the world champions, once again, only provided a token half-hearted opposition. Everton initially threw the original team selections into chaos by re-claiming their six players for a league game at Nottingham Forest on the same night, but by kick-off time, another ten players had withdrawn, and only nine players remained from the original 22 selected. Young England had to draft in 24-year-old, John Charles as the final replacement. Their youngest player, at 21, was Roy McFarland and no teenagers were selected at any point. Hollins, himself a replacement, and made captain, was again the only member of the Young England team with a full international cap. Bryan Robson hit the post from a penalty in the third minute, but the first goalless draw in the fixture was its final death knell. Twelve months later, it was replaced by a third place play-off for the FA Cup.FA Cup finalists unavailable: Allan Clarke, David Nish and Peter Shilton of Leicester City, and Colin Bell, Mike Doyle, Francis Lee and Glyn Pardoe of Manchester City (all but Lee were still eligible for the Under-23s). Next international: v. Northern Ireland (3 May 1969 at Belfast) 3-1 Ball, Hurst, Labone, McNab, Moore, Mullery, Newton and Peters from England, played for England (Astle, Cooper and West were reserves). Next under-23 international: v. Netherlands (22 May 1969 at Deventer) 1-2 Coates, Hughes, Hurst, McFarland, Radford, Royle, Sissons and Smith from Young England, played for England (Evans and Springett were reserves). The London Football Association celebrated its centenary with a match against Ron Greenwood's England, who were preparing for one of the most crucial World Cup qualifying matches in their history, following two successive failures to reach the finals. Arsenal manager, Terry Neill selected the London side, which included three England internationals and a Scottish international goalkeeper in the starting line-up. England included, as a late replacement, a London-based, uncapped player, Goddard, who scored their equaliser. They only had one substitute and Tony Morley, having been replaced at half-time, came back on to replace Coppell for the last few minutes. London took an early lead before Joe Corrigan saved Brian Talbot's penalty in the 23rd minute, but England recovered to lead 4-1 after an hour, before conceding two goals in the last ten minutes. Next international: v. Hungary (18 November 1981 at Wembley) 1-0 (World Cup Qualifying) Brooking from London, plus Coppell, Keegan, McDermott, Mills, Neal, Robson, Shilton, Thompson and Morley (as a substitute) from England, played for England (Clemence, Sansom, Wilkins and Withe were unused substitutes, Butcher, Corrigan, Goddard and Watson were reserves). The untimely death of England's Scottish coach, Bill Taylor, at the age of 42 had prompted a memorial match to be staged in tribute, at the home of Manchester City, where he had also been coach. Over £20,000 was raised for his wife and children. Ron Greenwood brought a strong side and the game was competitive with England setting out on a year in which they were to play in the World Cup finals for the first time since 1970. Leeds United's Trevor Cherry played as a guest for City, alongside three other full internationals. Alvin Martin was carried off with a broken collarbone, an injury that would eventually rule him out of a place in the World Cup squad. Next international: v. Northern Ireland (23 February 1982 at Wembley) 4-0 Francis from Manchester City, plus Anderson, Foster, Robson, Sansom and Wilkins from England, played for England (Brooking, Coppell, Corrigan and Shilton were also in the squad)."
