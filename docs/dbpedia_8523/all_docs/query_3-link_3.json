It is made up of the metropolitan districts of Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland. It borders the ceremonial counties of Northumberland and County Durham.\n\nCities and Large Towns\n\nThe following table shows the progress with mapping various cities and large towns in Tyne and Wear. See also Category:Cities in UK, Category:UK towns and Category:Users_in_Northumberland.\n\nPlease add a city or large town that you're interested in or tracking/mapping here. Try to keep the list ordered by Town Name. Where necessary create a sub page to try and keep this table quite succinct.\n\n%age complete Postal Area Town Name Position Tracks Mapped Labelled Notes Newcastle upon Tyne ?% ?% ?% Several user are active here.

It is fully mapped in OSM but there is more detail that can be added.\n\nThe Metro is operated by Nexus and Wikipedia has lots more info, including a map.\n\nThe majority of the line is above ground so it should be tagged railway=light_rail.\n\nMetro stations\n\nStations can be mapped as railway=station and station=light_rail. Add platforms (railway=platform and public_transport=platform and platform number), ticket machines (amenity=vending_machine and vending_machine=public_transport_tickets), footbridges/subways, footpath links to road network etc. Most stations have cycle parking so add amenity=bicycle_parking. Benches, litter bins, station buildings, shops etc too.\n\nAdd railway=subway_entrance at the entrances to the underground stations.\n\nMetro ventilation shafts"
