        "text": "Tickets\n\nOne of the best ways to get about on the Metro is to use a Pop Pay As You Go (PAYG) smart card. You simply top it up at stations and then pay for your journeys as you make them. Rates for single journeys on the PAYG card start atÂ Â£1.65 for one zone increasing to Â£2.00 for all 3 zones. You can also use your PAYG card on the buses and ferries.\n\nMetro single tickets are also valid on local rail services between Newcastle and Sunderland, and can also be used on the Shields Ferry. For one zone a single costs Â£2.30 and for all zones they cost Â£3.90.\n\nAnother option for tickets is to get a Metro Day Ticket, which will allow you unlimited travel for one day. For one zone The ticket costs Â£3.60, two zones for Â£4.70 and Â£5.70 for all zones.\n\nOperating Hours and Accessibility\n\nThe Tyne and Wear Metro runs from around 05:00 and 06:00am (between 06:00am and 7:00am on Sunday), with trains running till around midnight. Each line runs up to every 12 minutes during the day (Monday to Saturday), and up to every 15 minutes during the evening and on Sunday.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Tyne and Wear Metro is very accessible. The majority of Metro stations offer step-free access, voice announcements at each stop, and visual displays indicating the next stop. Several spacious wheelchair places are available on board; motorised mobility scooters are not, however, permitted on Metro stations or trains.\n\nIf you want to find out more information about accessibility on the Tyne and Wear Metro, or require any assistance while travelling, you can contact customer service by telephoning 0191 203 3666 (lines open 06:30am to midnight) or by emailingÂ assistance@nexus.org.uk. They ask that you contact them at least four hours in advance of travelling, so they can prepare anything you might need for your journey.\n\nAlternative Transport\n\nAs well as the Metro, Tyne and Wear is connected by a large network of bus routes throughout the region, which interlink together with other public transport services including regional rail and the ferry.\n\nWhile the Metro might stop operating around midnight, there is a late night bus service running on a smaller number of routes linking North East England’s main cities at weekends.\n\nAnother alternative to getting around the city is to hire a Neuron Mobility e-scooter. These electric scooters are a fun and environmentally friendly to get about Newcastle and can be hired using the Neuron app, which is available to download on the App Store and on Google Play.\n\nGetting from Newcastle International Airport (NCL)\n\nGetting to the city from Newcastle International Airport could not be easier thanks to the airport having a stop on the metro. All you need to do is follow these simple steps.\n\nOnce you have retrieved your baggage, follow signs in the airport for the metro station. The airport stop is on the green line which runs through the centre of town. You can transfer at any of the stops that are on both lines to reach other parts of Tyne and Wear.\n\nThe journey to Newcastle city centre (Haymarket, Monument or Central Station) takes around 25 minutes. There are trains every 12 minutes from approximately 5:39am (Sundays 6:26am) to 11:09pm.\n\nAlternatively, there is a taxi rank in the airport where you can catch a lift into the centre. This option is great especially if your landing late at night when the metro lines are not in operation. Whilst this option may be faster than the metro, it most certaintly is not cheaper. The cheapest possible taxi fare costs roughly Â£35.\n\nWeather in Tyne & Wear, UK\n\nIn Newcastle, summers are mild and temperate while the winters are short and cold. Newcastle is the most northerly city in England and therefore is naturally one of the coldest. That said, the UK is a relatively small island with a generally temperate climate and the difference across the whole country is usually only a couple of degrees.\n\nMonthly average temperautres\n\nJanuary 4Â°C (39Â°F) | February 4Â°CÂ (39Â°F) | March 6Â°CÂ (43Â°F) | April 8Â°CÂ (46Â°F) | May 11Â°CÂ (52Â°F) | June 14Â°CÂ (57Â°F) | July 16Â°CÂ (61Â°F) | August 16Â°CÂ (61Â°F) | September 14Â°CÂ (57Â°F) | October 11Â°CÂ (52Â°F) | November 7Â°CÂ (45Â°F) | December 5Â°CÂ (41Â°F)\n\nTipping\n\nItâs less common to tip in the UK than it is in other countries and in most cases tipping is done out of politeness. If you go to a restaurant, especially if there is a large number of you, there may be a gratuity charge added on top of your bill. If there is no gratuity charge you can tip 10% â 15% if you think the service was good. Tipping in bars, pubs and clubs isnât usually done unless youâre receiving table service."
