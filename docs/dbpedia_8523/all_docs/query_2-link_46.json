He also showed a keen interest in Ramshaw’s daughter, Margaret, who he would marry in 1835. Armstrong trained as a solicitor for five years but his career in law was short-lived and he pursued his interests in engineering, developing a rotary engine which he employed a friend to manufacture at a works in High Bridge, Newcastle. Further developments by Armstrong led to the manufacture of a piston engine and a hydraulic crane that proved a great success. He purchased land at Elswick to establish a business manufacturing hydraulic equipment and cranes. His customers included the docks at Liverpool and Grimsby. Armstrong turned his attention to making armaments at Elswick developing a breech loading gun (he would supply both sides in the American Civil War). Branching out into making naval guns necessitated the movement of ships up river to Elswick, bringing about the removal of the old stone-built Tyne Bridge which Armstrong replaced with the Swing Bridge in 1876. From 1835 Armstrong had resided in a house (since demolished) in Jesmond Dene but in 1863 he purchased land near Rothbury where the architect Richard Norman Shaw would develop the spectacular mansion of Cragside.
