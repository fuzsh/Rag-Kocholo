It offers visitors an unforgettable experience of the life and times of a man who became an international celebrity after the publication of his books.\n\nJames Herriot (real name James Alfred Wight) was born on 3rd October 1916 in Sunderland in the North East of England. When he was just three weeks old his parents moved to Glasgow where he grew up. He was an only child. His father James Henry Wight was a Ship Plater by trade but also an accomplished pianist and his mother, Hannah Bell, sang Contralto.\n\nAlf (James) went to Yoker Primary School and then onto Hillhead High School. When he was 12, Alf had his first dog, a red setter named Don and they were devoted to each other. It was also at this time that he read an article in the Meccano Magazine about being a vet and this set him on a path into the veterinary profession.\n\nIn 1933 Alf Wight went to Glasgow Veterinary College where he spent 6 years.
