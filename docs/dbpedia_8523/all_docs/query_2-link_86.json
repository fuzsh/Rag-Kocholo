Over the past month, many of us have been glued to our TV screens watching UEFA EURO 2024. England did well; Scotland, not so good! Individual allegiances set aside however, the tournament was a fascinating watch from the perspective of #teamwork. I've been a #teamplayer all my life; from my very first professional contract at Bristol City Football Club, to playing over 460 games in the EFL (English Football League) for The Robins, West Bromwich Albion Football Club, Blackpool Football Club, Tranmere Rovers FC, Burnley Football Club & Kidderminster Harriers Football Club, then managing Fleetwood Town FC, Tranmere Rovers FC, Barnsley FC, Shrewsbury Town FC, Dundee United Football Club and now Oldham Athletic (2004) Association Football Club Limited. As a #teamleader, I'm inspired by Helen Keller's famous quote: \"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\" This is especially true within the SEN & #alternativeprovision sector. For organisations like ours to be truly successful in our overall mission to create brilliant 16 year-olds, everybody - including our #pupils - must show real #togetherness and work as a team; almost like a family. With this in mind, this month's edition of 'Insite' focuses on #teamwork and the work we do as a group of #schools to help our young people - some of whom have #specialeducationalneeds, #semh (Social & Mental Health Difficulties), #autistic spectrum disorder, other #neurodiverse conditions such as #adhd & #dyslexia, or been affected by #childhoodtrauma - to develop academically, socially and emotionally and achieve their full potential. It also homes in on what a high-performing team should look like, referencing the 'Five Dysfunctions of a Team' model by US Business Writer, Patrick Lencioni as well as examining how our core value of 'togetherness' shapes our provision and the expectations we place on our young people. This month's 'Team Profiles' feature our Deputy Head of School at Oldham, Matthew Lawton, and our Head of School & Co-proprietor at Wigan, Stuart Howarth, a qualified science teacher who played over 100 Super League games for St.Helens R.F.C., Salford Red Devils Rugby League Club & Wakefield Trinity in his previous career as a full-time RL professional. Our CEO & Proprietor, James Lowe also contributes a piece on the value of recruiting former professional #sportspeople to the #classroom as #educators, and how their transferable skills, including #selfmotivation, #resilience and #leadership have a transformative effect on the lives and educational experience of our young people. Finally, as the Summer Olympics (International Olympic Committee – IOC) get underway this Friday in Paris, we thought we'd share the most perfect example of #teamwork in motion... GB's Coxless Fours winning Gold in Sydney in 2000. Inspiring stuff! Enjoy the read!\n\nWhether we like it or not, class is ingrained in every aspect of our lives, especially within the UK. From what school you went to, which sports you watch, and where you do your weekly shopping, people will tell you that it says a lot about your class and who you are. While these approaches often trivialise the topic, the reality is that class is a huge factor in both the world of education and the world of work. Some industries and institutions have created environments where those from disadvantaged backgrounds are refused entry. Thankfully, the conversation around social mobility and class is beginning to bear fruit, with networks such as The 93% Club flourishing. The 93% Club gives those who went to state schools the opportunity to interact and form relationships with academics and professionals whom they would otherwise never meet. Founder Sophie Pender isn’t looking to demolish the ‘who you know’ culture, though; she’s looking to democratise it. And she’s clearly having success in doing so, with The 93% Club having to freeze its registrations because of a huge influx of applications. If you’re interested in finding out more about Sophie and her work, head to the link in the comments below. #socialmobility #classism #edi\n\nIn the United States, the average amount of time a high school student will interact with their school counselor is 38 minutes over four years. In some areas of the country, that number can be as low as 12 minutes. That is not enough time. Regardless if students are athletes are not, they need to be taking advantage of the resources that their schools are providing, even if they don’t sound “fun” or “needed” at the time. Going to college can be a life-changing experience, both positively and negatively. It’s important to spend the proper amount of time focusing on the next step of life to make the right decision for you and your family. If you need additional support and resources, send us a message and we can help guide you in the right direction for your individual needs.

It is particularly significant in Wales where Saint David, a 6th century Welsh Bishop, is the Patron Saint. Often he is depicted with a white dove on his shoulder as according to legend a white dove landed on him when he was preaching in the tiny mid Wales village of Llandewi Brefi. Though its precise significance varies according to the prevailing religion and culture, the dove has a special significance in most cultures and is most commonly associated with love, peace and harmony. Hence on this special day in Wales it is particularly appropriate for the Harmonious Entrepreneurship Society to celebrate a Welsh venture that epitomises such characteristics, helping to transform lives and bring hope and peace to individuals, communities and the world. In so doing it addresses SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institution). 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure and 17 (Partnerships for the goals) as Felicity's case demonstrates) In the words of Saint David let us “Be joyful, keep the faith and do the little things you have heard and seen me do”. Have a happy St. David’s Day (Dydd Gwyl Dewi Hapus) #Entrepreneurship #Sustainability #Harmony #ICSB #ECSB #ISBE #EEUK #HEInnovate #UN #UNESCO #OECD"
