        "text": "WARNING: This article contains themes and images some readers may find distressing.\n\nAnti-immigration riots are causing havoc across the UK after social media posts falsely claimed the suspect of the Southport stabbing attack was a Muslim immigrant.\n\nThree girls, aged 6, 7 and 9, were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town of Southport on July 29. Eight children and two adults were also wounded.\n\nA 17-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a bladed article. Due to his age, his identity was suppressed.\n\nBut misinformation about the suspect's identity quickly began circulating online, naming him Ali-Al-Shakati and claiming he migrated to the UK by boat in 2023.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAnti-immigration rallies flare amid unrest over UK dance class stabbings\n\nOn Tuesday, members of the Southport community gathered for a vigil. However, as the evening progressed, a riot broke out.\n\nThe local mosque was damaged, and 53 police officers were injured in the violence.\n\nSince then, anti-immigration riots have swept across the nation, with more than 370 people arrested over the weekend.\n\nOn Thursday, the anonymity order was lifted in response to the unrest, and the suspect was identified as Axel Rudakubana.\n\nThe teenager was born in Cardiff, to Rwandan parents, and is not of the Islamic faith.\n\nHis misidentification has perpetuated \"harmful stereotypes and prejudices\" and provoked Islamophobia, according to the Executive Director of the Islamophobia Register Australia Dr Nora Amath.\n\n\"As a result, the Southport Mosque, as well as other mosques, have been vandalised and members of the Muslim community assaulted and abused. The Muslim and multicultural communities are left frightened and shaken.\"\n\nImmigrants, refugees and, in this case, Muslims are once again scapegoated and demonised.\n\nDr Nora Amath\n\nWho is spreading misinformation?\n\nProminent public figures have spurred the growing unrest by circulating misinformation online which incorrectly links the tragedy to immigration and Islam.\n\nFar-right campaigner and co-founder of the English Defence League (EDL) Tommy Robinson claimed the stabbing attack was \"more evidence to suggest Islam is a mental health issue than a religion of peace.\"\n\nHe encouraged his almost 900,000 X followers to join the riots.\n\nMerseyside Police confirmed members of the EDL were among those rioting in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nRiot police hold back protesters after disorder broke out on July 30, 2024 in Southport, England.

Insane,\" they wrote.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n'A horror movie': Three children dead after attack at Taylor Swift-themed dance class in UK\n\nMisinformation expert, Queensland University of Technology's Associate Professor Timothy Graham told SBS Examines the stabbing attack and misinformation has prompted an emotional response from \"all people across the spectrum of ideology.\"\n\n\"This blame game occurs, people try to position it or frame it in a way that serves their own interest,\" he said.\n\nHe points to UK politician Nigel Farage, who questioned if police were lying when describing the stabbing attack as not \"terror-related.\"\n\n\"They may not know the extent of what they are saying and how that is playing out online,\" said A/Prof Graham.\n\nHe said these posts may invoke \"coded language\" that works as a \"dog whistle\" — a subtle message intended to be understood by a specific group.\n\n\"It sends off all the signals that light up particular groups of people who already have everything ready to go, and who are already extremely concerned about particular issues.\"\n\nDespite misinformation being a major factor in the riots, A/Prof Graham said it isn't the only contributing factor.\n\n\"It's unfortunately a classic case of a perfect storm brewing,\" he said.\n\n\"People are upset with what is happening in the world, there's extreme structural inequity where only a small portion of people have extreme wealth and a lot of people are struggling with the cost of living, and there's a lot of political mistrust in the UK.\"\n\nRiot police hold back protesters after disorder broke out on July 30, 2024 in Southport, England.

Source: EPA / Adam Vaughan/EPA\n\nThe consequences of this misinformation are being felt in Australia, too.\n\n\"Unfortunately, these incidents have a reverberating global impact, especially for visibly-identifying Muslim women,\" Dr Amath said.\n\n\"Such events can lead to heightened fear, anxiety, and vulnerability, as they may become targets of hate speech, discrimination, or even physical violence.\"\n\nShe said many Muslim women are afraid to be in public.\n\n\"They're on guard just in case they have to 'cop it'.\"\n\nIt's unfortunately a classic case of a perfect storm brewing.\n\nAssociate Professor Timothy Graham\n\nDr Amath hopes this serves as a reminder of the \"importance of accurate and responsible political and media discourse.\"\n\n\"The violent riots we are seeing in the UK didn’t happen in a vacuum,\" she said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have seen the massive, violent consequences of such misinformation.\"\n\nLISTEN TO\n\nIslamophobia in everyday life\n\nSBS English\n\n30/07/2024 07:21"
