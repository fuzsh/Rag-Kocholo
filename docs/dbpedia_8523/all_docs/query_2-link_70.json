        "text": "Some of the hottest stars that feature in the United States' World Cup squad were born in England.\n\nThe two nations face each in the tournament on Friday, and the US go into the match with a strong English presence in their squad. That's because three of the Americans in Gregg Berhalter's side were produced on British shores.\n\nThe trio in question are US starlets Giovanni Reyna, Cameron Carter-Vickers, and Antonee Robinson. Borussia Dortmund attacker Reyna was spawned in Sunderland by his father and Black Cats legend Claudio Reyna, who used to captain the US.\n\nALSO READ: World Cup fans in stitches as Australia supporter spots himself on stadium big screen\n\nThe 20-year-old also had the option to play for Portugal or Argentina, but chose to follow in his father's footsteps and represent the US, after making his international debut in 2020. Beach destination Southend is the birthplace of Carter-Vickers, who made his bones in Tottenham's academy, and now plays for Celtic. His mother is English, but the 24-year-old's dad is a former NBA star and American, Howard Carter.\n\nFulham left-back Antonee Robinson was born in the UK, like his father, who was raised in New York and subsequently given US citizenship. But Robinson was brought up in Liverpool after being born in Milton Keynes.\n\nHowever, the 25-year-old decided to pull on an America jersey despite growing through the ranks at Everton. Along with the English natives, the US squad is compiled of six Premier League stars that will face the Three Lions today.\n\nDo you think England will beat the USA? Let us know in the comments section\n\nThe Prem sextet includes Leeds United's duo Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams, plus Chelsea's Christian Pulisic, Fulham pair Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson, along with Arsenal ace Matt Turner.\n\nEngland go into the game brimming with confidence after dismantling Iran 6-2 in their opening match. While the US were held to a 1-1 draw by Wales, courtesy of a late penalty strike from Gareth Bale.\n\nREAD NEXT"
