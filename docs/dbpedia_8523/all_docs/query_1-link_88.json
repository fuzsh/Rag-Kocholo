        "text": "Dave is CEO and Co-Founder at Techspert. His primary responsibility is heading the company’s operational and financial activities. His background lies in biotechnology and he holds a Master’s in Biochemistry from the University of Oxford and a Master’s in Bioscience Enterprise from the University of Cambridge.\n\nDave went on to become a biotech patent attorney and worked in corporate development for a diagnostics start-up in Cambridge. It was while doing market research at that firm that the need for better access to expert insights became clear. So, he teamed up with Graham and Hari to build a platform to transform the way knowledge is transferred between people and businesses globally.\n\nOriginally trained as a chartered accountant at Ernst & Young, Chris joins the executive team as CFO. He’s spent the past 12 years working with SMEs and high-growth businesses with his most recent experience with PE and VC-backed technology businesses, helping them fundraise, scale and exit.\n\nChris’ key responsibility is to ensure techspert.io is properly funded and to drive efficient growth, so the business realizes its maximum potential.\n\nJamie has 20 years of experience in M&A services, with most of his career being in expert networks. After starting his career in consulting, he moved to GLG where he spent 12 years at the expert network firm with his final role leading the Private Equity delivery team across EMEA and successfully driving the growth of that business unit.\n\nAs COO, Jamie’s primary responsibility is leading the Business Development function and driving profitable revenue growth, an area he has documented experience in."
