        "text": "Board Chair\n\nDavid is currently a Master of Divinity student at the Harvard Divinity School. In 2018 David was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives from Southwest Florida’s 19th Congressional District.\n\nBorn and raised in New York by parents passionately active in the struggle for civil rights and peace, political involvement and community service came naturally to David. Attending public schools in New York City and Westchester County, he went on to major in political science at Temple University. David's professional life has balanced his interest in public service with a business career that included serving as Deputy Director of CASRA, a nationally renowned California consortium of non-profit mental health care providers at the cutting edge of policy and treatment reform.\n\nDavid has served as President of the United Way of Greater White Plains, NY, and on numerous other boards, including the Duffy Health Center of Cape Cod, MA, and the HazeldenBettyFord Florida Council.\n\nFrom 2008-2009 David attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he earned a Master's in Public Administration. It was a profoundly life-altering experience, opening David to a deeper understanding of the world while giving him unparalleled training in leadership and organizational development."
