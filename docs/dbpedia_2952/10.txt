Original Italian 79x55 Poster Folded Theater-Used Fair Condition Only

Warner Brothers Original Italian 79x55 Poster for the Felix E. Feist directed western drama THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN (1952) The film stars Randolph Scott, Patrice Wymore, Dick Wesson, Philip Carey, Roy Roberts, Morris Ankrum, Anthony Caruso and Charles Horvath. Here is one of the most unusual Italian posters for an American western that we have ever seen. The film is a Randolph Scott movie, but the poster shows Patrice Wymore being threatened, perhaps, by third billed Dick Wesson, who appears on the poster in drag. No LGTBQ content here, really, just a man in disguise escaping from bandits -- at least according to the plot synopsis. This poster was used in a theater, and is in fair condition only. The art is my Luigi Martinati. We believe the poster should be linen-backed. MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees that this poster is an authentic, vintage Italian 79x55 for this film. This is a large format poster; Italian quatro-foglio posters are printed on two separate panels which are joined together to present as one poster. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions
