Felix Ellison Feist (February 28, 1910 â€“ September 2, 1965) was an American film and television director and writer born in New York City.

He is probably best remembered for Deluge (1933), for writing and directing the film noirs The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1947) and The Threat (1949), and for helming the second screen version of the Curt Siodmak sci-fi tale Donovan's Brain (1953), which starred Nancy Davis before she became known as Nancy Reagan.
