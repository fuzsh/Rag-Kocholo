        "text": "Original Warner Brothers One-Sheet Poster (27x41). Linen-Backed. Very Fine.\n\nOriginal Warner Brothers One-Sheet Poster for the Felix E. Feist directed potboiler THIS WOMAN IS DANGEROUS (1952). The film stars Joan Crawford, Dennis Morgan, David Brian, Philip Carey, Douglas Fowley and Mari Aldon. Crawford plays Beth Austin, a dangerous woman if there ever was one. The text on the poster is priceless: \"Part of her was Ritz - part of her was 'racket' - all of her was exciting! Beth Austin - stylish dame with a stylish name - who lived by jungle law in a big city and and clawed her way to where the money was...!\" This was typical of the kind of film that Warners was handing to Joan Crawford in the mid-fifties. She was squarely in middle age, but still a star. This poster was used in a theater, was in very good condition and we have had it linen-backed. Presents beautifully. MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees that this poster is authentic. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nFELIX E. FEIST - Director\n\nJoan Crawford - Actor\n\nDennis Morgan - Actor\n\nPhilip Carey - Actor\n\nMari Aldon - Actor\n\nDOUGLAS FOWLEY - Actor"
