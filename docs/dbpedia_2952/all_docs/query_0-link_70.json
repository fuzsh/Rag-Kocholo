        "text": "The programme in which the BBC hands over air-time to the public. Today:\n\nTake Five Girls\n\nPresented by five 16-year-old girls from a mixed comprehensive school at Crowthorne, Berkshire. They had exactly four weeks to select a subject, learn about film and make their programme.\n\nMade by the pupils of Edgbarrow School with the help of the BBC's Community Programme Unit\n\nLast of three Omnibus films about the transatlantic take-over of our popular song and dance.\n\nThe Road to Rock 'n' Roll\n\nRock 'n' Roll was an All-American phenomenon akin to ragtime, jazz and swing. It depended on the same vital raw element, and on the alertness of a new set of entrepreneurs. A disc jockey christened it in 1952. In 1956 ' Rock around the Clock' exploded on Britain. In 1964 a group of young English musicians took America by storm. The American background was filmed in New York and the Deep South. Those appearing include hillbillies, bluesmen, churchmen, radio men, rockabilly Charlie Feathers and record producers Jerry Wexler and Sam Phillips -the man who discovered\n\nElvis Presley.\n\nFrom the archives: THE BEATLES, CHUCK BERRY , BILL HALEY and ELVIS\n\nPRESLEY.\n\nNarrator RONALD PICKUP\n\nFull of good and unexpected things.\n\n(SUNDAY TELEGRAPH)\n\nFabulous series. (TIME OUT)\n\nFilm editor PETER WEST\n\nWritten and produced by GEOFFREY HAYDON\n\nBBC2 joins the Radio 1 In Concert programme in a Simultaneous Broadcast for an hour's contemporary rock music. This week\n\nJohn Miles\n\nIntroduced by PETE DRUMMOND\n\nDirector TOM CORCORAN\n\nProducer MICHAEL APPLETON\n\nA simultaneous stereo broadcast with Radio 1. (To obtain the best effect viewers with stereo Radio 1 should turn off TV sound and position their loudspeakers on either side of the screen but close enough to relate stereo image to picture size. Stereo headphones provide a suitable alternative)\n\nA Yesterday's Witness special\n\nNarrated by Benny Green who takes an affectionate look at the first 40 years of English cinema.\n\nPioneer film director George Pearson remembers the golden silence of the first British feature films.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock tells how he broke that silence with Blackmail, Britain's first all-talking picture.\n\nAlexander Korda recalls how he put British films on the international silver screen with The Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\nAnd with a visit to one of London's handful of unspoilt 30s cinemas - organ and all - we, too, can enjoy 'a night at the pictures' as it used to be.\n\nTonight from BBC Scotland Current Account on The Scottish Connection\n\nWhat kind of support is going from Scotland to paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland?\n\nThe links between the two countries have existed for centuries. But they have never been more apparent than in the last eight agonised years of the province's troubles. Now there is a convincing body of evidence that the exchanges in recent years have amounted to more than just expressions of friendship and marching side-by-side in traditional parades.\n\nBrian Barr and Jeremy Paxman investigate The Scottish Connection\n\nDirectors COLIN CAMERON , SIMON BERTHON Producer DAVID MARTIN\n\nSeries co-ordinator FRANK GILLARD\n\nstarring Michel Robin\n\nJean-Luc Bideau , Francois Simon Remy Placet is an unassuming bachelor who lives modestly with his mother, has a routine office job and gardens in his spare time. When his mother dies, Placet is given compassionate leave and shortly afterwards his employer and colleagues are intrigued by an invitation to spend a day at his new country home.\n\nDirector CLAUDE GORETTA.
