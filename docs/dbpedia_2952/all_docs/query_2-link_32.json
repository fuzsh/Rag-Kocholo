There, he meets music teacher Stephanie Varna, who is romantically involved with Alex Melnikov, a Russian officer, and inspires her with his talk of personal liberty. Tom asks Stephanie about Josef, Cardinal Mindszenty, the Roman Catholic prelate of Hungary and a firm opponent of the Communist regime, and she replies that despite Mindszenty's popularity, there is no effective underground movement to support him.

As late as Jul and Aug 1949, Episcopal minister Robert A. Dunn and Raymond Massey were sought to portray Cardinal Mindszenty, according to HR news items. The role still had not been cast when the film began production on 7 Sep 1949. Margaret Sullavan, who had not appeared in a film since 1943, was sought for the role of \"Stephanie\" before that part was assigned to Bonita Granville, wife of producer Jack Wrather. HR production charts add Ian Wolfe to the cast, but he was not in the viewed print. In Feb 1949, HR reported that United Artists would distribute the film. According to a Mar 1949 HR news item, Dimitri Tiomkin was originally signed to compose and conduct the score.\n\nAccording to a HR news item, the film was the target of a \"campaign of villification\" by the Communist Party, and the producers turned over numerous threatening and obscene letters to postal inspectors and the FBI. HR also noted that footage from official United Nations films and newsreels showing the UN's initial probe into Mindszenty's trial was to be incorporated into the picture, but nothing about the UN appeared in the viewed print. According to an article in Var, because Guilty of Treason performed poorly at the box office, Eagle-Lion was prompted to revise its advertising campaign to downplay the anti-Communist message and emphasize the \"girl-meets-boy angle.\" The Var article also noted that several other \"anti-Red\" films were \"still failing to pay off big at the box office.\"\n\nLess\n\nDuring a meeting of the Overseas Press Club, guest of honor Tom Kelly shows a newsreel about the international spread of Communism and describes his recent experiences in Soviet-dominated Hungary: In the fall of 1948, after harassment by the Kremlin, Tom leaves his post in Moscow to investigate the situation in Budapest.

On Christmas Eve, Tom holds a secret celebration with Stephanie and Alex, who reflects on the tragic losses his family suffered during the war. Shortly after the holiday, Mindszenty is arrested, leaving behind a note proclaiming his innocence and denying any \"confession\" that might subsequently be attributed to him. After more than thirty days of relentless interrogation, Mindszenty still has not confessed, and, reluctant to resort to physical torture before the trial, the doctor for the secret police recommends using a hypnotic drug on the cardinal. Meanwhile, Tom is severely beaten by a Nazi gang, which leaves a note on his body reading \"Heil Hitler, Heil Stalin.\" Stephanie shows Alex the note and urges him to follow his conscience and start an underground movement, but when Belov walks in, Alex has Stephanie arrested for espionage and treason. Stephanie refuses to confess to any crimes, and she dies under torture. As the conspiracy trial of Mindszenty and several other clerics begins, Tom questions Alex about Stephanie, reproaching him for being no better than the Nazis. Guilt-ridden, Alex goes to Stephanie's apartment, where he is shot to death by his fellow officers. Mindszenty is convicted of treason and sentenced to life in prison. Back at the Overseas Press Club meeting, Tom speaks on behalf of the martyrs in Eastern Europe and reminds his colleagues that liberty is everybody's business.\n\nLess"
