        "text": "This week’s movie has nothing to do with Rhett, Scarlet, Ashley, Melanie, and the gang. It’s a hidden gem unearthed by Eddie Muller a few years ago. Thanks, man.\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day is a lame and generic title for a fine 1951 film noir featuring outstanding performances by Ruth Roman and Steve Cochran. The chemistry between the two sizzles even during the obligatory meet cute at a dime a dance joint.\n\nOne thing that’s disorienting about this movie is that Roman, who was a gorgeous brunette, is a bleached blonde when we first meet her:\n\nSteve Cochran plays a man sent to jail at age thirteen for killing his abusive father. We see him leaving the slammer at the age of thirty-one uncertain what his next step should be. Uncertainty is one of the major themes of the movie; at least I think so.\n\nCochran meets Ruth Roman at the aforementioned dance hall and falls hard. Initially, she resists his charms. He follows her around like a lovesick puppy until he meets her police lieutenant boyfriend. The copper isn’t pleased to see Roman’s handsome suitor and knocks Cochran out. Roman shoots the lieutenant in self-defense but lets Cochran think he was the shooter. Bad Ruth.\n\nThe pair go on the run and have a series of adventures. Even in broad daylight, road trips are definitely noir.\n\nAfter a swell set piece involving a car hauler truck, they’re reduced to hitchhiking and are picked up and befriended by Lurene Tuttle and Ray Teal.\n\nThe older couple pick fruit for a living and convince the lamsters to join them. The two couples become neighbors at an agricultural compound far away from the scene of the crime. Things go well for Roman and Cochran until Teal learns Cochran is a wanted man with a price on his head. That’s when everything goes sideways for our stars.\n\nThat’s all the plot I’m willing to share, this feature is called pulp fiction, not pulp spoilers, after all. Besides, it’s not the plot that matters, it’s the charismatic star performances by Ruth Roman and Steve Cochran.\n\nEddie Muller loves this movie but hates the ending. It’s not noir enough for him. I get it but it’s a plausible happy ending: Happy endings are definitely not noir. I dare you to say not noir twelve times without faltering.\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day was directed by Felix Feist. His name is more memorable than his career but this film was a highlight. One reason for that was the stellar cinematography by Robert Burks who made eleven movies with a much better known director, Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nGrading Time: I give Tomorrow Is Another Day 3 1/2 stars and an Adrastos Grade of B+.\n\nReady to see some posters?\n\nI don’t know about you but all that road tripping with Steve and Ruth made me hungry. Let’s all go to the lobby for a snack:\n\nThe popcorn was too salty and not buttery enough for my taste. When I complained to the dancing refreshments, they didn’t want to hear it.\n\nReady for some color lobby cards for this black and white movie?\n\nThe trailer for this hidden treasure isn’t online so this will have to do:\n\nThe last word goes to Eddie Muller with his Noir Alley intro and outro:"
