        "text": "The Man Who Cheated Himself serves up yet another fascinating noir opening.\n\nWe see a man, alone in a room, occupied with several tasks â€“ putting bullets in a gun and carefully stashing it in a bureau, burning a box in a fireplace, using a poker to do some damage to a door. Whatâ€™s his deal? Whatâ€™s the correlation between these seemingly random acts? But before we get a chance to find out, in storms his wife, Lois Frazer (Jane Wyatt), and boy, is she pissed! (Apologies to my mom for using that word.) Turns out that Lois and her hubby, Howard (Harlan Warde), arenâ€™t exactly on good terms. And thatâ€™s putting it mildly.\n\nThis film is what I think of as a minor noir, nothing flashy, certainly no classic â€“ but itâ€™s got a solid story, brisk direction, and a trio of top-notch stars: Lee J. Cobb, who can always be counted on for an outstanding performance; Jane Wyatt, playing a rare bad-girl role; and the versatile John Dall, who youâ€™ll recognize from The Corn is Green (1945), Rope (1948), or Gun Crazy (1950).\n\nWHATâ€™S IT ABOUT?\n\nCobb is Lt. Cullen, whoâ€™s having an affair with the very married Lois. When a murder is committed in front of Cullen, he helps to cover it up. And he does a good job of it â€“ but he may not be good enough to fool his kid brother (Dall), a police detective working his first case.\n\nWHAT ELSE?\n\nFelix Feist, the filmâ€™s director, also helmed a couple of hard-hitting, down-and-dirty noirs, The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1947) and The Threat (1949). He also wrote and directed the sci-fi feature Donovanâ€™s Brain (1953).\n\nMore on Feist (kind of). His first wife, Lisa Howard, had a featured part in the film, as John Dallâ€™s devoted bride. She also appeared in Donovanâ€™s Brain. But by 1953, she and Feist were divorced and she was remarried to producer Walter Lowendahl. Howard appeared in a number of other films and TV series (including the soap opera The Edge of Night), but she found bigger success as a journalist â€“ she was one of the first women to have her own television news show (ABCâ€™s The NewsHour with Lisa Howard), and she scored interviews with such high-profile personages as Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and the Shah of Iran. Sadly, she suffered a miscarriage in 1965, and committed suicide a few weeks later â€“ two months before Felix Feist died of cancer at the age of 55.\n\nTOMORROW . . .\n\nJoin me for my next YouTube recommendation on Day 11 of Noirvember!"
