        "text": "Some spoilers ahead.\n\nThe Threat is a tight, efficient little crime programmer, one which represents the best of what Felix E. Feist was capable. It's almost a sketch of a story, built around a seething, terrifyingly contained performance by Charles McGraw as escaped convict Red Kluger. Within the first 10 minutes, we see Kluger kidnapping three people he blames for his incarceration, kidnappings carried out with a blend of brutality and ingenuity that immediately defines Kluger for us: fearless, violent, bent on revenge and, worst of all, smart.\n\nThough he only comes third in the credits, this is McGraw's picture, with alleged star Michael O'Shea spending the whole movie tied up, under Kluger's control, and second-named Virginia Grey only occasionally…\n\nSweet* little b-noir starring gravel-voiced Charles McGraw as a vicious con who breaks out of prison to get hold of his share of the loot and get even with whoever betrayed him.\n\nRestrictions breed creativity: you can find the truth in this concept in a lot of these down and dirty budget noirs. You've got to get your story told, you've got to get the excitement up, you've only got about an hour to do it. I love how they have no time to waste: we get straight in there with the sirens blaring as McGraw breaks out. In the first ten minutes we've established who he is, what he's doing and why, who his opposite number is, and what…\n\nFelix E. Feist’s film-noir in which a murderer gets away from jail, only to take vengeance on the sleuth and the lawyer who condemned him. Starring Charles MacGraw, Michael O’Shea and Virginia Grey.\n\nThe story concerns nasty hood 'Red' Kluger (Charles MacGraw) who evades from Folsom State Prison and follows through on his warnings to the sleuth who detained him and the D.A. who made him guilty.\n\nCharles MacGraw gives a good performance in his role as the man who is not a likeable character at all, while Michael O’Shea is decent in his part as Ray Williams, the detective who has to be careful with himself.\n\nAlso giving fine performances are Julie Bishop and Virginia Grey in their respective…\n\nThe final film of the fest - at least for this writer - was a blunt, no nonsense exercise in pure B-Movie craftsmanship. Running a down and dirty 66 minutes, THE THREAT finds Charles McGraw (in all his gravelly voiced glory) tearing up the countryside following a prison break. Hell bent on getting revenge on the D.A. (Frank Conroy) and Detective (Michael O'Shea) who put him behind bars, Felix Feist's brutal programmer is essentially one act of kidnapping and violence after another. The style is toned down, in favor of presenting an almost procedural approach to a madman's rampage, never letting its foot off the gas until we arrive at the fatalistic finale. McGraw's screen presence is a thing of…"
