        "text": "H.H. Pope Leo XIII of illustrious memory, by the epoch- making bull \"Quod Jampridem\" of May 20, 1887, separated the Syrian Catholics of Malabar from the Jurisdictions of Padroado as well as the Vicariate of Verapoly and erected for them two Apostolic Vicariates of Trichur and Kottayam. The Vicariate of Trichur had within its territory the most ancient Christian centers like, Kodungallur and Palayoor and Angamaly. It can be said that Trichur has the indirect continuation of the See of Kodungallur. Msgr. Adolphus Edwin Medlycott was the first Vicar Apostolic of Trichur.\n\nNine Years later, by the Brief \"Quae Rei Sacrae\" of July 28, 1896 the same Holy Father after reorganizing the two Vicariates into three, namely, Trichur, Ernakulam and Changanasserry gave Indians of the Syro-Malabar rite as their Vicars Apostolic. Thus, Mar John Menacherry became the first native Vicar Apostolic of Trichur.\n\nThe rapid and remarkable progress that the Syrian Catholics made under the Indian bishops in the course of a few years was highly appreciated by the Apostolic See and as a result, on 21st December 1923 by the bull \"Romani Pontifices\" of Pope Pius XI, the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy was established, raising Ernakulam to the status of a Metropolitan See and Trichur, Changanasserry and Kottayam as its suffragan Eparchies. Mar Francis Vazhappilly was the first Bishop of Trichur.\n\nMar George Alappat became the Bishop of Trichur in 1944. Pope Pius XII, by the bull \"Saepe Fidelis\" of April 29, 1955 extended the jurisdiction of the bishop of Trichur to the Civil District of Coimbatore. During the period of Mar Joseph Kundukulam, who is widely known as \"the father of the poor\", Trichur was divided to form two more eparchies. On June 20, 1974, Pope Paul VI by the bull \"Apostolico Requirente\" divided the Eparchy of Trichur erecting the Eparchy of Palakkad which consisted of the civil districts of Palakkad and Coimbatore. Again on June 22, 1978, Pope Paul VI separated the entire Taluk of Kodungalloor, greater Part of Mukundapuram and small portions of Paravoor and Aluva to the north of the river Chalakudy from the Eparchy of Trichur and erected the the Eparchy of Irinjalakuda by the Apostolic Bull \"Trichuriensis Eparchiae\"."
