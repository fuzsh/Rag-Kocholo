        "text": "Adilabad\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe history of Adilabad Diocese is inevitably linked with the history of Chanda Mission as it sharess the common legacy and mission thrust. Adilabad Diocese encompasses the rich heritage of orient and apostolic succession of the occident. The blooming of the diocese is the fruit of the hard labour, strenuous efforts and sacrifices of the dedicated Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI) Missionaries since 1962. The newly joined missionary priests vowed to join the heroic path of the pioneering missionaries.\n\nChanda Mission/Chanda Diocese\n\nPope John XXIII established the first Syro-Malabar Ordinariate of Chanda on 31 March 1962 with Msgr. Januarius Palathuruthy CMI as its first Ecclesiastical Superior with the faculties of Apostolic Exarch. It was carved out from the Archdiocese of Nagpur. The Ordinariate was raised to the status of an Apostolic Exarchate on 29 July 1968 and Msgr Januarius was made its Apostolic Exarch.\n\nOn 26 February 1977 Pope Paul VI raised it to the status of an Eparchy and Msgr. Januarius Palathuruthy was appointed its first bishop. It comprises the civil districts of Wardha, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra state and Adilabad in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nCatholic Diocese of Adilabad\n\nThe territory of Diocese of Adilabad is same as that of the civil district of Adilabad (16,210 square kilometers) in Telangana. Pope John Paul II constituted it by his Bull 'Ad Aptius Consulendum', as an independent diocese on July 23, 1999. Most Rev Joseph Kunnath CMI, was appointed the first bishop and consecrated on October 6, 1999.\n\nThe CMI (Carmelites of Mary Immaculate) Congregation started evangelization work in this area in 1962 when the Ordinariate of Chanda was established. Prior to 1962, there were only two centres in Adilabad, one at Sirpur Kagaznagar with a resident priest and the other at Bellampally with a priest, visiting from Archdiocese of Nagpur.\n\nThe first phase of the history of the Diocese unfolds with the appointment of Bishop Joseph Kunnath CMI, the architect and the first Bishop of Adilabad Diocese. At the time of bifurcation, Adilabad had 18 centers with resident priests and about 60 villages with 10,500 Catholics. At present there are 36 mission centers with residential priests and more than 100 substations, with 16,287 Catholics. Most of the Priests and Nuns are actively involved in Evangelization work besides Education, Social Work and Health Care in the diocese.\n\nSaint Kuriakose Elias Chavara is the Patron of the Diocese as he was one of the forerunners of the reformation movements of the 19th century India, especially in the Church in Kerala. The diocese belongs to the Syro-Malabar Church, an Oriental Catholic Church. The Southern boundary of the Diocese is Godavari River and on the East, West and the North borders lie in the State of Maharashtra. The adjacent dioceses are Chanda in the North and the East, Amaravathi in the West and Warangal in the South.\n\nIn accordance with the Divine plan, the second phase of the history of the Diocese opens up with the appointment of Rt. Rev. Dr. Prince Antony Panengadan as the second Bishop of Adilabad. Bishop Joseph Kunnath CMI resigned after turning 75 years of age, the canonical year for retirement of bishops. His Excellency’s consecration and installation ceremony was held at St Chavara Pastoral Centre, Thimmapur on the 29th October 2015.\n\nAt present Adilabad is a flourishing Diocese where a lot of missionary activities are being carried out by the concerted efforts of priests and nuns. The diocese is having a limited number of priests and they are struggling to maintain the faith formation of the faithful. Since it is the beginning stage of the Church, faithful need to be cared well so that they may grow in good faith. The diocese is in need of many more dedicated priests. The people are really open to the word of God and the missionaries are accepted here.\n\nRight Rev.

Barbe, the pastor of Chittagong, visited Tripura in 1843. Holy Cross pioneering missionaries Fr Louis Augustine Verite and Fr Beboit Adolphe Mercier visited Agartala in 1856 and administered sacraments to the Christians in Mariamnagar village. From 1937 onwards priests began to take permanent residence at Mariamnagar. The first Parish in Tripura was erected at Mariamnagar in 1939. The first permanent Church was blessed in 1952. Because of its geographical proximity, the Archdiocese of Dhaka continued to cater to the spiritual needs of the Catholics in Tripura till the erection of the new ecclesiastical unit in 1952, namely, the Prefecture of Haflong. In 1969, the Prefecture was upgraded to the position of a Diocese with Most Rev. Denzil D' Souza, DD, as the first Bishop of Silchar, which comprised the states of Mizoram and Tripura and the District of Cachar in Assam.\n\nBy the Papal Bull \"Venerabiles Frates Nostri\" dated January 11, 1996, Pope John Paul II decreed the erection of the Diocese of Agartala. The new Diocese of Agartala which comprises the entire state of Tripura was bifurcated from the erstwhile Diocese of Silchar. Most Rev. Lumen Monteiro CSC, DD, was appointed the first Bishop of the new Diocese. He was ordained and installed on May 26, 1996. The Diocese of Agartala is dedicated to Christ the Light of the World with St. Francis Xavier as the Patron. The motto is \"Lead us Onward\".\n\nToday the Diocese of Agartala has 20 Parishes and a Catholic population of over 45,000 in total of 3.7 million people. The Diocese of Agartala which comprises the entire State of Tripura with 8 Civil Districts has 30% of its population comprising of the indigenous tribal people who come from 19 major tribes. To mention a few: Debbarma, Reang, Darlong, Halam, Garo, Jamatia, Tripura, Molsom, Rupini, Kaipeng, Hrangkhawl, Bongcher, Mog, Munda and Santhal.\n\nRight Rev.

Agartala-799009 ( Tripura)\n\nArea:10,486sq.kmsPopulation:3.5million (approximately)Catholics:35,000Languages:Bengali, KokBorok, and other dialects\n\nAgra\n\nHISTORY\n\nAgra Archdiocese consists of the following districts in Uttar Pradesh: Agra, Aligarh, Auraiya, Budaun, Bulandshahr, Etah, Etawah, Farrukabad, Fathegarh, Firozabad, Gautambudha Nagar, Hathras, Kannauj, Mainpuri, Mathura and in Rajasthan, Bharatpur and Dholpur.\n\nThe Emperor Akbar, wishing to have some learned Christian priests at his Court, invited the Jesuits from their College at Goa. The first Church work with the Moghul was thus formed by Blessed Rudolf Aquaviva (later a martyr at Goa), Anthony Monserrate and Francis Henriquez, who arrived at the Moghul Court, then at Fatehpur Sikri in 1580. A second and a third Church work followed. The Jesuits enjoyed the patronage of Akbar and his son Jahangir; but under Shah Jehan and Aurangzeb this disappeared. Though there were no Christian congregations of importance in Moghul India, there were a number of individuals who wielded considerable influences in Court and elsewhere.\n\nWhen in 1773 the Jesuits were suppressed, two Carmelite Fathers from Bombay succeeded them in Agra, who in turn, were replaced by the Capuchins after a very short while. By a decree of the Sacred Congregation, dated May 17, 1784, the Vicariate - Apostolic of the Great Moghul was constituted.\n\nThe history of the Agra Archdiocese under the Capuchins was closely linked with their work in Tibet.\n\nSt. Peter's College\n\nEarly in 1708, four Capuchins, starting from Kathmandu, reached Lhasa after two months. More Capuchins followed them and took up their residence at Lhasa until April 20, 1745, when, owing to relentless persecution by the Tibetan Priesthood, they had to leave Tibet, and return to Nepal. Thus the capuchin Church work in Lhasa came to an end. But the Church work continued its existence in Nepal until 1768.\n\nCathedral House\n\nThe whole chain of Capuchin stations, embracing the greater part of North India from Chandernagore to Lhasa, from Sind to Bengal, from the Himalayas to Narbada river, now the Diocese of Ajmer - Jaipur, Allahabad, Indore, Jhansi, Lahore, Lucknow, Meerut, Patna, Varanasi, Delhi, Jalandar, Simla - Chandigarh, Bijnor and Jammu & Kashmir, (formerly Rawalpindi) all came to be known as the Tibet Hindustan Church work. The Cathedrals of Agra, Ajmer, Allahabad, Delhi, Lahore (before the new one), Madras, Patna and Simla, are symbols and monuments of the untiring zeal of the Capuchins for the extension of the faith and the progress of the Catholic Church in India.\n\nThe prefecture Apostolic of Tibet-Hindustan was in 1820, constituted into the Vicaritae Apostolic of Agra, with Msgr.

Areawise, Ahmedabad is the smallest of the four dioceses in Gujarat but with 63,962 Catholics Ahmedabad is the biggest diocese! Ahmedabad is also the oldest diocese in the state.\n\nHistorically too the Ahmedabad diocese has great significance. The freedom struggle was directed from the Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad which was the headquarters of Gandhiji for meeting the leaders of the freedom movement and the British officials till he started the Dandi March on March 12, 1930. Karamsad in Anand District which comes within the boundaries of the Ahmedabad diocese was also the birth place of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India.\n\nThe Ahmedabad Diocese has a long history. There are indications of Christians living at Khambhat and Ahmedabad from the beginning of the sixteenth century when the Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510. All through the 19th century Catholics from outside the states have come and settled in several towns of Gujarat. Ahmedabad city had a church from 1842 at Sabarmati.\n\nBut the beginning of local Christians is traced to the baptism of 18 people at Mogri on December 11, 1893 by Fr Manuel Xavier Gomes, a diocesan priest from the Archdiocese of Bombay. A team of German and Swiss Jesuits followed Fr Gomes. Then came more diocesan priests followed by the Spanish Jesuits in 1922.\n\nIn 1934 the entire area of Gujarat State north of the Mahi river including Kathiawad and Kutch became the independent Ahmedabad mission separated from Bombay Archdiocese, with an Ecclesiastical Superior in the person of Fr Joaquin Villallonga, SJ. There were only five mission stations in 1934 : Anand established in 1895, Vadtal in 1897, Karamsad in 1907, Nadiad in 1911 and Amod in 1914.\n\nThe Daughters of the Cross (FC) were the first congregation of nuns to start work in Gujarat from 1898. Then came the Sisters of The Apostolic Carmel (AC) to work in Gujarat in January 1923. They opened their first school at Ahmedabad in 1929. In 1936 a local congregation of the Little Daughters of St Francis Xavier (LD) was founded by a Jesuit Priest, Fr Carlos Suria in collaboration with Sr Xavier.\n\nThe steady growth of the Ahmedabad mission resulted in the establishment of the Ahmedabad Diocese on May 5, 1949 covering the entire Gujarat area north of the river Mahi much before the present Gujarat state was carved out of the Bombay state on May 1, 1960.\n\nThe tenure of the first Bishop of Ahmedabad, Bishop Edwin Pinto, SJ (1949-73) was a period of consolidation of the Christian community and also the beginning of the expansion of the Church to north and south Gujarat.\n\nMeanwhile a second diocese in Gujarat was established on September 29, 1966 as Baroda diocese with the six districts in South Gujarat, south of Mahi river curved out of Bombay Archdiocese with Bishop Ignatius D'Souza as its first bishop.\n\nIn Ahmedabad diocese Bishop Charles Gomes, SJ succeeded Bishop Pinto in 1974 and he saw to the expansion of the Church of north and central Gujarat as well as to the growth of Church personnel especially diocesan priests and religious sisters.\n\nA new development took place in 1977 with the formation of the Rajkot Diocese under Bishop Jonas Thaliath, CMI as its first bishop. The new diocese was separated from the Ahmedabad Diocese, covering the entire area of Saurashtra and Kutch-Bhuj.\n\nThen, in 1990 Bishop Stanislaus Fernandes, SJ took up the reins from Bishop Gomes in Ahmedabad Diocese and saw to the further consolidation of the Christian communities in the north and central Gujarat. The steady growth of the Church then saw the establishment of the new Archdiocese of Gandhinagar headed by Archbishop Stanislaus Fernandes, SJ. The new archdiocese was separated from the Ahmedabad Diocese in November 2002.\n\nBishop Thomas Ignas Macwan became the first local Catholic Bishop Ahmedabad Diocese in January 2003 indicating the coming of age of the Church in Gujarat.\n\nMission & Vision\n\nWe, the Christians in the Ahmedabad Diocese, like the Christians in all the dioceses around the world, strive to walk in the footsteps of our leader Jesus Christ and to proclaim to all people of good will his message of love and forgiveness as well as universal brotherhood and sisterhood. Jesus Christ went about doing good to all especially the poor, the neglected and the abandoned like the dalits, lepers, tax collectors and public sinners.\n\nWe uphold the freedom guaranteed by our Constitution to profess, proclaim and propagate our Christian religion while stoutly defending the rights and freedom of all people to profess and practise the religion of their choice. With the universal church we abhors forced conversions and the use of foul means to convert or reconvert people from one religion to another. We believe in the religion of love founded by Christ.\n\nEducation for Social Change\n\nThe Ahmedabad Diocese believes and strives to prepare men and women for others through its formal and informal educational efforts. While striving for the all round progress of children through our education we aim to form our children into useful citizens for themselves and for others in this great country and beyond.\n\nWith this goal in mind we run a college, six higher secondary schools and 22 high schools and many more primary and middle schools.\n\nOur non-formal educational programmes include balwadies, remedial classes for weaker students, literacy programmes, adult education and villages libraries.\n\nWe also run a number of vocational training centres like industrial training centres, type-writing and computer programmes, tailoring and embroidery, etc.\n\nMentally challenged children and handicapped people too find appropriate integrated educational programmes run by our religious personnel in the diocese.\n\nPastoral Services\n\nThe Diocese carries out pastoral ministries through its own diocesan priests as well as through men and women belonging to different religious congregations.\n\nA religious congregation is a body within the Catholic Church working with a specific Charism of it's founder embodied in the Constitution of the Congregation with the three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.\n\nThe Diocese has 76 diocesan priests and about 31 more young men in various stages of their eight-year long priestly formation. They work mostly in parishes, mission stations and schools.\n\nThe diocese has 4 congregations of men : They are, 1. The Society of Jesus (Jesuits - SJ), 2. The Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB), 3. The Society of St Francis Xavier (Pilars Fathers-SFX) and 4. Missionary Brothers of St Francis of Assisi (CMSF). These religious Priests and Brothers are engaged in all sorts of services like education, pastoral ministry, social service and vocational training, etc.\n\nThere are about 26 Religious congregations of women working in the diocese. They run schools like Mount Carmel School in Ahmedabad by the Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel or St Xavier's High School at Vatva by the Sisters known as the Little Daughters of St Francis Xavier. St Mary's Mahila Shikshan Kendra and Social Service Centre at Gomtipur managed by the Dominican Missionaries of the Holy Rosary (O.P.) Most of the sisters work in small towns and villages running dispensaries, boardings for girls and mahila mandals, etc.\n\nMedical Services : Health for All\n\nWith the aim of proving medical services especially for the poor and needy, the Catholic Church runs a number of dispensaries in villages and small towns. The Diocese also runs two hospitals at Nadiad and Ahmedabad which cater specially to the people from the lower strata of the society. Besides, the Diocese also manages the Narol Leprosy Hospital which is hailed as a model leprosy hospital in Gujarat and beyond.\n\nThe Diocese through the Missionaries of Charity of Mother Teresa also runs two Mobile Dispensaries in slum areas offering medical services to the poorest of the poor in Ahmedabad city.\n\nThe St Mary's Nursing Home at Gomtipur, the mill area of Ahmedabad city is known as the cheapest and safest \"delivery home\" for the poor in the city.\n\nMost of our dispensaries function in villages where no other medical services are available to the poor and backward people. These dispensaries and mobile clinics reach out to all people irrespective of their castes and creeds.\n\nSocial Services\n\nFollowing the example of their founder Jesus Christ who went about doing good to all, the Christians in Ahmedabad Diocese extend services to all peoples irrespective of their caste and religion but especially the poor and the needy.\n\nThe Diocesan Social Service Centre headquartered at Hansol, Ahmedabad, Behavioural Science Centre (BSC) and St Xavier's Social Service Society, both run by the Jesuits, are three of the best known social service organizations in the Diocese. They are also the three biggest centres in terms of their services extending far and wide in the Diocese and beyond. But we have also social service wings which are part and parcel of many of our parishes and schools and through which we reach out to the most needy people of the locality.\n\nOur social service centres engage in social, economic, medical, vocational and educational activities such as conducting balwadies for poor children, remedial classes for children of some municipal schools, tuition classes for students weak in studies. The social centres have also helped poor people to build their homes, farmers are helped with seeds and to dig wells and young boys and girls with vocational courses like computer training, tailoring embroidery, etc.\n\nDuring natural calamities like floods, drought and the killer earthquake of January 26, 2001, our social service centres were at the vanguard with relief and rehabilitation works. Some of our institutions have also done wonderful works in water-harvesting and building check-dams.\n\nPublications, Printing Press & Publishing House\n\nDOOT is a Jesuit run integral family magazine primarily meant for the Gujarati Christians.\n\nTHE AHMEDABAD MISSIONARY (TAM) is a monthly magazine in English for the friends and benefactors of the Ahmedabad Diocese.\n\nTHE CATHOLIC SAMACHAR is a Gujarati monthly newspaper which voices the concerns of the Gujarati Catholic Samaj.\n\nTHE AHMEDABAD DIOCESAN CHRONICLE is a newsletter, and in-house publication for diocesan personnel.\n\nANAND PRESS is our Xavier Edu-Technical Training Centre (XETC) and printing press at Anand which produces a lot of quality literature for Christians and for others.\n\nGUJARAT SAHITYA PRAKASH (GSP) at Anand publishes books in English and Gujarati about Bible, Liturgy, Spirituality, Theology, etc.\n\nPRASHANT is our justice and peace centre working for human rights, social justice, human developments, etc.\n\nRISHTA is Jesuit Writers' Cell based at Ahmedabad.

Rev. Fortunatus Henry Caumont, ofm. cap. was appointed the first Bishop of Ajmer. On March 11, 1935 parts of the Dioceses which were in the present state of Madhya Pradesh, were detached to become part of the newly erected Prefecture Apostolic of Indore.\n\nThe Diocese was handed over to the Diocesan clergy on May 9, 1949. By the decree of the Holy See dated June 21, 1951. Bandikui with its sub-station Alwar was transferred for geographical and administrative reasons from Agra Archdiocese to Ajmer Diocese. However the Agra Archdiocese retained the jurisdiction over the districts of Bharatpur and Dholpur.\n\nBy another decree of the Holy See dated May 13, 1955 the name of the diocese was changed to Ajmer-Jaipur. By decree of the Sacred Congregation for Evangelisation of People (Prot.no.1332/81 dated March 11th 1981) the civil district of Mandasaur was transferred from the jurisdiction of the diocese of Ajmer-Jaipur to that of the Diocese of Indore.\n\nOn December 29, 1984 the Holy Father Pope John Paul II, with a decree, divided the Diocese of Ajmer-Jaipur, forming a new diocese named the Catholic Diocese of Udaipur consisting of the districts of Bhilwara, Chittaurgarh, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara and Thandla tehsil. The Holy Father through the same decree appointed Rt. Rev. Joseph Pathalil as it's first Bishop.\n\nThrough a mutual agreement between the diocesan bishop and the Superior General of the Little Flower Congregation, Cochin dated April 25, 1986 the districts of Sri Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Churu, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jhunjhunu, Karoli and Sikar were entrusted to the Little Flower Congregation to carry out the work of Evangelisation, pastoral ministry and development on a permanent basis.\n\nOn July 20, 2005, the Holy Father Benedict XVI, with a decree bifurcated the Diocese of Ajmer-Jaipur forming a new Diocese - The Catholic Diocese of Jaipur consisting of the District of Jaipur, Alwar, Bikaner, Churu, Dausa, Sikar and Sri Ganganagar and appointed Most Rev.

In 1707 six Fathers reached Lhasa. They were well received by the grand Lama and allowed to build a church and a house. For lack of personnel, they had to abandon Tibet twice. In 1741 a third expedition was sent. A persecution started due to pressure from the Lamas. In the meantime missionaries continued their healing apostolate. Unfortunately not one Tibetan embraced the faith. In 1745 the missionaries left Lhasa for Nepal. Twenty four Tibetan converts were gathered together for the last time as they joined in offering the Holy Sacrifice, the missionaries left and Tibet was closed for Christ.\n\nNepal (1715-1760)\n\nIn 1738-1741 the kings of Bhatgon and Kathmandu requested the missionaries to open a mission in their kingdoms. The land and house to stay were given to the missionaries. By November 1767 there were 59 Baptisms. In July 1745 there was a three cornered war between Bhatgaon, Patan and Kathmandu. Prithvi Narayan, the ruler of the Ghurkas became the liberator of the three kingdoms and within 8 years he conquered the rest of Nepal. He denied the missionaries the royal subsidies granted by his predecessors. As they could not get any financial help the missionaries left Nepal for Bettiah.\n\nTibet-Hindustan (1769-1845)\n\nPatna was till now a resting place for the missionaries traveling between Nepal, Tibet and Chandernagar. In1773 the mission of Agra was entrusted to the Carmelite Fathers. Due to the shortage of missionaries the two Vicariates were amalgamated the missionaries of the province of Ancona were entrusted to look after the above territories which became a great burden to them. Adding to this there was trouble in Europe with political disturbances. The shortage of priests affected the missionary work and its progress in India All these problems did not in any way disturb the faith of the Catholics.\n\nIn 1820 the prefecture of Tibet-Hindustan was erected into a Vicariate with the see of Agra. In 1825 Fr. Anthony Pezzoni was appointed Vicar Apostolic. He left India in 1842, and was succeeded by Msgr. Joseph Anthony Borghi. At the request of Dr. Borghi, Agra was separated from the mission of Agra and Patna was raised to a Vicariate of Patna in 1845 comprising of eight territories.\n\nVicariate of Patna (1845-1886)\n\nAfter Carli of Pastoria refused to accept his appointment, Dr. Anastasius Hartmann of Lucerne was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Patna on September 8, 1845. He was consecrated on March 13, 1846 at Agra. The catholic population at this time was two thousand. Little later, Chunar, Benaras and Ghazipur were passed over to the Vicariate of Patna.\n\nErection of the Diocese of Allahabad\n\nOn September 1, 1886 Patna Vicariate was erected into a Diocese under the name of \"Roman Catholic Diocese of Allahabad.\" The town of Allahabad was being officially recognized as the new Capital of the mission. Rt. Rev. Dr. Francis Pesci became its first Bishop. On December 20, 1890 the mission changed hands. It passed over to the Capuchin Fathers of the province of Bologna.\n\nTo promote the mission work, to get more labors in the vineyard of the lord and to extend God's Kingdom, some districts were dismembered from the Allahabad Diocese to form new prefectures and dioceses.\n\nIn 1887 Purnea and Darjeeling were ceded to the Arch- Diocese of Calcutta. In 1892 Bettiah, Chuhari, and Latonah of Allahabad Diocese, formed the prefecture of Bettiah. Patna, along with Bankipore, Bhagalpur, Jaunpur belonging to the Allahabad Diocese formed the Diocese of Patna in 1919. Jabalpur Prefecture was formed in 1932 with Nawgong, Saugor, Bina and Shampura. Then followed the Prefecture of Indore in 1935 with an addition of Bhopal and Sehore given from Allahabad. In January 1940, Lucknow Diocese was formed with ten civil districts of Uttar Pradesh given from the Diocese of Allahabad. This was followed by the erection of Jhansi Prefecture comprising of six civil districts of U.P. from Allahabad. Finally, Varanasi Prefecture was formed with Varanasi, Mughalsarai, Francispur, Ghazipur, Hartmannpur, Gorakhpur and Shahganj and it was raised to the status of a Diocese in 1970.\n\nAt present Allahabad Diocese, one of the largest Dioceses in the world, since 1886 had gradually helped to form seven ecclesiastical units. This Diocese was manned by the Capuchins till 1947, and then handed over to the Diocesan Clergy formed by Bishop Angelo Poli O.F.M. Cap. Archbishop Leonard Raymond was its first Indian Ordinary (Bishop) in 1947. Today Allahabad Diocese comprises of 13 civil districts of Uttar Pradesh. They are Allahabad, Ambedkarnagar, Amethi, Faizabad, Fatehpur, Kaushambi. Kanpur City, Kanpur Rural, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Raebareli, Sonebhadra and Sultanpur.\n\nRight Rev.

The territory to the north of that line belongs to the Cochin Diocese and that to the south of it, to the Diocese of Alleppey. The executorial Decree of September 8, 1952 assigned to each of the Diocese of Alleppey and Cochin a supplementary personal jurisdiction over certain parishes in the territory of the other. This Decree was approved by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of Faith on September 24, 1952 and became effective on October 11, 1952.\n\nThe boundaries are: on the north, the Kuthiathodu Canal Line; on the south, a straight line from the curve of the Pampa River at Viyapuram to the Arabian Sea through Thottappally; on the east, a line along the middle of the Vembanadu Lake continued to the south by the Pallathuruthy Canal, one of the main branches of the Pampa River, to Viyapuram; on the west: the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe area assigned to the Diocese comprises roughly the area of the Jesuit Mission of St. Andre of Muterte. The Jesuits started mission work among the St. Thomas Christians in this area about 1570. The greatest among the Jesuit missionaries who worked in this area was Fr. Giacomo Fenicio, an Italian, who was Vicar of St. Andrew’s Church, Arthunkal, from 1584 to 1602 and again from 1619 till his death in 1632. He was a pioneer in Indology.\n\nA century of intense mission work of the Jesuits, left the Christian community from Cochin to Purakad considerably increased and provided with several churches, the more important among them being St. Andrew’s Arthunkal (1581). St. Michael’s Kattoor (1590), St. Thomas’ Thumpoly(1600) and St. George’s Manakodam (1640). A few other Churches built during this period were destroyed either by wars or by sea erosion.\n\nAfter the Schism of the Coonan Cross, the St.Thomas Christians of the Mission of St. Andre were reconciled to Rome by Msgr. Guiseppe Sebastiani during his second tour of Malabar in 1662.\n\nEven after the capture of Cochin by the Dutch, the Jesuits continued to look after the Christians of this area till about the middle of the 18th Century. Then the Mission was taken over by the Carmelite Missionaries and remained under the Vicariate of Verapoly till the restoration of the old Cochin diocese in 1886. Because of Arthunkal’s historical importance, tradition and faith of the people His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI declared St. Andrew’s Church as St. Andrew’s Basilica on 21st May 2010 and it was solemnly declared during the Pontifical Mass by Most Rev. Salvatore Pennacchio, Apostolic Nuncio to India on 11th October 2010.\n\nBishop Michael Arattukulam was the first bishop of Alleppey. He passed away on March 20, 1995. Bishop Peter Chenaparambil took over the diocese on 28th April 1984. On his retirement, Bishop Stephen Athipozhiyil assumed office on February 11, 2001.Bishop James Anaparambil was appointed as the Coadjutor Bishop of Alleppey on 7th December 2017.\n\nArea: 333 sq. kms.Population:1,63,900Catholics:16,5680Languages:Malayalam\n\nAmbikapur\n\nHISTORY\n\nAlready in the time of the great pioneer, Fr Constant Lievens, sj, (approx. 1890) delegates from Surguja went 200 kms on foot to Ranchi and begged to be instructed, catechized and begged to get catechists and to be visited by a Priest regularly. But the feudal rulers persecuted those who had been instructed and neither catechists nor a Priest could be sent.\n\nIn the beginning of 1948 the feudal states merged into India and the few Catholics who had settled in Surguja were joined by many who came from Jashpur and Barway in search of land, jobs and livelihood. Missionaries came to visit these settlers. From Kanjia in Bihar, Jodhpur was started in 1947. Four other mission stations: Ambika, Banea, Ratasili and Shantipara (Basen) were established in 1952. As the Independence dawned Christianity saw the light brighter and brighter.\n\nThe Diocese of Ambikapur was erected on December 14, 1977 by dismemberment form Raigarh-Ambikapur diocese. The diocese is co-extensive with the present civil districts of Surguja and Korea in the northern part of the State of Chhattisgarh.\n\nRight Rev.

Christianity began in Balasore probably during the years 1859 -1865 when church activities were started by Fr Chrysanthus Depart in Midnapur - Balasore area. He settled down at Balasore in 1865. From 1865 till 1936 the Jesuit Fathers residing at Balasore and Krishnachandrapur looked after the Church in Balasore. From 1936 onwards till 1938 there were no residential priests in Balasore and the two church work stations were looked after by the Jesuits of Balasore. Due to an earthquake the church was damaged and later completely dismantled. The Fathers left for Malta and gradually many Christians left Balasore. In 1948 Fathers Vizjak, a Jesuit Priest, resided at Krishnachandrapur and Balasore alternatively and cared for the needs of the little community which stayed back. From 1964 till 1968 Diocesan Priests from the Diocese of Cuttack rendered their services in Balasore, Krishnachandrapur and in Barbil at the request of the Archbishop of Calcutta.\n\nOn June 8, 1968, the Holy See separated the above mentioned three districts from the Archdiocese of Calcutta and formed them into one unit named \"Prefecture of Balasore\", annexing it to the ecclesiastical Province of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar. The new Prefecture is entrusted to \"Congregation of the Mission\". (Vincentians).\n\nOn June 14, 1968, Bp Jacob Vadakeveetil, cm, of the Congregation of the Mission was appointed the first Apostolic Administrator and took charge on November 18, 1968. On January 13, 1990 the Prefecture Apostolic was raised to the status of a diocese and Bp Thomas Thiruthalil, cm, was appointed its First Bishop.\n\nRev. Fr.

Mysore was the title and Bangalore was the headquarters of the Diocese. All along the second part of the 19th century and the ?rst half of the 20th the Foreign Mission Society, under successive Bishops, developed a network of churches, schools, convents and colleges. Thus they prepared Bangalore to become an Archdiocese, a great capital and a cosmopolitan city.\n\nThe Christian infrastructure of Bangalore owes much to the French Fathers, Servanton Circle in Cantonment area and The Briand Square near City Market perpetuate the memory of the Founders. The above two, along with the following, viz., SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER’S CATHEDRAL whose ?rst Parish Priest was Fr. Jarrige in 1842, and SAINT JOSEPH’S CHURCH built by Fr. Bigot-Beauclair in 1851-1852, SAINT MARY’S BASILICA, started as the ?rst church in Bangalore, was built as we see it now, by Fr. Kleiner between 1875 and 1882 before he was made Bishop. The SACRED HEART CHURCH was completed in 1895 by Fr. Combret. The then Cathedral, SAINT PATRICK’S CHURCH was completed by Fr. Gailhot in 1844 and renovated by the illustrious Fr. Tabard who was its Parish Priest from 04.12.1891 till 12.04.1925. He is buried inside the church. The SAINT PETER’S SEMINARY at Malleswaram, now a Philosophy and Theology Faculty and Centre for Canon Law, was established in Pondicherry in 1777 by Bishop Brigot, ?rst MEP Superior of the Malabar Mission. The Seminary was shifted to Bangalore in 1934. SAINT JOSEPH’S COLLEGE was founded in 1882 by MEP Fathers. It was handed over to the Society of Jesus on 1st June, 1937.\n\nBy the Bull “Felicius Increscente” (happily growing), Pope Pius XII created on 13th February 1940 the Diocese of Bangalore, carving it out the Diocese of Mysore. Most Rev. Bishop Maurice Bernard Benoit Joseph was appointed as the ?rst Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Bangalore and St. Francis Xavier’s Church was designated as the Cathedral. Most Rev. Dr. Thomas Pothacamury who was the Bishop of Guntur was transferred to Bangalore and became the First Indian Bishop of Bangalore in 1942. The Cathedral was consecrated on 24th January 1948.\n\nOn 19th September 1953, Pope Pius XII issued the decree “Mutant Res” (things are changing) by which Bangalore was elevated to Archdiocese.\n\nOn 14th November, 1988, the Diocese of Shimoga was created to which Bangalore Archdiocese ceded the civil district of Chitradurga. Thus the Archdiocese of Bangalore now comprises six civil districts of Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkaballapura, Kolara, Ramanagara and Tumakuru. These cover an area of 27,123 sq km with a total population of 1,71,65,595 as per the census of 2011. Currently the Catholic Christian population is 3,78,869 (2018).\n\nMost Rev.

In 1601, they established their headquarters at Agra. In 1619, the Jesuit Missionaries were in Rajasthan, but the ruler there did not encourage the Christian message to spread. The Jesuit Missionaries were invited to Patna in 1620. There were a few Catholic Portuguese soldiers in the army. A Church was built and the foundation for a Catholic community was laid. When Capuchin Missionaries arrived in Patna in 1706 on their way to Tibet, they found about 150 Catholics.\n\nIn 1773, when the Jesuit Congregation was suppressed, two Carmelite Fathers from Bombay succeeded them in Agra, who in turn were replaced by the Capuchins. Ever since, the Capuchin Missionaries have laboured relentlessly for the spread of the faith and the progress of the Catholic Church in north India. The year 1885 marks the beginning of the long process of divisions and sub-divisions of the Tibet-Hindustan region which led to the creation of not less than thirty ecclesiastical units of north India.\n\nIn the year of the Lord nineteen hundred and eighty nine, on the nineteenth day of the month of January, His Holiness John Paul II, the Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church took the momentous decision of erecting a new Diocese-the Diocese of Bareilly and promulgated the Bull “Indorum Inter Gentes”. By this Bull, six districts of the Diocese of Lucknow in the state of Uttar Pradesh namely, Bareilly, Nainital, Almora, Pithoragarh, Shahjahanpur and Pilibhit were carved out to form the new Diocese of Bareilly having the church of St. Alphonsus as its Cathedral. The Diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Agra.\n\nOn the same day, the Holy Father appointed and proclaimed Very Rev. Anthony Fernandes, Vicar General of the Diocese of Varanasi as the Bishop-elect of the newly erected Diocese, by promulgating the Bull “Eodem Animi Pastoralis”.\n\nThus was fulfilled the long cherished dream of the late Bishop Conrad de Vito, OFM Cap, the first Bishop of Lucknow who, with remarkable foresight and vision had realized that the work of evangelizing and spreading the Gospel could not be achieved in an effective and concerted way if one pastor alone was given the care of the fourteen districts of his diocese. With the creation of the new state of Uttarakhand and with the further division of the districts the Catholic Diocese of Bareilly now comprises of nine districts of two Northern States, viz. districts of Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Pilibhit from the State Uttar Pradesh and the Districts of Udham Singh Nagar, Nainital, Almora, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Champawat from the State of Uttarakhand.\n\nBishop Anthony Fernandes served the Diocese of Bareilly for over 25 years with missionary zeal and commitment. During his tenure as Bishop the diocese spread its mission areas in the field of Education, health and social work. A special feature of his mission work was encouraging Ashram and the care of Christ-Bhaktas.\n\nPope Francis on Friday 11th July 2014 appointed Rev. Fr. Ignatius D’ Souza, Vicar General of the Diocese of Lucknow, as the Bishop of Bareilly succeeding Emeritus Bishop Anthony Fernandes. He served the faithful of Lucknow diocese for close to 24 years and has a wealth of gifts and experiences with him for his episcopal ministry. In a moving and joyful celebration of the Mass, Bishop Ignatius D’ Souza was consecrated and formally installed as the second Roman Catholic Bishop of Bareilly, on Saturday, October 4, 2014. Bishop Ignatius chose the motto “Serve the Lord with Gladness” (Psalm 100:2). This phrase prescribes a rule of worship. It reflects the steadfastness and the unfettered responsiveness to the will of God that he would cultivate in his life. The service of God is a source of highest joy with this new vigour and zeal Bishop Ignatius D’ Souza has begun to carry ahead the mission of the Lord.\n\nThe Catholic population of Bareilly Diocese is 7,460. The Diocesan clergy is 58. There are 34 Religious Priests, 10 Religious Brothers and 329 Religious Sisters in the service of the Diocese.\n\nRight Rev.

For all practical purposes this Indianised version \"Vadodara\" has come to stay ever since the Central Government replaced the names of many of the big cities in India given by the British with Indigenous names and made it mandatory in all correspondence. In a way, \"Vadodara\" is more appropriate and meaningful. 'Vad' means a banyan tree. Legend has it that there was a banyan tree whose overhanging roots spread so far and wide that it was later difficult to identify the mother tree.\n\nVery much like the Baroda Diocese. Only an appendix to the Archdiocese of Bombay till 1965, it was established as an independent diocese in 1966 by Pope Paul VI.\n\nIn matter of just three and half decades, the diocese has swelled to 38 Parish Centres of which 23 are located in rural areas. There are a total of 117 Institutes and 22 Women Religious Congregations, 5 Men Religious Orders, a veritable growth and our incessant efforts to spread the Kingdom of God to the far corners of Gujarat continue unabated.\n\nWe are engaged in multifarious activities covering a vast spectrum-spiritual, educational, social, economical, cultural, agricultural and ecological. In short everything that pertains to human development and the upliftment of the poor, needy, marginalized, the downtrodden has been our deep concern.\n\nWhilst much, no doubt has been done, the diocese has a healthy restlessness to find ways to identify itself more with the tribal community since the mission of Gujarat is predominantly tribal.\n\nSome five decades ago our tribal community lived a relative peace and harmony, in spite of having the bare minimum to subsist on. They were a happy lot. Thick jungles, evergreen forests, water in rivers and springs, deer and peasants, panthers and tigers were plenty, The trees provided them with a home and tool for survival. The fish and the wild fowl were their food. A small plot of land provided cereals as food and cotton to weave their minimal loincloth. The tribal chief ensured that peace prevailed, a sufficient and simple world.\n\nNot for long, however, with the passage of time technological progress has set in. Roads, doubtless provide facilities but they also mean invasion. Forests are denuded, the hills are eroded, the rivers dried, and the flora and fauna disappeared. Outsiders opened shops, started money lending, exploitation and gradually governed the economy. The tribal world started disintegrating. Their idyllic world was shattered. The Sphinx-like dictum now is \"struggle or be devoured\". Of late, to cap it, the peaceful atmosphere has been further disrupted and vitiated by certain hard core religious fundamentalist groups who are hell-bent on stirring up trouble.\n\nThe cry of the tribals cannot be ignored be it an economical cry for survival or a socio-political cry or a cultural cry that the Church in Gujarat reaches out and responds to the tribal community.\n\nIt is to this cry of the tribals that the Death-Resurrection Mystery of Christ invites us to share and break bread by being with them. In short it is faith that gives us a vision and the sustenance to create a just society, a process in which we grow as much as they in the struggle for liberation.\n\nHowever we are also aware of by our limitations. We cater to only a small section of the tribal belt in Gujarat. There are disturbing question we face and have to be addressed. How best can we serve the interests of the tribals? Are we capable of really feeling the pulse of the tribals - their aspirations and hopes, their worldview, their psychological profile? Where is the delicate line between a ruthless exposure and a stifling insulation? How best to walk the tight rope between relief measures and development? Between avoiding dependency and creating self-reliance and organizing self-direction? How do we create a relevant local Church? And yet we believe that as in the Exodus experience, the process of the traveler, the pilgrim Church is in God's hands. He is aware of our needs, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not more clothe you, Oh men of little faith.\"\n\nRight Rev.

Msgr. Patrick Carew was appointed as the Vicar Apostolic. In 1840, the first missionary, Fr. Zubiburu, a Spanish Carmelite went to Koikhali, a small village along with Mr. Crow, the District Magistrate. He built a catholic community of 278 members. However, Fr. Zubiburu, could not continue his work owing to bad health and left the place.\n\nThe Belgian Jesuits came to Bengal in 1859. In 1868 at the invitation of Kala Chand (Stanislas), Fr. Goffinet S.J. went to a small village called Gokurni near Magra Hat. A few days later in July 1868, he baptized a little girl of six in Magra Hat which was the happy passage for the Christian community in 24 Parganas. From there Fr. Goffinet SJ went to Koikhali and resumed the missionary work started by Fr. Zubiburu, Under Msgr. Steins SJ. It was Father E. Delplace SJ the pioneer, who went around establishing five Mission Stations in four years such as Raghabpur, Morapai, Basanti,Khari and Baidyapur (1873-1877). In 1886 the Vicariate Apostolic became the Archdiocese of Calcutta.\n\nThe Yugoslav Jesuit Priests were invited to come to Bengal and to take charge of 24 Parganas District. That move marked the new beginning of the Sunderbans' Mission. They started new mission stations or re-opened old ones; they built churches and chapels and gradually injected new life in the existing Catholic communities. After the war, unfortunately, the doors were closed and no new missionaries could come in. Later the Belgian Jesuits and Indian priests took over the missions. The tenure of Archbishop V. Dyer (1960-1962) and Archbishop A. D'Souza (1962-1969) witnessed further bifurcations of the Archdiocese of Calcutta into the dioceses of Jamshedpur, Darjeeling and Dumka.\n\nBy the Bull, Ad Supernam, Pope Paul VI created on 12 March 1978 the diocese of Baruipur, detaching from the Archdiocese of Calcutta the Southern and Central Portion of the civil district commonly known as the 24 Parganas and the civil territories called Thana. Bishop Linus Nirmal. Gomes was ordained as first Bishop of Baruipur Diocese on Saturday, November 19, 1977. Rt. Rev. Linus Nirmal Gomes SJ submitted his resignation to the Holy Father due to ill health after leading the diocese as the good shepherd for 18 years. Holy Father accepted his resignation with effect from October 31, 1995. Consequently, Rev. Fr. Salvadore Lobo was elected the Administrator of the Diocese. He was later appointed the Bishop of Baruipur by the Holy See on Friday, November 14, 1997 and was ordained a Bishop on Thursday, January 29, 1998.\n\nUnder the leadership of Bishop Salvadore Lobo as a good shepherd, there has been a steady growth in the diocese. Past twenty years of his service has witnessed many milestones in the diocese.

It was on February 14, 1958 that the Holy See by the Decree Prot. 534/43, further extended the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Tiruvalla to the whole of Malabar Region of Kerala, the Civil Districts of Coimbatore, Nilgiris and Karur Taluk in Tiruchirapally Districts of Tamilnadu and the Districts of Mysore, Mandya, Hassan, Coorg, Chickmangalore, Shimoga and South Kanara in Karnataka.\n\nAfter the extension of the Dicoese, a few priests were sent to the new regions by His Excellency late Zacharias Mar Athanasios, the third Bishop of Tiruvalla. These pioneers of the Malabar Mission began to work zealously among the Malankara faithful, concentrating on a few centres like Bathery, Mananthavady, Nilambur, Edakkara, Karuvarakundu and Maikavu. In 1963 Mar Athanasios sent two priests to South Kanara (Karnataka) to work among the Malankara faithful who had migrted from Kerala. Desiring to establish the identity of the Malankara Catholic Church and to accelerate the Reunion Movement in the newly organized territories, His Excllency Zacharias Mar Athanasios requested the Holy See to bifurcate the Diocese of Tiruvalla and to erect a new Diocese with SulthanBathery as its headquarters. His Holiness Pope John Paul responded to the request and erected the new Diocese of Bathery on October 28, 1978 at Mar Theophilos Nagar (St. Thomas Malankara Catholic Church Campus, Thirumoolapuram) Tiruvalla, by His Grace Benedict Mar Gregorios, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Trivandrum and arch bishop of the Malankara Catholic Church.\n\nIt was on February 2, 1979 that His Excellency Most Rev. Cyril Mar Baselios, the first Bishop of Bathery, officially took charge of the Diocese. The Enthronement (Sunthroniso) ceremony took place at the St. Thomas Pro-Cathedral at SulthanBathery. The existing 8,500 Malankara Catholics were organised in 43 Parishes and Mission Stations by zealous and committed priests of whom 18 belonged to the Diocese of Tiurvalla and 2 belonged to the Bethany Ashram. 13 Bethany Sisters and 17 Sisters of the Deena Sevanasabha also gave valuable services in different parts of the Diocese. After serious thoughts and prayerful reflection, it was concluded that the most urgent need in the Diocese was nothing but proper community formation both in its ecclesial and social sense. The Archdiocese of Trivandrum and the Diocese of Tiruvalla had generously given the services of some of their zealous and active priests. Thousands of families, besides some prominent priests came into the full communion of the Catholic Church. Many Parishes and Mission Stations were opened. Infact, many people from the Sister Churches requested the Diocese to start the Malankara Catholic Mission Stations in their locality.\n\nMar Baselios instituted a few departments for the effective realization of the goals set by the Diocese. There were the departments of Cahtechetics, Youth, Family and Bible which were instituted in view of forming and uniting the whole people, namely, children, Youth Men and women, of the Diocese. The Diocese also gave due importance to its social commitment, taking seriously the life situation of the people around. The Diocese chalked out a social programme aimed at promoting the integral growth of men and women. The Social Service Centre, named Shreyas, which is the official organ of the Diocese of promoting justice and fellowship, is instituted in view of creating a more human and just society, based on Gospel values, through a scientific programme of mass education, mass mobilization and mass action. The Diocese also started few educational institutions under the Corporate Educational Agency of the Dicese to impart a value based education to the youth in the Diocese irrespective of caste and creed.\n\nAfter 17 years of inspiring leadership in the Diocese, His Excellency Mar Baselios left for Trivandrum on December 12, 1995 as he was appointed Metropolitan Archbishop of Trivandrum and the Head of the Malankara Catholic Church. His Grace Cyril Mar Baselios took charge of the Church and of the Archdiocese of Trivandrum on December 14, 1995.\n\nFrom December 14, 1995 till February 5, 1997 the Diocese was led by Msgr. Thomas Thannickakuzhy as its Aministrator. On December 18 1996 His Holiness Pope John Paul II appointed Very Rev. Dr. Varghese Ottathengil, the then Rector of St. Mary's Malankara Major Seminary, Trivandrum as the new Bishop of Bathery. Msgr. Varghese Ottathengil was consecrated a Bishop on February 5, 1996 at Mar Athanasios Nagar, Bathery (St. Joseph's School Ground) by His Grace Mar Baselios, the Head of the Malankara Catholic Church.\n\nMsgr.

The Diocese of Bellary owes its faith and growth to the Franciscan fathers. Thanks to the efforts of the pioneering father such as Bishop John Forest Hogan. In 1928, the Holy See detached the two districts of Raichur and Gulbarga from the Diocese of Hyderabad and the district of Bellary from the Archdiocese of Madras-Mylapore and formed the new Mission \"Sui Juris\" of Bellary. It was entrusted to the pastoral care of the Order of Friars Minor of the English Province. In the course of twenty years, its development was considered sufficient to be constituted as a Diocese. This took place in 1949 with Rt. Rev. John Forest Hogan, ofm, as the first Bishop. The Diocese of Bellary now consists of the five districts of Bellary, Raichur, Gulbarga, Koppal and Davanagere all in Karnataka state.\n\nRight Rev.

This diocese has been established for the Syro-Malabar Catholics of the three civil districts of Karnataka State, viz., Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. It took more than 50 years for the Syro-Malabar Catholics living in this area to become a Diocese. It has a prehistory.\n\nIn the middle of the 20 th century there were lot of migrations from Southern Kerala to Northern Kerala, to the southern parts of Karnataka and South Western parts of Tamil Nadu. The migration of Syro-Malabar Catholics to various parts of Karnataka, mainly Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Chickmagalur, Shimoga districts took place in 1950s. The migration to these areas were encouraged by the availability of agriculture land and the encouragement from the then Madras Government.\n\nThe spiritual needs of these Syrian Catholics were met by the Latin Dioceses of Mangalore, Mysore, Chickmagaluru.\n\nThe Diocese of Tellicherry was erected by the Bull ‘Ad Christi Ecclesiam Regendaam’ on 31st December 1953 by His Holiness Pope Pius XII of happy memory, as a suffrogan of the Archdiocese of Ernakulam, for the Catholics of Syro-Malabar Church migrated to Malabar from Travacore and Cochin states. Mar Sebastian Vallopilly became the first Bishop of the Diocese.\n\nAs the Catholics of of the Syro-Malabar community migrated even to the states of Karnataka and Tamilnadu, the boundaries of Tellicherry Diocese were extended to the present Latin Dioceses of Mangalore, Chickmagalur, Mysore, Shimoga and Ootacamund on April 29, 1955.\n\nIn order to overcome the hindrances of language the CMI Fathers came with helping hands and later priests from the Diocese of Tellicherry. The cultural difference especially the language difference was a problem for the priests from Tellicherry for the fruitful pastoral activities here. So the development of the parishes in Karnataka remained far behind comparing to the parishes in Kerala.\n\nIn March 1, 1973, the Diocese of Mananthavady was formed by bifurcating the Diocese of Tellicherry.\n\nThe territory of the new Diocese was extended to the districts of Shimoga, Chickmagaluru, Hassan, Mandya, Chamarajanagara and Mysore in Karnataka. The districts of Dakshina Kannada (including present Udupi District) and Kodagu remained under the Diocese of Tellicherry.\n\nAs Dakshina Kannada (including present Udupi District) is in Karnataka State with a different language and culture, it was difficult to cater to the spiritual needs of the faithful directly from Thalassery. Hence it was declared a Mission Province of the Archdiocese of Thalasserry on the 11 th November 1979 by Mar Sebastian Vallopilly and appointed Very Rev. Fr. K.M. Peter as the Episcopal Vicar of the Mission. Very Rev. Fr. Peter Koottiany was the Episcopal Vicar of D.K.Mission till May 16, 1997. During the 18 years of his able and dedicated leadership the D. K. Mission grew to become a Diocese later.\n\nVery Rev. Fr. Lawrence Mukkuzhy succeeded Very Rev. Fr. K.M. Peter as the Second Episcopal Vicar on the same day. The Mission grew up and finally in April 24, 1999, the Diocese of Belthangady was erected by the Papal Bull “CUM AMPLA” of His Holiness Pope John Paul II as a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Thalasserry and Msgr. Lawrence Mukkuzhy was appointed as the first Bishop of the Diocese. This Diocese has been established for the Syro-Malabar Catholics of the three civil districts of Karnataka State, viz., Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. The diocese was inaugurated on 4th August 1999.\n\nRight Rev.

By 1845 the region of Odisha was already under Visakhapatnam Diocese and the missionaries of St. Francis de Sales, msfs evangelized the hilly regions of the then Ganjam and Phulbani Districts and the coastal belt of Cuttack and Berhampur. However, with due the hard missionary life and unhygienic conditions of the hilly region, many young missionaries succumbed to tropical deceases like Malaria & Black fever in the mission fields. Therefore, after the World War I, in 1923, they handed over the Cuttack Mission, as it was known then, to the Congregation of the Mission, the Spanish Vincentian missionaries. Under the Vincentian Missionaries the Cuttack Mission progressed in leaps and bounds. It was declared \"Missio Sui Juris\" by Pope Pius XI on July 18, 1928 and Fr Valerian Guemes, CM, was appointed its Administrator and Ecclesial Superior.\n\nIn 1937 Cuttack Mission was raised to the status of a Diocese and Rt. Rv. Florence Esperanza CM as the first Bishop of the Diocese of Cuttack. After his retirement, Bishop Paul Tobar, CM was appointed as the second Bishop in 1948. On 24th January 1974, Pope Paul VI, by the Papal Bull 'Verba Jesus Christi', bifurcated the Diocese of Cuttack and created the Diocese of Berhampur with the present eight civil Districts of South Odisha: Ganjam, Gajapati, Nuapoda, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangapur, Malkangiri and Kalahandi. Simultaneously, Odisha Ecclesiastical Province was created with Cuttack-Bhubaneswar as the Archdiocese, the new name of the Diocese of Cuttack, and the Diocese of Berhampur was placed as one of its suffragan Dioceses. Bishop Thomas Thiruthalil, CM. was installed on 23rd June 1974 as the first Bishop of Berhampur. In January 1990 he was transferred to the newly erected Diocese of Balasore and Rev. Fr. Joseph Das was appointed as the Administrator of the Diocese of Berhampur, who was later consecrated Bishop of Berhampur on 7th July 1994. Bishop Das retired in 2006.\n\nThe present Bishop Rt. Rev. Sarat Chandra Nayak was consecrated on 30th January 2007 as the third Bishop of Berhampur, with his motto: “To be a happy servant.” Accepting the request of the Diocese, Pope Francis bifurcated the Diocese of Berhampur and created a new Diocese of Rayagada on 11th April 2016. Rt. Rev. Bishop Aplinar Senapati, CM was consecrated on 28th May 2016 as the first Bishop of Rayagada, comprising six civil Districts: Nuapoda, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangapur, Malkangiri and Kalahandi, The Diocese of Berhampur has now 2 civil Districts: Ganjam & Gajapati.

This decision came about because the reports from travelers that were received in Rome said that there were Christian communities in Asia somewhere between India and China. In the sixteenth century the Society of Jesus tried to start a mission in Tibet. They found no such communities and they abandoned the plan because of the great difficulties of the journey.\n\nIn 1637 French Capuchins of the Tours Province came from Syria to Surat in India and hearing the same story of Christian communities somewhere between India and China and not knowing of the failure of the Jesuits, also wanted to go there and help those communities which, however, were never found. This attempt also failed.\n\nIn the decree of the Congregation of the Propaganda mentioned above the territory was vaguely described in such a way that if the Tibet Mission failed, the missionaries could still work in the area on the left bank of the Ganges River. This mission was assigned to the Italian Capuchins.\n\nFive priests and one brother were assigned to the mission and these left Europe on January 25, 1707. Except for the leader of the group all were between the ages of 30 and 35. Three died on the way and these were replaced two years later by three more. The missionaries managed to reach Chandernagore in Bengal where the French had a trading center.\n\nThe route to Tibet went from Chandernagore through Patna and Kathmandu. In Patna at that tome there were about one million inhabitants and there were trading posts of the Dutch, French and English. Many of these foreigners were Christians but there were no local Christians. It was decided that a priest should stay in Patna and minister to the Christians there.\n\nThe missionaries reached Lhasa in late 1707 but after a few years had to leave because of sickness and lack of money. The mission was again started in 1716, then closed again in 1733 and reopened in 1738. A few Tibetans became Christian but because they refused to follow the customs of their former religion, they were severely beaten and the authorities turned against the missionaries and they were finally forced to leave in 1745.\n\nIn the meantime, Fr. Joseph Mary Bernini from Gargnono while in Patna for a short time was asked to go to Bettiah to treat a member of the local king’s family. The patient was cured and the king asked the Pope to send missionaries to his kingdom to serve his subjects and to preach their religion. Fr. Joseph Mary was the one chosen for this mission which was formally begun in December 1745.\n\nIn 1768 Fr. Joseph of Rovato was made the Prefect Apostolic of the Tibet Mission and he made his headquarters in Patna. In 1784 the northern part of the Vicariate of the Great Mogul was attached to the Prefecture of Tibet. In 1820 the center of the mission was shifted to Agra which was raised to the status of a Vicariate. This was because other Capuchin missionaries were working in Mhow, Indore, and Gwalior and had their headquarters in Agra. Thus these two missions became one.\n\nIn 1844 Athanasius Hartmann, OFM Cap, a Swiss Capuchin, arrived in Agra. On February 7, 1845 the Agra Vicariate was divided and the civil Province of Bihar, of which the main stations were Bettiah, Chakhni, Chuhari, Patna, Dinapore, Bhagalpur, Monghyr and Purnea, Nepal and Sikkim, was made into the independent Vicariate of Patna. On September 30, 1845 Fr. Hartmann was chosen as the titular Bishop of Derbe and Vicar Apostolic of Patna. After twenty years of strenuous work in a territory that included the present states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh the saintly Bishop Hartmann died in Patna on April 24, 1866. He was succeeded by Bishop Paul Tossi, OFM Cap and then by Bishop Francis Pesci, OFM Cap.\n\nIn 1886 Bishop Pesci moved his see from Patna to Allahabad and the North Bihar Mission, with four stations (Bettiah. Chakhni, Chuhari and Latonah), was entrusted to the Tyrolese Capuchins in the same year.\n\nOn April 20, l892 the Prefecture Apostolic of Bettiah was established as a suffragan of Agra. It had jurisdiction over the civil districts of Champaran, Saran, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga and those parts of the districts of Bhagalpur and Monghyr that lie north of the Ganges River, i.e. the whole of Bihar north of the Ganges. The first Prefect Apostolic was Fr. Hilarion of Abtei, OFM Cap.\n\nOn May 19,1893 the whole of Nepal was added to this Prefecture.\n\nBy a decree of September 10, 1919 the Diocese of Allahabad was divided and the eastern part became the Diocese of Patna. The Prefecture of Bettiah was dissolved and it became part of the Diocese of Patna. Because of their nationality the Capuchin missionaries were not allowed to continue residing in the territory during the first World War and so the new Patna Mission was entrusted by the Holy See to the Missouri (USA) Province of the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe first Bishop of Patna Diocese was Louis Van Hoeck, S.J. a Belgian Jesuit working in the Ranchi Mission. He was Bishop of Patna from 1921 till 1928 when he became the first Bishop of the Diocese of Ranchi. His successor was Bishop Bernard Sullivan, S.J who guided the diocese from 1929 till 1946. In 1947 Fr. Augustine F. Wildermuth, S.J. was consecrated Bishop of Patna.\n\nIn 1980, when Bishop Wildermuth retired because of age, those parts of Patna Diocese that lie north of the River Ganges were made into the Diocese of Muzaffarpur with John Baptist Thakur,S.J. as the first Bishop.\n\nThen, on June 27, 1998 by the Apostolic Bull “Cum ad Aeternam” His Holiness, Pope John Paul II separated the five Bhojpuri speaking districts in the northwestern part of the state of Bihar from Muzaffarpur Diocese and created the Diocese of Bettiah. The five districts in the new diocese are West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran. Rev. Fr. Victor Henry Thakur, a priest of the Diocese of Raipur was appointed the first Bishop of Bettiah.\n\nBishop Victor Henry Thakur was born and raised in Chakhni in the Diocese of Bettiah but chose to be a missionary in the Raipur Diocese. Thus his return to the diocese as Bishop was quite natural.\n\nThe new diocese did not have a separate residence for the bishop and so the parish priest of Bettiah at that time, Rev. Fr. Julius Lazarus, put four rooms in the presbytery at the disposal of the Bishop and his curia. Part of the Verandah in front of the Bishop’s room was partitioned off and made the Bishop’s office. Thus, till 2007 the Bishop and his helpers were guests of the parish priest of Bettiah. Quarters were congested but fraternity was more than ample\n\nThe Diocese of Bettiah was vacant from July 3 2013 when Bishop Victor Henry Thakur, the bishop of Bettiah was appointed as the Archbishop of Raipur. Then, His Holiness Pope Francis appointed Rev. Fr. Peter Sebastian Goveas, of the clergy of Bhagalpur, as the new Bishop of BETTIAH which was announced on Saturday, 22nd July, 2017 at 3.30pm. The Right Reverend Monsignor Peter Sebastian Goveas was ordained as Bishop for the Diocese of Bettiah on the occasion of the Diwali Festival, Christ the Light of the World on 19th October 2017 at St. Mary’s Cathedral, Bettiah.\n\nThe Church of Bettiah represents the presence of Christ, is a sign of His salvific mission, and a channel of His grace and blessings to the suffering people of the diocese. Already, Rt. Rev. Peter Sebastian Goveas has begun to initiate several socio-pastoral works. Bishop is giving priority to education with the belief that only education can transform the lives of the people because, we enter into direct relationship and interact with the children and the youth in order to help them for their integral growth based on the Gospel values of love, peace, equality and dignity which will make them right self esteem and feel good about themselves and cherish God’s beautiful gift of their life. “Therefore the whole thrust is Education of the marginalized especially girls, to help them to rediscover the inner power within them. That inner force will empower them to look at the future positively and as a result it will transform their whole life.”\n\nHe is reviving Diocesan commissions, committees and councils. He is interested in expanding the mission work in remote places of the Diocese. We thank God for the Gift of Rt. Rev. Peter Sebastian Goveas Bishop of Bettiah as a shepherded of the Catholic Church of Bettiah and his abundant blessings on us.\n\n1.

They used to rest in Patna for some time on their way to and from Lhasa and for this reason a small church was built in Patna City which served the spiritual needs of the European soldiers and traders who came to the city from time to time. Among these missionaries was Joseph Mary Bernini who was adept at medicine. His fame spread as far as Bettiah 225 kms away from Patna City. In 1740 or 174l a member of the royal household in Bettiah was ill and no doctor was able to effect a cure. Having heard of Fr. Joseph Mary, the Raja, Drup Narayan Singh, asked him to come to Bettiah to see the patient. Fr. Joseph Mary came to Bettiah, and treated the patient who recovered. The Raja was so impressed by the priest that he asked him to start a mission in his kingdom. Fr. Joseph Mary told him that he could do so only if the Pope in Rome would give the order for this. Hence, in 1741 Raja Drup Narayan Singh wrote to the Holy Father in Rome asking that priests be sent to Bettiah to establish a mission there and preach their religion. On May 1, 1742 Pope Benedict XIV replied to the king and assured him that he would send Capuchin priests to work in Bettiah. Thus on December 7, 1745 Fr. Joseph Mary arrived in Bettiah and on the next day, the feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary the mission of Bettiah was inaugurated next to the royal palace on land which the king gave to the mission.\n\nDuring the time of Fr. Joseph Mary in Bettiah forty adults embraced the Catholic faith, thus establishing the first indigenous Christian community in present day Bihar.\n\nThe first church was built in 1751. In 1830 a new church with three naves and three altars which could accommodate a thousand people was blessed. This church served the Christians of Bettiah till it fell in the earthquake of 1934. A new church was constructed in 1951 by Fr. Kevin Angelo, S.J.\n\nIn 1886 a middle school for Christian boys was built in the mission compound. In 1922 a school for girls was opened in the parish. In June 1926 it was decided to start a high school for boys and class eight was begun on January 4, 1927. Initially here were eleven boys but the number soon grew to twenty-five. The first teachers were Fr. Pettit, S.J., Fr. Alban, Mr. Seraphim Barno, and Mr. Lakshman Misra. In May of that year Scholastic Paul Dent, S.J. was added to the staff.\n\nOn March 25, 1922 the grotto was blessed by Bishop Van Hoeck, S.J.\n\nOn March 19, 1928 the foundation of the new Middle School building was blessed.\n\nIn January 1934 Bettiah suffered from an earthquake. The church fell and other buildings were badly damaged.\n\nFr. Kevin Angelo, S.J., the parish priest began work on a new church which was completed in 1951.\n\nOn July 10, 1955 a Credit Union was started which continues to benefit the people of the parish.\n\nOn November, 5, 1957 the new St. Aloysius Pathshala was inaugurated. Until this time classes for the small children were conducted in the priests’ old bungalow or in the old church.\n\nOn October 26, 1959 a new hall at the northern end of the compound was inaugurated and furnished with a number of tables and chairs.\n\nMany priests have served the people of the parish but the two who are most remembered are Fr. Kevin Angelo, S.J., the parish priest, and Fr. Vincent McGlinchy, S.J. the headmaster of the Middle School. These two, working together for about thirty years, have made a lasting impact on the lives of the people.\n\n2.

In l874 there was a severe famine in Bihar and many people died. The government sent about two hundred orphans to the missions in Bettiah and Chuhari to be cared for. When these children became adults it was necessary to help them settle in life. The mission in Bettiah was able to purchase 270 bighas of land in Chakhni from the government. Fr. Alexander, O.F.M. Cap. with some of the orphans from Chuhari went there to clear the land for a church, some simple houses and for farming.\n\nIn the beginning this station was very bad for health and the missionary often suffered from malarial fever. After two years the construction of a larger and safer house was begun with the help of the Vicar Apostolic. On this construction abut 8000 rupees were spent. In 1889 Fr. Alexander was transferred to Allahabad, leaving the new house incomplete. Afterwards it was completed by the new missionaries. There was a small orphanage but in 1891 a new one was built. Since with the increase of families and of orphans and neophytes the provisional chapel was insufficient and unworthy for religious celebrations, in 1898 Fr. Gerold began the construction of a larger and more beautiful church with three naves and two towers. It was completed in 1901 at the cost of 10,000.00 rupees. Finally on December 15, 1901 the Prefect Apostolic at the time of the Jubilee Triduum blessed the church solemnly according to the rite of the Roman Ritual and gave it the name of the Holy Family. On this occasion the Christians rejoiced greatly. In 1902 Fr. Gerold went to Europe and on his return to the mission brought with him four bells.\n\nThis church, which was blessed by the Prefect Apostolic, Fr. Hilarion OFN Cap on December 15, 190l, withstood the onslaught of the 1934 earthquake is still standing.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Sisters came to Chakhni in February, 1932. The first sisters, Sr. Maria, Sr. Josepha and Sr. Aloysia, started a middle school, took care of the boy and girl orphans and also old people who had no one to take care of them. At present, in addition to teaching in the school, the sisters help in the parish.\n\nIn 1993 a co-educational high school was started with the name of Fr. Pettit Memorial High School.
