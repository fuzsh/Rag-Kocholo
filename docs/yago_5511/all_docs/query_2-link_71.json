To realize her vision, Bryce recruited family friend Claire Thomas to mastermind the decoration of the four-bedroom, two-story new-build. “We immediately knew that the core color palette for the house was going to be pink and green,” Thomas says. “I always joke that I only use redhead colors—that is, colors that redheads look great in. I’m a redhead and Bryce is a redhead so it works.” Shop Bryce and Seth’s home style!Honor nature the Bryce and Seth way—with lots of interesting floral arrangements and house plants:(Similar) Pampas Grass Bouquet: https://fave.co/3aKde20(Similar) Fernwood Mikado Snake Plant: https://fave.co/3zi2Okr(Similar) Unplanted Gromeo Vertical Planter: https://fave.co/3MpuhTW(Similar) Silk Cherry Blossom Stem: https://fave.co/3GYt996(Similar) Real Touch Poppy White Navy Center: https://fave.co/3GTaB9WLove the couple’s wallpaper moments?

        "text": "Hey AD.\n\nHello, hello, hello.\n\nWelcome to California.\n\nMy name is Bryce Dallas Howard, and this is my house.\n\nCome on, check it out.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo when folks come by to visit,\n\nusually the first thing they notice\n\nand ask about are the pet portraits.\n\nThey're by Michael Harnish.\n\nI love these because I love my pets.\n\nI'm actually directing a documentary right now\n\nfor Disney+ called Pets.\n\nAll of the light fixtures in the home are by Lightology.\n\nI love this light fixture.\n\nIt just reminds me of the ocean.\n\nThe console is by Anthropologie,\n\nand there's a beautiful vintage piece here.\n\nThe next room I'm excited to show you is right through here.\n\n[light music]\n\nThis office, we could call our office,\n\nbut the truth is is that it's Seth's office.\n\nWe share though.\n\nShe's in here a lot.\n\n[Bryce laughs]\n\nYeah, yeah I am.\n\nI creep in here all the time 'cause I love it.\n\nSo the inspiration for me\n\ninitially came from Star Trek: The Next Generation,\n\nbut we were kind of going for a retro futurism,\n\nlike a 1980s depiction of what the future would look like.\n\nKind of an amalgamation of Bow house and art deco\n\nand neo futuristic vibes,\n\nand I feel like Claire Thomas, who we're working with,\n\nhelped make that here,\n\nand I think it's absolutely incredible.\n\nSo with the window treatments,\n\nI had done a Picasso series and fell in love with cubism,\n\nand as you'll see throughout the house,\n\nwe have a lot of nods to different jobs that we've done\n\nand work that we love,\n\nand so we put the Picasso vibes in here.\n\nSo this is one of my favorite things in the house\n\nthat Bryce finally allowed me to get.\n\nI've been craving a neon clock for a very long time.\n\nI've loved neon clocks and this is from the 1930s,\n\nfrom Germany, and it does this awesome thing.\n\nGo for it.\n\nI mean, how cool is that?\n\nWe love nature, we love plants, we love green,\n\nand so making sure that we had a lot of plants in the home\n\nwas very important to us.\n\nSo the inspiration was late Cretaceous period,\n\nso hence this bad boy over here.\n\n[Seth] Yeah, prehistoric vibes to the plant life.\n\n[Bryce] Everywhere, yeah.\n\n[Seth] Yeah.\n\n[light music]\n\nSo this is the dining room\n\nand we were really inspired by a few things,\n\nbut specifically Miyazaki, the filmmaker Miyazaki.\n\nWe really wanted this room to feel like nature\n\nand to feel like a forest and to feel like starry night\n\nand clouds, to just really feel like we were outside.\n\nWe have incredible wallpaper, it's by Schumacher,\n\nand it makes me feel like I'm in a magical forest in Japan.\n\nThe rug is from Armadillo and Co, and I love their ethos.\n\nThey're a pro-social company\n\nand that's very, very, very important to me,\n\nespecially in a room like this\n\nwhere we're trying to honor the planet.\n\nOur ceilings are actually an antique brass\n\nand it's really beautiful because it reflects the light.\n\nAgain, a fixture by Lightology,\n\nand this kind of just reminded us of stars\n\nbecause it reflected the ceiling.\n\nIt's just kind of scrumptious.\n\n[light music]\n\nSo Claire Thomas and I love a loud powder room.\n\nInstead of kind of ripping out all this tile and whatnot,\n\nwe decided to work with it,\n\nand so here's some beautiful wallpaper\n\nthat has special meaning for my husband and I.\n\nWe met in the early aughts,\n\nand when we had just been dating for a couple of months,\n\nI went to go do a theater program in Amsterdam.\n\nOne of the things that Amsterdam is known for\n\nis their beautiful tulip fields.\n\nSort of in an homage to the beginning of our relationship,\n\nwe decided to have sort of a tulip theme\n\nthroughout the house.\n\nSo that's the story of the loud powder room.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo this piece is from Tap In\n\nand we have quite a number of pieces actually\n\nfrom Tap In Collective.\n\nAnd something that was really exciting about Tap In\n\nis that they support living artists, emerging artists,\n\nand it allows someone like myself\n\nwho has zero courage\n\nwhen it comes to becoming an art collector\n\nto actually start to have a collection of our own.\n\n[light music]\n\nHey you.\n\nOh hey, I didn't see you there.\n\nOh, hi.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nSo yeah, so this is the living room.\n\nWe love movies.\n\n[Seth] Yeah.\n\nWe love watching movies as a family.\n\nWe watch Mandalorian a lot on here for sure.\n\nOur coffee table is made by Concrete Collaborative,\n\nwhich is a group of sisters from Australia,\n\nwoman owned company based out of California,\n\nand it's really, really, really beautiful\n\nand carries on this theme of glamorous Cretaceous.\n\n[Seth] We love this terrazzo element\n\nand there's a few other places in the house,\n\nlike the breakfast area, that incorporates that\n\nand it looks really cool.\n\nSo I directed a documentary called Dads\n\na couple of years ago, and when I did Dads,\n\nI interviewed Jimmy Kimmel\n\nand he told me a story about his oldest daughter,\n\nthat was Katie Kimmel, and she's made our lamps\n\nand a few other pieces.\n\nWe have two Abyssinian cats that we're pretty obsessed with,\n\nand this is one of them.\n\nWhen we first came here,\n\nthis all looked like speaker system\n\nand it is hiding speakers,\n\nbut instead of just having that classic black speaker look,\n\nwe shifted this out, added the brass,\n\nput in this kind of beige color back here.\n\nWe brought in a lot of circular elements into the house\n\nto kind of enhance that retro future vibe.\n\nThis is a pillow, it's a custom made pillow.\n\nWe have quite a number of these throughout the house.\n\nThey're really cozy.\n\nThey're great for the lumbar spine.\n\nAnd Claire has called them pearl pillows,\n\nso that is what they shall be called.\n\n[light music]\n\nSo something about the kitchen in general\n\nis that we actually kind of transformed the kitchen,\n\nbut without doing a lot of renovation work.\n\nThese are the original counters and cabinetry,\n\nbut we changed some key things in the kitchen\n\nthat allowed it to be completely transformed.\n\nThe color palette for the entire house\n\nis pretty much pink and green.\n\nThat's really showcased here in the kitchen,\n\nwhere it's just pink and green.\n\nSo the furniture is all Serena and Lily,\n\nwhich is so durable and so easy and so chic\n\nand I absolutely adore it.\n\nFire Clay Tile is a B corp,\n\nwhich means that it's an employee owned company\n\nand they're doing remarkable work.\n\nAnd this tile in particular\n\nis part of their desert collection,\n\nand what they are committed to doing\n\nin particular with the desert collection\n\nis that they are giving a portion of their proceeds\n\nto support the environment around the Sonoran desert.\n\nIt's beautiful tile and it's beautiful for the world,\n\nand that's something that is wonderful.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWe changed out a lot of the plumbing fixtures in the house,\n\nand this one is by Signature Hardware\n\nand we wanted to continue the brass story in the home,\n\nso you see a lot of brass everywhere, which I love.\n\nIt's very nice.\n\nBecause Claire is so, so, so adept at cooking,\n\nwe sort of were like, Just outfit the kitchen, please.\n\nJust tell us what we should have.\n\nAnd so it's not just chic stuff,\n\nthere's, everything looks really nice,\n\nbut it's also very very practical.\n\nSo we've actually been cooking a lot more\n\nnow that we live in this home,\n\nand it was also something\n\nthat we got a little bit better at during the pandemic.\n\nThat's for sure.\n\nIt's a work in progress.\n\nWork in progress.\n\nSo this is the casual breakfast or dinner area.\n\nSo we have another fun table here by Concrete Collaborative,\n\nthose Australian sisters that we love so much.\n\nMy favorite thing is actually behind Bryce right here.\n\nYou might recognize this guy.\n\nThis is baby Yoda.\n\nSo I love baby Yoda.\n\nA lot of people love baby Yoda,\n\nbut I really, really, really love baby Yoda\n\nto the point where I'm sort of like, he's my son,\n\nbecause I've had the tremendous privilege\n\nof directing on the Mandalorian since season one,\n\nand so Claire Thomas went to Katie Kimmel and said,\n\nWe would love to, in addition to having the cat,\n\nwe would love to also have a garlic holder\n\nthat is a baby Yoda.\n\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\nIt's the best. I don't wanna break it.\n\nYeah, don't.\n\n[Bryce laughs]\n\n[light music]\n\nThis is our guest bedroom, and we also use this bedroom\n\nwhen we're on different schedules, which happens...\n\nHappens a lot.\n\nHappens enough of the time, yeah.\n\nOh, we added this Tambour wood to the wall,\n\njust to add some texture, do something cool with it.\n\nAll of the furniture is from Anthropologie.\n\nI love the shape of this because it's kind of like a smile.\n\nIt's really cute.\n\nJust having soothing vibes, something that's relaxing,\n\nespecially if we're using it when we've been working\n\nor overworked and need some time to ourselves.\n\nIt's just kind of something that feels\n\nlike you can recuperate and recover,\n\nand then also have the Everhem shades\n\nto just black out the room and sleep,\n\nif you need to, during the daytime.\n\n[light music]\n\nI am in the guest bathroom right now\n\nand it's more retro futuristic vibes in here.\n\nThis tile is by Lived In,\n\nand one of the things that I love about it\n\nis that it's made out of recyclable materials,\n\nand it's completely the colors of our house.\n\nSo we just love the greens\n\nand kind of the pinks, peachy tones.\n\nAnother sort of fun little detail,\n\nthis looks like the Mandalorian helmet.\n\nSo when I see this tile, I'm like,\n\nOh, Mando, which is fun.\n\n[light music]\n\nWelcome to the main bedroom in the house.\n\nDon't say it.\n\nThis is where the magic happens.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nI've wanted to say that for our entire relationship.\n\nMm.\n\nThis has been a running joke.\n\nNow that you've gotten it out of your system.\n\nNow that I've gotten out of my system.\n\nI just wanna say that this is where the magic happens.\n\nShe said it again.\n\nMm.\n\nAnd all the furniture in here is from Lulu and Georgia,\n\nand it's beautiful and it's so cozy\n\nand I think this is my favorite room.\n\nIt's really soothing.\n\nIt calms you down, and it's really restful\n\nand warm and just loving.\n\nWe actually, on the walls, have a custom lime wash\n\nfrom Portella Paints.\n\nThere's also the light fixtures and the lamps\n\nand all of that are quite whimsical and playful and fun.\n\nAnd even with the furniture,\n\nbecause we're inspired by that sort of 1980s retro futurism,\n\nwith a little bit of a Michelle Pfeiffer Scarface energy\n\nto it as well.\n\nIt's a little sexy, it's a little sexy.\n\nYeah, that up there is sort of like a nest.\n\nI just absolutely love it.\n\nIt's very soothing to fall asleep at night,\n\nlooking at that nest.\n\nYou sort of can get lost in it.\n\nThese lamps are really fun to play with.\n\nI really like to just play with them and touch them,\n\nand they're incredibly unique.\n\nSo here are just a few of our favorite\n\nlittle vintage pieces,\n\nbut something that's new that we absolutely love.\n\nMy birthday present.\n\nIt was Seth's birthday present this year,\n\nand this is an embroidered piece,\n\nand the kids call us Mumsie and Whoopsie.\n\nThe kids call me Mumsie and they call him Whoopsie,\n\nsometimes Whoops.\n\nAnd it has cherry blossoms.\n\nAnd it's again, it's the pink and green.\n\nYou can't get enough of the pink and green.\n\nI love this sofa from Lulu and Georgia\n\nbecause it's just really, really, really cozy,\n\nand it has again, these pearl pillows that Claire made.\n\n[light music]\n\nI am in the main bedroom in our house,\n\nand you'll notice on the walls\n\nthat there's wallpaper of dinosaurs.\n\nThis wallpaper was actually first presented to my daughter.\n\nShe has very sophisticated taste and she's a minimalist,\n\nand she was sort of like,\n\nThat's cute, but A, I hate pink,\n\nand B, that's a pretty loud print.\n\nAnd I immediately jumped on it and I was like,\n\nClaire, can I please have that?\n\nCan I please have that in our bedroom?\n\nI'm in the Jurassic World movies and those have dinosaurs,\n\nand I'm very grateful to the dinosaurs in my life\n\nthat allowed for us to purchase this home.\n\nA woman named Vivian Baker\n\nhas been my makeup artist for years.\n\nShe won an Oscar just a couple of years ago,\n\nand she and her husband have a company\n\ncalled the Makeup Light,\n\nand it's something that they created\n\nso that when you look in the mirror,\n\nthere's cinema grade lighting that will light you\n\nso that you can actually see\n\nwhat your face is gonna look like under the lights.\n\nI have this little turn dial thing,\n\nwhich can turn it up and you can turn it down.\n\nAnd it's just, it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful space.\n\n[light music]\n\nSo here we are in the main bathroom,\n\nand while it's also my husband's bathroom,\n\nhe refers to it as Bryce's bathroom, which I appreciate.\n\nFire Clay Tile again,\n\nand it's glazed brick and it's called Seguaro,\n\nand one of the things that I love about this\n\nthat Claire pointed out to us early\n\nis that it kind of looks like watercolor,\n\nbecause there are irregularities from tile to tile\n\nin a way that feels just really organic\n\nand natural and beautiful.\n\nWe also have terrazzo through here, all custom terrazzo,\n\non the counter here.\n\nSo I absolutely adore the drapes that are in here.\n\nThey're also in the bedroom.\n\nIt's really peaceful.\n\nIt's really beautiful.\n\nIt's all the color tones that we love.\n\nAnd we actually, from Signature Hardware, found a green tub,\n\nwhich is so cute.\n\nSo there's a green tub here.\n\nOf course, as well, There's a zillion trillion plants.\n\n[light music]\n\nBecause the house, the exterior of the house was all white,\n\nit was just an opportunity to paint something.\n\nAnd so this is a mural of the twin suns from Tatooine,\n\nwhich is a planet that Luke Skywalker is from\n\nin Star Wars.\n\nSo all the outdoor furniture here is by Outer,\n\nand what's really cool about it\n\nis that the covers are built into it,\n\nso you don't need to hide them or figure out where they are.\n\nThey're actually behind the cushions\n\nand you just pull 'em over the top,\n\nand everything's protected.\n\nThis piece here is by Our House,\n\nand the plan is to just hang out\n\nand spend some time by the fire.\n\n[light music]\n\nAD, thank you so much for coming. You are welcome anytime.\n\nBut right now, I'm gonna go get ready for a wrap party\n\nfor my latest directing project.\n\nSee you later.\n\n[light music]"
