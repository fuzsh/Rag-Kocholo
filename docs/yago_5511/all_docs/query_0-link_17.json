They met at New York University in 2001, got married in 2006, and recently celebrated 22 years as a couple.\n\nBoth successful actors, Seth Gabel has been in shows like The City and American Horror Story, following his passion for acting from childhood, similar to Bryce’s path. They have close friends, like Josh Gad, who is the godfather to their kids and has known them since kindergarten. The couple has two children, Theodore Norman and Beatrice Jean, emphasizing the importance of a down-to-earth upbringing in Hollywood.\n\nBryce’s father-in-law is the famous filmmaker Ron Howard, who serves as a role model for Seth, teaching him about humility and kindness in the entertainment industry. Bryce fell in love with Seth at first sight, and after some pursuit, they got married in Greenwich, Connecticut, starting their family life.\n\nIn 2022, they moved to Los Angeles, decorating their home with influences from their favorite films like Star Wars and My Neighbor Totoro. Their house reflects their love for Amsterdam, with tulip-filled guest rooms and a kitchen featuring a Baby Yoda garlic holder.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard and Seth Gabel’s story is a reminder of lasting love, creative collaboration, and a commitment to a grounded family life despite the allure of Hollywood."
