        "text": "My parents have a motto: My dad makes it, my mom manages it. She looks after their finances and their lives. That in itself is a full-time job. There's not a film script of anything that my dad [film director Ron Howard] works on that my mom doesn't read first or isn't involved in.\n\nOurs was a loving, nurturing household, but, at the same time, my parents' goal was to make all their children self-sufficient. We lived way out in the boonies in Connecticut – there weren't a lot of people coming to visit. We had goats, sheep, miniature horses and chickens. My parents taught me many of the things that people need in life to feel confident: practical things, such as managing finances, mucking out the goat barn, cleaning a house, doing repairs, mending a broken roof or a toilet. The irony today of all that teaching is that when my parents come over they'll see my husband Seth taking care of something practical and my mum will say: \"We taught you this! Why aren't you doing it?\"\n\nMy mother and father provided a safe environment for us to confront our fears and overcome them. When I was five, I was afraid of snakes. My mom would say, \"You should be cautious around snakes but you don't need to be afraid of them. So we're going to go to the pet store and you're going to get a pet snake.\" We got a baby snake named Joseph, who became my pet and I was no longer afraid of snakes.\n\nMy dad is the most humble man on the planet. He never showed us Happy Days or any of his acting roles. But in school holidays we would join him on film sets. My parents would never throw the kids in first class for the flights; they'd be up front and we'd be economy – we knew we were lucky just to be travelling. We got to meet some amazing actors. Tom Hanks, who is hilarious, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were very warm and playful. Tom was always doing acrobatics.\n\nFalling in love with Seth was very straightforward. The second I saw him on campus at New York University I broke into hives. That night I wrote in my journal: \"Today I met the man that I'm going to marry.\" It was love at first sight – but not for him. I pursued him for months and months, and there was no interest. Then I called him at an insane hour of the night and asked him out for coffee. He agreed, we went out and he called one of our friends afterwards and said: \"The tables have turned. I am so nervous she doesn't like me anymore and I really like her!\"\n\nI suffered postnatal depression after our son Theo was born. I felt as if I was in a black hole and I couldn't get out. I was crying in the shower all the time, not feeling connected to my son, or my husband. Then one day, when he was a year-and-a-half, there was a hormonal shift and I suddenly felt as if everything was OK.\n\nOne of the greatest pieces of advice I got from my mom was when she said, \"Choose the marriage over the kids\" – which is crazy but true. When you're a full-time working mum, barely rested, if you have a free moment your mother's instinct is to go to your child. I would always go to Theo. But my mom said there's going to be a moment where you can't do both. She said that when you're spending your whole lives together – you must put a lot of work and attention into the marriage. That is what makes my parents really healthy balanced individuals.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard stars in the films The Help, in cinemas now, and 50/50, which is released on 25 November."
