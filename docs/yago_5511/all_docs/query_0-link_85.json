        "text": "(CBS) - It's baby no. 2 for Bryce Dallas Howard and husband Seth Gabel.\n\nThe \"Eclipse\" actress, 30, is pregnant with her second child, her rep confirmed to People magazine.\n\nHoward and Gabel, also an actor who has appeared on numerous TV shows, including \"Fringe\" and \"United States of Tara,\" welcomed their first child, a son named Theo, in February 2007.\n\nPictures: Celebrity baby bumps\n\nShortly after giving birth, Howard - the daughter of actor and filmmaker Ron Howard - battled with postpartum depression.\n\n\"Nothing. I felt nothing,\" Howard recalled in a July 2010 essay for Gwyneth Paltrow's GOOP blog about the moment after she delivered her son.\n\n\"I felt I was failing at breast-feeding. My house was a mess. I believed I was a terrible dog owner,\" she wrote. \"And worst of all, I definitely felt I was a rotten mother -- not a bad one, a rotten one. Because the truth was, every time I looked at my son, I wanted to disappear.\"\n\nAlong with seeking professional help and \"a homeopathic treatment plan,\" Howard said it was her desire to get back to work that eventually helped her heal.\n\n\"Do I wish I had never endured postpartum depression? Absolutely. But to deny the experience is to deny who I am,\" she wrote. \"I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me.\""
