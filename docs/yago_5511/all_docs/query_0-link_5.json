        "text": "A home base on the East Coast was always in the script for actor-director Bryce Dallas Howard and her husband, actor Seth Gabel. “We love LA, but we associate it with work,” Howard says of their primary residence—a West Coast new-build, filled with entertainment industry memorabilia. While some might consider the eldest daughter of Academy Award–winning director Ron Howard Hollywood royalty, Howard calls the New York metropolitan area home.\n\n“I grew up in Westchester County and Greenwich, Connecticut. My family is still there. I went to NYU, where my husband and I met and fell in love,” says the actor, whose latest role is in Argylle, out this week. In 2017, the couple purchased a 1930s stone home in a historic New York state hamlet, picturing holidays with nearby family and a routine out of the spotlight for their children.\n\nTheir meet-cute with the house sounds like the opening of a rom-com: The couple was open-house hopping when Gabel spotted the one. “He kept saying, ‘I want a house like that,’” Howard remembers. Days later, a real estate agent who’d noticed them in the neighborhood contacted them about the property before it hit the market.\n\n“Later, we found out things that made us realize it was meant to be,” says Howard. First, there was the current owners’ running joke about Howard. “They were watching Chelsea Handler one night, and I was a guest. The wife, a designer, turned to her husband and commented on how perfect my coloring is for the house. And her husband was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” the redhead laughs.\n\nHowever, a few plot twists—including Howard directing The Mandalorian on the West Coast starting in 2018 and pandemic’s onset in 2020—meant the home never received a comprehensive zhuzh. After sheltering there during the pandemic, Howard and Gabel turned their attention to the interiors in 2022. “What had been an office turned into a classroom,” she remembers. “And we realized some things. Like, maybe the walls shouldn’t be black in the dark room.”\n\nCue multihyphenate creative Claire Thomas—a director, decorator, and cofounder of Sweet Laurel bakery—who designed the family’s West Coast abode. For Thomas, decorating is akin to production design. “I always start from a very narrative place,” Thomas says, revealing that she and Howard describe the home’s overall aesthetic as “Wes Anderson directs a Jane Austen film.”\n\nBut before Thomas could strike the set and rebuild, she had to let in the light. “Bryce and Seth kept talking about how dark it was,” says the decorator, who has transformed her fair share of dimly lit spaces. “Oh my god, I was not emotionally prepared!” she exclaims. So Thomas finished the walls in “the dark room,” also known as the living room, with Portola Paints’ Lime Wash in Sparks, “essentially using the walls as a giant bounce card.” Elsewhere, Thomas played with color to keep things bright. “I was inspired by the Technicolor movies from the early ’40s. They’re completely bananas! The color combinations and palettes are so beautiful and fun.”\n\nAnother source of color inspiration was Howard’s grandmother’s collection of Depression glass. “I’ve never seen so much Depression glass in my life. I was like, ‘Damn, Grandma Jean,’” Thomas says. The glassware’s pastel pinks and greens are incorporated throughout the interiors. “[We thought] of Grandma Jean as the patron saint of the house,” says Thomas.\n\nHoward’s grandmother isn’t the only family member to contribute to the home’s design. The dining room table and piano, which Howard learned to play on as a child, are on loan from Howard’s parents. “They were going to store the table, so I asked, ‘Can we store it at ours?’” she recalls. “The answer was, ‘Yes, as long as you get a very sturdy tablecloth.’”\n\nFor Howard, the finished project is an amalgamation of all things personal, from the artwork to the furnishings. The process of redecorating shifted her relationship with the home, she says. “In the end it became so much less about aesthetics and more about the place we spend our lives.” Howard says she is grateful to have spent summers and holidays in the home with family, and her own mom and dad “get to come and check on their table and piano.” With her children approaching college-age, the actor wonders how the home’s story will evolve. “It’s beautiful to be in a space where I’m able to dream about a future,” she reflects. We’ll leave it to Howard to imagine that Hollywood ending.\n\nShop out the look of the house here ⤵"
