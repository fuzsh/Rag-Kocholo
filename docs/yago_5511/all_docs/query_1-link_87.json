        "text": "BRYCE Dallas Howard is returning to the big screen in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom this summer.\n\nBut how old is the former Twilight star and who is her famous father? Here's all you need to know...\n\nWho is Bryce Dallas Howard and how old is she?\n\nBorn March 2, 1981, Bryce Dallas Howard is an American actress, director, producer, model and writer.\n\nThe 37-year-old is the daughter of Solo: A Star Wars story director Ron Howard and her godfather is her dad's Happy Days co-star Henry Winkler.\n\nShe attended performing arts camp Stagedoor Manor, alongside fellow actress Natalie Portman.\n\nAfter performing in a critically acclaimed production of As You Like it, Bryce caught the attention of M. Night Shyamalan, who cast her in her breakout film, The Village.\n\nWhat else has Bryce Dallas Howard starred in?\n\nBryce's role in Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shakespeare's As You Like It earned her a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nHowever, the actress came to recognition with roles in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse and Terminator Salvation.\n\nShe has also had supporting roles in Spider-Man 3, 50/50 and The Help before she was cast in 2015's blockbuster Jurassic World.\n\nIn 2018, she returned as former operations manager turned dinosaur-rights activist Claire Dearing, in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\n\nIs the Jurassic World actress related to Jessica Chastain?\n\nDespite the similarities, Bryce is in no way related to fellow actress Jessica Chastain.\n\nThe two are mistaken for each other regularly and decided to poke fun at that fact on social media.\n\nJessica admitted to Jimmy Fallon in 2015 that she often plays along when fans confuse her for the Jurassic World star.\n\nWho's her husband Seth Gabel?\n\nBryce met actor Seth Gabel at New York University and the two dated for five years before marrying on June 17, 2006.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the Telegraph, Bryce claimed she pursued Seth vigorously: \"The second I saw him I broke into hives.\n\n\"That night I wrote in my journal, 'Today I met the man I'm going to marry.'\n\n\"It was love at first sight, but not for him.\"\n\nSeth is known for his role as Lincoln Lee in Fringe and has also appeared in The Da Vinci Code, where he was directed by father-in-law Ron.\n\nThe two are parents to son Theo, 11, and daughter Beatrice, 6."
