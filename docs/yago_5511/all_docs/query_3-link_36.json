        "text": "Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World) and Seth Gabel (Salem) will appear in the upcoming video game Maquette, it has been announced. The pair will lend their voices to the couple, Kenzie and Michael, who provide players with details and instructions but are never seen.\n\nMaquette is a first-person puzzle game developed by Graceful Decay and published by Annapurna Interactive, the gaming division of the film studio.\n\n\"This is about a relationship that ultimately doesn't work out,\" Howard told The Hollywood Reporter. \"But it's not a tragedy in any way, shape or form.\" I think there's something really nuanced about that that I really appreciated.\"\n\nDue to COVID-19, Howard recorded her dialogue from her New York home, in her garage over the course of one day. You can hear Howard and Gabel perform some voice lines and get a closer look at the game in the cast announcement video above.\n\nAs for the gameplay, Maquette is a recursive puzzle game set in a world where every object is both incredibly small and absolutely massive in size with a type of MC Escher feel.\n\n\"Head to the center of the world and you'll feel like a giant, towering over buildings and walls. But venture further out, and start to feel small as things get larger and larger--to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms,\" reads a line from the description.\n\nThe plot involves everyday problems in a modern-day love story where small issues can morph into inescapable challenges, and that's where Howard and Gabel come in.\n\nMaquette launches on March 2 for PS4, PS5, and PC."
