        "text": "Bio:\n\nBryce Dallas Howard (born on March 2, 1981, in Los Angeles, California) is an American actress and the daughter of director Ron Howard. Just like her three younger siblings, Bryce is named after the place she was conceived: Dallas, Texas. Believe it or not, she was raised away from show business and completely out of the spotlight. As a child, Bryce and her siblings were not even allowed to watch television and instead were encouraged to play together outside as often as possible. Bryce first got a taste of being an actress when her father allowed her to be an extra in a film at just 7 years old. Later in life she attended performing arts camp Stagedoor Manor in upstate New York, and later attended NYU’s Tisch School of Performing Arts. As an actress, Bryce made her film debut in Parenthood, and later in her career she replaced numerous actresses in big roles. First, Bryce replaced Kirsten Dunst in The Village (2004), then she replaced Nicole Kidman in Manderlay (2005). However, it was when she replaced Rachelle Lefevre in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010) causing a massive uproar in the fandom. Due to their similar looks, Bryce is often confused with actress Jessica Chastain and vice versa.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nBryce is best known for her role in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse as villainous vampire Victoria, and for her groundbreaking role as Hilly Holbrook in the the critically acclaimed film The Help (2011)."
