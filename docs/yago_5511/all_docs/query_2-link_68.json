She is the eldest daughter of actor and filmmaker Ron Howard. Born in Los Angeles, Howard attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, initially leaving in 1999 to take roles on Broadway, but officially graduated in 2020. While appearing in a 2003 production of As You Like It, Howard caught the attention of director M. Night Shyamalan, who cast her in the psychological thriller The Village (2004). It proved to be her breakout role, and she subsequently starred in the title role of Shyamalan's fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh's As You Like It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination, and she appeared as Gwen Stacy in Sam Raimi's superhero film Spider-Man 3 (2007)."
