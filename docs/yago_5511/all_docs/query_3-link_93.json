        "text": "Help DL I cannot figure this out. Thoughts?\n\nThis actress has starred in lots of hit movies, including a big franchise.\n\nShe may have received an initial leg up in the industry because of her family name, but she definitely has talent and holds her own in movies even without the help of her famous family.\n\nShe is married to another actor. However, there is something going on in their marriage.\n\nThey don’t live together any more. They get together and do red carpets and and an occasional dinner together but it’s not looking good. He’s living with a male “friend.”\n\nApparently, this male “friend” is someone he worked with on a TV series in the past few years.\n\nJust a reminder that “moving in with a male friend” Doesn’t necessarily mean anything gay is going on. If the male friend lives in a small one or two bedroom apartment, you can read into that. At a lot of wealthy people in Los Angeles have Estates and a lot of the smaller homes are built with apartment units / guest houses. So if you were an actor who is constantly traveling around the world making movies for months on end, plus spending some time back in your home country with family, you might be happy to just move in to a nicely furnished apartment on a great secure property with your buddy instead of paying $8k per month to rent a house. Because chances are that buddy is also doing a lot of traveling and there isn’t necessarily a ton of overlap."
