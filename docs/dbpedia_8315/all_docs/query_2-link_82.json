        "text": "Documentaries are thriving in the age of streaming, as supply meets the endless demand for deep dives into new worlds. From a two-part look at the multi-decade career of iconic comedian Steve Martin, to harrowing films like 20 Days in Mariupol, this year is shaping up to be a great one for a diverse set of investigations.\n\nRead on for W’s best documentaries of 2024 (so far).\n\nWill & Harper\n\nRelease date: TBD on Netflix\n\nWhen Will Ferrell’s close friend, former Saturday Night Live head writer Harper Steele, comes out as a trans woman, the pair set out together for a two-week cross-country road trip from New York to Los Angeles, stopping in dive bars, Walmart parking lots and national parks along the way. The ensuing film is filled with deep conversations and lots of laughter—during the trip, they also talk to their famous friends, including Tina Fey, Will Forte, Kristen Wiig, and Seth Meyers. The Sundance premiere of the film received multiple standing ovations, resonating with audiences as a testament to the unique journey of self-discovery and connection that lifelong friendship provides.\n\nMagic City: An American Fantasy\n\nRelease date: TBD\n\nThis three-part series uncovers the untold story behind the iconic Atlanta strip club, Magic City, and its rise from a humble club in 1985 to a cultural institution dubbed the “Black Studio 54.” The series, which premiered at SXSW, looks at the club’s enigmatic founder, entrepreneurial phone salesman Michael Barney (aka Mr. Magic), and the lives of the many women responsible for Magic City’s success over the years. It also features interviews with employees, dancers, journalists, management, and celebrities—including 2 Chainz, Shaquille O’Neal, Quavo, Killer Mike, Outkast’s Big Boi, and more—as they share how the club influenced decades of hip-hop music with the motto: “If the girls in Magic City dance to it, it’s a hit.”\n\nElizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes\n\nRelease date: Premieres at Cannes 2024; streaming August 3 on Max\n\nAnother entry in 2024’s blossoming canon of documentaries about great 20th-century female icons, Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes, allows the silver screen star to narrate her life story with unprecedented access to her personal archive. An additional 40 hours of newly discovered intimate audio interviews (with journalist Richard Meryman) add to the film, which promises an in-depth look at the inner life of the Hollywood Golden Age legend.\n\nSimone Biles Rising\n\nRelease date: July 17 on Netflix\n\nSimone Biles shocked the world when she withdrew from the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, but as she told the public at the time, she needed to attend to something even more important than athletic excellence: her mental health. This four-episode docuseries follows the gymnast four years later as she puts in the mental, physical and emotional effort to train for her comeback at the Paris Summer Games.\n\nFAYE\n\nRelease date: Premieres at Cannes, streaming July 13 on HBO and Max\n\nWith her Academy Award-nominated roles in Bonnie & Clyde, Chinatown, and Network (for which she won Best Actress in 1977), Faye Dunaway became an emblem of the vaunted New Hollywood era of American filmmaking. At 83, the actress gets the documentary treatment for the first time. From director Laurent Bouzereau (Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind), FAYE gives Dunaway space to reflect on her expansive career and enduring legacy in film and fashion (her icy blonde bob remains a mood board classic), from the highs of her massive stardom to the lows of her infamous starring role in now-camp classic Mommie Dearest. She’ll also discuss her struggles with mental health issues and bipolar disorder, her upbringing in small-town Florida, and the intensity of the characters she’s played. Like many brilliant women, Dunaway has been called “difficult,” a label rarely given to her male counterparts—this is her chance to address those claims once and for all.\n\nMastermind\n\nRelease date: July 11 on Hulu\n\nFrom sisters and producing partners Dakota and Elle Fanning comes this documentary about Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric forensic nurse researcher, and prominent Boston College professor who played a critical role in developing the FBI’s department for psychologically profiling—and catching—serial killers. (The character Wendy Carr from Netflix’s 2017 series Mindhunter was based on Burgess). In Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer, Burgess recalls how she helped solve some of the biggest true-crime cases of the 21st century, using her interviews with murderers like Ted Bundy and Ed Kemper and her past work with survivors to piece together what happened, and why. As the only woman, at times, at the FBI, Burgess also had to be a champion of herself in order to accomplish the important work before her. While true crime is in such boom times we’re nearly ready for a bust, Burgess’s story offers deep and applicable psychological insight into human nature.\n\nI Am: Celine Dion\n\nRelease date: June 25 on Prime Video\n\nIn December 2022, Céline Dion canceled her world tour, revealing that she’d be diagnosed with Stiff-Person Syndrom (SPS), a rare neurological disorder that causes severe and persistent muscle spasms and sensitivity to loud noises. A consummate professional and dedicated artist, Dion was devastated to deliver the news to fans, and a new documentary, I Am: Céline Dion, is clearly a love letter to those who love her. Directed by Oscar-nominee Irene Taylor, the documentary gives an insider look into Dion’s daily life as she reflects on her prolific, decades-long career and promises to return to the stage as soon as possible.\n\nDiane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge\n\nRelease date: June 25 on Hulu (US) and Disney+ (internationally)\n\nAt 77, Diane von Furstenberg is known worldwide for her iconic wrap dress and initialed (DVF) fashion line. Now, a documentary by Oscar-winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy (who will also direct the next Star Wars film) delves into Furstenberg’s life story, detailing her Belgian childhood as the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, her marriage into (and subsequent divorce from) German royalty, the creation of her fashion empire, and her extensive philanthropy. The doc premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival before landing on streamers, featuring interviews with famous friends of Furstenberg—like Marc Jacobs, Hillary Clinton, and Oprah. Read W’s review of Woman in Charge here.\n\nAmerica’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders\n\nRelease date: June 20 on Netflix\n\nWith women’s sports becoming more popular than ever, the seven-episode Sweethearts series focuses on the incredible physical and mental pressures of being part of the iconic Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. The docuseries comes from the team behind Cheer and Last Chance U, and follows the squad through the entire 2023-2024 NFL season, from grueling auditions, to training camp, to cheering at the games themselves. Despite a cozy relationship with the NFL, the series tries to expose some of the more problematic sides of professional cheerleading—like its very thin, very white beauty standards and the unsettling degree to which the cheerleaders are underpaid. Like Cheer, it also delves into the personal lives of its main subjects, uncovering the dancers’s motivations behind pursuing the dream of professional cheerleading and the lives they build once that dream is fulfilled.\n\nSlave Play. Not a Movie. A Play.\n\nRelease date: June 20 on HBO Max\n\nDebuting on Broadway in 2019 to both critical acclaim (it received 12 Tony nominations) and critical commentary, Slave Play is one of the most talked-about plays in recent memory. Its playwright, Jeremy O. Harris, recreates the show’s beginnings with this new super-meta documentary, which premiered at Tribeca Film Festival and brings together a cast of talented actors to do a live reading of the play. The result is a lively look behind the curtain of a Broadway production and Harris’s creative process, as well as commentary on the interconnecting forms of documentary, live theater, and the internet (at one point, Harris sits in an editing bay, watching footage of himself from moments before). With the play currently making its West End debut, it’s a fitting time to revisit the conversations this show sparked. Read W’s interview with Jeremy O. Harris here.\n\nBRATS\n\nRelease date: June 13 on Hulu\n\nIn BRATS, director (and Brat-Packer himself Andrew McCarthy takes a fond and thoughtful look back at the group of bright young movie stars ruling the ’80s, and the resulting moniker that haunted them for the rest of their lives. Interviews with Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Lea Thompson and more reveal the actors’s thoughts on their swift and heady rise to fame, with the clarity of several decades of space between them. At one point, McCarthy sits down with writer David Blum, who coined “Brat-Pack” (the “nepo-baby” of its day) for a 1985 New York Magazine cover story, and adjacent ’80s icons like Bret Easton Ellis add cultural context for the massive phenomenon that the Brat-Pack and their star-making films became.\n\nRen Faire\n\nRelease date: Premieres June 2 on Max with episodes 2&3 streaming on June 9\n\nLeave it to the Safdie brothers to co-produce a documentary that’s really a docu-fantasy. HBO’s Ren Faire tells a fantastical three-part tale about the succession drama of the storied Texas Renaissance Festival, as its 86-year-old “King” George Coulam makes plans to step down. As the elected mayor of the town he incorporated and the employer of the thousands of hard-working people—including artists, vendors, jesters, wizards, and jousters—working at the faire, Coulam is the most powerful person at the festival. As he plans to retire and focus on the pursuit of love, Coulam must find a successor, and Ren Faire’s partly fictional plot follows six eager competitors in a Games of Thrones-style showdown for the faire’s crown.\n\nQueen of the Deuce\n\nRelease date: May 24 in theaters and on Amazon Prime and Apple TV+\n\nHBO’s three-season drama The Deuce was centered on denizens of the booming sex trade in 1970s Times Square—a neighborhood also known as “The Deuce,” but a new documentary tells the real-life story of an actual entrepreneur at the heart of the scene, Chelly Wilson. The Greek immigrant, who barely escaped the Holocaust and landed in New York City, ran an empire of her own from the late ’60s to the early ’80s, building a porn theater and becoming a central figure in an era categorized by the sexual revolution, feminist movement and explosion of queer culture. Filmmaker Valerie Kontakos examines Wilson’s enigmatic life and legacy in the world of adult cinema amidst this historically significant backdrop.\n\nPower\n\nRelease date: May 17 on Netflix\n\nIn 2020, Oscar-nominated director Yance Ford watched with the rest of the world as the murder of George Floyd ignited mass protests and renewed conversation about the role of police in America. He set out to better understand the evolution and purpose of the institution, and the result is Power, a documentary that connects the historical origins of the United States’ current police force, from 1700s slave patrols to the uprisings of the 1960s and 2020s. It examines how money and political power have worked together over centuries to create policing as we know it today through archival footage, interviews, and academic research.\n\nCatching Fire: The Story of Anita Pallenberg\n\nRelease date: May 3 in theaters and on VOD\n\nEternal moodboard muse Anita Pallenberg is the subject of a new documentary, which draws heavily from the words of her unpublished memoir (voiced in the film by Scarlett Johansson). The German-Italian model, actress, and multi-hyphenate creative rose to fame in the 1960s and 1970s after becoming embedded with the Rolling Stones. First dating Brian Jones and later Keith Richards (with whom she had three children), Pallenberg was an integral part of the iconic rock band, inspiring many of its songs and providing backing vocals and critical feedback on production. Though she faced her fair share of misogynistic scrutiny (being accused, for instance, of trying to break up the band), Pallenberg was a cultural force in her own right.

The doc takes into account Galliano’s upbringing in Spain and England, his difficult relationship with his father, and his entry into celebrity society as he became a designer to the stars—and the usual struggles that come with the trappings of fame, like excessive partying and the extreme pressure of the international fashion schedule. With interviews from Galliano himself, along with well-known figures from the fashion world (including Naomi Campbell, Anna Wintour, and Robin Givhan), High & Low asks viewers to decide for themselves whether the designer is worthy of redemption and why genius so often seems to beget trouble.

Those who watched White Hot: The Rise and Fall of Abercrombie and Fitch won’t be surprised to learn that one of that 2000s-era’s successors in the teen space has its own murky practices, from its participation in the global fast fashion industry to the allegedly toxic culture it fosters behind its shiny exterior.

A nostalgic tribute to the store’s singular influence on downtown New York culture and cinema nerds everywhere, the documentary then takes on a more thriller vibe, playing with genre as it goes on a wild goose chase to find the aforementioned archives in Italy and to dig deeper into the enterprising, young South Korean immigrant who started the operation in the first place, Youngman Kim.\n\nGirls State\n\nRelease date: April 5 on Apple TV+\n\nIn a climate of extreme political polarization, it’s difficult to have genuine conversations.
