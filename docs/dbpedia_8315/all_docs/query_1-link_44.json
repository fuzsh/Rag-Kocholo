        "text": "Forces' Sweetheart was also a 1953 film.\n\nForces Sweetheart (or Forces' Sweetheart) is a title given to some entertainment women in the British Armed Forces (mainly in the Royal Air Force), although it was also later used in the United States.\n\nFirst World War[]\n\nThe role had its origins in World War I. Lady Angela Forbes, (born 8 Grafton Street, Mayfair, London, on 11 June 1876, died on 22 October 1950 in Jersey), was the Forces Sweetheart at camp and a wartime catering organiser for the British army from November 1914. The British Soldiers' Buffets, commonly known as Angelinas, met every train of wounded as it arrived and were often open 24 hours a day, and food never ran out.[1][2] Following her, Elsie Janis was called The Sweetheart of the AEF.\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nSweethearts during World War II included Vera Lynn (now Dame Vera Lynn), whose singing (\"There'll be blue birds over the White Cliffs of Dover\" and \"We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when\") brought great happiness to many in Britain; Gracie Fields; and Anne Shelton.\n\nPost war[]\n\nFrances Langford, whose husband was assistant secretary of the United States Air Force under president Harry Truman, was \"Singing Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts\" from World War II to the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nPresent[]\n\nPresent day sweethearts include Nell McAndrew, Claire Sweeney, Lucy Pinder, Michelle Marsh, Katherine Jenkins and Hayley Westenra.\n\nLiterature[]\n\nJoanna Lumley.
