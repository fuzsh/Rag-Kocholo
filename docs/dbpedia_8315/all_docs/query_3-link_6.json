        "text": "Favourite entertainers of armed forces\n\nFor the film, see Forces' Sweetheart (film).\n\nForces Sweetheart (or Forces' Sweetheart) is an accolade given to entertainers, actors and singers. Originally the term was used in the United Kingdom to note popular showbiz personalities that became a favourite of soldiers in the British Armed Forces, though the term is also used in other countries.\n\nThe role of being a favourite among armed forces personnel started during World War I. During this time, novelist Lady Angela Forbes was considered a \"Forces Sweetheart\" as a catering organiser for the British army from November 1914.[1] The British Soldiers' Buffets, nicknamed \"Angelinas\", met every train of wounded as it arrived and were often open 24 hours a day, and food never ran out.[2][3]\n\nFollowing Forbes, in the United States actress and singer Elsie Janis was called The Sweetheart of the American Expeditionary Forces.\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish forces' sweethearts\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring World War II, the term \"forces' sweetheart\" was most commonly associated with singer Vera Lynn, (whose singing (\"(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover\" and \"We'll Meet Again\" brought great happiness to many in Britain); others included Gracie Fields and Anne Shelton.[1]\n\nPresent-day sweethearts for the British serving forces include Nell McAndrew, Katherine Jenkins, Kirsten Orsborn and Cheryl Cole, and Sarah Dennis was named as The Veterans Sweetheart in 2014. [1][4] In 2011 London drag queen Richard Rhodes became the first man to be awarded the title.[5]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nFrances Langford, an actress and singer, was billed as the \"Singing Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts\" from World War II to the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nCommonwealth countries\n\n[edit]\n\nLorrae Desmond, who was at that time best known a singer and recording artist, performed along fellow vocalists Little Patti, Normie Rowe, Dinah Lee and numerous others as the \"forces's sweetheart in Australia\" when troops were stationed in Vietnam. Desmond herself toured Vietnam, the Middle East, Malaysia, Singapore, Kenya and Somalia.[6]\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nJoanna Lumley. Forces Sweethearts.\n\nEric Taylor.
