        "text": "The harshness of Australia's landscape and the caprices of a hostile climate have always been a preoccupation of bestselling crime author Jane Harper's novels.\n\nIn Force of Nature, she exchanges the scorching heat of a drought-stricken regional town with the stinging cold and forceful gales of a dense rainforest.\n\nLocated in the fictional Giralang Ranges (but shot across Victoria's visually stunning Otway Ranges, the Dandenongs and Yarra Valley) lush greenery and the perennial sensation of being cold and damp permeate the second film adaptation of Harper's Aaron Falk trilogy — dubbed The Dry 2.\n\nThe film's cinematography is breathtaking — the thick canopy of trees lends the film a claustrophobic feel, juxtaposed against an uneasy remoteness that heightens the tension as things start to go awry.\n\nFive women of various dispositions, social backgrounds and hierarchical positions within the company BaileyTennants find themselves on the very worst thing you can imagine: a multi-day hike/corporate team building exercise for people essentially under performance management.\n\nIf there's one thing worse than having your every move scrutinised in a repressive office atmosphere, it's transplanting that to an impenetrable forest under immense physical duress with no way out.\n\nThe dial is turned up to 11 when you throw in a whistleblower, a former substance abuser, a suspicious wife, a resentful childhood acquaintance, an adverse physical environment and long-held, simmering resentments — all of which find their focal point in Alice Russell.\n\nPlayed by Anna Torv with a believable prickliness, Alice is an ambitious and ruthless senior leader, reluctantly acting as an informant on BaileyTennant's money laundering activities.\n\nCruel and stubborn, Alice is loathed by everyone, which makes the mystery of her disappearance during the hike all the more difficult to pinpoint.\n\nCould her snooping around have landed her in trouble, or was it her unbearable personality?\n\nDe facto head of the group, Jill Bailey (a delightfully imposing Deborra-Lee Furness) is the wife of slippery family business scion and BaileyTennants CEO Daniel Bailey (Richard Roxburgh).\n\nBright-eyed ingénue Bree (the breathy Lucy Ansell) is Alice's assistant, while the meek, vacillating Lauren (Robin McLeavy) is Alice's schoolmate from decades back.\n\nAnd rounding up the quintet is Beth (Sisi Stringer), Bree's chain-smoking sister, barely keeping a lid on her dark past.\n\nEnter our detective duo, Aaron Falk and Carmen Cooper (Jacqueline McKenzie). Reprising his role from The Dry, Aaron — unassuming and pallid in the books, but played antithetically by the dark, strapping Eric Bana — is investigating Alice's disappearance.\n\nArmed with a guilty conscience that he pushed her too far in his efforts to unearth BaileyTennant's financial crimes, Bana raises some of the film's more interesting moral quandaries, the ethical grey areas of law enforcement.\n\nOscillating between three different timelines, the film, while not exactly propulsive, unfolds at an enjoyable pace. Twists and turns are revealed in each timeline, coalescing to paint a gradually forming picture of what happened to Alice.\n\nRobert Connolly's film adaptation hews closely to the book, right down to several snatches of dialogue lifted verbatim, but there are a number of key changes — both to the detriment and benefit of the film.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe cast is updated to be more culturally diverse — sisters Bree and Beth are women of colour, though Bree is defanged of her edge — and key relationships are reconfigured.\n\nThere's a shoe-horned, clumsy backstory that delves into Aaron's familiarity with the Giralang Ranges — honed over one fateful weekend hiking there with his parents — that doesn't add much to the narrative.\n\nBut where the film falters most is in its omission of a key plot point from the book that involved Alice's daughter and lent the book much of its urgency.\n\nFaced with a heartbreaking revelation in the book, Alice is mired in personal crisis and desperate to leave the rainforest, which explains her inexcusable behaviour. Without it, much of her characterisation is lost.\n\nAnd for all of Harper's evocatively conjured backdrops in her books, the film's adaptations are never quite as successful at evoking the deleterious effects of the brutal physical environment on the psyche of the characters.\n\nDespite being called The Dry 2 — a misleading moniker for so many reasons and undoubtedly a marketing move more than anything — the Force of Nature film feels more like a standalone. Without the throwaway lines and key details that evoked The Dry in the book, the film loses a crucial sense of continuity.\n\nThe Dry, like all the best crime thrillers, had two whodunnits unfolding in tandem: the mystery of Aaron's friend Luke's murder-suicide, and the cold case disappearance of Aaron's childhood sweetheart Ellie.\n\nForce of Nature attempts to do the same, with a secondary mystery revolving around a long-dead serial killer and his unearthed hideout in Giralang Ranges, but it lacks heft.\n\nIf Force of Nature doesn't scale the heights of The Dry, it's predominantly because the story isn't nearly as good in the first place."
