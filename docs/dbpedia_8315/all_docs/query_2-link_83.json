        "text": "A sexy comedy featuring man-of-the-moment Glen Powell posing as an undercover hitman, Jessica Alba kicking ass in an all-action revenge tale, the inimitable David Letterman interviewing a new round of guests, the continuing saga of Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton, the return of a beloved fantasy series and the story of the most iconic franchise in cheerleading are among the standout new additions to Netflix in June.\n\nReturning in June on Netflix is the third season of the fantasy series Sweet Tooth. Based on the beloved comic book series created by Jeff Lemire, the show tells the story of society after it has been decimated by a virus and human-animal hybrids begin to appear. The focus of the show is Gus, a young half-human, half-deer boy who is looking for his mother. Season one of Sweet Tooth debuted in June 2021, with season two arriving last June. The third season launches on June 6.\n\nLaunching on Netflix on June 7, is the hotly anticipated feature film, Hit Man. Richard Linklater’s romantic comedy film premiered out of competition at the Venice Film Festival last year and critics were bowled over by the performance of leading man, and recent The Hollywood Reporter cover star, Glen Powell, who is seemingly having the year of his life. Based on a somewhat true story from an article by Skip Hollandsworth, Hit Man tells the story of a nerdy police contractor who stumbles into a role as an undercover hitman. The film also stars Adria Arjona, Austin Amelio, Retta, Sanjay Rao, Molly Bernard and Evan Holtzman.\n\nOn June 12, the fifth season of talk show series My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman hits Netflix. It’s been a short break since the last time we saw David Letterman in My Next Guest, after the special one-off episode with John Mulaney in April, but this time the former Late Night host brings a full season of guests including Miley Cyrus and Charles Barkley.\n\nBridgerton fans rejoice! The concluded part of season three of the phenomenally successful Regency drama returns this month, and hopefully we will have some resolution to Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington’s growing romance. The four episodes that make up part two of the third season — “Tick Tock,” “Romancing Mister Bridgerton,” “Joining of Hands” and “Into the Light” — debut on Netflix on June 13.\n\nOn June 20, Greg Whiteley’s new series about the storied Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders squad debuts on Netflix. America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders tells the inside story on what it takes to make one of the most iconic cheerleading squads in the world, offers an intimate and personal look at the team of dancers and gives context to the art of cheerleading and the place of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in American culture.\n\nJessica Alba recently stepped down from a leadership role at her business, The Honest Company, and one can only assume this will lead to more film roles. In her first feature since 2019’s Killers Anonymous, Alba stars in Netflix’s Trigger Warning, an all-action tale of revenge and justice that hits the streamer on June 21. The film centers on Special Forces commando Parker (Alba) becoming the new owner of her dad’s bar in their hometown after his sudden passing. Back home, she learns that the town is now controlled by a violent gang as she aims to get answers about the tragedy. The movie also stars Mark Webber, Jake Weary, Anthony Michael Hall, Kaiwi Lyman and Hari Dhillon and is directed by rising Indonesian female filmmaker Mouly Surya.\n\nMovies added to Netflix in June include Aftersun, 1917, A Million Ways to Die in the West, Ali, Baby Boy, Big Fat Liar, The Breakfast Club, Burn After Reading, Dune (1984), Kicking & Screaming, La La Land, Land of the Lost, The Lego Movie, National Security, Pokémon Detective Pikachu, S.W.A.T., Tangerine and Two Can Play That Game.\n\nMissed what came to Netflix last month?
