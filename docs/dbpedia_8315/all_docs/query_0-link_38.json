        "text": "For other uses, see Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (disambiguation).\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens is the canon novelization of the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. The novel was written by Alan Dean Foster and first published by Del Rey on December 18, 2015 as an eBook. A hardcover first edition of the book was published on January 5, 2016, and a paperback edition was published on September 27, 2016. The paperback edition includes the short stories \"Bait,\" also by Foster, and \"The Perfect Weapon,\" by Delilah S. Dawson.\n\nPublisher's summary[]\n\nMore than thirty years ago, Star Wars burst onto the big screen and became a cultural phenomenon. Now the next adventures in this blockbuster saga are poised to captivate old and new fans alike—beginning with the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And alongside the cinematic debut comes the thrilling novel adaptation by New York Times bestselling science fiction master Alan Dean Foster.\n\nSet years after Return of the Jedi, this stunning new action-packed adventure rockets us back into the world of Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Luke Skywalker, while introducing a host of exciting new characters. Darth Vader may have been redeemed and the Emperor vanquished, but peace can be fleeting, and evil does not easily relent. Yet the simple belief in good can still empower ordinary individuals to rise and meet the greatest challenges.\n\nSo return to that galaxy far, far away, and prepare yourself for what happens when the Force awakens....\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nFoster stated that working on the book was \"as much fun as the script itself, which harkens back to the spirit of the first three films\" and that it feels as if no time had passed since he wrote the novelization of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and the novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye.[6]\n\nThe novelization was first published as an eBook on December 18, 2015, the same day as the film itself.[1] A hardcover first edition was published on January 5, 2016.[2] The unusual publishing schedule was arranged directly by The Walt Disney Company with Del Rey, who agreed to forego holiday sales of print copies of the novel to prevent sensitive plot details from leaking. David Moench, a spokesperson for Del Rey, expressed that the publisher would have preferred to put out the hardcover edition on the same day as the film but understood the importance of preserving the secrecy. When J.J. Abrams, the film's director, was contacted by The Wall Street Journal regarding the story, he stated that he was not previously aware of the decision but looked forward to reading the novel.[7]\n\nContinuity[]\n\nThe novel contains several differences to the film and scenes that do not appear in the final film:\n\nThe novel opens with a scene of Leia Organa thinking about the events of the past and about having sent an exceptional Resistance pilot, Poe Dameron, to try and find her brother, Luke Skywalker. This is followed by the opening scene of the movie, in which the First Order forces on approach to Jakku. During the attack on Tuanul, FN-2003 is killed by blaster fire from one of the Tuanul villagers instead by blaster fire of Dameron as in the film. FN-2187's failure to shoot the villagers is thought by one of his fellow troopers to be due to a \"blaster jam,\" explaining why Captain Phasma orders him to turn in his weapon to be checked by technicians.\n\nAt Niima Outpost, rather than refusing outright Unkar Plutt's offer of 60 portions for BB-8, Rey instead bargains up. She ends up agreeing to sell him for 100 portions, but then retracts the deal and gives Plutt a piece of her mind. This burns her bridges with him, but earns her respect from many of the villagers.\n\nIn the novel, Leia sends her personal envoy, Korr Sella, to persuade the Galactic Senate to act against the First Order.\n\nA scene depicts Dameron's encounter with a scavenger on Jakku and his escape from the planet following the crash of the stolen TIE fighter. This sequence was revisited in the comic book Poe Dameron 26, although it presents some inconsistencies.[8]\n\nOn board the Eravana, Razoo Qin-Fee is given some lines of dialogue, unlike in the film. Bala-Tik's lines are also extended. When a rathtar chases Han Solo, Solo kills a member of the Guavian Death Gang instead of the Kanjikluber Tolomar Reez.\n\nAt Takodana Castle, just after Finn's decision to try and flee the conflict, Plutt and some of his henchmen arrive and attempt to abduct Rey and BB-8. Rey tries to shoot him with the blaster Han gave her, but she has not taken the safety off, and she is quickly disarmed by Plutt. Rey is rescued by the intervention of Chewbacca, whom Plutt aggravates by poking at his wounded shoulder. Chewbacca responds by ripping off Plutt's arm. This scene was shot, but ultimately cut from the film. During Rey's Force vision, she hears a voice say, \"Stay here. I'll come back for you,\" and \"I'll come back, sweetheart, I promise.\"\n\nWhen Starkiller Base destroys the Hosnian system, it is described as utilizing \"dark energy\" acquired from the sun. The destroyed planets and moons become miniature supernovae rather than slag. During a conversation between Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke, they discuss Darth Vader and his downfall, which they agree was due to \"sentiment.\"\n\nFinn tells the Resistance that Starkiller base uses its sun to channel dark energy, which temporarily blocks it out, rather than saying the star itself is drained until destroyed. A scene depicts Finn and Rey stealing a snowspeeder while on Starkiller Base. This starts a snowspeeder chase sequence. The chase was one of the scenes that was filmed but cut from the movie. Later, Kylo Ren leads a small group of stormtroopers to the crashed Millennium Falcon while on Starkiller Base. Ren boards the Falcon and reflects on his life before he turned to the dark side.\n\nWhen Rey uses the Force to retrieve Skywalker's lightsaber, Kylo Ren quietly says to her, \"It is you.\"\n\nA Resistance medic informs Rey that Finn will be okay despite his injuries at the hands of Kylo Ren. Rey and Poe Dameron meet and introduce themselves to each other after the map to Luke is completed. This scene was filmed but ultimately deleted from the final cut.[9] In the films, they do not meet until the end of Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.[10] The depiction of their first meeting in The Last Jedi was a suggestion that Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker original director Colin Trevorrow made to Rian Johnson for his then plans for Episode IX.[11]\n\nMedia[]\n\nEditions[]\n\nISBN 9781101965504; December 18, 2015; Del Rey; US eBook[1]\n\nISBN 9781101965498; January 5, 2016; Del Rey; US hardcover[2]\n\nISBN 9781101885550; January 5, 2016; Del Rey; US hardcover, Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition[12]\n\nISBN 9781101966990; September 27, 2016; Del Rey; US paperback[3]\n\nCover gallery[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSources[]\n\n\"Blaster\" — Star Wars Insider 163\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nStar Wars film novelizations\n\nOriginal trilogy Episode IV A New Hope · Episode V The Empire Strikes Back · Episode VI Return of the Jedi Prequel trilogy Episode I The Phantom Menace · Episode II Attack of the Clones · Episode III Revenge of the Sith Sequel trilogy Episode VII The Force Awakens · Episode VIII The Last Jedi · Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker Other The Clone Wars · Rogue One · Solo\n\n[edit]\n\nStar Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens\n\nBooks Full adaptations\n\nNovel (audiobook) · Junior novel (audiobook) · Rey's Story (audiobook) · Storybook · Read-Along Storybook and CD\n\nLittle Golden Book · Movie Theater Storybook · Finn's Story · German audio drama · French junior novel · Disney Die-Cut Classic\n\nLEGO (Non-canonical) · The Force Doth Awaken (Non-canonical) Partial adaptations and tie-ins\n\nBefore the Awakening · Finn & Rey Escape! · Han & Chewie Return! · Rey Meets BB-8 · Finn & the First Order\n\nNew Adventures · Lightsaber Rescue · Rolling with BB-8! · Tales from a Galaxy Far, Far Away\n\nThe Adventures of BB-8 · Finn's Mission · Finn and Poe Team Up! · Chaos at the Castle · BB-8 Finds a Friend\n\nRey to the Rescue! · The Fight in the Forest · BB-8 on the Run\n\nForces of Destiny: \"Sands of Jakku,\" \"BB-8 Bandits,\" Daring Adventures, \"Tracker Trouble,\" Tales of Hope & Courage, \"The Happabore Hazard,\" \"Perilous Pursuit,\" The Rey Chronicles Comic books The Force Awakens Adaptation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, TPB · Graphic Novel Adaptation Behind the scenes, guide, and reference books The Art of · Incredible Cross-Sections · The Visual Dictionary · The Official Collector's Edition\n\nThe Official Visual Story Guide · Graphics · The Making of (Canceled) Other books Character books\n\nRey's Survival Guide · Poe Dameron: Flight Log · Poe and the Missing Ship Activity books\n\nUltimate Coloring and Activity Book · Ultimate Sticker Collection: Stickerscapes · Book and Magnetic Playset\n\nUltimate Sticker Collection · Sticker Scene Plus Coloring and Activity Book · Activity Book · Poster Activity Book\n\nLook and Find · Flashlight Adventure Book · Mix & Match · Head-to-Head · Mask Book · Ship Factory · Learn to Draw Non-canonical video games Disney Infinity 3.0 · LEGO Other material and merchandise Force Friday · Journey to\n\nTopps trading cards: Journey to · Series 1 · Series 2 · Chrome Attax\n\nSoundtrack · LEGO · Toy line · Top Trumps\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Star Wars Novels Timeline by Del Rey & Random House Worlds\n\nThe High Republic · Convergence · The Battle of Jedha · Cataclysm · Light of the Jedi · The Rising Storm · Tempest Runner · The Fallen Star · The Eye of Darkness · Temptation of the Force · Tempest Breaker · Trials of the Jedi · Dooku: Jedi Lost · Master and Apprentice · The Living Force I The Phantom Menace · Mace Windu: The Glass Abyss II Attack of the Clones · Brotherhood · The Thrawn Ascendancy Trilogy · Dark Disciple: A Clone Wars Novel III Revenge of the Sith · Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade · Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel · Lords of the Sith · Tarkin · Jedi: Battle Scars Solo · Thrawn · A New Dawn: A Rebels Novel · Thrawn: Alliances · Thrawn: Treason Rogue One IV A New Hope · Battlefront II: Inferno Squad · Heir to the Jedi · Doctor Aphra · Battlefront: Twilight Company V The Empire Strikes Back VI Return of the Jedi · The Princess and the Scoundrel · The Alphabet Squadron Trilogy · The Aftermath Trilogy · Last Shot · Shadow of the Sith · Bloodline · Phasma · Canto Bight VII The Force Awakens VIII The Last Jedi · Resistance Reborn · Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire IX The Rise of Skywalker\n\n[edit]"
