        "text": "\"Oh yeah, I'm big into 'corns,\" says Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson), who's wearing a T-shirt with a unicorn on it and is delighted to talk about the magical creatures. He's also happy to talk about his favorite movie, Sixteen Candles, his jorts, and how he's spent the past 20 years idolizing Calvin (Kevin Hart), the only guy who wasn't a dick to him in high school.\n\nWhile Calvin was the coolest kid in school, see, Bob was dorky and fat and bullied (we witness this, naturally, in a flashback featuring the Rock, CGI-enfattened). But now Bob looks like the Rock, and he's in the CIA, and he needs Calvin's help, so: Central Intelligence, a mediocre comedy made enjoyable by the Rock, who, yet again, proves he can make anything enjoyable. The Rock is more magical than unicorns.\n\nIt's a good thing Central Intelligence has Johnson and Hart, because otherwise, it doesn't have much: Naming Kevin Hart's character \"Calvin\" and the Rock's character \"Stone,\" along with references to Hercules and the Rock's fanny pack, is about as clever as the script gets.\n\nBut Johnson and Hart are a funny and likable odd couple, with the Rock doing his charming, goofy action hero thing and Hart doing his twitchy screeching thing. One wishes they were in a better movie—one that'd let them just hang out and have fun, rather that one that wastes long stretches of time on a stupid espionage plot."
