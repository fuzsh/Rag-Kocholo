CafeMom, a NYC-based social net for mothers, has raised a $12 million second from from past investors Highland Capital Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson. The company raised $5 million last August, bringing its funding to $17 million. The company claims that on "engagement metrics" it has passed other established womens' sites. It also competes with sites trying to positions themselves as social nets for adults, including mom-focused Maya's Mom, which was bought by JNJ's BabyCenter. With the funding, the company says it plans, vaguely, to accelerate growth.
