        "text": "Breastmilk is powerful and so are you!\n\nWhen it comes to feeding our little ones, there's nothing quite like the liquid gold produced by their mothers. Breastmilk is a gift from nature, uniquely crafted to provide the optimal nutrition vital for growing infants.\n\nThe perfect blend\n\nA marvel of nature, your milk is perfectly tailored to meet the nutritional needs of your baby. Its precise combination of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals is easily digestible, ensuring that babies receive the nourishment they need without straining their delicate systems.\n\nImmunological superpowers\n\nBreastmilk is not just food; it's a powerful shield against illness. It is packed with antibodies, immune cells, and other essential substances that boost a baby's immune system. These incredible components protect infants from a myriad of infections, reducing the risk of respiratory illnesses, ear infections, gastrointestinal issues, and even allergies. Breastfed babies enjoy a stronger defense against the world around them.\n\nGrowth and development\n\nBreastmilk contains the ideal balance of nutrients that support healthy bone development, muscular growth, and brain function in infants. The fatty acids present in breastmilk, such as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), play a crucial role in the development of the brain and nervous system, promoting optimal cognitive function and overall intelligence.\n\nGut health and digestion\n\nThe gut (some of us call it a tummy) is the epicenter of a baby's overall health, and breastmilk plays a vital role in nurturing a healthy digestive system. Breastmilk contains prebiotics and probiotics that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. These friendly bacteria help establish a strong immune system, aid in digestion, and prevent gastrointestinal disturbances such as colic, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\nNutrition unique to each baby\n\nOne of the incredible aspects of breastmilk is its ability to adapt to a baby's changing needs. As the baby grows and develops, the composition of breastmilk adjusts to meet their specific requirements. For example, the amount of fat, protein, and antibodies in breastmilk changes to support the baby's growth spurts and provide additional protection against infections. It's a personalized nutrition plan that no formula can replicate.\n\nBonding and emotional connection\n\nBreastfeeding is not only about nutrition; it's also a profound bonding experience between a mother and her baby. The skin-to-skin contact, the eye contact, and the release of hormones like oxytocin during breastfeeding foster a deep emotional connection. It provides comfort, security, and a sense of love and belonging for both mother and child.\n\nReducing health risks\n\nBreastfeeding offers long-term health benefits for babies. Studies have shown that breastfed infants have a reduced risk of developing chronic conditions later in life, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, asthma, allergies, and certain types of cancers. By providing the best possible start in life through breastmilk, mothers can help safeguard their babies' health well into adulthood.\n\nOverall, breastmilk is a precious gift from nature that is uniquely designed to provide optimal nutrition for infants. Its exceptional blend of nutrients, immunological superpowers, and ability to support growth and development make it the ideal choice for feeding our babies. Breastfeeding not only nourishes their bodies but also strengthens the bond between mother and child. By understanding and embracing the importance of breastmilk, we can give our babies the best possible start in life, setting the stage for a healthy future.\n\nTo make sure that our liquid gold is safe and healthy for our babies to drink, proper storage is essential. It‚Äôs the best way to maintain breastmilk‚Äôs incredible properties and nutrients. Navigating the world of breastmilk storage can feel overwhelming, with all the rules and regulations, but we promise, it does get easier!\n\nTo kickstart your breastmilk storage education, here are some helpful guidelines.\n\nFirst, a few general rules from the CDC to ensure that your pumping environment and gear are clean:\n\nWash your hands well with soap and water. If soap and water aren‚Äôt available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nIf using a pump, inspect the pump kit and tubing to make sure they are clean. Discard and replace moldy tubing immediately.\n\nIf using a shared pump, clean pump dials, power switch, and countertop with a disinfectant wipe.\n\nAfter expressing your milk, there are a number of ways to safely store it. The storage temperature depends on how long ago the milk was expressed.\n\nStorage Guidelines\n\nIn the Ceres Chill Breastmilk Chiller or a cooler (59¬∞ F and below): Protocol #8 from The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine states that breastmilk can be kept at 59¬∞ F or less for up to 24 hours, and our Chiller will keep your milk below that temperature for that amount of time. If you‚Äôre using a cooler, the length of storage time might be less depending on how quickly the ice packs lose their chill, but you should usually still be able to get about 6-8 hours out of them.\n\nAt room temp (66¬∞ F - 78¬∞ F): Ideally, milk should be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours. However, if necessary and if pumped in a clean environment, it can be stored at room temp for up to 8 hours before being transferred to a chilling device.\n\nIn the fridge (below 41¬∞ F): 3 days is ideal, but 5-8 days is acceptable and safe.\n\nIn the freezer (below 4¬∞ F): Up to 6 months is best, up to 12 months is acceptable. Be sure to label your milk with the date of expression!\n\nStorage Containers\n\nYou have options when it comes to storing your breastmilk ‚Äì some good, some not so good.\n\nFridge & Short-Term Storage\n\n‚≠ê Stainless steel containers\n\nPROS: A great non-plastic alternative that is shatterproof and made with antibacterial materials.\n\nCONS: Thinner stainless steel bottles do not do well in the freezer.\n\n‚≠ê Glass containers\n\nPROS: Good for fridge and freezer storage. Will not leach chemicals into your breastmilk.\n\nCONS: Not shatterproof and will break easily if dropped.\n\nüö´ Plastic freezer bags\n\nPROS: Affordable up front\n\nCONS: Expensive over time because you have to keep purchasing them. Disposable and wasteful, these single use bags end up in landfills.\n\nLong-Term Freezer Storage\n\n‚≠ê Silicone cubed containers (check out the Ceres Chill Milkstache Trays!)\n\nPROS: Freeze milk in perfect proportions for easy defrosting. Take up less space in the freezer than dozens of bags. Cubes can be transferred to silicone bags once fully frozen, and the cubed trays can continue to be filled when you‚Äôre ready to make more!\n\nCONS: None!\n\n‚≠ê Silicone bags\n\nPROS: Easy to use, easy to clean and BPA-free, these are a great alternative to disposable bags.\n\nCONS: Can be expensive to buy a lot if storing a large amount of milk\n\nüö´ Plastic containers\n\nPROS: Durable and usually the most affordable option.\n\nCONS: Some plastic storage containers leach chemicals like BPA (bisphenol A) and phthalates into breastmilk. While most companies now produce BPA-free breastmilk storage containers, there still isn‚Äôt enough research into the effects of other chemicals found in plastic.\n\nPooling Milk (The Pitcher Method)\n\nPooling breastmilk, which is the process of combining freshly pumped milk with previously pumped milk, is an easy and safe way to mix milk from different pump sessions! Many moms do this if they have multiple bottles of milk from different sessions, but each bottle is not enough for a full feeding. By combining that milk, you have enough for full feedings AND you have more evenly distributed nutrients.\n\nBased on recently published research, pooling breastmilk over the course of a day is beneficial. Pooled breastmilk provides evenly distributed caloric feedings, is more convenient for new mothers, and is believed to decrease the risk of contamination that results from multiple containers. The study specifically showed no signs of increased bacteria from combining newly expressed milk with chilled milk from multiple pumping sessions over 24 hours.\n\nYou can also pool breastmilk from different days, as long as you use the oldest date of expression when determining how long that milk is good for. If you‚Äôre combining milk from 2 days ago with milk from today, you would date all the milk as two days old.\n\nThere you have it ‚Äî all the breastmilk storage basics. Feel free to reach out to us anytime with questions!\n\nDon't Let Breastmilk Storage Myths Get You Down!\n\nIf there‚Äôs one thing we hate, it‚Äôs outdated advice and recommendations with no scientific basis. New parents already have so much to learn, and with conflicting information all over the place, it‚Äôs really hard to know where to start!\n\nWe‚Äôre going to air some harmful breastmilk storage myths that you might have seen online, so you know not to spend even one minute stressing about them and wondering if you‚Äôre doing something wrong. Because in all likelihood‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not!\n\nMyth: You Can't Shake Breastmilk\n\nIt was once believed that shaking your breastmilk would break down the protein molecules in it, which would then affect the nutritional value of your milk. Turns out, there is absolutely no published evidence to support this claim!\n\nBreastmilk is incredibly strong, and while shaking it may change its physical appearance, it will not damage your milk! It would take much more than a little shake to damage a protein. You would need to be super strong. Like‚Ä¶Hulk-level strong.\n\nMyth: Pooling Milk Is Dangerous\n\nBased on published research, pooling breastmilk (you might have heard it called the Pitcher Method) over the course of a day is safe and beneficial. Pooled breastmilk provides evenly distributed caloric feedings, is more convenient for new mothers, and is believed to decrease the risk of contamination that results from multiple containers. Studies specifically showed no signs of increased bacteria from combining newly expressed milk with chilled milk from multiple pumping sessions over 24 hours.\n\nYou can even pool milk from different days if you date the milk using the oldest date of expression!\n\nMyth: Breastfeeding Comes Naturally\n\nIt‚Äôs true that our bodies were born to do this ‚Äî we do have boobs for a reason. It‚Äôs also true that our babies are born with rooting, suckling and swallowing reflexes that help to kickstart the breastfeeding journey.\n\nBUT, that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs easy or that it will be a smooth process from the beginning. Breastfeeding is a skill ‚Äî a truly amazing one ‚Äî and it has to be practiced by mom and baby. It can be a loving and bonding experience that is also filled will tears and worries.\n\nIn a perfect world, we would just put our babies to our breasts and they would latch right on. All would be good! But that doesn‚Äôt always happen immediately. You aren‚Äôt expected to get it perfect. Sometimes we need a little bit of extra help, and that‚Äôs more than okay.\n\nMyth: Breastmilk Is Fragile\n\nBreastmilk is actually incredibly destructive in the best possible way. It has epic antibacterial and antimicrobial properties that help to fight and destroy harmful bacteria. Human milk is a living substance that can withstand a lot!\n\nMyth: You Need to Clean All Your Gear Daily\n\nThe FDA states that while it‚Äôs not possible to fully sterilize pump parts at home, dishwashing soap and warm water will do just fine:\n\n‚ÄúAll breast pump parts that come in contact with breast milk, such as bottles, valves and breast shields, should be cleaned after each use. It is not possible to completely sterilize breast pump parts at home, even if you boil them. However, sterilization is not necessary to keep these parts safe and sanitary. You can do that by thoroughly washing away germs and bacteria with liquid dishwashing soap and warm water.‚Äù\n\nFor a healthy, full-term older baby, it is not necessary to fully sterilize your parts every day. The exception to this is if your baby is less than three months old, currently ill, or born prematurely. In that case, the CDC recommends that you sterilize all of your breastfeeding gear at least once a day.\n\nMyth: If You Only Breastfed for a Few Months, It Didn't Do Much\n\nDefinitely not true! One drop of breastmilk contains over one million germ-fighting cells. Every single bit of milk you make is worth it. You're giving your baby the best possible start to life, whether you breastfeed for one month or one year.\n\nDo your best. No shame and no judgment. Every drop, every ounce ‚Äî it‚Äôs all worth it and you are doing an amazing job. You got this, and we at Ceres Chill are ALWAYS here to support you!\n\nHow to safely store and transfer breastmilk\n\nAfter you‚Äôve finished pumping your breastmilk, you can maintain its many nutritional properties and avoid contamination by storing it in the proper containers. This liquid gold fuels your baby, so knowing how to keep it as safe as possible is super important. Let‚Äôs get into it!\n\nStorage Containers\n\nYou have options when it comes to storing your breastmilk ‚Äî some good, some not so good.\n\nFridge and short-term freezer storage\n\n‚≠ê Stainless steel containers\n\nPROS: A great non-plastic alternative that is shatterproof and made with antibacterial materials.\n\nCONS: Thinner stainless steel bottles do not do well in the freezer.\n\n‚≠ê Glass containers\n\nPROS: Good for fridge and freezer storage. Will not leach chemicals into your breastmilk.\n\nCONS: Not shatterproof and will break easily if dropped.\n\nüö´ Plastic freezer bags\n\nPROS: Affordable up front\n\nCONS: Expensive over time because you have to keep purchasing them. Disposable and wasteful, these single use bags end up in landfills.\n\nLong-term freezer storage\n\n‚≠ê Silicone cubed containers (check out the Ceres Chill Milkstache trays!)\n\nPROS: Freeze milk in perfect proportions for easy defrosting. Take up less space in the freezer than dozens of bags. Cubes can be transferred to silicone bags once fully frozen, and the cubed trays can continue to be filled when you‚Äôre ready to make more!\n\nCONS: None!\n\n‚≠ê Silicone bags\n\nPROS: Easy to use, easy to clean and BPA-free, these are a great alternative to disposable bags.\n\nCONS: Can be expensive to buy a lot if storing a large amount of milk\n\nüö´ Plastic containers\n\nPROS: Durable and usually the most affordable option.\n\nCONS: Some plastic storage containers leach chemicals like BPA (bisphenol A) and phthalates into breastmilk. While most companies now produce BPA-free breastmilk storage containers, there still isn‚Äôt enough research into the effects of other chemicals found in plastic.\n\nProper Labeling & Dating\n\nWhen labeling breastmilk, write the date of expression on the container. If your baby goes to daycare, it might also be good to label the milk with their name.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the composition of your breastmilk constantly changes to suit the needs of your baby. There are some special circumstances in which you might need to include extra information on your milk bags to know when to use them.\n\nFor example, if you are breastfeeding and pumping and your baby comes down with a cold or a virus, it‚Äôs good to note that on your milk bags. The milk that you produce during this time could speed up their recovery.\n\nAmazingly, the composition of your breastmilk changes when your baby is ill. If you‚Äôre exposed to a bacterial or viral infection, your body makes antibodies to combat it; these are then transferred to your baby through your milk. The levels of immunity-boosting cells, called leukocytes, in your milk also rise rapidly whenever your baby is unwell.\n\n‚Äî Medela, The Science of Care\n\nYou can also choose to include the time of day that the milk was collected. Levels of cortisol are three times higher in milk that was pumped in the morning versus milk that was pumped at night, while melatonin levels rise in the evening and peak at midnight.\n\nThis means that our milk helps provide time-of-day information to our babies. Researchers suspect that ‚Äúmistimed milk‚Äù might interfere with the development of a baby‚Äôs circadian rhythms, so if you feel that your baby is experiencing sleep troubles, try giving them the milk that was expressed at certain times of the day!\n\nTransferring Breastmilk to Different Containers\n\nTo avoid spills or messes, it‚Äôs important to be super careful when transferring breastmilk from your collection container into a different container.\n\nWhen transferring your milk to bags, use a funnel if your bottle doesn‚Äôt have a narrow neck. If you‚Äôre pouring milk from the Ceres Chill Breastmilk Chiller outer chamber, be sure to keep your connector screwed on to give you a smaller opening and more control.\n\nIf you‚Äôre transferring milk from bottle to bottle to combine for a fuller feed, using something like the b√∂kee, a hands-free baby bottle holder that is great for keeping one bottle secure while you pour into another.\n\nAvoiding Contamination\n\nTo keep your milk as safe and fresh as possible and avoid contamination, be sure to work the following tips into your routine:\n\nWash your hands and pump parts before starting your session.\n\nClean the pump parts in between sessions, either by using our portable washbasin bag, and pump wipes, or cleaning sprays. You can also use this fridge hack: store your pump parts in a gallon-size zip-top bag in the fridge and just wash them every few sessions. (It is important to note that this is not a CDC-approved method of keeping parts clean throughout the day.)\n\nAlways be sure to thoroughly clean your parts. Only wash your pump parts with your other pumping gear in a separate container or washbasin. Don‚Äôt wash them in the sink with the rest of your dishes!\n\nBe sure to keep all storage containers clean and sealed.\n\nStore your milk at the correct temperature.\n\nOverall: Breastmilk is incredibly strong and can withstand a lot, but following these guidelines is really important to make sure that you‚Äôre giving your baby the safest milk you can. If you ever suspect that your milk has been contaminated or gone bad, do a taste and smell test to be sure. If it smells or tastes sour or ‚Äòoff‚Äô in some way, you can still freeze that milk for future milk baths or topical uses!\n\nMore Information\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic on milk storage\n\n5 ways to prevent breastmilk contamination\n\nThe Bokee Blog: Breastmilk collection and storage\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the best way to defrost breastmilk and warm baby bottles.\n\nFirst, here are some general guidelines on thawing and warming breastmilk from the CDC:\n\nFirst in, first out: Always thaw the oldest breastmilk first.\n\nOnce breastmilk is brought to room temperature or warmed, use it within 2 hours.\n\nNever refreeze breastmilk after it has thawed.\n\nNever thaw or heat breastmilk in a microwave. Microwaving can destroy nutrients in breastmilk and create hot spots which can burn a baby‚Äôs mouth.\n\nTHREE WAYS TO THAW\n\nIn the fridge: Slowest but most preferred\n\nThis is the preferred way to thaw because it causes less fat loss compared to other thawing methods. Because the length of defrosting time depends on several different factors, it‚Äôs best to take the milk out of the freezer and put it in the fridge about 12-24 hours before you need it. Be sure to use that milk within 24 hours of it being completely thawed (meaning no more ice crystals).\n\nIn a container of warm/lukewarm water: Best for immediate use\n\nIf you‚Äôre warming a bag for your baby to drink ASAP, thawing in a bowl of warm water is the quickest way to do it. Remember that once the milk has been warmed, it should be used within 2 hours, so it‚Äôs best to only use this method if you‚Äôre using the entire bag of milk. All you would do is fill a bowl with warm water and pop the bag in. Wait a few minutes for it to fully defrost, and then pour it into a bottle!\n\nA great alternative to bags and wasted milk is our Milkstache, which allows you to freeze milk in perfect ¬Ω ounce quantities. Instead of defrosting an entire bag and wasting extra milk if your baby doesn‚Äôt drink it all, you only need to defrost the exact amount you need. Check out this cool tutorial.\n\nIn a bowl of cold water: Best for using some now, and saving some for later\n\nIf you‚Äôll only be using a portion of the milk in the bag right away, this is a great method to use. You can fill a bowl with cold water, add your milk in, and wait for it to thaw out. Once it‚Äôs thawed, you can store it in the fridge for prepping bottles later. Since all that milk will still be cold, it does not need to be used within two hours. This milk would be good for the next 24 hours, similar to the guidelines when defrosting in the fridge.\n\nWARM YOUR MILK IN A CHILLER\n\nThat's right, Ceres Chill's Breastmilk Chiller can also be used to warm milk. Here is the step-by-step process from our product guide:\n\nHELPFUL LINKS\n\nDefrosting breastmilk (Exclusive Pumping)\n\nSterilizing, disinfecting, sanitizing, and fridge hacks‚Ä¶oh my!\n\nKeeping our breastfeeding gear clean is important, but it can be super challenging and confusing when you‚Äôre away from home. We keep getting this same question: what exactly is ‚Äúclean‚Äù? This question leads to follow-up questions like have I done ‚Äúenough‚Äù to keep me and my baby healthy? Do I need to invest in a sterilizer or is soap and warm water enough? What is the ‚Äúfridge hack‚Äù? Is it safe?\n\nAll of it can feel like‚Ä¶a lot. Some people‚Äôs idea of perfection is not easy to maintain when you're at work, traveling or even just trying to survive at home. But perfection is not necessary. This part of the process is manageable.\n\nWhen cleaning your parts, you want to make sure to keep them separate from other dishes or non-breastfeeding items in the sink to prevent everything from getting dirtier with food, grease or bacteria. You may also want to use a special soap for baby items that is fragrance/dye free and can break up grease. Using a scrub brush that fits into pump part nooks and crannies and hasn‚Äôt been used to clean anything other than your baby bottles, nipple shields, flanges and tubing is a must. All of the other rules and extra stuff can be really overwhelming.\n\nSo, what‚Äôs a mom to do? Don‚Äôt stress! We‚Äôve got everything you need to know right here.\n\nSTERILIZING VS. DISINFECTING / SANITIZING\n\nSterilizing is making something free of bacteria and all living microorganisms. There are several ways to sterilize your pump parts:\n\nA steam/heat sterilizer ‚Äî works to kill bacteria by exposing the parts to saturated steam under pressure.\n\nA UV sterilizer ‚Äî uses ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to break down certain chemical bonds that cause a microorganism to be unable to multiply.\n\nCold sterilization ‚Äî submerging your pump parts in a bucket of cold water with a sterilizing tablet or solution for 30 minutes.\n\nDisinfecting is a bit different than completely sterilizing. While sterilizing destroys all microorganisms, disinfection/sanitizing eliminates or removes harmful microorganisms from inanimate objects and surfaces. You can disinfect your pump parts by boiling them in hot water for one to five minutes or using sanitizing sprays.\n\nHOW DO I MAKE SURE MY PUMP PARTS AND BABY BOTTLES ARE CLEAN?\n\nWhile this may already seem pretty overwhelming, there‚Äôs some good news: you don‚Äôt NEED to boil your pump parts every day or submerge them in a solution for 30 minutes. The most important thing is to make sure that your parts are clean and uncontaminated.\n\nCleaning works by using soap and water to physically remove germs from surfaces. This process does not necessarily kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.\n\nTo make sure that your parts are clean, inspect your entire kit to check for mold or old milk droplets before use ‚Äî pump tubing can be extra tricky to clean, so if you notice that it‚Äôs moldy or soiled, it‚Äôs best to replace it.\n\nAfter you pump, thoroughly washing your parts with warm water and soap in a washbasin is sufficient to keep everything clean on the daily. You can also clean your parts in the dishwasher if it's recommended by your pump manufacturer. Allow the parts to air-dry, and then you‚Äôre all set!\n\nYou can also use cleaning wipes (like these amazing Bella B wipes) for a quick and easy cleaning!\n\nIS IT NECESSARY TO STERILIZE EVERYTHING?\n\nFor a healthy, full-term older baby, it is not necessary to fully sterilize your parts every day, but cleaning your parts every day is extremely important.\n\nThe exception to this is if your baby is less than three months old, currently ill, or born prematurely. In that case, the CDC recommends that you sterilize all your breastfeeding gear at least once a day.\n\nWHAT DOES THE CDC SAY?\n\nThe CDC breast pump cleaning recommendations are as follows:\n\nBefore pumping, wash your hands thoroughly, inspect your pump kit and tubing to make sure that it‚Äôs clean, and clean (wipe down) your pumping area. After pumping ‚Ä¶\n\nDisassemble your pump tubing and all parts that come in contact with your breast/breastmilk (flanges, valves, membranes, connectors and milk collection bottles)\n\nRinse your pump kit to remove any remaining milk\n\nAs soon as possible after use, clean all of the pump parts that were in contact with your breast/breastmilk.\n\nFor cleaning by hand, the CDC recommends the same methods above - use a washbasin, add soap and water, scrub, rinse and dry, or place your parts in the dishwasher. After you‚Äôre done, clean your washbasin and bottle brush.\n\nFor extra germ removal, the CDC states that you can sanitize your pump kit by using a microwave or plug-in steam system, or by boiling them and allowing them to air-dry.\n\nWHAT DOES THE FDA SAY?\n\nThe FDA states that while it‚Äôs not possible to sterilize pump parts at home, dishwashing soap and warm water will do just fine:\n\n‚ÄúAll breast pump parts that come in contact with breast milk, such as bottles, valves and breast shields, should be cleaned after each use. It is not possible to completely sterilize breast pump parts at home, even if you boil them. However, sterilization is not necessary to keep these parts safe and sanitary. You can do that by thoroughly washing away germs and bacteria with liquid dishwashing soap and warm water.‚Äù\n\nAND HOW ABOUT CLEANING CERES CHILL PUMP PARTS?\n\nAll of the parts do fit in sterilizers, but over time, the high heat and intensity can be hard on them and any of your breastfeeding gear. UV sterilizers can also affect the integrity of the plastic parts by breaking the bonds in them.\n\nThe best way to clean all of your Chiller parts is to wash them with warm water and dish soap. Sanitizing wipes and cold sanitizing work perfectly for all Chiller parts as well. But there are options if you want to take extra steps.\n\nOuter Chamber\n\nYou should always hand wash the outer chamber to keep it looking as beautiful as ever, but you can fill it with boiling water as another cleaning measure.\n\nInner Chamber\n\nThe inner chamber can go right on the top rack of the dishwasher or be placed in boiling water. Immersing it in boiling water is not necessary per the FDA guidance, but it can be done if you want to take that extra step. We do not recommend actively boiling it for sustained periods.\n\nPlastic parts\n\nIt's best to avoid boiling the plastic parts - instead, they can go on the top rack of the dishwasher with the inner chamber!\n\nTry washbasin bags\n\nAnother option for disinfecting your pump parts, Chiller parts, baby bottles and more away from home: a portable, water-resistant washbasin like the All-You-Need Washbasin Bag. Before leaving for your trip or workday, the only prep needed is to fill the easy-squeeze soap dispenser with your favorite baby soap.\n\nFRIDGE-HACK & ALTERNATIVE\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a convenient way to clean your pump parts on-the-go, you can choose to use the fridge hack ‚Äî just pop your parts in a resealable bag like the boob bag) and stick them in the fridge between sessions! This works to ensure that the milk droplets on them don‚Äôt spoil and won‚Äôt be contaminated. Be sure to wash all of your parts thoroughly when you get home. This method is great for full-term babies ‚Äî if you have a newborn/preemie baby, speak with your pediatrician or read up on the CDC guidelines for safe practices.\n\nSO WHAT'S THE BIG TAKEAWAY?\n\nCleaning your pump parts daily is essential for the health and well-being of your baby, but it is not necessary to completely sanitize your parts every day, unless your little one is less than 3 months old, born prematurely or currently ill. Using a separate washbasin with warm water and dish soap is perfect for everyday cleaning.\n\nGetting used to pumping and all the ‚Äúrules‚Äù that come with it definitely takes some time, but we don‚Äôt have to over-complicate things for ourselves. With all of the above information, you‚Äôll be able to pump and clean your parts with confidence. You got this, Mama!\n\nFeeding your NICU baby\n\nHow to safely navigate breastfeeding when your baby‚Äôs birth didn‚Äôt go as planned\n\nThe heroic staffers of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) care for the most vulnerable of humans ‚Äì premature babies, babies with congenital concerns, and those struggling to transition from the comfy womb to our bright world. As the parent of a baby in the NICU, you are faced with many unexpected challenges but breastfeeding doesn‚Äôt need to be one of them!\n\nBreastmilk protects your NICU baby from NEC\n\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis or NEC is an intestinal disease that can affect premature and medically fragile infants in the NICU. While breastmilk doesn‚Äôt eliminate NEC, it does provide very good protection, with some studies saying it can lower the chances of NEC by almost half! According to the NEC Society, ‚ÄúFor medically fragile babies, breastmilk is like medicine. Breastmilk ‚Äì especially mother‚Äôs own milk ‚Äì is critical to a baby‚Äôs healthy growth and development.‚Äù\n\nBreastmilk is best for NICU babies . . .\n\nStarting at around 16 weeks gestation until the first few days after giving birth, your body is making colostrum, otherwise known as liquid gold. Colostrum is a thicker, sometimes yellow substance that is the best part of breastmilk. It is very high in protein and low in fat and sugar, but most importantly it is full of antibodies which help protect against all kinds of viruses and bacteria. When your baby is born prematurely, it changes the composition of milk but premature milk is higher in protein and minerals, which is the best thing for a baby born prematurely!\n\n. . . Just follow these storage guidelines\n\nWhile we know that breastmilk is the best protective factor for all babies, the storage guidelines are much stricter for little ones in the NICU. You should start pumping somewhere around 6 hours after giving birth. If you don‚Äôt see much or anything using an electric pump in the hospital that early after giving birth, it‚Äôs okay!\n\nTo safely prepare breastmilk for your NICU baby, make sure to handwash before touching your pump parts or breastmilk. Also, sanitize your breast pump per the manufacturer's requirements. Each manufacturer will have specific cleaning and sanitizing recommendations, so be sure to follow what your pump specifies.\n\nHand expression vs. electric pumping\n\nThe first few days after birth, you might have more success with hand expression versus an electric pump. Hand expression is a great way to get the colostrum moving and stimulate milk removal. Starting to use a hospital grade electric pump will also help stimulate milk removal as well, but you might not see much since colostrum is such a thick substance, which is okay and good for baby ‚Äî it‚Äôs liquid gold!\n\nWe want to simulate breastfeeding as much as possible, so make sure to pump every 2-3 hours for the first few weeks until your milk supply has been established. Don‚Äôt go longer than one 4-5 hour break each day.\n\nMake sure to store your milk based on NICU rules. A lot of NICUs will request you put the date, time, and your name and date of birth on the bag or bottle to specify that it is your milk. They will store it at the NICU and will provide it to baby when you are not able to be there.\n\nWhat is the goal of pumping?\n\nBy pumping regularly, your milk will come in and a robust milk supply will be made. The more milk you can pump in the first few weeks, the better the chance that you will have a full milk supply when your baby is discharged. Goal output by the end of the second week is about 16 ounces a day. The first day or so, you might not get more than drops and then a few mLs/CCs. The more consistent you are with milk removal, the faster you will see the milk start to increase and change from colostrum to transitional milk to mature milk.\n\nA few more tips for your NICU stay\n\nThe Ceres ChillBreastmilk Chiller is a great way to store milk on the go. With the benefit of directly pumping into the Chiller and keeping your milk cold without a fridge or cooler, it‚Äôs one less stress on you and your family during this emotionally challenging time.\n\nSkin-to-skin care, or kangaroo care, is shown to be beneficial for stability and optimal growth and development of premature babies. Breastmilk pumping, or expression, immediately after holding your baby skin-to-skin is a very effective way to increase your milk supply. Some mothers find pumping at their baby's bedside in the NICU very helpful, as well.\n\nSelf-care for parents is a MUST. Having a baby in the NICU can be a hard journey for many parents, so find a NICU parents support group near you. And lean on your NICU nurses ‚Äì they are part of your care team and angels in this world for both you and your baby. You are always able to call to check on your little one, and the nursing staff will help you learn how to care for your baby.\n\nAnd most importantly of all, know that you are the perfect mom for your perfect baby!\n\nHigh Lipase breastmilk is a reality for many moms who don‚Äôt realize it until they return to work. You didn‚Äôt have any significant issues with your breastmilk while nursing at home but once you committed to pumping and storing your milk, a problem arises. You get home with your daily stash and store your milk in the fridge, only to notice an odd odor when you take it out the next day. The smell is soapy, metallic, fishy, or sour. You think it might be spoiled, but after doing some research, you discover that you may have High Lipase breastmilk.\n\nLipase is an enzyme that‚Äôs naturally found in all breastmilk. It plays a positive role in digestion and has immunological effects for your baby, including protecting their body against infection from intestinal parasites and releasing free fatty acids that provide antibacterial and antiviral effects. When Lipase is unusually high, it works overtime to break down the fats, resulting in an aroma or taste that your baby might find unpleasant. The rate at which this change occurs is different for each mom. It can happen in a matter of hours or over the course of several days.\n\nHAVING EXCESS ENZYME DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOUR MILK\n\nThe first thing you should know is High Lipase is not harmful to your baby at all. Still, sour-smelling milk can be devastating. There are a few ways to eliminate the soapy/metallic taste and smell, and your Ceres Chill Breastmilk Chiller can help!\n\nTHE \"OLD WAY\"\n\nBefore Ceres Chill, scalding High Lipase milk was a hassle. The stovetop method was the only way to prevent the change in taste or smell, so there was virtually no way to do it when you were out and about. The steps were tiresome and the dishes piling up at the end of the whole ordeal just added to the burden.\n\nTHE CERES CHILL WAY\n\nScalding can be quick and easy if you have the right tools. A bottle warmer and your Chiller are all you need. After filling the inner chamber of your Chiller with breastmilk, warm it up to 180¬∞ F and use a thermometer to ensure that it‚Äôs at the right temperature. Be sure to place ice and water into your Chiller's outer chamber in advance so that when your milk is done heating up, you can pop it right in for an ice bath!\n\nSCALDING ON THE GO\n\nIf you need to scald your milk at work or on the go, Ceres Chill can make it happen. For this method, you‚Äôll need two Chillers - one to scald and one for the ice bath. Before leaving to start your day, fill one of your outer chambers with 180¬∞ F water. Fill the other Chiller with ice and water.\n\nAfter pumping into your inner chamber, screw it into the outer chamber with the hot water and seal everything tightly. Use a thermometer to keep track of the temperature of your milk. Once it reaches 180¬∞ F, take the inner chamber out and immediately plunge it into the other Chiller for an ice bath. You can continue to pump and scald throughout the day while storing all of your milk in the Chiller that holds the ice and water.\n\nCheck out this awesome video for a tutorial on using your Chiller to scald milk!\n\nCHECK YOUR STASH REGULARLY\n\nSince the flavor of High Lipase milk can change over the course of hours or days, it's important to check your stash. The last thing any mom wants is to feel like all of their liquid gold has gone bad. If this does happen to you, you still have options! Try mixing it with freshly pumped milk, adding a drop of non-alcoholic vanilla, combining it with solid food or using it to make some good ol‚Äô therapeutic breastmilk soap.\n\nFormula 101 ‚Äì Everything you need to know!\n\nBy Jael Corr\n\nCeres Chill is so pleased to bring you Jael's comprehensive guide to formulas ‚Äî\n\nshe is a writer and proud mom of six amazing kids between six months and sixteen years old.\n\nLike many new parents, I started off wanting to exclusively breastfeed. That was my goal! I really wanted to make it work for me and my family, but after trying for weeks, I realized that it just wasn‚Äôt the best fit for me. I started looking into formula feeding and realized that supplementing could be really beneficial for both me and my baby. It allowed me to get some much-needed rest and care for myself while also ensuring that my baby was getting all the nutrients they needed!\n\nNavigating the world of formula felt really overwhelming at first. There are so many options out there, and it can be challenging to determine which one is best for your baby‚Äôs specific needs! After researching and consulting with my pediatrician, I learned about all of the different ways that I can make it work for me. Everyone‚Äôs feeding journey is unique, and while some parents exclusively breastfeed or formula feed, many parents choose to supplement their baby's nutrition with a mixture of breastmilk and formula.\n\nFinding the feeding option that is most beneficial for you and your baby can feel daunting at first, but I'm here to help! Just remember that at the end of the day, a fed baby is a healthy baby, no matter how you‚Äôve chosen to accomplish that. You are doing an amazing job either way.\n\nThere are various types of baby formulas available, each designed to meet the unique nutritional needs of babies with different health conditions and dietary requirements. Check out the list below to read more about the various types of baby formulas.\n\nQuick reminder ‚Äî It's important to consult with a pediatrician before choosing a formula to ensure that it is appropriate for your baby's specific needs. For medically compromised babies, please be sure to reference the World Health Organization's guidelines for formula preparation. Always use clean water when preparing formula.\n\nYOUR COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO FORMULA TYPES\n\nI know, it seems like a lot ‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt worry, I tried to break it down so you can easily access all the info you may need.\n\nHybrid (combining breastmilk with formula)\n\nReady-to-feed (pre-mixed and ready to use without the need for mixing or preparation)\n\nPowdered milk-based (made by mixing powdered formula with water)\n\nGoat milk (made with goat milk instead of cow's milk and a good option for babies who are sensitive to cow's milk)\n\nLactose-free (designed for babies who are lactose intolerant)\n\nAllergen-free (designed for babies who have food allergies or sensitivities to specific ingredients such as soy or dairy)\n\nGenetically engineered (made with ingredients that have been genetically modified to enhance their nutritional content)\n\nSoy-based (made with soy protein instead of cow's milk protein and a good option for babies who are allergic to cow's milk)\n\nHydrolyzed (made with proteins that have been broken down into smaller fragments, making them easier to digest for babies with digestive issues)\n\nOrganic (made with organic ingredients and are free from synthetic pesticides and fertilizers)\n\nHypoallergenic (designed for babies who have allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients and are less likely to cause allergic reactions\n\nAnti-reflux (designed to reduce the incidence of spit-up and reflux in babies)\n\nPremature (designed for premature babies, providing extra calories and nutrients to support their growth and development)\n\nMetabolic (designed for babies who have metabolic disorders that affect their ability to metabolize certain nutrients\n\nUSING THE CERES CHILL BREASTMILK CHILLER FOR FORMULA\n\nThe Chiller can be great for convenient and safe storage of formula while you‚Äôre out and about!\n\nThere are a few different ways that you can use it depending on what you need.\n\nAdd boiled water to your outer chamber, cap it up, and leave it in your bag until you‚Äôre ready to make a bottle! Without ice in one of the chambers, the Chiller will sustain the temperature of the warm water and keep it at a good temperature until you‚Äôre ready to make a bottle. Measure out the amount of warm water that you need, either in your own bottle, your inner chamber (12 ounces) or your upper cup (just over three ounces). Then add your powder formula, mix it up, and feed your baby.\n\nHave ready-to-feed formula in one chamber, and ice in the other. This method is really similar to the way that you would use the Chiller to store breastmilk or other liquids. By adding ice to one chamber and adding your formula to the other, the Chiller will work to keep it at safe, cold temperatures for several hours.\n\nHave your powder formula in one chamber and clean water in the other. When you‚Äôre ready to prepare a bottle, mix the correct amount of powder and water together, and shake it up as usual!\n\nIt‚Äôs generally recommended to make your bottles of formula right before giving them to your baby, but ... if you need to premix your powder formula before heading out for the day, you can do so and store it in one of the Chiller chambers. It‚Äôs essential to have ice in the other chamber and to refill it every few hours to ensure that the formula is staying within the safe storage range. This formula will stay good for 24 hours if it‚Äôs kept below 39 F.\n\nYou can also convert your inner chamber or upper cup and connector to a bottle by adding any standard narrow neck nipple. Check out this awesome tutorial to see how to store formula in your Chiller!\n\nAs a parent, I understand the importance of choosing the best formula for your baby and making sure it's stored safely. It's crucial to follow the right guidelines to ensure that our babies are getting the best nutrition and staying healthy. Before storing your formula in the Chiller, be sure to check the back of your formula can for all information regarding length of storage time and other details!\n\nFORMULA RECALLS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nFormula recalls will often be on the news and on social media, and the manufacturer has an obligation to communicate these issues with customers.\n\nTo find out if the formula you're using has been recalled, you can search the seven-to-nine digit lot code on the bottom of your can and see if it is part of the batch that was possibly contaminated. The U.S. FDA always tracks all formula recalls. Check out this information that they've put together.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nTransitioning from breastmilk to formula: How-to, tips, & tricks (TheMommy'sCoach)\n\nCan you mix breastmilk & formula?

There are so many options out there, and it can be challenging to determine which one is best for your baby‚Äôs specific needs! After researching and consulting with my pediatrician, I learned about all of the different ways that I can make it work for me. Everyone‚Äôs feeding journey is unique, and while some parents exclusively breastfeed or formula feed, many parents choose to supplement their baby's nutrition with a mixture of breastmilk and formula.\n\nPer the USDA, combo feeding refers to formula + breastmilk, and it comes in many forms. It can mean alternating between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with formula, pumping and bottle feeding, creating a mixture of formula and breastmilk, and more. There are many ways to combo feed!\n\nWhen you‚Äôre combo feeding and you don‚Äôt have enough breastmilk to fill an entire bottle, you have some options: wait for the next pump session to add more milk, make a mixture of formula and breastmilk, or offer the bottle of breastmilk first and then offer the formula after if your baby is still hungry.\n\nIf you‚Äôll be mixing your milk and formula in the same bottle, it's important to keep in mind the proper ratio and handling of the mixture when preparing it - the standard ratio for mixing formula with breastmilk is 1:1. If you have frozen breastmilk, you can still mix it with formula if the mix is first thawed out. Ideally, you should thaw it by placing it in the refrigerator or holding it under warm running water.\n\nSometimes, though, mixing breastmilk and formula in the same bottle can result in wasted milk.\n\nAccording to board certified pediatrician Maya Mu√±oz Mahmood, ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt any health risks involved in mixing breast milk and formula, but doing so could result in wasted breast milk. If a baby does not finish the bottle they already started, the remainder needs to be thrown out within an hour, which is the rule for prepared formula or breast milk mixed with formula,‚Äù Mahmood says. ‚ÄúSo, any remaining breast milk that was mixed in would be ‚Äòwasted.‚Äô For many parents who are pumping, every ounce of breast milk feels precious. So, they‚Äôd rather not risk having to toss any leftover breast milk.‚Äù ‚Äî Can you mix breastmilk & formula? Experts explain (romper.com)\n\nTo ensure that this doesn‚Äôt happen, she recommends giving your baby the bottle of breastmilk first, then following it up with the bottle of formula if they‚Äôre still hungry.\n\nFinding the feeding option that is most beneficial for you and your baby can feel daunting at first. Just remember that at the end of the day, a fed baby is a healthy baby, no matter how you‚Äôve chosen to accomplish that. You're doing an amazing job either way.\n\nMilk donation 101: Formal and informal sharing\n\nIf you can‚Äôt breastfeed, you can still give your baby the benefits of human milk\n\nThere are several reasons why a parent might need donor milk, and chief among them is difficulty producing enough milk. And there are a dozen reasons that contribute to a low supply, including babies who are born prematurely with special medical needs. The World Health Organization and other experts agree that donor milk is the next best option for parents who aren‚Äôt able to produce the amount of milk that their babies need, especially for medically fragile children. Thankfully, there are ways to help make sure that they receive the benefits of breastmilk through milk donated by other moms!\n\nAccording to Kelly and Celia, founders of breastmilk sharing app Share the Drop, ‚ÄúSome groups that benefit from donor milk include:\n\nAny female unable to produce enough milk\n\nBreast cancer survivors\n\nAdoptive and foster parents\n\nGay couples that adopt infants\n\nFamilies that use surrogates without access to breastmilk\n\nNon-parental guardians caring for an infant\n\nWhile breastfeeding is supposed to be the most natural thing our bodies do (it‚Äôs why we have mammary glands), the process itself can be fraught with complications for some women. When it becomes difficult, the anxiety and stress over feeding can be isolating and depressing. Some women return to work and struggle to keep up their supply. Others may be forced between taking life-saving medication and continuing to breastfeed.‚Äù\n\nWHEN WOULD SOMEONE DONATE THEIR OWN MILK?\n\nIt‚Äôs not uncommon to produce more milk than your baby drinks or needs. In cases of oversupply or extra milk stored in the freezer, many parents make the choice to donate it to other families. Mothers who experience the loss of a child might also choose to donate their milk to help premature or otherwise sick children. Milk donation is unpaid - it is simply a gift that is given to babies who need it.\n\nWHAT'S THE MILK DONATION PROCESS?\n\nScreening\n\nWhen donating through a formal milk bank, there is a system in place to ensure that the breastmilk that is being donated is safe for use for babies with medical needs. When you arrive to sign up as a donor, you will be required to make a record of your medical and lifestyle history. You will need to provide a letter from your physician confirming that you are in good health, and you will need to bring blood tests to detect HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B & C or syphilis. You will also need to let the milk bank know what medications you‚Äôre currently taking and keep them updated on any changes in the future as you continue to donate. The full qualifying process can take a few weeks.\n\nSending in your milk\n\nAccording to Helping Hands Milk Bank, you can donate recently expressed milk or previously collected milk that has been frozen up to 10 months from the date of expression. The date of expression (month, day and year) must be clearly marked on the bags. Once you are approved as a donor, you can either visit your local milk bank to drop off your milk, or you can request supplies to ship your milk. Many milk banks will provide you with a cooler and ice packs.\n\nFinal steps\n\nOnce the milk bank receives your donation, the milk is laboratory processed, pasteurized (which eliminates bacteria while maintaining the majority of the beneficial components of the milk), tested for microbiological cultures, then sent to recipients.\n\n‚ÄúThese multiple overlapping screening and safety steps ensure that pasteurized donor human milk is safe for the most vulnerable infants. In over 40 years of modern milk banking there has never been a documented case of an infant being harmed by donor milk.‚Äù ‚Äî Mothers‚Äô Milk Bank Northeast\n\nWHAT WOULD DISQUALIFY SOMEONE FROM DONATING?\n\nA positive HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B & C or syphilis blood test.\n\nA donor or partner who is at risk for HIV.\n\nA donor who uses tobacco products, illegal drugs, cannabis, or daily use of alcohol. There is a waiting period that is required after you drink any alcohol.\n\nA donor or sexual partner that has received a blood transfusion in the 4 months prior to milk collection.\n\nA donor or sexual partner that has received an organ or tissue transplant in the last 12 months.\n\nSome milk banks might have other disqualifying rules, so be sure to call or check your milk bank‚Äôs website before going to get screened.\n\nFACTS ABOUT DONOR MILK\n\nPasteurized (heat-treated) to eliminate bacteria or viruses that may have been present in the milk. Although some nutrients are lost in pasteurization, donor milk is still better for your baby than infant formula.\n\nMore easily digested by babies, which could mean fewer days of intravenous nutrition.\n\nPossesses incomparable immunological properties that can help protect against a wide range of illnesses and serious infections.\n\nContains specific elements that protect the intestines against harmful bacteria and viruses.\n\nBENEFITS FOR THE DONOR MOM\n\nWe know breastmilk promotes gastrointestinal and immune function and contributes to disease prevention throughout a child‚Äôs lifetime. Breastfed babies generally experience fewer colds and respiratory illnesses, fewer ear infections and even better vision. The benefits span their lifetime, with fewer instances of allergies, eczema, heart disease, and more. What‚Äôs less known and discussed in medical settings and social circles are the health benefits that breastfeeding provides the mom. Here are a few:\n\nFor every 12 months of cumulative breastfeeding, the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 4.3%\n\nBreastfeeding for 6 months or less reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 17% and breastfeeding 6 to 12 months reduces the risk by 28%\n\n12 months of breastfeeding is associated with a 9% reduction in the development of Type 2 diabetes\n\nBreastfeeding for at least 12 cumulative months reduces the incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, all contributing factors to cardiovascular disease\n\nWomen who breastfeed are less likely to experience osteoporosis\n\nHOW TO ARRANGE FOR A DONATION OR PICKUP\n\nGo through a milk bank\n\nA human milk bank is a service that collects, screens and distributes human milk. The milk is donated by nursing mothers who are not biologically related to the infants receiving it.\n\nFind a milk bank to donate or receive donor milk:\n\nInternational Milk Banking - World Bank Map\n\nMothers Milk Bank\n\nTiny Treasures Milk Bank\n\nUC Health Milk Bank\n\nMilk Banks Near You\n\nUse an informal milk-sharing network\n\nMilk sharing is the process in which families share breastmilk with other families without going through a milk bank.

She covers the science and citations to help explain all the principles for pooling milk safely, and we're so grateful. Read on!\n\nBy Trillitye Paullin, Ph.D.\n\nWomen are often advised not to combine milk from different pumping sessions, citing reasons such as increased bacterial contamination and temperature differences. Let us dig deeper into this myth and discuss what it could mean for parents, including those of babies with higher risks such as preterm birth or food allergies.\n\nI am a mother to two beautiful daughters born with severe infant food sensitivities who discovered that many parents experience the same troubling situation. I created Free to Feed to be a place for parents to find answers to their questions about infant food sensitivities and empower them to continue their breastfeeding journey.\n\nBACTERIAL CONTAMINATION\n\nOver the course of 4 different days, scientists collected milk from 19 mothers. Day 1: 24-hour pooled breastmilk and Day 2: 24-hour breastmilk separated by pump session (non-pooled). The following week, mothers repeated the collection on alternate days (day 1 separate, day 2 pooled). Bacteria analysis through plating found colony counts ranging from 0 to >100,000 per milliliter (mL). Counts over 100,000/mL were observed in 31 of 211 (14.7%) non-pooled samples and 3 of 35 (8.6%) pooled samples. This means that there was more bacteria found in the non-pooled samples than the pooled samples, however the difference was not statistically significant [1]. ‚ÄãThese findings demonstrate pooling breastmilk does not increase bacterial contamination. These results can be explained by a separate study which found the largest contributing factor to expressed breastmilk bacterial contamination is collection and storage material cleanliness [2].\n\nNUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nBreastmilk nutrition content varies throughout the day. Some parents may attempt to match when the milk was expressed to when baby receives that milk (morning pump sessions fed to baby another morning). This is not always feasible. Instead, pooling a days‚Äô worth of pump sessions creates more consistent macronutrients. In the same study as above, scientists found a macronutrient variability range of ¬±32% for protein, ¬±46% for fat, ¬±30% for carbohydrates, and ¬±29% for total calories [1]. This is especially vital for preterm and NICU infants who may be receiving expressed and fortified breastmilk as consistent nutrition can improve health outcomes [3].\n\nTEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES\n\nThe advice to not combine freshly pumped milk to chilled refrigerated milk is based on the assumption that it will significantly impact bacterial contamination and/or nutritional content due to the temperature changes. As discussed above, temperature fluctuations in pooled milk do not lead to increased bacteria counts or nutritional breakdown. In fact, the study found that the average nutritional content of 24 hours worth of individually stored milk was nearly identical to that of the pooled samples and that pooled milk did not have increased bacterial contamination [1].\n\nEASE-OF-USE\n\nMothers who tried both pooling and non-pooling methods reported pooling to be easier overall, citing items such as less plastic usage and easier storage [1]. From personal experience, I can say that pooling has been an absolute necessity while I have been on military duty, traveling, or simply forgot to bring extra containers to work. It is essential for mothers in this situation to not feel as though they are somehow giving ‚Äúsubpar‚Äù milk to their infants. If anything, it should be encouraged to make mom‚Äôs life easier and babies healthier.\n\nFOOD ALLERGIES\n\nGeneral rule of thumb should be dependent on your baby‚Äôs reactions. If ingested foods in your diet cause food allergy symptoms in baby, you should be aware of how pooling could impact your milk. We know that allergen protein concentrations typically spike around 2 hours post-ingestion and steadily decrease after that [4-7]. Pooling milk will reduce the overall allergen protein concentration if you do not continue to consume it throughout the day. This may be an option if you know what your child is allergic or sensitive to and symptoms are not life-threatening. Essentially, if you would feel comfortable giving all of the expressed milk to your little one separately, then pool-on momma! However, if you do not yet know what is causing reactions, pooling can add another layer of mystery to your already difficult situation. This is because you will not know which pumping session contained the allergen in order to investigate your diet thoroughly. As with all things food allergy-related, consult your physician for further assistance.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nFeel confident pooling your pump sessions! Having a single container to hold expressed milk can help decide how to best portion out what will be used immediately and what needs to be frozen. Reduce dishes and how much plastic-wear you need to lug around on your daily commute or traveling.
