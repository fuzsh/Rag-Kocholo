        "text": "Remember the days when vacationing at a beach destination was easy? You just roll up on your rental scooter, grab your towels and bottle of wine, pick out any old spot to throw your stuff, and run out into the water to play.\n\nOh, sorry, do you have a baby now? Things just got a LOT more complicated.\n\nBut don’t worry! It is entirely possible to enjoy a beach vacation with a baby – you just have to plan ahead and know what you’re getting into!\n\nI’ll start by saying that I am not an advocate of bringing ALL THE THINGS along with you. We almost always fly carry-on only… yes, with a baby and a toddler. There are some things that you absolutely need – see my list of baby beach essentials here. But having a successful beach trip with a baby is not about supplies – it’s about mindset.\n\nLet’s make the most of your time at the beach with baby!\n\nPlan ahead.\n\nYou need to do a little research about the beaches that you’re eyeing on Insta before you put them on the itinerary.\n\nBefore we had kids, we found ourselves at all kinds of beaches. Some required hiking down a dangerous ravine. Some had crazy party scenes. Some were nude beaches. These are all things you might want to know before you make the effort to get there.\n\nWhen we visited Italy with our first baby, we learned that most Italian beaches are privately owned, and you must pay to have access to the beach – but that access comes with some great perks. You need to know ahead of time what you can expect from the beaches you want to visit.\n\nLook for family travel blogs that discuss the beaches where you’re staying. They will usually have great information about what to expect and how it impacts travel with kids. And if all else fails, there’s always TripAdvisor.\n\nBring sunscreen.\n\nLots of it.\n\nSunscreen can be surprisingly hard to find in some areas of the world, and extremely expensive to boot. On top of that, you may not be able to find any that is baby-friendly.\n\nThis is my favorite sunscreen for taking baby to the beach. We’ve used it many times, and never had any issues with it stinging eyes. This brand is particularly good about not running when it gets wet. Bonus: these little 3 oz tubes can go in your carry-on!\n\nYes, it’s more work to apply a zinc sunscreen than to just spray, but when they’re little, I think it’s totally worth the effort to have something that stays put, is free of toxins, and does a fantastic job protecting from the sun. My daughters have yet to experience even a mild sunburn after years of using this, unlike with the spray.\n\nI also recommend that you use this sunscreen on yourself. I don’t know about your baby, but mine likes to lick me. If she’s going to eat sunscreen, I much prefer it to be the non-toxic kind.\n\nKeep in mind that the AAP does not recommend using sunscreen on babies under 6 months. The recommendation is to keep them completely protected from the sun until that point. If you’re traveling with an infant, chat with your pediatrician about it. Ours recommended that we should bring along baby-safe sunscreen, because you just can’t be 100% sure that you can stay in the shade when taking a baby to the beach!\n\nYou can read more about sunscreen and why we continually choose our favorite brand here: Babies and Sunscreen.\n\nFigure out sun protection ahead of time.\n\nThis goes along with the planning that I mentioned before. You need a solid plan for how you want to protect your little one from the sun. And saying “I bet there will be some palm trees” is not a solid plan.\n\n(I consider it a massive bonus when I happen to get a good spot under the palm trees! And even then, the sand is nowhere near as comfortable so it’s not ideal.)\n\nAll the sunscreen in the world will not keep your baby from overheating in the sun – they will need shade. This is especially true if, like us, you are coming from a cool climate and your child is not acclimated to that beach life.\n\nMost recently, we’ve been using a Joovy Gloo for our beach tent. This is like the Cadillac of beach tents, and while I would not have bought it (or carried it along) just for the beach, this is also our baby’s travel crib because it is a certified safe sleep product. And it’s perfect.\n\nRELATED: Joovy Gloo Toddler Travel Bed Review\n\nThe point is, you need to figure out what works best for your family. But you will need to bring something.\n\nWant more suggestions for sun shades? Check out the best beach tents for babies!\n\nIf you are staying at a resort or otherwise know for sure that every beach you visit will have umbrellas, great! But you’re still going to need somewhere for your baby to safely sit. Those lounge chairs are not exactly made for containing a roly-poly tot, and you’ll probably want a wind-protected and comfortable place for your little one to nap or relax.\n\nYou might still consider bringing a baby beach tent in this case, or even a baby beach chair (this is a super popular one).\n\nFigure out how to change a diaper at the beach.\n\nChanging a diaper at the beach is not a simple task. Why?\n\nSand.\n\nIf you lay your baby on the beach towel for the diaper change, you’ll get a diaper full of sand. Even if you lay a changing mat on top of the beach towel… sand.\n\nWe’ve tried diaper changes inside of our various pop up beach tents, and in all cases, it is impossible to keep sand out of the diaper. If there’s any sand on your kid, it’s going to end up in the diaper.\n\nThe best way we found was to do standing diaper changes. That’s where the kid stands, you remove the old diaper, wipe, baby bends over to wipe better if necessary, and then new diaper comes on while still standing. For a young baby, you’ll obviously need a partner for this.\n\nUltimately, there is no good way to keep the diaper sand-free. Once your baby sits on the sand, it’s filling up anyway. Same goes for the swim diaper or swimsuit. Some babies really dislike the feeling, and others don’t notice.\n\nThere are a few tricks to clean sand off when you’re done, however. Cornstarch, or a cornstarch-based baby powder, will absorb the water and make sand fall right off! Don’t bother wiping it with a baby wipe – that only ever makes it worse. Better to let it air out and dry and then use a dry towel or clothes to brush it away.\n\nInvest in a good swim diaper.\n\nOkay, when I say invest… we’re talking 15 bucks. I am a big fan of reusable swim diapers: they fit and protect better, they’re better for the environment, they will save you money, and they are SO MUCH CUTER.\n\nIf you want to learn all about swim diapers and how they work, you can do so here. But in a nutshell, the important thing to understand is that swim diapers (whether reusable or disposable) do not work like regular diapers. They do not hold in pee. They are there to catch poop.\n\nYou really do not want your baby to wear a regular disposable diaper in the water, whether at the beach or at the pool. They fill with water, puff up, and start to leak the interior gel everywhere. They’re uncomfortable and heavy for baby.\n\nThat’s why swim diapers exist – they do not absorb liquid at all.\n\nThis means you’ll want to switch into the swim diaper just before you get into the water, and switch back out after, in order to not have a messy pee incident outside of the water. This is a pain, but there are some alternatives.\n\nYou can consider using a swim diaper under a regular diaper until you’re ready to get into the water. Then just take off the regular diaper and head into the water. Change into a new diaper when you get out.\n\nMy preference is actually for the one reusable swim diaper that is made to hold some pee outside of the pool: the swim diapers made by Green Sprouts. This company was formerly called i play babywear, and are easily the most well-known reusable swim diapers. For good reason!\n\nThese swim diapers have a little bit of padding and a waterproof liner (like a cloth diaper). They are fitted, also like a cloth diaper. I wouldn’t replace my cloth diapers with these, as they are obviously not designed to absorb as much liquid as possible – again, because that would be counterproductive in the water. But they strike a perfect balance and can definitely handle being worn outside of the water for a while.\n\nOn top of that, they come either as a single diaper, or as part of a matching swimsuit or rash guard. They even have boys’ swim trunks and girls’ one pieces with their diapers built in.\n\nI prefer to buy directly from their website, but I have lucked out and found them at Target before, and Amazon has them as well:\n\nInfant poo can tend to be very fluid. And exclusively breastfed babies actually have poo that is water-soluble. If your baby is still in this phase, it is going to be extra important that you find a diaper that fits well and offers complete protection. Check often for poo while in the water, and change the diaper right away if that happens.\n\nFor older babies and toddlers, I have a few different swim diapers that I use in different scenarios. But for a very young baby with loose poo, I will not use anything but the Green Sprouts.\n\nSun protection can be super adorable.\n\nRemember that babies (and you, for that matter) can get a sunburn in under 15 minutes. That means that he or she should have a sun hat on at all times when exposed to the sun, including while playing in the water.\n\nIf your child (like mine) can’t manage to grow hair before their first birthday, it is especially important to keep that noggin covered, and not just rely on sunscreen for this super vulnerable area of skin.\n\nMy favorite sun hats are SwimZip and Green Sprouts. I like them both because they are structured but still floppy, and provide a lot of extra protection to the face and neck. You can read my review of both of these baby sun hats here.\n\nAnd don’t forget about baby’s eyes! Babies are at a much higher risk than adults are of having sun damage to their eyes. Not all babies will keep sunglasses on, but then again, not all sunglasses are comfortable and well-designed for a baby’s head.\n\nMy favorite baby sunglasses are roshambo baby (this link gets you 15% off, heeeyyy). We’ve tried a number of other brands – including the popular Babiators – and my kids would not keep them on. We’ve had great success with the roshambo’s. Check out my full review of the roshambos vs. the Babiators here.\n\nPlus, they come ins sizes for the whole family in case you want to be that family, like us!\n\nFluids are your friend.\n\nIn a lot of places, you might find vendors walking around selling bottles of cold water. I would generally not trust that water for my baby, depending on the country that I’m in. At the very least, ensure that it is sealed! Many vendors refill bottles with tap water to sell.\n\nYour best option is to bring water along with you (bought sealed from a store). And bring a LOT more than you expect to need.\n\nIf you are breastfeeding, remember that your baby will need extra fluids because of the heat, so he or she will need to nurse more than usual. That means you need extra water too, mama. This is also true if you use formula – bring plenty extra!\n\nLet’s talk water safety.\n\nBaby safety at the beach boils down to three things: hands-on baby at all times in the water, don’t go out into choppy water, and stay protected from the sun.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times my husband and I have felt comfortable in moderate waves, only to be taken surprise by a random larger wave, and then we drop something. Sunglasses, hats, our GoPro… all eaten by Poseidon over the years. We don’t want that to be our baby, so we only hold the baby in very gentle water with no sudden waves.\n\nIf the water is calm and you feel confident holding your baby, by all means, bring ’em in. I’ve even worn my baby in this mesh Moby-style wrap into the water – but you still must keep arms on baby at all times!\n\nYou can also consider bringing a floatie or life vest along, which will make it easier on you and more fun for baby. But you still need to be within arms’ reach at all times. I like this inflatable floatie for babies, and this swim vest for older toddlers or preschoolers. For young toddlers, we use puddle jumpers, but they are a pain to travel with.\n\nWhile we’re here, have you taken an infant CPR class in the last few years? Always a good thing to brush up on.\n\nSorry, but you have to take turns.\n\nWe love to try out water sports when we’re at the beach. We’re not going to let our little ones get in the way of stand up paddle boarding, surfing, kayaking, or jet skis – but we can’t do it together.\n\nYou’re going to have to take turns for any of that fun stuff. And that goes for good old splashing around in the water, too. No more sexy water snuggles.\n\nIt can definitely be a bummer to no longer enjoy the things that you used to do together at the beach. This was actually one of the biggest adjustments for us when we started to travel with babies. And sometimes one of you will need to deal with the baby just so the other person can enjoy lounging for a while. Know that there will be a time when the kids get a bit older and you’ll get back to the long, relaxing days at the beach. But for now, it will come in bits and pieces between baby care.\n\nRent or buy water toys at your destination.\n\nWater toys are great for a day at the beach! But most of them are a pain to try to travel with.\n\nAny beach you go to in a semi-touristy area is going to have somewhere nearby that either rents or sells water toys. While renting is obviously ideal, you can always buy and then donate them or bring them home with you. We bought a bucket of sand toys in Mexico that we ended up bringing back in a grocery bag as a carry-on item, but we still have them and play with them in the yard.\n\nDoes your hotel have towels that you can borrow so you don’t have to bring any? What about your Airbnb? Most that we have stayed in that were close to a beach had towels, umbrellas, and often water toys to borrow. This is definitely worth checking on before your trip!\n\nYou also might be able to rent beach toys from a local family. BabyQuip is a baby rental service where you can rent cribs, strollers, car seats, and more from local families while you travel. In beach destinations, you will find many families that also rent out beach gear. It’s worth checking into!\n\nAlternately, seek out beach toys that are inflatable or otherwise easy to transport. The last thing you need is to juggle a giant bag on your vacation beach day!\n\nPaying for a deluxe beach experience is totally worth it.\n\nSometimes, there is nothing better than laying on a beach, in a lounger under an umbrella, with music in the air and a margarita in hand. Will it cost you a little more to make that happen? Sure.\n\nBut when you don’t need to worry about bringing anything – not towels, water, food, anything! – it makes the overall experience so much easier. Especially with a baby in tow.\n\nIf you’re planning on spending a good chunk of your day at the beach, look into whether there are private beaches at your destination. On top of having a restaurant and bar, they will often have bathrooms, showers, and other amenities that can honestly make all the difference between a stressful situation and a day of lazy fun.\n\nEven if you are the most budget-conscious traveler, paying for a family-friendly beach club for the day is a solid use of vacation cash.\n\nGet creative to protect your stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, theft is a serious issue at beaches. And when you’re distracted by your adorable baby in the water? You’re a pretty big target. Please don’t leave your purse/wallet/keys/cell phone laying on your towel while you build sandcastles!\n\nWe’ve come up with a few good solutions over the years for how to hide our stuff. We obviously minimize the valuables that we bring, but there will always be keys and cell phones.\n\nWe used to bring a ziploc bag and bury it in the sand. This worked, but it was a bit of a pain. Luckily we came across a much better solution:\n\nSo when can you take a baby to the beach? Really, as soon as you are comfortable with it. Under 6 months, you’ll want to talk to your child’s doctor about sunscreen, and always remember baby beach safety. But babies love the beach, and while you might not enjoy your beach vacay the way you are used to, there is a different kind of delight that comes from spending a day at the beach with baby.\n\nWhat’s your favorite way to beach it up with a baby?
