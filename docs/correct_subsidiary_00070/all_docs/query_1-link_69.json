        "text": "If it feels like Taylor Swift is everywhere you look, you’re not alone. We’re all currently living in our “Swiftie Era,” and couldn’t be happier about it. Some of us were lucky enough to snag tickets to The Eras Tour, while others are happy simply going back in time with each updated album that’s released—Taylor’s Version, of course. Then there are, of course, the “Brads, Chads, dads” unhappy about Taylor gracing our TV screens during NFL games to cheer on her latest beau, Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end, Travis Kelce.\n\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly what it is about Taylor and her music that has us all in a constant lavender haze (see what we did there?). She’s without a doubt one of the most gifted songwriters of our generation. The way she tells stories has the ability to bring us to tears (looking at you, 10-minute version of “All Too Well”). Not to mention, she’s got a song (or 20) for literally every mood.\n\nBut I think what really makes her special to a lot of listeners is that we essentially grew up alongside her. From “Fifteen” perfectly depicting the struggle that is high school, to her capturing exactly what it’s like to turn 22, to nailing all of the emotions that we felt during that earth-shattering breakup and everything in between—she simply gets us.\n\nNow many of us have the privilege of sharing our Taylor love with our own little ones, and she’s even found unexpected ways of bringing families together. If you want to take it a step further, though, that’s where we come in. Because she’s inspired us in so many ways already, why not let her give us baby name inspiration as well? Read on for 65+ of our favorite Swiftie-inspired baby names.\n\nBaby Girl Names Inspired by Taylor Swift\n\nThe baby name inspiration for girls is pretty much never ending when it comes to Taylor Swift. Here are a few of our favorites, their meanings, and how they tie to Taylor.\n\nAbigail\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Cause of joy\n\nTaylor Tie: Swifties know Abigail as Taylor’s long-time best friend. Listeners will also recognize the mention of her name in the song “Fifteen.” Just like her music always has, a newborn baby girl with this name is sure to be the cause of a lot of joy.\n\nAimee\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Beloved\n\nTaylor Tie: The Tortured Poets Departments brought us several tracks that many speculate are about relationships (friends and foes…) in Taylor’s real life. “thanK you aIMee” is no exception, rumored to be about Kim Kardashian.\n\nAlison\n\nOrigin: French, English | Meaning: Noble and light\n\nTaylor Tie: This lovely and highly-feminine moniker happens to be Taylor’s middle name.\n\nAngelina\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Angel or messenger\n\nTaylor Tie: Die-hard fans will recognize this name as the title of one of Taylor’s unreleased songs. In true young Taylor fashion, the song is titled after a girl who is dating her crush.\n\nAudrey\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Noble and strength\n\nTaylor Tie: Not only is she known for her musical excellence, Blondie also has a few acting roles under her belt. In 2012, she voiced the animated character Audrey in The Lorax.\n\nBetty\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Oath of God\n\nTaylor Tie: “Would you have me? Would you want me?” In her ballad “Betty” from Folklore, Taylor sculpts the story of a love triangle between Betty, James, and August.\n\nBonnie\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Pretty\n\nTaylor Tie: Give a re-listen to “Getaway Car” from the Reputation album and try not to picture the infamous criminal couple Bonnie and Clyde. The lyrics of a metaphorical crime spree and prison break also reference the couple from the 1930s.\n\nCarolina\n\nOrigin: French, German | Meaning: Free man\n\nTaylor Tie: Written for the coming-of-age tale and 2022 movie Where the Crawdads Sing is Taylor’s moody track, “Carolina.” Harry Styles also has a song of the same title making this a music-inspired baby name overall.\n\nCassandra\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Shining upon man\n\nTaylor Tie: It’s no secret that Taylor often includes hidden messages within her lyrics—and there are plenty of theories about one song in particular, “Cassandra,” from her latest album, TTPD. Many believe the title is inspired by a Greek mythology story about the daughter of the king and queen of Troy who posses the gift of prophecy. For your own little princess, consider this classy moniker.\n\nChloe\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Blooming, Fertility\n\nTaylor Tie: A little girl with this “blooming” name certainly won’t “break your cold, cold heart,” even if “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus” broke Taylor’s.\n\nClara\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Bright, Famous\n\nTaylor Tie: One of the many names used as titles in Taylor’s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, is “Clara Bow.” The moody track pays homepage to one of the original “It Girls” turned “tormented Hollywood outsider,” 1920s American silent film actress Clara Bow.\n\nCornelia\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Horn\n\nTaylor Tie: The Lover album was fittingly filled with loving serenades and nods. Here, she’s referencing the home she rented on Cornelia Street in New York City.\n\nDaisy/Daisy May\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Day’s eye\n\nTaylor Tie: Though the name comes from, “You’re On Your Own Kid,” we know your little Daisy May will always have you there for her. Taylor also gave us the iconic line, “I once was poison ivy, but now I’m your Daisy” in “Don’t Blame Me.” Not to mention, Taylor references The Great Gatsby in several of her works. We have to imagine the “beautiful fool” she mentions in “Happiness” has ties to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s character Daisy Buchanan.\n\nDorothea\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: God’s gift\n\nTaylor Tie: If one thing’s for sure, Taylor is an expert storyteller. According to her, the character in her song “Dorothea” from the Evermore album went to the same school as James, Betty, and Inez from the song “Betty.” Dorothea is a typical small-town girl with big dreams for herself.\n\nEmma\n\nOrigin: German | Meaning: Universal or whole\n\nTaylor Tie: Of all of the reasons to love Taylor’s versions of her discography, one of our favorites is the new songs she puts out ‘from the vault’ in the process. It doesn’t get much sweeter than “When Emma Falls in Love,” rumored to have been written about her friend Emma Stone because “she’s the kind of book that you can’t put down.”\n\nEste/Esther\n\nOrigin: Persian | Meaning: Star\n\nTaylor Tie: This may be one of our favorite Taylor Swift-inspired baby names because of the story it comes from. In “No Body No Crime,” Taylor shows off her creativity more than ever and the song’s main character is a woman named Este.\n\nGeorgia\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Farmer or Earth-worker\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has a knack for using Greek names in a creative way. The way your little ones’ eyes are going to shine is sure to “put those Georgia stars to shame.”\n\nGoldie\n\nOrigin: Yiddish | Meaning: Made of gold\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor references gold and lightness in many songs. Some of our favorites are “Daylight,” “Gold Rush,” and “Dress.”\n\nGrace\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Blessing\n\nTaylor Tie: We love this beautifully feminine name that references Taylor’s song “State of Grace.” Having a little one will remind us all that “love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right.”\n\nInez\n\nOrigin: Spanish | Meaning: Pure and holy\n\nTaylor Tie: While James, Betty, and August were dealing with their love triangle, Inez was the one spreading rumors about the “illicit affair.” You can believe us when we say, this is a great vintage baby name option.\n\nIvy\n\nOrigin: English, Latin | Meaning: Vine\n\nTaylor Tie: “My house of stone, your ivy grows and now I’m covered.” Though the song “Ivy” may be on the sadder side of the Evermore album, the name is simply lovely for a little one.\n\nJuliet\n\nOrigin: Latin, French, and English | Meaning: Youthful\n\nTaylor Tie: Drawing inspiration from Shakespeare, we all know Taylor’s “Love Story” all too well (we just can’t stop with the puns!). This name with a rich history is as beautiful as it is iconic.\n\nKimberly\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Royal Forest\n\nTaylor Tie: Brought to this list by none other than Taylor’s long-time foe, Kim Kardashian, it’s speculated that Tay’s song “thanK you aIMee” was written about her.\n\nLavender\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Purple flower\n\nTaylor Tie: We know you’ll be in a “lavender haze” for life after bringing a newborn home named Lavender.\n\nLondon\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: From the great river\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has no problem referencing geographical locations in her work. In her upbeat song “London Boy” from the Lover album—and her new song “So Long, London” from her newly-released album The Tortured Poets Department—we hear about her relationship with Joe Alwyn.\n\nMarjorie\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Pearl\n\nTaylor Tie: Marjorie is both the title of a song on the Evermore album and the name of Taylor’s grandmother. Little ones named after this song are sure to learn how important it is to “never be so kind, you forget to be clever. Never be so clever, you forget to be kind.”\n\nMary\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Beloved\n\nTaylor Tie: “Oh my my my my,” we can’t think of a more timeless baby name inspired by “Mary’s Song” from Taylor’s very first album. This also happens to be a great middle name option for a little lady.\n\nOlivia\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Olive tree\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has never had a problem with showing her love of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She even named one of her cats after Detective Olivia Benson and has become friends with actress Mariska Hargitay in real life.\n\nParis\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Defender\n\nTaylor Tie: Because you’ll be just as in love with your little one as Taylor was in her song “Paris,” consider this name of the city of love.\n\nRebekah/Rebecca\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: To join or bind\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor’s storytelling abilities reach new heights in “The Last Great American Dynasty.” In the song, she tells the tale of the heiress who previously owned Holiday House, the home she purchased in Rhode Island, Rebekah Harkness.\n\nScarlett\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Red\n\nTaylor Tie: If Taylor were a color, we’d have to assume she’d be red. This name is in reference to her songs “Red” and “Maroon” as well as her Red album.\n\nSophie/Sophia\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Wisdom\n\nTaylor Tie: After Sophie Turner and Taylor’s ex, Joe Jonas, split, the two gals formed a lovely friendship. As an added bonus, Sophie’s surname, Turner, makes a great boy name option as well. Plus, Sophia is grouped with several others in Taylor’s song from TTPD “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus”—maybe she has the “wisdom” to know whose hair his hands were in…\n\nSummer\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Summer season\n\nTaylor Tie: Arguably one of the catchiest songs Taylor has ever written is behind the inspiration for this name. Give “Cruel Summer” a listen and just try not to sing along.\n\nWillow\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Willow tree\n\nTaylor Tie: Bringing a newborn home will leave every parent saying, “life was a willow and it bent right to your wind.”\n\nBaby Boy Names Inspired by Taylor Swift\n\nWhile Taylor is the quintessential girls’ girl (re: her Fourth of July 2023 Instagram pic), that doesn’t mean we can’t get great baby boy name inspiration from her too. Here are some of our favorite boy names inspired by Taylor Swift.\n\nAchilles\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Pain\n\nTaylor Tie: We know the name from Greek mythology as the warrior from the Trojan War. In “State of Grace,” Taylor mentions an “Achilles heel.” This unique name has a lot of power and history behind it, making it a great option for a revival.\n\nArcher\n\nOrigin: Latin, English | Meaning: Bowman\n\nTaylor Tie: “I’ve been the archer, I’ve been the prey. Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling? But who could stay?” The name, of course, is from Taylor’s song “The Archer,” which also references her zodiac sign, Sagittarius.\n\nBobby\n\nOrigin: German, English | Meaning: Bright flame\n\nTaylor Tie: “I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of ’45, picked me up late one night out the window. We were 17 and crazy running wild.” While we know Taylor didn’t literally meet a Bobby in 1945, we are constantly in awe of her storytelling abilities and love that she used this timeless boy name in “Starlight.”\n\nClark\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Scribe\n\nTaylor Tie: All the way back in 2010, Taylor gifted us with the song “Superman.” Of course, this name is in reference to Clark Kent, Superman’s human name.\n\nClyde\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Warm, friendly\n\nTaylor Tie: Where there is Bonnie, there is Clyde. Their whirlwind romance is referenced in Taylor’s “Getaway Car.”\n\nDean\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Valley\n\nTaylor Tie: He’s sure to have that “James Dean, daydream, look in his eyes.” A name inspired by both Taylor and James Dean? Say no more!\n\nDestin\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Destiny, Fate\n\nTaylor Tie: This masculine French name is inspired by Taylor’s lively track on TTPD “Florida!!!” Perhaps it was “destiny” that brought her to the Sunshine State, just as it’s “fate” that you bring home the perfect baby boy with this city-inspired name.\n\nHenderson\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Son of Henry\n\nTaylor Tie: We pulled out all of the stops when putting together this list of Taylor Swift-inspired baby names—quite literally! Hendersonville is the town in Tennessee where she spent most of her childhood, and we happen to think it makes an adorably unique name.\n\nJake/Jacob\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Supplanter\n\nTaylor Tie: It’s no doubt Taylor had a tumultuous relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. And while Swifties may not be his biggest fan because of this, it’s believed that we have him to thank for the song, “All Too Well.”\n\nJoe/Joseph\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: God will give\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has been no stranger to break-ups—hence why she writes so beautifully about the experiences we can all relate to. But, I think I speak for many of us when I say hearing of her breakup with Joe Alwyn was more shocking than the others. Regardless, this classically-masculine name will never go out of style.\n\nJohn\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Graced by God\n\nTaylor Tie: OK, hear us out. Swifties may have quickly shunned John Mayer after the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and the revival of “Dear John” depicting her tumultuous relationship with the artist. However, that doesn’t mean that the name that’s basically as old as time deserves any hate.\n\nLennon\n\nOrigin: Irish | Meaning: Lover\n\nTaylor Tie: The meaning speaks for itself with this one. If Lover is your favorite album, this is the perfect baby name.\n\nLeo/Leonardo\n\nOrigin: German | Meaning: Brave as a lion\n\nTaylor Tie: “And they would toast to me, let the players play. I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez.” We hear ya, Taylor. We could all use a Leonardo DiCaprio in France moment.\n\nLevi\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: United, joined\n\nTaylor Tie: She may have been referencing Levi jeans in “Cardigan,” but this is a classic baby name with Biblical ties.\n\nMarcus\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Warlike\n\nTaylor Tie: It’s no secret that Taylor is always on the ready to go to war for those she cares about or when she feels wronged. Perhaps she had a “warlike” feel when writing “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”\n\nPeter\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Rock, Stone\n\nTaylor Tie: While we were inspired to include this on our list thanks to the song “Peter” on TTPD, it’s certainly not the first time Taylor referenced a Peter in a song. The jury is still out on the actual meaning of the song title in this case, but some speculate it ties to Peter Pan or even scriptural allusions. Either way, this classic baby name is a great one to consider.\n\nRonan\n\nOrigin: Irish | Meaning: Little seal\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has graced us with a few ballads for grieving parents over the years—think “Bigger Than the Whole Sky.” But “Ronan” in particular tugs on our heartstrings. Taylor wrote the song about a 3-year-old boy named Ronan who lost a battle with neuroblastoma in 2011. The boy’s mom, Maya Thompson, shared the experience on her blog, and Taylor pulled quotes from the post for the song.\n\nRomeo\n\nOrigin: Italian | Meaning: Pilgrim to Rome\n\nTaylor Tie: If you’re anything like us, you can’t see this name without wanting to burst into song. “Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone…”\n\nStephen\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Crown, garland\n\nTaylor Tie: “Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving, but I know I saw a light in you.” When Taylor released her version of Fearless, this was, without a doubt, one of the songs I was most excited to re-listen to.\n\nTim/Timothy\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: God’s honor\n\nTaylor Tie: “When you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think my favorite song.” Baby name inspo from two great artists? We’ll take it!\n\nTravis\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Toll collector\n\nTaylor Tie: As if we needed another reason to praise Taylor, she gave us a reason to start watching NFL games after she started dating tight end Travis Kelce. The hunky NFL tight end plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, who won Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nGender Neutral Swiftie Baby Names\n\nFor something a little more creative, consider these gender-neutral baby names that are oh-so Swiftie.\n\nAugust\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Great, magnificent\n\nTaylor Tie: “But I can see us lost in the memory” of bringing home a newborn with this adorable name.\n\nCamden\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Winding valley\n\nTaylor Tie: This historical name ties to “London Boy” and “So Long, London” where Taylor writes about her time in the European city. Camden Market in London is an iconic destination known for endless offerings like food, clothing, crafts, and more.\n\nCory/Corey\n\nOrigin: Irish | Meaning: From the hollow\n\nTaylor Tie: We know a little one with this name will always “stay beautiful.”\n\nDrew\n\nOrigin: Welsh | Meaning: Wise\n\nTaylor Tie: Taylor has always loved name-dropping in her songs, and “Teardrops on My Guitar” might just be one of our favorite instances. There will be no faking smiles when looking at a newborn baby Drew.\n\nJames\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Replacer\n\nTaylor Tie: Like Dean, this name is in part inspired by the James Dean references Taylor has used. We can also tie it back to “Begin Again” where Taylor talks about her love of artist James Taylor.\n\nKelce/Kelsea/Kelsey\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Victorious ship\n\nTaylor Tie: While a surname in this case, Taylor’s football-playing beau, Travis Kelce, has a last name quite fitting for baby name inspiration. The moniker means “victorious ship.”\n\nPoet\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: One who writes verse\n\nTaylor Tie: Show your love and excitement for Taylor’s latest album, The Tortured Poet’s Department, with a highly unique but lovely occupation-style name like Poet.\n\nRobin\n\nOrigin: German | Meaning: Bright, Fame\n\nTaylor Tie: Like many of Taylor’s songs, “Robin” from The Tortured Poets Department is open to interpretation. On one hand, some say the gender-neutral title meaning “bright” and “fame” is shared with a song that can be seen as a nod to adolescence, similar to “Never Grow Up.” Others are interpreting it in a sort of Peter Pan reference where an adult is refusing to grow up. No matter which side you’re on, the piano ballad is great baby name inspiration.\n\nSam\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: God has heard\n\nTaylor Tie: It’s unclear whose hair his hands were actually in, but Sam is one of the several suspects from TTPD‘s “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”\n\nTaylor\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Tailor\n\nTaylor Tie: Speaking of Taylor, we couldn’t conclude this list without including the name of the queen herself. Plus, anyone who loved seeing the Taylor trio—Ms. Swift, Taylor Lautner, and his wife, Taylor Dome—will appreciate the reference. The three have shown their friendship publicly as Taylor Lautner was asked to star in Swift’s music video for “I Can See You.”\n\nTennessee\n\nOrigin: Native American | Meaning: Where the water meets\n\nTaylor Tie: Here we’re, of course, referencing the state in which Taylor spent most of her childhood and started her music career.\n\nWinter\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Winter season"
