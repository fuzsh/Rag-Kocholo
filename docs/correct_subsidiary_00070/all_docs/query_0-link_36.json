        "text": "“The Alexa Fund was created to support companies embracing voice technology and exploring new and compelling uses for Alexa,” said Paul Bernard, director of the Alexa Fund, in a statement. “We see parenting and health and wellness as two areas where voice can make customers’ lives simpler, and Hatch Baby has a clear vision of how Alexa and other Amazon services can help them better support parents. We’re excited to give them the access and resources they need to expand their skill for Alexa and explore further integrations across Amazon.”\n\nWhat Amazon is hoping to build up with expanded parenting skills in Alexa is more engagement from parents, specifically those who are already buying connected products and using apps to help them with some of the tasks around parenthood. (Not all do or want to, nor do all need to.)\n\nAmazons’s interest in building up parenting skills gives a glimpse into how the e-commerce giant links its voice-based activities with overall engagement and purchasing on its platform: the more that people find Amazon to be a useful platform for all things parenting — including advice and enhanced voice-based features for products people already own — the more likely they will be to use and trust Amazon for making more baby- and child-related purchases big and small.\n\nToday, Amazon already has a big business in baby and childcare goods. After streamlining its own storefront strategy by shutting down the less profitable Diapers.com, today Amazon sells a significant range of everyday products. That is led by its own Amazon Elements line — and when I say “led” I mean it literally: it’s the first brand Amazon shows you. Elements made its debut in 2014 with baby wipes and diapers and it now accounts for 15 percent of all baby wipes sales on the platform, outpacing Huggies at 11 percent, according to figures from market research firm 1010data.\n\nAmazon also sells a wide range of other items that might be purchased less frequently but represent higher gross merchandise value, such as strollers and other travel gear, food-related appliances and other accessories, toys, apparel, connected scales and so on.\n\nAlongside this — and because of that breadth — the company also runs one of the most popular baby registry services. Registries are a way for people to tag items in a wish list of what they would like to have, and for friends and family to buy all that for them. They become a very effective honeypot not just for people amassing long lists of things they would like to own without buying them, but then signalling to many others to buy on their behalf.\n\nGetting promoted better in the baby registry was one reason Weiss said her company wanted to work more closely with Amazon. In turn, it’s providing more content to keep parents tied into using Amazon as their go-to platform for all things parenting.\n\n“Amazon typically does a great job with shopping, but not with engagement. We are interested as a registry partner for us to get more visibility, and they are interested in us as partner to help engage moms and dads beyond the sale,” Weiss said.\n\nBut while Alexa skills may be the order of the day, this is not the only area where Amazon and Hatch might collaborate in the future.\n\nAmazon has tapped other interesting hardware makers who first became connected to the company by way of the Alexa Fund. Perhaps most notably, it acquired smart doorbell maker Ring last year after initially investing in it.\n\n“We believe very much we’ll continue to create hardware,” Weiss said. “Our philosophy is to create better versions of the things people already use, and our road map is very consistent with that.” On the subject of how it might work with Amazon on that, all she would say is that “it is something we have engaged with Amazon on, and have been impressed about the quality of exchange with its experts.”"
