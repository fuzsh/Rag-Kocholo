        "text": "Our home testers gave their feedback on factors like comfort, ease of use, quality and assembly time, as well as reporting back on how well their children slept (and whether it was any different to normal). Products that convert for travel were a big hit this year, as were space and cost-saving cots that will grow with your baby and represent great value over time, like those that convert to beds or sofas.\n\nThis is definitely a category where families are still willing to invest, whether that's in a statement cot that'll last through multiple kids, a top notch mattress, or a top quality sleeping bag that works in all temperatures. After all, if there's one thing worth investing in, it's a good night's sleep!\n\nSee the winners in:\n\nMore like this\n\nBeside/Co-Sleeper Crib\n\nBaby Cot/Cotbed\n\nMoses Basket & Newborn Crib\n\nBaby Monitor\n\nNight-time Comforter/Sleep Aid\n\nBaby & Child Sleeptime Product\n\nNewborn Swaddle\n\nBaby Sleeping Bag\n\nBaby & Child Mattress\n\nBaby & Child Bedding\n\nBaby Bouncer/Rocker & Swing\n\nBaby Activity Mat/Gym/Centre\n\nNursery Accessory\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Ease of build, safety, quality of materials, design, effectiveness, sleep quality, extra features, convertibility and/or longevity, worth the money.\n\nGold – Joie Roomie GO, £200\n\nWhy it’s a winner: Offering good value for money, our judges and testers really rated the sleek design, adjustable side panels and smart functionality of this bedside crib. The one-handed, easily adjustable side panels of the Roomie GO are a useful feature, which will make life much easier for parents in the middle of the night. This was also a hit with sleep expert Chris McFadden, who said: “The mechanism to drop the sides is excellent – slick and easy to use and the fact it’s on both sides is good.” Although additional under-cot storage would have been helpful, having the drop function on both sides means it can be an easier fit for bedrooms, and being easily foldable it’s perfect to use as a travel cot, too. Safety-wise, the firm mattress – included with the cot – offers a safe and comfortable night’s sleep for your baby, while the mesh panels of the cot are breathable and wipeable for easy cleaning.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Emma, who tested this with their 15 week old: “This is a great product for using on the go. It is very easy to assemble and fold for taking to the grandparents’ house – who also found it very easy to use. It is light and folds down to a compact size, meaning it can fit in even a small car boot.”\n\nBuy from: John Lewis and Argos\n\nSilver — Red Kite Cozysleep Crib, £89.00\n\nBest for: An affordable bedside crib option.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kiran, who tested this with their 2 month old: \"I very much liked the design of this crib. It looked modern and would easily suit all bedrooms. It feels sturdy and of good quality and is reasonably priced. I also liked the idea of using the dead space that would have been under the crib with the handy aid of a storage shelf.\"\n\nAvailable soon.\n\nBronze — Mamas & Papas Lua Bedside Crib, £229 to £239\n\nBest for: A stylish bedside crib with extra storage.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Rebecca, who tested this with their 1 month old: “I like the additional touch of storage space underneath the crib, the changing mat and travel bag which many other cribs on the market do not offer. It is a beautifully made piece of furniture and would fit into the aesthetic of any home. The mesh panel on the side adds to the beauty but is also practical so I can see my baby at all times.”\n\nBuy from: Mamas & Papas and Boots\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Ease of build, safety, quality of materials, design, effectiveness, sleep quality, extra features, convertibility and/or longevity, worth the money.\n\nGold — Obaby Maya Mini Cot Bed, £280\n\nWhy it’s a winner: The \"super stylish” Obaby Maya range wins for the third year in a row, this time for its practical and stylish space-saving mini cot bed. Suitable from birth to approximately 4 years old, the sturdy, Scandi-inspired cot bed has an adjustable, 3-position base height. With a removable side for transformation into a toddler bed, this product grows with your child – it also includes a safety rail for a smooth toddler bed transition. The space-saving version offers ease of use for people in smaller homes, with our MFM editorial judge Gill Crawshaw stating, “As someone who lived in a small city flat with a baby, the space-saving design is perfect.” A full-size version of the cot bed is also available if you have more room to grow. Sleep expert Chris McFadden stated, “The mattress fix is excellent, and it just feels a quality made product.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kirstie, who tested this with their 20 month old: “I absolutely love the design of this cot bed. It’s so solid and clearly is a quality product. It all feels strong and like it would outlast a dozen kids! It has a very stylish design that looks beautiful.”\n\nBuy from: Robert Dyas, Baby Planet and Obaby\n\nSilver — Tutti Bambini Essentials Alba Cot Bed, £149\n\nBest for: Good quality at an affordable price.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Claire, who tested this with their 7 month old: “I love how it will transition throughout my daughter’s baby days then toddler days as a toddler bed and then change again in to a sofa for when she is older. It is stylish looking and fits well into a small space. I feel like it is a timeless piece of furniture.”\n\nBuy from: Amazon and Tutti Bambini\n\nJoint Bronze — Stokke® Sleepi™ Bed V3, from £529\n\nBest for: Chic Scandinavian style that will last a lifetime and make a statement.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Aarti, who tested this with their 2 year old: “The design of the cot is great – it is very stylish and the oval shape adds another element of luxury. It is very sturdy (my husband got inside to test it!) and feels like a well-made, high-quality product.”\n\nBuy from: Stokke and Baby Planet\n\nJoint Bronze — SnuzFino Cot Bed, £299.95\n\nBest for: A stylish, modern cot bed that turns into a fun, statement toddler bed.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Lydia, who tested this with their 4 month old: “It is well made with good quality materials. It looks stylish and the design would suit any colour scheme/nursery design. I also like that this cot can grow with my little boy.”\n\nBuy from: Snuz, Mamas & Papas and Scandiborn\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Mattress/base firmness, breathability, effectiveness, ease of build, sleep quality, extra features, worth the money.\n\nGold – Clair de Lune Organic Palm Moses Basket, £99.99\n\nWhy it’s a winner: This classic style Moses basket won over judges and testers with its great looks, use of organic materials and sustainable design. It’s hard to fault the quality of this beautiful basket, which offers a super-cosy and comfortable fit for newborns, thanks to the soft, neutral fabrics used and the supportive mattress included. Baby sleep expert Chris McFadden commented: “ I would love to put my baby in it. Overall, a gorgeous product.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Charlotte, who tested this with their 8 month old: “It feels extremely well made and high quality. The fabric is incredibly soft and the woven detail is immaculate, adding to the supporting evidence of quality, while the Moses basket feels extremely comfortable and supported.”\n\nBuy from: Very, Kiddies Kingdom and Clair de Lune\n\nSilver – Shnuggle Dreami Moses Basket and Stand, £134.95\n\nBest for: Parents looking for a modern alternative to a classic Moses basket.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Marta, who tested this with their 6 month old: “I like that the basket is versatile; it can be used as a traditional Moses basket on the stand or as a rocking basket. That's an absolutely great idea and saves so much space.”\n\nBuy from: John Lewis, Amazon and Shnuggle\n\nJoint Bronze – Purflo PurAir Breathable Crib, £199\n\nBest for: A cosy newborn sleep space with an automatic movement function.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Barbra, who tested this with their newborn baby: “The Purflo has really helped us in finding a routine for our little one during these early weeks. The detachable crib has spent as much time safely in the kitchen as it has on the frame too, which has been a major help for us having a 19 month old as well.”\n\nBuy from: Amazon and Purflo\n\nJoint Bronze – SnuzBaskit Moses Basket, £99.95\n\nBest for: A sustainable Moses basket with a minimal, modern style.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Lizzie, who tested this with their 1 week old: “I think this product is very stylish and the fact that it is so sustainably made, makes it even more attractive. Overall, I really like this product and it’s definitely a well-thought-through and unique take on the traditional Moses basket.”\n\nBuy from: Snuz, Boots and Mamas & Papas\n\nShortlisted: Babymore Air Motion Gliding Crib | DockATot Dream Weaver Moses Basket\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Quality of product, key features, effectiveness, range, safety and security, longevity, clarity of display/screen and night vision, alerts and extra features\n\nGold – Cubo Ai Plus Smart Monitor 3 Stand Bundle, £289\n\nWhy it's a winner: Winning gold for the second year running, our parent testers raved about the long list of features this smart baby monitor packs in, including movement and motion sensing (including alerts if the child's face is covered), a crystal clear HD display served up through a phone app, and built in lullabies and white noise. It's easy to set up and simple to use, despite its many features.\n\nAlthough it's an investment purchase, the \"danger zone\" coverage for older kids who've transitioned out of a cot gives it extra longevity. And finally, it looks great, with the sweet bird-shaped camera unit blending into most nurseries.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Leah, who tested this with their 19 month old: \"I cannot rate this product enough. The price tag is high but it's worth every penny and comparing it to other cameras I have used, they just don't remotely compare to the features and elements of the Cubo. What else could you possibly ask for when you can get something that monitors the room temp, baby crying/rolling over, face being covered by blankets, lack of movement...I just cannot believe they've managed to find a solution to every single worry I had with my son.\"\n\nBuy from: Amazon and Cubo AI\n\nJoint Silver – LeapFrog LF920HD 7” High Definition Pan & Tilt Video Monitor, £179.99\n\nBest for: A wi-fi free monitor with lots of smart features\n\nIn the words of parent tester Sinead, who tested this with their 17 month old: \"It is so intuitive I didn't even have to read the instructions to set it up! It is ready to use out of the box – there is no app to download or register for, or wifi network to connect to which is great as it means it can be taken on holiday, to grandparents houses etc and be set up quickly and simply.\"\n\nBuy from: John Lewis, Mamas & Papas and Argos\n\nJoint Silver – Babymoov YOO Master Plus Video Monitor, £139.99\n\nBest for: A clear monitor at a competitive price.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Katie, who tested this with their 6 month old: \"The monitor is a really good size and the screen is really clear, and its really easy to move the camera remotely using the monitor so you can always see your baby. It was really easy to set up without the need for the instructions. My son is just transitioning into his own room and this monitor has eased a lot of anxiety about him no longer being in the same room.\"\n\nBuy from: Babymoov and Natural Baby Shower\n\nBronze – Owlet Monitor Duo 2, £399\n\nBest for: Heart rate monitoring using the smart sock\n\nIn the words of parent tester Issac, who tested this with their 11 month old: \"The sock is the jewel in the crown. It is comfortable and comes with multiple sizes as your baby grows. It quickly senses your child, and tells you if it cannot. It monitors vitals very well and uses the data to neatly plot trends that you may find very resourceful and important as a parent.\"\n\nBuy from: John Lewis, Amazon and Owlet\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Quality of product, key features, effectiveness / effect on sleep, child’s reaction, worth the money.\n\nGold – ergoPouch Tuck Sheet, from £49.95\n\nWhy it’s a winner: An innovative bedding idea for babies who don’t like being swaddled, judges and parent testers praised the Tuck Sheet’s “clever and unique design.” With nothing else like it on the market, this blanket alternative attaches around the bottom of the mattress and, by tucking the baby in safely with their feet at the foot of the bed, it helps to control startle reflex, keeping them snug at night. The Tuck Sheet stood out as a simple idea that really works to help babies – and parents – get more sleep.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Charne, who tested this with their 4 month old: “The ergoPouch Tuck Sheet does exactly what it says! It has helped my son’s sleeping patterns and given us much needed rest at night. The zip-up firmness of the Tuck Sheet really helps settle him – he falls asleep within seconds. I am really impressed by the durability as well. We use it on top of a swaddle, and we finally get a full night’s sleep.”\n\nBuy from: ergoPouch and Natural Baby Shower\n\nSilver – Jaspar The Dreamy Elephant, £49.99\n\nBest for: A child-friendly sleep companion that can help with separation anxiety and bonding.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kayleigh, who tested this with their 4 month old: “The sounds, including the recording function, are really clear. I am going to be away from my son for the first time next month and like that I’ll be able to record messages for him so, hopefully, he will be soothed by my voice.”\n\nBuy from: Amazon, Argos and The Dreamy Elephant Company\n\nBronze – Nuby Penguin Sleep Aid with Cry Sensor, £24.75\n\nBest for: An easy-to-use sleep aid with a variety of different sounds.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Charlotte, who tested this with their 22 month old: “I like that you can pick from a choice of 4 different sounds (rain, heartbeat, lullaby, white noise). I tested the product on my 3 month old and he especially loved the lullaby sound, which was helpful in calming him down when he was crying.”\n\nBuy from: Nuby, Boots and Amazon\n\nShortlisted: VTech BC8313 V-Hush Pro Soothing Sleep Trainer\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Ease of use, quality, safety, design, worth the money, effectiveness.\n\nGold – My Little Morphée, £89.95\n\nWhy it’s a winner: With a beautiful look and feel, plus smart features that allow children to use this independently, the My Little Morphée was a hit with parent testers and judges. As a portable, disconnected device that plays sounds, music, and stories to children, it allows for a soothing experience before sleep or whenever calm is needed. Using the child-friendly dials, your little ones can pick an animal narrator and then guide their own listening experience. With a pastel and Scandi-inspired wood design it will also look great in your nursery, with MFM expert judge, Gill Crawshaw, commenting: “It looks very stylish, with lots of attention to detail, such as the small cut-out stars.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Laura, who tested this with their 6 year old: “The Morphée box has really helped with some calm time for our daughter. It has helped her to be less reliant on screens and smart devices to listen to stories, and has helped her switch off a bit more.”\n\nBuy from: Selfridges and Morphee\n\nSilver – Pabobo by Angelcare Aqua Dream Whale Nightlight Projector, £45\n\nBest for: A soothing night time projector with a child-friendly design and lights that really set the scene.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Grace, who tested this with their 7 month old: “My daughter enjoys using the product; it relaxes her and keeps her occupied for a good period of time. The different sounds also stimulate her further and create a lovely sensory experience.”\n\nBuy from: John Lewis, Amazon and Kiddies Kingdom\n\nBronze – Pabobo by Angelcare Lumicolour Bear Nightlight, £35\n\nBest for: A portable nightlight with fun additional features.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Jessica, who tested this with their 5 month old, 3 year old and 5 year old: “This nightlight is really lovely – it’s nice to look at as an adult and my children loved it. There is a good amount of light given off, I like the colour changing feature and it is super handy that it’s rechargeable.”\n\nBuy from: John Lewis and Amazon\n\nShortlisted: Panda Kids Memory Foam Bamboo Pillow | Purflo Sleep Tight Baby Bed\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Quality of fit, comfort for baby, ease of use, design, softness of fabric, ease of washing and drying, value for money.\n\nGold — Purflo Swaddle To Sleep Bag, £29\n\nWhy it’s a winner: Suitable from newborn to around 4 months old, this beautifully soft item converts from a swaddle, which can be used with arms in or out, to a sleeping bag, with poppers to take in or let out the length and arm holes. The unique features of the swaddle/bag make it stand out: the breathable panels are “a genius way to ensure baby is safe and comfortable,” said one tester, while another praised the hip-friendly leg design that reduces the risk of hip dysplasia and the “great zip that comes from the top of the neck downwards, making it easy to change the nappy overnight.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Sarah, who tested this with their 2 week old: “This is really well made, well thought out and fits perfectly, especially around the neck, hips and legs – not too tight but snug enough so the material doesn’t ride up. I’ve washed and tumbled it every few days and it’s still in perfect condition, with no fading or bobbling.”\n\nBuy from: John Lewis, Amazon and Purflo\n\nSilver — Juicy Bumbles Baby Swaddle, £22.99 for 3\n\nBest for: An affordable set that's super simple to use for first-time parents.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kiran, who tested this with their 6 week old: “Thanks to its clever design, this swaddle was very easy to use and would be a game-changer in the early hours of the morning. The material felt soft and the quality of the velcro was good, effectively keeping my baby’s arms wrapped snug.”\n\nBuy from: Amazon and Juicy Bumbles\n\nJoint Bronze — Love To Dream Swaddle Up Original for Moderate Temperatures, £27.99 to £38.99\n\nBest for: Infants who like to sleep with their arms up.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Jade, who tested this with their 1 month old: “With just one, 2-way operated zip to put on and take off, this unique arms-up swaddle is quick and easy to put on and remove, while the slightly stretchy, soft material allows for a close fit for babies of different shapes and sizes.”\n\nBuy from: Amazon and Love To Dream\n\nJoint Bronze - ergoPouch Cocoon Swaddle Bag, from £26.95\n\nBest for: A good choice of tog ratings.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Maya, who tested this with their 3 month old: “Our baby sleeps for hours at a time swaddled in this because it swaddles him and prevents newborn startle, but still allows for movement under the 2-way zip thanks to the high-quality stretchy fabric. It can also be used as a sleep bag by undoing some poppers to make arm holes.”\n\nBuy from: Scandiborn and ergoPouch\n\nShortlisted: Baby Bamboo Muslins | DockATot Swaddle\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Comfort for baby/child, ease of use, quality and design, ease of washing and drying, value for money.\n\nGold — Purflo Baby Sleep Bag, £39 to £45\n\nWhy it’s a winner: With breathable mesh panels and removable sleeves, this sleep bag comes in 3 sizes – including an option for toddlers – and is designed to be used in a range of temperatures, from a chilly 40 degrees to a balmy 22 degrees. Another USP is the travel-friendly design, which allows a 5-point harness to be threaded through the bag. Our testers were really impressed, hailing it, “easy to use, stylish, secure, comfortable and brilliant for nighttime sleep thanks to zips on the front of the bag that make for quick and effortless changing.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Megan, who tested this with their 19 month old: “The fact it can be used all year round, so there’s no need for different bags, is great and it's the first sleeping bag I've seen with detachable sleeves, which my son appreciated. The harness slit is handy if you need to travel with your baby at night and the broader age ranges for sizes give longer use, which adds value.”\n\nBuy from: Purflo\n\nSilver — Merino Kids Go Go Sleeping Bag, £99 to £119\n\nBest for: Changing temperatures, thanks to the temperature adjusting merino wool.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kathleen, who tested this with their 13 month old: “Since using this generously sized sleeping bag, my son has slept through the night more, probably because the self-regulating properties of the superfine merino wool lining mean when it is cold in his room, the bag keeps the heat in and my baby warm and snug, and when it’s hot, it draws the heat out, keeping him cool and comfortable.”\n\nBuy from: Merino Kids and Natural Baby Shower\n\nJoint Bronze – Love to Dream Organic Sleep Bag for mild temperatures £42.99\n\nBest for: A roomy sleeping bag with sleeves\n\nIn the words of parent tester Emilia, who tested this with their 18 month old: \"What I like about it most is it's material. It feels really nice against the skin and has an appearance of a well made product. From a functionality viewpoint, I like that it has sleeves and a twin zipper, which is very useful especially for younger babies. I am thinking about buying a \"warmer\" version for the rest of the winter, which speaks for itself.\"\n\nBuy from: Love to Dream\n\nJoint Bronze — DockATot Sleeping Bag, from £55\n\nBest for: Beautiful designs and high quality fabrics.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Claire, who tested this with their 8 month old: “Made from beautiful soft fabric and in stunning reversible designs, this bag is especially roomy at the bottom and washes really well. The chunky, long zip made middle-of-the-night nappy changes a breeze as you can unzip the whole of the bottom of the bag and get it right out of the way.”\n\nBuy from: Scandiborn and DockATot\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Comfort for baby/child, safety, ease of cleaning, ease of use, quality of product, worth the money.\n\nGold – Obaby Moisture Management Mattress, £150\n\nWhy it’s a winner: Our testers and judges were impressed with the clever, innovative design of this mattress, making it comfortable for babies and toddlers, and practical for parents too. With a moisture management system consisting of a zipped top panel on top of a water-resistant under layer, the top layer can be removed and washed in case of any spillages or accidents.\n\nDespite being waterproof, the under layer is soft, meaning you still use it as a sleeping surface while the top panel is in the wash. There’s a firmer side for newborns, made of breathable and hypoallergenic layers of coir covered in lambswool. Flipping the mattress over, the other side of the mattress has individual pocket springs covered in foam, offering support and comfort for toddlers. This means that, along with the waterproof cover, this mattress should last for years. Sleep expert Chris McFadden was impressed, commenting: “Good quality and feel, good fit to the cot, love the waterproof feature and also the flip from softer to firmer. Just an excellent product.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Janet, who tested this with their 2 year old: “It's so simple to use; the removable layers makes washing the mattress easy. The built-in water-resistant layer can be slept on whilst the top layer is in the wash, which is super helpful.”\n\nBuy from: Dunelm, Amazon and Obaby\n\nSilver — SnuzSurface Pro Adaptable Cot Bed Mattress 70x140cm, £189.95\n\nBest for: Parents looking for a quality mattress that grows with your child.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Lydia, who tested this with their 4 month old: “This mattress is great quality and is designed to grow with my little one. I like that it is comfortable and supportive for my baby whilst he is sleeping.”\n\nBuy from: Snuz, Boots and Mamas & Papas\n\nBronze — miniuno Coolmax Pocket Spring Mattress, £129\n\nBest for: Children who get hot at night.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Claire, who tested this with their 7 month old: “The fact it helps to regulate my baby’s temperature is a key benefit. It is lovely and thick, which provides my baby with comfort for a good sleep; worth the money.”\n\nBuy from: Little Angels Prams\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Comfort for baby/child, ease of washing, ease of use, design, quality of fabric, product features, worth the money.\n\nGold — Panda Kids Cloud Bamboo Duvet, £59.95\n\nWhy it’s a winner: Our judges felt the Panda Kids Cloud Bamboo Duvet is a soft, luxurious, and good quality duvet that’s worth the investment for parents. With a 4.5 tog rating, it is suitable for use all year round, as the bamboo microfibres keep children warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. This means parents don’t have to buy different seasonal duvets.\n\nThe bamboo is hypoallergenic and suitable for sleepers who suffer from eczema, sensitive skin or hay fever, and it is also antibacterial too. Testers praised the additional touches such as the loops on each corner that allow you to fix the duvet inside the bedding, which is ideal for restless sleepers. They also liked the clear washing instructions, and that the duvet can be machine washed at home.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Emma, who tested this with their 3 year old: “Top marks for quality and design. You can tell it's a very-well made product. The added benefits of it being hypoallergenic and anti-bacterial gives us extra peace of mind.”\n\nBuy from: Panda London and Amazon\n\nSilver — Silverguard Supima Cotton Cot Bed Sheet, £40\n\nBest for: Keeping clean between washes.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Claire, who tested this with their 7 month old: “Although expensive, it is worth the investment as I think it will last for a number of years. So far, after washing a couple of times it still looks new. It is self sanitising which is very helpful with small children and older siblings, helping to keep germs at bay in between washes.”\n\nBuy from: Silverguard\n\nBronze — Cailiekins 22 Momme Mulberry Silk Co-sleeper Sheet, £48\n\nBest for: Delicate skin and protecting hair (especially curls and coils).\n\nIn the words of parent tester Hannah, who tested this with their 4 month old: “The product was well made and felt good quality; it washed well and didn’t deteriorate in the wash at all. It even helped soothe the milk spots and dry patches on our daughter’s skin. Overall, a lovely high-end product.”\n\nBuy from: Caliekins\n\nShortlisted: Panda Kids 100% Bamboo Bedding\n\nKey features we tested/judged — Comfort and entertainment for baby/child, ease of use, design, quality of product, product features, worth the money.\n\nGold — Babymoov Swoon Evolution Swing, £279.99\n\nWhy it’s a winner: A multi-functional swing with an impressive array of features, sounds and movements for your baby, this is a stylish design parents will love. Our judges felt the Babymoov Swoon Evolution Swing was a game-changer in the baby swing market, offering a wide variety of functions including 8 different motion movements, 5 different seat positions, as well as multiple sounds, in a soft and secure design that’s comfortable and entertaining for baby. While it is more expensive than some other baby swings, our testers felt it was worth the money, with one commenting, “this is a high-ticket item. However, now we have it, I don't know how we lived without it.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Laura, who tested this with their 10 week old: “The cushion is incredibly soft and textured and the newborn insert is well-padded to provide support. This is definitely the most comfortable baby product we have used. The Babymoov Swoon Evolution Swing provides some valuable hands-free time and I can feel confident that my baby is safe whilst using it. This definitely makes a busy life a tad easier!”\n\nBuy from: Boots, Mamas & Papas and Natural Baby Shower\n\nSilver — Mamas & Papas Tempo Bouncer, £99\n\nBest for: A good value manual bouncer.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Beth, who tested this with their 3 month old: “The quality and design of the bouncer is great and you can tell it has been well thought through with good attention to detail. The bouncer itself is robust and the fabrics used feel soft and of a good quality. The design is minimal with muted colours so would go well in the majority of spaces.”\n\nBuy from: Mamas & Papas\n\nBronze — Ergobaby Evolve 3 in 1 Bouncer, £189.90\n\nBest for: A manual bouncer with a stylish, neutral design.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Ellouise, who tested this with their 5 month old: “The bouncer is very well made and of a really good quality.

The gym includes a variety of toys, sounds and textures to help stimulate your baby's hearing and imagination, as well as an additional tummy time pillow. We liked how the detachable toys can also be used when out and about, providing added value. Suitable for use from birth, the arches can be removed to transform the activity gym into a playmat, offering longevity of use for your baby. Our testers liked the fact it was incredibly easy to set up, the lack of plastic, and the additional features such as the mirror toy, which you can attach it to any of the arches at a suitable height for your baby. One tester commented: “My son was totally obsessed.”\n\nIn the words of parent tester Abigail, who tested this with their 3 month old: “It is extremely well priced, especially when you consider the high quality materials, longevity of use and multi-functional abilities. The variety of toys is good, from rattle sounds and squeaker sounds to ribbons, teething ring, and the mirror.”\n\nBuy from: Small Smart\n\nSilver — Red Kite Baby Go Round Entertainer, £69.99\n\nBest for: A colourful and engaging baby play centre that’s a good all-rounder.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Alka, who tested this with their 7 month old: “The Baby Go Round Entertainer helps to keep my son in a more upright position instead of lying down.

It works well for all ages; my older daughter has been practising her forward rolls on it. I love that you can switch up the pattern and/or colour, though the best part is how easily you can wipe it clean – perfect for spills, messy play, mucky fingers and weaning!”\n\nBuy from: Munchkin & Bear\n\nSilver — Moppet Hand-embroidered Wall-Hanging Tapestry in Sumbal design, £165\n\nBest for: A beautiful gift and family heirloom.\n\nIn the words of parent tester Kate, who tested this with their 1 year old and 3 year old: “It's not only a fantastic piece of artwork but also provides a lovely learning tool for teaching children the alphabet.
