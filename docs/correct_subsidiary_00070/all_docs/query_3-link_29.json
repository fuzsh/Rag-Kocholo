        "text": "This photo was taken on December 25, 2018. Three days later, I was taken to the Psych ER. And it wasn’t because I’m crazy. It’s because I’m a mother. Three days prior, I had my first of many breakdowns that holiday. Let me set the scene. We were packing for a trip to Michigan for Christmas ... ... my toddler was screaming ... suitcases and clothes were everywhere ... my four-month-old needed to be fed ... I was weaning from nursing and injured pumping ... my husband was scrambling to make a bottle I was sitting on the floor, covered in “stress” hives (yes, that’s a thing), head in hands, sobbing and crippled by overwhelming anxiety. Happy Holidays, right? Postpartum depression does not discriminate. It doesn’t care … … how driven you are … how much you prepare for bringing a child into the world … how many books or blogs or apps you read … how many classes you take or mom friends you make … how big or small your career is … how much room exists on your plate (if any) When you don’t sleep for months on end and you are responsible for keeping a tiny, helpless human alive, the pressure builds like a ticking time bomb ready to detonate. And trust me, mine was a Molotov cocktail. You know how people joke about pregnancy hormones? And how “crazy” women can be before, during and after giving birth? It's not funny. “The postpartum hormone drop is considered the single largest sudden hormone change in the shortest amount of time for any human being, at any point of their life cycle.” Here are a few other facts on postpartum depression: ... 1 in every 7 moms experience it each year ... it affects more women than breast cancer annually (2x) ... only 15% of women receive treatment I thought I did everything right. I tried so hard. But, I couldn’t get over it. I couldn’t push through it. I couldn’t will myself out of it. This happens to moms every day. When it happened to me, I was one month back to work and still having a very hard time recovering from my delivery. And let's talk semantics. “Delivery” is a light-hearted sounding term for the most insane thing a woman can do in this universe – push a human out of her body. And “maternity leave?” That sounds lovely, doesn’t it? It’s not. It’s childbirth recovery. Motherhood – especially in the first few months postpartum – has been one of the loneliest and most difficult roles I’ve held in my entire life. And I love my children. That's not the point. You can’t pour from an empty cup. So, during Mental Health Awareness Month and on the heels of Mother's Day and #maternalmentalhealth week, I share this: Don’t wait until you’re in crisis to prioritize yourself. And to those of you reading this who aren’t moms, check in on the ones you know and love – especially those with babies. You may ask the question that finally answers their call for help. #mentalhealth #HypeWomen"
