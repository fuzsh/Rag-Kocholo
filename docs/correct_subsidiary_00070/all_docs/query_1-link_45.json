        "text": "It appears \"50 Shades of Grey\" and the band One Direction provided inspiration for the top baby names of 2012.\n\nWhile Sophia and Aiden hold tight to top spots, Mia and Jack made their way into this year's top 10 list.\n\nBabyCenter.com announced today the top 100 baby names of 2012 based on the names of 450,000 babies born in 2012 to moms who registered on the site.\n\nThe top five girls names include Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Isabella and Ava while Aiden, Jackson, Ethan, Liam and Mason round out the top five names for boys.\n\n\"A unique or unusual name remains one of the top qualities parents seek in a baby name, but it's trending down,\" said Linda Murray, BabyCenter Global Editor in Chief. \"Parents are looking for more substance in baby names. They want names with more significance.\"\n\nMoms weren’t only focused on names with meaning this year, according to the website's news release. As always, pop culture had a big influence, with celebrities, athletes, and politicians also leaving their mark. Additionally, characters in TV shows and books sent moms’ imaginations running wild.\n\nSome other baby-naming trends of 2012 include:\n\n* \"50 Shades of Grey\" The name Grey is up nearly 20 percent, Anastasia jumped by 10 percent, and Ana climbed 35 spots.\n\n* London From singing sensations to the royals and the Olympics, it was a year with great focus on the UK. Four out of five band members' names from One Direction were up this year, and the fifth, Liam, ranks number four on the top 100 list. The name Harry is up 57 percent since last year and Pippa increased by 35 percent.\n\n* Funny ladies First names of comedians, such as Amy Poehler (41 percent) and Maya Rudolph (25 percent) climbed the charts. And let's not forget about Betty White — the name Betty increased 54 percent this year.\n\n* Smartphones The name Apple rose 15 percent for girls and Mac for boys jumped 12 percent. Siri, the company's voice-enabled personal assistant climbed 5 percent.\n\n* Leading men Reagan increased 46 percent and fellow past presidents Kennedy, Carter, Lincoln and Nixon all jumped in the rankings. No such luck for Barack, Mitt, Joe or Paul.\n\n* Space In 2012, names like Sky, Star, Luna, Skylar, Heaven, Stella and Mars made their way onto the top 100 list."
