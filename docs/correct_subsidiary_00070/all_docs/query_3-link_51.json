        "text": "I‚Äôm popping back on to post today‚Äôs scheduled consultation, and thank you for your kind words and prayers for my mother-in-law and our family!\n\nKate and her husband are expecting their second baby! Their older son is:\n\nWilliam Finn, who goes by Finn\n\nLove love love. I adore Finn, and it‚Äôs SO cool that it‚Äôs a middle for William.\n\nKate writes,\n\n‚ÄúFinn‚Äôs first name was a no-brainer because it‚Äôs a meaningful family name on both sides ‚Ä¶ [however we] could not agree on a nickname for William (I like Bill or maybe Will, he liked Liam but I didn‚Äôt) so we decided to just call him by his middle name. I don‚Äôt even remember how we came across Finn, but [my hubs‚Äô] family identifies strongly with their Irish heritage and I thought it was cute, so it was a winner.\n\nThis baby is probably a girl (per an early ultrasound), but we‚Äôre looking for both a girl and boy name in case he/she changes her mind at the anatomy scan. üòâ\n\nMy husband and I have very different naming styles ‚Äî and personalities altogether ‚Äî which made it a miracle we decided on Finn‚Äôs name and is making it very difficult this time around ‚Ä¶ my style is a little more ‚Äúhipster‚Äù, his is a lot more plain-Jane (his words, not mine!) We are both leaning towards a French name for a girl this time around (my family is French and Polish.)‚Äú\n\nFor girls,\n\n‚Äúour top contender for Finn was Geneva Eloise. Geneva is a family name on Jeff‚Äôs side, a great-grandmother he was very close to. I still like it, but I‚Äôm not sure I love it. We were/are considering the nickname Vivi or Gemma.\n\nFor middle names with Geneva, I like Stellamaris and Azelie, but am open to more ideas. I‚Äôm not sure they sound quite right. I/we are also open to new first name ideas though Jeff says he‚Äôs very attached to Geneva. Other family names are Margaret (my side), Aileen (my side), Helen (his side.)‚Äú\n\nAnd for boys,\n\n‚Äúwe have literally zero ideas. I love Francis and Walter, my husband does not like either. We have no new ideas. Anything would help.‚Äù\n\nOkay! Not to fear! I can always come up with ideas! üòÄ I love Geneva Eloise with the nicknames Vivi or Gemma, so sweet! I also love Stellamaris and Azelie as middle names. I have nothing more to say, they‚Äôre just great ideas.\n\nFor those who don‚Äôt know, I almost always start my consultations by looking up all the names the parents have used and liked in the Baby Name Wizard book as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that match the entry in terms of style/feel/popularity. It‚Äôs uncannily accurate! Between that research and other, and my own namey head, these are my suggestions for boy and girl names (I tried to be heavier on the boy names but ended up with seven suggestions for each gender!):\n\nGirl\n\n(1) Genevieve or Vivienne\n\nGeneva made me think of Genevieve right away, so Kate and her hubs probably won‚Äôt like it, since Geneva‚Äôs a family name and Genevieve loses that, but I had to suggest it. Or maybe it could be seen as a nod to Geneva while giving the baby her own name? St. Genevieve is the patron saint of Paris, which is great! And Vivienne also has the strong V sound and the French spelling, and both Genevieve and Vivienne can take the nicknames Vivi or Evie. So cute!\n\n(2) Juliette\n\nJuliet‚Äôs one of my very favorites, and Juliette‚Äôs a beautiful French variant. Lovely!\n\n(3) Sylvie\n\nWhen I saw Sylvia pop up in my research, I immediately thought of Sylvie and thought it was a great suggestion for this family! It‚Äôs got the V of Geneva, and it‚Äôs kind of like Sophie but not nearly as popular. This reader named her baby Sylvie Regina, which I just about died over! It sounds so like the Marian hymn ‚ÄúSalve Regina,‚Äù so cool!\n\n(4) Beatrice\n\nThis also showed up in my research, and it reminded me of the family I did a consultation for recently whose mom is from France, and all the girls have French names. Beatrice made me think of it because it‚Äôs the mom‚Äôs name, and Bea is one of my favorite nicknames for a little girl.\n\n(5) Clementine\n\nClementine is actually a style match for Eloise, I love it! Not least because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmercy‚Äù name ‚Äî perfect for a baby born during the Year of Mercy!\n\n(6) Helene\n\nI wondered what they‚Äôd think of Helene? Kate said that Helen and Aileen are family names, and Aileen is sometimes considered an Irish variant of Helen, and Helene is the French variant. That same French family I mentioned above has Helene as one of the girls‚Äô middle names, it‚Äôs a beautiful name, and St. Helena is great. Nell is a great nickname for Helene, a la little Helen Borobia, who sometimes gets called Nellie Peg (for Helen Margaret! I die!)!!\n\n(7) Magdalen(e) or Madeleine\n\nMagdalen(e) just seemed like a name Kate and her hubs would like, and I have no real reason except my gut feeling! The French variant is Madeleine of course, but I don‚Äôt know, I was just feeling Magdalen(e) for this family. I love that you can get Maggie as a nickname, which is always so darling. But I‚Äôd be 100% happy with Madeleine too, and if they liked the combo Madeleine Sophie,after St. Madeleine Sophie Barat, I‚Äôd be even happier!\n\nBoy\n\n(1) Robert nicked Rory\n\nI was really excited to get into the boy names! William Finn is just the greatest combo, so I feel like it has some big shoes to fill. The first one I thought of right off the bat was Robert as a first name with the nickname Rory. Robert is a style match for William and Rory is a style match for Finn and I just totally love this option.\n\n(2) George nicked Geo or Geordie\n\nCan you all see that I‚Äôm going for a solid, traditional first name with a more offbeat nickname? I love that! I love the nickname Geo for George, so cool! Another possibility, which is really fun, is Geordie (pronounced Jordy), which I believe is a Scottish diminutive of George. (Fun fact: I have ALWAYS been in love with the nickname Jordy and tried to get my husband on board. I was never successful.)\n\n(3) Theodore or Leo\n\nTheodore matched up with Geneva and Francis style-wise, so of course I had to suggest it, and I‚Äôd actually already scribbled Leo in my notes for this baby before I‚Äôd even started doing research, because my brother and SIL ‚Äî whose taste seems to me to be pretty similar to Kate and her husband‚Äôs ‚Äî named their son Leo. Theo and Leo share sounds, so I‚Äôd say it might be a matter of do they prefer short (Leo) or long with a shorter nickname (Theodore/Theo)?\n\n(4) Jude (Julian?)\n\nJude and Finn are amazing brother names in my opinion! Jude also has that Catholic cachet that‚Äôs so great. I‚Äôve seen Jude used as a nickname for Julian, and the Beatles‚Äô song Hey Jude was written for Julian Lennon, so there is precedent for doing so, and I thought Kate and her hubs might like that option.\n\n(5) Owen\n\nThis is another one informed both by the style of Finn, and by my brother and SIL, who named their Leo‚Äôs little brother Owen! St. Nicholas Owen is an awesome patron for a little Owen.\n\n(6) Conrad or Connor\n\nConrad probably seems a little bit out of left field, but it‚Äôs a style match for both Geneva and Eloise, so I thought it deserved a mention. I love the name Conrad, and my hubs and I actually considered it for our youngest! I could also see Conner used as a nickname, which is pretty cool and pretty similar to Finn. Or maybe Connor as a first name? I love it!\n\n(7) Arthur nicked Archie or Abe\n\nArthur is totally because they like Francis and Walter! And Archie and Abe are nicknames I‚Äôve recently seen used by parents of Arthurs, who were total hipsters. I love Archie, I think that‚Äôs brilliant for Arthur; the Arthur who‚Äôs Abe has a B middle name, so it makes sense, so perfect.\n\nAnd those are my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little brother or sister of William Finn?\n\nShannon, from the blog We, A Great Parade, and her husband are expecting their third baby and third son! This new baby boy will join big brothers:\n\nAlyosha Daniel\n\nMoses Emmanuel\n\nAmazing, right? Handsome, unusual, and full of faith significance, love them. üëå\n\nShannon writes,\n\n‚ÄúOur first son was adopted at 11 months old from Uganda ‚Ä¶ We chose Alyosha because of the main character in The Brothers Karamazov and also loved that it means ‚Äúdefender of mankind‚Äù. We chose Daniel because we wanted a solid, simple Biblical name to balance out the unusual first name. At the time we were Protestant, but now that we‚Äôre Catholic I like that his name is somewhat related to St. Aloysius.\n\nOur second son (first biological baby) is named Moses Emmanuel ‚Ä¶ We chose Moses obviously because of the Biblical character but also because we just really liked the name. And I‚Äôve kind of loosely made St. Moses the Black his patron üôÇ We chose Emmanuel because he was born during Advent.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ we love names that are less commonly used but that also bear significance because of a person (even fictitious) that they represent. While we do love saints names, we couldn‚Äôt just pick a random one simply because we liked it. We would want the person to reflect a trait that is particularly dear to us, OR for the name meaning itself to do so.\n\nWe are devoted to the teachings of the Catholic Worker, so people like Dorothy Day or Peter Maurin are ones we have kept in mind in addition to saints. We‚Äôre trying to steer away from Biblical figures at this point since we already have a Daniel and a Moses. Additionally, since our oldest son is adopted and a different race than the rest of us, we ideally would like to avoid using the letter M in the first name ‚Ä¶ since that would subtly group together the biological boys and leave him out. That may be something we change our minds on, but is where we‚Äôre at right now.‚Äù\n\nI really enjoyed thinking of Shannon‚Äôs three boys and her and her husband‚Äôs lovely desire that Alyosha not feel left out name-wise. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to learn more about Servant of God Dorothy Day, one of the four Americans Pope Francis mentioned in his Address to Congress in September, and Peter Maurin, neither of whom I‚Äôd known much about before Shannon‚Äôs email. All in all, this was a really great dilemma to work on!\n\nNames that are currently on their list include:\n\nOliver (‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs super cute, we love that it symbolizes peace, and my family is Irish so naming after St. Oliver would be a kind of homage to that‚Ä¶ BUT we don‚Äôt know anything about him really.‚Äù)\n\nTheodore (‚ÄúAgain a really cute name, great meaning (gracious gift), but again don‚Äôt know much about the saint‚Äú)\n\nBrien (‚Äúonly as a middle name‚Ä¶ my maiden name is O‚ÄôBrien and I‚Äôd like to pass it on‚Äú)\n\nMaurin (‚Äúafter Peter Maurin‚Ä¶ we both love this one but we run into the problem with the M. Peter is just too common for our tastes. Any creative ideas for a nickname maybe?? We‚Äôve also thought about Day for Dorothy Day, maybe too short and awkward though. Or Aristide which is Maurin‚Äôs first name, but my hubs says Aris is too weird‚Äú)\n\nBasil (‚Äúmy husband likes saint Basil, and favors this name, but I‚Äôm afraid it would come across as hipster to the majority of the world, along the lines of Sage, Juniper, Willow, etc‚Äú)\n\nTevye (‚Äúthe Yiddish version of Tobias, another person we don‚Äôt actually know much about. My husband likes this one too but I‚Äôm not sold because it doesn‚Äôt mean anything special to me‚Äú)\n\nOkay, a quick comment on some of the ideas on their current list before jumping into my ideas:\n\nI love Oliver, and I totally agree that it‚Äôs super cute. St. Oliver Plunket is a great saint for a boy, especially an Irish boy, and one of the things I‚Äôve learned about him recently is that he wrote about Divine Mercy ‚Äî what a meaningful tidbit for a baby born during this Jubilee Year of Mercy!\n\nTheodore‚Äôs a great name too, but it feels a little tame for this family‚Äôs taste. I could see them liking the variant Fyodor more, but is that too much Karamazov Bros.? At the same time it could be really great ‚Äî Moses and the new baby have the biological connection; Alyosha and the new baby would have a Russian/Karamazov name connection.\n\nI was interested by Maurin. If it weren‚Äôt for the M, it seems like it would be a perfect name for Shannon and her hubs ‚Äî offbeat because of it being a last name, and the name of a man they admire. Shannon asked about a nickname ‚Äî Maury and Manny were the first two that came to mind. But that pesky M ‚Äî I agree that maybe an M name wouldn‚Äôt ideal for this baby (unless they change their minds on that, and then of course I‚Äôd support their decision 100%!) ‚Ä¶ then I thought of Aury, which is a little bit of a stretch but not THAT much of a stretch. I looked it up to be sure it wasn‚Äôt considered a girl‚Äôs name (since I know how fussed any of my boys would be if they had what they consider a ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs name,‚Äù especially if the other brothers had explicitly masculine names), and though I couldn‚Äôt find much about Aury, what I did find (babynamewizard.com had an entry for ‚ÄúAury Estela,‚Äù a girl‚Äôs name, and behindthename had a user-submitted entry saying Aury is a boy‚Äôs name ‚Ä¶ babycenter.com had Aury listed as a boy‚Äôs name as well, but no other info) leads me to think there‚Äôs enough evidence that it‚Äôs not overwhelmingly considered to be feminine and therefore could easily be used for a boy. I kind of liked the idea of a given name Maurin ‚Äî starting with an M like brother Moses ‚Äî being called Aury on an everyday basis, which starts with an A like brother Alyosha. I thought that could be a really nice subtle connection between all the brothers, and not so obvious that they‚Äôd feel locked into anything if they were to have more children.\n\nI like the idea of Day, and I saw it used recently as a middle name for a girl (for Dorothy Day) ‚Äî so cool! As a first name it‚Äôs certainly short, but so is Todd, for example, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs problematic. I guess I‚Äôm having a hard time thinking of it on a boy, since the two people I associate with the name are Dorothy Day and that little girl I know with the middle name Day ‚Ä¶ but of course last names are a great source of first names for boys ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to know what the rest of you think of Day as a first name for a boy! I would love it as a middle name.\n\nI have similar issues with Basil as Shannon does ‚Äî I love it, and I think it‚Äôs a great, underused saint‚Äôs name, but I hate that most Americans would only think of the herb. I looked up its alternate versions in other languages, and wondered what Shannon and her Mr. would think of one of the Eastern European variants like Vasil or Vasyl? I assume they‚Äôre pronounced to rhyme with Basil, and the V and B are so similar that it‚Äôs almost exactly the same name sound-wise, but it loses the herb/hippie feel.\n\nI was surprised by Tevye because it‚Äôs a biblical name and Shannon had said they wanted to stay away from them. So then I assumed she meant they wanted to stay away from biblical names that *sound* biblical to Catholic Americans, which I think is easier to work with than ‚Äúno biblical names,‚Äù and I employed this in one of my ideas below.\n\nOkay! So onto those ideas! You all know that I almost always start a consultation by looking up the names that the parents have used and the ones that they like in the Baby Name Wizard as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity. Taste like this family‚Äôs, which is more creative and offbeat, tends not to be served as well by the BNW, but I did get some ideas from it, as well as from my own mental archives:\n\n(1) Julius or Julian/Julien\n\nThe BNW actually came through in a big way with this first suggestion‚ÄîJulius was listed as similar to both Moses and Theodore! And Julian is a style match for Oliver! So of course I had to suggest these names. But then‚ÄîI was researching Peter Maurin a little bit and discovered that he was born in the village of Oultet within the community of Saint-Julien-du-Tournel! What! I got goosebumps when I read that!\n\n(2) Ciar(an)\n\nI was thinking of various ways of naming Shannon‚Äôs third boy that would make sure Alyosha didn‚Äôt feel left out in any way, and one of the ideas I had was to make sure this baby boy had a name completely different from either of his brothers‚Äô names in terms of first letter and linguistic origin/variant, just like Moses and Alyosha are totally different. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I like Oliver‚Äîit‚Äôs Irish/Celtic/British, which is totally different from Alyosha and Moses. But then I was also thinking that‚Äîand I hope this doesn‚Äôt seem insensitive at all‚Äîboth of her other boys share the color black‚ÄîAlyosha in his skin and Moses in his patron saint of Moses the Black. So I kind of loved that Ciar means black in Irish‚Äîit ties into the really subtle shared black characteristic of her boys while still being its own name totally different from the other two. Ciar is a name on its own (said like KEER), and the more familiar Ciaran (KEER-in, more commonly spelled Kieran) is technically a diminutive of Ciar.\n\n(Along with this same line of thinking, it‚Äôs pretty cool to know that Maurin is related to Mauritz/Maurus/Maurinus, all of which mean ‚Äúdark skinned,‚Äù so if Shannon and her hubs do decide to go that route, that have that connection between all the brothers.)\n\n(3) Jasper\n\nJasper was listed as a style match for Oliver, and it‚Äôs also a gemstone that can be black, tying into the idea I presented with Ciar(an) above. Black jasper is not very common, but it was cool to read that the ‚Äúname blackstones refer to any number of stones, including jasper, that are dyed black and polished for jewellery.‚Äù Jasper is the name traditionally given to one of the Three Wise Men (you might also see its variants Casper and Gaspar given for that same Wise Man‚Äîthey‚Äôre all the same name).\n\n(4) Form of Peter\n\nThis is the idea I mentioned that Tevye, being biblical but not obviously so to most English speakers I think, inspired, as well as Peter Maurin of course. Shannon said they‚Äôd considered Maurin‚Äôs first name Aristide and its variant and possible nickname Aris, but I wonder if they‚Äôd considered any of the Peter variants? They aren‚Äôt obviously biblical to English speakers, but would still honor Maurin pretty explicitly. Pierre would be a great one, since Maurin was French; Piers is an English variant; Peadar is Irish and is said more like PAD-der (patter).\n\n(5) Clement\n\nClement was inspired both by the Jubilee Year of Mercy, as it means ‚Äúmerciful,‚Äù and I‚Äôm a big fan of the idea of naming babies born this year with some element of mercy in their names!, and also by the fact that Shannon‚Äôs due in May, which is the month devoted to Our Lady, and Clement can be considered Marian (as she‚Äôs described as clement [=merciful] in the hymn/prayer Salve Regina, for example).\n\nBut after I‚Äôd already decided to suggest Clement to them for those reasons, I came upon this quote of Dorothy Day‚Äôs in regard to the Catholic Worker: ‚ÄúOur rule is the works of mercy,‚Äù and one of its tenets is ‚Äúdaily practice of the Works of Mercy.‚Äù What a meaningful name Clement would be for this family on so many levels!\n\n(6) Cyprian\n\nAlong the same lines as the ‚Äúblack‚Äù idea above, I thought maybe the name of an African saint would be cool, and I immediately thought of Bl. Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi. Cyprian‚Äôs a cool name and unusual, I really like it for this family.\n\n(7) Roman or Tiber\n\nI liked Roman as an idea for this baby initially because it has a long O like Aloysha and Moses, another subtle connection between the brothers, and the reason I liked that particular name-with-a-long-o is because I always think of Roman as a Catholicky Catholic name, as it calls to mind (for me) the Vatican, the Pope, Roman Catholic, etc.\n\nThinking along those lines also made me think of Tiber, which is the name of a river in Rome, and the phrase ‚Äúcrossing the Tiber‚Äù refers to someone converting to Catholicism. It‚Äôs a really cool name with a really cool meaning for convert parents. (Check out an adorable Tiber here. üôÇ ).\n\nAnd those are my ideas! What do you all think? What would you suggest for Alyosha and Moses‚Äô little brother?\n\nOkay everyone, buckle up ‚Äî this is a daddy of a consultation! In more ways than one! Yes, it‚Äôs really long (twenty-three ideas for this couple! What!) (You‚Äôll see why!), and also, it‚Äôs a papa that commissioned me to do this consultation!\n\nCameron is one of my most loyal and encouraging readers, and I‚Äôm delighted today to post this consultation for he and his wife Chelsey, who are expecting their first baby ‚Äî a boy!\n\nC&C have fully agreed on Jude Alden as an amazing combo that they both love, that has great meaning for them as well ‚Äî a great, saintly first name and a nod to Chelsey‚Äôs dad in the middle.\n\nBut what would a consultation be without a dilemma? For this couple, it‚Äôs that Cameron‚Äôs full name is John Cameron, and his dad‚Äôs first name is John as well. Cameron loves the idea of giving his firstborn son the first name John, like he and his dad, and have him go by his middle name. BUT he and Chelsey love Jude Alden. And they can‚Äôt figure out a John ___ name they like as much or better.\n\nCameron writes,\n\n‚ÄúSince my dad and I are both first borns and both have ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù as our first name, I always thought it‚Äôd be really cool to turn that into a tradition should God bless me with a boy first ‚Ä¶ Jude Alden just hit us in the face one day when we were out and about and we just stopped and knew right away that we loved that name. It is a power hitter name regards to our faith; being one of the apostles, and honors Chelsey‚Äôs father for his middle name! üôÇ\n\n[I feel like] Jude Alden is the perfect name‚Ä¶ for a younger brother. Chelsey would gladly name it for the first born ‚Ä¶ However, after having that discussion with you a while back regarding Jude in the spotlight, I have heavily considered giving up my ‚Äúmade up tradition of John + something‚Äù to replace it with Jude Alden as a first born, thinking that maybe we‚Äôll never get the chance to use the only name we‚Äôve both come up with and loved.\n\nObviously Jude Alden is the forerunner. It could very possibly happen that when we see our boy, we just know it‚Äôs a Jude and that‚Äôs that. We are coming to you to help us with our ‚ÄúJohn Dilemma‚Äù.\n\nJohn is the beloved apostle and I (Cameron) have a dear devotion to him and his connection with Our Lady. I love John for being a very strong solid name, and the thought of tying in another name to that is so exciting. But Jude Alden is stellar‚Ä¶ who knows.‚Äù\n\n(Cameron calls it a ‚Äúmade up tradition‚Äù because he wasn‚Äôt actually named John [something] *because* his dad was, it just worked out that way.)\n\nExcept for Jude Alden, Cameron and Chelsey have pretty different taste in names. For Cameron,\n\n‚ÄúI personally am not a big fan of super ‚Äúsecular‚Äù sounding names like ‚ÄúHunter, Derek, Brad, Jordan, etc‚Ä¶‚Äù or names along those lines for the MAIN NAME that we would call our child. We have tossed around ideas including a secular name as a middle name (or first, doesn‚Äôt matter what order, really) for example, but not the name we could call him. That includes several, obviously, so I wouldn‚Äôt write all those out. ‚Ä¶ I love good solid Catholic names. You know that. Raphael, Gabriel, Paul, John, Jude, Titus, Daniel. Chelsey and I have been thinking about not being TOO obsessive (mainly me) about having a super well known Catholic name, because we love the thoughts of our children being new saints, thus creating a new name for other families using in reverence and honor‚Ä¶.if that makes sense.‚Äù\n\n(I totally cracked up at this: ‚ÄúChelsey and I have been thinking about not being TOO obsessive (mainly me) about having a super well known Catholic name‚Äù!! üòÄ )\n\nChelsey, on the other hand,\n\n‚Äúlikes uniqueness‚Ä¶ Chelsey likes names that are a little bit more ‚Äúrare‚Äù but still have a good sound to it, if that makes sense ‚Ä¶ [she doesn‚Äôt] like names that are very common, and [she‚Äôs] also not a fan of names that can appear boring, e.g. Paul, Bob, Tom, Sam, etc.. Some names [she does] like are killed by the shortened versions e.g. Elijah- Eli.‚Äù\n\nNames Cameron likes but Chelsey doesn‚Äôt:\n\nPaul (‚ÄúI‚Äôd totally go for John Paul for obvious reasons, JPII!!!‚Äú)\n\nEzekiel\n\nIsaac\n\nRaphael\n\nSamuel\n\nAugust (‚Äúbooooo‚Äù [John August is Cameron‚Äôs favorite combo])\n\nElijah\n\nDominic\n\nName Chelsey likes but Cameron doesn‚Äôt:\n\nEzra\n\nName they both kind of like:\n\nIgnatius (but Cameron worries that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSUCH a heavy hitter, that it almost seems to be too much‚Äú)\n\nNames that are no-go‚Äôs:\n\nGarett\n\nGraham\n\nAnd finally, for reference, some girls‚Äô names they‚Äôve discussed and like:\n\nLillian\n\nGrace/Gracie\n\nWillow\n\nHaven\n\nNoelle\n\nAlrighty, first off, the idea of John+[something] is just one of those things that can‚Äôt be ignored. You know? On the one hand, I want to say that Jude Alden, being the name Cameron and Chelsey both agree on and love, is the perfect option for their little boy. On the other hand, naming traditions can be so meaningful, and given that John+something is Cameron‚Äôs name and his dad‚Äôs name, as firstborns, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the kind of thing that they can shelve for now and maybe consider if they ever have a second boy. I think this baby boy here is their one shot at John+something. So that‚Äôs kind of a lot of pressure! It might seem like they‚Äôre down to ‚Äúfamily tradition‚Äù (which happens to nicely coincide with Cameron‚Äôs particular devotion to St. John the Evangelist and Our Lady, beautiful) vs. ‚Äúfavorite name, and the one we can happily agree on.‚Äù\n\nI posted a while ago on whether parents should reserve names for later use at the expense of using them now or vice versa (in that example it was ‚ÄúFelix now at the expense of Felicity later?‚Äù but it works perfectly for John+[something] vs. Jude Alden) and two things that came up in the comments seemed really helpful: (1) name this baby as if he/she were your last baby, and (2) in light of that, which name would you be sadder not to ever get to use? If this little boy is the only little boy that C&C are ever blessed with, would they be sadder to not use John as a first name in the tradition of Cameron and his dad, or the handsome and agreed-upon combo Jude Alden? (Cameron actually commented on that post ‚Äî this is a really hard dilemma for them, which has been hanging over them for a while!) (Also, if you want to get a glimpse of these sweetest expectant parents, click on his username!)\n\nSo my main goals (and my hopes for you all in the comments!) is either to come up with a John+ name that will make them both really happy and not feel like they‚Äôre settling, or help them realize Jude Alden is *the* answer, and either way not set them up for name regret later. Cameron started emailing me about this dilemma several months ago, and we‚Äôve had quite a long conversation about it ‚Äî I‚Äôve suggested several (where ‚Äúseveral‚Äù=‚Äù23‚Äù) ideas to them, and since none of them have hit quite the right note, I hope you all can come up with something that‚Äôs just right (or maybe Jude Alden is meant to be this little boy‚Äôs name?). My ideas are:\n\n(1) John Alden, called Jude\n\nThis is probably my top option. It has all three of the elements they both want: John, Alden, and Jude. I know it‚Äôs an offbeat idea ‚Äî you all know I totally specialize in offbeat nickname ideas! So I get it if it‚Äôs just too crazy for C&C. It‚Äôs the kind of choice that they‚Äôd really have to be 100% with and just own it ‚Äî telling people firmly and consistently that yes, his given name is John Alden, and yes, he‚Äôs called Jude exclusively.\n\n(2) John Jude Alden, called Jude\n\nThe two-middle name option isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it‚Äôs a tactic often employed when there are a bunch of names that parents can‚Äôt choose between.\n\n(3) John Thaddeus, called Jude\n\nThis is probably the one that‚Äôs closest to my own personal taste. Thaddeus is after St. Jude Thaddeus, and I think his full name is familiar enough to people that if you say his name is John Thaddeus but you‚Äôre calling him Jude, people will probably raise eyebrows because it‚Äôs an unorthodox way of getting to Jude, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄúWhere the heck do you get Jude from John Thaddeus??‚Äù Another nice thing is that with the ‚ÄúJ‚Äù of John and the ‚Äúude‚Äù that‚Äôs contained within Thaddeus, Jude is almost like a mashup nickname of the first+middle names. Finally, Thaddeus is a style match for Ignatius and Raphael ‚Äî it‚Äôs got loads of Catholic cachet; it‚Äôs also super biblical like Chelsey‚Äôs Ezra and several of the names Cameron likes. If they were to go with John Thaddeus nicked Jude, they‚Äôd have two of their three important elements ‚Äî John and Jude. It‚Äôll be important to consider whether or not Chelsey‚Äôs dad will be upset with not being included in their first son‚Äôs name.\n\n(4) John Ignatius\n\nI think it‚Äôs really telling that C&C are both considering Ignatius ‚Äî besides Jude Alden, it‚Äôs the only name they listed that they‚Äôre both okay with! John Ignatius is an amazing combo. I know that Cameron said he doesn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúmain name‚Äù their son will be called (sometimes called a ‚Äúcall name‚Äù in the naming world) to sound secular, which I totally get. But I suspect that Chelsey might not mind that so much, and perhaps a good compromise between their tastes would be a heavy hitting super duper Catholicky Catholic given name, like John Ignatius, with a friendlier, more accessible nickname/call name, which I think usually sound secular. I don‚Äôt think Gus translates as Catholic, for example, even though St. Augustine is such a big deal, and Gus is a natural nickname for it. Does that make sense? Anyway, with that in mind, John Ignatius with a great nickname might be just the thing for this baby. I‚Äôve seen Iggy, Nate, and Nash as nicknames for Ignatius ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think Iggy‚Äôs their taste; Nate‚Äôs a pretty safe choice ‚Äî familiar, masculine; and I‚Äôm going to guess that Cameron hates Nash and that Chelsey thinks ‚ÄúHuh. Nash is kinda cute.‚Äù But I‚Äôd let it sit for a while! I wrote a while ago about when Mom and Dad have different tastes and how to deal with that ‚Äì heavy hitting given names with cooler/friendlier nicknames were one way to go (I blogged about it here: https://sanctanomina.net/2015/01/14/baby-name-consultant-he-likesshe-likes/, and reworked it into a column for CatholicMom here: http://catholicmom.com/2015/04/15/patrick-vs-polycarp/). An easy nickname also helps to deal with Cameron‚Äôs concern that Ignatius is ‚ÄúSUCH a heavy hitter, that it almost seems to be too much.‚Äù\n\n(5) John Ezra, called Ezra\n\nMost of the time, if I knew Dad really felt strongly about a certain first name, I would unequivocally think the fairest thing would be for Mom to get full rights to the middle name. This situation is a little trickier because their son would actually go by his middle name and C&C will both have to deal with calling him by that name every day for his whole life, so it‚Äôs not as easy as picking a mostly hidden middle name. But their tastes are actually not that far off from each other! Cameron‚Äôs picks of Ezekiel, Isaac, and Elijah are all style matches for Chelsey‚Äôs Ezra, so I feel like it shouldn‚Äôt be that much of a thing to scooch closer together, you know? Of course, I also know that‚Äôs not really how naming works ‚Äî you both like what you like and that‚Äôs just the way it is. But I‚Äôd consider John Ezra. Something Cameron wants, something Chelsey wants. Ezra‚Äôs a really cool name I think, and while it doesn‚Äôt have the Catholic cachet the names on Cameron‚Äôs list have, I think the full ‚ÄúJohn Ezra‚Äù steers it more in that direction. For what it‚Äôs worth, I also think John Ezra and Jude Alden are amazing brother names! Similar lengths, and Ezra and Jude sound really cute together.\n\n(6) John Caleb\n\nCaleb is a great name in my opinion, and a great style match for the Old Testament names they both like. It can also take the awesome (imo) nickname Cal, if they wanted to do a nickname. So cute!! But then Chelsey said some names that she might otherwise like are ‚Äúkilled by the shortened versions e.g. Elijah-Eli‚Äù ‚Äì I don‚Äôt feel like I have a good handle on what nicknames she would consider dealbreakers (I loved the examples of Paul, Bob, Tom, Sam, etc. ‚Äì perfect! But I‚Äôm less sure about the more uncommon nicknames, like Cal, for example. I was also surprised to see she doesn‚Äôt like Eli, as I would probably have thought she would have liked it). I don‚Äôt think Caleb needs a nickname, and I don‚Äôt think most people would think to shorten it to a nickname. I also like that John Caleb would share initials with Dad ‚Äì another nice connection.\n\n(7) John Roman\n\nRoman is another one that seems like it might be just perfect. It can be heavy duty Catholicky Catholic, with its ties to (in my mind) the Pope, the Vatican, Roman Catholicism, etc. But I think it can also appeal to those who prefer names that are a little less heavy ‚Äì there are some celebs that have used the name Roman, for example, like Cate Blanchett, Molly Ringwald, Debra Messing, and Rodney Peete. It‚Äôs a style match for Raphael, Dominic, and Noelle, and the similar sounding Ronan is a style match for Haven, all of which I thought was pretty awesome. John Roman is really handsome. (Or John Ronan?)\n\n(8) John Gabriel\n\nGabriel is a style match for Isaac, Raphael, Samuel, and Elijah, as well as being a great Catholic name ‚Äì St. Gabriel the Archangel brings to mind Our Lady and the Annunciation, which are beautiful Marian tie-ins for a boy. Gabe is one of the best nicknames imo, and I‚Äôve often thought Gil could totally work too. John Gabriel rocks.\n\n(9) John Kolbe or John Xavier\n\nI wonder what they‚Äôd both think of Kolbe? I‚Äôm feeling like it might overlap really nicely with both their styles. It can sound trendy, like Colby and Coby and Cody, but it‚Äôs St. Maximilian Kolbe all the way. Loads of Catholic families I know have been choosing it for their sons; it‚Äôs a great option, and very recognizably Catholic. Kole could also work as a pretty cool nickname. I love John Kolbe.\n\nI‚Äôm including Xavier in the same category because it‚Äôs a saint‚Äôs last name that‚Äôs being used as a first name. It‚Äôs gotten popular recently, but I still think it comes across as exclusively Catholic. I really like John Xavier.\n\n(10) John Francis\n\nOkay, hear me out ‚Äì Francis is St. Francis of Assisi, it‚Äôs Pope Francis, it‚Äôs awesome. But most people I‚Äôve talked about it with don‚Äôt care for Francis as a call name, and I‚Äôm guessing Frank/Frankie isn‚Äôt really C&C‚Äôs style. So I wonder what they‚Äôd think of the nickname I keep pushing on people for Francis: Finn? One of the things about Catholicky Catholic names is that you might be saddling a child with a name that‚Äôs too heavy for them when they‚Äôre little, so having nicknames that are easy and friendly, or that fit in with their peers, can sometimes be as much a gift as the Amazing Saint Name you gave them. Does that make sense? So there are going to be a lot of little Finns this year, because of the new Star Wars movie, but he‚Äôs a great character, and a little John Francis would happily and easily fit in with his peers if he went by Finn.\n\n(11) John Matthias\n\nMatthias might really work for this baby as well. He‚Äôs in the New Testament ‚Äì he was chosen by the Apostles to replace Judas, so I think Matthias can be considered a really Catholic name, since his selection was the result of an official meeting of the Apostles ‚Äì one of the first (if not THE first) Church Councils perhaps? In a manner of thinking? It‚Äôs got that heavy biblical feel that Ezekiel, Isaac, Samuel, Elijah, Jude, and Ezra have as well, and could shorten to Matt/Matty if you like (one of the objectively coolest people I‚Äôve ever known has a son named Matty, so you know Matty‚Äôs a good nickname! Haha!).\n\n(12) John Bryant\n\nIn emailing with Cameron I discovered that Bryant‚Äôs an important family surname for Chelsey, and I wondered if she‚Äôd like to balance Cameron‚Äôs family first name pick with her own family middle name pick? Bryant‚Äôs a great surname to have in the family mix to have if you‚Äôd ever want to consider using it for a child, because it‚Äôs so first-namey.\n\n(13) John Michael, John Miles, John Milo\n\nMiles and Milo were my first ideas here‚ÄîI know you all have seen me suggest them ad nauseam to others on the blog but darn it, I‚Äôm going to keep suggesting it til someone uses it! üòÄ I love them because they‚Äôre Marian! The Irish name Maolmuire, which means ‚Äúdevotee of Mary‚Äù has been anglicized as Miles/Myles/Milo! I‚Äôve also seen Miles and Milo offered as offbeat nickname ideas for Michael, so I thought if C&C kind of liked Miles and/or Milo but were still hesitant, maybe John Michael would work for them with the nickname Miles or Milo?\n\n(14) John Connor\n\nThe combo John Connor reminded me of John Cardinal O‚ÄôConnor, the amazing archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York who founded the Sisters of Life‚Äîa great association! Connor‚Äôs a great name.\n\n(15) John Owen\n\nI‚Äôm dying over brothers Owen and Jude, love! And St. Nicholas Owen has been a favorite of mine for a while‚Äîhe built hiding places for priests in England and was martyred for the faith. And it‚Äôs also my newest nephew‚Äôs name. üôÇ\n\n(16) John Elliott\n\nElliott has strong connections to the faith‚Äîin origin it‚Äôs a diminutive of Elias, which is the Greek form of Elijah. I‚Äôve always considered Elijah/Elias/Elliott to be Marian, because the cloud the prophet Elijah saw on the water from Mt Carmel in the book of Kings is said to have represented Our Lady. Indeed the Carmelites trace their history back to Elijah and that incident‚Äîthey were venerating Our Lady long before she was born. It gives me goosebumps to think about!\n\n(17) John Charles nicked Cal\n\nC&C did actually let me know that they both liked the nickname Cal from my Caleb suggestion, which made me think that maybe Charles was the answer. Cal is a traditional (though somewhat uncommon) nickname for Charles, and Charles is all kinds of awesome‚ÄîJP2‚Äôs birth name was Karol, which is the Polish for Charles; there‚Äôs also St. Charles Borromeo and one of my new favorites Bl. Karl of Austria and a bunch of others. This ties in well (I think) with their decision to not be ‚ÄúTOO obsessive about having a super well known Catholic name‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs got impeccable credentials but doesn‚Äôt hit you in the face with it.\n\n(18) John Leo\n\nPope St. Leo the Great! It‚Äôs also on the rise popularity-wise, having cracked the top 100 or the first time since 1937 in 2014 after rising steadily since 1995, so it‚Äôs got appeal beyond the Catholic world.\n\n(19) John Robert nicked Rory or Bo\n\nI suspect that Chelsey‚Äôs first reaction to Robert will be ‚Äúugh‚Äù! But St. Robert Bellarmine is a great saint, so maybe Cameron will like it, and updating the nickname options from Bob(by) or Rob(by) to Rory or Bo might do the trick. Rory is a style match for some other names that are similar to Jude, like Finn. Brothers Rory and Jude would be so cute! And I‚Äôm including Bo because my brother and SIL, parents of the Owen I mentioned above, considered Bo as a nickname for their next baby, and Robert was one of the suggestions I gave them for a way to get to it.\n\n(20) John William nicked Will or Liam, or John Liam\n\nWilliam is as solid as they come, and Will and Liam are great nicknames. Liam was actually a style match for Willow, which is what encouraged me to suggest it. There are a whole bunch of Sts. and Bls. William, and one is also known as Bl. Liam Tuiridh.\n\n(21) John Damian/Damien (nicked Danny or Denny?)\n\nFinally, Damian is a style match for Noelle, and of course I immediately thought of St. Damian (of Damian and Cosmas fame) and St. Damien de Veuster (sorry to Chelsey, I have the ‚Äúuber Catholic name‚Äù bug like Cameron! It‚Äôs just how my namey mind works!) and wondered what they‚Äôd think of them? Damien‚Äôs one of those that I‚Äôve tried to convince my hubs of, and he won‚Äôt have any of it because of the demon child in the 1970s horror movie The Omen, which I‚Äôve never seen and neither has he, but people do seem to associate that movie with these names. Which just kills me. Although, the popularity of the name has actually increased since that movie came out! Both variants are impeccably saintly, and though neither has traditional nicknames, I‚Äôve often thought Danny (for Damian) and Denny (for Damien) could work.\n\n(22) John Thomas or John Timothy nicked Ty or Trey or Trip(per)\n\nI know Chelsey said she didn‚Äôt like Tom, but I was thinking if they use John for this baby, he‚Äôll be the third Murray boy in succession to have John as his first name. So Trey could totally work as a nickname for him, and really it doesn‚Äôt matter what his middle name is, they could still use Trey, but I thought a ‚ÄúT‚Äù middle name might be the most appealing. Thomas and Timothy were the two I thought might be the best, not having any particular hardcore Catholic feel even though they *are* hardcore Catholic. Then the idea of Timothy reminded me that I‚Äôve seen Ty used as a nickname for it, and I quite liked that too: John Timothy nicked Ty.\n\nTrip(per) is because I know another boy who‚Äôs the III and he‚Äôs always gone by Tripper, I love it. Totally sounds like an athlete‚Äôs nickname, no? (And not to get totally crazy here, but one could possibly think of Trey/Trip(per) as a nod to the Trinity. Oh man.)\n\n(23) John [middle name meaning ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù or otherwise referring to St. John] nicknamed Trey, Trip(per) if desired\n\nThis is actually a brand-new suggestion for C&C, which I haven‚Äôt yet offered. Piggybacking on the previous suggestion and my assertion that C&C can call their baby Trey or Tripper no matter what his middle name is as long as his first name is John, I thought I‚Äôd suggest some names that could refer specifically to St. John the Beloved Disciple:\n\nAmatus ‚Äî means ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù\n\nErasmus, Erastus ‚Äî mean ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù\n\nDavid ‚Äî likely meaning ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù\n\nCruz ‚Äî means ‚Äúcross,‚Äù referring to the Cross of Crucifixion and the fact that St. John the Beloved was there with Him, and that Jesus gave His mother to St. John from the Cross (though I would use the ‚Äúcroos‚Äù pronunciation and not the Spain-Spanish ‚Äúcrooth‚Äù)\n\nJohn Amatus, John Erasmus, John Erastus, John David, and John Cruz are all all pretty amazing (I‚Äôm loving John Cruz! I actually love it without the Trey/Trip nicknames ‚Äî Cruz is great!).\n\nWhew! Okay! Those are all my ideas, but I‚Äôm dying to hear yours ‚Äî what would you all suggest for this family torn between John+[something] and Jude Alden? Or any advice?"
