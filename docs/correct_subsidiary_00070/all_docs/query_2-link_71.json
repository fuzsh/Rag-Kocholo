Baby Center currently consists of numerous women (and men) who are violating the website's established guidelines for the community through name-calling, foul language, personal attacks, threats, sarcasm in the form of bullying, and group bullying, in which a series of of women form together in a community post to ridicule and torment community members. It is an unsafe environment for pregnant women and all people in general. Many of the comments and feedback from hateful people could be potentially harmful to members which may result in suicide due to the severity of the torment. The Baby Center Community team refuses to permanently dispose of people creating these types of environments despite trouble makers being reported by other members and should subsequently be shut down as the lack of concern for their members could lead to self-harm, health issues, & psychological hardship."
