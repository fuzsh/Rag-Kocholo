        "text": "I had decided I was going to name my daughter Simran when I was 11 years old. It was a name I never wavered from and love even to this day. Fast-forward 22 years to when my first daughter was born: We named her Naavya. Three years later, we had a second daughter; her name is Saanvi. When I planned on having a daughter named Simran, I clearly forgot that I'd have to take my husband's preferences into account.\n\nIf you're struggling the way we were, get inspired by these Indian and Hindu baby girl names. As you go through this list, you may notice these trends emerge: names inspired by Indian cities and Hindu goddesses, along with names ending in -ya. My daughters’ names are Naavya and Saanvi (named after the Hindu goddess, Laxmi), so I obviously am a trendsetter of sorts. If only my husband recognized my greatness.\n\nNote: Indian is the seventh-largest country in the world, and is filled with over a million people. There are many languages spoken — Hindi, Bengali, Marathi — just to name a few, as well as religions practiced, each with their own customs. To put this together, I referenced the Social Security Administration (SSA), which provides a list of the top 1,000 most-used baby names, to gather names at a macro level. I also gathered additional names at a micro level by reaching out to small businesses who sell South Asian-inspired baby products: , the maker of diverse plush toys that sing Hindu prayers, Her Sun & Stars Co., which sells the softest minky blankets and Creative Crafty Mom, who provides crafts and gifts for special occasions. They each provide personalization, making them a treasure trove of trending names.\n\nPopular Girl Names in India\n\nIf you want to be on the up-and-coming, these are the modern names that are on trend right now, according to BabyCenter in India.\n\nAditi\n\nAdvika\n\nAarvi\n\nAswi\n\nDiya\n\nJahnavi\n\nKashvi\n\nMau\n\nMehar\n\nNiharika\n\nPari\n\nPihu\n\nPrisha\n\nRehanshi\n\nRidhi\n\nSharvi\n\nTanvi\n\nTiya\n\nVamika\n\nZiana\n\nIndian Girl Names Inspired by Cities\n\nYou can draw inspiration from these Indian cities.\n\nAjanta\n\nAvanti\n\nFarida\n\nJhansi\n\nMirza\n\nNavi\n\nRanchi\n\nSahara\n\nSurya\n\nVaishali\n\nIndian Names Inspired by Hindu Goddesses\n\nIn Hinduism, there is a trinity of goddesses: Laxmi, Saraswati and Durga. And yet, there are more than 300 names for just the three of them. So there’s a high chance a name you pick could very well be named after a goddess.\n\nAashvi\n\nAmala\n\nDevi\n\nDhanyasri\n\nIndira\n\nIlaa\n\nKamala\n\nKalyani\n\nLakshmi\n\nLalita\n\nMeera\n\nPragya\n\nSaanvi\n\nSarika\n\nShakti\n\nShyla\n\nSita\n\nTarini\n\nUma\n\nVama\n\nThe author’s two daughters, named Naavya and Saanvi.\n\nIndian Baby Girl Names Ending in -ya\n\nWhy the sudden proliferation of names ending in -ya? I have no clue — these things tend to go in cycles. On the Social Security Adminstration's list of the top 1,000 girl names in the United States, many of the most popular girls' names all end in an -ia sound, as in Olivia, Sophia and Mia, which is pretty similar. They sure sound pretty, don’t ya think?\n\nAarya\n\nAdhya\n\nAgastya\n\nBhavanya\n\nDivya\n\nJaya\n\nJiya\n\nLavanya\n\nNavya\n\nKimaya\n\nPravya\n\nSaumya\n\nSatya\n\nShreya\n\nZoya\n\nShort Girl Names\n\nFor those who like to keep things short and sweet, these names are five letters or fewer.\n\nAria\n\nAyla\n\nEesha\n\nImara\n\nLiya\n\nMahi\n\nMaya\n\nMila\n\nMyra\n\nNila\n\nRia\n\nRoja\n\nRuhi\n\nVera\n\nZara\n\nLong Girl Names\n\nLonger names are becoming a trend in the United States, and these fit right in.\n\nAadhavi\n\nAnushka\n\nChinmayi\n\nDhruvika\n\nSuhasini\n\nJasmine\n\nKareena\n\nSarasvati\n\nShaurya\n\nShaniya\n\nShivani\n\nShivaya\n\nSiddhiksha\n\nVedanshi\n\nZunaira\n\nMore Names to Consider\n\nWhether they're named after cities, goddesses or something else entirely, your baby will end up with a name they make their own. Here's a list to inspire you.\n\nAanya\n\nAlani\n\nAmara\n\nAmulya\n\nAniya\n\nJivika\n\nJiyana\n\nKavya\n\nKhushi\n\nKiyana\n\nMisha\n\nNidhi\n\nNihira\n\nNirvi\n\nNisha\n\nNyra\n\nPritha\n\nPriya\n\nRahi\n\nSaiya\n\nSajani\n\nSamara\n\nSana\n\nSiya\n\nSonia\n\nSuri\n\nTashi\n\nVeena\n\nZiya\n\nZoha"
