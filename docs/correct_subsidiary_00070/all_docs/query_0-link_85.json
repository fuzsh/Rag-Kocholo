        "text": "BabyCenter's top 100 names of 2020 are here a little early, but seeing as the list is based off the over 520,000 parents who shared their babies' names so far this year, we think it's safe to say that the data is ready to be analyzed! (To note: BabyCenter separates yearly name lists based on the sexes of the babies according to the parents who share data.)\n\nAs expected, much of the top 20 is fairly unchanged, with Sophia maintaining the top spot for girls for the 11th year running, and Liam the top name for boys for the second year in a row. On the girls' side, the names in the top 10 didn't change a bit, and while names like Caden, Elijah, Grayson, Lucas, and Noah danced around on the boys' list, they all remained in the top slots. The one change? Mateo squeaked into the number 10 spot, pushing Muhammad to number 11."
