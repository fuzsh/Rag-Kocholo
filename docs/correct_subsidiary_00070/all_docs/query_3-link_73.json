        "text": "The most popular baby names of 2023 have been revealed, with Liam losing its top spot for the first time in five years. Noah is now the most popular boys' name, according to BabyCenter, a leading digital parenting resource. The top three girls' names remain unchanged from last year, with Olivia, Emma, and Amelia still favorites.\n\nA spokesperson from BabyCenter said: \"Noteworthy trends in baby names include nicknames used as first names, girl names from Barbie and Wednesday, and names inspired by sports documentaries like Beckham and Messi Meets America.\"\n\nInterestingly, fewer parents are choosing names inspired by cities, states, and countries, despite travel increasing this year. There's also been a drop in Oppenheimer-related names, and parents have shown their love for the Roy family from Succession through their baby name choices.\n\nA spokesperson from BabyCenter shared: \"Nicknames are overtaking 'proper' names: Names that were once considered nicknames are now, in many cases, being used on their own as first names. Ellie (No. 15) is more popular than Elizabeth (No. 41) and Eleanor (No.31); Josie (No. 85) outranks Josephine (No. 146); Theo (No. 20) tops Theodore (No. 38); and Leo (No. 8) stands above Leonardo (No.141).\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'I gave my daughter a name inspired by social media - the internet hates it'\n\nTop boys' name for 2023 in order:\n\nNoah\n\nLiam\n\nOliver\n\nElijah\n\nMateo\n\nLucas\n\nLevi\n\nLeo\n\nEzra\n\nLuca\n\nAsher\n\nJames\n\nEthan\n\nSebastian\n\nHenry\n\nMuhammad\n\nHudson\n\nMaverick\n\nBenjamin\n\nTheo\n\nKai\n\nJackson\n\nMichael\n\nDaniel\n\nAiden\n\nGabriel\n\nJosiah\n\nMason\n\nJack\n\nElias\n\nGrayson\n\nAlexander\n\nLuke\n\nJulian\n\nJayden\n\nDavid\n\nLogan\n\nTheodore\n\nWyatt\n\nCarter\n\nSamuel\n\nOwen\n\nWilliam\n\nWaylon\n\nEzekiel\n\nMiles\n\nMatthew\n\nIsaiah\n\nJacob\n\nSantiago\n\nCaleb\n\nJohn\n\nJoseph\n\nThomas\n\nAdam\n\nAmir\n\nIsaac\n\nNolan\n\nNathan\n\nZion\n\nJeremiah\n\nLincoln\n\nAdrian\n\nAnthony\n\nCooper\n\nEli\n\nMicah\n\nCameron\n\nEnzo\n\nRyan\n\nRoman\n\nRowan\n\nXavier\n\nJaxon\n\nWesley\n\nWeston\n\nAndrew\n\nJoshua\n\nSilas\n\nColton\n\nCharlie\n\nParker\n\nChristopher\n\nGreyson\n\nLuka\n\nAtlas\n\nDominic\n\nChristian\n\nMyles\n\nBrooks\n\nKayden\n\nAustin\n\nAaron\n\nOmar\n\nAmari\n\nAxel\n\nBeau\n\nJasper\n\nLandon\n\nMax\n\nBabyCenter's reports draw insights from more than 300,000 babies born in 2023 to parents who are registered on the BabyCenter website. As the leading authority on baby name trends and news, BabyCenter has been releasing reports about baby names since 2004.\n\n\"BabyCenter's baby name reports are unique because we're able to analyse self-reported data from hundreds of thousands of our members in real time,\" says Christine Mattheis, Group VP, of Content and Brand Solutions at BabyCenter. \"This enables our team to spot trends much faster than baby name reports that rely on data from the Social Security Administration, which is only reported once annually for the prior year.\"\n\n*An AI tool was used to add an extra layer to the editing process for this story."
