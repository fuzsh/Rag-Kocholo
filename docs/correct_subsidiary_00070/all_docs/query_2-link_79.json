        "text": "It has been the most popular boys name for five years - but Liam has finally been unseated as Noah reigns supreme. BabyCenter, the world’s leading digital parenting resource, has revealed its most popular baby names of 2023 as new trends make their way onto the scene.\n\nAccording to their findings from The Most Popular Baby Names of 2023 and The Hottest Baby Name Trends of 2023, Noah came out on top in this year's list, followed by Liam and Oliver. The three most popular baby names for girls mirror those of last year, with Olivia, Emma, and Amelia, on top.\n\nA BabyCenter spokesperson said: \"Noteworthy trends in baby names include nicknames used as first names, girl names from Barbie and Wednesday, and names inspired by sports documentaries like Beckham and Messi Meets America.\"\n\nWhen it comes to names that are declining in popularity, fewer parents are finding inspiration from cities, states, and countries, even as travel has soared this year. There has also been a decline in Oppenheimer-adjacent names, and parents showed their true alliances to members of the Roy family from Succession via their baby name choices.\n\nA BabyCenter spokesperson added: \"Nicknames are overtaking 'proper' names: Names that were once considered nicknames are now, in many cases, being used on their own as first names. Ellie (No. 15) is more popular than Elizabeth (No. 41) and Eleanor (No.31); Josie (No. 85) outranks Josephine (No. 146); Theo (No. 20) tops Theodore (No. 38); and Leo (No. 8) stands above Leonardo (No.141).\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nRead more: 'Entitled neighbor throws parties in my garden every week - I'm beyond fed up'\n\nTop girls' names for 2023\n\nOlivia\n\nEmma\n\nAmeli\n\nSophia\n\nCharlotte\n\nAva\n\nIsabella\n\nMia\n\nLuna\n\nEvelyn\n\nGianna\n\nLily\n\nAria\n\nAurora\n\nEllie\n\nHarper\n\nMila\n\nSofia\n\nCamila\n\nLayla\n\nNova\n\nEliana\n\nElla\n\nViolet\n\nHazel\n\nWillow\n\nChloe\n\nIvy\n\nScarlett\n\nPenelope\n\nEleanor\n\nElena\n\nAvery\n\nNora\n\nAbigail\n\nEmily\n\nMaya\n\nIsla\n\nDelilah\n\nNaomi\n\nElizabeth\n\nGrace\n\nZoey\n\nEmilia\n\nRiley\n\nZoe\n\nPaisley\n\nAthena\n\nLeilani\n\nMadison\n\nVictoria\n\nAyla\n\nStella\n\nLucy\n\nKinsley\n\nIris\n\nGabriella\n\nLainey\n\nAaliyah\n\nSerenity\n\nAddison\n\nAlice\n\nBella\n\nSadie\n\nSophie\n\nAmara\n\nAutumn\n\nSummer\n\nEmery\n\nEverly\n\nValentina\n\nHannah\n\nBrooklyn\n\nMadelyn\n\nNatalie\n\nLeah\n\nMaria\n\nSavannah\n\nAmira\n\nAubrey\n\nJade\n\nJasmine\n\nEden\n\nSkylar\n\nJosie\n\nClara\n\nAdeline\n\nElliana\n\nMillie\n\nLillian\n\nMelody\n\nSarah\n\nEva\n\nRuby\n\nFreya\n\nLyla\n\nAdalynn\n\nLiliana\n\nDaisy\n\nNevaeh\n\nTop boys' name for 2023\n\nNoah\n\nLiam\n\nOliver\n\nElijah\n\nMateo\n\nLucas\n\nLevi\n\nLeo\n\nEzra\n\nLuca\n\nAsher\n\nJames\n\nEthan\n\nSebastian\n\nHenry\n\nMuhammad\n\nHudson\n\nMaverick\n\nBenjamin\n\nTheo\n\nKai\n\nJackson\n\nMichael\n\nDaniel\n\nAiden\n\nGabriel\n\nJosiah\n\nMason\n\nJack\n\nElias\n\nGrayson\n\nAlexander\n\nLuke\n\nJulian\n\nJayden\n\nDavid\n\nLogan\n\nTheodore\n\nWyatt\n\nCarter\n\nSamuel\n\nOwen\n\nWilliam\n\nWaylon\n\nEzekiel\n\nMiles\n\nMatthew\n\nIsaiah\n\nJacob\n\nSantiago\n\nCaleb\n\nJohn\n\nJoseph\n\nThomas\n\nAdam\n\nAmir\n\nIsaac\n\nNolan\n\nNathan\n\nZion\n\nJeremiah\n\nLincoln\n\nAdrian\n\nAnthony\n\nCooper\n\nEli\n\nMicah\n\nCameron\n\nEnzo\n\nRyan\n\nRoman\n\nRowan\n\nXavier\n\nJaxon\n\nWesley\n\nWeston\n\nAndrew\n\nJoshua\n\nSilas\n\nColton\n\nCharlie\n\nParker\n\nChristopher\n\nGreyson\n\nLuka\n\nAtlas\n\nDominic\n\nChristian\n\nMyles\n\nBrooks\n\nKayden\n\nAustin\n\nAaron\n\nOmar\n\nAmari\n\nAxel\n\nBeau\n\nJasper\n\nLandon\n\nMax\n\nBabyCenter’s reports draw insights from more than 300,000 babies born in 2023 to parents who are registered on the BabyCenter website. As the foremost authority on baby name trends and news, BabyCenter has been releasing reports about baby names since 2004.\n\n\"BabyCenter's baby name reports are unique because we're able to analyze self-reported data from hundreds of thousands of our members in real time,\" says Christine Mattheis, Group VP, of Content and Brand Solutions at BabyCenter. \"This enables our team to spot trends much faster than baby name reports that rely on data from the Social Security Administration, which is only reported once annually for the prior year.\""
