We believe that pregnant couples can benefit tremendously from this preparation, including knowing what to expect during birth (and afterwards) and asking the right questions to guide their birth experience in a way that makes them feel rewarded and empowered. Our prenatal classes are run across two classes by our lead parent educator, Cecile de Scally who has over 35 years of experience as a Midwife in South Africa and the UAE. The classes cover a range of topics including preparing for birth, breathing techniques, postnatal care as well as feeding and sleep routines that suit your family. We recommend that couples attend the classes from 24 weeks of pregnancy thus enabling them to make the choices that suit their family in time for their birth. Classes are scheduled every Friday and Saturday at our Malaak Baby Center. Mama & Daddy are both advised to come! We also offer families Private Prenatal Classes at our Malaak Baby Center or in the comfort of their own home.\n\nPart I – All about birth: Getting you ready for birth includingtopics such as signs and stages of labour, recognizing early labour, when to go to hospital, normal/assisted births, induction, as well as medical pain management. We also look at Your Birth, Your Way discussing your birth plan, birth preferences, the role of birth partners, breathing and relaxation techniques, massage, acupuncture and labour tips that will support in a smooth and safe delivery.\n\nPart II – All about babies: Focuses on breastfeeding, positioning and latching, how to know if your baby is eating enough, maternal diets, expressing, bottle-feeding, sterilization, burping your baby, good sleep habits, understanding sleep, SIDS, sleep routines, sleep support techniques and resources, what to expect in the hospital, baby weight, cord care, practical baby care including changing and bathing your baby, vaccinations, circumcision, jaundice, car safety as well as guardianships and wills.
