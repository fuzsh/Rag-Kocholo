        "text": "This year Mother's Day falls on Sunday, May 12th, which means there's little time left to prepare. That's especially true if giving birth is on your Mother's Day to-do list. If you're lucky enough to expect a special delivery on this momentous occasion and still need help choosing a name, there are luckily plenty of baby names perfect for babies born on Mother's Day. Because whether you're becoming a Mom for the first time or the fifth, one thing remains the same: Mother's Day babies are extra special. What better way to celebrate the holiday?\n\nMother's Day is all about honoring mom and everything that represents moms, birth, and new beginnings, but let's not forget that Mother's Day actually falls during a season which brings new flowers, green grass and all things born from the earth — Mother Earth. If you're into astrology, Mother's Day occurs during Taurus season (and the month of May is also shared by another zodiac sign, Gemini, all of which makes for some really great Mother's Day-inspired baby names). Check out these unique and precious baby names that represent not just Mother's Day but the month of May and all things new, just like your brand new family."
