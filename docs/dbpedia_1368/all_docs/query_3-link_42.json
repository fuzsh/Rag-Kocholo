        "text": "Intro\n\nThe previous blog post was all about creating fake data and anonymizing existing data. In it I mentioned a fun alternative to charlatan for creating fake people names for the Finnish market. Let’s get to it!\n\nFirst, let’s see where the data can be found. Then we’ll put together a simple random Finnish name generator. Finally, we can utilize it to anonymize the names from the data set we used last time.\n\nAs you will see, this time around we’ll be only using the basic tools like base R and tidyverse (which readxl is a part of, even though it needs to be loaded separately). No special packages this time. It’s all about the imagination!\n\nI’m assuming you’re using RStudio as your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I’m sure most of this can be done with using something else as well.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nAlthough we used names (and Finnish names at that) for this exercise, I’m sure you can already see other possibilities for this short snippet of code.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I’m going to write a very basic post about using an API. I remember, not that long ago, how daunting they seemed at first, but I’ve since gotten more comfortable about using them and wish to share an example with anyone who’s doubting whether they should get to know them.\n\nIf you’ve read this far, thanks for your time and interest, I hope you had fun and/or learned something new! If you have any questions or comments, don’t hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn (since I still haven’t managed to add the Disqus module for comments, but I’ll either get it working or try something different)!"
