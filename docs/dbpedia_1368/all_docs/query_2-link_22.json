CHISAGO COUNTY. This county , located on the west bank of the St. Croix river, be tween the counties of Pine on the north , and Washington on the south ; the St. Croix river on the east and the counties of Isanti and Anoka on the west, presents an agreeable variety of surface, upland and gen erally undulating , covered with hard and soft-wood timber, well watered by lakes and streams. Its lake scenery is surpassed in beauty only by some of the lakes in Sweden . The county takes its name from the largest and most beautiful lake. In its aboriginal form it was Ki-chi-saga ; from two Chippewa word's meaning, â Kichi,â large, and â Saga,\\\" fair or lovely . For euphonic considerations the first syllable was dropped . Chisago Lake is conspicuous for its size , the clearness of its waters, its winding shore and islands, its bays, peninsulas, capes and promon tories. It has fifty miles of meandering shore line. Its shores and islands are well timbered with maple and other hard woods. It has no waste swamps, or marsh borders. In 1830 this beautiful lake was unknown to fame. No one had seen it, or could point out its location . Indians brought fish and maple sugar from a lake which they called Ki-chi-saga, or Sagi-a -gan, or \\\" large and lovely lake.â This lake, they said , abounded with â kego,â fish . Erik U . Norberg , born June 22, 1813, in UllkÃ¤rfva, VestergÃ¶tland, came to America in 1842 and settled a short distance west of Milwau kee, Wisconsin . From there he moved to the state of Michigan , where he lived until 1848, when he came to Bishop Hill, Illinois, became a member of the Eric Jansson colony, and, in the same year married Brita Johnson from Ãstrunda parish , Vestmanland. As he was a well edu cated man , having filled the office of sheriff (lÃ¤nsman ) in his native province, he became a very prominent and usefulmember of the colony. Two children survive him , namely : Gustaf Norberg, a leading attorney 367\n\nP:07\n\n368 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA of Holdrege, Nebraska, and Mrs. John A . Jones of Galva, Illinois. When Norberg came to the beautiful Chisago lake from Bishop Hill, in April, 1850, he certainly found it what its Indian name imparts, \\\" fair and lovely water.\\\" The government had, in 1850, completed a survey of the lake and it was high time that it should be given a name, by which it should be designated on the map and recognized by civilized visitors. What namemore beautiful and appropriate than that which the Indians had already given it ? Being well pleased with the locality, Norberg came back with a colony of Swedes, including Peter Berg , Andrew Swenson, Peter Anderson, Peter SjÃ¶lin , Daniel RÃ¤ttig , and Jonas Wes terlund. They came by steamboat, landed at Taylor's Falls June 24 , 1851, cut a road to Chisago lake and took undisputed possession of its shores, finding no trace of human occupancy save some deserted Indian tepees and the claim cabin of a Mr. Van Renselaer on the island. Peter Berg settled on the east part of lot 3, section 35 and southwest quarter of southwest quarter of section 26 , township 34 , range 20 . Peter An derson on the east part of lot 3 , and northwest quarter of northeast quarter of section 35, township 34, range 20 . Andrew Swenson on lot 5 , section 27, township 34, range 20. Erik Norberg had come to the country at the invitation of Nils Tornell, who was murdered in 1848, near St. Croix Falls, by some Indian assassins hired to commit the deed by one Miller, a whiskey -seller. Norberg intended to make his home at Chisago Lake, where the former island, on which Center City is now situated, for many years was called âNorbergsholmen â by the Swedes, but died at Bishop Hill, while on a visit, in 1853. For a long time the lake was called Swede Lake, until its present . . dooted name was permanently adopted . Oscar Roos could claim the honor of having been , probably , the first Swedish settler not only in Chisago county , but in Minnesota. He was born in VestergÃ¶tland in 1827 and came to America in 1850, locating during the first summer at Rock Island, Illinois, but in the fall coming to Taylor's Falls. In his company came, among others, Lars J. Stark , who later also settled in this county. On the advice of Rev. Unonius, in Chicago, Roos, together with two other young men, FernstrÃ¶m and Sandahl, went to Minnesota . They arrived in Marine, Washington county, in October, 1850. During 1851- 1852 Roos, with other new comers, worked on the road which the United States government was then building from Mississippi to Lake Superior and which for quite\n\nP:08\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 369 a distance is running along the St. Croix river . This road was named the â Point Douglas and St. Louis River military road.â Roos made his headquarters at Marine, working at timbering and logging until 1860, when he settled at Taylor's Falls, and was appointed postmaster at that place. In the same year he was elected register of deeds in Chi sago county, which office he held for eight years. Those positions he kept until 1870, when he was appointed register of the United States Land Office at Taylor 's Falls. He resigned that office in 1875 and was elected treasurer of Chisago county, an office he held for a number of years. The confidences thus bestowed upon him , by his fellow citizens, go to show , that he was not only well liked but also highly trusted . He later engaged in exchange, loaning money, selling land, etc., and had a branch office in Center City . He was married to Hanna SwanstrÃ¶m in 1870 . The colony in 1852 raised the first rye, barley and flax in the county. It also raised potatoes, green corn and vegetables, cut out roads, cleared timber, and made other improvements. Peter Berg raised flax and made linen thread in 1852 and soon after came the Petersons, Strands, Johnsons, Frank Mobeck, Dahlin , Porter and others. A post office was established in 1858 ; A . Nelson , postmaster. The town was organized in the same year. The first supervisors were Ephraim C . In galls, chairman ; Frank Mobeck and Daniel LindstrÃ¶m . The first church organization in the county was that of the Swed ish Evangelical-Lutheran, in 1854. Here, in Center City, was built the first church edifice in 1855 ; a frame structure, subsequently enlarged, but later superseded by a brick building . This was set afire by light ning in 1882, and a new , fine church , costing $ 30 ,000, was erected. Its dimensions are 116 by 66 feet, ground plan , and the spire is 135 feet in height. This church is an ornament to the town and the state, and would be creditable even to our great cities. The first pastor was Rev. P . A . Cederstam . His first successors were Revs. C . A . Hedengran and John Frodeen . CENTER City, the county seat of Chisago county , was platted in May , 1857, on lot 5, section 27 , township 34, range 20 , the proprietor being Anders Swensson. Few villages are more beautifully situated . It contains two hotels ; a number of stores ; the largest bank in Chisago county, with average deposits of $ 300 ,000 ; the Chisago Lake Swedish\n\nP:09\n\n370 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA Lutheran Church, which congregation is the oldest and as to member ship the largest Swedish church in Minnesota ; schoolhouse and a num ber of fine residences. During the Indian outbreak in 1862, and the uncertainty as to the probable attitude of the Chippewa Indians, the people of Chisago Lake built breastworks for protection, on the isthmus connecting Center City with the mainland, and planted cannon upon them for defense. Anders Swensson , the founder of Center City , came from SmÃ¥land to the shores of the lake in 1851, and made his home on the present site of the city . He was born in 1817, came to America in 1850, and remained a short time in New Orleans before coming to Minnesota. He was a farmer and married to Katarina Peterson in 1838. He died in July , 1887, leaving two sons and two daughters who are all living at the present writing and mentioned in the biographical sketch of John Swanson . Nils Nord was born in LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden , in 1819 . In his eight eenth year he enlisted in the Swedish army and served twelve years . He came to America in 1855 and located on Chisago Lake in the north east quarter of section 32, township 34, range 20 . He was married in Sweden to Lisa Anderson. They had one son , John P . Nord, who for a number of years was the popular and efficient auditor of Chisago county . He was married in 1878 to Hilda, daughter of Rev. C . A . Hedengran. They had one daughter. Mrs. Nord having died , Mr. Nord now lives a retired life at the Park Hotel, Center City. Lars Johan Stark was born in Sweden in 1826 , came to America in 1850 , and settled at Chisago Lake in 1852. He was married in 1865 and again in 1870 . He had eleven children. In Sweden he had served as clerk ten years. In his American home he followed farming chiefly. He served as justice of the peace and county commissioner and also filled some town offices. He was engrossing clerk of the house of repre sentatives in 1864. He was a member of the house in the sessions of 1865 and in 1875. In 1868 he moved to the town of Fish Lake, and in 1877 to Harris, where he died . One of his sons is probate judge Stark , who resides at Harris. Andrew N . Holm , formerly Andrew Nelson, his name having been changed by legislative enactment in 1867, was born in Sweden in 1829. Helearned the trade of a carpenter, cameto America in 1855 and located at Center City in 1857, of which village he was the first postmaster. He\n\nP:10\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 371 served as a soldier during the Civil war and at its close removed his family to Taylor's Falls, where death ended his days. Peter Anderson brought the first cattle, a yoke of oxen and a cow , to the settlement. One of the oxen was slaughtered in the fall and the other sold to Peter Berg, who made a special kind of wagon, or, rather, cart, for this team . It did not take the help or skill of any blacksmith to manufacture this vehicle, which was a good thing, as there was no such artisan or iron material to be found in the settlement. The wheels consisted of one single solid block, sawed off a large oak log . In the center a hole was made for the axle, which also was of wood. On ac count of the uneven condition of the â roads,â the \\\"hubsâ soon were worn so they lost their circular shape, which gave to the vehicle a very shaky and uneven movement not altogether pleasant for travel. But, better that than carry the loads on their own backs, thought the pio neers. Such carts soon became very common in the settlement and for a long time the only means of transportation . In them were transported not only smaller loads on the farm but also the necessaries of life from Taylor's Falls. The standing price for the use of this rig for a short or longer distance , was five dollars. An American , living at Taylor's Falls, charged twelve dollars for carrying a load from that place to Chisago Lake. Sven Anderson came to Marine Mills in the fall of 1852, bringing with him four cows, which he sold to the settlers. Anders Swenson bought two of those, and Per Wiklund one. The first really good yoke of oxen in the settlement belonged to Daniel RÃ¤ttig and Peter Shaleen, and they rented them to the farmers for plowing at five dollars a day. Of the above mentioned pioneers most have since died , but left the settlement before and moved to other places. Peter Anderson moved to Cambridge, Isanti county ; Peter Berg to Fish Lake, Wiklund to Anoka and Bylund to Kandiyohi county. Late in the fall of 1851 arrived at Chisago Lake, in extremely poor circumstances, a former sergeant in the Swedish army, by the name of A . M . Dahlhjelm from ÃstergÃ¶tland, at the time of his coming an old man . He was permitted to stop over winter in a shanty situated on an island in the lake and owned by another old man, a recluse named Van Renselaer, who lived there in a kind of half-starving misery. Dahl hjelm 's wife , Ulrika Pfeiff, belonged to the Swedish nobility . A son of Dahlhjelm , Claes Dahlhjelm , born in Vallerstad, ÃstergÃ¶tland, July\n\nP:11\n\n372 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 7 , 1828, is still living at Center City . He wasmarried to Miss Eva Carl son Ek, of HerrÃ¥kra , SmÃ¥land, by whom he has had twelve children , of whom nine are living. One daughter is married to Mr. James E . Melin , president of the Chisago County State Bank, at Center City. Gustaf Hultquist is another of the old settlers still living ; hale and hearty , at the age of seventy-seven years. He was born July 26 , 1832 ; came to America in 1853, stopped at Chicago, where he remained until 1855, when he came to Chisago Lake. He had experienced a terrible voyage on the ocean . Of 219 passengers 64 died from cholera. Mr. Hultquist has been married and has had fourteen children , nine of whom are living. During the war he was drawn for service, but took sick and was laid up in the army hospital at Fort Snelling. He is now leading a retired life at Center City. In his younger days he held a number of county , town , village and school offices. He is a remarkably bright and intelligent man , with a never failing memory and brimful of information concerning the first Swedish settlement in Minnesota . Be sides Mr. Hultquist is a well read man and has a library ofmany times the ordinary size generally found in a farmer's home. During the year 1852 only a few settlers arrived . John Smith came from Ãrtofta in the spring of that year. Ahead of him , he declared , were only five settlers at Chisago Lake. He took land near the lake, just west of where the church now stands. Smith had read an article written by Norberg in a Swedish -American paper (Hemlandet) in which the soil and conditions of Minnesota were praised to the sky and that article induced him to emigrate. In his company came also John Ander son from ÃstergÃ¶tland. Peter Svenson from Algutsboda, Kronoberg's LÃ¤n, arrived in Knox ville, Illinois, in 1852. Also he had read the article by Norberg and by the same was induced to emigrate. Accompanied by six other Swedes, he came to St. Paul. Thence he went to Carver and St. Peter, but finding that part of the country wild and entirely unsettled, he returned to St. Paul, whence he went to Chisago Lake, settling to the east of that water. Erik U . Norberg , who is mentioned quite often in this volume, seems, in a large degree, to have been instrumental in directing the stream of Swedish immigrants to Minnesota. In his letters and news paper correspondence he called the attention of his countrymen to the fertile soil which was here awaiting willing hands to cultivate it, and\n\nP:12\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 373 reap the reward for their labors which in such an abundant measure was to come to them . It is stated that he received fifty dollars from the people of Taylor's Falls for his efforts to bring Swedish settlers to Chi sago county, and he certainly made good his promise . Another man should also be kept in kind remembrance by the Swedes of Minnesota , namely â Rev. Gustaf Unonius, who built the St. Ansgarius (or Jenny Lind) church in Chicago, Illinois. He was the first Swedish minister who visited the Chisago Lake settlement and preached and officiated among the few settlers in 1852. During this visit he tied the nuptial knot between a daughter of Daniel Nilson in Marine and Fredrik Lam mer, a German, living a couple of miles from Taylor's Falls. Mrs. Lammer was probably the first Swedish girl to be married in Minnesota . In his little excellent historical pamphlet, \\\" Svenskarna i St. Croix dalen ,â Mr. R . GrÃ¶nberger relates the following incident: The wife of Anders Swenson made this year ( 1852) a very unpleasant trip . One fine morning she went out in the woods to look for her cows. In the tall grass and brush she could trace the direction in which they had passed. She followed their path through the wilderness without knowing in what direction she was going. A woman in our days with less deter mination and a less stout heart would probably have given up such a task as looking for cows in the wild woods where wild animals and prowl ing Indians were the only living beings to be encountered . Not so Mrs. Swenson. She would under no circumstances lose her good milch ers, so she continued all day without finding them . Toward evening , in the vicinity of where Vasa, in the Marine settlement, was later located , she met a man who said that he had met a pair of cows, but that was so long before, that there was no possibility for her to overtake them . The man being afraid lest she was going to get lost if she continued her search in the dark , offered to build a fire at which they could â camp\\\" during the night. Thanking him for the offer she, however , declined it, and, having received a few matches to be used in case she would need to build a fire and camp out alone, she went. Before it was entirely dark , she was lucky enough to reach the house of a farmer in the neighborhood of Marine. This farmer had caught and locked in the so eagerly sought for cows. The distance from this farmer 's to her home was fifteen miles, as the bird flies, and as the cows' path probably did not lay in such a direct course, Mrs. Swenson had walked a much longer distance. The following day she returned over the same route\n\nP:13\n\n374 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA but this time driving the cows before her . We must admire Mrs . Swen son 's energy and endurance all the more when we are informed that shebore a fine girl baby two months later. This child was born November 22, 1852 ; baptized by A . M . Dahlhjelm , receiving the name of Christine Mathilda. She is married to Mr. John P. Johnson and they now live at Lindstrom . She and Christina, a daughter of Peter Anderson , were born on the same day and were the first children born of Swedish parents in this settlement and, for that matter, probably, in all Minnesota . The first really serviceable boat made of boards in Chisago Lake was owned by Anders Swenson . By doing housework in the hotel of Ansel & Smith at Taylor's Falls, Mrs. Swenson had earned the money with which to buy the boards. Other boats in the lake owned by Swedes were mostly hollowed logs. To indicate how high the prices of cattle were at that time may be mentioned that John Smith had to pay sixty dollars for a cow , which he bought in St. Paul. Frans Mobeck , a former corporal in the SmÃ¥land Grenadier regi ment, came to Chicago in 1852. On the advice of Rev. Unonius he went to Minnesota in 1853, arriving in St. Paul, where he remained two years. He visited the Swedish settlement at Chisago Lake and bought the piece of land on which he afterwards lived. He did not oc cupy it, however, before 1855. During the years 1853- 1854 quite a number of Swedish immigrants arrived, most of them from Kronoberg's LÃ¤n . Among them were Peter Wiberg , Magnus Jonson , Carl Lind, Anders Porter, Daniel Peterson , Peter Gustaf Gustafson, Gustaf CollÃ©n, A . P. Glader, John Holmgren, HÃ¥kan Larson and others. Although the largest number of settlers came from Kronoberg's LÃ¤n , the very first ones came from ÃstergÃ¶t land and Norrland. During the first three or four years in the history of the settlement most of the land around the lake was taken up and settled . Later arriving immigrants had to go farther into the country in order to secure homesteads. The two brothers, Otto and Anders Wallmark , came from Halmstad in 1854, bought land and settled near Chisago City . The land was owned by Bernheimer & Arnold of Philadelphia , who platted the village site and started in to erect buildings. A store was opened in which Otto Wallmark became clerk. Saw - and four-mills were built, which, however, burned down in 1860. Anders Wallmark was foreman for the workingmen who graded and cleared the land for the village site. Otto Wallmark was\n\nP:14\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 375 auditor for Chisago county during a number of years. Anders Wallmark was register of deeds since 1868. To this office he was elected six times. Major John Swainson in St. Paulbought in 1856 in Missouri a large herd of cattle which he pastured at Rice Lake during the summer. These he sold on the easy payment plan to his new - coming countrymen. This was a great help for them , as they had no money to pay cash but badly needed milch cows and oxen . In his â History of the Swedish -Lutheran Churches in America â Dr. E . Norelius, who came to Chisago Lake in 1854 and remained there from May 24th to September 11th, says that in Taylor Falls were at that time very few horses, and that no Swedish family lived there, but a short distance from the city , in the direction of the lake, lived a wagon -maker, Anders Anderson , his son -in -law , Daniel Fredin , Peter Wiklund , who had moved there from the lake, his brother and a man by the name of Bylund . Besides these there were Fred Lammers, whose wife was a daughter of Daniel Nilson in Marine. The road to the lake did not run exactly as it does now , but in numerous curves, and was bad to the utmost degree. To drive a load over it was a hard job, indeed , but there was not very much traffic at that time. The things one bought in the city were carried on the back or in the hands. After leaving Anders Anderson 's place there were no houses to be seen until at the lake. The first house was Per Anderson's, which stood south of the road, and diagonally in the direction of the bay that of P . Sheleen 's. A little to the west lived Peter Berg, where the rectory of the Chisago Lake church was located until last year, when the new rectory was completed . Here also was the first house at Chisago Lake located , a log cabin , which stood there for many years and had been used as meeting house , or church , and school house. On the peninsula on which Center City and the church are now situated, lived Frans Mobeck and Anders Swenson . From P. Berg 's place, looking north , was a path to the little lake, and following it one came to Hans Smitt's place, and near by lived P . Norelius. Looking west from here and north of the little lake, lived Daniel Peterson , who later moved to New London . South of the little lake lived P . Kron and B. Franklin , who later sold his farm to Peter Swenson . West of the little lake lived Peter Lund , who later moved to Grove City . On the north side were HÃ¥kan Svedberg's , A . P . Norelius' and other places located. North of the big lake were Magnus Olsson's, A . M . AhlstrÃ¶m 's and others'\n\nP:15\n\n376 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA places. On the east side of the bay and next to Per Anderson's, lived Peter Johanson, and on the south of his place Anders Molin and Peter Svenson . On the southeast and south side were Magnus Jonasson 's, Glader's,Garberg's, and on the peninsula between the two branches of the lake, Nord, Nojd, Daniel LindstrÃ¶m and others. Many immigrants arrived during the summer and settled all around in the woods. Around the small log cabins were to be found patches on which vegetables were planted. The woods were hewn down by and by, and between the stumps the ground was turned by hoes and planted with any seed the settlers happened to have handy. Here we enter a list of the first settlers at Chisago Lake up to 1855, according to the church register kept by Rev. Cederstam , As almost all of the settlers were members of the Lutheran Church there have probably not been many settlers whose names are not in the list. Among those few Dr. Norelius remembers Hans Smitt and family, Jonas Norell and Per Norell. Arrivals in 1850 : Per Anderson with family , Daniel RÃ¤ttig with wife, and L . P.

In 1855 the immigration amounted to almost nothing , because the cholera of the preceding year had scared people from leaving their homes in the old country. From 1856 to 1860 not a few came, but it would take too much space to give their names. LINDSTROM VILLAGE.â Located on the line of the Taylor's Falls branch of the St. Paul & Duluth Railroad (now in the Northern Pacific System ), on lot 5 , section 33 , town 34 , range 20, was platted in 1880. The proprietors were then James and Elizabeth Smith , who had bought the land of Daniel LindstrÃ¶m . LindstrÃ¶m was born in 1825 in Helsing land , Sweden. He had no early advantages for obtaining an education and spentmost of his youth herding goats and cattle among the mountains in his native province . In 1854 he came to America and located on Chisago Lake, choosing a beautiful location which since was laid out as a village and has become a place of popular resort. LindstrÃ¶m wasmar ried first in Sweden , and then here, his first wife having died in 1864.\n\nP:19\n\n380 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA He had a family of three children of whom a son, O . F . LindstrÃ¶m , is cashier of the local state bank. The village of Lindstrom was incorporated in 1894, with a resident population of 245 inhabitants, on petition of the following : John A . Nel son , B . L . Brorson , P . M . Dedon , S . M . D . Hallberg, O . F . Lindstrom , C . J . Anderson ,Gust Peterson , P. H . Tyrrell, G . Fernlund, Evart E . Hall, F . W . Hall, Gust Lantz , D . LindstrÃ¶m , John Turnquist, J. H . Frye, P . M . Holt, Carl Otis, John Kroonblawd, Chas. Andrews, J. Ostergren , A . Erlandson , John Peterson , M . Norman , J . C . Larson, George J. Symonds, Chas. Kronblad, J. A . Holt, August L . Anderson , Gus. W . Anderson, C . M . Hall, H . C . Manders, C . A . Bergren, J. Pitts, F . A . Johnson, J. A . Peterson, and Martin Peterson . The first village president was Mr. A . Erlandson, and the first vil lage clerk or recorder, Ludwig Andrews, who is now postmaster of the place . Of the three villages on the Chisago Lake, Center City, Lind strom and Chisago City , Lindstrom is very much the largest and as a business place the most important. It has schools, two churches, post office, bank , a good hotel, two restaurants, a large creamery run on the co-operative plan by the farmers, several general merchandise stores, drug store, two physicians and one dentist, printing office and a weekly paper, a fine city well, 240 feet deep, furnishing the best drinking water imaginable, hardware, agricultural implements, harness and shoe stores, meat market, bakery, saw -mill, lumber yards, wagon shop, blacksmith shop, flour mill, elevator, millinery , clothing and tailoring store, three saloons, livery stable, jewelry store and two photograph studios. Lindstrom has a number of fine and comfort able residences and small cottages for the accommodation of summer guests, who come here in large numbers to spend their vacation . For them it also has a boat house with gasoline launches and rowboats. CHISAGO CITY. â The village of Chisago City is located on a hard wood ridge between Chisago and Green lakes, in sections 6 and 7, town ship 34 , range 20 . It was platted , in 1855, by Isaac Bernheimer & Com pany, of Philadelphia. They built a hotel, several dwellings, and a saw and grist mill on the banks of Chisago lake. These mills were burnt in 1872 . A stave factory was built on the site of the burned mills, which was operated successfully for many years by George Nathan, Otto Wallmark , W . D . Webb, and others. This stave mill gave a new im petus to the prosperity of the village, under the influence of which the\n\nP:20\n\nSWEDISH - AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 381 county seat was transferred to it from Taylor's Falls. Its subsequent growth , however, did not justify expectations. It was for many years without even a postoffice. In 1875 the county seat was removed to Cen ter City. The Swedish -Lutherans had here one of the finest church buildings in the county . This church burned down, but a new frame edifice was erected in its place and dedicated in the spring of 1909. The lake location with splendid train service of the Northern Pacific Railway Company gives to the village the patronage of a large summer resort and tourist business, well taken care of by it's three hotels, as well as its colony of summer houses of Twin City people, who are yearly adding to their holdings in and around Chisago City. The business enterprises have grown fast in the last few years. The pioneer business places are three hotels, two large and well managed general stores, blacksmith and implements, creamery, sprayer manu facturing, lumber yard, livery, meat market, tailor, millinery, dressmaker, physician , harness and shoe store, four elevators, watch maker, with additions of stock buyer, feed mill, barber shop, drug store, state bank , excellent schools. Residences are being built summer and winter and brick blocks are in evidence in which are conducted the business inter ests of the community. The farming and dairy interests surrounding are ably conducted by a class of well to do and thrifty farmers, whose principal products, live stock and dairying, potatoes, feed crops and hay, and whose prosperity is noticeable to all. The future possibilities for growth and advancement are very good for this village. Along the branch of the Northern Pacific Railroad are two other villages, Shafer and Franconia. SHAFER. â Comprises all of the territory of township 34 , range 19 excepting the plat of Taylor's Falls, and fractional sections in the N . E . corner of the township . It is now all settled and has many fine farms. A Swedish colony settled here in 1853, consisting of Peter Wicklund, Anders Anderson, Erik Bylund, Tuve Waldemarson and others. The town organized first as Taylor's Falls, but the name was changed to Shafer in 1873, after Jacob Shafer, who as early as 1847 cut hay in sections 4 and 5. He seems to have been in no sense worthy of the honor conferred upon him , as he was but a transient inhabitant, and disappeared in 1849. No one knows his subsequent career. The honor ought to have been given some of the hardy Swedes, who were the first real pioneers, and the first to make substantial improvements.\n\nP:21\n\n382 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA Peter Wicklund came from Sweden in 1853 and settled in the north east quarter of section 26 . He moved to Anoka in 1860, and was drowned in the Rum river in 1880 . His son Peter became a prominent merchant in Anoka . Tuve Waldemarson was born in Sweden in 1812. He was a member of the Swedish colony of 1853. Mr. and Mrs. Waldemarson reared a fine family of children . By hard work, close attention to business and frugality the family prospered abundantly . Anders Anderson came also in 1853 and settled in the east half of the northeast quarter of section 34. He moved to Taylor's Falls in 1859 and died there in 1873 . He left but one child , the wife of Daniel Fredin of Shafer. Anderson was a born humorist and fond of practical jokes. On one occasion his ready wit was exercised at the expense of a man to whom he had mortgaged his farm . Deeming the house in which he lived his own , in the absence of the mortgagee, he removed it to Taylor's Falls. The mortgagee, E . W . Holman , told him , he had stolen the house and must replace it. Anderson told Holman to take the house and replace it himself, but if he took his (Anderson's ) family along with it, he would have him sent to the penitentiary. Holman did not see his way clear and the house was not disturbed . Erik Bylund settled in the west half of the southeast quarter of section 23. In 1860 he sold out and moved further west. The farm he left has since been owned by John Nelson and is one of the finest farms in Chisago county. Jakob Peterson was born in 1847 and came with his parents to Chisago county in 1854. They located on a beautiful spot in Franconia, on the shore of a small lake, where they made a farm and where Jakob passed his boyhood and youth . In 1881 he commenced business at Shafer station as a merchant and dealer in wood. He was the first postmaster at Shafer and was married to Mary Helin . FRANCONIA . â Jonas Lindahl was for many years an enterprising and prosperous business man in Franconia . He opened up an extensive wood trade with St. Paul, in which C . J . Vitalis was his successor. Lin dahl represented his county in the senate of the fifteenth and sixteenth legislatures. He was accidentally drowned from a barge of wood at Hastings in May, 1872. His widow married Chas. J. Vitalis. Charles J. Vitalis was born in SmÃ¥land in 1843, came to America in 1868 and settled in Franconia village. He was for five years em\n\nP:22\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 383 ployed as clerk. In 1873 he embarked in the mercantile and wood business. In one year he shipped 13,000 cords of wood and averaged for the following fourteen years 7 ,000 cords, making a total of 100 ,000 cords. He was married to Josephine Nelson , widow of Jonas Lindahl, in 1873. He had four brothers, Elof, John , Elias and Hans, who all resided in Franconia . Frank N . Peterson, came to America in 1865, and in 1866 settled in the valley of the St. Croix . He attended school at Carver , Minne sota , one year , when he became a traveling salesman for Leopold & Company of Chicago, and in 1881 settled in Franconia. He organized the lumbering firm of Borens Brothers and Peterson, which continued until 1886 , when a new organization was formed , called the Franconia Lumber Company. Peterson has been the president of Franconia since its incorporation. In 1869 he married Miss Ingrid Johnson, daughter of Erik Johnson, a pioneer of St. Peter, Minn . Mr. Peterson owned one of the finest houses in the valley, romantically situated and supplied with pure spring water. It was a pride to the village and attracted gen eral attention . He was also the inventor and patentee of the Lindholm & Peterson adding machine. Olof S. WERNER, M . D . - Among the able and highly educated Swed ish - Americans of Chisago county, none stands higher, than Dr. Olof S . Werner of Lindstrom , who has attained prominence both in the clerical and medical professions. Born near Helsingborg, Sweden , November 11, 1866 , he received his early education in the public school and at the age of fourteen entered the collegiate high school of his native city, from which he graduated in 1888. He then matriculated at the Uni versity of Lund, where he at first pursued studies in philosophy for two years , and in 1890 came to Minnesota, where his mother was living. In the fall he entered Augustana Theological Seminary, graduating therefrom in 1892, and receiving the degree of Bachelor of Divinity , an unusual honor. Dr. Werner was then ordained as minister of the gospel at Lindsborg , Kansas, his first charge being a congregation at Warren , Minnesota. Later he came to Tustin, Michigan , where he remained for two years. During the last year of that pastorate he took up the study of medicine at the Michigan College of Medicine and Sur gery , Detroit, finishing his studies at Milwaukee Medical College, now the medical department of Marquette University, in 1897. He then\n\nP:23\n\n384 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA located at Ludington, Michigan , where he maintained a general practice for one year, followed by two years at Manistee, that state. In 1899 he took a post-graduate course at the Chicago Post -Graduate College, and moved to Center City, Minnesota, during that year. ' In 1901 he located at Lindstrom , where he has since conducted a growing practice among the best people in the place. He has also been honored with several local offices, both village and county . In 1892 Dr. Werner married Miss Ellen RundstrÃ¶m , of Lindsborg , Kansas, and they have five children, as follows: Victor J., born August 28, 1893 ; Conrad O ., born December 14, 1895 ; Lillie E ., born August 1, 1897 ; Ebba Maria, born August 13, 1899 ; and Robert Fredrik, born April 4 , 1901. In the fall of 1909 Victor J. entered Gustavus Adolphus College at St. Peter, Minnesota . Conrad O . has decided mechanical gifts. The family are members of the Swedish Lutheran church . All have musical talents and have a family orchestra of five instruments . Mrs. Werner is a music teacher and organist of the English Lutheran church . Dr. Werner is a member of the Chisago County Medical So ciety, Minnesota State Medical Society , the American Medical Asso ciation , the American Electro- Therapeutic Association . JOHN J . F . SWANSON , of Lindstrom , Chisago county , is one of the pioneers of this part of Minnesota , his father being among the first of his countrymen to settle near Center City . For a period of fifty - eight years the son has been a growing business man and a progressive citizen of the county and for the greater portion of that time has been operating a saw or planing mill. He was born in Vena parish , ÃstergÃ¶tland, Sweden , May 28 , 1848, to Anders Fredrik and Katarina (Peterson ) Swenson. In 1850, with his parents, he came to America in a ship which was six months in making the voyage from Gothenborg to New Orleans. From the latter city the family took passage on a river steamer to St. Louis. They remained there through the winter, the father sup porting his family chiefly by loading and unloading steamboats. The cholera was then raging in the city and Mr. Swenson lost one son and a new -born daughter by the dread disease. Jenny Lind was then in St. Louis and in the tenderness of her heart and generosity to her country men , she gave the bereaved father fifty dollars with which to bury his son and daughter and pay passage to Stillwater, at which place the remaining members of the family were transferred to a smaller steamer, which brought them to Taylor's Falls. Thence they went afoot to\n\nP:24\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 385 Center City, where they settled about one-half mile north of where the court house now stands, and put up a log cabin . Anders F . and Katarina Swenson had seven children , of whom four are living ; Mrs. Johanna Nelson, widow of Peter Nelson , who died in 1890 ; John J . F . Swanson , of this sketch ; Christina Mathilda, married to Peter J. Johnson , of Lindstrom , and Henry Edwin Swanson , who lives near Center City . When one sees the fine farms and flourishing little villages , which now are considered beautiful summer resorts at Chisago Lake, it is hard to imagine what hardships and privations the early settlers had to suffer, surrounded by not altogether friendly Indians and in the winter by howling wolves. Mrs. Johanna Nelson relates how once she saw a flock of forty wolves coming over the ice, steering their course directly toward their log cabin . There being no schools at first, the children were taught by their parents to read Swedish . In three or four years, however , the Swedish settlers so increased that a little district school house was built. John F . worked on farms until nineteen years of age, when ( in 1868 ) he made a trip to California and Washington , via New York and Panama. Hemade quite a little money on the coast, but after two years returned to Center City , where he bought a general merchandise store, located in the old school and meeting house, in partnership with John Elof Peterson , now postmaster in Center City. They paid seven teen hundred and fifty dollars cash for the store and continued in busi ness for a short time; when they separated , Mr. Swanson going to North Branch , where he bought a lot and built a store, and Mr. Peter son taking the Center City store. Mr. Swanson operated the North Branch store from 1870 to 1884, when he sold out and went to Trade Lake, Wisconsin , where he bought a combined hotel and store in part nership with P . V . Delamater. They continued in this enterprise a couple of years and then sold their business at auction, Mr. Swanson returning to Center City, where he remained for a time, inactive but alert for opportunities. In partnership with his father, he next built a saw mill at Almelund, Minnesota, which he continued to run for nine teen years and then moved the machinery to Lindstrom , where he built a large saw mill. The first year he employed twenty-two men , but now , when mostly planing is done, it is operated by Mr. Swanson and his sons. 25\n\nP:25\n\n386 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA Mr. Swanson has been married three times. In 1871, he wedded Miss Emma Swenson , who died in 1877, bearing two children, of whom Miranda is married to Victor Anderson , of Minneapolis, and one son died in infancy. In 1879, he married Miss Martha C . Larson . They had two daughters and one son, the latter dying when three years of age. The daughters are Sally F ., born August 11, 1882, living at home, and Martha, born January 2 , 1884, who is living with her maternal grandmother. Their mother died in 1884. In 1887 Mr. Swanson mar ried a third time to a sister of his second wife , Miss Elizabeth J. Larson . They have had five sons and one daughter; Arnie B . C ., born in 1890 ; Dellner E . F ., born in 1894 ; George H . J., born in 1896 ; James K . L ., born in 1898 ; Pearl Eva Josephine, born in 1903, and Merle N . O ., born in 1905. John Artig . â The long, industrious and honorable career of John Artig , of Lindstrom , has been laid in Chisago county since he was eighteen years of age, and has covered, farming, lumbering and mason ry. In his old age he is the fortunate proprietor of a nice home and , although he is able to review some business misadventures , there is no smirch of trickery or dishonor on his name. Mr. Artig was born in Furuby parish , near VexjÃ¶ , SmÃ¥land, Sweden, on March 14 , 1836 . His parents were Anders and Petronella (Petersdotter ) Artig , the former born in Herrakna and the latter in DÃ¤desjÃ¶ . Anders Artig served as a soldier in the Swedish army for thirty -eight and one-half years, par ticipating in the war with Russia when Sweden lost Finland; in the battle of Leipsic against Napoleon, and in the war with Norway in 1814. He died when eighty -seven years old and the mother at the age of ninety - eight, both in Sweden . To them were born ten daugh ters and one son, the subject of this sketch. John received a common school education and was confirmed in the Lutheran church , always standing high both in his literary studies and his religious training. On September 16 , 1854, Mr. Artig emigrated to America , coming in the Cambria, which sailed from the port of Carlshamn on June 22nd, and spent nearly three months in crossing the Atlantic. The Cambria carried more than five hundred emigrants, mostly from SmÃ¥land. They landed at New York , sailed across the lakes to Chicago and thence went to Rock Island, where they boarded a Mississippi steamer, bound for Stillwater. At Stillwater they boarded a smaller steamer , the Pioneer, which brought them to Taylor's Falls. They landed on October 6th .\n\nP:26\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 387 From Taylor 's Falls they traveled on foot to Chisago Lake, where they were received by a Mr. Glader. At first John Artig went across the St. Croix river to Wisconsin , where he worked on a farm for six months, receiving his board therefor but no wages. His next job was on the government road as cook at one dollar per day and board. This employment lasted more than five months, and young Artig saved every cent of his earnings and sent to his old father , one thousand kroner ( $ 265) , thus enabling him to pay off a mortgage on his little place in Sweden . This filial act also saved his mother from going to the poorhouse , as she was able to retain the family homestead after her husband's death. During the following win ters, young Artig went lumbering, and in the summers built dams, having learned the mason's trade in Gotland, Sweden. Later he ven tured into the logging business , but was unfortunate in his specula tion and had to sell eight hundred thousand feet at two dollars and fifty cents per thousand . But as the venture was his alone, the loss was his only . A second log speculation had unfortunate results, and he also lost nineteen hundred dollars on cord -wood. So that he finally con cluded that speculation was not his strong point, and dropped it. In 1858 Mr. Artig married Mathilda Stenberg, of Algutsboda, Sweden, and settled on a farm , which he bought for $ 1, 100 near Tay lor's Falls. He cultivated his farm during the summer, going to the woods in the winter and driving logs in the spring . Thus he passed a busy existence and prospered by hard work. With his wife he has had five children : Mary, who is married to Ludvig Andrews, postmaster at Lindstrom ; Nella (Petronella ) , married to W . F . Hall, a railroad man in St. Paul; Charlotta, married to Edward Andrews, a farmer and mail carrier ; Minnie , who is clerking in the post office at Lindstrom , and Frank Victor, who is cashier in a bank at Sauk Rapids. In 1864 Mr. Artig enlisted in Company G , Eleventh Minnesota Volunteers, and served for one year, participating in several skirmishes but was not wounded . He was honorably discharged at the end of the war July 11, 1865, and is a member of Sherman Camp No. 6 , G . A . R . In his reli gious faith he is a member of the English Lutheran church , and is a man of solid moral traits and sturdy character. CHARLES LINDAHL. â For nearly forty-five years that sturdy Swe dish -American farmer , Charles Lindahl, has been the proprietor of a beautiful place located on a cape which juts out into Lake Superior\n\nP:27\n\n388 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA and is embraced by Chisago county. Hehas lived and labored upon this dear homestead since 1854 . Mr. Lindahl was born in Furuby parish , Kronoberg 's lÃ¤n, Sweden, October 7, 1831. His parents, Johan and Kristina (Nilson ) HÃ¥kanson , rented a small place (in Sweden called torp) belonging to a larger farm Vestra TruedsgÃ¥rd . They had three chil dren : Charles, of this sketch , who took the surname of Lindahl to dis tinguish himself from the many Johnsons ; Frank Johnson , who lives in Duluth ; Salomon , who is deceased . Educational facilities were very unsatisfactory then in Sweden , whose public school system was inaugurated in 1848 and since has been greatly improved. If a youngster knew his catechism by heart and could read his New Testament, it was considered that he possessed a sufficient lit erary education . Such an education did Charles receive, and was duly confirmed in Furuby church by Minister Krook. After confirmation he worked on the farm until 1854, when he came to America in company with his parents and brother Frank. They sailed in the good vessel Cambria , landing in New York September 15th . From New York they journeyed (via Albany, Buffalo , and the great lakes ) to Chicago, thence to Rock Island and up the Mississippi and the St. Croix rivers to Still water, where they changed to a smaller steamer, Knap, which brought them to Taylor's Falls and Chisago Lake, where they arrived on October 3rd. A brother of Mrs. HÃ¥kanson (the mother ), by the name of P . A . Glader, was already settled there, and in his log house they were sheltered the first winter of their residence in Minnesota. During that winter Charles worked in the woods, and in the spring and summer helped clear the farm , which his father had bought from the government at one dollar and twenty - five cents per acre. This continued for two years; but the father was killed the first winter while cutting timber. The two sons then continued breaking the farm and cultivating it. Buying his mother's and brother 's interest, Mr. Lindahl became sole proprietor of the farm in 1865. In 1860 he married Anna Jonasdotter, who was born in Furuby in 1826 , and came to America in 1858. She is living yet, although bedridden as the result of hard pioneer work and age. They have three children ; Frank Oscar, born 1863, who is renting his father's farm ; Salomon , born in 1865, who is a farmer in the neighbor hood ; and Christina, born 1867, who lives at home. All are members of the Swedish -Lutheran church . In politics Mr. Lindahl is a Republican , but the first vote he cast was for Buchanan for president. In this con\n\nP:28\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 389 nection it is remarkable that at that time all the Swedes voted the Demo cratic ticket, but since have gone over almost in a body to Republicanism . CHARLES ANDREWS, prominent for many years in the business and public life of Chisago county, was born at Chisago Lake August 15, 1857, a son of Andrew Peter and Martha (Carlson ) Anderson, both of whom were born in Sweden , the father in Ãrtomta and the mother in Ãstra ThorsÃ¥s. Coming to the United States in 1852 Andrew P . Anderson lived for one year at Galena, Illinois, and there his first wife died , leaving him with two children . Coming then to Chisago county, Minnesota, in 1853, he purchased one hundred acres of government land here, improved and developed his place in time and continued to carry on general farm ing. In 1856 he married Martha Carlson, and of the nine children which were born of their union six are now living. During the Civil war Andrew P . Anderson served three years as a member of Company C of the Seventh Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, and he died in 1889, at the age of seventy years, his widow surviving him until 1907 and dying at the age of seventy -three years, and both now lie buried in Fairview cemetery at Lindstrom , the cemetery being a part of the old Anderson homestead. Charles Andrews received a common school training at Lindstrom and remained on his father 's farm until 1890, managing the old place and also operating a threshing machine on his own account. Moving then to Lindstrom he engaged in a general mercantile business, which he continued for nine years, while for five years he was the assessor of the township of Chisago Lake and in 1886 was elected the sheriff of the county . He remained in that office for eight years, and then after an interim of six years was again made the sheriff of Chisago county and served for another eight years, making in all sixteen years of faithful service in this capacity. In 1891 he opened a lumber business in Center City in partnership with William Carlson, and in 1907 he also purchased a lumber yard at Lindstrom from A . Earlson, and maintains a large busi ness at both places. Mr. Andrews married , on December 10 , 1892, Ellen C . Swanson , born near Ystad , in Sweden , in 1865, but she has been a resident of the United States since seven years of age. A son, Raymond C . Andrews, was born to them on October 19, 1893, and is now a pupil in the Lind strom public schools. Mr. and Mrs. Andrewsare members of the English Lutheran church, Mr. Andrews being the present treasurer of the church\n\nP:29\n\n390 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA committee, and he is a member of the fraternal order, Modern Woodmen of America. Nils J. Smith . - A live, energetic man , skilled in mechanical pur suits , Nils J. Smith is actively associated with the promotion of the indus trial interests of Lindstrom as one of the leading blacksmiths of this part of Chisago county, and is a worthy representative of the honored Swedish citizens who have, by sturdy perseverance and wise thrift, achieved suc cess in their various lines of occupation. A son of the late Jons Nelson , he was born , August 13, 1855, in Blekinge, Sweden , where he lived until attaining his majority . Jons Nelson spent his entire life in Sweden , learning the black smith 's trade in Blekinge, and there following it until his death , in 1875. His wife, Anna Nelson , remained in her native land until 1887, when she emigrated to the United States, locating in Whiteside county, Illinois, where she still resides. To her and her husband eight children were born , namely : Nils J ., the special subject of this biographical sketch ; Cary, deceased ; John August, of Port Adelaide, Australia ; Bertha, wife of John Karlstrand, a furrier in Chicago, Illinois ; Axel Harold , deceased ; Anton William ; Alexius, a farmer in this county ; and Axel, the second, de ceased . After leaving school, Nils J. Smith worked with his father in the smithy, learning the trade of a blacksmith . In 1876 , with the enterprise characteristic of his countrymen , he determined to boldly venture forth in search of fortune. With this end in view , he came to the United States, and for five years thereafter worked as a farm laborer near Sterling, Illinois. Going from there to Chicago in 1881, he followed his trade for a year , and then migrated to St. Paul. Finding employment on the large farming estate of J. J. Hill, Mr. Smith was time-keeper there a year and a half, after which he continued work for Mr. Hill for ten years, being employed as a blacksmith and an engineer. Taking up his residence in Lindstrom in 1894, he opened a blacksmith's shop , which he has since operated successfully , having won an extensive and remunerative patron age. Mr. Smith married, April 2 , 1885, Mary Dahlberg, a daughter of J. P . Magnusson , of SmÃ¥land , Sweden , and into their household four chil dren have made their advent, namely : Anna, employed in the Swedish Hospital, in Minneapolis ; Nils, James, and Esther. Religiously Mr. and Mrs . Smith are worthy members of the English Lutheran church .' Po\n\nP:30\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 391 litically Mr. Smith is quite active in the Republican party, and for three years served as a member of the village council, and for six years was clerk of the school district. ALFRED MELIN . â Prominent among the foremost merchants of Chi sago county is Alfred Melin , who is successfully engaged in the clothing business in Lindstrom , being at the head of the firm of Alfred Melin & Co. He was born, September 9, 1874, in Center City , Chisago county, Minnesota , of Swedish ancestry, being a son of John Melin. A native of Sweden , John Melin was born , bred and educated in the province of Blekinge. Choosing the independent occupation of a farmer, he was there employed in tilling the soil for a few years, but in 1868 came to this country with the especial purpose in view of becoming a land holder. Locating at once in Chisago county, he bought a tract of land, and began the arduous task of clearing and improving a homestead, labor ing with a resolute will, he succeeded in his efforts, and has since been prosperously employed in general farming. To him and his wife , whose maiden name was Celia Nelson, eight children have been born, namely : James E ., a banker in Center City, Chisago county ; Alfred , the special sub ject of this sketch ; Victor, engaged in agricultural pursuits in Chisago county ; Minnie, wife of W . D . Olson , of Isanti county ; Amanda, wife of Elmer Nelson , a farmer in Sugar Grove, Pennsylvania ; Effie, wife of Russell Carlson, a monument dealer in Little Falls, Minnesota ; Alphine, living at home; and Irving, also at home. Receiving while young a practical common school education, Alfred Melin was likewise well trained in the various branches while living on the home farm . Going to Minneapolis in 1899, he was there employed in business as a grocer for two years, when , in 1901, he located in Lindstrom , where, in partnership with his brother, James E . Melin , he has since carried on a substantial clothing business under the firm name of Alfred Melin & Co., being the leading merchants in that line in this part of the county. Mr. Melin married, December 31, 1900 , Ida Engelson, daughter of S . C . Engelson , of Center City , Minnesota, and they are the parents of two children , namely : Ardella and Lester. Politically Mr. Melin is an active worker in the Republican ranks, and has served most satisfactorily as pres ident of the Village Council. Religiously he is a member of the English Lutheran church , and fraternally he belongs to the Modern Woodmen of America .\n\nP:31\n\n392 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA OTTO ANDERSON , retired farmer, residing near Lindstrom , in Chisago county , Minnesota , was born October 7 , 1835 , at UgnanÃ¤s, in Hofmantorp parish , SmÃ¥land, Sweden , his parents being Anders and Kajsa Anderson. Ashe was the youngest in a family of eight children , he was named Otto, or \\\" Ã tto ,â which , in Swedish ,means eight. The first of his family to leave his native country for America was Peter G ., the oldest brother, who arrived here in 1867. Samuel, another brother, followed about thirteen years later, and , like his brother, settled in Chisago county. Both are now dead, and Otto, the subject of this sketch , is the only survivor of the family . Andreas, the father, possessed a decidedly mechanical nature, and he built and operated , a grist mill, a cloth finishing plant and a dyeing estab lishment; but getting old and feeble, and not having sufficient capital to continue so many industries, he abandoned all except that of dyeing . Otto finished a short course in the parish school and became con firmed, when he was sixteen years old ; but even at this youthful period, the conditions of the family became such as to make it necessary for him to succeed his father in the dyeing business, and he thus assumed the whole management of the plant, and continued it until he departed for America, seventeen years later. Through his business relations in Sweden he acquired an extensive acquaintance, and by all his acquaintances and friends he was called â Otto FÃ¤rgare,\\\" which meant Otto the dyer. This name followed him to Amer ica, and is still used by his older friends. Mr. Anderson came to the United States in 1868 , arriving by boat at Taylor's Falls , with but two dollars in his pocket. His wife and the three children were left in Sweden until he could earn enough money to pay their passage, which was accomplished in less than a year. Upon the arrival of his family in 1869, Mr. Anderson bought, on easy terms, a tract of school land. This land was six miles south of Taylor's Falls, near the St. Croix river, on the so -called â stage-road.\\\" He built a small log house thereon , which of necessity was constructed on princi ples of stern simplicity and rigid economy. The land was heavily tim bered , requiring many years of hard labor to clear enough to sustain a family. In the meantime Mr. Anderson was obliged to work out as a harvest hand during the summer months, the scene of his labors being near New Richmond and Hudson , Wisconsin . This was arduous work for a man unaccustomed thereto ; but the native courage, determination and per severance, so characteristic of \\\" SmÃ¥lÃ¤ndingar,\\\" conquered all difficulties.\n\nP:32\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 393 Great was his triumph when enough land had been cleared to plant, between the huge stumps, six bushels of wheat, three bushels of rye, and somepotatoes; but his joy was of short duration, for a cyclone, accompa nied by hail, entirely destroyed his first crop. This was the most trying year of Mr. Anderson's existence ; but, undaunted in spirit, he worked and persevered until he recovered from the blow . After a period of prosper ity he was able to buy more land, and finally became the proud possessor of one hundred and twenty acres,which, in its high state of cultivation and development, constituted one of the best and most productive farms in Chisago county. His labors, and those of his estimable wife, who in all the trying years had performed her full share, had at last been rewarded. Before emigrating Mr. Anderson had married, in 1859,Miss Johanna Malmberg, born October 4, 1836 , in JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping parish, Sweden . They have had ten children , of whom seven are living . August J., the oldest , born in Sweden , 1860 , has served four years as a representative in the State Legislature, and is now a State Food In spector. He is married to Miss Josephina J. Holm , of Taylor's Falls. They have three daughters and reside at Lindstrom . Ida J., born in Sweden, is married to Herman Hallstrom . For many years they resided on a homestead near Seattle, Washington, and later moved to a farm in Sibley county, Minnesota . Victor C ., born in 1871, being the first born on the old homestead, in Chisago county ,was for thirteen years Deputy Auditor of Chisago county , and now occupies a responsible position in the State Grain Inspection Serv ice. He is married to Miss Miranda Swanson , a granddaughter of Anders Swenson , who was one of the first three settlers of the Chisago LakeCoun try, and who owned the land on which the townsite of Center City is now located . Mary E . is married to John Taylor, a Government engineer at Fort Missoula , Montana ; Josephina H . is engaged in themillinery trade in Min neapolis, Minnesota ; Clara M . is a book -keeper in Seattle, Washington ; Anna resides with her parents. In 1905 Mr. Anderson sold his farm and purchased a beautiful wooded tract of fifteen acres, near Lindstrom , where he and his wife will probably spend the balance of their lives. Both Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, despite the years they are carrying , and the many hardships they have experienced , are still enjoying fairly good health and are happy in their beautifulhome, surrounded as they are by all the ordinary comforts of an age of comforts. They attend regularly\n\nP:33\n\n394 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA the services of the Swedish Lutheran church at Center City, of which they have ever been consistent and devoted members. Mr. Anderson has always been of a cheerful and happy disposition , kind hearted and inflexibly honest, while Mrs. Anderson is a splendid type of those sturdy pioneer women , whose persistent toil and watchful frugal ity have constituted the most potent factors of ultimate success. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson enjoy, as they deserve to enjoy, the respect and esteem of all who know them . ALBERT F. Carlson is the proprietor and operator of a busy saw mill, box factory and planing mill at Chisago City , and the owner of timber lands both in Minnesota and Wisconsin . He was born four miles north of Chisago City, March 9, 1877, and his parents are John W . and Lina S. Carlson , the former born in 1840 and the latter in 1836 . They hail from SandsjÃ¶ , SmÃ¥land , John W . having come to America in 1870 and Mrs. Carlson in 1871. They had five children , of whom two daughters died in infancy, in Sweden. The others are as follows: Amanda C ., at home ; Edward A ., book -keeper and shareholder in the Farmers' Co -operative stores in Lindstrom and Chisago City, and Albert F ., of this sketch . He was educated in the district school and confirmed in the Chisago Lake Swedish Lutheran church . At eighteen years of age he boughthis father 's farm , which he continued to operate until 1901, when he sold it and bought land at Kost, Chisago county, on which he built a saw mill and a box factory. This he conducted until 1907, when he bought a tract of timber land in Wisconsin , on which he also erected a saw mill and box factory, which he sold to his partner, Elmer F . Erickson , in 1909, retaining the saw mill, which he at once removed to Chisago City. Here he has built a box factory, a saw mill and a planing mill on a scale that is extensive for this part of the state , equipping his plant with all kinds of modern machinery. The business was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota in 1909 by A . F . Carlson , Edward A . Carlson and O . F . Peehl, A . F . Carlson being the president and manager of the concern, Mr. Peehl, vice-president, and Edward A . Carlson , secretary and treasurer. The corporate capital is $ 15,000. Mr. Carlson is, as can be gathered from the foregoing , a very indus trious and enterprising young man . To use his own words, he has been so busy \\\"he has had no time to get married .â He still retains his one hundred and twenty acres of land at Kost and one hundred and forty acres of timber land in Polk county , Wisconsin . He also has a half interest in\n\nP:34\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 395 a threshing machine, which is well patronized by the farmers of Chisago county. Mr. Carlson is a member of the Modern Woodmen, and sociable, as well as industrious and successful. PETER JOHAN GUSTAFSON , a widely known agent for agricultural im plements and a skilled blacksmith and farmer , was born in Elmeboda (BrÃ¤nnebo ), SmÃ¥land, August 10, 1865. His parents were Gustaf and Maja Lena (Peterson ) Johanson. To them were born two sons, the sub ject of this sketch and Carl Ferdinand Gustafson . The latter is a cook in Minneapolis. Peter Johan received his education in the public schools in Sweden and was confirmed in the Swedish Lutheran church at Chisago City , being among the first class of 1881. At an earlier period the children from Chisago City were confirmed in the Swedish church at Center City . Mr. Gustafson came from Sweden to Chisago City in 1879, having been sent for by his uncle, Peter Johan Johanson, who was running a blacksmith and horse-shoeing shop, and is still living at the age of seventy four. Under him Mr. Gustafson learned his trade, and worked for him several years, and in 1886 , was taken into partnership . In 1897 he turned over the business to Mr. Gustafson and retired. While working in part nership with his uncle and being of a commercial mind ,Mr. Gustafson had commenced selling farming implements and machinery on his own ac count, making considerable money in that line. People who know him best claim that he is the leading agent of the implement and harvesting machine companies in this region. For years he has been doing a very extensive business in that line, as well as in horse -shoeing, blacksmithing and repairing. He has by honesty and fair dealings won the unqualified confidence of the farmers in the surrounding country, and when his cus tomers needed to buy on time, Mr. Gustafson always accommodated them , being able to hold their notes without discounting them in bank and extending them when needed. On June 9 , 1888 , Mr. Gustafson married Jennie Berg, whose parents came from Ãjaby, near VexiÃ¶ , Sweden . She was born in old Chisago City, July 6, 1869. They have three children : Minnie Alvida, born June 2, 1889 ; Carl William , who was born August 9, 1891, is a graduate of Min nesota College,now pursuing a scientific course at the Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, and expects to matriculate at the University of Minne sota ; and John Henry , born May 12, 1895,who is attending school at Chi sago City. The family are members of the Swedish Lutheran church of\n\nP:35\n\n396 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA that place, and Mr. Gustafson is a member of the Modern Woodmen of America. He owns a fine farm of forty -three acres in old Chisago City , where he has his home. VICTOR LUDWIG JOHNSON . - One of the most prominent of the men of worth in Chisago county is found in the person of Victor Ludwig Johnson , a senator, a banker and a business man of the highest ability . Born in Chisago Lake township of Chisago county, January 9, 1871, he is a son of Sven L . and Wilhelmina (Nord ) Johnson , and the father, born in Ostra Thorsas parish , SmÃ¥land, in 1835, is living now with his daugh ter Anna in North Dakota . He cameto America in 1868, while his wife came to this country with her parents from ÃstergÃ¶tland in 1856 , and she died in 1880. Of the five children in their family Victor Ludwig was the first born ; Edward is a merchant in Montana; George F . is the editor of the Chisago County News; Anna married M . M . Borman, of Abercrombie, North Dakota, and Hilda, who was quite small at her mother 's death , was adopted by J. P . Nord and his wife , and she is now the wife of A . T . Riley, a banker at Windermere, North Dakota . From the public schools Victor L . Johnson passed to the State Normal School at St. Cloud , where he pursued a teacher's course and afterward taught country school for eight years. He then began the study of law in the office of Peter H . Stolberg at Harris, and later pursued a full course of study in the law department of the University of Minnesota and grad uated from that institution in 1895 with the degree of LL . B . But he had hardly time to engage in practice before he was nominated by acclamation for the office of treasurer of Chisago county, and was elected in 1896 and served for four terms without opposition either at the primaries or at the polls, being elected without a single dissenting vote. At the expiration of his fourth term he voluntarily withdrew in order to engage in the banking business. The Chisago County State Bank , of which he is the cashier , was originally organized as a private bank by James E . Melin, John C . Carlson and Victor L . Johnson , each taking a third interest, but in the year of 1906 this institution was incorporated as a state bank with a capital of twenty five thousand dollars, Mr. Melin becoming its president and Mr. Johnson its cashier . The bank is now the largest in the county, and has deposits amounting to three hundred thousand dollars. Mr. Johnson is also a part owner of the State Bank of Scandia , Minnesota, and with others is inter ested in Minnesota land , of which four thousand acres are timbered and\n\nP:36\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 397 one thousand in farm lands. In 1906 Mr. Johnson became a candidate for the office of state senator and was elected by a three to one vote, and his career in that office was characterized by the highest integrity and is well worthy of emulation . Hemarried in 1899 Miss Ida Tuvey , born at Taylor's Falls, Chisago county, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Nels Tuvey, who came to this county as pioneers in 1858 . Of the two children of this union the daughter died in infancy and the son , Cyril, was born October 1 , 1901. Mr. Johnson is a Blue Lodge Mason and a member of the Knights of Pythias and the Mod ern Woodmen . HENRY AUGUSTUS SWENSON , surveyor of Chisago county at Center City, and a civil engineer who has earned a fine reputation in railroad, har bor and drainage work, is a splendid credit to himself, his family and his Swedish ancestry.

In 1906 he was elected surveyor of Chisago county and at the completion of his term , January 1, 1909 , he declined a renomination , but his successor, Harry Colwell, having resigned , Mr. Swenson was appointed to fill the position until the next term . In connection with other duties, since 1899 he has continuously maintained an office for the general practice of general engineering and surveying. He is a member of the Civil Engineers' Society of St. Paul, of the Commercial Club of St. Paul, and of the Minnesota Historical Society â a man of broad and able professional character, and a popular and sociable gentleman . Rev. ANDREW SJOBERG . â Without thought of self, and with the spirit of the Master manifested in his labors, Rev. Andrew Sjoberg is faithfully ministering to the spiritual needs of his congregation at the Swedish Mission church of Rush City , Minnesota, where he has served as pastor for ten years. Hewas born, December 5 , 1865, in Vermland , Sweden ,where his parents, John Larson and Britta (Erickson ) lived and died , being engaged in agricultural pursuits.

Receiving his rudimentary education in the common schools, An drew Sjoberg remained at home, assisting his father in the care of the farm until 1892. Emigrating in that year to the United States, he fol\n\nP:38\n\nSWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA 399 lowed farming in Grant county , Minnesota , for seven months, when, having been interested in religious matters from early life, he began pre paring himself for the ministry. Going to Minneapolis, Mr. Sjoberg studied theology in that city two years, after which he continued the study in Chicago for a year, then returned to Minneapolis, where he again studied for a year. Being then sent out in the mission field , he was in North Dakota for six months, in Iowa seven months, and at Winnipeg Junction, Minnesota, three and one-half years. For the past ten years Mr. Sjoberg has been pastor of the Swedish Missions church in Rush City , Minnesota , in 1902 being ordained as a minister, and is performing the duties connected with his positon most faithfully . On April 15, 1902, Mr. Sjoberg married Amanda Berg, of Moor head , Minnesota, and they have three children, namely : Herbert Ver non , May Harriet, and Wendell Vernon . Politically Mr. Sjoberg is a Republican . Rev. CARL A . STEN HOLM . - Although he has been in theministry a comparatively short time, Rev. Carl A . Stenholm , as pastor of the Swe dish Lutheran church at Rush City , Chisago county , is carrying on a most successful work in the building up of his congregation. He is well educated, a deep thinker, and as broad and liberal in his spirit as he is sincerely devout in his convictions. A Swede by birth and breeding, he was born, December 13, 1873, in GrÃ¶ngÃ¶lsmÃ¥la Tving, Blekinge lÃ¤n, where his parents, Sven Manson and Ellen Olson , spent their lives. His father , a farmer by occupation , died in 1875, in manhood's prime, leaving two children , namely : Carl A ., the subject of this sketch ; and Ida, wife of Magnus Abramson , a farmer in Lindstrom , Minnesota . The mother subsequently married for her second husband Andrew Pilquist, by whom she had two children , also, Alma and Walfried. Coming to America in May, 1888, a lad of fourteen years, Carl A . Stenholm worked as a farm hand in Almelund, Chisago county , Min nesota , until 1895. Having by that time a sufficient sum of money to warrant him in so doing , he entered Gustavus Adolphus College, in St. Peter, from which he was graduated in 1905.

THE MARINE SETTLEMENT. â The Swedish settlement Marine is lo cated in the northeast corner of Washington county, embracing towns 31 and 32 , range 20 , together with a narrow strip of land east of range 19. The northern part of town 32 was originally and exclusively settled by Swedes. They came mostly from SmÃ¥land and Dalsland, although VestergÃ¶tland, Vermland and Helsingland also have contributed their quota. The land which is elevated about 500 feet above the level of the St. Croix river, is watered abundantly by a number of small creeks, of which Silver creek is the largest, as well as by beautiful lakes. The largest of these is Lake Vasa or Big Marine Lake, commonly called Big Lake. It extends its water four miles in length and three miles in width . West of this lake is White Rock Lake, named for a large white stone in the middle of the lake. In the northern part of the settlement is Bony Lake, which received its name after Peter Bony or Bondy ( Bonde) , one of the first Swedish settlers on this lake. Then there are Goose Lake, Hay Lake, Long Lake and Fish Lake. All these lakes are in town 32 or the original Swedish settlement. The city of Marine, or Marine Mills, was founded in 1839 . This neighborhood was probably the first settled in Minnesota . In 1848, when Wisconsin was admitted as a state in the Union and Minnesota organ ized as a territory , the town of Marine held its first election. Among the first Swedes who lived in this vicinity is mentioned a man by the name of Jacob Tornell. He lived among the Indians, with whom he traded in furs and skins. He was killed in 1847 by an Indian. The murderer was caught and tried before a jury made up of new set tlers from Marine, Stillwater and other places on the river. He was found guilty and was hung at St. Croix Falls. At the execution almost the whole white population , about fifty persons, were present. It was 405\n\nP:45\n\n406 SWEDISH -AMERICANS OF MINNESOTA almost expected that the Indians who were there in large numbers would try to free the prisoner, but, although four hundred warriors strong, they were quietly looking on while the murderer suffered the penalty of his misdeed . The first Swedes to take up claims and settle here were three young men who came in 1850. One of them was Oscar Roos, who later be came a prominent politician and business man in Chisago county , another was Charles FernstrÃ¶m , who later moved to Iowa, and the name of the third was Sandahl, who later returned to Sweden . They pre-empted land and settled at Hay Lake, but the following spring transferred their rights to Daniel Nilson who had just then arrived. In the spring of 1851 six families arrived from Helsingland. They all intended to settle at Chisago Lake, but two of them , Daniel Nilson and Englund found the land there covered with too much heavy timber and consequently hard to clear for which reason they decided to hunt for some places better suited to their tastes. They went south"
