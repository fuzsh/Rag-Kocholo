        "text": "Runrön is a scholarly series for monographs, collections and conference proceedings. Contact Henrik Williams if you are interested in publishing your work in the series. Please note that Runrön does not accept individual articles or short notices.\n\nHere are som technical and formal guidelines for manuscripts to be published in Runrön.\n\nFile format\n\nSubmit your manuscript as an ordinary text document (e.g. rtf, doc(x) or odt).\n\nFonts\n\nAs main font, we encourage you to choose one that covers relevant characters with diacritics, for instance Times New Roman. If you need to display phonetic symbols or other special characters, we recommend Junicode as main font. Transliterations are formated in bold style in the main font or Runlitt B Unicode (please do not use Runlitt A). For runes, please make use of the Unicode code range Unicode runic whenever possible (Unicode Runic is supported by, among many other fonts, Junicode). For forms that are not available in Unicode, please use one of Svante Lagman’s Futhark fonts, mainly Futhark A. Do NOT use non-Unicode fonts other than the Futhark fonts.\n\nPlease contact us if you need a character that is available neither in the Unicode or Mufi standards nor in Runlitt B or Futhark A.\n\nTypographical guidelines\n\nPlease apply a minimum of formatting to your manuscript. Here are some guidelines:\n\nFont size: 12pt\n\nLine height: 1,5\n\nHeaders: Use the styles for headers (Header 1, Header 2 etc.) in the standard stylesheet of your word processing program. Alternatively you may use regular size and style with a blank line before and after each header.\n\nParagraphs: Put a paragraph break before each new paragraph. Please do not use tabs or spaces for indentation.\n\nPictures, illustrations, tables etc: Do not place pictures, illustrations or tables in your document. Instead, submit them as separate files, indicating in the manuscript where we should put them. Photographs must have a resolution of at least 300ppi.\n\nUse italics for terms and linguistic examples (i.e. words in the source document’s language).\n\nBold style (or Runlitt B) is reserved for runic transliterations.\n\nTranslations into a modern language must be put between single quotation marks.\n\nUse quotation marks according to the respective language’s typographical conventions, i.e. “English”, „Deutsch‟, ”Svenska” etc.\n\nReferences\n\nRunrön uses a modified Harvard system. Please take a look at the latest volumes in the series.\n\nGuidelines regarding the list of references\n\nIncluding publisher is optional, as is using italics for book and journal titles, as long as you are consistent. The use of “ed.”, hrsg. von”, “red.” etc. depends on the language of your publication, not of the source referenced.\n\nFor articles in volumes of Runrön\n\nLanguage\n\nWe encourage you to write in your native language or in whatever language you master best, provided it is Danish, English, German, Norwegian, or Swedish.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nPlease submit an abstract and keywords in English along with your manuscript (regardless of the language of the article itself). The abstract should not exceed 250 words."
