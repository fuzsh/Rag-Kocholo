        "text": "CONNECTION AND CONTINUITY: THE REITH FAMILY\n\nFor corrections, additions, comments, email:\n\nDavid Reith: [email protected]\n\nWelcome to the 2004 version of a family record that I maintained for five years in the mid-1980's. The directory has changed from a photocopied to an electronic format, but I have maintained the same information. In the many years since I last did this, events like births and deaths, marriages and divorces, graduations and new jobs, changes of address and retirements have all occurred. Please help me update these events and keep the record current by post or email. The basic criterion I used previously in deciding whom to include was the surname: anyone who was born into the Reith family or married into the family and carried the name at one time or another was included. As before, however, certain problems present themselves in determining whom to include: 1. How far should records extend when a female Reith marries outside the family and takes a new family name? Are her children Reith members? Her grandchildren? Her husband? What I have done: I have included her children but stopped at that generation. 2. Conversely, how far back should we go in defining the family? That is, I have a record for Franz Liebich, Grandmother Ida's father. Is he a member of the family? What I have done: nothing because there are insufficient records to worry about the problem yet. 3. Are children of females who marry into the family considered Reith family members? What I have done: I have included them. 4. What happens when a female marries a Reith but does not use the Reith name? Is she a member of the family? What I have done: I have included her. 5. What happens when a female who has married into the family divorces? What I have done? Most likely the name will be deleted from the database, even if she continues to use the Reith name. 6. How do I identify the parents of a Reith family member when the mother divorces and does/does not retain the Reith name? What I have done: I probably will maintain the name as a parent for the children's entries, separating the parents' names with a semicolon (rather than using \"and\") and using whatever surname I have for her, prefacing any new name with \"Reith.\" 7. Is the husband of a female Reith who marries and assumes a new name a member of the Reith family? That's a tough call: he's never been nor will be a Reith, but in fact could be closer \"family\" than even biological members. What I have done: I have excluded them but usually make a note about them or their contributions as part of the wife's entry. This is not cast in stone nor is it sacred. 8. What happens to the adopted child of a female Reith who marries and takes a new name? The child is not biologically a Reith, nor is the family name Reith, though the adopting mother is biologically a Reith. What I have done: I will leave the decision to the parent. In time, I will add an index, an html function to go immediately to a name, and some kind of search capability. Until then, it will be a bit cumbersome to find a person, but anyone who was previously listed (and one or two whom I missed) are here. Perhaps some kind of password that would permit only members of the Reith family to access the information would also be possible, but I will need some help from the techies among you. I am not a genealogist and do not know how to construct a family chart; please help me if you have talent in that area. The order of names here generally follows that in the previous hardcopy editions, though I have begun to do a little grouping, with many of the deceased members (indicated by a \"+\" preceding the name) entered first and I have put some families together. I will also print this out after it has been substantially revised and make a limited number of hard copies, as before, and send them out; they can be easily photocopied at your local Kinko's if you prefer that format. In the meantime, click here for a tentative alphabetical name list. To search for any name otherwise, use \"control\" + \"f\" and type in the name. [This is a is a very old file and I will get around to updating it - sometime!] Records for \"Reith\" at Crown Point Cemetery in Kokomo may be found online here . That record includes photographs of some memorials. The Kokomo Tribune's genealogy website also has a worthwhile database. Bless.
