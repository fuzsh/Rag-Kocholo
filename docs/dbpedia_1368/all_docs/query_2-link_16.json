It doesn't mean that there's no-one with that name at all!\n\nFor less common surnames, the figures get progressively less reliable the fewer holders of that name there are. This data is aggregated from several public lists, and some stats are interpolated from known values. The margin of error is well over 100% at the rarest end of the table!\n\nFor less common surnames, the frequency and \"per million\" values may be 0 even though there are people with that name. That's because they represent less than one in a million of the population, which ends up as 0 after rounding.\n\nIt's possible for a surname to gain in rank and/or total while being less common per million people (or vice versa) as there are now more surnames in the USA as a result of immigration. In mathematical terms, the tail has got longer, with a far larger number of less common surnames.\n\nFigures for top states show firstly the states where most people called ARNESON live. This obviously tends to be biased towards the most populous states. The second set of figures show where people called ARNESON represent the biggest proportion of the population. So, in this case, there are more people called ARNESON in Wisconsin than any other state, but you are more likely to find a ARNESON by picking someone at random in North Dakota than anywhere else."
