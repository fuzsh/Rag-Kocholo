        "text": "In 1641, the New Sweden Company had decided to buy out the Dutch participants. Afterward New Sweden was a wholly Swedish venture with the government of Sweden as one of the stockholders. John Printz was appointed governor at the age of 50 in 1642.\n\nA new charter was drafted with 28 articles. The Instruction deals in great detail with the treatment of the various groups living within the territory of New Sweden. Most remarkable is the article dealing with the treatment of the Indians. As a consequence of these instructions, the Swedes enjoyed far better relations with the Indians than did any other European group and never experienced the massacres of the type visited on the Dutch and the English. The last article of The Instruction states that Printz's appointment is for three years. He would then be free to return home. He ended up staying years longer.\n\nTwo ships, the Fama and the Swan, left Gothenburg, early in November and arrived at Fort Christina in February. On his arrival, Commander Ridder assisted Printz in surveying the colony and becoming familiar with its operation. The survey was very thorough and went the full distance from Cape Henlopen to Sankikin (Trenton Falls). He noted particular points that would be of importance for defense of the colony and areas that were suitable for agriculture.\n\nHe built a new fort below present Salem and called it Elfsborg. The heaviest cannon available were positioned there and by early May 1643 any foreign vessel trying to pass had to strike its flag before being allowed to proceed. The garrison, 13 men under Sven Skute, was the largest in the colony. He erected a second large fort, used for the Indian Trade, Fort Korshom, on an island near the mouth of the\n\nPrintz wasted no time selecting a new place for his residence as authorized in the Instruction. He chose Tinicum Island just south of the present Philadelphia Airport. He built both a Governors residence with supporting buildings and a fortified house, New Gothenburg, for their defense. The fortified house was ready by early May.\n\nThe first buildings have been described in some detail, but a fire in November 1645 destroyed all of them except for the storehouse. The residence was rebuilt shortly thereafter. Peter Lindeström, who arrived in New Sweden in 1654, tells us that Printz had a hall built \"for himself and his family, which is called Printzhof - very splendidly and well built with a pleasure garden, summer house and other such things.\" Tinicum therefore became the first seat of government in what is now the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Printzhof can be considered its first State House.\n\nIn addition to living quarters for the governor and his family, the building contained several rooms for office use, for record keeping, and for court proceedings, as well as for receiving commissioners from adjacent colonies and other prominent visitors. It is known that some of the interior woodwork came from Sweden as did at least some of the bricks used for the construction of two or more fireplaces. Many windows of glass added to the luxury. Printz had his private residence at Upland, a farm known as Printzdorf.\n\nPrintzhof also became the first seat of a court and Printz the first chief judge in present Pennsylvania.\n\nFort Christina was repaired during the summer of 1643, and a blockhouse was built to the north at Upland (now Chester), an area in which many of the Finns settled. Printz assigned land to the freemen and he established commercial and political relations with the Indians. As instructed, Printz paid great attention to religious matters and, in addition to the church at Christina, he built a \"new beautiful church\" at Tinicum that was consecrated in 1646. Above all he made efforts to assert the Swedish rights to the New Sweden territory against the counter claims of the Dutch and the English.\n\nThe colony prospered, but the problems with the surrounding Dutch and English gradually increased in severity. Both nations claimed the Swedish territory by virtue of the first discovery. However, neither had ever established a permanent settlement in the New Sweden territory and neither had purchased the land from the Indians. Printz made every effort to keep peace with both groups.\n\nCommercially, the colony began to suffer a setback in the beginning of 1644. The ships that brought Printz to New Sweden carried only a small cargo and hardly anything for Indian trade. As a consequence, Printz could not prevent the Dutch and the English from almost monopolizing the beaver trade. Finally the Fama arrived with a large cargo in March 1644. Now the Swedes could resume the Indian trade and the ship left for Europe with a large cargo of tobacco and skins.\n\nPrintz had become greatly encouraged by the progress made during the first year of his administration, but he was also keenly aware of the great problems associated with a lack of manpower. He therefore sent an urgent request for 1,000 colonists and additional supplies.\n\nNearly two and one-half years later in October 1646 the next ship, the Gyllene Haj (Golden Shark), arrived with a large cargo both for the Indian trade and the needs of the colony that gave raise to considerable joy in New Sweden where, despite the lack of manpower and fresh supplies, considerable progress had been made after the Fama left. A gristmill was constructed on Cobbs Creek that was the first manufacturing facility within the limits of present-day Pennsylvania and can be considered a forerunner of the huge industrial establishments that eventually grew up within the Commonwealth. Printz constructed a wharf at Fort Christina, and he built several ships, one of 100 tons burden.\n\nOne of these ships was outfitted using a yacht type sail arrangement. This name has cause all sorts of confusion with claim that he had built himself a pleasure yacht within the modern meaning of the term. He used his yacht-rigged vessel to haul cargo up and down the river. It had movable sideboards rather than a fixed keel for directional control so it could sail in shallow water up some of the creeks that joined the South, or Delaware, river.\n\nWhen the Gyllene Haj arrived, Printz expected to be recalled since he had been in charge of the colony for more than three years and under very difficult conditions, years \"that were longer and more arduous to him than all of the previous twenty-four during which he had served his dear fatherland\". He \"'became sad\" when he was instructed to stay a few years longer because no suitable successor could be found. However, he accepted the extension of his appointment and proclaimed a special day of Thanksgiving. The settlers assembled in the new church and gave praise to God with a holy \"Te Deum\" (Latin, an expression of thanksgiving or exultation.)\n\nAfter the arrival of the Gyllene Haj, the outlook was better in New Sweden. Printz's report showed the colony was still very small, 183 souls in all, but the conditions were greatly improved. Printz' sent a report of the past activity. He also sent a list of needed articles and a request for skilled workmen to needed to complete a barge.\n\nPreparations were already underway in Sweden for a new expedition. The Swan was selected and left Gothenburg with one of the largest cargoes ever for the Indian trade. The Swan arrived in good condition in January 1648.\n\nWith the arrival of the Swan, Printz had again hoped to be relieved of his duties but was directed to remain. The conditions would now have given rise to considerable optimism in New Sweden, were it not for the increasingly aggressive stance of the Dutch exacerbated by the arrival of Peter Stuyvesant as Director General of New Netherlands.\n\nThe letters and reports from New Sweden apparently made a major impression when read in Stockholm. It was now decided to send a new expedition - the Katten (Cat). This ship and its passengers never arrived in New Sweden but were shipwrecked and ended in atrocities at the hands of the French and Spaniards from which only 19 survived and returned to Sweden.\n\nThe situation in New Sweden grew increasingly worse. In May of 1651 Stuyvesant sent a fleet of eleven ships with cannon and people \"well armed from New Amsterdam.\" Printz readied his little yacht and sailed it with his entire force of 30 soldiers to trail after the Dutch fleet. The Dutch fleet made several long loops up and down the river firing salutes, banners and flags flying and drummers beating at the rail of all ships.\n\nPrintz could not do anything but follow at some distance. Failing to entice an armed response from Printz to justify an invasion Stuyvesant landed at Sandhook (New Castle) and used 200 men to build a fort. He named Ft. Casimir. The fort was strategically placed to disrupt communications with Fort Elfsborg so it could not be reactivated.\n\nStuyvesant soon obtained title to the land Minquas Kill (Christina River) down to the Bay, land that had already been purchased by the Swedes. Protests and copies of deeds were sent to Stuyvesant but he ignored them. Printz had no choice but to accept the fact that the Dutch were masters of the Delaware, at least for the time being. Ft. Elfsborg had been abandoned and the garrisons of some of the other strong houses were withdrawn so Printz could concentrate his forces. Heavy rains did damage to the grain stores in 1652 and the situation in the colony grew steadily worse. Printz continued to send pleas for help to Sweden, but without response.\n\nThe colonists themselves were dissatisfied and many deserted. The situation continued throughout the winter, spring and summer of 1653. By the fall of that year it reached a crisis point and a \"protest\" broke out against Printz, who had been ill and unable to exert his former energy during much of the year. Several severe grievances against the governor were presented in a written supplication of eleven articles signed by 22 settlers. This invoked the wrath of the governor. Printz had the leader of the opposition arrested, tried and executed on a charge of treachery.\n\nPrintz finally decided to go to Sweden in the fall of 1653 to obtain help himself. Elaborate preparations were made for his departure. In September, Indian chiefs were called to Printzhof, speeches were made, gifts presented, etc. Above all, Printz assured the Indians that large new supplies would soon arrive because he himself was going to the fatherland to take care of the matter. After a farewell service in the church, Printz turned the command of the colony over to his son-in-law, Johan Papegoja, and left for New Amsterdam.\n\nPrintz lay in a sickbed in the Netherlands as his replacement, Johan Risingh, on his way to New Sweden passed by without stopping. Being 62 years old when he returned to Sweden in 1654, he spent the next three years without an official position but he was made a general. In 1658 he was appointed Governor of Jönköping County. While traveling from his estate, Gunillaberg, not far from his birth place, Bottnaryd, to Jönköping in the spring of 1663, he was thrown from his horse and died of injuries on May 3rd, at age of 71. His first wife, Elizabeth von Boche, who he had married in 1622 and his son, predeceased him. Five daughters and his second wife, Maria von Linnestau, who he had married in 1642, survived him.\n\nJohan Classon Risingh was the last governor of the Swedish colony of New Sweden.\n\nHe was born in 1617 in Risinge, Östergötland, Sweden. After gymnasium (a school that prepares pupils for university entrance.) at Linköping, he attended the University of Uppsala and University of Leyden. From 1651 to 1653, he held the office of secretary of the Commercial College of Sweden. He wrote the first treatise on trade and economics ever compiled in Sweden in the autumn of 1653. He was ennobled just before he set out from Sweden early in 1654, to take up duties in New Sweden. His orders read that he was to assist Governor Printz but if Printz was dead or no longer in the Colony he was to assume the office of Governor.\n\nRisingh was specifically directed in his orders to AVOID any and all confrontations with the Dutch at Fort Cassimir. He was directed to sail by avoiding any contact. He was directed to reactivate Fort Elfsborg and to build a new fort on the west bank of the main river directly opposite of Fort Elfsborg.\n\nRisingh made no attempt to follow his orders. He seemed only intent upon improving his own condition of superiority. He behaved more like a dictator than a governor.\n\nRisinghs first blunder occurred on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Before sailing Risingh learned Governor Printz was lying sick in Amsterdam. He deliberately ordered the Skipper of the Örn (Eagle), Jan Jansson Bockhorn, not to dock in the Netherlands where voyage repairs were normally preformed prior to setting out across the ocean. Rising deliberately deprived himself of a briefing from Printz who would have told him about conditions in New Sweden.\n\nHad Risingh followed his clear orders he would have reestablished Swedish control over shipping on the river without ever having any direct conflict with Fort Cassimir. Had Risingh followed his orders Stuyvesant would not have had Risinghs \"military capture of Fort Cassimir his first day on the job to use as the excuse to invade and take over all of New Sweden. Governor Printz was smart enough not to get caught in the trap but Risingh eagerly leaped right into the shark's mouth. Risingh probably realized he had blundered badly right away when he, or perhaps Swen Skute, walked into the captured fort and discovered that all of the Dutch cannons were inoperable.\n\nFort Cassimir was a decoy fort because none of its cannons could be fired. During the three years since it had been built it had never been supplied with cannonballs and gunpowder. Thanks to Risinghs senseless acts the baited trap worked. In late May 1654, only about three weeks after his arrival, Risingh received a letter from Stuyvesant telling him that the Dutch were coming in force to take over all of New Sweden in direct response to his military attack and capture of Fort Cassimir. At that moment, just weeks after his arrival and capture of Fort Cassimir, Risingh knew without any doubt whatsoever that he alone was responsible for the lost of the entirety of the New Sweden Colony. Contrary to his later claim that the Dutch invasion was unexpected he knew it was coming sixteen months in advance. Rather than trying to negotiate a settlement with the Dutch or prepare defenses Risingh set about to find someone he could blame for his blunders. He went farther in trying to ensure that some of his fellow colonist and soldiers would likely be killed during the Dutch invasion.\n\nIn reply Rising sent a letter to Stuyvesant saying that it was agreeable to him if the Dutch killed everyone south of the Christina River if he, Stuyvesant, would stop the invasion at that point and leave him and his \"estate\" alone. Stuyvesant did not reply to this letter. From his silence Risingh apparently assumed that Stuyvesant agreed with his death proposal. Risingh apparently had the idea that if everyone at Trinity died then no one would be left alive who knew how badly he had blundered by disobeying his orders.\n\nRisingh again violated his specific orders when he directed Swen Skute to build Fort Trinity in front of Fort Cassimir thereby blocking sight of the river from the Dutch fort and rendering it completely useless. Risinghs orders read that he was to build a new fort ten miles downstream opposite Elfsborg. Even worse, Risingh ignored all advice and ordered Skute to build Trinity out of timber. As a trained military officer Swen Skute knew that timber forts became lethal when hit by cannon fire. This is because wood tends to shatter into long splinters and fly out in a cloud in all directions. That is why earth is mounded up against the outside walls of timber forts. The earth tends to dampen the flight of the splinters. Fort Cassimir and Fort Christina are both examples of this precaution.\n\nSkute knew how Risinghs orders read. He knew Trinity was structurally inadequate, militarily useless, lethal to the men manning it and located in the wrong place. It would have made much more sense to put the four available cannons inside Fort Cassimir in place of some of the non-usable Dutch cannons and not build the timber fort at all. That long, narrow, two-story, all timber bulwark fort Risingh ordered Swen Skute to build, purely and simply, was a death trap. No doubt Risingh had been told this again and again.\n\nWhen Fort Trinity was completed apparently two of the four cannons available, odd-sized captured Danish 14-pound cannons obtained from the ship EAGLE, were placed on the gun deck and test fired. Because the second level structural arrangement was completely inadequate, built the worst possible way in a stacked log manner similar to a log cabin the recoil force from the firing predictably pushed over a section of the back wall. This caused the collapse of part of the gun deck where the cannons were located. The cannons were destroyed during their plunge of about 24 feet down through the wreckage to the ground. It seems likely Swen Skute, who probably was well aware of what would happen, arranged the test firing without Risinghs knowledge. Apparently no member of the gun firing crew was caught up in the collapse of the gun deck. That implies that the cannon (s) were fired from some safe distance.\n\nThis left only two serviceable weapons available at Fort Trinity. During the siege visiting Dutch officers were blindfolded with arm scarves so they could not see the damage. To make a bad situation even worse Risingh next ordered Skute to mount the two remaining weapons in trenches dug in front of Fort Trinity. Timber which would shatter into splinters standing at the gun crews back make that decision lethal. It also gave the Dutch gunners on the ships a very large target. Had the trenches been located north or south without a big wall behind them the gun emplacements would have been a more difficult target to hit.\n\nThe drumming and sail dipping on the Dutch ships as they sailed past probably did not cause any confusion. Skute knew that if the Swedes fired even a single musket shot at the Dutch fleet Stuyvesant would have leveled everything and Stuyvesant had the massive firepower on his ships to do it. Later Stuyvesant told Skute that is exactly what his orders to the Dutch fleet said. He told Skute that not even a chicken could have lived through the planned bombardment had the Swedes fired at the ships.\n\nWith only two serviceable 14-pounders available just one side of one Dutch ship sailing by out gunned the Swedes about 9 to 1. Dutch soldiers, not counting the sailors, outnumbered the Swedish defenders about 10 to 1. One or two cannonball hits on that timber fort probably would have killed the entire Swedish garrison from flying splinters. Nearly all 37 members of the garrison were either standing on top of, or standing in the gun trenches in front of, Fort Trinity as the Dutch ships sailed by. After the munity that first afternoon only 16 defenders signed the affidavits at the surrender. The rest were disarmed and locked up. After the munity the remaining defenders were outnumbered about 20 to 1.\n\nSkute soon received unexpected orders, written by Risingh himself, to surrender Fort Trinity.\n\nThe covert canoe messenger, Anders Dalbo, took Swen Skutes report of the arrival of the Dutch fleet to Risinghs and returned with written order to Skute during the first night of the siege. Risingh ordered Skute to delay as long as possible and then surrender. Skute followed Risingh's orders precisely. He delayed for three days before he surrendered. During the Court Martial hearings Risingh tried to imply that surrendering the fort was all Skutes idea and that his surrender caused the loss of all of New Sweden. Skute prudently kept Risinghs written orders, and kept it secret, for presentation to higher authorities should he be forced to stand trial in Sweden.\n\nRisingh probably realized that he had to create a lot of confusion and misdirection to cover up his blunders and violations of his orders. He did that by vigorously pointing his finger at Swen Skute who had been correct about everything all along. To create confusion Risingh included all the officers serving at Fort Trinity - except Lindeström - in his blame-shifting scheme and brought all of them to trial in his Court Martial hearings. Concealing the Fort Christina ammunition inside the Fort Christina walls and claiming he had sent it all to aid the men at Fort Trinity was simply a part of Risinghs deception plan. The cannonballs at Fort Christina were the wrong size for the 14-pound cannons at Trinity. Risingh apparently did not understand that. This deception involved the concept of out of sight-out of mind.\n\nThere is no doubt that Risingh was actively working on his deception/misdirection plan long before he surrendered because he had negotiated the article allowing him to hold his Court Martial hearings several days before he surrendered. Stuyvesant blocked part of Risinghs plan in that he only allowed Risingh to hold the hearing. Risingh could not reach any verdicts or punish (execute) anyone as a result of the hearing.\n\nIn addition Risingh negotiated an entire secret article in the surrender treaty. This secret article appears only in the Dutch copy of the treaty and does not appear in the Swedish copy. Risingh sold Fort Christinas nine bronze cannons to Stuyvesant in a thinly disguised, impossible to pay back on time, loan scheme. Actually Risingh never mentioned the loan when he returned to Sweden. He and the bookkeeper were put ashore in northern England and they traveled overland to London to cash the draft Stuyvesant gave Risingh. That draft is estimated to be worth about a million dollars in todays currency. The loan was not recorded in either New Sweden or Sweden at all and the money never appears in Sweden. After collecting the money in London Risingh and the bookkeeper went on to Amsterdam and parted there. The bookkeeper went directly to Sweden and fades out of sight. Risingh went to Germany to give a report of the lost of the Colony to the King.\n\nThe loan was duly foreclosed on for non-payment and the nine Fort Christina bronze cannons were shipped to Fort Amsterdam one day after the due date. They had already been removed from the Fort and were sitting on the dock awaiting shipment. Rev. Eric Björk was astonished to find Swedish cannons from Fort Christina in New York during his visit in 1703. The English considered them prizes of war when they captured New York from the Dutch in 1664.\n\nAfter he surrender the Colony, Risingh, other officials and some soldiers, a total of about 37 men, were taken back to Europe on Dutch ships and at Dutch expense. Risingh had Peter Lindeström completely rewrite his official Journal during the voyage home across the Atlantic. He also rewrote the Court Martial Hearing record. The altered copies Lindeström created for him all survived the voyage across the ocean without problem but the original documents, on the same ship, did not survive the voyage.\n\nRisingh died, seemingly in poverty, at Stockholm seventeen years later in 1672.\n\nThis is not a complete recounting of all of Risinghs blunders and deceptions. Most of Governor Risingh's cover-ups and deceptions have worked for him for more than 350 years. They seem to be mostly still working for him. Some parts of his plans, however, went badly astray. Thanks to Swen Skute not firing at the Dutch ships nearly everyone serving at Fort Trinity during the Dutch invasion, including Johan Andersson Stålkofta, survived. Stuyvesants policy allowing all of Risinghs intended victims to stay in New Sweden under Dutch rule as Freemen meant that none of the officers were compelled to return to Sweden to take the blame for Risinghs blunders. That forced Risingh to play the roll of victim for the rest of his life. He was also forced to pretend to be very poor when he was immensely wealthy from his illicit cannon sale. He could never enjoy the luxuries his stolen money could provide for him.\n\nStrange as it may sound had Governor Rising followed his orders and the 1655 invasion by the Dutch avoided then when the English and Dutch clashed nine years later the English probably would have avoided any confrontation with New Sweden. England and Sweden were at peace with each other. One of our states today may have been based on the territory of the former New Sweden Colony.\n\nGeneral Patton's decision, on 20 September, (1944) to fix a new boundary line between the XII and XV Corps provided some protection for the south flank of the 4th Armored Division salient. But in addition the XII Corps commander was anxious to secure a firmer grip on the supply lines leading to the 4th Armored and suggested to Patton that the Forêt de Grémecey, commanding the main highway east of Nancy, should be occupied. The forest already had been used as an assembly area for CCB, 6th Armored, when, on 22 September, General Grow was sent with his armored infantry, some cavalry, and artillery to occupy this area and screen between the 80th Infantry Division and the 4th Armored. Grow's troops pinched out the 35th Division and threw a line north of the woods between Fresnes and the western angle of the Seille. The 6th Armored was in the midst of preparations for an attack north toward Delme when word arrived that the Third Army was to go over to the defensive. On 25-26 September the 35th Division relieved Grow's troops in the Forêt de Grémecy sector and CCB, 4th Armored Division, which had held a blocking position in the Fresnes area.\n\nSince any continuation of the XII Corps advance appeared to be indefinitely postponed by General Eisenhower's order placing the Third Army on the defensive, the 35th Infantry Division settled down in anticipation of some respite from the interminable slogging that had marked the advance east of the Moselle. The 35th held a front some twelve miles in length, the Nancy-Nomény and Nancy-Château-Salins highways marking the left and right boundaries respectively. The larger part of this front (a distance of some eight miles) outlined a salient or bridgehead north and east of the Seille River. The apex of this salient was formed by the Forêt de Grémecey. Following the edge of the forest as it did, the American front line bent sharply, almost at a right angle, in the northeast corner of the woods. The Germans would attempt to exploit this disposition, for the forest angle lay only about two thousand yards from the Forêt de Château-Salins, which was still in German hands, provided ample cover for large-scale troop concentration, and was the dominant ground in this area. The right wing of the 35th Division was close to the junction of the two important enemy-held roads coming in from Morhange and Dieuze.\n\nGeneral Baade placed two of his regiments along the 35th Division main line of resistance, the 137th Infantry on the right and the 134th Infantry on the left. The 320th Infantry, which had returned from the 4th Armored Division, was assigned to the XII Corps reserve. The right regiment had hardly dug in when, on the evening of 26 September, the German guns opened fire from the Forét de Château-Salins and a sharp attack drove in the American outpost line. This was the prelude to a sustained and desperate enemy attempt to recover the Forét de Grémecey.\n\nThe First Army's failure to brush aside CCB, 4th Armored Division, in the earlier attack to effect a junction between the First Army and the Fifth Panzer Army, had brought General Knobelsdorff into General Balck's disfavor, although this was somewhat mitigated by the reverses suffered in the Fifth Panzer Army attack. Knobelsdorff was anxious to avoid a repetition of the First Army failure and ordered General Priess, who, as commander of the XIII SS Corps, was directing operations in this sector, to throw everything he had into a resumption of the attack on 27 September. Priess selected the village of Moncel, on the Nancy-Dieuze highway, as the initial objective--apparently hoping to punch a hole in the 35th Division line through which Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army could roll toward Nancy. To make this attack Priess had available the 559th VG Division (Generalmajor Kurt Freiherr von Muehlen), the 106th Panzer Brigade--elements of which already had been used against CCB in the fight at Fresnes--and the 59th Regiment of the 19th VG Division. Both of the infantry formations were new and relatively untried as units; both were somewhat under regulation strength. The 559th VG Division had a large number of veterans and, unlike many of the other VG divisions, most of its infantry came from the younger mobilization classes. The officers and noncoms were young and able veterans from the Eastern Front. The artillery regiment of the 559th was at average strength, with two light battalions and one medium. One company of tank destroyers replaced the conventional assault gun battalion as antitank defense. The 106th Panzer Brigade had been re-equipped but did not yet have a full tank complement. Balck had tied a string on the 106th by ordering Priess to send it to the Nineteenth Army the moment the combined First Army and Fifth Panzer Army attack reached the Moncel-Arracourt line.\n\nThe 559th VG Division and 106th Panzer Brigade launched their attack on the morning of 27 September as scheduled, although Priess had to be satisfied with a piecemeal commitment since some elements of both these formations had not yet arrived in the XIII SS Corps area. The 2d Battalion of the 1127th Regiment (559th VG Division) led off in an attack down the Chambrey-Pettoncourt road which took the Americans completely by surprise. The German tanks and infantry wiped out a road block east of Pettoncourt manned by troops of the 1st Battalion, 137th Infantry, overran four antitank guns, and drove on into the village of Pettoncourt, where the main American supply route crossed the Seille River. At Pettoncourt a scratch force made up of a battery of light antiaircraft artillery, some pieces from the 219th Field Artillery Battalion, and an antitank platoon from the 137th Infantry brought the German attack to a halt, although the enemy grenadiers were close enough to bring the gunners under rifle fire. (During this fight 1st Lt. Odie T. Stallcup, 1st Battalion, 137th Infantry, led his antitank platoon with such bravery that he received the DSC.) When reserves arrived from the 320th Infantry the German force withdrew slowly toward Chambrey, but lost the entire rear guard platoon when the American artillery located the range and began time fire. A second enemy column, with a few tanks and half-tracks, drove toward Grémecey, but was checked about a mile east of the village by artillery fire.\n\nAt the northeastern edge of the forest the enemy filtered in from the Forêt de Château-Salins during the morning and at some points broke through the position of the 3d Battalion, 137th Infantry. This attack drove as far as the regimental reserve line, where a company from the 737th Tank Battalion and the 752d Field Artillery Battalion--firing its 155's at point-blank range--helped the 3d Battalion to retake most of the lost ground. During this fight the Germans attempted to reinforce their assault force in the forest, but the 35th Division brought four artillery battalions into action to interdict the clearing between the Forêt de Grémecey and the Forêt de Château-Salins, and few of the enemy got through."
