Elinor Barr’s Swedes in Canada is the definitive history of their experience. Active in almost every aspect of Canadian life, Swedish individuals and companies are responsible for the CN Tower, ships on the Great Lakes, and log buildings in Riding Mountain National Park. They have built railways and grain elevators all across the country, as well as churches and old folks’ homes in their communities. At the national level, the introduction of cross-country skiing and the success of ParticipACTION can be attributed to Swedes. Despite this long list of accomplishments, Swedish ethnic consciousness in Canada has often been very low. Using extensive archival and demographic research, Barr explores both the impressive Swedish legacy in Canada and the reasons for their invisibility as an immigrant community. has written extensively about Northwestern Ontario and Scandinavian immigrants in Canada.

I am grateful to A. Ernest Epp for associating the project with the Lakehead Social History Institute, which allowed Lakehead University to accept donations and to issue income tax receipts. He also received a Human Resources Development Canada grant to pay for summer students to check census statistics, leading to publication of his book Nordic People in Canada: A Study in Demography 1861–2001. We were “The Three Musketeers,” as it were, who started the ball rolling. And did it roll! That so many individuals “caught the spirit” and helped in various ways was a wonderful inspiration to me. The project was carried out in three phases: researching, cataloguing the research material, and writing the history. The volume of research material eventually filled 12.5 metres of shelf space, the length of a large room, so that the original five-year project had to be extended to eight years. This research material has been donated to University of Manitoba Archives in Winnipeg. During the research phase I visited British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Toronto, Ottawa, and Halifax, as well as Swenson Center and Vasa Archives in Illinois and various repositories in St Paul and Minneapolis. I also spent six weeks researching in Sweden. To those who assisted with research, who offered billets and transportation, and who arranged public meetings, I am deeply grateful. Thanks are also extended to those individuals who donated family histories, memoirs, photographs, articles, newspaper clippings, and other material in various formats.\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSeveral people donated personal research material to the project, including Michael Brook of Nottingham, England, Viveka Janssen of Victoria, British Columbia, Irene Howard of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Lucille Szumutku of Stockholm, Saskatchewan. These significant collections are much appreciated and a welcome addition to the research material. I would also like to thank Helen Deachman for carrying out research at Library Archives Canada, and Carin Routledge for researching the William Wonders Collection at the University of Alberta Archives. The amount of correspondence was daunting at times. For example I received a hundred responses to an early blurb about the project, which appeared in a genealogical journal in Sweden. Most of these letters had to be answered in Swedish, and my language skills were rudimentary. One of the correspondents, retired teacher Bertil Nyström, kindly offered to help via e-mail, and the considerable improvement in my fluency is thanks to him and to the local self-help group Svenskaspråket. I would also like to thank the volunteers who translated letters, articles, and parts of books on request. They include Lars-Ove Carlson, Joanna Daxell, Siv Ek, Kerstin Guillemaud, Irina Hedman, Houdeh Houshangi, Eeva Isaksson, Tove Malmqvist, Marianne Pfister, Tina Reid, Sigrid Rishor, Eva St Jean, Maria Sandberg, and Carl Widstrand. A special thank you is due to Eva Grenier, who translated our website www.swedesincanada.ca to make it bilingual in English and Swedish, and to Elisabeth Thorsell for translating my newsletters and updates, and other additions. For the website’s design and maintenance I am grateful to Tricia Littlefield, then, after her twins were born, to Donna Brown and her crew at PC Medic, and finally to Neil Sideen of Vancouver. A study of the website in May and June 2003 recorded 960 hits, of which 40 per cent opted for the Swedish version. The project’s mailing list has remained consistent at 500 to 600 e-mail addresses. For significant donations of books I would like to thank Swenson Center in Rock Island, Illinois, Släktforskarnas hus in Leksand, Sweden, and Viveka Janssen in Canada. The names of individuals who donated or loaned books, and photocopied the sections in local histories and published articles where Swedish residents are named, can be found below. An important part of the project was indexing local histories, and for this labour-intensive task a huge bouquet is due to Verner Loov, Ann-Mari Westerback, Annette O’Brien, and Carol Barry, and to Sylvia Nordstrom for photocopying relevant articles from Swedish Press for the years 1986 to 2009. I would also like to thank the more than 200\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\n“new” immigrants who responded to our online questionnaire, as well as Linnea Lodge, Ted Simonson, and Barbro Baker for being consistent supporters in ways too numerous to relate. Two research assistants, Terry Rizzo and Pat Lamminmaki, were hired consecutively to help catalogue the research material, for a total of one year. During this time three databases were compiled, one for published and unpublished materials (almost 2,300 entries), one for immigrants before the Second World War (6,164 entries), and one for immigrants after the Second World War (213 entries). The headquarters for the Swedes in Canada project was my basement, where a second computer and research material were installed in the recreation room. Visitors who toured the facility included Ambassador Lennart Alvin. I would also like to thank Pat Lamminmaki and Beth Boegh for compiling “Honour the Pioneers,” and Ann-Mari Westerback for compiling the database of Sweden’s ambassadors and consular representatives in Canada. After completion of the draft manuscript it was submitted to readers who recommended significant changes. I am grateful to the following persons for suggestions: Phil Anderson, Don Sjoberg, Carl Widstrand, Don Wilson, and especially my adviser, Tory Tronrud, whose concise remarks helped a great deal in tailoring the manuscript to its present form. I would also like to thank Beth Boegh and her co-director, Michel Beaulieu, of the Lakehead Social History Institute, as well as the institute’s board of directors for their ongoing support behind the scenes. It is significant that the project itself has been totally funded by Swedish organizations and individuals. The chief organizational donors follow, in no particular order: District Vasa Lodge Central Canada #16, District Vasa Lodge Alberta #18, Strindberg Vasa Lodge #259 in Winnipeg, Branting Vasa Lodge #417 in Calgary, Skandia Vasa Lodge #549 in Edmonton, Bethel Lutheran Church in Camrose, Augustana Lutheran Church in Edmonton, Don Sjoberg for a memorial to Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Scandinavia, Manitoba, Swedish Embassy in Ottawa, SWEA Toronto, Norrskenet Swedish Society of Thunder Bay, Swedish Cultural Association of Manitoba, Swedish Club of Victoria, Swedish Council of America in Minneapolis, and the Arvid Lundbäck Award in Sweden. The chief individual donors were Neil Carlson, Enid Edwards, Luella Lind, Linnea Lodge, Ted Simonson, and Don and Trudy Sjoberg, although many others donated lesser amounts, including those who participated in “Honour the Pioneers.” Although Canada Council is responsible for allotting funding to Canadian authors to\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nallow worry-free time to write, successive juries missed the opportunity to support this, the first history of Swedes in Canada.

Because of the enthusiastic response the project lasted longer than expected, and my husband, Peter Barr, deserves special mention as chief cook and bottle washer to allow me uninterrupted time to work on the project throughout its eight years’ duration. A special thank you is due to Don Sjoberg, Tory Tronrud, and Beth Boegh for their unfailing support, which made possible the project’s successful completion. For all who participated, including those who have not been mentioned through oversight, rest assured that your contributions have helped to broaden my understanding, to raise the profile of Swedes in Canada, and to give descendants a sense of their place in contemporary Canada.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nMap courtesy of Bruce Jones Design.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nSWEDES IN CANADA Invisible Immigrants\n\nNote: The counties are the administrative districts of Sweden. Used with the permission of Swedish American Genealogist.\n\nChapter One\n\nUnder an Invisibility Cloak\n\nThe low profile of the 100,000 Swedish immigrants to Canada has rendered them almost invisible, as though they never existed. This chapter examines the reasons for such a phenomenon, some of them affecting different parts of the country at different times, and others more farreaching. An important factor is the lack of a comprehensive history, an issue being addressed by publication of this book. Curious descendants and others will be interested in peeking under the invisibility cloak to discover what kind of place this minority group carved out for itself in the larger Canadian society, and where they fit into the puzzle as individuals. The question of why Canada’s Swedes are not better known as a group was posed in 1977 by the Swedish-American historian Arnold Barton.1 As editor of the Swedish-American Historical Society’s quarterly journal, he put out a call for articles, but there were no takers. Finally in 1982 he devoted an entire issue to Canada, explaining that the word “American” in the title really meant “North American.”2 The emigration scholar Harald Runblom of Uppsala University wrote the lead article, “The Swedes in Canada: A Study of Low Ethnic Consciousness.”3 He thought that Swedes were themselves to blame, that they had assimilated so thoroughly that they no longer cared about their heritage. Contributing factors were racially mixed marriages resulting from wide dispersal of Swedes and uneven sex ratios, and diverse origins, not only in Sweden, but also in Finland, Estonia, and Russia. Lars Ljungmark, the scholar of Winnipeg Swedes, cited a number of reasons gleaned from the newspaper Svenska Canada-tidningen, including the suggestion that Swedish-American migrants had left their initial Swedishness behind in the United States, and that the radical politics of the\n\n4\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\n1920s newcomers made the homeland less appealing for earlier immigrants. He emphasized that the level of ethnicity was not static, but fell during the First World War and rose with the attention received by Sweden’s Middle Way,4 the name given to the reform policies of the Social Democratic Party and publicized in a 1936 book titled Sweden: The Middle Way. While the concept of low ethnic consciousness may be a factor in the lack of a published history, the relatively small number of Canada’s Swedes cannot be blamed. According to the 1931 census, residents of Swedish origin formed 0.78 per cent of Canada’s total population of 10,376,786. Those of British origin made up more than half; and French, more than one-quarter, leaving less than one-quarter – that is, 2,067,725 people – in all other categories. Germans led at 4.6 per cent, followed by Ukrainians, Jews, Netherlanders, Poles, First Nations, Italians, Norwegians, and finally Swedes. The percentage of Norwegian origin was 0.9 per cent; Finnish, 0.42 per cent; Danish, 0.33 per cent; and Icelandic, 0.1 per cent. Yet, all these Nordic immigrant groups have written histories except for Danes, who have channelled their energies into establishing a museum.5 More recently a new generation of scholars returned to the intriguing question of a Canadian mosaic in which Swedes are virtually invisible. Carina Rönnqvist of Umeå University carried out an in-depth study, published with the clever title Svea People in the Land of Babel.6 According to Canadian scholar Gerald Friesen, “the map of the southern half of the western interior was a giant checker-board of culturally and linguistically distinctive settlements.”7 After Rönnqvist considered the impact on immigrants of the homeland, Sweden, the United States, Canada’s Scandinavians, and Anglo-Saxon Canadians, and how they affected the construction of identity at the individual, organizational, and official levels, she concluded that “Sweden represented their glorious past, and Canada their prosperous present and future ... [The Swedish nationalism felt by Canadian Swedes] did not negate Canadian nationalism. Rather it functioned as [a] complementary identity within the Canadian national framework,”8 effectively reducing their visibility. It is interesting to compare the Canadian situation to Dag Blanck’s 1997 doctoral dissertation at Uppsala University,9 a study of the development of Swedish ethnic identity in the United States. He argues that the American Revolution established the country as a “new nation”: “This new nation was founded on a set of abstract political and philosophical ideas, codified in such central documents as the Declaration of\n\nInvisibility Cloak\n\n5\n\nIndependence and the Constitution, and the U.S. was thus what Wilbur Zelinsky has called an 'ideological construct,' making it different from other 'old' nations in that it lacked 'strong historical or territorial tradition' or common 'cultural bonds' such as a common religion or language.”10 Swedish immigrants, many with former allegiances to small communities rather than to the national entity, were introduced to a much larger nationalism based on the American political ideals of liberty, equality, and republicanism. Commitment to these ideals left Swedes and other ethnic groups free to follow their own culture and religion, resulting in hyphenated Americans. If this paradigm were transferred to Canada, Swedish immigrants came to a colony of Great Britain in which the political philosophy was “peace, order, and good government.” Most immigrants expected to conform to the language and customs of the English-speaking majority, but they were unprepared for the impact on their lives of official Anglo-conformity, and, later, the ethnic discrimination they experienced during the First World War. As a result they suppressed their Swedish identity and became Canadians of Swedish descent rather than the hyphenated variety.11 Anglo-conformity permeated every aspect of life during the first three waves of immigration. Schools played a crucial role in creating Canadians out of ethnic children. Geographer William Wonders explained: “From the viewpoint of culture there is, strictly speaking, very seldom any second Scandinavian generation.”12 Similarly Swedish author Gunnar Nilsson found that the second- and third-generation Swedes he met in Canada during the 1970s had only a rudimentary knowledge of the Swedish language. Blanck went on to study the Augustana Synod, the most influential institution among Swedish Americans. Until the 1890s this Lutheran synod encouraged immigrants to become good Americans, but after this time promoted a Swedish-American history in which the Vikings, the New Sweden colony on the Delaware, and cultural icons, such as the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and Civil War hero John Ericsson, figured prominently.13 These ideas spread to Canada through the synod, and resulted in three place names: Monitor and Lindbergh in Alberta, and Lindbergh Island in British Columbia. Monitor, named in 1913, commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the Civil War battle with the ship John Ericsson designed, and Lindbergh and Lindbergh Island honour Charles A. Lindbergh’s historic flight across the Atlantic in 1927.\n\n6\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nDespite the concentration of American Swedes in certain areas of Canada, I have been unable to find evidence that they showed more interest than other Swedes in Canada in the 300th anniversary of the establishment of New Sweden in 1938. In Washington the New Sweden Monument sculpted by Carl Milles was presented, with President Roosevelt and Prince Bertil as guest speakers. The delegation from Sweden included the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, cabinet ministers, church dignitaries, a select choir of seventy voices, and the Swedish Royal Horse Guards Band. Sweden even struck a Tercentenary Memorial coin to mark the occasion.14 In Canada Esse Ljungh of Winnipeg coordinated a very modest contribution as secretary of Canada’s Delaware Committee.15 In Port Arthur and Fort William (after 1970, Thunder Bay) a Scandinavian picnic was arranged, complete with speeches, races, and music, which, it was hoped, would become an annual event. However, the second annual picnic in 1939, held in honour of the royal visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, was the last.16 The Swedish Pioneer Centennial in 1948 commemorated the first Swedish immigrants to the American Midwest. Among the celebrations was a gathering of 18,000 people in Chicago Stadium to hear speeches by President Truman, Prince Bertil, and author Carl Sandburg. The high-profile centennial inspired the founding of the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society, which in 1983 changed its name to the Swedish-American Historical Society. The occasion excited little interest in Canada, except for ten entries to an essay contest sponsored by the Swedish American Line.17 Eva St Jean’s study of Swedish immigrants in British Columbia found that everyday life was more influential in shaping identity than the cultural baggage carried from home: “Swedish immigrants created a new world and culture that depended not only on strength of body and character, but also on the solidarity and welcome they found among kinsmen and among fellow workers of all nationalities.”18 Although her approach to assimilation is from a different perspective from those of other scholars, she leaves no doubt that Canadian identity overshadowed Swedish ethnicity. Per Rudling of the University of Alberta blamed the overpowering presence of the United States.19 Although the reasons differed, scholars agreed with Runblom’s generalization that Canada’s Swedes had a low ethnic consciousness. What caused this phenomenon? Perhaps it was the lack of a national organization. In his study of Winnipeg, Ljungmark pointed out how strong differences of opinion in religious, political, and temperance\n\nInvisibility Cloak\n\n7\n\nmatters weakened any positive impact that Swedes might have had as a group. The competition for members between Lutheran and Mission Covenant denominations split communities and families, the cause of temperance was even more divisive, and the socialist ideas immigrants began bringing from Sweden before the First World War resulted in deep schisms. The only national organizations, the elitist Svenska förbundet i Canada (Swedish Canadian League) founded in 1917 and its grassroots successor of the same name, were both short-lived. Another possibility is the relative dearth of scholarly studies, caused in part by a lack of reliable statistics for the first and second waves of immigrants. The official designation “Scandinavian” lumped Swedes together with Norwegians in the Canadian census from the very beginning. Although their political alliance ended in 1905 it was not until 1921 that statistics were collected for Swedish immigrants and their descendants. More recently, funding agencies geared research grants to Scandinavian projects rather than to individual Nordic groups, so that researchers added a token example to projects in order to conform to the “Scandinavian” requirement. Or perhaps Rudling is right. Perhaps Canada’s Swedes were so heavily influenced by the culture and settlers emanating from the United States that they became overwhelmed by all that its much larger Swedish population represented. Prime Minister Trudeau described Canada’s relationship with its only neighbour as being “a mouse in bed with an elephant.” According to 2008 statistics Canada’s total population came close to 11 per cent of that of the United States. About 1.1 per cent of these 33,212,696 Canadians were of Swedish heritage, whereas the proportion in the United States was higher at 1.6 per cent in a population of 303,824,640. Up to 1.25 million emigrants left Sweden up to 1930,20 the period of heaviest emigration. A million or more are estimated to have migrated to the United States and 100,000 to Canada. Without a person-by-person analysis these numbers remain arbitrary. However, it is clear that Swedes in the United States have always vastly outnumbered those in Canada. During the 1850s and 1860s almost 47,000 Scandinavians had poured into the United States through the St Lawrence River corridor.21 By 1873 thousands of Swedes had passed through eastern Canada, but only 257 individuals are known to have remained as settlers, and they were quickly absorbed. When the government began its campaign to populate the Prairies, immigrants from Europe were steered westward to Winnipeg, bypassing eastern Canada.\n\n8\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nCanada was officially a colony until 1926, when the Imperial Conference gave it equal status with Great Britain, and only that year began appointing representatives abroad with full diplomatic status. Sweden began appointing trade representatives to Canada in the 1920s or a little earlier, so that the two countries had little opportunity to build a relationship until the fourth wave of immigration after the Second World War. It is significant that Canada appointed its first diplomatic representative abroad to the United States. The decision of the United States to name its country, its citizens, and its language after two continents has been termed “linguistic imperialism,”22 and with good reason. The confusion has contributed to rendering Canada invisible – not just Swedes – through the labelling of both countries as the single entity of “America.” Canada has since come into its own, but annoying hold-overs from the past continue to occur.23 In 1971 Consul Rudolph Zoumer of Calgary wrote a polite letter about the Swedish word “Amerika” to the bilingual magazine Bryggan/The Bridge, published by the Emigrant Register in Karlstad, Sweden: “There are the United States of America and there is Latin America, but for us here there is, above all, a country called Canada. Swedish achievements in Canada and especially in the western provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia are unknown. [Also] they have, as far as I know, no awareness of the emigrant research being done in Sweden.”24 He called for articles that Canadians would be interested in, and noted that the publication did not list the cost of a subscription to Canada, only to the United States. Recently Bryggan/The Bridge has published several of Alf Brorson’s articles about Canada, but in May 2009 the magazine’s name changed to Sweden and America, and the Emigrant Register’s new building became the Swedish American Center. The new names suggest that Canadian subscribers and clients are not welcome, since \"Swedish American” refers only to residents of the United States. To include Canada, the appropriate terminology would be “Swedish North American.” In 2013 the name was changed to the Swedish Migration Center, more accurately reflecting emigration from and immigration to Sweden. No pastor from the Augustana Synod was willing to establish residency until 1892 because of negative stories about Canada, its weather and its wildlife, spread by shipping agents and other officials stationed in Sweden. The legacy of these commercial strategies lingers on; for example, in the joke about summer tourists coming to Canada for a skiing holiday, and in American weather reports warning of a cold front coming down from Canada. The concept of an international boundary\n\nInvisibility Cloak\n\n9\n\nseparating the United States from the frozen North has been ingrained into the American subconscious. But perhaps Swedish humility is partly to blame. The quality of humility had been reinforced throughout Scandinavia for centuries as a form of social control in tightly knit rural communities. The Danish author Aksel Sandemose called it “Jante’s Law” in his 1933 novel A Fugitive Crosses his Tracks. The book details life in the small Danish town of Jante, where nobody wanted to be at a higher social or financial level than his neighbour. Those who broke this social code could expect retribution through a form of “shunning.” Although Jante’s Law has never been codified, it is accepted as a reality in the Nordic countries. In his book The Swedish Mentality Åke Daun credits Jante’s Law for outward shyness and humility: “Personal worth is gained not least as a reward for being [able, skillful], industrious, hard-working, but one is admonished not to forget that 'pride goes before a fall' ... [and reminded] that 'you have nothing to be proud of.'”25 Swedes were expected to be capable and to work hard. If one happened to rise above the rest, his/her success was due to luck in one form or another. A proper response to congratulations for an accomplishment would be “It was nothing,” or “I was lucky.” The American humorist Josh Billings wrote, “It is a great art to be superior to others without letting them know it.” For Swedes, it came as second nature. When I asked artist Clarence Tillenius why his name was not on the plaque beside his spectacular diorama of a buffalo stampede at Winnipeg’s Manitoba Museum,26 he explained that many other people had taken part, not just him. Similarly the contribution of Swedes to the unique built heritage at Riding Mountain National Park seems to be a well-kept secret. And although most Canadians know the hymn “How Great Thou Art” few realize that the lyrics were composed in Sweden by Carl Gustav Boberg in 1885 and set to a Swedish folk melody.27 Another popular tune for skaters, “Life in the Finland Woods,” was composed by Sweden’s famous accordionist, Carl Jularbo.28 The title commemorates the Forest Finns who migrated to the Swedish province of Värmland in the 1600s. Another example is smörgåsbord. Although the word is included in Canadian dictionaries,29 meaning “a buffet meal featuring a large variety of meats, salads, etc.,” it is difficult to find a Swedish smörgåsbord in any Canadian restaurant. Meanwhile, other ethnic groups routinely refer to their buffet fundraisers as \"smorgs,\" even though the menu might be Polish or Ukrainian.\n\n10\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nStill another example is the disappearance of trolls from the Canadian mindscape. \"[During the 1920s] Dad and Mom would tell us stories in the evenings. Dad always told us about the little elves in Sweden ... [Granny] too always spoke about the little men in Sweden. If someone had a woodpile to move the little men (elves) would move it overnight!\"30 In Sweden the popularity of trolls never seems to wane. Examples are Jenny Nyström’s Christmas illustrations and the 1991 reprint of the illustrated book John Bauers sagovärld. No doubt, the Swedish-American commercial artist Haddon Sundblom was quite familiar with them, too. Our modern version of Santa Claus derived from his annual paintings from 1931 to 1986 advertising Coca-Cola. Canadian scholar David Delafenêtre examined the dual behaviours of public assimilation and private ethnicity in a 1995 article titled “The Scandinavian Presence in Canada.” He suggested that Nordic immigrants assimilated voluntarily: These immigrants expected that the Old World would have to be left behind and that the primary identification would be with Canada ... Furthermore, immigrants would take part in a fusion that would lead to the consolidation of a new North American culture. It was to be distinctly Canadian and the adoption of English was not regarded to be a step towards Anglo-conformity. The first generation tried to retain what they deemed worthy to blend with the existing Canadian culture. At the same time, they adopted what was considered positive among the host country’s ways. One of the main features of the Scandinavian adaptive process was that the homeland traditions which were selected would become part of the Canadian setting.31\n\nDelafenêtre named the values transmitted to the Canadian mainstream as skiing and building homes for the elderly, to which can be added the Swedish smörgåsbord. He further claimed that the ready assimilation of Nordic immigrants was a success story, and that multiculturalism discouraged scholarly research of these groups. Instead, attention was directed towards visible minorities because their experience supported the separateness inherent in the multicultural policy. At the same time the generalization of low ethnic consciousness cannot be applied to all of Canada’s Swedes. Arthur A. Anderson of Winnipeg was visibly upset when back issues of the newspaper Canada posten were destroyed by fire after the office closed in 1952. “Fifty years of\n\nInvisibility Cloak\n\n11\n\nwork went up in smoke,” he raged, and then stated resolutely, “We must get an archives.”32 Yet, even with his connections as a leading businessman and Swedish consul, no arrangements were made to preserve Swedish documents. Instead, they are scattered in private collections, archives, and ethnic institutions across the country, and even outside the country in repositories such as Sweden’s national archives and Vasa Archives in Bishop Hill, Illinois. Fortunately a set of Canada posten survived at Winnipeg’s Legislative Library, and has been microfilmed.33 In 1973 Erik Kjellberg of Stockholm tried to interest Canadian individuals, organizations, and governments in funding a study of Swedish people in Canada. His first letter of inquiry was addressed to collector Olof Seaholm of Vancouver: “I feel that Canada, in this respect as in so many others, has been overshadowed by its big brother in the south. When Swedes discuss, write or read about Swedish people in North America, it is nearly always the Swedes in the U.S. I would like to try to inform the Swedish public more about the Canadians of Swedish descent.”34 Kjellberg lived in Canada from 1975 to 1986, during which time he earned his master's degree at McMaster University, and McClelland and Stewart published several ethnic histories in its Generations series. Unfortunately, like Arthur A. Anderson’s hope for an archives, his dream failed to materialize. He returned to Sweden with his Canadian wife and family.35 Irene Howard recognized the importance of research material when she decided to write about Swedes in Vancouver. She was inspired by two significant collections at the University of British Columbia Library. The first was the Matthew Lindfors Fonds,36 and the second was the Olof Seaholm Collection. During the 1960s Seaholm37 had received a federal New Horizons grant of $2,000 to write a history about Swedish immigrants, and began by collecting research material. The book never materialized, but his collection takes up more than a metre of shelf space and includes a subject index to articles in Nya svenska pressen from 1933 to 1970. After publication of Vancouver’s Svenskar in 1970 Howard donated her research material38 to the same repository. Olof Seaholm was a first-generation Swede, and Irene Howard’s parents came from Sweden and Norway. Admittedly Matthew Lindfors was an exception who made a career of promoting Swedish culture, but both Seaholm and Howard had mainstream careers and Anglo-Saxon spouses. Similarly, of the research materials donated to the Swedes in Canada project by hundreds of individuals, most were family histories\n\n12\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nand memoirs featuring their Swedish heritage. Perhaps Delafenêtre was right about individuals keeping their ethnic feelings to themselves while giving the impression of complete assimilation. In this case the impression of a low ethnic profile was inevitable. I first became aware of the scattered nature of Swedish documents during research for my dissertation, an annotated bibliography published in 1991 as The Swedish Experience in Canada.39 Official sources turned up 162 published articles and books in the English language, but only a handful were written by Canadian authors. The possibility of a published history seemed remote. \"Clearly Canadian scholarship stands in a disadvantaged position. No university or discipline specializes in Swedish studies after almost two decades of official multiculturalism. And no single repository has a mandate to collect either published works, documents, or artifacts reflecting the Swedish experience in Canada.\"40 Don Sjoberg of Winnipeg, who read my dissertation during a visit to Sweden, was unwilling to accept my gloomy prediction. One evening he phoned, a stranger to me, and asked if I would consider writing such a history if he raised funding for it. I agreed, and the Swedes in Canada project was launched in 2001 with the Lakehead Social History Institute as sponsor. The research material that surfaced filled 12.5 metres of shelf space, a veritable mountain compared to the less than half a metre garnered for my dissertation. It included Swedish language materials, unpublished works, photocopies from general histories, photographs, various media, and new publications. This treasure trove had existed all the time; it needed only to be gathered together to provide the building blocks for writing a comprehensive history. Issues addressed include the reasons immigrants left Sweden and what enticed them to choose Canada over other destinations, how they managed to learn English without the benefit of organized classes, and the impact they and their descendants have had on our country’s development. Basic questions, such as the number of immigrants who came and where they settled, are discussed, along with religious, political, and cultural affiliations, and relationships with immigrants from other countries, including England. Also explored are Swedish contributions to both world wars, the people behind their newspapers, and an unexpected literary genre. High-profile Canadians who made light of their Swedish heritage include Pamela Wallin,41 appointed to the Senate in 2008 after a\n\nInvisibility Cloak\n\n13\n\nsuccessful career as broadcaster and diplomat, and Ralph Gustafson,42 recognized as one of Canada’s finest poets. While it is true that the Swedish heritages of only a few people are well known, it is also true that a great many have made significant contributions at the grassroots level. The casual observer might see the men as hewers of wood and carriers of water,43 but closer inspection would reveal inquisitive minds and strongly held opinions beneath an exterior that might seem stern and uncommunicative at first. An example is the group of nameless Swedish fallers who risked losing their jobs by giving union organizers safe entry into British Columbia’s logging camps during the Depression.44 A common trait of Swedes on both sides of the Atlantic was helping others less fortunate, such as establishing the Scandinavian Hospital in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, and the Scandinavian Home Society in Port Arthur, Ontario. The lives of Frank Eliasson and Emil Berg, who championed the co-operative and labour movements, respectively, exemplify this trait on an individual basis. The same strict moral code based on fairness can be discerned in the politics of Rolf Bruhn, and, more recently, by Sweden's returning its Haisla totem pole to British Columbia. The above overview of possible reasons for the long delay in publishing a history of Swedes in Canada has left out a key factor: lack of opportunity. In the United States a relatively small group of individuals, usually connected with a university, have been responsible for recording the nation’s Swedish-American history from documents held in their own archives and libraries as well as Sweden’s. None of these exist in Canada. Instead, the Swedes in Canada project was conceived and carried out by Canadians with a relatively high degree of ethnic consciousness, and financed by Swedish individuals and organizations with similar feelings. After the project is completed the research material will be donated to a Canadian repository to ensure that future researchers have the necessary resources at hand to continue raising the profile of Canada’s “invisible” Swedes.\n\nChapter Two\n\nEmigration from Sweden, Immigration to Canada\n\nIn 1860 the population of Sweden was 3,859,728, and by 1914 the population had swelled by almost two million to 5,679,607. Population growth continued up to 1930, by which time more than 1.25 million citizens had emigrated. Calculating an accurate percentage of the total population is therefore impossible because their numbers kept growing despite emigration. Most came to North America, but others ended up in such diverse places as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, England, Germany, Ghana, Mongolia, New Zealand, St Petersburg (later Leningrad), South Africa, and Saint Barthélemy in the West Indies. It is estimated that about 100,000 Swedes immigrated to Canada, and more than a quarter of a million Canadians (282, 760 persons) claimed Swedish descent in the 2001 census. What made them leave? At the beginning of emigration, the main reason was the lack of hope for breaking the cycle of poverty that affected many families. Later came labour unrest, when participants were blacklisted and unable to find work. Other push factors included Sweden’s compulsory military duty for young men, degrading class distinctions, restrictions on the right to vote, the lack of a democratic spirit, the dominant position of the church,1 and personal reasons, such as escaping from a debt or an unhappy marriage. Most Swedes came to the New World with the hope of improving their lot, prodded by stories of successful immigrants and stock phrases that suggested the streets were lined with gold waiting to be scraped off with a knife. They were more likely to believe tried-and-true homilies embroidered and hanging on their walls, such as “Easy come, easy go” and “All that glitters is not gold.” But there was also the saying that “Even a blind hen can find a kernel of grain now and then,” and it was\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n15\n\nthis slim hope that drove many people to leave their homes and loved ones.2 Individuals who emigrated were said to have 'America fever' or the 'wanderlust,' suggesting that forces beyond their control were at work. What attracted them to Canada? Beginning in 1884 the Canadian government embarked on a campaign for Swedish immigrants, with free land and ready employment as the most popular drawing cards. Immigration agents were appointed, and brochures and other promotional material were sent to Sweden and distributed by shipping agents. Ships brought immigrants to England to board ocean liners crossing the Atlantic, and immigrant agents met the boats at Halifax, Montreal, and Quebec City to guide travellers to trains for the last leg of their journey westward. But the most important pull factor by far was satisfied immigrants visiting Sweden and writing letters, encouraging friends and relatives to join them. Immigrant Database From its research material the Swedes in Canada project compiled a database of 6,164 immigrants up to 1979, a little more than 6 per cent of the estimated 100,000 newcomers.3 Since this percentage qualifies as a reliable statistical indicator, the following numbers can be considered reasonably indicative of the population as a whole. Of the total number of 6,164 immigrants, 56 per cent were males and 23 per cent females, with 21 per cent children, confirming the patterns of family orientation and gender imbalance. Those born in Sweden numbered 5,834, with 330 persons born in other countries. Of the 95 per cent born in Sweden, only 67 per cent specified their province of birth. Of these, 45 per cent came from northern Sweden,4 36 per cent from southern Sweden,5 and 19 per cent from middle Sweden,6 with all twenty-five provinces represented. Royal Commission on Emigration Emigration had become politically important by 1907, when the Swedish parliament appointed a Royal Commission (Emigrationsutredningen) to carry out an historical-statistical study. The reasons given for this surge of patriotic fervour among the ruling classes were the twin blows of losing not only its citizens through emigration, but also Norway.7 However, the official view of the Swedish government was “the combination of the persistent population drain and the continuing\n\n16\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\ndiscontent in society ... [which] threatened Sweden’s self-respect and, some thought, its very existence.”8 As part of the study, more than 300 men and women were interviewed that summer at Hull, England, of which 14 were bound for Canada.9 Another part of the study printed brief biographies written by immigrants already living in North America. Of the 119 letters received, 15 came from Canada. The letters were not without criticism of their adopted country, including the weather. One of them described working on railway construction in the mid-1880s: “People from Skåne [Sweden’s southernmost province] never dreamt of such cold as I experienced beside Lake Superior. My face froze solid before I knew it. We had to sleep in tents, and our knives froze to our lips when we ate.”10 Another suggested that Canadian homes would be warmer if wood was burned in Sweden’s more efficient tiled stoves (kakelugnar),11 in which hot smoke travelled up and down a series of vertical passages to provide a gentle heat through the masonry. The Royal Commission also compiled statistics to show the amount of money transferred from 1899 to 1907 from the United States to Sweden through postal money orders. The figure amounted to 95 million kronor ($24,700,000), whereas 16 million kronor ($4,160,000) had flowed in the opposite direction. The money received in Sweden through postal money orders from 1886 to 1906 was triple the value of Swedish exports to the United States during the same period.12 Obviously emigration was having a positive impact on Sweden’s economy. The Royal Commission did little to check emigration. The last of its twenty-one volumes was published in 1913, the year before the First World War began. Far more effective was the National Society against Emigration (Nationalföreningen mot emigrationen), founded in 1907. Through its agencies for home loans and land acquisitions, and its lobbying for social and economic changes, Sweden became a more attractive place to live. Lectures and publications with photographs, statistics, and factual accounts of life in North America enabled Swedes to become more aware of what they would experience if they emigrated.13 Adrian Molin spearheaded the promotion of the Own-Home movement and wrote pamphlets and books as a counterbalance to the extravagant claims of emigration agents, shipping lines, and “Yankees” home on a visit. One of his books dealt with Canada,14 specifically Wetaskiwin and Sedgwick in Alberta, and Fleming and Young in Saskatchewan. When asked which they would rather have, 160 acres (64.7 hectares)\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n17\n\nof free land in Canada or a much smaller farm on credit in Sweden, farmers answered with the question, “Who in Sweden wants to give a worker, who owns nothing, that amount of land on credit?”15 The implication was that they would rather have stayed in Sweden, and that lack of opportunity was a major push factor. Push Factors There were many reasons why they left,16 but the main ones were economic. When large-scale emigration began in the 1860s, Sweden was a poor country, in which 90 per cent of the population earned its livelihood from agriculture. Pauperization of the countryside reached its peak during this decade, ending with two consecutive years of famine. Many of those who emigrated were living with poverty and hunger.17 At least 257 of them ended up in eastern Canada,18 scattered among immigrants from Great Britain, the provinces’ primary target group. Their names were plucked from among those listed as Scandinavians in the censuses of 1851, 1861, and 1871 by Sten Aminoff, consul general of Sweden in Ottawa from 1972 to 1974.19 Aminoff’s compilation reveals, through the nationality of their children, that Swedes began trickling in much earlier than once thought. For example, Catherine Wood (her married name) was born in Ontario ca. 1798, and Thomas Johnsen in Quebec ca. 1809.20 In some ways these 257 Swedes were a microcosm of those who would follow. First, men were in the majority, at 162 persons, with only 45 women and 50 children, and, second, they were widely dispersed. One hundred thirty-four of them lived along transportation routes in Ontario, with eighty-six in Quebec, eighteen in New Brunswick, thirteen in Nova Scotia, and six in Newfoundland.21 Swedes were clearly in the minority among the 1,623 Scandinavians listed in the 1871 census; that is, those born in Denmark, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden, and their descendants.22 Scattered settlement and marriage into other traditions resulted in rapid assimilation so that the language, food, and customs did not survive more than a generation or two. Poverty in Sweden would continue to be a significant push factor. Another reason Swedes emigrated was labour unrest. When the pace of industrialization increased in the 1870s, industries moved to the towns, providing jobs for displaced rural residents, both male and female. Sweden’s first major strike, which took place in 1879 in the sawmill district near Sundsvall on the Baltic coast, resulted in 1,000 workers\n\n18\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\ndispossessed and their leaders imprisoned.23 However, continuing unrest throughout the country, including the Norberg Strike of 1891–2 and, above all, the Great Strike of 1909, which involved 300,000 workers,24 eventually led to major economic and social changes. They also encouraged, and sometimes forced, emigration as the only alternative. August Palm introduced socialism to Sweden in 1881.25 Five years later the Stockholm newspaper Socialdemokraten (The Social Democrat) was founded; in 1889 the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party; and in 1898 the Swedish Federation of Trade Unions (Landsorganisationen).26 It was these political ideas that caused a schism in Canada between immigrants with a conservative farm background and those who had worked in industry. An example is the Swedish Construction Association, founded by Winnipeg’s 'old guard' to build a hall for social gatherings. The 300 workers who attended a 1912 meeting overturned the original idea in favour of a meeting place for workers’ organizations. Before the evening ended a new society had been formed, the Scandinavian People’s Hall. At the incorporation celebration the new society’s radical spirit was emphasized by the singing of “Sons of Labour” before dancing began. Unfortunately neither organization succeeded in building a hall. Similarly, the Swedish Liberal Club, founded by the old guard in 1908, never really got off the ground, and neither did the Scandinavian Liberal Society formed in 1913, although both had the unstinting support of Svenska Canada-tidningen. At the same time the Scandinavian Social Democratic Club was founded at Winnipeg's Scandinavian Temperance Café. The club held regular meetings and sponsored a lecture by Carl Bergström, formerly a journalist for the social democratic newspaper Jämtlands folkblad. Although Winnipeg’s weak labour movement allowed very few opportunities for Swedes to be heard in the political arena, the political split divided the Swedish community.27 The Swedes who settled in Kipling, Ontario, came from Sundsvall’s sawmill district during the decade from 1892 to 1902, as did many of C.O. Swanson’s Swedish maids. Similarly more than 200 people left neighbouring Hälsingland after the 1905 announcement that the German-owned sawmill in Ljusne would close. Fifty of them came to Haileybury and North Cobalt, Ontario, some because of silver finds at Cobalt and construction of the Ontario Northland Railway. An important part of Socialdemokraten’s mandate was to provide dependable information about North America’s labour market.28\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n19\n\nLars Jansson29 was one of the workers blacklisted in the iron mines of Malmberget and Kiruna in northern Sweden, before he came to Canada in 1905. As a labour leader during the 1890s and early 1900s he helped to found the union Gruv tolvan, which continues today.30 As a result one of the main streets in Kiruna is named Lars-Janssons-gatan in his honour. It is said that he knew the father of Swedish socialism, Hjalmar Branting, long-time editor of Socialdemokraten, president of the Social Democratic Labour Party, and, later, prime minister. Jansson and six other Swedes filed on homesteads in Magnolia, 130 kilometres west of Edmonton.31 His wife, Amanda, their four-year-old son Herbert, and Amanda’s grown daughter, Agnes, joined him the following spring. In 1911 the sale of his homestead to the Canadian Northern Railway32 allowed him to return to Sweden as an independent person. Agnes had married33 and remained in Magnolia. When she died in 1918 Amanda and Herbert came from Sweden to help care for her children.34 The first Swedish immigrants to Silverhill, east of Vancouver, had been blacklisted in northern Sweden after the Great Strike of 1909.35 Rönnqvist’s study of these mining districts showed a steep rise in emigration to Canada from 1909 until 1914. She also looked at the coastal areas, where agriculture and forest industries predominated, and was able to establish a direct link between the economic downturn that began in 1922 and the considerable emigration that followed until 1930. Until these dates neither agriculture nor forest areas were a significant source of immigrants to Canada.36 The Great Strike of 1909 also inspired emigration from southern Sweden, including Albin Plym, who hid his identity for the transatlantic journey: “I boarded a ship in Esbjerg, Denmark. I got a false passport for two crowns from the emigrant agent in Denmark. Everything went as planned and after a couple of weeks I arrived in Montreal and spent the first night on the basement floor in the railway station.”37 Plym was horrified by the brutal behaviour and disregard for human life that he encountered as a labourer in Canada. He expressed his socialist ideas by saying that the nameless immigrants who built the railways, cultivated the soil, and opened roads to mines were the real heroes. It was they who opened the safe, so to speak, from which the millionaires stole their riches. After nine years he returned to Sweden and wrote about his experiences. Another push factor was the threat of legal action. In 1923 Johan Ståhl38 had been sentenced to prison for his part in a labour demonstration in\n\n20\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nJämtland. The family ended up on a homestead in Fosston, Saskatchewan. Johan’s wife, Maria, clothed and fed their eight children with difficulty, and things got worse as six more children came along. However, each child left home to work at the age of fourteen, and in this way contributed to the family’s support. Johan became a Jehovah’s Witness and moved to Prince George, British Columbia, in 1951. Axel Wallgren39 fled Sweden in 1890 rather than face charges of embezzlement. He changed his surname to Bruhn and became a farmer in Malakwa, near Revelstoke, British Columbia. He had been well respected as the royal sheriff (kronofogde) in charge of an administrative district in Bohuslän, where he lived in the official residence in Resteröd with his large family and several servants. After his departure the family was left homeless, penniless, and fatherless, with a cloud of shame hanging over their heads. Nevertheless, one of the sons, Åke Wallgren, became a famous opera singer. Another, Rolf Wallgren Bruhn, immigrated to Canada and became a millionaire. People seldom think of a learning disability as a reason for emigration, but it was dyslexia that drove Erik Giöbel40 to Canada in 1927. He received no help for his problem and failed to pass the entrance exam for high school, a necessity for his social class. His jobs as a poorly paid bush worker fulfilled neither his parents’ expectations nor his own. In Canada Erik was bitterly disappointed to discover that his glowing letters of recommendation were worthless, even though he had spent a year in England learning the language. Once again he turned to bush work, and in 1941 moved from Kapuskasing, Ontario, to British Columbia, eventually landing a steady job in a sawmill in Fort Alberni. His dyslexia did not prevent him from writing to his sister Ingrid, and after his death she was surprised to receive a legacy of 38,000 kronor, more than $8,000.41 Erik’s lonely and frustrating years in Canada had earned him the self-respect that comes with having money in the bank. After the Second World War some residents left Sweden for political reasons. Nils Granevall42 brought his family to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1951 because he feared a Communist invasion of Sweden. He was a prime target as a former high-ranking Communist who turned against the party when the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and author of two books against Communism. The family settled in Victoria, earning a living through market gardening. Other political immigrants included some of the 9,000 Estonian Swedes who had sought refuge in Sweden when their country was overrun by the Soviet Union.\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n21\n\nPull Factors The most powerful pull factor was free land on the Prairies under the Dominion Lands Act of 1872, based on the American Homestead Act passed ten years earlier. The civil engineer Harald Fegræus43 was one of thirty surveyors working for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Lands Department in 1884. In August he wrote a letter home from Qu’Appelle in Saskatchewan: “We arrived here yesterday after an 8-day march and will break camp again tomorrow. This place is very beautiful for us, who haven’t seen a single green tree during the whole summer. It is a future town consisting at the moment of some 20 houses that are located in the middle of an aspen forest ... One can’t walk a thousand steps without finding buffalo skeletons, but there are no more living on these prairies ... It is sad to see the devastation that has taken place.”44 Systematic land surveys were a necessary prelude to transforming the open prairies into farmland. The 49th Parallel marking the international boundary became the first baseline for the Dominion Lands Survey System, which divided arable land into square townships of thirty-six sections, each measuring 259 hectares. A typical township would reserve eighteen sections for free homesteads and two for schools, with fourteen granted to the railway and two to the Hudson’s Bay Company.45 Title to a quarter-section or 64.75 hectares (in Swedish terms of the time, about 130 tunnland) could be had from the government for $10 plus settlement duties that included building a suitable residence and cultivating a specified area. Railway lands, on the other hand, were purchased outright at the going rate.46 In preparation for completion of the prairie section of the railway the federal government appointed immigration agents to advise immigrants where to settle. The immigration agent for Scandinavians was Emanuel Öhlén,47 a tall blond from Stockholm, who worked as assistant to the Dominion immigration agent in Winnipeg, W.C.B. Grahame. Öhlén's appointment in late 1884 marked the beginning of Scandinavian immigration to the Canadian Prairies. His official designation was “interpreter,” and his annual salary was $800.48 Öhlén returned from an official visit to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in 1886 with a bold plan of action. First, he requested a grant of land for Scandinavian settlement, the New Stockholm colony in present-day Saskatchewan. Then, he formed the Scandinavian National Society to sponsor a brochure,49 with Prime Minister John A. Macdonald as patron, W.C.B. Grahame as first honorary member, and himself as president.\n\n22\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nLeading Swedes, including the Winnipeg pioneer M.P. Peterson,50 numbered among the executive, and immigration agents in Ottawa, Quebec, Halifax, and Göteborg were listed as honorary members.51 Ten thousand copies of the resulting twenty-page brochure were distributed in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the United States.52 It promoted the Canadian Prairies by prominently displaying the society’s emblem and Macdonald’s name. Not only was Canada larger than the United States, but it also had the longest railway in the world. As for climate, Manitoba’s southern boundary was on the same parallel as Paris and southern Germany. In addition to practical details, such as a township sketch with its thirty-six sections showing free land, the brochure focused on the colony of New Stockholm in today’s Saskatchewan. While he was in Sweden Öhlén had printed a smaller brochure about the colony,53 complete with a map showing the nearest railway. He had a personal interest because he and M.P. Peterson had chosen the location the previous September 1885, and he had named it after the capital city of Sweden. When Öhlén sent Nils Johanson,54 who worked at the experimental farm in Selkirk, Manitoba, to confirm its fertility, he responded by filing on a homestead. The colony, located twenty-one kilometres north of Whitewood on the CPR, consisted of four adjoining townships and offered 160 acres (64.7 hectares) of land to every person, male or female, over eighteen years of age. In June 1886 Öhlén accompanied the first group of immigrants to New Stockholm,55 which was then empty prairie and wooded hills. One of his most successful strategies was to send a satisfied immigrant back home, at government expense, in order to attract others, just as he had done himself in 1886. These “return men” always brought friends and relatives, and sometimes strangers, back with them in what is called “chain migration.” Known return men were M.P. Peterson and Andrew Hallonquist of Winnipeg in 1887, and, from New Stockholm, Zakris Bergman56 in 1888, and Nils Johanson and Mr von Holstein-Rathlow, a Dane, in 1893. In six short years Öhlén had set the wheels in motion for Scandinavian immigration to the Canadian Prairies. He initiated the Swedish colony57 in New Stockholm, promoted it through a well-distributed brochure and “return men,” and oversaw its development. He founded the first Scandinavian newspaper, Den skandinaviske canadiensaren (The Scandinavian Canadian), which the Canadian government distributed in the Old Country and the United States as a monthly “immigrant brochure.” When Öhlén resigned in 1890 Winnipeg had become not\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n23\n\nonly a destination, but also an information centre for those venturing further west. Just as Öhlén sought immigrants from the Old Country, so the mission field of C.O. Swanson58 was the United States. An 1871 immigrant to Waterville, Quebec,59 Swanson was appointed Dominion immigration agent in 1892. That year the CPR completed a railway from Calgary to Strathcona, now part of Edmonton, and homesteads were opened southeast of Siding 16, the early name for Wetaskiwin. Swanson advertised Alberta’s free homestead land through personal visits along the Atlantic seaboard, supplementing his powers of persuasion with kits of print information and free guided tours. The quest for farmers from the American Midwest, not necessarily Swedes, had already begun. In 1892 a typical poster in Aberdeen, South Dakota, boasted in large print: “Seeing is believing – Products of Alberta – Grains, Grasses, Roots Grown on Free Homestead land where you can get 160 acres free. The richest soil on earth. Healthiest climate in the world. No taxes except school taxes. No McKinly [sic] Bill.”60 By the turn of the century Canada was budgeting up to a million dollars each year to maintain recruiting offices in sixteen American cities, distribute literature, and pay agents a commission of $3 per farmer.61 In 1895 Swanson’s duties increased to cover the entire United States. He continued his earlier method of personal visits throughout the Midwest and also advertised in Scandinavian newspapers in Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis. These tactics got results, judging from 1899 statistics, which showed that 473 of the 764 Scandinavian immigrants that year came from the United States. In 1904–5 he guided ten tours from St Paul, also recommending the new Canadian Northern Railway, which dipped into Minnesota south of Lake of the Woods before continuing on to Winnipeg. Railway access was important. Most migrants brought with them at least one railway car loaded with effects, animals, and equipment.62 Swanson felt a growing commitment to the Westaskiwin area. He had a house built, and in 1900 his wife and children moved to Alberta to join him.63 By 1905 his monthly tours from St Paul, Minnesota, had become weekly events,64 causing him to remark that his home was in Wetaskiwin, but his office was in St Paul. A landmark near his home came to be called Swanson’s Corner,65 suggesting that his home also served as an office. Swanson’s death in 1906 marked the end of federal promotion in the United States for the Wetaskiwin area. In 1894 Swanson had initiated a scheme with the federal government to encourage young women to emigrate as domestic help in private\n\n24\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nhomes. His sister, Christina Swanson of Waterville, assisted and after his death carried on alone. The heyday of the popular Swedish maid66 gave unattached women an unprecedented opportunity to emigrate on their own. Jobs were guaranteed on arrival, so that they could start paying back the cost of the ticket right away. However, some girls took advantage of the system and left for the United States, leading to the scheme’s abandonment in 1909.67 In 1898 a group of twenty-three Swedish maids from the Waterville area wrote a promotional letter, no doubt at Swanson’s request, published in Winnipeg’s Swedish newspaper under the headline “What the Girls Say about Canada”: “Mr. Swanson did not get a commission on our tickets, we got them for the same price as if we had paid cash. We earned six crowns [$1.56] a week for the first six months, and after learning English ten crowns [$2.60] more or less, depending on circumstances ... You don’t have to worry that they are slave tickets, as many told us when we left. One more thing we want to point out, and that is that Mr. Swanson solemnly swears to you that you can depend on being well taken care of. He has helped more than 192 girls to emigrate from Sweden and Norway over the past four years.”68 Addresses were given for the twentythree girls and also C.O. Swanson’s government address in Ottawa. Christina Swanson made at least three trips to Sweden to bring girls back to Canada.69 Others came on their own with tickets provided by the Dominion Line to the ports of Quebec, Halifax, or Portland, Maine, where Christina met them. The federal government paid her $4 for each girl who stayed in Canada. In 1907 the Canadian Magazine of Toronto published the article “Swede Girls for Canadian Homes: A Class of Imported ‘Canadians’ Whose Presence Is Regarded in This Instance as Mutually Beneficial.”70 The article’s condescending tone, with dialogues in pidgin English, tells a great deal about the attitudes Swedish maids met in urban Anglo-Saxon homes. Signe Olson71 worked from 1911 to 1918 in Port Arthur, Ontario, for the widow of a former mayor. The two women lived alone in an impressive, three-storey, brick house with a circular, bell-topped tower and multiplicity of windows.72 Signe’s thoughts worked best on Monday mornings, doing laundry in the basement, and she admitted stealing time now and then to write them down.73 One of her poems, “The Letter Started On,” reflects the immigrant experience, probably her own: Her road was the coldest she had ever known, Barren and empty was the world she saw,\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n25\n\nFor all her trials she had to bear alone, There was no place where comfort she could draw. When at last she reached the goal that she had set, And had done her best then it was she heard, What many poor people in their lives have met, They would be repaid with but a cruel word.74\n\nThose who worked for widowers with small children were more appreciated. Another pull factor was the abundance of jobs. Immigrants from Långasjö, Småland, in southern Sweden, had their own version of “return men.” Of the 364 persons who immigrated to Canada from 1882 to 1930, more than 100 were migrant workers who returned to Sweden with savings earned as section foremen or labourers on the spiderweb of railway lines between Vancouver and Field in southeastern British Columbia.75 Friends and relatives already in Canada sent money or prepaid tickets, to be repaid. The cost of a steerage ticket ranged from $54 to $70 (206 to 263 kronor).76 The CPR roadmasters, quite often Swedish, did the hiring.77 Eighteen per cent of the men returned to Sweden and bought a farm with the money they had saved from a starting wage of fifteen cents an hour. Some came back to Canada temporarily to earn money to improve their farms or to pay debts, but they always returned home. A detailed analysis of 10 per cent of the returnees showed that “during their years in America they had, on the average, sent home 3,580 kronor [$947] each and upon their return brought home an average of 8,500 kronor [$2,249] apiece.”78 These amounts represented a considerable transfer of capital. Örkened in the neighbouring province of Skåne followed a similar pattern, and probably lost more residents to emigration than Långasjö did.79 The main industry, quarrying, had suffered crippling strikes in 1907, 1909, and 1912,80 and 121 adults emigrated to Canada from 1909 to 1929.81 Many of them, like Karl Bengtsson,82 ended up working along the Canadian National Railway’s (CNR) northern railway line between Sioux Lookout and Hearst, Ontario, to populate Canada’s longest Swedish community.83 An added incentive was a succession of roadmasters from Örkened, and some from over the border in Småland, who spoke the area’s distinctive “göinska” dialect.84 An earlier, smaller group had worked for the CPR between White River and Chapleau, Ontario,85 and they continued coming during the 1920s.86 Companies requiring specialized workers sometimes set up\n\n26\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nimmigration schemes. Workers were required to sign contracts for a specified period, during which time they paid back the cost of their transportation through wage deductions. Swedish authorities discouraged immigration schemes. In 1903 the Davison Lumber Company built a sawmill at the mouth of the Miramichi River, with O.W. Nordin from Sweden as manager. In September 1905 a New Brunswick government representative asked Mr Carrick, the British vice consul at Gävle in Sweden, to assist Nordin in hiring workers experienced in sawmill and woods operations. In all 114 men were hired. Subsequently the Swedish government successfully sued Carrick for having illegally acted as an emigration agent. This judgment was later overturned.87 Lewis Miller, an entrepreneur from Crief, Scotland, who had owned sawmills in northern Sweden, organized the only other documented immigration scheme. Believing his timber limits to be in jeopardy, in 1900 he transported the entire operation across the Atlantic. Scottish and Swedish employees, as well as the mill manager, a Norwegian named Hanson, signed three-year contracts in return for passage to Millertown in central Newfoundland. At least sixty workers came from northern Sweden, not all of them former employees.88 The setting for the new company town was ideal. The sawmills, jetties, booming grounds, and jack ladders were located at the south end of historic Red Indian Lake, a former Beothuk encampment.89 Lining the sandy point above the industrial complex were eighty two-room family cottages, with the Mary March River on the other side. But the Swedes were unhappy with their wages from the beginning. The $1.10 they earned each day had the purchasing power of only 30¢. Some left right away, but the majority stuck out their contracts.90 Among those who stayed was O.G. Johnson,91 who had married a Newfoundland girl. At work he introduced the use of snowshoes for horses hauling timber in the winter, evidently a custom in Jämtland. His career path followed that of Newfoundland’s pulp and paper industry, and he retired after many years as woods manager. Another reason that young men and women gave for coming to Canada was to seek adventure. John Hagglund92 chose Fort William as his destination in 1907 because of a book he had read about the fur trade. He did not become a trapper, as planned. Instead, a hospital stay allowed him time to take a correspondence course in architectural drawing and design. This knowledge led to the founding of Hagglund Lumber and Fuel in the mid-1920s. Coal sales sustained his company\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n27\n\nduring the Depression, and the building boom after the Second World War assured its survival during these years. Many immigrants came in family groups over a period of several years. This chain migration resulted from the first immigrants writing letters home, telling of local opportunities, and from personal visits. Those who returned to Sweden, either on a temporary or permanent basis, were called “Yankees” because of changes in their habits, talk, and clothing.93 Some Swedes viewed them with interest and others with jealousy, but most were ready to listen to their stories and consider emigrating themselves. Letters were eagerly awaited in Swedish homes, where photos of those who had emigrated were often prominently displayed. Märta Jansson, who was single when she immigrated to Newfoundland, made her letters home more interesting by writing them on birchbark.94 The letters of Gottfrid Larsson95 of St Mary’s, Ontario, were so eloquent that they formed a bridge across the ocean between his son and his father. Gottfrid announced the arrival of a second son: “Last Friday there arrived a fine little boy, who claims that you, Pappa, are his grandfather. Due to such circumstances we must of course let him stay ... Little Oskar does not think we should keep him but wishes we would send him back to the store, where he claims he came from. Anyway he is well and strong, has good lungs and knows how to use them when he is not sleeping. He has blue eyes, blond hair and weighs 8 English pounds. Laura is recovering.”96 Besides family matters, his garden, and his work, with his father Gottfrid discussed politics and the war as if they were in the same room together. Development of an Immigration Policy The earliest immigrants to western Canada did not have the benefit of immigration agents or other official assistance. The first Swede to live in Manitoba and the only known Swede to immigrate via Hudson Bay was Jacob Fahlstrom,97 who served a six-year apprenticeship in the Canadian fur trade from 1811 to 1817, its most volatile period. He had signed a five-year contract before boarding the Hudson’s Bay Company ship at Stornaway, but how he got from Sweden to the Outer Hebrides at age seventeen remains a mystery.98 After five years at York Factory his contract expired, just after the bloody incident at Seven Oaks in June\n\n28\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\n1816. He then hired on with the rival North West Company, leaving their employ at Sault Ste Marie99 to join the American Fur Company. Because he is recognized as Minnesota’s first Swedish resident, Prince Bertil of Sweden unveiled a plaque in his memory in downtown St Paul in 1948.100 Another unofficial point of entry was the British Columbia coast. Eric Anderson101 worked on a British sailing ship that anchored near present-day Vancouver in the summer of 1872. He decided to jump ship, walked up the Fraser Valley, and settled within the present city limits of Surrey. Today, the first log cabin he built stands beside Surrey Museum, preserved as an historic monument. The first point of entry to Winnipeg from the United States was the Red River. In 1874 M.P. Peterson travelled that route, and four years later his fiancée, Annie Nelson, arrived on the first train from St Paul.102 Before Confederation the eastern provinces of Quebec and Ontario (Lower and Upper Canada) had acted together to promote immigration, mostly from the British Isles and other Protestant countries but also from French Catholic districts in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Northern Europeans were preferred immigrants, next to those from Great Britain, because they were literate, Protestant, accustomed to a northern climate and constitutional monarchy, and similar in appearance to Canada’s existing Anglo-Saxon population. Ontario distributed brochures in English, French, German, and Norwegian, and placed agents in England, Germany, and Norway. Resident agents appointed in Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto, and Kingston helped direct incoming immigrants to the United States, and sometimes succeeded in redirecting them to Canadian destinations. Ontario’s previous experience and errors from earlier campaigns were a great help to the Canadian government after 1867 when the British North America Act came into effect with immigration as a joint provincial and federal responsibility.103 In 1873 the federal government appointed retired politician William McDougall104 as Special Agent for the Scandinavian Kingdoms, soon to be replaced by the Swedish-American Hans Mattson,105 who had achieved great success in encouraging Swedish immigration to Minnesota. Representatives of the Allan Line were appointed as emigration agents, working on commission. Canada’s goal was to encourage satisfied immigrants to attract friends and relatives through letters home. North Americans first became acquainted with Sweden on a large scale in 1851 when Jenny Lind, “The Swedish Nightingale,” toured the United States. She spent several weeks vacationing in Niagara Falls,\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n29\n\nOntario, and during this time Anna Jameson’s 1838 travel book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles inspired her trip by steamer to the Detroit River, as well as up the Thames. She also gave concerts at local hotels106 and in Toronto’s Lawrence Hall.107 Jenny Lind’s popularity helped to establish her countrymen as immigrants worth courting. Swedish-language brochures were printed and distributed, and articles and advertisements were published in the daily press and in Göteborg’s emigration weekly, Nya Verlden (The New World) but results were disappointing. When Hans Mattson finished his contract as agent at the end of 1875 he had to admit defeat. He was responsible for neither the agency's single success, the 1875 transplanting of Icelanders to Gimli, Manitoba, nor its most publicized failure, the importing in 1873 of Norwegian iron workers to Moisie, Quebec.108 One of the reasons for not making headway was the fierce competition for immigrants in all but Iceland. As for Sweden, most prospective emigrants had their sights already set on the American Midwest, where settlement had begun in the 1840s. To them the destination of hope was “Amerika,” and it was not until the 1880s that this term began to include Canada. It was Prime Minister John A. Macdonald who in 1881 revived official interest in Scandinavian immigrants. During a visit to Liverpool, home of Canada’s immigration agent John Dyke,109 the Scandinavians he met impressed him a great deal. He directed Dyke to travel to the Scandinavian kingdoms and report on the emigration situation there.110 Dyke’s survey showed the main problems to be “a great deal of hostility to everything Canadian” arising from competition issues, including the allegation that Canadian steamship lines were subsidized by the government.111 An example of negative propaganda was the map printed by an American steamship line in Norway, showing the St Lawrence River as frozen year-round, with the admonition that skates would be needed to reach the mainland. As a result Dyke introduced Manitoba as a northern part of the American Midwest rather than as a Canadian province, and agents of American and English lines, rather than Canadian lines, distributed his first brochure.112 In 1884 Dyke recommended Emanuel Öhlén as Canada’s first immigration agent for Scandinavians. With completion of the prairie section of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the federal government began its campaign to attract homesteaders. Immigrants from Europe were steered westward to Winnipeg, bypassing eastern Canada and the previous Swedish immigrants who had established residence there.\n\n30\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nGovernment Incentives Several organizations were founded ostensibly to help immigrants. In 1919, the non-profit Canadian Colonization Association (CCA) had been jointly formed by the federal government, the CPR, and the CNR as a subsidiary of the Department of Immigration and Colonization, with responsibility for recruiting immigrants and securing their placement. By 1923 the CPR was in charge with a head office in Calgary. The CCA founded the Swedish Colonization Board of Alberta in 1925, appointing Axel R. Mellander113 as colonization agent. Problems arose almost at once because the fares on Canadian Pacific steamships were much higher than on the Swedish-owned Swedish American Line.114 As a result the board had limited success and was discontinued in 1927.115 Much more effective was the department’s own aggressive campaign, begun in 1923 with distribution in Sweden of the Winnipeg newspaper Svenska Canada-tidningen. The same year the Swedish American Line initiated direct service between Göteborg and Halifax, and the following April established an Information Office in Winnipeg. The office would be a coordinating agency to help Scandinavian immigrants find work on the Prairies. In 1925 the government appointed as manager Albert Hermanson,116 a Swedish immigrant who had just completed two terms as Liberal representative for the provincial riding of Canora, Saskatchewan. In 1924 the number of Swedish immigrants soared from 948 to 3,536, the highest annual figure ever recorded. The reason was twofold: the federal campaign noted above, and an annual quota imposed by the United States. But even after 1927, when the quota was reduced from 9,000 to a little over 3,000, immigration to the United States rarely reached this plateau because conditions in Sweden had improved. Those who wanted to emigrate increasingly turned their attention to Canada.117 From 1921 to 1931 the Swedish-born population increased by 18,498 persons.118 In 1925 Ottawa and Washington jointly hosted the twenty-third interparliamentary conference. A participant from Sweden, Ivar Vennerström,119 made some interesting observations following a Canadian tour that fall: “The Swedish-Canadian Information Office [in Winnipeg] is meant to serve Swedish immigrants, but others too may get free information there. During its first working year [March to November 1925] it had arranged employment to 239 Swedes, 75 Norwegians, 14 Finns,\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n31\n\n8 Danes and 3 others. Most of them had immigrated with the Swedish America [sic] Line ... No other shipping line has such an information and contact service.”120 In December Albert Hermanson sailed to Sweden to promote immigration of farmers to Canada. His audience with government officials in Stockholm was one of the first, with coverage by Sweden’s leading newspapers.121 The following year the Canadian National Railway, a Crown corporation, which after the First World War brought together five financially troubled lines, opened an office in Göteborg (which is also called Gothenburg). In 1926 the office published an attractive book of seventy-two pages, including a pull-out map titled “Världens största transportsystem” (The World’s Largest Transportation System).122 Two years later the CPR published a similar brochure of fourteen pages, listing offices in Göteborg, Stockholm, and Malmö.123 A network of railway lines had been built throughout the Prairies to transport grain to terminal elevators in Port Arthur, Fort William, and Vancouver. Alas, with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 immigration ground to a halt and did not begin again until after the Second World War ended in 1945. Crossing the Atlantic In 1850, after England repealed her restrictive navigation laws, Norwegian sailing ships began to carry passengers to Quebec City for the equivalent of $8 each, returning to Europe with a cargo of Canadian timber. In eleven years, from 1854 to 1865, almost 47,000 immigrants from Norway, and some from Sweden, arrived in these ships on their way to the United States.124 They continued by steamboat to Hamilton, where the newly opened Great Western Railway offered transportation as far as Windsor for another $8.125 These immigrants could not afford the safer and much more comfortable American vessels cleared for ports along the Atlantic seaboard. Only 257 of the Swedes are recorded as remaining in Canada. Sweden opened its first Canadian consulate in Quebec City in 1850126 for the Norwegian timber trade. A temporary consul filled in until 1855, when King Oscar I appointed Alfred Falkenberg,127 who held the post for eighteen years. One of very few immigrants from high-ranking Swedish nobility, he was always addressed as Baron Falkenberg. Perhaps because of his rank, he received an invitation to the 1864 official dinner following the Quebec Conference, along with the consul general\n\n32\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nof France.128 The other guests were the politicians who hammered out the resolutions that led to the creation of Canada in 1867. Baron Falkenberg was responsible for handling breach-of-contract and similar matters concerning the timber trade rather than assisting destitute immigrants. Vice-consuls with English-sounding names were appointed to postings along the coastline, wherever river drives could bring logs from the interior to dockside. The first was Montreal, followed by Saguenay, then around the south shore and Nova Scotia to Saint John, New Brunswick. The capital cities of St John’s, Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, were also represented. By 1871 there were seventeen vice-consuls, all under Baron Falkenberg’s supervision. During his term of office he was decorated for his services by both Sweden and Norway.129 The break with Norway in 1905 led to the establishment of separate consular offices.130 The Swedish government dropped most of the early vice-consulates in the Maritimes and Quebec, leaving only seven.131 Also continued were those in Ottawa and Toronto in Ontario, Winnipeg in Manitoba, New Stockholm in Saskatchewan, Calgary in Alberta, Vancouver in British Columbia, and Dawson in Yukon Territory. The consular headquarters moved from Quebec City to Montreal in November 1906, with the promotion of Montreal’s vice-consul, Gustaf Erik Gylling, to consul. Two years later new coats of arms were issued to all consulates and vice-consulates.132 By 1870 steamships had replaced sailing vessels for the most part, and transporting immigrants to the New World had become a thriving and competitive business. So-called feeder lines brought passengers to Hull on England’s east coast, then they travelled by train to Liverpool. Those bound for Quebec City or Montreal boarded the transatlantic steamships of the Allan Line, Beaver Line, and Dominion Line. On the Anchor Line, steerage accommodation from Göteborg to New York cost about $39, second class cost $49, and first class cost $100. Other major lines between Liverpool and New York were the American Line, Cunard Line, Guion Line, Inman Line, National Line, and State Line. The Wilson Line came to dominate as a feeder line to England. The Norwegian American Steamship Company offered direct passage from Bergen to New York from 1871 to 1876.133 A very limited number of immigrants avoided commercial transportation altogether. Around 1887 James Akerstream134 and a chum crossed the Atlantic in a homemade boat, following the Viking route via Iceland and Greenland, then past Newfoundland and up the St Lawrence River\n\nEmigration, Immigration\n\n33\n\nto Montreal. Akerstream was knowledgeable about ships and sailing, having apprenticed as a patternmaker. He thought the ocean voyage would be a great adventure, and brought along a Swedish-English dictionary so that he could learn the language en route. Clifford Sifton’s vigorous immigration policy from 1891 to 1905, while he was minister of the Department of the Interior, included a clandestine arrangement with the North Atlantic Trading Company in Amsterdam. An umbrella organization for European steamship lines, the company received a bonus of $3,571 from Ottawa,135 and distributed the Swedish version of Canada, the Land of Opportunity from offices in Stockholm and Göteborg. The Sundsvall area was singled out for special attention. For every farmer, farmhand, or domestic servant who emigrated, the company received an additional $5. By the time Sifton agreed to the scheme in 1899, all the European steamship companies were locked into a vast syndicate that fixed the cost of steerage tickets and directed Swedish passengers to their English steamship according to a quota system. Although this monopoly continued in some form until the Second World War, the Canadian government ended its involvement in 1906.136 Crossing the Atlantic had become a week-long pleasure trip by the 1920s, although some lines still crammed as many passengers as possible into their ships. The Swedish-owned Swedish American Line put comfort ahead of profit. Their fleet of ocean liners – Stockholm, Drottningholm, Gripsholm, Kungsholm – even hired physiotherapists to offer massage to passengers.137 Pier 21, which included an immigration shed, opened in Halifax in March 1928. Among its early clients was Erick Carlson, who emigrated with a buddy: “We got into Halifax on the 21st of April 1929 at 4 p.m. It was very late before we could get off the boat and it was dark. There was a Swedish man there. He gave out Swedish bibles to all the Swedes. I had that bible for many years and I had it out on the homestead. We were herded like livestock from the boat to the train. We left that evening by train for Winnipeg.”138 One million immigrants, half of them during the Second World War, passed through Pier 21 before it closed in 1971. By this time the great ocean liners had been replaced by air travel. The building is now a national historic site and houses Canada’s Immigration Museum.139 Immigration from Sweden had a slow start, mainly because Canada did not exist as a country until 1867 and official efforts to promote immigration were not successful until completion of the CPR in 1886, almost twenty years later. Whether immigrants wanted to farm or to work as\n\n34\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nlabourers, the most powerful magnet was personal contact with those already here. The grand sweep of the Prairies beckoned as farmland, and for the most part work was plentiful. Building a nation was labourintensive, and many hands were required to construct and maintain its transportation systems, to build and enlarge its cities and pioneer communities, and to extract and process its natural resources.\n\nChapter Three\n\nImmigrants\n\nIt could be argued that the first Swedes in Canada arrived at L’Anse aux Meadows with the Vikings in 1,000 A.D. National boundaries in the Nordic countries did not exist until several centuries later, and the exact location of Viking places of origin has not been determined. L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland is the only archaeologically verified site of Norse settlement in North America. Discovery by the Norwegian Helge Ingstad and excavations directed by his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, verified in 1968 that it was indeed a Norse settlement. That year L’Anse aux Meadows was named a National Historic Site by Parks Canada, and in 1978 UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Confirmation of the date, 1,000 A.D., and the circumstances under which L’Anse aux Meadows was constructed, proved once and for all that Norsemen had “discovered” North America five centuries before Christopher Columbus. Their short stays are the only documented Viking visits to North America.1 However, the great trans-Atlantic migration did not begin until the mid-1800s. Swedish immigrants to Canada arrived in an undulating flow of four major waves. The very first immigrant arrived in 1776 and newcomers remained a trickle until 1884, when the newly founded country appointed a Scandinavian immigration agent. The first wave continued until the turn of the century, the second lasted until the First World War in 1914, the third embraced the 1920s, and the fourth began after the Second World War. The first wave consisted mainly of couples with children and single men, the second added Swedish maids, and the third were mostly young men seeking work and adventure. Not until the 1950s was there a substantial number from the middle class, so that the fourth wave included refugees, transferred employees of\n\n36\n\nSwedes in Canada\n\nSwedish companies, and individuals seeking opportunities unavailable in Sweden. Most arrived directly from Sweden or via the United States, but a significant number came from Swedish-speaking districts in Finland, Estonia, and Ukraine. Early immigrants, both families and individuals, were mostly young and from poor families. They came from an agricultural tradition,2 and the Lutheran religion left them with more than their share of the Protestant work ethic. Almost all were literate, the women having experience as homemakers, and some of the men having experience as tradesmen and artisans.3 They settled wherever opportunities for jobs and land presented themselves. Timing was of the essence. Latecomers were left with marginal land. Learning English and paying back their boat ticket were priorities, but proximity to relatives and other Swedes was also important, especially at first. Immigrants were generally law-abiding and willing to please. Nevertheless, the existing urban population on the Prairies, mainly from Ontario and Great Britain, viewed them as intruders.
