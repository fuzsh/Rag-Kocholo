Bringing together the cross-disciplinary research of native scholars, Eastern European Popular Music in a Transnational Context expands our understanding of the movement of physical music, musicians and genres through the Iron Curtain and within the region of Eastern Europe. With case studies ranging from Goran Bregović, Czesław Niemen, the reception of Leonard Cohen in Poland, the Estonian punk scene to the Intervision Song Contest, the book discusses how the production and reception of popular music in the region has always been heavily influenced by international trends and how varied strategies allowed performers and fans to acquire cosmopolitan identities. Cross-disciplinary in nature, the investigations are informed by political, social and cultural history, reception studies, sociology and marketing and are largely based on archival research and interviews.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nPALGRAVE EUROPEAN FILM AND MEDIA STUDIES\n\nEastern European Popular Music in a Transnational Context Beyond the Borders Edited by Ewa Mazierska · Zsolt Győri\n\nPalgrave European Film and Media Studies Series Editors Ib Bondebjerg University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, Denmark Andrew Higson University of York York, UK Mette Hjort Hong Kong Baptist University Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nPalgrave European Film and Media Studies is dedicated to historical and contemporary studies of film and media in a European context and to the study of the role of film and media in European societies and cultures. The series invite research done in both humanities and social sciences and invite scholars working with the role of film and other media in relation to the development of a European society, culture and identity. Books in the series can deal with both media content and media genres, with national and transnational aspects of film and media policy, with the sociology of media as institutions and with audiences and reception, and the impact of film and media on everyday life, culture and society. The series encourage books working with European integration or themes cutting across nation states in Europe and books working with Europe in a more global perspective. The series especially invite publications with a comparative, European perspective based on research outside a traditional nation state perspective. In an era of increased European integration and globalization there is a need to move away from the single nation study focus and the single discipline study of Europe.

Bruno Nettl drew on this concept, underscoring the transnational quality of popular songs: ‘Some of them behave as if they had lives of their own, moving across national boundaries, rivers, mountain ranges, oceans, across language and culture areas’ (Nettl 2005: 113). Of course, this assertion is valid about music in general, but popular music is particularly adept at crossing national borders. This reflects the fact that the market for popular music is more global than that for classical music, which tends to be\n\nE.

GYORI\n\nprotected by and embedded in national institutions, such as orchestras, opera houses and music conservatoires. It is also more international than folk music, which ostensibly reflects local culture and rarely reveals any ambition to conquer the world. The transnational character of popular music is further strengthened by technological developments and changes in world politics. Cheap production, immediate and practically cost-free dissemination of music resulting from digitisation, as well as the availability of low-cost travel for musicians—assisted by the neoliberal policy of free movement of labour in some parts of the world—all facilitate the global flow of popular music. And, despite digital recording, social media, the piracy of records on the internet and, finally, the emergence of distribution platforms such as Spotify, live popular music has increased its share within the music industry and has made musicians ever more reliant on concerts, touring and festival appearances to sustain their income (Williamson and Cloonan 2007; Aspray 2008; Curien and Moreau 2009). In today’s world of weakened political and cultural borders, the popularity of performers and songs are measured by international visibility and integration into globally established styles and trends (Stokes 2012). However, research into popular music in Eastern Europe shows that its transnational character has been limited. First, it is usually acknowledged how Eastern European popular music borrowed from western pop-rock during the period of state socialism (Ryback 1990; Ramet 1994; Risch 2015), which is seen as an act of resistance against oppressive states; and secondly, exclusive mention of the crossing of national borders by certain genres born in Eastern Europe—namely those regarded as particularly exotic or oriental: ‘Gypsy’ and ‘Balkan’ (Silverman 2012)—which are of interest to non-mainstream western musicians and audiences. Furthermore, the influence of Anglo-American music on Eastern European popular music during the period of state socialism is discussed predominantly in political terms, as a force challenging ideological principles and culture, promoted by state institutions and, consequently, playing an important role in dismantling state socialism and introducing a new system: that of market capitalism and parliamentary democracy. It would be difficult to argue that Eastern European pop-rock has been immune to western influences or that the relationship between AngloAmerican and Eastern European pop-rock was symmetrical. For the majority of musicians operating behind the Iron Curtain, music from Britain and the United States constituted the dominant model. Almost every\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n3\n\npopular rock musician from countries such as Hungary, Poland or Yugoslavia started his or her career by covering songs of famous AngloAmerican artists and even when s/he did not, many of the local stars were hailed as local versions of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. On the other hand, it would be difficult to find a band from the United Kingdom or the United States, which marketed itself as an act whose ambition was to appeal to Eastern European audiences or which was inspired by music from Eastern Europe. In cases where this did happen, inspiration coming from the Soviet bloc was overlooked by audiences and critics. The most recent case in point is the spectacular international career of Dua Lipa, a singer born in London from Kosovo Albanian parents who quotes her musician father as an important influence, yet who is not seen as being in any way (musically or culturally) Albanian. This collection does not argue that there was ‘no West in the East’ or that popular music from Eastern Europe is more accomplished and influential than is normally assumed. Its aim is rather to investigate the complex phenomena that comprise the international dimensions of Eastern European popular music.\n\nMapping the Field The concept of the ‘international in Eastern European popular music’ is problematic on several accounts. First, there is a question of the boundaries of Eastern, as well as Western Europe. Even during the Cold War these terms were not straightforward, because between the (socialist) ‘East’ and the (capitalist) ‘West’ proper, there were countries which enjoyed having one foot in each camp, such as Finland and Yugoslavia. The politics of organizing the Eurovision and the Intervision Song Contests (ISC) reflects this non-binary approach to the East and the West, as discussed in the chapter by Dean Vuletic. Moreover, within specific political blocs there were also hierarchies, reflecting the political leanings and economic power of specific countries, as well as their music. For these reasons, again, Yugoslav, as well as Hungarian and Polish pop-rock has traditionally been valued more highly within the bloc than Romanian, Bulgarian and Albanian pop-rock, which was presumed to be less developed due to their more oppressive political regimes. Second, for consumers of popular music from Eastern Europe, music produced in the English-speaking countries was valued more highly than that coming from the rest of Western Europe; for example, Belgium and Austria. In this case attitudes reflected more the\n\n4\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\n‘global core-periphery’ dynamics pertaining to popular music at large (Azenha 2006; Stokes 2012) rather than a ‘West is best’ attitude, widespread in Eastern Europe. The above claims are well-illustrated by the emergence of special stores in the Soviet bloc countries, offering premium products. Under various names—Tuzex in Czechoslovakia, Pevex in Poland, Konsumex in Hungary, Intershops in East-Germany, and Corecom in Bulgaria—were ‘outposts of capitalism’ in state socialist countries where, amongst others, recordings of western music could be bought for hard currency. Another problem with defining Eastern Europe has to do with the status of Russia and its republics, which in some contexts is included in the investigations of Eastern Europe and in others is treated as a separate entity. For pragmatic reasons we decided to exclude Russia from our investigation, because its very size and specific relation to the rest of Eastern Europe would result in marginalizing many countries we would like to cover and add to the complexity of the investigation. We also omitted the majority of ex-Soviet republics, leaving only Estonia. Timothy Ryback described Estonia as the ‘California coast of the Soviet Union’ (Ryback 1990: 111) and which, in the words of Aimar Ventsel, author of a chapter in this collection, in the mind of many visitors functions as a frontier, dividing and connecting the current ‘wild East’, epitomised by Russia with the allegedly more democratic, gentler ex-Eastern Europe. For some researchers the term ‘Eastern Europe’ is now obsolete, as it recollects the Cold War with its relatively neat division between the East and the West, which was overcome by the fall of the Berlin Wall. Consequently, they prefer terms such as ‘East-Central Europe’ or ‘Central Europe,’ which includes much of the areas that once belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire or pits the newly westernised part of the old Eastern Europe, as demonstrated by its accession to such institutions as the European Union and NATO, against those remnants of the old European East, which have remained outside these structures, such as Serbia, Russia and some ex-Soviet republics. Such change in terminology reflects what Immanuel Wallerstein describes as a ‘game of geographical musical chairs’ (Wallerstein 1984: 9) in what he terms the ‘world-economy’, namely some states moving upward, others downward, usually following a significant political and economic upheaval. We opt for the term ‘Eastern Europe’ for two reasons. One is the simple fact that this book covers both the period of state socialism and the subsequent 30 or so years, a period labelled postcommunist or postsocialist. The second reason is our desire to account for\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n5\n\ncontinuities and disruptions in the popular music produced and consumed in Eastern Europe. In the existing histories of Eastern Europe, the discontinuities have attracted more attention: the end of state socialism was a dramatic change, as symbolised by the spectacle of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which opened a new and arguably happier era of freedom and prosperity. However, we believe that although much changed, much remained the same. It is worth evoking two categorisations of states: one proposed by Wallerstein, concerning world economies at large and one by Lee Marshall, who limits himself to the discussion of power within popular music. The main idea we take from Wallerstein is that the world economy is dynamic. In particular, the statuses of core and periphery are not fixed geographically, but are relative to each other. A zone defined as ‘semi-periphery’ acts as a periphery to the core and as a core to the periphery. Nevertheless, countries comprising Eastern Europe are seen by Wallerstein as ‘semiperiphery’, along with countries such as Brazil and Mexico (Wallerstein 1984: 142–143). According to Marshall, the global recording industry is made up of three concentric circles, with the centre called ‘hegemonic mainstream’ located in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan. The next circle consists of ‘integrated countries,’ such as Canada and Finland, which, although they take part in economic exchange with central countries, they are the weaker partner; and the third and last circle includes ‘periphery nations’, including territories in which global record labels do not have a very strong position or are not present at all (Marshall 2013: 3). The question which interests us is whether, since the early 1990s, have Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic evolved from ‘periphery’ to ‘integrated countries’. The answer to this question depends largely on whether we consider the position of the creators or the consumers of music from these countries and whether we take into account the position of Eastern European music within the continent or globally. Without doubt the fall of the Berlin Wall was an important factor in facilitating access to music from the West by Eastern European audiences. The lifting of restrictions on importing western music and to travel, allowed, for example Eastern European fans of electronic music to visit techno clubs in Berlin or London. The same restrictions were lifted for Eastern European musicians, who were now allowed to knock on the doors of club\n\n6\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nmanagers in Berlin or Brussels and approach foreign labels. Some artists took advantage of this opportunity; for example, some Polish and Hungarian electronic musicians signed record deals with German labels. For many others, however, the doors remained locked. By and large, the lifting of barriers was not accompanied by an increased penetration of the West by Eastern European music. It could even be argued that the position of this music declined, because it lost its old protection on the domestic and regional markets, as import embargos of western music were lifted. This situation is well illustrated by the fate of recording companies in Eastern Europe. Having served the agenda of their governments, which prioritised products from the Eastern Bloc, while also specializing in producing and distributing music of local artists and those from ‘brotherly countries’, these record companies were purchased by western companies, such as EMI or Warner during the course of the 1990s. It was noticed that these subsidiaries do not use their position to nurture local talent and promote it abroad, but merely treat Eastern Europe as a market to sell music produced in the centre, deemed more competitive (Elavsky 2011). Moreover, as these companies became subjects of EU legislation, which often requires further changes in ownership, one effect was weakening the agency of local actors. Hence, we argue that joining the West by Eastern Europe resulted, on some occasions, not in diminishing distance from the core, but increasing it. Wallerstein’s understanding of world economy as a dynamic system is equally applicable to the popular music industry and its institutional actors. We only need to remind ourselves of the 1990s, when declining record sales were balanced by the increasing role of revenues generated through live music. Within the industry, this change resulted in artists being less dependent on producers and record company executives, radio programmers and radio station personnel, while being increasingly reliant on personal managers, talent agents, promoters, venue managers, and the creative and operative staff involved in organising summer and other kinds of festivals. While the infrastructure of the music industry came into being in Eastern Europe with institutional actors serving as facilitators and gate-keepers for performers and music genres, the political economy of popular music was distorted by ideological premises and the constant search for the role of popular culture in state socialist society. Such external restrictions posed on Eastern Bloc music industries severely restricted them from following the market principles of supply and demand and contributed to the peripheral\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n7\n\nrole of Eastern European music compared to the free-market—oriented Anglo-American one. Beside the negligible market share of Eastern Europe within global sales, which did not improve much post-1990, weak contacts between industry actors from the West and the East further added to the marginal status of the region’s popular music. Even those industrial actors who joined and gained senior positions within major record companies had little economic incentive to support local representatives of mainstream genres which, given the linguistic barriers between Eastern Europe and the rest of the world, were difficult to promote abroad. Although not in a systematic and methodologically homogenous manner, this volume maps up the transnational dimension of Eastern European popular music by emphasising the role of institutional and non-institutional actors of the music industry: performers, record companies, organisers of megafestivals, booking agents, television and radio broadcasters, small venue operators, smugglers and black-market racketeers. Besides factors shaping the production, distribution and commodification of music, authors of this volume also draw attention to the role of consumers, such as fans, fellow artists and opinion-leaders of the music press, in shaping trends and, ultimately, influencing what forms of international contacts prove to be viable while others fail. Reflections on the consumers of music emphasise the intermeshing of music and personal and group identity, including class identity. Exploring the post-communist correlation between market forces and consumer identity, Zsolt Gy˝ ori’s chapter about Hungary’s largest summer festival, the Sziget Festival, argues that the business model of the event increasingly favoured the musical taste of affluent, Western European fans, even at the cost of marginalising local talent and depriving them of the opportunity to internationalise their fan base. This case study offers empirical testimony on the capitalist foundations of the music industry, the centres of which lie where high purchase power allows the realisation of higher profits. Therefore, this collection argues for the importance of seeing not only discontinuities, but also continuities between the circumstances of popular music in Eastern Europe before and after the fall of the Iron Curtain. We believe that the changes in global politics, the economy and technology did not fundamentally transform the old hierarchies and structures in popular music of this region. After 1990, the popular music market in Eastern Europe remained dominated by western products or easternised versions of western genres. Similarly, making a career in the West is as difficult for the aspiring musician from Eastern Europe as ever before, even if the reasons for that have changed.\n\n8\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nAnother problem encountered in discussion of the international dimension of popular music in Eastern Europe pertains to the concept of popular music. In its simplest terms, popular music is music with wide appeal, distributed through the music industry and which can be performed and enjoyed by people with little or no musical training (Middleton 1990: 3–7). Popular musicians favour such pleasurable devices as tonality, melody and simpler rhythms, which serious musicians tend to shun (Goodwin 2000: 223) and use the verse, chorus and bridge structure. Popular music is a wider term than what Motti Regev labels ‘pop-rock’. As Regev himself admits, the term ‘pop-rock’ is problematic on two counts. One is the relationship between ‘pop’ and ‘rock’, and the other is the place of rock in popular music history. The author refers to several distinctions between ‘rock’ and ‘pop’, of which the most widely accepted is that between rock as a more authentic and artistic sector of popular music and ‘pop’ as its more commercial, ‘inauthentic’ and watered-down version (Regev 2002: 251; on the division between pop and rock see also Frith 2001: 94–95; Keightley 2001: 109). However, while not rejecting it altogether, Regev argues that what connects pop and rock is more important than what divides these categories; hence the use of the meta-category ‘pop-rock’. He defines ‘poprock’ by three characteristics: a typical set of creative practices, a body of canonised albums, and two logics of cultural dynamics, namely commercialism and avant-gardism (Regev 2002: 252–257). The creative processes pertaining to ‘pop-rock’ include ‘extensive use of electric and electronic instruments, sophisticated studio techniques of sound manipulation, and certain techniques of vocal delivery, mostly those signifying immediacy of expression and spontaneity’ (ibid.: 253). This definition also suggests that the division between pop-rock and art or academic music is not sharp. Some pop-rock music, in common with art or serious music, requires a certain training of the listener, even if only informal. Moreover, some poprock musicians might operate in art, academic or non-commercial environments and ‘sell themselves as [high] artists’ (Frith and Savage 1998: 8). On the other hand, some arthouse musicians achieve commercial success and market themselves similar to pop-rock stars (Scott 2005: 124). While in the West the problem of the division between popular and serious/academic music and between pop and rock was mostly academic and cultural, in the socialist East it was also political. As Gregory Kveberg argues in relation to the Soviet Union, but which is also valid in the rest of Eastern Europe, in the absence of other markers of distinction, status in this region became very closely tied to the acquisition of culture. The Soviet model\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n9\n\nof culture demanded that cultural activity fostered personal growth, rather than being merely a form of entertainment (Kveberg 2015: 213), and this required maintaining a strict hierarchy of cultural products. In this hierarchy, ‘classical music was the most culturally valuable, followed by political and agitational songs, with love songs, dance music and [Estrada] music at the bottom’ (ibid.: 213). Although this hierarchy was imposed from above, some of its aspects were in fact widely accepted and internalised by the producers and consumers of popular music in Eastern Europe. As Kveberg observes, the belief in the need to spread culture and raise the cultural level of the audience linked conservative Soviet officials and many key figures of the underground (ibid.: 217). This connection was reflected, as Adam Havlik in this collection argues, in the politics of legal and illegal import of western records to Czechoslovakia, in which rock was valued higher than disco records; and as explained by Mariusz Gradowski in his chapter, in the ambition of Czesław Niemen to free himself from the shackles of commercial music,. Similarly, one of the reasons why Leonard Cohen had an elevated status in Poland was a perception that he was not merely a singer-songwriter, but an author of serious poetry, as Ewa Mazierska and Xawery Stanczyk ´ argue in their joint contribution to this collection. Kveberg’s arguments could be extended to serious but dissident artistic practices and musical undertakings which refused to entertain and, instead, voiced social and political critique. For instance, bands and fans associated with genres such as punk, hardcore, and new wave regarded the term ‘popular’ as a term of abuse, the very antithesis of authenticity. Yet, these genres and the subcultures they arose from, just as much as the DIY ethos these subscribed to, fell under strict political censorship. While it is true that the state did not favour popular music, it did not act hostile upon its representatives, unlike in the case of music voicing social criticism and bands whose aesthetic expression was too ambiguous and did not fit traditional categories of high art. Of this second group the Slovenian Laibach and the Hungarian Vágtázó halottkémek (Galloping Coroners) were most relevant. Both formations had unique musical styles, stage antics and their thought-provoking, ambiguous, high powered and visceral performances appealed to the young intelligentsia. Yet, they were systematically banned, not necessarily because of their political nonconformity, but rather for their non-compliance with the unvoiced official expectation of popular music to be disciplined, easily digestible and undemanding. These two bands (and potentially many others) are clearly relevant to the international dimension of popular music in Eastern Europe, since they integrated\n\n10\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nsuccessfully into international circuits, regularly toured in Western Europe; and Laibach released numerous albums for the much respected underground label Mute Records, including experimental and ‘Balkanised’ cover versions of Germanic and Anglo-American bands and their most popular hits. Admittedly, the old Eastern European disdain for the ‘popular’ in ‘popular music’ is a thing of the past. In particular, the recent flourishing of festival culture in Eastern Europe has questioned the boundaries existing between musical genres, even those between academic and popular. At many postmillennial mega festivals and other open air festivals, organisers invite performers covering a wide variety of musical tastes and, in this way, weaken the traditional hierarchies that exist between pop, rock, folk, jazz, experimental and classical music. However, the double status of some musicians and the all-arts focus of many festivals does not mean that the split between serious and popular music is seen as obsolete in Eastern Europe and by the authors of this volume. In this respect, we identify with the position taken by Andrew Goodwin, who insists on retaining it on account of the differences between textual characteristics of the bulk of high/experimental and popular art and, even more so, on the different modes of consuming them (Goodwin 2000). This split also plays a crucial role in our selection of case studies. The collection covers what Motti Regev describes as ‘pop-rock’ (Regev 2002: 25), as well as genres that do not fit this definition well, such as folk and Estrada music, and the borders between pop-rock and other genres. The final problem refers to the concept of ‘international’. Given that all pop-rock in Eastern Europe was influenced by music produced in Englishspeaking countries, it can be argued that this genre and a fair share of other subgenres of Eastern European popular music has a strong international dimension. However, our purpose is to focus on examples of music that are intentionally international due to the appeal to audiences in more than one country or to acknowledge its debt to foreign sources. We are interested in two-way traffic: from elsewhere to the Eastern European country and from the Eastern European country to abroad. Most important are two types of exchanges: between the European East and the West and within the state socialist bloc. The first is covered by authors who are concerned with the postwar period up to the end of state socialism, a period when, admittedly, the eastern audiences were hungry for western music. Several authors ask what exactly did eastern audiences want to listen to, how was the music brought to their countries and their houses and adjusted to their\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n11\n\nneeds. Their work leads to several observations. First, the Iron Curtain was not rigid, but porous—there were numerous ways to bring western music to the East, from sending records by mail or via professional smugglers to recording attractive programmes from radio and television. Moreover, socialist countries positioned along the way between the ‘West’ and the destination of a given music genre typically did not impede the transfer, but facilitated it. For example, as Adam Havlik demonstrates, many records with popular stars reached Czechoslovakia in its illiberal, post-1968 period via Yugoslavia, Hungary and Poland, whose regimes at the time were more tolerant. Second, due to the difficulty of accessing western music, resulting from political orthodoxy, economic constraints and the high price of western currency and western goods on the black market, buyers prioritized certain types of this music at the expense of others. Particularly well regarded was Anglo-American rock, especially bands representing progressive rock/art rock and rock ‘classics’, which were sustained over the passage of time. This reflected the high prestige this genre enjoyed in the West and the cherishing of high art in Eastern Europe, as we previously argued. It is worth mentioning here that even in Polish discotheques of the 1970s it was easier to spot recordings of bands such as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin than disco music because the early Polish DJs preferred music for listening than music for dancing, as well as the conviction that it makes more sense to invest money in LPs than singles, which cost almost as much as LPs, while coming across as ephemeral (Danielewicz and Jacobson 2017: 77). Third, governments of some Eastern European countries were not as hostile towards western products, as many historians of Cold War want us to believe, especially during the 1970s. The politics of the ISC demonstrates this well, as argued by Dean Vuletic. This festival did not limit itself to presenting singers from the Soviet bloc, but also extended its invitation to those from the West, often granting them the status of stars. By and large, the collection points to the fact that the ‘international’ is a dynamic concept that pertains to all aspects of music: its production, textual characteristics and consumption.\n\nDominant Approaches The wide variety of themes and problems examined in this book encourages a diversity of approaches, methods and theories. In particular, when dealing with relationships between music genres from regions and countries which have hugely uneven political, economic and cultural power,\n\n12\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nauthors tend to favour one of two approaches. One is known as a thesis of ‘cultural imperialism’. According to this thesis, the music industry reinforces marginality, inequality and asymmetrical flows along national and cultural boundaries (Laing 1986; Stokes 2012). As Gustavo Azenha observed in 2006, the ‘cultural imperialism’ paradigm attracted much criticism from popular music scholars and by the time he wrote his article, it looked obsolete. Azenha mentions two main criticisms. One concerns the fact that it ignores diversification of popular music and the second, that the core-periphery model is inadequate for understanding musical flows in the increasingly transnational music industry (Azenha 2006). The second approach, captured by the term ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’, used by Motti Regev, implies moving away from the core-periphery model and seeing popular music developed in different countries as participating in the global culture of late modernity, consisting of a process of intensified aesthetic proximity, overlap, and connectivity between nations and ethnicities or, at the very least, between prominent sectors within them (Regev 2013: 3; see also Stokes 2012). The ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’ paradigm sidelines the question of who affected whom, when, why and how, in a postmodern fashion regarding pop-rock music as infinitely intertextual, and seeing the task of the music historian as unravelling the rich tapestry. While ‘cultural imperialism’ concerns international relations, ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’ is about transnationalism, expressing a desire to transcend national and cultural boundaries. It is worth considering these models in the light of the ideas proposed by Wallerstein and Marshall. Proponents of the ‘cultural imperialism’ thesis accept that the music industry does not develop evenly—with stronger countries and regions imposing their products, rules and values on weaker ones. This influence does not necessarily happen through coercion, but by subtler means, such as dominating the media and being able to invest more in innovation than can weaker countries and regions (Laing 1986). One effect of ‘cultural imperialism’ is a desire to self-colonise by the weaker countries and regions by, in the case of music fans, striving to get hold of products of the Anglo-American music industry and imitating the dominant styles. This effect of ‘cultural imperialism’ is considered by Adam Havlik, who in his chapter draws attention to the prestige accrued by Eastern European fans who possessed western records or music journals. Regev, on the other hand, who wrote some time after the thesis of ‘cultural imperialism’ was formed, points to the democratizing effect of music flows. His thesis can be supported by such phenomena as the rise\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n13\n\nof world music or the global success of the ‘Latino wave’. However, the successes of bands such as Deep Forest, Enigma and singers such as Gloria Estefan, Daddy Yankee or Luis Fonsi can be also regarded as supporting the ‘cultural imperialism’ thesis, as they point, in the case of world music, of the skill with which the centre absorbs or reworks the music created at the periphery; and in the case of the Latino music, to the demographic shifts in the United States (Tauberg 2018). In this book we also see these two paradigms as complementary, rather than opposing each other. Thus, certain phenomena can be regarded either as a sign of domination of the centre over the Eastern European music or of its participation in the cosmopolitan culture. Consider musical festivals organized in Eastern Europe. From the perspective of audiences participating in such festivals, they constituted an opportunity to participate in cosmopolitan events. However, for many Eastern European artists taking part in them acted as a litmus test of their marginal position. For example, a major Polish Estrada star, Urszula Sipinska, ´ who in 1968 won the Sopot Festival, in her memoir writes with bitterness about the Intervision Music Festival in Sopot, where stars coming from the other side of the Iron Curtain, such as Abba, were paid more for one concert than what Polish Estrada stars earned throughout their entire life (Sipinska ´ 2005: 136). Authors of the majority of the chapters in this book lean towards a certain version of the ‘cultural imperialism’ paradigm. In particular, they recognize that during the period of state socialism, Anglo-American poprock was regarded as a privileged model for Eastern European pop-rockers and was highly valued by local audiences. This followed from the recognition that rock originated in the United States and the United Kingdom and from a widespread perception that the products of the capitalist system were of a higher quality than those of the socialist East. However, while ‘cultural imperialism’ suggests imposing a certain culture against the will of its recipients, on this occasion the ‘imperial music culture’ was sought after and received with gratitude. Often it was embraced as a cultural toolkit to express one’s dissatisfaction with state-subsidised and ideologically tailored popular music that suited Soviet-style cultural imperialism. In several chapters we find testimonies of various Eastern Europeans who went to great lengths to acquire records of British or American bands and performers. At the same time as being recipients of music, culture and ideology coming from the West, the Eastern European producers and consumers of popular music were also affected by pressures coming from the East, most importantly by the Soviet Union, albeit usually indirectly, via\n\n14\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\ntheir political authorities that influenced the country’s cultural policy and affected specific decisions made by institutions promoting popular music, such as music festivals and record companies. There were also artists who, dissatisfied with both types of cultural influences—from the capitalist West and the socialist East—sought inspiration elsewhere, in oriental music and culture, as Xawery Stanczyk ´ argues in his chapter. While the ‘cultural imperialism’ paradigm appears to be better suited to the cold war period, the ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’ approach seems to be more suited to the time after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when a large part of Europe lost its internal borders. Music, thanks to the internet, became practically borderless. Hence, Aimar Ventsel in his chapter about the concerts of punk bands in Estonia points to the fact that punk musicians from some Eastern European countries, such as Poland, shed some of their old self-perception and see themselves as part of the global scene. Similarly, Ruxandra Trandafoiu in her discussion of music festivals in Transylvania points to their cosmopolitan feel, as well as an attempt to capitalize on the touristy perceptions of this region. Other authors, such as Ewa Mazierska and Slobodan Karamani´c and Manuela Unverdorben, look at the ‘aesthetic cosmopolitanism’ not from the perspective of East-West relations, but within Eastern Europe.\n\nStructure and Chapter Description Our book is divided into three parts. The first part follows most closely the dominant approach to Eastern European popular music and recipients of popular music in this region, by focusing on the ways foreign music crossed national borders and how it was translated by local consumers. The first chapter, authored by Adam Havlik, examines the multitude of ways through which western music entered Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and the 1980s. Czechoslovakia of this period is a particularly interesting case study, because, following suppression of the Prague Spring, it became one of the most authoritarian countries in the Eastern Bloc. Hence one can conjecture that if western music managed to enter there legally or illegally, most likely it could flow almost anywhere else in Eastern Europe. Havlik points to two principle ways this music was transported into Czechoslovakia: legal and illegal. The legal route was largely via other, more liberal Eastern European countries, such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The illegal one consisted of smuggling LPs, cassettes, posters, magazines and to some extent also articles in music magazines. The scale of this smuggling by fans\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n15\n\nand professional smugglers was significant, demonstrating that the Iron Curtain was far from impervious, in part reflecting the ambiguous official discourse on western pop culture. Havlik also points to the privileged position of Anglo-American rock in the unofficial market of western music in Czechoslovakia. Such observation would also apply to other Eastern European countries, reflecting the status of rock as ‘high art within popular music’. The next chapter, written by Ewa Mazierska and Xawery Stanczyk, ´ examines the phenomenon of Leonard Cohen’s popularity in Poland. In assessing it, the authors treat it as a case of a ‘quiet fanaticism’: private, yet deep fascination with Cohen’s songs, poems and his overall persona. The authors of the chapter try to measure his popularity and identify reasons why the Canadian poet and singer-songwriter achieved such an elevated status in Poland. They draw attention to the fact that in the 1970s and the 1980s he appealed to the tastes of the Polish intelligentsia, especially to intellectuals and artists, who perceived themselves as trendsetters. They were attracted by the high quality of his lyrics and their dark, foreboding tone, as well as his edifying the position of the underdog, which was in tune with the ethos of Polish Romanticism. Moreover, to understand Cohen, one did not need particular proficiency in English, but rather a specific cultural education, to understand and appreciate his metaphors. Furthermore, the fascination was fuelled by the difficulty of accessing his work; his records had to be brought from the West or borrowed and copied from those who had access to them. Mazierska and Stanczyk ´ also argue that after the fall of state socialism, Cohen lost his privileged position because western music was reduced to an object of consumption. The third chapter in this part also concerns Poland. In it, Xawery Stanczyk ´ argues that the use of orientalism in Polish popular music and especially alternative rock of the 1980s was a way to gain authenticity. This happened not by mechanical and superficial transporting of oriental motifs into Polish songs, but by displaying genuine interest in exotic cultures from the Polish perspective, actively seeking information about them, promoting their ideas and values and reworking them for the benefit of the Polish audience. Stanczyk ´ links the proliferation of Orientalism in this decade to the politicisation of Polish popular music by situating it in one of two pigeonholes: either friendly towards the regime or oppositional. Under these circumstances ‘going Oriental’ signified a desire to free oneself from the shackles of such categories and emphasise one’s artistic autonomy. Stanczyk ´ also points to some additional factors why Orientalism penetrated\n\n16\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nthe Polish alternative rock scene, namely its popularity in other types of art and cultural discourses, especially Polish theatre. The last chapter in this part discusses the politics of attracting foreign bands to Eastern Europe or, more precisely, to Estonia, construed by westerners as the ‘frontier’ (between the civilised West and the wild East). This chapter is written by Aimar Ventsel, an anthropologist and historian of popular music who also worked as a booking agent, organising concerts of German, Finnish, Slovenian, French and Norwegian ska, punk and garage bands, in a Rock’n’Roll Club in Tartu. In his chapter Ventsel shares with the reader the tricks of his trade, mentioning that attracting a band to play in the ‘frontier country’, particularly a punk band, was not so much a matter of offering it good financial conditions, as knowing its schedule and being able to book it for a day when it has a break during the concert tour. Ventsel also draws attention to the fact that the status of ‘frontier’ in popular music is constantly shifting. He notices that during the last five or so years, Poland had effectively been absorbed into the Western European side of the punk world, and the punk frontier switched to the Baltics, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Still, Eastern Europe’s popular music and its audience are perceived as different than the West, being seen as ‘rougher’, yet also more authentic. Overall, this part demonstrates that, in contrast to Nick Hayes, who in his investigation of the career of Dean Reed in Eastern Europe argues that ‘Reed benefited from the starvation diet that had preceded his arrival in Eastern Europe’ (Hayes 1994: 173); in fact, Eastern Europeans were more choosy in their approach to western music than they are credited for, especially in the last two decades of socialist rule. There was a preference for music that could be regarded as serious, would withstand the passage of time and be in tune with Eastern European sensibilities. Some of these preferences can be explained by the sheer high cost of acquiring foreign music by Eastern European music lovers. To get value for money, they had to invest in music that would not lose its value quickly, but would age well; classics of rock and Cohen’s music fulfilled this requirement perfectly. While the first part of this collection concerns the movement of foreign music into Eastern Europe, the second focuses on this music moving abroad. The first chapter in this part, written by Mariusz Gradowski, charts the efforts of the Polish rock star Czesław Niemen to make a career abroad. Gradowski carefully recreates Niemen’s travels, participation in music events and foreign recordings, to conclude that ultimately his achievements as an international star were modest. Gradowski attributes\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n17\n\nthis fact not so much to the hostility of foreign, especially western markets to Eastern European musicians, but to the posture Niemen adopted as an autonomous, non-commercial artist, willing to sacrifice international popularity for the luxury of experimenting with electronic instruments in his home studio in Poland and indulging his love of the works and ideas of the Polish Romantic poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid. Tacitly, Gradowski acknowledges that for those Eastern European musicians who cherished independence and strove to transcend the boundaries of pop-rock, staying at home was the best strategy. He also acknowledges that for popular musicians from Eastern Europe this region was the easiest to conquer. This claim is developed by Ewa Mazierska in her chapter about collaboration between Polish and Yugoslav musicians in the post-communist period, especially between Goran Bregovi´c and two Polish singers, Kayah and Krzysztof Krawczyk, as well as the projects ‘Yugoton’ and ‘Yugopolis’, against the background of relations between Polish and Yugoslav music during the period of state socialism. She points to the advantages of this collaboration, as measured in the large number of records sold, money earned, and cultural capital accrued thanks to choosing a less obvious path to internationalisation than singing in English songs modelled on Anglo-American pop-rock. She also demonstrates that the interest in ‘Yugo-Polish’ was asymmetrical: Polish love of Yugoslav music was not reciprocated by a surge of (post)Yugoslav artists covering Polish songs. This suggests that Polish popular music is regarded as more parochial than its Yugoslav counterpart. This imbalance might be explained by the fact that the size of the Polish market for music encourages Polish musicians to address Polish audiences, rather than seeking popularity abroad and the more western outlook of Yugoslavia in comparison with Poland of state socialism. The last chapter in this part, written by Slobodan Karamani´c and Manuela Unverdorben, considers two types of Balkan music that flourished after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which the authors describe as ‘Balkan high’ and ‘Balkan low’. The first type, regarded as a type of world music, has been widely celebrated for its hybrid nature, because it fuses influences from East and West, contemporary and traditional, urban and pastoral. By contrast, the second type, pop-folk Balkan music, epitomised by Serbian turbofolk, is derided by pro-western cultural elites in the Balkans and elsewhere, perceiving it as excessive and aggressive: either as being too modern, or too traditional, inauthentic or nationalist and, in essence, too commercial and obscene. Karamani´c and Unverdorben argue that there are no essential reasons to treat Balkan low music as parochial, given that this\n\n18\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nmusic conquered the entire region of the Balkans and ventured beyond, as demonstrated by the international career of Lepa Brena. The true reason that a different status is assigned to these two phenomena is, in the opinion of the authors of this chapter, their different relation to class, with pop-folk Balkan music being seen as pandering to the most vulgar taste. We shall add that Karamani´c and Unverdorben’s argument can also be applied to pop-folk genres in several other Eastern European countries, such as disco polo in Poland and mulatós in Hungary, which hybridise many influences, yet are treated with derision by critics due to their allegedly bad taste. The final part of the book concentrates on international song contests and festivals. At such events, the transnational dimension of popular music is most apparent, because they put into direct contact the professionals of the music industry, the artists and the fans from different countries, allowing them to engage with different facets of internationalism. Authors of chapters in this part agree that these events of televised and live music offer unique opportunities to explore both the relationship between politics, culture and entertainment and the inner workings of the international music industry. Dean Vuletic describes the parallel and interconnected histories of the Intervision Song Contest (ISC) organized in the Eastern Bloc (in Czechoslovakia and Poland, respectively) and the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) held in Western European countries. Being a prestige project of the International Organisation for Radio and Television, the ESC mirrored cultural, economic, political, social and technological changes across postwar Europe and articulated national interests and identities. The structure and execution of the ISC was modelled after the ESC and, although numerous innovations were introduced, Vuletic contends that it not only failed to fulfil the aim to increase the visibility of state socialist popular music in western liberal democracies, but reflected a sense of inferiority felt towards Western Europe. The author regards the direct involvement of political actors and bodies in the selection of national contestants as a telling example of cultural diplomacy. In this light, the international dimension of popular music was not used primarily to advocate cultural openness but used by organizers to promote themselves and their states. The close ties the Czechoslovak and Polish governments forged with the contest (in specific) and popular music (in general), suggests Vuletic, were part of a calculated strategy to pose as champions of openness. The reform spirit of Dubˇcek’s and Gierek’s governments, however, made the ISC increasingly dependent on the local political situation and eventually sacrificed the\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n19\n\ncontest for the sake of creating their liberal image. As the case of the ISC suggests, popular music in communist Eastern Europe served as a symbol of western cultural influences. Zsolt Gy˝ ori’s chapter, ‘Between Utopia and the Marketplace: The Case of the Sziget Festival’, follows a similar narrative, only this time in a postsocialist context. The history of Hungary’s largest summer music festival, according to the author, should be written from the perspective of the concerted efforts of organisers to brand it as a cosmopolitan event. Gy˝ ori explores the festival’s internationalisation and the challenges this brought to its local fan-base of middle-class youth. Based on sociological surveys conducted among festivalgoers and an overview of televisual marketing campaigns, the chapter argues that the Sziget-brand—founded on the values of cultural openness, social tolerance, Eurocentrist liberalism and cosmopolitanism—was challenged, on the one hand, by the paternalist and increasingly Eurosceptic public sphere in Hungary and, on the other hand, the gradual commercialisation of the festival. The paradoxes addressed by Vuletic’s chapter reverberate here as the conflicting perceptions about the cultural value of internationalisation. While Hungarian bands and participants alike felt excluded at the event, organisers re-branded the festival for the affluent European middle-class and integrated the cult of youth into its cosmopolitan image. In her chapter Ruxandra Trandafoiu explores how the fans of the Untold festival, Romania’s leading music festival and one of the biggest electrodance music (EDM) festivals in Europe, taking place in Cluj, negotiate their regional, national and global identities. The chapter overviews the festival’s promotion through posters and videos and calls attention to how organisers appropriate, adapt and express immediately recognisable universal symbols and cultural tropes. Emphasising the local flavour of primordialism through featuring wolves, bears, vampires and other fantastic creatures both in the promotional campaign and fairy tale–like venue, serve the purpose of making local Transylvanian identities easily accessible to global audiences. According to the author, the global mainstreaming of EDM, which relocated these events from clubs into parks and other public places, helped Untold to reach a more diverse and younger audience. Similar to the Sziget Festival, Untold appeals to cosmopolitanism and authenticity perceived as the possibility to participate in the same ephemeral experience as audiences anywhere in the world. But unlike the Hungarian event, the Cluj festival invented Transylvanian and Romanian identities that were willingly internalised by locals. By blending received, inherited and adopted\n\n20\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nidentities—through the skillful use of technology—the international dimension of popular music came into being, Trandafoiu argues, as a symbolic and festivalised space of negotiation between the regional, the national and the global. The last three chapters of the volume bring to mind Tappert’s description of popular music as a relentless tourist, crossing borders, finding its way into new communities and transforming them, but also transforming itself through the new cultural, political, social and other stimuli it receives. Popular music not only connects but reveals the conditions of connectedness: how different countries, regions, professional elites and music consumers perceive themselves and each other.\n\nThe Avenues of Further Research We offer this book to the reader with an awareness that it only scratches the surface by omitting many facets and examples of international relations of Eastern European music. It is worth mentioning some of them as an encouragement for further investigation. One is the foreign ‘campaigns’ and successes of other Eastern European musicians to those mentioned in this book and their possible influences on both Eastern European and western music. We shall mention here the numerous foreign tours of the band Omega and the subsequent covering and appropriation of their best known song, ‘Pearls in Her Hair’ (‘Gyöngyhajú lány’) first by the West German band Scorpions and later by hip hop singer Kanye West. Besides Omega, many other Hungarian bands and singers gained international success, including Illés-Együttes, Metro, Syrius, Locomotiv GT, Skorpió, Kati Kovács, Zsuzsa Koncz, Zorán Sztevanovity, but similar lists could be compiled for any country of the region. Such an inventory should also include underground bands, like the already mentioned Galloping Coroners, which stirred up the 1980s underground scene in Western Europe with electric stage performances and made a lasting impression on such icons of the underground/hardcore scene as Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Iggy Pop. The Slovenian art collectives Laibach and Neue Slowenische Kunst achieved even greater fame with worldwide concert tours since the late 1980s and served as an inspiration for such highly acclaimed bands as Rammstein and, as Marina Gržini´c contends, located itself within the “sociopolitical space of Europe, which simultaneously represents a western and an eastern phenomenon” (Gržini´c 2003: 250). Special attention should be made to the transfer of music and musical cultures between\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n21\n\nEastern Europe and Russia, given that, as we already noticed, the Soviet market was particularly friendly towards musicians from the ‘brotherly’ countries and that some Russian stars, such as Alla Pugatschova, were genuinely popular among the entire Eastern Bloc, especially in Poland. It will be a fascinating project to write about the histories of those musicians who not only toured in the West, but settled there, as exemplified by many artists from Poland, such as Basia, Krzysztof Klenczon from Czerwone Gitary or Jerzy Grunwald from No To Co. Another unexplored area, except for the case of Dean Reed, are the careers of western and southern musicians who relocated to Eastern Europe, for example John Porter and numerous Greeks, such as Milo Kurtis and Eleni, who settled in Poland and became major stars in this country. An interesting question is how they negotiated their identities to appeal to the Polish audience and whether they tried to ‘travel further’, achieving international success and if so, why they ultimately failed in this respect. Apart from musicians, key professionals of the music industry also deserve attention, especially since there are only a few Eastern Europeans who, like the Polish Leonard Chess and the Hungarian Leslie Mandoki and Charles Fisher, became world-renown record producers. Their perception of popular music in their native countries and (lack of) interest in promoting local talents might further illuminate the status of Eastern European performers within the international context. A similar case could be made for concert promoters from the region, such as László Heged˝ us from Hungary, whose experience of booking Western star acts stretch across many decades. The history of state socialist record companies, including Amiga, Balkanton, Diskoton, Hungaroton, Jugoton, Opus, Polskie Nagrania, Polton and Supraphon, and especially the role these labels played in the popularisation of western trends and the export of eastern music offers uncharted territory for researchers of the international and transnational dimension of popular music. It will also be fruitful to look at internationalisation of Eastern European music from the perspective of different genres by, for example, comparing rock with electronic music and consider film music, where Eastern composers seem to fare better than fellow musicians, to give examples of such composers as Jan Kaczmarek or Abel Korzeniowski from Poland. An interesting question is whether this is because the market for film music is significantly different than that for the rest of popular music, given that film musicians do not sell their music directly to fans.\n\n22\n\n˝ E. MAZIERSKA AND ZS. GYORI\n\nHowever, there are numerous difficulties in conducting such investigation. The most important of them is the dominance of national frameworks in the research of popular music in Eastern Europe and the lack of collaboration of researchers from different countries, Eastern and Western, as well as within one country. As Patryk Galuszka writes in relation to state socialist Poland, a claim that can be extended to practically all countries of the Soviet bloc, ‘a significant impediment to the development of popular music research during the People’s Republic of Poland was the isolation of researchers from works carried out in the West, which was only to some extent mitigated by the contacts within the Eastern Bloc. Insufficient cooperation between various national centres conducting research on popular music was also a significant problem during the communist period. The research was conducted as part of individual projects (e.g., doctoral dissertations), but this did not translate into the integration of the research community, undertaking joint research or continuation of analyses conducted in one centre by researchers from outside such a centre’ (Galuszka 2020). After the fall of state socialism, contacts between the researchers from Eastern Europe became more frequent, in part thanks to conferences on popular music in Eastern Europe, organised in places such as Debrecen, Budapest and Olomouc, but so far they lead merely to academics from different countries presenting their country-specific studies to international audiences, rather than projects crossing national and regional borders. The rise of nationalism in many of the previously socialist countries might be an additional factor in promoting and reinforcing a countrycentred approach. Moreover, even those researchers who attempt to transcend this approach encounter numerous obstacles, such as the need to familiarise oneself with the culture of another country and the lack of data about the successes or lack thereof of specific musicians; for example, the number of records sold abroad. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that many important musicians are no longer available, as is the case with Czesław Niemen, examined in this book. Nevertheless, we hope that such research will continue not only for the sake of exploring specific problem areas but to find answers to wider questions related to popular music, concerning issues of cultural hegemony, control of artistic creativity, authenticity and identity formation of musicians and their fans.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: CROSSING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL …\n\n23\n\nWorks Cited Aspray, William. 2008.

After a brief period of relatively free traffic in the late 1960s, the borders were about to be sealed again. This was one of the measures imposed by the new political elite in order to consolidate power after a tumultuous period of political liberalisation known as the Prague Spring (Tuma ˚ and Vilímek 2012). Under the new conditions, direct contact with the West was curtailed as travelling abroad became one of the most restricted areas (Rychlík 2007: 90). Official discourse on the West mediated through the media also changed as the media came under close\n\nA.

HAVLÍK\n\nscrutiny and were heavily affected by the reinstatement of censorship and drastic personnel changes within their ranks (Bren 2010: 35–36). This chapter is partially based on my earlier research regarding western music in socialist Czechoslovakia and the black market that evolved around it (Havlík 2009, 2012). The chapter explores how the new political and social circumstances after 1968 affected Czechoslovak citizens in terms of getting into contact with western (predominantly British and American) pop and rock music, which in the meantime gained a profound influence in the Eastern Bloc, especially among the younger generation (Ryback 1990; Judt 2005: 348–349). I argue that even with tighter regulations introduced in the wake of the Prague Spring, music fans in Czechoslovakia had numerous strategies to get in touch with popular music from the West, ranging from the official and state-sanctioned to the more informal, even illegal ones. In some areas, especially in border regions, people had the opportunity to listen to foreign radio stations and watch West German or Austrian television programmes. Others would borrow or buy records from the so-called cultural institutes of the brotherly socialist states located in Prague. The local music industry also occasionally issued a limited amount of licensed western albums, and foreign music records were on sale in local hard-currency stores. Along with that, the hunger for western rock and pop music led to the birth of so-called music markets, where smuggled records would be sold in large numbers. In fact, smuggling of (western) commodities was an inseparable part of everyday life across the Eastern Bloc (Borodziej et al. 2010: 10–13) and smuggling of music records was not an exception. Groups of traffickers brought in tons of LPs (later also audio cassettes) through the Iron Curtain in inventive ways. After having passed through border control, they could be sold very profitably as there was an enormous demand for the smuggled LPs. Apart from organized smuggling, many individuals developed alternative strategies to acquire the much sought-after commodities. Some tried to bring in music records on their own. Adept smugglers with bigger contrabands usually resorted to corruption, bribes or the use of elaborate hiding spaces in cars and, in some cases, trains. Others simply counted on the indulgence of customs officers in order to get records to Czechoslovakia. Receiving records through the post represented a certain strategy too, provided one had contacts abroad. The main aim of this article is to analyse the above-mentioned ways of obtaining specific goods and cultural artifacts, and their importance and development over time in the 1970s and 1980s. I will also examine the origin of the records carried across the borders as well as their ‘inland’\n\n2\n\nLOOPHOLES IN THE IRON CURTAIN: OBTAINING WESTERN MUSIC …\n\n29\n\ndissemination. Moreover, I will explain what the possession of precious records actually meant to their owners within the specific context of state socialist Czechoslovakia and how these records were used (be it consciously or unconsciously) to generate different kinds of capital (Bourdieu 1986). I will also discuss the motivations for participating in the smuggling and selling of western records. The selection of sources essential for the text consists of oral transmissions, as well as of police documents, documents related to customs offices at the borders, memoirs and TV documentaries.\n\nThe Fetish of Foreign Music Records and Their Symbolic Capital No matter how one acquired them, foreign records—especially those of western origin—had a high symbolic value for their owners in late socialist Czechoslovakia. Due to their unavailability and high price, some LPs were worshipped as precious cultural artifacts. Besides their scarcity, the adoration of foreign records was closely linked to the fascination with the West. However, this fascination, as anthropologist Alexey Yurchak shows (Yurchak 2006), did not necessarily mean automatic adoption of all values linked to the political West. According to him, many people inside the USSR, for example members of the Soviet Communist Youth, could consider themselves as good communist citizens and at the same time be avid fans of British and American rock music. They formed their own rock bands and adored artists like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin or King Crimson, who were publicly condemned as prime examples of decadent Western culture. Simultaneously, they honestly believed in the basic values of socialism. Therefore, it would be wrong to perceive the eastern fascination with western pop culture and its domestication simply as a conscious form of political opposition against the regime. Instead, Yurchak speaks of ‘hypernormalization’ of the ideological discourse, which enabled such ambivalence. The absence of real contact also played a significant role. For many people within the Eastern Bloc, the West represented a rather distant and imaginary world. Yurchak demonstrates this argument focusing on Soviet society, where common people had a minimal direct contact with the West and the ideological regime enjoyed a higher level of acceptance than it did in the satellite countries. Nevertheless, this thesis holds true even in those Eastern Bloc countries that were geographically and historically closer to the West.\n\n30\n\nA. HAVLÍK\n\nWhen analysing the value of the precious pop cultural artifacts represented to people living in state-socialist Eastern Europe, we may draw on Pierre Bourdieu, who maintains that the position of an individual in the social field is determined by a combination of his own permanent dispositions (habitus) and the ‘quantity’ of the individual types of capital that an individual can use for his or her own practice. In his work, Bourdieu distinguishes between several types of capital: economic (financial, material goods); cultural (including education, level of socialization, cultural awareness, but also possession of cultural assets); social (network of relations formed by contacts and acquaintances that can be used to achieve particular goals); and symbolic. Bourdieu defines symbolic capital as a possible combination of other types of capital, through which the individual can gain recognition (Bourdieu 1986: 241–258). As earlier research (Havlík 2016) indicates, in an environment affected by ubiquitous scarcity, foreign music records had great potential as cultural artifacts to generate cultural capital for their owners. Original LPs and cassettes were proof of cultural distinction and represented an alternative to the Czechoslovak mainstream. Thanks to having access to certain ˇ records, journalist Jan Cáp felt ‘like a boss’ in Pˇríbram, a town in Central Bohemia, and would despise Katapult (a Czechoslovak rock group) fans ostentatiously (Diestler 2008: 22). Being informed about the newest trends in rock and pop music was also a question of prestige. Whoever was able to follow the latest global trends and get the news before the others ˇ was always one step ahead. Jiˇrí Cerný claims that it was extremely important to have a sense of individual discovery of a particular band, like discovering Jethro Tull when his classmates were still celebrating the Rolling Stones ˇ (Jiˇrí Cerný, in Bigbít 1998). Social capital played an important role too. When searching for the desired bands and singers on vinyl, tapes or CDs, people with their own foreign supply channels or people who were acquainted with ‘insiders’ simply had a better starting position. Networks that boosted the social capital of music fans could also be built through borrowing or exchanging records. Through such transactions, not only pragmatic business partnerships were forged, but also genuine friendships based on shared music taste. Last but not least, economic capital also played a part here. Collecting precious records was by no means a cheap hobby. For those fans with limited financial resources, copying music to magnetic tapes offered an alternative: within a community of friends, one purchased LP could be recorded on countless tapes (Tácha 2014). However, damaging such precious items would\n\n2\n\nLOOPHOLES IN THE IRON CURTAIN: OBTAINING WESTERN MUSIC …\n\n31\n\nhave inauspicious consequences, especially for those who borrowed them from others. As Vladimír Trojánek recalls, scratching or breaking much treasured vinyl records was an unforgivable sin, which meant immediate exclusion of individuals from the community. A person who damaged borrowed records usually gained a bad reputation and would be stigmatized as someone untrustworthy (i/v with Trojánek 2011). Roman Laube recalls that the possession of precious records was a matter of one’s status as it represented a certain value and prestige. For Laube, the owners of up-to-date foreign LPs enjoyed respect in their community or at school, not to mention the possible admiration of their female counterparts (i/v with Laube 2009). However, in order to generate various kinds of capital through music records, one had to know how to get them in the first place. So, how did people actually get in contact with western music in post-1968 Czechoslovakia?\n\nThe Role of Radio, TV Broadcasts and Cultural Centres in Disseminating Western Music One of the ways domestic music fans could come in direct contact with western music was through radio broadcasts. Although foreign broadcasts were partially jammed, especially programmes focused on politics (Tomek 2002), modest opportunities for listening to some music programmes existed after 1968. Proximity to the border meant an advantage for those who tuned into foreign radio stations, but it also made watching western television programmes possible. Thanks to the abundance of music videos in the 1980s, residents in the border regions had a decent knowledge of western pop music stars and hits: not only thanks to Western TV stations, but also, for example, because of Polish television (Vít Kuˇcaj, in Bigbít 1998), which offered a larger selection of western music than Czechoslovak TV. Thus, foreign radio and television broadcasts were often caught on tape by listeners like Michal Dittrich, who, in the 1980s, used to visit a friend in Pilsen with a video recorder and record the ‘Rockpalast’ music sessions from West German TV, especially those starring his favourite band The Police (Dittrich, in Bigbít 1998). Czechoslovak Radio itself became a more thoroughly monitored media platform in the 1970s and foreign influences would be regulated according to a certain ratio: 50% of any played songs had to be of domestic origin, 25% of songs had to come from socialist countries and 25% from ‘the rest’ (Ješutová 2003: 389). This proved to be a simple yet effective way to\n\n32\n\nA. HAVLÍK\n\nregulate the influence of western music. However, western music was still heard in a limited number of domestic broadcasts as part of programmes like ‘Vˇetrník’ (broadcast since 1973) or ‘Hvˇezda’. The music-hungry youth in socialist Czechoslovakia were also able to obtain western music through official institutions of other countries. The US embassy offered movies, music, magazines or books for lending. But since the embassy was under surveillance from the Czechoslovak secret police, visiting it posed a considerable risk (Kouˇril 1999: 25). Cultural centres of other Eastern Bloc countries, especially the Polish Cultural Centre and the Hungarian Cultural Centre in Prague, enjoyed a decent reputation (Vanˇek 2010: 179). Here, records of numerous Polish and Hungarian bands were in stock. Aside from rock and pop artists from the Eastern Bloc, the cultural centres sold, albeit in limited numbers, albums of Western pop-rock bands. For example, in the 1980s, the Polish Cultural Centre would occasionally sell Depeche Mode albums, which contributed to the cult popularity of the British new wave band in the country. In 1988, when Depeche Mode played in Czechoslovakia, the band performed in front of a large and well-informed crowd. Writing about this colossal event, music journalist Ivan Cafourek pointed out that local fans already knew their albums, like Black Celebration, very well because, together with the compilation Singles 81–85, it was sold by the Polish Cultural Centre (Cafourek 1988: 18).\n\nLive Concerts and Official Press Speaking of concerts of western stars, the 1988 Depeche Mode gig was a ground-breaking event for socialist Czechoslovakia, which was (in this respect) miles behind Poland or Hungary. Between 1969 and the second half of the 1980s, local authorities did not organize any big concerts of prominent rock or pop bands from the United Kingdom or the United States. Later, bands like UB40, Duran Duran, Uriah Heep or the performer Stevie Wonder and a few others appeared sporadically (Vanˇek 2010: 201). However, in terms of the fanbase and official publicity, the Depeche Mode concert in March 1988 was outstanding. Aside from officially promoted concerts, a few gigs were also organized by the Jazz Section of the Czech Musician’s Union. From 1971 to its forced dissolution in 1986, the Jazz Section managed to issue publications for its members, containing articles about jazz and rock music from around the world and organized music\n\n2\n\nLOOPHOLES IN THE IRON CURTAIN: OBTAINING WESTERN MUSIC …\n\n33\n\nfestivals, allowing numerous Czechoslovak alternative rock bands as well as a few guests from abroad to perform on stage (see Kouˇril 1999). The state-controlled media also provided some information about Western rock and pop stars. In this respect, the monthly magazine Melodie played a crucial part. With hands partly tied by ideological constraints and constant censorship, some of the music journalists from Melodie tried to push through news and articles about leading bands from the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The scope was quite limited, but some of the authors managed to raise awareness about music scenes abroad and played an important role in shaping the taste of the local audience (Vanˇek 2010: 501–533). Melodie also featured an advertising section, which served as a handy platform for trading, buying and selling of both domestic and foreign records. These ads followed a common pattern; they were brief and featured a list of famous names, followed by the address of the seller: (Selling) LPs of the following bands: The Doors, The Kinks, The Hollies, The Who, The Yardbirds, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, James Gang, Deep Purple, Nazareth, L. Zeppelin, Wings and others. I can send a complete list if needed. Miroslav Bláha, Red Army Street 3992, 430 03 Chomutov. (Melodie 1977: 220)\n\nLicensed Albums, Cover Versions and Hard-Currency Stores The so-called licensed albums represented a specific commodity within the socialist music market. In Czechoslovakia, these came either in the form of actual albums of foreign artists with translated sleeve notes or as compilations, assembled by experts or music journalists and issued by official, state-controlled record companies such as Supraphon or Slovakian Opus. Intended primarily for registered members of the so-called Gramophone Club, such albums appeared as early as the 1960s and were released throughout the ‘normalisation’ period in the 1970s and 1980s, despite ideological and economic difficulties. According to international law, the Czechoslovak Society for the Protection of the Rights of Music Authors and Publishers had to pay in hard currency to their foreign business partners for releasing such albums on the domestic market (Doružka ˚ 1978: 22). Similar to licensed albums, cover versions of western hits were also released occasionally. However, these differed from the usual definition\n\n34\n\nA. HAVLÍK\n\nof cover songs where artists simply reinterpret a song in their own way, leaving the lyrics intact. Instead of this well-established practice, lyrics were remade in Czech while the music compositions remained unchanged, a practice that first appeared in the 1960s. Many Czechoslovak cover versions of western hits managed to climb to the top of the music charts in the two subsequent decades. A large part of such cover versions comprised catchy pop songs; however, the Czech industry even managed to produce local versions of British hard rock songs from bands like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple or Status Quo. Sometimes original songs with improper lyrics were replaced in the cover version by more optimistic ones, compatible with the ideological demands of the ‘socialist way of life’. This peculiarity brought some unique results, such as Jiˇrí Schelinger singing ‘Metro dobrý den’ (translation: ‘Hello Subway’) to Black Sabbath’s ‘National Acrobat’. A narrow variety of foreign records was occasionally also on sale in the so-called Tuzex stores. Similar to Soviet Beryozkas, Polish Pewex shops or East German Intershops, these stores offered luxury consumer goods for hard currency or special Tuzex vouchers. Originally, customers of Tuzex shops consisted of tourists, Czechoslovak citizens working abroad or those who had relatives living outside Czechoslovakia. However, over time, a vast black market for Tuzex vouchers and hard currencies emerged. Using the services of illegal money changers called ‘veksláci’, ordinary citizens could purchase the goods on offer in Tuzex (Havlík 2014: 26–31). Josef Vlˇcek, a music journalist, recollects the records he once bought from a Tuzex shop. His first album was Abraxas by Carlos Santana, published by the Indian company Dum Dum. According to him, the Dum Dums were ‘the worst LPs of all time’, always crackling and rustling. However, thanks to this Indian import, he managed to write his very first article (Diestler 2008: 28). The fact that the state apparatus paid valuable foreign currencies for licensed albums, specific types of cover versions or even for music available in hard-currency stores, serves as proof of a specific, state-sanctioned cultural transfer (Espagne and Werner 1985). The fact that socialist Czechoslovakia bought commodities of popular culture from the West does not mean that the local music scenes did not have any significance. Despite the success of homegrown bands, singers and their records, the demand for western rock and pop music was so immense that it could not be met by the official production of cover versions or by issuing limited numbers of licensed albums. Luckily for the music fans, there were other ways to satisfy their demands.\n\n2\n\nLOOPHOLES IN THE IRON CURTAIN: OBTAINING WESTERN MUSIC …\n\n35\n\nCarrying Records Across the Border One way to acquire western records was to take them personally across the state border. Compared to the late 1960s, the opportunities for crossing western borders were much more difficult for the vast majority of Czechoslovak citizens. One was required to obtain an official permit with an allowance for hard currency. After 1968, such permits were practically unattainable for ordinary citizens (Rychlík 2007: 84–93). Nevertheless, certain professionals, like scientists, athletes, artists, engineers or sales representatives, had better prospects of travelling not only to the West, but also to non-aligned countries of the world, like Yugoslavia (Vanˇek and Krátká 2014). Another group with an opportunity to bring western music into the country were international students (Hannová 2013: 50). Individual import of music by most Czech citizens took place mostly when visiting other socialist countries. States like Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia offered a bigger variety than the domestic music industry market (Andrs 2015: 40–46). Whether it was on the borders with West or East Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary or the Soviet Union, the actual procedure was similar: at the particular border crossing, the transported goods had to be listed on a customs declaration form and, if necessary, the traveller paid a customs duty. These differed from time to time and from country to country. With regards to the importing of music records, the duty fee was 10 Czechoslovak Crowns per album in 19"
