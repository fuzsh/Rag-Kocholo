        "text": "Kari Jalkanen - Niskavuoren Nuorimmainen\n\nKARI JALKANEN\n\nTuuli kääntyköön / Niskavuoren nuorimmainen\n\nRCA Victor FAS 051\n\n1972\n\n7\"\n\nKari Tapio (born Kari Jalkanen) is one of the most famous schlager singers in Finland. He started his career attending Danny's tours and acting as a keeper for the snake used in the shows. This first single was released under his real name Kari Jalkanen, but shortly after he took the artist name Kari Tapio. Despite the slightly unfunky singing on the funk song Niskavuoren Nuorimmainen, this 45 is one of the most sought after funky records from Finland among the Finnish groovy music enthusiasts. The song itself is pretty strict rip from Quincy Jones' hit Hicky burr with Jukka Virtanen's lyrics about the fictional Niskavuori family (propably related to the famous Finnish drama series). They've even wrote a \"thanks also to Quincy Jones\" on label, but no writing credits. The song is arranged by Esko Linnavalli and backed by his band. The a-side song Tuuli kääntyköön is quite non-interesting schlager song.\n\nNiskavuoren nuorimmainen\n\nVesa-Matti Loiri - 4+20\n\nVESA-MATTI LOIRI\n\n4+20\n\nFinnlevy SFLP 9513\n\n1971\n\nLP\n\n4+20 is the first album of Finnish well know actor, comedian and musician Vesa-Matti Loiri. Best known for his lead role in countless Uuno Turhapuro movies, he is also a professional flautist. The album is mostly flute-driven jazzfunk and free jazz, but there's also elements from folk songs on some songs. Vesa-Matti Loiri's musical career headed more and more into singing after this album. Due to a quite small pressing and poor distribution, this album is really hard to find nowadays. The best songs on this album are 3 different takes of the title track 4+20, uptempo groover Turkish coffee, latin influenced Carnavalito & El condor pasa, heavy vocal track Itkevä huilu (weeping flute in English) and of course the uptempo jazzfunk monster coming home baby. There's pretty impressive list of famous Finnish musicians on this album too. Pekka Sarmanto on bass and drums, Esko Rosnell on drums, Hasse Walli on guitar, eero Koivistoinen and Esa Pethman on saxophones, Tuomo Tanska on Organ and of course Vesa-Matti Loiri himself on flute, recorder and percussion among other musicians. Highly recommended album. If there's any chance, pick it up with no hesitation. Album was reissued in 2011.\n\nTurkish Coffee\n\nCarnavalito & El condor pasa\n\nComing home baby\n\nItkevä huilu\n\n4+20 (1. session)\n\nEero Koivistoinen - Valtakunta\n\nEERO KOIVISTOINEN\n\nValtakunta\n\nKustannusosakeyhtiö Otava OTALP 66\n\n1968\n\nLP\n\nValtakunta LP from 1968 was a pretty ambitious album by Finnish jazz scene maestro Eero Koivistoinen, who is best known for his work with psychedelic rock/blues band Blues Section among his own jazz albums such as For Children, Original Sin, Wahoo! and many others. Valtakunta was his first solo project and it's a mixture of psychedelic rock, jazz and ballads. It was even published not by any record label, but by a Finnish book publishing company Otava. The musicians in this album are familiar from other projects such as Blues Section, Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940, Wigwam and so on. With Ronnie Österberg on drums, Pekka Sarmanto on bass, Juhani Aaltonen, Paroni Paakkunainen and Eero Koivistoinen on saxophone, Hasse Walli on electric guitar Antero Jakoila on sitar among others, the line-up is top notch. Vocals are sung by well known singers of that time; Eero Raittinen, Seija Simola, Vesa-Matti Loiri and also Eero Koivistoinen himself. Lyrics on this album are written by poets Pentti Saarikoski, Tuomas Anhava, Jarkko Laine and Hannu Mäkelä. Valtakunta is a pretty weird album with really psychedelic and a little messed up feeling. Unfortunately the album is really rare these days, and even the cd reissue from 1995 is really hard to find.\n\nLennosta kii\n\nPientä peliä urbaanissa limousinessa\n\nKello kuusi\n\nEija Merilä - Iät ja ajat\n\nEIJA MERILÄ\n\nMä tahdon teidän oppivan / Iät ja ajat\n\nScandia KS 875\n\n1972\n\n7\"\n\nI've never been a big Dionne Warwick fan I must admit, but Say a little prayer makes an exception for me. I've always loved the song, and the way Eija Merilä did the cover version of that song gives me goose bumps. In a good way. It's a quite pompous song in a strong Bacharach-David way. Really good groover I must say. A-side song Mä tahdon teidän oppivan is a cover of The New Seekers song I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing, a song originally for a Coca Cola commercial in 1971.\n\nCalypso king & the soul investigators - Calypso strut\n\nCALYPSO KING & THE SOUL INVESTIGATORS\n\nCalypso strut / Party food\n\nJive 001\n\n1998\n\n7\"\n\nDebut 45 from the world famous Finnish funk group The soul investigators released under the longer form of their name Calypso king & the soul investigators. Released in 1998 on their own Jive label (not to be confused with the multinational record corpration with the same name), it started their long lasting career as one of the leading new funk bands in the world. Side a track Calypso strut is a uptempo funk song that starts with a break and continues to bang whole way through. B-side track Party food is a downtempo funk track with a little psychedelic feel and some nice fuzz guitar working. Especially the a side track has a strong bayo funk feel in it. This 45 was realesed with a pressing of only hundred or two so it's really scarce and in demand these days.\n\nCalypso strut\n\nParty food\n\nKirka - Igor\n\nKIRKA\n\nIgor / Alku kaiken kauniin\n\nScandia KS 810\n\n1969\n\n7\"\n\nIgor is a very raw uptempo funk song about a dog named Igor. Both songs are taken from a Jörn Donner movie 69, that was released the same year. In an interview Kirka tells that Jörn Donner was making a movie at that time and needed the music for it. So he rushed into the Scandia office and told that he needed a singer, a good one, and he knew Scandia had one. So Donner picked up Kirka to sing the soundtrack songs that were first released on a four track 45 ep and later on Kirka's self titled debut studio album. Kirka also tells that Donner already had in mind some songs made by Claes af Geijerstam that were already recorded in Sweden and he wanted Kirka to sing them in Finnish. On the other hand, Kirka's autobiography says that these songs were made for the movie 69 and later sung in English by Tommy Körberg for the international version of the movie. Anyway Igor is a great funk track that starts with a raw drum break and also features some exotic sounds made by a guitar with really loose strings that sound just like a sitar. There's two different versions of the Igor 45 with the other one (KS 811) having the song Pitkän tien pää (another Spinning wheel cover) on the flipside. KS 810 starts with an introduction of the song and the drum break fades in from the silence while KS 811 (and the album version) starts with the banging break without any fade in. B-side track Alku kaiken kauniin is a ballad from the movie. Both tracks appear also on the album Kirka (Scandia HSLP 114). Both the album and the 45s are quite hard to find.\n\nDirty Harry sextet - Go ahead! (make my day)\n\nDIRTY HARRY SEXTET\n\nGo ahead! / Footsteps\n\nRey Records REY001\n\n2005\n\n7\"\n\nDirty Harry sextet is a combo from Turku who concentrate on instrumental funk, mixing blaxploitation themes, chase funk and police movie atmospheres. Their debut 45 was released in 2005, but they haven't released nothing since. Hopefully they will activate themselves again some day, because this 45 is a nice peace of cinematic funk that I like. The a-side song Go ahead! is a banging uptempo blaxploitation chase scene'ish percussion driven banger with a really hectic feeling. The b-side song Footsteps is more mellow, groovy midtempo soft porn movie theme styled song. The pressing of this 45 was only 525 copies so it's getting scarce nowadays.\n\nGo ahead!\n\nFootsteps\n\nFarout - Further out\n\nFAROUT\n\nFurther out\n\nKompass Records KOLP-16\n\n1979\n\nLP\n\nFarout was a jazz-rock band from Lappeenranta, eastern Finland that won the national rock championships on a progressive line in 1978. After the success on championships, they got their debut album Further out released on Kompass Records in 1979. Unfortunately the success of the album was really poor with the sales only about 500 copies. From the beginning, the band played only instrumental music and so it is with the album too. The tracks are pretty strict jazz-rock fusion with a hint of progressive nuances. Best track on this album is the last song, funky fusion jam Brainwash (...Uhh!). Saxophonist Pekka Pöyry is also featuring on few tracks. Rare album nowadays.\n\nUnisono - Unisono\n\nUNISONO\n\nUnisono\n\nHi-Hat HILP 106\n\n1975\n\nLP\n\nUnisono was a Finnish jazz-fusion group that was founded 1973 by saxophist/flautist Paroni Paakkunainen, trumpetist Mike Koskinen, pianist Olli Ahvenlahti, guitarist Hasse Walli, bassist Make Lievonen ja drummer Reiska Laine. They recorded their only album in Stockholm in 1975 with Nono Söderberg on guitar and Pekka Pohjola on bass among Paakkunainen, Ahvenlahti and Laine. The band was disbanded few months after the album release and the players continued with their other projects. The music itself is quite strict jazz-rock fusion on a Chick Corea and Miles Davis manner. The grooviest track on this album is the opening track TVL, a nice funky fusion jam that goes smoothly the whole six minutes. This record though is hard to find for a reasonable price.\n\nLea Laven - Niin\n\nLEA LAVEN\n\nNiin\n\nEMI 5e062-35052\n\n1974\n\nLP\n\nFrom the Lea Laven 1974 album Niin is picked the track King Kong. I'm not 100% sure who first recorded the original, but I have a strong doubt that it was The Electric Ladies on Mainstream Records the same year. King Kong is a downtempo funky track about the huge gorilla we all know. The rest of the record is decent and not-that-decent schlager with covers from songs like We've only just begun, Dark lady, Yesterday once more, The man who sold the World, Superstar and so on. Not too common album, but not that hard to find either.\n\nNight train - Pyörä pyörii\n\nNIGHT TRAIN\n\nPyörä pyörii / Voit yksin kaiken muuttaa\n\nBlue Master 45-BLU 725\n\n1969\n\n7\"\n\nA nice double sider with really big beats. Night train was a short lived band from late 60s with possibly only two 45 releases. Here's the better one with a cover of Blood, Sweat & Tears classic Spinning wheel on the a-side. On the b-side you will find cover of You've made me so very happy as recorded by Brenda Holloway and later made famous by Blood, Sweat & Tears. The arrangements for both songs are made by Esa Helasvuo. There's even a nice break on the Spinning wheel cover Pyörä pyörii. Unfortunately this is a scarce 45 and quite hard to find.\n\nPyörä Pyörii\n\nVoit yksin kaiken muuttaa\n\nMaarit - Herään eiliseen\n\nMAARIT / PEPE WILLBERG\n\nHerään eiliseen\n\nKodak KOD 1\n\n1976\n\n7\" advertisement record\n\nWhen celebrating the 10th anniversary of Kodak products in Finland, they released this 45 in 1976. Originally Kodak film created an advertising campaign in 1975 that featured Paul Anka singing a jingle entitled Times of your life and Herään eiliseen is a cover of it. There's the same song on both sides, but with a totally different versions. The b-side version by Pepe Willberg is a slow ballad, but the a-side by Maarit is a really funky modern soul number with nice vocals. I guess they pressed this single with quite a big quantity as it's not that hard to find.\n\nLasse Mårtenson - Miltä meno maistuu\n\nLASSE MÅRTENSON\n\nMiltä meno maistuu / Yksityisjuttu\n\nScandia KS905\n\n1973\n\n7\"\n\nHere's a really nice double sider from Lasse Mårtenson. A-side song is a cover of Lou Reed's Walk on the wild side that follow the original quite strictly. Even the lyrics are of the same topic. B-side song instead is a cover of Syreeta's To know you is to love you that was written by Stevie Wonder and Syreeta Wright. Besides this 45, Miltä meno maistuu has also been released on Huipulla 5 compilation (Scandia 1973). Yksityisjuttu is only on this 45, which is semi hard to find.\n\nMiltä meno maistuu\n\nYksityisjuttu\n\nJakke ja Jokke - Tunteen sain\n\nJAKKE JA JOKKE\n\nTeillä tuulen / Tunteen sain\n\nDelta DES 18\n\n1976\n\n7\"\n\nBeautiful ballad Loving you by Minnie Riperton gets a Finnish treatment here by brothers Jakke and Jokke (Jarmo and Jorma Seppälä). The Finnish version is called Tunteen sain (I got the feeling in English) and it's really close to the original one. Even the high pitch vocals are done quite well on the chorus despite the fact that the song is sung by a male singer. There's also another cover of the song from the same year sung by female singer Seija Simola. This song appears also on their LP Kaksi Seppälää (Delta 1976) and the Huippuhittejä 4 compilation (Delta 1976). These are all pretty easy to find for a cheap price. The a-side song Teillä tuulen is a Finnish cover of Alta mira by Edgar Winter Group.\n\nCumulus - Noustaan perhosilla lentämään\n\nCUMULUS\n\nNoustaan perhosilla lentämään / Voin rakkauden antaa\n\nTop Voice TOP 70\n\n1973\n\n7\"\n\nCumulus was a Finnish folk group formed in 1969 by Anki Lindqvist, Cay Karlsson, Hector and Sakari Lehtinen. Mostly their music was typical folk, but occasionally they had a really good groove going on. Like in this one, a Eurovision Song Contest national nominee from 1973, they really hit it. Too bad they didn't win the Finnish trials and didn't get to the contest. Noustaan perhosilla lentämään is a really groovy uptempo percussion driven folk-funk song that you can listen again and again. Both tracks in this 45 are composed by Valto Laitinen and arranged by Jörgen Petersen. Again, this song is only released on this 45 and on a compilation, Kootut Teokset 7 (Blue Master 1973). The 45 is pretty scarce nowadays but the compilation LP is much easier to find.\n\nCumulus in Eurovision Song Contest Finnish trials 1973.\n\nJouko ja Kosti - Salapoliisin tytär\n\nJOUKO JA KOSTI\n\nMenee mikä menee / Salapoliisin tytär\n\nPolydor NH 59516\n\n1969\n\n7\"\n\nBrothers Jouko and Kosti Saari formed this duo and started their recording career in 1968. Salapoliisin tytär is from their second 45 release in 1969. The song is a cover of Dusty Springfield classic Son of a preacher man, although in this case the lyrics are about the daughter of a private eye. As it was normal back then, the arrangements made by Paroni Paakkunainen are pretty conventional and follow the original all the way. That don't matter of course, because the original is also pretty damn good song. Menee mikä menee on the b-side is a cover of A good thing going by Engelbert Humperdinck. The 45 is pretty easy to find for a reasonable price and the song also appears on the duo's self titled album Jouko ja Kosti (Finnlevy 1969) and the Toivekonsertti 37 compilation (Rytmi 1969).\n\nPaula Koivuniemi - Sä et suurennella saa\n\nPAULA KOIVUNIEMI\n\nSä et suurennella saa / Laulun sain matkallein\n\nBlue Master MPS 540\n\n1974\n\n7\"\n\nWhat we have here is a Finnish cover of Stevie Wonder's Don't you worry 'bout a thing performed by Paula Koivuniemi. The song is quite similar to the original, a strong latin groover with the arrangements done by Matti and Pirjo Bergström. As it was usual in those days, it's a 45 only release for the artist, but also compiled on the Kootut teokset 12 - Kuuma kesä kanssain jaa compilation (Blue Master 1974). The b-side song is a cover of Born with a smile on my face by Simon May. Not too hard to find for a quite cheap price.\n\nKeijo Minerva - Taikausko\n\nKEIJO MINERVA\n\nTaikausko / Salli veit satasein\n\nEMI 5e006-35088\n\n1975\n\n7\"\n\nTaikausko is a groovy cover of Stevie Wonder standard Superstition sung - of course - in Finnish. There's three different versions of Finnish Superstition-covers and I consider this one to be the best overall. The song starts with a 16 bar open drum break almost identical to the original and continues as a groovy guitar driven funky track just like the Stevie one. The lyrics by Raul Reiman are quite fierce with stories of spiritism, emergency baptisms, agony and magic. Same lyrics are also used in the other version of the song recorded by Aaron. This 45 is quite hard to find, especially with the picture cover. The song is also relased on Mukavaa musaa 9 compilation (Odeon 1975) which is much easier to find. B-side song Salli veit satasein is a cover of Judy teen by Steve Harley."
