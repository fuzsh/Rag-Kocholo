        "text": "Billie Burke was born Mary William Ethelbert Appleton Burke on August 7, 1885 in Washington, D.C. Her father was a circus clown, and as a child she toured the United States and Europe with the circus (before motion pictures and after the stage, circuses were the biggest form of entertainment in the world). One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city's historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress. At age 18, she made her stage debut and her career was off and running. Her performances were very well received and she became one of the most popular actresses to grace the stage. Broadway beckoned, and since New York City was now recognized as the stage capital of the world, it was there she would try her luck. Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum did not stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916). The film was a hit, but then again most films were, as the novelty of motion pictures had not worn off since Der große Eisenbahnraub (1903) at the turn of the century. Later that year, she appeared in Gloria's Romance (1916). In between cinema work, she would take her place on the stage because not only was it her first love, but she had speaking parts. Billie considered herself more than an actress--she felt she was an artist, too. She believed that the stage was a way to personally reach out to an audience, something that could not be done in pictures. In 1921, she appeared as Elizabeth Banks in The Education of Elizabeth (1921), then she retired. She had wed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. of the famed Ziegfeld Follies and, with investments in the stock market, there was no need to work.\n\nWhat the Ziegfelds did not plan on was \"Black October\" in 1929. Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in Eine Scheidung (1932). As an artist, she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O. Selznick's Dinner um acht (1933), co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore and Jean Harlow - heady company to be sure, but Billie turned in an outstanding performance as Mrs. Jordan, the scatterbrained wife of a man whose shipping company is in financial trouble and who was trying to get someone to loan his company money to help stave off disaster. Her character loved to give dinner parties because a dinner affair at the Jordans had a reputation among New York blue-blood society as the highlight of the season. With all the drama and intrigue going on around her, her main concern is that she is one man short of having a full seating arrangement. The film was a hit and once again Billie was back on top. In 1937, she had one of her most fondly remembered roles in Das blonde Gespenst (1937), a film that would ultimately spin off two sequels, and all three were box-office hits. In 1938, Billie received her first and only Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Emily Kilbourne in Wie leben wir doch glücklich! (1938). This was probably the best performance of her screen career, but she was destined to be immortalized forever in the classic Das zauberhafte Land (1939). At 54 years of age - and not looking anywhere near it - she played Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. The 1940s saw Billie busier than ever--she made 25 films between 1940 and 1949. She made only six in the 1950s, as her aging became noticeable. She was 75 when she made her final screen appearance as Cordelia Fosgate in John Ford's Western Der schwarze Sergeant (1960). Billie retired for good and lived in Los Angeles, California, where she died at age 85 of natural causes on May 14, 1970.\n\nBreno Silveira is a Brazilian film director with an outstanding career in movies, music videos, and television commercials. A partner of Conspiração Filmes, Breno has a degree in cinematography from École Louis-Lumière in Paris and began his career as director of photography, having signed the photography of more than ten feature films. His first feature, \"Dois Filhos de Francisco\" (\"Two Sons of Francisco\"), launched in 2005, stands as one of the biggest blockbusters of the past 25 years in Brazil, having reached a public of more than 5.3 million people in theaters, and was the Brazilian candidate for the Oscars that year. He has also directed \"Era Uma Vez\" (\"Once Upon a Time in Rio\"), 2008, selected for the Toronto International Film Festival; \"À Beira do Caminho\" (\"Along the Way\"), 2012, winner of 5 awards in the Cine PE Festival, including best film, best screenplay and best actor; \"Gonzaga - de Pai pra Filho\" (\"Gonzaga\"), 2012, winner of 5 Grand Awards of the Brazilian Cinema, including best film, best director and best actor. In 2016 Breno created and directed his first television series, \"1 Contra Todos\" (\"One Against All\"), the most seen Brazilian series on paid TV within Brazil, and second in ratings only to \"The Walking Dead\" on Fox channel. \"1 Contra Todos\" raised Fox's prime time audience in 74% and received an International Emmy® Awards nomination.\n\nFollowing this achievement, the series is now on its third season and Fox is developing an international remake. Breno's latest work, \"Entre Irmãs\" (\"The Seamstress\"), 2017, a feature film and a short series on Rede Globo (Brazil's largest TV network), was the most successful show in Brazilian television in the past 20 years, having reached a public of more than 84 million people.\n\nFormer actress Eva Norvind was an independent film and video producer as well as a psycho-sexual counselor in New York City. She was born Eva Johanne Chegodayeva Sakonskaya in Trondheim, Norway, on May 7th, 1944, the daughter of Russian refugee Prince Paulovic Chegodayef Sakonsky and a Norwegian sculptress Johanna Kajanus. Besides the name Eva Norvind, she has also worked under the pseudonyms Ava Taurel and Eva Hultgreen.\n\nHaving moved to France at age 15 with her family, she entered the field of entertainment when she won the second prize in the beauty contest at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival where the reward was a minor role as a German tourist in Marcel Moussy's Amour in St. Tropez (1961). Shortly thereafter Eva changed her name to Eva Norvind when she became a showgirl at the Follies Bergere and began acting at the Comedie Francaise.\n\nIn 1962 Eva moved to Canada and then to New York City, where she worked as a showgirl and Can-Can dancer in cabarets, as well as a lunch-time Playboy bunny. Upon finishing high school in 1964 she took a bus to Mexico City to study Spanish over the summer and was recruited by a television producer to act a small part in a TV variety show. Because of her Nordic beauty, voluptuous figure, and daring attitude she rapidly became a film actress and a sex symbol in the Mexican media.\n\nAfter her first Mexican film, 'Nuestros buenos vecinos de Yucatan' (1965), made in 1965, Eva went on to act in six more films over the next three years; Esta noche no (1966), followed by her first co-starring role in Pacto de sangre (1966), and Juan Pistolas (1966), where she played the sheriff's wife opposite Javier Solis. Other films include Santo contra la invasion de los marcianos (1966), Baname mi amor (1966), and her last Mexican film Don Juan 67 (1966), with Mauricio Garces.\n\nAfter a highly publicized scandal in 1966 when she spoke of birth control on national TV, the Mexican government ordered Eva to leave the country within 24 hours. With help from the actors union she was able to remain in Mexico, but was forbidden all work on television for one year and any kind of work for 4 months. She did return to the theatre, acting in 'En el Closet, no' and Machiavelli's 'La Mandragola.'\n\nIn 1968, still living in Mexico, she became a freelance photographer covering fashion and celebrity news in Paris and New York. She also worked as a journalist specializing in film, covered international film festivals and got Latin American exclusives with major Hollywood talent from Paramount and Universal Pictures. She then worked in film distribution, buying European films for the Mexican Cineteca and selling Mexican films to Scandinavian Television.\n\nIn 1980, Eva returned to New York to study film production at NYU, where she received her BFA in 1982. She produced shorts and promotional films within the health field, and worked as associate producer of feature films in the development stage with Ziegler Films in Berlin and the Kibbutz Association in Israel.\n\nIn 1985, she became fascinated with the exploration of erotic power exchange and invented a pseudonym for herself as dominatrix Ava Taurel. In 1987 she founded Taurel Enterprises, Inc, the umbrella company for counseling, erotic role play and video production for health related services. She gave lectures at national conferences worldwide, to both health professionals and lay audiences. In 1996 she received her MA in Human Sexuality and Health Education from NYU and pursued graduate studies in Forensic Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nHer controversial life and work has been documented in many books and feature films; In 1996 she was featured in 'Whipped', a documentary by Iana Porter and Sasha Waters which premiered at The Chicago Underground Film Festival and was screened at the Anthology Film Archives in NYC two years later. In 1997, feminist filmmaker Monika Treut made 'Didn't Do It for Love' (1997), a documentary about Eva's life, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, followed by the Berlin International Film Festival, among others.\n\nIn 1999, Eva appeared in 'Tops & Bottoms' (1999), by Christine Richie. She has been featured in many magazines as well as books like 'How to Be Hap Hap Happy Like Me' by Merrill Markoe, Marianne Macy's 'Working Sex' (1996), Bill and Gloria Brame's 'Different Loving', and Luisa Valenzuela's 'La travesia' (2002) and 'Black Novel with Argentines' (2003).\n\nIn 1999, John McTiernan hired her to coach Rene Russo for her assertive sexual image in 'The Thomas Crown Affair' for which she got screen credit.\n\nIn 2002, she was featured in a documentary film directed by Radovan Tadic, made for French and German cable television. She recently optioned a screenplay by Tadic for a feature film that she planned to produce with him as director.\n\nEva lived in New York and Connecticut but travelled frequently. She was fluent in English, French, Spanish, German, Swedish and Norwegian, and conversed in Russian and Italian. She was the sister of Georg Kajanus, London based singer and composer, and she was the single mother of Mexican actress Nailea Norvind.\n\nAt the time of her death, Eva was making a documentary about severely handicapped Mexican actor and musician Jose Flores, entitled 'Born Without'.\n\nFrank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey. With the help of George Evans (Sinatra's genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in Urlaub in Hollywood (1945) with Gene Kelly, a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In (1945). His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical Das ist New York (1949) and Spiel zu dritt (1949). A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Zu allem entschlossen (1952), and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Der Attentäter (1954). Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama Der Mann mit dem goldenen Arm (1955).\n\nKnown as \"One-Take Charlie\" for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Schwere Jungen, leichte Mädchen (1955), Schicksalsmelodie (1957) and Verdammt sind sie alle (1958). In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as Eine Nummer zu groß (1959), Die siegreichen Drei (1962) and the very successful Sieben gegen Chicago (1964). Lighter roles alongside \"Rat Pack\" buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960). On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as Botschafter der Angst (1962), regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture Der Lohn der Mutigen (1965), which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year Colonel von Ryans Expreß (1965) was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie's Der Mann am Draht (1967), once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in Der Schnüffler (1967), a role he reprised in the sequel, Die Lady in Zement (1968). He also starred with Lee Remick in Der Detektiv (1968), a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success.\n\nAfter appearing in the poorly received comic western Dirty Dingus, der scharfe Bandit (1970), Sinatra didn't act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller Das Cherry-Street-Fiasko (1977), which he also produced. Based on the novel by William Rosenberg, this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in Die erste Todsünde (1980), once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in Auf dem Highway ist wieder die Hölle los (1984) and a final acting performance in Magnum (1980), in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled Laura (1987)."
