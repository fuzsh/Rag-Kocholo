According to the license, Sven's parents were Lars Larson and Berte Oleson in Norway and Christina's parents were Jacob Oleson and Gari Peterson, also born in Norway. There was no indication of locale, though I seem to remember my mother telling me that Sven came from somewhere near Trondheim or Bergen. I have not been able to determine when either immigrated, but from family stories it seems Sven probably arrived in northern Wisconsin during or just before the American Civil War. I know that's not much to go on, and I would appreciate any leads! Family records trace back the other parts of my ancestry back to the early 17th century, and I would like to find the rest of the branches!

They were Carl James CARELIUSEN (dob 28 January 1882 in Nes), Louise Caroline CARELIUSEN (LARSEN) (dob 24 December 1881) in Hamar and their daughter Kirsten (DOB 7 November 1903 possible Oslo). They left Norway in 1912 and were passengers on the \"Corinthic\" from London to Wellington, New Zealand. Carl had a sister Mina and a brother but lost contact after WW2. The spelling of the surname could also be KARELIUSEN, it was changed to Carlinson in NZ. If anyone has the Census for 1891 could they check if these names are listed. Also if anyone has maps of these areas they would be most appreciated. If anyone else in Australia is tracing their families and could offer ideas on where to find information it would be most helpful. Thanks very much. Your web page is a great idea.\n\nDi Christensen - 04/17/98 06:32:45\n\nMy Email:[email protected]\n\nComments:\n\nHave just found your site today.

I would be grateful for any information on the following persons and any descendants of theirs: 1. LOUISE MARIE CHRISTIANSEN my maternal grandmother's older sister, born 1878 in Christianina (Oslo) Norway, emigrated to the US on board the steamer \"Hekla\" of the Thingvalla Line leaving Christiania on the 2 September 1896. Her ultimate destination was Chicago but she went via New York where she must have arrived Ellis Island about 16 September, give or take a few days. In the US she married a man by name Powers and as LOVA POWERS she gained some repute as a singer and pianist. She either became widowed or divorced from Mr. Powers and later married FRANK DREW. Accordingly, she changed her name to LOVA DREW and continued her musical career. She died from cancer of the stomach in a Chicago hospital on 10 May 1928 and was buried on the 13 May. Shortly afterwards an obitua y appeared in one of the papers paying tribute to her musical talents. She left a daughter called JUNE born 18 June 1913, probably with Drew as surname. 2. Lova's maternal cousin was also called LOUISE with maiden name MICHELSEN She was born 7 May 1882 or 1889 (data are conflicting) in Christiania, married surname unknown, and wrote to her mother in Norway and told of Lova's death. Louise was at the time married and settled in Chicago. Her husbands first name is likely to ave been Carl.. The second name is more uncertain, but ther is a remote chance that it may have been BERGQUIST. They lived in a house with a garden, probably on the South Side of Chicago and had two children ERNA and MARY JANE. Judging from the fact that they both had survived the measles prior to Lova's funeral, their birth year is assumed to be 1921 and 1925 respectively, give or take a few years. Louise had a sister in Norway called Betzy born 1882 in Christiania. Their father was the opera-sin er Bernt Christian Michelsen born 1848 in Christiania, and their mother was called Josefine born 1858 in Aas just outside Oslo. Louise may be identical to LOUISE BERGQUIST Born 7 May 1892 who died Sep 1984 last address 60056 Arlington Heights, Cook, IL, but is is at best a good guess. PETE OVESEN, baptised PEDER CARLSEN my maternal grandfathers younger brother born 18 June 1890 in Christiania. He was baptised Peder, called Per when he lived in Norway and later changed his name to Pete Ovesen after his father Ove Emil Carlsen. Quite young he emigrated to America, and so e evidence points towards him starting a general delivery service at , Prince Rupert, BC , Canada. It may not have lasted so long and he came to Chicago where it is believed that he found employment with General Electric Company as a janitor. He married Norwegian widowed immigrant by first name Marie, believed to be born in Drammen. She had a child from the previous marriage that might have been a son called Reidar or it could be a daughter called Lena who married Reidar. For some time in th 20's or 30's Pete and Marie lived in Metropole Street in Chicago. Marie was blessed with two grandchildren, Billy born round 1944 and Julie round 1947 give or take a couple of years. Pete died 5 January 1953 and was survived by Marie. It is not kno n whether he knew or was aquatinted with Luise and Lova Marie may be identical to MARIE OVESEN born 31 May 1892, died Jun 1975 last known address 60641 (Chicago, Cook, IL), Soc sec no 343-03-3453. I'd be grateful if somebody can shed any light on the subject. Best regards Geir Ottesen , Asker , Norway.

I am looking for information on the ancestors of John HERMANSEN who was born in Trondheim, Norway, on April 1, 1846, and died in North Prairie, Minnesota, on May 3, 1925. His father's name listed on his death record was Herman Hermansen. The mother's name was unknown. That is very sketchy information but perhaps someone with a church record or a bygdebok can shed some light on that for me.\n\nScott Seilstad - 04/09/98 03:19:03\n\nMy Email:[email protected]\n\nComments:\n\nI am looking for relatives in Norway that came from the Gudbrandsdalen area in Fron, Oppland county.

My maternal great-grandparents emmigrated to the US in 1901. Their names were Petter Johannessen UNDERDAHL, born 1861 in Aurland and Ingeborg Oline Pedersen UNDERDAHL, born 1879 in Laerdal. They settled in Minnesota where my grandfather, Alfred Anfelt UNDERDAHL, was born 1-31-02 in the town of Wells. This was their first child and I don't know if there were any others. My grandfather, who was estranged from his family after my mother was born, died in Detroit 10-86. Possibly my great-grandmother died in Idaho in 1973. This is all the information I have and would be grateful for any other information or guidance on how to proceed further. There must be other Underdahl's out there. Thanks so much.\n\narie beemer - 04/08/98 16:51:33\n\nComments:\n\nhi! you are doing a great job, keep it up!\n\nOddstein Steffensen - 04/08/98 06:50:06\n\nMy Email:[email protected]\n\nComments:\n\nJust surfed in.
