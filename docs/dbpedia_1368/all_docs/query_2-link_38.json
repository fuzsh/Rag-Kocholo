        "text": "THE REITH FAMILY: CONTINUITY AND CONNECTION\n\nFor corrections, additions, comments, email:\n\nDavid Reith: [email protected]\n\nWelcome to the 2009 version of a family record that I maintained for five years in the mid-1980's. The directory has changed from a photocopied to an electronic format, but I have maintained the same information. In the many years since I last did this, events like births and deaths, marriages and divorces, graduations and new jobs, changes of address and retirements have all occurred. Please help me update these events and keep the record current by post or email. On October 26, 2009, Geocities, which hosts this site, will shut it down; I cannot put personal information on my university page, so please let me know if you are aware of another host so we can continue the electronic format. The mini-family reunion hosted by Paul and Deb in Warsaw in September, 2009, when the Link family from Germany was visiting helped immensely in getting us together again and inspired me to try to update this record. Thanks for the occasion, Paul and Debbie. Now it's time to have a full Reith family reunion in 2010. The basic criterion I used previously in deciding whom to include was the surname: anyone who was born into the Reith family or married into the family and carried the name at one time or another was included. I know this is a very paternalistic approach and probably not a currently acceptable sociological or political method; if someone has a better idea, let me know. The quick rule is that if you are a Reith, were a Reith, or your mother was a Reith, you are included. However, certain problems present themselves in determining whom to include and there are always exceptions: 1. How far should records extend when a female Reith marries outside the family and takes a new family name? Are her children Reith members? Her grandchildren? Her husband? What I have done: I have included her children but stopped at that generation. The husband is included with the Reith wife and notes about him may be included in that entry. 2. Conversely, how far back should we go in defining the family? That is, I have a record for Franz Liebich, Grandmother Ida's father. Is he a member of the family? What I have done: nothing because there are insufficient records to worry about the problem yet. 3. Are children of females who marry into the family considered Reith family members? What I have done: I have included them. 4. What happens when a female marries a Reith but does not use the Reith name? Is she a member of the family? What I have done: I have included her. 5. What happens when a female who has married into the family divorces? What I have done: Most likely the name will be deleted from the database, even if she continues to use the Reith name. 6. How do I identify the parents of a Reith family member when the mother divorces and does/does not retain the Reith name? What I have done: I probably will maintain the name as a parent for the children's entries, separating the parents' names with a semicolon (rather than using \"and\") and using whatever surname I have for her, prefacing any new name with \"Reith.\" 7. Is the husband of a female Reith who marries and assumes a new name a member of the Reith family? That's a tough call: he's never been nor will be a Reith, but in fact could be closer \"family\" than even biological members. What I have done: I have excluded them but usually make a note about them or their contributions as part of the wife's entry. This is not cast in stone nor is it sacred. 8. What happens to the adopted child of a female Reith who marries and takes a new name? The child is not biologically a Reith, nor is the family name Reith, though the adopting mother is biologically a Reith. What I have done: I will leave the decision to the parent. It is an interesting commentary on both economic development and longevity that remarriages complicate our genealogy. In the early part of our family's history, the remarriages were occasioned by death; in our more recent history, the remarriages have been occasioned by divorce. In time, I will add an index, an .html function to go immediately to a name, and some kind of search capability. Until then, it will be a bit cumbersome to find a person, but anyone who was previously listed (and one or two whom I missed) are here. Perhaps some kind of password that would permit only members of the Reith family to access the information would also be possible, but I will need some help from the techies among you. I am not a genealogist and do not know how to construct a family chart; please help me if you have talent in that area. The order of names here generally follows that in the previous hardcopy editions, though I have begun to do a little grouping, with many of the deceased members (indicated by a \"+\" preceding the name) entered first and I have put some families together. I will also print this out after it has been substantially revised and make a limited number of hard copies, as before, and send them out; they can be easily photocopied at your local Kinko's if you prefer that format. In the meantime, click here for a tentative alphabetical name list. To search for any name otherwise, use \"control\" + \"f\" and type in the name. Here are some sources for genealogy: Obituary records in the Kokomo Tribune Albright Cemetery (includes headstone images) Crown Point Cemetery (includes headstone images) Sunset Memorial Gardens (includes headstone images) Social Security Death Index (lower part) Index to Vital Records in the Kokomo Tribune I have created a website for posting pictures of Reith family members; after you access the site, you have to enter \"reithfamily\" as a password to view the pictures. Please email pictures to me if you would not mind being included; I will include each photo as a link in your entry in this directory. (A single left click on each picture will enlarge it and display a caption; another left click will enlarge the picture further, but you lose the caption then.) Lastly, many of us received a memoir from Uncle John Reith that detailed life as he grew up on Vaile Avenue in Kokomo. For those who do not have it any longer or did not receive it, Susan, Chris, Tim, and Cathy found the digital record of those memoirs and allowed me to add it to this collection; it is found separately at http://www.geocities.com/jereithmemoirs.pdf and makes absolutely fascinating reading of the Reith family history.
