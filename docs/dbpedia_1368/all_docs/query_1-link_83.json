This study investigated genetic variation in STAT3 promoter regions and verified their contribution to bovine body size traits. We first estimated the degree of conservation in STAT3, followed by measurements of its mRNA expression during fetal and adult stages of Qinchuan cattle. We then sequenced the STAT3 promoter region to determine genetic variants and evaluate their association with body size traits. From fetus to adult, STAT3 expression increased significantly in muscle, fat, heart, liver, and spleen tissues ( p < 0.01), but decreased in the intestine, lung, and rumen ( p < 0.01). We identified and named five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): SNP1-304A>C, SNP2-285G>A, SNP3-209A>C, SNP4-203A>G, and SNP5-188T>C. These five mutations fell significantly outside the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (Chi-squared test, p < 0.05) and significantly associated with body size traits ( p < 0.05). Individuals with haplotype H3H3 (CC-GG-CC-GG-CC) were larger in body size than other haplotypes. Therefore, variations in the STAT3 gene promoter regions, most notably haplotype H3H3, may benefit marker-assisted breeding of Qinchuan cattle.\n\nGenetic Variants in STAT3 Promoter Regions and Their Application in Molecular Breeding for Body Size Traits in Qinchuan Cattle\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Yaning; Ning, Yue; Guo, Hongfang; Wang, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Le; Cheng, Gong; Wang, Hongbao; Zan, Linsen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a critical role in leptin-mediated regulation of energy metabolism.

This study aimed to examine the 737/738 marker, a cytosine-adenine repeat in the promoter region of the IGF-I gene polymorphism, and plasma IGF-I levels in Japanese infants and analyze the genetic background. Data were collected for 15 months in Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. The body composition parameters of all infants were determined at birth. At 5 days after birth, we took blood samples to measure the product size of the promoter region of the IGF-I gene polymorphism and plasma IGF-I. In a population-based sample of 160 subjects, 6 different alleles and 16 genotypes were identified in the promoter region of the IGF-I gene polymorphism. The existence of a 196-bp allele has proved to result in a low plasma IGF-I level, a small head and chest circumference (p < 0.05) and no significant for premature birth, short-birth height and low-birth weight. This is the first study showing the role of the promoter region of the IGF-I gene polymorphism and the level of plasma IGF-I and body composition parameters in Japanese infants. Our results suggest genetical influence on prenatal growth and serum IGF-I levels.\n\nIncreased fire frequency promotes stronger spatial genetic structure and natural selection at regional and local scales in Pinus halepensis Mill.\n\nPubMed\n\nBudde, Katharina B; GonzÃ¡lez-MartÃ­nez, Santiago C; NavascuÃ©s, Miguel; Burgarella, Concetta; Mosca, Elena; Lorenzo, Zaida; Zabal-Aguirre, Mario; Vendramin, Giovanni G; VerdÃº, Miguel; Pausas, Juli G; Heuertz, Myriam\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe recurrence of wildfires is predicted to increase due to global climate change, resulting in severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Recurrent fires can drive plant adaptation and reduce genetic diversity; however, the underlying population genetic processes have not been studied in detail. In this study, the neutral and adaptive evolutionary effects of contrasting fire regimes were examined in the keystone tree species Pinus halepensis Mill. (Aleppo pine), a fire-adapted conifer. The genetic diversity, demographic history and spatial genetic structure were assessed at local (within-population) and regional scales for populations exposed to different crown fire frequencies. Eight natural P. halepensis stands were sampled in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, five of them in a region exposed to frequent crown fires (HiFi) and three of them in an adjacent region with a low frequency of crown fires (LoFi). Samples were genotyped at nine neutral simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and at 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from coding regions, some of them potentially important for fire adaptation. Fire regime had no effects on genetic diversity or demographic history. Three high-differentiation outlier SNPs were identified between HiFi and LoFi stands, suggesting fire-related selection at the regional scale. At the local scale, fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) was overall weak as expected for a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed tree species. HiFi stands displayed a stronger SGS than LoFi stands at SNPs, which probably reflected the simultaneous post-fire recruitment of co-dispersed related seeds. SNPs with exceptionally strong SGS, a proxy for microenvironmental selection, were only reliably identified under the HiFi regime. An increasing fire frequency as predicted due to global change can promote increased SGS with stronger family structures and alter natural selection in P. halepensis and in plants with similar life history traits\n\nIncreased fire frequency promotes stronger spatial genetic structure and natural selection at regional and local scales in Pinus halepensis Mill\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-MartÃ­nez, Santiago C.; NavascuÃ©s, Miguel; Burgarella, Concetta; Mosca, Elena; Lorenzo, Zaida; Zabal-Aguirre, Mario; Vendramin, Giovanni G.; VerdÃº, Miguel; Pausas, Juli G.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and Aims The recurrence of wildfires is predicted to increase due to global climate change, resulting in severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

The current study investigates genome-wide promoter DNA methylation alterations in the sperm of F3 generation rats whose F0 generation mother was exposed to vinclozolin. A methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with methyl-cytosine antibody followed by a promoter tilling microarray (MeDIP-Chip) procedure was used to identify 52 different regions with statistically significant altered methylation in the sperm promoter epigenome. Mass spectrometry bisulfite analysis was used to map the CpG DNA methylation and 16 differential DNA methylation regions were confirmed, while the remainder could not be analyzed due to bisulfite technical limitations. Analysis of these validated regions identified a consensus DNA sequence (motif) that associated with 75% of the promoters. Interestingly, only 16.8% of a random set of 125 promoters contained this motif. One candidate promoter (Fam111a) was found to be due to a copy number variation (CNV) and not a methylation change, suggesting initial alterations in the germline epigenome may promote genetic abnormalities such as induced CNV in later generations. This study identifies differential DNA methylation sites in promoter regions three generations after the initial exposure and identifies common genome features present in these regions. In addition to primary epimutations, a potential indirect genetic abnormality was identified, and both are postulated to be involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance observed. This study confirms that an environmental agent has the ability to induce epigenetic transgenerational changes in the sperm epigenome.

Furthermore, CCK modulates the release of dopamine and dopamine-related behaviors in the mesolimbic pathway. In our study, genetic variation in the promoter and coding regions of the prepro-CCK gene were analyzed among 66 Japanese, 66 American Whites, 54 Chinese, and 41 Colombian natives. Two nucleotide sequence variants were found: a frequent mutation at nucleotide position -45 C to T involved in core sequence of Sp1 binding cis-element of the promoter region, and a C to T substitution at the 1662 position in intron 2. Analysis for the segregation study in 10 families of twins confirmed codominant heredity of two alleles. Distribution of genotypes and gene frequencies of 66 controls and 108 alcoholics in Japan presented that allelic variant T type in alcoholics was found in higher frequencies than that of controls, and distribution of these genotypes was significantly different between the both groups.\n\nGenetic analysis of the dsz promoter and associated regulatory regions of Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, M Z; Squires, C H; Monticello, D J; Childs, J D\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe dsz gene cluster of Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 comprises three genes, dszA, dszB, and dszC, whose products are involved in the conversion of dibenzothiophene (DBT) to 2-hydroxybiphenyl and sulfite. This organism can use DBT as the sole sulfur source but not as a carbon source. Dsz activity is repressed by methionine, cysteine, Casamino Acids, and sulfate but not by DBT or dimethyl sulfoxide. We cloned 385 bp of the DNA immediately 5' to dszA in front of the reporter gene lacZ of Escherichia coli. We showed that this region contains a Rhodococcus promoter and at least three dsz regulatory regions. After hydrazine mutagenesis of this DNA, colonies that were able to express beta-galactosidase in the presence of Casamino Acids were isolated. Sequencing of these mutants revealed two possible regulatory regions. One is at -263 to -244, and the other is at -93 to -38, where -1 is the base preceding the A of the initiation codon ATG of dszA. An S1 nuclease protection assay showed that the start of the dsz promoter is the G at -46 and that transcription is repressed by sulfate and cysteine but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. The promoter encompasses a region of potential diad symmetry that may contain an operator. Immediately upstream of the promoter is a protein-binding domain between -146 and -121. Deletion of this region did not affect repression, but promoter activity appeared to be reduced by threefold. Thus, it could be an activator binding site or an enhancer region.

We investigate the population genetics of Ptilotus macrocephalus, a perennial herb that occurs in 2 nationally endangered communities on the Victorian Volcanic Plain Bioregion (VVP), Australia, to answer key questions regarding regional differentiation and to guide conservation strategies. We evaluate genetic structure and diversity within and among 17 P. macrocephalus populations from 3 regions of southeastern Australia using 17 microsatellite markers developed de novo. Genetic structure was present in P. macrocephalus between the 3 regions but not at the population level. Environmental factors, namely temperature and precipitation, significantly explained differentiation between the North region and the other 2 regions indicating isolation by environment. Within regions, genetic structure currently shows a high level of gene flow and genetic variation. Our results suggest that within-region gene flow does not reflect current habitat fragmentation in southeastern Australia whereas temperature and precipitation are likely to be responsible for the differentiation detected among regions. Climate change may severely impact P. macrocephalus on the VVP and test its evolutionary resilience. We suggest taking a proactive conservation approach to improve long-term viability by sourcing material for restoration to assist gene flow to the VVP region to promote an increased adaptive capacity.

At the present time there is no national policy for genetic medicine in Italy, and only two regions, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria, have formally agreed to a strategic plan for health care in genetics. The current provision of genetic services in Emilia-Romagna is described focusing on the intra- and inter-organizational linkages to ensure a comprehensive system of coordinated activities. Strengths and implementation areas are highlighted. Points that must be solved within the regional or national context are the definition of the level of assistance required in genetic medicine, the formal professional recognition of the genetic counselor and the adjustment of the billing mechanisms to the complexities of clinical genetic services. Issues that need to be addressed at a wider level include full assessment of genetic tests before their introduction into clinical practice, networking to provide tests for the rarest genetic diseases, consensus on fundamental terminology and clinical and administrative data sets to promote a cohesive framework for the flow of information throughout the health care systems with respect to genetics.

Despite the fact that loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene, encoding kindlin-1, have been shown to cause the syndrome in numerous patients, a small number of typical cases of KS in which FERMT1 mutations could not be identified has raised the possibility that the disorder may be genetically heterogeneous. To assess two highly consanguineous families with clinical characteristics of KS. In the first family, a hitherto unreported deletion (c.137-140delTAGT) in FERMT1 was detected, which is predicted to lead to premature termination of translation. However, direct sequencing of the coding region of FERMT1 failed to disclose any pathogenic change in the second family. To confirm the possibility that the disease in this family may be due to a mutation in another gene, we used homozygosity mapping, and found that all affected family members share a segment of homozygosity on 20p12.3, spanning the FERMT1 gene. Accordingly, a large and highly unusual deletion (g.-711-1241del) spanning the putative FERMT1 promoter sequence and the first noncoding exon of the gene was found to cosegregate with the disease phenotype in this family, and to prevent transcription of the gene, as attested by the lack of FERMT1 message in the skin of a patient. The present data provide evidence in support of genetic homogeneity in KS.

We report that a central effector of apoptosis, caspase 3, facilitates, rather than suppresses, chemical and radiation-induced genetic instability and carcinogenesis. We found that a significant fraction of mammalian cells treated with ionizing radiation can survive, despite caspase 3 activation. Moreover, this sublethal activation of caspase 3 promoted persistent DNA damage and oncogenic transformation. In addition, chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis was significantly reduced in mice genetically deficient in caspase 3. Furthermore, attenuation of Endo G activity significantly reduced radiation-induced DNA damage and oncogenic transformation, identifying Endo G as a downstream effector of caspase 3 in this pathway. Our findings suggest that rather than acting as a broad inhibitor of carcinogenesis, caspase 3 activation may contribute to genome instability and play a pivotal role in tumor formation following damage.

Previously, we found considerable overlap between patterns of promoter region tumour suppressor gene (TSG) hypermethylation in two neural crest tumours, neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma. In order to identify candidate biomarkers and epigenetically inactivated TSGs in phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, we characterised changes in gene expression in three neuroblastoma cell lines after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. Promoter region methylation status was then determined for 28 genes that demonstrated increased expression after demethylation. Three genes HSP47, homeobox A9 (HOXA9) and opioid binding protein (OPCML) were methylated in >10% of phaeochromocytomas (52, 17 and 12% respectively). Two of the genes, epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) and HSP47, demonstrated significantly more frequent methylation in neuroblastoma than phaeochromocytoma. These findings extend epigenotype of phaeochromocytoma and identify candidate genes implicated in sporadic phaeochromocytoma tumourigenesis.

However, it is still problematic to efficiently select the adequate promoters, Ribosome Binding Sides (RBSs) and inducer concentrations to construct a genetic transistor with the desired linear amplification or switching in the Input/Output (I/O) characteristics for practical applications. Three kinds of promoter-RBS libraries, i.e., a constitutive promoter-RBS library, a repressor-regulated promoter-RBS library and an activator-regulated promoter-RBS library, are constructed for systematic genetic circuit design using the identified kinetic strengths of their promoter-RBS components.According to the dynamic model of genetic transistors, a design methodology for genetic transistors via a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based searching algorithm is developed to search for a set of promoter-RBS components and adequate concentrations of inducers to achieve the prescribed I/O characteristics of a genetic transistor. Furthermore, according to design specifications for different types of genetic transistors, a look-up table is built for genetic transistor design, from which we could easily select an adequate set of promoter-RBS components and adequate concentrations of external inducers for a specific genetic transistor. This systematic design method will reduce the time spent using trial-and-error methods in the experimental procedure for a genetic transistor with a desired I/O characteristic. We demonstrate the applicability of our design methodology to genetic transistors that have desirable linear amplification or switching by employing promoter-RBS library searching.\n\nSystematic design methodology for robust genetic transistors based on I/O specifications via promoter-RBS libraries\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Synthetic genetic transistors are vital for signal amplification and switching in genetic circuits.

Neurogenic inflammation is mediated by neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) that are released from nociceptors. Genetic factors may play a role in CRPS as was suggested by the occurrence of familial cases and several genetic association studies investigating mainly the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. Here we investigated the role of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), a key enzyme in neuropeptide catabolism. NEP dysfunction resulting in reduced inactivation of neuropeptides may be a possible pathomechanism in CRPS. To this end, we tested a GT-repeat polymorphism in the NEP promoter region as well as 18 tag-SNPs in six linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks in the NEP gene region in 320 CRPS patients and 376 controls. No significant genetic association was observed. Thus, we conclude that the NEP gene does not seem to be a major risk factor for CRPS. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To identify RA risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 100 RA cases and 600 controls using Affymetrix SNP array 5.0. The candidate risk locus (APOM gene) was re-sequenced to discover novel promoter and coding variants in a group of the subjects. Replication was performed with the independent case-control set comprising of 578 RAs and 711 controls. Through GWAS, we identified a novel SNP associated with RA at the APOM gene in the MHC class III region on 6p21.33 (rs805297, odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, P = 5.20 Ã 10-7). Three more polymorphisms were identified at the promoter region of the APOM by the re-sequencing. For the replication, we genotyped the four SNP loci in the independent case-control set. The association of rs805297 identified by GWAS was successfully replicated (OR = 1.40, P = 6.65 Ã 10-5). The association became more significant in the combined analysis of discovery and replication sets (OR = 1.56, P = 2.73 Â± 10-10). The individuals with the rs805297 risk allele (A) at the promoter region showed a significantly lower level of APOM expression compared with those with the protective allele (C) homozygote. In the logistic regressions by the phenotype status, the homozygote risk genotype (A/A) consistently showed higher ORs than the heterozygote one (A/C) for the phenotype-positive RAs. These results indicate that APOM promoter polymorphisms are significantly associated with the susceptibility to RA.

Here, we investigated genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that affect AhR expression. Analyses of the human AHR proximal promoter in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed multiple specificity protein (Sp) 1 binding sequences that are transcriptional activators in vitro. The regulation of AhR expression was evaluated in long-term estrogen exposed (LTEE) MCF-7 cells, which showed increased AhR expression, enhanced CYP1 inducibility, and increased capacity to form DNA adducts when exposed to the dietary carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. The increased AhR expression in LTEE cells was found not to result from increased mRNA stability, differential RNA processing, or decreased DNA methylation. Analysis of the AHR proximal promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that enhanced expression of AhR in LTEE cells involves changes in histone modifications, notably decreased trimethylation of histone 3, lysine 27. Upon further examination of the GC-rich Sp1-binding region, we confirmed that it contains a polymorphic (GGGGC)n repeat. In a population of newborns from New York State, the allele frequency of (GGGGC)n was n = 4>5â«6, 2. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed the ability of sequences of this GC-rich region to form guanine-quadruplex structures in vitro. These studies revealed multiple levels at which AhR expression may be controlled, and offer additional insights into mechanisms regulating AhR expression that can ultimately impact carcinogenesis.

In this communication1 we described several general approaches undertaken in order to enhance the sensing performance of such promoter::reporter fusions. Significant improvements in detection sensitivity, response kinetics and signal intensity were achieved by modi fication of the length of the promoter-containing DNA fragment, by random or site-directed mutagenesis and by promoter duplication. The general nature of these genetics manipulations makes them applicable to other types of promoter::reporter fusions.

The risk factors include three major causes: genetic factors, viral infection, and environmental and dietary factors. The types of NPC show strong ethnic and geographic variations. The keratinizing and non-keratinizing types are prevalent in the lower incidence regions like North America and Europe; whereas the undifferentiated type is mostly found in the regions with higher incidences like China, North Africa, Arctic, and Nagaland of North-East India. These suggest a possible major role of the internal genetic factors for generation and promotion of this disease. Viral infections might accelerate the process of carcinogenesis by helping in cellular proliferation and loss of apoptosis. Diet and other environmental factors promote these neoplastic processes and further progression of the disease occurs.\n\n[Health-Promoting Schools Regional Initiative of the Americas].\n\nPubMed\n\nIppolito-Shepherd, Josefa; Cerqueira, Maria Teresa; Ortega, Diana Patricia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn Latin America, comprehensive health promotion programmes and activities are being implemented in the school setting, which take into account the conceptual framework of the Health-Promoting Schools Regional Initiative of the Pan American Health Organization, Regional office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). These programmes help to strengthen the working relationships between the health and education sectors. The Health-Promoting Schools Regional Initiative, officially launched by PAHO/WHO in 1995, aims to form future generations to have the knowledge, abilities, and skills necessary for promoting and caring for their health and that of their family and community, as well as to create and maintain healthy environments and communities. The Initiative focuses on three main components: comprehensive health education, the creation and maintenance of healthy physical and psychosocial environments, and the access to health and nutrition services, mental health, and active life. In 2001, PAHO conducted a survey in 19 Latin American countries to assess the status and trends of Health-Promoting Schools in the Region, for the appropriate regional, subregional, and national planning of pertinent health promotion and health education programmes and activities. The results of this survey provided information about policies and national plans, multisectoral coordination mechanisms for the support of health promotion in the school settings, the formation and participation in national and international networks of Health-Promoting Schools and about the level of dissemination of the strategy. For the successful development of Health-Promoting Schools is essential to involve the society as a whole, in order to mobilise human resources and materials necessary for implementing health promotion in the school settings. Thus, the constitution and consolidation of networks has been a facilitating mechanism for the exchange of ideas, resources and experiences to strengthen\n\nGenetic polymorphisms within tumor necrosis factor gene promoter region: a role for susceptibility to ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKotsaki, Antigoni; Raftogiannis, Maria; Routsi, Christina; Baziaka, Fotini; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Antonopoulou, Anastasia; Orfanos, Stylianos E; Katsenos, Chrisostomos; Koutoukas, Pantelis; Plachouras, Diamantis; Mandragos, Konstantinos; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J\n\n2012-08-01\n\nDebatable findings exist among various studies regarding the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene for susceptibility to infections. Their impact was investigated in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Two-hundred and thirteen mechanically ventilated patients who developed VAP were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted and SNPs at the -376, -308 and -238 position of the promoter region of the TNF gene were assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Monocytes were isolated from 47 patients when they developed sepsis and stimulated by bacterial endotoxin for the production of TNFÎ± and of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Patients were divided into two groups; 166 patients bearing only wild-type alleles of all three studied polymorphisms; and 47 patients carrying at least one A allele of the three studied SNPs. Time between start of mechanical ventilation and advent of VAP was significantly shorter in the second group than in the first group (log-rank: 4.416, p: 0.041). When VAP supervened, disease severity did not differ between groups. Stimulation of TNFÎ± and of IL-6 was much greater by monocytes for patients carrying A alleles. Carriage of at least one A allele of the three studied SNPs at the promoter region of the TNF-gene is associated with shorter time to development of VAP but it is not associated with disease severity. Findings may be related with a role of the studied SNPs in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge on genetic diversity and structure of weedy rice populations will facilitate the design of effective methods to control this weed by tracing its origins and dispersal patterns in a given region. To generate such knowledge, we studied genetic diversity and structure of 21 weedy rice populations from Sri Lanka based on 23 selected microsatellite (SSR) loci. Results indicated an exceptionally high level of within-population genetic diversity (Heâ=â0.62) and limited among-population differentiation (Fstâ=â0.17) for this predominantly self-pollinating weed. UPGMA analysis showed a loose genetic affinity of the weedy rice populations in relation to their geographical locations, and no obvious genetic structure among populations across the country. This phenomenon was associated with the considerable amount of gene flow between populations. Limited admixture from STRUCTURE analyses suggested a very low level of hybridization (pollen-mediated gene flow) between populations. The abundant within-population genetic diversity coupled with limited population genetic structure and differentiation is likely caused by the considerable seed-mediated gene flow of weedy rice along with the long-distance exchange of farmer-saved rice seeds between weedy-rice contaminated regions in Sri Lanka. In addition to other effective weed management strategies, promoting the application of certified rice seeds with no weedy rice contamination should be the immediate action to significantly reduce the proliferation and infestation of this weed in rice ecosystems in countries with similar rice farming styles as in Sri Lanka.\n\nGenetics/Genomics Research in the Central Region\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\n,\n\n2006-01-01\n\nGenetics-based research within the Biological Resources Discipline (BRD) Science Centers in the Central Region incorporates many aspects of the field of genetics.

Efficient information transfer between gray matter regions implicated in intelligence is thought to be critical for this trait to emerge. Genetic factors implicated in intelligence and gray matter may promote a high capacity for information transfer. Whether these genetic factors act globally or on local gray matter areas separately is not known. Brain maps of phenotypic and genetic associations between gray matter volume and intelligence were made using structural equation modeling of 3T MRI T1-weighted scans acquired in 167 adult twins of the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Subsequently, structural connectivity analyses (DTI) were performed to test the hypothesis that gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability form a densely connected core. Gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability were situated in the right prefrontal, bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, right occipital and subcortical regions. Regions implicated in intelligence had high structural connectivity density compared to 10,000 reference networks (p=0.031). The genetic association with intelligence was for 39% explained by a genetic source unique to these regions (independent of total brain volume), this source specifically implicated the right supramarginal gyrus. Using a twin design, we show that intelligence is genetically represented in a spatially distributed and densely connected network of gray matter regions providing a high capacity infrastructure. Although genes for intelligence have overlap with those for total brain volume, we present evidence that there are genes for intelligence that act specifically on the subset of brain areas that form an efficient brain network.

In this study, lettuce was selected as an alternative platform for recombinant miraculin production because of its fast growth, agronomic value, and wide availability. The taste-modifying protein miraculin is a glycoprotein extracted from the red berries of the West African native shrub Richadella dulcifica. Because of its limited natural availability, many attempts have been made to produce this protein in suitable alternative hosts. We produced transgenic lettuce with miraculin gene driven either by the ubiquitin promoter/terminator cassette from lettuce or a 35S promoter/nos terminator cassette. Miraculin gene expression and miraculin accumulation in both cassettes were compared by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression level of the miraculin gene and protein in transgenic lettuce was higher and more genetically stable in the ubiquitin promoter/terminator cassette than in the 35S promoter/nos terminator cassette. These results demonstrated that the ubiquitin promoter/terminator cassette is an efficient platform for the genetically stable expression of the miraculin protein in lettuce and hence this platform is of benefit for recombinant miraculin production on a commercial scale.\n\nRadiogenomics to characterize regional genetic heterogeneity in glioblastoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Leland S; Ning, Shuluo; Eschbacher, Jennifer M; Baxter, Leslie C; Gaw, Nathan; Ranjbar, Sara; Plasencia, Jonathan; Dueck, Amylou C; Peng, Sen; Smith, Kris A; Nakaji, Peter; Karis, John P; Quarles, C Chad; Wu, Teresa; Loftus, Joseph C; Jenkins, Robert B; Sicotte, Hugues; Kollmeyer, Thomas M; O'Neill, Brian P; Elmquist, William; Hoxworth, Joseph M; Frakes, David; Sarkaria, Jann; Swanson, Kristin R; Tran, Nhan L; Li, Jing; Mitchell, J Ross\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral genetic heterogeneity.

Kin and group selection do provide evolutionary explanations for the stability of cooperation in nature, but we still lack the full understanding of the genomic mechanisms that can prevent cheater invasion. In our study we used Aevol, an agent-based, in silico genomic platform to evolve populations of digital organisms that compete, reproduce, and cooperate by secreting a public good for tens of thousands of generations. We found that cooperating individuals may share a phenotype, defined as the amount of public good produced, but have very different abilities to resist cheater invasion. To understand the underlying genetic differences between cooperator types, we performed bio-inspired genomics analyses of our digital organisms by recording and comparing the locations of metabolic and secretion genes, as well as the relevant promoters and terminators. Association between metabolic and secretion genes (promoter sharing, overlap via frame shift or sense-antisense encoding) was characteristic for populations with robust cooperation and was more likely to evolve when secretion was costly. In mutational analysis experiments, we demonstrated the potential evolutionary consequences of the genetic association by performing a large number of mutations and measuring their phenotypic and fitness effects. The non-cooperating mutants arising from the individuals with genetic association were more likely to have metabolic deleterious mutations that eventually lead to selection eliminating such mutants from the population due to the accompanying fitness decrease. Effectively, cooperation evolved to be protected and robust to mutations through entangled genetic architecture. Our results confirm the importance of second-order selection on evolutionary outcomes, uncover an important genetic mechanism for the evolution and maintenance of\n\nGenetic drift at expanding frontiers promotes gene segregation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHallatschek, Oskar; Hersen, Pascal; Ramanathan, Sharad; Nelson, David R.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nCompetition between random genetic drift and natural selection play a central role in evolution: Whereas nonbeneficial mutations often prevail in small populations by chance, mutations that sweep through large populations typically confer a selective advantage. Here, however, we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined, sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial and yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable footprint of past range expansions.

Evolutionary causes and consequences of such behavior are not well understood, nor are their neuroendocrine and genetic bases. However, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) and its receptor (OXTR) are associated with parental care in mammalian lineages. Here we investigated the interspecific variation in the number of progesterone response elements (PREs) in the OXTR promoter region of 32 primate species, correlating genetic data with behavior, social systems, and ecological/life-history parameters, while controlling for phylogeny. We verified that PREs are only present in New World monkeys and that PRE number is significantly correlated with the presence of paternal care in this branch. We suggest that PRE number could be an essential part of the genetic repertoire that allowed the emergence of taxon-specific complex social behaviors, such as paternal care in marmosets and tamarins.\n\nMolecular population genetics of inversion breakpoint regions in Drosophila pseudoobscura.\n\nPubMed\n\nWallace, Andre G; Detweiler, Don; Schaeffer, Stephen W\n\n2013-07-08\n\nParacentric inversions in populations can have a profound effect on the pattern and organization of nucleotide variability along a chromosome. Regions near inversion breakpoints are expected to have greater levels of differentiation because of reduced genetic exchange between different gene arrangements whereas central regions in the inverted segments are predicted to have lower levels of nucleotide differentiation due to greater levels of genetic flux among different karyotypes. We used the inversion polymorphism on the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura to test these predictions with an analysis of nucleotide diversity of 18 genetic markers near and away from inversion breakpoints. We tested hypotheses about how the presence of different chromosomal arrangements affects the pattern and organization of nucleotide variation. Overall, markers in the distal segment of the chromosome had greater levels of nucleotide heterozygosity than markers within the proximal segment of the chromosome. In addition, our results rejected the hypothesis that the breakpoints of derived inversions will have lower levels of nucleotide variability than breakpoints of ancestral inversions, even when strains with gene conversion events were removed. High levels of linkage disequilibrium were observed within all 11 breakpoint regions as well as between the ends of most proximal and distal breakpoints. The central region of the chromosome had the greatest levels of linkage disequilibrium compared with the proximal and distal regions because this is the region that experiences the highest level of recombination suppression. These data do not fully support the idea that genetic exchange is the sole force that influences genetic variation on inverted chromosomes.\n\nReview: Genetically modified plants for the promotion of human health.\n\nPubMed\n\nYonekura-Sakakibara, Keiko; Saito, Kazuki\n\n2006-12-01\n\nPlants are attractive biological resources because of their ability to produce a huge variety of chemical compounds, and the familiarity of production in even the most rural settings. Genetic engineering gives plants additional characteristics and value for cultivation and post-harvest. Genetically modified (GM) plants of the \"first generation\" were conferred with traits beneficial to producers, whereas GM plants in subsequent \"generations\" are intended to provide beneficial traits for consumers. Golden Rice is a promising example of a GM plant in the second generation, and has overcome a number of obstacles for practical use. Furthermore, consumer-acceptable plants with health-promoting properties that are genetically modified using native genes are being developed. The emerging technology of metabolomics will also support the commercial realization of GM plants by providing comprehensive analyzes of plant biochemical components.\n\nTranscription Factor Map Alignment of Promoter Regions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBlanco, Enrique; Messeguer, Xavier; Smith, Temple F; GuigÃ³, Roderic\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe address the problem of comparing and characterizing the promoter regions of genes with similar expression patterns. This remains a challenging problem in sequence analysis, because often the promoter regions of co-expressed genes do not show discernible sequence conservation. In our approach, thus, we have not directly compared the nucleotide sequence of promoters. Instead, we have obtained predictions of transcription factor binding sites, annotated the predicted sites with the labels of the corresponding binding factors, and aligned the resulting sequences of labelsâto which we refer here as transcription factor maps (TF-maps). To obtain the global pairwise alignment of two TF-maps, we have adapted an algorithm initially developed to align restriction enzyme maps. We have optimized the parameters of the algorithm in a small, but well-curated, collection of humanâmouse orthologous gene pairs. Results in this dataset, as well as in an independent much larger dataset from the CISRED database, indicate that TF-map alignments are able to uncover conserved regulatory elements, which cannot be detected by the typical sequence alignments.

This article describes the first steps in development of an emergency preparedness plan for individual centers.\n\nPopulation-genetic analysis of HvABCG31 promoter sequence in wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The cuticle is an important adaptive structure whose origin played a crucial role in the transition of plants from aqueous to terrestrial conditions. HvABCG31/Eibi1 is an ABCG transporter gene, involved in cuticle formation that was recently identified in wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum). To study the genetic variation of HvABCG31 in different habitats, its 2 kb promoter region was sequenced from 112 wild barley accessions collected from five natural populations from southern and northern Israel. The sites included three mesic and two xeric habitats, and differed in annual rainfall, soil type, and soil water capacity. Results Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned HvABCG31 promoter sequences clustered the majority of accessions (69 out of 71) from the three northern mesic populations into one cluster, while all 21 accessions from the Dead Sea area, a xeric southern population, and two isolated accessions (one from a xeric population at Mitzpe Ramon and one from the xeric âAfrican Slopeâ of âEvolution Canyonâ) formed the second cluster. The southern arid populations included six haplotypes, but they differed from the consensus sequence at a large number of positions, while the northern mesic populations included 15 haplotypes that were, on average, more similar to the consensus sequence. Most of the haplotypes (20 of 22) were unique to a population. Interestingly, higher genetic variation occurred within populations (54.2%) than among populations (45.8%). Analysis of the promoter region detected a large number of transcription factor binding sites: 121â128 and 121â134 sites in the two southern arid populations, and 123â128,125â128, and 123â125 sites in the three northern mesic populations. Three types of TFBSs were significantly enriched: those related to GA (gibberellin), Dof (DNA binding with one finger), and light. Conclusions Drought stress and adaptive natural selection may have been important determinants in the observed\n\nMisregulation effect of a novel allelic variant in the Z promoter region found in cis with the CYP21A2 p.P482S mutation: implications for 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez, Cecilia S; Bruque, Carlos D; Taboas, Melisa; Buzzalino, NoemÃ­ D; Espeche, Lucia D; Pasqualini, Titania; Charreau, Eduardo H; Alba, Liliana G; Ghiringhelli, Pablo D; Dain, Liliana\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe aim of the current study was to search for the presence of genetic variants in the CYP21A2 Z promoter regulatory region in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Screening of the 10 most frequent pseudogene-derived mutations was followed by direct sequencing of the entire coding sequence, the proximal promoter, and a distal regulatory region in DNA samples from patients with at least one non-determined allele. We report three non-classical patients that presented a novel genetic variant-g.15626A>G-within the Z promoter regulatory region. In all the patients, the novel variant was found in cis with the mild, less frequent, p.P482S mutation located in the exon 10 of the CYP21A2 gene. The putative pathogenic implication of the novel variant was assessed by in silico analyses and in vitro assays. Topological analyses showed differences in the curvature and bendability of the DNA region bearing the novel variant. By performing functional studies, a significantly decreased activity of a reporter gene placed downstream from the regulatory region was found by the G transition. Our results may suggest that the activity of an allele bearing the p.P482S mutation may be influenced by the misregulated CYP21A2 transcriptional activity exerted by the Z promoter A>G variation.\n\nTetramethylpyrazine-Inducible Promoter Region from Rhodococcus jostii TMP1.\n\nPubMed\n\nStanislauskienÄ, RÅ«ta; Kutanovas, Simonas; KalinienÄ, Laura; Bratchikov, Maksim; MeÅ¡kys, Rolandas\n\n2018-06-25\n\nAn inducible promoter region, P TTMP (tetramethylpyrazine [TTMP]), has been identified upstream of the tpdABC operon, which contains the genes required for the initial degradation of 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine in Rhodococcus jostii TMP1 bacteria. In this work, the promoter region was fused with the gene for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to investigate the activity of P TTMP by measuring the fluorescence of bacteria. The highest promoter activity was observed when bacteria were grown in a nutrient broth (NB) medium supplemented with 5 mM 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine for 48 h. Using a primer extension reaction, two transcriptional start sites for tpdA were identified, and the putative −35 and −10 promoter motifs were determined. The minimal promoter along with two 15 bp long direct repeats and two 7 bp inverted sequences were identified. Also, the influence of the promoter elements on the activity of P TTMP were determined using site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, P TTMP was shown to be induced by pyrazine derivatives containing methyl groups in the 2- and 5-positions of the heterocyclic ring, in the presence of the LuxR family transcriptional activator TpdR.\n\nConservation and genetic characterisation of common bean landraces from Cilento region (southern Italy): high differentiation in spite of low genetic diversity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Luca, Daniele; Cennamo, Paola; Del Guacchio, Emanuele; Di Novella, Riccardo; Caputo, Paolo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSince its introduction from Central-South America to Italy almost 500Â years ago, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was largely cultivated across the peninsula in hundreds of different landraces. However, globalisation and technological modernisation of agricultural practices in the last decades promoted the cultivation of few varieties at the expense of traditional and local agro-ecotypes, which have been confined to local markets or have completely disappeared. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and differentiation in 12 common bean landraces once largely cultivated in the Cilento region (Campania region, southern Italy), and now the object of a recovery program to save them from extinction. The analysis conducted using 13 nuclear microsatellite loci in 140 individuals revealed a high degree of homozygosity within each landrace and a strong genetic differentiation that was reflected in the success in assigning individuals to the source landrace. On the contrary, internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2, analysed in one individual per landrace, were highly similar among common bean landraces but allowed the identification of a cowpea variety (Vigna unguiculata Walp.), a crop largely cultivated in the Old World before the arrival of common bean from Americas. In conclusion, our study highlighted that conservation of landraces is important not only for the cultural and socio-economic value that they have for local communities, but also because the time and conditions in which they have been selected have led to that genetic distinctiveness that is at the basis of many potential agronomical applications and dietary benefits.\n\nInfluence of A-21T and C-262T genetic polymorphisms at the promoter region of the catalase (CAT) on gene expression.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaify, Khyber; Saadat, Iraj; Saadat, Mostafa\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCatalase (CAT, OMIM: 115500) is one of the major antioxidant enzymes, which plays an important role in the clearance of reactive oxygen species. Three genetic polymorphisms of A-21T (rs7943316), C-262T (rs1001179), and C-844T (rs769214) in the promoter region of the CAT have been reported. It has been suggested that these polymorphisms may alter the recognition sites of transcriptional factors, therefore it might be concluded that these polymorphisms may alter the expression levels of the gene. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the associations between these genetic variations and the CAT mRNA levels in human peripheral blood cells. The present study consisted of 47 healthy students of Shiraz University (south-west Iran). Genotypes of the CAT polymorphisms were determined by PCR based method. The quantitative CAT mRNA expression levels were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the study genotypes (For A-21T polymorphism: FÂ =Â 7.45; dfÂ =Â 2, 44; PÂ =Â 0.002; For C-262T polymorphism: FÂ =Â 15.17; dfÂ =Â 2, 44; PÂ <Â 0.001). The studied polymorphisms showed linkage disequilibrium (D'Â =Â 1.0, r 2 Â =Â 0.1813, Ï 2 Â =Â 17.03, PÂ <Â 0.0001). The mRNA levels of CAT in the AC/TT, TC/TC, TC/TT, and TC/TC diplotypes significantly were higher than the mRNA levels in AC/AC diplotype. There was a significant difference between the study genotypes (FÂ =Â 9.24; dfÂ =Â 5, 41; PÂ <Â 0.001). The TC/TC and TT/TT diplotypes showed about 2 and 4 folds CAT mRNA levels compared with the AC/AC diplotype. The present findings indicated that these polymorphisms were significantly associated with the gene expression.\n\nOxytocin Receptor Genetic Variation Promotes Human Trust Behavior\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKrueger, Frank; Parasuraman, Raja; Iyengar, Vijeth; Thornburg, Matthew; Weel, Jaap; Lin, Mingkuan; Clarke, Ellen; McCabe, Kevin; Lipsky, Robert H.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGiven that human trust behavior is heritable and intranasal administration of oxytocin enhances trust, the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene is an excellent candidate to investigate genetic contributions to individual variations in trust behavior. Although a single-nucleotide polymorphism involving an adenine (A)/guanine (G) transition (rs53576) has been associated with socio-emotional phenotypes, its link to trust behavior is unclear. We combined genotyping of healthy male students (nâ=â108) with the administration of a trust game experiment. Our results show that a common occurring genetic variation (rs53576) in the OXTR gene is reliably associated with trust behavior rather than a general increase in trustworthy or risk behaviors. Individuals homozygous for the G allele (GG) showed higher trust behavior than individuals with A allele carriers (AA/AG). Although the molecular functionality of this polymorphism is still unknown, future research should clarify how the OXTR gene interacts with other genes and the environment in promoting socio-emotional behaviors.

Wheat is the most emphasized winter cereal in RS, attracting public and private investments directed to wheat genetic breeding. The study of genetic progress should be performed routinely at breeding programs to study the behavior of cultivars developed for homogeneous regions of cultivation. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the genetic progress of wheat grain yield in RS; 2) to evaluate the influence of cultivar competition trial stratification in homogeneous regions of cultivation on the study of genetic progress. Grain yield data of 122 wheat cultivars evaluated in 137 trials arranged in randomized block design with three or four replications were used. Field trials were carried out in 23 locations in RS divided into two homogeneous regions during the period from 2002 to 2013. Genetic progress for RS and homogeneous regions was studied utilizing the method proposed by Vencovsky. Annual genetic progress for wheat grain yield during the period of 12 years in the State of RS was 2.86%, oscillating between homogeneous regions of cultivation. The difference of annual genetic progress in region 1 (1.82%) in relation to region 2 (4.38%) justifies the study of genetic progress by homogeneous regions of cultivation.\n\nGenetic Determinants for Promoter Hypermethylation in the Lungs of Smokers: A Candidate Gene-Based Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeng, Shuguang; Stidley, Christine A.; Liu, Yushi; Edlund, Christopher K.; Willink, Randall P.; Han, Younghun; Landi, Maria Teresa; Thun, Michael; Picchi, Maria A.; Bruse, Shannon E.; Crowell, Richard E.; Van Den Berg, David; Caporaso, Neil E.; Amos, Christopher I.; Siegfried, Jill M.; Tesfaigzi, Yohannes; Gilliland, Frank D.; Belinsky, Steven A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe detection of tumor suppressor gene promoter methylation in sputum-derived exfoliated cells predicts early lung cancer. Here we identified genetic determinants for this epigenetic process and examined their biological effects on gene regulation. A two-stage approach involving discovery and replication was employed to assess the association between promoter hypermethylation of a 12-gene panel and common variation in 40 genes involved in carcinogen metabolism, regulation of methylation, and DNA damage response in members of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (n=1434). Molecular validation of three identified variants was conducted using primary bronchial epithelial cells. Association of study-wide significance (P<8.2Ã10â5) was identified for rs1641511, rs3730859, and rs1883264 in TP53, LIG1, and BIK, respectively. These SNPs were significantly associated with altered expression of the corresponding genes in primary bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, rs3730859 in LIG1 was also moderately associated with increased risk for lung cancer among Caucasian smokers. Together, our findings suggest that genetic variation in DNA replication and apoptosis pathways impacts the propensity for gene promoter hypermethylation in the aerodigestive tract of smokers. The incorporation of genetic biomarkers for gene promoter hypermethylation with clinical and somatic markers may improve risk assessment models for lung cancer.

Here, we address regional differentiation in two closely related hybridizing taxa, the perennial sedges Carex flava and C. viridula and their hybrid C. Ã subviridula in 37 populations in the north and centre of their distribution range in Europe (Estonia, Lowland (<1000 m a.s.l.) and Highland Switzerland) using 10 putative microsatellite loci. We ask whether regional differentiation was larger in the less common taxon C. viridula or whether, possibly due to hybridization, it was similar between taxa. Our results showed similar, low to moderate genetic diversity for the three studied taxa. In total, we found 12 regional species-specific alleles. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), STRUCTURE and multidimensional scaling analysis showed regional structure in genetic variation, where intraspecific differentiation between regions was lower for C. flava (AMOVA: 6.84 %) than for C. viridula (20.77 %) or C. Ã subviridula (18.27 %) populations. Hybrids differed from the parental taxa in the two regions where they occurred, i.e. in Estonia and Lowland Switzerland. We conclude that C. flava and C. viridula clearly differ from each other genetically, that there is pronounced regional differentiation and that, despite hybridization, this regional differentiation is more pronounced in the less common taxon, C. viridula. We encourage future studies on hybridizing taxa to work with plant populations from more than one region.

Seed and pollen dispersal patterns can respond differently to the increased isolation resulting from habitat fragmentation, with unpredictable consequences for gene flow and population structuring. In a recently fragmented landscape we compared the pre- and post-fragmentation genetic structure of populations of a tree species where pollen and seed dispersal respond differentially to forest fragmentation generated by flooding. Castanopsis sclerophylla is wind-pollinated, with seeds that are dispersed by gravity and rodents. Using microsatellites, we found no significant difference in genetic diversity between pre- and post-fragmentation cohorts. Significant genetic structure was observed in pre-fragmentation cohorts, due to an unknown genetic barrier that had isolated one small population. Among post-fragmentation cohorts this genetic barrier had disappeared and genetic structure was significantly weakened. The strengths of genetic structuring were at a similar level in both cohorts, suggesting that overall gene flow of C. sclerophylla has been unchanged by fragmentation at the regional scale. Fragmentation has blocked seed dispersal among habitats, but this appears to have been compensated for by enhanced pollen dispersal, as indicated by the disappearance of a genetic barrier, probably as a result of increased wind speeds and easier pollen movement over water. Extensive pollen flow can counteract some negative effects of fragmentation and assist the long-term persistence of small remnant populations.\n\nGenetic variants in SIRT3 transcriptional regulatory region affect promoter activity and fat deposition in three cattle breeds.\n\nPubMed\n\nGui, Linsheng; Hong, Jieyun; Raza, Sayed Haidar Abbas; Zan, Linsen\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase. It has crucial roles in regulating the respiratory chain, in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and in both the citric acid and urea cycles. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SIRT3 could be used as a candidate gene in the breeding of cattle. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) indicated that expression levels of SIRT3 were highest in the kidney, rumen, liver, omasum and muscle. Using sequencing technology on a total of 913 cattle representing three indigenous Chinese beef cattle breeds, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter region of SIRT3, and five haplotypes representing five potential transcription factor compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Association analysis indicated that the Hap3/8 diplotype performed better than other combinations in intramuscular fat content. In addition, the promoter activity with Hap1 haplotype was higher than the Hap8 haplotype, consistent with the association analysis. The results indicate that the polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites of SIRT3 promoter may affect the transcriptional activity of SIRT3, and thus alter intramuscular fat content in beef cattle.

There is an urgent need to understand the virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms of ISAV and to develop new vaccine approaches. Using a recombinant molecular biology approach, we report the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetic system for ISAV, which includes the use of a novel fish promoter, the Atlantic salmon internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS-1). Salmon cells cotransfected with pSS-URG-based vectors expressing the eight viral RNA segments and four cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vectors that express the four proteins of the ISAV ribonucleoprotein complex allowed the generation of infectious recombinant ISAV (rISAV). We generated three recombinant viruses, wild-type rISAV901_09 and rISAVrS6-NotI-HPR containing a NotI restriction site and rISAVS6/EGFP-HPR harboring the open reading frame of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), both within the highly polymorphic region (HPR) of segment 6. All rescued viruses showed replication activity and cytopathic effect in Atlantic salmon kidney-infected cells. The fluorescent recombinant viruses also showed a characteristic cytopathic effect in salmon cells, and the viruses replicated to a titer of 6.5 Ã 105 PFU/ml, similar to that of the wild-type virus. This novel reverse genetics system offers a powerful tool to study the molecular biology of ISAV and to develop a new generation of ISAV vaccines to prevent and mitigate ISAV infection, which has had a profound effect on the salmon industry.

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic association of polymorphisms in the APOAI promoter region with plasma lipid levels in a cohort of healthy Kuwaiti volunteers. Methods A 435 bp region of the APOAI promoter was analyzed by re-sequencing in 549 Kuwaiti samples. DNA was extracted from blood taken from 549 healthy Kuwaiti volunteers who had fasted for the previous 12 h. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to determine allele association with serum lipid levels. Results The target sequence included a partial segment of the promoter region, 5âUTR and exon 1 located between nucleotides â141 to +294 upstream of the APOAI gene on chromosome 11. No novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed. The sequences obtained were deposited with the NCBI GenBank with accession number [GenBank: JX438706]. The allelic frequencies for the three SNPs were as follows: APOAI rs670Gâ=â0.807; rs5069Câ=â0.964; rs1799837Gâ=â0.997 and found to be in HWE. A significant association (pâ<â0.05) was observed for the APOAI rs670 polymorphism with increased serum LDL-C. Multivariate analysis showed that APOAI rs670 was an independent predictive factor when controlling for age, sex and BMI for both LDL-C (OR: 1.66, pâ=â0.014) and TC (OR: 1.77, pâ=â0.006) levels. Conclusion This study is the first to report sequence analysis of the APOAI promoter in an Arab population. The unexpected positive association found between the APOAI rs670 polymorphism and increased levels of LDL-C and TC may be due to linkage disequilibrium with other polymorphisms in candidate and neighboring genes known to be associated with lipid metabolism and transport.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether KLF3 could be used as a candidate gene in the breeding of cattle. The expression pattern of bovine KLF3 gene revealed that it was highly expressed in abdominal fat and perirenal fat. Using DNA sequencing, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter regions of KLF3 gene were identified in 448 Qinchuan cattle, which are located in the recognition sequences of 11 transcription factors and the four haplotypes representing four potential different compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Association analysis results indicated that individuals with the Hap7/7 diplotype showed higher (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) intramuscular fat content (IFC) than those with H7/8. In addition, the H7 haplotype had much higher (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) transcriptional activity than the H8 haplotype, consistent with the association analysis. We speculated that polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites of the KLF3 promoter region affected transcriptional activity of KLF3, which subsequently influence intramuscular fat content in Qinchuan cattle and KLF3 gene could be used as molecular markers for fat deposition traits using early marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Qinchuan cattle breeding in the future.

The promoter was shown to be induced at lower temperatures compared to the human hsp70 promoter. The promoter activity increased after a 60-min heat shock already at 38 Â°C in human cells. The promoter activation was observed 24 h after heat shock for the constructs with eight HSEs, while those with four HSEs required 48 h. After transplantation of in vitro heat-shocked transfected cells, the promoter activity could be maintained for 3 days with a gradual decline. The promoter activation was confirmed in vivo without preliminary heat shock in mouse ischemic brain foci. Controlled expression of the Gdnf gene under a Drosophila hsp70 promoter was demonstrated. This promoter with four and eight HSE sequences in the regulatory region can be proposed as a regulated promoter in genetic therapeutic systems.\n\nSystematic screening for mutations in the promoter and the coding region of the 5-HT{sub 1A} gene\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nErdmann, J.; Shimron-Abarbanell, D.; Cichon, S.\n\n1995-10-09\n\nIn the present study we sought to identify genetic variation in the 5-HT{sub 1A} receptor gene which through alteration of protein function or level of expression might contribute to the genetic predisposition to neuropsychiatric diseases. Genomic DNA samples from 159 unrelated subjects (including 45 schizophrenic, 46 bipolar affective, and 43 patients with Tourette`s syndrome, as well as 25 healthy controls) were investigated by single-strand conformation analysis. Overlapping PCR (polymerase chain reaction) fragments covered the whole coding sequence as well as the 5{prime} untranslated region of the 5-HT{sub 1A} gene. The region upstream to the coding sequence we investigated contains amoreÂ Â» functional promoter. We found two rare nucleotide sequence variants. Both mutations are located in the coding region of the gene: a coding mutation (A{yields}G) in nucleotide position 82 which leads to an amino acid exchange (Ile{yields}Val) in position 28 of the receptor protein and a silent mutation (C{yields}T) in nucleotide position 549. The occurrence of the Ile-28-Val substitution was studied in an extended sample of patients (n = 352) and controls (n = 210) but was found in similar frequencies in all groups.
