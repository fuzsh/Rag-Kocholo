In our context, Scandinavian names include names used in the countries of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The languages in these countries are all closely related and belong to the same family of Indo-European languages. Finland is also a Scandinavian country, but it is divided linguistically. There is a Swedish-speaking minority of about 6 percent, and many in this population use Swedish language names. Finnish is the first language of the majority of Finns, however, and Finnish is not Indo-European but part of the FinnoUgric language group, which also includes Hungarian and Estonian. Immigration from Finland to the United States is an integral part of immigration from the other Scandinavian countries, however. For this reason, a section on Finnish immigration is included. The languages of the Sámi people, a minority population living in northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, belong to the same group as Finnish. Greenland is a part of Denmark, but the native language, Kalaallisut, belongs to still another family of languages unrelated to Indo-European, the Inuit-Aleut family, spoken by Inuits in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Finnish, Sámi, and Kalaallisut (Inuit) names will not be treated in this book. The names of girls and boys are treated in different sections. Each entry gives information about the pronunciation of the name in Scandinavia, in which Scandinavian country or countries the name is primarily used, its origin and meaning, relevant information about its frequency and popularity during the immigration period (ca. 1840–1910), and well-known bearers of the name. The second section of the book is a handbook containing information on a number of subjects relevant to the context of Scandinavian names and naming traditions in the home countries and the United States. Both of the authors have a Norwegian background, and most of our research has been on Norwegian names and naming traditions. Our aim is to cover the entire field of Scandinavian names, but in some instances the material has an unavoidable Norwegian slant. This book should meet the needs of different groups of readers. We hope that all these groups will find something that interests them: vii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\n• Readers looking for information on the names used in their own immigrant families • Readers looking for authentic Scandinavian names for their children • Readers desiring information about the context of using a Scandinavian name • Readers with a general interest in names and naming traditions. Names are part of the broader cultural heritage brought to the United States by immigrants from the Scandinavian countries. Many books have been published in English on other aspects of Scandinavian culture, but until now there has not been a book devoted to Scandinavian names and naming traditions. Naming books are available for other ethnic groups, such as Irish, Scottish, and German. Some Scandinavian names are popular in mainstream American culture, as can be confirmed by looking at any one of the many name books published for the American market. Unfortunately, some of the information in these books is erroneous or misunderstood in the cultural context, and new books use existing books as sources, so myths about Scandinavian names are perpetuated from book to book. There are also a good many Web sites where you can find suggestions for Scandinavian baby names. Unfortunately, many of these resources also give unreliable information on which names belong to the Scandinavian naming vocabulary, as well as the meanings. It is always important to know something about the cultural context of a name, and Scandinavian naming traditions differ from those in the United States, as well as other European countries. It is hoped that this volume will correct misconceptions and be a reliable source for people looking for information on Scandinavian names.\n\nPronunciation Guide\n\nThis pronunciation guide is designed to help you approximate the pronunciation of names in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. It is based on the spelling and pronunciation of English according to General American English pronunciation, with occasional references to British English. The system is based on the symbols or phonetics used in phrase books for tourists and some English language dictionaries. Our variant of this system is based on the selection of names in this volume, and it is therefore not comprehensive. A stressed syllable is shown in bold type. Scandinavian languages normally stress the first syllable in a word, but there are some exceptions. Names borrowed and developed from Latin and other Romance languages typically place the accent toward the end of the word. Examples for most sounds will be given for both girls names and boys names.\n\nDanish Written Danish and Norwegian bokmål look very similar, but the pronunciation is different. Danish intonation is less “musical” than Norwegian and Swedish, and the glottal stop explained below gives it a guttural character that sounds peculiar to other Scandinavians. Consonants Most consonants in Danish are pronounced as in English. Exceptions are noted in the table below. Symbol\n\nExamples\n\nPronunciation\n\nbj\n\nLetter\n\nBoth b and j are pronounced.

This is a short puff of air. The sound is too complicated to include in this pronunciation guide. Leaving it out will not be an impediment to pronouncing the names. The next table provides details of vowel pronunciation. Note that Danish has three extra vowels: æ, ø, and å.

A vowel followed by one consonant is long (tak—roof, ceiling). A short vowel is followed by a double consonant or two or more consonants (takk—thank you). See the next table for vowel pronunciation. Note that Norwegian, like Danish, has three extra vowels: æ, ø, and å. See also page 69 for a comparison of the “extra” vowels in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic.

This is due to the fact that naming girls is more susceptible to shifting fashions in naming, resulting in more girls names being imported from other countries than is the case for the boys names. A large number of the imported girls names are not of interest in a book of Scandinavian names, since they primarily belong in an international context. The imported names included here have all been adapted to the Scandinavian environment in spelling and/or pronunciation. For more information on naming fashions, see pages 128–34. The letter C is mostly used in imported names and loan words in Scandinavian, but in the United States immigrants frequently chose the spelling with C instead of K. Many names starting with W are also spelled with V. Following the practice of Scandinavian languages, note that names beginning with Æ-, Ä-, Ø-, Ö-, and Å- (which are all separate letters rather than accented vowels) are to be found at the end of the alphabet. Agata, Agate (D: aa-gæ-teh; N: aa-gaa-ta, aa-gaa-teh; S: aa-gaa-ta) From Greek ‘good, honorable.’ See Agda, Ågot. Agda (aag-da) Swedish form of Agata. See Ågot. Agnes (D: owng-nehs; N/S: aag-nehs) From Latin ‘pure, holy.’ Common in Sweden. Agneta, Agnete (D: owng-nay-teh; N/S: aag-nay-ta, aag-nay-teh) From Latin, ablative case Agnete, a form of Agnes. Agnetha Fältskog was a lead singer in ABBA, the Swedish pop group active from 1972 until 1982. Aina (I-na) From Finnish Aino, probably meaning ‘the only one.’ Known from the national epic Kalevala. Popular in Scandinavia in the 1970s. Alberta, Alberte (D: aal-bær-teh; N/S: aalbær-ta, aal-bær-teh) Feminine form of German Albert.\n\nAlfhild, Alvhild (aal-fill; S: aalf-hild) Most common in Norway. From Old Norse Alfhildr, a compound of alf ‘elf, fairy’ and hildr ‘battle.’ Alfrid (aal-freed) Swedish; first element al either ‘all’ or ‘elf ’ or ‘noble,’ last element fríðr ‘beautiful, fair.’ Rare. Alida (aa-lee-da) A Dutch form of German Adelheid, from adal ‘noble’ and heid ‘gleam, glitter.’ Especially common in Norway during the 1860–1910 immigration period.
