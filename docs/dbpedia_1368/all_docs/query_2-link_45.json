        "text": "Neil Kent&#39;s book sweeps through Sweden&#39;s history from the Stone Age to the present day. Early coverage includes Viking hegemony, the Scandinavian Union, the Reformation and Sweden&#39;s political zenith as Europe&#39;s greatest superpower in the seventeenth century, while later chapters explore the Swedish Enlightenment, royal absolutism, the commitment to military neutrality and Pan-Scandinavianism. The author brings his account up to date by focusing on more recent developments: the rise of Social Democracy, the establishment of the welfare state, the country&#39;s acceptance of membership in the European Union and its progressive ecological programme. The book successfully combines the politics, economics and social and cultural mores of one of the world&#39;s most successfully functioning and humane societies. This is an informative and entertaining account for students and general readers.\n\nThis chapter stresses the importance of critical perspectives in the field of International Migration and Ethnic Relations by emphasising an analysis of both social relations and discourse, in a wide sense. Migration and ethnicity are seen as conjoined processes embedded in social relations and thus unequal power relations, as with class and gender. This double-sided critical perspective is applied in trying to locate the Swedish social formation in relation to the main tenets that have grounded the idea of a particular Swedish (Scandinavian or Nordic) model or exceptionalism.\n\nThe notion of sovereignty remains one of the most scholarly and historically contested concepts. In this article we argue that historians’ absorption of sovereignty’s spatiality needs to be complemented by an investigation of its temporality. By tracing the late medieval and early modern connections between political theology and economic teleology—between the permanence of political incorporation and perpetuation of the administrative apparatus —this article outlines a new research agenda and a novel vantage point for investigating state formation in Sweden. The article scrutinizes the following four areas: (1) The ideas of incorporation and representation of the realm and the Swedish people in late medieval historiography; (2) the transformation of political loyalty from personal oaths of and to the monarchs to popular, national loyalty; (3) the transformation of tax-collection from occasional to perpetual; and (4) the transition from personal debts of monarchs to state debt."
