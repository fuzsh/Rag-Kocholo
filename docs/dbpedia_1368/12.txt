Biography

Lars Mattsson (less credibly Lars Markusson) lived around 1490 and by the middle of the 15th century is said to have acquired tax free status in Sarvlaks, Pärnå country in Swedish Finland. Sarvlaks became one of the two main farms of the family.

He married Margareta Larsdotter, daughter of Lasse of Gästerby, in Sibbo, (who is an ancestor of the Ekelöf family) and Margareta of Härtonäs (a daughter of the ancestors of the Jägerhorn af Härtonäs family).

They had a number of children:

Brita Larsdotter, married Matts Jönsson Teit

N.N. Larsdotter, married to Jakob of Härkäpää

Matts Larsson, died 1555

Mårten Mattsson (d. 1574), served as the ship's governor in 1561 and later in the castle court at Hämeenlinna was ennobled 2 Aug 1569

Knut Larsson (died 1540), served as bailiff in Sääksmäki in Tavastland

Matts Knutsson (died after 1584), married Benkta Lydiksdotter, daughter of Lydik Larsson (Djäk) and his first wife Birgitta Nilsdotter (Dufva)

Mårten Mattsson (died 1574), married 1 with Karin Hansdotter, half sister to the Mayor of Helsinki Lars Michelsson (Svanström); then 2 with Margareta Bertilsdotter, daughter of Bertil Mattsson (Grönfelt) and Margareta Eriksdotter (Ekelöf).

Lars Mårtensson (died 1599) commanded the fleet for John III which removed Sigismund from Danzig in July 1593 and was appointed as commander in Viborg. When Karl IX of Sweden took Viborg Castle in Sep 1599, Lars was executed by beheading. Married to Margareta Arvidsdotter, daughter of Arvid Olofsson (Wildeman) and Anna Frille.

Erengisle Larsson, who became Ernst Creutz (died 1635), was the first to use the family name Creutz. He signed the Finnish nobility's assurance of loyalty to Karl IX in 1602 and regained his family's wealth. He was introduced to the Riddarhuset in 1625.
