        "text": "ROBERT E Moritz has been appointed as the new global chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) with effect from July 1, 2016.\n\nMr Moritz will serve a four-year term as PwC's international network's chairman on relinquishing his current position as US chairman and senior partner of the accounting giant.\n\nHe has been with PwC his entire career, joining in 1985 and becoming a partner in 1995. His background is in assurance, primarily serving financial services companies. He has held a number of leadership roles in PwC, including as head of the US assurance practice as well as managing partner for the New York region.\n\n\"Bob brings a strong sense of purpose, strategic leadership and business insight. His clear focus on all stakeholders is critical to the successful future of our worldwide network,\" said John G Maxwell, chairman of PwC's global board. \"During his tenure in the US, Bob's outspoken support of work-life flexibility for the firm's people, the importance of diversity on his own team, and the significant investments he has overseen in new and cutting edge technologies make him the ideal forward-looking leader to navigate the global economy and bring our best ideas and solutions to clients.\"\n\nMr Moritz succeeds Dennis Nally, who retires in June this year after a 42-year career with the firm. Mr Nally has served two terms as PwC's global chairman during a time of considerable growth and expansion, including the 2014 acquisition of consulting firm Booz & Company.\n\n\"I would like to thank Dennis for his commitment and very successful leadership of the PwC network over the last seven years. He has not only been an excellent ambassador for PwC, but a challenging voice to business on the issues of diversity, purpose and our understanding of the megatrends reshaping the global economic landscape,\" added Mr Maxwell.\n\nMr Moritz's successor as US chairman of PwC will be announced later this year, following an election process."
