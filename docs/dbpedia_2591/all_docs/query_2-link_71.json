        "text": "Rob Gilmore serves as Chair of the Labor & Employment Law practice group and leads the firm’s Employment & Severance Negotiations group, bringing leadership and strategic direction to the attorneys working in these areas of practice.\n\nIn his own practice, Rob counsels employers both large and small in the full range of labor and employment matters, including workplace terminations, reductions in force, employee handbooks and policies, non-compete agreements, trade secrets, shareholder disputes, unfair labor practice allegations, union negotiations and general business litigation. He represents employers in state and federal courts, arbitration and before state and federal administrative agencies in defense of employment discrimination, wrongful discharge claims and in non-compete litigation.\n\nWithin KJK’s Employment & Severance Negotiations group, Rob and his team assist executives and professionals in the negotiation of employment and severance agreements. Rob works with his clients to deliver the best possible results depending on their individual needs and goals.\n\nFrom his background as an assistant general counsel for Verizon Communications, Rob brings a broad understanding of both sides of labor and employment disputes and takes a proactive approach to help clients deal with issues before they occur. He’s valued by his clients not only for his depth of experience but also his ability to communicate important concepts related to their cases.\n\nAn avid tennis player, Rob applies the same strategic thinking on the tennis court as he does in his legal work. He earned his bachelor’s degree in history and remains a history buff, believing in the value of understanding history to take action for the future.\n\nRob is frequently called upon as a speaker for local and national conferences, and has been recognized nationally for his accomplishments by being selected as a fellow to both The College of Labor and Employment Lawyers and the Litigation Counsel of America."
