The objective of the degree program is to provide doctoral students an opportunity to study and conduct research with faculty in areas of excellence within the college. Students entering this program may select research and classes in areas of emphasis including: agricultural biochemistry, animal nutrition, animal physiology, and production management.\n\nAdmissions for 2025-2026\n\nApplicants must hold a bachelor's to be eligible for admission into the program. The following admission and performance standards are usually required in the Ph.D. in Agriculture Sciences program:\n\nAn applicant must possess a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale).\n\nThe graduate record examination is required for the major in plant and soil sciences but not for the major in animal, food, and nutrition sciences.\n\nInternational students must meet WVU's minimum score requirement for English language proficiency.\n\nAn applicant must provide three letters of reference.\n\nA one to two-page letter of intent from the student describing their research and professional aspirations is required.\n\nApplicants are advised to contact a potential faculty advisor before they initiate the application process.\n\nAfter a student is admitted into the doctoral program, their major professor will provide and direct an appropriate research opportunity. Doctoral students will conduct research supporting projects approved by the West Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (WVAFES) or externally funded grants. In consultation with the major professor, the student will select a graduate committee within the first semester of study. The committee will consist of five or more members; the majority must be WVU faculty and at least one member representing a discipline outside the college. Each student and their committee will formulate a plan of study, which will be filed in the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College. WVU regulations concerning committee membership will apply.\n\nMajor Code: 1730\n\nA candidate for the Ph.D. degree in Animal, Food, and Nutrition Sciences must meet all University, College, Division, and Program requirements as outlined in the WVU Graduate catalog.\n\nProgram Requirements\n\nAll Ph.D. degree candidates are required to follow a planned program of study. The student develops the plan of study during their first year in the program in conjunction with the graduate committee. The plan must be approved by the Director of the Division and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the Davis College.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours *\n\nDoctoral students must satisfactorily complete a set of core courses before they will be admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Certain course requirements may be waived if the student has received equivalent training in prior coursework. Additional coursework pertaining to the student’s area of specialization will be determined by the student’s major professor and graduate committee. Although not required, presentation of research results at meetings of a professional society and submission of manuscripts for publication are encouraged."
