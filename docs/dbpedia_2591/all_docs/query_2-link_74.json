        "text": "Matt earned his bachelor’s degree in athletic training at South Dakota State University. He then spent two years working as an athletic trainer before attending Des Moines University in Iowa to earn his master's degree in physician assistant studies.\n\nFollowing graduation, Matt pursued his passion for orthopedics by spending 23 years working for an orthopedic/sports medicine group in Iowa. Prior to joining OrthoArizona, Matt has spent time in both the clinical and surgical settings, assisting in thousands of joint replacement, sports medicine, and trauma surgeries. He is also very proud of his clinical experience, providing both routine and urgent care orthopedic services, including minor office procedures, casting, splinting, and various types of injections. Matt is proud to share a commitment to quality and compassionate care championed by OrthoArizona.\n\nOutside of the office, Matt spends his free time pursuing an active lifestyle. He enjoys spending time with his family: his wife, Alecia, and three children, especially when it involves hiking, biking, jogging, tennis, golf, or pickleball. His dog, Oakley, is usually not far behind."
