He completed Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\nSince arriving in Singapore, he and his team have actively developed computational and statistical solutions for the analysis of high-throughput molecular data and integration of heterogeneous multi-omics data. His main research topics include network-driven integration of multi-omics data, protein-centric analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data in large-scale clinical studies, and bioinformatics pipeline development for mass spectrometry data extraction in metabolomics and lipidomics. His most recent research is also expanding into systems biology-oriented design and implementation of deep learning algorithms for predictive analytics with massively sparse high-dimensional (-omics) data.\n\nRichard Unwin, Associate Editor\n\nUniversity of Manchester, UK\n\nRichard Unwin graduated from the University of Nottingham with a BSc in Biology and MSc in Oncology before obtaining his PhD from the University of Leeds in 2001 in what was then the new field of proteomics. He subsequently joined The University of Manchester, developing new methods for analysing cancer proteomes, including isobaric tagging, global and targeted analysis of protein phosphorylation, and methods for comparing proteomic and transcriptomic data.\n\nIn 2010 he moved to manage a new mass spectrometry research laboratory within the UK National Health Service, where he worked on the study of proteins and metabolites in chronic disease, and developed new targeted assays which have now been moved into hospital laboratories.\n\nRichard moved back to the University of Manchester in 2017 to continue a research programme developing tools for mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis for the study of age-related chronic diseases. He collaborates widely with academic and commercial partners and has also established a spin-out company, Complement Therapeutics, to develop novel therapeutics and an accompanying precision medicine platform for conditions characterised by dysregulation of the complement system.\n\nCelia Berkers\n\nUtrecht University, Netherlands\n\nCelia Berkers is Professor of Metabolomics at Utrecht University (the Netherlands). She started her PhD at Harvard Medical School (Boston) before moving to the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam) where she completed it in 2010. Berkers did her post-doctoral research in the laboratory of Professor Karen Vousden at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research (Glasgow). She joined the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Group at Utrecht University in 2013 as an independent group leader Metabolomics and was appointed full Professor in 2018. She is currently affiliated with both the Division Cell Biology, Metabolism & Cancer at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and the Biomolecular Mass spectrometry and Proteomics Group at the Faculty of Science.\n\nThe Berkers group develops and applies metabolomics and fluxomics tools to advance our understanding of the (re)wiring of metabolism in health and disease. Her team combines these metabolomics methodologies with advanced in-vitro model systems and cross-omics data analysis, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapy. The team’s research currently focusses on applications in cancer- and immuno-metabolism.\n\nMaria do Rosário Domingues\n\nUniversity of Aveiro, Portugal\n\nRosário Domingues graduated in Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Coimbra (1990), and received her Ph.D. degree in Chemistry (1998), and Habilitation in Biochemistry (2014) at the University of Aveiro. Since 2016 she held the contract of Associated Professor with habilitations in the Mass Spectrometry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro (UA). She is the Director of the Doctoral Program of Biochemistry at UA.\n\nShe has over 25 years of research experience in the field of mass spectrometry and is a well-established researcher in the field of Lipidomics in different fields, such as Lipidomics in Heath and Disease, Oxidative Lipidomic, Algae & Marine, Food and Microbial lipidomics.\n\nShe is the leader of the Lipidomic Laboratory of the Mass Spectrometry Centre of the UA and the Marine Lipidomic lab at CESAM-UA. She is the author of one book and ten book chapters, more than 390 articles published in international journals with referee. She coordinated and participated in several research projects funded by national and European programs (35 in total). In present, she is the coordinator of the European project Cost Action CA19105 Pan-European Network in Lipidomics and EpiLipidomics.\n\nBenjamin Garcia\n\nWashington University in St Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nBenjamin Garcia completed his undergraduate studies at UC Davies with Prof. Carlito Lebrilla, before embarking on a PhD with Professor Donald Hunt at the University of Virginia. After a postdoctoral position with Professor Neil Kelleher at the University of Illinois, Ben took up an Assistant Professor position at Princeton University (2008). He worked as a Professor at the Perelman School of Medicine from 2012 and moved to his current faculty position in 2021.\n\nBen has received numerous awards including a National Science Foundation Early Faculty CAREER award, the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE, awarded by President Obama) and the 2018 American Society for Mass Spectrometry Biemann Medal.\n\nThe Garcia Lab focuses on developing new mass spectrometry based proteomic methodologies for the quantitative characterization of changes in protein and proteome expression and post-translational modification state in response to external stimulus, or during significant biological events. Their research interests include deciphering the epigenetic histone code, the dynamics of proteome-wide PTM mediated biological pathways, the comprehensive characterization of crosstalk between cellular signaling pathways and epigenetic networks and understanding cellular and epigenetic mechanisms involved in normal and disease physiology.\n\nLing Hao\n\nGeorge Washington University, USA\n\nLing Hao is an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the George Washington University in Washington DC.
