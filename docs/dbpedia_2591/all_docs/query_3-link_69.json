        "text": "In 2020 our new Master of Surgery program was launched, allowing students to develop knowledge and skills in surgical specialty areas and non-technical areas such as research, professionalism and leadership.\n\nThe new program has been redesigned to allow students more flexibility to pursue specialised units of study or a research dissertation relevant to their interests.\n\nThe new graduate certificate and graduate diploma level qualifications also enable students greater flexibility with their level of commitment, with the ability to upgrade to the full master's program on completion.\n\nStudents completing the masters' will have the opportunity to complete a dissertation (which is now up to 10,000 words and is worth 12 credit points).\n\nExamples of the subspecialties themes available for dissertations include:\n\nbreast surgery,\n\ncardiothoracic surgery,\n\ncolorectal surgery,\n\nendocrine surgery,\n\nhand surgery,\n\nhead and neck surgery,\n\nneurosurgery,\n\northopaedic surgery,\n\notorhinolaryngology,\n\npaediatric surgery,\n\nplastic/reconstructive surgery,\n\nsurgical oncology,\n\nsurgical outcomes,\n\ntransplant surgery,\n\ntrauma surgery,\n\nupper gastrointestinal surgery,\n\nurology, and\n\nvascular and endovascular surgery.\n\nChoose from a:\n\nGraduate Certificate of Surgery\n\nGraduate Diploma of Surgery\n\nMaster of Surgery\n\nOur unique Graduate Certificate of Advanced Clinical Skills is a whole body dissection course and is the only one of it's kind in Australia. This gold standard course, taught by small groups of subspecialist surgeons will enable you to stand out in the operating room.\n\nIt provides you with a sound knowledge and understanding of regional surgical anatomy through a series of cadaveric dissections, including head and neck, thorax, limbs or abdomen pelvis and perineum. This will give you added confidence throughout your surgical career.\n\nUnits of study from this course can be rolled into the Master of Surgery on completion.\n\nGraduate Certificate in Advanced Clinical Skills (Surgical Anatomy)\n\nThe dissertation component of your course should reflect your interest in a particular field of surgery based on a research project written in the format of an academic composition.\n\nBefore 2020, dissertations had a word limit of 20,000 and equated to 18 credit points of study. In the new program, a dissertation should be no more than 10,000 words and count toward 12 credit points of study.\n\nA dissertation encompasses self-directed study with supervision by one or more academics, one of whom should be an academic staff member of the University. The Specialty of Surgery can assist you if your supervisor is not affiliated with the University of Sydney. Find out more about our list of potential supervisors affiliated with the University of Sydney.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for your own work, which is undertaken in collaboration with a local supervisor who is agreeable to be responsible for you offering tailored guidance and constructive feedback throughout the course of your research.\n\nYou are responsible for approaching a local supervisor at your hospital and ensuring there is clear communication in terms of individual responsibilities, a common understanding of the aims of your project, including key milestones, a realistic working timetable and opportunities for regular meetings with feedback to ensure that the project stays on track.\n\nSuitable projects for the dissertation may include:\n\nthe collection and analysis of new data based on a common theme,\n\nthe analysis of an established dataset,\n\na randomised clinical trial,\n\na systematic review and/or meta-analysis, or\n\na prospective or retrospective cohort study\n\nCandidates must discuss their project with their local supervisor before the commencement of their research, including seeking appropriate ethics approval and statistical support. One-on-one support for ethics, data management and statistics may also be sought from the faculty. All students are required to comply with the Academic honesty Guidelines of the University of Sydney. The dissertation must be submitted by Turnitin to check for plagiarism.\n\nThe dissertation is assembled in two parts (Dissertation A and Dissertation B), which need to be completed in a minimum of one year of full-time study or two years of part-time study.\n\nThe format of the dissertation should broadly follow that of an original article as published in the issues of the ANZ J. Surg. It should include an introduction followed by an aim(s) (research questions), the methods used, results obtained, a critical discussion of your findings in light of existing knowledge and any limitations of the study, followed by concluding remarks and/or recommendations together with a list of pertinent correctly cited references. More details of the structure of the dissertation can be found here and by watching this video.\n\nThe dissertation must be undertaken during your candidature such that any work or publications written prior to or outside the enrolment period are not acceptable.\n\nThere is an option to submit published work based on research undertaken during the period of candidature, which may be enclosed as an appendix to the detailed body of the work.\n\nThe dissertation guidelines, submission requirements and cover sheet are accessible below. Please note that all enquiries regarding the dissertation should be directed towards your supervisor in the first instance or the unit coordinators:\n\nDissertation Part A: Peter Moritz (peter.moritz@sydney.edu.au)\n\nDissertation Part B: Nazim Bhimani (nazim.bhimani@sydney.edu.au)\n\nStudents wishing to enrol in Dissertation Part A and Part B will be at the discretion of the unit coordinators, who will determine if the project meets the minimum requirements. This will be determined by completing the dissertation registration form, which will be emailed to students by the Education Support Officer. Some relevant documentation for these units include:\n\nDissertation guidelines\n\nDissertation registration form\n\nFurther Information for students\n\nDissertation Part A Final Assessment guidelines\n\nDissertation Part B Final Assessment guidelines"
