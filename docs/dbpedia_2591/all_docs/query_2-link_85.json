        "text": "Overview 2\n\nThe Ohio State University Moritz College of Law is an integral part of one of the world’s great educational institutions. Founded in 1891 and consistently the top-ranked law school in the state of Ohio, the Moritz College of Law has grown into one of the nation’s pre-eminent public law schools and one of the most respected law schools in the world.\n\nA collegial community of approximately 570 students and more than 50 faculty members, Moritz is known for its rigorous academic program, the pioneering research of its world-class faculty, a deep commitment to teaching and professional training, and the development of future leaders.\n\nThe college’s more than 10,000 alumni are central to its national reputation. Graduates include justices of the Supreme Court of Ohio, federal appeals and district court judges, U.S. senators, U.S. representatives, governors, managing partners in law firms of all sizes, chief executive officers of Fortune 500 corporations, professors at law schools across the country, and prominent attorneys in private practice, government service, and public interest law firms.\n\nOur alumni are genuinely interested in engaging with and mentoring today’s students. They share a special connection and a desire to help fellow “Moritzers” find professional success.\n\nLikewise, the administration at the Moritz College of Law is committed to advancing the quality and reputation of the college nationally and internationally through ongoing improvements to the academic program and student services.\n\nStudent-Faculty Ratio 3\n\n10.3:1\n\nAdmission Criteria 4\n\nLSAT GPA 25th-75th Percentile 156-161 3.43-3.79 Median* 159 3.61\n\nThe above LSAT and GPA data pertain to the 2016 entering class.\n\nDirector of admissions Kathy S. Northern Application deadline March 31\n\nLaw School Admissions details based on 2016 data.\n\n*Medians have been calculated by averaging the 25th- and 75th-percentile values released by the law schools and have been rounded up to the nearest whole number for LSAT scores and to the nearest one-hundredth for GPAs.\n\nAdmission Statistics 4\n\nApproximate number of applications 1574 Number accepted 771 Percentage accepted 49.%\n\nThe above admission details are based on 2015 data.\n\nLaw School Cost 5\n\nExpenses\n\nTuition and fees Full-time: $29,668 per year (in-state)\n\n$44,620 per year (out-of-state) Room and board $13,000 Books $2,400 Miscellaneous expenses $5,486\n\nClass Ranking and Grades 6\n\nGrading Policy\n\nWhat follows is the grading policy for JD students. LL.M. students should scroll down further for the grading policy for that program. Students receive both a letter and number grade – for example, 85B. Each number grade corresponds to a specific letter grade (i.e., numbers between 93 and 100 correspond to a letter grade of A.). Further, each letter grade has its own point value on a 4.0 scale.\n\nLetter Grade Numerical Grade Grade Point Value (assigned to the letter grade) A 93-100 4.0 A- 90-92 3.7 B+ 87-89 3.3 B 83-86 3.0 B- 80-82 2.7 C+ 77-79 2.3 C 70-76 2.0 D 65-69 1.0 E 60-64 0.0\n\nThe college uses the Grade Point Average (GPA) from the letter grades to ascertain Academic Standing, Dismissal, Probation and Readmission as detailed in Chapter 6 in the Faculty Rules. A student is in good standing if he or she has an average GPA of 2.0 or better.\n\nStudents also have a Numerical Average, which is calculated by averaging the Numerical Grade. For this average, first year courses are weighted at 50 percent compared to upper-level courses, regardless of when the courses are taken. This Numerical Average is used to establish class rankings. Class rankings are computed after the second semester ends and all grades are in. Individual class ranks are disclosed confidentially to the students in the top 5 percent of the class. The remainder of the class is not given individual class ranks. Instead, the college provides a class ranking information sheet for each class that shows the numerical grade average range for certain percentage ranges in the top half of the class. Class ranking information sheets are found here.\n\nGrade Normalization (Curve)7\n\nGrade Distribution Policy\n\nIn an effort to treat all students fairly, the Moritz College of Law has a long-standing grade distribution policy. The underlying reasons for the policy are to promote a common faculty-wide grading standard and to reduce instances in which different professors use different grading standards.\n\nThe college’s policy suggests the following grade distribution to the teachers of first-year courses:\n\nA’s 30% B’s 60% C’s 10% D, E Not more than 4 percent with the direction that a D or E should be given only when inferior performance is clearly demonstrated\n\nFor second- and third-year courses, the grade distribution is based on the past average letter grade performance of the students as a whole who registered for a particular course. A professor receives a grade distribution for the students enrolled in his or her course that semester.\n\nThere are no names on the grade distribution, so the profile in no way focuses on an individual student. For example, an Evidence professor might receive a distribution stating that, based on past performance, 20 students would be expected to receive A’s; 30 students would be expected to receive B’s; and 15 students would be expected to receive C’s\n\nHonors 8\n\nHonor % of Class Receiving Order of the Coif A national honorary scholastic society for lawyers. summa cum laude Signifies graduation within the upper 3% of the class. magna cum laude Signifies graduation within the upper 10% of the class. cum laude Signifies graduation within the upper 25% of the class.\n\nAwards 9\n\nName of Award Awarded for/to Distinguished Alumna/us Award Given annually to a Moritz Law graduate for exceptional achievement or outstanding service to the college or community.

Five legal journals are published by The Ohio State Moritz College of Law. These leading publications publish innovative and relevant scholarly articles by law professors and legal scholars from across the country and around the world as well as student written notes and comments of professional interest to lawyers and policy makers.\n\nThe Ohio State Law Journal is a generalist law review publishing legal scholarship in all areas. The journal, which started publication in 1935, is edited by students and publishes eight issues each year. In April 2012, OSLJ launched Furthermore, an online supplement to the print version.\n\nThe Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution. Founded in 1985, the Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution (JDR) is a student-edited publication dedicated to the exploration of alternative methods of dispute resolution, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, summary jury trials, and mini-trials.\n\nThe Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law is a peer-evaluated, faculty-student cooperative venture. Published semiannually, it provides useful, interesting, and provocative commentary on critical issues of interest to the national, and even international, criminal justice community.\n\nI/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society is an interdisciplinary journal of research and commentary concentrating on the intersection of law, policy, and information technology. Published semiannually, it is faculty-edited in collaboration with student editors.\n\nThe Ohio State Entrepreneurial Business Law Journal (OSEBLJ) is nationally renowned for its intersection of business and the law. Created and managed by students, this semi-annual journal explores the legal issues facing entrepreneurs, small business owners, and venture capitalists.\n\nMoot Court 11\n\nStudents at Moritz can gain experience in a variety of lawyering skills by competing in the intramural and interscholastic competitions administered by the Moot Court and Lawyering Skills Program. The Program’s Director, Elizabeth Sherowski, is assisted by the Moot Court and Lawyering Skills Governing Board, which consists of a Chief Justice, seven Executive Justices, and nine Associate Justices.\n\nThe Moot Court & Lawyering Skills Governing Board is responsible for the following intramural competitions at Moritz:\n\nJames K.L. Lawrence Negotiations Competition (open to all 2Ls & 3Ls)\n\nAppellate Advocacy Performance Arguments (open to 2Ls)\n\nMoritz Representation in Mediation Competition (open to all 2Ls & 3Ls)\n\nHerman Moot Court Competition (open to all 2Ls)*\n\n1L Moot Court Competition (open to all 1Ls)\n\nMichael F. Colley Trial Competition (open to all 2Ls & 3Ls who have taken or are currently taking Evidence)\n\n*Represents one of two opportunities for 2Ls to earn a slot on one of twelve travel teams for the following academic year.\n\nThe Governing Board also assists the Director in supervising the Travel Team Program, where second- and third-year law students represent Moritz at moot court and lawyering skills competitions across the country. Recent Travel Team Program successes include:\n\n2013 National Champions, Sutherland Cup Moot Court Competition\n\n2013 Best National Advocate, ABA National Appellate Advocacy Competition\n\n2013 National Semifinalists, ABA National Appellate Advocacy Competition\n\n2013 Best Mediator, Great Lakes Mediation Tournament\n\n2012 Regional Champions, National Moot Court Competition\n\n2012 Regional Champions, ABA Negotiation Competition\n\nClinical Programs 12\n\nThe clinical programs at Moritz provide an approach to clinical education that is distinctive among American law schools. With origins dating back to 1935, Ohio State was an early pioneer in clinical legal education. As a result, faculty members of the College have long recognized that problem-solving, factual investigation, counseling, negotiation, and litigation skills are best learned by combining the actual practice of law with classroom education. J.D. students are able to take responsibility for their own cases, with an intensive academic experience in the classroom.\n\nIn the clinics, students work closely with expert faculty to provide essential representation to real clients. Many of the clinics are taught by two-person faculty teams. The faculty both provide expertise in the theory and doctrine of a particular area of law and help students develop hands-on legal experience. Under the guidance and mentoring of faculty, law students get a taste of the satisfactions and challenges of a legal career. In addition, students benefit from an average ratio of one faculty member to eight students, offering a level of learning possible only through such close supervision.\n\nThe law school offers the following clinical programs:\n\nCivil Law Clinic\n\nCriminal Defense Clinic\n\nEntrepreneurial Business Law Clinic\n\nCriminal Prosecution Clinic\n\nMediation Clinic\n\nJustice For Children Clinic\n\nLegislation Clinic\n\nPlacement Facts 13\n\nStarting Salaries (2015 Graduates Employed Full-Time)\n\nPrivate sector (25th-75th percentile) $ 59,000 - $105,000 Median in the private sector $75,000 Median in public service $50,000\n\nEmployment Details\n\nGraduates known to be employed at graduation 55.7% Graduates known to be employed ten months after graduation 85.8%\n\nAreas of Legal Practice\n\nGraduates Employed In Percentage Law Firms 42.1% Business and Industry 27.5% Government 18.1% Judicial Clerkships 5.3% Public Interest Organizations 4.1% Academia 2.9% Unknown 0%\n\nExternships/Internships 14-15\n\nExternships\n\nStudents may choose between two externship programs: the Judicial Externship Program and the Public Interest/Governmental Externship Program.

The externship lasts at least seven weeks and students work at least 20 hours per week, in conjunction with taking classes. Students are paired with a supervisor at their externship, and the supervisor ensures that at least 80 percent of the student’s time is substantive work.\n\nStudent Organizations 16\n\nAdvocates for Children\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n\nAmerican Constitution Society\n\nAsian/Pacific American Law Students Association\n\nBlack Law Students Association\n\nBeyond the Law\n\nBusiness Law Society\n\nChristian Legal Society *\n\nCriminal Law Society\n\nDispute Resolution and Youth\n\nEnvironmental Law Association\n\nFederalist Society\n\nHealth Law Society\n\nI/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society\n\nImmigration Law Society\n\nIntellectual Property Law Society\n\nInter-Professional Council\n\nInternational Justice Mission\n\nInternational Law Society\n\nJ.
