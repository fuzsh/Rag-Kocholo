        "text": "Moritz Lazarus (born Sept. 15, 1824, Filehne, Prussia [now Wieleń, Pol.]—died April 13, 1903, Meran, Austria [now Merano, Italy]) was a Jewish philosopher and psychologist, a leading opponent of anti-Semitism in his time and a founder of comparative psychology.\n\nThe son of a rabbinical scholar, Lazarus studied Hebrew literature and history, law, and philosophy at Berlin. He served as professor at Bern (1860–66), at the Kriegs Akademie in Berlin (1867–73), and at the Friedrich Wilhelm University (now Humboldt University of Berlin) in Berlin (1873).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhilosophy 101\n\nThe fundamental principle of Lazarus’ philosophy stated that truth must be sought not in metaphysical or a priori abstractions but in psychological investigation; further, this investigation cannot confine itself successfully to the individual consciousness but must be devoted primarily to society as a whole. The psychologist must study humanity from the historical or comparative standpoint, analyzing the elements that constitute the fabric of society, with its customs, its conventions, and the main tendencies of its evolution. To further this Völkerpsychologie (German: “folk,” or comparative, psychology), he founded, with the philologist H. Steinthal, the journal Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft (1859). His chief philosophical work is Das Leben der Seele, 3 vol. (1855–57; “The Life of the Soul”)."
