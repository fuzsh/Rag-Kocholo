        "text": "Dean’s List\n\nDuring each academic term, students who have earned a minimum GPA of 3.6 or better in 12 or more points of letter credit in the preceding term are placed on the Dean’s List.\n\nThe grade P is considered neutral when the averages are figured, and the dividing factor is reduced by the number of points taken for Pass credit. Students who have received grades of D, F, W (or UW pre-Spring 2014) during the term are not eligible for consideration. In any given semester, the mark of YC (year course) precludes the attainment of Dean's List status until the grade for the entire year's coursework is awarded. Students who receive the grade of IN (incomplete), approved in advance by the Committee on Academic Standing, are eligible for Dean’s List only after all IN grades are changed to letter grades. Students who have been found responsible by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for a violation of academic integrity will not be eligible for the Dean’s List during the term of the sanction.\n\nCollege (Latin) Honors\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts degree will be awarded with honors in three categories (cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude) to the top 25 percent of the graduating class. Honors are determined by an undergraduate student's cumulative GPA for all work at Columbia, with the top 5 percent of the graduating class being awarded summa cum laude, the next 10 percent being awarded magna cum laude, and the remaining 10 percent awarded cum laude.\n\nCollege honors are the highest academic recognition awarded by the College. There is no separate consideration of honors for October or February graduates. The honor is officially noted on the diploma and transcript of students who have graduated. October and February graduates may ask the Registrar to add an honors notation to an already issued diploma.\n\nBoth academic standing and disciplinary standing are taken into consideration when awarding College honors.\n\nLatin Honors are calculated based on student academic achievement in all semesters at Columbia, including the final semester. Since final grades for seniors for spring semester classes can be submitted only a few days before graduation, and those grades must be part of a student's transcript to be eligible, Latin Honors are typically announced following graduation.\n\nValedictorian and Salutatorian\n\nThe Committee on Honors, Awards, and Prizes reviews the academic records of the most exceptional students nominated by the faculty for Valedictorian and Salutatorian. Selection is based not on GPA alone, but on the breadth, depth, rigor of academic program, high quality of academic achievement, departmental recommendations, and outstanding academic work beyond that which is required for the degree.\n\nThe Committee on Honors, Awards, and Prizes considers both academic standing and disciplinary standing within the College when awarding Valedictorian and Salutatorian.\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nDepartmental honors may be established and awarded by any Columbia College department or academic program, and is recorded on a student’s final transcript. Students should consult with their director of undergraduate studies no later than the beginning of the first term of their senior year if they wish to be considered for departmental honors. Students who are awarded departmental honors are notified by their department in mid-May. Not all departments and programs offer departmental honors.\n\nCollege guidelines for departmental honors include the following four criteria:\n\nDepartmental honors are awarded to no more than 10%, or, in small departments, one member, of the graduating majors (including all October, February, and May degrees);\n\nA grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.6 in major courses is expected for a student to be considered for departmental honors;\n\nAn honors thesis or equivalent project of high quality should be required by each department or academic program in order to receive departmental honors;\n\nAcademic departments and programs consider both academic standing and disciplinary standing within the College when awarding departmental honors. Please note that special concentrations are not eligible for consideration for departmental honors.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\n\nThis academic society was founded in 1776 to recognize and celebrate friendship, morality, and learning. The Columbia College Delta chapter was formed in 1869. Each year, 10% of the senior class are inducted into Phi Beta Kappa by faculty who are members of the society. Two percent are elected in the fall and the other eight percent are elected in the spring. Selection is based not only on academic achievement, but also on evidence of intellectual promise, character, and achievement outside the classroom. Academic achievement is measured by the strength and rigor of the chosen academic program, as well as by grades and faculty recommendations. Students may not apply for Phi Beta Kappa nor may they solicit faculty for recommendations.\n\nAs with graduation honors, October and February graduates are considered along with May graduates. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is noted on a student’s transcript.\n\nThe faculty Phi Beta Kappa selection committee considers both academic standing and disciplinary standing within the College when electing new members to the society.\n\nWhile prizes are typically awarded annually, they are done so at the discretion of respective selection committees. Hence, should a selection committee decide, in a particular year, that there are no suitable candidates; the prize will not be awarded. Unless otherwise noted, these prizes are awarded to Columbia College students only.\n\nGeneral Prizes\n\nALUMNI ASSOCIATION ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n\n(1947) A trophy, in the form of a Columbia lion, awarded annually to the member of the senior class who is judged to be most outstanding for qualities of mind, character, and service to the College.\n\nALUMNI PRIZE\n\n(1858) Awarded annually by the Alumni Association to the senior judged by classmates to be the most faithful and deserving.\n\nCHARLES H.
