        "text": "\"For each successive class of phenomena, a new calculus or a new geometry, as the case might be, which might prove not wholly inadequate to the subtlety of nature.\"\n\n- Henry John Stephen Smith, as quoted in Nature, Volume 8, page 450 (1873).\n\n\"In general the position as regards all such new calculi is this - That one cannot accomplish by them anything that could not be accomplished without them. However, the advantage is, that, provided such a calculus corresponds to the inmost nature of frequent needs, anyone who masters it thoroughly is able - without the unconscious inspiration of genius which no one can command - to solve the respective problems, indeed to solve them mechanically in complicated cases in which, without such aid, even genius becomes powerless. Such is the case with the invention of general algebra, with the differential calculus, and in a more limited region with Lagrange's calculus of variations, with my calculus of congruences, and with Mobius' calculus. Such conceptions unite, as it were, into an organic whole countless problems which otherwise would remain isolated and require for their separate solution more or less application of inventive genius.\"\n\n- Carl Friedrich Gauss, as quoted in Carl Friedrich Gauss: Werke, Volume 8, page 298; and as quoted in Robert Edouard Moritz's book Memorabilia Mathematica or The Philomath's Quotation Book, quotation #1215 (1914).\n\n\"How thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which, at the same time, assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments.\"\n\n- David Hilbert, as quoted in Robert Edouard Moritz's book Memorabilia Mathematica or The Philomath's Quotation Book (1914).\n\n\"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\"\n\n- Alfred North Whitehead, from his book An Introduction to Mathematics (1911).\n\n\"A large part of mathematics which becomes useful developed with absolutely no desire to be useful, and in a situation where nobody could possibly know in what area it would become useful; and there were no general indications that it would ever be so. By and large it is uniformly true in mathematics that there is a time lapse between a mathematical discovery and the moment when it is useful; and that this lapse of time can be anything from 30 to 100 years, in some cases even more; and that the whole system seems to function without any direction, without any reference to usefulness, and without any desire to do things which are useful.\"\n\n- John von Neumann, from “The Role of Mathematics in the Sciences and in Society\" a 1954 address to Princeton alumni, published in John von Neumann : Collected Works edited by A. H. Taub (1963); also quoted in Out of the Mouths of Mathematicians : A Quotation Book for Philomaths by R.

Curiosity, which may or may not eventuate in something useful, is probably the outstanding characteristic of modern thinking. It is not new. It goes back to Galileo, Bacon, and to Sir Isaac Newton, and it must be absolutely unhampered. Institutions of learning should be devoted to the cultivation of curiosity and the less they are deflected by considerations of immediacy of application, the more likely they are to contribute not only to human welfare but to the equally important satisfaction of intellectual interest which may indeed be said to have become the ruling passion of intellectual life in modern times.”\n\n- Abraham Flexner, from his article “The usefulness of useless ideas”, Harper’s Magazine, Issue 179, 1939.\n\n“[Hans Christian] Oersted would never have made his great discovery of the action of galvanic currents on magnets had he stopped in his researches to consider in what manner they could possibly be turned to practical account; and so we would not now be able to boast of the wonders done by the electric telegraphs. Indeed, no great law in Natural Philosophy has ever been discovered for its practical implications, but the instances are innumerable of investigations apparently quite useless in this narrow sense of the word which have led to the most valuable results.”\n\n- William Thompson (a.k.a. Lord Kelvin), from his “Introductory lecture to the course of natural philosophy”, published in Silvanus Phillips Thompson’s book The Life of Lord Kelvin (1910).\n\n“I would undervalue [scholastic] grades based on knowing things, and find ways to reward curiosity.

One, akin to conquering a mountain peak, consists of solving a problem which has remained unsolved for a long time and has commanded the attention of many mathematicians. The other is exploring new territory.\"\n\n- Mark Kac, from Chapter 2 of his autobiography Enigmas of Chance (1985).\n\n\"There seem to be two kinds of discovery. In one kind, the goal is given first, and then the mind goes from the goal to the means, that is, from the question to the solution. In the other kind, the mind goes from the means to the goal, that is, the mind first discovers a fact and then seeks a use for it. In mathematics, and elsewhere, most significant discoveries are of the second kind. As Hadamard has put it, 'Practical application is found by not looking for it, and one can say that the whole progress of civilization rests on that principle.' An outstanding example in mathematics is the exhaustive study of the conics by the Greeks, and then, some two -semitism. thousand years later, Kepler's stunning application of the Greek findings to the movement of the planets in the solar system.\"\n\n- Howard Eves, from his book Mathematical Circles Squared, pages 167 and 168 (1972).\n\n\"... we find in the history of ideas mutations which do not seem to correspond to any obvious need, and at first sight appear as mere playful whimsies - such as Apollonius' work on conic sections, or the non-Euclidean geometries, whose practical value became apparent only later.\"\n\n- Arthur Koestler, from his book The Sleepwalkers(1959).\n\nFrom the 3rd century onwards, orthodox Christianity, based on a Hebrew story and worshipping the Jew Jesus, also led many campaigns of anti-semitism.\n\n- Ivor Grattan-Guinness, from his book The Rainbow of Mathematics: A History of the Mathematical Sciences (2000).\n\n‘’It [ non-Euclidean geometry ] would be ranked among the most famous achievements of the entire [nineteenth] century, but up to 1860 the interest was rather slight.”\n\n- Ivor Grattan-Guinness, from his book The Rainbow of Mathematics: A History of the Mathematical Sciences (2000).\n\n\"Newton's epoch-making works (1669, 1671) were offered to the Royal Society and Cambridge University Press but, incredible as it now seems, were rejected for publication.\"\n\n- John Stillwell, from his book Mathematics and Its History (2010).\n\n\"New theories, methods, or interventions that challenge dogma, people in power, or \"the way we've always done it\" can run into resistance, ridicule, and minds shut tight.

A distinguished scientist, she discovered genetic transposition (\"jumping genes\"), a stunning advance that earned her dismissive ridicule and ostracism from colleagues for two decades. ... History furnishes all too many examples of those labeled lightweights, fools, fanatics, true believers, pseudoscientists, quacks, frauds, or heretics: Galileo Galilei, Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, Ruth Sager, Ignaz Semmelweis, to name a few. ... Their unwavering loyalty to what they believe to be true, their persistence in looking for evidence to support their vision, and their determination to hold onto their belief despite the resistance it arouses inspire us.\"\n\n- Kenneth S.

Raup, from his book The Nemesis Affair: A Story of the Death of Dinosaurs and the Ways of Science (1999).\n\n“Thus dramatic changes or revolutions in a field of science are often made by outsiders or \"trespassers\" who do not define their expertise as mastery of the old methods or by newcomers who are not yet beholden to the old ways.”\n\n- David Ellerman, from his book Intellectual Trespassing as a Way of Life: Essays in Philosophy, Economics, and Mathematics, (1995).\n\n\"More than 350 years after the Roman Catholic Church condemned Galileo, Pope John Paul II is poised to rectify one of the Church's most infamous wrongs -- the persecution of the Italian astronomer and physicist for proving the Earth moves around the Sun.\"\n\n- Alan Cowell, from his article \"After 350 Years, Vatican Says Galileo Was Right: It Moves\" in The New York Times, 31 October 1992.\n\n\"Yet Gauss, universally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his day, did not publicize his findings. ... In an 1829 letter to a confidant, Gauss observed that he had no plans 'to work up my very extensive researches for publication, and perhaps they will never appear in my lifetime, for I fear the howl of the Boeotians if I speak my opinion out-loud.' ... Obviously Gauss had little regard for the reception of the mathematical community for his new ideas.\"\n\n- William Dunham, as quoted in his book Journey Through Genius (1990).\n\n\"Of all of Gauss' creations, the most revolutionary in concept and the most weighty in affecting the course of mathematics and science is non-Euclidean geometry. ... Since Gauss did not make known many of his brilliant creations, other mathematicians [such as Lobatchevsky and Bolyai] worked toward and arrived at the same results independently. ... In the case of non-Euclidean geometry, Gauss had an additional reason for not publishing his work. ... [A]nyone professing to present another geometry conflicting with Euclid's would undoubtedly have been judged insane not only by the general public, which was ignorant of all geometry, but by mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers. ... There are limits to allowable heterodoxy, even in mathematics, and these limits are soon reached in every era.\"\n\n- Morris Kline, from his book Mathematics and the Physical World (1959).\n\n\"For thirty years or so after the publication of Lobatchevsky's and Bolyai's works all but a few mathematicians ignored the non-Euclidean geometries. ... The mere fact that there can be alternative geometries was in itself a shock.\"\n\n- Morris Kline, from his book Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty (1980).\n\n“His [Nikolai Lobachevsky’s] remarkable discoveries [non-Euclidean geometry], along with those of an even more neglected mathematician, Janos Bolyai, are now recognised as the start of a gigantic revolution in human thought about geometry and the nature of physical space. But it is ever the fate of pioneers to be misrepresented and misunderstood. Ideas that should have been hailed for their originality are routinely denounced as nonsense, and their originators receive little recognition. Hostility is more likely; think of evolution and climate change. I sometimes feel that the human race doesn’t deserve its great thinkers. When they show us the stars, prejudice and lack of imagination drag us all back into the mud.”\n\n- Ian Stewart, from his book Significant Figures(2017).\n\n\"One may say without great exaggeration that Grassmann invented linear algebra ... Linear algebra has become a part of the mainstream of mathematics, though Grassmann gets scant credit for it ... His achievements in mathematics were virtually unrecognized, and it has taken a century for their importance to become visible.\"\n\n- Desmond Fearnlet-Sander, from his article \"Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra\" published in The American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 86 (1979).\n\n\"Grassmann [1809-1877] invented what is now called exterior algebra. This was joined to Hamilton's quaternions by Clifford in 1878. ... Clifford algebras are used today in the theory of quadratic forms and in relativistic quantum mechanics. Clifford algebras appear together with Grassmann's exterior algebra in differential geometry. ... It is interesting to see just how many leading mathematicians failed to recognise that the mathematics Grassmann presented would become the basic foundation of the subject in 100 years time.\"\n\n- John O'Connor and Edmund Robertson, from their article \"Hermann Günter Grassmann\", The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive website, University of St Andrews (2005).\n\n\"The fame of the creator of a new mathematical concept has a powerful, almost a controlling, role in the acceptance of that mathematical concept, at least if the new concept breaks with tradition. Compare the reception accorded [William Rowan] Hamilton's Lectures on Quaternions (1853) with that of [Hermann] Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre (1844). Both are among the classics of mathematics, yet the work of the former author, who was already famous for empirically confirmed results, was greeted with lavish praise in reviews by authors who had not read his book, whereas the book of Grassmann, an almost unpublished high school teacher, received but one review (by its author!) and found, before it was used for waste paper in the early 1860's, only a handful of readers. Or consider the fate of [Nikolai] Lobachevsky and [János] Bolyai, whose publications remained as unknown as their authors until, thirty years after their publications, some posthumously published letters of the illustrious [Carl Friedrich] Gauss led mathematicians to take an interest in non-Euclidean geometry.\"\n\n- Michael J. Crowe, from his article \"Ten “Laws” concerning patterns of change in the history of mathematics\" in Historia Mathematica (May of 1975).\n\n\"The first person to really come to understand the problem of the parallels was Gauss. He began work on the fifth postulate in 1792 while only 15 years old, at first attempting to prove the parallels postulate from the other four. By 1813 he had made little progress and wrote:\n\nIn the theory of parallels we are even now not further than Euclid. This is a shameful part of mathematics...\n\n\"However by 1817 Gauss had become convinced that the fifth postulate was independent of the other four postulates. He began to work out the consequences of a geometry in which more than one line can be drawn through a given point parallel to a given line. Perhaps most surprisingly of all Gauss never published this work but kept it a secret. At this time thinking was dominated by Kant who had stated that Euclidean geometry is the inevitable necessity of thought and Gauss disliked controversy.\n\n\"Gauss discussed the theory of parallels with his friend, the mathematician Farkas Bolyai who made several false proofs of the parallel postulate. Farkas Bolyai taught his son, János Bolyai, mathematics but, despite advising his son not to waste one hour's time on that problem of the problem of the fifth postulate, János Bolyai did work on the problem.\n\n\"In 1823 János Bolyai wrote to his father saying I have discovered things so wonderful that I was astounded ... out of nothing I have created a strange new world. However it took Bolyai a further two years before it was all written down and he published his strange new world as a 24 page appendix to his father's book, although just to confuse future generations the appendix was published before the book itself.\n\n\"Gauss, after reading the 24 pages, described János Bolyai in these words while writing to a friend: I regard this young geometer Bolyai as a genius of the first order. However in some sense Bolyai only assumed that the new geometry was possible. He then followed the consequences in a not too dissimilar fashion from those who had chosen to assume the fifth postulate was false and seek a contradiction. However the real breakthrough was the belief that the new geometry was possible. Gauss, however impressed he sounded in the above quote with Bolyai, rather devastated Bolyai by telling him that he (Gauss) had discovered all this earlier but had not published. Although this must undoubtedly have been true, it detracts in no way from Bolyai's incredible breakthrough.\n\n\"Nor is Bolyai's work diminished because Lobachevsky published a work on non-Euclidean geometry in 1829. Neither Bolyai nor Gauss knew of Lobachevsky's work, mainly because it was only published in Russian in the Kazan Messenger a local university publication. Lobachevsky's attempt to reach a wider audience had failed when his paper was rejected by [the mathematician Mikhail Vasilyevich] Ostrogradski.\n\n\"In fact Lobachevsky fared no better than Bolyai in gaining public recognition for his momentous work. He published \"Geometrical investigations on the theory of parallels\" in 1840 which, in its 61 pages, gives the clearest account of Lobachevsky's work. The publication of an account in French in Crelle's Journal in 1837 brought his work on non-Euclidean geometry to a wide audience but the mathematical community was not ready to accept ideas so revolutionary.\"\n\n- John O'Connor and Edmund Robertson, from their article \"Non-Euclidean geometry\", The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive website, University of St Andrews (1996).\n\n\"By and large, the reaction to Bolyai and Lobachevskii's ideas during their lifetimes was one of neglect and hostility, and they died unaware of the success their discoveries would ultimately have. ... [Their work] was dismissed with scorn, as if it were self-evident that it was wrong: so wrong that it would be a waste of time finding the error it surely contained, so wrong that the right response was to heap ridicule upon its authors or simply dismiss them without comment.\"\n\n- Jeremy Gray, from his article \"Geometry\" in the book The Princeton Companion to Mathematics(2010).\n\n\"Georg Cantor (1845 - 1918), the creator of transfinite set theory, is one of the most imaginative and controversial figures in the history of mathematics. ... Because his views were unorthodox, they stimulated lively debate and at times vigorous denunciation. Leopold Kronecker considered Cantor a scientific charlatan, a renegade, a \"corrupter of youth,\" but Bertrand Russell described him as one of the greatest intellects of the nineteenth century. David Hilbert believed Cantor had created a new paradise for mathematicians, though others, notably Henri Poincare, thought set theory and Cantor's transfinite numbers represented a grave mathematical malady, a perverse pathological illness that would one day be cured. ... Cantor's creation of transfinite set theory was an achievement of major consequence in the history of mathematics.\"\n\n- Joseph Dauben, from his book Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite, pages 1 and 6 (1990).\n\n\"Resistance to irrationals [i.e., irrational numbers] continued for thousands of years. In the late nineteenth century, when the gifted German mathematician Georg Cantor did groundbreaking work to put them on firmer footing, his former teacher, a crab named Leopold Kronecker who \"opposed\" the irrationals, violently disagreed with Cantor and sabotaged his career at every turn. Cantor, unable to tolerate this, had a breakdown and spent his last days in a mental institution.\"\n\n- Leonard Mlodinow, from his book Euclid's Window: The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace (2001).\n\n\"Mathematicians, let it be known, are often no less illogical, no less closed-minded, and no less predatory than most men. Like other closed minds they shield their obtuseness behind the curtain of established ways of thinking while they hurl charges of madness against the men who would tear apart the fabric.\"\n\n- Morris Kline, from his book Mathematics in Western Culture (1953).\n\n\"It all comes down to the adage that it is the mathematical community that decides what is worthwhile. And that decision is based on intrinsic merit but also on fashion. This may seem odd to the uninitiated, but mathematics has vogues, cliques, and prejudices, just as art surely, music, or literature, or the clothing industries do.\"\n\n- Steven G. Krantz, from his book The Proof is in the Pudding: The Changing Nature of Mathematical Proof (2011).\n\n\"One often sees it stated that Frege's work was worthless because of the inconsistency pointed out by [Bertrand] Russell. In fact this is far from the truth and one must view Frege as the person who made one of the most important contributions to the foundations of mathematics that has ever been made. In fact in many ways Russell is correct when he wrote in his History of Western Philosophy: 'In spite of the epoch-making nature of [Frege's] discoveries, he remained wholly without recognition until I drew attention to him in 1903.' ... [Joan] Weiner writes in [her book Frege: Past Masters, 1999]: 'Gottlob Frege's writings have had a profound influence on contemporary thought. His revolutionary new logic was the origin of modern mathematical logic - a field of import not only to abstract mathematics, but also to computer science and philosophy.' \"\n\n- John O'Connor and Edmund Robertson, from their article \"Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege\", The MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, University of St Andrews (2002).\n\n\"Gregor Mendel is accorded a special place in the history of genetics. ... Poignantly overshadowing the creative brilliance of Mendel's work is the fact that it was virtually ignored for thirty-four years. Only after the dramatic rediscovery in 1900 - sixteen years after Mendel's death - was Mendel rightfully recognized as the founder of genetics.\"\n\n- Daniel L. Hartl and Vitezslav Orel, from their article \"What did Gregor Mendel think he discovered?\", Genetics, Volume 131, Genetics Society of America (1992).\n\n“The moral of this story is that modesty is not always a virtue. Maxwell and Mendel were both excessively modest. [Gregor] Mendel’s modesty setback the progress of biology by fifty years. [James Clerk] Maxwell’s modesty setback the progress of physics by twenty years. It is better for the progress of science if people who make great discoveries are not too modest to blow their own trumpeots.

This was certainly true when Albert Einstein‘s 1905 paper on “special relativity” first challenged the British conception of ether. ... In France, Einstein was largely ignored until he visited in 1910. In the U.S., a few understood it, but, in general, relativity was ridiculed as “totally impractical and absurd.” In Britain, his theories met with resistance, because relativity was seen as a direct challenge to the widely accepted theory of ether. ...

But for a long time it was not difficult to find professional research mathematicians who stoutly maintained that fractals and chaos were completely useless and that all of the interest in them was pure hype. This attitude persisted into the current century, when fractals had been around for at least twenty-five years and chaos for forty.

But really all lines that are continuous and of a uniform nature are just as simple as one another. Another kind of mind which might form an equally clear mental perception of some property of any one of these curves, as we do of the congruence of a straight line, might believe these curves to be the simplest of all, and from that property of these curves build up the elements of a very different geometry, referring all other curves to that one, just as we compare them to a straight line. Indeed, these minds, if they noticed and formed an extremely clear perception of some property of, say, the parabola, would not seek, as our geometers do, to rectify the parabola, they would endeavor, if one may coin the expression, to parabolify the straight line.' \" (Roger Joseph Boscovich was a scientist/mathematician of remarkable imagination whose insightful and visionary achievements have yet to be fully recognized.)\n\n- Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, and Robert Katz, from their book The First Systems of Weighted Differential and Integral Calculus (1980) [9].

But they don't have the creativity to ask new questions. So in mathematics there has been historically this more or less sharp distinction between those who are best known for asking questions and those who are best known for proving theorems that others have conjectured. The greatest mathematician in my private pantheon has been Henri Poincaré. Altogether a very great man, he started many branches of mathematics from scratch, but he acknowledged himself that he didn't prove any difficult theorem and cared about proofs less than about concepts.\" - Benoit Mandelbrot, from the interview \"A Radical Mind\" with Benoit Mandelbrot, conducted by Bill Jersey on 24 April 2005, posted at PBS's NOVA Online on 01 October 2008, and broadcast on PBS's NOVA television-program Hunting the Hidden Dimension on 24 August 2011.\n\n\" I would say that mathematics is the science of skillful operations with concepts and rules invented just for this purpose. The principal emphasis is on the invention of concepts. ... The principle point is that ... mathematicians could formulate only a handful of interesting theorems without defining concepts beyond those contained in the axioms and that the concepts beyond those contained in the axioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious logical operations which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and also in their results of great generality and simplicity.\"\n\n- Eugene Wigner, from his article \"The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences,\" in the journal Communications in Pure and Applied Mathematics, Volume 13, Number 1 (February 1960).\n\n“Every discovery I made while at IBM fell well outside the scope of any university department. ...
