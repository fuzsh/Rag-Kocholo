This Cyclo-Harmonograph was invented ca.1916 by Robert E. Moritz, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington. He called it "an instrument for drawing large classes of important higher plane curves in mathematics." In essence, it's a drawing machine that creates complex geometric shapes, also known as harmonic curves.
