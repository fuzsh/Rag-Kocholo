Mary Beth Dickson hosts the It I 1 ih HBO Series Spoofing By JAMES BROWN HOLLYWOOD In the wake of Tuesday's sudden disclosure that Frank Mankiewicz will step down as chief operating officer of the financially troubled National Public Radio Network, several questions remained unanswered as the 12th annual Public Radio Conference concluded in Minneapolis. The most pressing: How did NPR get in such a predicament? Can it survive without a long-term loss in credibility and program services? And who will step into Mankiewicz's shoes and lead the network through these troubled times? Mankiewicz, who has guided NPR for five years as president and chief operating officer, agreed to step aside when it was learned the network's deficit had grown to $5.8 million halfway into the current fiscal year about $3 million more than originally anticipated. Last month, NPR's board of directors ordered a 10 percent cutback of NPR's 435-person staff and the cancellation of two series, \"The Sunday Show\" and \"Jazz Alive,\" to offset what it thought would be a $2.8 million shortfall. The miscalculation may lead to even further staff and programming cuts .\n\nHowever, according to Wallace Smith, general manager of KUSC-FM in Los Angeles and a member of the NPR board, no specific decisions have been made. there's no way we can resolve the problems at NPR without making further cuts in expenditures,\" Smith said, \"and that will likely mean some people and additional programs though the details have not yet been worked out. I don't think there are any options we can fail to consider, though we'll try in every way to preserve the diversity of programming services, with particular priorities for 'All Things Considered' and 'Morning Those two series are the centerpiece of NPR programming and any attempt to dilute their resources would be made grudgingly. In fact, the NPR membership approved a resolution asking the board to make programming the last resort for achieving savings, particularly stressing their desire that \"All Things Considered\" and \"Morning Edition\" be kept intact. 'The thing is,\" Smith said, \"those two shows were already affected in the first round of cuts, so how much more can we take away? 'All Things Considered' and 'Morning Edition' win't be covering as many special events as before and there's a restriction on extensive traveling as well .\n\nSo already, the special nature of the two has been affected.\" resigning, Mankiewicz shouldered the blame for NPR's miseries, saying he had \"vastly underestimated\" the amount of outside support available to NPR. Mankiewicz, former press secre- indeed, have restrictions placed on its eventual use, which meant NPR could not spend it as planned. Outside businesses namely, a joint venture with the National Information Utility, which would lease NPR satellites, and a proposal to use subcarriers from main FM broadcast channels for commercial purposes took off much more slowly than anticipated. \"There were delays in getting approval for these ventures from the FCC,\" Mankiewicz said, \"which delayed the time when it might have begun to make money.\" KUSC's Smith, however, believes it was unrealistic to think that these new businesses would start showing a significant profit right away. \"We got too ambitious too soon,\" he said .\n\n\"But in defense of the new businesses, we were trying to go ahead with no capital, trying to interest venture capitalists tonelp pay the costs of starting things up. when approval was delayed at the FCC, we weren't able to provide our partners with the assets we had to contribute. We were simply expecting too much. And while I confident that some of the businesses will eventually work out, we shouldn't expect any reasonable profits for three to five years.\" What are other ways that NPR might ease the financial bind? \"Once we stabilize the current situation and realize we have to live in a more conservative manner, then we can encourage private industry for more support,\" Smith said. ''There are possibilities of generating income from additional grants, loans and maybe a national on-the-air fund-raiser .\n\nThe very last resort would be to assess the NPR affiliates a fee to help pay our operating costs. It isn't that the stations are unwilling, but many would simply be unable to come up with the money.\" Smith said that NPR'S new chief operating officer must be \"someone with strong management skills, enpowered to make decisions that will return NPR to solvency.\" Fre- Suently mentioned for the job is Bornstein, a University of Wisconsin administrator who served as vice president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1980-81. Smith had no comment on the Bornstein rumor, other than to say that an appointment would be made \"within a week or two at the most.\" Meanwhile, the Frank Mankiewicz era at NPR is reaching a somewhat inglorious end, which is unfortunate because Mankiewicz is responsible for much that is good about NPR solidifying the journalistic stature of \"All Things Considered\" and \"Morning Edition,\" serving as a tireless spokesman for the network and its ideals and through his own stature and enthusiasm achieving an identity for NPR that it never had in its early years. Now, though, that identity is of a network in trouble and Man The News In this month's show, for example, former EPA chief Anne Burford talks about toxic-waste cleanup as her hair and face turn purple and green. Former Transportation secretary JDrew Lewis (now head of a major cable company hmm) sits in an office, announcing a bus schedule .\n\n1 And two bored women (cast members, actually) try to sneak out of a Nancy Reagan luncheon, although Mrs. Reagan is heard insisting that everyone keep their seats. Not all of the \"Not Necessarily\" ideas work some are just plain cheap andor dumb but no gag sticks around for long. The show has a high turnover rate, and that's intentional. \"The show moves so if you don't like one of the sketches, in 35 seconds there's another one,\" says Iris Dugow, HBO's vice president of original programming-West Coast (a job title so long it must require an oversized memo pad) .\n\nThe cast that races through each half-hour is a good one: Danny Breen, a former star in Chicago's Second City troupe; Anne Bloom, who has a flighty, Goldie Hawnish quality; Rich Hall, loose and limber, formerly seen on Mitchell Laurance, who is excellent! at exasperation; Stuart is good at the physical bits, including twisting (again, like we did last summer); and Audrie Neenan, who specializes in dudgeon, both high and low. Knight-News-Tribuna Service exercising anchorpeople deliver the news to a disco beat. And a commercial for the movie \"Gandhi Loves Tootsie\" \"You'll laugh, you'll cry, but mostly you'll laugh.\" Not since \"Patton Loves Fran-, ces\" has there been such a picture, says the announcer. There's a promotional spot for a television special called \"Those Healing Bloopers\" featuring TV evangelists who weren't having particularly good days. And a promotional spot for the major, major mini-series \"The Windy War\" \"on all three networks at the same time, every night for six hours, until the year 2000.\" Produced and directed by John Moffitt (he also produced the gone and not-much-missed \"Fridays\" for ABC), and based on a British comedy series called \"Not the Nine O'Clock News,\" \"Not Necessarily the News\" became a monthly program in January .\n\nAll four shows from this year are running throughout the month on HBO.

Kennedy and campaign manager for George Mc-Govern's 1972 presidential bid, survived two votes of no-confidence by the NPR board before announcing his decision to step down in favor of a new chief operating officer. Mankiewicz, however, says he will remain as NPR's president during this fiscal crisis, concentrating on fund-raising efforts and serving as a liaison to Congress, the FCC and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The genesis of the financial miscalculations begins with these figures: In 1983, as federal appropriations were reduced from $14.9 million to $11.7 million, NPR's operating budget rose from $21 million to $26 million. Mankiewicz, who has lobbied hard to reduce the network's dependence on federal funds, had hoped to balance the books through corporate underwriting, grants and outside business ventures .\n\n\"We were overly optimistic,\" Mankiewicz said. \"I guess I didn't think the recession would cut as hard or as deep or as long as it has. The amount of outside support available was less than we thought and we didn't track the income well enough.\" For specifics, Mankiewicz said that NPR figured to receive $500,000 in fiscal '83 as interest on cash on hand. But the tight financial climate required that NPR spend the cash thus, no interest. Mankiewicz said this year's operating budget was not properly drawn up, leaving out some distribution costs, for example .\n\nSome grant money that had come in budgeted as \"unrestricted\" did, 4-WORLD OF SPORTS Conclusion of the Gnat American Bike Race. 6, 1 1 GOLF (Cont.) 9 CHAMPIONSHIP WRES- TUNG 13-AUCTION (Cont.) 22 ALL-STAR WRESTLING 40-ROGER McDUFF 53-KUNG FU 5:30 P.
