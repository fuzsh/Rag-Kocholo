        "text": "Advertisements\n\nThe Tony Mowad program on WDUQ in the evenings is very enjoyable. Fortunately they have internet streaming: WDUQ 90.5 FM - Listen to Audio from WDUQ, Pittsburgh (http://www.wduq.org/audio/index.html - broken link) . I do like the Bob Studebaker show and that other girl in the daytime as well.\n\nGetting a little off topic, does anyone listen to WEDO 810 AM? That station is so Pixburgh - Radio Italia, Frania's Polka Party, Jerry Jumba and Jack Taddy, McKeesport Slovak Hour, Croation show, Slovenian Show, Echoes of Erin, Father Scott...you get the idea.\n\nQuote:\n\nEDIT: I just checked the main NPR website and they have YEP listed as one of their stations.\n\nDUQ is more of an NPR affiliate than YEP is. I listen to DUQ for Morning Edition on my way to work and All Things Considered on my way home. YEP broacasts the hourly NPR news updates, but none of the programs like Fresh Air or Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by fleetiebelle\n\nYEP broacasts the hourly NPR news updates, but none of the programs like Fresh Air or Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.\n\nThanks GOD!--- I can handle All Things Considered, but that one shrew's voice on the 9 or 10am show (here in NYC) makes me wanna' throw a bottle of scotch down my own gullet!!!!! She sounds like a 90-year old who is so hopelessly out of touch with reality, but who the syndicators are too afraid to can, because she's been around since before radio even existed!!... I'm sure you know to whom I refer; I just can't think of her name....\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by supersoulty\n\nWow... I had never heard of that before now. I am def gonna check it out now.\n\nI see they have a website again. Looks like Saturday and Sunday afternoons are the best times for ethnic shows:\n\n810 Inc. WEDO 810AM | Home | \"YOUR STATION OF NATIONS\" (http://www.wedo810.com/WEDOProgramGuide.html - broken link)\n\nAlthough I used to listen to that Slovak Hour on weekdays on my way home from work. And I'm not even a Hunky!"
