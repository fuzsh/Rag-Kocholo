Direct responsibility under the president shall reside in the appropriate dean or vice president, a faculty or staff advisor and/or editor, and a student editor-in-chief (if applicable).

The role of the faculty/staff advisor and/or editor of student publications shall be to assist the student staff in the transfer of the theories of publication/broadcast to successful, effective practice. Details of the advisor’s and/or editor’s functions may be delineated by further policies set by the individual publication in a manner consistent with provisions of this policy statement.\n\nSubmissions to Student Media\n\nEach publication will develop individual policies on advertisements, submissions, deadlines, authorship, editing of submissions, and any other relevant criteria related to publishable material.

The student editor (if applicable) shall make decisions concerning content and publication/broadcast practices in consultation with the faculty/staff advisor and/or editor. Where disagreement between the publication’s advisor and/or editor and student editor occurs on particular content, conflicts of opinion will be resolved through the administrative structure of the academic or administrative unit housing the publication.\n\nFreedom of the Press\n\nThe statement of student rights published in The Hornet affirms and guarantees freedom of the press. Therefore, the prevailing legal principles of freedom of the press shall be respected with regard to all student media at the University of Lynchburg. Accordingly, this policy shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the prevailing judicial interpretations of the meaning and substance of laws pertaining to the freedom of the press.\n\nDisclaimer Statement for Reproduction in Each University Publication\n\nPublications subject to this policy will print a disclaimer in the appropriate place that states that the opinions expressed in the publication are not necessarily those of the University of Lynchburg.
