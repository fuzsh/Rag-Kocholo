        "text": "Early years: as WPHB-FM\n\nThis station was originally known as WPHB-FM, first signing on the air in 1989 from the studios of its co-owned AM station with the same call letters. Both stations simulcast a classic country music format for approximately half of the broadcast day, with break-aways during the daytime hours for WPHB (AM)'s more Christian-based programming.\n\nIn 1996, the Sharpless family sold both stations to local residents Cliff and Laura Mack, who changed the format of the FM station to modern rock. The station also adopted the new call letters WUBZ-FM and the \"105.9 The Buzz\" moniker. In 1999, they moved their tower to provide a city-grade signal in State College. WPHB and WUBZ were then sold a few years later to Magnum Broadcasting, which moved WUBZ's studios to State College. WPHB, which was more of a local station serving Philipsburg and the Moshannon Valley almost exclusively, stayed in Philipsburg, where it remains today.\n\nIn 2006, WUBZ-FM changed their call letters to WJOW and switched to a country format branded as \"Joe FM\". Magnum Broadcasting's previously titled \"106.9 The Surge\", which broadcast to Renovo and Lock Haven, changed in February 2007 to simulcast \"Joe FM\" as well. Another change is that \"Joe FM\" started to mix in more Southern and classic rock hits with the country music to differentiate themselves from their main competitor in the State College area, Froggy 101. \"Rock N' Country\" was their motto.\n\nOn September 3, 2009, WJOW changed their format to active rock, branded as \"QWiK Rock 105.9\" under the WQCK call letters. The line-up featured Todd and Troy Craig in the Morning (Troy was the former PD form the defunct 103.1 QWK Rock), 6am - 10am, Drew Shannon 10am - 3pm, AJ 3pm - 7pm, Andy Robb 7pm - Midnight and Glennie B 12am - 6am\n\nHistory of QWiK Rock\n\nAfter leaving the marketplace when being shut down at 103.1 FM by Forever Broadcasting, the active rock format, branded as \"Qwik Rock\", returned to the airwaves on September 3, 2009 at 5 p.m. on a frequency owned by Magnum Broadcasting Inc. The station seeks to recreate the sound of the original WQWK from years gone by and it even features some of the names and voices from QWK 103.1.\n\n\"Quick Radio\" began circa 1969 as an underground/progressive rock station. The first sign that their format was about to change may have been toward the end of 1970, when they held a call-in contest entitled \"Quick Radio Sells Out!\"\n\nIn 1989, WQWK (then broadcasting on 96.7 FM with a Top 40/CHR format) had a frequency switch to 97.1 FM. Shortly thereafter, the station format flipped to classic rock and the slogan changed to become \"Lion Country's Home of Rock n' Roll\". Today, classic rock is available with WBUS.\n\nIn 1993, then-WQWK owner TMZ Broadcasting acquired WIYQ (now WRKW) in Ebensburg from the Allegheny Mountain Network. TMZ dropped WIYQ's satellite-delivered oldies format to simulcast WQWK's programming over WIYQ, which took the call letters WQKK and the \"Quick Rock\" moniker.\n\nIn 2004, WQWK moved to 98.7 FM.\n\nIn 2006, WQWK moved to 103.1 FM, which was previously held by WBHV.\n\nWhen Forever Broadcasting took the station off-air in favor of talk radio the WQWK call letters were moved to Forever's ESPN 1450, most likely just in case they ever decided to resurrect the station at a later date, but Magnum decided they could relaunch the station without its heritage calls and so one month to the day after the station went silent, it was reborn in a new spot on the dial.\n\nEffective August 31, 2020, Magnum Broadcasting sold WQCK, two sister stations, and a translator to Jeffry and Mark Schlesinger's Schlesinger Communications, Inc. for $1.05 million.\n\nIn September 2022, WQCK-FM1 was surrendered by the FCC."
