        "text": "WKCT-TV, virtual channel 5, is the Central Television Network STLMK-affiliated station serving Wakeport, Mushroom Kingdom. The station is owned by the Hearst Communications subsidiary Hearst Television.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe station first signed on in May 8, 1947, as the first station in the Wakeport TV market and one of the first in the Mushroom Kingdom (WKCT signed on 2 years; 4 months and 2 days prior to CBS affiliate WKPA-TV's launch, 4 years prior to ABC O&O WGT-TV in Toad Harbor, signed on, and almost a decade before NBC affiliate WRBE). It was originally a Dumont affiliate owned by the now-defunct Bamberger Broadcasting Service (the broadcasting division of Macy's). When Dumont went off the air in 1956, it was sold to RKO Radio Pictures' then-broadcasting division RKO General, and thus became independent for the next 29 years, when the St. Lawrence and Mushroom Kingdom broadcasting division of the Montreal-based Central Television Network bought the station (in October 1985). Prior to that (2 months before), the station aired Central programming such as The Centralist, the award-winning drama series The Man from Vancouver). It ended its status as an O&O, in 1998, when Central gave WKCT to New York City-based Hearst Communications subsidiary Hearst Television (then called Hearst-Argyle). It adopted KTLA's \"5\" logo in 1999 (However, it first used WTTG's version of the logo).\n\nDigital Television[]\n\nDigital Channel[]\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nChannel Video Aspect Ratio PSIP Short Name Programming 5.1 1080p/720p 16:9 WKCT-DT Main WKCT programming/Central STLMK 5.2 NWLD NewsWorld 5.3 FDC Free Documentary Channel 5.4 480i 4:3 H&I Heroes & Icons\n\nGallery[]"
