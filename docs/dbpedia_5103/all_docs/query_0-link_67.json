This is possibly the first attempt to put together a book concerning Country, Western, and Gospel music, beginning with the Vernon Dalharts, Carson Robisons, Bradly Kincaids, and Jimmie Rodgers' of the 1920s; the Gene Autrys, Red Foleys, Roy Acuffs, Elton Britts, Lulu Belles and Scottys, Blackwood Brothers', Jimmy Wakelys, Carter Families, Sons of the Pioneers Sizemores, Delmore Brothers', Bob Wills', Jimmy Davis', Hoosier Hot Shots', Roy Rogers', Patsy 1\n\n,\n\nMontanas, PeeWee Kings, Clayton McMichens, Bill Monroes, and Riley Pucketts of the 1930s; the Rex Aliens, Eddy Arnolds, Rod Brasfields, Ernest Tubbs, Minnie Pearls, and Ernie Fords of the 1940s; and, the Elvis Presleys, Johnny Cashs, Jim Reeves', Everly Brothers', Ferlin Huskeys, Kingston Trios, Webb Pierces, Marty Robbins', Flatts' and Scruggs', Carl Smiths, Hank Thompsons, Kitty Wells', and the\n\nHank\n\nThere\n\nWilliams' of the 1950s and 1960s. is\n\nno attempt in the book\n\nto present a definition\n\nof Country music, because the writer feels that a thorough definition and understanding of Country, Western and Gos-\n\npel music may be obtained from the magazine articles. Each field of music is nationally popular today, and it has\n\nbeen estimated that from one-third to one-half of the records sold are those of Country, Western, and Gospel music.\n\nam\n\nespecially indebted to the entertainers of Country, Western, and Gospel music for giving me information conI\n\ncerning their lives. Also, I want to thank the following for helping to make this book possible: N. Nudie, HollyRadio, Bluefield, wood, California; Gordon Jennings, West Virginia; Mrs. Jo Walker, Country Music Association,\n\nWKOY\n\nNashville, Tennessee;\n\nMax\n\nHarrison, Baptist Brotherhood,\n\nMemphis, Tennessee; James G. \"Goober\" Buchanan, Nashville, Tennessee; writers and publishers of the enclosed magazine\n\narticles; the\n\nfollowing libraries: George Peabody\n\nCollege for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee; Martin College, Pulaski, Tennessee; Vanderbilt University, Nashville; City Library, Nashville; State Library, Nashville, Tennessee;\n\nand, Giles County Library, Pulaski, Tennessee; Frank Page, Radio, Shreveport, Louisiana; Jack Bowman and the Ernest Tubb Record Shop, Nashville; Henry Farrell\n\nKWKH\n\nand the Hank Snow Music Center, Nashville; Cal Young,\n\nWENO\n\nRadio, Madison, Tennessee; and, lastly, those I may have forgotten but upon whose kind assistance I was de-\n\npendent. I once had a teacher\n\nwho said, \"Always work hard at any but at some time in your life attempt what job you attempt, if at all you want, possible.\" This inspiration, and inspiration from others such as Cal Young, provided the encouragement\n\nfor the actual beginning of this study, a project I had planned for the past five years. If I have helped in any way\n\nby presenting needed information and for the promotion of Country, Western, and Gospel music, I shall consider the book worthwhile. E. Linnell\n\nGentry\n\n1719 Linden\n\nNashville\n\n12,\n\nAvenue Tennessee\n\nPART n Magazine Articles on Country, Western and Gospel Music Since 1904\n\nSOME REAL AMERICAN MUSIC by\n\nEmma\n\nBell Miles\n\ngenerally believed that America has no folk-music, nothing distinctively native out of which a national school It is\n\nof\n\nadvanced composition\n\nmay\n\narise.\n\nThe commercial\n\nspirit\n\nof the age, and our conventional mode of existence, have so far effaced original types of character and romantic phases of life that the folk-song seems already a thing of the past.\n\nDvorak and a few other composers have indeed made use of negro themes, and the aboriginal Indian music has been seriously treated more than once. But these composihowever excellent, are no expression of American and character; they fall as strangely on our ears as\n\ntions, life\n\nany foreign product. But there is hidden among the mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Carolinas a people of whose inner nature and its musical expression almost nothing has been said. The music of the Southern mountaineer is not only peculiar, but, like himself, peculiarly American. Nearly\n\nall\n\nmountaineers are singers.\n\nTheir untrained\n\nvoices are of good timbre, the women's being sweet high and tremulous, and their sense of pitch and tone\n\nharmony remarkably\n\ntrue.\n\nwell treated and beloved of feudal days.\n\nis\n\nand and\n\nThe\n\nfiddler or the banjo-player among them, like the minstrel\n\nThe mountain fiddler rarely cuddles his instrument under his chin; he sets it against the middle of his chest, and grasping his bow near the middle, wields it with a juggling\n\nmovement\n\nquite unlike the long sweep of the ac-\n\n\"Reprinted by permission from Harper's Magazine, Vol. 109, No. June, Copyright 1904.\"\n\nDCXLIX,\n\ncomplished violinist's bow-arm. It is sometimes complained that their playing is too rapid and jerky; but the tunes are composed for this tempo, and no other would be found suitable.\n\nProminent among the elements of this music is that leading American characteristic, humor; not the sparkling wit of the French, nor the broad, clumsy jollification of the Teuton; not sarcasm nor irony, but the keen, wholesome, freakish American love of a laugh pervades directly or indirectly almost every line. The music, too, while usually minor, is not of a plaintive tendency; there are few laments, no sobbing and wailing. In this it differs radically from that of Neither has it any marital throb or clang. meditative, with a vein of genial and sunny philosophy; the tunes chuckle, not merrily, but in any amused contemplation. The mountaineer is fond of turning the joke on himself. savage peoples. It is reflective,\n\nHe makes fun\n\nof his own poverty, his own shiftlessness, his ignorance, his hard luck, and his crimes: I'll tune up my fiddle and rosin my bow And make myself welcome wherever I go. Ill eat when I'm hungry and drink when\n\nIf\n\na tree don't fall on me,\n\nI'll\n\nlive\n\ntill I\n\nI'm dry;\n\ndie.\n\nwent upon a mountain and give my horn a blow; Ev'ry gal in the valley come running to the do'.\n\nI\n\nAs I went to my old field, I heard a mighty maulin'; The seed-ticks was a-splittin' rails; the chiggers was a-haulin.'\n\nOnce touched by religious emotions, however, the mountaineer seems to lose his sense of the ridiculous entirely the deeps of his nature are reached at last. The metaphors of Scripture, the natural expression of the Oriental mind, are taken with a literalness and seriousness against which\n\none cannot help thinking a touch of humor might be a saving grace. Hit's the old Hit's the old\n\nShip of Zion, as she comes, Ship of Zion, as she comes,\n\nHit's the old Ship of Zion, the old Ship of Zion, Hit's the old Ship of Zion, as she comes.\n\nShe'll\n\nbe loaded with bright angels\n\nOh, brothers, what will you do\n\nWe\n\nwill flee to the rocks\n\nwhen\n\nwhen\n\nshe comes,\n\nshe comes?\n\nand the mountains,\n\netc.\n\netc.\n\netc.\n\nRepetition carried to a point of wearisomeness form of revival hymns:\n\nis\n\na fa-\n\nvorite\n\nSome have Some have Some have\n\nOn\n\nup in up in fathers up in fathers\n\nglory,\n\nfathers\n\nglory,\n\nglory,\n\nthe other shore.\n\nSome bright day we'll go and Some bright day we'll go and Some bright day we'll go and On the other bright shore.

Having no theatre, no no arena, no sensational feature of any kind in\n\nIt is their\n\nbull-fight,\n\ntheir lives, they must, being a high-strung race, find vent\n\nsome other way. They rock to and fro softly, crooning and moaning, until the impulse comes upon them to leap into the air and scream and shout until exhausted. It is common for women, and even men, to injure themselves unawares; or, at baptizings, to pitch headlong into the water. I have seen convulsions and even temporary insanity brought on by these It is the music that produces this feeling; but these songs cannot be fairly judged sung out of their natural setting of brushwood camp or half-lighted log church, and reenforced by the vibrant, frenzied voices of exhorters and the high strained singsong of the preacher who has\n\nexcesses.\n\nreached what is known as his \"weavin' way.\" I confess that the wild fascination of a mountain revival has a strange power over me; the scene and the music draw me with a charm that I do not understand.\n\nSuch a religion has naturally little to do with moral law. far from wishing to imply that they regard no principles of right and wrong, or that their own code of morals is not rigidly adhered to by the majority. The popular idea I\n\nam\n\nin this connection\n\nis, I\n\nam\n\nwell aware, one of lawlessness.\n\nBut the world at large knows little of the mountain people except as some bloody feud or fight over a raided still finds its\n\nway\n\ninto court.\n\nThis\n\nis\n\nas\n\nif\n\none judged society by the\n\ndivorce columns and reports of frauds and embezzlement. It should be remembered that the greater number of the 6\n\nmountaineers never get into the newspapers. Who is there to speak of their hospitality, their independence, their fidelity to marriage bonds? They are really of superior moral fibre for so primitive a race. But, like most primitive peoples, they are prone to hold brute courage the first of the virtues, and the hero of their ballad is too often the criminal. The bold robber stands to their minds as the buccaneers and marooners of the Spanish Main stood to seventeenth-century England. He is the Man Who Dared that is all and if justice overtakes him, their sympathies, of course, follow him all the more.\n\nLast night as I\n\ndreamt\n\nI\n\nI dreamt a pleasant dream; Moscow, 'way down by Pearly\n\nlay sleeping,\n\nwas down\n\nI\n\nin\n\nstream;\n\nThe prettiest girl beside me, had come to go my bail; I woke up, broken-hearted, in Knoxville County jail.

They are next of kin to the old May-pole dance real playing at love games in pects, instead of wooing.\n\nwhich much choosing\n\nof partners takes place, and many kisses are taken openly, in wholesome lightness of heart as part of the game. These are such games as the children of\n\nmore\n\ncivilized societies play; but the mountain children rarely organize their frolics into games; their sport is\n\nscarcely\n\nmore elaborate than the romping\n\nture, or the imitative\n\ngrown\n\nlads\n\nand\n\ngirls\n\npranks of monkeys.\n\nwho\n\nelors are not in the least\n\nof colts in a pasThey are half-\n\nsing these songs, and\n\nashamed\n\nof joining in\n\nhearted abandon.

It is not improbable that the \"Charley\" of these songs is the Prince Charlie of Jacobite ballads. \"Over the River, Charley,\" may or may not be an echo of \"Over the Waters to Charlie,\" for a large proportion of the mountain people are descended from Scotch Highlanders who left their homes on account of the persecutions which harassed them\n\nduring Prince Charlie's time, and began wilderness of the Alleghenies.\n\nlife\n\nanew\n\nin the\n\nThe mountaineers sing many ballads of old England and Their taste in music has no doubt been guided by these, which have come down from their ancestors.

Here is one exactly as it was sung to me by two young girls in the sitions, especially as\n\nof localities, changed to\n\nmountains:\n\nThe Ladie Bright\n\nwas a ladie bright; Each child she had was three; She sent them off to a Northern State\n\nIt\n\nFor to learn their gramarie.\n\nThey had been gone but a\n\nlittle\n\ntime\n\nTwo\n\nmonths, perhaps, or three Till sickness spread all over the land And swept her babes away. if there was a King in Heaven chose to wear a crown,\n\nShe prayed\n\nWho\n\nThat He would send them home that night Or in the morning soon. 10\n\nTwas\n\ntwelve long months, about Christmastide,\n\nThe night being cold and long, The three little ones came running home,\n\nAnd She\n\ninto their mother's arms.\n\nset a table before\n\nOn\n\nthem\n\nsoon,\n\nspread bread and wine, \"Now, come along my little babes, Come, eat and drink of mine.\" \"I may not eat of your bread, my mother, Nor drink none of your wine.\" it\n\nShe fixed a bed in the back room\n\nside,\n\nOn it spread a clean sheet, And over the top spread a golden\n\nskirt\n\nFor to make a sweeter\n\nsleep.\n\n\"Awake, awake,\" said the oldest one,\n\nNow I\n\nAnd Some\n\nsoon the cock will crow.\n\nsee our Saviour smiling down, to\n\nHim we must\n\ngo.\"\n\nmusic is of a descriptive the incidents of every-day life. nature, reflecting vividly Peculiar fingerings of the strings, close harmonies, curious snaps and slides and twangs, and the accurate observations of an ear attuned to all the sounds of nature, enter largely into the composition of these. In the \"Cackling Hen\" the of the best instrumental\n\ncackle, hard, high, and cheerfully prosaic, is well rendered, as may be easily seen.\n\nremarkably\n\n\"Big Jim\" is a dance tune in which the major melody drops suddenly into a running repetition of two or three\n\nminor\n\nnotes, beautifully like the\n\ndrumming\n\nof rain\n\non a\n\ncabin roof. In the \"Fox-Chase,\" the baying of the hounds, from the eager start of the pack as they take up the trail to the last lingering yelp, after the quarry is treed, is given by the\n\nbanjo accompaniment. The spoken \"patter\" runs along irrespective of rhythm, interpolated irregularly with the hunting-cry. It is almost impossible to reduce the effect to musical notation; the emphasis is all on the hound's deep note; the thumb-string, while almost imperceptible to the ear, still plays\n\nan important part in producing the rhythm. 11\n\nbegins with a regular movement, which grows more and more rapid and exciting as it progresses; then, as the fox is treed, the close comes, suddenly, with the baying of \"Old It\n\nSounder.\" Boys, blow up the dogs and let's have a fox-chase.

We are told of the impression which his singing first made on Mr. Moody, of his improvising the tune for \"The Ninety and Nine,\" of the huge crowds, sometimes 20,000 people, who came to the Moody and Sankey revival meetings, and of the enormous sales of the \"Gospel Hymns.\" The number of copies printed is reported to be 50,000,000; and even if this figure be somewhat exaggerated, the great popularity of these hymns is one of the facts with which historians of American culture must reckon. Publishers complain that there is little or no demand for good poetry; but year in and year out the Moody\n\nand Sankey hymns keep the presses busy. Such revival services as first gave them vogue we are not likely to see again, at least in the East. The efficacy of this method of appeal is now gravely distrusted even in denominations like the Methodist and Baptist which once relied on it. Mr. Moody himself, in his later years, is said to have doubted whether the effect of revivals was permanent. He found that, after the excitement had died out, the tears and groans from \"conviction of sin\" and the ecstacies of conversion left many men about where they were before, only a little more indifferent and callous. A community \"burnt over\" by a wild revival often proved a difficult field to cultivate by sober and steady means. Mr. thus became and more interest more Moody's engaged in the the the character of slow, calm, and young by forming laborious process of education.\n\nwere, he thought,\n\nThe\n\nresults of that\n\nwork\n\nlasting.\n\nWith the passing of the old-fashioned revival, which from Whitefield to Moody has thrown whole cities into agitation, the few hymns that are peculiarly fitted to provoke a religious frenzy may perhaps fall into disuse. But the bulk of the \"Gospel Hymns\" seem likely to hold their own \"Reprinted by permission from The Nation, Vol. 87, No. 2251, 20, Copyright 1908.\"\n\nAugust\n\n14\n\nplace, it must be said that the book contains many old favorites by hymn-writers of the eighteenth and nineteenth century such as Watt's \"There Is a indefinitely.\n\nIn the\n\nfirst\n\nLand of Pure Delight,\" Toplady's \"Rock of Ages,\" John Mason Neale's \"Ah, My Heart/' and Keble's \"Sun of My Soul.\"\n\nThese, however, which are found in\n\nmany\n\nother col-\n\n\"Gospel Hymns.\" The distinctive feature of Mr. Sankey's book is those lively, rattling pieces like \"Hold the Fort\" and \"Pull for the Shore\" and the crudely sentimental hymns of Fanny J. Crosby, P. P. Bliss, and their imitators. The music, from the point of view of a severe critic, is as contemptible as that of a music-hall ditty; but it has some of the same popular qualities. The air is simple, strongly marked, easy to sing, easy to remember, \"catching\" just the thing for children and\n\nlections, are not the characteristic\n\nin their musical taste are still children.

Many of the hymns are a mere wooden versification of the common-places one hears in the \"testimonies\" and exhortations at a Methodist prayer meet-\n\nfor adults\n\nwho\n\nthe words\n\nfit\n\ning. This, for\n\nexample, by Miss Crosby (Mrs. Van Alstyne)\n\n:\n\nNow\n\njust a word for Jesus, Your dearest friend so true, Come, cheer our hearts and tell us\n\nWhat He has done\n\nfor you.\n\nRefrain:\n\nNow\n\njust a word for Jesus 'Twill help us on our way;\n\nOne\n\nO\n\nword\n\nfor Jesus, speak, or sing, or pray.\n\nlittle\n\nLess badly hortatory, but worse in point of style, are by Mr. Bliss:\n\nthese lines\n\nhow happy\n\nOh,\n\nWho\n\nare\n\nwe\n\nin Jesus agree,\n\nAnd\n\nexpect His return from above; 'neath His vine and delightfully join In the praise of His excellent love.\n\nWe\n\nsit\n\nunited to Him partake of the stream\n\nWhen\n\nWe\n\n15\n\nEver flowing in peace from the throne, in Jesus believe, and the Spirit receive That proceeds from the Father and Son.\n\nWe\n\nBut the book is notable chiefly for its sentimentality with \"The Ninety and Nine,\" \"Where Is My Boy To-night?\" \"I Am So Glad That Jesus Loves Me,\" \"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning,\" \"Scatter Seeds of Kindness,\" and hundreds more in the same vein. The taste for this sort of psalmody seems to flourish as vigorously as ever, especially in the country. Millions of people derive enjoyment and edification from the kind of talk that is heard at a rural prayer-meeting. They are not disturbed by the unspirituality and crass materialism of the ideas there presented. They are not fastidious about either the form or substance of religious truth, and without a qualm they throw themselves into songs such as we have quoted. Human nature being what it is, and the liking for bathos being so widespread and ineradicable, the \"Gospel Hymns\" as a whole will probably remain popular and even increase in popularity for a long time to come. The people who sing them with such zest would not appreciate the delicacy and refinement, in thought and expression, of the few great hymns. For these honest folk the triviality of the music, the cheapness of style, the shallowness of conception, and the cloying sentimentally are exactly what lend charm to the \"Gospel Hymns.\" While the Ladies9 Home Journal continues the model of a successful periodical in America, the \"Gospel Hymns\" will go on selling by the millions.\n\nAnd\n\nyet\n\nwe would\n\nnot undervalue these\n\nhymns\n\nthe\n\nsolace they have brought in sorrow, the inspiration in moments of despondency, the strength in the hour of weakness. are, after all, not to be judged by the strict canons of musical and literary art.

He is a frequent and popular entertainer in various radio hours. Sure-Fire Formulas\n\nHe it was who wrote the ballad of Naomi Wise. And he has written hundreds of others for the recording of which he plays the accompaniment. In the case of the ill-fated Naomi he had an old tale to work with, but he can overnight convert any spot news event into a ballad. \"First I read all the newspaper stories of, say, a disaster,\" he explains. \"Then I get to work on the old typewriter.\n\nYou start by painting everything in gay colors 'the folks were all happy and gay* stuff. That's sure fire. Then you ring in the tragedy make it as There's a formula, of course.\n\nThen you wind up with\n\nmorbid and gruesome as you can. a moral.\"\n\nYou can get a clear idea of how the Robison formula works out by examining his popular ballad of The Miami Storm which was finished and out of his machine before communication was restored in the stricken area.\n\nHe opened with spot that\n\na description of the city by the sea\n\nwas bright and\n\nfair.\n\nA\n\nA garden of beauty A sweetness and light, followed by the tragic note:\n\nflowers.\n\nAnd\n\nthen in the darkness of midnight Their laughter was turned to tears; The wrath of the storm was upon them, That filled every heart with fears.\n\nThe wind was the voice That howled as\n\nit\n\nof a\n\ndemon\n\ncrashed through the town; anchors\n\nAnd great ships were torn from their And broken upon the ground.\n\nAnd\n\nthen\n\nThe\n\nwhen\n\ntoll of\n\nthe gray dawn came stealing the storm was known; 21\n\n\"a\n\ncity of palm trees and rare.\" second stanza of\n\nAnd\n\nsad were the cries of the injured; street with the dead were strewn.\n\nThe\n\nAnd now\n\nfor the moral:\n\nWe cannot explain this disaster, We know not what fate may befall; And we\n\nshould be ready each hour\n\nTo answer the Master's They're\n\ncall.\n\nall like that.\n\nYou may,\n\nhave seen only calamity in the But there was more to it than that.

But for such objections there ing\n\nis\n\na ready explanation.\n\n\"You mustn't make them too good,\" says Robison. \"The boys of Tin Pan Alley tried to crash this new market as soon as they realized that it was rich in possibilities, but they've failed so far because their stuff was too up-to-date and too neat and trim.\" a bit difficult to compare the popularity of these hilltunes with that of popular numbers such as Coquette billy or Baby's Awake Now. The \"popular\" songs sell up into the millions during their brief reign; these other songs are like sugar in the grocery store they sell steadily through the years.

It doesn't take long for such a seller as that multiplying this record by twenty-three, the sales of the other companies to run 'way ahead of \"popular\" numbers, with the exception, perhaps, of those outstanding hits of Broadway which romp up past the million mark in a few months.\n\nOf course there are some topical numbers which have only a brief life. There's a New Star in Heaven Tonight, which dealt with how did you guess it? the passing of Rudolph Valentino, sold splendidly for a few months and then dropped off to almost nothing. But that had to do with a personality a single individual. It lacked the universal appeal of a tragic love story, a railroad or steamship wreck or the career of a bandit.\n\nThey Know What They Want\n\nwhom we write and sing are finicky,\" \"They know the formula they like and they want no changes or improvements.

Emotional religion is bad form, is repulsive to them. Revivals of religion are to many of them mere emotional orgies. Hence, they condemn gospel songs expressing joy in Christ and love for\n\nhim\n\nas revivalistic\n\nand emotional.\n\nMany who deprecate the use of gospel hymns are idealwho have no clear vision of the primary purpose of the\n\nists\n\nhymn; to aid in the progress of the kingdom of God, in the conversion of sinners, and the edification of saints. To them it is an absolute entity, standing alone. But the hymn is not simply a poem, a piece of literature to be judged as you would any other poetry; it is something to be used to it must so vitalize and make actual the message it brings as to create religious feeling in the minds of those who listen or even sing inThis consideration begins in an entirely new differently. set of criteria based on the effects it is to produce in various classes of people. In a hymn to be used in an efficient way these practical criteria have the right of way. The idealis-\n\naccomplish definite ulterior purposes:\n\ntic criteria are not set aside of course but they more or less subordinated.

Of course, the deep feeling and the intense conviction of truth\n\nit\n\nthey expressed occasionally ignored their practical theories and produced literary masterpieces, as in Watts's \"When I survey the wondrous cross,\" Newton's \"How sweet the name of Jesus sounds,\" and Cowper's \"Sometimes a light surprises.\"\n\nHymn's Value Depends on Appeal The value on\n\nits\n\nof a\n\nhymn\n\nfor actual use, therefore, depends who are to sing and to be ina college church, for congregations of\n\nappeal to the people\n\nfluenced by it. For highly educated and cultivated people, the literary appeal may well be emphasized, if a deeply devotional effect is to 29\n\nbe produced. For congregations of average people, readers of popular magazines, newspapers and light fiction, the literary emphasis already needs to be subordinated. In rude, somewhat illiterate communities, rude hymns of little literary value, but with expressions of strong feeling, may be the \"best hymns\" to be used. That is to say, the \"best hymns\" are to be selected by laying stress on the effectiveness of the hymn in producing religious emotion and creating a definitely religious attitude in the particular congregation or community in which it is to be used. To get\n\nthe same inspiring and enlivening result in three typical congregations, the dignified \"Lead On, O King Eternal,\" the gospel hymn \"Encamped along the hills of light,\" and the old fashioned spiritual \"Palms of Victory\" might each be the \"best hymn\" and each the \"worst hymn\" among the other types of people. a very common saying in this connection that we must not insult God by bringing him anything but our best. That conceives the Divine Being as a literary connoisseur, It is\n\nor as a musical critic, who applies conventional academic criteria in accepting what his people bring him.

Yes, there have been and are some disgustingly poor gospel hymns put into cold print. As long as people have aspiration without inspiration, and others have deep religious feeling with no native or acquired ability to express it, we shall have shocking specimens of cheap doggerel masquerading as gospel hymns. But we have shockingly poor sermons in many of our churches, which is worse. They are not always to be heard in the countryside, either, for some of the purposeless and futile sermons the writer ever heard were from preachers in great churches who prided themselves on the literary essays they read. letical,\n\nOne of the crimes of the gospel hymns is that there are many of them. Yes, we could spare some of them! But the same flood of what we now call standard hymns subso\n\nmerged the churches during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Wesley's six thousand five hundred hymns, Watts's over six hundred, Newton's three hundred, Toplady's four hundred, and so on indefinitely,, made as swollen a record as our recent gospel hymns. If there were not so many gospel hymns, we should have missed \"I Need Thee Every Hour,\" \"Blessed Assurance,\" \"He Leadeth Me,\" \"Je-\n\nMe,\" and scores of others. But the gospel hymns are by no means\n\nsus, Savior, Pilot\n\nall bad.

Jonathan Edwards found the psalm versions unfitted for the great revival and introduced the livelier hymns of Isaac Watts. Finney in turn found Watts and the tunes used with his hymns too dull and Joshua Leavitt issued for him his \"Christian Lyre.\" Everybody knows how the gospel hymn was the inspiring element in the Moody and Sankey evangelistic movement in America and Great Britain.

Carlson\n\nSome of the ways in which the radio is influencing us could not possibly have been predicted by even the shrewdest of projects. One of them is the revival of interest in the American folk song. In the days when static and interference were nothing to fret about, only a few scholars and were interested in the songs which have sprung from the up very soil of our country. But now interest is\n\ncollectors\n\nrapidly spreading to people in general. The reason is the radio. Turn the dial this\n\nway\n\nor that,\n\nbefore long you are perfectly sure to hear some songs that are as wholly and originally American as cornbread. They are usually presented along with other songs, but it is safe to say that\n\nno program of oldtime tunes\n\nkle of genuine folk music. Hence generation is becoming familiar with\n\nwithout a sprinthat the younger \"Turkey in the Straw,\"\n\nit\n\nis\n\nis\n\n\"Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie,\" \"Go Get the Ax,\" and a hundred other songs which its grandparents and greatgrandparents loved but which have not been sung for a generation or two. When our radios bring in these old songs in such numbers, most of us begin to be curious about them. Who wrote them? How old are they? Why do they sound so different\n\nfrom popular or classical music and so on? The folk song is simple and easily enjoyed, but, like all other music, it is\n\nmore fully appreciated when one knows something about it. The space available here forbids any attempt to discuss American folk song as a whole. Some sort of limitation is necessary. My reason for concentrating upon the cowboy ballad rather than on some other type is purely selfish, I suppose. It is only natural that people should be most interested in the songs of their own region. One who has\n\ngrown up hearing Southern Negroes sing at their work and play is more interested in that type of folk music than any \"Reprinted from Better Homes and Gardens, Vol. 10, No. 3, November, Copyright 1931, Meredith Publishing Company, Des Moines, Iowa,\n\nall\n\nrights reserved.\"\n\n33\n\nWe who live on the mighty stretch of plain rising from the Mississippi to the foot of the Rockies are likely to pick up our ears and listen most intently when the radio brings us the cowboy and frontier ballads. But first just an introductory word about the folk song itself. It is composed not by a definite author who sits other.\n\ndown at his piano to work out the tune or at his desk to polish off his rhymes, but \"by the people.\" This is what distinguishes it from what is called \"popular\" music, which composed for the people instead of by them. And since the composer of \"popular\" music has a rather low estimate of what people like, it is likely to be superficial in character and hence very short lived.\n\nis\n\nThe folk song, on the other hand, springs up rather spontaneously from among the people themselves. Someone who knows nothing about harmony and counterpoint but has a singing voice makes up a little song and sings it. Someone else likes it but thinks he can improve upon it. Still\n\nothers add to it or subtract from it to please themand their listeners. Pretty soon it has gone the\n\nselves\n\nrounds and has come to have a form that\n\nis\n\nappealing to\n\neveryone.\n\nThe true\n\nfolk song is not usually put on paper for a long not until some trained musician happens to hear it time, and write it down.\n\nNot until recently did anyone even begin to understand what a wealth of song has been produced in the various sections of the country. The Negro \"spirituals,\" the Kentucky-mountaineer ballads which are close kin to the ballads of old England, the lumber-jack songs of the great Northwest, the border songs of the Southwest, the cowboy\n\nand \"nester\" songs\n\nof the\n\nwide rolling plains\n\nall\n\nmay\n\nbe\n\nclassed as folk songs. of songs of and by the cow-punchers, who for a time lent their picturesque color to the West, is one\n\nThe growth\n\nof the interesting chapters in the history of American social well as American music. The cowboys were shut off\n\nlife as\n\nfrom the rest of the world as few other modern workers have been. In the close-knit little community that they formed they shared food, experiences, and thoughts. What34\n\never entertainment they had they must\n\nmake\n\nfor\n\nthem-\n\nselves.\n\nThus\n\nhappened that in the latter half of the nineteenth most modern country on the globe, the old, old conditions for the creation of folk song were reset. Whenever and wherever men have been absolutely dependent upon themselves for entertainment, they have it\n\ncentury in the\n\nsung.\n\nLike their forefathers of a thousand years back, the\n\ncowboys whiled away time and expressed their joys and sorrows in song. Along with old songs the more inventive singers won the attention and applause of their fellows by making up new words and tunes. The new songs passed along from one ranch to another, picking up word variations as they went\n\nSometimes contests were held, the men from one ranch backing their champion in his effort to \"sing down\" a rival from another ranch. Thus it happened, to use the words of Prof. John A. Lomax, that the cowboy ballads \"seem to have sprung up as quietly and and\n\nsettling into better tunes.\n\nmysteriously as does the grass of the plains.\"\n\nThe range\n\npictured in fiction was so romantic and small boy long for a chance to a into silver-horned saddle, a six-shooter at his hip, swing and a lariat at his hand. In reality, however, the life was colorful as to\n\nlife as\n\nmake every\n\nexceedingly monotonous.\n\nPeople who still have the storybook picture of range life ought to read the songs the cowboys made and sang. From such a collection as Cowboy Songs, by Professor Lomax, of Texas University, one gets a more complete picture of the life than a hundred conventional \"Westerns\" could give.\n\nJudged from a literary point of view, most of the verses are pretty crude. Judged from the musical point of view, most of the tunes are extremely simple and unsophisticated. Many of the songs are never printed in the collections for the good reason that they are not printable. But for all that the cowboy ballad is one of the interesting phenomena in the history of American music. And besides, it has about it a vitality and genuineness that give it real musical charm.\n\nSuppose we look for a minute at some of these ballads of the old range life as it looked to the cowboy himself. Again and again they voice his protest against the romantic 35\n\npicture of life drawn by people who knew nothing about it. Here is part of one of the most vigorous of these protests:\n\nA\n\ncowboy's say\n\nSome\n\nlife is it's\n\na dreary, dreary from care:\n\nlife,\n\nfree\n\nRounding up the\n\ncattle\n\nfrom morning\n\ntill\n\nnight\n\nIn the middle of the prairie so bare. Half-past four, the noisy cook will roar, \"\n\n\"\n\nWhoop-a-whoop-a-hey Slowly you will rise with sleepy-feeling eyes, The sweet, dreamy night passed away. !\n\nThe greener\n\nlad he thinks it's play, He'll soon peter out on a cold rainy day, With his big bell spurs and his Spanish hoss, He'll\n\nswear\n\nto\n\nyou he was once a\n\nboss.\n\nSpringtime sets in, double trouble will begin, The weather is so fierce and cold; Clothes are wet and frozen to our necks, The cattle we can scarcely hold.\n\nThe cowboy's life is a dreary one, He works all day to the setting of the sun; And then his day's work is not done, For there's his night herd\n\nThe wolves and owls with\n\nto\n\ngo on.\n\ntheir terrifying\n\nhowls\n\nWill disturb us in our midnight dream, As we lie on our slickers on a cold, rainy night Way over on the Pecos stream.\n\nMany other songs describe the long drive to the railroad in Kansas or the juicy grass of the Northwest. One of the most popular of them with radio singers is \"WhoopeeTi-Yi-Ho, Git Along Little Dogies.\" The dogies, it should be said, were the yearling steers being moved several hundred miles from short to long grass. The song served the double purpose of passing the time for the rider in the saddle and of soothing the cattle and thus lessening the danger of stampede.\n\nTales of heroism in the saddle are often told in the songs. is the story of Utah Carroll, who saved his boss's\n\nThere\n\n36\n\ndaughter by turning the stampede upon himself, and of Charlie Rutlage, killed in a spring round-up, \"a place where death men mock,\" and of Billy Venero, who rode\n\nlittle\n\nthrough certain death to warn the town where his sweetheart lived that an Apache band was on the raid, and of Bill Peters, the stage driver who had to kill \"a pile of wild Comanches,\" but in the end was slain himself. Practical jokes were his meat and drink. Naturally the songs sometimes show up the side of his nature. In one of them a tenderfoot describes how he tackled a cattle-king for a job and he was taken on. All the way out to the ranch he was assured that\n\nCow\n\npunching was nothing but play, you had to do was ride, And only drifting with the tide; The son of a gun, oh, how he lied.\n\nThat\n\nWhen\n\nall\n\nhe reached his\n\noutfit\n\nhe was put on a bronco that\n\nspeedily \"quit the ground.\"\n\npranks. Not by any means. As one reads or listens to the songs one gets to feel that down\n\nBut the\n\nlife\n\nwas not\n\nall\n\nunderneath the cowboy's waggery and reckless courage, he was often a very lonesome, homesick individual who longed for a\n\nmore\n\nsettled\n\nlife.\n\nMany\n\nof the songs are built\n\nsentimental memories of the old sister or sweetheart left behind.\n\nhome and\n\nupon\n\nthe mother or\n\nIn \"Texas Rangers,\" for\n\ninstance, the singer delivers this wise admonition:\n\nPerhaps you have a mother, likewise a sister, too, And maybe you have a sweetheart to weep and mourn for you; If\n\nI'd\n\nthat be your situation, altho you'd like to roam, advise you by experience, you had better stay at home.\n\nI've seen the fruits of rambling, I\n\nI've crossed the\n\nknow\n\nRocky Mountains, rode\n\nits\n\nhardships well, the streets of\n\ndown\n\nhell,\n\nI've\n\nbeen\n\nin the great southwest,\n\nwhere the wild Apaches\n\nroam,\n\nAnd\n\nI tell\n\nyou from experience, you had better stay 37\n\nat\n\nhome.\n\nIn another favorite song a cowboy has decided to go to Dixie \"when the work's all done this fall.\" His is the old story of the prodigal son: he has been a tough one, he says, and \"taken on great, big jags.\" But now he sees the error of his ways and plans that when the round-ups are over and the shipping is done, he will go home before\n\nhome\n\nmoney is spent. But, alas! that night he was on guard, the cattle broke into a stampede. The song concludes:\n\nhis\n\nPoor Charlie was buried\n\nat sunrise,\n\nno tombstone\n\nat his\n\nhead, little board, and this is what it said, \"Charlie died at daybreak, he died from a fall, And he'll not see his mother when the work's all done this\n\nNothing but a\n\nfall.\"\n\nOn\n\nthe whole, these ranch songs give one the feeling first time he is seeing the cowboy's life in its true colors. There are still romance and danger in it, still that for the\n\nrecklessness and shootings, still practical jokes and windy bragging. All these features of the storybook cowboy re-\n\nmain. But along with them are so many other elements that the picture seems real and complete, and the cowboy himself more human (and therefore more lovable) than he has\n\nseemed If\n\nthen\n\nbefore.\n\nthe radio has helped us to get a truer picture of him, it a debt of gratitude.\n\nwe owe\n\nCowboy\n\nballads at our\n\nown\n\nfiresides\n\nand originally American as cornbread.\n\n38\n\nthey are as wholly\n\nTHAU'S GOLD IN THEM HILLBILLIES by Kyle Crichton\n\nThe young man with the Adam's apple seemed out of place in a New York elevator. Very definitely he was not a New Yorker and in addition he was not welcome in the crowded car because he carried under his arm a case that looked like a rough box for a horse. \"Will y'all pahdon me?\" he said plaintively. \"Ah'm havin* some trouble with this here git-tar.\" He carried the trouble with him when he got off at the eleventh floor and was presently in a room before a microphone having an audition for phonograph records. He said, with some hesitation, that he would do imitations of Jimmie Rodgers and started in a thin wailing voice to do Blue Yodel, No. 1, which has for its theme: \"T for Texas, T for Tennessee and T for Thelma.\" It seemed that Thelma had made a bum out of somebody and was to receive a bullet from a .44 through her middle \"just for to see her jump and fall.\" This was the rare thing of a New York audition for hillThe general practice is to billy songs and race records. take a recording outfit into the territory where such songs grow and out of this endeavor have come such classics as The Wreck of Old 97, Floyd Collins in the Cave, Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane, The Old Hen Cackles, and The Rooster's Coin' ta Crow, Crazy Blues, Jimmie Rodgers and his Blue Yodels (Nos. 1 to 12), That Thing Called Love, Just Because, Deep Elam Blues, The Prisoner's Song, Comin' the Mountain, Hand Me Down My Walkin' Cane, Casey Jones, Twenty-one Years, and hundreds of others.

Mamie was forthwith yanked\n\nback into the studio and this time she brought with her a horrendous five-piece band known as Mamie Smith's Jazz Hounds. They made Crazy Blues and It's Right Here for You.\n\n\"The most awful record ever made,\" reports Mr. Peer, \"and it sold over a million copies.\"\n\nA\n\nMarket Nobody Thought Of\n\nBert Williams, the colored comedian, had been making records for Columbia for many years but the companies never imagined that the Negroes themselves might be a 40\n\nmarket for Negro records. In fact,, the companies carefully hid the fact that colored singers were being used. About this time, dealers in New York began to report a curious trend in the business. It seemed that Negro Pullman porters on trains going South invariably left New York with as as twenty-five records under their arms. Since the records cost one dollar each, the business was big stuff and Mr. Peer went South to investigate. He found (a) that the\n\nmany\n\nNegroes were buying records of their own people in great quantities and (b) that the Negroes of Richmond, Virginia, invariably referred to themselves as The Race.\n\n\"We had\n\nrecords by\n\nall\n\nforeign groups,\" says Mr. Peer.\n\nrecords, Swedish records, Polish records, but we afraid to advertise Negro records. So I listed them\n\n\"German were\n\nin the catalogue as 'race' records\n\nand they are\n\nstill\n\nknown\n\nas that.\"\n\nAbout\n\nthis\n\ntime the vogue of\n\nMamie Smith\n\nat\n\nOkeh was\n\nthe arrival of the great Bessie Smith on Columbia records. Bessie Smith had now become almost a legendary figure and her records have lately been reissued\n\nswamped by\n\nin a\n\nnew form and\n\nare considered classics in blues singing\n\nby experts. Her most famous was Gold Coast Blues, which originally sold into the millions.

For some reason Atlanta is the worst town in the South for Negro talent (then and now), and Mr. Peer was soon stumped. At the suggestion of a local dealer, who guaranteed to sell enough records to cover the cost, he did a\n\nfew recordings by Fiddler John Carson, a white mountaineer who arrived for the recordings in overalls. Old John had been a ballyhoo man with a circus, had a repertory of hillbilly songs that never ended, and he could sing a bit with his fiddling. He made Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane, and The Old Hen Cackles and The Rooster's Coin' ta Crow. \"It was so bad that we didn't even put a serial number on the records, thinking that when the local dealer got his 41\n\nsupply, that would be the end of it,\" says Mr. Peer. \"We sent him 1,000 records, which he received on a Thursday. That night he called New York on the phone and ordered 5,000 more sent by express and 10,000 by freight. When the national sale got to 500,000, we were so ashamed we had Fiddler John come up to New York and do a re-recording of the numbers.\"\n\nIt\n\nThe matter of the name arose again in this connection. was obviously impossible to list them under the designa-\n\ntion of each section (mountaineer, \"Georgia Cracker,\" etc.)\n\nand Mr. Peer, who had come from Kansas City and was well acquainted with the Ozarks, named them hillbilly records. The result is that the word has come to have a general application, and mountaineers of all sections are now known as hillbillies.\n\ngreatest success of all time was made by The PrisonSong, which was introduced almost as an after thought\n\nThe er's\n\nby Vernon Dalhart, who had done The Wreck of Old 97 and was desperate for something for the other side of the record. It eventually sold 2,500,000 records for the Victor company. It cost the company seven cents to make the record (all expenses included) and the wholesale price they received\n\nwas\n\nthirty-seven cents a record.\n\nThe Singing Brakeman\n\nThe greatest of all romances in the hillbilly business centers about Jimmie Rodgers, the little railroad brakeman\n\nwho\n\nfought desperately against poverty and the ravages of tuberculosis until Mr. Peer discovered him in Bristol, Ten-\n\nnessee, and started him on a career that was fabulous even in the phonograph industry. It is estimated that the Blue Yodel records sold over 5,000,000 copies.

Bob and Joe Shelton, who also come from Shreveport, wrote Just Because in collaboration with Leon Chappalear. When it became a success, they followed immediately with An Answer to Just Because and followed that with Just Because III. It is quite possible that the thing could go on forever. Students are convinced that Bessie Smith and particularly the players who accompanied Bessie Smith on her records had a great part in stimulating the disease known as swing music, which has now gripped the nation. Bessie had such men doing her accompaniments as Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Joe Smith, Fred Longshaw, Charlie Green and the late James P. Johnson, one of the 43\n\nmost spectacular of the hot pianists. Musicians are the keenest people in the world at admiring new talent and just as Benny Goodman will sit goggle-eyed and listening to the \"hotteties\" of Count Basie, the colored demon of Kansas City, so did the orchestra leaders of ten years ago go insane over the berserk playing of Bessie Smith's boys. From the interest came the change in orchestra music that is now so pronounced in the work of Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Glen Gray, Jimmy Dorsey and others. The traditional folk songs of the Southern mountaineers and the spirituals have not been included in this discussion\n\nbecause they occupy a special position in the art of song. In the strictest sense the mountaineer ballads are old English folk songs, some of them even traceable to old Gregorian chants; and as such they are not strictly American products. New York was recently visited by the Rev. John William\n\nDawson, pastor of the Dry Fork Primitive Baptist Church of Morehead, Kentucky, who sang Lord, Spare Me for Another Year and The Wayfaring Stranger. The words seemed to have grown out of local legends of the mountains but the tunes stemmed back to the earliest days of American history when the first settlers crossed from the old country. Most strictly in the American tradition are the songs of Aunt Molly Jackson of Harlan County, Kentucky, who has told the story of the labor struggles of that section.\n\nHer\n\nsongs are richly evocative and thrilling, carrying the trou-\n\nbadour quality of\n\nold.\n\nFans Are Delighted\n\nBut it's when Sleepy John Estes on his guitar and Hammie Nix on his mouth organ get wound up that the newfound fans start yammering with delight. There are isolated groups in all sections of the world prepared to fight to the death to prove that Maxine Sullivan, from the Onyx, is a greater artist than Lily Pons. Miss Sullivan became the storm center of radio controversy as the first person to swing Loch Lomond and other ballads. There are strange individuals who wouldn't give a Georgia White and Rhubarb Red (guitar) record for anything made by Caruso.\n\nThe is\n\ncult of the hillbillies\n\nsignificant that\n\nmay\n\nbe a passing fancy but\n\nit\n\nAmbrose, the swankiest orchestra con44\n\nductor in London, has made an arrangement of Nobody's Darling But Mine.

In the meanwhile, the world will need to be content with the nasal-voice boys and girls of the hinterlands who have most curious things to say about love and My Gal Sal. There seems to be an awful lot of double-crossing done by the ladies in the \"mountings,\" and they invariably pay for it. This makes art.\n\n45\n\nTHE COUNTRY DANCE GOES TO TOWN by Esther G. Grayson\n\nThe country dance\n\nis\n\ncoming back. Like Chinese check-\n\ners or cross-word puzzles, it grows on people, and a rising tide of enthusiasm is evident in many parts of the United States.\n\nHere in New York are many Square Dance Clubs which meet weekly and hold monthly or bi-monthly open houses. Society folk on Long Island are promenading and swinging with all the eagerness of children on their first roller skates. In the outlying counties of New York State enthusiastic square dance groups have perfected their routines and are in\n\ndemand\n\nfor exhibition work.\n\nIn other parts of the country the movement is just as healthy. In El Paso, Texas, there are Square Dance Clubs in every section of the city, comprising some 2,000 dancers in all. The cowboy or Western country dance, under the leadership of Lloyd Shaw in Denver, has spread all over Colorado and much of the Rocky Mountain area. From Maine to Oregon, the dances of grandfather's day are again flourishing.\n\nOne reason\n\nfor the revival is that these old dances are In trying to forget wars and rumors of wars, and all the other complications of modern life, both youngsters and adults turned a few years ago from the tango and the fox trot to the shag and the truck, where speed and skill were the chief requisites. Then they took the big apple to their hearts because it gave them a rip-roaring good time. They learned and enjoyed the Lambeth Walk, and now they are taking up the black-out, London's latest rage and another member of the same fast-moving, romping family of modern dances. All these dances call for frequent changes of steps and partners and all need fast music, often with amusing\n\nfun.\n\nwords\n\nto accompany it.

There is sound reason for dragging the square and the country dance out of the barn and the grange hall and giving them places of honor on private and public dance floors. hilarity,\n\nare varied.\n\nCountry dances really fall into three groups, the square dances, the circle dances and the contras, of which the Virginia reel is the best known. All have venerable origins.\n\nThe so-called American Squares, which have always been the most popular of the country dances here, are really quadrilles which reached us originally from France by way of the French refugees who came to this country in the early days of its settlement and taught dancing for a living. Having been a part of our tradition since pioneer days, these dances have undergone many changes in form and have lost all their dignity and some of their beauty. But American Squares, those dances are known as the Girl from Arkansas, Birdie in a Cage, the Basket Quadrille and many others have gained in zest and verve what they have as\n\nlost in stateliness.\n\nSome of the circle dances, like the Wild Irishman, have many of the elements of the early singing games. The Paul is another example of the circle dance, which is unexcelled for getting a slow crowd started or for ending the evening with a bang.\n\nJones\n\nThe Virginia reel is probably the best known of the contra dances, which are performed by two facing lines of partners. The Scotch and Irish reels, the Devil's Dream and the Tempest all come under this classification. The end couples do most of the dancing and move down or cast off after their turn to leave new couples in the key positions. Square dance steps and figures vary in different sections of the country, and so do the \"calls\" and rhymes sung by clever caller and a lively fiddler or small the leader.\n\nA\n\norchestra familiar with the right music are essential to the success of the country dance. In the old days the fiddler usually did the calling, and in many communities today old-\n\ntimers have been discovered and promoted to belated popularity because of their gifts in this field. The square dance caller performs the same function as the night-club host 47\n\nwho\n\nleads the singing, knows all the habitues and cracks jokes to keep the fun going. The stock in trade of the caller is his chant, consisting of rhymed instructions to the dancers which vary with each The old-time calls are figure and often with each tune. old-time humor and the caller often has his with savory for own variations. There was, example, a time and a place where the country dance began with the caller's instructions to\n\nHang up your\n\nAnd\n\nspit\n\ncoat\n\non the wall\n\nChoose your partners\n\nAnd promenade\n\nall!\n\nthe caller's job to announce each figure in the dance it begins, and thus to maintain a constant flow of unbroken motion as the changing patterns are executed. If he is calling for a group of expert dancers, it is part of the It is\n\njust as\n\nfor him to call unexpected variations in an effort to catch someone napping. Exact rhymes are unimportant details in such a chant as:\n\ngame\n\nRun And\n\nacross and don't get lost, give your opposite lady a toss.\n\nAround you go just like a wheel; The faster you go, the better you\n\nfeel.\n\nMeet that\n\ngal and hug her tight.

Salute your partners, all. Swing your corner lady And promenade the hall! 48\n\nAs\n\nwell-known airs such as Comin' Round the Mountain\" and \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" are generally used. But many of the youngsters prefer to square dance to strictly modern music, and many groups use that exclusively. It is really the abandon with which the music is played, the gifts of the caller and the gala spirit of the dancers themselves which have enabled the country dance to go to town. for the music, the simple, \"Turkey in the Straw,\" \"Shell Be\n\nSONGS FROM TEXAS by\n\nTime Magazine\n\n\"New San Antonio\n\nRose,\" may baffle or even and its tune is strictly golden bantam. Yet last week Decca Records reported that in January alone the song had sold 84,500 discs sung by the Caruso of the juke boxes, bland Bing Crosby. \"New San Antonio Rose\" was evidence of a new factor in the U. S. song business. It was written by Texan Bob Wills, and recorded a year ago (in Columbia's catalogue) by Wills and his Texas Playboys. It was a seller long before Tin Pan Alley heard it.

S. today is hillbilly. By last week the flood of camp-meetin* melody, which had been rising steadily in juke joints and on radio programs for over a year, was swamping Tin Pan Alley. Big names in the drawling art of country and cowboy balladry like Gene Autry, the Carter Family, Roy Acuff and Al Dexter were selling on discs as never before. Top-flight songsters like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra were making their biggest smashes with hillbilly tunes. A homely earful of the purest Texas corn, Al Dexter's \"Pistol Packin' Mama,\" had edged its way to first place among the nation's juke-box favorites. Even many of Tin Pan Alley's best-sellers, such tunes as \"You'll Never Know,\" \"Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer,\" \"There's a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere,\" were fragrant with hillbilly spirit. All over the country were the Appalachian accents of the geetar and the country\n\nfiddle.\n\nAll this constituted the biggest revolution in U. S. popular musical taste since the \"swing\" craze began in the\n\nmiddle '30s. Public demand was shifting from Afro-American stomps and blues to a much simpler (and often monotonous) musical idiom that was old when nostalgic '49ers were singing \"Clementine.\" Hillbilly music is the direct descendant of the Scottish, Irish and English ballads that were brought to North America by the earliest white settlers. Preserved in the U. S. backwoods by generations of hard-bitten country folk, the old hillbilly ballads are sometimes of rare melodic beauty. But most of them hew closely\n\nfew homely, foursquare formulas. The songs get their if any, from their words long narrative poems evolved by generations of backwoods minstrels. BRAKEMAN RODGERS. For years hillbilly music remained a branch of folklore to most urban Americans if they knew of it at all. But in 1921 a Kansas City-born folkto a\n\nquality,\n\n\"Reprinted by permission from Time, Vol. Copyright 1943, Time Inc.\"\n\n52\n\n42,\n\nNo.\n\n14,\n\nOctober\n\n4,\n\nnamed Ralph Peer (then sales manager for Okeh Records) took a recording apparatus into the backwoods of Georgia and made some 300 disks. As an experiment, Okeh issued Peer's recordings, listing them in a special catalogue similar to those used for foreign language and \"race\" recWithin a few years Okeh's hillbilly list sold over ords. a million disks mostly below the Mason-Dixon line. Tin lore fan\n\nPan Alley\n\npaid no attention. By 1927, attracted by Okeh's success, Victor decided to enter the field, unearthed in Bristol, Va., a former Southern Railway brakeman named Jimmie Rodgers. His quaintly drawling voice soon became the biggest thing in hillbilly still\n\nminstrelsy.\n\nWhat really started the corn sprouting on Broadway was a lugubrious tune by Louisiana's Jimmie Davis called \"It Makes No Difference Now.\" In the late '30s Decca's Recording Chief David Kapp heard this Texas hit and got it on wax. Within a few months record buyers were clamoring for Decca's later Bing Crosby version. Shrewd David Kapp barged wholesale into the hillbilly field, boomed local hits into national smashes by giving them successive recordings by bigger and bigger names. Thus, Crosby became the most popular singer of hillbilly as well as other popular\n\nmusic.\n\nAND\n\nAL FREDDIE. The rage has taken a good part of U. S. song writing out of the hands of Tin Pan Alley's veterans. Almost any simple soul might write hillbilly words and the composition of hillbilly music has always been regarded by Tin Pan Alley as a variety of unskilled labor. Chief among the newcomers are Texas-born Al Dexter (\"Pistol Packin' Mama\"), Indiana-born Freddie Rose (\"Low and Lonely,\" \"I'll Reap My Harvest in Heaven\"), the Carter Family of Bristol, Va. (\"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\"), Texas-born Bob Wills (\"New San Antonio Rose\").\n\nSHOUTING BAPTIST.
