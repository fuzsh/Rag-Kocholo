        "text": "Lynchburg is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The population was 75,568 as of 2010.[3] Located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains along the banks of the James River, Lynchburg is known as the \"City of Seven Hills\" or \"The Hill City.\" Lynchburg was the only major city in Virginia that did not fall to the Union in the American Civil War.\n\nThe Metropolitan Statistical Area of Lynchburg of 2,122 square miles (5,500 km2) is near the geographic center of Virginia and encompasses Amherst County, Appomattox County, Bedford County, Campbell County, City of Bedford, and the City of Lynchburg. It is the fifth largest MSA in Virginia with a population of 246,036.[4] Other nearby cities include Roanoke, Charlottesville, and Danville. Lynchburg's sister cities are Rueil-Malmaison, France and Glauchau, Germany.\n\nLynchburg is the home of Central Virginia Community College, Liberty University, Lynchburg College, Randolph College, and Virginia University of Lynchburg. The Lynchburg MSA also includes Sweet Briar College.\n\nContents\n\n1 Demographics\n\n2 Geography and climate\n\n2.1 Adjacent counties\n\n3 Business and industry\n\n4 History\n\n5 Education\n\n6 Health care\n\n7 Transportation\n\n7.1 Local Transit\n\n7.2 Intercity Transit\n\n7.2.1 Bus\n\n7.2.2 Rail\n\n7.2.3 Air\n\n7.2.4 Highway\n\n8 Arts and culture\n\n9 Attractions and entertainment\n\n10 Sports and recreation\n\n11 Neighborhoods\n\n12 Notable residents\n\n13 Media\n\n13.1 Print\n\n13.2 Television\n\n13.3 Radio\n\n14 Lynchburg in popular culture\n\n15 See also\n\n16 References\n\n17 External links\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there were 65,269 people, 25,477 households, and 15,591 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,321.5 people per square mile (510.2/km²). There were 27,640 housing units at an average density of 559.6 per square mile (216.1/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 67.2% White, 28.5% African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.63% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.8% of the population.\n\nThere were 25,477 households out of which 27.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.6% were married couples living together, 16.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.8% were non-families. 32.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the city the population was spread out with 22.1% under the age of 18, 15.5% from 18 to 24, 25.3% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 16.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 84.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $32,234, and the median income for a family was $40,844. Males had a median income of $31,390 versus $22,431 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,263. About 12.3% of families and 15.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.4% of those under age 18 and 10.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\nLynchburg ranks below the 2006 median annual household income for the U.S. as a whole, which was $48,200, according to the US Census Bureau.[3]\n\nThe city's population has been stable for 25+ years: in 2006, it was 67,720; in 2000, it was 65,269; in 1990, it was 66,049; in 1980, it was 66,743.[4][5]\n\nIn 2009 almost 27% of Lynchburg children lived in poverty. The state average that year was 14 percent. [5]\n\nGeography and climate\n\nLynchburg is located at (37.403672, -79.170205).[6]\n\nMap\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 49.8 square miles (129 km2), of which, 49.4 square miles (128 km2) of it is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) of it (0.74%) is water.\n\nLynchburg has a four-season humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with cool winters and hot, humid summers. Monthly average temperatures range from 34.5 °F (1.4 °C) in January to 75.1 °F (23.9 °C) in July, with an annual mean of 55.4 °F (13.0 °C). Nights tend to be significantly cooler than days throughout much of the year due in part to the moderate elevation. In a typical year, there are 24 days with a high temperature 90 °F (32 °C) or above, and 9 days with a high of 32 °F (0 °C) or below.[7] Snowfall, which averages 19 inches (48 cm) per season, usually falls in small amounts at a time; the median is less than half of the average.[7]\n\nClimate data for Lynchburg, Virginia Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °F (°C) 44.5\n\n(6.9) 48.6\n\n(9.2) 57.6\n\n(14.2) 68.0\n\n(20.0) 75.5\n\n(24.2) 82.5\n\n(28.1) 86.4\n\n(30.2) 85.1\n\n(29.5) 78.3\n\n(25.7) 68.4\n\n(20.2) 58.0\n\n(14.4) 48.4\n\n(9.1) 66.8 Average low °F (°C) 24.5\n\n(−4.2) 26.9\n\n(−2.8) 34.4\n\n(1.3) 42.6\n\n(5.9) 51.2\n\n(10.7) 59.5\n\n(15.3) 63.7\n\n(17.6) 62.4\n\n(16.9) 55.9\n\n(13.3) 43.7\n\n(6.5) 35.2\n\n(1.8) 27.9\n\n(−2.3) 44.0 Precipitation inches (mm) 3.54\n\n(89.9) 3.10\n\n(78.7) 3.83\n\n(97.3) 3.46\n\n(87.9) 4.11\n\n(104.4) 3.79\n\n(96.3) 4.39\n\n(111.5) 3.41\n\n(86.6) 3.88\n\n(98.6) 3.39\n\n(86.1) 3.18\n\n(80.8) 3.23\n\n(82) 43.31\n\n(1,100.1) Snowfall inches (cm) 5.6\n\n(14.2) 6.9\n\n(17.5) 2.8\n\n(7.1) .4\n\n(1) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) .1\n\n(0.3) .5\n\n(1.3) 2.3\n\n(5.8) 18.6\n\n(47.2) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 10.6 9.5 11.0 9.7 12.1 10.3 11.0 9.3 8.6 7.7 8.7 10.0 118.5 Avg. snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 2.7 2.8 1.4 .3 0 0 0 0 0 0 .3 1.2 8.7 Sunshine hours 167.4 169.5 223.2 243.0 272.8 288.0 272.8 257.3 228.0 213.9 171.0 155.0 2,661.9 Source no. 1: NOAA (1971−2000)[7] Source no. 2: HKO (sun, 1961−1990)[8]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nAmherst County, Virginia - northeast\n\nBedford County, Virginia - west, northwest\n\nCampbell County, Virginia - south, southeast\n\nBusiness and industry\n\nLynchburg features a skilled labor force, low unemployment rate,[9] and below average cost of living. Of Virginia's larger metro areas, Forbes Magazine ranked Lynchburg the 5th best place in Virginia for business in 2006, with Virginia being the best state in the country for business.[10] Only 6 places in Virginia were surveyed and most of Virginia’s cities were grouped together by Forbes as \"Northern Virginia\". Lynchburg achieved the rank 109 in the whole nation in the same survey.\n\nIndustries within the Lynchburg MSA include nuclear technology, pharmaceuticals and material handling. A diversity of small businesses with the region has helped maintain a stable economy and minimized the downturns of the national economy.[11][12] Reaching as high as 1st place (tied) in 2007, Lynchburg has been within the Top 10 Digital Cities survey for its population since the survey's inception in 2004.\n\nThe Lynchburg News & Advance reports that while more people are working than ever in greater Lynchburg, wages since 1990 have not kept up with inflation. Central Virginia Labor Council President Walter Fore believes this is due to lack of white-collar jobs. According to the Census Bureau, adjusted for inflation, 1990 median household income was about $39,000 compared to 2009 median household income of $42,740. As of 2009 Forbes has named Lynchburg as the 70th best metro area for business and careers, ahead of Chicago and behind Baton Rouge. The reason for the decent ranking was due to the low cost of living and low wages in Lynchburg. In other areas, the region didn’t come in as strong. It ranked at 189 for cultural and leisure and at 164 for educational attainment.[13]\n\nVirginia Business Magazine reports that Young Professionals in Lynchburg recently conducted a study that clearly showed how much of its young workforce has been lost.[14]\n\nHistory\n\nA part of Monacan country upon the arrival of English settlers in Virginia, the region had traditionally been occupied by them and other Siouan Tutelo-speaking tribes since ca. 1270, driving Virginia Algonquians eastward. Explorer John Lederer visited one of the Siouan villages (Saponi) in 1670, on the Staunton River at Otter Creek, southwest of the present-day city, as did Batts and Fallam in 1671. The Siouans occupied the area until c. 1702, when it was taken in conquest by the Seneca Iroquois. The Iroquois ceded control to the Colony of Virginia beginning in 1718, and formally at the Treaty of Albany in 1721.\n\nFirst settled in 1757, Lynchburg was named for its founder, John Lynch, who at the age of 17 started a ferry service at a ford across the James River to carry traffic to and from New London. He was also responsible for Lynchburg's first bridge across the river, which replaced the ferry in 1812. He and his mother are buried in the graveyard at the South River Friends Meetinghouse. The \"City of Seven Hills\" quickly developed along the hills surrounding Lynch's Ferry. Thomas Jefferson maintained a home near Lynchburg, called Poplar Forest. Jefferson frequented Lynchburg and remarked \"Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be useful to the town of Lynchburg. I consider it as the most interesting spot in the state.\"\n\nLynchburg was established by charter in 1786 at the site of Lynch's Ferry on the James River. These new easy means of transportation routed traffic through Lynchburg, and allowed it to become the new center of commerce for tobacco trading. In 1810, Jefferson wrote, \"Lynchburg is perhaps the most rising place in the U.S.... It ranks now next to Richmond in importance...\" Lynchburg became a center of commerce and manufacture in the 19th century, and by the 1850s, Lynchburg (along with New Bedford, Mass.) was one of the richest towns per capita in the U.S.[15] Chief industries were tobacco, iron and steel. Transportation facilities included the James River Bateau on the James River, and later, the James River and Kanawha Canal and, still later, four railroads, including the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad.\n\nEarly on, Lynchburg was not known for its religiosity. In 1804, evangelist Lorenzo Dow wrote of Lynchburg \"... where I spoke in the open air in what I conceived to be the seat of Satan's Kingdom. Lynchburg was a deadly place for the worship of God.\" This was in reference to the lack of churches in Lynchburg. As the wealth of Lynchburg grew, prostitution and other \"rowdy\" activities became quite common and, in many cases, ignored, if not accepted, by the \"powers that be\" of the time. Much of this activity took place in an area of downtown referred to as the \"Buzzard's Roost[citation needed].\"\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Lynchburg, which served as a Confederate supply base, was approached within 1-mile (1.6 km) by the Union forces of General David Hunter as he drove south from the Shenandoah Valley. Under the false impression that the Confederate forces stationed in Lynchburg were much larger than anticipated, Hunter was repelled by the forces of Confederate General Jubal Early on June 18, 1864, in the Battle of Lynchburg. To create the false impression, a train was continuously run up and down the tracks while the citizens of Lynchburg cheered as if reinforcements were unloading. Local prostitutes took part in the deception, misinforming their Union clients of the large number of Confederate reinforcements.\n\nFrom April 6–10, 1865, Lynchburg served as the Capital of Virginia. Under Gov. William Smith, the executive and legislative branches of the commonwealth moved to Lynchburg for the few days between the fall of Richmond and the fall of the Confederacy.\n\nIn the latter 19th century, Lynchburg's economy evolved into manufacturing (sometimes referred to as the \"Pittsburgh of the South\") and, per capita, made the city one of the wealthiest in the United States. In 1880, Lynchburg resident James Albert Bonsack invented the first cigarette rolling machine, and shortly thereafter Dr. Charles Browne Fleet, a physician and pharmacological tinkerer, introduced the first mass marketed over-the-counter enema. About this time, Lynchburg was also the preferred site for the Norfolk & Western junction with the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. However, the citizens of Lynchburg did not want the junction due to the noise and pollution it would create. Therefore, it was located in what would become the City of Roanoke.\n\nIn the late 1950s, a number of interested citizens requested the federal government to change its long-planned route for the interstate highway now known as I-64 between Clifton Forge and Richmond.[16] Since the 1940s, maps of the federal interstate highway system depicted that highway taking a northern route, with no interstate highway running through Lynchburg.[17] The state highway commission's minutes reflected its approval of the northern route.[18] Although the proponents of a southern route succeeded in persuading a majority of Virginia Highway Commissioners to support the change after a study, in July 1961 Governor Lindsay Almond and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges announced that the route would not be changed.[19] This left Lynchburg as the only city with a population in excess of 50,000 (at the time) not served by an interstate.[20]\n\nFor several decades throughout the mid-20th century, the state of Virginia authorized compulsory sterilization of the mentally retarded for the purpose of eugenics. The operations were carried out at the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, now known as the Central Virginia Training School, located just outside Lynchburg. An estimated 8,300 Virginians were sterilized and relocated to Lynchburg, known as a \"dumping ground\" of sorts for the feeble-minded, poor, blind, epilectic, and those otherwise seen as genetically \"unfit\".[21]\n\nSterilizations were carried out for 35 years until 1972, when operations were finally halted. Later in the late 1970s, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit against the state of Virginia on behalf of the sterilization victims. As a result of this suit, the victims received formal apologies and counseling if they chose. Requests to grant the victims reverse sterilization operations were denied.\n\nCarrie Buck, the plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, was sterilized after being classified as \"feeble-minded\", as part of the state's eugenics program while she was a patient at the Lynchburg Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded.\n\nThe story of Carrie Buck's sterilization and the court case was made into a television drama in 1994, Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story.\n\n\"Virginia State Epileptic Colony,\" a song by the Manic Street Preachers on their 2009 album 'Journal For Plague Lovers,' addresses the state's program of eugenics.\n\nOver 40 sites in Lynchburg are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[22]\n\nEducation\n\nThe city is served by the Lynchburg City Public Schools. The school board is appointed by the Lynchburg City Council.\n\nE C Glass High School - 2111 Memorial Ave\n\nHeritage High School - 3020 Wards Ferry Rd\n\nLinkhorne Middle School - 2525 Linkhorne Dr\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar Middle School - 1208 Polk St\n\nSandusky Middle School - 805 Chinook Place\n\nWilliam Marvin Bass Elementary School\n\nBedford Hills Elementary School\n\nDearington Elementary School for Innovation\n\nHeritage Elementary School\n\nLinkhorne Elementary School\n\nPaul M.

Miller Elementary School\n\nThe city is also home to a number of mostly religious private schools, including Holy Cross Regional Catholic School, James River Day School, Liberty Christian Academy, New Covenant Classical Christian School, and Virginia Episcopal School.\n\nLynchburg is also home to the Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology located in Heritage High School. This magnet school consists of juniors and seniors selected from each of the Lynchburg area high schools. As one of eighteen Governor's Schools in Virginia, the Central Virginia Governor's School focuses on infusing technology into both the math and science curriculum.\n\nFurther education options include a number of surrounding county public school systems.\n\nColleges and universities in Lynchburg include Central Virginia Community College, Liberty University, Lynchburg College, Randolph College, and Virginia University of Lynchburg.\n\nHealth care\n\nLynchburg General Hospital-Lynchburg, VA\n\nVirginia Baptist Hospital-Lynchburg, VA\n\nBedford Memorial Hospital-Bedford, VA (has joint partnership with Carilion Health System in Roanoke)\n\nTransportation\n\nLocal Transit\n\nThe Greater Lynchburg Transit Company (GLTC) operates the local public transport bus service within the city. The GLTC additionally provides the shuttle bus service on the Liberty University campus.\n\nThe GLTC has selected a property directly across from Lynchburg-Kemper Street Station as its top choice of sites upon which to build the new transfer center for their network of public buses. They are interested in facilitating intermodal connections between GLTC buses and the intercity bus and rail services which operate from that location. The project is awaiting final government approval and funding, and is expected to be completed around 2013.[23]\n\nIntercity Transit\n\nIntercity passenger rail and bus services are based out of Kemper Street Station, a historic, three-story train station recently restored and converted by the city of Lynchburg to serve as an intermodal hub for the community. The station is located at 825 Kemper Street.[24]\n\nBus\n\nGreyhound Lines located their bus terminal in the main floor of Kemper Street Station following its 2002 restoration.[24] Greyhound offers transport to other cities throughout Virginia, the US, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nRail\n\nAmtrak's Crescent and Northeast Regional trains connect Lynchburg with the cities of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Charlotte, Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans. Lynchburg became the new southern terminus for the Northeast Regional in October 2009. Amtrak's passenger terminal in Lynchburg is located in the track level ground floor of Kemper Street Station.[25]\n\nAlso, Lynchburg has two major freight railroads. CSX Transportation has a line and a small yard in the city. Lynchburg is also a crossroad of two Norfolk Southern lines. One being the former mainline of Southern Railway, upon which Kemper Street Station is situated. NS has a classification yard located next to the shopping mall. Various yard jobs can be seen. Railfans who wish to visit the NS Lynchburg yard are advised to inquire with an NS official.\n\nAir\n\nLynchburg Regional Airport is solely served by US Airways Express to Charlotte. US Airways Express is the only current scheduled airline service provider. In recent months air travel has increased with 7,400 passengers flying in and out of the airport in April 2009—an increase of 97%.\n\nHighway\n\nPrimary roadways include U.S. Route 29, U.S. Route 501, U.S. Route 221, running north-south, and U.S. Highway 460, running east-west. While not served by an interstate, much of Route 29 has been upgraded to interstate standards and significant improvements have been made to Highway 460.\n\nArts and culture\n\nIn a Forbes Magazine survey, Lynchburg ranked very poorly when it comes to culture. It ranked at 189 for cultural and leisure out of 200 cities surveyed.[13]\n\nAttractions and entertainment\n\nThe following attractions are located within the Lynchburg MSA:\n\nPoplar Forest: Thomas Jefferson's retreat home.
