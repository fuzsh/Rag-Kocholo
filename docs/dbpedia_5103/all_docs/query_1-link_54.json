        "text": "Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America Records\n\nThe records of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America document the Fraternal and social organization of Italian Americans founded in 1930 in Pittsburgh by individuals who had been expelled or were former members of the Order Sons of Italy of America, Grand Lodge.

Records, 1911-1979\n\nThe increase in Italian immigrants in Leechburg, PA and their growing need for a social and mutual benefits society resulted in the formation of the Societa Guglielmo di Mutuo Soccorso (William Marconi Lodge of Mutual Benefit) in February 1911. The records span the years 1911-1979, in which there are minutes books for this entire period. Additional records include constitution and by-laws, legal papers, anniversary programs, name lists, and correspondence.\n\nEthnic Fraternal Organizations Oral History Project Collection\n\nThe Ethnic Fraternal Organizations Oral History Project consists of taperecorded oral interviews from a project conducted by the University of Pittsburgh Department of History which explores the roles and influences of ethnic fraternal organizations in the Jewish, Black, Croatian, Italian, Polish and other ethnic communities in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nRadio Italia Collection\n\nThis collection contains sound recordings of Italian popular music in various formats that were collected by Sal Patitucci and used by him in his Radio Italia with Sal Patitucci program, which first broadcast over WKPA radio in New Kensington, PA.In the 1970s, Sal's radio program expanded, being broadcast over WDUQ-FM, WEDO-AM, and WYEP, among others. His radio program aired six-days per week in the U.S., the only Italian language program to do so.\n\nLuigia Clerici Papers\n\nThe Papers of Luigia Clerici consist of a collection of handwritten notebooks and workbooks in Italian, describing methods of instruction and curriculum in the schools of Bologna, Italy, in the 1890's.\n\nBruno De Finetti Papers\n\nAn Italian probabilist and statistician noted for the \"operational subjective\" conception of probability, de Finetti provided significant contributions to the theory and the foundations of probability; his work laid the foundation for the modern subjectivist interpretation of probability (1924-2000).\n\nJoe Negri Collection\n\nThe Joe Negri Collection contains the original scores, notes, and sound recordings documenting Joe Negri's career from his earliest days performing with his brother, through his years at then Carnegie Tech, up to his current work as a jazz guitarist.\n\nRuth Crawford Mitchell Papers\n\nThe papers of Ruth Crawford Mitchell center primarily on her life-long interest in immigrants in the United States, including Italian immigrants. This arises in the collection in the form of two studies, one on second-generation students of foreign descent and another on the nativity of Pitt students. The Nativity Study takes up the bulk of the collection and includes the three bound volumes which make up the summary of the study. The remainder of the Nativity Study includes reports, raw data, tables and information on individual students."
