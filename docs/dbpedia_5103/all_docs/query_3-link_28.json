        "text": "Mass Notification System\n\nLynchburg City Schools uses a mass notification system to send emails, phone calls, and text messages to parents and staff. These messages include important school updates and emergency notifications.\n\nParents, students, and staff can choose to receive text messages from schools and the division. To opt in, ensure that your cell phone number is listed in your contact information in Infinite Campus. If you haven’t already done so, you will then need to text “Y” to 67587. You can opt-out at any time by texting “N” to 67587.\n\nIf you are not receiving school or emergency notifications, or if you would like to update your contact preferences, contact the LCS HelpDesk at (434) 515-5090. The HelpDesk is available from 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nWeather Alerts\n\nSafety for students and staff is always our top priority at Lynchburg City Schools, so as temperatures start to drop and the possibility of winter weather increases, we may need to close, delay, or dismiss schools early. When inclement weather approaches, LCS consults with the City of Lynchburg, GLTC, and surrounding counties to assess road conditions. LCS Facilities and Transportation staff will also survey roads, sidewalks, and school parking lots at night and early in the morning. We try to make decisions as early as possible, while always keeping safety in mind.\n\nIn the event of inclement weather, we will communicate with LCS families and staff by email, phone, and text through School Messenger. Updates will also be shared on the LCS website, LCS social media pages, and through local media outlets.\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nIf an employee who is expected to work on inclement weather days does not report to work that day, they will turn in a leave form for either personal leave or vacation leave. If the employee does not have personal or vacation leave balance, their pay will be docked for that day.\n\nWhen school is closed due to inclement weather, all after-school activities are canceled unless approved by the Superintendent or their designee.\n\nAny early dismissal due to inclement weather will be on the 1/2 day schedule.\n\nInclement Weather: Things We Do and Take into Consideration"
