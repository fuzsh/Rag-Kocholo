        "text": "There is something dreamlike about Liberty University’s campus, with its neat rectangles of lawn and academic buildings so new that they could be a stage set. Packs of youth roam tidy walkways, tossing balls and toting Bibles. Looking west, beyond the school grounds, you get the feeling that there is nothing but hilltops melting slowly into the heavens. In the opposite direction, an enormous “L.U.” monogram is emblazoned on a green slope; a few hills away gleams the white patch of the school’s year-round ski park.\n\n“We need to be careful not to be like the world,” a twenty-one-year-old engineering student named Elizabeth Schultz told me. Schultz grew up in a military family and moved around often as a child; she became “born again” at the age of six. Liberty students talk about “the world” a lot, as something that exists elsewhere, apart from them—a sinful realm that demands engagement but should not be trusted or imitated. The delineation draws from Jesus’ warnings to his followers that they would never be fully at home until they reached the heavenly realm. At Liberty, this detachment can start to feel literal. New students pledge to follow the Liberty Way: no having sex outside of marriage, no listening to music with lewd lyrics, no drinking. On weekend evenings, it’s common to see a couple watching a movie from opposite sides of a dorm-room window, on a laptop positioned such that they can both see the screen: Netflix and chill, Liberty-style.\n\nIn truth, of course, Liberty is not just of the world but an engine of its power and ambition. The campus—seven thousand idyllic acres in Lynchburg, Virginia—is the cradle of a white evangelical dynasty that has shaped a half century of American politics. Jerry Falwell, Sr., made a humble start in the ministry in 1956, preaching to a few dozen worshippers in an elementary school and broadcasting a program called “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” on a Lynchburg radio station. Known as a winsome salesman fond of practical jokes, Falwell steadily won converts, filling successively larger halls, until he presided over a renowned Baptist megachurch and a national television ministry. He founded Liberty, in 1971, with the aim of graduating “champions for Christ.” He remains most famous for forging the Moral Majority, the evangelical political organization that helped to propel Ronald Reagan to the White House and placed the concerns of social conservatives at the center of the Republican agenda.\n\nThe elder Falwell died in 2007 and was buried in a hilltop memorial site at Liberty. His lifework was left to his two sons: the elder, Jerry, Jr., became the president of the university; the younger, Jonathan, assumed the ministry of the megachurch, Thomas Road Baptist, on the edge of campus. Jonathan was seen as upbeat and pious, but Jerry, Jr., was different: a mercurial character who often reminded people that he was not a pastor. “People had sort of an assumption that if you carry the Falwell surname you’re bringing with you the Falwell brand of spirituality,” Jonathan Merritt, a religion writer and Liberty graduate who has known the Falwells since childhood, told me. “Jerry, Jr., made it clear up front that that was not what he wanted to offer.” Instead, he worked diligently to shore up the university’s finances, seizing on the lucrative business of online education. Liberty became one of the largest providers of online learning in the country. As Liberty’s wealth increased—its endowment today is nearly two billion dollars—Falwell, Jr., faced accusations of nepotism and self-dealing, for manipulating the university’s real-estate transactions to funnel money to friends and family. Some online students, too, questioned the quality of the education that they received. But these complaints tended to be eclipsed by the flashy results: a backwater Bible school became a flush university with elaborate facilities, competitive sports teams, and more than a hundred thousand students. (The vast majority of Liberty’s student population is enrolled online.) “For the longest time, people would say he’s doing a bang-up job, because look at all the numbers!” David Baggett, a philosophy professor who left Liberty in 2020 to become the director of the Center for the Foundations of Ethics at Houston Baptist University, told me. “It was astounding, all the money they were raising.”\n\nDonald Trump’s first Presidential campaign represented a new turn for Falwell. He hitched himself to the Republican candidate, steadfastly defending even the worst of Trump’s behavior and encouraging MAGA jingoism to take hold at Liberty. Falwell relished his turn as a political kingmaker, in the tradition of his father, but, privately, he was succumbing to the temptations of the world. A very public downfall was coming and, with it, a broader reckoning for Liberty.\n\n[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]\n\nDustin Wahl arrived at Liberty as a freshman, in 2014. Slight and sandy-haired, with an earnest and eager affect, Wahl had been raised in South Dakota by evangelical parents. He grew up in a conservative environment that instilled in him the belief that Christians were hated in mainstream American culture, and that such disdain must be endured as a cost of being godly. In his teen-age years, Wahl was drawn to conservative pundits such as Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly, their tirades reminiscent of the church sermons he’d heard. “It was the moral language that got me excited,” he told me. “The culture is slipping away, the world hates us and wants to destroy our Christian beliefs, and we need to be ready and fight.”\n\nAt first, Wahl loved Liberty, and he idolized Jerry Falwell, Jr., as a “macho conservative archetype,” he told me. His first Halloween at Liberty, Wahl put on a dark suit and a striped tie, costuming himself as the familiar university figurehead. Later that night, he ran into Falwell himself, who was dressed as the Scottish insurgent Sir William Wallace. The pair took a photograph together under the fluorescent lights of a Chipotle.\n\nBut Wahl’s enthusiasm for Falwell didn’t last. In December of his sophomore year, at a semiweekly student assembly known as Convocation, Wahl witnessed one of Falwell’s most infamous speeches. A week earlier, a Pakistani-American couple had killed fourteen people in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Falwell announced that he had a concealed-carry permit and urged students to acquire one, too. “I’ve always thought that, if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in,” Falwell said. The students cheered. Wahl felt sick. The pundits he’d grown up listening to said things like this, but, by now, something had shifted in him. “That’s when I realized—you’re not talking about Muslims like Christians talk about Muslims,” Wahl said. “You don’t love them. You’re talking about hurting them.” He thought of two Muslim friends he’d made that summer and wondered whether they assumed he felt the same way.\n\nThe following month, Falwell endorsed Trump, bestowing an evangelical imprimatur on a campaign that was still being widely dismissed as a publicity stunt. For years, Christian conservatives had been disappointed by the candidates they helped to elect. Falwell cast Trump, still regarded by many believers as an unreconstructed sinner, as a pragmatic businessman who would honor his promises to evangelicals. “We don’t want to get fooled again,” Falwell said on Fox News. He didn’t care about Trump’s marriages or lewd remarks—only God could judge, he said. Still, in Virginia’s Republican primary, held five weeks after Falwell’s endorsement, only eight per cent of the campus precinct chose Trump. “I thought it was all very significant at the time, that we moderate evangelicals are gonna stand up and stop Trump,” Wahl said. “Which, of course, didn’t come anywhere close to happening.”\n\nWhen, that October, the leaked “Access Hollywood” tape revealed Trump bragging about assaulting women, Falwell defended him. Trump’s comments were “reprehensible,” Falwell said, but “we’re all sinners, every one of us.” Calling themselves Liberty United Against Trump, Wahl and a few friends published a statement, lambasting Trump as “a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil” and Falwell for defending Trump, “as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses, including our own.” The statement collected more than two thousand signatures. Falwell said that his critics were “young and still learning.” But, Wahl said, university administrators quietly pressured the organizers for a master list of students who signed the statement.\n\nFalwell told many people, including me, that he was proud to take up his father’s legacy on the national political stage. But, unlike his father, who kept a modicum of separation between the university and his political activism, Falwell simply annexed Liberty to Trump. Traditionally, Convocation had featured a mix of preachers, buttoned-down conservatives, and Christian celebrities, who spoke about their lives and faith. But, after the 2016 election, a parade of Trump-related figures took the stage: Corey Lewandowski, Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer, and Melania Trump. After Nigel Farage, the British right-wing figure who championed Brexit and campaigned for Trump, spoke at Convocation, Falwell started advocating “Vexit,” a scheme for the state’s most conservative counties to secede and join West Virginia.\n\nAfter hate groups staged a deadly march in nearby Charlottesville, members of the student government drafted an anodyne condemnation of white supremacy, only to be steered away from releasing it by a student who was acting as a liaison to the administration. A few days later, Falwell appeared on ABC News defending Trump’s description of the white supremacists as “very fine people.” “I think the American people have gotten sort of thin-skinned,” Falwell said. Later, he told me, of Trump, “He and I just resonated, because we were a lot alike. He told me I was the one, when nobody else would defend him, that he would call.”\n\nMany of the students fell under Trumpism’s thrall as it became increasingly prominent on campus; others tried to avoid it. “People who’ve grown up in evangelical environments feel a real twinge of hesitation when they think about criticizing leaders,” Calum Best, another alumnus, told me. “There’s a culture that, if you’re thinking about criticizing your leader, you should remember that God put that person there. Do you think you’re higher than God?”\n\nWhen the pandemic set in, Falwell initially scorned calls to suspend classes and shrugged off pandemic restrictions as an “attempt to get Trump.” Falwell’s behavior also appeared increasingly erratic, making some colleagues suspect that he was drunk during work meetings. Some faculty and staff thought that they recognized a pattern of self-destruction. “Every time he was granted free rein, he took more and more of it—almost like he was given the rope to hang himself,” Marybeth Baggett, an English professor who left Liberty in 2021, told me. (Marybeth is married to David Baggett, the philosophy professor who also left Liberty.) “He was putting a target on his back more and more and more, almost like he was daring someone to bring him down.”\n\nIn May, 2020, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced a statewide indoor mask mandate. Falwell responded by tweeting an image of the mask that he said he intended to wear, featuring a photo from Northam’s medical-school yearbook—which had surfaced the previous spring—of the governor in blackface, standing with a man dressed in a Ku Klux Klan costume. The tweet pitched the campus into tumult. At least four Black faculty and staff members resigned, and several of the school’s star Black athletes demanded transfers. Maina Mwaura, a Black minister who graduated from Liberty in the nineties, told me he was so upset by the tweet that he couldn’t sleep. Mwaura had briefly returned to Liberty the previous year to consult on Black enrollment. He had found the school whiter than it had been during his time as a student. These days, just four or five per cent of the campus population is Black, compared to twelve per cent when Mwaura was a student. Mwaura said that the issue is obscured by counting online students in published racial data. When he tried to talk about race with Liberty administrators, Mwaura noticed that they tended to be evasive. “What they really wanted, in my opinion, was assimilation,” he said. “They didn’t want diversity.”\n\nRacism is, in a real sense, Liberty’s original sin. The university has its roots in the Lynchburg Christian Academy—later renamed Liberty Christian Academy—which opened in 1967, as the movement to compel the integration of public schools was consuming the South. Hundreds of segregation academies opened, to cater to white families. The Lynchburg News reported that Falwell’s K-12 school “would admit whites only”; the school was entirely white for its first two years. (The Falwell family today denies that the school was ever a segregation academy.) Falwell, Sr., criticized interracial marriage and preached that integrated schools and neighborhoods subverted God’s will.\n\nAfter Jerry Falwell, Jr.,’s tweet, Mwaura e-mailed Jonathan to ask for his intervention. But Jonathan, Mwaura said, did not respond. “He could have moved heaven and earth,” Mwaura told me. “His voice really mattered. And there was nothing.” (Jonathan Falwell did not respond to requests for comment.) Mwaura then drafted a letter to Jerry Falwell, Jr., criticizing him for “incendiary rhetoric” and suggesting that he resign. The letter was co-signed by thirty-five prominent Black ministers and former Liberty student-athletes, and accumulated nearly forty thousand signatures online.\n\nFalwell’s career might well have survived the racial agitation. His personal misconduct, however, could not be countenanced by Liberty. In August, 2020, Falwell posted a photo from a costume party, held aboard a yacht, where the Falwells, along with their grown children and their spouses, dressed up as characters from the raunchy TV show “Trailer Park Boys.” Falwell was pictured with his pants undone, a drink in hand, and an arm around a woman, a Liberty employee, who worked as an assistant to his wife. The Liberty Way, this was not. The post ricocheted across the Internet. At that point, according to a lawsuit filed by the university against Falwell, his wife, Becki, approached the school’s executive committee to ask for help coaxing her husband into alcohol-abuse treatment. (The Falwells deny that Becki initiated this discussion, insisting that she was approached by a member of the committee.) Falwell then met with the committee and agreed to take a leave of absence. A month later, he checked into what he called a “detox center” in New England “just to keep the peace,” he said, but he was discharged after a few days, when doctors discovered that he had dangerously low levels of blood oxygen, because of blood clots on his lungs.\n\nFalwell was still on leave in late August when he published what he described as a “confession” in the Washington Examiner. In it, he wrote that Becki Falwell had carried on an affair with a young man, who then tried to blackmail the couple. If Falwell had seemed unwell, he explained, that was because he was trying “to respectfully unravel this ‘fatal attraction’ type situation to protect our family and the university.”\n\nThe next day, Reuters published the young man’s side of the story. Giancarlo Granda, a square-jawed Florida man, said that he’d been seduced by the couple when he was a twenty-year-old employee at a Miami hotel and drawn into a years-long entanglement that consisted of Granda having sex with Becki Falwell while her husband watched. In Granda’s view, the Falwells had preyed on him as “the ideal target for their sexual escapades.”\n\nThat was the final humiliation. Falwell resigned. “Free at last. Free at last,” he said in an interview. “Thank God Almighty, I am free at last.” And then he was gone.\n\nA day later, Liberty students filed into the football stadium for the fall semester’s first campus-wide worship service. Once they were assembled, the campus pastor, David Nasser, took the microphone and did something unexpected: he apologized unreservedly for Falwell’s conduct and encouraged the students to condemn his “shameful” behavior. “The embarrassment that’s been brought upon you as a Liberty student, and, more importantly, brought upon the name of Christ, is wrong,” Nasser said. “Your concerns, if you’re concerned, are valid. If you’re not concerned, you should be concerned.”\n\nNasser’s apology came off as a blunt break with the Falwell era, a denunciation all the more striking because of its messenger. An Iranian-born immigrant who converted to Christianity in his teens, Nasser has a searching gaze and gentle drawl that, according to his many critics, had long belied his role as Falwell’s enforcer, who shut down criticism from dissenting students. “You want to talk about a masterful spiritual gaslighter, look no further than David Nasser,” LeeQuan McLaurin, Liberty’s former diversity-retention director and a Liberty alumnus, told me. (Nasser, who no longer works at Liberty, declined to be interviewed.)\n\nNasser now cast himself as someone who could elevate the campus from the mire of Falwell’s misdeeds. He presented Jeh Johnson, an Obama Cabinet member who is Black and has family roots in Lynchburg, as one of the semester’s first Convocation speakers. There were other signs that Liberty was attempting to distance itself from the Falwell era. In October, 2020, lawyers for the university enlisted a forensic-accounting firm to investigate alleged financial transgressions under Falwell. A university spokesman did not respond to questions about the investigation, but Falwell claimed that the firm found “no material wrongdoing” after “hours and hours and hours” of examination.\n\nBy this point, Wahl had graduated and moved into a house with other Liberty alumni in Alexandria, Virginia; he started a job at a small media-monitoring firm. But he couldn’t bring himself to abandon the Liberty cause. Just before Falwell’s resignation, he and a few friends had founded Save71, a group advocating for reform at the school. (The name refers to the year Liberty was founded.)\n\nThe day after the group’s Web site went live, Wahl’s doorbell chimed. When he answered, the doorway and sidewalk were deserted; across the street, an unfamiliar man was getting into a car. When the stranger saw Wahl, he crossed back and said, “You’re doing good work.” He refused to give his name but offered Wahl helpful information about the inner workings of Liberty’s administration. Wahl began receiving regular, elaborately surreptitious calls about Liberty’s leadership from the source he called Doorbell. At the end of their conversations, Doorbell often suggested that they pray together. “It’s hard to describe how bizarre it is to sit on the phone listening to a guy pray for me when he doesn’t even trust me with his name,” Wahl said.\n\nWahl and his co-founders regarded Falwell’s ouster as an opportunity. A spirit of debate and reflection had gained momentum on campus as the scandal unfolded. Students were increasingly speaking about the need to prioritize faith over politics. They asked who, besides Falwell, was to blame for the university’s humiliation and to what extent his downfall reflected their collective flaws. In a Christian bubble, where deference to authority and a tendency to close ranks had long made it easy to repress criticism, this was a radical departure. Save71 would find itself at the center of this upheaval, becoming a vessel for a growing cast of students and staff who felt damaged by their time at Liberty.\n\nWhen Kennedi Williams, a point guard on the women’s basketball team, returned to campus in the fall of 2020, a few weeks after Falwell’s ouster, she had hoped to find students grappling with the broader racial issues roiling the country. The murder of George Floyd, in May, 2020, had ignited a summer of protests in cities across the country. But she was disturbed by the seemingly placid mood among her classmates. “Nothing was said about anything. They covered it with the word ‘chaos,’ ” Williams told me. “When we’d start praying they’d be, like, ‘There’s a lot of chaos going on.’ But they’d never say exactly what was going on.” Her teammate Dee Brown added, “They were scared to address the elephant in the room.” Some students criticized Black Lives Matter as an anti-family movement. Williams, Brown, and TreShaun Clark, a defensive end on the football team, decided to plan the school’s first Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nClark was the first to be confronted. The head football coach, Hugh Freeze, stormed over to him at practice. “He was really angry. He said he felt disrespected,” Clark recalled. (Freeze told me he was surprised and wounded that Clark had not first gone to him first to discuss his feelings on the issue. “It took me aback because I pride myself in communicating with our kids on everything,” he said.) In the following days, Williams, Brown, and Clark were questioned by the campus academic-affairs office and the Office of Equity and Inclusion. They were told to stop using the words “Black lives matter” and “protest”; “demonstration,” they recalled the administrators admonishing them, sounded less violent. They were asked to organize an academic discussion instead of a protest, or perhaps an athletes-only gathering in one of the sports halls. “They were just being very passive-aggressive,” Williams said. “They were just trying to water down the statement ‘Black lives matter.’ ”\n\nUndeterred, the students scheduled a demonstration in the shadow of Freedom Tower, a campus landmark with a twenty-five-bell carillon and the words of the Great Commission, “Go, and make disciples of all nations,” etched into the lobby. The night before, Williams got a phone call from the administration. They’d have to postpone the protest, she was told, because campus police didn’t feel comfortable protecting them. “This event will happen,” Williams posted on Instagram, “and we will not stop until it does.”\n\nWilliams, Brown, and Clark showed up the next day expecting a handful of students. Instead, they drew a crowd of about two hundred people. Students used a megaphone to denounce police violence. A white women’s-lacrosse coach explained white privilege. The organizers knelt on the ground and raised their fists. The mood, by all accounts, was constructive. “There was no backlash from students,” Brown said. “It was nothing but love.” The university issued a statement seeking to make clear that the protest was a “student-led and student-created initiative” and asserting that the protest was “not a Black Lives Matter event, although we believe black lives do indeed matter.”\n\nI first spoke to the organizers shortly after the demonstration. They were optimistic. Student-government leaders had taken them to dinner at Nasser’s house, they said. The school featured them in a video about racism. Nasser organized a Convocation to talk about race and scandalized campus conservatives by saying the words “Black lives matter.” But then something happened. Shortly after I called Freeze, the football coach, to confirm Clark’s story about the confrontation at practice, the athletes stopped replying to my messages. Williams then posted a disturbing image to her Instagram Stories: a drawing of a young Black woman wearing what at first appears to be a COVID face mask, but, upon closer inspection, are a pair of white hands covering her mouth. Tears trickle from the woman’s eye. Williams captioned the drawing: “Liberty University in a nutshell.”\n\nWahl sensed a familiar pattern: an outwardly friendly posture from the administration but private efforts to shut down dissent. He remembered his friends in the anti-Trump group being summoned to similar meetings designed to silence them. For all the talk of change, this seemed like more of the same.\n\nAnother test came in the form of the Falkirk Center, a campus think tank that Falwell had founded with Charlie Kirk, the leader of the national student group Turning Point USA. A community-college dropout from Chicago, Kirk became a hero to college conservatives during the Trump Presidency, rallying them against “totalitarianism” at their universities. At Liberty’s Falkirk Center, Kirk hosted fellows such as the far-right Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka and the conservative radio host Eric Metaxas, the author of the children’s books “Donald and the Fake News” and “Donald Builds the Wall.” “My main issue with Falkirk is their opposition to Christians who simply disagree with their politics,” Matthew Morris, then a freshman at Liberty, told me. “They’re dividing the church. They’re making politics their golden calf instead of Jesus.”\n\nIn December, 2020, Kirk presided over a Turning Point USA conference that included a gala at Mar-a-Lago. It was an extravagant, mask-free affair featuring Laura Ingraham, Roger Stone, and a money cannon that showered cash on the crowd. Scrolling through pictures of the event, Morris seethed but wondered what could be done. But then he noticed something: Liberty’s top student leaders—also perturbed—were taking to Twitter to criticize the Falkirk Center. “We have had dozens of conversations with students who are embarrassed to claim the name of our school due to the rhetoric that comes from this center,” Constance Schneider, the student-body president, tweeted. “There have been many instances where the center is not reflective upon the mission of our school to train champions for Christ.” Morris read Schneider’s tweet, then read it again, trying to internalize that he now had allies in some of the most powerful students on campus. Emboldened, he created an online petition calling for Liberty to shut down the Falkirk Center. “The mission for the Church is not to wage war on the ‘cultural battlefield,’ but to make disciples and build one another up,” he wrote. “The Falkirk Center constantly preaches the message that the church needs to defend Donald Trump at all costs and rescue western civilization. Falkirk is wrong.” Within a few days, the petition had four hundred signatures. By this point, Falwell had been gone for three months, and Trump had lost the election. It was clear that many students wanted a more thorough excavation of Liberty’s values.\n\nOn a bright Saturday in late 2020, Wahl opened his laptop in his bedroom, an airy space decorated with baseball caps and South Dakota license plates. Windows framed a view of winter-bare branches creaking in the wind. The house buzzed with the comings and goings of young people carrying tennis racquets, coffee mugs, and books.\n\nWahl logged on to Zoom and called a meeting of Save71 to order. Liberty had recently announced that the job held by Falwell would be divided between two new positions: a president tasked with bureaucratic management and a chancellor to serve as Liberty’s spiritual leader. “We’re not happy with this split, are we, as a group?” Alexandra Green, a graduate student at Yale Divinity School, asked. “Coming on the heels of a scandal like this, it makes it very suspect.” Wahl agreed, suggesting that Liberty’s interim president, Jerry Prevo, wanted “to protect the financial side without having to take ethics into account.” The group briefly discussed a campaign against the Falkirk Center, but the former students worried that it might appear too partisan. It would be smarter, they agreed, to focus on issues of personal morality. The board had decided to conduct an investigation into the finances but not the Falwells’ alleged sexual misconduct or long-standing rumors that campus-sexual-assault victims were being silenced. “I don’t know what you say to a bunch of students who are, like, ‘I can’t believe I’m going to a school where sexual assault isn’t taken seriously,’ ” Green said. Wahl nodded, reasoning that tackling the sexual-assault issue would make it easier to take on the Falkirk Center.\n\nThe faces stared out from Wahl’s laptop screen—a constellation of bright young alumni carrying on a struggle that they’d begun in college. It seemed a peculiarly backward-looking endeavor for people with so much possibility before them. Wahl insisted that he’d made peace with his educational pedigree. As far as he was concerned, his years at the school had provided a kind of hands-on moral education. “I went to Liberty in the Trump era. I can’t go back and un-go to college,” he said. “Its name is inseparably associated with these people who don’t represent what I believe at all, but that shaped me in a way that I wouldn’t have been shaped if I’d gone to a more normal school.”\n\nThe Falwells are scornful of Save71, referring to its members as “Liberty-haters.” But it seemed improbable to me that a group of far-flung, Gen Z Christians would keep at this task of rehabilitating their former college out of hate or spite. They could, after all, simply drop the whole mess and head off into the rest of their lives. The only rational explanation, it seemed to me, was love—a kind of frustrated but profound belief that Liberty was just a few reforms away from an unrealized goodness.\n\nLast spring, I drove out to the Falwells’ farmhouse, in the rolling hills outside Lynchburg. There are two old churches on the five-hundred-acre property, a creek tumbling through hardwood forest, and several graveyards where Confederate soldiers are buried. Falwell came out to the porch to greet me, golden retrievers cavorting at his legs. He looked older and more ponderous than he had the year before. His figure was bloated, and his graying hair had grown so long it was starting to curl around his neck. He moved slowly and struggled to breathe. He told me about the clots in his lungs, and said he was on blood thinners.\n\nThe Falwells hadn’t been doing much. They drove to town for breakfast and brought home boxed meals for lunch and dinner. “It’s hard to cook just for the two of us,” Falwell explained. Sometimes they picked up their granddaughter from preschool. Sometimes Falwell took out his bulldozer to cut trails. They talked on the phone, watched television, and monitored Falwell’s blood-oxygen levels on an oximeter that Becki bought at T. J. Maxx. They were depressed, she told me.\n\nFalwell wanted people to know about his physical condition; he wielded it like an alibi. “I didn’t have the strength to go on TV and defend myself,” Falwell said, of Granda’s accusations. “He was telling a lot of lies about me and a lot of half-truths about Becki, and I just didn’t have any strength to fight.” The Falwells led me into a large, bright kitchen, with windows opening onto gently sloping lawns. One of the couple’s two sons, Wesley, showed up, accompanied by his wife and their small daughter dressed in a princess gown and plastic jewelry. “They came over to say hey to you,” Jerry Falwell, Jr., explained. But the young family didn’t seem the least bit eager to say hey—or anything else—to me. “Got anything to say, Wes?” Falwell asked at one point. “Nope,” his son replied.\n\nSitting in the Falwell kitchen, I started to ask Falwell about some of the contradictions in his story. If Granda was trying to extort money from the Falwells, why, I wondered, had they kept spending time with him? Falwell abruptly announced that he was done talking about it. “The people who want to believe me are going to believe me,” he said, “and the people who don’t want to believe me are not going to believe me.” At the other end of the kitchen island, Becki Falwell chattered nervously, detailing the apologies she’d offered for her indiscretion with Granda. She’d apologized to her husband and to her three children. She’d written a letter apologizing to the board at Liberty.\n\nWesley stood just behind her, leaning against the counter, listening. Now, as Becki Falwell spoke, he muttered something I couldn’t hear. His parents turned toward me expectantly. “Excuse me?” I said. “Family didn’t need an apology,” he repeated grimly, lifting his chin.\n\nJerry Falwell, Jr., has asked for forgiveness, but he has never, to my knowledge, apologized for his behavior. He is not sorry for anything, he told me when we met at the farm. He was thinking about what to do next. He seemed adrift, looking around his own house as if he was trying to figure out how he got there. “Like my dad used to say in the sermon—” Falwell began, and I waited for a soliloquy on atonement or grace. It didn’t come. Falwell continued, “He’d say, ‘Don’t get mad if people are lying about you; just be glad they don’t know the truth.’ ”\n\nHalfway through the spring semester, Liberty’s identity, after Falwell, seemed to be acquiring shape. In March, the university announced that it had severed ties with Charlie Kirk; the campus think tank he’d co-founded was renamed the Standing for Freedom Center. The following month, David Nasser resigned as campus pastor and was replaced by Jonathan Falwell. (Many people I spoke with at Liberty believe this is a transitional role that will prepare Jonathan Falwell to become chancellor.) To Mwaura, Nasser’s departure underscored Liberty’s resistance to self-examination on race; this impression was amplified when the acting chairman of the board of trustees, Allen McFarland, a Black pastor, was ousted in favor of a conservative white preacher from Texas.\n\nIt was Easter when the administration got around to Jerry Falwell, Jr.,’s family. Prevo, the interim president, called Falwell’s eldest son, Jerry Falwell III, known as Trey, on Good Friday. Trey Falwell had worked closely with his father for years and had been regarded as the heir apparent. Even after his father’s disgrace, he’d held on to his job as vice-president of operations. Now Prevo offered Trey the option of resigning. He declined. On Easter Monday, the Falwells told me, Prevo fired him.\n\nThen, in April, the university sued Falwell for more than forty million dollars in damages. The lawsuit, full of embarrassing personal details, accused Falwell of withholding information from the board, damaging the school’s reputation, and refusing to return university property. (Falwell denies wrongdoing.) I reached the Falwells the day the lawsuit went public. Becki Falwell was weeping. “It’s horrible,” she said. “I’m throwing up. I don’t want to shower. And to see them treat my son like that.” Falwell was more stoic. “I’m fine. I know who I’m dealing with and how amateurish they are,” he said. “They’re hurting the school more by attacking me than I ever could have hurt the school.”\n\nFor Morris and Wahl, however, all of this was a little too pat. They were troubled that Prevo seemed to be carrying on many of Falwell’s policies. Jerry Vines, the former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, remained on the board, despite revelations from a Houston Chronicle investigation that he had shamed and silenced at least one victim of sexual assault. (Vines did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.) “My mind-set now is that Charlie Kirk is just part of the problem, just like Falwell, Jr., is just part of the problem,” Morris told me. “You gotta get rid of all the weeds, you know?” There was no evidence of the deeper soul-searching that many at Liberty had hoped to witness. The spectacle of the board and Falwell attacking one another, Wahl said, “felt like watching gang warfare. You’re not really rooting for one side or the other.”\n\nEven Marybeth Baggett, the English professor and a staunch critic of Falwell, thought that the longtime president had been used by Liberty as a scapegoat. “It almost seems like they’re just bracketing Falwell off, laying all the sin on him,” she said. “Like, ‘He’s the one who’s problematic.’ ” That’s not to say that Baggett was sympathetic to Falwell. “He has to do a confession and a repentance, but he seems absolutely intent on not doing that,” she said. “He only wants to say, ‘No, this was my wife who did this. I am absolutely innocent.’ ” Hearing this, Baggett’s husband, the author and theology professor David Baggett, interjected. “In pockets of the evangelical world today, there’s this idea of, ‘Well, of course we sin, but God’s grace is enough, so you should forgive me, too,’ ” he said. “Well, yes, but there’s this intermediary step according to Christian theology—which is repentance.” To demand redemption without admitting to your missteps, David Baggett said, was what the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer called “cheap grace.”\n\nI spoke with the Falwells again this winter. Becki Falwell had given an interview to Gabriel Sherman, a writer for Vanity Fair, in which she’d accused Granda of sexual assault. This was new to me, although I’d interviewed the Falwells on multiple occasions, over many hours. (Granda forcefully denied the assault when I asked him about it. Sherman is now working on a scripted TV series about Falwell’s rise and fall. Falwell told me that he is coöperating with Sherman on the project but is not involved in any formal capacity.) Once again, the couple put me on speakerphone. They were preoccupied with the tell-all book and documentary expected from Granda in coming months, and Falwell said they’d thought that perhaps news of his wife’s sexual-assault allegation might “kill his book.” “I wanted us to be able to tell the story first,” he said. “I know, when he tells it, it’s gonna be full of lies.”\n\nLater that day, Becki Falwell called. She was driving to the hairdresser’s, she said, and she wanted to talk to me without Jerry listening in. She faltered, saying she wasn’t sure whether she was on or off the record, but mostly she wanted to express how sorry she was. She was sorry for what she’d done to her family, to Liberty, to everyone. She had ruined everything, she said. “If you ask me to name a friend, I don’t know what to say,” she began to weep. “If something good happens, I don’t know who to call.”\n\nIt was the same apology, almost to a word, that she’d recited ten months earlier in her kitchen, except she didn’t seem to remember that. Just before we got off the phone, she said, “You’ll have to be my friend now.” Later that day, she texted to say that she was afraid she wasn’t Granda’s only victim. (Granda vehemently denies this, too.)\n\nIn order to watch their youngest daughter, Caroline, graduate from the university next month, the Falwells have agreed to abide by a strict set of rules governing their return to campus, Becki Falwell told me. Under the agreement, she said, the couple may only walk straight from the parking lot to their seats in the stadium and then return to the parking lot once the ceremonies are finished. They are not allowed to post any images from campus on social media, she said, not even family pictures snapped at the graduation.\n\nI met Wahl recently, too. He’d grown a beard and got a new job, but he was still at the helm of Save71. I felt like I’d watched Wahl become an adult, with new certitude. Some of his original collaborators had drifted away, distracted by the demands of their post-college lives, but they’d been replaced by more recent alumni with new energy. New whistle-blowers at Liberty kept coming forward for the group to rally around. In March, 2021, two L.G.B.T.Q. Liberty alumni joined a class-action lawsuit against the Department of Education, saying that campus religious leaders had violated Title IX regulations by subjecting them to conversion therapy. Around the same time, a dozen former students and staff members filed a lawsuit alleging that Liberty had deliberately created an environment in which rape and sexual assault were likely to occur. According to the lawsuit, students were discouraged from reporting assaults, because, instead of being taken seriously or helped, they were disciplined for violating Liberty’s honor code. The suit contained shocking allegations, including those by a young woman who said that, when she tried to report a rape, “Liberty University’s Student Conduct Office gave her no opportunity to do so and, instead, forced her to sit with her rapist and apologize to her roommates for her violation of the Liberty Way.” (In a statement, Prevo, the university’s president, called the allegations “deeply troubling, if they turn out to be true” and pledged to investigate the claims and “make them right, if they turn out to be true.”)"
