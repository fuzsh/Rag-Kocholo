        "text": "At Bank of the James, we focus on relationships first. By getting to know you, we’re able to find solutions that let you meet your goals and fulfill your dreams. We’re creative and understanding, plus we have the flexibility to customize loans and provide financial solutions that suit your situation. Bank of the James was founded in 1999 as we watched many of our local banks being taken over by large corporate banks and institutions. We saw the level of service and quality of banking available to our community erode as decisions were being made in other states, and customer service was defined by an automated message at the other end of a toll-free number.\n\nToday, almost 25 years later, we’re proud to say that we are still here as your premiere regional financial institution, still providing the highest standard of personal service and community support, and still partnering with you…for good.\n\nServing Our Communities In Virginia For Over 20+ Years\n\nWe’re with you. From our very start, Bank of the James has been firmly committed to investing in the communities we serve. Across our region, we are proud to support and sponsor over 250 civic organizations, non-profits, and community events. While we support a diverse array of activities, we focus our giving in the areas of youth enrichment and education, health and human services as well as arts and culture. In addition, we actively seek out opportunities that will strengthen our underserved friends and neighbors.\n\nWe’re with you, partnering for good.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO SERVE"
