        "text": "Funeral arrangements are being handled by DeBor Funeral Home with a viewing on Monday from 1-8pm at DeBor funeral Home on Brookline Blvd. Divine Liturgy on Tuesday at 11am at Our Lady of Victory on Tropical Ave.\n\nWZUM will have other special programs about Tony and his impactful life and career in the days ahead. But for now, mostly music and a few stories.\n\nTony was a fixture on the radio airwaves in Pittsburgh and across the nation for decades, but much of his career was in formats other than jazz. He was also an actor and a restaurateur.\n\nEarly on, out of Duquesne University, Tony went to New York to pursue an acting career, venturing out with fellow Pittsburgh native, Chuck Grodin. But he came back home to Pittsburgh, and his bride-to-be, Liz (who passed less than a month ago, December 10).\n\nHis early start in radio came at WDUQ as a student in the 1950’s, when jazz, at first, wasn’t allowed to be programmed.\n\nOther radio stops included WAZZ, WTAE (when Al “Jazzbeau” Collins was there, too), WKPA, WYDD, and WAMO. Plus, time on TV and in area theater, including summer stock, the Pittsburgh Playhouse and the Pittsburgh Children’s theater.\n\nYears later, in 1987, he returned to WDUQ with his “Nightside” program, drawing large, appreciative and supportive audiences. Around that same time, he led the creation of the Pittsburgh Jazz Society, which became the perfect synergy to help sustain a jazz scene.\n\nHundreds of local and national artists came to find Tony, WDUQ and Pittsburgh as “must go” destinations. Combined with his volunteer work with the Pittsburgh Jazz Society, a remarkable synergy was born.\n\nOn the show, we share early sounds of Tony from WYDD in 1969, including a wonderful tune by Pittsburgh native Ron Anthony, “It’s Always 4am,” performed by Bobbi Boyle.\n\nAlso, Tony favorites like “Hymn to Friday” by Oscar Brown, Jr; “Night LIghts” by Gerry Mulligan and the theme (anthem, really!), “For Lena and Lennie” by Quincy Jones.\n\nWe’ll also share sounds from other parts of Tony’s career, and music from some of his favorites - Shirley Horn, Frank Sinatra, Mark Murphy, Stanley Turrentine, Milt Jackson, Ray Brown and Gene Ludwig.\n\nAfter the sale of WDUQ in 2011, Tony joined the team of the Pittsburgh Jazz Channel, to keep those sounds and that community going. First online, then through 88.1 FM, AM 1550, and, finally, 101.1 FM in Pittsburgh.\n\nWe will have more on Tony Mowod’s career and legacy at www.wzum.org and on the air in the days ahead. The rich tradition of jazz he shepherded for Pittsburgh will continue for years and years to come. Tony had recorded programs in advance for WZUM, and we will continue airing them for the near future.\n\nOur deep condolences to Tony’s family and legion of friends. His wife, Liz, proceeded Tony in death on December 10, 2020.\n\nFuneral arrangements are being handled by DeBor Funeral Home in Brookline."
