Jacques Maritain (b. November 18, 1882, Paris; d. April 28, 1973 Toulouse) was a noted Christian humanist philosopher and convert to Roman Catholicism. Maritain, raised Protestant, and his Jewish wife, Raissa Oumansov, converted jointly in 1906, two years after their marriage in 1904. Later, Maritain studied St. Thomas Aquinas, on whom, along with Aristotle, much of his own philosophy was based. He then taught at the Institut Catholique from 1914-1939, and annually at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, University of St. Michael’s College in Toronto from 1933-1938. He was lecturing in the United States in 1940 when France fell to the Nazis; he stayed in America for the duration of the war, teaching at Princeton (1941-1942) and Columbia (1941-1944) as well as the New School, which became the temporary home to the École Libre des Hautes Études, in which he was deeply involved. Afterwards, he served as French Ambassador to the Vatican from 1945 to 1948, appointed to the post by Charles DeGaulle. He again taught philosophy at Princeton from 1948 to 1952, and then retired. After his wife’s death in 1960, Maritain lived in a religious community in Toulouse, the Dominican Les Petits Freres de Jesus, until his own death in 1973.
