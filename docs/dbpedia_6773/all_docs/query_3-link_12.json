        "text": "Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, was a preeminent interpreter of the thought of Thomas Aquinas and author of more than fifty books in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy. A giant in his field, he combined his Catholic faith and wide-ranging intellect to address contemporary issues and the many facets of the human experience.\n\nIn Jacques Maritain: An Intellectual Profile, Jude P. Dougherty shares his lifetime interest in and study of Maritain with readers. He offers the most complete introduction to Maritain yet to be published, highlighting Maritain's many contributions to philosophy. Throughout, the reader gains a clear sense of Maritain the man, his relationships with other notable figures of his time, and his engagement in many of the debates of the twentieth century.\n\nDougherty's essays offer an appreciation of the perennial value of Maritain's intellect. He follows Maritain's philosophical journey from his early critique on the metaphysics of Henri Bergson to the publication of L'Eglise du Christ in 1973. Accessible to readers new to Maritain's work and to the Thomistic tradition, the book will be welcomed by seasoned scholars as well.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nJude P. Dougherty, Dean Emeritus of the School of Philosophy at The Catholic University of America, is author of The Logic of Religion, and Western Creed, Western Identity, editor of the Review of Metaphysics, and general editor of the Studies in Philosophy and the History of Philosophy series published by CUA Press.\n\nPRAISE FOR THE BOOK:\n\n\"Dougherty's book presents a series of seven themes in Maritain's broad corpus concerning philosophy of science, metaphysics, aesthetics, political philosophy, Church and state, and ecclesiology. Each chapter is sharply focused and provides an incisive account of Maritain's treatment of the problem.... Any reader who wishes to see the sweep of his philosophy and to get a feel for the exciting advances made by Maritain in the fields mentioned above can do not better than to read Dougherty's book.\"—John Hittinger, Catholic Historical Review\n\n\"Dougherty captures concisely the depth of Maritain's philosophy in a series of eight essays.... [A] fine introduction to Maritain's most salient themes....\"—Daniel P. Sheridan, Catholic Books Review\n\n\"Dougherty has done a remarkable job of summarizing Maritain's thought in relation to his central theme—the openness of the soul to being and to God, who is Being Itself. Dougherty's book is, among other things, an excellent introduction to Maritain for those who are unfamiliar with his thought.\"—George A. Kendall, The Wanderer\n\n\"Given the growing stature of Maritain and Dougherty's thoughtful appreciation, this little book is essential to all Catholic college libraries.\"—Daniel Boice, Catholic Library World\n\n\"A gem. While small in size, it is large in worth, and sparkles every bit as much...In this slim volume of substantial scholarship Jude Dougherty succeeds admirably in forging a unified intellectual profile of a polymath whose mind was never at rest.\"- Glenn Statile, The Maritain Notebook\n\n\"While there are several who have produced valuable monographs on aspects of the writing of Maritain, it takes something of the range of the Master himself to provide a sense of the breadth and depth of Maritain's work. In this intellectual portrait, Jude Dougherty establishes his credentials in the second and more demanding category. Furthermore, he has the wit to be brief as well as comprehensive. From the state of the Church, through the difficult issue of individuation and the relation of philosophy and science, aesthetics and political philosophy, Dougherty moves with"
