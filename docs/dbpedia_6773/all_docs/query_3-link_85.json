Dewey is concerned with communication and the conditions of growth of the child from every point of view. He was very opposed to those who see education as preparation for something else: he focused on what he saw as the existential needs of the student. Some of Dewey’s views are contrasted with those of Jacques Maritain, another philosopher, who wrote about the same issues from a different point of view.",
