        "text": "Citation preview\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic\n\nJACQUES MARITAIN AND THE FRENCH CATHOLIC INTELLECTUALS Bernard Doering Jacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals covers seventy years of Maritain’s life—from his conversion to Catholicism in 1905 to his death in 1973—and it follows the development of his ideas in response to the crucial social and political events of this century. In discussing his tenuous affiliation with and later repudiation of the right-wing, monarchist Action Frangaise in the 1920s, sympathy and support for the victims of the Spanish Civil War, defense of the Jews against the anti-Semitic attacks in the 30s and 40s, and support of the Free French during the Second World War, it shows Maritain to be one for whom a commitment to Catholicism went hand in hand with a commitment to justice that led him to resist the absolutist, authoritarian tendencies of both the left and the right. Jacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals is more than the intellectual biography of one man, however; it presents a collective biography of an age. The Cercle d’Etudes Thomistes that met regularly at the Maritains’ home at Meudon brought together some of the leading Catholic intellectuals in France, including Mauriac, Cocteau, Merleau-Ponty, Massignon, Simon, and Mounier. This group of highly individualistic thinkers —and the other Catholic intellectuals connected with them—were faced with the double task of making sense of their place within Catholicism while at the same time determining their response as Catholics to the political currents engulfing Europe.\n\nContinued on back flap\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals BERNARD E.

Like our lives, our books are influenced by so many persons that it is impossible for an author to recall all those who participated either directly or indirectly in the making of a book. It would be futile for me to try to express my gratitude to each one who, in the course of a conversation or a letter, by hints about avenues of research, by suggested corrections, or simply by gracious encouragement, has contributed to the writing of this book. However, I would like to express my appreciation to a number of people in a very particular way. First to Wallace Fowlie, who suggested the topic of the book and has shown continued interest in my work. To the late Professor Joseph Evans, Director of the Maritain Center at the University of Notre Dame when I began working on this study, for generously making available whatever I needed from the Maritain Center for my research and for countless other acts of assistance. To the trustees of the Maritain Archives: the late Brother Heinz Schmitz, Professor Olivier Lacombe and Madame Antoinette Grunelius, for permitting me to consult certain documents prior to the date they were to be made public. I am particularly grateful to Madame Grunelius for the long hours she spent searching out the documents I needed, and above all for the long hours of conversation and her generous and cordial hospitality which made my stay at the Centre d'Etudes Jacques et Rai’ssa Maritain so fruitful and so pleasant. I am most grateful, too, to Brother Jean-Marie Allion, a Little Brother from Toulouse, who was working at the Maritain Archives in Kolbsheim during the summer of 1981 and who acted as my personal “amanuensis,\" for giving so generously of his time reading letters to select those that would interest me, copying documents ix\n\nX\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nI needed and typing legible copies of letters written in almost indecipherable script. I am also most grateful to Henry Bars for our long and helpful conversations, and above all for his unselfishly putting at my total disposition unpublished manuscripts of his own on topics I was treating in my book. Finally, I express my appreciation to Anthony O. Simon for his countless acts of kindness and encouragement, and in particular for having given me complete access to the correspondence between his father, Yves R. Simon, and Jacques Maritain, which, with Deba P. Patnaik, he is presently preparing for publication. All quotations from the Maritain/ Simon correspondence are from this collection. Copies of the Maritain/Simon letters can be found at the Maritain Center of the University of Notre Dame and at the Maritain Archives in Kolbsheim, France. Unless otherwise indicated, the English translations of all French texts are my own.\n\nIntroduction\n\nstriking phenomena of twentieth-century French letters is the Catholic Literary Revival, which was the more remarkable for the fact that it began from almost nothing. Considering the situation in France in the early 1880s, one cannot avoid the impression that, in all its long history, the Church had scarcely ever found itself in such desperate straits. Positivism reigned supreme, often under the form of an ambitious and complacent scientism which saw no need for the supernatural and which therefore felt called to undermine the structure of traditional metaphysics and, consequently, of CathoONE OF THE MOST\n\nlic theology. The only metaphysicians who enjoyed any acceptability were those who turned to a system of Kantian idealism which, to many minds, appeared sufficient to found a moral system without God and to make religion useless. For anything that resembled a religious climate, one had to turn to Renan, whose memories of seminary life and ecclesiastical vocabulary gave way with age to a skeptical laicism or to an aging Victor Hugo, who in countless alexandrins constructed a jumbled metaphysical system in which the name of God appeared, to be sure, but certainly not the traditional Christian God of the Bible and even less, of Calvary. In the literary world the spirit of positivism led, on one hand, in the tradition of Parnasse, to a kind of decorative paganism and voluptuous erudition which tended to describe with subtlety and perfection a beautiful object without ever looking for its soul. On the other hand, in the tradition of Medan, it led to an epic but vulgar naturalism. In the political order, the adamant antirepublicanism of Popes Pius IX and Pius X allied the Church with the antidemocratic forces of reaction. The papal condemnation of Lammenais, Lacordaire, Montalembert, Lord Acton and the Catholic liberal 1\n\n2\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\npolitical movement Sillon stiffled any attempts to create a rapprochement between the Church and contemporary politics. What few Catholic literary figures there were exercised little influence. Veuillot and Hello, though respected, were not read outside the Catholic circle. Few readers were convinced by the Baudelarean religious dandyism of Barbey d'Aurevilly and Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, and particularly not the Church. The numerous pious brochures and books of Sulpician spirituality or frantic apologetics circulated only in the ecclesiastical world and among the dwindling public of believers. They convinced few outside the fold, for they were read almost exclusively by those who were already convinced. After the Syllabus of Errors (1864) and the proclamations of the Immaculate Conception (1854) and Papal Infallibility (1870), the \"intellectual world\" expected little of relevance from the Catholic Church. The Church was in a state of siege, and within the Catholic ghetto a kind of intellectual and spiritual inbreeding was taking its toll. It was into such a world that Jacques Maritain was born. The prestige of Christian letters was at perhaps its lowest point. But this was at the lowest point of a curve which was soon to turn up and rise steadily, until, toward the middle of the twentieth century, Catholic letters attained a summit of prestige unparalleled for several centuries. Jacques Maritain was born in Paris on November 18, 1882, the son of Paul Maritain, a prosperous lawyer, and Genevieve Favre, the daughter of Jules Favre, one of the founding fathers of the Third French Republic. Maritain was reared by his mother in an atmosphere of liberal Protestantism and humanitarian rationalism. He received his early formal education at the Lycee Henri IV, where he became the close friend of Ernest Psichari, grandson of Ernest Renan. The two young men shared the same passion for the world of ideas and the same humanitarian ideals which had made the Renans and the Favres two of the most representative of the great intellectual and political families of liberal and republican France. Maritain continued his studies as a student of natural science at the Sorbonne. After he received a licence en philosophie there, he met his future wife, Raissa Oumansoff, a brilliant young science student of Russian-Jewish origin, with whom he shared his despair at being unable to find answers to questions about the meaning of life and the capacity of the human intellect to arrive at truth. After he met Peguy in 1901 he devoted considerable time\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nto proofreading and other odd jobs at Peguy s socialist bookshop and office of the Cahiers de la Quinzaine. Disillusioned with the relativism and scientism of their masters at the Sorbonne, he and Raissa, upon the invitation and urging of Peguy, attended the courses of Henri Bergson at the College de France. Bergson threw open the doors of their intellectual prison and liberated in them \"the sense of the absolute.\" The Maritains met Leon Bloy in 1905. Overwhelmed by the simplicity and purity of Bloy s faith, by his apocalyptic vision of the world and by his uncompromising fidelity to the vocation to sainthood, they began to study Catholicism and were received into the Church in 1906. After passing his agregation de philosophic at the Sorbonne, Maritain became interested in biology. He and his wife spent 1907 and 1908 in Heidelberg, where he studied under Hans Driesch. Upon returning to France, he undertook the tedious work of editing the Dictionnaire de la vie pratique for the publisher Hachette because he needed money, and he felt he would have to sacrifice his intellectual independence if he accepted a position in one of the state schools. Maritain began his teaching career at the College Stanislas in 1912 and was appointed professor of philosophy at the Institut Catholique just before the First World War. Encouraged by his spiritual director, Father Humbert Clerissac, Maritain began a tenuous but much publicized association with Action Frangaise and collaboration with Henri Massis on La Revue Universelle, which lasted until the papal condemnation of Action Frangaise in 1927. Shortly after the war the Maritains moved to Meudon, where they held (in their home) the famous weekly reunions of the Cercle d'Etudes Thomistes (Thomistic Studies group), which were frequented not only by Catholic intellectuals from France but by intellectuals of many religious persuasions from all over the world. It was here that the defense of the papal condemnation of Action Frangaise was organized, that a project was elaborated with Emmanuel Mounier which later became the magazine Esprit, that many of the manifestos for justice and peace were drawn up during the troubled thirties, that plans were made to aid the refugees of the Spanish Civil War. Maritain had always been strongly inclined toward a very literal kind of evangelism and from his student days had manifested passionate love for the poor and the humble who thirst after justice. During these years at Meudon, Maritain continued\n\n4\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nhis career as a speculative philosopher, but more and more he turned his pen to the problems posed by the world and the Church. His uncompromising application of the principles of the Gospels to questions of social and political justice gained him bitter enemies as well as enthusiastic followers. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Maritain was on a lecture tour in the United States and Canada, where he had given courses annually since 1933. During the war he lived in Greenwich Village and his apartment became a meeting place for American intellectuals and artists and for those exiled from Europe. He played an important role in founding the Ecole Libre des Hautes Etudes, of which he later became president. Without prejudice to his numerous lectures at American universities, he devoted himself to the rescue and relief of victims of the Nazi racist persecutions, to weekly broadcasts to the Free French and to the defense of democratic institutions. These were probably the busiest years of Maritain's life. After refusing General de Gaulle’s offer, near the end of the war, of a position on the Comite National de la France Libre, he agreed, after the war, to serve as French ambassador to the Vatican from 1945 to 1948. In 1947, as head of the French delegation to the General Conference of UNESCO in Mexico City, Maritain was elected president of the conference and delivered the opening address. At the end of his term as ambassador to the Vatican, Maritain accepted the post of professor emeritus at Princeton University, where he taught moral philosophy according to the tradition of St. Thomas Aquinas. In 1951 he was offered a chair at the College de France, one of the greatest academic honors that can be received in France. However, he was reluctant to begin another career at the age of sixty-nine, and felt bound to continue his work in the United States. Early in 1961 Maritain returned to France, after the death of his wife, where, except for his annual visits to the Grunelius family (in whose home his papers and documents were stored), he passed his last years in retirement and seclusion in the monastery of the Little Brothers of Jesus of Charles de Foucauld at Toulouse, publishing the journal of his wife Raissa and those books he’d had no time to complete during his busy sojourn in America. In 1965 he came from his retirement to be signally honored at the close of the Second Vatican Council as the world's outstanding Catholic intellectual.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nWhen Maritain began his literary career in 1914, the Catholic Renascence was already under way, and by the time Maritain’s first book appeared, Barres and Bourget had set the traditional and nationalist tone of the early revival. Claudel had already established himself as a poet and a playwright. Peguy, with his first Jeanne d’Arc and the founding of Cahiers de la Quinzaine, and Bloy, with his apocalyptic fulminations, had already set the tone for another current in the revival, a current more open to contemporary political and social developments. But with the publication of Art et scolastique in 1920, Maritain became a central figure in the Catholic Literary Revival. His influence extended far beyond his professional field of philosophy. To the Cercle d'Etudes Thomistes held in his home in Meudon came philosophers, theologians (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox and Jewish), specialists in Oriental studies, artists, novelists, playwrights, poets, musicians, journalists, politicians. A study of his influence, which extended in many directions, must necessarily be limited in this book, whose object is to determine the extent of Maritain s political debt to certain French literary figures and his influence on the political and social thinking of others during the turbulent years from 1920 to 1970, and thus to assess his role in the Catholic Literary Renascence and in the renewal of the Catholic Church that culminated in the Second Vatican Council. The ecrivain engage is a perennial phenomenon of French letters. Hugo, Lamartine and Vigny, for example, were as politically and socially involved in their period as any writer during World War II and after. French literary figures were immersed in the political and social turmoil during the difficult years between 1920 and 1970, the major years of Maritain's political and social engagement, but what has not been examined is Maritain’s relation to other French literary figures over the political issues of these years. References concerning Maritain's influence in such matters abound in the journals, memoirs and political writings in the periodicals and newspapers of the day, but no one as yet has compiled and organized this material to evaluate Maritain's role in changing the political and social orientation of the Catholic Literary Renascence, which is the object of this study.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Mari tain\n\nTHE \"PEACE AND EQUILIBRIUM\" which followed upon Jacques Mari-\n\ntain's conversion to the Catholic faith were shattered in 1926 by the crisis of Action Frangaise. With the possible exception of his conversion, no event proved more important in determining the course of Maritain's life. Action Frangaise, a traditionalist and monarchist movement, led by Charles Maurras and supported by many Catholics of conservative background, was condemned in December 1926 by Pius XI for its political positivism and its tendency to make religion subservient to politics. This crisis divided France almost as deeply as did the Dreyfus case at the turn of the century, and in many respects the same divisions were later renewed over the Spanish Civil War and the Vichy government. Maritain's political activities after his conversion had been limited to intermittent expressions of sympathy for the victims of political and social injustice and to an occasional forceful insistence that evangelical renewal of the principles of Christianity was the sine qua non for the reestablishment of order and peace in society. His preoccupations were purely speculative and religious, and he seems to have had no intention of soiling his hands in sordid partisan politics. Through the crisis of 1926, however, he came to realize how impossible it is for a philosopher worthy of his calling to hold himself completely aloof from life in the lofty towers of speculation. Because political activity is directly dependent upon philosophical tenets, the philosopher has to become \"engaged,\" at least to the extent of judging and interpreting political events and of suggesting guiding principles of action. So Maritain turned from the speculative world of absolutes and abstractions, in which he moved with grace and freedom, to the contingent world of human anguish, applying the abstract prin6\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n7\n\nciples of his thought to the practical solution of political and social problems. Without the crisis of 1926, we would probably never have seen such outstanding contributions to political and social thought as Primaute du spirituel, Humanisme integral, Du regime temporel et de la liberte, Christianisme et democratie, La Personne et le bien commun, and Man and the State. His break with Action Frangaise was to cost him dearly in loss of friends, bitter criticism and even violent abuse; but, charting his course in his Lettre sur Vindependance, he made his way carefully between the pitfalls of the right and the left to a position of recognized prominence in both Europe and America. It is difficult to explain, or even understand, how Maritain let himself be associated with Action Frangaise. His family background would seem to have made him congenitally incompatible with the movement. He was the grandson of Jules Favre, one of the founders of the Third Republic; his mother was Genevieve Favre, “la grande republicaine,\" a very close friend of Peguy, as was Maritain himself. He married a Russian Jewess, which must have rankled the anti-Semitic tendencies of Maurras and his followers — tendencies which must have given Maritain himself second thoughts about his connections with the group. He was the godson of Leon Bloy, a defender of the Jews, whom one can scarcely imagine relishing Maurras and his kind. Maritain had been an ardent socialist in his youth,1 and never, even during the days when he was erroneously considered the official “philosopher of Action Frangaise,\" did he lose his profound sympathy for the laboring classes or his zeal for social justice. The names of writers, artists and musicians whose works he admired (Bloy, Cocteau, Rouault, Chagall, Severini, Satie and Lourie, for example) indicate how little appreciation he had for the neoclassicism of the Ecole Romane, the official literary and artistic school of Action Frangaise. There seemed to be nothing in his background or his inclinations to justify such an association — for which, indeed, Maritain never ceased to reproach himself. And yet a combination of circumstances — “a blind little providence,\" says Rai’ssa Maritain — led him into an extended (approximately fifteen years) but very uneasy association with Maurras and his movement. It was Father Clerissac who first urged Maritain to become a member of Action Frangaise. Maritain never actually became a member, but he did let himself be persuaded (about 1911) to sub-\n\n8\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nscribe to Maurras' newspaper Action Franqaise, the official organ of the movement, and read it with some regularity in deference to the wishes of Father Clerissac. The enthusiastic young neophyte had profound respect for this holy and learned Dominican and considered him a man of \"perfect integrity of conscience.\" It was Father Clerissac who had instructed him in the Catholic faith, received him into the Church, introduced him to the writings of the Angelic Doctor and acted as his spiritual director. The institution of spiritual direction has played an important part in the Church's traditional teaching on the life of sanctity. The writings of the great saints and mystics on this subject, compiled, organized and distilled into the science of \"mystical theology,\" invariably advise those who aspire to sanctity and the higher states of mystical union with God to seek the guidance of a holy and learned man. The ordinary Christian has his confessor for a guide; but the man who aspires to sanctity needs more professional guidance in the practice of perfection. Having chosen a spiritual director of appropriate holiness and learning, the aspirant is advised to submit himself entirely to this man, even to the point of blind obedience, in all that is related to the spiritual life. Moreover, in the manuals of perfection it is quite common to find this blind obedience extended even to matters that have no direct connection with the spiritual life. Though these manuals, strictly speaking, express the opinions of their individual authors and do not carry the authority of the official teaching of the Church, they have traditionally been followed rather closely, especially in seminaries and religious houses. One of the most popular manuals of Christian perfection in France in the 1920s was The Spiritual Life by Father Adolphe Tanquerey.2 In article 2 of chapter 5 the author gives a brief history of the institution of spiritual direction from the writings of saints and doctors of the Church such as Cassian, John Climacus, Bernard of Clairvaux, Vincent Ferrer, John of the Cross, Francis de Sales, Alphonsus Ligouri, etc. Maritain was familiar with the writings of many of these men, in particular St. John of the Cross, and he was certainly familiar with this and other current manuals of the spiritual life. Here are a few quotations from Tanquerey pertaining to submission to one's spiritual director: Aspirants to sanctity are urged \"to open their heart to the elder charged with the direction of their life; to disclose to him without false shame their secret thoughts, and to submit themselves entirely to his decision as to what is good and evil\" (p. 258).\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n9\n\n“The director must be respected as the representative of God, clothed as he is with God's authority, in what regards our most intimate and most sacred relations with God. Hence, if he has shortcomings, let us not dwell on them, but simply regard his authority and his mission. A penitent will thus carefully avoid any criticism whereby the filial respect due his director is lost or lessened\" (p. 267). “Strictly speaking our director may be mistaken, but we make no mistake in obeying him, except, of course, were he to give counsel opposed to faith or morals\" (p. 269). Such teaching may be valid in some cases, but it is fraught with many dangers, and to these dangers Maritain let himself fall victim. In accepting baptism in the Catholic Church, he had taken an irrevocable step, so to speak, in total darkness. He had subordinated the light of reason to the light of faith. According to the teachings of the Church that he was entering, the act of faith is an act of the will which enables the intellect to accept a truth it cannot explain by reason, but solely on the authority of God, who reveals the truth. Reason can be used to show that the truths of faith are not irrational — that is, contrary to reason — but, beyond this, reason is tongue-tied before such mysteries as the Trinity, the Incarnation, or the Real Presence in the Eucharist. The idea of committing the whole purpose and direction of one’s life irrevocably (an aspirant is not admitted to baptism in the Church unless he considers his commitment irrevocable) to a set of truths for which he was, by definition, incapable of finding a rational explanation or understanding was for Maritain, whose whole training had been scientific and positivist, certainly a commitment made in “total darkness,\" from a purely natural and rationalist point of view. In speaking of Ernest Psichari's conversion in Antimoderne (pp. 234ff.), Maritain has a long digression on the light of faith contrasted with the light of reason. He is evidently speaking from personal experience in his remarks about the intellectual darkness of the act of faith. About two months before Maritain’s baptism, Leon Bloy wrote to Pierre Termier, a friend of the Maritains: \"They still want to enter the Church, but the final step, the one which is irrevocable, terrifies them.\"3 The immediate cause of Maritain’s conversion was not the adroit arguments of the apologists but the rationally inexplicable phenomenon of Leon Bloy, who became his godfather. In entering the Church, Maritain determined to go all the way. Totally committed to the proposition of his godfather, that the only misfortune in life is not to be a saint, Maritain submitted completely,\n\n10\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nand blindly, to the direction of Father Clerissac, even to letting his spiritual director form his political conscience. Maritain, who took the idea of conversion quite literally, once described himself to Cocteau as a man whom God had turned inside out like a glove, and one aspect of his conversion consisted in turning his back on the political and social ideas he had formed in his early days, when \"Humanity\" had held for him the place of God.4 Father Clerissac offered him another political orientation, which he accepted uncritically as an essential part of becoming a Catholic. If Maritain did not do actual violence to his critical sense in accepting the political illusions of Father Clerissac, he at least had ignored the warnings of his reason and refused to make the necessary distinctions he was wont to make in his philosophical writings.5 Because his political opinions were in strict accord with those of Pius X, Father Clerissac saw in democracy and the republican form of government a diabolical incarnation of the errors condemned in the Syllabus of Errors.6 He could not envisage a democracy untainted by Modernism and the anticlericalism characteristic of the Third Republic. Moreover, it is very likely that Clerissac included Pius X's anti-Modernist profession of faith as part of the ceremony of Maritain's baptism.7 In his book Maurras et notre temps, Henri Massis reports a conversation between himself and Maritain at the home of the latter's mother, Madame Favre, long after the crisis had passed. Maritain and Massis had drifted apart in the years that followed the crisis. In 1932 Massis began preparing his book Evocations, and moved by the memories of their early friendship and of their comradeship with Ernest Psichari, he had come to seek out his friend of former days. Massis reconstructs from memory (as is his wont) an extended conversation that took place on this occasion in Maritain's study. Whether the words attributed to Maritain were actually spoken by him is subject to doubt; however, they seem to give a rather accurate account — judging from what Maritain and his wife say in their writings —of Father Clerissac’s political views and his influence on the young philosopher. Maritain began by confessing his remorse for having seconded Father Clerissac's efforts to bring Massis into Action Frangaise: Ah! said Maritain, his head bent toward me, I have often reproached myself for that, among my many other failures of foresight! ... This responsibility weighs heavily on me and still torments me.... I can’t forget that it was Father Clerissac and I who encouraged you to turn toward Action Frangaise.\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n11\n\nSupposedly, Maritain went on to explain the reasons for Father Clerissac's attitude and for his own submission to his director's recommendations: Before Father Clerissac became my director, I had no connection with Action Frangaise; in fact, I knew nothing about it! All my research was in the held of metaphysics and I had no interest whatever in politics. What I had seen of it in my youth was enough to disgust me; in my opinion it was nothing more than the most horrible of the idols of this world! It is enough to say that I was a disciple of Leon Bloy. ... I had not read even a single book by Maurras, and I hadn't the least desire to do so. I subscribed to the newspaper in 1911 and I read it without ever having opened one of his books. If I read Maurras' daily column, it was because Father Clerissac had persuaded me that I should be associated with Action Frangaise! I had accepted this, as I had all the rest, with complete docility, out of obedience, out of submission to my director; and I convinced myself that this decision was an integral part of all I had to accept in entering the Church. . . . But what could Father Clerissac have been thinking . . . ? Here is how I explain it to myself: the restoration of the monarchy seemed to Father Clerissac indispensable to the restoration of the Church in our society; in his eyes, the monarchy alone was able to re-establish the Church in the fullness of its rights. He noted with horror all that the Church had been forced to abandon in fact or to leave in escheatage since the Revolution. ... He recognized the source of the blows struck against the notions of hierarchy and order, which are essential to the life of the Church, and he placed the Church above all else; hence he detested democracy as an evil ... he knew the dangers which at that particular time \"Modernism\" posed to the dogmatic teaching of the Faith. The fact that Action Frangaise, from outside the Church, opposed these errors, the fact that it denounced relentlessly the influence of Bergson, and the antiintellectualism of Blondel or Laberthonniere, all this made the movement all the more dear to him. . . . Father Clerissac thus convinced me that Action Frangaise alone was able to prepare, in the political order, the conditions necessary for the re-establishment of an integral order.8 These somewhat too fertile reconstructions of conversations in Massis’ book picture with relative fidelity the essential ele-\n\n12\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nments of the situation, but, they must be approached with caution for they often seem colored in certain details by the author's prejudices. A case in point is the last sentence in the conversation quoted above. It is true that Father Clerissac may have convinced Maritain that Action Frangaise was one of the many means, in the political realm, to prepare the conditions necessary for the reestablishment of order in society. It is very unlikely, however, that he convinced Maritain that it was the only means to such an end. During the twenty years between his conversion and the crisis, Maritain spoke often of the necessary conditions for renewal of the social order, and in every case the condition was a return to the spirit of Christianity and the practice of the evangelical virtues of justice and charity. Not once in this connection did Maritain mention Action Frangaise, and he consistently refused to teach in the institute founded by Maurras. It is probable that Father Clerissac convinced Maritain that Action Frangaise could contribute to the renewal of society; but one must not overlook the fact that as Maritain became more familiar with the movement, through reading Maurras' daily newspaper, his criticisms and reservations became, as we shall see, more frequent and more forceful. In general, however, the words about Father Clerissac attributed to Maritain by Massis confirm the impression given by Raissa in Les Grandes Amities: Father Clerissac passionately admired Maurras; and in his disgust for the modern world, in his pure enthusiasm for the metaphysical notion of order, he trusted a movement then developing under the aegis of violence in the service of order, the spiritual dangers of which he did not discern. Maurras' school had at that time a certain intellectual vitality, and had not yet hardened in its worst characteristics; this explains in part Father Clerissac's illusions.9 Henry Massis takes exception to the word \"illusions\" in this text. He claims that Raissa Maritain had no right to speak of Father Clerissac’s \"illusions\" since, even before 1910, it was public knowledge that Rome was investigating the spiritual integrity of both Maurras' movement of Nationalisme Integral and the political and theological Modernism of Catholic liberals. All this theologico-political discussion resulted, he claims, in the condemnation of the liberals, while Action Frangaise emerged with clean skirts:\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n13\n\nFrom that time on, everything had been said on the substance of the question. . . . Father Clerissac therefore already knew all that could be said about the \"spiritual dangers\" of the Maurrassian school.10 Hence, Massis concludes, with baffling logic, Father Clerissac's recruiting for Action Frangaise in 1911 and 1912 could not have been done in ignorance: everything he needed to know was clearly put down in the Vatican dossier on Maurras, \"that dossier which Pius X in 1911 had refused to take out of his drawer.\"11 Is it not possible that Father Clerissac could have had \"illusions\" about the contents of a dossier that was not made public? And is it not possible that Pius X’s refusal to take the dossier from his drawer might have fostered the \"illusion\" that the spiritual dangers it mentioned were not serious enough to merit condemnation? Massis is caught with his non sequiturs showing, but his confusion goes even deeper; he is mistaken about dates and events. There certainly was an anti-Modernist campaign from 1907 to 1910, which culminated in the encyclical Pascendi and the Syllabus of Pius X, in the prohibition of the works of such Catholic liberals as Loisy, Laberthonniere and Le Roy, in the persecution of clerical scholars who sought to interpret Christian doctrine in the light of modern social and scientific developments and, finally, in the condemnation of Marc Sangnier's Catholic liberal political movement Sillon. Professors who were suspected of Modernist tendencies were removed from the faculties of Catholic educational institutions and seminaries, their publications were suppressed or prohibited and an anti-Modernist loyalty oath was administered to the clergy and candidates for the clergy. The partisans of Action Frangaise were overjoyed. Contrary to what Massis says, there was no official investigation of Maurras and Action Frangaise until 1913 — and this investigation appears to be the one which, according to Massis, would have made it impossible for Father Clerissac to have harbored any \"illusions\" about Action Frangaise in 1911. Previous to 1911, questions had been raised about the orthodoxy of Maurras' position on Christianity; reports had been sent to Rome in increasing numbers and warnings were issued to the laity by highly placed clerics. These complaints may well have appeared to monarchist and conservative clergy like Father Clerissac as the death spasms of Catholic liberals, who had been dealt a mortal blow by Pius X’s Syllabus of Errors. Nevertheless,\n\n14\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nthe complaints became so numerous and insistent that they prompted an investigation of Maurras in 1913. The result was that the Sacred Congregation of the Index found seven of Maurras' books extremely dangerous and placed them on the Index on January 16, 1914. It was the dossier of this investigation of 1913- 14 (not 1911)12 that Pius X refused to take out of his drawer, reserving to himself the right to choose the date for promulgation of the condemnation. Until such a date, the condemnation would not be official and binding on Catholic consciences. It is true, as Massis says, that Father Clerissac could not have been ignorant of the objections to Maurras in certain ecclesiastical circles. These objections were common knowledge. This knowledge, however, did not come, as Massis insists, from decorous and dignified public discussion of the merits of Action Frangaise, carried on with \"an elevation of tone and with speculative gravity and decorum,\"13 but rather from the ecclesiastical grapevine, whose tendrils extended deep into the Vatican and into the heart of Maurras’ movement. It is certainly not true that \"everything had been said about the fundamental issues,\" as the violent debates of 1926- 29 were later to show. Of course, in 1914 everyone in Action Frangaise knew of the condemnation, but they took Pius X’s politically expedient procrastination as a sign of approval.14 Father Clerissac died on November 16, 1914, but from the time of the unofficial condemnation (in January) there is no sign that he made the slightest effort to dissociate himself or his spiritual wards from the movement. Rome had not yet spoken, so the case was not yet closed. Father Clerissac, like so many other French clerics, was laboring under the illusion that promulgation of the Index listings could be held off indefinitely, that the possibility of another liberal Pope like Leo XIII was out of the question and that the future of the Church, as well as civilization, lay with the political parties of the far right. And it was to this man that Maritain had submitted himself with complete docility in matters of the spiritual life. The new political orientation urged on him by his spiritual director must have appeared to Maritain to have been somehow connected with the spiritual life, since many of the tenets of the liberalism to which Action Frangaise was opposed had been condemned by the Vatican as contrary to faith and morals. Maritain took seriously the old priest's \"pitiless\" mockery of his demo-\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n15\n\ncratic leanings and socialistic tendencies, which Father Clerissac told him (according to Raissa) were but \"the remains of the old man which had to be put off.\"15 He seems to have considered that a change in political allegiance was part of his entering completely into the life of the Church. It was not the influence of Father Clerissac alone that tended to make Maritain ignore his misgivings about Action Frangaise. The approbation, tacit or explicit, of such high-ranking ecclesiastical dignitaries and theologians as Pius X, Cardinal Billot and Dom Besse (who led Bernanos into Action Frangaise) cannot be discounted. Dom Delatte, abbot of the famous Benedictine monastery of Solesmes, where Maritain often made retreats, was an ardent admirer of Maurras. Through the Cercle d’Etudes Thomistes, Maritain was in close contact with the clerical and lay leaders of the Thomist revival, who were almost to the man politically conservative. The opinions of such unworldly men and great scholars as Fathers Thomas Pegues and Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, who saw only the single-minded opposition of Action Frangaise to the worldly forces of Modernism, certainly weighed heavily with the young philosopher.16 Eugen Weber says, in a precise description of Maritain's situation in the early 1900s: The influence of men like these was very great at a time when young people of the educated classes, ill at ease before the critical ideas of a rationalist Sorbonne, turned in droves toward the Church, hoping to find in it the principles of order and social discipline that might help to stave off the destruction of their world.17 It may not be without significance that at the very time when Father Clerissac was urging adherence to the monarchist and conservative political position as an essential part of his entering completely into the life of the Church, Maritain was going through a religious crisis, assailed by the first serious doubts about the faith he had embraced in 1907. In his Carnet de notes he says: Was it in 1911, or 1912? I was suddenly assailed by violent temptations against the faith. Up until that time the graces of baptism had been such that I seemed to see what I believed. Everything was so evident. Now I had to learn what was meant by the darkness of faith. I was no longer a babe in arms; I was brutally put down on the ground. I remember\n\n16\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nthe long hours of interior torture, on Orangerie Street, alone in my fourth floor room which I had made into a kind of refuge for my work. I kept from speaking about it, and eventually, by the grace of God, I came through this trial greatly strengthened; but I was no longer a child. I found consolation in telling myself that all this was necessary, if I were going to be of any service to others.18 An act of faith is an act of the will that leads the intelligence to give its assent to belief without the benefit of rational evidence. May not this acceptance, however misguided, of the suggestions of Father Clerissac have been part of the desperate efforts of a man to surrender himself completely to the precious faith he felt himself in danger of losing? All these explanations are not meant as a justification for Maritain. They are simply an attempt to understand how he could have let himself be so misled, for he was mistaken, and seriously. With naive and imprudent docility, he failed to distinguish between what constituted, for a Catholic, the supreme teaching authority of the Church and what was merely the expression of personal opinion by individual clergymen. This mistake is a fact of history, and no one, least of all Maritain, has tried to explain it away. No one has been more severe in condemning this intellectual negligence than the Maritains themselves. Wherever one finds reference to this period in the writings of either Maritain or his wife, one also usually finds expressions of selfreproach for their \"ignorance of the limits of spiritual direction,\" for their \"untimely docility,\" their \"undue obedience,\" their \"unpardonable thoughtlessness,\" \"inadvertence,\" \"naivete and lack of consideration,\" and for their uncritical readiness \"to make obligatory for themselves what went against their very inclination.\"19 As his doubts and misgivings about Action Frangaise grew, and he was to examine his political allegiance carefully, he recognized the foolishness of his \"blind\" obedience to Father Clerissac in political matters. Every subsequent position he took was based on painstaking consideration in the light of his philosophical principles and the voice of his conscience. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, for example, he saw immediately — through critical, intelligent examination — what Bernanos refused to see until he was personally confronted with the brutal reality of Falangist atrocities. And Maritain held to his convictions, in spite of the \"official\" declaration of Pius XII in favor of\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n17\n\nFranco and in the face of violent opposition from the majority of the Catholic clergy and laity — even to the extent of threats of condemnation by the Sacred Congregation of the Index. Maritain had learned his lesson painfully, but well. When Maritain eventually broke with Action Frangaise, it was not due to a sudden conversion brought about by slavish obedience to Rome's decision (an illusion engendered and fostered by his \"friend” Henri Massis, who found it expedient for himself and for the movement to portray Maritain as a fuzzy intellectual and an unprincipled turncoat). As early as 1914 —the year Father Clerissac died and twelve years before the condemnation — Maritain had written to Maurras of his astonishment at the way in which Maurras made use of a historical allusion to give a false impression of the monarchist situation: Permit me to tell you that I was astonished to see you make such a rapid and summary allusion in your article. . . . You know that for me it is not a question of practical politics, but of the truth. In 1918, eight years before the condemnation, Maurras wrote to Maritain: \"I will not fail to read attentively Father Clerissac's book.”20 Maritain had sent him a copy of Father Clerissac's Mystere de I’Eglise (Maritain had written the preface), in which chapter 6 treats the relations between Church and State and their relative positions of authority over men. (We shall see other examples of his growing misgivings.) Through the influence of Father Clerissac, then, Maritain became associated with Action Frangaise. As will be seen, he tried to keep this association completely apolitical. He considered the association not so much membership in a political party as a kind of rallying of friends and kindred spirits to defend common philosophical causes and to attack common philosophical enemies. To this comradeship Maritain gave himself wholeheartedly. In spite of his desire to remain politically detached, he was closely associated with the movement in the mind of the general public, so that at one time he was known as the official philosopher of Action Frangaise. This impression was fostered, in particular, by his participation in the early 1920s in the founding and editing of La Revue Universelle. Before his death in the war in 1918, a young royalist, Pierre Villard, filled with the same disillusion and the same craving for religious and philosophical certitude that had troubled Maritain\n\n18\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nbefore his conversion, came to seek advice from the young Thomist, whose fame wa§ increasing every day. Though Maritain saw little of Villard, the two exchanged a very active correspondence until the latter's death in the war. So impressed was Villard with Maritain and his work that he left a legacy of more than a million francs, to be divided equally between Maurras and Maritain. This legacy was a welcome surprise, for it enabled Maritain to free himself from the time-consuming tasks which kept him from devoting himself completely to the renewal of Christian philosophy. To supplement the scanty salary he received from the Institut Catholique, he had agreed to edit the Dictionnaire de la vie pratique and to prepare a Lexique orthographique for the publisher Hachette. Villard's bequest gave Maurras and Maritain complete liberty in the disposition of their inheritance, contenting himself with an expression of general intention. The purpose of the legacy, Villard said, was to contribute \"to safeguarding what remains of the moral and intellectual patrimony of our country. . . . this patrimony cannot be saved without a return to the Christian method and without a re flowering of the Faith.\"21 Concerning the publicity to be given to Villard's legacy, Maritain wrote a letter to Maurras which shows his desire to be associated as little as possible with Action Franqaise: At any rate, in whatever concerns me, after consulting my friends and authorized counselors, I definitely believe that it is preferable that my name not be mentioned for the moment and that no allusion whatever be made to the legacy I have received. Doubtless it will be painful for me not to publish the admirable words in which Pierre Villard speaks of his religious aspirations; but I believe that I will conform more faithfully to the intentions of our friend by sacrificing for the moment this exterior manifestation of his sentiments to the real and effective good that he proposed as his objective, and to the attaining of which, any publicity, at least in what concerns me, would create considerable obstacles. If you make public some part of the will and of Pierre Villard's letter, I ask you to limit the publication strictly to the part which concerns you and to say nothing of what touches me.22 In January 1920, Maurras suggested that they each contribute 50,000 francs from this legacy for founding a review which\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n19\n\nmight serve as a sounding board for the ideas and principles of Action Frangaise in political and social activity, on the one hand, and on the other hand for Christian and particularly Thomist thought in religion and philosophy. Maurras was an astute man. He may have felt the need, in the face of the ever increasing animadversions sent to Rome and the clerical warnings about his movement, to associate himself closely with a Catholic thinker who was above ecclesiastical reproach. Besides, might not Maritain prove a formidable enemy if he were to drift into the liberal camp, for many of whose principles he showed a dangerous sympathy? Had not Maritain, shortly before this, attacked the modern capitalist economy as founded on “two principles contrary to nature: the fecundity of money and the finality of the useful '?23 Had he not always preached the necessity of reestablishing social justice as prerequisite for any kind of order and peace in society?24 Had he not questioned the morality of the economic principles that were used to justify interest-bearing loans? Had he not, in 1907, brought these doubts to Dom Delatte (who, of course, put them aside with the back of his hand), and did he not persist in these doubts even after the facile and confident assurance of the famous abbot?25 Was he not known for his public association with Jews? Nevertheless, Maurras asked Maritain to take charge of the religious and philosophical pages of the review. Jacques Bainville, whose ideas about history Maritain was far from sharing,26 was to be in charge of the historical, social and political sections while Massis (later to become editor in chief) was to work under Bainville as literary editor. The publication was to be called La Revue Universelle. Massis, who had spoken to Maritain of the project in September 1919, minimized the role of Action Frangaise, explaining that the review needed the movement's vast reading public to get under way. He was careful to make it clear (Did he detect in Maritain some suspicious diffidence regarding Action Frangaise?) that the review would be an “independent organ,” with no formal liaison with the movement.27 Later, however, Massis was to write about his and Maritain's collaboration in terms that smacked of the subordination of religion to politics, a tendency for which the movement was soon to be condemned by Rome. Massis wrote: The name of Bainville was enough to define the dominant lines of the political, historical, social and literary thought of such a publication. My collaboration and that of my\n\n20\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nfriend Jacques Maritain added an element which gave the review the character of a Catholic publication.28 Maritain hesitated. Certain aspects of the movement and of Maurras' attitude troubled him. On July 11, 1919, Raissa made an entry in her diary which seems to imply that the opinion she expressed was shared by her husband: “The political positivism of Maurras now leaves much to be desired.” This sentence concludes an assertion that society could be saved only if truth and justice were pursued for their own sake,29 which was one of her husband's favorite themes. Years later, in an entry in Maritain's diary concerning the period 1914 to 1926, he speaks of his misgivings about Action Frangaise and of a reason for his association with the movement and his acceptance of Maurras' proposal about La Revue JJniverselle: At that time the partisans of Action Frangaise still enjoyed, in my opinion, the prestige of their partriotism, and I presumptuously imagined that I would be able to help them separate this patriotism and the healthy ideas it contained from the positivist system of Maurras and his nationalist idolatry, of whose danger I was becoming more and more aware. . . . Maurras’ profound atheism, the cult of violence and the intellectual tyranny which raged among his disciples, the way he conducted his polemic activity, which grew daily more odious (until the day when it became clear to me in all its lies, its cynical use of calumny during this ferocious campaign against Georges Valois), —I closed my eyes to all this in the absurd hope of bringing about doctrinal corrections and installing a Christian philosophy in the very heart of a school whose political principles I did not realize, having at that time only very superficial ideas in that domain, suffered from incurable errors.30 Influenced by the memory that Father Clerissac had strongly encouraged such a review and had often spoken to Maritain and Massis on the subject, and tempted by the immense reading public the review would open to the Catholic and Thomist revival,31 Maritain decided to accept. From its very inception, La Revue JJniverselle, both because of the names of its backers, editors and contributors and because of the tenor of its articles, was considered by the public as the official intellectual organ of Action Frangaise. And though his contributions were\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n21\n\nconcerned entirely with theoretical philosophy, Maritain was soon considered the official philosopher of the movement. Thus, alas, there seemed to be accentuated that kind of entente cordiale between Action Frangaise and me [wrote Maritain], founded on equivocation and due to my political naivete of those days and to the influence of Father Clerissac.32 Maritain insists that his role as philosophical editor of La Revue Universelle was the absolute limit of his cooperation with Maurras. However, he proved most active in this enterprise, publishing no fewer than thirty-six articles and reviews from April 1920 until February 1927, when he severed all connection with the review and with Action Frangaise. And his contributions, much to his subsequent embarrassment and regret, were not free from an occasional satirical aside at the expense of democratic institutions. Such remarks were the “last vestiges of the political influence of Leon Bloy and Father Clerissac,\" Rai'ssa explains,33 but these remarks became less and less frequent and overt criticisms of many positions sacred to Action Frangaise became more numerous. His very first article for the review was an attack on positivism as destructive of intelligence; indeed his antagonism to this fundamental principle and Maurrasism was a persistent theme with Maritain during the early 1920s. In 1921 he published an article in defense of the Jews.34 More than once he proposed that the Russian Revolution was the instrument of God's justice, to sweep away the corruption and tyranny of the established regime.35 Maritain was asserting the autonomy he had demanded as philosophical editor, and his frequent attacks on intellectual positivism may perhaps be explained as an effort to erase a serious intellectual faux pas he had made (probably due to his close friendship with Massis) at the turn of the century. Massis says that Maritain wrote these words to him at this time: God has made us two brothers to serve and fight together, but as a guide there is only one for both of us, and it is He. . . . When I think of the ten years that have passed since our meeting, how marvelous His Grace has been and how beautiful has been the path He has led us to follow! We have begun to bind our sheaves together.36\n\n22\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nThe friendship between Maritain and Massis began in 1913, when Psichari brought Massis to Maritain's home, and it grew deeper with the years. The moving dedication of his book Jugements to Maritain and the eloquent expression of his admiration for him in L’Honneur de servir testify to the profound feeling of Massis for his friend. (At the time that they were collaborating on La Revue Universelle, they were also associated in an offensive against Andre Gide.) Contrary to his practice, Frederic Lefevre, who published in La Nouvelle Revue Franqaise his hour-long interviews with prominent literary figures from France and other countries of Western Europe, interviewed Massis and Maritain together.37 In this series of interviews, the names of these two men are almost invariably linked together, whether for praise or for criticism, by numerous men of letters. \"Massis-Maritain\" seems to have been pronounced almost as one word. It was probably in deference to this friendship that Maritain made the mistake of letting it be known that he approved the Parti de 1'Intelligence, which Massis founded in 1919. Massis did not intend this party to be a political organization, but an intellectual federation of Europe for the defense of the humanistic, Christian West against intellectual bolshevism. This European federation would be formed under the aegis of France, the guardian of all civilization, and the manifesto that Massis wrote for the Parti de 1’Intelligence was remarkably Maurrasian in tone. It is difficult to determine the reasons for Maritain's approbation. He did not sign the manifesto. It is hard to imagine Massis not approaching him, considering their closeness, their connection in the public eye, and Maritain's prestige. On the other hand, Maritain seems to have made no effort to destroy the impression that he was a member of the party or to separate himself from the group. Jacques Riviere, the editor of La Nouvelle P.evue Franqaise, saw immediately what Maritain should have seen from the outset: the new party was subordinating intelligence to national interest —was making truth subservient to Caesar. In the September 1919 issue of his review, Riviere published a perceptive and scathing attack which accused the adherents of the party of wearing blinkers on their intelligence. In one line in particular, he found the essential error of the manifesto: “In a word, we know what we want and what we do not want!’ . . . The key word has been given out. These gentlemen \"know what they want and what they do not want,\" and for\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n23\n\nthem the intelligence is the means to obtain the first and to obviate the second. It is there to “classify,\" to place in hierarchical order, to impose on what is real a form that has been chosen and decreed once and for all.38 When Massis commented on this article in 1959, in his book De I’homme a Dieu, he provided a perfect example of the kind of intellectual prostitution that Riviere had in mind. He dismissed the criticism that the Parti de l'lntelligence had failed to distinguish between truth and politics and had shackled the freedom of the intellect with a kind of “empirisme organisateur,” as if these were essentially irrelevant remarks that might be expected from the literary liberals. Then, lifting a quotation out of context from Riviere’s attack, he used it as a testimonial of approbation for his Parti de l'lntelligence.39 How could Maritain have given his approbation, or how could he have let the equivocation continue, if he did not approve? Nothing should have been more opposed to his instincts as a philosopher. Probably nothing was ever to cause him more anguish, remorse or embarrassment than this culpable negligence. Raissa wrote in 1945: What regrets he would feel later for not having separated himself immediately from this unfortunate anomalous group that Massis was to “launch\" under the name of the “party of the intelligence,\" as if the two words could be joined and as if the first did not insult the second.40 Riviere's article must have awakened Maritain to his professional responsibility; for as we have seen, with his very first article in La Revue Universelle, a few months later, he began a series of persistent attacks on the intellectual attitude represented in Massis' manifesto. However, never once during the years from 1919 till his break with Action Frangaise does he seem to have publicly criticized Massis by name, which permitted the equivocation about his approbation to persist. Although Maritain's public defense of the 1926 papal condemnation of Action Frangaise was to be the reef on which his friendship with Massis came to pieces, there were indications that the friendship was weakening long before that time. Their community of interests became more and more tenuous as Maritain, during the decade preceding the 1926 crisis, committed himself more and more to friends, ideas and organizations inimical to Action Frangaise. Massis was present at the inauguration of the\n\n24\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nCercle d'Etudes Thomistes in 1914, and seems to have been an enthusiastic member of the group during the early meetings. After 1920, even at the height of his collaboration with Maritain on La Revue Universelle, his name becomes conspicuous by its absence from the attendance lists for the meetings and retreats of the Cercle. People began to attend regularly who were hardly congenial to Massis: Fumet, Cocteau, Sachs, Ramuz, Borne, Merleau-Ponty and Cattaui, for example. Massis wrote a letter to Maritain about this time, reprimanding him for spending so much valuable time on the “enfants perdus” who came knocking at his door (Cocteau, Maurice Sachs, Cattaui!) and urging him to devote more time, as was his duty, to \"young Frenchmen who are authentic Christians of good racial stock.’’41 From 1924 on, Maritain was closely associated with Hindu and Chinese intellectuals42 and with the Russian philosopher Nicolas Berdyaev, a kind of pre-Johannine Russian Orthodox ecumenicist.43 In the late twenties and early thirties, specialists in Eastern studies, such as Louis Massignon and Olivier Lacombe, took a very active part in the meetings in Meudon. All this could hardly have been congenial for Massis, who during these years was zealously‘proclaiming his rather fanatical idealization of Western Christian culture and his supreme contempt for the \"barbarities\" of the East in a book he was preparing, Defense de /’Occident. Before the book appeared, Massis sent the galley proofs for corrections and suggestions to Maritain, who read the manuscript with meticulous care, filling the margins with animadversions that, when put together, cover nine single-spaced typewritten pages. They show how far apart Maritain and Massis (and Maurras as well) had grown in their attitudes toward history, politics, culture and art. \"This formula is too much like Maurras. . . . What good does it do to abuse them in such a manner? . . . After all, there are some nuances to be considered. . . . This goes far beyond the sense of the quotation. This isn't what he meant. . . . In all this it seems to me that one should show pity rather than indignation. . . . Impossible. ... I think this is unjust. . . . Much too hard and absolute. . . . Such summary judgments can do enormous harm in such cases. . . . You cannot say that of all the East. . . . This note seems dangerous to me,\" etc., etc.44 In a letter he sent back with the proofs, Maritain wrote: I would not be telling you the truth, my dear Henri, if I did not tell you the impression of sadness and pain that remains\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n25\n\nwith me. . . . What arouses these apprehensions in me ... is the impression as a whole that your book leaves with me. . . . That impression is the following: a book animated by the spirit of combat; not by the spirit of justice. Justice alone is strong and efficacious.45 In 1925, two years before the publication of Massis' book, Maritain wrote him of the dangerous influence of Maurras that he found in Massis’ thought: I read in the Revue catholique des idees et des faits a message of Maurras to all Latinity, which appears to me far from satisfying. \"Latinity,” I have no idea what that can be, no more than \"organity” or \"germanity” or his other racial expressions. On the other hand we know very well what Christianity and Catholicity mean. I m afraid that your position is being confused with that of Maurras, whose acknowledged authority is so strong that it would risk deforming in the minds of your readers the true meaning of your work. ... If your defense of the Christian West is confused with the defense of Latinity in the nationalist or racist sense, in the strictly Maurrasian sense, the whole undertaking will be spoiled.46 When Maritain founded the series Roseau d’Or in 1925, to provide a forum for authors in sympathy with the ideas discussed at the meetings at Meudon, he asked Massis to be one of the editors, along with Fumet, Cocteau, Ramuz, Lefevre (mentioned above) and Gheon, but there was no real rapport between Massis and the other editors (with the possible exception of Gheon). Maritain seems to have asked him in deference to their old friendship and in an effort to draw him away from Maurras and into the Cercle. It failed, however, for a fervent disciple of Maurras could hardly feel at home when such personalities as Jean de Menasce, Charles Du Bos, Yves Simon, Rene Schwob, Jacques Madaule, Frangois Mauriac, Julian Green and Emmanuel Mounier were in regular attendance. It is little wonder, then, that Massis gradually dissociated himself in public from Maritain. Although Massis frequently expressed regret over the loss of Maritain's friendship, it was he, not Maritain, who took the initiative in breaking it off.47 For many years Maritain was indefatigable in his efforts to persuade Massis to submit to Rome. He felt a great responsibility for Massis since he himself had introduced him to Action Frangaise.\n\n26\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nMassis' claim that Maritain's change of heart about Action Frangaise was quite sudden and took him by surprise is completely unfounded. Besides Maritain's numerous associations with persons and groups directly opposed to the spirit of Action Frangaise, there is the evidence of his book Une Opinion sur Charles Maurras et le devoir des Catholiques (1926). As early as October 1925, more than a year before the official condemnation, Maritain was at work on this book, putting down his reactions to certain criticisms and accusations made by a group of Belgian Catholics against Maurras. A Belgian priest, Abbe Van den Hout, had asked Maurras, Massis and Maritain for papers which would explain Maurras' movement and its principles and allay the fears of many Belgian Catholics, but Maritain was the only one who took the request seriously enough to write a paper in October of 1925. When he received no further word from Abbe Van den Hout, he put it aside in a drawer; but when, almost a year later, his friend Abbe Charles Journet, professor at the major seminary in Fribourg and editor of the Catholic review for French-speaking Switzerland, Nova et Vetera, asked him for a study of Maurras from a strictly Catholic point of view, for publication in his review, Maritain took his paper from the drawer. He sent a copy to Maurras for his criticism, remarking that the study was done \"in an absolutely independent manner and from a completely theological point of view. This can endow with more authority what the article says in your favor, but it also exposes me to the risk of displeasing you at certain moments.\"48 In gentle but no uncertain terms, Maritain made a number of reservations and distinctions about the movement and laid down the conditions which would have to be met to make Action Frangaise acceptable to Catholics. It is important to note that these were the very stipulations to which Maurras and Daudet (the editor of Action Frangaise) were to cry “Non possumus!\" when they were demanded by Rome. Maurras, writing of the \"great emotion\" with which he read the study, replied on September 25: What misunderstandings you have dissipated. But will not others arise from what you have written? . . . How I would like to find the leisure some day to chat with you about political science, of that element — let us call it mechanical — which this science seems to me to contain; of how it is distinguished from morals, whose application begins, it seems to me, only at that point where there is an act of the\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n27\n\nwill, that is to say political action — all of which puts aside certain grave questions of political structure.49 It is inconceivable that Maritain did not discuss these ideas with Massis too before their publication. As a matter of fact, in September 1926, shortly after Pius XI wrote a letter to Cardinal Andrieu of Bordeaux approving many of the latter's allegations about the dangers of Action Frangaise, Maurras and Massis visited Maritain at Meudon to confer on a strategy of defense. It was decided that Maurras would publicly state his position with regard to the Catholic Church, Maritain would show on what conditions the doctrine and practices of Maurras could be reconciled to the Church, and Massis would recount the services Action Frangaise had already rendered to Catholicism. One is led to believe that Maritain, alone of the three, took the imminent danger of condemnation very seriously, for he alone carried out his task.50 Maritain's Opinion sur Charles Maurras in many places reads like a gentle but firm warning to the leader of Action Frangaise. Very early on, the author spoke of the \"somber uneasiness\" he habitually felt about Maurras. He expressed a certain admiration for Maurras, but could not understand his \"deeply upsetting admiration for Anatole France.\" He explained that Maurras' \"politiques d’abord” could be acceptable to a Catholic if politics comes first\" is understood not in the order of intention (i.e., in the order of ends, where politics is not an absolute end in itself, subservient to no other), but in the order of execution (i.e., in the order of temporal realizations of human action ).51 It is explicitly stated that the science of politics must always be subordinate in the moral sphere to the science of theology — a hierarchy that Maurras was accused of reversing. From the viewpoint of political science, there is thus a danger of shutting oneself up in an empiricism as if within a self-sufficient doctrine and of refusing the higher syntheses which alone can lead to science in the true sense of the word. The error into which one risks falling is that of political \"materialism.\" From the religious point of view, there is danger of considering the Church in the goods which it dispenses secondarily and in addition to its primary and essential good, i.e., inasmuch as the Church is the best protector of social good, more than in its essential end, function and dignity,\n\n28\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nwhich is to dispense to men supernatural truth and the means to eternal life and which confers on her the right to intervene in temporal affairs.52 Though Maritain praised him for his insistence on order in society, for the role he gave intelligence in directing human affairs, and for his opposition to liberalism, Maritain charged that there was in Maurras, particularly in his early works, a dangerous agnosticism that gave no consideration to the supernatural end of man. He suggested that the Catholic members of Action Frangaise form study groups within the party, having as their object not political action but religious formation, the study of Catholic doctrine, the teachings of the popes and dogmatic and moral theology, all directed by theologians and controlled by ecclesiastical authority, \"to complete and to correct the teachings, the opinions and the examples received from certain of their political masters.\"53 Could Maurras have failed to recognize himself here? The last section of the book was written after the letter of Pius XI to Cardinal Andrieu, concurring in the latter's accusations against Action Frangaise. Maritain called for sincere and complete filial obedience to the wishes of the pope. He recalled that the exhortations of the pope in the years following World War I, asking the victorious nations to soften, in the interests of a durable peace, the harsh conditions imposed on conquered Germany, \"were not followed . . . with any particularly noticeable zeal by those for whom their anti-liberal principles should have nevertheless made obedience much easier.\"54 He condemned that exaggerated \"nationalism\" which refused obedience to the Church in those domains where the Church exercises the legitimate authority conferred on it by Christ.55 What Maritain called for on the part of the Catholics in Action Frangaise was \"unfeigned obedience\" of the spirit.56 One could easily have mistaken the brochure for the papal allocution to which Maurras refused to submit. Nor could Massis have missed these points. Another evidence that Massis could not have been surprised by Maritain's decision to defend the papal position was that Maritain persuaded Maurras, before the public condemnation, to write a letter to the pope expressing his willingness to make some concessions in view of establishing a modus vivendi. It was Massis who brought Maurras to Maritain's home for a meeting with Father Garrigou-Lagrange, the eminent French Thomist theologian of right-wing sympathies, to prepare Maurras to write such a letter. The meeting was a failure, as far as Maritain was con-\n\nAction Franchise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n29\n\ncerned, \"because of Maurras' obstinacy.\"57 The letter which Maurras wrote after this meeting evidently did not satisfy the pope, for he did not reply. Instead, he issued the consistorial allocution Misericordias Domini, forbidding Catholics to belong to Action Frangaise. As soon as he read of the pope s allocution, which he had feared was to come, Maritain wrote to Maurras of being \"cruelly disappointed that nothing had been done [by Maurras and Massis] about the matter discussed in September. The banner headline in the December 24, 1926, edition of Maurras' paper read \"Non possumus!” When Maritain heard of this reply, he gave up all hope of saving the situation for his friends in the movement.59 Five days later, on December 29, 1926, Pope Pius XI promulgated the 1914 decree placing seven of Maurras’ books on the Index. To this list of 1914 the pope, on his own initiative, added Maurras' newspaper Action Frangaise. The newspaper was crucial to the entire movement, and if Catholics had obeyed the prohibition, Action Frangaise would have died. The fact that it did not die is evidence of the extent to which a great number of French Catholics had become Maurrassians, and they continued to subscribe to Action Frangaise and to the opinions they read in it. This fact is also evidence, perhaps, of the inherent justice of the condemnation, from the Church s point of view.60 On January 11, Maritain wrote to Maurras protesting the vitriolic and abusive attacks on the pope in Action Franqaise and announcing his complete and definitive separation from the movement: It is with an immense sadness that I write to you. . . . Why must it be that things so lofty still remain, let me speak frankly, so inferior to the situation, and are communicated through the practical position of the newspaper that is daily more disappointing? The affection in which I hold you, and which I protest once again here, itself forces me to explain myself clearly to you on this matter. Yesterday, in order to conform to the rule that binds us all, I was obliged to write to the director of the newspaper to cancel my subscription. After reading today s issue, I must tell you that I find it absolutely impossible to accept the manner in which the Pope is treated there. The allusions to the two Popes of the fifteenth century is not only odious, it is also completely invalid and beside the point, for in each of these two situations the Pope did not give an order to the\n\n30\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nfaithful in the name of his indirect power over the temporal, as is the case in the present circumstances. I cannot understand how you yourself, after the declarations of persevering respect which you have made, . . . have been able to allow Pius XI to be insulted so cruelly. Nor do I understand how you can permit the particular judgments of men of the greatest authority to be opposed to the judgment of the Pope. You have always fought against the heresy of private judgment; you have always worked to give men's minds a proper feeling for authority, for hierarchy, for the conservative order of being. That you should be led to an attitude that is in practice strictly protestant and anarchic will be for many a horribly painful scandal. As to the two documents you have published, I cannot imagine from what theologians they could have emanated — one can always find theologians to obfuscate with captious sophistry the rectitude of Christian judgment — in themselves they are worth nothing. Theologically, the question can be presented in a very simple manner. . . . And in a last attempt to convince Maurras, Maritain laid out, in seven clear and simple points, the argument he had explained in more detail in Une Opinion sur Charles Maurras. He concluded the seventh point, and the letter, in these words: Man's providence can and ought to judge only by what it can know; but God’s Providence judges according to secrets hidden within itself and according to the real state of human capabilities and of human hearts, which is inaccessible to us. . . . The Ruler of the Universe loves you. ... I too love your soul and that is why I speak to you in this way.61 During the early months of 1927, Maritain began working on a study of the relationship between Church and State which was finished in May and published two months later under the title Primaute du spirituel. This book occasioned a series of violent attacks against Maritain in the pages of La Revue Universelle, and even an attempt to have his writings condemned by the Holy See. In December of that year, along with four theologians, Maritain published a defense of the papal condemnation called Pourquoi Rome a parle; he supplied the chapter \"Le sens de la condamnation de l'Action Frangaise.\" This was followed, two years later, by another book written by the same authors, Clair\\?ovance de Rome.\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n31\n\nMaritain suffered greatly to see so many of his longstanding friendships disintegrate because of the condemnation. He tried his best to save these friendships and seems to have done nothing to destroy them, beyond taking his position in favor of Rome and signing or publishing, as a matter of conscience, a number of political manifestos which opposed the positions taken by his former friends. In fact, as Massis himself admitted, the door at Meudon was always open. Maritain made little mention of Massis in his writings after 1927. He did, however, make repeated attempts, through his own efforts or indirectly through friends, to win Massis back to Rome. On the other hand, Massis' frequent and sometimes maudlin protestations of absolute fidelity to Maritain ring hollow in the face of some of his actions. He participated actively in a cabal to discredit Maritain before Rome and to have him condemned as a heretic. In 1936, Massis encouraged one of his collaborators at La Revue Universelle, a former pupil of Maritain's, Joseph Desclausais, to present the case against Maritain to the traditionalist and conservative theologians of the Roman Curia.62 This was not the first or the last of such attempts. Nor did Massis consider it inconsonant with his protestations of love and respect for Mari tain to encourage, both publicly and through private correspondence, a campaign of vilification against his friend. After the condemnation, as La Revue Universelle became more and more a mouthpiece of Action Franqaise, Maritain be came more and more uneasy in his role as philosophical editor. He was disturbed at being linked so closely to Massis after the publication of his Defense de l Occident. In an undated letter, written between June 27 and August 3, 1927, Maritain suggested that in the prospectus of the review, after the phrase \"Each of its collaborators writes under his own personal responsibility,\" the following sentence be inserted: “Primaute du spirituel is no more representative today of the position of Henri Massis than yesterday the Defense de VOccident was representative of the position of Jacques Maritain.\" Maritain had already spoken on several occasions to Massis of his possible resignation as philosophical editor, but now he wrote: Don't you think that in the present circumstances it would be better for all concerned if my collaboration on La Revue Universelle be considered at least as suspended until a new policy is established? I had already spoken to you in this\n\n32\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nregard more than a year ago, before this whole business of Action Franqaise. I wrote to you again recently [Apr. 31 and June 8, 1927] of this matter. Such a break seems to me very necessary.63 Massis showed the letter to Maurras, who asked him to try to persuade Maritain to remain as editor, and Massis wrote to his friend: Would that I could persuade you, my dear Jacques, not to abandon an undertaking which once seemed so useful to you and which, for my part, I find more indispensable than ever. Doubtless there is the problem of the publication of your book. As far as I am concerned, I will do everything in my power to see that it does not become the object of controversy and dissension, for the only one to profit from this would be our common adversary. . . . You have in mind, as I do, the audience of young people who are to continue our work. However sublime and perfect the words you speak to them may be, how will they understand them? How will they apply your advice? These young writers of today, you know them well, are not very brave in the face of the present crises; by every means possible they seek to escape, to flee . . . don't they despise [the intellect] in their own particular way by asking of it some possibility of escape? Halevy observed the other day: \"Dostoievsky, Proust, Bremond, Valery, every book they put out is another itinerary of retreat; they have all been followed.\" Won't some of them in their ignorance, weakness and cowardice interpret this “primaute du spirituel” in just this way in such troubled times as you remind them of? I fear that for many of them \"contemplation\" . . . may be a way of forgetting and losing themselves. . . . The pessimists, the worriers will discern in your statements a kind of \"hidden catastrophism\" which corresponds to their personal feelings and will only strengthen them. I understand very well that you have no intention of giving such advice: but I have already observed the depression that the reading of your book has caused in many sincere minds; they have neither the intellectual culture, nor the spiritual formation to fortify them against the false suggestions of their defeatist mentality. . . . \"There is nothing left but poetry,\" said one of them to me; \"There is nothing left but the spiritual,\" another will say —\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n33\n\nbut I'm afraid that they will understand these expressions in a rather anarchic manner and that they are closer to a Benda than to you. For, as in the past on the subject of Bergson, where you two seemed to agree, this critic now defends the \"transcendent\" and rises up against the \"religion of the temporal\" (NRF of Aug. 1); he too attacks nationalism and politics and opposes the \"real or practical mode of existence\" to the \"uninvolved metaphysical mode.\" Whether he is of the \"left\" or the \"right,\" the young Frenchman of today hears Benda and Maritain; in his mind, filled with vague notions, don't the voices of the two risk being confused in one single expression of abandon, in which his selfishness will find its justification?64 I quote this letter at length for it is filled with expressions that Massis, once Maritain had severed his connection with Action Frangaise and La Revue Universelle, again used, behind Maritain’s back, in an organized campaign to denigrate and discredit the former \"philosopher of Action Frangaise.\" For example, several months later at a banquet Massis gave a speech that was filled with snide allusions to Maritain and, to expose his \"friend\" to the ridicule of Massis' audience, employed the identical expressions he had used in his letter to attempt to win Maritain back to La Revue Universelle. After reading an account of the speech, Maritain protested to Massis (in a letter), in the name of their friendship, such treatment at his hands: I read the speech you gave at the Charles-Benoit banquet the day before yesterday. I cannot hide from you the fact that it caused me a great deal of pain. Before such an audience, whose baseness and whose trumped-up accusations against me you should have been able to appreciate, and who evidently understand in your words an allusion to my book Primaute du spirituel, it seems to me you could have abstained from such expressions as \"itinerary of retreat,\" \"under the pretext of metaphysics and transcendence,\" \"under the pretext of contemplation.\" It does no good to speak of contemplation in such terms, especially before such a bunch of roisterers! Either these cliches mean nothing, or they mean that to choose in favor of God is to make oneself \"inattentive to all reality,\" \"to refuse to come to grips with current events, etc. Come now! you know very well that in Primaute I did no more than recall the law of the gospels. . . .\n\n34\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nI would have preferred not to speak to you of these things. But I am forced to by what you have said. This banquet in itself was not a very clean affair. The mud slinging was manifest everywhere as well as the conniving to make people who in all other respects are obedient, at least exteriorly, to Rome, appear to be supporters of Action Frangaise. Up till now, my dear Henri, you have been able to show a certain amount of reserve. Now they have succeeded in linking you publicly with them.65 A year later (Oct. 25, 1928), when Maritain complained fagain in a letter) of lies circulated in an article by a certain Planhof and seconded by Pierre Tuc, and in which Massis seemed to be involved, Massis did not reply directly to Maritain's accusations and questions, but affected injured innocence: Do you really feel that it is necessary to interrogate me on such a matter? ... Is it not sad that I have to defend myself? I would have thought it unnecessary to assure you that there are certain things that I would not permit to be said about you in my presence. . . . And I am surprised that you should turn to me to establish the truth, as if I were an accomplice in the lies or the calumnies of which you so justly complain. The only excuse I find for this is your sadness. Mine is no less.66 Maritain believed Massis, but it wasn't long before he felt obliged to complain again to Massis about what a young man named Maxence had written about him, again with the apparent complicity of Massis, who again played the role of injured innocence: My dear Jacques, If you believed that no one could turn me against you and if you thought, as I think, that our friendship is not at the mercy of what someone or other may say, you would have spared me such questions. But why come to me? You should go to Maxence to get an explanation of his conduct in your regard. I gave him the assignment of furnishing you an explanation.67 Needless to say, in spite of the \"assignment\" Massis had given him, Maxence \"carefully abstained from furnishing the slightest explanation.\"68\n\nAction Frangaise: Maurras, Massis, Maritain\n\n35\n\nWhen Massis’ manifesto for the \"defense of the West\" appeared in 1934, Maritain wrote to him that on the relation of the Christian faith to temporal affairs, their judgments were becoming more and more divergent. Two years later, Massis, now the editor in chief of La Revue Universelle, published a vicious and unjust attack on Maritain, filled with deliberate misrepresentations, by a certain Joseph Desclausais, whom (as we saw) Massis and his cohorts sent to Rome to seek Maritain’s condemnation by the Holy Office. On June 18, 1936, Maritain protested this traitorous treatment: I cannot tell you what pain I felt, not because of what the author of the article has done, but because of what you have done. That you should criticize my position, or have it criticized, that is your right. But you know how to read texts, and you have doubtless read mine. To permit the thought of a friend to be disfigured, and in such a flagrant manner, and in the very review which you edit, is something I would not have expected of you. I suppose that after reflection you will perceive how unheard of this manner of acting with me really is.69 Massis' covert attacks and sniper tactics continued as late as 1953. Two months after the death of Maurras, he took charge of publishing — posthumously —Le Bienheureux Pie X, sauveur de la France, in which Maurras tried to establish the innocence of Action Frangaise by showing that a former pope, whose cause for canonization had been begun and who had already been declared \"Blessed,\" had given his approval to the very things for which the present pope had condemned the movement. Massis attached an appendix to the book which again accused Maritain of the \"heresies\" for which he had failed to have the philosopher condemned years before. Michel Mourre, in his book Charles Maurras, reproached Massis for the flagrant injustice of this inclusion: One is saddened to find at the end of this volume an appendix that is violently unjust to M. Jacques Maritain. To accuse him of Modernism only shows a complete ignorance of the thought and personality of the author of Antimoderne and of Humanisme integral and that he is being judged according to a miserable caricature.70 In 1951, when Maritain, at the height of his prestige, was receiving signal honors and serving in positions of national and\n\n36\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\ninternational responsibility,71 Massis expressed his pity for this poor, deluded philosopher, who — according to Massis — had been checked by personal failure in his ambition to restore Christian philosophy; abandoned by his true disciples of the right, \"who drink at other springs\"; ridiculed by his pseudo disciples of the left, who \"make fun of his 'retrograde scholasticism' \"; and disregarded by the world, which found his ideas \"out of touch and passe.” \"In the twilight of his life,\" he said, \"Maritain is alone.\"72 But Massis made the same statements about Duhamel, Bernanos, Mauriac, Drieu de la Rochelle, Montherlant and Malraux.73 Whoever abandoned the friendship of Massis was a \"miserable creature\" who finished his days in solitude and regret. Everyone else was \"alone\" because they had wandered off to other friends and companions.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nAction Frangaise: Bernanos, Massis, Maritain\n\nTHE 1926-27 CRISIS OF Action Frangaise was a stumbling block\n\non which many famous friendships fell in pieces. The friendship between Georges Bernanos and Jacques Maritain, which had just begun when the papal condemnation fell on Action Frangaise, was one of such casualties. However, the rift between the two intellectual leaders was far less serious than would seem to be indicated by Bernanos' occasional fulmination and caustic asides at Maritain’s expense, which built a wall between the two that was broken down only with great difficulty and after a long time. But beginning in 1935, the names of Bernanos and Maritain became more and more associated in the public eye because of their common position on many political and social questions, and after the Second World War, it was through the good offices of Jacques Maritain that Bernanos met Dominican Father Raymond Bruckberger, who was to produce the movie version of his Dialogue des Carmelites. It was the same Father Bruckberger who wrote to Maritain, after the war, begging him to intercede with the authorities in France to help bring Bernanos back to his homeland.1 When Bernanos finished the manuscript of his novel Sous le soleil de Satan in 1926, it was to Maritain that he confided it for criticism and for possible publication. Maritain was enthusiastic, he hailed Bernanos as the first in a new generation of Catholic authors who would renew the religious and literary inspiration of France. Despite the numerous conversions among literary figures during the early twenties, no first-rate Catholic novelist had appeared on the horizon. Psichari and Alain-Fournier were dead, and many considered Mauriac too lenient toward the sins of the flesh. The novels of Paul Bourget and Henri Bordeaux had missed 37\n\n38\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nthe heart of the matter, confusing religion with the religious issue and with the bourgeois conservatism of the complacent pharasaical Catholics of the French middle class, whom Bernanos called the bien-pensants. Bernanos went directly to the point in his probing analysis of passion, sin and evil, though there were political overtones in the novel, to be sure. Bernanos said that he wanted to throw a saint (Abbe Donisson) in the face of the idiotically jubilant politicians who shouted their slogans of victory after the First World War. Disillusionment with the men of 1920, he claimed, drove him to write the novel.I 2 But these political overtones, in Maritain's estimation, in no way lessened the artistic merits of the novel. Sous le soleil de Satan was in a sense a succes de scandale in 1926, not so much because it expressed, through fictitious characters, the author's contempt for real statesmen who imposed on the nation the slogans and sentiments of a false patriotism, but because it portrayed the Devil as a living, active, personal force for evil. Abbe Donisson actually meets Satan one night, passing through the fields. A generation of cynics could only respond to such a naive conception of evil with contemptuous smiles; but for Bernanos, evil was a person, \"alive and squirming,\" and he spoke from a conviction of absolute faith. Maritain shared this conviction, and the first edition of Sous le soleil de Satan appeared in April 1926 in Maritain's Roseau d’Or collection. Maritain had been anxious about the effect of the novel in certain Catholic circles. Pius XI, following the example of Leo XIII, had shown himself quite favorable to the liberal Catholic camp, and too bold a criticism of the liberal position at the moment when the pope was attempting a rapprochement with the Republic might not be well received in Rome. On the other hand, the novel applied the goad unmercifully to the hypocritical consciences of the bien-pensants. Bernanos, who enjoyed nothing more than scandalizing these complacent Catholic pharisees, was slashing right and left. Uneasy at the boldness of Bernanos' attack, Maritain suggested certain changes, which Bernanos accepted out of respect for their friendship, and he wrote to Massis about Maritain’s fears: I just received a letter from Maritain; he has suggested several corrections that I am going to try to make out of love for him. . . . Maritain's affectionate confidence does me a great honor and I will try to return it as best I can.\n\nAction Frangaise: Bemanos, Massis, Maritain\n\n39\n\nNevertheless I find his scruples a bit exaggerated. Undoubtedly God appears in my book as a rather hard taskmaster! So what? What can we say about Him who is found at the root of every one of our sufferings and almost always absent from our joys? But then, how could I avoid scandalizing certain little effeminate souls? That's a part of my very nature. The blood of the cross frightens them. Perhaps a single drop of it is enough to redeem them. For my part, I must plunge myself in it completely. Alas! I still haven't begun to work out my salvation with much care and attention!3 No sooner had the novel appeared than Maritain heard rumors that Bernanos was running the risk of censure in Rome. Maritain communicated his anxiety to Massis, whom he asked to get in touch with Father Garrigou-Lagrange and to pass on to the latter the judgment of Father Gillet, master general of the Dominicans, about the novel. Father Gillet had told Maritain personally how much he would deplore the censure of a novel which he esteemed so highly,4 and Maritain knew that the opinion of these two men would weigh heavily in Rome. At any rate, the book escaped censure, Bernanos was grateful to Maritain for such efforts in his behalf, and Sous le soleil de Satan made such an impression on the literary world that Frederic Lefevre considered Bernanos worthy of an interview for his regular column in La Nouvelle Revue Franqaise. In answer to a question about intellectual cowardice, Bernanos chose Maritain as an example of intellectual integrity and courage: In order to take the place due to him [Maritain], besides the visible sign of the highest predestination, he needed that unflagging patience, that kind of heavenly stubbornness which comes to the surface in his eyes like the reflection of another world.5 Nevertheless, the beginnings of friendship between the two men did not last long, for within a few months Bernanos expressions of admiration were to change to vitriolic abuse. When Maritain took a position in favor of Rome against Action Frangaise at the end of the year, Bernanos turned upon him with the full violence of his wrath.\n\n40\n\nJacques Maritain and the French Catholic Intellectuals\n\nIn ma"
