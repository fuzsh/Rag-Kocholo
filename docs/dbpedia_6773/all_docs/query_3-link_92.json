        "text": "The paper is focused on the impact of philosophical ideology of Jacque Maritain -one of the most prominent French philosophers of XX century - onto modern concept of human rights in their legal implementation. The perspectives of Maritain's basic developments for modern democracy are proved to be rather promising. J. Maritain was the first one who managed to unite philosophical anthropological theory (personalism) with actual participation in elaboration of the ideas of human rights oriented against totalitarian offence against the liberty of a person. An author of more than 60 books, J. Maritain helped to revive St. Thomas Aquinas for modern times and is the principal drafter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The foundation of Maritain's thought lays in Aristotle, St. Thomas and the Thomistic treatments. Maritain was a strong defender of a natural law ethics. He viewed ethical norms as being rooted in human nature. For Maritain the natural law is known primarily, not through philosophical argument and demonstration, but rather through \"Connaturality\". Connatural knowledge is a kind of knowledge by acquaintance. We know the natural law through our direct acquaintance with it in our human experience. Of central importance, is Maritain's argument that natural rights are rooted in the natural law? This was the key to his involvement in the drafting of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nWhen the U.N. Human Rights Commission began to draw up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1947, they immediately discovered that human rights were much easier to invoke than to define. Would these rights be pre-existing or aspiring; individual or collective; secular or God-given; government-proof or government-endowed? The inordinately long debates about the Declaration’s first article signalled the magnitude of the task ahead. The Declaration that emerged was not a radical document. Rather, it accurately reflected the conservative social mores and liberal economic values of the immediate post-war era. It proclaimed trade union rights and the right to enter into and dissolve marriage freely, but also re-affirmed the family as the ‘natural and fundamental group unit in society’ and carefully re-asserted ‘the right to own property’. Even so, the drafters feared that they had not been circumspect enough. So although it was intended to be a statement of principles, the drafters slipped in a qualifying article — Article 29 — towards the end. This reminded the world that the individual bearer of rights also has ‘duties to the community’, and that the exercise of rights and freedoms must meet ‘the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society’. This cautious belt-and-braces approach set the pattern for human rights treaties in the future. In the decades that followed, a clear pattern emerged: human rights always came to the fore at moments when other ideals were exhausted or ineffective. The issue initially enjoyed a brief but significant period of ascendancy in the 1940s, when there was widespread revulsion at the carnage of World War II, and the Western powers’ notions of racial superiority had been discredited by the horrors of fascism. Thereafter, it waxed and waned inversely with the Cold War, always assuming a more prominent role when anti-communism — the other great Western ideology of the post-war decades — lost its momentum. Human rights were thus subordinated to anti-communism in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1980s, but enjoyed a renaissance during the détente years of the 1970s, and in the present post-Cold War era."
