        "text": "When I first saw Peter Maurin* my impression was of a short, broad-shouldered workingman with a high, broad head covered with greying hair. His face was weatherbeaten, he had warm grey eyes and a wide, pleasant mouth. The collar of his shirt was dirty, but he had tried to dress up by wearing a tie and a suit which looked as though he had slept in it. (As I found out afterward, indeed he had.)\n\nWhat struck me first about him was that he was one of those people who talked you deaf, dumb and blind, who each time he saw you began his conversation just where he had left off at the previous meeting, and never stopped unless you begged for rest, and that was not for long. He was irrepressible and he was incapable of taking offense.\n\nThe night I met Peter I had come from an assignment for The Commonweal, covering the Communist-inspired “hunger march” of the unemployed to Washington. I had prayed at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, that I might find something to do in the social order besides reporting conditions. I wanted to change them, not just report them, but I had lost faith in revolution. I wanted to love my enemy, whether capitalist or Communist.\n\nI certainly did not realize at first that I had my answer in Peter Maurin. I was thirty-five years old and I had met plenty of radicals in my time and plenty of crackpots, too: people who had blueprints to change the social order were a dime a dozen around Union Square.\n\nAt that time Peter Maurin was fifty-seven, had never married, had been “away from the Church” in his youth, had worked with Sangnier and his social studies group in Paris, and had sold its paper, Le Sillon. He believed in going to the people in town and countryside, because first of all he was of the people himself.\n\nHe constantly urged individuals to practice the corporal and spiritual works of mercy; he urged Bishops to establish Houses of Hospitality. Somehow the two planks of the program got mixed up. I can remember well enough how it happened. He had written a series of essays addressed to the Bishops, pointing out to them that canon law called for the establishment of hospices in every bishopric. When a reader who had been sleeping in the subway came into The Catholic Worker office one day and disclosed her need (the apartment and the office were already full), Peter’s literal acceptance of “If thy brother needs food or drink, feed him, and if he needs shelter, shelter him” meant that we rented a large apartment a block away which became the first House of Hospitality for women. This apartment expanded into three apartments and a store, then into a house, and finally into a twenty-room tenement house at 115 Mott Street. Eventually it included four additional apartments and two stores; then to become a double house at 223 Chrystie Street, New York City. Now we are in a loft on Spring Street, with eight apartments in the neighborhood. Here the works of mercy are still being practiced by the group who get out The Catholic Worker, living without salaries, in voluntary poverty. “Feeding thy brother” started with feeding a few poor men. It became a daily breadline in 1936, and the line still forms every day outside the door.\n\nRound-table Discussions, Houses of Hospitality and Farming Communes–those were the three planks in Peter Maurin’s platform. Despite war and re-employment which took many of our workers from us, there are still Houses of Hospitality, each autonomous but inspired by Peter, each trying to follow Peter’s principles. And there are farms, all different but all starting with the idea of the personalist and communitarian revolution–to use Emmanuel Mounier’s phrase. Peter was not disappointed in his life’s work. He had given everything he had and he asked for nothing, least of all for success. He gave himself, and–at the end–God took from him the power to think.\n\nHe was docile and accepted his condition, though one could see the pain and struggle in his eyes. He, who had talked so much, became completely silent. For the last five years of his life he had to be served like a child, told when to go to bed, when to arise, what to eat, what to put on. He was the one led, rather than the leader.\n\nHe was anointed at Easton, Pennsylvania, for a bad heart condition, and a few years later, on May 15, 1949, he died at Maryfarm in Newburgh, New York. When his requiem was sung all the congregation who attended sang the Mass gloriously, triumphantly, joyously. Garbed in a donated suit of clothes, he was buried in a donated grave in St. John’s Cemetery, Brooklyn.\n\nObituaries were found not only in The Industrial Worker, a Chicago I.W.W. paper which is on the subversive list, but also in Osservatore Romano in Vatican City, which carried its notice on the front page.\n\nGod has taken him into Paradise, with Lazarus who once was poor. May He bring us, too, to a place of refreshment, light and peace.\n\nDOROTHY DAY\n\n*Much of this material appeared in Jubilee, March, 1960. (Copyright 1960 by the A.M.D.G. Publishing Co.) as “I Remember Peter Maurin.” We gratefully acknowledge permission to use it.\n\nOn May Day, 1983 The Catholic Worker movement marked its 50th anniversary. A mass of thanksgiving filled Nativity Church on New York’s Lower East Side. Celebrations followed at Maryhouse, on East Third Street, the home for homeless women among whom Dorothy Day died in November 1980, and at St. Joseph House at 36 East First Street.\n\nIt was on May 1st, 1933 that Dorothy Day, accompanied by Joseph Bennett, first distributed The Catholic Worker in Union Square where 50,000 people gathered shoulder to shoulder to announce the coming revolution and denounce the economic system they blamed for a savage depression. Peter Maurin, the man who had stimulated Dorothy Day to start “a paper for the man in the street,” was not with her. His ideas were. Dorothy passed them out, along with her own vivid reporting of conditions, to the angry, the workless, the poor, to those who saw the Catholic Church as having nothing to say to their plight–or to the social evils in which they were trapped.\n\nThe front page of the tabloid’s initial issue carried the first of the “easy essays” in this collection, “Blowing the Dynamite.” Maurin’s program was to “blow the lid off” the social program of the Church, a program hidden by Catholic scholars who had\n\n“wrapped it up\n\nin nice phraseology,\n\nplaced it in a hermetic container\n\nand sat on the lid.”\n\nOn May 1st, 1983, two of us walked in Dorothy Day’s footsteps in Union Square at Fourteenth Street to distribute the twelve-page anniversary issue of The Catholic Worker. Joseph Zarella had been a full-time volunteer at the Catholic Worker when Peter Maurin was in his prime, in the years from 1935 to 1942. Zarella had travelled with Peter Maurin in 1936 to visit the newly founded houses of the Catholic Worker movement. He remembered the talks that Maurin had given to the struggling groups, as well as to monasteries, seminaries and parishes throughout the country. I had encountered Maurin in the early nineteen forties on visits to the Catholic Worker. What we most remembered about Maurin was his utter selflessness, his total absorption in the message he was impelled to share. We cherish the memory of that craggy face, illuminated from within, as he delivered the carefully phrased concepts. We recall what it was like to have the index finger of that broad peasant hand brandished before our faces as Maurin “made his points.” It was these “points,” lived out dramatically by Dorothy Day, and enfleshed not only in her memorable writing but in the C. W. movement, that captured the minds of young people and set them on fire with zeal to remake the world.\n\nThe Union Square of 1983 was no longer the hot-bed of revolution, packed with people “impatient to assume the world.” It was a haven for a few people who claimed the benches to pass a sunlit afternoon, most of them bedraggled and many stretched out, sodden with drink or drugs. The Square had become a center of drug-trafficking, and the only sign of the old militancy was a slogan painted in black letters on the monument to the Union dead, “Overthrow capitalism source of 98% of crime.” Not only Union Square had changed as to almost unrecognizable in the intervening half-century, but so had the state of society and of the world at large.\n\nA World War had swept millions through the doors of death, some killed by indiscriminate weaponry, others done to death in unspeakably discriminate destruction on the basis of their race. Violent revolutions had maintained themselves in power through continued violence against untold millions in the Eurasian heartland. Stockpiles of nuclear weaponry, to say nothing of nuclear energy plants, have given us a world pulsating with death. National leaders justify the possession of weapons capable of incinerating the populations of cities by a policy known as “deterrence,” namely, the policy of “dissuading” the other side through terror. Many are reminded of the principle of Noah, in which the Creator made known, by the rainbow sign after the flood, that He would not again interfere with the operation of the cosmos. Humankind, possessing the power wrenched from the heart of the atom, can now threaten the planet itself. In the economic order, the national debt of the United States has risen to unthinkable billions, with a third of the annual budget going into debt servicing. The combined debt of Third World countries has reached astronomic proportions, threatening to bring down the banking systems of First World countries which had been eager to lend at high interest in what they considered secured loans.\n\nDoes Peter Maurin’s message speak to generations facing the Third Millennium? Dorothy Day grasped the crucial fact that Maurin was propounding perennial values, values that he had synthesized from the Gospel and the wisdom of the Church and its saints–as well as from thinkers, philosophers and economists studied in the course of a lifetime. In these pages is the distillation of a lifetime of study and prayer. Aside from such general concepts as “the common good” whose implications are so little understood, Maurin presented in the briefest manner possible, the specifics for example, of economic history. Where else could one find an outline of economics comparable to that contained in “In the Light of History,” that begins on page 78.\n\nHere are contained the values that the Catholic Worker, now counting over eighty houses and communities in the United States, has tried to incarnate, and which are discussed in the paper which goes around the world in over 100,000 copies.\n\nAs readers dip into these phrased essays, they will find values so old they seem new, that “blow the lid off” many false values by which too many professed Christians order their lives.\n\nI will limit myself to two of Maurin’s bedrock concepts that indicate clearly that the “established order” which so many Christians accept, is, in fact, in Emmanuel Mounier’s phrase, an “established disorder.” The two concepts are Maurin’s emphasis on the necessity of the “daily practice of the works of mercy,” and his resurrection of the ban on usury, the taking or charging of interest.\n\nThe “daily practice of the works of mercy,” Maurin insisted, was the distinguishing mark of the followers of Jesus. Performing them without interruption would demand a rejection of war, since in war, all the works of mercy, from feeding the hungry to sheltering the shelterless, are interrupted or obscenely reversed. If there are hungry and homeless people around us, they must be fed and sheltered, not by impersonal state systems, but at personal sacrifices by individuals and communities. Thus there is need for Houses of Hospitality. Maurin thought that every parish should have such a house of refuge. He would have approved of a development in the eighties, when Catholic parishes in New York City provided shelter for the homeless, with parishioners taking turns as volunteers.\n\nThe spiritual works of mercy, Maurin stressed, make it incumbent on scholars to share their knowledge with workers. Workers, in their turn, could help scholars with their skills and acquaint them with the realities of their situation. Only in this way could workers become scholars and scholars workers. The ramifications of mercy, which is only love under the aspect of need, are endless. Works of mercy can only be performed for a person, and the heart of Maurin’s message was the inviolable dignity of the person as image of his Creator. He introduced a term from the works of the French writer and philosopher, Emmanuel Mounier, personalism.\n\nEven more controversial than its rejection of the violence of war and revolution was the Catholic Worker’s rejection of interest. The ancient ban on usury (meaning simply interest) by the Church Fathers and the Prophets of Israel has fallen into disuse. Money was not supposed to breed money. Here the ethos of the profit system and the ethos of the Gospel collide. The Gospel has a clear injunction regarding our surplus possessions and funds. They are to be used to meet the needs of those who lack necessities. The ethos of a profit economy calls for surplus funds to be banked or invested so that they may increase by means of interest. The source of the increase in riches becomes a matter of indifference rather than of moral concern.\n\nWhere only an increase of riches or profit matters, then economic activity has at its heart an ethical void. All manner of unjust economic structures may grow and flourish and all manner of exploitation may abound. Work is taken to the places where labor is cheapest and workers have fewest rights.\n\nIf surpluses are used in charity, or in cooperatives for human purposes such as home-building for the less affluent, life necessarily becomes simpler and the ideal of voluntary poverty cannot be far behind. The Christian doctrine of property becomes a reality, namely the retaining of a sufficiency of goods for an adequate life and the sharing of the remainder with the needy. In point of fact, millions of Christians, working for wages, actually live out this teaching on property. How else do we explain the world-wide network of the works of mercy supported by the small gifts of the many, Though there are Catholic millionaires, the masses of Catholics are rather the victims than the beneficiaries of corporations as they roam about the world seeking profits.\n\nMaurin found “concordances” even with the radical IWW (the International Workers of the World), and he often quoted their slogan on “building the new society within the shell of the old.” Maurin’s revolution was personalist and communitarian, to be achieved without violence and without recourse to the class struggle or to the rhetoric of class confrontation. He helped people transcend the tyranny of false alternatives.\n\nPeter Maurin attended Mass daily, calling it “the greatest act of love between God and His children.” His prophetic task was to indicate the paths by which this love could be incarnated in daily living. In his “easy essays,” we find the hard sayings of the Gospel and ways to apply them to society. His message calls for changing society through transforming the “old creature” into the “new creature” of the Gospel. Unjust structures will never be replaced unless they are first replaced in the heart.\n\nThe riches of Maurin’s prophetic message, more alive than ever in a time of moral and economic crisis, are here for all to plumb, not only Catholics, but all who hunger for a more peaceful and just society, “where it is easier for people to be good.”\n\nEILEEN EGAN\n\n[An address by Peter Maurin to the unemployed at a meeting held in September, 1933, at Manhattan Lyceum, and published in THE CATHOLIC WORKER, (October, 1933) in order that it might be sent to all the Bishops and Archbishops meeting at the National Conference of Catholic Charities in New York.]\n\nThe Duty of Hospitality\n\nPeople who are in need\n\nand are not afraid to beg\n\ngive to people not in need\n\nthe occasion to do good\n\nfor goodness’ sake.\n\nModern society calls the beggar\n\nbum and panhandler\n\nand gives him the bum’s rush.\n\nBut the Greeks used to say\n\nthat people in need\n\nare the ambassadors of the gods.\n\nAlthough you may be called\n\nbums and panhandlers\n\nyou are in fact the Ambassadors of God.\n\nAs God’s Ambassadors\n\nyou should be given food,\n\nclothing and shelter\n\nby those who are able to give it.\n\nMahometan teachers tell us\n\nthat God commands hospitality,\n\nand hospitality is still practiced\n\nin Mahometan countries.\n\nBut the duty of hospitality\n\nis neither taught nor practiced\n\nin Christian countries.\n\nThe Municipal Lodgings\n\nThat is why you who are in need\n\nare not invited to spend the night\n\nin the homes of the rich.\n\nThere are guest rooms today\n\nin the homes of the rich\n\nbut they are not for those who need them.\n\nAnd they are not for those who need them\n\nbecause those who need them\n\nare no longer considered\n\nas the Ambassadors of God.\n\nSo people no longer consider\n\nhospitality to the poor\n\nas a personal duty.\n\nAnd it does not disturb them a bit\n\nto send them to the city,\n\nwhere they are given the\n\nhospitality of the “Muni”\n\nat the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nBut the hospitality that the\n\n“Muni” gives to the down and out\n\nis no hospitality\n\nbecause what comes from the\n\ntaxpayer’s pocketbook\n\ndoes not come from his heart.\n\nBack to Hospitality\n\nThe Catholic unemployed\n\nshould not be sent to the “Muni.”\n\nThe Catholic unemployed\n\nshould be given hospitality\n\nin Catholic Houses of Hospitality.\n\nCatholic Houses of Hospitality\n\nare known in Europe\n\nunder the name of hospices.\n\nThere have been hospices in Europe\n\nsince the time of Constantine.\n\nHospices are free guest houses;\n\nhotels are paying guest houses.\n\nAnd paying guest houses or hotels\n\nare as plentiful\n\nas free guest houses or hospices\n\nare scarce.\n\nSo hospitality, like everything else,\n\nhas been commercialized.\n\nSo hospitality, like everything else,\n\nmust now be idealized.\n\nHouses of Hospitality\n\nWe need Houses of Hospitality\n\nto give to the rich\n\nthe opportunity to serve the poor.\n\nWe need Houses of Hospitality\n\nto bring the Bishops to the people\n\nand the people to the Bishops.\n\nWe need Houses of Hospitality\n\nto bring back to institutions\n\nthe technique of institutions.\n\nWe need Houses of Hospitality\n\nto show what idealism looks like\n\nwhen it is practiced.\n\nWe need Houses of Hospitality\n\nto bring social justice\n\nthrough Catholic Action\n\nexercised in Catholic institutions.\n\nHospices\n\nWe read in the Catholic Encyclopedia\n\nthat during the early ages of Christianity\n\nthe hospice (or the House of Hospitality)\n\nwas a shelter for the sick, the poor,\n\nthe orphans, the old, the traveler,\n\nand the needy of every kind.\n\nOriginally the hospices (or\n\nHouses of Hospitality)\n\nwere under the supervision of the Bishops,\n\nwho designated priests\n\nto administer the spiritual\n\nand temporal affairs\n\nof these charitable institutions.\n\nThe fourteenth statute\n\nof the so-called Council of Carthage,\n\nheld about 436,\n\nenjoins upon the Bishops\n\nto have hospices (or Houses of Hospitality)\n\nin connection with their churches.\n\nParish Houses of Hospitality\n\nToday we need Houses of Hospitality\n\nas much as they needed them then.\n\nif not more so.\n\nWe have Parish Houses for the priests,\n\nParish Houses for educational purposes,\n\nParish Houses for recreational purposes,\n\nbut no Parish Houses of Hospitality.\n\nBossuet says that the poor\n\nare the first children of the Church.\n\nso the poor should come first.\n\nPeople with homes should\n\nhave a room of hospitality.\n\nSo as to give shelter\n\nto the needy members\n\nof the parish.\n\nThe remaining needy\n\nmembers of the parish\n\nshould be given shelter in a Parish Home.\n\nFurniture, clothing, and food\n\nshould be sent to the needy\n\nmembers of the parish\n\nat the Parish House of Hospitality.\n\nWe need Parish Homes\n\nas well as Parish Domes.\n\nIn the new Cathedral of Liverpool\n\nthere will be a Home\n\nas well as a dome.\n\nHouses of “Catholic Action”\n\nCatholic Houses of Hospitality\n\nshould be more than free guest houses\n\nfor the Catholic unemployed.\n\nThey could be vocational training schools,\n\nincluding the training for the priesthood,\n\nas Father Corbett proposes.\n\nThey could be Catholic reading rooms,\n\nas Father McSorley proposes.\n\nThey could be Catholic Instruction Schools,\n\nas Father Cornelius Hayes proposes.\n\nThey could be Round-Table\n\nDiscussion Groups,\n\nas Peter Maurin proposes.\n\nIn a word, they could be\n\nCatholic Action Houses,\n\nwhere Catholic Thought\n\nis combined with Catholic Action.\n\nTo Be a Marxian\n\nBefore he died, Karl Marx\n\ntold one of his friends,\n\n“I have lived long enough to\n\nbe able to say\n\nthat I am not a Marxian.”\n\nTo be a Marxian, according to\n\nthe logic of Das Kapital,\n\nis to maintain that the best thing to do\n\nis to wait patiently till capitalism\n\nhas fulfilled its historic mission.\n\nTo be a Marxian, according to\n\nthe logic of Das Kapital,\n\nis to step back, take an\n\nacademic view of things\n\nand watch the self-satisfied capitalists\n\ndig their own graves.\n\nTo be a Marxian, according to\n\nthe logic of Das Kapital,\n\nis to have faith in the forces of\n\nmaterialism–\n\nforces so powerful, according\n\nto materialists,\n\nthat they will bring the millennium\n\nwhether man wants it or not.\n\nTo be a Marxian, according to\n\nthe logic of Das Kapital,\n\nis to let economic evolution do its work\n\nwithout ever attempting to give it a push.\n\nWhat Karl Marx Realized\n\nKarl Marx soon realized\n\nthat his own analysis of bourgeois society\n\ncould not be the basis\n\nof a dynamic revolutionary movement.\n\nKarl Marx soon realized\n\nthat a forceful Communist Manifesto\n\nwas the necessary foundation\n\nof a dynamic Communist Movement.\n\nKarl Marx soon realized.\n\nas Lenin realized,\n\nthat there is no revolution\n\nwithout revolutionary action,\n\nthat there is no revolutionary action\n\nwithout a revolutionary movement.\n\nthat there is no revolutionary movement\n\nwithout a vanguard of revolution,\n\nand that there is no vanguard\n\nof revolution\n\nwithout a theory of revolution.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto\n\nHaving realized that a\n\nCommunist Manifesto\n\nwas the basis of a Communist Movement,\n\nKarl Marx decided to write\n\na Communist Manifesto.\n\nTo write the Communist Manifesto\n\nKarl Marx did not use his\n\nanalysis of capitalism.\n\nHe took the definition of\n\nCommunism of Proudhon\n\nand made it his own.\n\nHe borrowed Utopian\n\ncriticism and Utopian aims\n\nand decided to advocate class-struggle,\n\nthat is to say, materialist aims.\n\nAs some people used to think\n\nthat we need a good honest war\n\nto end all wars,\n\nKarl Marx used to think\n\nthat we need a gigantic class-struggle\n\nto bring about a classless society.\n\nFor Catholic Action\n\nWe Catholics have a better criticism\n\nof bourgeois society\n\nthan Victor Considerant’s criticism.\n\nused by Karl Marx.\n\nOur criticism of bourgeois society\n\nis the criticism of St. Thomas More.\n\nWe Catholics have a better\n\nconception of Communism\n\nthan the conception of Proudhon.\n\nOur conception of Communism\n\nis the conception of St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nin his doctrine of the “Common Good.”\n\nWe Catholics have better means\n\nthan the means proposed by Karl Marx.\n\nOur means to realize the “Common Good”\n\nare embodied in Catholic Action.\n\nCatholic Action is action by Catholics\n\nfor Catholics and non-Catholics.\n\nWe don’t want to take over the control\n\nof political and economic life.\n\nWe want to reconstruct the social order\n\nthrough Catholic Action\n\nexercised in Catholic\n\ninstitutions.\n\nThe Bishops’ Program\n\nShortly after the war\n\nBishops of America\n\nformulated a Program of\n\nSocial Reconstruction\n\nlargely based on co-operation.\n\nBut the Bishops’ Program\n\nfailed to materialize\n\nfor lack of co-operators.\n\nCatholic laymen and women\n\nwere more interested\n\nin a laissez-faire economy.\n\nSo Catholic laymen and women\n\nwent back to Normalcy with Harding;\n\nthey tried to Keep Cool with Coolidge,\n\nand then to See Rosy with Roosevelt.\n\nCatholic laymen and women\n\nare more interested\n\nin political action\n\nthan they are interested\n\nin Catholic Action.\n\nCatholic laymen and women\n\nare more ready to follow\n\nthe leadership of the politicians\n\nthan they are ready to follow\n\nthe leadership of the Bishops.\n\nReconstructing the Social Order\n\nThe Holy Father and the Bishops ask us\n\nto reconstruct the social order.\n\nThe social order was once constructed\n\nthrough dynamic Catholic Action.\n\nWhen the barbarians invaded\n\nthe decaying Roman Empire\n\nIrish missionaries went all over Europe\n\nand laid the foundations of medieval Europe.\n\nThrough the establishment of\n\ncultural centers,\n\nthat is to say, Round-Table Discussions,\n\nthey brought thought to the people.\n\nThrough free guest houses,\n\nthat is to say, Houses of Hospitality,\n\nthey popularized the divine\n\nvirtue of charity.\n\nThrough farming colonies,\n\nthat is to say, Agronomic Universities,\n\nthey emphasized voluntary poverty.\n\nIt was on the basis of personal charity\n\nand voluntary poverty\n\nthat Irish missionaries\n\nlaid the foundations\n\nof the social order.\n\nTwo years ago\n\nI went to see Professor Moley,\n\nformer head\n\nof President Roosevelt’s Brain Trust,\n\nand said to him:\n\n“I came here to find out\n\nif I could make an impression\n\non the depression\n\nby starting a rumpus\n\non the campus.\n\nBut I found out\n\nthat agitation is not rampant\n\non the campus.\n\nOnly business is rampant on the campus,\n\nalthough business is the bunk.\n\n“May be,” said I\n\n“history cannot be made\n\non the campus.”\n\nAnd turning toward his secretary,\n\nProfessor Moley said:\n\n“That’s right,\n\nwe don’t make history\n\non the campus,\n\nwe only teach it.”\n\nAnd because history is taught\n\nbut not made\n\non the campus of our universities.\n\nthe Catholic Worker\n\nis trying to make history\n\non Union Square,\n\nwhere people have nothing to lose.\n\nA battle royal is raging\n\nbetween East and West,\n\nbetween stock speculators\n\nand land speculators,\n\nbetween money lenders\n\nand money borrowers.\n\nTo go back to the gold standard,\n\nas the so-called “sound\n\nmoney” people propose,\n\nis to favor the money lenders\n\nat the expense of the money borrowers.\n\nTo increase the amount of currency,\n\nas the mild inflationists propose,\n\nis to favor the money borrowers\n\nat the expense of the money lenders.\n\nTo devise schemes\n\nso as to bring about a rise in prices\n\nis to favor both money lenders\n\nand money borrowers\n\nat the expense of the consuming public.\n\nWe made the mistake\n\nof running business on credit\n\nand credit has run into debts\n\nand debts are leading us\n\ntoward bankruptcy.\n\nThe Jews had a way\n\nof wiping off the slate.\n\nEvery fifty years,\n\nthe year of the Jewish Jubilee,\n\nall debts were liquidated.\n\nBut nobody,\n\nnot even the Jews.\n\nproposes this old-time solution.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes,\n\nthe well-known English economist, says\n\nthat we ought to ask ourselves\n\nif the medieval economists\n\nwere not sound\n\nin condemning money-lending\n\nat interest.\n\nIn his book\n\non Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,\n\nR.

(March, 1934.)]\n\nDear Mike:\n\nIn my answer to a reader\n\nfrom Bellingham, Washington,\n\nI said most organizations exist,\n\nnot for the benefit of the organized\n\nbut for the benefit of the organizers.\n\nI added that when the organizers\n\ntry to organize the unorganized\n\nthey do not organize themselves.\n\nWhen I wrote that\n\nI did not have in mind\n\nthe Catholic Labor Guild in Brooklyn.\n\nI had in mind\n\nsome selfish exploiters\n\nof the exploitation of the exploited\n\nwho like to be called labor leaders.\n\nI had in mind\n\nsome exalted rulers of secret societies\n\nwho, while they call themselves Masons,\n\nhave not yet learned\n\nto create order out of chaos.\n\nI had in mind\n\nsome dignified regulators\n\nof societies which have some secrets\n\nwithout being called secret societies.\n\nWhile I don’t like some of your ideas,\n\nI like you personally.\n\nI think that you are much better\n\nthan some of your ideas.\n\nI think that you are inclined\n\nto lead a life of sacrifice.\n\nDuring the World War you placed your life\n\nat the service of the British Empire.\n\nAfter the war, you placed your life\n\nat the service of the Irish Republic.\n\nAnd now you have placed your life\n\nat the service of the Church.\n\nYou and your fellow workers\n\nof the Catholic Labor Guild\n\nare trying to combine\n\nprayer, action, and sacrifice,\n\nas the Holy Father suggests.\n\nYou and your fellow workers\n\nwant to be go-givers,\n\nyou don’t want to be go-getters.\n\nSince you and your fellow workers\n\nwant to be go-givers,\n\nyou ought to give\n\nto those who are in need of giving.\n\nTo give to people who have money to lend\n\nis to give to people who are not in need.\n\nPeople who have money\n\nshould do good with their money,\n\neither give it away.\n\nas our Saviour advises,\n\nor lend it without interest.\n\nTo pay interest on money loaned\n\nis to place an enterprise\n\nunder a too heavy burden.\n\nEveryone must live on the sweat of his brow\n\nand not on money loaned.\n\nNobody could lend money at interest\n\nIf nobody would borrow money at interest.\n\nPeople who live on money loaned at interest\n\nreap some of the profits of property\n\nwithout the responsibility of property.\n\nTo pay double wages to managers\n\nis to make the workers\n\nenvious of the managers.\n\nManagers should receive what they need\n\nand no more than they need.\n\nKnowledge obliges as well as “noblesse\n\noblige.”\n\nWe cannot have a Catholic democracy\n\nwithout a Catholic aristocracy.\n\nPaying double wages to managers\n\nis not the way to make aristocrats\n\nout of efficient managers.\n\n“The most important of all are Workmen’s\n\nAssociations\n\nand it is greatly to be desired\n\nthat they should multiply\n\nand become more effective,”\n\nsays Pope Leo XIII.\n\nTo borrow money at interest\n\nand to pay double wages to managers\n\nis not absolutely necessary\n\nto the good functioning\n\nof Workmen’s Associations.\n\nYou say that the Catholic Labor Guild\n\ndoes not lend money at interest\n\nI hope that it will see the way\n\nnot to borrow money at interest.\n\nYou say that the Catholic Labor Guild\n\nstands for profit-sharing.\n\nI hope that your self-sacrificing example\n\nwill lead the members of the Guild\n\nto stand for loss-sharing.\n\nWhen the members of the Guild\n\ndecide to allow the Guild\n\nto accumulate the profits\n\nthey will not need to worry\n\nabout their economic security.\n\nLet the members of the Guild\n\ngive all they can to the Guild;\n\nthe Guild will not leave them in want.\n\nLet the Labor Guild help\n\nall those it can help\n\nand the Farming Communes will help\n\nall those that the Guild cannot help.\n\nYours for Catholic Action.\n\nPETER MAURIN\n\nBetter and Better Off\n\nThe world would be better off\n\nif people tried to become better.\n\nAnd people would become better\n\nif they stopped trying to become better off.\n\nFor when everybody tries to become\n\nbetter off,\n\nnobody is better off.\n\nBut when everybody tries to become better,\n\neverybody is better off.\n\nEverybody would be rich\n\nif nobody tried to become richer.\n\nAnd nobody would be poor\n\nif everybody tried to be the poorest.\n\nAnd everybody would be what he ought\n\nto be\n\nif everybody tried to be\n\nwhat be wants the other fellow to be.\n\nChristianity has nothing to do\n\nwith either modern capitalism\n\nor modern Communism,\n\nfor Christianity has\n\na capitalism of its own\n\nand a communism of its own.\n\nModern capitalism\n\nis based on property without responsibility,\n\nwhile Christian capitalism\n\nis based on property with responsibility.\n\nModern Communism\n\nis based on poverty through force\n\nwhile Christian communism\n\nis based on poverty through choice.\n\nFor a Christian,\n\nvoluntary poverty is the ideal\n\nas exemplified by St. Francis of Assisi,\n\nwhile private property\n\nis not an absolute right, but a gift\n\nwhich as such can not be wasted,\n\nbut must be administered\n\nfor the benefit of God’s chi1dren.\n\nAccording to Johannes Jorgensen,\n\na Danish convert living in Assisi,\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should give up\n\nsuperfluous possessions.\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should work with their hands.\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should offer their services\n\nas a gift.\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should ask other people for help\n\nwhen work failed them.\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should live\n\nas free as birds.\n\nSt. Francis desired\n\nthat men should go through life\n\ngiving thanks to God for His gifts.\n\nThree Ways to Make a Living\n\nMirabeau says “There are three ways\n\nto make a living:\n\nStealing, begging, and working.”\n\nStealing is against the law of God\n\nand against the law of men.\n\nBegging is against the law of men\n\nbut not against the law of God.\n\nWorking is neither against the law of God\n\nnor against the law of men.\n\nBut they say\n\nthat there is no work to do.\n\nThere is plenty of work to do,\n\nbut no wages.\n\nBut people do not need to work for wages,\n\nthey can offer their services as a gift.\n\nCapital and Labor\n\n“Capita1,” says Karl Marx, “is accumulated\n\nlabor,\n\nnot for the benefit of the laborers,\n\nbut for the benefit of the accumulators.”\n\nAnd capitalists succeed in accumulating\n\nlabor,\n\nby treating labor, not as a gift,\n\nbut as a commodity,\n\nbuying it as any other commodity\n\nat the lowest possible price.\n\nAnd organized labor plays into the hands\n\nof the capitalists, or accumulators of labor,\n\nby treating its own labor\n\nnot as a gift, but as a commodity,\n\nselling it as any other commodity\n\nat the highest possible price.\n\nAnd the class struggle is a struggle\n\nbetween the buyers of labor\n\nat the lowest possible price\n\nand the sellers of labor\n\nat the highest possible price.\n\nBut the buyers of labor\n\nat the lowest possible price\n\nand the sellers of labor\n\nat the highest possible price\n\nare nothing but commercializers of labor.\n\nSelling Their Labor\n\nWhen the workers\n\nsell their labor\n\nto the capitalists\n\nor accumulators of labor\n\nthey allow the capitalists\n\nor accumulators of labor\n\nto accumulate their labor.\n\nAnd when the capitalists\n\nor accumulators of labor\n\nhave accumulated so much\n\nof the workers’ labor\n\nthat they do no longer\n\nfind it profitable\n\nto buy the workers’ labor\n\nthen the workers\n\ncan no longer sell their labor\n\nto the capitalists\n\nor accumulators of labor.\n\nAnd when the workers\n\ncan no longer\n\nsell their labor\n\nto the capitalists\n\nor accumulators of labor\n\nthey can no longer buy\n\nthe products of their labor.\n\nAnd that is what the workers get\n\nfor selling their labor.\n\n[These excerpts from the Bishops’ Message of 1934, with Peter Maurin’s comments, were published in the Catholic Worker of May, 1934. The quotations are printed here In Roman type and Peter’s comments in italics.]\n\nIn tracing the remote causes\n\nof the present misery of mankind\n\nwe must listen to him\n\nwho as a loving father\n\nviews from an eminence\n\nall the nations of the world.\n\nQuoting St. Paul, our Holy Father says:\n\n“The desire for money\n\nis the root of all evil.”\n\nFrom greed arises mutual distrust\n\nthat casts a blight\n\non all human beings.\n\nFrom greed arises envy\n\nwhich makes a man\n\nconsider the advantages of another\n\nas losses to himself.\n\nFrom greed arises\n\nnarrow individua1ism\n\nwhich orders and subordinates everything\n\nto its own advantage.\n\nPeople looking\n\nfor a rainy day\n\nhave put so much money\n\ninto business\n\nthat they have brought about\n\nan increase\n\nin producing power\n\nand a decrease\n\nin purchasing power.\n\nSo there is a rub\n\nbetween the rich\n\nwho like\n\nto get richer\n\nand the poor\n\nwho don’t like\n\nto get poorer.\n\nIn common with other nations\n\nwe have brought about our present\n\nunhappy conditions\n\nby divorcing education, industry, politics,\n\nbusiness, and economics\n\nfrom morality and religion\n\nand by ignoring for long decades\n\nthe innate dignity of man\n\nand trampling on his human rights.\n\nWe have taken religion\n\nout of everything\n\nand have put commercialism\n\ninto everything.\n\nThat we are an industrial nation\n\nis our public boast.\n\nIndustry is considered to be of more\n\nimportance\n\nthan the moral welfare of man.\n\nThe lord of all is Industry.\n\n“Save Industry!” is the cry.\n\n“Put business on its feet\n\nand all will be well\n\nas it was in the past.”\n\nWe are beginning to learn\n\nthat to put big business\n\non its feet\n\ndoes not necessarily\n\nput the forgotten man\n\non his feet.\n\nThe philosophy which has ruled govern-\n\nments, groups, and individuals\n\nfor the past three hundred years\n\nhas not taken as its guide\n\nthe moral law,\n\nhas not considered the rights of men.\n\nMoney, not men,\n\nbas been the supreme consideration\n\nand the justifying end.\n\nWhen people care\n\nfor money\n\nthey do not care\n\nfor culture.\n\nAnd when people\n\ndo not care\n\nfor culture\n\nthey return\n\nto barbarism.\n\nThat philosophy permits individuals\n\nto accumulate as much wealth as they can\n\naccording to unfair methods\n\nof modern business\n\nand to use such accumulated wealth\n\nas they see fit.\n\nThis extreme of individualism\n\nhas led to the extreme of Communism.\n\nWe rightly fear its spread in our country\n\nand see an especial menace\n\nin its insidious presentation\n\nof fundamental troubles\n\nfor its own destructive ends.\n\nWhen modern society\n\nmade the bank account\n\nthe standard of values\n\npeople ceased\n\nto produce for use\n\nand began\n\nto produce for profit.\n\nRugged individualism\n\nleads to\n\nrugged nationalism,\n\nwhich leads to\n\nrugged collectivism.\n\nThe brotherhood of man\n\nis loudly proclaimed.\n\nEnergetic protest is made\n\nagainst injustice\n\ndone to the working class.\n\nThe abuses of the capitalist system\n\nare vigorously condemned.\n\nIt is insisted\n\nthat man shall not exploit his fellow man\n\nand that all shall be dedicated\n\nto a life of service.\n\nIn a capitalist society\n\nwhere man\n\nis inhuman to man\n\npeople cannot\n\nkeep from dreaming\n\nabout a society\n\nwhere man\n\nwould be human\n\nto man.\n\nA program of social reform\n\ncouched in such language\n\nand with such aims and purposes\n\nis unassailable\n\nbecause it is distinctly Christian in origin\n\nand purport,\n\nbut in the hands of the Communists\n\nit is merely a snare\n\nto allure those who are oppressed\n\nby the prevailing economic maladjustment\n\ninto accepting the iniquitous social and\n\nreligious tenets\n\nof Lenin and Stalin.\n\nThere is a very grave and subtle danger\n\nof infection from Communism.\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nman is more\n\nthan an individual\n\nwith individual rights;\n\nhe is a person\n\nwith personal duties\n\ntoward God,\n\nhimself,\n\nand his fellow man.\n\nAs a person\n\nman cannot\n\nserve God\n\nwithout serving\n\nthe Common Good.\n\nSpecial efforts are being made\n\nto win Negroes\n\nwho are the victims of injustice.\n\nThe Communists have as their objective\n\na world war on God\n\nand the complete destruction\n\nof all supernatural and even natural religion.\n\nThe Negroes\n\nare beginning to find out\n\nthat wage slavery\n\nis no improvement\n\non chattel slavery.\n\nThe Communists say\n\nthat Christianity is a failure,\n\nbut it is not a failure\n\nfor the very good reason\n\nthat it has not been tried.\n\nA Modern Plague\n\nGlenn Frank,\n\npresident of Wisconsin University,\n\nsays:\n\n“What ails modern society\n\nis the separation of the spiritual from the\n\nmaterial.”\n\nPope Pius XI\n\ncalls this separation\n\n“a modern plague,”\n\nor to speak more plainly “a pest.”\n\nThis separation of the spiritual from the\n\nmaterial\n\nis what we call “secularism.”\n\nEverything has been secularized,\n\neverything has been divorced from religion.\n\nWe have divorced religion from education,\n\nwe have divorced religion from politics,\n\nwe have divorced religion from business.\n\nSecularism\n\nWhen religion has nothing to do with\n\neducation,\n\neducation is only information,\n\nplenty of facts\n\nand no understanding.\n\nWhen religion has nothing to do with\n\npolitics,\n\npolitics is only factionalism–\n\n“Let’s turn the rascals out\n\nso our good friends can get in.”\n\nWhen religion has nothing to do with\n\nbusiness\n\nbusiness is only commercialism.\n\nAnd when religion has nothing to do with\n\neither education, politics or business,\n\nyou have the religion of business taking the\n\nplace of the business of religion.\n\nSpiritualizing\n\nOur modern educators,\n\nour modern politicians,\n\nour modern business men\n\nhave taken religion from everything\n\nand have put commercia1ism into everything.\n\nAnd now we have to take commercialism out\n\nof everything\n\nand to put religion into everything.\n\nThe way to take commercialism out of\n\neverything\n\nand to put religion into everything\n\nis not through political action.\n\nThe way to take commercialism out of\n\neverything\n\nand to put religion into everything\n\nis through Catholic Action.\n\nBusiness-Like\n\nCatholic Action is action by Catholics\n\nfor Catholics and non-Catholics.\n\nCatholic Action is action by Catholic laymen\n\nin co-operation with the clergy.\n\nCatholic laymen and women have told\n\nthe clergy,\n\n“Mind your own business\n\nand don’t butt into our business.”\n\nSo Catholic clergymen\n\nhave ceased to mind the layman’s business\n\nand the laymen have made a mess\n\nof their own business.\n\nAnd Catholic clergymen have tried to mind\n\ntheir business\n\nwith a business-like technique\n\nborrowed from business-minded people.\n\nThe Forgotten Man\n\nThe forgotten man has been forgotten\n\nbecause clergymen have forgotten\n\nto rub shoulders with the forgotten man.\n\nAnd clergymen have forgotten\n\nto rub shoulders with the forgotten man\n\nbecause clergymen have forgotten\n\nto use logic to find what is practical.\n\nAnd because clergymen have forgotten\n\nto use logic to find what is practical\n\nthey have failed to give us a sociology\n\nthat has something to do with theology.\n\nIf there was a sociology\n\nthat had something to do with theology\n\nit was the sociology of St. Francis of Assisi,\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas and St. Thomas More.\n\nBut the sociology of St. Francis of Assisi.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas and St. Thomas More.\n\nwas an Utopian sociology,\n\nand clergymen are not interested in Utopias,\n\nnot even Christian Utopias.\n\nRome or Moscow\n\nAnd because clergymen are not interested\n\nin the sociology of St. Francis of Assisi,\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas and St. Thomas More,\n\nthe forgotten man is becoming interested\n\nin the sociology of Karl Marx, Lenin\n\nand Stalin.\n\nAnd because clergymen are not interested\n\nin a technique of leadership\n\nthe forgotten man is becoming interested\n\nin a technique of dictatorship.\n\nAnd because clergymen are not interested\n\nin Dynamic Catholic Action\n\nthe forgotten man is becoming interested\n\nin Dynamic Bolshevik Action.\n\nI Was Told\n\nI was told\n\nby a young Puerto Rican\n\nthat the president\n\nof his school’s study club\n\nwas a Communist,\n\nand that in the meetings\n\nof the school’s study club\n\nthe Communist president\n\ndid most of the talking\n\nand that the school teacher\n\nwas an interested listener\n\nto the Communist president\n\nof the school’s study club.\n\nI was told\n\nby the dean of a Catholic college\n\nthat Catholic professors\n\nof Catholic colleges\n\nhave neither\n\nthe knowledge nor the courage\n\nto bring Catholic social thought\n\nto the man of the street.\n\nLooking For Light\n\nSo while Catholic professors\n\nof Catholic colleges\n\ndo not have\n\nenough knowledge or courage\n\nto bring Catholic social thought\n\nto the man of the street,\n\nCommunist propagandists\n\nyet in their ‘teens\n\nfind enough knowledge or courage\n\nto bring Communist social thought\n\nto the men of the school\n\nThe schools used to teach:\n\n“If you want peace\n\nprepare for war”;\n\nwe prepared for war\n\nand are still looking for peace.\n\nThe schools used to teach:\n\n“If you want prosperity\n\nsave your money”;\n\npeople saved their money,\n\nand we are still looking for prosperity.\n\nThe modern man looks for thought\n\nso he can have light,\n\nand is unable to find it\n\nin our modern schools.\n\nShouting With Rotarians\n\nAccording to Glenn Frank,\n\npresident of the University of Wisconsin.\n\n“Schools reflect the environment, ,\n\nthey do not create it.”\n\nAccording to Professor Meiklejohn,\n\nof the same university,\n\nstudents go to school\n\nnot to be educated,\n\nbut to be business men.\n\nShortly after their graduation\n\nschool graduates can be heard\n\nshouting with Rotarians:\n\n“Service for profits,\n\nTime is money,\n\nCash and carry,\n\nKeep smiling,\n\nBusiness is business,\n\nWatch your step,\n\nHow is the rush?\n\nHow are you making out?\n\nHow is the world treating you?\n\nThe law of supply and demand,\n\nCompetition is the life of trade,\n\nYour dollar is your best friend.”\n\nA Protestant Agitator\n\nCatholic teachers\n\nteaching in Catholic or public schools\n\nwho do not know how to present\n\nCatholic social thought\n\neither to the men on the street\n\nor to the pupils in the schools\n\nwill be interested to learn\n\nthat a Protestant agitator\n\nwell known in Union Square\n\nis presenting the Thomistic doctrine\n\nof the Common Good\n\nto the men of the street\n\nin the streets of Harlem.\n\nH. Hergenhan, such is his name,\n\ndoes not believe\n\nin the rugged individualism\n\nof capitalism\n\nor in the rugged nationalism\n\nof Fascism\n\nor in the rugged collectivism\n\nof Bolshevism.\n\nThe Common Good\n\nHe believes in the gentle personalism\n\nof gentlemen who are gentle,\n\ngentleness that finds its roots\n\nin the common doctrine\n\nof the Common Good.\n\nH. Hergenhan believes\n\nthat the doctrine of the Common Good\n\nis common\n\nto humanists who are human,\n\nto Jews who are orthodox,\n\nto Protestants who are Christian\n\nand to Catholics who are Catholic.\n\nThe Common Good movement\n\nis not a movement that divides,\n\nit is a movement that unites.\n\nThe Common Good movement\n\nis not a new deal,\n\nit is an old game.\n\nThe Common Good movement\n\nis not a revolution to the left,\n\nit is a revolution to the right.\n\nTawney’s Book\n\nWhen in 1891 Pope Leo XIII\n\nwrote his encyclical\n\non the condition of labor\n\nhe emphasized the lack of ethics\n\nin modern society.\n\nWhen in 1899 Thorstein Veblen\n\nwrote The Theory of the Leisure Class\n\nhe emphasized the same thing.\n\nR. H. Tawney, then an Oxford student,\n\nlearned that when the Canon Law,\n\nthat is to say, the law of the Church,\n\nwas the law of the land\n\nthere were high ethics in society.\n\nSo R. H. Tawney decided to study\n\nhow society has passed down\n\nfrom the high ethics of the Canon Law\n\nto the no ethics of today.\n\nWhat R. H. Tawney found out\n\nabout the history of ethics\n\nof the last five hundred years\n\nis embodied in his book,\n\nReligion and the Rise of Capitalism.\n\nCatholic Social Research\n\n“When a system fails to feed the poor\n\nit is time to look out\n\nfor one that does,”\n\nsays Archbishop Keating of Liverpool.\n\nAnd because Archbishop Keating realized\n\nthat our modern social order\n\nfails to feed the poor\n\nhe founded in Oxford\n\na Catholic Labor College.\n\nAnd the Catholic Labor College\n\nconducted in Oxford\n\nhas been going on\n\nfor the last twenty-five years.\n\nAt its last general meeting\n\nCardinal Bourne declared\n\nthat we are badly in need\n\nof Catholic social research.\n\nIf there had been more Catholic social\n\nresearch\n\nCatholics would not now\n\npass the buck\n\nto the politicians.\n\nSchool of Social Studies\n\nTo found a School of Social Studies,\n\nsuch was the aim\n\nof Father Patrick Sheely, S.J.\n\nIn a School of Social Studies\n\nwe would be able to learn\n\nwhy things are what they are.\n\nIn a School of Social Studies\n\nwe would be able to learn\n\nhow things would be\n\nif they were as they should be.\n\nIn a School of Social Studies\n\nwe would be able to learn\n\nhow a path can be made\n\nfrom things as they are\n\nto things as they should be.\n\nA School of Social Studies\n\nwould give us Catholic Action\n\nbased on Catholic Thought\n\nrealized in Catholic Institutions.\n\nPutting Patches\n\nHaving no School of Social Studies,\n\nwe don’t know how to pass\n\nfrom things as they are\n\nto things as they should be.\n\nHaving no School of Social Studies\n\nwe have no Catholic social program\n\nbased on Catholic social thought.\n\nHaving no School of Social Studies,\n\nwe try to put patches\n\nto the existing social order\n\nand call it a New Deal.\n\nHaving no School of Social Studies.\n\nwe let college professors\n\ncarry on costly experiments\n\nat the expense of the taxpayers.\n\nHaving no School of Social Studies,\n\nwe are not occupied\n\nin reconstructing the social order\n\nas the Holy Father wants us to be.\n\nI Agree\n\nI agree with seven Bishops,\n\nthree of whom are Archbishops,\n\nthat the Communist criticism\n\nof modern rugged individualism\n\nis a sound criticism.\n\nI agree with seven Bishops,\n\nthree of whom are Archbishops,\n\nthat the main social aim\n\nof the Communist Party\n\nis a sound social aim.\n\nI agree with seven Bishops,\n\nthree of whom are Archbishops,\n\nthat the Communists are not sound\n\nwhen they advocate class struggle\n\nin order to realize\n\ntheir sound social aim.\n\nI agree with the Apostolic Delegate\n\nwhen he advocates the practice\n\nof the Seven Corporal and Seven Spiritual\n\nWorks of Mercy\n\nas the best practical means\n\nof making man human to man.\n\nPersonal Sacrifice\n\nTo be our brother’s keeper\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nTo feed the hungry\n\nat a personal sacrifice\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nTo clothe the naked\n\nat a personal sacrifice\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nTo shelter the homeless\n\nat a personal sacrifice\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nTo instruct the ignorant\n\nat a personal sacrifice\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nTo serve man for God’s sake\n\nis what God wants us to do.\n\nReconstruction\n\nThe Holy Father asks us\n\nto reconstruct the social order.\n\nThe social order was once reconstructed\n\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Irish scholars were the leaders\n\nin the reconstruction of the social order\n\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nThrough Round-Table Discussions\n\nscattered all over Europe\n\nas far as Constantinople\n\nthe Irish scholars\n\nbrought thought to the people.\n\nThrough Houses of Hospitality\n\nthe Irish scholars\n\nexemplified Christian charity.\n\nThrough Fanning Communes\n\nthe Irish scholars\n\nmade workers out of scholars\n\nand scholars out of workers.\n\nNot a Liberal\n\nThey say that I am a radical.\n\nIf I am a radical\n\nthen I am not a liberal.\n\nThe future will be different\n\nif we make the present different.\n\nBut to make the present different\n\none must give up old tricks\n\nand start to play new tricks.\n\nBut to give up old tricks\n\nand start to play new tricks\n\none must be a fanatic.\n\nLiberals are so liberal about everything\n\nthat they refuse to be fanatical\n\nabout anything.\n\nAnd not being able to be fanatical\n\nabout anything,\n\nliberals cannot be liberators.\n\nThey can only be liberals.\n\nLiberals refuse to be\n\nreligious, philosophical or economic fanatics\n\nand consent to be\n\nthe worst kind of fanatics,\n\nliberal fanatics.\n\nNot a Conservative\n\nIf I am a radical,\n\nthen I am not a conservative.\n\nConservatives try to believe\n\nthat things are good enough\n\nto be let alone.\n\nBut things are not good enough\n\nto be let alone.\n\nConservatives try to believe\n\nthat the world is getting better\n\nevery day in every way.\n\nBut the world is not getting better\n\nevery day in every way.\n\nThe world is getting worse\n\nevery day in every way\n\nand the world is getting worse\n\nevery day in every way\n\nbecause the world is upside down.\n\nAnd conservatives do not know\n\nhow to take the upside down\n\nand to put it right side up.\n\nWhen conservatives and radicals\n\nwill come to an understanding\n\nthey will take the upside down\n\nand they will put it right side up.\n\nA Radical Change\n\nThe order of the day\n\nis to talk about the social order.\n\nConservatives would like\n\nto keep it from changing\n\nbut they don’t know how.\n\nLiberals try to patch it\n\nand call it a New Deal.\n\nSocialists want a change,\n\nbut a gradual change.\n\nCommunists want a change,\n\nan immediate change,\n\nbut a Socialist change.\n\nCommunists in Russia\n\ndo not build Communism,\n\nthey build Socialism.\n\nCommunists want to pass\n\nfrom capitalism to Socialism\n\nand from Socialism to Communism.\n\nI want a change,\n\nand a radical change.\n\nI want a change\n\nfrom an acquisitive society\n\nto a functional society,\n\nfrom a society of go-getters\n\nto a society of go-givers.\n\nWhen Bankers Rule\n\nModern society has made the bank account\n\nthe standard of values.\n\nWhen the bank account\n\nbecomes the standard of values\n\nthe banker has the power.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nthe technician has to supervise\n\nthe making of profits.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nthe politician\n\nhas to assure law and order\n\nin the profit-making system.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nthe educator trains students\n\nin the technique of profit making.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nthe clergyman is expected\n\nto bless the profit-making system\n\nor to join the unemployed.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nthe Sermon on the Mount\n\nis declared unpractical.\n\nWhen the banker has the power\n\nwe have an acquisitive,\n\nnot a functional society.\n\nWhen Christ Is King\n\nWhen the Sermon on the Mount\n\nis the standard of values\n\nthen Christ is the Leader.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nthe priest is the mediator.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nthe educator\n\ntrains the minds of the pupils\n\nso that they may understand\n\nthe message of the priest.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nthe politician\n\nassures law and order\n\naccording to the priest’s teachings.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nthe technician\n\ndevises ways and means\n\nfor the economical production\n\nand distribution of goods.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nthe administrator administrates\n\naccording to the directions\n\nfrom the technicians.\n\nWhen Christ is the Leader\n\nwe have a functional,\n\nnot an acquisitive society.\n\nRebellion Is Rebellion\n\nBoloney is boloney,\n\nno matter how you slice it,\n\nand rebellion is rebellion\n\nno matter when it happens,\n\nwhether it is\n\nthe religious rebellion\n\nof the 16th century\n\nor the political rebellion\n\nof the 18th century,\n\nor the economic rebellion\n\nof the 20th century.\n\nSomeone said\n\nthat the Catholic Church\n\nstands for rum, Romanism and rebellion.\n\nBut the Catholic Church\n\ndoes not stand for rum, Romanism and\n\nrebellion.\n\nThe Catholic Church stands\n\nfor Rome, Reunion, and Reconstruction.\n\nThe Catholic Church stands,\n\nas Rome used to stand,\n\nfor law and order.\n\nThe Catholic Church stands\n\nfor the reunion\n\nof our separated brothers.\n\nThe Catholic Church stands\n\nfor the reconstruction,\n\nnot the patching up,\n\nof the social order.\n\nConstructing the Social Order\n\nThe Holy Father asks us\n\nto reconstruct the social order.\n\nThe social order was constructed\n\nby the first Christians\n\nthrough the daily practice\n\nof the Seven Corporal\n\nand Seven Spiritual\n\nWorks of Mercy.\n\nTo feed the hungry\n\nat a personal sacrifice,\n\nto clothe the naked\n\nat a personal sacrifice,\n\nto shelter the homeless\n\nat a personal sacrifice,\n\nto instruct the ignorant\n\nat a personal sacrifice;\n\nsuch were the works\n\nof the first Christians\n\nin times of persecution.\n\nNot Communists\n\nThere is nothing wrong\n\nwith Communism,\n\nbut there is something wrong\n\nwith Bolshevism.\n\nThe wrong thing with Bolshevism is\n\nthat Bolshevists\n\nare not Communists;\n\nthey are Socialists.\n\nFor if the Bolshevists\n\nwere Communists,\n\nthey would build Communism.\n\nAnd the Bolshevists\n\ndo not build Communism;\n\nthey build Socialism;\n\nthey build State Socialism.\n\nThe Bolshevists probably hope\n\nthat the State\n\n“will wither away,”\n\nand that they will be able to pass\n\nfrom State Socialism\n\nto Communism without State.\n\nTwo Reds\n\nSome time ago\n\nI was discussing in Harlem\n\nwith a Russian Red\n\nand an Irish Red.\n\nAnd the Russian Red\n\nunderstood me sooner\n\nthan the Irish Red.\n\nHaving understood\n\nwhat I was saying,\n\nthe Russian Red\n\nstarted to explain\n\nto his friend, the Irish Red,\n\nwhat I was talking about.\n\nWhen the Russian Red\n\nhad finished explaining,\n\nthe Irish Red\n\nturned toward me\n\nand said that while he agreed\n\nwith most of what I said\n\nhe still believed\n\nthat the Catholic Church\n\nwas not the friend\n\nof the working-men.\n\nMany Catholics\n\nare much disappointed\n\nwhen Wall Street corporations\n\nor political organizations\n\nor Catholic associations\n\nfail to provide them\n\nwith economic security.\n\nLooking for a Boss\n\nA Catholic working-man\n\nonce said to me:\n\n“There is only one thing\n\nbetween me and the Reds,\n\nand that is a good job.”\n\nEverybody is looking for a boss,\n\nand nobody wants\n\nto be his own boss.\n\nAnd because everybody\n\nlooks for a boss\n\nthe Reds want the State\n\nto be the boss of everybody.\n\nBecause everybody\n\nconsents to play\n\nsomebody else’s game\n\nfor the sake of a pay-envelope\n\nthe Reds try to find the way\n\nto assure a pay-envelope\n\nto everybody\n\nso as to force everybody\n\nto act like everybody.\n\nBut nothing will be changed\n\nwhen the Reds\n\nwill force everybody\n\nto act like everybody,\n\nsince nobody is nobody\n\nwhen everybody\n\ntries to keep up with everybody.\n\nAmerica and Russia\n\nAmerican Republicans\n\nwant their friends\n\non the public payroll,\n\nbut only their friends.\n\nAmerican Democrats\n\nwant their friends\n\non the public payroll,\n\nbut only their friends.\n\nBut the Reds want everybody\n\non the public payroll,\n\nnot only their friends.\n\nThe American idea\n\nis to keep the Government\n\nout of business\n\nand to put everybody\n\ninto business.\n\nThe Russian idea\n\nis to put the Government\n\ninto business\n\nand to keep everybody\n\nout of business.\n\nBut business\n\nis only business,\n\nwhether it is\n\nthe State business\n\nor private business;\n\nand I am trying\n\nto make it my business\n\nto put all business\n\nout of business,\n\nincluding the State business,\n\nwhich is a big business.\n\nRed and Green\n\nOur business managers\n\nhave made such a mess of things\n\nthat people are inclined\n\nto see Red.\n\nAnd when people see Red\n\nit is useless\n\nto present to them\n\nthe Red, White and Blue,\n\nbecause they can no longer see\n\nthe White and the Blue\n\nof the Red, White and Blue;\n\nall they can see is Red.\n\nThe only way\n\nto keep people\n\nfrom seeing Red\n\nis to make them\n\nsee Green.\n\nThe only way\n\nto prevent\n\na Red Revolution\n\nis to promote\n\na Green Revolution.\n\nThe only way\n\nto keep people\n\nfrom looking up\n\nto Red Russia\n\nof the twentieth century\n\nis to make them look up\n\nto Green Ireland.\n\nof the seventh century.\n\nThousand Years Ago\n\nWhen Irish were Irish\n\na thousand years ago,\n\nthe Irish were scholars.\n\nAnd when the Irish were scholars\n\nthe Irish were Greek scholars.\n\nAnd when the Irish were Greek scholars\n\nthe Irish spoke Greek\n\nas well as Irish.\n\nAnd when the Irish spoke Greek\n\nas well as Irish.\n\nGreek was Irish\n\nto the Irish.\n\nGreek was Irish\n\nto the Irish\n\nand now\n\nIrish is Greek\n\nto the Irish.\n\nIrish is Greek\n\nto the Irish now\n\nand Hebrew is Chinese\n\nto the Jews.\n\nThe Communist Party\n\nThe criticism of bourgeois capitalism\n\nby the Communist Party\n\nis the criticism\n\nof Victor Considerant\n\nused by Marx and Engels\n\nin the Communist Manifesto.\n\nThe definition of Communism\n\nof the Communist Manifesto\n\nis the definition\n\nof Proudhon\n\nborrowed by Marx and Engels.\n\nThe technique of class struggle\n\nis the technique\n\nadvocated by Marx and Engels.\n\nThe technique of proletarian dictatorship\n\nis the technique\n\nadvocated by Lenin.\n\nThe Catholic Worker\n\nThe Catholic Worker criticism\n\nof bourgeois society\n\nis the criticism\n\nof St. Thomas More.\n\nThe Catholic Worker aims\n\nare the aims\n\nof St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nin his doctrine\n\nof the Common Good.\n\nThe Catholic Worker means\n\nare the daily practice\n\nof the Works of Mercy\n\nand the fostering\n\nof Farming Communes\n\nwhere scholars\n\nbecome workers\n\nand workers\n\nbecome scholars.\n\n1200–Guild System\n\nIn 1200 A. D.\n\nthere was no capitalist system,\n\nthere was the guild system.\n\nThe doctrine of the guilds\n\nwas the doctrine\n\nof the Common Good.\n\nPeople used to say, as they do now,\n\n“What can I do for you?”\n\nbut they meant what they said.\n\nNow they say one thing\n\nand they mean another.\n\nThey did not look for markets,\n\nthey let the markets\n\nlook for them.\n\n1400–Middle Men\n\nAround 1400 A. D.\n\nappears the middle man.\n\nHe offers to buy the goods\n\nand to find a market.\n\nThe guildsman\n\nthinks about the money\n\noffered for his goods\n\nand forgets the Common Good.\n\nAnd the middle man\n\nis not interested\n\nin selling useful goods\n\nbut in making money\n\non any kind of goods.\n\nAnd the consumer\n\nnever meets the producer\n\nand the producer\n\nceases to think\n\nin terms of service\n\nand begins to think\n\nin terms of profits.\n\n1600–Banker\n\nBefore John Calvin\n\npeople were not allowed\n\nto lend money at interest.\n\nJohn Calvin decided\n\nto legalize\n\nmoney lending at interest\n\nin spite of the teachings\n\nof the Prophets of Israel\n\nand the Fathers of the Church.\n\nProtestant countries\n\ntried to keep up\n\nwith John Calvin\n\nand money-lending at interest\n\nbecame the general practice.\n\nAnd money ceased to be\n\na means of exchange\n\nand began to be\n\na means to make money.\n\nSo people lent money on time\n\nand started to think of time\n\nin terms of money\n\nand said to each other,\n\n“Time is money.”\n\n1700–Manufacturer\n\nWith the discovery of steam\n\nthe factory system\n\nmade its appearance.\n\nTo take drudgery out of the home\n\nwas supposed to be\n\nthe aim of the manufacturer.\n\nSo the guildsman\n\nleft his shop\n\nand went to the factory.\n\nBut the profit-making manufacturer\n\nfound it more profitable\n\nto employ women\n\nthan to employ men.\n\nSo the women left the home\n\nand went to the factory.\n\nSoon the children\n\nfollowed the women\n\nin the factory.\n\nSo the men have to stay at home\n\nwhile the women and children\n\nwork in the factory.\n\n1800–Economist\n\nSince Adam Smith,\n\nwho published his book in 1776,\n\nwe have been told\n\nthat competition\n\nis the life of trade\n\nand that it is a case\n\nof the survival of the fittest.\n\nSo since 1776\n\nlooking for markets\n\nhas engaged men’s activities.\n\nAnd since trade follows the flag,\n\nindustrial nations\n\nhave also become\n\nimperialist nations.\n\nThe fight for markets\n\nbetween two industrial nations,\n\nEngland and Germany,\n\nwas the main cause\n\nof the World War.\n\n1914–World War\n\nAs President Wilson said,\n\nthe World War\n\nwas a commercial war.\n\nBut a commercial war\n\nhad to be idealized,\n\nso it was called\n\na War for Democracy.\n\nBut the War for Democracy\n\ndid not bring Democracy,\n\nit brought\n\nBolshevism in Russia,\n\nFascism in Italy.\n\nNazism in Germany.\n\n1929–World Depression\n\nAfter the World War\n\npeople tried to believe\n\nthat a New Era\n\nhad dawned upon the world.\n\nPeople thought\n\nthat they had found a solution\n\nto the problem\n\nof mass distribution.\n\nPeople thought\n\nthat the time had come\n\nof a two-car garage,\n\na chicken in every pot\n\nand a sign “To Let”\n\nin front of every poorhouse.\n\nAnd everybody\n\nwanted to cash in\n\non the future prosperity.\n\nSo stock promoters got busy\n\nand stocked people with stocks\n\ntill they got stuck.\n\n1933–New Deal\n\nWe were told in 1929\n\nthat business would go on\n\nas usual.\n\nWe were told in 1930\n\nthat the economic system\n\nwas fundamentally sound.\n\nWe were told in 1931\n\nthat prosperity\n\nwas just around the corner.\n\nWe were told in 1932\n\nthat the depression was fought\n\non one hundred fronts.\n\nWe were told in 1933\n\nthat five million men\n\nwould be employed\n\nby Labor Day.\n\nAnd in 1934\n\npeople went crazy\n\nfor the NRA.\n\nAnd in 1935\n\nthe NRA is scrapped\n\nand economic recovery\n\nis a long way off.\n\n1933–The Catholic Worker\n\nThe aim of the Catholic Worker\n\nis to create order\n\nout of chaos.\n\nThe aim of the Catholic Worker\n\nis to help the unemployed\n\nto employ themselves.\n\nThe aim of the Catholic Worker\n\nis to make an impression\n\non the depression\n\nthrough expression.\n\nThe aim of the Catholic Worker\n\nis to create a new society\n\nwithin the shell of the old\n\nwith the philosophy of the new.\n\nwhich is not a new philosophy.\n\nbut a very old philosophy,\n\na philosophy so old\n\nthat it looks like new.\n\nNo Recourse\n\nPoliticians used to say:\n\n“We make prosperity\n\nthrough our wise policies.”\n\nBusiness men used to say:\n\n“We make prosperity\n\nthrough our private enterprise.”\n\nThe workers did not seem\n\nto have anything to do\n\nabout the matter.\n\nThey were either\n\nput to work\n\nor thrown out\n\nof employment.\n\nAnd when unemployment came\n\nthe workers had no recourse\n\nagainst the professed\n\nmakers of prosperity–\n\npoliticians\n\nand business men.\n\nPolitics Is Politics\n\nA politician is an artist in the art\n\nof following the wind\n\nof public opinion.\n\nHe who follows the wind\n\nof public opinion\n\ndoes not follow\n\nhis own judgment.\n\nAnd he who does not follow\n\nhis own judgment\n\ncannot lead people\n\nout of the beaten path.\n\nHe is like the\n\nthe tail end of the dog\n\ntrying to lead the head.\n\nWhen people stand back\n\nof politicians\n\nand politicians\n\nstand back of the people,\n\npeople and politicians\n\ngo around in a circle\n\nand get nowhere.\n\nMaker of Deals\n\nA business man\n\nis a maker of deals.\n\nHe wants to close\n\na profitable deal\n\nin the shortest possible time.\n\nTo close a profitable deal\n\nin the shortest possible time\n\nhe tells you\n\nwhat a good bargain\n\nyou are getting.\n\nAnd while he tells you\n\nwhat a good bargain\n\nyou are getting\n\nhe is always thinking\n\nwhat a good bargain\n\nhe is getting.\n\nHe appeals\n\nto the selfishness in you\n\nto satisfy\n\nthe selfishness in him.\n\nBusiness Is Selfishness\n\nBecause everybody\n\nis naturally selfish\n\nbusiness men say\n\nthat business\n\nmust be based\n\non selfishness.\n\nBut when business\n\nis based on selfishness\n\neverybody is busy\n\nbecoming more selfish.\n\nAnd when everybody is busy\n\nbecoming more selfish\n\nwe have classes and clashes.\n\nTeaching Subjects\n\nOur business managers\n\ndon’t know how to manage\n\nthe things they try to manage\n\nbecause they don’t understand\n\nthe things they try to manage.\n\nSo they turn to college professors\n\nin the hope of understanding\n\nthe things they try to manage.\n\nBut college professors\n\ndo not profess anything;\n\nthey only teach subjects.\n\nAs teachers of subjects\n\ncollege professors\n\nmay enable people\n\nto master subjects.\n\nBut mastering subjects\n\nhas never enabled anyone\n\nto master situations.\n\nSpecialization\n\nA few years ago,\n\nI asked a college professor\n\nto give me\n\nthe formulation\n\nof those universal concepts\n\nembodied\n\nin the universal message\n\nof universal universities\n\nthat will enable\n\nthe common man\n\nto create\n\na universal economy.\n\nAnd I was told\n\nby the college professor:\n\n“That is not my subject.”\n\nColleges and universities\n\ngive to the students\n\nplenty of facts\n\nbut very little understanding.\n\nThey turn out specialists\n\nknowing more and more\n\nabout less and less.\n\nChristianity Untried\n\nChesterton says:\n\n“The Christian ideal\n\nhas not been tried\n\nand found wanting.\n\nIt has been found difficult\n\nand left untried.”\n\nChristianity has not been tried\n\nbecause people thought\n\nit was impractical.\n\nAnd men have tried everything\n\nexcept Christianity.\n\nAnd everything\n\nthat men have tried\n\nhas failed.\n\nCatholic Bourgeois\n\nA bourgeois is a man\n\nwho tries to be somebody,\n\nby trying to be like everybody,\n\nwhich makes him a nobody.\n\nCatholic bourgeois\n\ntry to be\n\nlike non-Catholic bourgeois\n\nand think they are\n\njust as good\n\nas non-Catholic bourgeois.\n\nRight after the war\n\nCatholic bourgeois\n\ntried to believe\n\nwhat non-Catholic bourgeois\n\ntried to believe,\n\nthat the time had come\n\nin America\n\nfor a two-car garage\n\na chicken in every pot\n\nand a sign “To Let”\n\nin front of every poorhouse.\n\nAnd Catholic colleges\n\nas well as non-Catholic colleges\n\nturned out stock promoters,\n\nstock brokers\n\nand stock salesmen\n\nwho stocked people with stocks\n\ntill they got stuck.\n\nShouting With Rotarians\n\nModern colleges\n\ngive you\n\na bit of this,\n\na bit of that,\n\na bit of something else\n\nand a degree.\n\nThe act of giving a degree\n\nis called a Commencement.\n\nAnd after the Commencement\n\nthe student commences\n\nto look for a job.\n\nCollege Graduates\n\nSociology is not a science,\n\nit is an art.\n\nThe art of sociology\n\nis the art\n\nof creating order\n\nout of chaos.\n\nBourgeois colleges\n\nturn out college graduates\n\ninto a changing world\n\nwithout ever telling them\n\nhow to keep it from changing\n\nor how to change it\n\nso as to make it fit\n\nfor college graduates.\n\nCollege graduates\n\nthink in terms of jobs,\n\nnot in terms of work.\n\nSince the world is upside down,\n\ntaking the side down\n\nand putting it up\n\nshould be the task\n\nof college graduates.\n\nBut college graduates\n\nwould rather\n\nplay somebody else’s game\n\nin a position\n\nthan to create order\n\nout of chaos.\n\nAn Unhappy Lot\n\nBut the job providers\n\nare not on the job\n\nand college graduates\n\nare disappointed.\n\nThey have degrees,\n\nbut their degrees\n\ndo not give them jobs.\n\nThey have been told\n\nthat the road to success\n\nis a college education.\n\nThey have a college education\n\nand they do not know\n\nwhat to do,\n\nwith themselves.\n\nThe overproduction\n\nof college graduates\n\nis a fertile ground\n\nfor social demagogues.\n\nThe unemployed college graduates\n\nare getting sore\n\nat their parents\n\nfor sending them into colleges\n\nwhich have not prepared them\n\nfor a changing world.\n\nAnd they ask themselves\n\nif their educators\n\nknow what it is\n\nto be educated.\n\nHouses of Hospitality\n\nIn the New Masses\n\na Communist cartoonist represents\n\na line of college graduates\n\nreceiving their degrees\n\nfrom the Alma Mater\n\nand joining a soup line\n\non the other side of the square.\n\nSocial reconstruction\n\nwill be the result\n\nof social indoctrination.\n\nBut unemployed college graduates\n\ncannot be indoctrinated\n\nwithout first being fed,\n\nas well as clothed,\n\nas well as sheltered.\n\nHouses of Hospitality\n\nfor unemployed college graduates\n\nare a pressing need.\n\nIndoctrination\n\nIn Houses of Hospitality\n\nunemployed college graduates\n\nwill be fed, clothed, sheltered,\n\nas well as indoctrinated.\n\nUnemployed college graduates\n\nmust be told\n\nwhy the things are\n\nwhat they are,\n\nhow the things would be\n\nif they were\n\nas they should be\n\nand how a path\n\ncan be made\n\nfrom the things\n\nas they are\n\nto the things\n\nas they should be.\n\nUnemployed college graduates\n\nmust be told\n\nhow to create\n\na new society\n\nwithin the shell of the old\n\nwith the philosophy of the new,\n\nwhich is not a new philosophy,\n\nbut a very old philosophy,\n\na philosophy so old\n\nthat it looks like new.\n\nOn Farming Communes\n\nWhen unemployed college graduates\n\nwill have been indoctrinated\n\nthey will be moved\n\nto Farming Communes.\n\nOn Farming Communes\n\nunemployed college graduates\n\nwill be taught\n\nhow to build their houses,\n\nhow to gather their fuel,\n\nhow to raise their food,\n\nhow to make their furniture;\n\nthat is to say,\n\nhow to employ themselves.\n\nUnemployed college graduates\n\nmust be taught\n\nhow to use their hands.\n\nUnemployed college graduates\n\nhave time\n\non their hands.\n\nAnd while time is on the hands\n\nof college graduates\n\ntheir heads don’t function\n\nas they should function.\n\nOn Farming Communes\n\nunemployed college graduates\n\nwill learn to use\n\nboth their hands\n\nand their heads.\n\nOn the Level\n\nOwen Young says:\n\n“We will never have prosperity\n\nas long as there is no balance\n\nbetween industry\n\nand agriculture.”\n\nThe farmer sells\n\nin an open market\n\nand is forced to buy\n\nin a restricted market.\n\nWhen the farmer gets\n\na pair of overalls\n\nfor a bushel of wheat\n\nthe wheat and the overalls\n\nare on the level.\n\nWhen the farmer\n\nhas to give\n\ntwo bushels of wheat\n\nfor a pair of overalls\n\nthe wheat and the overalls\n\nare not on the level.\n\nWheat and overalls\n\nmust be on the level.\n\nIndustrialization\n\nLenin said:\n\n“The world cannot be\n\nhalf industrial\n\nand half agricultural.”\n\nEngland, Germany,\n\nJapan and America\n\nhave become\n\nindustrialized.\n\nSoviet Russia\n\nis trying to keep up\n\nwith England, Germany,\n\nJapan and America.\n\nWhen all the world\n\nwill be industrialized\n\nevery country\n\nwill be looking\n\nfor foreign markets.\n\nBut when every country\n\nwill be industrialized\n\nyou will not have\n\nforeign markets.\n\nMechanized Labor\n\nGandhi says:\n\n“Industrialism is evil.”\n\nIndustrialism is evil\n\nbecause it brings idleness\n\nboth to the capitalist class\n\nand the working class.\n\nIdleness does no good\n\neither to the capitalist class\n\nor to the working class.\n\nCreative labor\n\nis what keeps people\n\nout of mischief.\n\nCreative labor\n\nis craft labor.\n\nMechanized labor\n\nis not creative labor.\n\nNo Pleasure in Their Work\n\nCarlyle says:\n\n“He who has found his work,\n\nlet him look\n\nfor no other blessedness.”\n\nBut workmen\n\ncannot find happiness\n\nin mechanized work.\n\nAs Charles Devas says,\n\n“The great majority\n\nhaving to perform\n\nsome mechanized operation\n\nwhich requires little thought\n\nand allows no originality\n\nand which concerns an object\n\nin the transformation of which,\n\nwhether previous or subsequent,\n\nthey have no part,\n\ncannot take pleasure\n\nin their work.”\n\nAs D. Marshall says,\n\n“Previously the workman\n\nfashioned every article\n\nwith his own hands,\n\nbringing to bear on it\n\nall the skill of the craft\n\nwhich was his;\n\nnow all of this\n\nis done by the machine.”\n\nIndustrialism and Art\n\nEric Gill says:\n\n“The notion of work\n\nhas been separated\n\nfrom the notion of art.\n\nThe notion of the useful\n\nhas been separated\n\nfrom the notion of the beautiful\n\nThe artist,\n\nthat is to say,\n\nthe responsible workman,\n\nhas been separated\n\nfrom all other workmen.\n\nThe factory hand\n\nhas no responsibility\n\nfor what he produces.\n\nHe has been reduced\n\nto a sub-human condition\n\nof intellectual irresponsibility.\n\nIndustrialism\n\nhas released the artist\n\nfrom the necessity\n\nof making anything useful\n\nIndustrialism\n\nhas also released the workman\n\nfrom making anything amusing.”\n\nFrom a Chinese\n\nA Chinese says:\n\n“I thought I had become Westernized\n\nbut now I am becoming repatriated.\n\nThe material progress of America\n\nhad dazzled me.\n\nI wished while there\n\nto transplant what I saw\n\nto China.\n\nBut now that I am home again\n\nI see that our two civilizations\n\nhave irreconcilable differences.\n\nYours is a machine civilization;\n\nours is a handicraft civilization.\n\nYour people\n\nwork in factories;\n\nour people\n\nwork in shops.\n\nYour people\n\nproduce quantity things\n\nthat are alike;\n\nour people\n\nproduce quality things\n\nthat are different.\n\nWhat would Western industrialism\n\ndo to us?\n\nOur people\n\nwould become robots.\n\nOur cultural traditions\n\nwould be destroyed.”\n\nRegard for the Soil\n\nAndrew Nelson Lytle says:\n\n“The escape from industrialism\n\nis not in Socialism\n\nor in Sovietism.\n\nThe answer lies\n\nin a return to a society\n\nwhere agriculture is practiced\n\nby most of the people.\n\nIt is in fact impossible\n\nfor any culture\n\nto be sound and healthy\n\nwithout a proper respect\n\nand proper regard\n\nfor the soil,\n\nno matter\n\nhow many urban dwellers\n\nthink that their food\n\ncomes from groceries\n\nand delicatessens\n\nor their milk from tin cans.\n\nThis ignorance\n\ndoes not release them\n\nfrom a final dependence\n\nupon the farm.”\n\nUp to Catholics\n\nRalph Adams Cram says:\n\n“What I propose\n\nis that Catholics\n\nshould take up\n\nthis back-to-the-land problem\n\nand put it into operation.\n\nWhy Catholics?\n\nBecause they realize\n\nmore clearly than any others\n\nthe shortcomings\n\nof the old capitalist\n\nindustrial system.\n\nThey, better than others,\n\nsee the threat\n\nthat impends.\n\nThey alone understand\n\nthat while the family\n\nis the primary social unit,\n\nthe community comes next.\n\nAnd there is\n\nno sound\n\nand righteous\n\nand enduring community\n\nwhere all its members\n\nare not substantially\n\nof one mind\n\nin matters of the spirit–\n\nthat is to say,\n\nof religion.”\n\nIn the first issue of The Catholic Worker appeared this essay:\n\nInstitutions and Corporations\n\nJean Jacques Rousseau says:\n\n“Man is naturally good,\n\nbut institutions make him bad,\n\nso let us\n\noverthrow institutions,”\n\nI say: Man is partly good\n\nand partly bad,\n\nbut corporations,\n\nnot institutions,\n\nmake him worse.\n\n“An institution,” says Emerson,\n\n“is the extension\n\nof the soul of a man.”\n\nInstitutions are founded\n\nto foster the welfare\n\nof the masses.\n\nCorporations are organized\n\nto promote wealth\n\nfor the few.\n\nSo let us found\n\nsmaller and better\n\ninstitutions\n\nand not promote\n\nbigger and better\n\ncorporations.\n\nSome Institutions\n\nRound-Table Discussions\n\nto learn from scholars\n\nhow the things would be\n\nif they were\n\nas they should be.\n\nCampion Propaganda Committees\n\nfor the indoctrination\n\nof the man of the street.\n\nMaternity Guilds\n\nfor the welfare\n\nof needy mothers\n\nbringing young children\n\ninto the world.\n\nHouses of Hospitality\n\nto give to the rich\n\nthe opportunity\n\nto serve the poor.\n\nFarming Communes\n\nwhere the scholars\n\nmay become workers\n\nso the workers\n\nmay be scholars.\n\nAmerican Institutions\n\nThe American Constitution,\n\nthe American Congress,\n\nthe American Supreme Court\n\nare also considered\n\nas institutions.\n\nThe American Constitution\n\nwas devised\n\nby the American Founders\n\nto protect the individual\n\nagainst the majority,\n\nwhether in Congress\n\nor government.\n\nThe American Supreme Court\n\nwas established by the Founders\n\nto watch over the Constitution\n\nso as to prevent\n\nits misrepresentation\n\nand its misapplication.\n\nBureaucracy\n\nBureaucracy has failed,\n\nwhether in America,\n\nin France or Germany.\n\nIn France we say:\n\n“Plus ca change,\n\nplus c’est la mime chose.”\n\n[The more it changes,\n\nthe more it remains\n\nthe same thing.]\n\nGovernments change\n\nbut the bureaucracy remains.\n\nPolitical corruption\n\nhas made the French people\n\ndisgusted with their politicians.\n\nThe most efficient bureaucracy\n\nwas the German bureaucracy.\n\nAnd the faith in bureaucracy\n\nwas so great\n\nthat they failed\n\nto create a public opinion\n\nfor democratic reform.\n\nSo the Nazis beat them to it.\n\nAnd created a public opinion\n\nfor racial demagogy.\n\nThe Catholic Worker\n\nis trying to create\n\na public opinion\n\nfor Communitarian reform.\n\nFive Definitions\n\nA Bourgeois\n\nis a fellow\n\nwho tries to be somebody\n\nby trying to be\n\nlike everybody,\n\nwhich makes him\n\na nobody.\n\nA Dictator\n\nis a fellow\n\nwho does not hesitate\n\nto strike you over the head\n\nif you refuse to do\n\nwhat he wants you to do.\n\nA Leader\n\nis a fellow\n\nwho refuses to be crazy\n\nthe way everybody else is crazy\n\nand tries to be crazy\n\nin his own crazy way.\n\nA Bolshevist\n\nis a fellow\n\nwho tries to get\n\nwhat the other fellow has\n\nand to regulate\n\nwhat you should have.\n\nA Communitarian\n\nis a fellow\n\nwho refuses to be\n\nwhat the other fellow is\n\nand tries to be\n\nwhat he wants him to be.\n\nThey and We\n\nPeople say:\n\n“They don’t do this,\n\nthey don’t do that,\n\nthey ought to do this,\n\nthey ought to do that.”\n\nAlways “They”\n\nand never “I.”\n\nPeople should say:\n\n“They are crazy\n\nfor doing this\n\nand not doing that\n\nbut I don’t need\n\nto be crazy\n\nthe way they are crazy.”\n\nThe Communitarian Revolution\n\nis basically\n\na personal revolution.\n\nIt starts with I,\n\nnot with They.\n\nOne I plus one I\n\nmakes two I’s\n\nand two I’s make We.\n\nWe is a community,\n\nwhile “they” is a crowd.\n\nA New Movement\n\nThe Nazis, the Fascists\n\nand the Bolshevists\n\nare Totalitarians.\n\nThe Catholic Worker\n\nis Communitarian.\n\nThe principles of Communitarianism\n\nare expounded every month\n\nin the French magazine Esprit (the Spirit).\n\nEmmanuel Mounier,\n\neditor of the magazine,\n\nhas a book entitled\n\n“La Revolution Personnaliste et\n\nCommunautaire.”\n\nTwo Bourgeois\n\nThe bourgeois capitalist\n\nbelieves in rugged individualism;\n\nThe Bolshevist Socialist\n\nbelieves in rugged collectivism.\n\nThere is no difference\n\nbetween the rugged individualism\n\nof bourgeois capitalism\n\nand the rugged collectivism\n\nof Bolshevist Socialism.\n\nThe bourgeois capitalist\n\ntries to keep\n\nwhat he has,\n\nand tries to get\n\nwhat the other fellow has.\n\nThe Bolshevist Socialist\n\ntries to get\n\nwhat the bourgeois capitalist has.\n\nThe Bolshevist Socialist\n\nis the son\n\nof the bourgeois capitalist,\n\nand the son\n\nis too much\n\nlike his father.\n\nAll the sins of the father\n\nare found in the son.\n\nBourgeois Capitalist\n\nThe bourgeois capitalist\n\ncalls himself conservative\n\nbut has failed to conserve\n\nour cultural tradition.\n\nHe thinks that culture\n\nis related to leisure.\n\nHe does not think that culture\n\nis related to cult\n\nand to cultivation.\n\nHe believes in power,\n\nand that money\n\nis the way to power.\n\nHe believes that money\n\ncan buy everything,\n\nwhether it be labor or brains.\n\nBut as the poet Emerson says,\n\n“People have only\n\nthe power we give them.”\n\nWhen people will cease\n\nselling their labor power\n\nor their brain power\n\nto the bourgeois capitalist,\n\nthe bourgeois capitalist\n\nwill cease being\n\na gentleman of leisure\n\nand begin being\n\na cultured gentleman.\n\nBolshevist Socialist\n\nThe Bolshevist Socialist\n\nis the spiritual son\n\nof the bourgeois capitalist;\n\nhe credits bourgeois capitalism\n\nwith an historic mission\n\nand fails to condemn it\n\non general principles.\n\nThe bourgeois Socialist\n\ndoes not believe\n\nin the profit system,\n\nbut he does believe\n\nin the wage system.\n\nThe bourgeois capitalist\n\nand his spiritual son,\n\nthe Bolshevist Socialist,\n\nbelieve in getting\n\nall they can get\n\nand not in giving\n\nall they can give.\n\nThe bourgeois capitalist\n\nand his spiritual son,\n\nthe Bolshevist Socialist,\n\nare go-getters,\n\nnot go-givers.\n\nThe Personalist Communitarian\n\nA personalist\n\nis a go-giver,\n\nnot a go-getter.\n\nHe tries to give\n\nwhat he has,\n\nand does not\n\ntry to get\n\nwhat the other fellow has.\n\nHe tries to be good\n\nby doing good\n\nto the other fellow.\n\nHe is altro-centered,\n\nnot self-centered.\n\nHe has a social doctrine\n\nof the common good.\n\nHe spreads the social doctrine\n\nof the common good\n\nthrough words and deeds.\n\nHe speaks through deeds\n\nas well as words,\n\nfor he knows that deeds\n\nspeak louder than words.\n\nThrough words and deeds\n\nhe brings into existence\n\na common unity,\n\nthe common unity\n\nof a community.\n\nCommunity Spirit\n\nCommunitarianism\n\nis the rediscovery\n\nand the exemplification\n\nof what the Kiwanis\n\nand Rotarians\n\nused to talk about,\n\nnamely,\n\nthe community spirit.\n\nThe community spirit\n\nis no more common\n\nthan common sense\n\nis common.\n\nEverybody knows\n\nthat common sense\n\nis not common,\n\nbut nobody believes\n\nthat common sense\n\nshould not be common.\n\nThe community spirit\n\nshould be common.\n\nas well as common sense\n\nshould be common.\n\nIf common sense was common,\n\nBolshevist Socialists\n\nwould not be\n\nrugged collectivists;\n\nthey would be\n\nCommunitarian personalists.\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\nbelieve in the community spirit\n\njust as much\n\nas Kiwanis and Rotarians.\n\nWhile Kiwanis and Rotarians\n\nused to talk about the common spirit,\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\ndid something about it.\n\nKiwanis and Rotarians\n\nused to talk\n\nabout service\n\nbut never forgot\n\nprofitable service.\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\nmay not say much\n\nabout service,\n\nbut continue to render\n\nunprofitable service.\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\nbelieve in the responsibility\n\nof private property\n\nbut they believe also\n\nin the practicality\n\nof voluntary poverty.\n\nCounsels of the Gospel\n\nSomeone said\n\nthat The Catholic Worker\n\nis taking monasticism\n\nout of the monasteries.\n\nThe Counsels of the Gospel\n\nare for everybody,\n\nnot only for monks.\n\nFranciscans and Jesuits\n\nare not monks.\n\nFranciscans are Friars,\n\nand the world is their monastery.\n\nJesuits are the storm troops\n\nof the Catholic Church,\n\nand ready to be sent\n\nwhere the Holy Father\n\nwishes to send them.\n\nThe Counsels of the Gospel\n\nare for everybody,\n\nand if everybody\n\ntried to live up to it\n\nwe would bring order\n\nout of chaos,\n\nand Chesterton would not\n\nhave said\n\nthat the Christian ideal\n\nhas been left untried.\n\nOn Gandhi Lines\n\nStrike news\n\ndoesn’t strike me,\n\nbut the sit-down strike\n\nis a different strike\n\nfrom the ordinary strike.\n\nIn the sit-down strike\n\nyou don’t strike anybody\n\neither on the jaw\n\nor under the belt,\n\nyou just sit down.\n\nThe sit-down strike\n\nis essentially\n\na peaceful strike.\n\nIf the sit-down strike\n\nremains a sit-down strike,\n\nthat is to say,\n\na strike in which you strike\n\nby just sitting down,\n\nit may be a means\n\nof bringing about\n\ndesirable results.\n\nThe sit-down strike\n\nmust be conducted\n\non Gandhi lines,\n\nthat is to say,\n\naccording to the doctrine\n\nof pure means\n\nas expressed by Jacques Maritain.\n\nIn the Middle Ages\n\nThe capitalist system\n\nis a racketeering system.\n\nIt is a racketeering system\n\nbecause it is\n\na profiteering system.\n\nIt is a profiteering system\n\nbecause it is\n\na profit system.\n\nAnd nobody\n\nhas found the way\n\nto keep the profit system\n\nfrom becoming\n\na profiteering system.\n\nHarold Laski says:\n\n“In the Middle Ages\n\nthe idea of acquiring wealth\n\nwas limited\n\nby a body of moral rules\n\nimposed under the sanction\n\nof religious authority.”\n\nBut modern business men\n\ntell the clergy:\n\n“Mind your own business\n\nand don’t butt into our business.”\n\nEconomic Economy\n\nIn the Middle Ages\n\nthey had a doctrine,\n\nthe doctrine\n\nof the Common Good.\n\nIn the Middle Ages\n\nthey had an economy\n\nwhich was economical.\n\nTheir economy\n\nwas based on the idea\n\nthat God wants us\n\nto be our brothers’ keepers.\n\nThey believed\n\nin the right to work\n\nfor the worker.\n\nThey believed\n\nin being fair\n\nto the worker\n\nas well as the consumer.\n\nThey believed\n\nin doing their work\n\nthe best they knew how\n\nfor the service\n\nof God and men.\n\nProper Property\n\nLeon Harmel,\n\nwho was an employer,\n\nnot a labor leader,\n\nsays: “We have lost\n\nthe right concept of authority\n\nsince the Renaissance.”\n\nWe have not only lost\n\nthe right concept of authority,\n\nwe have also lost\n\nthe right concept\n\nof property.\n\nThe use of property\n\nto acquire more property\n\nis not the proper use\n\nof property.\n\nThe right use of property\n\nis to enable the worker\n\nto do his work\n\nmore effectively.\n\nThe right use of property\n\nis not to compel the worker,\n\nunder threat of unemployment,\n\nto be a cog in the wheel\n\nof mass production.\n\nSpeed-up System\n\nBourgeois capitalists\n\nbelieve in the law\n\nof supply and demand.\n\nThrough mass production,\n\nbourgeois capitalists\n\nincrease the supply\n\nand decrease the demand.\n\nThe speed-up system\n\nand the extensive use\n\nof improved machinery\n\nhas given us\n\ntechnological unemployment.\n\nAs a Catholic worker\n\nsaid to me:\n\n“Ford speeds us up,\n\nmaking us do\n\nin one day\n\nthree times as much work\n\nas before,\n\nthen he lays us off.”\n\nTo speed up the workers\n\nand then lay them off\n\nis to deny the worker\n\nthe right to work.\n\nMakers of Depressions\n\nBusiness men used to say:\n\n“We make prosperity\n\nthrough our private enterprise.”\n\nAccording to business men,\n\nthe workers\n\nhave nothing to do\n\nwith the making of prosperity.\n\nIf the workers\n\nhave nothing to do\n\nwith the making of prosperity,\n\nthey have nothing to do\n\nwith the making\n\nof business depressions.\n\nThe refusal of business men\n\nto accept the responsibility\n\nfor business depressions\n\nis what makes the workers\n\nresort to sit-down strikes.\n\nIf business men\n\nunderstood business\n\nthey would find the way\n\nto increase the demand\n\nfor manufactured products,\n\ninstead of increasing the supply\n\nthrough the speed-up system\n\nand the extensive use\n\nof improved machinery.\n\nCollective Bargaining\n\nBusiness men\n\nhave made\n\nsuch a mess of things\n\nwithout workers’ co-operation\n\nthat they could do no worse\n\nwith workers’ co-operation.\n\nBecause the workers\n\nwant to co-operate\n\nwith the business men\n\nin the running of business\n\nis the reason why\n\nthey sit down.\n\nThe sit-down strike\n\nis for the worker\n\nthe means of bringing about\n\ncollective bargaining.\n\nCollective bargaining\n\nshould lead\n\nto compulsory arbitration.\n\nCollective bargaining\n\nand compulsory arbitration\n\nwill assure the worker\n\nthe right to work.\n\nThe Modern Mind\n\nOrganized labor,\n\nwhether it be\n\nthe A.F. of L.\n\nor the C.I.O.,\n\nis far from knowing\n\nwhat to do\n\nwith the economic setup.\n\nOrganized labor,\n\nas well as\n\norganized capital,\n\nis the product\n\nof the modern mind.\n\nThe modern mind\n\nis in such a fog\n\nthat it cannot see the forest\n\nfor the trees.\n\nThe modern mind\n\nhas been led astray\n\nby the liberal mind.\n\nThe endorsement\n\nof liberal economics\n\nby the liberal mind\n\nhas given us\n\nthis separation\n\nof the spiritual\n\nfrom the material,\n\nwhich we call\n\nsecularism.\n\nPaul Chanson\n\nOrganized labor,\n\norganized capital\n\norganized politics\n\nare essentially\n\nsecularist minded.\n\nWe need leaders\n\nto lead us\n\nin the making of a path\n\nfrom the things as they are\n\nto the things as they should be.\n\nI propose the formation\n\nof associations\n\nof Catholic employers\n\nas well as associations\n\nof Catholic union men.\n\nEmployers and employees\n\nmust be indoctrinated\n\nwith the same doctrine.\n\nWhat is sauce for the goose\n\nis sauce for the gander.\n\nPaul Chanson,\n\nPresident of the Employers’ Association\n\nof the Port of Calais, France,\n\nhas written a book\n\nexpounding this doctrine,\n\nWorkers’ Rights and the Guildist Order."
