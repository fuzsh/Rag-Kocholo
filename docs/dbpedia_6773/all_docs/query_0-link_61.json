        "text": "1. It is not possible to date precisely Jacob’s tenancy at the Quai aux Fleurs. In his letter to Kisling in January 1924, Jacob speaks of having been twenty years old at the time he lived at Quai aux Fleurs, which would situate the period earlier, in 1896. Henri Dion, who tried to establish a chronology of Jacob’s lodgings, threw up his hands at Quai aux Fleurs and wrote that it was “to be situated before 1903 or after October 1907.” Henri Dion, “Les logis de Max Jacob,” Centre de recherches Max Jacob, no. 5 (1983): 71. I find the memoir of Jean Valmy-Baysse most convincing, as he describes the room precisely and locates the scenes of his visits during Jacob’s attempts to paint, after having quit his job as an art critic. Jean Valmy-Baysse, “Souvenirs sur Max Jacob,” Aguedal 4, no. 2 (May 1939): 169–72. Valmy-Baysse dates the residency at Quai aux Fleurs to 1900 and 1901, up through Jacob’s discovery of Picasso’s work in June 1901—the name of the Spanish painter recurred frequently in Jacob’s conversation, Valmy-Baysse recalls. Furthermore, in his lecture at Nantes in 1937, Jacob mentions living at Quai aux Fleurs at the time of his meeting with Picasso. Hélène Seckel, Max Jacob et Picasso (Paris: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1994), 1.\n\n2. Valmy-Baysse, “Souvenirs,” 170.\n\n3. MJ, “Présentation de l’auteur par lui-même,” n.p.\n\n4.

MJ, “Présentation de l’auteur par lui-même,” n.p.\n\n6. The manuscript of Le Christ à Montparnasse is in ms. 7198-2 at the BLJD. Jacob included the Doucet poems in his OBM of 1912, DT of 1919, and LC of 1921. François Garnier, editor of the first edition of Jacob’s correspondence, assigns “En famille” vaguely to 1900 (Correspondance, ed. Garnier, 1:13) and “J’ai perdu le ciel” roughly to the same period (Correspondance, ed. Garnier, 1:21). Max Jacob, in the biography he practically dictated to Robert Guiette, describes his early struggles to turn “his excellent natural language into written French” and places them in the first period of his friendship with Picasso—which would be 1901—before another stint of odd jobs and his employment as secretary to a lawyer for an exhibit at Le Petit Palais later in 1901. The chronology in Guiette’s brief chapter is vague but covers the period 1900–1904 and emphasizes Jacob’s early poetic attempts. See Guiette, Vie, 50.\n\n7. Correspondance, ed. Garnier, 1:21.\n\n8. “Mille regrets” has a complicated history. The earliest version seems to be the one sent in August 1912 to Emma and Henri Hertz, recorded by Hélène Henry in Centre de recherches Max Jacob, no. 1 (1978): 41, and published in La Phalange in 1913, under the title “Mille autres regrets” (incipit “Jadis quand j’approchais . . .”). The Doucet manuscript contains an interim version rich in suggestive revisions. The final version appears in LC, in O, 564.\n\n9. MJ, “En famille,” Correspondance, ed. Garnier, 1:13. A slightly revised version was published in Les Soirées de Paris (November 15, 1913): 26, and in LC, in O, 623.\n\n10. Delphine resented Max’s impecunious manner of life. When he stayed with his family in Quimper, she even haggled with him over sugar for his morning coffee, so that he took to slipping into his pocket sugar cubes left over on his friends’ saucers at the Café de l’Epée. See the memoir by the painter Giovanni Léonardi, “Le poète Max Jacob, souvenirs quimpérois,” Centre de recherches Max Jacob, no. 8 (1986): 29. In the version of the poem published by Apollinaire in Les Soirées de Paris, another line, later deleted, insists on the authoritarian presence of the sister, who even seems to share the position at the head of the table with the mother. The lines run: “En haut de la table où ils étaient quatre, / La soeur écrivait sur un papier clair, / La mère en rêvant regardait ses bagues.” (The extra line in English runs, “The sister was writing on a bright sheet of paper.”)\n\n11. MJ, “Plainte du mauvais garçon,” was published, along with “En famille,” in Les Soirées de Paris (November 15, 1913) and in LC, in O, 564. In the manuscript and in Les Soirées de Paris, the poem is punctuated conventionally; it is not until 1921, in LC, that Jacob accentuated the poem’s fluidity by removing all the periods and commas, leaving only four exclamation points that serve more as indications for performance than as syntactic markers.\n\n12. Hélène Seckel quotes from Paul Léautaud’s journal, June 20, 1931, an unusually frank passage about Fernande Olivier’s account of Jacob’s sexual practices: “She spoke of Max Jacob’s homosexuality, of the disgust she had for his consorting with heavily mustachioed policemen and Republican Guards, idem. She asked him one day, ‘But after all, don’t you ever get rebuffed? Couldn’t that cause you trouble?’ Max Jacob assures her that it never happens, that there are many partners in the two units.” Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 35n24.\n\n13.

Hélène Henry devoted years of research to the quimpérois background of both the play and the novel TB.

The militant order of the Assumptionist Fathers, who published the anti-Semitic and anti-Republican newspaper La Croix, had already been dissolved. The law of July 1 required that remaining religious orders apply for legal authorization from the state or risk dissolution and forbade unauthorized orders to teach. Not until the ministry of Émile Combes in 1902 did the Republican anticlerical program go into high gear, banning eighty-one women’s orders and fifty-four men’s orders. In July 1904, all members of religious orders were forbidden to teach, secular officials took control of burials, and religious property was sold below its market value. All these measures fueled reactionary movements, such as Action Française, and led to the legal separation of church and state in 1904 and conflicts that gathered force again in the 1930s and prepared for Vichy. A typically lighthearted version of turn-of-the century anticlericalism appears in Max Jacob’s poem “1900”: “Suppression des fêtes de noces: / Plus de curé, plus de carrosses, / Voire plus de maire!” (No more celebrating marriages: / No more priests, no more carriages. / In fact, no more mayor!) DT, in O, 461. For a brisk account of the anticlerical laws, see Alfred Cobban, A History of Modern France (Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1965), 3:58–66.\n\n25.

The most sinister character was the Abbé Boullan, portrayed by Huysmans as “le Docteur Johannès” in Là-Bas. Boullan was rumored to have sacrificed a baby; he was imprisoned in Rome from 1860 to 1864 and excommunicated by the archbishop of Paris in 1875.

See Edmond Fleg’s preface to the edition of The Zohar that Max Jacob studied, translated by Jean de Pauly (Paris: Éditions du Chant Nouveau, 1946). Pauly’s translation is unreliable as a guide to The Zohar, but it’s the text that Jacob knew.\n\n30. Pierre Abraham, Les Trois frères (Paris: Éditeurs Français Réunis, 1971), 45, 46.\n\n31. In the sadness of hindsight, one notes that no branch of the family, practicing or nonpracticing, converted or unconverted, was spared the Nazi horror. Pierre Abraham’s mother was interned at the camp at Drancy where Max Jacob died, and she died at Auschwitz. Max’s cousin Noémie Gompel, Pierre Abraham’s aunt, committed suicide in Biarritz in 1940 upon learning of the German capture of Paris. Max Jacob, all his siblings, and his brother-in-law died directly or indirectly at the hands of the Nazis, except Maurice, who died in 1930, and Jacques, the tailor, who survived the war in Paris.\n\n32. Abraham, Trois frères, 45, 46.\n\n33. Typical treatment of the Kabbalah appears in the Anthologie de l’occultisme edited by Blaise Cendrars for Grillot de Givry in 1922. There, a few pages from The Zohar are jumbled in among fragments of Orphic hymns, Egyptian esoteric texts, and excerpts from Paracelsus and Swedenborg, to name just a few.

Pauly, 1:145b. Jean de Pauly translates from the Hebrew, emphasizing the image of the veil. In the Vulgate, the verse runs, “Revela oculos meos / Et considerabo mirabilia de lege tua,” which is translated quite literally in the King James version as “Open thou mine eyes” and in the standard French Bible of Crampon, revised by Joseph Bonsirven, as “Ouvre mes yeux.” La Sainte Bible, trans.

In the same paragraph in the lecture at Nantes in which Picasso is said to have declared, “You are the only French poet of the age,” Jacob briefly describes the origins and arc of his poetic career, collapsing his first meeting with Picasso in 1901 with events from the second phase of their friendship that began sixteen months later when they shared Jacob’s room in Boulevard Voltaire: “I had to earn my living, now that I was a great poet. I was an employee on Boulevard Voltaire, and I lived in a hotel room across from my store.” Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 244.\n\n60.

MJ, “Souvenirs sur Picasso,” 200.\n\n62. Seckel expresses surprise that Jacob should not have known of the large blue mother and child painted over his own portrait. But if one remembers that Jacob spent the end—and certainly December—of 1901 with his family in Quimper, it is understandable that he wouldn’t have followed the career of his portrait in a period when Picasso painted over many canvases and was about to leave for Spain.\n\n63.

It is not the case, as Jacob claimed to Guiette, that the publishing house had closed. See Alexander Dickow’s article, “Le Géant du soleil, un conte retrouvé de Max Jacob,” Cahiers Max Jacob, no. 15–16 (2015): 31–35. The story was published in four installments in Les Lectures de la semaine—pour la famille in March 1904 and is reprinted in Cahiers Max Jacob, no. 15–16 (2015): 37–59. Dickow examines the inaccuracies in Jacob’s account to Guiette, including the claim that he transformed the rejected Géant into the novel Le Phanérogame, published in 1918. There’s no overlap in the stories, but Dickow argues that Gaston Bonnier, the botanist from the Académie des Sciences who was associated with the Librairie générale and had commissioned and then refused Jacob’s book, becomes a kind of model for the pompous academics who populate Le Phanérogame. And Bonnier was the author of a scientific work entitled Phanérogames.\n\n2. In a letter to Jouhandeau, February 25, 1924, Jacob wrote, “The profound failure of Bouchaballe came from publishing in 1921 a work that had been conceived in 1903.” MJ, Lettres à Marcel Jouhandeau, ed.

This letter remains a puzzle, as Picasso didn’t publish drawings in Parisian journals in 1904. In 1901, he had drawings printed in Le Frou-Frou, and Jacob often tried to place his friend’s work in these years. Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 34n3.\n\n7. Ibid., 27.\n\n8.

MJ, Lecture at Nantes, ibid., 244.\n\n13. Olivier, Picasso et ses amis, 24. As Richardson points out, there are inconsistencies in Olivier’s accounts of her life before she took up with Picasso. The sculptor may have been called Gaston de la Baume, and Fernande herself went by various names: she was the illegitimate daughter of Clara Lang and an unknown father, and her legal name was Amélie Lang. She was brought up by her father’s half-sister, a Madame Bellevallé, and sometimes used that surname. Her first husband, a brute her family forced her to marry when she was eighteen, was called Paul-Émile Percheron, so for years her other legal name was Amélie Percheron, though she had run away from him after one miserable year.

The question of Cubist poetics has been much debated, and the hottest debates go back to 1917. Pierre Reverdy attacked the concept, rehearsing (without naming) what is essentially Lessing’s argument in The Laocoön that different media have different relations to space and time and cannot represent one another. Pierre Reverdy, “Notes et extraits,” Nord-Sud, no. 13 (March 1918). Max Jacob, on the other hand, saw his poetry in plastic and pictorial terms. Paul Dermée, in his lecture on Jacob in December 1916, compared his poems to Cubist paintings, and in 1927 Jacob stated the case to his mother: “Cubism in painting is the art of composing that painting in its own terms regardless of what it represents, and to give primary importance to geometric construction, invoking real life only through allusion. Literary Cubism does the same thing in literature, using reality only as a means and not as an end. Example: my Cornet à dés, and Reverdy’s work.” Ms. 12, Fonds Max Jacob, Médiathèque des Ursulines, Quimper. Michel Décaudin and Etienne-Alain Hubert give an excellent account of the history of the phrase “Literary Cubism” and its attendant controversies in “Petit historique d’une appellation: ‘Cubisme littéraire,’” Europe, no. 638–39 (June–July 1982): 7–25.\n\n34.

Other revisions of “Fortifs” provide important glimpses into Jacob’s process of composition. Une âme illuminée (an illuminated soul) becomes désolée (desolated, grieving); the bathetic pantelant (panting) becomes soucieuse (anxious for, devoted to). In the final quatrain, the nautical image is preserved but complicated in the move from coeur bien amarré (heart well moored) to éperonné (spurred, or rammed, by a ship). The sarcastic bec Auer de religiosités (arc light of religiosities) is tempered to luminaire de l’idéalité (“shining with ideality,” which I have translated “ideally starred”).

Different memoirists have insisted on dates ranging from 1903 to 1905, and scholars have made strong cases for both October 1904 and February 1905, with the evidence coming down to the blurred date on a postcard sent by Jacob to Salmon and to two different shows including works by Picasso, one in October 1904 at Berthe Weill’s gallery and one at the Galerie Serrurier in February 1905.\n\n47. Guiette, Vie, 71. Accounts of the meeting of Picasso and Apollinaire, and the subsequent meetings of Jacob and Apollinaire and Jacob and Salmon, form a specialized bibliography. The crucial memoirs are Salmon, Souvenirs, 1:164–68; Jean Mollet, Les Mémoires du Baron Mollet (Paris: Gallimard, 1963), 55; MJ, “Souvenirs sur Picasso,” 199–202; MJ, “Le tiers transporté”; MJ, Lecture at Nantes, in Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 244; and Guiette, Vie, 71. Salmon misremembers the year as 1903, an impossibility as Picasso was not yet at the Bateau Lavoir. Jacob in 1937 mentions 1904, a date Richardson also argues for (Richardson, Life, 1:327). Seckel has exhaustively examined the evidence, down to enlisting the aid of a postal specialist in the Musée de la Poste to decipher a blurred delivery date on the postcard Jacob sent to Salmon just after their meeting. On the basis of that card (February 1905, day illegible), and on the further evidence of Apollinaire’s pocket calendar for 1905 containing the addresses of Picasso and Jacob—at 13 rue Ravignan and 33 boulevard Barbès—(whereas his calendar for 1904 shows no recognition of their existence) Seckel situates the meetings in February 1905, just before the opening of Picasso’s show at the Galerie Serrurier, February 25. She is not doctrinaire about the matter, observing that it is one “which we do not claim to settle.” She assembles the data for this puzzle on page 37 and in the footnotes—which read like detective fiction—on page 44 of Max Jacob et Picasso. Didier Gompel-Netter and Annie Marcoux reproduce the crucial postcard in Les Propos et les jours (Paris: Zodiaque, 1989), 26. There is also controversy about which English bar on the Rue d’Amsterdam set the scene for Picasso’s encounter with Apollinaire. Apollinaire frequented both Austin’s Fox (variously spelled) and the Criterion, and both have been claimed.\n\n48. Pierre-Marcel Adéma made the case for an Italian army officer, Francesco Flugi d’Aspermont, as Apollinaire’s father in Guillaume Apollinaire, le mal-aimé (Paris: Plon, 1952). Francis Steegmuller tends to agree with him but presents as well the proposal by Anatol Stern that the mysterious father might be the son of Angelica’s distant elder cousin Melanie Kostrowitzky and Napoléon II, Napoléon’s son, the young man known as l’Aiglon.

Officially it was Austen’s Railway Restaurant, Hotel and Bar, 26 rue d’Amsterdam, and it served primarily English jockeys and trainers who drank there on their way to and from the racetrack at the Maisons Lafitte. As Francis Steegmuller discovered, the bar was also called Austen (or Austin) Fox’s Bar, Austin’s Fox Bar, L’Austin’s Fox, or Le Fox. Steegmuller, Apollinaire, 133.

Richardson reads the blurred date as October and thinks it refers to the group show including Picasso’s work at Berthe Weill’s gallery in October 1904.

The composition of Rimbaud’s Illuminations presents one of the most controversial problems in nineteenth-century French literary history. For a full account, see André Guyaux’s edition of Arthur Rimbaud, Oeuvres complètes (Paris: Gallimard, 2009), 939ff. Most of the prose poems of Illuminations were published in La Vogue in numbers 5, 6, 8, and 9, in May and June 1886; more were added in the 1895 Vanier edition of Poésies complètes. Prominent Symbolist poets (Gustave Kahn, Jules Laforgue, and Jean Moréas) and, later, Jacques Roubaud and others have seen Rimbaud’s two poems in vers libres from the manuscript, “Marine” and “Mouvement,” as the first French free verse. Guyaux disagrees, insisting that vers libre can only be conceived as emerging from metrical verse (Rimbaud, Oeuvres completes, 969). When Rimbaud was composing the Illuminations between 1872 and 1874, he had already loosened up metrical verse in the mystical poems written in 1872 included in “L’Alchimie du verbe” in Une saison en enfer. It seems to me that the experience of composing prose poems could have combined with his testing the boundaries of verse and that “Marine” and “Mouvement” can legitimately be seen as emerging from these two hybrid but distinct projects: vers libéré and the prose poem. Suzanne Bernard, in Le Poème en prose de Baudelaire jusqu’à nos jours (Paris: Librairie Nizet, 1959), establishes the full historical and editorial context in which the prose poem and vers libre emerged in the 1880s, as controversial then, perhaps, as now.\n\n108.

Richardson (Life, 1:397) thinks it occurred in October 1905, shortly after the purchase of Matisse’s Woman with a Hat. Rabinow thinks it happened in March 1905 after the Picasso exhibit at Serrurier et Cie (The Steins Collect, 28, 436). It hardly matters; it’s clear that Leo bought the Steins’ first Matisse and first Picassos in 1905, and that Gertrude was at first less than enthusiastic.\n\n125.

The color red is traditionally associated with the planet Mars and its god, and thus they appear in the mythological mishmash of SM, in O, 229. In the red cloth behind Jacob’s apparition, the color signified the zodiacal Heaven of Mars, Jacob explained in his article “La Clef des songes” in 1925: “The spirit or angel was not from the Heaven of Mars, but this color had a part to play in the whole symbolic structure: red suited the time in which the apparition occurred: it expressed that the moral revolution brought by the apparition was due to the epoch then being born of the rule of the Heaven of Mars (which brought us the Great War and the revolutionary state of mind of the modern world).” MJ, “La Clef des songes,” Philosophies, no. 5–6 (March 1925): 582. Jacob had long associated Mars with modernity; see his letters to his cousin Jean-Richard Bloch from June and July 1911: “In 1909 there was a revolution in the cosmos! The planet Mars came near the earth. Now Mars acts upon the moon and the moon is all artists worthy of the name.” MJ, “Lettres à Bloch, 1re partie,” 131–33. Jacob was still musing about Mars in the 1930s as he composed CTH. He saw Mars as disorder and the moon as creative order, the first, Futurist, the second, Cubist, and both “surreal.” Eerily, he predicted the end of World War II: “In 1945, Mars, having finished his task of butchery, will lose.” CTH, 20.

Further reprinted, with attempts to restore the earlier version and, somewhat weirdly, “to reproduce the account of [Jacob’s] conversion just as he himself would have written it if he hadn’t dictated it,” by Jacob’s younger cousin and a major collector of Jacobiana, Didier Gompel-Netter in La Vie spirituelle (May–June 1980): 393–403. A text originally dictated for private doctrinal purposes and never meant for publication reaches us in a somewhat fluid state. Gompel-Netter takes unusual liberties, however, in inserting paragraph divisions and removing adjectives on the sole basis of his subjective hunches about what Jacob might have done. The standard version of the text, based on the 1951 publication, appears in DT, 287, and in O, 1473.\n\n4.

Noting that Henri Dion had turned up evidence of the workmen having installed the skylight in Jacob’s room on December 2 and 3, 1909—an event Jacob also mythologized as preparing for Christ’s apparition—Andreu scratches his head and asks, “How could Max have been so persistently mistaken?” (Andreu, Vie et mort, 56). Seckel, too, notes the discrepancies in dates without trying to explain them (Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 73n13). Didier Gompel-Netter simply opts for September 22 (because it is one date repeated several times in DT) and then treats it as fact in his commentary on his presentation of a “restored” text of “Récit de ma conversion” in La Vie spirituelle (402). Richardson, with even less evidence, chooses October 7: “After taking Jacob’s illness and poetic license into consideration, I would settle for early October—partly because it was the time of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, which the poet had been brought up to observe” (Richardson, Life, 2:147). This reasoning flies in the face of the facts. Jacob was always clear about his family’s secular orientation and about the lack of Jewish religious observance in the household: “After the deaths of my grandparents, there was no longer any question of God or any religious observance” (“Récit,” in O, 1474). Jacob was lamentably ignorant about the Jewish calendar; in a letter dated September 29, 1914, he had to ask his cousin Jean-Richard Bloch to tell him the date of Rosh Hashanah (MJ, “Lettres à Bloch, 2e partie,” 143).\n\n13. Blanchet’s chapter on Jacob in La Littérature et le spirituel (Paris: Aubier, 1959) is the same text as the two articles he wrote under the pseudonym of André Vendôme entitled “La Conversion de Max Jacob,” published in Études, January–February 1948, 16–91 and 166–93, respectively.\n\n14.

Jacob appears to be as idiosyncratic in his use of Kabbalah as in his interpretations of Christian symbols. The Hebrew letter Tet, T, corresponds to the number nine. Matorel asserts that the number eight represents pure equilibrium, intelligence, and humanity, and that God is one (SM, in O, 233–36). Therefore the cross equals humanity plus God, 8 + 1. Elsewhere Jacob claimed that the number eight represented “spirit,” and the number one, God (Centre de recherches Max Jacob, no. 4 (1981–82): 15). He is free with his interpretations, promiscuously mixing Greek and Roman mythology with Kabbalah; in a letter to Jean-Richard Bloch written shortly after SM, he claimed that “beauty is in the number nine; this is the number of the moon, the moon is Diana and Diana is chastity” (MJ, “Lettres à Bloch, 1re partie,” 132).\n\n17.

In chapter 5, when Matorel has become Brother Manassé, the prior of the Lazarist Monastery of Saint Teresa of Avila in Barcelona, he is accosted by his old worldly friend Émile Cordier, now converted. Cordier represents one side of Jacob’s inner debate: “Look at this delicately sculpted little ivory Christ! That’s how we must adore the divine body: we must adore it by explaining it.” To which Matorel replies: “I used to think as you do, Émile, and I’ve had revelations on this subject, but I believe our salvation is in prayer.” SM, in O, 241.\n\n29.

Saint François de Sales’s devotional masterpiece from the seventeenth century, Introduction à la vie dévote, presents a picture of Christian life adapted to worldly, everyday circumstances; it is aimed at people living in “the world,” not at religious extremists, ecstatics, or would-be saints. It was popular in this period of intensified Catholic life and conversions in France.

MJ, “Lettre de Max Jacob à Charles Vildrac,” Création 5, no. 13 (1974): 13–14. Jacob’s periphrases in this letter suggest that he wasn’t enthusiastic about Vildrac’s tame free verse. But he expresses affection for the man and an appreciation for the “frankness” and “freshness” of Vildrac’s style. Most revealingly, he predicts that Vildrac will make his mark as a playwright, which turned out to be true when his plays L’Indigent and Le Paquebot Tenacity won popular success. In 1910, Vildrac, with his friend (and brother-in-law) Georges Duhamel, published a treatise on free verse, Notes sur la technique poétique, which influenced contemporary French poetry and, through Eliot and Pound, poetry in English.\n\n75.

Jules Romains, in a memoir published in his old age (“Max Jacob,” Revue des deux mondes, October 1970, 13–18), claims that Jacob told him of finding a Breton worker in the Métro who would translate the poems of La Côte into Breton. But Romains’s piece is so full of errors that it can hardly be trusted. (He remembers Gustave Gompel as a shoe manufacturer, not a department store magnate; he reports that Jacob “didn’t especially admire” Picasso’s art (!); he thinks Jacob went right after his vision to a priest at the Sacré Coeur (whereas it was in the little local church). Romains’s library had been ransacked by the Gestapo, and he was an old man relying on a faulty memory. Some of the anecdotes he recounts have a ring of truth, such as his recollection that Jacob found sexual partners in the police force.\n\n90.

Fort was elected Prince des Poètes in 1912. Oddly enough, some of his ballads did enter modern folklore by being set to music later by Georges Brassens. Francis Jammes was a poet from the Pyrenees whose lyrics of country life, especially in his book De l’angélus de l’aube à l’angélus du soir, had been welcomed in Paris as a refreshing antidote to high Symbolism.\n\n94.

The so-called Persian poems, which survived in OBM as twenty-four miniatures called “Persian Poems” (OBM, in O, 300), seem to have been inspired by prose renditions of lyrics from the twelfth-century Persian poet Saadi and other classic Persian poets Jacob would have found in the recently published anthology of translations by Hoceyne Azad, La Roseraie du Savoir (Leyde: Brill, 1906). The vogue for these poems is evident in a group adapted and published by Franz Toussaint under the title “Le Jardin des roses” (The Rose Garden) in Apollinaire’s journal Les Soirées de Paris, no. 9 (1912): 265–68.

But in May 1939, in his last letter to the young Egyptian poet Edmond Jabès, he wrote (heartbreakingly) that he was “out of this world” and expected “martyrdom” but that he was working on a book about the Scriptures that would “illuminate the question of the Biblical role of the Jews.” He imagined that the book would be published by the Nouvelle Revue Française and that it was his “duty.” MJ, Lettres à Edmond Jabès (Alexandria: Éditions du Scarabée, 1945), 61. In 1941, he wrote to Henry Lasserre about lassitude in finishing his book on the Scriptures, which the anti-Jewish laws of Vichy would prevent him from publishing in any case.

The French manuscript original for the first article, “Vrai sens de la religion catholique,” was discovered and published by Philippe Schmitt-Kummerlee, “Un manuscrit retrouvé.” A draft of the French original of “Las Plagas de Egipto y el Dolor” is preserved in the Médiathèque d’Orléans, ms. 2271.

Only the year before, in 1911, the Futurists in Milan knew nothing of the radical developments in painting that were taking place in Paris. The young painter Gino Severini, who now lived in Paris and was good friends with Picasso, Jacob, and the gang, was appalled at the provincialism of his friend Umberto Boccioni and the other Futurists when he visited them in Milan in 1911. On his urging, Marinetti, who had funds, paid for Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, and Luigi Russolo to travel to Paris and spend two weeks being guided around the studios by Severini. They were entranced by the work they saw. Their belligerence and claims of priority a year later thus seemed little less than outrageous. Severini considered himself an avant-garde artist and signed the two Futurist manifestos of painting in 1910, but he had serious reservations about his friends’ work and came to regard Marinetti as a public relations “manager,” whose goal was “a vain and materialistic exhibitionism.” Gino Severini, La vita di un pittore (Milan: Edizioni di Comunità, 1965), 106–15. Futurist painting was first proclaimed in two manifestos in the spring of 1910: “Manifesto of the Futurist Painters” published as a leaflet by Poesia in Milan, February 11, 1910; and “Futurist Painting: Manifesto,” published by Poesia, April 11, 1910. Both were signed by Boccioni, Carrà, Russolo, Balla, and Severini, in that order. Caws, Manifesto, 178–84.\n\n28. Apollinaire, Anecdotiques, 16, 64.\n\n29. On March 7, 1914, Apollinaire’s journal Les Soirées de Paris published an official, notarized statement by Arthur Cravan withdrawing his allegation in his journal Maintenant that Apollinaire was Jewish, thus avoiding a duel. Apollinaire’s seconds, Jérôme Tharaud, “Homme de lettres et Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur,” and Claude Chérau, “Artiste peintre,” followed Cravan’s declaration with this statement: “As our friend Guillaume Apollinaire has accepted this rectification as sufficient, we have notified M. Arthur Cravan of our reception of his letter, and as agreed between him and us, we present it in this notarized document to be published in the press, and we declare the incident closed.” Soirées de Paris, no. 22 (February 1914): 131.\n\n30.

Soffici had first met Jacob and Picasso in 1901 in the chambers of the weekly Le Cri de Paris, a spin-off from the high Symbolist journal La Revue blanche, where the young Italian was trying to sell his drawings. Jacob was peddling Picasso’s drawing, as he often did in those days. Soffici gives a vivid glimpse of the pair: “One of them, a thin Jewish type, pale, smooth-shaven, already bald and missing teeth, wrapped up in an overcoat too light for the wintry season, the other short and thick-set, equally smooth-shaven but with an energetic expression, his dark and very mobile eyes gleaming under a severe forehead crossed by a lock of black hair hanging down over his eyebrows. They had come together to offer to Natanson [the editor of La Revue blanche and Le Cri de Paris], as a cover for Le Cri de Paris, an ink drawing of a perverse-looking woman, a little in the style then much in fashion, of the English Pre-Raphaelite Aubray Bearsley [sic], the illustrator of Oscar Wilde’s Salome.” Soffici, Il Salto vitale, 3:323.\n\n31.

Hélène Henry quotes the letter and the poem in “Dans l’ombre de Max Jacob,” 41. The poet Henri Hertz made his living as a journalist and editor and also wrote fiction. He had met Apollinaire and Salmon in 1903 in the Symbolist circle of La Plume and met Jacob the following year. In 1909, he co-founded the leftist journal Démocratie sociale, and in 1932 he served as the secretary general of the French section of the World Jewish Congress. He and Emma fled Paris after the passage of the Vichy anti-Semitic legislation in 1940 and spent the war in Lyon, Grenoble, and Brittany, engaged in clandestine work.\n\n67. The early version, “Mille autres regrets,” appeared in La Phalange, no. 86 (August 1913): 125. The final version, “Mille regrets,” was published in LC, in O, 564. Jacob’s alchemical symbols on this page of the notebook from 1912 all come from a single page in chapter 74 of volume 1 of Cornelius Agrippa’s La Philosphie Occulte ou la magie, first published in Latin in 1533, a book Jacob had studied since boyhood. The symbols represent the “intelligence of the moon” and various “demons of the moon.” A German doctor, astrologer, and magician, Agrippa served various European monarchs and is still known for his ingenious versions of magic squares, grids in which the numbers of every column, every row, and the two main diagonals add up to the same sum.

A copy of the unpaginated original is in the Archives départementales du Loiret, ms. BH M 5226 (1–2). Moricand’s memoirs are unreliable when he is relaying stories about la bande à Picasso he has heard secondhand from Jacob and Salmon, and the man himself is profoundly untrustworthy—a narcissist and pedophile who, when he lost his fortune in 1934, made a small living casting horoscopes and writing astrological articles and relying on rich patrons (like Anaïs Nin). During World War II, he collaborated with the Vichy government and the Nazis as a journalist for Radio Paris and later for propaganda radio in Germany. He knew Jacob well and “collaborated” with him—in another sense—on the astrological book Miroir d’astrologie; when he writes about scenes he actually lived, like meeting Jacob at the Rotonde, the stories ring true.\n\n61.

MJ, “Le Bal masqué,” “Quelques personnages du bal masqué: I, Malvina; II, Marsupiau,” Soirées de Paris, no. 19 (December 15, 1913): 29–32. “Le Bal masqué” is reprinted in LC, in O, 620; “Malvina” in LC, in O, 624, lacking its original ninth line (“Diabète est à la fois, pour moi, diable et bête”). “Marsupiau” appeared in LC, in O, 622, with small revisions: the masculine “chéris” (my dears) of line 5 has been made feminine, and the phrase at the end of the original line 6, “Pas de coton,” has been kicked down to become line 7 on its own. Jacob justified much of the highly indented lineation of the versions in Soirées to a predominant left margin in LC.\n\n65. Apollinaire described the duel the next day in Paris-Journal.

Elizabeth Bishop translated the poem but never published it; her version is in her papers at Vassar College.\n\n75. CD, in O, 376. Jacob reprinted neither of the other poems from this issue of Les Soirées de Paris. “La Vie d’artiste” and “Romances dans le gout de temps: Printemps” are charming pieces; the first in rhyming alexandrines, the second in free verses all rhyming on the syllable “ou.”\n\n76. Reading different accounts of the auction of La Peau de l’Ours can be confusing because Picasso’s star painting was known by two different titles (Les Bateleurs and La Famille des Saltimbanques) and because some authors (Cousins, “Documentary Chronology,” 425; Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 110; Assouline, L’homme de l’art, 223) cite the basic price of 11,500 francs, while others (Richardson, Life, 2:297; Michael Fitzgerald, “Skin Games,” Art in America, February 1992, 78) use the final price including the 10 percent premium paid by the buyer, 12,650 francs.

Salmon, Souvenirs, 2:233. Jacob’s poem turns somersaults in its rhymes and plays with conventions of whodunit plots. This version has a short prose section, “Partie critique,” giving Jacob’s analysis of the Fantômas formula and deriding the style; he remarks also on the use of character types—“the characters are numerous, new, precise, picturesque, and rise to the level of type as in Balzac or Eugène Sue”—a method he would use in his own fiction.

In the journal, the entry “Monday, first day of my work of conversion” isn’t dated, and it’s followed by “Tuesday 2” which doesn’t correspond (December 2, 1914, fell on a Wednesday). But the other dates do align with December 1914: Friday 4, Saturday 5, and so forth. It’s odd that Jacob confuses the date of the apparition of Christ to him at the movies, an event that would prove fundamental to his life, but between his visions, his feverish literary work, and his chaotic personal life, he was hardly living in calendrical time. And throughout his life he was careless about dates. Years later, dictating his story to Guiette, Jacob telescoped the whole process. Guiette, Vie, 89.\n\n34. DT, in O, 482.\n\n35.

In “Examen sur la foi” (Examination on Faith), the voice asks, “You who seek me, why do you chase me away?” In “Examen sur l’espérance,” Our Savior addresses him directly: “You flee me even as you seek me!” He published the sections under the title “Le Christ à Montparnasse” in Les Écrits nouveaux 3, no. 16–17 (April–May 1919): 70–82.

Richardson discusses the Harlequin in detail in the chapter entitled “Picasso and Cocteau,” since the insistent young Cocteau had given the painter a harlequin costume in the hope of having his own portrait painted. Picasso never did paint Cocteau, though he eventually drew him. Richardson illustrates the stages by which Picasso’s harlequin became a self-portrait with an allusion to Matisse’s obscured self-portrait in Interior with Goldfish, now also at the Museum of Modern Art. Richardson’s analysis of Seated Man is even more instructive, showing photographs of various stages of this painting that is rarely seen, since it is in a private collection.\n\n71.

Severini recounts how Picasso recommended that he seek the care of a Doctor Reventos in Barcelona who was famous for curing lung diseases; Jacob, Picasso, and Hélène d’Oettingen raised the money to send Severini to Barcelona for several months, while young Jeanne and their new baby waited for him in Paris in a cramped apartment with Jeanne’s mother and Paul Fort’s mother. They lived on a pittance Jeanne’s mother earned at the town hall of the fourteenth arrondissement. Paul Fort, the Prince des Poètes, had abandoned his family to live in the country with a new mistress.

Devotees of Max Jacob will recognize that word “situated,” which would become a key term in Jacob’s theory of the prose poem.\n\n84. Richardson, Life, 2:282.\n\n85. Reverdy, Voleur de Talan, 174–75.\n\n86. MJ to Paul Bonet, cited in catalogue, Hôtel Drouot, Exposition, December 1, 1989, item 215. Reprinted as “Petit historique du Cornet à dés” in CD 15 (1967). In 1916, Jacob described Reverdy as “either a talkative Southerner or very quiet, very diplomatic, uncultured, he’s found a single note he plays in verse and prose. . . . It’s all delicate and lugubrious. My little prose poems, but sad.” MJ to Picart Le Doux, in “Montparnasse 1916 vu par Max Jacob,” Nouvelles littéraires, March 9, 1950, 5.

Picabia loved fast cars and took several epic journeys across France with Apollinaire in 1912, including one to the Alps, where the poet is supposed to have found the title to his poem “Zone.” Gabrielle Buffet, “Apollinaire,” Transition Fifty, no. 6 (1950): 110–25.

As Seckel notes, a mangled version of Jacob’s piece was published by Maria Green in Centre de recherches Max Jacob, no. 6 (1984): 63–67, with the erroneous date February 1916. Seckel concludes, “Only a return to the manuscript and a rigorous exegesis will permit a proper account.” Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 125. The manuscript is in the Beinecke Library at Yale University (YCAL mss. 85, Box 99), along with the correspondence between Stieglitz, Picabia, and Jacob pertaining to the publication of his articles. The Yale manuscript differs in minor ways from the published version; clearly, Jacob corrected proofs.\n\n96. Vittorio Rieti, interview by author.\n\n97. Seckel, Jacob et Picasso, 128. Léonce Rosenberg’s place would be taken, discreetly at first, by his brother Paul, who would become the principal dealer for Picasso and Braque until World War II and would make a fortune from marketing art.\n\n98.

Jacob came to regret his behavior, if one can believe a letter he wrote in February 1917 to Édouard Gazanion about l’affaire Ève Picasso: “Religion taught me that I was wrong, and that’s all.” MJ, Amitiés, 1:59.\n\n100. MJ, “La Vie artistique,” 291, no. 12 (February 1916): 4. The archives of the Beinecke Library contain the correspondence relating to these publications. Jacob was to have contributed a third article, and the file contains a tantalizing manuscript of prose poems Jacob intended for 291, which ended up in CD: “Night and Light” (the original title is in English), entitled “Aube ou crepuscule” in CD, in O, 411; “Ma vie ces dernières années,” entitled “1914” in CD and in Nord-Sud, no. 2 (April 15, 1917); “La guerre,” CD, in O, 352, and also in Nord-Sud, no. 2; and the marvelous fragment from the sequence in part 1, section four of CD, in O, 654: “L’enfant, l’éfant, l’éléphant, la grenouille et la pomme sautée,” an untranslatable game of syllables “jumping” from sense to sense, through the made-up word l’éfant, and playing on the jumping images of the frog and the sautéed “apple” or, in slang, potato (pomme de terre): “the child, the efant, the elephant, the frog and the sautéed apple.” Jacob scribbled a note on this last one: “Picabia, I beg you, leave this one out if you think it’s too banal.” Far from banal, it’s a key to Jacob’s method of derangement and rearrangement of sonic, semantic, and imagistic sense. Another draft in this file, “La Vie chrétienne,” found its place in DT as “Le ou les diables: lesquels?” (DT, in O, 498). A sign of Jacob’s complex feelings about Reverdy is his dedication of the poem “Ma vie ces dernières années” to his rival. Jacob seems to have imagined—however whimsically—founding a school of his own, “L’École de la rue Ravignan,” as all the prose poems in this manuscript are dedicated to artists or writers Jacob identifies with this “École”: “Pierre Reverdy, poète de l’école de la rue Ravignan”; “Night and Light” is dedicated to “Juan Gris, peintre de la rue Ravignan”; “La guerre” is dedicated to “Laurens, sculpteur de la rue Ravignan,” and so forth. Even while chastising Reverdy, Jacob was trying to position him as a follower.\n\n101. MJ, “Jugement des femmes,” CD, in O, 419.\n\n102.

In the draft in the Beinecke, the Art Critic addresses “Ribera,” the name by which Jacob called Rivera; that name is crossed out and replaced by “Weiluc,” further complicating the delirium of claims of ownership of artistic property.

Paris-Midi, through October and November 1912, reported on the Balkan uprisings against the Turks. “Lightning March of the Bulgarians upon Constantinople,” ran a headline on October 26, 1912, and the Greeks that day were reported to be sixty kilometers from Thessaloniki. On November 9, headlines announced, “Constantinople Burned and Pillaged by Kurds.” Two days later, the paper questioned, “A European War?” and described military preparations in Russia; on November 23, the paper reported that the Austrian army had mobilized. One can see the makings of world war in the autumn of 1912, as well as the conditions leading to terrible Turkish reprisals.\n\n110.
