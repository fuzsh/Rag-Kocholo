        "text": "PARIS, April 28 — Jacques Maritain, the renowned Roman Catholic philosopher, died today, apparently of a heart attack, in Toulouse at the community house of the Little Brothers of Jesus, where he had lived in retirement since 1960. He was 90 years old.\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Raissa, Mr. Maritain decided to spend the remainder of his life following the humble religious rule of Les Petits Freres de Jesus at their house in southern France.\n\nA Powerful Mind By ALDEN WHITMAN\n\nWith a mind of brilliant power, a personality of engaging warmth and a pungent prose style, Jacques Maritain, a gentle and shy man, was among this century's most influential philosophers and intellectuals. His domain was metaphysics, yet the impact of his thinking in this abstrusity was almost as great on the secular world as it was on the religious. He was among the first 20th‐century philosophers to urge Christian involvement in secular affairs.\n\nIn the United States, the Frenchman's works were studied in most Roman Catholic colleges. He himself lectured at Princeton, Columbia and Notre Dame, and his books were widely read by the public for their humanist content.\n\nIn France, Mr. Maritain was an inspiration to Francois Mauriac, the Nobel Prize novelist and essayist; to Julien Green, the Franco‐American novelist; and to Jean Hugo and Georges Rouault, the painters. Atheists such as Jean Cocteau, the writer, also came under his spell, as did hundreds of other non‐Catholics or nonreligious persons.\n\nThe preponderance of Mr. Maritain's influence, however, was exerted in the Catholic Church, where he was, one observer said, “a pressure group of his own.” A convert in his college years, he molded a philosophy of Christian worldliness that was a major factor in creating the climate of opinion leading to Ecumenical Council Vatican II in 1962 and the drive to “renew” Catholicism.\n\nHis humanist views were frequently invoked at the council, and at its conclusion Pope Paul VI embraced him in St. Peter's Square. The Pope, it was said, considered making nim a cardinal and would have if he had been younger. He was 83 at the time.\n\n“I am a disciple of Maritain,” Pope Paul once said. “I call him my teacher.”\n\nTranslated His Book\n\nTheir friendship started in 1928, when Paul, then Giovanni Battista Montini, translated Mr. Maritain's “Three Reformers,” a book on Luther, Rousseau and Descartes, from French into Italian. After World War II, when Mr. Maritain was French Ambassador to the Vatican, the two saw each other regularly and often dined together.\n\nMr. Maritain's influence on Pope Paul was direct (he was even cited along with Church Fathers in the encyclical “Populorum Progressio” in 1967) and indirect on Pope John XXIII. He was consulted by Pope Pius XII and by his predecessor, Pius XI. It was through Mr. Maritain that Pius XI, in 1927, chided Action Frangaise, a militant rightist group in France.\n\nChristian humanism, as Mr. Maritain elaborated it, was a subtle philosophy, an application of the principles of Thomas Aquinas, the 13th‐century scholastic, to 20th‐century problems of art, science and society. Seeking to blend revelation and reason, Mr. Maritain strove to accommodate Catholicism to the political and social forces loosed by the Industrial Revolution. He held that Catholic dogma was eternally true but that it should focus on the world as it is. In short, the state of men's societal and economic needs was as much his church's concern as the state of their souls. He sought to close the gap between spiritual and mundane matters by stressing the role of reason and conscience, by accenting personalism.\n\nSumming up his views, he wrote in “The Range of Reason” in 1952:\n\n“The best means for winning victories of the spirit is not to barricade one's self behind the walls of a fortress but to go out into the highways to conquer through love and the gift of self.”\n\nNeed for ‘Living Faith’\n\n“It has become clear,” he added, “that a decorative Christianity is not enough, even for our existence in this world. The faith must be an actual faith, practical and living. To believe in God must mean to live in such a manner that life could not possibly be lived if God did not exist. Then the earthly hope in the Gospel can become the quickening force of temporal history.”\n\nIn a famous passage ire “True Humanism,” published in 1936, he wrote:\n\n“These two planes [spiritual land temporal] are clearly distinct, as the things which are Caesar's and the things which are God's.\n\n“They are distinct, they are not separate. To make Christianity an abstraction, to put God and Christ on one side while I work in things of the world, is to cut myself in two halves: one Christian half for the things of eternal life —land one for the things of time, la pagan or semi‐Christian or ashamedly Christian or neutral half.”\n\nMr. Maritain mace it clear by his support of political and religious pluralism, that he did not envision a return to medievalism and that he did not endorse a Fascist corporate state. On the contrary, he preached the dignity of man, his earthly worth and the need to satisfy his human wants.\n\nAs one who argued for the oneness of humanity, Mr. Maritain was a strong proponent of ecumenism and a stanch Ispokesman for those who succeeded, at Vatican II, in exculpating the Jews from the ageold charge df deicide. This accusation stemmed from Biblical accounts of the Crucifixion.\n\nBy many who disputed his views Mr. Maritain was ranked as a left‐wing Catholic. He shocked conservative critics by contending that sacral Catholicism was not enough and by supporting, among other things, the worker‐priest movement that sprang up in France after World War II. In this movement, which caused concern in the Vatican, priests lived as workers, toiling with their parishioners. Worker‐priests exemplified, for Mr. Maritain, an laspect of pastoral Catholicism. “Christianity should be worldly; the church should open itself to the world as it is,” he asserted.\n\nRejecting both capitalism and socialism, “which are both tainted by a materialistic conception of life,” Mr. Maritain counseled that “what we need is a new solution, at once personalistic and communal, which views human society as the organization of liberties.”\n\nHe was especially eager to heal “the divorce between the working classes and the church” by having the church concern itself with labor's temporal problems, lest workers be led astray “by the evangel of despair and social warfare.”\n\nMr. Maritain was no stranger to controversy, mostly with fellow Catholics more conservative than he. But at the close of his life he found himself attacked by some of his early disciples as having backed away from the consequences of his own liberalizing concepts.\n\nRestiveness on Dogma Decried\n\nThe occasion was his book “The Peasant of the Garonne,” which contained astringent criticism of the late Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit who appeared to question accepted Catholic belief on the decried of man. The book also decried what Mr. Maritain regarded as dangerous consequences of Vatican II, especially a spirit of restiveness over church dogmas. He put his attitude this way:\n\n“My God, were not these dogmas defined, and once and for all?... Has not church doctrine been established with certainty...? What man, having received theological faith, could be idiot enough to imagine that eternal truths were going to move...?”\n\nScornfully attacking “genuflection to the world,” he ridi culed his opponents by pare phrasing them:\n\n“The objective content of the faith to which our ancestors were so attached — all that is mythology. Why take the trouble to deny hell, since it is easier to forget it? And probably we should do the same with the Incarnation and the Trinity.\n\n“Ephemeral though they are, these writings [on dogma] threaten to disorient completely the Christian conscience and the life of faith.”\n\n‘Crowning of My Thought’\n\nMr. Maritain denied that he had repudiated himself. “‘The Peasant of the Garonne’ is the crowning of my thought, which has continued always in the same direction,” he said in the spring of 1967 through the Rev. Henry Bars, a close friend. Mr. Maritain elected to speak through Father Bars, for many years his confessor, because he said he was too frail to he visited at the monastery in Toulouse where he lived.\n\nThe philosopher said that he was always opposed to alterations in dogma. “There is a difference,” he explained, “between changing dogma and perspective on it. Even though dogma may evolve, it is always the same dogma.\n\nAlthough Mr. Maritain once described “The Peasant of the Garonne” as “my final testament,” he added two codicils —“Concerning Grace and the Humanity of Jesus” and “Concerning the Church of Christ.” The second appeared in his 89th year.\n\nA search for the absolute was crucial in Mr. Maritain's life and works. Born in Paris on Nov. 18, 1882, Jacques Maritain was the son of a prosperous lawyer and the grandson, on his mother's side, of Jules Fevre, one of the founders of the Third Republic. The boy was reared in an atmosphere of liberal Protestantism, a rationalist approach to religious matters.\n\nAt the Sorbonne the young student searched the worlds of philosophy for a framework of beliefs that he could accept, rejecting in turn academic philosophy and materialism until he came upon Henri Bergson's socialism and philostophy of intuition. This attracted Mr. Maritain for a time, yet he came to feel that Bergson did not sufficiently explain eternal verities.\n\n“The best thing I owe to my studies at that time is that they brought me into touch with the woman who, ever since, in all my work, has always been at my side in a perfect and blessed union,” Mr. Maritain recalled later.\n\nIn 1904 he married his fellow student, Raissa Oumancoff, the daughter of a Russian‐Jewish family and, like himself, consumed to discover the ultimate meaning of life. Describing their impasse, Father Bars said:\n\n“Maritain and his wife found themselves in a state of profound spiritual disarray. Both had lost their faith, and they both contemplated suicide if they did not discover the absolute truth and the absolute. Then they met Leon Bloy, a tremendous believer in Catholicism, and after several encounters with him they asked to be guided, like people in the desert. In a while they asked for religious tuition, and they were baptized, with Mrs. Maritain's sister, Vera, on June 11, 1906.”\n\nHelped Compile Dictionary\n\nAfter his conversion Mr. Maritain, who had received his degree at the Sorbonne in 1905, considered abandoning philosophy on the ground that “the wisdom of the saints would be sufficient.” For several years he worked in Germany and, returning to Paris, helped compile a dictionary of practical knowledge on such matters as crocheting, cookery and fishing.\n\nAt the same time, in independent reading, he encountered Thomas Aquinas and fell in love with his complex system of thought based on the compatibility of faith with knowledge through reason.\n\n“My vocation as a philosopher became clear to me,” he said. “‘Woe is me should I not Thomize [teach Aquinas],’ I wrote in one of my first books.”\n\nBeginning in 1913 he taught philosophy, mainly Thomist doctrine, in many institutions of learning, Catholic and nonCatholic, in several countries. For some years he was at such institutions as Louvain, Oxford, Heidelberg, the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto, Chicago, Princeton and Columbia, as well as at colleges in France.\n\nMr. Maritain's lectures and reading turned into books, which won him recognition as a leader in the Catholic intellectual revival. Over the years he produced more than 50 books, not all of which have been translated into English. His most significant of those in English were “Three Reformers,” “Art and Scholasticism,” “The Things That Are Not Caesar's,” “The Angelic Doctor,” “True Humanism,” “Scholasticism and Politics,” “A Preface to Metaphysics” and “The Peasant of the Garonne.”\n\nIn the twenties the philosopher was associated with Action Frangaise, which he later considered one of the gravest mistakes of his life. His disavowal of the movement, he said, implied disagreement with rightist politics. He was not a member of any political party, however.\n\nWhen the Germans overran France in 1940, Mr. Maritain was lecturing in the United States. He remained here during the war and became president of the Ecole Libre des Hautes Etudes, a school for exiled French and Belgian scholars.\n\nFor most of the war the Maritains lived in Greenwich Village. His tall, slim, whitehaired figure and his handsome, mustached face were a familiar sight in the streets of the Village as he walked daily to mass at St. Joseph's Church. Acquaintances were impressed by his extreme gentleness and his pleasant and courtly manner.\n\nAt evening parties that the Maritains gave, lofty conversation flowed easily in both French, and English as the guests and hosts consumed peanuts and sipped ginger ale. “Maritain,” said Reinhold Nicbuhr, the Protestant theologian, “belongs to that small company of great spirits in any age from whom one may learn.”\n\nMr. Maritain, after completing his diplomatic mission to the Vatican from 1945 to 1948, lived and taught at Princeton until 1952, when he was named professor emeritus.\n\nIn addition to numerous academic honors, Mr. Maritain was a commander of the Legion of Honor and a commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. He was also given the Medal of the French Resistance and the Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX. As a writer, he received the Grand Prize of Literature from the French Academy in 1961 and the French National Grand Prize for Letters in 1963.\n\nFor years Mr. Maritain had a small house in Meudon, a suburb of Paris, but shortly after the death of his wife in 1960, he went to live with the Little Brothers of Jesus, a Dominican community on the banks of the Garonne in Toulouse. The community ministered to the spiritual needs of nearby workers."
