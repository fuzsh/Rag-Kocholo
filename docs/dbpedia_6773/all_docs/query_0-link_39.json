In every depart¬ ment of life traditional principles have been shaken and discredited, and we do not yet know what is going to take their place. There are those who hold that Europe has had her day and that our culture has entered the first stage of an inevitable process of decay, while others believe that we are only beginning to realise the possibilities of mod¬ ern science and that we are about to see the rise of a new social order which will far transcend anything that the world has known. One thing is certain—the old order is dead; and with the old order there has passed away that traditional acceptance of the truth of Christianity and that general recognition of Christian moral principles, which even in the nineteenth century still retained so strong a hold on the minds of men. It is the aim of the present series to attempt to face the problems which arise from this new situation and to examine the possibilities of co-operation and of conflict that exist between the Catholic order and the new world. It will not confine itself to any single aspect of the ques¬ tion, but will deal with general principles and with the\n\nVI\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nconcrete problems of contemporary life. Indeed, it is im¬ possible to limit the inquiry to any one field, since the present disorder and confusion of ideas shows itself in every department of thought—in literature and philoso¬ phy, no less than in sociology and ethics. Hence, it is clear that this series must be tentative and unsystematic in char¬ acter. It cannot attempt to propound a definite solution or to embody a formal programme. For Catholicism has no policy nor can the Catholic compete with the Marxian Socialist in offering the modern world a panacea for its material ills. Yet it would be equally impossible to dis¬ miss the problems of the modern world as though they had no meaning for those whose lives were based on the supernatural certitude of the Christian faith. The Puritan or the sectarian Christian can isolate himself from the age in which he lives and construct a private world in harmony with his religious convictions. But for the Catholic this should be impossible. Catholicism stands essentially for a universal order in which every good and every truth of the natural or the social order can find a place. The disorder of the modern world is due either to the denial of the existence of spiritual reality or to the attempt to treat the spiritual order and the business of everyday life as two independent worlds which have no mutual relations. But while Catholicism recognises the distinction and the autonomy of the natural and the supernatural orders, it can never acquiesce in their segregation. The\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nVll\n\nspiritual and the eternal insert themselves into the world of sensible and temporal things, and there is not the small¬ est event in human life and social history but possesses an eternal and spiritual significance. It is the Catholic ideal to order the whole of life towards unity, not by the denial and destruction of the natural human values, but by bringing them into living relation with spiritual truth and spiritual reality. But this can only be achieved if Catholics are prepared to make the neces¬ sary effort of moral sympathy and intellectual comprehen¬ sion. If they remain passively content with their own pos¬ session of the truth, they do not, it is true, compromise the divine and indefectible life of the Church, but they prove false to their own temporal mission, since they leave the world and the society of which they form a part to perish. As Maritain writes in the following essay: \"It is certain that some good and some truth are immanent in the new temporal forms which are emerging from the obscure chrysalis of history, and that they manifest in some way the will of God, which is absent from nothing that exists. They may in the same way serve eternal interests on this earth.” It is our business to understand all this, and in order to do so it is necessary to be equally on our guard against the weak acquiescence in current fashions of thought which would cause us to lose our grasp of the eternal principles and from that “narrowness of heart\n\n••• vm\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nwhich prevents us from knowing the work of man” and doing justice to the work of God in time and history. Difficult as this task may be, there is, we believe, a greater opportunity for carrying it out than at any time during the last hundred years. The old barriers are fall¬ ing, and though the destructive and negative tendencies in modern culture have destroyed much that was valuable in the traditions of the past, they have also swept away many of the inherited prejudices and fixed forms of thought which isolated the Catholic tradition from vital contact with the realities of modern life. The present generation is intensely sensitive to the exist¬ ence of a religious problem. It is true that the ordinary Englishman no longer goes to church and that his theo¬ logical beliefs are so vague as to be practically non-existent. He does not take religion for granted, as he did in the last century, when church-going was a mark of social respect¬ ability and religion occupied a distinct and strictly limited place in the national life. But this is very largely due to a recognition of the unreality and narrowness of the old sectarian ideals. There is a justifiable reaction against a type of religion which imposed rigid restrictions on any kind of rational enjoyment, while it left men free to exploit one another and to make life hideous in the race for wealth. To-day men demand of religion that it should be in touch with realities, that it should offer some solu-\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nIX\n\ntion to the social and intellectual problems of the modern world and that it should be at the service of human needs, though at the same time they often fail to realise the abso¬ lute and transcendent element which is inseparable from any true religious ideal. Consequently, if the interest in religion is weaker to-day than in the last century, it is t\n\nwider and more diffused. It has come out of the pulpit and the meeting-house into the columns of the daily Press and the programmes of the B.B.C.\n\nBoth in England\n\nand America there is a constant stream of literature deal¬ ing with religion and the modern age and with the prob¬ lems of Christianity in the light of modern knowledge. Unfortunately, the greater part of this literature is of little positive value. It witnesses to a real need, but it provides no adequate solution. It is vitiated by a complete absence of philosophical principles and by a vague optim¬ ism which slurs over the real difficulties of the situation and offers good will as a substitute for clear thinking. In order to come to terms with the modern world it has jettisoned the theological traditions of Protestant ortho¬ doxy, and it is left with nothing but moral ideals and social aspirations unsupported by any solid intellectual founda¬ tion. The writers of such literature can have neither sym¬ pathy nor understanding for Catholic thought. To them Catholicism seems entirely out of touch with the needs of the modern world. They regard it as a refuge for those shrinking souls who are unable to face reality, and its\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nX\n\nphilosophy as a relic of mediaeval obscurantism. But in reality it is they themselves who are living in the past and who do not realise that a new age has begun. Just as the schoolmen of the seventeenth century went on discussing the problem of the fifth essence and the theories of Aris¬ totelian cosmology when Galileo and Newton were creat¬ ing their new physical synthesis, so to-day the representa¬ tives of modern religious thought continue to murmur their platitudes about the liberation of religion from dogma and the ethical genius of Christianity, when the world is turning away from subjectivism and idealism and once more seeks absolute standards and spiritual realities. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is true, the whole trend of Western civilisation was hostile to Catholicism.\n\nThe absolutism and realism of Catholic\n\nphilosophy was incomprehensible to an age which fol¬ lowed Rousseau and Kant, or Bentham and Herbert Spen¬ cer. When Pius IX. denied that it was the duty of the Church to come to terms with Liberalism and Progress and Modern Civilisation, his pronouncement was greeted with a chorus of execration from every country in Europe. It seemed as though the Papacy was pronouncing its own sentence of death, for the triumph of material progress seemed inevitable and no one could conceive the possi¬ bility of its failure.1 1 Cf. Maritain, The Things That Are Not Ctesa/s, App. V., \"On Liberalism.”\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxi\n\nTo-day all this is changed—Liberalism and Progress and Modern Civilisation appear in a very different light from that of seventy years ago. We no longer believe that prog¬ ress is a necessary and automatic process, and that if men are left free to follow their own devices they will inevi¬ tably grow wiser and happier and more prosperous. We admit the reality of modern progress as a vast material achievement, but it means something very different from what our predecessors believed. Human life, like animal life, depends on a balance of forces, and if the balance is upset by the removal of restrictive factors, the process of readjustment is full of danger and difficulty. Thus the rapid growth of wealth and population which followed the Industrial Revolution does not continue in¬ definitely; it creates its own limits by calling into existence new restrictive forces. Machinery makes possible a vast expansion of industry, but it also leads to over-production and unemployment. Science increases man’s control over disease, but it also adds to the destructiveness of war. Colonial and economic expansion gives Europe the hege¬ mony of the world, but it also awakens the hostility and rivalry of the oriental peoples. Capitalism creates new sources of wealth, but it also involves exploitation and social unrest. It is now generally realised that we cannot progress indefinitely by drifting with the current, for the same cur¬ rent which has brought us to prosperity and power may\n\nXll\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nequally drag us to destruction. Order and guidance are necessary if disaster is to be avoided, for civilisation is not the result of a natural process of evolution, it is essen¬ tially due to the mastering of Nature by the human mind. It is an artificial order, governed and created by man’s intelligence and will. There is no question to-day of the necessity of order; the only question at issue is whether the order we create shall be exclusively a material one, or whether it must be also spiritual. This is the vital issue of the modern world. On the one hand we have the Communist solution which is the only thorough-going and consistent attempt to create an order on exclusively material foundations. But there is also the American solution which is less uncompromising, and also less inhuman. It is based on a combination of the political tradition of Liberalism and democracy with the material order of a standardised mass civilisation. As a working system it is infinitely more successful than the Russian experiment, but there is a latent contradiction between its political ideals and its economic practice, which produces intellectual dissatisfaction and moral unrest. There is no organic connection between the mechanism and material¬ ism of the new mass civilisation and the old ideals of political liberty and social democracy which have their origin in the simpler conditions of an earlier period. Con¬ sequently, the American solution is not an absolute one.\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxm\n\nIt is bound up with local and temporary conditions, and its evolution is still incomplete. On the other side we have the historical tradition of European culture. That tradition has never been a purely material one, for in the past it was bound up with the Christian religion, and during the last century it has been largely identified with the ideals of liberal humanitarianism and liberal nationalism. The French Revolution and English Liberalism, the Italian Risorgimento and German Nationalism, Parliamentarianism and Socialism—all these movements have contributed to the making of modern Europe and all of them possess a spiritual element. Yet they are not of themselves capable of producing a spiritual order. They are essentially impure phenomena, mingling idealism with selfishness and spiritual aspirations with materialistic aims. During the last half century, however, they have all been undergoing a kind of negative purifica¬ tion. The nationalism of Mazzini and Young Italy has become transformed into the nationalism of Mussolini and the Fascists. English Liberalism has passed from the hands of Lord John Russell and Gladstone to those of Mr. Lloyd George.\n\nSocialism has descended from the visions of\n\nUtopia to the realities of Westminster. The making of a world safe for democracy has involved four years of inten¬ sive slaughter and a peace that is in danger of ending peace.\n\nXIV\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nIn every case it has been the ideal element that has suf¬ fered, and to-day all the ideals that inspired the nineteenth century are shattered and discredited. Liberalism is every¬ where in decline, and Parliamentarianism and democracy have suffered a general loss of prestige.\n\nNationalism\n\nalone is still powerful, but in a grim and menacing shape which bodes little good to the cause of civilisation. This decline in the forces of idealism does not, how¬ ever, necessarily prove that Europe is ready to accept a purely material order. On the contrary, our confidence in material order is diminishing in proportion to our loss of faith in nineteenth-century ideals. We feel the need for spiritual order far more acutely than did the prosperous and self-confident nineteenth century, but we no longer believe that it will be the inevitable result of the political and economic evolution of the modern world. For behind all these various disappointments and disillusionments there is something still more profound—we have lost our faith in humanity, and that faith was the central dogma and inspiration of the whole modern development. This is somewhat surprising when we consider that the modern world is supposed to have begun with a revolt against the anthropocentric Weltanschauung of the Christian world, but as T. E. Hulme trenchantly says, “The change which Copernicus is supposed to have brought about is the exact contrary of the fact. Before Copernicus man was not the centre of the universe; after Copernicus he was. You get\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxv\n\na change from a certain profundity and intensity to that flat and insipid optimism which, passing through its first stage of decay in Rousseau, has finally culminated in that state of slush in which we have the misfortune to live.”\n\n1\n\nBut during the present century there has been a gen¬ eral reaction against this idealisation of man. The psy¬ chologists have sounded the depths of the human soul and have found nothing there but a little mud. The men of letters have blasted the romantic view of life with ridicule and scorn. The artists have substituted abstract for natu¬ ralistic ideals. The physicists have abandoned the naive empiricism of the old scientific materialism for the mathe¬ matical abstractions of Relativity. Even the philosophers have begun to desert the tradition of subjectivity and ideal¬ ism and are returning to realism and ontology. This philosophical reaction is particularly marked in Germany, so long the stronghold of the opposite tradition. Even the neo-Kantians are retracing their steps and rein¬ terpreting their master in the light of the older traditions of European thought. The philosophy of Aristotle and St. Thomas is no longer relegated to the limbo of dead sys¬ tems, and there is a distinct tendency in German thought towards metaphysical and epistemological realism. It is obvious that these changes have a profound effect in the attitude of the European mind towards religion. 1 T. E. Hulme, Speculations, p. 80.\n\nxvi\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nThe exaltation of man and the idealisation of Nature led to the depreciation and the denial of spiritual reality. Protestantism succeeded in accommodating itself to the modern environment by the abandonment of metaphysics and dogma and a concentration on ethical ideals. But Catholicism could not live in an atmosphere of subjective idealism and moral pragmatism. It was forced to go into the desert. To-day we are witnessing what Wust has called \"the return of Catholicism from exile.” Once more Catholic thought can find a place in European culture and can give its message to the modern world. For Catholicism is not compromised by the bankruptcy of nineteenthcentury idealism. It has never denied—as sectarian Chris¬ tianity tends to deny—the existence and the good of the natural order, but it recognises the limitations of human nature and maintains that spiritual order is only attainable in the light of absolute spiritual principles. Hence the remarkable revival of Catholic intellectual life that has taken place during the last twenty-five years. Half a century ago it was taken as a matter of course in France and Germany that the intellectual should be an unbeliever, and that the practising Catholic should be an exile from the living thought of the age. To-day this is no longer the case, and it is among the intellectuals and the men of letters that the influence of Catholicism is most marked. This is most strikingly exemplified in respect to philosophy, where the Thomist revival inaugurated by\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxvn\n\nPope Leo XIII. has been justified by results. In France we have Pere Sertillanges and M. Maritain, both of them brilliant interpreters of St. Thomas to the modern world; M. Gilson, the historian of mediaeval thought; and the late Pere Rousselot, S.J., the author of that remarkable book, L’lntellectualisme de St. Thomas. In Belgium there is the\n\nSchool of Louvain, which has been for forty years a pioneer of the Catholic revival of philosophical studies, and which has recently produced a work of the first impor¬ tance in Pere Marechal’s Point de Depart de la Metaphysique. In Germany the revival of Catholic thought first\n\nshowed itself in the historical work of scholars like Denifle, Ehrle, Baiimker, von Herlting, and Grabmann, who have done so much to restore our knowledge of mediaeval thought in all its branches; but the influence of Newman, as well as that of modern German thinkers like Max Scheler also contributed to the renewed activity of Catholic thought. It is true that Scheler’s personal adhesion to Catholicism was incomplete and temporary, but his criti¬ cism of Kantian ethics and his return to objective spiritual values in his treatment of ethical and sociological prob¬ lems made the intellectual world conscious of the spiritual riches of the Catholic tradition and aroused Catholics themselves to a new consciousness of their intellectual mission. Consequently, the last few years have seen a remarkable development of religious thought; and to-day it is in Germany that Catholic philosophy is most in con-\n\nXV111\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\ntact with the tendencies of modern thought and most alive to the needs of the present age, as we shall see in the work of such writers as Przywara, Wust, Carl Schmitt, Theodor Haecker and von Hildebrand. At the same time there has been an equally striking revival of Catholic activity in the field of pure literature. This is most obvious in France, where so large a number of the younger writers have devoted themselves to the service of Catholic ideals.\n\nThe movement had begun\n\nbefore the war with Peguy and Claudel and Psichari, and it owed much to the influence of Maurice Barres, although he was not himself a Christian. To-day it is represented by poets and dramatists like Claudel and Henri Gheon, critics such as Henri Bremond, Charles du Bos, Gabriel Marcel and Henri Massis, and novelists such as Francois Mauriac and Julian Green—these, with many others, contributing to such series as the Roseau d’or, the Cahiers de la Nouvelle ]ournee, the Questions Dispute es and Virgile. In Germany this movement is more recent and is far less known in this country. This is regrettable, since the German situation has many points of similarity to our own. The central tradition in German literature is derived from a Protestant culture, and Catholic writers in the past have suffered from the restricted atmosphere of an opposi¬ tion minority culture. To-day, however, these disadvan¬ tages are being overcome by a new spirit of confidence and intellectual energy, and one has only to look at modern\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxix\n\nCatholic reviews, such as Hochland or Der Gral to realise the vitality and activity of the new movement. In England, Catholics suffer in an even greater degree from the same unfavourable conditions that exist in Ger¬ many, yet here also there is a noticeable revival of literary activity among English Catholics; indeed, their achieve¬ ment is greater than we should expect from the social and numerical weakness of the Catholic element. Nevertheless, the Catholic intellectual revival, as a whole, is predominantly a Continental movement, and its significance is not yet realised in this country. The exist¬ ence of Catholic philosophy is hardly recognised except in academic circles, and it is still possible for writers like Dr. Coulton and Bishop Barnes, whose own mental outlook is entirely that of the past, to treat Catholicism as an ex¬ ploded superstition which is completely out of touch with the mind of the present age. It is one of the chief aims of the present series to make the contemporary movement of Catholic thought on the Continent better known in this country. In an age when England is ceasing to be an island, and when the external forms of civilisation are becoming everywhere more uni¬ form and more cosmopolitan, it is necessary for all of us to do what is in our power to restore the intellectual com¬ munity of European culture—and for Catholics before all, since they stand almost alone to-day as the representatives\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nXX\n\nof a universal spiritual order in the midst of the material and external uniformity of a cosmopolitan machine-made civilisation. We must not, of course, exaggerate the importance of the intellectual element in the Catholic revival. It would be a great mistake on the part of Catholics to claim for themselves a monopoly of intelligence. Catholicism makes its appeal, not to those who demand the latest intellectual novelty nor to those who always want to be on the win¬ ning side, but to those who seek spiritual reality. Our advantage lies not in the excellence of our brains, but in the strength of our principles. Like the proverbial conies, we may be a feeble folk but we make our dwelling in the rocks. Our thought is not \"free” in the sense that it is at liberty to create its own principles and to make gods in its own image. But it is just this \"freedom” which is the cause of the discredit and anarchy into which modern thought has fallen. The attempt of the nineteenth century to prescribe spiritual ideals in literature and ethics, while refusing to admit the objective existence of a spiritual order, has ended in failure, and to-day we have to choose between the com¬ plete expulsion of the spiritual element from human life or its recognition as the very foundation of reality. In so far as the modern world accepts the latter alternative, it can no longer disregard the existence of the Catholic solu¬ tion, for Catholicism is the great historic representative of\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nxxi\n\nthe principle of the spiritual order—an order which is not the creation of the human mind, but its ruler and creator. The following essay of M. Maritain’s deals with this problem in its most fundamental aspect—it is concerned with the essential relations between religion and culture. It carries the discussion of the inter-relation of the spiritual and the temporal, which was the subject of the same author’s The Things That Are Not Ccesar’s, out of the political sphere to its ultimate spiritual and metaphysical basis. It is an old subject and one that has been buried under the accumulated debris of dead controversies and extinct heresies, but none the less it remains a living issue for the world to-day, not only to the Catholic, to whom this essay is primarily addressed, but to all those who be¬ lieve in the social realisation of Christian principles. M. Jacques Maritain is one of the most representative figures in that Catholic intellectual revival which has al¬ ready been referred to. The idea of spiritual order has been the guiding principle of all his literary activity and he has been one of the leaders in that reorientation of thought which he has himself defined as Ma return to the real and the absolute, by the way of intelligence, for the primacy of the spirit.”\n\nIf his allegiance to the pure\n\nThomist tradition seems at times to lead him to an exces¬ sive depreciation of modern philosophy and modern scien¬ tific method, it must be remembered that this is not due\n\nXXII\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTON\n\nto any lack of familiarity with them. He was a pupil of Bergson and came to St. Thomas fresh from the study of the moderns.\n\nIndeed, it was his very familiarity with\n\nmodern thought which led him to appreciate the objectivity and intellectual strength of the philosophia perennis. The author of the second essay, Peter Wust, is a thinker of a very different type.1 His philosophy is not the result of the acceptance of a classical tradition but the fruit of an intense personal struggle, the goal of a long spiritual odyssey. The motive of his speculation was not an intel¬ lectual curiosity, but a spiritual need. As Fichte says, in a sentence which Wust takes as the motto of his work, \"We begin to philosophise out of wantonness and thereby we destroy our innocence: and then we realise our nakedness and thenceforth we philosophise from the need for deliver¬ ance.” Nevertheless, Wust, no less than Maritain, represents the same movement of return from subjectivity to realism and to the primacy of the spiritual which is characteristic of the new tendency of European thought. He has described the state of spiritual isolation and exile which was the por¬ tion of a Catholic in the intellectual world of Berlin twenty years ago, and the gradual change of thought in the years which followed the war that has liberated German Cathol¬ icism from the spiritual Ghetto in which it had been con¬ fined for so long. That state of things has passed away, 1 Crisis in the West.\n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTON\n\nxxiii\n\nlet us hope for ever, and the way is open for a renaissance of Catholic action, both in intellectual and social life, but for that very reason a new responsibility rests on us all to-day.\n\nChristopher Dawson.

Such a figure gives us an idea of what that culture means in the vocabulary of philosophy, the culture not of an expanse of soil, but of humanity itself. Man being a spirit animating a body of flesh, his nature in itself is a progressive nature. The labour of reason and the virtues is natural in the sense that it is in conformity with the essential inclinations of human nature; it brings into play the essential springs of human nature. It is not natural in the sense that it is sup¬ plied ready made by nature; it is an addition to what nature produces by itself and by itself alone. Nature, no doubt, can also be considered without this labour of reason, and as reduced therefore to energies of a sensitive order and mere instincts, or considered before this labour of reason, that is to say, in a state of, as it were, embryonic involution and absolute primitiveness. Culture so appears to be natural to man in the same 3\n\n4\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nsense as the labour of reason and the virtues of which it is the fruit and earthly fulfilment: it answers the fundamental aspiration of human nature, but it is the word of the spirit and liberty adding their efforts to the effort of nature. Instead of the word culture, which relates to the rational development of the human being considered in all its gen¬ erality, I might equally well have used the word civilisa¬ tion,\n\nwhich relates to that same development considered\n\nin an eminent case—I mean to say in the production of the State and civil life of which civilisation is, as it were, the prolongation and enlargement. The State and civilisation are, at one and the same time, works natural to man and works of reason and virtue. Many German and Russian philosophers draw a dis¬ tinction between civilisation and culture and employ the former, conceived in a pejorative sense, to denote a de¬ velopment of social life which is above all material, mechanical and extrinsic (a decrepit and sclerosed cul¬ ture) . We are free to define the terms we use as we like. In the sense in which I understand it, a civilisation is de¬ serving of the name only if it is a culture, a truly human and therefore mainly intellectual, moral and spiritual development (taking the word spiritual in its widest acceptation). Three observations may be related to the foregoing re¬ marks. My first observation is that culture or civilisation, presupposing both nature and the labour of reason, ought\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n5\n\nto keep within the line of nature, but may deviate from that line, allow itself to be sponged upon by an artipcialism contrary to nature and by perversions of varying degrees of gravity (even in animal \"communities” we see commu¬ nities of ants ruined by a passion for the intoxicating sugar they derive from certain domesticated inseas, which devour the eggs of these drug-addicted ants 1). If the per accidens is confused with the per se, it must be admitted with Rousseau, at the sight of such perverted and there¬ fore execrable societies, that culture and civilisation, left to themselves, corrupt man. But as perseities are unavoidable and as civilisation of its very nature derives from reason, it is impossible, and this is my second observation, impossible, I say, to execrate civilisation without, at the same time, execrating the form of reason, the formation vitally achieved by reason in human things, for that would be to assert the pre-emin¬ ence of potentiality and the formless, on the pretence that they are more productive. My third observation is that, if we do so, we tend to the destruction of man. Man, unlike the other animals, has not a solid rock bottom, as it were, of instinctive life 1 \"Many symphilics devour the eggs of ants, others suck their blood, others again lay their eggs in the larva?. Nevertheless, the colony of ants maintains and carefully feeds its guests in order to obtain the liquid for which they have such a marked preference. This liquid is not a food, but a sweet, and the ants sacrifice their young to obtain it, often even to the point of endangering the State.” F. Buytendijk, Psychologie des animaux, Payot, 1928, p. 161.\n\n6\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nconstituting a definite structure of behaviour sufficiently determined to make the exercise of life possible. Any erosion or excavation or elimination of rational life in an attempt to discover that solid rock bottom is a deadly error. There will be no end to the excavation, there is no solid and perfect structure, no natural regulation of the instinctive human life. The whole play of the instincts, be they as numerous and powerful as you like, is, in the case of man, open and exposed to view, involves a relative indetermination which finds its normal perfection and normal regulation in reason alone. If Freud absurdly calls the child a polymorphous pervert, it is because he fails to take account of this indetermination. A general philos¬ ophy of a very inferior kind prevents this very remarkable observer (who is also goaded by a violent metaphysical hatred of the form of reason) from distinguishing between potentiality and act; he substitutes for potentiality a sum of conflicting actualities, for indetermination orientated towards normal actuation (but susceptible of manifold abnormal actuations) a constellation of opposite actua¬ tions, in which what we describe as normal ceases to be normal and becomes merely a particular instance of the abnormal. Nevertheless, the kind of infinitude peculiar to the mind in the case of the human being gives a sort of infinity, a sort of indetermination, to the very life of the senses and instincts, which is incapable of finding its natural point of fixation—I mean in conformity with the\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n7\n\npeculiar requirements and destinies of human nature— elsewhere than in reason and the formations which reason produces. Otherwise it will be fixed awry, as any chance dominating passion determines, and deviate from nature. The truly and fully natural man is not nature’s man, the uncultivated soil, but the virtuous man, the human soil cultivated by undeviating reason, man formed by the inner culture of the intellectual and moral virtues. He alone has a consistency, a personality. If nature by itself alone were formed in us, had a counte¬ nance, there would be reason to fear that every virtue might be like the false virtues, like the pharisaical vir¬ tues, and distort that countenance or cover it with a plaster. But nature acquires a countenance in our case only when it is perfected by the mind, man acquires his truth only when he is fashioned from within by reason and virtue (I mean undeviating reason whose supremacy in our life is guaranteed only by the supernatural gifts; I mean true virtue which is entirely deserving of the name only if it is vivified by charity). Genuine sincerity presents a mirror which is clear as crystal to the larvae dwelling in us and contemplates them with courage, in order to give them a human countenance by a work of freedom; it does not re¬ fuse to bear a countenance. There is no more mendacious influence than sincerity as conceived by Andre Gide, the resolution of the human being in the vain postulates, dis-\n\n8\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\ncordant and simultaneous, of the formless, the materia prima. I will not continue the parenthesis. Let our conclusion be that culture or civilisation is the expansion of the peculiarly human life, including not only whatever mate¬ rial development may be necessary and sufficient to enable us to lead an upright life on this earth, but also and above all the moral development, the development of the specu¬ lative and practical activities (artistic and ethical) pecu¬ liarly worthy of being called a human development. It is important in the next place to realise fully that cul¬ ture or civilisation by its very nature belongs to the temporal sphere, in other words has a specifying object— the terrestrial and perishable good of our life on this earth—the subject matter of which is of the natural order. It must doubtless be subordinated to eternal life, as an intermediate end is subordinated to the ultimate end. And such subordination to a superior end gives it an intrinsic superelevation in its own peculiar order: a Christian civil¬ isation has higher standards, a more perfect earthly propriety than a pagan civilisation; if we reflect that the friendship of charity itself constitutes the essential bond of peace in Christian civilisation, that the infused moral virtues inform social life in Christian society, we see that the supreme moral regulations, by virtue of which it per¬ forms its work on earth, fall within the province of the\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n9\n\nsupernatural order. Even a Christian civilisation, however, a civilisation superelevated in its peculiar order, because it is Christian, by virtues proceeding from above, becomes so super elevated through realising (rather than through the unaided forces of nature) the very postulates of nature. It applies the rules of the Christian reason to a subject mat¬ ter in the natural order, versatur circa materiam naturalis ordints/ and the sphere in which it develops so considered may be said to be the sphere of the natural activities. In itself and by its specific object, it is involved in time and the vicissitudes of time, is perishable, essentially human. And it incorporates the benefits it derives from the super¬ natural order, from the virtues of the saints, for example, or the intercession of the contemplatives, in its own pecu¬ liar substance, draws them towards its own peculiar end, which still remains, even superelevated, a certain common good of man on this earth, in his terrestrial life. Because this human development is not only material, but also and mainly moral, it goes without saying that the part played in it by the religious element is consequently a principal part. In truth the religion which the concept of culture or civilisation, in abstracto, of itself requires is only natural religion. But human civilisations have in fact re¬ ceived a better, and more onerous, burden. We know “that a state of pure nature, one in which God ex hypo the si had 11 am applying here to Christian culture in general the expression used by John of St. Thomas with reference to the infused moral virtues. Cf. Curs, theol., Vol. VI., disp. xvi., a 7, § 29.\n\n10\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nabandoned man to the sole resources of the activities of his mind and will, has never existed. From the earliest times God willed to bring to the knowledge of men things far in excess of the requirements of any nature that ever was or ever could be created. He revealed to them the depths of His divine life, the secret of His eternity. And to guide their footsteps to such heights, to prepare them, on this earth already, for the vision of such splendours, He spread over the world, like a tablecloth, grace which was capable of divinising our knowledge and our love. God makes such divine advances to all men at all times; for He is the light 'which enlighteneth every man,'\n\n1\n\nHe\n\nwill have all men to be saved, and to come to the know¬ ledge of the truth.’ rejected.”\n\n2\n\nHis advances are accepted or\n\n8\n\nThis is the reason why none of the religions recorded in history is the simple natural religion contemplated in the abstract by philosophers. There are, no doubt, many features to be found in such religions answering the natural religious aspirations of the human being, but all in fact derive from a more remote origin, all retain some vestige of the primordial revelations and ordinations, and have all, with the exception of the religion of Christ, declined from the supernatural order and more or less deviated consecutively from the natural order. And these religions, let it be observed, by the very fact 1 St. John i. 9. * 1 Tim. ii. 4. * Ch. Journet, Vie bitellectuelle, March, 1929, p. 439.\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n11\n\nof becoming naturalised, of shrinking to the dimensions of fallen nature, became particularised to some definite cul¬ ture hostile to other cultures, became differentiated like languages and social groups. The piety of pagan antiquity admirably perceived the vital need the State has of reli¬ gion; its great misfortune was that it absorbed religion into civilisation, into a particular local civilisation, by con¬ fusing the State and religion, by deifying the State, or—it comes to the same thing—by nationalising the gods who were turned into the first citizens in the State. In this sociological collapse of religion is doubtless to be found the deepset cause or at all events the most significant char¬ acteristic of polytheism, which was nevertheless powerless to efface completely the fundamental \"henotheist” feeling. The marvel of Israel, a supernatural marvel, forcibly im¬ posed on stiff rebellious necks is that the God of Israel is also the one, transcendent, ineffable God, the God of Heaven and earth, of the whole earth. Exclusivism and universalism, observed Pere Clerissac—\"the Decalogue appeals not to a local conscience but to the conscience of all mankind; and the Jerusalem of Messianic times is the vision of a country which is chiefly spiritual, the country of souls. The Prophets speak and strive with the sole object of securing the predominance of the Kingdom of God which is in men’s hearts in the first place and embraces all nations.”\n\n1\n\nEverywhere else in the ancient world nationalism 1 Le Mystere de l'£glise, 3rd Ed., Saint Maximin, 1925, p. 22.\n\n12\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nsponged upon and corrupted religion; it absorbed religion in culture, made it an element of a civilisation, of a culture. I mean to say that the ancient world, while riveting social life to, and occasionally crushing it under, religion, while honouring religion with a terrifying power of veneration, while enslaving man to the gods, nevertheless enfeoffed religion to civilisation—not in the least after the manner of the modern profane world, which makes religion the mere servant of civilisation considered as something supe¬ rior, but on the contrary by making religion the governing principle of the State, yet individuated by the State, living with the same unique and indistinct life, ruling like a ’ despot over the State, but inconceivable without the State, and bound substantially to it, enclosed within the State, determined and circumscribed by the State and, finally, in an absolutely metaphysical sense, existing for the State, as the soul of a plant exists for that plant. The caritas humani generis appears but as a wan, sublime and ineffec¬ tive prefiguration of authentic charity, a mere philosopher’s ideal, a sigh heaved by reason, alien, if not hostile, to religion. True religion, however, is supernatural, come down from Heaven with Him Who is the Author of grace and truth. It is not of man or of the world or a civilisation or a cul¬ ture or of civilisation or culture: it is of God. It transcends every civilisation and every culture. It is the supreme bene¬ ficent and animating principle of all civilisations and cul-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n13\n\ntures, while in itself independent of them all, free, uni¬ versal, strictly universal, Catholic. It is with reference to those two aspects of things, the necessary immanence of the religion of Christ in culture, as of God in the creature —and the absolute transcendence of that same religion— that I would offer the following observations.\n\nII THE CATHOLIC RELIGION AND CULTURE The modern world is no more a creation of polemics\n\nthan modern philosophy: it is a certain historical type of civilisation, spiritually dominated from the very beginning by the humanism of the Renaissance, the Protestant Ref¬ ormation and the Cartesian Reform. What are its char¬ acteristics from our present point of view? Like every other civilisation it contains a positive element of ontological tension and vitality which in this case seems to be consti¬ tuted by a courageous, untiring effort to make human nature yield its maximum earthly output. But this positive element, good in itself, praiseworthy and deserving of affection, is accompanied by a privation. Let me say—it has become a commonplace, but is none the less eternally true—that culture, while continuing its natural growth, has become separated in the modern world from the sacred and turned back on man himself. The Middle Ages had fashioned human nature according to a \"sacral” type of civilisation, based on the conviction that earthly institu¬ tions, with all their vigour and strength, are at the service of God and divine things to realise His Kingdom on this 14\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n15\n\nearth. The Middle Ages doggedly strove to realise that Kingdom on earth, dreaming—yet without any rigour of austerity and without preventing life from pursuing the normal course of its activity—of a hierarchically unified world, in which the Emperor on the summit of the tem¬ poral should maintain the body politic of Christendom in unity, as the Pope on the summit of the spiritual main¬ tained the Church in unity. Such was the dream of the Holy Roman Empire, a dream which constituted an ideal, a ’'myth” strictly appropriate to the cultural conditions of the period; it was a dream which has been dissolved for ever: it presupposed, along with a magnificently bold ap¬ preciation of principles, a vast ignorance of the uni¬ verse and an imperious optimism: its corpse has long encumbered modern\n\nhistory.\n\nIt\n\nrequired\n\nNapoleon\n\nand the whole nineteenth century to bury it once and for all. To return, however, to the modern world. The object of culture, as that world conceives it, is purely terrestrial ends which are henceforth self-sufficient, no longer super¬ elevated in their peculiar order by their ordination to the Kingdom of God; to use a word which latterly has enjoyed considerable vogue, it is a type of anthropocentric culture. We should not forget that in virtue of a natural law of growth and as a consequence of the leaven of the Gospel deposited in humanity, a certain progress takes its course in the heart of that civilisation, a progress which may be\n\n16\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\ndescribed as material if the word material be understood in its widest philosophical extent, for the equipment of culture has progressed not only in the order of the scientific and industrial means of exploiting nature, but also in the order of intellectual, artistic and spiritual means and technique. There has even been a rise in the level, I do not say of moral life or moral ideals, but of the ideas and feelings which constitute the static conditions as it were of moral life. That the structure is a fragile one, I am well aware; be that as it may, the idea of slavery or torture or the use of military methods to impose constraint upon con¬ sciences and a certain number of similar ideas are, it would appear, spontaneously repugnant at the present day to more people than formerly; disapproval of such ideas, at any rate, has attained the dignity of an official common¬ place, and that is always something. In short, it appears that in retiring within himself man has undergone as it were in spite of himself the introvertive movement peculiar to the mind; he went inside his own self—and his object was not to seek God. A general progress in the assumption of self-consciousness has thus been the characteristic of modern times. While the world turned away from spirituality par excellence and that love which is our true end to proceed towards exterior advan¬ tages and the exploitation of sensible nature, the universe of immanence was opening its doors—and sometimes they were very low—a subjective intensity of scrutiny was re-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n17\n\nvealing their own peculiar spirituality to science, art, poetry, to the very passions of man and his vices, and the exigency of liberty became all the more clamorous as men moved farther and farther away from the true conditions and the true notion of liberty. In a word, in virtue of the law of compensation that governs history, the reflex age, with all the diminutions and losses which the word con¬ notes, involved in other respects an undeniable enrich¬ ment, which must be considered a positive gain, in the knowledge of the creature and human affairs, even though such knowledge was destined to find its outlet in the inner hell of man gnawing his own vitals. That murky way is not a blind alley and the fruit gathered in passing has been incorporated into our substance. I had in mind everything that I have just summarily in¬ dicated when I referred to the material progress taking place in modern civilisation and the effort being made therein to make human nature produce its maximum earthly output. Need I add—it explains certain aspects of the modern world—that many things which ought to have been done (and at all costs, because the will of the Master of history brooks no let or hindrance), many things which Catholics should have done, were done by others and against them, when Catholics failed? Heresies, also, and schisms, wars and catastrophes, the Devil himself, are under the univer¬ sal dominion of the divine government and work against\n\n18\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\ntheir will in weaving a woof which God sees, stimulate history and procure the advancement of His work. Their empire defines precisely the extent of our bankruptcy. Joseph de Maistre considered that the French Revolu¬ tion was of Satanic origin. He was too profound a philoso¬ pher to draw the conclusion that one should strive purely and simply to erase the French Revolution from the great book of history. That were folly indeed! That book is written under God’s will, and by His leave Satan may hold the pen: it is then an act of cowardice not to see and not to call by its name the evil which is done forever; but it is an act of stupidity not to realise also that the line of being continues amid all possible deviations, that the divine text may still be read by the angels, that some good, great or little, has been achieved (however little it be, it does not matter; God has willed it). We know that wheat and cockle grow up together and will be separated only at the last day. We have even been advised not to gather up the cockle lest we root up the wheat also together with it: which shows that the distinction is beyond our capacity; I mean the distinction of the utility value of events or men for the divine barns and in relation to the common good of creation, that is to say, in relation to an ultimate goal beyond our ken. The bishops of the Restoration period thought they were working for the Lord when they sought to prop the altar against a worm-eaten throne; they were unwittingly sowing the seeds of misunderstandings which\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n19\n\ncame near to proving the undoing of Europe. It is another kind of distinction which the mind requires from us, the distinction of the truth or falsity, good or evil value things on this earth have in relation to intemporal laws which are well within our knowledge; and we must make an effort to perceive clearly, from this point of view, the significance of the spiritual dominants of our history. This was not an idle digression. I was saying that the spiritual dominant of modern culture, whatever may be its positive historic vocation, whatever progress may be taking place in it, is, as I have attempted to show, that it is an anthropocentric culture: humanism dissociated from the Incarnation. We are now in a position to dis¬ tinguish three degrees or moments in the conception which modern times have formed and continue to form of cul¬ ture. There is a first moment when civilisation lavishly produces the most magnificent fruits, forgetful of the roots from which the sap ascends, and it is thought that it must establish by the sole virtue of reason a certain human order, still conceived according to the Christian pattern inherited from preceding ages, a pattern which becomes a constraint and begins to be spoiled. That moment may be described as the classical moment of our culture, the moment of Christian naturalism. There is a second moment when it is perceived that a culture which keeps itself dissociated from the supreme\n\n20\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nsupernatural standards must necessarily take sides against them: it is then required to establish an order which shall be considered to be based upon nature, and is expected to emancipate man and guarantee the spirit of riches undis¬ turbed possession of the earth; that is the moment of rationalist optimism, the bourgeois moment of our culture. We are just about to emerge from it. A third moment is the moment of materialist pessimism, the revolutionary moment, when man, irrevocably considering himself to be his own last end and unable any longer to endure the machinery of this world, engages, as we see in Russia at the present day, in a deliberate battle against natural law and its Author and undertakes to produce out of a radical atheism an entirely new humanity. These three moments are related in continuity in spite of strong secondary oppositions; making a violent schematisation of things, we may say that they have succeeded one another chron¬ ologically; but they are also co-existent, mingled with one another in varying degrees. All these conceptions mis¬ understand human nature and ultimately conduce to claim¬ ing for human nature the conditions of pure spirit, yet in the flesh itself and by the exasperation of an absolutely material power. It is a fictitious emancipation, the waste and dispersal of the human substance in the endless mul¬ tiplication of needs and sadness; the control of procreation not by chastity, but by doing violence to natural finalities; the control of the race by the eugenic sterilisation of de-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n21\n\nfectives;1 the control of the self by the abolition of family ties and unconcern for descendants; the control of life by liberty to commit suicide and euthanasia. It is remarkable that a certain conception of the control of nature by man is compensated in the balance sheet, with startling uni¬ formity, by one same single consequence: the cessation of life. To such a conception of culture the Christian conception is opposed as a truly human and humanist conception, and, in using the word humanist, I have in mind the only humanism which does not belie its etymology, the human¬ ism of which a Thomas Aquinas gives us the example: humanism purified by the blood of Christ, the humanism of the Incarnation. Such a humanism, respecting essential hierarchies, sets the contemplative above the active life; it knows that the contemplative life tends more directly to the love of the first Principle in which perfection consists. It is not a ques¬ tion of sacrificing the active life, but of making it tend to the type it realises in the perfect, that is to say, to an activity all overflowing from the superabundance of con¬ templation. 1 This matter deserves a special study to itself. The least to be said is that such legislation puts into the hands of men and of the State a weapon of terrible danger. It remains that this method of assuring the mastery of man over Nature is, like the others, of an entirely negative kind and shows, as they do, a general tendency in the direction of death. The recent Encyclical Casti Connutti gives the reason for these being condemnable in themselves.\n\n22\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER But if the contemplation of the saints be placed upon\n\nthe summit of human life, must it not then be said that all the activities of man, and civilisation itself, are ordered thereto as to their end? It would appear to be so, says St. Thomas Aquinas (with a note of irony, perhaps). For what is the object of servile work and trade unless to pro¬ vide the body with the necessaries of life so that it may be in a fit state for contemplation? What end do the moral virtues and prudence serve, if not to appease the turbulence of the passions and secure the interior tran¬ quillity which contemplation needs? What end does the whole government of civil life serve but to assure the exterior tranquillity necessary to contemplation? \"So that, properly considered, all the activities of human life seem to be in the service of such as contemplate the truth.”\n\n1\n\nThere is an idea of the hierarchy of values far different from the industrialist conception, wholly concentrated on production, which the modern world forms of civilisation. We see to what an extent the supremacy of the economic, itself derived from a system based on the fecundity of money—a fecundity which, like everything that trans¬ gresses the conditions laid down by nature, knows no limits —to what an extent the materialist or capitalist or Marxian conception of culture is at variance with the mind of the common Doctor of the Church. Are we then to understand that the relation between 1 Sum. contra Gentiles., iii. 37.\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n23\n\nthe Christian conception of culture and the contemporary world is merely one of incompatibility, and that the only ideal the Christian conception has to set before us is the outworn ideal, now definitely engulfed in history, of medi¬ aeval times? How often must I repeat that I am well aware that the course of time is irreversible? Christian wis¬ dom does not suggest that we return to the Middle Ages: it would have us move further forward.\n\nBesides, the\n\ncivilisation of the Middle Ages, however magnificent and splendid it may have been, more splendid still, no doubt, in the refined memories of history than in the reality of experience, was very far removed from the full realisation of the Christian idea of civilisation. The Christian idea is opposed to the modern world, I agree, to the extent that the modern world is inhuman. But to the extent that the modern world, in spite of all its defects in quality, involves a real growth of history, no, the Christian conception of culture is not opposed to it. Rather the reverse: it would endeavour to preserve in the modern world and bring back to the order of the spirit all the riches of life the modern world contains. The anguish, the great anguish, which rends the modern world, whence does it proceed if not from all the inhu¬ manity it involves? That is to say that it aspires unwit¬ tingly to a civilisation of a Christian type, a civilisation like that of which the principles of St. Thomas give us an idea.\n\n24\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER I cannot refrain from indicting in the present contro¬\n\nversy one genius at all events among the many responsible for the evils which afflict us: need I mention the name of my dear enemy, Rene Descartes? It would be interesting to point out the repercussions on culture—in the context I mean politics and economics in the first place—of Car¬ tesian dualism. Descartes, as everybody knows, conceived the human being as a composite of two substances, each complete in itself: pure spirit and geometrical extension. An angel driving a machine. Transpose such a conception into the order of political and economic relations. Such a transposition, I hasten to say, was never made by Descartes himself; but I blame the Cartesian spirit. We shall then have the conception of a political and economic machinery similar to the machine of the body in the Cartesian philosophy and governed solely by natu¬ ral laws of the same sort as the laws governing mechanics and chemistry. To this machinery, existing with a value of its own and with its peculiar and purely material, inhuman requirements, you may, if you are an idealist and have a regard for moral values, add a moral superstructure, the requirements of justice and virtue, which will there take the place of the spiritual soul in the Cartesian machine. If you are inclined to realism or cynicism, you will con¬ sider such a superstructure as a perfectly useless epiphenomenon, just as La Mettrie, in the eighteenth century,\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n25\n\nconsidered the Cartesian soul to be useless and invented the theory of the Man-Machine, as Descartes had invented the theory of the animal-machine. Be that as it may, what is important is that in such a conception politics and economics have each their own peculiar and specific ends, which are not human ends, but purely material ends. The end of politics is the material prosperity, the power and success of the State, and every¬ thing that may procure such an end—even an act of treach¬ ery or an act of injustice—is politically good. The end of economics is the acquisition and limitless increase of riches, material riches as such. And everything that may procure such an end—even an act of injustice, even oppressive and inhuman conditions of life—is economically good. Justice, friendship, and every truly human value thenceforth be¬ come alien to the structure of political and economic life as such, and if morality intervenes with its peculiar exi¬ gencies, it will be to engage in conflict with political and economic reality, with political and economic science. A homo ceconomicus will be invented whose sole function is to accumulate material goods. If you attempt to duplicate him with a man subject to the control of morality, a truly human man, the duplication will be ineffective; the eco¬ nomic man, whose appetite is insatiable, will in reality eat up the moral duplication and everything else and exert himself to pound, like an ogreish machine, the wretched true humanity toiling in the basements of history.\n\n26\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER This kind of political and economic physicism has really\n\npoisoned modern culture. In opposition to it the traditions of the philosophia perennis may once more teach us a spe¬ cifically human conception. Such a conception—it is cer♦\n\ntainly not the invention of St. Thomas; all the superior minds of antiquity, even pagan antiquity, shared it, but St. Thomas, following Aristotle, clearly formulated the prin¬ ciples of it—considers politics and economics not as physi¬ cal sciences, but as branches of ethics, the science of human actions. However immense the part played therein by con¬ ditions determined by the nature of material things and their automatic action, such a science is, nevertheless, de¬ fined by reference to the use which our freedom makes and ought to make of such conditions. Its end is the upright life, the good human life on this earth: a system of life worthy of man and of what is of most importance in man, that is to say, the spirit. Political and economic laws are not purely physical laws, like the laws of mechanics or chemistry, they are laws of human action, investing in themselves moral values. Justice, humanity, unswerving love of one’s neighbour, are essentially part of the very structure of politics and economics. An act of treachery is not merely a thing forbidden by individual morality, but a thing politically bad, tending to ruin the political health of the social body. Oppression of the poor and the acquisi¬ tion of riches, considered as an end in itself, are not merely things forbidden by individual morality, but things eco-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n27\n\nnomically bad, tending to thwart the very end of econom¬ ics, because the end of economics is a human end. St. Thomas teaches that to lead a moral life, to develop in the life of the virtues, man needs a certain minimum of comfort and material security. Such a doctrine signifies that extreme poverty is socially, as Leon Bloy and Peguy so clearly perceived, a kind of Hell; it also signifies that social conditions which expose the majority of men to the close risk of committing sin, by requiring a kind of hero¬ ism from those who desire to fulfil the law of God, are conditions which it is a duty in strict justice unceasingly to denounce and to strive to change. The world at the moment seems to be in the grip of two opposite forms of barbarism. I have not the least idea whether it will escape. In any event it must not be for¬ gotten that if the Christian conception has not been the spiritual dominant of civilisation for some centuries past, it has still remained alive, damned up, not abolished. That such a conception may succeed in dominating culture is still a possibility to-day: whether such a possibility will be realised or not is God’s secret. We must therefore work with our whole hearts to bring such a realisation about, no longer, certainly, according to the ideal of the Holy Roman Empire but according to a new ideal, a much less unitary ideal, in which an entirely moral and spiritual activity of the Church shall preside over the temporal order of a multitude of politically and culturally heterogeneous\n\n28\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nnations, whose religious differences are still not likely soon to disappear. If facts are fated to fall short of such an expectation, if the work of Christendom must hence¬ forth develop in the bosom of what Scripture calls the mystery of iniquity, as that mystery formerly developed in the bosom of the work of Christendom, we may, at any rate, indulge the hope that, in the new world, an authentical Christian culture will arise, \"a culture no longer gathered and assembled, as in the Middle Ages, in a homo¬ geneous body of civilisation occupying a tiny privileged portion of the inhabited earth, but scattered over the whole surface of the globe—a living network of hearths of the Christian life disseminated among the nations within the great supra-cultural unity of the Church. Instead of a fortress towering amidst the lands, let us think rather of the host of stars strewn across the sky.”\n\n1\n\nThe foregoing observations make it clearly apparent what a prime, fundamental necessity it is to the life of the world that Catholicism penetrate to the very depths of, and vivify, culture, and that Catholics form sound cul¬ tural, philosophical, historical, social, political, economic and artistic conceptions, and endeavour to transmit them into the reality of history. The supreme detachment which is the boast of the separated churches of the East, the refusal to lend a help1 Cf. my St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n29\n\ning hand to the sorry labours of this earth, the all too human vertigo of spiritual humility and liberty which im¬ pelled Dostoievski to revolt against the wisdom of Rome, dissemble an abandonment of the vocation imposed upon baptised souls by the supreme laws of the redeeming In¬ carnation. They go down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho with their eyes raised to Heaven and weep for compassion over wounded nature; they dare not lay the unctions of justice on its ailing body; they have such *\n\nregard for its infirmity that they consider the attempt to cure it by endeavouring to subject terrestrial and social things to the order of the Gospel and of reason as a seduction of the spirit of the world. As far as we Catholics are concerned, it is incumbent on us to recover much time lamentably lost. How many things would be different if, some sixty years ago,1 it had been a disciple of St. Thomas who had written a book on Capital as decisive as that of Marx, but based on true principles! Our principles, alas! are asleep and error is ever on the watch, active and enterprising. I have referred elsewhere to the terrifying lack of attention shown by the Catholic world to the warnings issued by Leo XIII with reference to social affairs. On the whole, and in spite of the effort of a few, who kept honour safe, the bankruptcy of this world in the last century in face of problems 1 The first volume of Das Kapital appeared, as is well known, in 1867; the other two volumes were published, after the death of Karl Marx (1883), in 1885 and 1894 respectively.\n\n30\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\ndirectly involving the dignity of human personality and Christian justice is one of the most distressing phenomena of modern history. That the religion of Christ should penetrate culture to its very depths is not required merely from the point of view of the salvation of souls and in relation to their last end: in this respect a Christian civilisation appears as something truly maternal and sanctified, procuring the terrestrial good and the development of the various natu¬ ral activities by sedulous attention to the imperishable interests and most profound aspirations of the human heart. It ought from the point of view also of the specific ends of civilisation itself to be Christian.\n\nFor human\n\nreason, considered without any relation whatever to God, is insufficient by its unaided natural resources to procure the good of men and nations.1 As a matter of fact, and in the conditions governing life at present, it is not pos¬ sible for man to expand his nature in a fundamentally and permanently upright manner unless under the sky of grace. Left to himself, he cannot but fail to achieve the difficult harmonies of the virtues, the difficult rational regulations, the pure consonances of justice and friendship without which culture deviates from its most exalted ends.\n\nSt.\n\nAugustine’s words with reference to the State apply 1 Cf. The Syllabus of Pius IX. in Denzinger-Bannwart’s Enchiridion Symbolorum, 16th and 17th Ed., Fribourg.-im.-B., 1928, p. 466, 1703. [The text of the condemned proposition is as follows: \"The human rea¬ son, without regard to God, is the sole arbiter of truth and falsehood, good and evil; it is a law unto itself and sufficient by its natural resources to procure the good of men and nations.”}\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n31\n\nequally to civilisation: \"The State does not derive its felicity from another source than man, for the State is merely a multitude of men living in harmony.”\n\n2\n\nAnd one\n\nName only has been given to men in which they may be saved. However great civilisations may be which ignore that Name, they inevitably decline, in one respect or an¬ other, from the complete notion of civilisation and cul¬ ture; order and liberty become equally cruel therein. Even an authentically Christian civilisation does not escape many accidental blemishes. Only a Christian civilisation can be exempt from essential deviations. The relations between culture and the Catholic religion involve, however, as I have said, yet another aspect. If Catholicism is to penetrate culture for the good of the world and the salvation of souls, it is not so that it shall be itself bound to one culture or another, or even to cul¬ ture in general and its various forms, otherwise than as a transcendent and independent and vivifying force—rather in the manner (but no comparison is adequate) of a spiritual soul subsisting apart, like the \"separate intellect” of the Averroists, and imparting its own life to various living things. It forms civilisation, it is not formed by it. It feeds on the fruits of the earth, because it dwells on the earth, but it is not of the earth, and it has an essential food which is not a fruit of the earth. All the elements it borrows from human civilisations, the languages of its liturgies, the languages of its preaching, the architecture 3 Ep. ad. Macedon., c. III.\n\n32\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nis\n\nand ornamentation of its shrines, the common or precious things assumed by its religious worship, the human wis¬ dom assumed by its theology, the flower of the liberal arts and human poetry assumed by the very sanctity of a Ger¬ trude or a John of the Cross, are each and every one adopted out of compassion, the same compassion which decreed the Incarnation.\n\nJesus ate and drank in the\n\nhouses of His friends in Bethania; He was received in Bethania: but it was Bethania which received from Jesus. The Roman peace and Roman order were not a condition imposed from below on the divine Incarnation and the propagation of the Church, but a means chosen from above, freely chosen. Not in itself necessary or indis¬ pensable, but, rather, on the contrary, deriving its merits only from that free choice. And the Church is indebted to it in the first place for the persecutions and the martyrs. And when that order believed itself to be indispensable to the world, it was shattered. I have already observed but it is proper to insist upon it: \"All religions other than the Catholic religion are in more or less narrow and servile fashion, according as their metaphysical level is more or less elevated, integral parts of certain definite cultures, particularised to certain ethnic climates and certain historical formations. The Catholic religion alone is absolutely and strictly transcendental, supra-cultural, supra-racial and supra-national—because it is supernatural. . . .\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n33\n\n’'This is one sign of its divine origin. It is also one of the signs of contradiction which until the end of time will be a cause of the passion of the Church, raised like her Master between earth and sky. It is conceivable from this point of view that the world is entering a phase of par¬ ticularly stern conflicts which may perhaps be compared to the conflicts of apostolic times in the Rome of the Caesars. On the one hand the non-Christian nations are incapable of distinguishing between their autochthonous culture, with all its human values in themselves deserving of respect and filial piety, and the errors and superstitions of their religions. And Christian universalism will have to show them how such a distinction can be made and how the Gospel respects and superelevates, and by slow degrees transforms, such particular values. The demonstration is, as a rule, not unattended with bloodshed. And the im¬ becile dogma of positivist sociology, taught in all coun¬ tries in the name of European science, and according to which every religion is merely the specific product of the social clan (and Christianity therefore a specific product of the European races), will not make it any the easier. \"On the other hand, when faith and charity diminish among the majority in the Christian nations, many come to think that, because Christianity was the vivifying prin¬ ciple of their historic culture it is essentially bound, enfeoffed to it. Certain apostles of Latinity (I bear it no grudge, let me assure them) are convinced—the remark\n\n34\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nwas made to me one day—that ouy religion is a GreecoLatin religion. Such an enormity is full of significance. Not realising from what spirit they derive, and oblivious of the divine transcendence of what constitutes the life of their life, they end in practice by worshipping the true God in the same fashion as the Ephesians worshipped Diana and primitive man worshipped the idols of his tribe. Christian universalism will have to remind them that the Gospel and the Church, without injuring any par¬ ticular culture or the State or the nation, yet dominate them all in a pure unsullied independence and subordinate them to the eternal interests of the human being, to the law of God and the charity of Christ. Nor is that demon¬ stration made without opposition.”\n\n1\n\nThe Church knows that no civilisation, no nation, has clean hands: omnes quidem peccaverunt et egent gloria Dei. But she also knows that all the civilisations and cul¬ tures on earth, though born far away from her and in spiritual climates overcast by error, whatever erroneous forms they may involve, endure only in virtue of the good which they contain and are pregnant with human and divine truths, and that the common Providence of God watches over all nations. That is the reason why grace can maintain them all in their particular types, correcting and superelevating each. 1 St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nIll PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Certain\n\npractical consequences affecting our conduct\n\nemerge from these considerations. Culture or civilisation, as I observed in the beginning of this essay, is rooted in the soil of natural life, whereas the Church has her roots in the sky of the supernatural life. But a Christian civilisa¬ tion, even supernaturally superelevated in its order by the Christian virtues and its subordination to the last super¬ natural end, is still something temporal, essentially terres¬ trial and therefore deficient, continues to belong to the sphere of nature. We must therefore be careful not only not to confuse the Church with any civilisation whatso¬ ever, but we should also be careful not to confuse the Church in any particular whatsoever with Christian civil¬ isation or the Christian world, Catholicism with the Cath¬ olic world. The Church and Catholicism are essentially supernatural, supra-cultural things whose end is eternal life. Christian civilisation and the Catholic cultural world remain a civilisation and a world whose specific end, al¬ though ordered to eternal life, is in itself of the temporal order. 35\n\n36\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER The Church, the mystical Body of Christ—a super¬\n\nnatural society—has a bond, a supernatural social spirit, which is the Holy Ghost. By a natural, too natural phenomenon, a return of the natural social spirit, let me say, if you like, in memory of Durkheim, a return of spontaneous sociologism, may come and sponge upon our consciousness to the extent that we conceive ourselves, in the Catholic community, as in a natural or temporal community—to the point of identify¬ ing the interests of Catholicism itself, the cause of the heavenly Father, with \"our cause\" and the interests of our human group of a Catholic denomination. So far as we do so, we allow our religion to sink, in practice, into naturalism, for the Holy Ghost is not the spirit of any clan or party. And, so far as we do so, we run the risk of shutting the gates of the Kingdom of God against souls and, because of our pride and our own miserable defi¬ ciency, making the nations blaspheme the name of the true God. It is immediately apparent how such an error, which consists after all in considering Catholicism as though it were itself a terrestrial state or a terrestrial civilisation, and therefore requiring for it and divine truth the same sort of triumphs as for a State or civilisation on earth, is a kind of imperialism in spiritualibus and so related to the error we referred to above, which consists in enfeoffing Catholi¬ cism to a terrestrial civilisation and is a kind of national\n\n¬\n\nism in spiritualibus. These two errors derive from one\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n37\n\nsame source, and I am inclined to believe that they have weighed very heavily upon the history of Christian nations and that it has become a pressing necessity to denounce both alike. Each is a blind delusion under the new law like the blind delusion of the carnal Jews under the old law. Such delusions are expensive. Catholics are not Catholicism. The errors, apathies, shortcomings and slumbers of Catholics do not involve Catholicism. Catholicism is not obliged to provide an alibi for the failures of Catholics. The best apologetic does not consist in justifying Catholics or making excuses for them when they are in the wrong, but on the contrary in emphasising their errors and pointing out that, far from affecting the substance of Catholicism, they serve only the better to display the virtue of a religion which is still a living force in spite of them. The Church is a mys¬ tery, her head is hidden in the sky, her visibility does not adequately manifest her nature; if you seek to know what represents, without betraying, her, consider the Pope and the episcopate teaching the faith and morals, consider the saints in Heaven and on earth, avert your eyes from us poor sinners. Or, rather, consider how the Church heals our wounds and leads us hobbling to eternal life. Leibniz pretended to justify God by showing that the work which proceeded from the hands of that perfect Workman was itself perfect, whereas in reality it is the radical imper¬ fection of every creature which best attests the glory of\n\n38\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nthe Uncreated. The great glory of the Church is to be holy with sinful members. It would be impossible to be too careful and tactful in paying practical homage to such truths. It is proper to admire so many Catholic newspapers, Catholic cinemas, Catholic novels which profess with candour and undeni¬ able good-will to be the recognised purveyors of good. Is it not the professed object of every Catholic magazine, especially if it is a young people’s paper, to be the organ of the Catholic revival, or if it is a review of doctrine, eager also to inform opinion, to give a complete idea of contemporary Catholic thought and Catholic activity? That will be apparent when the world comes to an end, and the subscribers run the risk of being somewhat startled. We should also admire so many Catholic men of letters who are convinced that their works constitute Catholic literature, one might as well say God’s literature. Far be it from me to suggest that the operation of grace is incapable of being treated as a theme for fiction or romance; grace is more intimately associated with human life than life itself, and it is impossible for a novelist to consider it as non-existent. What is requisite, however, is that his work shall not diminish the operation of grace, shall respect its transcendence, the profound secret which is characteristic of the divine mysteries. It ill becomes us to judge the divine ways by our standards, even for the purpose of jus-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n39\n\ntifying them after the fashion of Leibniz, Malebranche, and the friends of Job, or of certain works of the imagina¬ tion which seem to plead the cause of God, as though God needed to be acquitted. His works bear their own justifica¬ tion, are justificata in semetipsa; the novel which He has been writing since the world began is terribly free of every apologetic contrivance and every prejudice of spiritual politics. He wrote the Bible as He governs the universe, Himself giving us in those two works the supreme exem¬ plar of all inspired creation. The truth is, a Catholic writer is tortured and terrified by the thought that Catholicism may, perhaps, be judged by the standard of his own insufficiency. He would rather be taken for a Mahommedan and, as such, pay a tribute of homage to truth and the Church which would run no risk of compromising either.\n\nFortunately, his fellow\n\nwriters are on the alert and take it upon themselves to secure as far as he is concerned an almost equivalent result. To speak of more momentous matters. The result of such a temporalisation of religion as that to which I re¬ ferred a moment ago is mendaciously to transform Catholi¬ cism in the minds of those affected by it into a party and Catholics into partisans. Such a transformation appears with most manifest characteristics in the state of mind of anti-Semites, who proclaim the Gospel by a series of pogroms, and people who attribute all the worries of life\n\n40\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nto a permanent world-wide conspiracy of the wicked against the good. Another indication of it is to be found in those who seem to consider the conversion of souls as in the first place bringing a strategic reinforcement to an army or as a series of successes to be entered in a scorebook. A conversion, however, is not a political or military operation. Operations of that sort, if they lose the ground at first won, are operations which have failed. But the return of a soul to God, even if it should afterwards not visibly persevere, is an event inscribed in Heaven, a testi¬ mony valid by itself, a promise whose ultimate fulfilment is beyond our ken. Catholicism is not a religious party; it is religion, the only true religion, and it rejoices, with¬ out envy, in every good, even though it be achieved outside its boundaries—for that good is only apparently outside the boundaries of Catholicism, in reality it belongs to it invisibly. Are not all things, indeed, ours, we who are Christ’s? The expansion of the Kingdom of God has no common standard with any temporal conquest or any temporal victory. If the dragoons of Louis XIV harass and martyrise the Huguenots, nothing is thereby gained for the Kingdom of God. If, in a country oppressed by schismatics, the Catholics gain the upper hand and plunder the schismatics as the schismatics plundered the Catholics, nothing is gained for the Kingdom of God. If the integrity of doctrine or virtue serves only to cement the pride of a faction or a caste, if the object of a certain beneficence is\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n41\n\nrather to recruit adherents than to serve poverty, nothing is gained for the Kingdom of God. An entirely different course of action has been enjoined upon us and the Church herself acts differently. The only proper attitude to adopt in regard to souls is one of service. The example was given once and for all time. As far as non-Christian cultures and civilisations are concerned, those of us who are engaged in studying them find our¬ selves faced with a delicate problem. We have been con¬ tent only too often merely to depreciate them; com¬ plaisance is no better, it is truth which is necessary, but with love to vivify knowledge. Our ardent desire should be not to destroy such cultures, but to serve them loyally; I mean to say, to help them rediscover whatever authentic elements they may contain of everything that is venerable, wise and true, to purge themselves of their impurities, to disencumber the toothing which invites the building on of more exalted truths. If we do so, they will make ready to receive at the appointed time the visit of the Son of Man. The peculiarly Catholic task is to foster and stimu¬ late the truth everywhere. The controversy with which we are now concerned is the controversy between what Peguy called mysticism and politics—let us say, in a more precise terminology, between the spiritual and the temporal. As an illustration of this controversy and of what we have said of the transcendence\n\n42\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nof the spiritual, consider for a moment the story of the Invincible Armada. A most Catholic King, all Spain in prayer, the defence and promotion of God’s cause in the world, the extirpation of heresy in a hotbed: was not another Lepanto a certainty? A puff of wind upon the water and the entire fleet was at the bottom. God took it upon Himself to give the answer. If we believe as we are bound to in the divine government, we must conclude that God, Who in the conduct of history sets before Himself in the first place His Kingdom and His Saints, in this instance most strikingly dissevered the interests of His glory and the interests of the banners which thought to serve it. The merits of the martyrs of Tyburn—and future recoveries of which we have no idea—were doubtless more important to the divine plans than the triumph of the Catholic King. Philip II, the artificial and tormented replica of St. Louis, looks like one of those giant saurians in which some palaeozoic phylum finally exhausted itself. All his work seems to me to have a definitely characteristic significance. It puts before our eyes, carried to the extreme at which virtue becomes vice and to a degree of austerity and extravagance which the Middle Ages for all their ex¬ cesses never erected into a system, the mediaeval conception of the temporal as the instrument of the spiritual—but the instrument in this case was so welded to the hand that the hand lost its freedom; is it any wonder that it came to disaster?\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n43\n\nThe true and living Middle Ages find their most authen¬ tic representative in St. Louis. In him the temporal is truly, with all the dignity and humility which such a title in¬ volves—supple, free, really ordered and subordinate—the means of incarnation of the spiritual. We have the prob¬ lem of Christian royalty then rising before us in all its dimensions and proper proportions; and the problem of Christian royalty, considered in the most eminent and purest particular case, is the common problem of Christian temporal activity, as it presents itself to each one of us who strive to be faithful while working in the profane world. Considered from the point of view of worldly suc¬ cesses, such work is rather a thankless task. It is the case of a lamb trying to impress its views on wolves. Let us not forget that St. Louis was not a great conquerer, that he failed in his crusades, that he was defeated—but yet not in the same way as Philip II! His repulses, no less than his victories, merely extended still further his power and influence. Because the virtue of the energies of the spirit was really transmitted into the instrument wielded by that king. The temporal then participated in a way in the law of the spiritual, entered into the calculations of that divine arithmetic in which everything is done contrary to common sense, in which the first are the last and the labourers who have done nothing during eleven hours out of twelve receive the same wages as those who have toiled all day. Here we may usefully find room for a scholastic dis-\n\n44\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\ntinction. There are two functions to be considered in an instrument, its own peculiar causality and its instrumental causality. In the case of the temporal the very subtle rela¬ tion between these two functions imposes a varying degree upon the endless intertwinements of gains and losses. In the peculiar order of the temporal, so far as the temporal is worth anything by itself, while being ordered to more exalted ends to the extent that it has its own peculiar goods to safeguard, its peculiar virtue to exercise, what counts for the decisive issue is victory or defeat. In this case we ought—yet without ever exalting it above the law of God—terribly to wish for victory; it has a biological importance: as well die as fail to gain it. So far as the temporal acts precisely as the instrument of the spiritual and is useful to the peculiar order of the spiritual, what counts for the decisive issue is not victory in the battle, but the way in which the battle is fought and the weapons employed. Weapons of light! Of truth, loyalty, justice, innocence, let our weapons be unsullied! We shall be beaten, that goes without saying, historians and politicians are right in warning us.\n\nBut it is impossible to be\n\nbeaten; when the stake is not biological but spiritual, defeat or victory with unsullied weapons is always a victory. It is not enough to realise that the things of time must be, on the double ground just mentioned, the means of the intemporal—not a temporal means imposing on the in-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n45\n\ntemporal, to ensure its success on this earth, the law of the flesh and sin, for that would be an outrageous prevarica¬ tion, but a temporal means itself subject to the supreme law of the spirit. It must also be realised that there are an order and hierarchy of such temporal means, I mean, of temporal means good in themselves, legitimate and nor¬ mal. There is the labour of the soldier and the labour of the ploughman, the labour of the politician, the poet, the philosopher, there are the works of us Christians of the common herd, the works of the saints; there are the works of saints with a mission to discharge, such as the duty of State imposed upon St. Louis or the temporal mission of Joan of Arc, and the works of saints exempt from any such mission. Well, then, the richer such works and temporal means are in matter, the more they have their own peculiar exigencies, their own peculiar conditions, the more heavily weighted they are. The more also, in accordance with the law just mentioned, do they regularly postulate a certain degree of temporal success. \"Whoso loses his soul for my sake,” our Lord said, \"shall find it again.” He did not say: \"Whoso loses his kingdom shall save it.” St. Louis was an excellent administrator of his kingdom; he increased its power and prosperity. Controlled by the strong hand of the eternal decrees, the Roman soldier was bound to sub¬ ject the world to his arms and so unconsciously prepared the arena in which the Church had to fight her first battles.\n\n46\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nEver so much more profoundly, what a weight of glory for the temporal was the history of the patriarchs and the long carnal preparation for the Incarnation! A work of time, but of eternal importance, in the least mesh of which God took a personal interest, the paradigm of the natural sanctity, if I may say so, of every successful and well-made work. We may describe as rich temporal means those which, so implicated in the density of matter, of their own nature postulate a certain degree of tangible success. By that very fact the evangelical law of the reversal of values and im¬ molation, which is the supreme law of the spiritual, affects them only imperfectly, and it is the shadow of the Cross which passes over them. Such means are the peculiar means of the world; the spirit, as it were, ravishes them, they do not belong to the spirit; in truth, and in fact, ever since the sin of Adam, they fall within the dominion of the Prince of this world. Our duty is to wrest them from him by the virtue of the blood of Christ. It would be absurd to despise or reject them: they are necessary, part of the natural stuff of life. Religion must consent to re¬ ceive their assistance. But it is proper for the health of the world that the hierarchy of means be safeguarded and their proper relative proportions. And there are other temporal means, which are the peculiar means of the spirit. They are poor temporal means. The Cross is in them. The less burdened they are\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n47\n\nby matter, the more destitute, the less visible—the more efficacious they are. Because they are pure means for the virtue of the spirit. They are the peculiar means of wis¬ dom, for wisdom is not dumb, it cries in the market-place, it is the peculiarity of wisdom so to cry, it must therefore have means of making itself heard. The mistake is to think that the best means for wisdom will be the most powerful means, the most voluminous. The pure essence of the spiritual is to be found in wholly immanent activity, is contemplation, whose pecu¬ liar efficacy disturbs no single atom on earth in order to touch the heart of God. The closer one gets to the pure essence of the spiritual, the more spontaneously tapering become the temporal means employed in its service. That is the condition of their efficacy.\n\nToo tenuous to be\n\nstopped by any obstacle, they pierce where the most power¬ ful equipments are powerless to pierce. Propter suam munditiam. Because of their purity they traverse the world\n\nfrom end to end.\n\nNot being ordered for tangible success,\n\ninvolving in their essence no internal exigency of temporal success, they participate, for the spiritual results to be secured, in the efficacy of the spirit. When Rembrandt painted, when Mozart and Satie com¬ posed their works, when St. Thomas wrote his Summa and Dante his Divina Commedia, when the author of the Imitation wrote his book and St. Paul his epistles, when\n\nPlato and Aristotle spoke to their disciples, when Homer\n\n48\n\nESSAYS IN ORDER\n\nsang, when David sang, when the prophets prophesied, these were all poor temporal means. In the last resort, let us consider the spiritual man par excellence. What were the temporal means of Wisdom in¬\n\ncarnate? He preached in villages. He wrote no books— that again was a means of action too heavily weighted with matter—He founded no newspapers or reviews. His sole weapon was the poverty of preaching. He prepared no speeches, gave no addresses; He opened his lips and the clamour of wisdom, the freshness of Heaven, passed over men’s hearts. What liberty! If He had wanted to convert the world by the great means of power, by rich temporal means, by American methods, what could have been\n\neasier? Did not somebody offer Him all the kingdoms of the earth? Hczc omnia tibi dabo. What an opportunity for an apostolate! The like will never be seen again. He refused it. The world is perishing of dead weight. It will recover its youth only through poverty of the spirit. To seek to save the things of the spirit by going in the first place to try and discover, in order to serve it, the most powerful means in the order of matter, is an illusion which is all too common. You might as well tie the wings of a dove to a steam-hammer. In the last resort, it is the great modern Minotaur himself, all the gear and strategy of big finan¬ cial business, which will be entrusted with the task of sav¬ ing souls; banks will be founded and world-wide trust corporations organised for the worldly success of the Gos-\n\nRELIGION AND CULTURE\n\n49\n\npel with founders’ shares. It would be hypocrisy to deny that the work of evangelisation and every spiritual under¬ taking need money, as a man needs food. Much money is required for missions, schools and charitable enterprises. But money may be used as a poor temporal means (it is then spent in order to procure things) or as a rich tempo¬ ral means (it is then used to invent machinery for acquir¬ ing more money). With the divine sans-gene of sanctity, the Blessed Cottolengo and his fellows testify to the face of the modern world to what an extent money, even though it pour in in abundance, can yet remain a means of poverty. What makes the modern world so terribly tempt¬ ing is that it puts forward, it vulgarises so, rich temporal means which are so crushing and oppressive; it uses them with such ostentation and such power as to induce the belief that they are the principal means. They are a prin¬ cipal means for matter, not a principal means for the spirit. When David resolved to face Goliath, he first tried on the armour of King Saul. It was too heavy for him; He preferred a poor weapon. David was the spirit. Poor Saul, a pitiable figure of the temporal power royally equipped to serve the divine order and fight the Devil! And when David became king, he in his turn sinned. David, how¬ ever, repented. \"Jesus therefore when he knew that they would come to take him by force and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.” 1\n\nSt. John vi. 15.\n\n1\n\nIV OF CATHOLIC THOUGHT AND ITS MISSION The intellectual task confronting the Catholic is a diffi¬\n\ncult task, as difficult as it is important. As a man, he is in time, and subject to all the vicissitudes of becoming; as a member of the mystical Body of Christ, he is joined to eternity; his most fundamental life has its roots where there is no change nor shadow of alteration, his mind is fixed in primal Truth, loyalty to which is the foundation of the whole edifice of grace in him and the primary bene¬ fit which every creature expects from him. This sort of mediation between time and the eternal is for the Christian mind at once a sort of painful cross and a sort of redemp¬ tive mission. It must at every moment think the pa"
