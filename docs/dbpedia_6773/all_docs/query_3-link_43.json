        "text": "What first impresses us in Luther’s character is egocentrism: something much subtler, much deeper, and much more serious, than egoism; a metaphysical egoism. Luther’s self becomes practically the centre of gravity of everything, especially in the spiritual order. And Luther’s self is not only his passing quarrels and passions, it has a representative value; it is the self of the created being, the incommunicable stuff of the human individual. The Reformation unbridled the human self in the spiritual and religious order, as the Renaissance (I mean the hidden spirit of the Renaissance) unbridled the human self in the order of natural and sensible activities.\n\nAfter Luther decided to refuse obedience to the Pope and break with the communion of the Church, his self is henceforth supreme, despite his interior agonies which increased until the end. Every “external” rule, every “heteronomy”, as Kant said, becomes then an intolerable insult to his “Christian liberty”.\n\n“I do not admit”, he writes in June 1522, “that my doctrine can be judged by anyone, even by the angels. He who does not receive my doctrine cannot be saved.”[1] “Luther’s self,” wrote Moehler, “was in his opinion the centre round which all humanity should gravitate; he made himself the universal man in whom all should find their model. Let us make no bones about it, he put himself in the place of Jesus Christ.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs we have already noticed, Luther’s doctrine is itself only a universalization of his self, a projection of his self into the world of eternal truths. From this point of view, what distinguishes the father of Protestantism from the other great heresiarchs is that they started first from a dogmatic error, from a false doctrinal view; whatever their psychological origins may have been, the cause of their heresies is a deviation of the intelligence, and their own fortunes only count insofar as they conditioned that deviation. It is quite different with Luther. What counts is his life, his history. Doctrine comes as an extra. Lutheranism is not a system worked out by Luther; it is the overflow of Luther’s individuality. It will be the same with Rousseau; the procedure is essentially romantic. It is that which explains the “Reformer’s” immense influence on the German people. That is why a Lutheran like Seeberg cannot contain his admiration of that truly daimonic man, as he calls him, at that colossal figure of the superhuman which it is blasphemous to presume to judge. The question is, whether every flood is beautiful and good of itself, and whether a river deserves our gratitude for simply spreading over the fields.\n\nIf you are looking for the translation of this egocentrism into dogma, you will find it in some of the most noticeable characteristics of the Lutheran theology. What is the Lutheran dogma of the certainty of salvation[2] but the transference to the human individual and his subjective state of that absolute assurance in the divine promises which was formerly the privilege of the Church and her mission?[3] Because God was her centre, the Catholic soul needed to know nothing with perfect certainty except the mysteries of the faith, and that God is love and is merciful. And if He sent her tokens of His love, she used these experimental signs[4] less to probe herself and judge of her state before God than to live the imperfect certainties of hope with greater strength, certainties all the dearer that the conscience dare hardly receive the confession of them. But without perfect certainty of her state of grace the heretical soul could not exist without breaking for agony, because she has become the centre and seeks her salvation in the justice with which she covers herself, not in the abyss of the mercies of Another, who made her.\n\nWhy does the doctrine of salvation absorb all the Lutheran theology, if it be not because the human self has become in actual fact the chief preoccupation of that theology?[5] For Luther, one question towers above all the rest: to escape the judicial wrath of the Almighty in spite of the invincible concupiscence which poisons our nature. The truth is, that if it is essentially important that we should save ourselves, it is less to escape the devil than to see the face of God, and less to save our own being from the fire than for the love of Him Whom we love more than ourselves. “Domine ostende nobis Patrem, et sufficit nobis,” Catholic theology is ordered to God, and it is, by that very fact, a science chiefly speculative.[6] Lutheran theology is for the creature; that is why it aims above all at the practical end to be attained. Luther, who drives charity away and keeps servile fear, though he pretends not to, makes the science of divine things revolve round human corruption.\n\nIs not the salvation of man, however, the work of God and His Christ? Beware: in the Lutheran theology grace is always wholly extrinsic to ourselves,[7] man is walled up in his nature and can never receive in himself the seeds of true participation in the divine life, nor (child of wrath as he is) can he produce a substantially supernatural act. A flavour of the devil mingles with everything he does. “l say that whether it be in man or devil, the spiritual powers have been not only corrupted by sin, but absolutely destroyed; so that there is now nothing in them but a depraved reason and a will that is the enemy and opponent of God, whose only thought is war against God.”[8] “True piety, piety of value in God’s eyes, is found in works which are foreign to us (those of Christ), not in our own.”[9] Can then the act of justifying faith, if it comes from us, come also from God and from Christ acting in us? In fact it is ourselves, and we alone, who catch at Christ’s cloak to “cover all our shame with it,” and use that “skill to leap from our sin on to Christ’s justice, and hence to be as certain of possessing Christ’s piety as we are of having our own bodies.”[10] The Pelagianism of despair! In fine, it is for man himself to work his own redemption by driving himself to à desperate trust in Christ.[11] Human nature will only have to throw off as an empty theological accessory the cloak of a meaningless grace and turn its faith-trust on to itself,[12] and it will become that pleasant liberated beast whose continual and infallible progress delights the universe to- day.\n\nAnd thus in the person of Luther and in his doctrine, we are present – and that on the level of the spirit and religions life – at the Advent of the Self.[13]\n\n* * * * *\n\nBut then, surely Luther’s case shows us precisely one of the problems against which modern man fights in vain. It is the problem of individuality and personality. Look at the Kantian shrivelled up in his autonomy, the Protestant tormented by concern for his inward liberty, the Nietzschean giving himself curvature of the spine in his effort to jump beyond good and evil, the Freudian cultivating his complexes and sublimating his libido, the thinker preparing an unpublished conception of the world for the next philosophical congress, the “surrealist” hero throwing himself into a trance and plunging into the abyss of dreams, the disciple of M. Gide viewing himself with gloomy enthusiasm in the mirror of his freedom: all those unhappy people are looking for their personalities; and, contrary to the Gospel promise, they knock and no man opens to them, they seek and they do not find.\n\nSee with what religious pomp the modern world bas proclaimed the sacred rights of the individual, and what a price it has paid for that proclamation. Yet was there ever a time when the individual was more completely ruled by the great anonymous powers of the State, of Money, of Opinion? What then is the mystery? There is no mystery in it. It is simply that the modern world confounds two things which ancient wisdom had distinguished. It confounds individuality and personality.\n\nWhat does Christian philosophy tell us? It tells us that the person is “a complete individual substance, intellectual in nature and master of its actions,” sui juris, autonomous, in the authentic sense of the word. And so the word person is reserved for substances which possess that divine thing, the spirit, and are in consequence, each by itself, a world above the whole bodily order, a spiritual and moral world, which strictly speaking is not a part of this universe, and whose secret is hidden even from the natural perception of the angels. The word person is reserved for substances which, choosing their end, are capable of themselves deciding on the means and of introducing series of new events into the universe by their liberty; for substances which can say after their kind, fiat, and it is so. And what makes their dignity, what makes their personality, is just exactly the subsistence of the spiritual and immortal soul and its supreme independence in regard to all fleeting imagery and all the machinery of sensible phenomena. And St Thomas teaches that the word person signifies the noblest and highest thing in all nature: “Persona significat id quod est perfectissimum in tota natura.”[14]\n\nThe word individual, on the contrary, is common to man and beast, to plant, microbe, and atom. And, whilst personality rests on the subsistence of the human soul (a subsistence independent of the body and communicated to the body which is sustained in being by the very subsistence of the soul), Thomist philosophy tells us that individuality as such is based on the peculiar needs of matter, the principle of individuation because it is the principle of division, because it requires to occupy a position and have a quantity by which that which is here will differ from what is there. So that in so far as we are individuals we are only a fragment of matter, a part of this universe, distinct, no doubt, but a part, a point of that immense network of forces and influences, physical and cosmic, vegetative and animal, ethnic, atavistic, hereditary, economic and historic, to whose laws we are subject. As individuals, we are subject to the stars. As persons, we rule them.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhat is modern individualism? A misunderstanding, a blunder; the exaltation of individuality camouflaged as personality, and the corresponding degradation of true personality.\n\nIn the social order, the modern city sacrifices the person to the individual; it gives universal suffrage, equal rights, liberty of opinion, to the individual, and delivers the person, isolated, naked, with no social framework to support and protect it, to all the devouring powers which threaten the soul’s life, to the pitiless actions and reactions of conflicting interests and appetites, to the infinite demands of matter to manufacture and use. To all the greeds and all the wounds which every man has by nature, it adds incessant sensual stimuli, and the countless horde of all kinds of errors, sparkling and sharpened, to which it gives free circulation in the sky of intelligence. And it says to each of the poor children of men set in the midst of this turmoil: “You are a free individual; defend yourself, save yourself, all by yourself.” It is a homicidal civilization.\n\nMoreover, if a State is to be built out of this dust of individuals, then – and most logically, as the individual as such is, as I have said, only a part – the individual will be completely annexed to the social whole, will no longer exist except for the city, and we shall see individualism culminate quite naturally in the monarchic tyranny of a Hobbes, the democratic tyranny of a Rousseau or the tyranny of the “Providence-State” and the “God- State” of a Hegel and his disciples.\n\nOn the contrary, according to the principles of St Thomas, it is because he is an individual of a species that man, having need of the help of his fellows to perfect his specific activity, is consequently an individual of the city, a member of society. And on this count he is subordinated to the good of his city as to the good of the whole, the common good which as such is more divine and therefore better deserving the love of each than his very own life.[15] But if it is a question of the destiny which belongs to a man as a person, the relation is inverse, and it is the human city which is subordinate to his destiny. If every human person is made directly, as to his first and proper good, for God, who is his ultimate end[16] and “the distinct and common good” of the entire universe, he ought not therefore, on this count, in accordance with his law of charity, to prefer anything to himself save God.[17] So much so that according as personality is realised in any being, to that extent does it become an independent whole and not a part (whatever be its ties on other grounds). Thus the individual in each one of us, taken as an individual member of the city, exists for his city, and ought at need to sacrifice his life for it, as for instance in a just war. But taken as a person whose destiny is God, the city exists for him, to wit, for the advancement of the moral and spiritual life and the access to divine goods; for that is the very end of personality; and it is only by virtue of this that the city has its common good. Thus Christianity maintains and reinforces the moral framework and the hierarchies of the city, it has not denounced slavery[18] as of itself contrary to the natural law. But it calls slave and master alike to the same supernatural destiny and the same communion of saints. It makes every soul in a state of grace the dwelling of the living God; it teaches us that unjust laws are no laws, and that the Prince’s command must be disobeyed when it is contrary to God’s command. It bases law and juridical relations not on the free will of individuals, but on justice towards persons. Let us say that the Christian City is as fundamentally anti-individualist as it is fundamentally personalist.\n\nThis distinction between the individual and the person when applied to the relations between man and the city, contains, in the realm of metaphysical principles, the solution of many social problems. If, on the one hand – and this explains the very essence of political life – , if the common good of the city is quite different from the simple aggregate of the benefits pertaining to each individual,[19] it is also different from the good pertaining to the whole, taken by itself; it is, so to speak, a good common to the whole and the parts, and it must in consequence admit of redistribution to the latter, considered no longer merely as parts, but as things and as persons. On the other hand – and this concerns the end of political life – , if the earthly and temporal perfection of the rational animal has its realization in the city, in itself better than the individual, yet the city is essentially bound to ensure that its members have the conditions of a sound moral life, a properly human life, and bound to pursue the temporal good which is its immediate object only with respect for its essential subordination to the spiritual and eternal good to which every human person is ordered.[20] And since this spiritual and eternal good is in fact, by the Creator’ s grace, not the simple end of natural religion, but an essentially supernatural end – to enter by vision into the very joy of God – the human city fails in justice and sins against itself and its members if, when the truth is sufficiently proposed to it, it refuses to recognize Him who is the Way of beatitude.[21]\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn the spiritual order the distinction between individuality and personality is no less necessary. Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange has shown its bearing admirably:\n\n“Man will be fully a person, a per se subsistens and a per se operans, only in so far as the life of reason and liberty dominates that of the senses and passions in him; otherwise he will remain like the animal, a simple individual, the slave of events and circumstances, always led by something else, incapable of guiding himself; he will be only a part, without being able to aspire to be a whole…”\n\n“To develop one’s individuality is to live the egoistical life of the passions, to make oneself the centre of everything, and end finally by being the slave of a thousand passing goods which bring us a wretched momentary joy.”\n\n“Personality, on the contrary, increases as the soul rises above the sensible world and by intelligence and will binds itself more closely to what makes the life of the spirit.”\n\n“The philosophers have caught sight of it, but the saints especially have understood, that the full development of our poor personality consists in losing it in some way in that of God, who alone possesses personality in the perfect sense of the word, for He alone is absolutely independent in His being and action.”[22]\n\nThe personality of the wise is still very precarious and mingled! How much poor plaster there is on the stoic’s austere mask. The privileges of personality – the pure life of intelligence and liberty, the pure agility of the spirit, which is self-sufficient for action as for being – , are so deeply buried in our case in the matter of our fleshly individuality that we can only free them by being ready to fall to earth and die there in order to bear divine fruit, and we shall only know our true face when we receive the white stone on which God has written our new name. Truly perfect personality is only found in saints.\n\nThe saints have acquired in a sense, have received by grace, what God possesses by nature: independence of all created things, not only in regard to bodies but even in regard to intelligences. “The saints have their dominion, their glory, their victory, their brilliance, and have no need of carnal or intellectual dignities with which they have no relation, for they add nothing to them and take nothing from them; they are seen by God and the angels, not by bodies or curious minds. God suffices them.[23]\n\nBut did the saints set out to “develop their personality”? They found it without seeking, because they did not seek it, but God alone. They understood that their person, just in so far as it was person, in so far as it was free, was complete dependence on God, and that the inner control over our acts, which we cannot resign before man or angel, they must deliver into the bands of God, by whose Spirit they must be moved in order to be His sons. “They understood that God must become for them another self, closer to them than their own selves, that God was more themselves than themselves, because He is eminently selfhood”; then they “sought to make themselves something of God, quid Dei.” I am fastened to the cross with Christ. Now I live, yet not I, but it is Christ who liveth in me. Although in the order of Being they keep a self distinct from God’s, “in the order of operation, of knowledge and love, they have, so to say, substituted the divine Self for their own,”[24] renouncing all personality or independence in regard to God, understanding that the first-born among them, their eternal model, had no human personality, but the divine Personality of the Word in whom His human nature subsisted.\n\nSuch is the secret of our life as men which the poor modern world does not know: we gain our soul only if we lose it; a total death is needed before we can find ourselves. And when we are utterly stripped, lost, torn out of ourselves, then all is ours who are Christ’s and Christ himself and God himself is our good.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLuther’s history, like that of Jean-Jacques, is a wonderful illustration of this doctrine. He did not free human personality, he led it astray. What he did free was the material individuality which we have just defined, the animal man. Cannot we see it in his own life? As he gets older, his energy becomes less and less a soul’s energy, and more and more the energy of a temperament. Driven by great desires and vehement longings which fed on instinct and feeling, not on intelligence; possessed by the passions, loosing the tempest around him, breaking every obstacle and all “external” discipline; but having within him a heart full of contradictions and discordant cries; seeing life, before Nietzsche, as essentially tragic,[25] Luther is the very type of modern[26] individualism (the prototype of modern times, Fichte calls him). But in reality his personality is disunited, ruined. There is much weakness of soul behind all his bluster.\n\nIt is significant that to free the human being he began by breaking the vows of religion; and the “joyful tidings”, as Harnack calls it, which he announced to Christendom, at once spread an epidemic of despair over Germany.[27] German Protestants would have us recognize the greatness of Luther. Material greatness, quantitative greatness, animal greatness, yes, we will grant that, and, if you will, admire it; but truly human greatness, no. The confusion between these two kinds of greatness, or energy, between the individual and the person, is at the heart of Germanism, and it shows us why Germans conceive personality as a hurricane, a buffalo, or an elephant. It explains too why we see the old spring of the spirit of Luther gush out in all the great inspirers of Protestant Germany such as Lessing and Fichte. Fichte calls Luther the German par excellence, and that is true in so far as the Reformation succeeded in separating Germany from Catholicism. Happy the nation whose supreme incarnation of her own genius is not a mere individuality of flesh but a personality radiant with the Spirit of God! If we want to set against Luther’s egocentrism an example of true personality, let us think of that miracle of simplicity and uprightness, of candour and wisdom, of humility and magnanimity, of loss of self in God, Joan of Arc.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Erl., 28, 144.\n\n[2] “But yet there was something very special about the secret of this justifying faith, and that was, that it did not consist in a general belief in the Saviour, in his mysteries and promises, but in believing most certainly, each in his own heart, that all our sins had been forgiven us. Luther incessantly repeated that we are justified as soon as we believe with certainty that we are justified; and the certainty which he required was not merely that moral certainty which is based on reasonable motives and excludes agitation and trouble, but an absolute certainty, an infallible certainty, in which the sinner must believe he is justified with the same faith with which he believes that Jesus Christ came into the world.” (Bossuet: Hist. des Var., I, 8.) So Lutheranism seems to be a sort of “mind cure” in the order of eternal salvation.\n\n[3] See the very judicious note by M. Paquier on this point. (Denifle-Paquier, III, 428-9.)\n\n[4] Cf. St. Thomas, Summa Theol., I-II, 112, 5; De Verit., X, 10; in II Cor., 13, lect. 2. St. Bonaventure, I Sent. dist. 17, pars I, q. 3; 3 Sent., dist. 26, ma. I, q. 5: “Haberi potest certitudo per probabilem conjecturam et per quamdam confidentiam, quae consurgit ex conscientia bona.” Alexander of Hales (3 p., q. 71, m. 3, a. I): “Nec dimisit nos Deus penitus in gratiae ignorantia, quia dedit nobis ut cognosceremus ipsam secundum affectivam cognitionem in experientia et sensu divinae dulcedinis, quae est ex gratia.” And a. 2: “Concedendum quod per scientiam experimentalem possumus scire nos habere gratiam.”\n\n[5] “For him, then, there could only be question of soteriology, and that in this sense, man remained its central point. To-day, Protestant theologians take pleasure in the thought that Christ is the centre of Luther’s “system.” Nothing is more untrue, and nothing more in contradiction to the conclusions of a psychological inquiry into the process of his evolution. Although it speaks often of Christ, the centre of Luther’s theology is not Christ, but man.” (Denifle-Paquier, III, 249-250. Italicised in the text.)\n\n[6] It is speculative and practical at the same time from its higher unity, but it is primarily and chiefly speculative. (Cf. Summa Theol., I, 1, 4.)\n\n[7] For Luther, grace is nothing else than the simple exterior favour of God. Cf. Weim., VIII, 106, 22; Erl., 63, 123, etc. Denifle-Paquier, III, pp. 77, 213, 217.\n\n[8] ln Galat. (1535), Weim., XL, P. 1, 293, 24-27.\n\n[9] Erl., 15, 60 (1527).\n\n[10] Tischreden (1531-1532), ed. Preger, 1888, p. 41. Cf. Cordatus ed. Wrampelmeyer, p. 131, n.573; Colloquia, ed. Bindseil, II, 298, 3-7.\n\n[11] We say that in actual fact it is an inevitable result of Luther’s theology. That does not prevent the same theology from running, simultaneously and in theory, to the opposite extreme. (It is not uncommon in Luther as in Descartes to find an extreme error counterbalancing another error diametrically opposed to it.) So Luther tells us that salvation and faith are so much the work of God and of Christ that they alone are the agents without any active co-operation on our part.*\n\n“Homo antequam renovetur in novam creaturam regni spiritus, nihil facit, nihil conatur, quo paratur ad eam renovationem et regnum; deinde renovatus, nihil facit, nihil conatur, quo perseveret in eo regna, sed utrumque facit solus spiritus in nobis, nos sine nobis recreans et conservans recreatos… sed non operatur sine nobis ut quos in hoc ipsum recreavit et conservat, ut operaretur in nobis et nos ei cooperaremur.” An entirely passive and material co-operation (since we remain radically bad) which consists only in submitting to Divine action, in order that it may draw from us the works of the new man (but without our own action intervening or our liberty being exercised). It is in this completely passive sense that we become “new creatures”and that God acts in us and through us. “Sic per nos praedicat, miseretur pauperibus, consolatur afflictos. Verum quid hinc libera arbitrio tribuitur? Imo quid ei relinquitur nisi nihil? Et vere nihil.” (De servo arbitrio, Weim., XVIII, 754) From this point of view Denifle is right in maintaining that Luther’s theory of faith is full of contradictions and is even made impossible (for according to St. Augustine belief depends upon our free activity: “Credere vel non credere in libera arbitrio est voluntatis humanae” De Praed. Sanct V. 10) and that it only remains to say that it is not we who believe, but God Himself Who believes in us.\n\n“Fides opus est omnium operum excellentissimum et arduissimum”, writes Luther (De captiv. Babyl., 1520; Weim., VI, 530) “…Est opus Dei, non hominis, sicut dicit Paulus; caetera nobiscum et per nos operatur, hoc unicum in nobis et sine nobis operatur.”\n\nThe co-operation (nobiscum et per nos) which he mentions with regard to other works is already quite passive and material as we have just seen, and now he excludes this same co~operation from the work of faith (sine nobis)! Denifle bas carefully noted the way in which Luther warped the scholastic formula:, of which he knew little concerning the infusion of supernatural virtues (Denifle- Paquier III, 273-274). He might have added thal Luther deforms and corrupts in the same way the scholastic theory concerning gratia operans.\n\nM. Karl Holl (Revue de théol. et de phil. art. cit.) accuses Denifte and us of having suppressed the “Christ within us” of Luther’s Christology. M. Karl Holl does not understand the question in point. Neither has he read the “in fact” which qualifies all our development. (Cf. p. 3)\n\nWe never thought of denying (nor has Denifle so far as we know) the part played in theory, by the ‘Christ within us’ in Lutheran theology. The question is, whether Christ acts in us by and with our own proper activity or without it. The moment we believe in determinism, and the essential and irremediable corruption of our nature: the moment we no longer understand that man, made by grace consors divinae naturae acts of himself, freely and meritoriously, under the action of God and Christ, as a secondary cause, subordinated to the first cause – so that our good acts come entirely from ourselves as secondary causes, and altogether from God as principal cause, and that we are only the first cause in the order of evil – then we must either attribute salvation and good works to Jesus Christ alone, acting in us without our own active co-operation, or make everything depend upon the impulse of faith and confidence which comes from us alone, whereby we attain the merits of Christ.\n\nLuther’s theology will vary without ceasing between these two solutions; in theory it appears to be the first which will prevail, but as it is psychologically impossible to eliminate human activity, it is the second which will de facto prevail.\n\nWhen Luther’s theology teaches that Christ fulfils the law for us, it varies constantly between the idea that works prescribed by divine law are done by another IN us (without the co-operation of our own activity) – that is why it is sufficient to have faith, good works necessarily follow – and the idea that the works of the law have been accomplished by another IN OUR PLACE – that is why it is enough to have faith; and so, were we to sin a thousand times a day, we should nevertheless be saved and accepted by God. Here again, because psychologically faith alone will not prevent us falling or make us produce good works inevitably, it is the second idea which actually prevails in practice. It is easy to go from a law which is fulfilled in us by another to a law which we do not fulfil.\n\n* “He alone commands and alone fulfils.” (Von der Freiheit eines Christenmenschen Weim, VII, 24.) “Nostrum agere est pati operantem in nobis Deum.” (In Galat. 1535, Weim., XL, Pt. 610, 17.) “He who wishes to uphold freewill in man and to maintain, howsoever restrictedly, that in the spiritual order it is capable of anything and can give it support, that man denies Christ. I hold to that, and I know that it is the very truth. (Tischreden, Weim., VI, 119, 10-13, No 6683.)\n\n[12] Cf. Dilthey: Das naturliche System der Geisteswissensshaften, Arch. f. Gesch. der Phil., t. V, p. 377ff (and p. 285).\n\n[13] Obviously we are considering here only the spiritual principle of modern individualism. That in other orders – social, intellectual, aesthetic – this latter had already made its appearance long before the Reformation, and that the Lutheran revolution to a degree drove back individualism by its communal or gregarious character and by the half-political, half-ecclesiastical character which it took on under pressure from the State, that it had this primary effect so far as visible institutions were concerned, is quite a different question and does not affect our conclusions in any way. (See note 26.)\n\n[14] Summa Theol., I, 29, 3. Cf. Cajetan’s Commentary.\n\n[15] St. Thomas, Summa Theol., I, 60, 5; II-II, 61, I; 64, 2, 5; 65, 1. As Cajetan (in I, 60, 5) remarks against Scotus, it is not because it finds its proper good in the whole but because, as a part, it is essentially related to the whole and only exists for it, that the part, as such, prefers the whole to itself and sacrifices if necessary its own good to the common good, as the hand sacrifices itself if necessary for the body. “Non ergo ratio inclinationis talis est identitas, aut ut salvet seipsam in toto, sed ut salvet esse totius secundum se, etiam cum non esse ipsius partis. Sed ratio talis inclinationis est quaro assignavit sanctus Thomas quia scilicet et natura et substantia partis hoc ipsum quod est, essentialiter, et primo propter totum et totius esse est.”\n\nLet us add that man, if he is a part of the city, regarded as an individual having need of his fellow creatures in order to complete, here below, his specific work (civilization) – in this sense St. Thomas teaches that all his acts, inasmuch as they are susceptible of human, exterior communication can be referred to the good of the political community* – yet regarded formally as a person destined for God, he is, on the contrary, possessed of the character of a whole and escapes the political order. Homo non ordinatur ad communitatem politicum secundum se totum et secundum omnia sua (Summa Theol. I-II, 21, 4 ad 3).\n\nIn his “Leçons de philosophie sociale” (t. 1, p. 14 seq.) it was Fr. Schwalm who drew attention to this point but he did not avoid certain obscurities and confusions. Let us note, in particular, that if man “naturaliter est pars alicujus multitudinis per quam praestetur sibi auxilium ad bene vivendum”, this means that as a part his good is subordinate to the good of the community like the imperfect to the perfect, and not that society is subordinated to the good of each individual. (Schwalm, p. 17)\n\nOn the other band in the followmg text (Ibid., p. 23) “Totus homo ordinatur ut ad finem ad totam communitatem cujus est pars” (II-II, 65, I ), the words totus homo as is shown by the context, refer to the integnty of the corporal members (the question is “utrum in aliquo casu possit esse licitum mutilare aliquem membra sua”) and not to that which integrates the human being: for from that point of view the express teaching of St. Thomas, as we have said above, is that “man is not subordinated to the political community as to his whole person, and as to all that belongs to him.”\n\n* “Et secundum hoc actus omnium virtutum ad justitiam pertinere, secundum quod ordinat hominem ad bonum commune.” Summa II-II, 58, 5.\n\n[16] St. Thomas: Summa Theol., I-II, 2, 8; Summa contra Gent., III, 48; in Polit. Arist. (lib. 3, c. 9), lect. 7. In ad 3 of q. 64, a. 2, IIa-IIae, St. Thomas explains that if the death penalty is legitimate, it is not only because the guilty man bas become by his crime a destroyer of the common good, but also because by chosing to fall from the order of reason, he has entered in some way into the slavery belonging to the beasts, which are only for the use of others. “Et ideo quamvis hominem in sua dignitate manentem occidere sit secundum se malum, tamen hominem peccatorem occidere potest esse bonum, sicut occidere bestiam: pejor enim est malus homo, quam bestia et plus nocet, ut Phil. dicit in I. Politic. (cap. 2) et in 7 Ethic. (cap. 6).” And the punishment of death, by giving the man opportunity to restore the order of reason in himself by an act of conversion to the Last End, does precisely allow him to recover his dignity as a human person.\n\n[17] Sum. Theol., II-II, 26, 4. One must fully understand this doctrine. We do not say that the person itself, the subject responsible for its action and capable of virtue, is not a part of the city! This would be absurd, “quaelibet persona singularis comparatur ad totum communitatem sicut pars ad totum.” II-II, 64, 2. And the acts of all the virtues are to be referred to the good of the city (ibid., 58, 5) which itself is a human and moral good.\n\nWe say that the single person (itself) can be considered either under the formal aspect of an individual part of the city or under the formal aspect of a person destined to God: in the first case its own good is to be referred to the good of the community, in the second case it is that common temporal good which is to be referred to its interests, spiritual and eternal.\n\nThis doctrine of individuality and of personality is at the very roots of Thomist metaphysics. The whole theory of “individuation” shows that for St. Thomas the individual as such is a part. (Even in the angel, where the principal of individuation is the specific essence itself, not the matter, it is because the essence – really distinct in respect of its existence and potency – is the ground of multiplicity, that it is also a ground of individuality.) On the other hand for St. Thomas, the idea of personality bespeaks as such independence of a whole. In the same way it alone, with the notion of object of knowledge, denotes a term which can, while making one with something else, not imply in any manner the rôle of a part; this is the reason why God who cannot “enter into composition” with anything at all nor be part of a whole, cannot be united by himself to a creature except either as an object intelligible in the beatific vision (in ratione puri termini objectivi) or as a person in the Incarnation (in ratione puri termini personalis). In the Holy Trinity the idea of personality reaches the plenitude of pure act. One has then a society divinely perfect, where three persons equal and consubstantial have for common good their own nature, and where each is as much as the three together, in other words, where the notion of individuation and part has entirely disappeared. (“Si autem accipiamus numerum prout est in rebus numeratis, sic in rebus quidem creatis, unus est pars duorum, et duo trium, ut unus homo duorum et duo trium; et sic non est in Dea quia tantus est pater, quanta tata est trinitas.” Sum. Theol., I, go, 1, ad 4)\n\n[18] On the metaphysical idea of servitude, cf. St. Thomas, Sum. Theol., I, 96, 4. To take the word in its exact sense, that person is in servitude who finds himself under the government of another for the sake of the private utility of the latter (and not for the sake of the good of the subject himself or the common good). That is a penal state consequent upon the sin of Adam. If in its harder form this status, which, even when it does not amount to a violation of the natural law and the essential rights of the human person, is repugnant to the spirit of the New Testament, has been gradually abolished by the influence of Christianity, it will be noticed, nevertheless, that it still exists in less apparent forms, and that the modern idea of “proletariat”, for example, conforms to the very strict meaning defined by St. Thomas. It is to be presumed that in one form or another, which we may hope will be less and less cruel, it will subsist as long as the results of original sin.\n\n[19] “Bonum commune civitatis et bonum singulare unius personae non differunt secundum multum et paucum, sed secundum formalem differentiam. Alia est enim ratio Boni communis et Boni singularis, sicut alia ratio totius et partis. Et ideo Philosophus in I. Politic dicit quod non bene dicunt qui dicunt civitatem et domum et alia hujusmodi differre solum multitudine et paucitate, et non specie.” Summa Theol., II-II, 58, 7, ad 2.\n\n[20] Cf. Summa Theol. II-II, 83, b; in Ethic Nicom. I lect, 1.\n\n[21] “Quia igitur vitae, qua in praesenti bene vivimus, finis est beatitudo coelestis, ad regis officium pertinet ea ratione vitam multitudinis bonam procurare secundum quod congruit ad coelestem beatitudinem consequendam, ut scilicet ea praecipiat, quae ad coelestem beatitudinem ducunt, et eorum contraria, secundum quod fuerit possibile, interdicat. Quae autem sit ad veram beatitudinem via, et quae sint impedimenta ejus, ex lege divina cognoscitur, cujus doctrina pertinet ad sacerdotum officium.” St. Thomas, De Regimine principum, I, 15. Hence the indirect power of the Church over civil society. Cf. Garrigou-Lagrange, de Revelatione, II, 440 ff.\n\n[22] R. Garrigou-Lagrange: Le Sens commun, 2nd ed. (Nouvelle Librairie Nationale), pp. 332-333.\n\n[23] Pascal: Pensées, Brunschvicg, 793.\n\n[24] Garrigou-Lagrange; loc. cit., pp. 334-335.\n\n[25] Nostrae vitae tragedia, Weim., I, 92. A word very true in itself, but in the doctrine of Luther it bears on a human nature rooted in evil, like a fallen angel which Christ saves. as by a coup, by violence contrary to the nature of thmgs, as one might save, to suppose the impossible, a sort of demon. So the tragedy of human life took the colour of angelical despair which was to become so astounding in the modern world.\n\nThe cry of a Christian, “Without you we can do nothing”, a cry of enraptured joy, an amen where nature and grace kissed, becomes now a shriek of anguish.\n\n[26] Luther himself was certainly not a modern man, anymore than he was a Protestant. But this does not prevent him from being at the origin of the modern world just as he is at the origin of Protestantism. And that is just what makes his case so interesting. A ruined Catholic, a spoilt Saint, it is in his false, insane, and altogether egocentric way of throwing htmself on certain old truths too much forgotten by those around him (e.g. confidence in Jesus Christ, contempt for oneself, the value of conscience as an immediate judge of our actions, and for fallen man the impossibility of attaining to a natural perfection without the grace of Christ, etc.) that one sees appearing in him the principal modern errors.\n\nAnd is it not thus, according to St. Thomas, that the great primordial sins were produced? The sin of the angels and the sin of Adam: they wished for something good in itself – resemblance to God – in a wrong way. Men like Luther are violators of truth. We are quite prepared to believe with M. Jean Baruzi (Luther, interprète de St. Paul, Revue de Théo. et de Philos., janvier-mars 1928) that Luther adheres more closely to Taulerian mysticism – though at the same time he degrades it – than is generally thought.\n\nIf by some inevitable fate Luther’s revoit was to be the far-off progenitor of liberation, private judgement, etc., originally it appeared under a totally different guise. As has often been remarked, it was, Iike Jansenism, a reactionary heresy with its eyes fixed on the past. Such are the most tenacious heresies in religion, while in the secular order it is, on the contrary, error in the name of novelty that succeeds.\n\nAgainst the semi-rationalism of Gabriel Biel and of decadent scholasticism, Luther rears an exaggerated religious sentiment, fed on an Augustinianism vitiated and very soon completely falsified.\n\nIt may be seen how certain Protestant critics (M. René Gollouir, M. Louis Dallière) have been able to misunderstand our position: because we consider Luther to be the father of modern individualism, they have thought that we made him an individualist, in the modern sense of the word. Such was never our idea. That the idea of individualistic religion would have horrified Luther, that he always loved the “idea of the Church”, and even at the moment of his breaking with ber, pretended to be serving the Church against the Pope, of this we are as much convinced as M. Dallière (La réalité de l’Église, étude théologique et religieuse, Montpellier, juillet 1927, pp. 422-427). But in freeing the Christian communities from the Roman tyranny, and from the spiritual authority of the vicar of Christ, he was really freeing them from the unity of the Body of Chnst, only to imprison them, in spite of himself, in the temporal body of the political and national community, and to subject them finally to the authority of the Princes whom he hated. National individualism (cujus regio ejus religio) was soon to appear as the inevitable result of the conquest of Christian liberty. In addition, the spiritual principle of Luther’s Reform, by a fatal logic, incomparably stronger than Luther himself, was bound to bear its fruits.\n\n[27] “From 1530, when his doctrine had come fully into practice, there was everywhere an increase of melancholy, of gloomy sadness, of agonies of despair, of doubt of the divine grace, and of suicides… Enough books of consolation cannot be written against the fear of death and the wrath of God, against sadness and melancholy, against doubt about the grace of God and eternal happiness. Until then, nothing like it had been seen.\n\n“In the spectacle which the preachers afford us here there is a bitter irony; they cannot boast enough about the consolation which the new ‘Gospel’ brings, as opposed to the agony produced by Catholic doctrine, and yet they are compelled to draw attention publicly to the increase of sadness and suicide… ‘Never was need of consolation so keenly felt as in our days.’ (Magdeburgius: A fine remedy to soothe the pains and sorrows of suffering Christians, Lübeck, 1555) Indeed, “more than ever we hear alas, daily, that either in full health or in the hour of their agony people fall into despair, lose their reason, and, some at least, go so far as to kill themselves.” (Baumgartner.) … Neither Luther himself, nor his panegyrist Mathesius, nor Leonard Beyer, he, too, formerly an Augustinian and then pastor at Guben, nor others beside, could escape the temptation to have done with Iife, to such a degree that when they were in that state it was dangerous for them to have a knife at hand… George Besler, one of the first propagators of Lutheranism at Nuremberg, fell into such deep melancholy that in 1536 he left his wife in the middle of the night and plunged a hunting-spear full in his breast… In the agonies of death and in temptations Luther did not succeed in living his faith. Nor was it otherwise with his believers, with those among his people who were “pious”. We know it already of his friend Jerome Weller; others of his friends were in the same case, George Spalatin, Justus Jonas, Mathesius, Nicolas Hausmann, George Rorarius; and other leaders of the Reformation: Flaccius Illyricus, William and Balthasar Bidembach, Joachim Mörlin, Chemnitz, Isinder of Königsberg, Andrew Gundelwein, and a host of others who fell, more or less, especially in their last years, into overwhelming agonies, into an incurable sadness, and even into madness, without the consolations of Luther and others being any use to them.” Denifle, IV, 23-27. Cf. Döllinger: Die Reformation, II, 688 ff."
