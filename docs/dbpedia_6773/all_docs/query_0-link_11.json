Maurice Barrès was a French novelist, journalist, and politician in the late 19th/early 20th century. He began as a romantic individualist writer but shifted to nationalism after the Dreyfus Affair. Politically, he led the nationalist League of the French Fatherland and Ligue des Patriotes, promoting local patriotism, militarism, and anti-Semitism. During WWI, he strongly supported the war effort. While influential among early 20th century French writers and politicians, Dadaists later mocked Barrès and his nationalist views in a mock trial.",
