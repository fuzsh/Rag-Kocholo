        "text": "This article is a follow-up to the previous one entitled: \"Éric Zemmour, dangerous revisionist?\". The polemicist Zemmour makes no secret of his predilection for Charles Maurras and Jacques Bainville, representatives of the French royalist extreme right from the end of the 19th to the first third of the 20th century. Both were the leading lights of the nationalist journal Action Française. Zemmour's references to Charles Maurras and Jacques Bainville are recurrent, as soon as the history of France is mentioned. He is inhabited by them and excels in the resumption of nationalist and xenophobic conceptions that are directly inspired by them. This is not a trial of intent, but an analysis of Zemmour's true identification with these extreme right-wing thinkers of the interwar period. Zemmour is a cultured man. He writes a lot. And reads even more. He chooses his readings carefully. And when he takes up his pen to list a book, his choice is never random. In Le Figaro, he reports on the work of Christophe Dickès devoted to Jacques Bainville, journalist, historian, polemicist and one of the inspirers of the Action française. We suspected that Zemmour was leaning towards Maurras. We must not forget here the other great figure of the French extreme right: Maurice Barrès, born on August 19, 1862 in Charmes and died on December 4, 1923 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, who was a French writer and politician, a leading figure of French nationalism. Let's not forget that it was the fiery words of Barrès, Bainville and Maurras that fanaticized Raoul Villain, the assassin of Jean Jaurès, at the café Le croissant in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, on July 31, 1914, on the eve of the declaration of war in August 1914; a war against which the socialist leader of the newspaper L'Humanité had tried with all his might to fight and impose the refusal of the war and the neutrality of the French left. It was there that Raoul Villain shot Jean Jaurès through a window hidden behind a curtain. This act eliminates the last hesitations of France to engage in the conflict. Villain first wanted to shoot the German emperor Wilhelm II, but then gave up in the face of insurmountable difficulties. The idea of killing Jaurès gradually took root in Villain. Faced with the massive arming of Germany, and the pacifist ideas of certain left-wing personalities, including Jean Jaurès, the young man made his decision to kill the founder of L'Humanité. \"I was,\" he says, \"frightened of the danger that the fatherland could be led by such people. So I had the idea of killing this man whom I believed to be harmful,\" reported Le Figaro in its March 25, 1919 edition, during the trial that acquitted Villain. Raoul Villain was executed by Francisco Franco's Spanish Phalangists in Majorca in 1936. It is an irony of history that a French fascist, the assassin of Jean Jaurès, was shot by other fascists. It is not innocent on our part to link Villain's murder of Jaurès to Zemmour's inspirers, Barrès, Maurras and Bainville, for it was their ideas that armed Villain's arm. When Zemmour makes himself the spokesman of their nationalist, hateful and xenophobic thoughts, the memory of the death of Jaurès is an invitation to block the way of the one who tries to gather and mobilize the old anti-republican right. Otherwise, what should we think of Zemmour's determination to rehabilitate Philippe Pétain, who erased the \"Wench\" (the Third Republic) as soon as he could in 1940 and tried to have the leaders of the Third Republic condemned in Riom in 1941 as \"traitors to the French nation\"?"
