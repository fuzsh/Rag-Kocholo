He loved the grog, a yarn, the girls, his mates and acting - and Australia loved him back. Film, TV, radio and stage - knockabout larrikin Meillon triumphed in the lot. Meillon's story - with its amazing credits and stellar list of international co-conspirators - is told by Bunny Gibson and Frank Gauntlett with an introduction by best-selling author the late Bryce Courtenay. Award-winning actor, international skater, singer, comedienne, producer, businesswoman and now writer Bunny Gibson is probably best known for selling tonnes of margarine on TV as the unstoppable Rita The Eta Eater. Bunny and John were married for 18 years and together for two remarkable decades. Bunny tells the story of their curious compatibility and - as The Man himself said: \"I may have been a nuisance but I've never been a bore!\" Playwright, journalist and general textmaniac, Frank covers Meillon's incredible career from the Golden Age of radio to iconic screen star, from the abysmal lows to the delightful highs.
