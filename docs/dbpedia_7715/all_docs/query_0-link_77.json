        "text": "Note: These lists are always slowly growing, so this represents all the films so far from 1986 that I have reviewed on the site, in order of best to worst based solely on score (ties are ordered alphabetically).\n\nBlue Velvet (1986)\n\nDirected by David Lynch. Starring Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Laura Dern, Dennis Hopper, George Dickerson, Hope Lange, Dean Stockwell, Priscilla Pointer, Frances Bay, Fred Pickler. [R]\n\nBecause of its elusive meaning and tightly-controlled filmmaking style, Lynch’s mesmerizing, subversive tour de force peeling back the spotless veneer of small-town America to get at the perversely corrupted heart hasn’t lost any of its surreal beauty or disturbing power. Equal parts shock comedy and waking nightmare, the story takes the form of a dream-like mystery where college student MacLachlan stumbles upon a grisly discovery that leads him to a despairing, masochistic lounge singer (Rossellini), the gas-huffing psychopath (Hopper) who keeps her as a sex slave, and other assorted deviants and weirdos. Lynch’s wry send-up of the plasticity of conformist decency is pitted at such an askew angle against the antisocial depravity of the underworld that each layer of the film seems to leap off the screen—visually, thematically, even the way that the roles are performed (they never share the screen, but imagine if the wholesome stiffness of “girl next door” Dern ever collided with Hopper’s foul-mouthed volatility). Indelible, stylish, and controversial, it seems impossible to be unmoved by the experience, regardless of where one’s opinion may end up landing. Lynch’s first collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti, whose score infuses the film with haunting, jazzy soundscapes that are (appropriately) equal parts entrancing and repellent. Brad Dourif plays one of Hopper’s goons.\n\n97/100\n\nAliens (1986)\n\nDirected by James Cameron. Starring Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Paul Reiser, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, William Hope, Mark Rolston, Colette Hiller. [R]\n\nStunning continuation to Alien picks up some 57 years later when the escape shuttle carrying lone survivor Ellen Ripley (plus Jonesy the cat) is finally rescued, and even though she’s traumatized by nightmares, she’s still asked to serve as a consultant for a military operation to the moon where the Xenomorph was first encountered—in the intervening years, it has been colonized…but the colonists are no longer responding. Rather than try to recreate the intense dread and creeping horror of the original, director/co-writer Cameron and crew push everything to a whole other level, crafting a peerless marriage of action, horror, science fiction and war pictures for the sort of full-throttle crash-and-bang rollercoaster ride that can galvanize again and again. Thanks to Weaver’s compelling and persuasive performance, Ripley becomes a hero for the ages, transformed from a resourceful survivor to a matriarchal protector; she’s surrounded predominantly by archetypes, but their personalities shine bright enough to make this far more than a who’s-gonna-get-it-next thriller—their fates actually matter. A technical tour de force pitched at a relentless pace after a satisfying slow build, and one of the greatest sequels of all time. Oscar winning sound editing and visual effects. Extended cut adds about seventeen minutes of additional material, including a scene that never should have been removed: the revelation of what had become of Ripley’s daughter.\n\n96/100\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone. Starring Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, John C. McGinley, Francesco Quinn, Keith David, Mark Moses, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, David Neidorf, Reggie Johnson, Dale Dye, Tony Todd. [R]\n\nOliver Stone’s vivid, trenchant Vietnam War drama as seen through the eyes of Sheen’s green, fresh-from-basic-training infantry volunteer (loosely based on Stone himself). During his tour of duty, he finds himself pulled in different directions by the conflicting viewpoints of two of his sergeants: the brutal, no-nonsense Berenger (with memorable facial scars) and the more agreeable, idealistic Dafoe. Transports the viewer deep into the jungle, at eye-level with the grunts, delivering a visceral experience that has rarely been equaled before or since in a war movie; narrative depicts not just the horrors of combat, but also the day-to-day misery of constant fear and anxiety in inhospitable conditions, without meaning or logic to guide their actions. Perhaps because his budget was so limited, Stone’s showy and sometimes excessive directorial flourishes are nowhere to be seen—he just puts the camera down at ground level and records the chaos. Strong performances from a capable cast, large enough to include a handful of up-and-comers in small roles like Johnny Depp and Living Colour vocalist Corey Glover. Utilizes Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” piece so well that many people think that it’s the film’s original theme composition. Flaws in Stone’s script aside (all-too-clean division within the platoon, naïve final line, etc.), this is a film that works on the gut level—including the punch it delivers to that region—and features numerous moments of harrowing power. Won four Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Editing and Sound.\n\n93/100\n\nHannah and Her Sisters (1986)\n\nDirected by Woody Allen. Starring Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Michael Caine, Dianne Wiest, Barbara Hershey, Max von Sydow, Maureen O’Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Carrie Fisher, Julie Kavner, Daniel Stern, Sam Waterston. [R]\n\nWinning blend of sadness, humor, romance and pathos, elegantly complex but canny enough to never become confusing or burdensome. Traces the paths of several people related by blood or marriage; Caine is married to Farrow but in love with sister-in-law Hershey, Allen is divorced from Farrow and has a run-in with her other sister (Wiest) years after they had a disastrous date, etc. Exciting to watch unfold yet comfortable as an old shoe, warmly incorporating conflicted emotions, admiration for Duck Soup and e e cummings, existential crises, sibling rivalries, and infatuations that catch in the throat. Won two Academy Awards for its acting (Caine and Wiest) and another for Woody’s script, which is ambitious, empathetic, observant…and blinkered—tastefully repressed, to be more specific, and indicative of a certain quality of character, though it’s a wonder why the only ones to burst free of the restrictions are minor parts, and almost always irretrievably flaky types. Features a slew of bit parts for familiar faces (most of them before they were famous): Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, J. T. Walsh, John Turturro, Richard Jenkins, Lewis Black, and more.\n\n91/100\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors (1986)\n\nDirected by Frank Oz. Starring Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Michelle Weeks, Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell, Bill Murray, John Candy, (voice) Levi Stubbs. [PG]\n\nLavish (if knowingly artificial) recreation of the off-Broadway musical adaptation of Roger Corman’s cult cheapie about a man-eating plant named Audrey II and the milquetoast named Seymour who loves it. Smartly-cast from top-to-bottom; shy Moranis and squeaky-voiced Greene (the latter reprising her stage role) are wonderfully broad but human, and Martin and Murray are both hysterical as a sadistic dentist and his eager masochist patient respectively. Buoyant but blackly-comic, there’s an infectious joy to the filmmaking; energy and good humor may wane a bit during the last act, but the show-stopper “Mean Green Mother from Outer Space” and the cute denouement counteract any sensation of listlessness. Tessa Davies’ set decoration—clearly built on a soundstage, but still a lovingly-crafted recreation of Skid Row—and the design and puppetry of Audrey II (voiced by Four Tops singer, Stubbs) are all terrific. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s other wonderfully toe-tapping tunes include “Skid Row (Downtown),” “Dentist!” “Suddenly, Seymour,” and the title song. The “downbeat” original ending was re-shot after poor test screenings; it has since been restored on certain home video releases. Christopher Guest and Jim Belushi make brief appearances; opening narration by Stanley Jones.\n\n86/100\n\nMona Lisa (1986)\n\nDirected by Neil Jordan. Starring Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Caine, Zoë Nathenson, Kate Hardie, Clarke Peters, Rod Bedall. [R]\n\nHoskins, a recently-released ex-con on the lower rungs of the British underworld, is given the task of acting as chauffeur and bodyguard to a high-class call girl (Tyson), and their frictious relationship forms the basis—but not the point—of this offbeat, blackly comic crime picture. Lurid, seedy texture informs the dark desperation of these characters’ situations; the story and behavior consistently defies categorization even if its noir and exploitation elements are familiar. A few choice surprises keep things pleasantly off balance, while acute performances from Tyson (niece of Cicely) and vicious gang boss Caine are able to meet Hoskins’ astonishing challenge when he successfully crafts a believable contradiction: a volatile brute with a soft and decent heart. Title does not refer to a specific character, but is instead a reference to a key theme of men mythologizing unattainable women through sequestered imagination (the same-named song recorded by Nat ‘King’ Cole also bookends the story). Hoskins won Best Actor at Cannes, and from practically every other group except for AMPAS.\n\n86/100\n\nThe Fly (1986)\n\nDirected by David Cronenberg. Starring Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis, John Getz, Joy Boushel, Leslie Carlson. [R]\n\nImaginative and intense remake of the 50s science-fiction/horror story of a scientist who invents a machine that can teleport matter, but when he tests it on himself, a fly gets mixed up in the transfer, creating a monstrous man-fly hybrid. Exceptional use of gory makeup effects to show the slow, painstaking metamorphosis, plus good and gruesome scares of multiple varieties—queasy dread, cringes of disgust, jump shocks, etc. But what makes this one stand above not just Cronenberg’s other body horror efforts, but nearly all of the era’s other mainstream horror offerings as well, is the strength of Goldblum’s lead performance, always believable and sympathetic even when he begins vanishing beneath all the insectoid slop. Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg’s flawed script could have used another rewrite, though, particularly in the way Getz’s sleazy science journal editor is presented. Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis’ makeup work won them an Academy Award; Walas would go on to make his directorial debut with the 1989 sequel.\n\n83/100\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nDirected by John McNaughton. Starring Michael Rooker, Tom Towles, Tracy Arnold.\n\nChilling, deeply disagreeable glimpse into the world of a psychopathic mass murderer, played with vacant intensity by then-unknown Rooker. His Henry is a drifter who doesn’t appear to relish killing; he doesn’t do it as an unshakeable compulsion or a byproduct of rage, but simply because it’s something to do to fill the day. His “companions” include an ex-con gas station employee, Otis (Towles), who joins in on the killings, and Otis’ young sister (Arnold), who is intrigued and strangely attracted to the repulsive creature. Director/co-writer McNaughton makes no effort to play it as titillating exploitation, to probe the psychology and back story of its evil subject, or to provide any manner of catharsis to scene after scene of disquieting drama. It’s a raw, ugly, honest profile that horrifies in a way that conventional fright films would never dare attempt, and its visceral effect will no doubt turn off many viewers. The semi-notorious scene where they videotape the brutal massacre of a family that transitions to showing them casually watching the playback is truly unsettling. Debuted at a film festival in 1986, but didn’t get wider distribution until more than three years later later, primarily because of disagreements with the studio (which expected a more marketable slasher-type picture) and the MPAA (who was going to slap it with an X rating); it finally got an unrated, limited theatrical run in early 1990. Followed a decade later by a sequel, made without the participation of the principal cast and filmmakers.\n\n83/100\n\nAt Close Range (1986)\n\nDirected by James Foley. Starring Sean Penn, Christopher Walken, Mary Stuart Masterson, Chris Penn, Millie Perkins, Tracey Walter, R. D. Call, Crispin Glover, Eileen Ryan, Stephen Geoffreys, J. C. Quinn. [R]\n\nCold, ominous drama, made all the more unsettling by the knowledge it’s based in truth. Trapped in poverty with his mother and her loutish boyfriend, delinquent unemployed teen Penn turns to a life of crime with his no-good father (Walken) and the man’s gang of miscreants. The docudrama-style filmmaking only enhances the story’s disturbing credibility, although somewhere along the way in the final act, its bitter fatalism crosses the line into gratuitous nihilism before a course correction just before the final scene. Starkly photographed by Juan Ruiz Anchía, the viewer shares in the young protagonist’s excitement at running wild on the wrong side of the law and falling for a local girl (Masterson) and getting some money in his pocket for the first time, and then the wintry dread after the kid realizes he’s in too deep with scary criminal sociopaths. Penn is magnetic and tragic in a powerful performance, matched by Walken’s controlled hatefulness creating a vivid real-world monster. The song heard over the end credits (“Live to Tell”) is performed by Penn’s then-wife, Madonna. Eileen Ryan, who plays the grandmother of the characters played by Sean and Chris Penn, is the actors’ real-life mother. David Strathairn, Kiefer Sutherland, and Candy Clark have small roles.\n\n82/100\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective (1986)\n\nDirected by Ron Clements, Dave Michener, Burny Mattinson & John Musker. Starring (voices) Barrie Ingham, Vincent Price, Val Bettin, Susane Pollatschek, Alan Young, Candy Candido, Diana Chesney, Eve Brenner. [G]\n\nVery entertaining Disney adventure based on the children’s books, “Basil of Baker Street” (written by Eve Titus and illustrated by Paul Galdone), which was, of course, inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes series. After her toymaker father is kidnapped, a little mouse named Olivia turns to the great rodent sleuth, Basil of Baker Street, to solve the case. Following the trail of clues, Basil makes a startling discovery: the kidnapping was planned by none other than his nemesis, the criminal mastermind, Professor Ratigan. It’s ultimately a pretty flimsy scheme Ratigan is hatching, and there’s not much depth to the character relationships or their emotions, but it’s smart family entertainment—beautifully animated and directed, with the personalities of Basil and Ratigan popping off the screen (thanks in part to a delicious voice performance from Vincent Price as the dastardly foe), and there’s never a dull moment. Introductory scenes with Basil meeting Dr. Dawson, a clever Rube Goldberg machine-style trap, and a thrilling finale on either side of Big Ben’s clock face rank among the best moments. Re-released (for no apparent reason) in the early-90s as The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective. Voice samples of Basil Rathbone are used for Sherlock Holmes’ “cameo”.\n\n80/100\n\nThe Mosquito Coast (1986)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Starring Harrison Ford, River Phoenix, Helen Mirren, Conrad Roberts, Andre Gregory, Jadrien Steele, Martha Plimpton, Dick O’Neill. [PG]\n\nA stubborn, iconoclastic inventor (Ford) uproots his family for the jungles of Central America, moving them to a tiny remote village where he builds an “advanced” utopia and unleashes his God complex on both his kin and the locals. A mature and often compelling adaptation of Paul Theroux’s acclaimed novel, the film was widely misunderstood and dismissed when first released, resulting in a flop despite serving as a reunion between the director and star of Witness from the year before. Ford has rarely been better, even though his character’s mercurial, despotic nature makes him almost entirely unsympathetic, even detestable at times, but what a relief that the story didn’t try to manufacture a redemptive arc for him in the final act. The film’s limited field of vision restricts the thoughts and feelings of his family (aside from Phoenix’s intermittent narration) and muddies the motivations behind the father’s headstrong obsessions, but complex attributes don’t deserve simple answers, and Weir’s nuanced, humanist approach to the cold rigors and inevitable hubristic downfall is powerful stuff. Screenplay by Paul Schrader. Look for brief appearances from a young Jason Alexander and an elderly Butterfly McQueen (her final feature film).\n\n79/100\n\nLucas (1986)\n\nDirected by David Seltzer. Starring Corey Haim, Kerri Green, Charlie Sheen, Winona Ryder, Ciro Poppiti, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Guy Boyd, Tom Hodges, Garrett M. Brown, Jeremy Piven. [PG-13]\n\nSensitive, affecting teen drama of small, bespectacled nerd Lucas (Haim) who crushes hard on a new-to-town girl (Green) while befriending her over the summer, but when school resumes in the fall, his heart breaks as she drifts toward the “superficial” jocks-and-cheerleaders crowd (specifically, hunky football player Sheen). Cautiously-crafted sentimentalism that avoids almost all of the clichés of its type; it’s a bittersweet and painful journey—especially for anyone who ever felt like an outcast or had their romantic idealism crushed in their youth (so…everyone, right?)—front-loaded with sweetness and hope and shy embarrassment. The main characters are so likable (even Sheen, who could have easily been written as a shallow jerk, but is instead a pretty good guy) that the contrivances of the big football game scene can be overlooked. The ending, however (“slow clap” and all), is misjudged by a wide margin, as if imported from a different, lesser high school picture. Film debuts for Ryder and Piven (whose hairline was already receding, poor guy).\n\n78/100\n\nSomething Wild (1986)\n\nDirected by Jonathan Demme. Starring Jeff Daniels, Melanie Griffith, Ray Liotta, Jack Gilpin, Dana Preu, Margaret Colin. [R]\n\nA straight-laced yuppie (Daniels) feeds the stifled rebellion within him by trying to dine-and-dash, but he gets more than he bargained for when he follows an inscrutably free-spirited young woman (Griffith) on a petty-crime-and-motel-sex spree. Kinky screwball scenarios give way to more conventional danger and contrivances once Liotta shows up as her unstable ex-con husband, and handcuffs and company credit card purchases become the least of his problems. Quirky and stylish, Demme and the stars make the most out of E. Max Frye’s flawed script, providing off-kilter context to some flat passages of dialogue and assembly-line plotting in the final act. The three primary characters are cast to a T: Daniels as a wimpy everyman oddball, insecure and capable of surprises; Griffith as an unorthodox seductress who’s smarter than she appears to be at a glance; and Liotta in his first significant film role, an electrifying new talent who radiates menace (but in a way that makes you still want him to like you). The eclectic soundtrack selections (from Jimmy Cliff to New Order) are often excellent. The band playing the high school reunion (dubbed “The Willies”) is none other than post-punk heroes, the Feelies. Directors John Waters and John Sayles each cameo.\n\n76/100\n\nF/X (1986)\n\nDirected by Robert Mandel. Starring Bryan Brown, Brian Dennehy, Mason Adams, Cliff De Young, Martha Gehman, Joe Grifasi, Diane Venora, Jerry Orbach, Josie de Guzman, Trey Wilson, Roscoe Orman. [R]\n\nA special effects expert (Brown) in the movie business finds himself in grave danger after being hired by some shady men with the Justice Department to stage a bogus “hit” on a mob informant (Orbach), which, naturally, doesn’t go as he expected. Well-produced thriller contains some ingenious set pieces and timely injections of humor, especially in the form of Dennehy’s rugged panache while playing a homicide detective introduced in the second act. Confidently edited to keep the gears turning and the plot holes easy to overlook, and while there aren’t too many surprises, it’s a pleasure to watch the archetypal “wrongly-accused hero” gradually figure everything out and stay just one step ahead of his nefarious pursuers. Plus, it’s just plain fun to hear the down-homey voice for Smucker’s preserves commercials (“With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good”) come out of the mouth of the chief heavy. Angela Bassett and Tom Noonan make brief appearances, the former in her film debut. Followed by a sequel and a TV series.\n\n75/100\n\nManhunter (1986)\n\nDirected by Michael Mann. Starring William Petersen, Tom Noonan, Dennis Farina, Joan Allen, Brian Cox, Kim Greist, Stephen Lang, Michael Talbott. [R]\n\nRetired FBI profiler Petersen is lured back to the job to help with the investigation of a serial killer referred to as “The Tooth Fairy.” Stylish adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel “Red Dragon,” Mann brings his stagy detachment and hypnotic “Miami Vice” aesthetic to the project, transforming a cop-trying-to-think-like-a-criminal procedural into a sleek but unsettling thriller. Petersen can be stiff at times, and his scenes with his family ring all too familiar and artificial, but the technical presentation is consistently transfixing (the color schemes and use of music are particularly effective) and Noonan makes for a chilling psychopath. Originating the film role of Hannibal Lecter (spelled “Lecktor” here for no apparent reason), Cox is good but lacks the force-of-nature spookiness that Anthony Hopkins would bring to it a few years later in Silence of the Lambs; however, even with Hopkins later playing the part in the 2002 remake Red Dragon, this production is considerably better overall.\n\n75/100\n\nStand by Me (1986)\n\nDirected by Rob Reiner. Starring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O’Connell, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Richard Dreyfuss, Marshall Bell, Frances Lee McCain. [R]\n\nIt’s 1959 and four best friends on the cusp of adolescence embark on an expedition to the rumored location of the body of a missing boy, which becomes a journey of self-discovery and growth. Stephen King’s semi-autobiographical novella “The Body” serves as the basis of one of the better film adaptations of his writing; in the hands of director Rob Reiner and screenwriters Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, it’s unsubtle and oversincere and lacking in inspired cinematic qualities, but nevertheless features several sure-footed passages of warmth, humor, tension and poignancy. The oldies-saturated soundtrack (including the key title tune from Ben E. King) is as indebted to nostalgia as the aesthetics and attitudes—although the characters do sometimes exhibit more contemporary behavior through language—but as is often the case with nostalgia’s self-editing effect, there’s a faint veneer of artificiality to its episodic structure and kernels of truth. The young performers are all in fine form, with Dreyfuss showing up in framing sequences as a writer narrating the tale from the present day via his memoir. John Cusack makes a brief appearance in a flashback.\n\n75/100\n\n52 Pick-Up (1986)\n\nDirected by John Frankenheimer. Starring Roy Scheider, John Glover, Ann-Margret, Robert Trebor, Clarence Williams III, Vanity, Lonny Chapman, William John Murphy, Doug McClure, Kelly Preston. [R]\n\nUndervalued thriller—from producers Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, no less!—is a mean, sleazy piece of work based on a same-named pulp novel by Elmore Leonard. Scheider, a very successful businessman and unfaithful husband, is blackmailed by a trio of slimy thugs into paying them to keep his infidelities under wraps, but when Scheider decides to come clean to wife Ann-Margret instead of paying out, the crooks get deadly serious. Frankenheimer brings a rough punch to the lurid depravity; credibility and tastefulness may suffer, but Scheider does well masking his anxiety with confidence—he’s a protagonist to be identified with, but not a hero. This one belongs to the heavies, however, and Glover is a fabulously vicious villain, one who revels in his own amorality and “falls behind” often enough to give credence to his cornered-prey desperation. Leonard co-scripted with John Steppling; his story had previously served as the loose basis for the 1984 thriller, The Ambassador.\n\n73/100\n\nThe Color of Money (1986)\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese. Starring Paul Newman, Tom Cruise, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Helen Shaver, John Turturro, Forest Whitaker, Bill Cobbs, Keith McReady. [R]\n\nTwenty-five years after The Hustler, “Fast Eddie” Felson is back—he hasn’t picked up in the stick in a long time, but he’s been doing fine for himself selling liquor and staking bets for skilled players. He takes it even further when he encounters a flaky fireball of a young talent in Cruise (along with the kid’s smarter, more level-headed girlfriend played by Mastrantonio), and decides to show him the ropes by hustling on the road on the way to an Atlantic City tournament. A commercial, impersonal effort from Scorsese, but there’s no faulting his commitment to energetic and stylish direction, aided tremendously by Michael Ballhaus’ extravagant camerawork. The cool-headed-mentor-and-brash-student story has been repurposed enough times by now, but it’s still told in an engaging enough fashion here to brush off a lot of the clichéd narrative signposts that the script follows, especially with the main cast being as good as it is; though less trite than the mentorship and big competition angles, a sub-plot involving Felson’s relationship with bartender Shaver is too underwritten to leave much of an impact. Newman won a long overdue Academy Award for the role reprisal, but it’s essentially just a nicely understated movie star performance where he proves that he’s very comfortable inside his own skin and skills. Iggy Pop appears briefly as one of Cruise’s opponents.\n\n71/100\n\nBack to School (1986)\n\nDirected by Alan Metter. Starring Rodney Dangerfield, Keith Gordon, Sally Kellerman, Paxton Whitehead, Burt Young, Terry Farrell, Robert Downey Jr., Ned Beatty, William Zabka, M. Emmet Walsh, Adrienne Barbeau, Sam Kinison. [R]\n\nGood star vehicle for Dangerfield casts him as a rich, loud-mouthed slob who’s somehow likable. He built his big-and-tall store empire not with a diploma, but through gumption, corner-cutting, and street smarts, and when his collegiate son (Gordon) points this out as an excuse for why he plans to drop out, dad decides to enroll alongside the boy to get a “proper” education. A fairly steady stream of funny jokes and one-liners make up for the formulaic and far-fetched nature of the script—not only is he able to charm the pants off a literate professor (Kellerman), but he can also pull off an impossible championship dive from three different boards despite having a body “you could donate to science fiction.” Is it refreshing that the protagonist never really changes his tune when it comes to not caring about his studies, or is it a sign of laziness? Eh, who cares? Not when Kurt Vonnegut shows up in a cameo, hired by Dangerfield to write a paper on his own book. Rock band Oingo Boingo also appears, performing at one of those campus ragers you only find in the movies.\n\n70/100\n\nWhen the Wind Blows (1986)\n\nDirected by Jimmy T. Murakami. Starring (voices) John Mills, Peggy Ashcroft.\n\nThe fallout of an ICBM strike and the subsequent nuclear winter as seen through the eyes of Jim and Hilda Bloggs, a gentle elderly couple in rural England. After the bomb hits and the Bloggses survive, some mixture of delusion and obliviousness causes them to behave as a sensible, old-fashioned sort, reassuring each other that things will be better once they get through this, even as their bodies start breaking down from radiation exposure. Complacency in the face of unspeakable horror is an unsubtle tactic, of course, and that level of naïvety pushes the experience more towards the allegorical than the realistic, although there’s no sugar-coating the devastation they both witness and experience. It took time for me to warm up to the unusual animation style, which sticks flat characters in three-dimensional spaces as photographed in miniature sets, but what I initially disliked about the Bloggses round, simple faces turned out to be a case of presenting nearly blank canvases upon which we can gradually see the nauseating effects of the radiation poisoning as hair falls out, puffy shadows appear around the eyes and cheekbones, and the roundness starts cratering in. Screenwriter Raymond Briggs adapted his own graphic novel. Music by Roger Waters, fronting the Bleeding Heart Band, and David Bowie contributed a song heard at the beginning, which shares a name with the movie’s title.\n\n70/100\n\nDown by Law (1986)\n\nDirected by Jim Jarmusch. Starring John Lurie, Tom Waits, Roberto Benigni, Nicolette Braschi, Ellen Barkin. [R]\n\nThree strangers—a pimp (Lurie), a disc jockey (Waits), and an Italian tourist (Benigni)—are arrested in New Orleans and end up sharing a cell together before breaking out into the Louisiana bayou. Another trio of misfits embarking on a strange odyssey together from writer/director Jim Jarmusch; it’s not as consistent as his earlier Stranger Than Paradise, but it possesses some of the same offbeat charm and meandering post-modernism. Jarmusch’s passive, elongated minimalism ambles at such a leisurely pace during the first forty-five minutes, conversations with anyone (even bit-part strangers) cut through the dark like a lighthouse warning. Its vivacious charge is found right at the very beginning with a brash tantrum from Ellen Barkin in her only scene, and later when Roberto Benigni enters the fray, which is a mixed blessing because, well, it’s Roberto Benigni. Robby Müller’s evocative and grungy black & white photography produces some arresting montages (one set to Waits’ “junkyard orchestra” classic, “Jockey Full of Bourbon”). As in Paradise, Lurie also composed the music.\n\n69/100\n\nRunning Scared (1986)\n\nDirected by Peter Hyams. Starring Billy Crystal, Gregory Hines, Darlanne Fluegel, Joe Pantoliano, Dan Hedaya, Steven Bauer, Jon Gries, Jimmy Smits, Tracy Reed, Larry Hankin. [R]\n\nChicago cops Crystal and Hines would much rather be running a bar in Key West than getting killed in the line of duty, but they feel obligated to bust scummy drug dealer Smits first. Buddy cop pic offers a smooth blend of wisecracks and violence; the leads achieve an easy rapport, and some scenes rise above the sub-genre routine, including a juggling act charade involving Crystal’s amiable ex-wife, a lawyer, and the ladies’ room, as well as a car chase that ends up on the “El” tracks. Too formulaic, however, to leave much of an impact, with a cut-and-dried baddie and a climax that could have been lifted out of a hundred cop thrillers before it (any chance that the ex-wife won’t be kidnapped?). Location shooting is a plus, even though that snow is quite clearly fake. For fans of unintentional homoeroticism, check out the fashion statement they make down in Florida.\n\n69/100\n\nRuthless People (1986)\n\nDirected by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker. Starring Danny DeVito, Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater, Bette Midler, Anita Morris, Bill Pullman, Art Evans, Clarence Felder, William G. Schilling, J. E. Freeman. [R]\n\nA pair of bumbling amateurs kidnap the millionaire “Spandex Mini-Skirt King”’s (Devito) shrill harpy of a wife (Midler), but he was planning on bumping her off anyway, so it’s working out just fine…even though his mistress (Morris) and her lover (Pullman) are trying to blackmail him at the same time. Fitfully humorous farce probably should have been called Stupid People since—aside from DeVito’s inspired venality—these people are even dumber than they are morally bankrupt or cold-hearted. Nevertheless, the misanthrope at the center is such a cruel delight, and the rest of cast acquits themselves well enough to forgive the film’s come-and-go momentum and uneven scripting (the farcical inventions are better overall than the dialogue and payoffs). Pullman’s film debut.\n\n68/100\n\nSid and Nancy (1986)\n\nDirected by Alex Cox. Starring Gary Oldman, Chloe Webb, Andrew Schofield, David Hayman, Perry Benson, Tony London, Debby Bishop, Xander Berkeley. [R]\n\nAs junkie UK punk rocker Sid Vicious and his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen, Oldman and Webb inhabit the roles so thoroughly that it feels less like acting than possession. The film, which follows them from just before their first meeting, through his introduction to heroin and the dissolution of his band to her futile efforts to manage his strung-out solo career and her (intentional or accidental?) murder by his hands, attempts an observational snapshot approach that doesn’t always connect the dots or provide basic information for the uninitiated—for instance, will anyone unfamiliar with the Sex Pistols and the London/New York punk scene even understand who Malcolm McLaren (Hayman) was? It’s a downer at length, and there’s too little expression of what made the oft-loathsome and barely-competent bassist/singer a fascinating scene fixation (or worth documenting in the first place), but even though the writing is confused and relentlessly “of a piece,” Cox’s energetic direction, Roger Deakins’ confidential and color-drained camera approach, and the lead performances make it drearily compelling all the same. A young and then-unknown Courtney Love appears in a few brief scenes as one of Nancy’s friends.\n\n68/100\n\nCrocodile Dundee (1986)\n\nDirected by Peter Faiman. Starring Paul Hogan, Linda Kozlowski, John Meillon, Mark Blum, Michael Lombard, Reginald Vel Johnson, David Gulpilil, Rik Colitti, Gerry Skilton, Steve Rackman, Terry Gill. [PG-13]\n\nFish-out-of-water comedy about a New York reporter (Koslowski) traveling to the Australian Outback for a story about a bushman, Mick Dundee (Hogan), who survived a grisly crocodile attack; later, she takes him back with her to visit the Big Apple (where he becomes the “fish” instead). Crowd-pleasing fluff was a runaway box office hit, and has an easy-going charm to it even during the dry spots and when it gets aggressively corny (the ending generates smiles and groans in equal measure). Hogan’s amiable charisma carries the day, strutting his stuff on his home turf and then getting into a series of skewed, tongue-in-cheek encounters in NYC with pimps, muggers, transvestites, coke-heads and the like. As Dundee’s business partner, Meillon exhibits a wry but genteel appeal as well. Surprisingly, although they would eventually marry in real life, the stars only have minimal romantic chemistry together. Peter Best provides the fine music score. The American release initially inserted quotation marks around the word “crocodile” in the title to make sure audiences knew it wasn’t about an actual reptile(!); to be fair, with his flashing teeth and leathery skin, it’s not too hard to mistake Hogan for a saltwater snapper.\n\n67/100\n\nSalvador (1986)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone. Starring James Woods, Jim Belushi, John Savage, Elpidia Carrillo, Michael Murphy, Cindy Gibb, Tony Plana, Will MacMillan, Juan Fernández, José Carlos Ruiz, Valerie Wildman, Colby Chester. [R]\n\nCynical American photojournalist Woods and his unemployed pal (Belushi) head for Central America—the former to try and find some freelance work, the latter to carouse his way through loads of cheap booze and loose women—but simmering political tensions explode into a full-blown revolution upon their arrival, throwing their lives into chaos. The Salvadoran Civil War initially serves as a backdrop to personal issues, but then the fascinating character study that filled out the first half gives way to a more familiar political allegory, right up to the heavy-handed epilogue. That duality extends to Oliver Stone’s direction, which lurches back and forth between a quick, in-your-face style and the static compositions of a neutral observer. Contains accomplished production values and the usual emotional crescendos, but the subject matter had become pretty familiar territory by the time of its release (preceded by several other “white news media ‘heroes’ in a volatile foreign land” pictures—The Year of Living Dangerously, Under Fire, The Killing Fields, etc.); it’s not that he’s too late to the party—his tremendous Platoon from later that same year was hardly the first Vietnam War drama—but that he doesn’t bring enough to the scenario that couldn’t have been done just as well by Costa-Gavras or TIMEmagazine. Those early segments, however, are engrossing in fits and starts, primarily because of Woods, whose glib and weaselly con artist role is almost perfectly tailored for him (earning him his first Oscar nomination). The title references both the country of El Salvador and the Spanish word for “savior.”\n\n67/100\n\nDesert Hearts (1986)\n\nDirected by Donna Deitch. Starring Helen Shaver, Patricia Charbonneau, Audra Lindley, Andra Akers, Dean Butler, James Staley, Gwen Welles, Katie La Bourdette, Alex MacArthur. [R]\n\nReserved, apprehensive English professor Shaver arrives in Reno for a short-term residency in order to get a clean, quick divorce, and meets the more adventurous and free-spirited casino worker Charbonneau, a gay woman who’s uninhibited about her sexuality at a time when such status was widely viewed with disapproval. The first of only two feature films that director Deitch ever made, and it helped bring lesbianism into the mainstream through sophisticated and direct terms. The pattern of seduction/resistance/surrender is recognizable, even universal, and no effort is made to stylize or exploit or render it as a gimmick; a shortage of character detail and the rigidity in arriving at the necessary story turns and interactions, however, makes it seem all too connect-the-dots conventional and visually featureless by today’s standards. As a tasteful if shallow exploration of erotic awakening against spiteful social prejudice, it fits the bill, and being a low-key groundbreaker for lesbian cinema has to count for something. Played at some film festivals in 1985 before getting released the following year.\n\n66/100\n\nFlight of the Navigator (1986)\n\nDirected by Randal Kleiser. Starring Joey Cramer, Cliff DeYoung, Veronica Cartwright, Howard Hesseman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matt Adler, Jonathan Sanger, Albie Whitaker, (voice) Paul Reubens. [PG]\n\nA suburban youth (Cramer) in 1978 Florida takes a bad fall in the woods. When he regains consciousness, eight years have passed, but while his family members have dutifully aged during the interim, he’s the same age—a “victim” of time dilation and an experiment administered by an alien spacecraft’s artificial intelligence, now being kept at a NASA research facility. Think the kid and the spaceship are going to reunite and go on a wild adventure together? Pretty good junior sci-fi flick starts out as an engaging mystery within familiar trappings and character types—had it not been made by Walt Disney Pictures, I would have expected Steven Spielberg’s name to be attached as an executive producer—and later turns into a less-successful kid’s space-age fantasy. The problem with that second half, aside from being oriented too much toward immature shenanigans, is that there’s no real dramatic build-up, and all of the excitement comes courtesy of the hardware, not a sense of danger or discovery. Alan Silvestri’s electronic score and the sleek digital effects are pluses, but the young protagonist is little more than a clone of Henry Thomas’ Elliott from E.T. The ship’s computer, called “Max”, is voiced by Paul “Pee-wee Herman” Reubens, but he went credited as “Paul Mall”; you’d never have guessed the true identity…until the point where Max’s “personality” changes and guessing is no longer necessary.\n\n66/100\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married (1986)\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola. Starring Kathleen Turner, Nicolas Cage, Kevin J. O’Connor, Barry Miller, Catherine Hicks, Lisa Jane Persky, Don Murray, Jim Carrey, Barbara Harris, Joan Allen, Lucinda Jenney, Wil Shriner, Helen Hunt. [PG-13]\n\nTurner’s remarkable (and remarkably subtle) performance is the reason to see this wistful, nostalgic venture into a middle-aged woman’s past. She’s Peggy, and she’s in her forties and attending her 25-year high school reunion when she becomes overwhelmed with the gravity of her life choices (including a failed marriage to high school sweetheart Cage) and faints, only to wake up in the body of her 17-year-old self way back in 1960. Not to be confused with a reverse-Back to the Future dilemma—for one, this project is more philosophical and far less clever and exciting—it’s a filmgoing experience marked with strong emotional discoveries and overemphasized sentimentality, where it has a warm feel and transient delights but a confused prevailing attitude and a sluggish tempo where rheumy reflections replace the great insight that viewers ought to be craving. Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner’s screenplay becomes distracted by the apparatus of its time travel plot device when it would have been better to just treat the situation as pure dream-like fantasy, but at least they’re capable of temporarily fooling the audience into overlooking the foregone conclusion. While Turner is terrific, her frequent scene partner isn’t, and it must have been difficult to play opposite Cage’s off-putting nasal delivery and sketchy upheavals (he has an emotional breakdown that echoes of Eric Roberts from Pope of Greenwich Village). John Carradine has a small role in his final legitimate film appearance.\n\n66/100\n\nHoosiers (1986)\n\nDirected by David Anspaugh. Starring Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, Dennis Hopper, Sheb Wooley, David Neidorf, Chelcie Ross, Fern Persons, Maris Valainis, Wade Schenk. [PG]\n\nFeel-good small-town sports drama brings Hackman’s disgraced college basketball coach to a rural Indiana high school in 1951 to take charge of the unexceptional and undermanned team (and also do a little teaching, but the movie never bothers to show him inside a classroom). Hackman is rock solid as usual, and Hopper makes a good impression as an alcoholic who’s given a second chance by becoming an assistant coach—it’s easy to forget that Hopper’s Supporting Actor Oscar nomination was for this film instead of his unforgettable portrayal in Blue Velvet that same year—but, really, all of the performances are fine, and director Anspaugh exhibits refreshing restraint in several scenes, allowing the wistful, dawdling atmosphere to overcome the farm community clichés. Yet there are repeated continuity lapses, and even if you give in to the inspirational underdog hook, far too many plot developments and character decisions all but materialize out of thin air because the formula requires them to happen, and the movie doesn’t do the necessary legwork. Pretty good for its type…a type that happens to be in the “all feeling, no thought” category, which is clearly enough for many moviegoers considering the movie’s celebrated reputation among sports genre fans. Inspired in part by a tiny high school in Indiana (Milan High School) that won the state championship in the 1950s. Released as Best Shot in most international markets because the word “Hoosier” is largely meaningless outside the U.S.\n\n65/100\n\nLabyrinth (1986)\n\nDirected by Jim Henson. Starring Jennifer Connelly, David Bowie, (voices) Brian Henson, David Shaughnessy, Ron Mueck, Denise Bryer. [PG]\n\nYoung suburban dreamer Connelly wishes that goblins would come and take away her crying baby brother…so they do, and after immediately lamenting that wish, she’s given thirteen hours by the Goblin King (Bowie) to negotiate his labyrinth and rescue the child in the castle at the center of it. Along the way, she collects odd companions, Wizard of Oz-style (a grumpy dwarf, a big hairy beast, a diminutive fox-terrier knight atop a canine steed), but they may not be enough to help her since the Goblin King doesn’t like to play fair. Second cinematic collaboration between Jim Henson and Brian Froud (after The Dark Crystal) is another successful marriage of Froud’s otherworldly concepts with Henson’s Creature Shop creations, even if they have to contend with a weak, all-too-familiar storyline. It’s like “Alice in Wonderland” with more goblins, less linguistic wit, and a teenage girl’s sexual awakening in the bargain—it’s David Bowie, after all, so it probably would have worked on a teenage boy, too. Contains some creative ideas, nifty design elements, and first-rate puppetry/makeup effects, but after a rushed start, the pace has a tendency to drag inside the maze, and the movie runs on fumes for much of the second half. Bowie doesn’t have much to do but cut a striking figure (teased Tina Turner-esque hair and all) and sing some songs; Connelly is cute but anemic, a victim of a script that doesn’t give her anything all that interesting to say, especially when talking to herself in the first third. Screenplay credited to Monty Python-alum, Terry Jones; executive produced by George Lucas.\n\n65/100\n\nChildren of a Lesser God (1986)\n\nDirected by Randa Haines. Starring William Hurt, Marlee Matlin, Philip Bosco, Piper Laurie, Allison Gompf, Philip Holmes, John F. Cleary, William D. Byrd, Georgia Ann Cline, Frank Carter Jr. [R]\n\nHurt plays a newly-hired teacher at a school for the deaf and hard of hearing, drawn to a stubborn young deaf woman (Matlin) who attended the school some years earlier and now works there as a janitor. The particulars of their attraction and friction (potentially mirrored by the troubled real-life relationship the two actors shared) is the selling point for this watchable but not always satisfying social drama based on the Tony Award-winning play by Mark Medoff. The love story has a good hook to it—the teacher wants her to use her voice to fit in with the hearing world, but she argues that he should accept her on her own terms and, to quote Martin Gore, enjoy the silence—and since it’s their story far more than the story of a teacher helping a classroom of kids, that’s good enough, I suppose. But the “deaf angle” is dealt with at the level of obstacle, and could have easily been swapped out for any other condition or syndrome of the differently-abled (Children of the Loosely Boweled, however, may not sell many tickets). Also, whenever anyone uses ASL in Hurt’s presence, including Hurt himself, he speaks the words simultaneously, robbing hearing viewers of an opportunity to temporarily enter their world; not even the crutch of subtitles is ever bothered with. In her first film role, Matlin earned an Academy Award.\n\n63/100\n\nFrom Beyond (1986)\n\nDirected by Stuart Gordon. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Ken Foree, Ted Sorel, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, Bruce McGuire, Bunny Summers. [R]\n\nSeveral folks from the Re-Animator team (including actors Combs and Crampton) reunited for another gruesome descent into the macabre mind of H. P. Lovecraft; this effort can’t match the near-greatness of director/co-writer Gordon’s debut picture, but should satisfy fans of body horror, splatter, and plunges into the netherworld. Mad scientist Dr. Pretorius (Sorel) has built a machine called the Resonator, which allows those within its field of effect to glimpse into heightened dimensions of reality, leading to monstrous results (giant worm monsters in the basement, engorged pineal glands at the end of phallic stalks emerging from the forehead, ravenous insectoid swarms, kinky S&M play, that sort of thing). The actors are game, the makeup effects are grotesquely effective, the tongue is firmly in cheek, but it takes too long to get going and never generates much momentum while ricocheting between its handful of bonkers slime set pieces. Onscreen title: H. P. Lovecraft’s From Beyond.\n\n62/100\n\nNobody’s Fool (1986)\n\nDirected by Evelyn Purcell. Starring Rosanna Arquette, Eric Roberts, Jim Youngs, Mare Winningham, Louise Fletcher, Stephen Tobolowsky, Gwen Welles, Charlie Barnett, J. J. Hardy. [PG-13]\n\nRough-around-the-edges romantic seriocomedy about a miserable, traumatized young woman (Arquette) at the end of her proverbial rope who may get one of those much-storied “second chance[s] at love” with a seemingly sweet but shy and troubled stage technician (Roberts) for a traveling theater troupe. Moves in fits and starts, offering disconnected moments of charm, humor, and/or depth here and there, but the rickety story structure doesn’t help hold together a narrative that commendably doesn’t adhere to pure formula. Arquette and Roberts offer quirky, winning performances individually, but there’s almost no heat or excitement between them, leading the viewer to wish them well…but not necessarily with a “happy ending” where they end up together. Written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Beth Henley.\n\n62/100\n\nArmour of God (1986)\n\nDirected by Jackie Chan. Starring Jackie Chan, Alan Tam, Lola Forner, Rosamund Kwan, Ken Boyle, Božidar Smiljanić.\n\nHe’s part Indiana Jones, part James Bond (the gadgets part, at least), part typically earnest and athletic Jackie Chan hero role, and he’s racing against a nefarious cult for possession of multiple pieces of armor because of…reasons. Good fight scenes in the final act, including a throwdown between Jackie and a quartet of lethal leather-clad ladies, but the vague hogwash plot and juvenile dialogue (badly dubbed, of course) make most of the down-time stretches snoozers. The editing may not favor coherency, but there are more than enough exciting camera shots and crazy stunts in a car-and-motorcycles chase to make it the standout sequence by a long shot. Light, disposable entertainment, but intermittent good fun in the moment. Pity the final stunt is so clearly faked, but stick around through the credits to see an outtake of the fairly routine stunt that came closer to killing the real-life action star than any other in his long career. Followed by a sequel, Armour of God II: Operation Condor, but beware the U.S. import title for this one since it makes the original sound like a sequel: Operation Condor 2: Armor of the Gods.\n\n61/100\n\nPretty in Pink (1986)\n\nDirected by Howard Deutch. Starring Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, Andrew McCarthy, James Spader, Harry Dean Stanton, Annie Potts, Kate Vernon, Margaret Colin. [PG-13]\n\nNo real twist to the tired (but reliable) “wrong side of the tracks” teen drama. Ringwald lives in poverty with her often unemployed father (a surprisingly softhearted Stanton), but she catches the eye of preppy rich kid McCarthy, who brings her into his world even though it’s an uncomfortable fit; meanwhile, her best friend Duckie (Cryer) is hopelessly infatuated with her, but the feelings aren’t reciprocated. Ringwald’s so appealing that she practically glows, but the material she has to work with is spotty, and too many scenes with the spoiled kids have been done to death. Cryer has a few isolated moments, like an energetic lip sync of Otis Redding’s “Try a Little Tenderness,” but he mostly just comes off as grating and even a little creepy. Spader (as the kind of well-groomed snake he specializes in) and Potts (as a slightly kooky record shop manager) do solid supporting work. The film famously underwent reshoots to change the ending (and the identity of the boy Ringwald ends up with) because of negative test screenings, but frankly, she would have been better off ditching both and finding happiness elsewhere. The musical moments are where this film shines brightest, with a fine soundtrack that includes not just the Redding evergreen, but also New Order, Suzanne Vega, the Smiths, the Association, the Psychedelic Furs’ title tune (originally released a few years prior), and OMD’s (Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Dark) wonderful “If You Leave.”\n\n61/100\n\nNight of the Creeps (1986)\n\nDirected by Fred Dekker. Starring Jason Lively, Tom Atkins, Steve Marshall, Jill Whitlow, Allan Kayser, David Oliver, David Paymer, Wally Taylor, Bruce Solomon, Alice Cadogan, Ken Heron. [R]\n\nDekker’s first feature film is proud of its B-movie approach, and even knowingly trots out a few dozen clichés, but they’re done in such a straight-faced fashion with no effort to supplant, surprise or lampoon that they don’t garner the delight that they should. Body-altering/possessing slugs from outer space arrive on Earth, wreak havoc during university pledge week. Opening and closing segments work best—“Duck! It’s Miller Time!”—but more imaginative direction and better pacing could have made this one an underground classic (it does have a cult following). Atkins scores as a no-nonsense detective with a grudge against the slippery beasts; he keeps saying, “Thrill me,” like he expects the greeting to catch on, and maybe it would have if his request was answered more often. Dick Miller shows up for a cameo because he’s Dick Miller. Many of the characters’ last names are those of well-known horror directors (Carpenter, Romero, Cronenberg, Raimi, etc.). Some releases feature an alternate ending.\n\n60/100\n\nThe Name of the Rose (1986)\n\nDirected by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Starring Sean Connery, Christian Slater, F. Murray Abraham, Ron Perlman, Michel Lonsdale, Helmut Qualtinger, Elya Baskin, William Hickey, Volker Prechtel, Valentina Vargas. [R]\n\nConnery plays a scholarly 14th-century monk who arrives at a gloomy, labyrinthine monastery to investigate a mysterious death (accident, murder or suicide?)—think: Sherlock Holmes in Franciscan robes—and sticks around after additional, unexplainable murders take place. Adapted from Umberto Eco’s popular debut novel, the mystery and its connections to heretical notions and interference from the Inquisition are uninvolving and sometimes hard to follow (the monks and their names do run together). The production design, gloomy atmosphere, attention to accurate historical detail, and frisky lead performance from Connery are enough to maintain interest, although the protagonist’s sidekick, a novice played by Christian Slater, is an open-faced pushover (more like Robin than Dr. Watson), and some bits are downright silly, like the novice’s abrupt “entry to manhood” and a happy ending that can’t be believed. Several individuals received screenwriting credit, including Gérard Brach and Howard Franklin. Music by James Horner.\n\n59/100\n\nWise Guys (1986)\n\nDirected by Brian De Palma. Starring Danny DeVito, Joe Piscopo, Lou Albano, Dan Hedaya, Harvey Keitel, Julie Bovasso, Patti Lupone, Antonia Rey, Ray Sharkey, Matthew Kaye. [R]\n\nSlapstick change of pace for De Palma is far closer to his anarchic comic roots than any of the Hitchcockian psychosexual thrillers he’s staked his career on. DeVito and Piscopo are a couple of low-rent errand boys for the Newark Mob (laughing stock, quite frankly), and when they screw up placing a hefty bet at the racetrack for their boss, each of them are separately given an important assignment: whack the other one. The premise isn’t milked for what it’s worth—just as well, probably, since Prizzi’s Honor was still fresh in moviegoers’ minds—and the loud antics are played at the sort of fever pitch that will either inspire laughter or exhaustion. The leads pull off a second-rate Laurel and Hardy approximation, but Piscopo is adrift tackling a dullard while DeVito preens with a swollen head. Sure, he’s funny, and so is ex-wrestler Albano as an overboiled psychopath, but the episodes galumph along with little rhyme or reason, and the conflict is resolved with a whimper instead of a bang (ironic, considering what actually happens). De Palma’s shrewdly skittish direction helps smooth out the wrinkles of George Gallo and Norman Steinberg’s script. Ira Newborn provides the (intentionally?) chintzy score.\n\n58/100\n\nThe Karate Kid Part II (1986)\n\nDirected by John G. Avildsen. Starring Ralph Macchio, Noriyuki “Pat” Morita, Tamlyn Tomita, Yuji Okumoto, Danny Kamekona, Nobu McCarthy, Martin Kove. [PG]\n\nInevitable sequel to the sleeper smash hit alters the setting and drops the martial arts tournament clichés, but fails to expand the characterizations or provide the leads with anything better than formula stakes and conflict. Upon notice that his father is dying, Mr. Miyagi returns to his small village on Okinawa Island, which rekindles a rivalry with friend-turned-archenemy Kamekona. As for Daniel-san, he accompanies his friend/mentor on the trip (his mom doesn’t seem to care since she’s moving to Fresno without him, perhaps so she can collect her Mother of the Year award), and earnestly collects a new bully (Okumoto) and a new love interest (Tomita). It’s all very by-the-numbers and contrived, but Macchio and Morita are still an engaging pair onscreen, and the filmmakers know how to push buttons against better judgment. One character’s complete about-face in the third act is hard to swallow, however, and there’s nothing here to compete with the semi-iconic “wax on, wax off” and crane-stance bits from the original—not only is there a shortage of actual karate training/fighting, but this episode’s new-fangled “drum technique” business is barely explored and, thanks to the closeup camerawork, doesn’t even get employed satisfactorily in the final showdown! Look for BD Wong in a bit part.\n\n56/100\n\nHeartbreak Ridge (1986)\n\nDirected by Clint Eastwood. Starring Clint Eastwood, Mario Van Peebles, Marsha Mason, Everett McGill, Moses Gunn, Arlen Dean Snyder, Boyd Gaines, Bo Svenson, Mark Mattingly, Vincent Irizarry, Ramón Franco, Mike Gomez, Peter Koch, Tom Villard, Richard Venture. [R]\n\nGrizzled, gravel-voiced Marine vet Eastwood gets transferred back to his old military unit, whips a platoon of insolent slackers into shape, reconciles with his ex-wife (Mason) working as a waitress at a nearby bar. B-movie material given A-movie treatment; the script is still a pile of clichés and stock characters, but has plenty of choice one-liners and Eastwood’s impregnable squinting glower. The scenes with Mason slow things down instead of provide relief from the standard-issue service drama plot—this overlong film would have benefited from tighter, more merciless editing—and it’s hard to get worked up for the climactic scenes where the boys go off to battle considering that it’s the Invasion of Grenada that the filmmakers are recreating (heck, they may have been better off “inventing” a nondescript conflict like Top Gun did earlier that year). Less of Van Peebles’ fast-talking wannabe rock star would have also helped. The only one of Eastwood’s many war films where he both starred and directed.\n\n55/100\n\nAbout Last Night (1986)\n\nDirected by Edward Zwick. Starring Rob Lowe, Jim Belushi, Demi Moore, Elizabeth Perkins, George DiCenzo, Robin Thomas, Michael Alldredge, Robert Neches. [R]\n\nWatered-down adaptation of David Mamet play, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, looks at a pair of Chicago yuppies (Lowe, Moore) who turn their back on the singles scene by moving in together and giving the whole “committed relationship” thing a try…it is not smooth sailing. Belushi and Perkins are their envious and obnoxious best pals, but even though they can be as much of caricatures as the main couple, at least they’re more interesting. The acting is better than one is likely to assume (including from two Brat-Packers fresh off the deplorable St. Elmo’s Fire), and there are a few original and perceptive moments, but it’s little more than a string of blackout episodes, and what may have been fresh in the 70s was probably old hat a decade later, and is certainly a lot of been-there-done-that today. The authentically cynical bite is softened by the hopeful conclusion, and before anyone can get so far as that, one must first sit through too many montages set to pop-rock drivel (the music throughout is quite bad, including Miles Goodman’s soft-jazz score), too many variations of the same basic argument, and too many love scene fragments, regardless of how attractive Lowe and Moore are without their clothes on. Scripted by Denise DeClue and Tim Kazurinsky, the latter of which appears briefly as a dorky date; Megan Mullally and Catherine Keener make brief appearances in early roles. Zwick’s feature film directorial debut. Remade in 2014.\n\n51/100\n\nNo Mercy (1986)\n\nDirected by Richard Pearce. Starring Richard Gere, Kim Basinger, Jeroen Krabbé, George Dzundza, William Atheron, Gary Basaraba, Terry Kinney, Bruce McGill, Ray Sharkey, Ely Puget\n\nMarginal action-thriller with a mean streak and a sultry attitude, but the story is formulaic and the execution is routine. Gere plays a tough Chicago cop out for revenge in New Orleans against the vicious gangster (Krabbé) who murdered his partner, and he’s more than willing to use the killer’s mistress (Basinger) to get what he wants. Never quite dull despite the familiar trappings, but it’s nothing special either, especially when it comes to the factory-grade 80s action scenes and some curious casting choices—would you believe Kim Basinger as a Cajun prostitute-slave with a deeply troubled past? If you’re looking for corruption, sin and sex down Louisiana way, stick with The Big Easy from the following year. Charles S. Dutton appears briefly in one of his earliest film roles.\n\n50/100\n\nTop Gun (1986)\n\nDirected by Tony Scott. Starring Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Rick Rossovich, James Tolkan, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, John Stockwell. [PG]\n\nCruise’s reckless but skilled hotshot Navy pilot (call sign: Maverick) is sent to Miramar to attend Naval Fighter Weapons School (a.k.a., “Top Gun”) where he competes to become the best of the best while romancing one of his instructors (McGillis). This slick but soulless Hollywood product delivers as advertised—gleaming visuals, macho posturing, cheesy rock soundtrack, dynamite aerial combat sequences, and the sort of unabashed right-wing militarism that’s even more dangerous than its protagonist—but if approached solely with an arsenal of “never-minds” directed at its rampant clichés and sordid political content, it’s tacky fun. Still, even those willing to fully disengage the critical-thinking portion of their brains will still have to deal with a ridiculous love story low on chemistry, high on silhouetted tongue-play, and the sort of simplistic character dynamics and dialogue that would have felt hoary even in the flyboy pictures of the 1920s and 30s. The comic relief provided by Maverick’s best friend and RIO cohort, Goose (Edwards), helps smooth out some of those embarrassing wrinkles, at least. The kind of movie with enough now-iconic elements to trick most moviegoers into thinking it’s a so-called “classic”, but remember: it is possible to use lighting and airbrushing to make a lump of coal look quite appealing. Oscar winner for Best Original Song: “Take My Breath Away” by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock, performed by synth-pop/new wave band Berlin. Followed more than thirty-five years later by a sequel (“legacyquel”), Top Gun: Maverick.\n\n50/100\n\nApril Fool’s Day (1986)\n\nDirected by Fred Walton. Starring Deborah Foreman, Amy Steel, Ken Olandt, Jay Baker, Deborah Goodrich, Clayton Rohner, Thomas F. Wilson, Leah Pinsent, Griffin O’Neal, Mike Nomad. [R]\n\nIf a young lady is going to have access to an island mansion where she can invite a group of college friends to spend Spring Break, it might as well be someone named “Muffy St. John” (Foreman). But this hostess isn’t just a spoiled trust-fund WASP; she also loves a good prank, and with April Fool’s Day approaching, the time is ripe to set everyone up for gags ranging from goofy to mean-spirited…but then people start vanishing and turning up dead, suggesting there’s a killer among them. Semi-spoof of slasher movies sets the audience up to be on the lookout for tricks, then expects them to buy into the ruse? Those not born yesterday—or incapable of figuring out why the “kills” seem to always happen offscreen—can find fleeting amusement in the grift and a few mild surprises. The “Ten Little Indians”-esque mystery element makes it a cut above routine stalk-and-slash fare, but genre devotees may be disappointed by its relative tameness and lame ending. A remake went straight to video over twenty years later.\n\n49/100\n\nGung Ho (1986)\n\nDirected by Ron Howard. Starring Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, Sab Shimono, John Turturro, So Yamamura, Clint Howard, Jimhi Kennedy, Rodney Kageyama, Patti Yasutake, Rick Overton, Rance Howard. [PG-13]\n\nBrash Keaton flies to Tokyo to convince a Japanese motor company to purchase and reopen a long-shuttered auto plant and save his small Pennsylvania town, little counting on how much the new management would differ from the local labor force in regards to work ethic, procedure, and traditions. Tepid culture clash comedy has too few real jokes and too little insight that’s not based on stereotypes. Plus, with the protagonist being an almost compulsive liar, the American workers behaving like shiftless slobs, and the Japanese execs being severe and unyielding, rooting interest is hard to find. Keaton just does a lot of the smarmy, fast-talking schtick he was known for in the early part of his film career, but Watanabe (as the pressured exec put in charge by the owner back in Japan) comes close at times to carving out a real character. Turned into a short-lived TV series later that same year.\n\n49/100\n\nJo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986)\n\nDirected by Richard Pryor. Starring Richard Pryor, Debbie Allen, Paula Kelly, Fay Hauser, Barbara Williams, Art Evans, Diahnne Abbott, Billy Eckstine, Wings Hauser, Scoey Mitchell, Michael Ironside, E’Lon Cox, Carmen McRae. [R]\n\nFeature directorial debut for Richard Pryor (his one and only) is a semi-autobiographical story of a successful stand-up comedian called Jo Jo who sets himself on fire freebasing cocaine (think I’ve heard that one before somewhere…), and while in comatose recovery at the hospital, he reflects back on his life from childhood to present. We see his beginnings as a struggling gag man at a seedy Mafia-run nightclub, and through the self-destructive cycles of his relationships with women and alcohol/drug abuse, all with older Jo Jo as a disembodied alter ego witnessing the major events and even trying to get through to his younger self like a remorseful Ebenezer Scrooge. But these are spun-out pieces with limited specificity and insight—they almost ring a little too universal in terms of rise-and-fall (quasi-)bios—and it’s less a journey than a highlight/lowlight reel. For instance, how are we supposed to take Jo Jo’s rise to fame from the bottom when the progression is knocked out by a single montage set to an incongruous psych-soul song (Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On”)? The fantastical format needs a great revelation or turning point to work, but there’s little sense of personal breakthrough for Jo Jo that he didn’t already know—his failed marriages and uncertain desire to kick his habit had already taught him the lessons, he simply wasn’t strong enough to practice what his brain was preaching. Pat storytelling through vignettes and themes, coupled with a happy ending as lazy as it is hurried, ensures the pic misses the mark, but it was still a step in the right direction for Pryor after years of creative slumming/slumping onscreen (The Toy, Superman III, Brewster’s Millions); pity Pryor didn’t heed the lessons like his “Alter-Ego”, so he wouldn’t have gone on to the likes of Critical Condition, Moving, See No Evil Hear No Evil. Pryor also produced, and wrote the script with Paul Mooney and Rocco Urbisci.\n\n49/100\n\nPsycho III (1986)\n\nDirected by Anthony Perkins. Starring Anthony Perkins, Diana Scarwid, Roberta Maxwell, Jeff Fahey, Hugh Gillin, Gary Bayer, Robert Alan Browne, Juliette Cummins, Lee Garlington. [R]\n\nPerkins makes his directorial debut with this third entry in the Psycho franchise (if you can even believe that a Psycho franchise exists). After an opening scene that almost appears to be an homage to a different Hitchcock classic (Vertigo), ex-nun Scarwid wanders into the life of Norman Bates, which is not the safest orbit to be in. A sordid drifter (Fahey), an out-of-town journalist (Maxwell), and football fans ready for the big Homecoming game are all potential victims for the screwy protagonist/antagonist (depending on which side of his personality is dominating at any given time), but Perkins the director doesn’t make much of an attempt to build suspense or rooting interest. In fact, he mostly plays it for gruesome gore and morbid laughs, which provide the only spark in an otherwise flat affair (in familiar slasher movie fashion, he also inserts some gratuitous T&A from Cummins). When playing Bates, though, Perkins almost always gets it right. Screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue.\n\n48/100\n\nThe Mission (1986)\n\nDirected by Roland Joffé. Starring Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Chuck Low, Ronald Pickup, Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi. [PG]\n\nRoland Joffé’s sophomore effort, following his acclaimed The Killing Fields, was shot on sumptuous mountain/forest locations with atmosphere to spare, features a pair of top-notch actors as headliners, and won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, but the undertaking is missing a little something called a story (a clear and/or compelling one, at any rate). In 18th-century South America, De Niro is a mercenary who kidnaps natives for plantation slave work and Irons is a Jesuit missionary trying to bring Christianity to the indigenous people; their paths intertwine, but are no match for the Spanish and Portuguese forces conquering and colonizing the land. A powerful vision to start with, and there’s no shortage of spectacular scenery, while Ennio Morricone’s music is gorgeously evocative enough to bring tears to one’s eyes, but these lush, vibrant qualities don’t extend to the characters, and most viewers will feel discouraged from attempting emotional investment in their lives or their conflicts (a preachy, labored script with an obvious outcome doesn’t help). Chris Menges’ photography won an Academy Award. The voice of the governor/plantation owner played by Low was dubbed by Fred Melamed.\n\n47/100\n\nNothing in Common (1986)\n\nDirected by Garry Marshall. Starring Tom Hanks, Jackie Gleason, Sela Ward, Barry Corbin, Eva Marie Saint, Bess Armstrong, Héctor Elizondo, John Kapelos, Carol Messing, Cindy Harrell. [PG]\n\nYuppie wiseguy Hanks isn’t close with his parents, but he’s forced to tend to their needs when his mom (Saint) abruptly leaves his dad (Gleason) after thirty-something years of marriage, which puts a significant strain on his career and love life. Flimsy seriocomedy overstuffed with parts that don’t always fit—Hanks works hard to land an airline for his ad company, he becomes (sorta) romantically involved with the airline boss’ daughter (Ward), he’s still close with an ex-girlfriend (Armstrong), his father’s own career is faltering, his mother struggles with the prospect of new romance, his father gets sick, and on and on. All the excess baggage wears down the narrative, creating disconnected scenarios that could conceivably fit into one man’s life, but they neither paint a full, satisfying picture nor draw the viewer through the tidy, secure fantasy. Gets at least one aspect right, however: Gleason’s cantankerous grump doesn’t miraculously soften or turn sentimental by the end of the movie. It was the aging comedy legend’s final film, as he was gravely ill during the shoot.\n\n46/100\n\nThe Boy Who Could Fly (1986)\n\nDirected by Nick Castle. Starring Lucy Deakins, Jay Underwood, Fred Savage, Bonnie Bedelia, Mindy Cohn, Fred Gwynne, Colleen Dewhurst, Sean Kelso, Janet MacLachlan, Louise Fletcher. [PG]\n\nGooey-soft fantasy parable about a teenage girl (Deakins) new to town who slowly befriends an autistic boy (Underwood) next door who thinks he can fly. Aimed at children, so the message is as pat as it is uplifting, with sentiment both borrowed and earned, and far too many facile turns in the narrative. For instance, almost all of the supporting characters have convenient little problems to be solved—the mom is struggling at work, the neighbor’s caretaker uncle is a drunk, the heroine’s little brother is being bullied by a kid who’s dog is named Hitler, etc.—but instead of tackling them in a real-world fashion, they’re miraculously taken care of by the “inspiration” of a neurodivergent who can somehow soar around town with Deakins touching his hand like she’s Lois Lane. Some leeway must be given in terms of its dated attitudes and understanding of the boy’s condition, but autism correlating to magic powers must have been in dubious taste even in the 1980s. Fred Savage’s first movie role; keep an eye out for bit player Jason Priestley making his film debut, too.\n\n45/100\n\nInvaders from Mars (1986)\n\nDirected by Tobe Hooper. Starring Hunter Carson, Karen Black, James Karen, Timothy Bottoms, Laraine Newman, Louise Fletcher, Eric Pierpoint, Bud Cort. [PG]\n\nA Martian spaceship lands on the other side of a hill adjacent to young Carson’s house, but as his parents and teachers start getting “taken over” by the unseen menace, the only person who will believe the kid’s warnings is school nurse Black. The part-eerie, part-goofy setup is promising, but the story is obvious and derivative, in more ways than merely being a rehash of the 1950s science fiction pic sharing the same name. It’s fun for a while to see everyone turn on the young protagonist, and small fries are bound to get goosebumps at the sight of Louise Fletcher’s strict teacher gobbling down a frog, but then the movie goes overboard with the special effects, the tension dissipates, and the inevitable resolution is drawn out by juvenile chases and overelaborate battles. From the same era as Henry Thomas’ Elliott, the Goonies, the “Explorers”, et al, Carson’s character and performance simply don’t cut it. Best considered from the point of view that the little boy’s imagination has run wild and he’s making everything up since Stan Winston’s outer space beasties, when revealed, are a goofy bunch, far closer to knock-offs of the Muppets than, say, the big-brained, suction-cup-fingered creatures from H. G. Wells’ imagination. Screenplay credited to Don Jakoby and Dan O’Bannon. Jimmy Hunt, who played the child from the original, appears here in a minor role as the police chief.\n\n44/100\n\nAbsolute Beginners (1986)\n\nDirected by Julien Temple. Starring Eddie O’Connell, Patsy Kensit, James Fox, Anita Morris, Graham Fletcher-Cook, David Bowie, Edward Tudor-Pole, Tony Hippolyte, Steven Berkoff, Bruce Payne, Eve Ferret, Ray Davies, Mandy Rice-Davies, Sade, Chris Pitt. [PG-13]\n\nSlick but muddled British musical set in London’s West End of the 1950s with young lovers—photographer O’Connell and fashion designer/model Kensit—struggling to deal with the lure and price of fame. Flashy camerawork and elaborate pre-fab sets aid director Temple in crafting something memorable to look at, but the story never sorts itself out, chasing youth revolution, sociopolitical upheaval, and more without anything substantive beneath the surface. After a while, the erratic sensory assault just becomes exhausting and it’s easy to wonder just what the heck happened to those razzle-dazzle kids we were supposed to be rooting for? (Oh, wait, they’re narcissists.) In her first substantial film role, singer/actress Kensit is a breathy dud, and even if she did have chemistry with O’Connell, his character is played as a smug, shallow Soho symbol. At least some of the songs are decent (with contributions from, among others, Davies, Sade, and Bowie); it’s almost worth it just to see the latter superstar caper about on a giant typewriter. Temple also directed the music video for Bowie’s title tune, a chart success in the UK. Features Sade’s lone feature film appearance, credited here with her actual last name: Sade Adu.\n\n43/100\n\nThe Best of Times (1986)\n\nDirected by Roger Spottiswoode. Starring Robin Williams, Kurt Russell, Holly Palance, Pamela Reed, Donald Moffat, Margaret Whitton, M. Emmett Walsh. [PG-13]\n\nHaunted by memories of dropping a game-winning pass in a high school football game over a decade ago against a hated rival, small-town dud Williams arranges a rematch, dragging along former golden boy quarterback Russell. Mild comedy-drama fails to establish persuasive motivation, an engaging story arc, or a comedic rhythm; the material mostly just sits there, adequate when it’s not being repetitive or anemic. The climactic football game is as slovenly as anything that preceded it, and in typical underdog fashion, disguises its implausibility with slop, sap, and full-contact fantasy. First of many sports-themed movies for screenwriter Ron Shelton. Of interest to die-hard fans of “Growing Pains,” both Kirk Cameron and Tracey Gold have bit parts.\n\n43/100\n\nAn American Tail (1986)\n\nDirected by Don Bluth. Starring (voices) Phillip Glasser, John Finnegan, Pat Musick, Nehemiah Persoff, Erica Yohn, Dom DeLuise, Cathianne Blore, Christopher Plummer, Amy Green, Hal Smith, Madeline Kahn, Neil Ross. [G]\n\nMiserable animated adventure from Don Bluth is a scattershot immigrant story depicting the Mousekewitz clan of mice traveling from Russia to New York City for a better life, but little Fievel gets separated from his family and encounters numerous obstacles, hardships, and close calls trying to find them in the big city. Confused and underwritten at the script level, utilizing a lot of stereotypes to fill in the blanks, yet sidestepping allegory in order to define all sides by their national/racial background without the courage of actual political content. Kids will be in it for the mousy misadventures—and Feivel is so cloyingly cute with his oversized shirt and squeaky voice, he might not annoy younger viewers—but they’re more likely to find it a tedious and/or depressing experience, what with the animation being as gloomy as the film’s mood, and the mouse being less a plucky hero than a pawn to be jerked around by various one-note, come-and-go villains and allies (a couple incidents faintly resemble the adversities experienced in Disney’s Pinnochio, and the comparisons are truly unfavorable). The songs, including “Somewhere Out There” and an odd number about there not being cats in America, are as much a bust as anything coming out of Walt’s studio for the ten years or so preceding The Little Mermaid. Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers. Spawned a theatrical sequel (An American Tail: Fievel Goes West), a short-lived TV series, and a couple of direct-to-video cash-in flicks.\n\n41/100\n\nThe Manhattan Project (1986)\n\nDirected by Marshall Brickman. Starring Christopher Collet, John Lithgow, Cynthia Nixon, Jill Eikenberry, John Mahoney, Gregg Edelman, Richard Jenkins, Abraham Unger, Robert Sean Leonard. [PG-13]\n\nThe “yeah right factor” is high in this unexciting thriller, one of the lesser examples of the teen-oriented crop that littered the 1980s (War Games, My Science Project, Back to the Future, etc.). A faintly rebellious high school student (Collet) with an aptitude for science is upset to learn the U.S. government has set up a secret lab just outside his town where plutonium tests are taking place, so he breaks in, steals a container of the stuff, and builds a nuclear weapon(!) with it in order to expose the truth. Change of pace for director Brickman (better known for his writing collaborations with Woody Allen) struggles to ever get out of first gear. The adults—scientist Lithgow and single mom Eikenberry—acquit themselves well enough, but the youngsters look lost; it’s hard to say exactly what motivates the protagonist, either in the script or the performance, but he’s not endearing enough to earn rooting interest while breaking all sorts of laws and (of course) getting off scot-free at the end. It wouldn’t be fair to give the movie the easy label of “a bomb,” but it still might be best to just bury it in a geological repository. Brickman also co-wrote and co-produced.\n\n40/100\n\nRaw Deal (1986)\n\nDirected by John Irvin. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kathryn Harrold, Darren McGavin, Robert Davi, Sam Wanamaker, Steven Hill, Paul Shenar, Ed Lauter, Joe Regalbuto, Blanche Baker. [R]\n\nSmall-town sheriff Schwarzenegger, a former federal agent now living in “exile,” is recruited by old friend McGavin to take on the Chicago mob syndicate responsible for killing his son. Brainless action pic executed with the bare minimum of energy and style, redeemed a bit by Ah-nuld’s knowing sense of humor…though some of the funniest bits are still probably accidental, like Baker’s single-scene “performance” as the hero’s hard-drinking, harder-whining wife. Even the execution of its bare-boned idiot plot is mishandled, resulting in multiple instances where it’s a struggle to figure out who some characters are and why they’re doing the things they’re doing (did most of Hill and Lauter’s scenes end up on the cutting room floor?). To genre fans, a comic book-style shoot ‘em up without a single set piece to remember is a raw deal, indeed. “Tied” for the honor of being the first film released by the short-lived De Laurentiis Entertainment Group—it shared a launch date with DEG’s oh-so-similar My Little Pony: The Movie.\n\n38/100\n\nLink (1986)\n\nDirected by Richard Franklin. Starring Elisabeth Shue, Terence Stamp, Steven Pinner, Kevin Lloyd. [R]\n\nAdvanced simian research undertaken by anthropologist Stamp goes wrong when one of his test subjects, a chimpanzee called Link, starts behaving aggressively and terrorizing, among others, a student assistant (Shue) staying at Stamp’s coastal estate. This monkey business is too goofy to work as a horror picture; perhaps aware of this, Shue rarely seems as concerned or frightened as she oughta be. I can appreciate Richard Franklin using real animals instead of stuntmen in suits or puppets, but trained chimps, while potentially very dangerous, simply aren’t terrifying in this kind of heightened scenario. There’s one good overhead shot in the house near the end of Link chasing Shue and her injured boyfriend, but that’s about all there is to remember, other than an assortment of bemused chuckles that presumably weren’t intended (um, should Link’s shouting at the very end been subtitled: “Made it, Ma, top of the world!”?). Funky, carnival-esque music by Jerry Goldmsith. By the way, Link isn’t even a real chimp—he’s played by an orangutan actor named Locke with dyed fur! Some international edits omit the totally unnecessary opening scene.\n\n37/100\n\nThe Money Pit (1986)\n\nDirected by Richard Benjamin. Starring Tom Hanks, Shelley Long, Alexander Godunov, Philip Bosco, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Mantegna, Josh Mostel, Douglass Watson. [PG-13]\n\nLoose remake of Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House finds Hanks playing broad for the sake of laughs; too bad there are hardly any to find here. He and girlfriend Long buy a grand fixer-upper and disaster ensues; that’s pretty much it. Lots of slapstick and destruction, some of it even well-staged, but it’s far easier to admire the stunt and/or special effect involved than it is to find it funny. Of the supporting cast, Godunov is mildly amusing as Long’s amiably self-centered lothario of an ex, but everyone else just sort of wanders in and out of scenes without leaving much of an impression. Despite an economical hour-and-a-half runtime, it really starts to drag by the home stretch, especially as it deals with a poorly-conceived infidelity sub-plot. Steven Spielberg was one of the film’s executive producers, not too surprising considering this one falls right in line with the bigger-is-not-funnier outcome of his own 1941.\n\n37/100\n\nJumpin’ Jack Flash (1986)\n\nDirected by Penny Marshall. Starring Whoopi Goldberg, Stephen Collins, John Wood, Annie Potts, Carol Kane, Sara Botsford, Jon Lovitz, Peter Michael Goetz, Roscoe Lee Brown. [R]\n\nEarly starring vehicle for Whoopi Goldberg is also the directorial debut for Penny Marshall, but neither one is in what would soon become their “comfort zone”. This lame espionage-comedy sees Whoopi as a computer operator at a major NYC bank who is contacted through the system one day by “Jack”, a British secret agent stuck in Eastern Europe, to help get him out, but responding to the messages puts a target on her back. With her most frequent screen partner being a computer at which she restlessly talk-types, she has no one to consistently play off of (even when she would do her stand-up/one-woman-shows all by herself, she had the live audience); as a result, although she tries hard—you can almost see her sweat running around with a gun in her mouth or fighting to keep her dress out of a paper shredder—there are only a few weak chuckles across the entire picture, and the supporting characters are underwritten and underplayed. As for the action/spy stuff, it’s just a bunch of arbitrary, assembly-line chases, gunplay and stuntwork instead of set-pieces to dazzle the eyes or elevate the pulse. And never forget the first rule of spycraft: when trying to eliminate a threat, it’s best to be a little more covert than dragging the target inside a phone booth behind a tow truck down several city blocks in broad daylight. Jonathan Pryce cameos as Jack; Penny’s brother, Garry, shows up for a walk-on; and a number of recognizable faces appear in minor roles, including Phil Hartman, Jeroen Krabbé, Jim Belushi, and Tracy Ullman.\n\n36/100\n\nLegal Eagles (1986)\n\nDirected by Ivan Reitman. Starring Robert Redford, Debra Winger, Daryl Hannah, David Clennon, Steven Hill, Brian Dennehy, Terence Stamp, Jennifer Dundas, John McMartin, Roscoe Lee Browne, Christine Baranski. [PG-13]\n\nA silly, overstuffed mishmash of genres, none of them done successfully: a comedy without laughs, a thriller without excitement, a legal drama without an interesting case, a mystery not worth solving, a romance without spark. On the latter count, Redford’s prosecutor doesn’t have chemistry with either of the women he gets involved with—insipid defense lawyer Winger or her nutty conceptual artist client (Hannah)—but the movie keeps him so busy, the filmmakers probably banked on no one noticing; ditto the plot holes, of which there are an abundance even by these standards. He wears so many hats in this thing (assistant D.A., defense attorney, single father, lover, investigator, action hero, etc.) it’s a wonder he’s not hospitalized for exhaustion along the way. Yet with all this busyness, there’s no lift or momentum to the convoluted cases of art theft, insurance fraud, and murder at hand, and the viewer is merely dragged along for the ride, stumbling into the usual tired plot devices and clichéd threats of danger and violence. Producer/director Reitman also earned co-story credit. Astoundingly, the version broadcast on television featured an alternate ending that changes Hannah’s guilt/innocence from the original cut!\n\n36/100\n\nPoltergeist II: The Other Side (1986)\n\nDirected by Brian Gibson. Starring Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Will Sampson, Heather O’Rourke, Oliver Robins, Julian Beck, Zelda Rubinstein, Geraldine Fitzgerald. [PG-13]\n\nOnce more into the supernatural wringer for the Freeling’s, as they’re stuck shacking up with grandma for the time being, since insurance won’t cover a house that up and disappeared into another plane of existence (one of the film’s few enjoyable touches). But then granny croaks, an American Indian shaman (Sampson) arrives to protect little Carol Anne, a creepy old ghost comes a-callin’, and…well, the screenplay doesn’t bother trying to figure it out, so why should I? A plodding parade of Native American mysticism, spectral apparitions, possessions, clairvoyant mumbo jumbo, manifestations of ghostly rage, etc., without any of the creativity or goosebumps that made the first film work, not to mention a dodgy family dynamic that makes the Freeling’s less worthy of empathy and affection; for example, after going through the events of the original, why is the dad so skeptical for so long? Too many of the big effects sequences are silly (an entity made out of braces wire), gross (a “vomit creature,” per actual cast billing), or just embarrassing (the depiction of “the Other Side”), and instead of building to a substantial climax, the movie coughs its way to a rushed finale that’s likely to cause viewers to check their watches/phones even though this thing is only an hour-and-a-half long. Michael Grais and Mark Victor, who scripted the first movie with Steven Spielberg, wrote and produced this one by themselves.\n\n36/100\n\nThe Quest (1986)\n\nDirected by Brian Trenchard-Smith. Starring Henry Thomas, Tony Barry, Rachel Friend, Tamsin West, Dempsey Knight, John Ewart. [PG]\n\nPrecocious American lad living Down Under investigates strange sightings at a quarry lake where Aboriginal myth warns of the presence of a Loch Ness Monster-esque entity called the “Donkegin”. The folkore is murky, the revelation is a disappointment, the racist stereotypes are casually glossed over, and not even young Henry Thomas’ participation works out for the pic’s target audience—the low-key monotone of his line readings makes him sound bored, entirely disengaged from the fantastical possibilities of the local mystery. Despite some capricious camerawork, the movie is too poorly directed to generate the excitement, wonder and concern a kid’s adventure like this needs. Tony Barry almost makes the father-son relationship with the protagonist interesting, but it proves to be a losing effort when the story and atmosphere keep stalling out. Originally titled Frog Dreaming upon its initial release in Australia, and known by several other titles for its various international releases, such as The Mystery of the Dark Lake and The Go-Kids.\n\n35/100\n\nModern Girls (1986)\n\nDirected by Jerry Kramer. Starring Cynthia Gibb, Clayton Rohner, Daphne Zuniga, Virginia Madsen, Stephen Shellen, Martin Ferrero, Rick Overton, John Dye. [PG-13]\n\nOne of those fashionable 1980s “long, crazy night on the town among shallow twenty-somethings” movies where nothing seems to go right, and not one of the more memorable ones. Gibb is a bored but earnest young woman, newly fired from a dead-end department store job, who goes out Friday night with her bored but cynical roommate (Zuniga), trying to catch up with a third roommate (Madsen) who took off to try and hook up with a DJ. It’s not fresh, almost never funny, and it treats its characters with a mixture of indifference and hostility; Madsen’s starry-eyed rape-victim-to-be is especially abused by this attitude. Those waiting for a payoff to Rohner playing two separate significant roles—the lovelorn wimp who’s used by the girls as a chauffeur and shares in their misadventures & an inscrutable punk rocker Gibb is chasing—will be left waiting; it’s apparently just a meaningless dual performance.\n\n34/100\n\nYoungblood (1986)\n\nDirected by Peter Markle. Starring Rob Lowe, Cynthia Gibb, Ed Lauter, Patrick Swayze, Jim Youngs, Eric Nesterenko, Fionnula Flanagan, Ken James, Peter Faussett, George Finn, Keanu Reeves. [R]\n\nPredictable cheeseball sports picture cribs from the playbooks of dozens of other sports pictures, and lacks a compelling protagonist to hold the trope-addled line. For example, the star, a bland hockey hotshot (Lowe) playing in a small-time Canadian league, has a “meet cute” with a young lady who—get this—turns out to be the coach’s daughter, whoa! Dismal on both the writing and directing levels, it’s emblematic of the sort of proud macho b.s. where the hero doesn’t win the day by improving his playing skills or learning a lesson about teamwork or life or whatever, but rather by learning how to take and throw a punch for a confrontation with a rival goon at the end of the championship game. And it’s hard to say who deserves the most blame for such an uninteresting lead character; just don’t bother trying to count the number of times the camera cuts to him for a response but he says nothing as if either he forgot his lines or the screenwriters forgot to give him any, and the director apparently just threw up his hands and shouted, “Moving on!” Constantly played back at half-speed, you’d be hard-pressed to find less exciting ice hockey action in a feature film (and I’ve seen two Mighty Ducks movies). Film debut for Reeves; it’s a small role, and he only has a few lines, which are delivered in a less-than-convincing French-Canadian accent!\n\n34/100\n\nDeadly Friend (1986)\n\nDirected by Wes Craven. Starring Matthew Laborteaux, Kristy Swanson, Michael Sharrett, Anne Twomey, Richard Marcus, Russ Marin, Anne Ramsey, Andrew Roperto. [R]\n\nHere’s an idea that can’t miss: a high school student (Laborteaux) builds a highly sophisticated, talking robot (whose voice sounds a lot like Stripe from Gremlins), and when the girl next door (Swanson) ends up brain-dead after her father beats the hell out of her, the kid steals her corpse and sticks his robot’s hard drive inside her skull, bringing her back to, um, life? Oh, and then the “reborn” young lady proceeds to go on a neighborhood killing spree. Despite the alleged interference of studio executives demanding more gore because of the director’s reputation, it’s difficult to see how this story could have ever worked outside of accidental camp comedy. In its most notorious scene, Swanson doesn’t simply behead a victim with a basketball—the noggin explodes on contact! Then there’s the ending, which makes absolutely no sense, but at that point, what the heck, right? Should go without saying that this bizarre jumble has gained a cult following in the years since.\n\n33/100\n\nIron Eagle (1986)\n\nDirected by Sidney J. Furie. Starring Jason Gedrick, Louis Gossett Jr., David Suchet, Jerry Levine, Robbie Rist, Tim Thomerson, Larry B. Scott, Shawnee Smith, Melora Hardin, Lance LeGault, Michael Bowen, David Greenlee. [PG-13]\n\nPreposterous right-wing fantasy where a teenager (Gedrick) steals an F-16 fighter jet and flies into a fictional Middle East country to rescue his Air Force pilot father (Thomerson), scheduled to be executed after getting shot down and captured. He’s joined by Gossett, a gruff-but-lovable Obi Wan Kenobi-esque Vietnam vet who “dies” during the rescue operation because the filmmakers have no confidence in the intelligence of the audience to see through the cheap misdirection. Although tempting to call this pic a Top Gun knockoff, it was actually released a few months before that movie; still, the slick dogfighting, rock score, and moral turpitude on the political stage certainly makes it “of a type.” The jingoism extends to one character denigrating the “gimpy, little countries” where the enemy “other” would hail from, a statement made right between a put-down of Carter and giving Reagan a cute nickname. The kid is lackluster, Gossett is way too good for the material, and the chief villain is an embarrassing stereotype; take away the fine aerial photography, and there’s no reason to watch except to give the eyeballs a “rolling workout.” Followed by three sequels.\n\n33/100\n\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1986)\n\nDirected by Corey Yuen. Starring Kurt McKinney, J.W. Fails, Kent Lipham, Timothy D. Baker, Tai Chung Kim, Kathie Sileno, Ron Pohnel, Jean-Claude van Damme, Dale Jacoby. [PG]\n\nExceedingly earnest but inept martial arts hokum about teenage McKinney being taught karate by Bruce Lee’s ghost—no, seriously—so he can defend himself against bullies and gangsters (of course). What isn’t recycled from The Karate Kid and multiple Rocky movies is just embarrassingly silly (is the ghost supposed to be real or a figment of the kid’s imagination? Nope, doesn’t matter), while the acting and storytelling are pure amateur hour. Van Damme’s first movie role of any substance; he only appears at the beginning and the climax and says all of about ten words but gets in plenty of high-kicks and splits (therefore, it must be considered one of his savviest performances). There’s some decent action choreography in the final fight scenes, but the only reason to watch that far is to repeatedly laugh at the ineptitude on-hand before it. An endurance test for those who don’t like cheese/camp; not the worst way to waste an hour-and-a-half for those who do.\n\n32/100\n\nUnder the Cherry Moon (1986)\n\nDirected by Prince. Starring Prince, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jerome Benton, Alexandra Stewart, Steven Berkoff, Francesca Annis, Emmanuel Sallet, Victor Spinetti. [PG-13]\n\nThis vanity project to make Purple Rain look like a piece of shrinking modesty finds Prince stepping into the director’s chair to oversee his one-note performance as a nightclub pianist boy-toy who targets a young heiress for her dough (played by Kristin Scott Thomas—yes, that one—in an inauspicious screen debut), but falls in love with her instead. Shot by Michael Ballhaus in decadent b&w with 1920s-style sets and costuming, Prince comes off like a wannabe John Gilbert or Rudolph Valentino; as such, the picture’s not bad to look at, but there’s nothing to grab onto underneath the veneer. There’s some boring bitchy rich girl stuff and some silky smooth gigolo stuff, but when everyone’s drawn so broadly and the emotions are either oaken or histrionic, who cares? Far more interesting is the homoerotic byplay between Prince and sidekick Benton (apparently, they’re playing half-brothers, but that wouldn’t stop someone as kinky as Prince), although their clownish behavior is even more out-of-date than the aesthetic and belongs in a different movie (or music video). They’re more amused by their antics than we are—who else was stone-faced perplexed by their gales of laughter during the “wrecka stow” bit?—but at least there’s the facsimile of life there, completely absent in the doomed romance. The confused tone throughout is its downfall, even more so than the paper-thin plot, which might have survived by the skin of its teeth with more energy and music, but despite a hit soundtrack emerging from the crash (Parade), the songs are fragmentary and hard to come by; worse, they’re mostly unexceptional: the tune “Girls & Boys” is improved immeasurably if sped up 50-100%, and his classic, “Kiss”, is treated as a throwaway late in the story. Superior to Prince’s next and last stab at a movie career (1990’s Graffiti Bridge), but not by much, and a real letdown after the big, promising splash he made a couple years earlier. Pop music geeks will enjoy noticing that Prince’s character is called Christopher Tracy, the same name he used as a pseudonym for writing the hit song, “Manic Monday”, for the Bangles.\n\n32/100\n\nWildcats (1986)\n\nDirected by Michael Ritchie. Starring Goldie Hawn, Swoosie Kurtz, Robyn Lively, James Keach, Nipsey Russll, Bruce McGill, Nick Corri, Mykelti Williamson, Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Tab Thacker, M. Emmet Walsh, Willie J. Walton, Jan Hooks, George Wyner. [PG]\n\nBargain-basement pigskin comedy is another vehicle for Goldie Hawn trying to recreate the box office success of Private Benjamin. Here, she’s out to prove that women can coach football as well as the boys, and as a “practical joke” by the chauvinists in charge, she’s allowed to take over an inner city high school team filled out by a rag-tag group of players who don’t respect her authority—set up to fail, but can she succeed? Gee, lemme think… Although director Michael Ritchie has worked in the sub-genre before (Bad News Bears, a shining example of the obvious form), it’s not enough to just offer up slapstick yuks, a roster of underdogs, and a team-turnarou"
