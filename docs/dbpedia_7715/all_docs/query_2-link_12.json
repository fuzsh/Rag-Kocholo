        "text": "SYDNEY: Actor John Meillon, who died\n\nyesterday aged 55, was renowned for his por\n\ntrayal of the Australian larrikin. His most\n\nrecent roles included a knockabout bushie in\n\nthe blockbuster films Crocodile Dundee I and\n\nII.\n\nBut friends and fellow actors shocked by\n\nthe news yesterday coloured in a larger pic\n\nture of Meillon's devotion to his art and his\n\nability to live his characters, be it comedy,\n\ndrama, tragedy.\n\nEducated at Sydney Grammar School,\n\nMeillon began acting at 11, gained experience\n\noverseas, returned home to Australian Film\n\nInstitute awards, Logies and an OBE, chalk\n\ning up memorable appearances on stage and\n\nscreen.\n\nClose friend Bill Gardner, mourning with\n\nMeillon's fellow members at the Mosman\n\nRowing Gub on Sydney's North Shore, said\n\nMeillon loved Paul Hogan's brash Dundee.\n\nBut he believed it was Meillon's role as a\n\nsolo father dealing with his young son's fatal\n\ncancer in the movie, The Fourth Wish, which\n\nhe held dearest to his heart.\n\n\"He was very selective in the roles that he\n\ndid â€” he refused many because he did not\n\nthink they were good enough and money never\n\nentered his head,\" Mr Gardner said.\n\nMeillon's other noted films included Sun\n\ndowners and Picture Show Man.\n\nHis agent Bill Shanahan said last night he\n\nhad no details of the actor's death.\n\nThe cause of death is not yet known.\n\nMeillon's second wife Bunny Gibson was\n\nlast night flying back from London where she\n\nwas visiting family after Meillon had accom\n\npanied her on a trip to Hong Kong.\n\nHis first wife was actress June Salter. He\n\nleaves a son, John Meillon junior.\n\nAt Meillon's other favourite watering hole,\n\nthe Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay, manager Ben\n\nSpencer said the actor's wit and generous\n\nnature would be sadly missed.\n\nMeillon's health had deteriorated over the\n\npast 12 months and he had become quiet and\n\nintrospective, Mr Spencer said.\n\n\"Up until then, he had a cutting wit and a\n\nstrong satirical manner.''\n\nThe actor had already been immortalised\n\nwith his own John Meillon Bar at the Oaks,\n\nhe said, and hnd long held a permanently\n\nreserved table looking out to an oak tree.\n\nActor Noel Ferrier lauded Meillon as one of\n\nAustralia's greatest actors.\n\n\"I was always a bit in awe of Meillon\n\nbecause he was one of those actors . . . that\n\nwhen he gets on stage or when he gets in front\n\nof a camera, you never felt he was acting,\" he\n\nsaid.\n\n\"He just was the character. He had a pecu\n\nliar genius which very few actors present.\""
