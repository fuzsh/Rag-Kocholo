        "text": "70s Actors – 80s Actors – 90s Actors – 2000s Actors\n\nThis page will look at the major Australian (male) actors who starred in films during the 40s, 50s and 60s, both in Australia and overseas. These were actors who made it through the lean years before the revival of the Australian film industry in the 1970s. Many of these actors worked in the UK or the US during this years, and many never returned home to work again. Several did manage to carry on and return to make successful careers in Australia from 1970 on.\n\nFrom the 1940s until the late 60s, the previously healthy Australian film industry went into almost terminal decline, with only a handful of feature films made in the 40s and 50s and even fewer in the 60s (see here). With little opportunity to become local film stars, Australian actors and actresses were faced with the choice of either going to England or America to try to become famous, or staying in Australia and working in the more modest worlds of live theatre, radio or (from the late 50s) television acting. While most chose the latter course, achieving only modest fame, a handful of (mainly male) actors established themselves as household names in Britain and the US.\n\nThe list below comprises mainly actors who were born in Australia or who came to Australia as children, but it also includes two actors who came to Australia as adults (the Kellaway brothers from South Africa), as the Kellaways got their start in the Australian film industry, even though Cecil made his career overseas.\n\nFirst we’ll look at the four Aussie actors who were the most successful at home and abroad: Errol Flynn, Peter Finch, Chips Rafferty, and Rod Taylor.\n\nThen we’ll look at the other actors, in the order of the decade in which they made their film debuts:\n\nCecil Kellaway, Alec Kellaway and Bill Kerr from the 1930s;\n\nRon Randell, Grant Taylor, Charles ‘Bud’ Tingwell, Vincent Ball, Michael Pate, Lloyd Lamble, Henry Murdoch, and John McCallum from the 1940s;\n\nEd Devereaux, Leo McKern, Robert Tudawali, Reg Lye, Allan Cuthbertson and Frank Thring from the 1950s; and lastly\n\nJohn Meillon, Ray Barrett, Slim De Grey and George Lazenby from the 1960s (just in time to join the 1970s revival).\n\nHere we go.\n\nThe Top Four\n\nThe first Aussie to make it overseas was the dashing Errol Flynn.\n\nErrol Flynn (1909-1959)\n\nErrol Leslie Flynn was born in 1909 in a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania. He was the first Australian to become a Hollywood star, and starred in 54 feature films, where he usually played a fearless adventurer and charming romantic hero. His most famous films were Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk and The Adventures of Robin Hood. Flynn’s best roles were in the 30s and early 40s, but he continued to make films until the late 50s.\n\nFlynn made only one film in Australia: In the Wake of the Bounty in 1933, before leaving for success in Hollywood. Two Australian films of Flynn’s early life in Australia and New Guinea have been made: Flynn (1993) and In Like Flynn (2018).\n\nFilms (Australian films in red): 1933 In the Wake of the Bounty, 1935 Murder at Monte Carlo, Don’t Bet on Blondes, The Case of the Curious Bride, 1935 Captain Blood, 1936 The Charge of the Light Brigade, 1937 Green Light, The Prince and the Pauper, Another Dawn, The Perfect Specimen, 1938 The Adventures of Robin Hood, Modernos Kazanovas, The Sisters, The Dawn Patrol, 1939 Dodge City, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, 1940 Virginia City, The Sea Hawk, Santa Fe, 1941 Footsteps in the Dark, Dive Bomber, They Died with Their Boots On, 1942 Desperate Journey, Gentleman Jim, 1943 Edge of Darkness, Thank Your Lucky Stars, Northern Pursuit, 1944 Uncertain Glory, 1945 Objective, Burma!, San Antonio, 1946 Never Say Goodbye, 1947 Cry Wolf, Escape Me Never, 1948 Silver River, Adventures of Don Juan, 1949 That Forsyte Woman, 1950 Montana, Rocky Mountain, Kim, 1951 Adventures of Captain Fabian, Hello God, 1952 Mara Maru, Against All Flags, 1953 The Master of Ballantrae, 1954 Il maestro di Don Giovanni, Lilacs in the Spring, 1955 The Dark Avenger, King’s Rhapsody, 1957 Istanbul, The Big Boodle, The Sun Also Rises, 1958 Too Much, Too Soon, The Roots of Heaven, 1959 Cuban Rebel Girls\n\nMore Information: Flynn, Errol Leslie (1909–1959) (Australian Dictionary of Biography), Errol Flynn Profile (TCM), Errol Flynn at IMDb, Errol Flynn at Wikipedia\n\nPeter Finch (1916-1977)\n\nPeter Finch was born in London in 1916, but, after his parents divorced, grew up with his grandmother in France and India, before coming to Australia at the age of 10 and living with his father’s uncle in Sydney.

He served in the Australian army in the Second World War, and then continued to appear in Australian films and the theatre, until he was spotted by Laurence Olivier during a visit to Australia. Olivier encouraged him to travel to England where Finch had an extremely successful career, starring in over 40 British and Hollywood films until his death in 1977.\n\nFinch made 8 films in Australia before 1950 and returned in the mid-1950s to make the hit film A Town Like Alice (1956), as well as the successful adaptations of The Shiralee and Robbery under Arms (both 1957) with British director Jack Lee.\n\nFinch was the first Australian actor to win an Academy Award for Best Actor (for Network in 1976), and won five BAFTA awards for A Town Like Alice, The Trials of Oscar Wilde, No Love for Johnnie, Sunday, Bloody Sunday and Network.\n\nFilms (Australian films in red): 1938 – Dad and Dave Come to Town, 1939 – Mr. Chedworth Steps Out; Ants in His Pants, 1941 – The Power and the Glory, 1944 – The Rats of Tobruk, 1945 – Red Sky at Morning, 1946 – A Son Is Born, 1949 – Eureka Stockade, Train of Events, 1950 – The Wooden Horse, The Miniver Story, 1952 – The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men, 1953 – The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan; The Heart of the Matter, 1954 – Elephant Walk; Father Brown; Make Me an Offer!, 1955 – The Dark Avenger; Passage Home; Josephine and Men; Simon and Laura; 1956 – A Town Like Alice; The Battle of the River Plate, 1957 – The Shiralee; Robbery under Arms; Windom’s Way, 1959 – The Nun’s Story; Operation Amsterdam; 1960 – Kidnapped; The Sins of Rachel Cade; The Trials of Oscar Wilde, 1961 – No Love for Johnnie, 1962 – I Thank a Fool, 1963 – Girl with Green Eyes; In the Cool of the Day, 1964 – The Pumpkin Eater, 1965 – Judith; The Flight of the Phoenix, 1966 – 10:30 P.M.

Hall comedy Dad Rudd M.P. (1940) and his first starring role was a soldier in Charles Chauvel’s hit war film Forty Thousand Horsemen (also 1940). For the next 30 years, he was one of the main leading men in the local Australian film industry. Tall, thin and laconic, he played rugged, resourceful bushmen throughout his life, and became an Australian Everyman at a time when bush values of toughness and resilience were prized.\n\nRafferty is best known for his lead roles in The Overlanders and Eureka Stockade, but he important roles in many films including Wake in Fright and They’re A Weird Mob. He played in 17 Australian films and 7 foreign films and had many TV roles as well.

This was the first time an Aboriginal actor, along with his female co-star, Ngarla Kunoth, had played the lead role in a feature film. Tudawali was a great success in this role, but there were few other opportunities for Aboriginal actors in those days, and so, after a couple of small parts in films and a TV series, Tudawali ended his career.\n\nTudawali then became a promoter of Aboriginal rights until an early death at the age of 39 from burns suffered in a fight.

There he later became an advertising model, and in 1968 he was chosen to be the next James Bond after Sean Connery’s retirement from the role. Lazenby made his film debut as James Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969). The film was successful and Lazenby’s performance was praised, but to everyone’s amazement Lazenby decided that he didn’t want to make spy movies and turned down the opportunity to play in further James Bond films.\n\nAfter this classic mistake, Lazenby found it hard to get better roles, and ended up back in action films. In the mid-70s, he made a Hong Kong action film, Stoner (1974). He followed this by playing the arch-villian in a Hong Kong/Australian co-production, The Man from Hong Kong (1975) which was set in mainly in Australia, and directed by the Australian director Brian Trenchard-Smith. This film has come to be regarded as a seminal Oz action classic. It was Lazenby’s only Australian feature film, though he also made a couple of TV films in Australia in the 70s.
