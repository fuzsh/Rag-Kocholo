Beautifully shot by Freddie Francis and with an excellent supporting cast including Sir John Gielgud Anne Bancroft and Dame Wendy Hiller 'The Elephant Man' is a compelling moving and enchanting story. The film was nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture Best Director and Best Actor.\n\nChinatown | DVD | (02/10/2000) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £15.99\n\nA landmark movie in the film noir tradition Roman Polanski’s Chinatown stands as a true screen classic.

The versatile Patrick McGoohan took the lead role of John Drake, a daring spy for the NATO powers. This first, half-hour incarnation of the show (that would be known in the US as Secret Agent) concentrated on tight little plots executed at a rapid pace. McGoohan proved as adept in the numerous fight scenes and he was at spitting out the hardboiled dialogue which counterpointed Edwin Astley's memorable music. Although Drake is a deliberately colourless leading man, the format of the show allowed McGoohan to go undercover each week as a different, often strange character. Later, the series came back as an hour-long programme that segued wildly into McGoohan's masterpiece, The Prisoner. Volume One includes the following episodes: \"View from the Villa\" (with Barbara Shelley); \"Time to Kill\" (with Derren Nesbitt); \"Josetta\"; and \"The Blue Veil\" (with Ferdy Mayne). --Kim Newman\n\nThe Jackal | DVD | (21/07/2003) from £6.20 | Saving you £9.79 (157.90%) | RRP £15.99\n\nBruce Willis is The Jackal - the greatest assassin in history - out to eliminate a top U.S. government official.

She acts like a female James Bond, vanquishing evil in the forms of robots and monsters. She also rewards, in an uninhibited manner, the handsome men who assist her in the adventure.

Directed by the Veteran Charles Crichton, who made the 1951 Ealing Comedies classic The Lavender Hill Mob, Wanda combined Ealing-comedy capers and Basil Fawlty-esque farce with contemporary big-screen swearing and black comedy. The plot develops in classic film noir style as Cleese's lawyer, Archie Leech, gets sucked into the double-crossing aftermath of a London diamond heist. For sound box-office reasons, British comedies often sport an American star and here Cleese delivers not only Jamie Lee Curtis as a smooth operating femme fatale, but Kevin Kline as her idiotic, and insanely jealous lover (for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Pushing the limits of bad taste is Michael Palin's animal-loving Ken, who in the film's best running gag attempts to murder an old lady, only to slay her beloved pet dogs. Other highlights include Palin as a man with two chips up his nose and Cleese showing the world a different sort of \"Full Monty\". One of the funniest British films ever made, A Fish Called Wanda was followed by Fierce Creatures (1997), which reunited the lead cast and claimed to be an \"equal\" not a \"sequel\", but sadly wasn't. --Gary S Dalkin\n\nAn American Tale | DVD | (05/12/2005) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £9.99\n\nFievel is a young Russian mouse and he and his parents are on their way to America.
