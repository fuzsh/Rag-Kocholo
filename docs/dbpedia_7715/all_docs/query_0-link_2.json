        "text": "Australian actor (1934–1989)\n\nJohn Meillon, ( MEL-yon; 1 May 1934 – 11 August 1989),[1] was an Australian character actor known for dramatic as well as comedy roles. He portrayed Walter Reilly in the films Crocodile Dundee and Crocodile Dundee II. He also voiced advertisements for Victoria Bitter beer.[2] He appeared in several Australian New Wave films including Wake in Fright and The Cars That Ate Paris.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMeillon was born in Mosman, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. His younger brother was director Bob Meillon (1943–2012).[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nMeillon began his acting career at the age of eleven in the ABC's radio serial Stumpy, and made his first stage appearance the following year. He joined the John Alden Shakespeare Touring Company when he was sixteen.\n\nHe appeared in a number of early Australian TV plays.[4]\n\nLike many actors of his generation from 1959 to 1965, he worked in England,[5] but while working in Britain he consciously steered away from Australian roles.[6] Meillon claimed that he learned discipline while working in theatre, and that television was not a good medium for training.[7]\n\nMeillon had a recurring role in the television series My Name's McGooley, What's Yours?. In 1968 he featured in the spin off, Rita and Wally. He featured in two episodes of Skippy in 1968 and 1969, appearing as 'Nimble Norris'. In 1976, he won the AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role of 'Casey' in the film The Fourth Wish (1976).\n\nVoiceover\n\n[edit]\n\nWith his rich baritone, Meillon was used extensively in voice-over work – most famously in his work as the Victoria Bitter narrator who says \"you can get it any old how\".[8]\n\nMeillon was appointed an OBE in the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours, for service to theatre.[9]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1977, Meillon released the single \"Tap Tap\"/\"Picture Show Man\", which peaked at number 80 on the Australian singles chart.[10]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMeillon married Australian actress June Salter in 1958 and they had one son, John Meillon, Jr. Meillon and Salter were divorced in 1971. Meillon married actress Bunny Gibson on 5 April 1972; they also had a son.[11]\n\nIn June 1980, Meillon's favourite pub, The Oaks at Neutral Bay, opened The John Meillon OBE Bar in his honour.[12] He continued to frequent the bar over the following decade, including visiting in the week before his death.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nMeillon died from cirrhosis at Neutral Bay, Sydney, on 11 August 1989.[13][14][15] Meillon was posthumously awarded the Raymond Longford Lifetime Achievement Award.[16]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Production Role Type 1959: On the Beach Ralph Swain (ashore in San Francisco) Feature film 1960 The Sundowners Bluey Brown Feature film 1961 The Long and the Short and the Tall Private \"Smudge\" Smith Feature film 1961 Watch It, Sailor!
