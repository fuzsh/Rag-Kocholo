        "text": "40s films –50s films – 60s films – 80s films – 90s films – 2000s films – 2010 FILMS\n\nIn the decade of the 1960s, only eight locally produced Australian films were released, and none were very successful. By contrast, the decade of the 1970s saw nearly 150 Australian-produced films released, and many of them were commercial and/or critical hits. The 1970s was the decade that the Australian film industry revived after many years of moribund production. The film industry was revived by a group of determined young film-makers, aided in the beginning by government funding and a pent-up desire of Australians to see films about themselves.\n\nThe decade also saw a lifting of censorship, meaning that films were permitted to depict nudity, sex, bad language and bad behaviour to a much greater extent, in line with greater permissiveness in society at the time. The new film directors of the early 70s took advantage of the relaxed censorship to make a series of lowbrow films that managed to shock, amuse and thrill local audiences.\n\nThe success of the early lowbrow films of Tim Burstall and Bruce Beresford provided the impetus for the new industry to grow, and a number of other young directors branched out to create more tasteful and even artistic films, which also proved popular. Taken as a whole, these directors created a body of films that re-established the film industry in Australia.\n\nUnlike other decades, I think it is useful to look at films under three broad categories: Lowbrow, Middlebrow and Highbrow. Success came at first to certain lowbrow films, and then to middle and highbrow films later on. By the end of the decade, the film industry included successful films from all of these streams, constituting a somewhat well-rounded industry.\n\nToday, films from each category are still entertaining, or at least of interest for what they can tell us about Australian society in the 70s. I have selected 35 of the most significant films of the decade:\n\nLowbrow\n\nStork (1971) (Tim Burstall)\n\nThe Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nAlvin Purple (1973) (Tim Burstall)\n\nStone (1974) (Sandy Harbutt)\n\nPetersen (1974) (Tim Burstall)\n\nThe Cars That Ate Paris (1974) (Peter Weir)\n\nNumber 96 (1974) (Peter Benardos)\n\nThe Man From Hong Kong (1975) (Brian Trenchard-Smith, Yu Wang)\n\nNight of Fear (1973) and Inn Of The Damned (1975) (Terry Bourke)\n\nEliza Fraser (1976) (Tim Burstall)\n\nMad Dog Morgan (1976) (Philippe Mora)\n\nLong Weekend (1978) (Colin Eggleston)\n\nPatrick (1978) (Richard Franklin)\n\nMad Max (1979) (Dr George Miller)\n\nMiddlebrow\n\nNed Kelly (1970) (Tony Richardson)\n\nSunday Too Far Away (1975) (Ken Hannam)\n\nRide A Wild Pony (1975) (Don Chaffey)\n\nCaddie (1976) (Donald Crombie)\n\nStorm Boy (1976) (Henri Safran)\n\nDon’s Party (1976) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThe Mango Tree (1977) (Kevin James Dobson)\n\nHigh Rolling (1977) (Igor Auzins)\n\nThe F.J.

We will first look at the most significant films from each category, starting with the lowbrow films.\n\nLowbrow\n\nThe first successful Australian films of the 1970s were full of colourful language, sex, nudity and bad behaviour. The Tim Burstall films Stork (1971), Alvin Purple (1973) and Peterson (1974), and the Bruce Beresford films, The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) and Barry Mckenzie Holds His Own (1974), were all very popular and successful. This success persuaded other directors, producers and investors that there was a market for Australian films, and the local film industry was reborn.\n\nApart from films full of sex and nudity (like Eliza Fraser (1976) and Felicity (1979)) or exaggerating the bad behaviour of Australians abroad (like the Barry McKenzie films), other films falling under the ‘lowbrow’ or ‘exploitation’ category were:\n\naction films, and films full of fights and violence, such as The Man From Hong Kong (1975) and Mad Dog Morgan (1976);\n\ncar and biker films, such as Stone (1974), The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) and especially Mad Max (1979), were a popular sub-category of the action category;\n\nhorror films and thrillers, such as Inn Of The Damned (1975), Long Weekend (1978) and Patrick (1978).\n\nLet’s look at the major lowbrow films of the decade, in chronological order:\n\nStork (1971) (Tim Burstall)\n\nStork was the first commercial success of the Australian cinema revival. It was a marked contrast to the highbrow films of 1971 (Walkabout and Wake in Fright) in many respects: it was made with local money and local stars; it was an urban film which ignored the common preoccupation with the mythical outback; it was a light-hearted, satirical comedy-romp with gratuitous nudity; it touched on contemporary issues and captured the modern urban vernacular; and it was a box office hit, making $463,000 (equivalent to nearly $5 million today) on a budget of about A$60,000. The film starred Bruce Spence as ‘a six-foot-seven deranged revolutionary’ named Stork who throws in his job and rages against the system while wreaking chaos on his friends’ lives. The movie also starred Jacki Weaver in the debut of her long career and Graeme Blundell who would star in other Burstall features. Based on the debut hit-play by David Williamson, Australia’s premier playwright of the 1970s, the film was a vindication of Burstall’s decision to avoid serious dramas. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen Online).\n\nThe Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nBruce Beresford’s first film was written by Australian comedian Barry Humphreys (who also starred in the film as Barry’s aunt Edna Everage (a character which Humphreys developed over the decades to become Dame Edna the Housewife Superstar) and Beresford himself. It involved the adventures of Barry McKenzie, a young Australian (played by Barry Crocker), visiting London for the first time. This was an alternative vision of the ‘Ocker’ character envisioned by David Williamson and Tim Burstall in Stork, and this film was almost as successful as that film. In The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, Beresford and Humphreys set out to shock audiences with Barry McKenzie’s colourful Aussie slang, his constant denigration of the English, his uncouth, uproarious Aussie drinking sessions and a series of jokes about regurgitation and urination. It wasn’t subtle but it was entertaining and popular in both Australia and, surprisingly, in the UK. Beresford followed up with a sequel, Barry Mckenzie Holds His Own (1974), that was even more successful. (For more on The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, GRWCAF, Australian Screen Online).\n\nAlvin Purple (1973) (Tim Burstall)\n\nIn 1973, Tim Burstall released Alvin Purple, his follow-up film to Stork. Alvin was the first of his sex-romps, and starred Graeme Blundell as Alvin Purple a quiet young man who is sexually irresistible to women. During his sexual adventures, the ‘ reluctant super-stud’ was wooed by a variety of up-and-coming Australian actresses including Jacki Weaver, Penne Hackforth-Jones, Elli Maclure, Lynette Curran, Kris McQuade, Anne Scott-Pendlebury and Abigail, many of whom made their feature debuts in this film. The film mixed caper-comedy with nudity, sex, and chases and was an even bigger hit than Stork had been, making $4,720,000 (according to Screen Australia) which is equivalent to $42million today. This made it the most successful film of the 1970s. Burstall followed up with a successful sequel the following year: Alvin Rides Again (1974). (For more on Alvin Purple, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, GRWCAF, Australian Screen Online).\n\nStone (1974) (Sandy Harbutt)\n\nStone is a bikie-action film about an undercover cop who joins a bikie gang to solve a series of murders, and the film is notable for its numerous fights, massed bike rides, chases, accidents and stunts, plus lots of swearing and gratuitous sex and nudity, all with recognisable locations in and around Sydney. The film was a big success (taking over $1.5 million at the box office) but divided the critics, probably due to its ‘outlaw’ appeal. However it quickly became a cult film. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, GRWCAF, Ozmovies).\n\nPetersen (1974) (Tim Burstall)\n\nTim Burstall, the man of the era, released his third successful film Petersen in 1974. The film starred Jack Thompson as Petersen, an electrician who decided to go to University and extend himself. The film was not really the sex-romp that Alvin Purple had been, but rather a light-hearted drama with a dash of politics and a large serving of sex and nudity. The film also starred Jacki Weaver and Wendy Hughes, as Thompson’s wife and lover respectively, and established Jack Thompson as the principal male star and sex-symbol of the mid-70s. The film was again successful for Burstall and gained a rare release in the USA and UK. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen Online).\n\nThe Cars That Ate Paris (1974) (Peter Weir)\n\nIn 1974, Peter Weir made his first full-length feature film The Cars That Ate Paris, after having won AFI awards for his two previous short-features. The film, about the population of a sinister country town that preyed on passing traffic by causing accidents and scavenging the wrecked cars, was in the unsettling, mysterious style that was becoming his trademark. The film featured a variety of weird and wonderful vehicles, which obsessed rival gangs as they held their threatening drag races up and down the main street of the village. The obsession with exotic cars was later echoed in Dr. George Miller’s Mad Max series of films, though Miller added an apocalyptic element. The Cars That Ate Paris featured John Meillon, Bruce Spence, and Max Gillies and also marked the debut of the perennially-cockney stirrer Chris Haywood. The film was a costly failure at cinemas, but impressed the critics and became a cult favourite. Weir would have to wait until Picnic at Hanging Rock the following year to establish his reputation as Australia’s top director. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, GRWCAF, Australian Screen Online).\n\nNumber 96 (1974) (Peter Benardos)\n\nThis film was a spinoff of a popular TV show, Number 96, that ran for five nights a week from 1972 to 1977. The show was a late-night adults-only soap opera, and broke new ground for Australian television by showing frequent nudity, unmarried sex and promiscuity, and by its inclusion of a sympathetic non-effeminate gay man as one of the main characters. The show consisted of the interlocking stories of the various inhabitants of the apartment building, and mixed comedy, drama, farce and melodrama to popular effect. The film is like a big-screen extended TV episode, and was popular on release with the show’s many fans, making millions at the box-office. The film did not include the show’s most famous character, the sex-symbol Bev Houghton (Abigail) who had recently left the show, but Rebecca Gilling fills in as the ‘bad girl’ flight attendant Diana Moore, and she has the main nude scenes in the movie. (For more on this film, see : IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Number 96 Homepage, ATIA, NFSA).\n\nThe Man From Hong Kong (1975) (Brian Trenchard-Smith, Yu Wang)\n\nThe action-adventure film The Man From Hong Kong was the main Ozploitation film of 1975, and set a high standard for cheesy Oz-action films to follow. The film, an Australian-Hong Kong co-production, came during the 70s kung-fu craze that followed Bruce Lee’s Enter the Dragon (1973), and starred Hong Kong kung-fu star Jimmy Wang Yu as a detective, who comes to Australia to work with Australian police and break open a drug syndicate. The film contains endless fights and stunts in and around Sydney, as Yu beats up crowds of bad guys, breaks furniture, crashes cars and beds the local girls. The film also stars George ‘Australia’s James Bond’ Lazenby as the arch-villain, and has roles for local actors Bill Hunter, Hugh Keays-Byrne and Roger Ward. The film made over $1 million at the box office in Australia, as well as an unknown amount in Hong Kong and Asia. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith made his debut with this film, and its success allowed him to go on to make over twenty feature films, many of which have become infamous. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nNight of Fear (1973) and Inn Of The Damned (1975) (Terry Bourke)\n\nNight of Fear, was a sex-horror short-feature (54 minutes) about a woman alone and terrorised in the bush. It was originally made for TV but was released in cinemas when the ABC rejected it. The film did fairly well at cinemas both in Australia and overseas, and established a strong Australian tradition of Oz-horror-thrillers, of which hundreds have been made over subsequent years. Inn of the Damned was Terry Bourke’s follow-up, and was another horror film about an isolated inn where visitors met grizzly ends. It starred Dame Judith Anderson, John Meillon, Tony Bonner and Phil Avalon. (For more on Night of Fear see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies; for more on Inn of the Damned, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nEliza Fraser (1976) (Tim Burstall)\n\nEliza Fraser was a bawdy, big-budget, period sex-comedy about an independent woman in the convict era. Sussanah Yorke played the wife of a ship’s captain, who sails to Australia, where she has an affair with a handsome convict before being shipwrecked and living with an Aboriginal tribe. The film also starred John Waters, Gerard Kennedy and many other familiar local actors. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nMad Dog Morgan (1976) (Philippe Mora)\n\nMad Dog Morgan was an interesting post-60s take on the Australian bushranger story, and starred American actor Dennis Hopper, who was at the time transitioning from his young rebel persona of Easy Rider to his crazy man persona of Blue Velvet and later flicks. Hopper combined these two personas in his portrayal of an Aussie-Irish bushranger and the result is an interesting, if uneven, film, directed by a French immigrant to Australia, Philippe Mora, who had been an artist and experimental film-maker since the 1960s. The film didn’t do well in Australia, but was released in the US and is now something of cult-classic. Mora was nominated for AFI’s Best Director Award for the film. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nLong Weekend (1978) (Colin Eggleston)\n\nA bickering couple, whose marriage is in trouble, take a camping trip (his choice, not hers) on an isolated beach to try and get their marriage back on track, but find their abuse of nature reciprocated. The suspense gradually builds as the couple manage to despoil their little Eden until it gradually seems that Mother Nature and all her creatures have turned against the couple. Peter Hargreaves, one of Australia’s best 70s actors, and Briony Behets, are excellent in this Man Vs Nature cult-flick. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nPatrick (1978) (Richard Franklin)\n\nPatrick was the most significant Oz-horror film of the decade and the third feature by director Richard Franklin after two sexploitation films. In this film, Patrick is a comatose mental patient who uses his telekinetic powers to terrify those who threaten to come between him and his favourite nurse. Franklin, who was a big fan of Hitchcock, uses suspense, surprise, and humour to great effect in this film, which became a cult-classic in Australia and abroad. Though the film did not perform very well initially at the cinema, it has become more popular over the years. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nMad Max (1979) (Dr George Miller)\n\nMad Max is the tale of one man’s fight for justice and vengeance in a future world where oil is running out and everything is slipping into chaos. It was a landmark action film starring Mel Gibson in one of his first films, and his performance helped catapult him to a Hollywood career. The film is notable for its ground-breaking stunts and chase scenes with hot cars and motorbikes, as stunt director Grant Page set a new standard for spectacular action scenes. It is the debut film of George Miller who has become Australia’s most successful director internationally. Miller went on to make three wildly successful sequels to Mad Max, and to then intriguingly produce and direct the equally successful animated children’s films Babe and Happy Feet. Mad Max divided the critics but was a hit with audiences all over the world, and was the most successful Australian film of 1979, as well as the first Australian film of the revival to make significant money overseas. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nMiddlebrow\n\nThis group of films still aimed at attracting mass audiences, but stayed away from both the exploitation of the lowbrow films above, as well as the artistic and intellectual pretensions of the highbrow films of the last section. Instead, these films included something for all the family: action without too much violence; romance without too much explicit nudity and sex; and drama without extremes of bad taste or metaphysical speculation. In the main, these films found an audience and some rated among of the most popular films of the decade. Sunday Too Far Away was the first success for a serious drama, and won the AFI Best Film Award. Other popular dramas, family films, comedies and romances followed, with various degrees of success.\n\nNed Kelly (1970) (Tony Richardson)\n\nMick Jagger, at the height of his Rolling Stones fame, plays the famous rebel bushranger, Ned Kelly. Filmed in historic Braidwood, NSW, rather than in Victoria where the real Kelly mainly roamed, by British director Tony Richardson, this production used mainly local actors, including Ken Shorter and Frank Thring. The film was the most successful Australian film of the year, but received mixed views from critics, who didn’t much like Jagger’s wry performance. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nSunday Too Far Away (1975) (Ken Hannam)\n\nSunday Too Far Away is a film about a group of (sheep) shearers working on an outback farm in the 1950s, and was the first serious local drama to be successful in the 1970s. The film starred Jack Thompson as the main shearer and included an impressive cast of other Australian actors who became the backbone of Australian TV and film for many years. The film captured not only the mateship but the difficult life of shearers in the heat of the outback, in a way that resonated with audiences in Australia. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nRide A Wild Pony (1975) (Don Chaffey)\n\nRide a Wild Pony was a big-budget Walt Disney story about kids and ponies filmed in Australia. Based on a novel by Australian James Aldridge, and made with a British director, Don Chaffey, the cast was mainly Australian, including the main child star Robert Bettles. The picture was successful enough for Disney to return to Australian in 1976 to make another movie-for-television about horses, Born to Run (aka Harness Fever). (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nCaddie (1976) (Donald Crombie)\n\nCaddie was the surprise hit of 1976. Directed by Donald Crombie, it was another woman-centred film (like Picnic at Hanging Rock) and was a period drama about a resourceful woman’s struggle to support herself and her kids after leaving her abusive husband in the 1920s. The film starred Helen Morse in her first lead role (she also played in Picnic at Hanging Rock) as well as Jackie Weaver and Jack Thompson. Helen Morse won the AFI best actress award, and the film won best supporting actress and actor awards for Jackie Weaver and Drew Forsythe. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nStorm Boy (1976) (Henri Safran)\n\nStorm Boy was another film that broke new ground for Australian films: it was a wilderness film, but set on the windswept coast of the South Australian Coorong rather than the Outback; it was about a lonely ten-year-old boy and his pet pelican, and it was directed by French immigrant Henri Safran. Safran brought a new sensibility and an outsider’s eye to Australia, and the film was loved by adults and children alike. The film also involved the child’s friendship with a roaming young Aboriginal man (played by David Gulpilil of Walkabout). The film was exported to dozens of countries around the world who could relate to the child’s love of his bird. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nDon’s Party (1976) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nDon’s Party was Bruce Beresford’s third Australian film and was an adaptation of another David Williamson play, about a group of Australian middle-class friends at a 1969 election party getting comically drunk, lecherous and abusive as it becomes obvious that the expected victory will not eventuate. The film captures and satirises both the language and the concerns of the Australian middle-class in the 1970s with typical Williamson wit and energy. The film showed that Beresford could make more sophisticated films than his early Barry McKenzie ocker comedies, and he went on to make a number of wonderful Australian films, before moving to Hollywood. Don’s Party is a film that could just as easily fit into the highbrow or lowbrow category, but middlebrow seemed most appropriate. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nThe Mango Tree (1977) (Kevin James Dobson)\n\nThe Mango Tree is a nostalgic coming-of-age film about a boy in his last year at school in a small tropical town in North Queensland after his father has been killed in World War One. The film was based on a Miles Franklin Award-winning book by Ronald McKie, but, while the North Queensland scenery of canefields and tropical forest is interesting, the film fails to capture the depth of the book. The main problems are the weaknesses of producer Michael Pate’s screenplay and his son Christopher Pate’s acting. Nevertheless, the film was the second most popular Australian film of the year. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nHigh Rolling (1977) (Igor Auzins)\n\nHigh Rolling (aka High Rolling in a Hot Corvette) is a contemporary road-movie/comedy about the misadventures a couple of young blokes travelling to the Gold Coast. It produced by Tim Burstall and directed by Igor Auzins. Starring little-known American actor Joseph Bottoms and a bunch of Australians including Wendy Hughes, the film is today best remembered as Judy Davis’ first film, made while she was still a NIDA student. The film performed reasonably at the box office, but was not the hit for which Burstall and Auzins were hoping. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nThe F.J. Holden (1977) (Michael Thornhill)\n\nThe F.J. Holden is a contemporary light drama about working-class kids in Bankstown in Sydney’s western suburbs. Directed by Michael Thornhill, the film did reasonably well, and was even chosen as one of the ‘100 Greatest Australian films of all time’ in Scott Hocking’s 2006 book. Though it looks a bit flat and dull now, it does provide an insight into the urban working class of the era. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen Online).\n\nMoney Movers (1979) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nMoney Movers is a crime caper/action film with a complex plot of twists and turns, and a big cast including Edward Devereaux, Charles Tingwell, Jeanie Drynan and Bryan Brown. It was Bruce Beresford’s fifth movie of the decade and saw him attempting yet another genre, but it was his least successful film of the decade. It is an entertaining film that walks a line between comedy and thriller. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies, Australian Screen Online).\n\nThe Odd Angry Shot (1979) (Tom Jeffrey)\n\nThe Odd Angry Shot is a drama about a group of Australian soldiers sent to the Vietnam war, and it is one of very few Australian war films. The film is closer in tone to MASH than Platoon, with the soldier’s cynical humour while not fighting as much in the frame as the action segments. A strong cast included Graham Kennedy (in a rare semi-serious role for Australia’s top TV comedian), John Hargreaves, John Jarratt, Bryan Brown and Graeme Blundell. The film was director Tom Jeffrey’s third, last and most successful film, as well being the third-most successful Australian film of the year. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nThe Plumber (1979) (Peter Weir)\n\nThe Plumber is a comedy-thriller about a plumber who comes to check the plumbing an academic woman’s university apartment and spends days taking the bathroom apart while the woman tries to work with a growing sense of unease. The film is Peter Weir’s fourth feature of the decade, and captures the disquiet of Judy Morris as the academic and the unspoken menace of the cheery workman, as the work drags on. This film was originally shown on television in Australia before gaining a cinematic release in the USA. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nTim (1979) (Michael Pate)\n\nTim is a romantic drama about an affair between a middle-aged woman and a handsome but intellectually-challenged young man played by Mel Gibson. Based on a popular book by Colleen McCullough, the film was directed by actor Michael Pate, who had produced The Mango Tree (1977). The film did reasonably well at the box office and was even released overseas, though critical opinion was mixed. The film was the only directorial attempt of Michael Pate (who also adapted the novel and produced the film). After this, Sydney-born Pate returned to his acting career, a career which already stretched back nearly 40 years and covered almost 150 roles in film and TV in Australia and the US. (For more on this film, see IMDb, Wikipedia, Ozmovies).\n\nHighbrow\n\nThere were a number of ‘quality’ films with high artistic values made in Australia in the 1970s. The first two of these, Walkabout and Wake in Fright, both made in 1971, were foreign productions which looked at Australia and Australians with an outsider’s eye. Neither was successful in Australia, but aroused some interest overseas, particularly amongst arthouse enthusiasts. Both have since become regarded as classics.\n\nIn 1975, Australian director Peter Weir released Picnic at Hanging Rock which was received with enthusiasm by both Australian audiences, who marvelled that such sophistication could be found in a local film, and foreign critics, who realised that the Australian film industry was capable of producing complex, subtle and beautiful films. The success of Picnic encouraged other Australian directors to make a series of high quality films which examined Australia’s history and people as never before. Weir, along with Bruce Beresford, Fred Schepisi, Phil Noyce and Gillian Armstrong, created a body of arthouse films that were both commercially successful and critically admired.\n\nWalkabout (1971) (Nicolas Roeg)\n\nWalkabout was a British production directed by British ex-cinematographer and auteur Nicolas Roeg, who was making only his second film as director. Walkabout starred British child star Jenny Aguter as well as Roeg’s young son John as two white children lost in the desert, helped to survive by a young Aboriginal man, played by newcomer David Gulpilil. This expressionist film captures the beauty of the desert like no film before it (and few since), as well as the inter-cultural misunderstanding between the two adolescents. The film was met with mixed reviews from the critics and incomprehension from the public in Australia and overseas, but has come to be seen as one of the landmarks of Australian cinema, being listed as the top Australian film in Halliwell’s Top 1000: The Ultimate Movie Countdown (2005) and included on numerous world best film lists. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nWake in Fright (1971) (Ted Kotcheff)\n\nThe tale of a young teacher from Sydney, working at an isolated one-teacher school in outback NSW who tries to get back to Sydney for the summer holidays, but gets stranded in a rough outback town full of drunken, rowdy larrikins, and gets slowly drawn into their lifestyle. Wake in Fright, was released shortly after Walkabout, and offered an entirely different perspective on the Australian Outback. The film’s production was a mixed affair with American finance, a UK-based Canadian director (Ted Kotcheff), British and Australian actors and a story from Australian-based British author Kenneth Cook, though it is generally considered an American production. The film offered a darker view of the Australian bush and Australian mateship, presenting outback males as crude, drunken and violent. The film starred Brits Gary Bond and Donald Pleasance, as well as Australians Chips Rafferty (in his last film), Jack Thomson (in his debut), John Meillon and many others. Like Walkabout, the film was negatively received by Australian critics and the public, but better liked in Europe, particularly France. The production company (NLT) folded after this film, and the negative of the film was lost for over 30 years. The film was rediscovered and restored and re-released in 2009 to critical acclaim. Like Walkabout, it is considered an Australian classic and is included on numerous world best film lists. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock (1975) (Peter Weir)\n\nThe first Australian production in this category, Picnic at Hanging Rock was the vision of Peter Weir, who became Australia’s most famous director. Adapted from Joan Lindsay’s novel, the film reveals the mystery of three schoolgirls and a teacher from a rural boarding school who disappear during a picnic at Hanging Rock in Victoria on Saint Valentine’s Day 1900. Weir’s wonderfully evocative and atmospheric film looks at the mythic nature of the Australian bush, at late Victorian Australian attempts to recreate Victorian England, at adolescent girls with their intimacy and their dreams, and the ability of the Australian landscape to swallow up intruders. This film is a landmark in the history of Australian film-making: it was our first successful art-house film, and it was our most sophisticated attempt at cinema up to that time. Only Walkabout (1971) is more highly regarded by international commentators. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nThe Devil’s Playground (1976) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nYoung Catholic schoolboys at a Catholic boarding seminary try to make sense of the world, but are subjected to repressive ideas of sin and shame, particularly in relation to sex. The film also looks at the lives of the Catholic brothers who also suffer from the ideas they inflict on the boys. This film marked Fred Schepisi’s arrival as one of Australia’s great 70s directors, and won the 1976 AFI awards for best film and best director. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nThe Last Wave (1977) (Peter Weir)\n\nThe Last Wave was Peter Weir’s follow-up film to Picnic at Hanging Rock and was the most popular Australian film of the year. The film, about a white lawyer in contemporary Sydney defending a group of Aboriginal men accused of murder, is imbued with a sense of mystery, as the lawyer is drawn into a world of Aboriginal Dreamtime spirituality and a sense of an approaching apocalypse. Starring English actor Richard Chamberlain and David Gulpilil in another great performance, the film showed again Weir’s fascination with mystery and unease to create a world where man is at the mercy of nature and unseen spiritual forces. (For more on this film, see here).\n\nThe Getting Of Wisdom (1977) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThe Getting of Wisdom was the third major ‘women’s film’ to appear in three years, indicating a major shift in the focus of Australian film-making. Set in the 1890s and based on Henry Handel Richardson’s novel, the film tells the story of a teenage girl, Laura Rambotham, who is sent from her isolated farm to attend boarding school in Melbourne, where she tries to fit into the society of richer girls. The era was beautifully realised by Bruce Beresford, whose continued growth as a director was evident, and by cinematographer Donald McAlpine, who also later went to Hollywood. As well as an outstanding performance by Susannah Fowle in the lead, the film also included other young actors who would later achieve fame including Sigrid Thornton, Kerry Armstrong, and John Waters. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nThe Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nThe Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith was Fred Schepisi’s second film and came after the critical success of his debut The Devil’s Playground. It is the story of an Aboriginal man, Jimmie Blacksmith who, after trying to adapt to white society, rebels against the constant insults and discrimination he suffers and attacks his employer’s family. He reacts violently before escaping into the bush where he is relentlessly pursued by the authorities. The film is based upon a Thomas Keneally novel which was based on the real story of Jimmy Governor who massacred five women at Breelong in 1900 under similar circumstances. The film starred unknown Aboriginal actor Tommy Lewis as Jimmie Blacksmith, as well as Jack Thompson, Ray Barrett, Angela Punch-McGregor (as Jimmie’s white wife) and Ruth Cracknell. The film received positive reviews, though some reviewers baulked at the violence of the story (even though the violence was not at all sensationalised). The film captures colonial Australia and its racist attitudes strongly, and was one of the first Australian films to portray the story of white treatment of our Indigenous people. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nNewsfront (1978) (Phil Noyce)\n\nNewsfront was Phil Noyce’s second film. The film was a drama about a news team filming newsreels around Australia for release in the cinemas before the main features. The film has a cracking cast with Bill Hunter given a rare lead role as the main cameraman, supported by Chris Haywood, Bryan Brown, Gerard Kennedy, Wendy Hughes, Angela Punch-McGregor and many others. The film successfully captured the era and told an engaging story of journalists trying to keep their company afloat in the face of American competition and the arrival of television.\n\nIn the years after World War Two, a group of journalists in Sydney travel the country to produce weekly newsreels to be shown in cinemas. They face competition from other local and overseas companies, as technology and the arrival of television threaten to end their business. This film is blessed with a strong cast including Bill Hunter (in a rare lead role), Gerard Kennedy, Wendy Hughes, Bryan Brown, Angela Punch McGregor and Chris Haywood. The film was a commercial and critical success: it was the most successful Australian film of the year at the box office and won the AFI Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Bill Hunter) and Best Supporting Actress (Angela Punch-McGregor). The film captured the spirit and details of post-war Australian society, its politics and personal relations, and the effect on Australia of the arrival of migrants more successfully than They’re A Weird Mob had a decade previously. Newsfront was Phil Noyce’s breakout film established him as another of our great 1970s generation of directors (along with Weir, Beresford, Schepisi, Miller and Armstrong) who would move to Hollywood in the 1980s. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nMy Brilliant Career (1979) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nMy Brilliant Career is an adaptation of Australian woman author Miles Franklin’s 1901 novel about a headstrong young woman in 19th century Australia forced to choose between marriage and a career as a writer. The film, by Gillian Armstrong, was the first major Australian film by a woman director since 1930. My Brilliant Career starred Judy Davis in her first leading role, as well as New Zealander Sam Neill in the first of his many Australian films. Davis went on to a successful career, making 12 Australian films (and winning a record 8 AFI acting awards) as well as over 20 films in the US and the UK. The film inspired future generations of Australian women directors and actresses, and the following decades would see many more Oz women directors make films and dozens of internationally successful Australian actresses. The film was popular with critics and won the AFI awards for Best Film and Best Direction. It was the second most successful Australian film of the year at the box office domestically and also did well in the US and elsewhere. Though Judy Davis somehow missed out on the AFI Best Actress Award, she won a BAFTA when the film was shown in the UK the following year. Armstrong went on to make another four exciting Australian features and four Hollywood films, including the very successful Little Women (1994), plus a number of documentaries. (For more on this film, see here.)\n\nThe 1970s at the Australian Box Office\n\nThe Australian box office figures for the 1970s show the importance of the Ocker/Ozploitation movement, and particularly Tim Burstall, in the rebirth of Australian cinema at the box office. Burstall’s sex-romps (Alvin Purple, Alvin Rides Again, Petersen and Eliza Fraser) were extremely successful, as were Bruce Beresford’s Barry McKenzie Ocker comedies in 1972 and 1974. After the success of these entertaining films, Australians started watching more serious dramas such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Caddie, Storm Boy, My Brilliant Career, Sunday Too Far Away and Newsfront in the second half of the 70s.\n\nHere are the top 26 Australian 1970s films at the Australian box office (the figure in round brackets is the equivalent in 2016 dollars; the figure in square brackets is the all-time ranking):\n\nAlvin Purple (Burstall) (1973) $4,720,000 ($42,291,200) [7]\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock (Weir) (1975) $5,120,000 ($34,611,200) [12]\n\nMad Max (Miller) (1979) $5,355,490 ($24,099,705) [21]\n\nNumber 96 (Benardos) (1974) $2,858,306 ($22,494,868) [23]\n\nCaddie (Crombie) (1976) $2,847,000 ($16,968,120) [30]\n\nStorm Boy (Safran) (1976) $2,645,000 ($15,764,200) [35]\n\nAlvin Rides Again (Bilock/Copping/Burstall) (1974) $1,880,000 ($14,645,200) [38]\n\nMy Brilliant Career (Armstrong) (1979) $3,052,000 ($13,734,000) [40]\n\nStone (Harbutt) (1974) $1,572,000 ($12,245,880) [44]\n\nBarry Mckenzie Holds His Own (Beresford) (1974) $1,407,000 ($10,960,530) [52]\n\nPetersen (Burstall) (1974) $1,363,000 ($10,617,770) [54]\n\nEliza Fraser (Burstall) (1976) $1,672,000 ($9,965,120) [56]\n\nThe Adventures of Barry McKenzie (Beresford) (1972) $1,000,000 ($9,790,000) [57]\n\nSunday Too Far Away (Hannam) (1975) $1,356,000 ($9,166,560) [61]\n\nNed Kelly (Richardson) (1970) $808,000 ($8,904,160) [62]\n\nNewsfront (Noyce) (1978) $1,576,000 ($7,738,160) [71]\n\nThe Man From Hong Kong (Trenchard-Smith) (1975) $1,066,000 ($7,291,440) [83]\n\nThe Last Wave (Weir) (1977) $1,258,000 ($6,755,460) [86]\n\nRide A Wild Pony (1975) $949,000 ($6,491,160) [92]\n\nThe Box (1975) (857,000 ($5,861,880) [95]\n\nThe Mango Tree (1977) (Pate) $1,028,000 ($5,520,360) [102]\n\nThe Getting Of Wisdom (Beresford) (1977) $982,000 ($5,273,340) [105]\n\nDon’s Party (Beresford) (1976) $871,000 ($5,252,130) [106]\n\nThe Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (Schepisi) (1978) $1,021,000 ($5,074,370) [108]\n\nStork (Burstall) (1971) $463,000 ($4,866,130) [114]\n\nHigh Rolling (1977) $841,000 ($4,516,170) [121]\n\nOzflicks’ 35 Favourite Australian Films of the 1970s\n\nHere are my personal favourites from the 1970s:\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock (1975) (Peter Weir)\n\nWalkabout (1971) (Nicolas Roeg)\n\nMy Brilliant Career (1979) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nWake in Fright (1971) (Ted Kotcheff)\n\nNewsfront (1978) (Phillip Noyce)\n\nDon’s Party (1976) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nStorm Boy (1976) (Henri Safran)\n\nThe Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nSunday Too Far Away (1975) (Ken Hannam)\n\nThe Devil’s Playground (1976) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nMad Max (1979) (Dr. George Miller)\n\nThe Getting of Wisdom (1978) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThe Removalists (1975) (Tom Jeffrey)\n\nLong Weekend (1978) (Colin Eggleston)\n\nMad Dog Morgan (1976) (Philippe Mora)\n\nPatrick (1978) (Richard Franklin)\n\nThe Man From Hong Kong (1975) (Brian Trenchard-Smith)\n\nThe Last Wave (1977) (Peter Weir)\n\nThe Picture Show Man (1977) (John Power)\n\nThe Odd Angry Shot (1979) (Tom Jeffrey)\n\nIn Search of Anna (1979) (Esben Storm)\n\nCaddie (1976) (Donald Crombie)\n\nThe Plumber (1979) (Peter Weir)\n\nEliza Fraser (1976) (Tim Burstall)\n\nBackroads (1977) (Phillip Noyce)\n\nPalm Beach (1979) (Albie Thoms)\n\nCathy’s Child (1979) (Donald Crombie)\n\nEndplay (1976) (Tim Burstall)\n\nMoney Movers (1978) (Bruce Bersford)\n\nKostas (1979) (Paul Cox)\n\nThe Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nDimboola (1979) (John Duigan)\n\nThe Night, the Prowler (1978) (Jim Sharman)\n\nMouth to Mouth (1978) (John Duigan)\n\nLibido (1973) (John B.
