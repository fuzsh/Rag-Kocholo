        "text": "''PICTURE SHOW MAN,'' a 1977 Australian film now having its American premiere at the Thalia, is so chipper it positively chirps. Chronicling the adventures of pioneer movie exhibitors who travel from town to town unreeling silent films, it's a pleasant movie trying hard to be a merry one. Like many of the overlooked films the Thalia launches, this one demonstrates both the good intentions that justify unearthing it, and the lack of oomph that accounts for its previous obscurity.\n\n''Picture Show Man'' was directed by John Powers and officially stars Rod Taylor, but in fact Mr. Taylor has a supporting role. He plays a more successful movie showman who turns up, from time to time, to needle the three principals who run Pym's Traveling Picture Show. They are Freddie (John Ewart), a jaunty piano player with an uncanny talent for finding the lady who is ''starved for musical companionship since my husband died'' in any given town; Larry (Harold Hopkins), a nice young man with a strong jaw; and Pop Pym (John Meillon), the snake oil salesman-type who runs the show.\n\nPop Pym also doubles as an entertainer, whenever the projector (hand-cranked by Larry) breaks down. At the beginning of the story, in one of its nicer moments, he sings a song that's delightfully outmoded, even for the film's era. Accompanied by some very silly flourishes, it goes: ''I am a desert prince, a sheik/You are a woman, frail and weak/I want to pinch you on the cheek/Because I love you!'' In time, Freddie is able to persuade Pop to drop this from his repertory.\n\nSome of the funding for ''Picture Show Man'' came from a feminist group, according to the closing credits. That may account for its being full of noble, commendable, independent-minded female characters, who provide its only touch of the unexpected. Larry's sweetheart, for instance, isn't a bit bashful when she first meets Larry, even though both are bathing au naturel at the time; if anything, it's he who is embarrassed. Later on, her father appears, to announce that he has raised his daughter as if she were a son so that she will never have to depend on a mere man for her livelihood. In a similar vein, the movie stops short to offer occasional film history touches, as when Larry explains how ether and oxygen help run the projector. As interjected by Mr. Powers, these details are more instructive than entertaining."
