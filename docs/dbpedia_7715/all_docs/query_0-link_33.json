        "text": "Movies movies movies. I’m not addicted. YOU’RE addicted.\n\nChuck Vincent’s Warrior Queen (1987) stars Sybil Danning as a noblewoman in ancient Pompeii wandering from one curtains and balsa wood set to another until Vesuvius erupts. What could have been (and should have been) a Titanic-esque ticking time bomb of Roman intrigue and feminism-tinged political drama building until historical inevitability, ultimately sidesteps all this potential for more lascivious ambitions. What’s a handier Deus ex machina than a volcano erupting? Give us tension. Give us prophecy. Instead, the film just sort drifts shapelessly between gratuitous rape scenes and pilfered footage from other movies. Also stars an especially yucky Donald Pleasence.\n\n🎃 A crazed cartoonist unleashes true evil when it turns out his inked artwork brings ghouls to life! It’s a premise that’s been done, but, as a cartoonist myself, it’s one I can get behind. Cellar Dweller (1987) squanders its concept, in part, by killing off reliable horror mainstay Jeffrey Combs in the first two minutes and leaving us with the much less engaging or likeable Debrah Farentino as the new plucky cartoonist. The monster is rather lazy and doesn’t do much beyond nonchalantly chewing. The art school setting could have been nice (Munsters star Yvonne De Carlo plays the cartoon-hating Mrs. Briggs, who runs the retreat). Alas, a mostly boring and witless nothing of a flick, but the fiery finale was so silly and incomprehensible that it became pretty funny.\n\nLeslie Nielsen’s entire career trajectory changed after 1980’s Airplane. The serious actor had amazing comedy chops. The Naked Gun series, would be his highlights. After that, you get weaker flicks like Wrongfully Accused, Dracula: Dead and Loving It, and Spy Hard (1996). I watched all these on TV as a kid because Leslie Nielsen’s deadpan idiot character was funny, even if the movies weren’t great. Spy Hard has a lot of gags, and maybe 10% of them work (and most of that is owed to Weird Al Yankovic’s Bond-style song at the start of the movie). I can handle bad jokes you can see coming a mile away and hot bimbos being hot, but to me it’s just depressing to see old guys like Andy Griffith, Charles Durning, and Barry Bostwick giving career-worst performances, and simply unable to rise to Nielsen’s comic level. Spy Hard is a weird hybrid of feeling lazy while also being exhausting for how much it throws at you (but ultimately unsatisfying with how little sticks). You’ll get your fix for Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, and Fabio cameos, I guess.\n\nThe plot to Xanadu (1980) is something. An artist (Michael Beck), whose job is to repaint existing posters exactly but bigger, gets fed up because he wants to be a real artist. He quits his job, but also hates making stuff by himself. But his lack of inspiration causes several muses to pop out of some graffiti (the main muse played by Olivia Newton-John). Instead of inspiring the artist, she just kind of rollerskates around, and he becomes obsessed with her and wants to bang her. Enter 68-year old Gene Kelly as some sort of retired clarinet millionaire. The artist tells him he should open the club he’s always wanted to, and they decide to make it an upsetting combination of a 1940s big band dance theater and 1980s rock and roll club. Still not sure where the muse fits into any of this. The club Gene Kelly opens at the end makes no sense and is scary actually.\n\nOh, and it’s also a musical. Written by Electric Light Orchestra. Don’t get too excited. There’s way more rollerskating than singing.\n\n🎃 Stephen King’s directorical outing owes a lot to his muse: cocaine. Maximum Overdrive (1986) asks us to imagine a world where cars come to life and want to kill us sometimes. OK. Done. What now? Well, now you have to contend with being stuck in a gas station with a completely devoid-of-charisma Emilio Estevez. But fret not! What Estevez lacks here in charisma, he more than makes up for in being sweaty. Maximum Overdrive has some fun car stuff at times, but is such an aggressively brainless movie that it’s actually impressive that it is watchable at all.\n\nWhat a weird movie. Fun and Fancy Free (1947) is an anthology with only two stories, and multiple narrators with multiple bookend schticks. It starts out as a tale told by Jiminy Cricket (who has apparently been alive since the 1880s when Pinocchio takes place). He tells the story of a circus bear named Bongo who returns to the forest. Not really into the story of Bongo or the apocryphal bear lore of romantic slapping, but it’s nicely animated and fine.\n\nThen it shifts narrator perspectives when Jiminy reads a little girl’s mail (illegal, by the way) and decides to secrety crash her party across the street (not cool, Jiminy). The party is creepy as hell. It’s a live action segment where radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his puppets, the snarky Charlie McCarthy and mentally challenged Mortimer Snerd, are entertaining the child actor Luana Patten. Jiminy Cricket doesn’t really do much beyond touch their food and listen to the story. Call the police, Jiminy. Luana was invited to a puppet man’s house at night without a legal guardian. This is not normal.\n\nMickey and the Beanstalk is far from my favorite Mickey cartoons, but it has a psychotically unhinged Donald Duck and that’s always funny. I also appreciate the grander scope of this tight adventure. Really not digging Walt Disney’s voicing of Mickey here. Missing that youthful spunk. I like the harp’s song and the vine growing sequence and Donald’s manic freakout where he tries to murder a cow with an axe. Good stuff.\n\nFor me the real irksome thing is the Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy stuff interrupting Mickey and the Beanstalk. I’ve never really liked Bergen and McCarthy (they ruin W.C. Fields’ You Can’t Cheat an Honest Man for me)\n\nHere’s where I had to do a bit of research. I remember watching the Mickey and the Beanstalk segment on a VHS taped off of TV as a kid. It was narrated not by Bergen, but by Sterling Holloway (Kaa, Winnie the Pooh, the Cheshire Cat, etc.). This version makes a few edits. I also recall another version narrated by Ludwig von Drake (maybe my favorite minor Disney character), which makes a few different edits. I like Holloway’s cozy read, and there’s something anachronistically charming about the von Drake stuff (animated and recorded a few decades after the original short). Then I discover there is yet ANOTHER version of the Mickey and the Beanstalk narration. With Shari Lewis and Lambchop! I guess they wanted to stick with the original ventriloquism vibe. I have not seen it, but would like to find it.\n\nMiracles (1989) is apparently Jackie Chan’s favorite film he’s done. And I can understand why. It’s got some great period costumes, gangster shootouts, excellently choreographed action fight scenes, and Anita Mui. But not enough. It’s more of a cheeky comedy melodrama than a straight action movie. I love a good Jackie Chan flick, and the fights that are present are great, but I guess we just weren’t in the mood for a farce. Give us more action. Or at least a few more songs.\n\n🎃 In The Addiction (1995) Abel Ferrara uses vampires as a metaphor for heroine addiction and also as a metaphor for losing faith in this slowburn drama that serves mainly as a place for Ferrara to plug in all of his favorite quotes and concepts from an Intro to Philosophy course. There’s some good stuff in here, but it’s weighed down by how overwrought and philosophically eloquent everyone is about everything at all times. Also, the constant images of real world death are a bit much. I get it. Mankind is the real vampire. Or something. Lily Taylor, as a grad student who is becoming a vampire (aka a heroine addict, aka an annoying 13 year old atheist), will be waxing philosophical and then BAM. We hard cut to piles of real corpses in Vietnam and Holocaust. And stay on them for a long time.\n\nPerhaps a bit too soaked in Catholic guilt for some, but I do sort of admire Ferrara working out his demons so nakedly. Also, nobody hams up a scene like Christopher Walken when he wants to.\n\nI love Bob Hoskins as well as peeks into Roma culture (although Emir Kusturica is the real filmmaker to check out for that). I watched The Raggedy Rawney (1988) because it’s one of the few movies Bob Hoskins directed. It’s a wartime drama about a young boy (Dexter Fletcher) who runs away from the army, poses as an insane witch woman (a “raggedy rawney”), and fenagles his way into a gypsy camp. I wish we got a little more more into the head of the titular character. He’s the character the movie keeps at the furthest distance. The drama is good, Bob Hoskins’ mustache is luscious, it’s got some solid actors doing good work (Zoë Wanamaker, Zoë Natheson, and Ian McNiece), and a moving finale.\n\nIt is sensitive mode Hoskins, and I wonder why he wanted to tell this particular story. It’s good, but don’t expect a Long Good Friday or Mona Lisa type of mad dog performance from the guy.\n\nSo much of 70s Australian cinema is just warning people not to go. “We’re weirdos here, mate. Real sickos,” they told us. Everthing’s dusty and hot and distant and the folks in the smaller towns, well, they’re all mad. The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) is an early Peter Weir movie about a small community with an economy that requires car accidents to function. It’s not as fast-paced or exciting as Mad Max or as intense as Wake In Fright, but it does operate on a similarly weird wavelength. Most of the runtime is about a car crash survivor being informally adopted by the mayor (John Meillon), which is not particularly interesting. It’s a slow wind up to the wild car finale.\n\n🎃 Slasher films full of too many hot, buxom, young, horny teens for ya? Dark Night of the Scarecrow (1981) has got you covered. This story’s murder victims are all fat, middle-aged, male farmers who hate people with mental struggles. For a TV movie in a genre loaded with stereotypical lackluster entries, this one is pretty solid. A basic setup, some great performances (Charles Durning, I’m lookin’ at you), and some creatively horrific deaths involving farm equipment. Admittedly, Darkman‘s Larry Drake appearing as a “Simple Jack” type threw me off, but I soon recovered.\n\nRyan’s Babe (2000) is what we wait for. It’s a classically bad movie that is just as puzzling as it is incompetant. I assume this is just how all Saskatoonians see the world. Anyway, it’s a must-watch and any description I could give won’t do it justice.\n\nNeil Breen is back, and we were lucky enough to finally see one in theaters! Cade: The Tortured Crossing (2023), shot completely on greenscreen, was a special treat, but perhaps a note of diminishing returns… And our first moments of doubt. But perhaps that doubt is more in ourselves than in Breen.\n\nIf, in years to come, it is revealed that Neil Breen, as a man, is a hoax – that the entity that is Breen is all merely an elaborate performance art piece and the films are just one of the many extensions of this performance dreamed up by a team of Breen engineers (Breengineers, if you will), but have taken a life of their own, perhaps even beyond their initial intentions – I would not be mad.\n\nWhether Breen is exactly who he appears to be, whether he is an avant-garde experiment, whether he is a flawed but ever evolving entrepreneur grasping vaguely at what people love about him and tapping into waves of self-awareness, I truly do not care. If it is a trick, it is a great one. If it is all real, as I continue to humbly suspect, perhaps an even greater one.\n\n🎃 Cults and murder and Halloween. It’s Jag Mundhra’s Hack-O-Lantern (1988)! A somewhat infamously bad movie with a title that says precious nothing. It’s dumb fun that, if you’re in the mood, will surely scratch a trashy Halloween-y itch or two.\n\nNow I am become old, the gets tired watching a superhero movie. I absolutely loved 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It was fresh and fast and so imaginative and gorgeous. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) is no less technically impressive and smart, but I feel like I aged 10 years watching it. It’s a great movie with loads of astounding visuals, dizzying action scenes, sharp wit, and a nice arc for Gwen Stacy’s character. But after a time, it was just too fast and furious for me and I needed a nap. Maybe it’s a masterpiece every bit as good as the previous film. All I know is I felt exhausted.\n\n🎃 The Black Cat (1934) marked the first (but not the last) time Universal monster icons Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff would star in a movie together. It was only natural for the studios to pit Dracula against Frankentstein (the two most popular horror movies of 1931). Lugosi is a Hungarian (how appropos) psychiatrist who survives a taxi wagon accident along with a newlywed couple and winds up at the futuristic mansion of the Satanist (Karloff) who killed his wife.\n\nExtremely, loosely “suggested by” Edgar Allen Poe, this classic horror melodrama is decent enough for the time, but suffers from a clinical location (gimme a spooky castle over this pristine, sterile house), a plodding plot, and the fact that Lugosi and Karloff, while amazing in their own rights, are kind of weird together. Their acting styles and powerful personas clash, and not in a way that services the story. Something just feels off about their chemistry. Still, I love both these men and it’s always fun seeing them.\n\n🎃 Teruo Ishii’s Horrors of Malformed Men (1969) is a bit of blur to me now. I was tripping balls on cold medicine at the time. But that actually seems like the perfect headspace to enter this strange Japanese horror movie. I knew nothing about it going in, except that the cover art intrigued me. Sometimes you gotta trust your instincts. Malformed Men has some trashy twists and turns and some weird, culty body-horror type surgeries, but it’s a gradual windup. You gotta be patient.\n\n🎃 We had a time trying to guess which character was played by actor/writer/director/producer James Bond III. Depending on who we thought at any given moment, it drastically altered the overall tone and flavor of where this weird story was coming from. About 35 minutes in we confirmed who James Bond III was. Def by Temptation (1990) is a moralistic urban horror about a succubus that tempts people astray. It’s hard to score this one exactly as it’s a bit scattershot, but we definitely liked a lot of individual scenes. And what is a good movie if not a collection of pretty good scenes?\n\n🎃 Romero meets the Ramones! Zombies are attacking and only Japanese rock group Guitar Wolf (…and overcoming transphobia) can the world be saved in Tetsuro Takeuchi’s Wild Zero (1999). It’s wild and wacky, and would make an excellent double-feature with 1998’s Bio-Zombie.\n\n🎃 Michael Tolkin’s The Rapture (1991) is a super weird movie that’s gonna be hard to dissect in a blurb. It takes a specific brand of American Christian eschatology and treats it completely soberly, crafting a psychological slow-burn horror flick through the lens of that theology. It’s about doubt and faith and fanaticism and probably a whole lot more. It’s low-key, but also harrowing. Tolkin said while inroducing the film for Trailers from Hell that people came away from the movie in 1991 either happy it portrayed religion as true or happy it portrayed it as false, or angry about either of those two reads. Essentially, interpretations are numerous.\n\nMimi Rogers plays Sharon, an atheist call center employee and swinger who finds God and embarks on an apocalyptic journey that challenges her new faith at every turn. It is a provocative film for a lot of reasons, and I definitely had a lot of feelings about it while it was unfolding. Having grown up with evangelicalism (and having been shown the pre-Left Behind series, Thief in the Night and its sequels), the movie truly felt like a sermon I had heard many times before – but it was different this time. It was not the fantastical Christian Twilight Zone-esque cautionary tale. At least, not exactly. Tolkin doesn’t believe any of this stuff. His rather matter-of-fact presentation of the events doesn’t pass judgement on any of the characters. It lets things happen and leaves the moral determinations and the reality of it all up to the audience.\n\nWeird this was even made. Also stars David Duchovny. Would pair well with Bill Paxton’s Frailty. True as it ever was, no one does Christian movies quite like a non-Christian.\n\nWhat a cozy, silly man Steve Martin is. LA Story (1991) is a very personal and gentle romantic comedy with touches of surreal humor and magical realism. A weatherman (Martin) starts to receive messages from a freeway billboard that helps him win the affections of an English journalist (Victoria Tennant). It’s sweet and is about fate and love and Los Angeles and, it would seem, one of the closer peeks into Steve Martin’s head.\n\n🎃 Finally saw David Cronenberg’s The Brood (1979). I don’t want to give much away, but I will say that, like a lot of early Cronenberg movies, it starts as a strange, slow quasi-mystery; depicts Canada as a perpetually slushy and overcast dystopic snowmare* [*nightmare but with snow]; and gets wildly, weirdly gross once you start figuring out what’s going on.\n\nFor me, what elevates this above Shivers and Rabid, is the star power of Oliver Reed. Cronenberg starts putting actors with more gravitas in his movies (Michael Ironside, James Woods, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Walken, Jeremy Irons, etc.), and, for me, it really adds to the film. I love Cronenberg’s bizarro body-horror concepts and themes on identity, but inserting a more captivating actor into the story really sucks you in more. What can I say? I’m an actor boy. The Brood does start slow and cryptic, but once you get to the third act, it’s pretty hard to say the ride wasn’t worth it.\n\n🎃 Thirteen Women (1932), directed by George Archainbaud, is an estrogen-fueled, pre-Code, proto-slasher flick and it rules. The sinister magic at work isn’t a masked killer with a knife, but merely the power of suggestion…which appears to work murderously well on the poor, horoscope-obsessed victims. Someone is killing women! And in surprisingly creative and grisly ways for a movie made in 1932.\n\nIt is a bit “has aged poorly” in a few key aspects. Myrna Loy plays an evil Indonesian swami who was the victim of cruel racism in her school days. Naturally, she’s a supervillain now. For some reason, Hollywood kept casting Myrna Loy as an Asian woman in this part of her career. Thank God she eventually moved from Fu Manchu to The Thin Man. She’s actually a much better comic actor than a dragon lady trope.\n\nThe movie does highlight a deep flaw within astrology (that I imagine even subscribers of would undoubtedly admit), and that is the pliable susceptibility of the mind. If you are looking for something, you will almost certainly find it, whether it is there or not. I’ve never seen astrology used as a murder weapon before, and it’s pretty intriguing how Thirteen Women employs it. Although, this is less of a Derren Brown exposé of superstition, and more a cheap, pulpy thriller. It even has a train in it.\n\nQuentin Tarantino, love him or hate him, hasn’t made a bad movie. Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) is a sharp homage to many of the movies that made him. Uma Thurman is the bride out for revenge, hacking her way through Vivica A. Fox, Chiaki Kuriyama, Lucy Liu, and every last member of the Crazy 88 to get to the man who done her wrong: Bill. It’s a fast, pulpy, hyper-violent revenge thriller streamlined to its essentials so that the movie can focus on delivering stylish visuals inspired by wild retro flicks. Cue the 5, 6, 7, 8’s!\n\nRoy Andersson’s Songs from the Second Floor (2000) is a Swedish tragicomedy played out in numerous vignettes that occasionally overlap. The humor is pitch black and quite haunting. It examines the cruelty and banality of modern life in Sweden, and how it is tainted by the crimes of the past and the uncertainty of the future, but all at an arm’s length, almost as if it all were being presented as an especially grim (and rather Scandinavian) Far Side cartoon. It marks the beginning of Andersson’s trilogy of similarly styled features which include You, the Living (2007) (which is quite good) and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence (2014) (I need to see it).\n\n🎃 I think I’m obsessed with David Robert Mitchell now. I absolutely loved the criminally underseen neo-noir Under the Silver Lake, and I was quite taken by his earlier horror film It Follows (2014) which I have now seen.\n\nFor a supernatural horror like this to work it needs: 1. an intriguing monster, 2. clear rules, 3. let the discovery of those rules unfold a bit like a mystery. Check, check, and check. I’m just a sucker for monsters and their rules. To make it great it needs: 1. clever concept couched in a topical metaphor, 2. great cinematography, 3. Disasterpeace does the soundtrack. Triple check again.\n\nApparently Mitchell is currently working on some sort of “dinosaur movie set in the 80s” starring Oscar Isaac and Anne Hathaway. Please, let this movie be made. I need this.\n\nWhile I really like Kill Bill Vol. 1, I love Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004). Uma’s back and going after Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and ultimately David Carradine. This sequel tones things down and slows things down and morphs into a very different kind of movie. While the first movie had a comically high body count, this time the Bride ultimately takes only one life. It’s a more pensive movie, with more consequences, more tragic backstory, and more lugubrious soliloquoys. I don’t know if anyone has ever had more fun telling a story than Tarantino. The inevitable violence is teased out, but has more power and weight to it. If Vol. 1 was an 70s exploitation movie steeped in old school Japanese revenge flicks (Lady Snowblood, for one) that would work just as well as a silent film, Vol. 2 is a talky, slowburn western peppered with nods to classic Chinese kung-fu. Together, they are a fantastic showcase of the power of various cinematic styles and how those styles inform the telling of a story, even one so simple as a basic revenge plot.\n\n🎃 Jerzy Skolimowski The Shout (1978) tickled me in ways that I find quite easy to pinpoint. Listen, my review of this is probably beyond rational. This a genre I love: weird guy insinuates himself into normal man’s life and cucks the bejeezus out of him – think Cul-de-sac, Bone, Borgman, What About Bob?, etc. And it’s from a time when cinematic protagonists had hyper specific, unusual jobs. In this case, John Hurt plays an experimental electronic composer. I love those details.\n\nA mysterious man (Alan Bates) claims to have learned dark Aboriginal magick. There is a scream that can be uttered that can kill a man. Is it true or merely the rich braggadocio of a lunatic? Or perhaps he is not insane, but merely exceptionally manipulative. Or again, is it real? What does he want?\n\nSkolimowski’s direction is bonkers from the start. Lots of bold and bizarre choices that suck you in and thrash you around. The sound design as well is very intentional and great. John Hurt and Susannah York are well cast, but the real reason this movie is so beguiling and strange is because of Alan Bates’ dangerous, unhinged performance. He keeps you on the edge of your seat and surprises you at every turn.\n\nHappy Halloween 🎃\n\nRate this:\n\nMore movies. All the time.\n\n21. This stilted Italian sword-and-sorcery schlock is aided by Mario Bava’s far-out colors and lighting. It’s Hercules in the Haunted World (1961). It’s got its moments – one of the few appearances of Procrustes (a hilariously specific villain with my favorite arbitrary rules in Greek mythology…in this movie he’s also a rock monster for some reason). But mostly, it’s a snoozer. Sorry, Reg Park, but my heart belongs to Lou Ferrigno.\n\n20. The Ten (2007) is an anthology comedy film from the people behind Wet Hot American Summer and The State that sends up each of the Ten Commandments. Krzysztof Kieślowski’s Dekalog, this is not. It’s not as funny as the other projects these guys have worked on either. It’s a hit and miss, somewhat dated comedy with an all-star cast and a handful of funny moments. We watched it as a goof.\n\n19. I love me some classic Hammer horror, monstrous ghouls, and Caroline Munro. That said, Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter (1974) isn’t one of the more memorable combinations of these normally delectable ingredients. These characters are not great at their job. The suave Captain Kronos and his hunchbacked scientist sidekick take their blessed time catching a soul-sucking vampire. There’s some mystery about the vampire’s identity and how to kill it…which is really dragged out. The action doesn’t really start until the very end. You could watch this…or you could watch Fearless Vampire Hunters instead (a bit sharper and much better theme song).\n\n18. The woods looks creepy enough in this well acted horror flick. The Ritual (2017) has atmosphere, good chemistry between its actors, and a wonderfully unique creature design…but it doesn’t do much and isn’t really scary. I love monsters. So why does this lose me once the monster actually shows up? A big, goofy monster that just spikes you onto a tree branch because of cult stuff just isn’t that scary. Perhaps worth checking out because everything leading up to the finale is very well done.\n\n17. Seth Rogen gives a wonderfully watchable performance as an Eastern European immigrant from 1919 who accidentally brines himself and wakes up 100 years into the future in An American Pickle (2020). Rogen also plays the man’s great grandson. The premise is marvelously whimsical and unique and poised to do amazing things…but ultimately gets rather squandered, quickly devolving into a story of petty tit for tat revenge between two characters that could have been anybody. When it’s tender and when it’s weird and fully unpacking the concept of confronting your heritage, it shines. I really wanted to like this one more. This concept deserves more. But even at its most uninspired, it still has a woolly Rogen doing a fun accent.\n\n16. God and Satan are on a train as the porter shows them stories of humans at their most depraved, and they bicker over whose soul belongs to them. This is Night Train to Terror (1985), a bonkers Z-grade horror anthology that makes absolutely no sense. And then I learned that it’s actually three separate movies that were edited down to be one single film (couched in a ham-fisted cosmic framing device). I found most of the stories cheap, sleazy, and hard to follow. Just the way I like it sometimes. It’s got some interesting ideas (I thought the death cult in story 2 was a neat premise) and some wonky stop-motion effects. At the end of the night, it’s only mostly a waste of time. The film even makes fun of its own hapless viewers with the repeated rock stanza: “Everybody’s got something to do. Everybody, but you!”\n\n15. In the wake of the success of Smokey and the Bandit, Sam Peckinpah attempts to capture the spirit of the American trucker movie with Convoy (1978), starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, and Ernest Borgnine. Something about the 70s, man. These movies made the trucker lifestyle look like the coolest, sexiest, most American thing you could possibly do. While Convoy starts off pretty strong – several trucker buds are on the run after beating up some bad cops in a glorious bar brawl – the plot gets a more complicated than perhaps necessary and loses a lot of momentum and direction once the convoy actually starts. Like An American Pickle, I was in love with what this movie could have been.\n\n14. Sir Ralph Richardson is a sinister crypt-keeper who shows a few lost souls some piercing glimpses into their sordid selves in the original adaptation of Tales from the Crypt (1972). Based on the EC horror comics, this fright flick runs the gamut of typical morality tales of terror. Hammy acting and Chick Tract-esque simplicity aside, it’s an effective relic of horror anthology history that boasts some nice camerawork and a heartbreakingly adorable performance from Peter Cushing. You gotta love the clever titles for all the sequences when the credits role. A far better and more coherent – if a bit more conservative – entry into the genre than Night Train to Terror.\n\n13. I’m not sure if I’ve seen a movie more hellbent on breaking down the methods of subtle deception within nonfiction filmmaking. Well, Orson Welles’ F for Fake, maybe. But here it is used to also show how the very way we talk about the past has the same manipulations of framing. Further Beyond (2016), directed by Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor, presents itself initially as a documentary about an Irish adventurer named Ambrose O’Higgins who traveled to Chile in the 18th century. As it goes, however, it also becomes, simultaneously, a deconstruction of the artifice of the presentation itself. You get sucked into the way we tell stories and recount the past and ponder on the mechanics of documentary filmmaking. The limited budget is far from an impediment here. It’s a gentle little film that tucks you in for bed under a cozy blanket while reassuring you that everything is, in fact, only one version of reality.\n\n12. Robert Mitchum might be one of the few men capable of staring down and intimidating the stately Gregory Peck. Mitchum’s casting as the chilling ex-con, Max Cady, out for revenge against the lawyer (Peck) who put him away – not to mention the moody black-and-white photography – are what make Cape Fear (1962) a classic thriller. The movie really taps into primal fears, as well as the frustration of feeling impotent to stop the evil that is encroaching with ice cold calculation. The ever-present threat of physical and sexual violence is palpable. Peck’s character is a bit of an idiot and his plan is cockamamie, reckless, traumatizing, and results in a murder and the movie sort of sidesteps all that because, hey, a man’s gotta do anything he can to protect his family, I guess.\n\n11. I remember catching this on TV a lot as a kid. Re-watching City Slickers (1991) now that I’m closer to Billy Crystal’s age in the film, I get it even more. It’s the quintessential male mid-life crisis movie. Three buddies (Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby) go for a two week cattle drive adventure. This naturally leads to several comic moments and some harrowing personal growth. It’s at its best when the guys are just riffing about life and making snarky remarks that reveal their character. Jack Palance is perfectly cast as the tough-as-nails cowboy, Curly, who imparts his sage wisdom that the secret to life is just one thing. It’s an enjoyable and still funny comedy from a bygone age – the early 90s.\n\n10. Gave Monster House (2006) another watch with some kids. It’s just a real efficient little Halloween kiddie horror. The spooky old house in a quiet neighborhood eats people. And three kids have to stop it. I like that essentially it’s all set on one street. Cut the fat. Get to the house being creepy. Some funny lines and clever plot elements help it along. It’s simple, smooth, and fun. The motion-capture may come off as a bit of a weird choice, but it just sort of adds an extra layer of surreality. The character design feels like your on mushrooms.\n\n9. Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) is an eerie shaggy dog mystery about missing girls from a fancy schmancy Australian school in 1900. It’s a slow-moving, trancelike yarn that is pleased to meander and stop…and then meander some more as we observe various characters reacting to the tragic disappearance. It is a little comical to me that everybody is only ever concerned about Miranda because she’s the hot one.\n\n8. I’ll come clean. This is pretty cheesy, but what can I say? I’m a sucker for pulpy pre-Code 1930s genre movies. Chandu the Magician (1932) is as absurd as its title suggests. A white guy (Edmund Lowe) has trained for years in India to learn the ancient arts of astral projection, teleportation, and general magical trickery and discovers that the yogis that trained him want him to stop an evil mastermind named Roxor (played by Bela Lugosi) who has kidnapped his mad scientist brother-in-law in order to use his death ray to conquer the world. All of this is laid out in the first two minutes. Chandu’s also got a crush on an Egyptian princess. This is the type of exotic nonsense movie that tells its story efficiently and with some good atmosphere and does not overstay its welcome.\n\n7. We absolutely loved Twin Dragon Encounter. Two good old Canadian boys with lustrous mustaches and a martial arts studio take their girlfriends camping in Ontario and wind up going toe to toe with an adorable group of militia men with a nebulous agenda. It’s such a perfectly lovable bad movie that just makes you feel good. Naturally, we had to see the sequel. The McNamara boys are back in Dragon Hunt (1990). The budget is bigger. There are establishing shots and close-ups now. It employs Eisentstein’s montage theory to evoke feelings and create tension. And this movie has stakes. It’s wonderfully great fun. The bad guy from the first film is back and he’s got a metal hand. He wants revenge. So he sets up an insanely elaborate plan to capture the McNamaras and force them to do a sort of Most Dangerous Game scenario where they have to defend themselves against wave after wave of ninjas and beefy boys. This sequel doesn’t have the innocence and sweetness of the original. The twins actually kill people in this one. A lot of people. Brutally. They straight up harpoon a labradoodle with a makeshift spear and leave it to bleed out to death. It does get a little tiring by the end, but it’s always good to be back up in the Muskoka woods with the boys and their thick, thick mustaches.\n\n6. Where have you been all my life, Phantasm (1979)? Directed by Don Coscarelli, this cult horror favorite boasts a bunch of fun and original ideas. Grave robbing! The Tall Man! Flying death orbs! Other dimensions/planets(?)! Either this is exactly your kind of thing or it isn’t. I won’t say too much, but I definitely want to see the rest of the movies in the Phantasm universe.\n\n5. I dug Midsommar, but was intimidated to watch Ari Aster’s earlier film, Hereditary (2018). Mainly because I knew it would be depression horror, which I find can be emotionally draining. Maybe I was just in the right headspace, but this slow-burn horror flick hit every intended mark upon my viewing. I felt sick, sad, disgusted, horrified, and genuinely impressed with the performances (particularly Toni Collette, who absolutely brings it). It kept me guessing with clever surprises and twists all the way to the end. It is an extremely well-crafted film with equal portions tragedy and terror, and I’m glad I finally got around to it.\n\n4. Like good drugs, a lot of what makes a movie great or special is the set and setting of the viewer at the time of viewing. And holy cow, did The Keep (1983) meet me just right. Genuinely a spiritual experience at the time. It’s flawed and messy, sure, but it’s got a weird hold on me now. We went in expecting a sort of Cannon style Indiana Jones horror knockoff. Instead, we got a WWII supernatural thriller retelling of the Golem legend with complex moral and religious themes and a wonderfully entrancing, and willfully anachronistic, Tangerine Dream score. It doesn’t all quite come together and a lot of things are left unexplained (I later learned that Michael Mann’s original cut was 210 minutes long, so the hour and a half version isn’t exactly the whole story), but that kind of almost lends itself to the ethereal mystery of this curious creation. Great locations. Great monster. Features Scott Glenn, Ian McKellen, Jürgen Prochnow, and Gabriel Byrne.\n\n3. Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Cher play three single small town women just starting to realize that they might have some magical powers in George Miller’s The Witches of Eastwick (1987). Their chemistry is great and they never looked better, and they are abetted by an explosively watchable performance from Jack Nicholson, who plays a mysterious man who arrives out of nowhere to seemingly answer all of the girls’ wishes. Yeah, he’s the Devil. If a sexy fantasy-comedy about women discovering they’re witches and banging Satan before going to war with him (all directed by the guy who did the Mad Max movies) doesn’t interest you, then I guess we’re just different people.\n\n2. With pastiches of Tati and Truffaut, Wes Anderson deftly cobbles together an erudite and visually dense anthology that celebrates art, youth, food, France, and – most importantly of all – journalism. It may be in vogue to critique Anderson’s twee dollhouse aesthetic overwrought in quirky symmetry, but I loved every cakey bite of The French Dispatch (2021). Gorgeous to look at; musical to listen to; overflowing with asides, ampersands, and addendums (both literary and optical). This expensive looking production recounts the death of a French-based American periodical publisher and celebrates his life and journalistic impact through the retelling of several previously published articles (that would appear in the final issue of The French Dispatch). It would be pointless to explain the plot further. It’s not so much what is being said, so much as how it’s being told – a perfect analogue for both the influence of writers on their stories and filmmakers on their films. Style over substance? That’s actually the point. A sprawling cast, charming Alexandre Desplat score, and all the clever, artistic flair you’d expect and more. If you were down with increasingly stylized whimsy of Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel, then you’re going to enjoy this.\n\n1. Cryptozoo (2021) is exactly the kind of movie I dream of and wait for. Dash Shaw’s earlier film, My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, was excellent, and this is the perfect follow-up. Imagine a psychedelic Jurassic Park but with the fearless illustrative style of indie comics and vintage pulp sci-fi covers. A zoo for cryptids is under threat and a brave woman and her team must save it, but the imagination behind this film goes well beyond inventive creature design and unconventional animation choices. Cryptozoo deals with themes of exploitation, fetishization, stigmatization, conservation, capitalism, compromise, war, the failure of good intentions, and a world not knowing what to do with the diminishing number of unique things in it. So many ideas and so much visual flourish, all so cleverly and expertly executed. And I cannot say enough nice things about the hypnotic score by John Carroll Kirby. I know when I’ve found my candy, and I know it won’t be for everyone, but Cryptozoo is a rare and precious beast.\n\nRate this:\n\nI love bad movies, but even I have my limits.\n\n22. The Antichrist rises to power in this truly awful Christsploitation flick starring Michael York. Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 (2001) takes classic American Evangelical fixations and fears surrounding their beliefs about the End Times and makes it inconceivably boring. There are a few things so poorly executed that they elicit laughter, but the acting isn’t that bad and the filming itself (directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith) is competent enough, so what we’re left with is just a very bad script that doesn’t know who the main the characters are or what the actual themes are – there aren’t any themes; it’s literally just supposed to be Evangelical paranoid eschatology committed to film. One thing’s for sure: they have a hard on for America and some vague notion of freedom. Somehow they also managed to rope in Franco Nero, R. Lee Ermey, and Udo Kier.\n\n21. I think director John Frankenheimer got the script and saw it was a cheesy eco-horror about an evil lumber mill inadvertently creating a giant mutant bear and just gave up before he started. Most of the choices in Prophecy (1979) are lazy and tedious, and that’s sad because I really think, had this been filmed with some love and care, it could have been a fun mutant bear movie. Not much is set up and even less is paid off. It’s a meandering bramble through the woods of Maine with Talia Shire, Richard Dysart, and Armand Assante… and then a mutant bear. The bear is fun and cheesy, but he’s not in it much. (We expected that going in.) The highlight was when the bear attacks a family of campers and launches a boy in a down sleeping bag into a boulder where he explodes into a plume of goose feathers. See? *chef’s kiss* More of that and less of everything else this was doing.\n\n20. I am such a hopeless fan of Richard Lester’s Three Musketeers (1973) and Four Musketeers (1974). They are a funny, star-studded, irreverent, swashbuckling extravaganzas that stay extremely close to the source material. The third entry in Lester’s adaptations of Alexandre Dumas’ work is decidedly… less good. The Return of the Musketeers (1989) reunites all of the original cast (even bringing Christopher Lee’s Rochefort back from the dead and giving him a revenge-obsessed daughter played by Kim Cattrall). However, whatever wisps of steam this period saga had left quickly evaporated with the tragic on-set death of Roy Kinnear (who wonderfully played D’Artagnon’s comic valet, Planchet). Sadly, not much magic or fun to be salvaged here.\n\n19. The Trollenberg Terror (aka The Crawling Eye) (1958) is a classic British sci-fi flick featuring a psychic girl, Forrest Tucker, and a popular Swiss mountain shrouded in a mysterious cloud. Just what could this cloud be hiding? Well, if you didn’t guess murder and aliens then you need to brush up on this genre. I had seen this as a really little kid on TV and remembered it being mostly slow and very boring, but with kind of a creepy hook, decent ending, and an interesting monster design. Not great, but not the worst. Even the movie has a character mutter the phrase, “cute little things”, at the sight of the adorably cheesy aliens. The animated 90s show Freakazoid! even parodied this movie. Any movie that makes me remember Freakazoid! can’t be all bad.\n\n18. Apparently Cabin Boy (1994) sunk Chris Elliott’s film career. Here he plays an obnoxious fop who winds up on a salty fishermen’s boat. This movie is pretty bad from the start. The jokes are so broad and cartoony and it just doesn’t work. But then it did something I’ve never seen before. It kept getting weirder and weirder until it goes full Spongebob and actually won me over in the end. Will I watch Cabin Boy again or recommend it? Probably not, but I gotta say, if you can stick it out until the last act, you may find yourself actually having some fun. Wish it had worked all the way through. When it tries to be funny, it usually falls flat. But when it goes for weird fantasy/fever dream, it actually works.\n\n17. On paper, David O. Russell’s I Heart Huckabees (2004) should be something I absolutely love. I love the all-star cast and making a screwball comedy about existentialism sounds utterly tantalizing to me. Maybe I’ve just been in the wrong headspace every time I’ve seen it, but I find the proceedings rather tedious. Anyways, an idealistic conservationist and activist (played by Jason Schwartzman) hires existential detectives and lovers, Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman, to solve a coincidence for him, but gets sucked into a deeper exploration into the meaning of existence. I love the idea. I just don’t think I love what they did with existentialism. It’s all just so blunt and literal. And everything is just so brightly lit. For whatever reason, I cannot get on this film’s wavelength. Which is not to say that people like Isabelle Huppert, Mark Wahlberg, Naomi Watts, and Jude Law aren’t doing great work here. It’s one of those movies where I’m convinced it’s better than my experiences of it.\n\n16. Schlockmeister, Stuart Gordon, delivers a rare straight-up sci-fi action flick without any horror, sexual assault, or gore. Robot Jox (1989) is a low-budget mech-suit flick where war is fought in the fighting arena. Athletes representing their countries battle in giant robot suits for control of key territories. Even the movie knows how low stakes Alaska is and kind of drops that by the end. Because this match is personal! Look, it’s dumb. It’s cheap looking. It’s a shoestring Pacific Rim without the monsters. But for what it is, Robot Jox delivers everything it sets out to do.\n\n15. Look, this movie was big and dumb and overstuffed and ridiculous, but somewhere inside me is a little British girl who loves steampunk YA novels, and Mortal Engines (2018), for all its nonsense, weirdly scratched an itch I didn’t know I had. I cannot defend enjoying this. I didn’t even like it most of the time. But something about marrying Howl’s Moving Castle with Mad Max: Fury Road and giving it some inelegantly blunt political commentary about imperialism simplified for an audience too young for Snowpiercer, somehow helped me overcome most of its shortcomings. It feels like pulpy fan-fiction that just gets a little too boring and schmaltzy (but again, this was made for an 11 year old nerdy white preteen and not exactly me). At the end of the day, I admired the special effects and craft that went into building this obnoxious world. And I liked the zombie guy. It’s only been a day and I’ve already forgotten most of the characters and plot, but I could say the same for Robot Jox.\n\n14. Quirk marches on. Jared Hess made a cult classic with Napoleon Dynamite and nobody would let him succeed ever again. Gentlemen Broncos (2009) was universally panned, and, while not perfect and perhaps a bit too reliant on barf, balls, and characters just looking weird or ugly for most of its comedy, the story of a boy who wants to write science-fiction novels and gets plagiarized by his idol is itself clever and sweet (in that awkward Mormon/Christian/Midwestern sort of way), and the sci-fi/fantasy segments have such a powerful, assured kitsch style that I did find myself smiling and laughing more than I expected to. Germaine Clement and Sam Rockwell absolutely steal the show in spectacularly absurd fashion. Like Cabin Boy, Gentlemen Broncos is best when it’s just being weird.\n\n13. This next one is hacked for me. I’m a sucker for creative monsters and goopy makeup. Steven Kostanski’s Pyscho Goreman (2020) is a comedy that uses the tropes of sci-fi horror to skewer Power Rangers, E.T., and half a dozen other nostalgia properties and gimmicks. Two kids find a glowing space thingy that allows them to control the most evil space lord in the universe. They name him Psycho Goreman, or PG for short. Everything is a joke in this bad boy. And most of those jokes work.\n\n12. I re-watched Gangs of New York (2002) and I feel just about the same about it as when I first saw it. Amazing bits of NYC history, beautifully realized sets and historical detail that simply transports you to the past, and Daniel Day Lewis is smashing it up as top hatted villain, Bill the Butcher. But, like a lot of later Scorsese films, something feels off. I think most of it can be attributed to me and my inability to give a shit about Leonardo DiCaprio. People keep telling me he’s great. And maybe he is. But his presence, for whatever reason, hurts my movie experience. I’m sorry, Leo. I know you work hard. Anyway, when the movie’s about New York, it’s awesome. When it’s about Amsterdam Vallon, it’s pretty meh.\n\n11. The 80s seemed to perfect the remake. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (technically 1978), The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986), and The Blob (1988) are all remakes that arguably surpass their source material. Admittedly, I haven’t seen the 1953 original, but Cannon’s Invaders from Mars (1986) is like the perfect scary alien movie for kids (not exactly in the same class as the other remakes listed, but solid nonetheless). Little David Garner sees a UFO land in his backyard, but when his dad goes over the hill to investigate he returns…changed. Fun, slimy creatures and classic extraterrestrial assimilation paranoia. It gets a little sloppy towards the end, but really likable overall. With Tobe Hooper, Dan O’Bannon, Stan Winston, and John Dykstra behind the scenes, you’re gonna get something fun.\n\n10. Nostalgia watch. I remember seeing Muppet Treasure Island (1996) in the theaters. After Jim Henson’s death in 1990, Henson Studios headed in a different stylistic direction and began adapting classic novels. While not nearly as strong as Muppet Christmas Carol, this Brian Henson film gets a lot of comic mileage just out of casting Robert Louis Stevenson’s pirate yarn with frogs and pigs and bears and monsters. The songs are good and Tim Curry chews the scenery deliciously as Long John Silver. The tone does shift a little awkwardly between wacky Muppet shenanigans and the more serious story of cabin boy Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop), but it maintains its own breezy air of whimsical adventure on the high seas.\n\n9. Colin Firth has to defend a literal swine accused of murder in a podunk 15th century French town in The Hour of the Pig (1993). It’s not a dour period drama. It’s actually pretty funny, and sexy too. And it grapples with the ludicrousness of clerical law, hypocrisy, power, and Dark Age belief in a refreshingly sober – if a bit cheeky – way. It’s no The Devils (but perhaps far more nuanced than The Name of the Rose), but it’s doing its thing. Ian Holm, Nicol Williamson (that voice!), and Michael Gough stand out as memorable characters, and Donald Pleasence, in one of his last roles, shines as a lead prosecutor. Lysette Anthony and Sophie Dix take their thankless roles as sex objects and add some welcome comedy to the parts. And Amina Annabi makes one hot gypsy.\n\n8. I also re-watched Christopher Guest’s classic Best in Show (2000) and it holds up. This might the first one I saw of his. I definitely saw it before I ever saw This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. This mockumentary tussles the hair of self-important show dog owners and is so funny because you believe all of these characters. The cast (comprised of Catherine O’Hara, Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock, and so many more) is pitch perfect. They deftly straddle that line between grating and endearing.\n\n7. Finally. A weird horror take on the classic fairytale. This Czech adaptation of Beauty and the Beast (1978), directed by Juraj Herz, is a bit more like a cold, European nightmare than a nice, cute Disney cartoon. This time, Beast is a bird man (this cannot be stressed enough: he is a bird) who lives with a demon who tells him to embrace his animal side and just kill people already. The familiar story beats are there, but what I really like here is that the beast’s castle is decrepit and gross and that the Beast’s self-loathing and struggle with literally being overcome with animal instincts is at the forefront. Most versions focus on Beauty’s story and her Stockholm Syndrome and kind of forget that the Beast is literally losing his humanity to some kind of Cronenbergian body horror witch magic. While it lacks the charm and whimsy of Jean Cocteau’s 1946 French version, this movie looks great, and, by underscoring the horrific elements, it really makes it its own thing.\n\n6. Some Kind of Heaven (2020) is a documentary that takes a peek behind the gates of a Floridian retirement community. It shows us a bizarro elderly utopia we all sort of suspected always was going on, and it takes us into the lives of some of its less-than-enthused denizens. Beautifully shot, funny, and human. Highly recommended.\n\n5. It’s honestly probably best if you don’t know too much about Tyler Cornack’s Butt Boy (2019) going in. It’s a police procedural. It’s about addiction. It’s a movie that plays its absolutely wackadoo premise so stone-cold straight-faced that it actually becomes one of the more brilliant comedies of the absurd. It creeps up on you and, if you let it, will take you to where you’ve never gone before.\n\n4. Agnès Varda is one of those filmmakers whose work I need to experience more. Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962) is the story of a French popstar (Corinne Marchand) who is waiting for the results of a biopsy. The film starts with her at a psychic showing her some bad cards about her future and follows her as she kills two hours until her doctor can tell her what’s what. What makes this nontraditional narrative so captivating is the freestyle direction from Varda and how she uses any excuse possible to showcase the beauty, whimsy, and daily life of Paris. Perhaps it deals in existentialism in a way I just found more appealing and less literally than I Heart Huckabees. It’s a film I found myself thinking about and appreciating more the following day.\n\n3. I had never seen Friday (1995) and it was good to be back in the 90s for a bit. Ice Cube and Chris Tucker are two slacker buddies in South Central LA who spend the day checking out girls, smoking weed, and trying to find $200 to pay a local bully so they don’t get killed. Tiny Lister, Jr. is a scary bruiser on a comically small stolen bicycle, Nia Long is the unbelievably perfect girl next door, and John Witherspoon is a grumbly dad who knows when to drop some wisdom and when to pass gas. Ice Cube and DJ Pooh wrote the very funny slice-of-life script.\n\n2. Learning about the Labor Movement in America? Or perhaps just looking for a quality drama with tension and historical detail? Might I suggest watching Matewan (1987), directed by John Sayles and starring Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, Mary McDonell, and James Earl Jones? Based on the true events of the 1920 West Virginia coal miner strike and Matewan Massacre, the film follows a labor union organizer (Cooper) who tries to unite the miners while the company thugs employ any tactics they can to divide and intimidate. Matewan is a masterful film about an important – and oft times overlooked – part of American history. You should definitely watch it.\n\nChloé Zhao’s Nomadland (2020) is one of the most beautiful American films of recent memory. It captures the independent spirit and the hardness of life with poetry and humanity. Frances McDormand gives another fantastically understated performance as Fern, a woman who has lost her husband, her job, and her town, and so sets out onto the open roads of Middle America. She meets many other fascinating characters – many of whom are played by real life nomad non-actors, giving the film a deep richness that is hard to duplicate. David Strathairn shows up again in this movie as well. Sometimes what drives people to become roving van-bound nomads is economic uncertainty, sometimes it feels like they’re being chased by sorrows of the past, but for many others it is the idea of freedom and independence and community at its purest. Gorgeously shot and incredibly intimate. Nomadland is hauntingly beautiful that I definitely recommend.\n\nBONUS SHORT:\n\nI’ve been a casual fan of Canadian indie musician, Chad Vangaalen, for awhile, but I hadn’t seen his concept album short film, Tarboz (Translated Log of Inhabitants) (2015). Vangaalen’s electronic folk music frequently narrates bizarre ballads that seem plucked from another realm, and his sci-fi animated music videos (which he also does himself) generally recall the surreal illustrated worlds of Moebius, Jesse Jacobs, and Bwana Spoons (all of whom you should also most definitely acquaint yourself with if you are not already familiar). I may be a sucker for this particular brand of grimly whimsical creativity, but I thought this was sublime. It just hit me right.\n\nRate this:\n\nAs always, I rank the films on no concrete scale or rubric. Just what I thought of them. The further down the list, the more I liked it. It’s not science, guys.\n\nMeh:\n\nComedian Amy Schumer (Inside Amy Schumer) stars in Trainwreck (2015), a mean-spirited by-the-numbers rom-com with one or two really good laughs. Judd Apatow (Knocked Up) directs and Bill Hader (SNL) co-stars as the perfect but vaguely awkward man who lets an alcoholic Amy treat him like garbage until she decides to just be with him. It’s a story of a character’s personal growth, but if you never really like the character you won’t care and if you’re not sure if she’s even learned anything you may be hard-pressed to call it an arc. I don’t care what the genders are, people being selfish and crappy to each other is neither romantic nor charming. Also features Alison Brie, Colin Quinn, John Cena, Tilda Swinton, Randall Park, and Dave Attell.\n\nI did not get Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Lobster (2015). I did not dislike it. I just didn’t quite get it. Colin Farrell (Seven Psychopaths), sporting a truly wonderful mustache, is a quiet man at a surreal mansion getaway where tenants are required to find a mate within 45 days lest they be turned into an animal (Colin chooses a lobster). I think it’s a metaphor for the social stigmas of being single, but it was all a little too dry and slow for me. A tepid, but refreshingly strange outing to the cinema. Also stars Rachel Weicz, Michael Smiley, John C. Reilly, and Ben Whishaw.\n\nIt took me awhile to get into the rhyming dialogue and beat poetry delivery of Spike Lee’s Chi-raq (2015). Lysistrata (played by the fabulous Teyonah Parris) starts a revolution to end gang violence in the bloody streets of Chicago by getting all women to deny their men sex of any kind until the shootings stop. It’s a bit stagey at times (in a stylized but awkward way that doesn’t always work), but the energy and humor and pulse of desperation make this movie worth a look. A bit tonally uneven, which is a shame because I feel like there’s a great film in there somewhere. Also features Angela Bassett, Samuel L. Jackson, Nick Cannon, Wesley Snipes, Steve Harris, Dave Chappelle, Jennifer Hudson.\n\nGuilty pleasures and amiable lectures:\n\nQuentin Tarantino. An obnoxious egotist who makes some fun movies. The Hateful Eight (2015) looks great and packs some great people into its tiny cast. A bounty hunter called The Hangman (Kurt Russell) escorting his bounty (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to her execution gets snowbound in a shifty cabin full of untrustworthy characters. The moments of tension are great—although nothing close to Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained—and it has a few surprises, but when every character is so hateful it can become hard to care about what happens to them. Samuel L. Jackson is half the reason the movie is as entertaining as it is. Jackson has a fantastic mental showdown with Bruce Dern’s character too. Also stars Tim Roth, Walter Goggins, and Michael Madsen.\n\nSamurai Cop (1991) is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. It truly is one of the BEST bad movies out there and you owe it to yourself to watch it now. The surprise sequel Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance (2015) is decidedly underwhelming by comparison. The film spends a lot of its time winking at the audience and dusting off all of the old cast for their own quality moments of varying hilarity. Instead of a crappy old school B-action movie we get a seriously incomprehensible Lynchian mess of flashy colors and lady murder. In a post screening Q&A, Matt Karedas (Joe “Samurai Cop” Marshall, himself) expressed disappointment with the finished product and said he was uncomfortable murdering so many women in the film, feeling it was against Joe’s character. For however impossible the plot is to follow, I loved a lot of the cheesy winks and wacky, forced cameos. Bai Ling and The Room‘s Tommy Wiseau add a lot of over-the-top zany surreality to the finished product, but seeing Mark Frazer and so many of the original cast reprising their roles in this stupid film was just what I needed. It looks like everyone is having fun. And this movie actually gave me newfound respect for Bai Ling. She plays it well beyond eleven. Fans of the original will undoubtedly be as dismayed and baffled as Matt, but should check it out anyway for a stupid adventure with your favorite cult movie heroes.\n\nJason Strouse’s quiet little comedy-drama about an ineffably likable high school teacher (played wonderfully by Matt Letscher) is sweet. It’s charming. It’s actually a bit too clean and simple at times. But Teacher of the Year (2014) manages to more closely resemble the anxieties of actual teacher life than most teacher flicks. Mitch Carter (Letscher) is a great educator who has to make a choice between staying where he’s always been or taking a bigger job across the country. The cast is good (Keegan-Michael Key and the Sklar Brothers add needed hilarity) and it has enough satisfying character moments to eclipse some of its contrivances. It’s not pretentious and it should make you smile, whether you’re in education or not. Co-stars Tamlyn Tomita, Jamie Kaler, Larry Joe Campbell, and Sunny Mabrey.\n\nA bit more on board:\n\nI love the Coen Brothers (Fargo, No Country for Old Men) and even lower tier Coens is still watchable (Ladykillers is pushing it though). Hail, Caesar! (2016) is not a masterpiece, but it is breezy and fun. The story is pulled in perhaps too many directions (The Big Lebowski made it work). Ultimately we may be a little fuzzy on what was being said and why we should care (Burn After Reading did it better). It’s all rather showy and cartoony (Hudsucker Proxy and Raising Arizona were more successful here). It’s about old Hollywood (Barton Fink, while weird, was far more engaging). It tries to depict a crisis of faith (A Serious Man, anyone?). In the end, Hail, Caesar! is a series of wacky scenes vaguely connected and told in the mock-buildup fashion of classic Coen shaggy dog tales. Not great. But not bad. Stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich (possibly the best part of the show), and a host of cameos from Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Clancey Brown, Wayne Knight, Christopher Lambert, etc. So what’s it about? The red scare? The calculated fakeness of showbiz? Who cares? Eat your popcorn.\n\nMichael Dougherty’s Krampus (2015) is a gleefully dark Christmas story full of demonic gingerbread men, ghoulish holiday gifts, and the wicked elf ruler of them all. A boy accidentally curses his family’s stressful yuletide proceedings when he summons the dark version of Santa Claus: Krampus. It’s silly and simple, but the surreal sense of dread, coupled with the right tone of comedy, propel this anti-holiday flick beyond Gremlins (perhaps). Did I mention the fantastic creature effects? The evil Jack-in-the-box and the nightmarish lord of them all look wonderful! The use of puppets and suited monsters definitely add to the uneasy texture of this kooky flick. Features an extended stop-motion flashback sequence and Adam Scott, Toni Collette, Conchata Ferrell, David Koechner, and Allison Tolman.\n\nWhat if you could get the two lowest FIFA ranked teams in soccer and have them compete against each other on the same exact day as the World Cup final? Two Dutch soccer fans did just that and made it into a documentary called The Other Final (2003). If you like underdogs, this is for you. It’s underdogs versus underdogs! Watching the sadly forgotten teams of Bhutan and Montserrat meet on the patchy green amicably and in the spirit of pure sportsmanship is a charming little departure from big commercial athletics. As a bonus, I learned more about the countries of Bhutan and Montserrat than I ever knew before.\n\nLet’s take it up a notch:\n\nI’m a Stephen Chow fan. Shaolin Soccer and Kung-fu Hustle are masterpieces of comic fantasy. Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons (2013) is a fantastically innovative adventure and compelling retelling of the classic Chinese legend. While some of the ambitious visuals may falter beneath occasionally uneven special effects, one must applaud Chow’s typically confident direction of the impossible mayhem. Tragedy and comedy go hand in hand in this action-packed tale of demon hunters and romance unrequited. Like Chow’s previous films mentioned, Journey to the West is accessible to children for its monsters and fantasy but complex and surprising in its narrative cogs. At the end of it all, I found myself both exhausted and delighted at having seen something unique. Shu Qi, Wen Zhang, and Huang Bo star.\n\nKristen Wiig (SNL) plays Alice Klieg, a mentally ill woman who wins the lottery and decides to make a show based on herself (her thoughts, her memories, her hobbies, etc.) in Shira Piven’s Welcome to Me (2014). Honestly, I can’t imagine a single other person playing this character. Wiig straddles a weird line between comedy and sympathy for mental illness. The usual obvious satirical fodder of television politics rears its head too, but the real heart of the film comes from the endearing character and Wiig’s performance. There’s a lot of goodies in this clever little movie that I’ll just recommend you watch it. Also features Joan Cusack, Linda Cardellini, James Marsden, Wes Bentley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Robbins, and Alan Tudyk.\n\nIf you got excited by Tommy Wiseau’s mention in Samurai Cop 2, then you’re going to love this: The Room fan Rick Harper got deep into Wiseau’s world a few years back. So deep they may not be on speaking terms anymore. So deep he tracked down most of the original cast and crew and made a documentary about the famously awful cult movie. I had the special privilege of seeing the world premier of Room Full of Spoons (2016) in Madrid. If watching The Room brings you joy; if Tommy Wiseau fascinates you with his captivating oddness; if you’ve ever had questions about how the film was made or where Tommy comes from…watch this documentary.\n\n2016 Oscar winning film about the Catholic priest pedophilia cover up, Spotlight (2015), is solidly cast, well written, and an important reminder of the significance of investigative journalism in our world. This is like the sister film of All the President’s Men (1976). Not merely satisfied with looking into the interviewing process of gathering data via cold calls, personal interviews, and reading through old documents, Spotlight, like All the President’s Men, deals a lot with the nature of the politics game and media strategies involved in a high profile, high risk scoop dependent on secrecy and facts. And the personalities uncovering the story bring added realism to this slow-burn drama. Stars Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery.\n\nMORE! MORE!\n\nI gave a needed re-watch to a film I never really got on board with as a child. I saw the original Star Wars trilogy when I was 4 or 5 years old. Our home did not celebrate the knockoffs I later came to love. Starcrash and Battle Beyond the Stars have since become films I frequently recommend. Knowing this, and somewhat prompted by “Trailers From Hell“, I gave The Last Starfighter (1984) another chance. No, not all of the effects hold up (some of the earliest examples of CGI), but it is such an amiable breath of fresh air that it hit me just right. A video-gamer named Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) living in a dusty trailer park gets a surprise visit from a strange alien visitor (The Music Man‘s Robert Preston) sent to recruit him to defend a distant planet. Alex’s alien mentor, Grig (played by Dan O’Herlihy), is an understandably favorite character. It’s basically everything you want it to be. It’s unapologetically fun and squarely 80s sci-fi cheese. Maybe never confused with a truly “great” film, I submit we retain slots for the wonderfully good.\n\nShane Carruth’s Upstream Color (2013) is assuredly not everyone’s cup of tea. It is a hypnotic, elliptical enigma. If you thought Primer was alienating and indecipherable, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Categorized as a sci-fi movie, imdb.com summarizes the plot thusly: A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives. Which is more than the film itself clearly communicates and more succinct than I could blurb. For whatever reason, I enjoyed it immensely. But then…I also liked Beyond the Black Rainbow and Under the Skin a lot too.\n\nHigh-Rise (2015) is Ben Wheatley’s adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s 1975 novel. Tom Hiddleston plays a businessman who moves into the latest architectural wonder created by Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons). It’s got all the modern conveniences and it is stylish beyond compare, but things gradually devolve into anarchy as the classes and perceived entitlements of its tenants begin to clash. This is not Snowpiercer. This is not an action movie. The objectives are intentionally vague. It’s brand of satire is unabashedly dark and murky. It’s sexy and weird and claustrophobic. Also stars Sienna Miller, Luke Evans, and Elisabeth Moss.\n\nHere’s a slow-burn that caught me off guard. I went to see Karyn Kusama’s The Invitation (2015) knowing pretty much nothing about it. I think that helped. The story of a group of estranged friends reuniting under cryptic circumstances—and what increasingly feels like a cult pitch—sucks you in and holds you under as the tension and suspense uncomfortably builds before a final act that does not disappoint. The driveway to this California dinner party is lined with warning signs. Watch it. Stars Logan Marshall-Green, Tammy Blanchard, Michiel Huisman, and John Carroll Lynch.\n\nThis is the end:\n\nAfter all that, what could I list as my top three films? (As my whims sit these evening anyway.)\n\nS. Craig Zahler’s directorial debut has been lauded. And for good reason. Bone Tomahawk (2015) blows Tarantino’s latest film out of the water. Kurt Russell is Sheriff Hunt. He and his elderly deputy (Richard Jenkins), a greasy gunslinger (Matthew Fox), and one man with a broken [possibly gangrenous] leg (Patrick Wilson) go on a rescue mission to save the cripple’s wife (Lili Simmons) from a mysterious tribe of albino cannibal troglodytes. Valley of the Gwangi was cowboys versus dinosaurs. Now we got cowboys versus cave-people. And for however schlocky the synopsis may sound, this is a genuinely good movie. It is sensitive and earthy. More drama than gore-fest (though, there’s a bit of that too). It’s a well-written surprise whose humor and heart make it more than just that movie with the cannibal troglodytes in the wild west. And can we just give all of the acting awards to Richard Jenkins for his performance already? The man is glorious. Also features Sid Haig, David Arquette, Evan Jonigkeit, James Tolkan, and Sean Young.\n\nHow does a kinetic comedy-drama about a jealousy & meth-fueled transgender sex-worker on Christmas Eve in Hollywood filmed entirely on iPhone 5s sound? The very first scene of Sean Baker’s Tangerine (2015) sets up everything you need to know: Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) just got out of prison and just found out her pimp and boyfriend, Chester (James Ransone), has been cheating on her with a cisgender chick (Mickey O’Hagan). In addition we have the subplots of Sin-Dee’s best friend (also trans, also a sex worker), Alexandra (Mya Taylor), quiet ambitions of being a singer and an Armenian cab driver (Karren Karagulian) trying to avoid his family on Christmas Eve to find Alexandra. The whole chaotic pot comes to a boil and we, the audience, are there for the show. Maybe you don’t feel like you relate to any of these characters. Perhaps it all sounds too much like an episode of Cops. Or maybe you don’t mind walking a mile in someone else’s shoes and observing their lives and their dreams and their problems. These characters are not the typical archetypes of American cinema. It may take a moment to step into their world and get used to the frenetic tempo and saturated colors, but perhaps you shall be rewarded.\n\nNabwana I.G.G. has been making insane, low-budget action movies in the slums of Uganda for years. I was introduced to his work via Alan Ssali Hofmanis, an American who moved to Uganda and dedicated his life to helping Nabwana complete more films. Who Killed Captain Alex? (2010), on all accounts, could not be a good movie. But it is. The plot is all but incomprehensible and the effects and props are fakey-fake. But this was made in the slums. For nothing. And a mad, anarchic joy permeates every moment of this glorious, cacophonous proceedings. Unlike The Room, which I love because it is terrible, I love Captain Alex because it was so alien and new and wonderful. By way of the Voice Joker (gleeful narrator who vaguely helps tell the story between wisecracks), we are given a glimpse into life in the slums and, more tellingly, their interpretation of American action cinema, the genre they were first introduced to and the one they choose to troll. They are having fun. Infectious fun. I can’t guarantee that you will like it as much as I did. But after hearing the history of slum cinema from Alan and viewing this feature on the big screen at midnight I only know one thing: I can’t wait to see Nabwana’s next film in which I may have a brief cameo getting my own head blown up by the Ebola Hunter. Call me crazy, this was my favorite movie-going experience in awhile.\n\nThat’s my list. Disagree? What did you see?\n\nRate this:\n\nOrdered by my increasing opinion of them.\n\nWalk Away:\n\nRobin Williams (Hook), Edward Norton (Moonrise Kingdom), and Catherine Keener (The 40 Year Old Virgin) star in Danny DeVito’s Death to Smoochy (2002). How you could make a black comedy about the seedy underbelly of children’s entertainment so bafflingly unfunny is anyone’s guess. You would think the jokes would write themselves. I remember wanting to see this when it first came out, hearing it was terrible, then hearing it had a cult following and wasn’t that bad. I thought maybe it would be like Ben Stiller’s The Cable Guy, reviled for being so dark but discovering reports of its suckitude were greatly exaggerated upon my own personal viewing. Nope. This is a garish groaner that thinks it’s wackier than it really is. Stick with Matilda or War of the Roses.\n\nMeh/Misguided:\n\nOK. OK. OK. The Karate Kid, Part III (1989) is in no way anything less than a ludicrous mess of nonsensical garbage piled upon a plate made of lunacy. It’s messages are contradictory. It’s thrills are awkward, comically contrived, and unearned. It’s lead actor (Ralph Macchio) is clearly coked out of his mind. It’s motivations are embarrassingly childish. Yet, all these truly ugly miscalculations make it humorous in the same way we enjoy Troll 2 and The Room.\n\nI wanted to like this one. Dinosaur movies are something of a rarity and I was excited to go back to the park. Alas, Jurassic World (2015) is a joyless, candy-painted shot of novacane. It looks colorful, but I felt nothing the whole film. The original Jurassic Park (1993) is a cherished classic, yes, and two of the in-between sequels are sort of okay to varying degrees, but this latest entry feels even more geared toward children and the Marvel superhero audiences. It isn’t the overuse of CGI, either. For me it lacked character, discovery, tension, or genuine thrills (you need character for thrills to register). The best, most highly rendered special-effects in the business can’t save a foundering script or a lack of charisma. Ironically, the film’s central satirical parable of the necessity of upping the ante to awaken jaded audiences produces the blandest entry in this ever diminishing franchise. It’s faster, hammier, cheesier, lazier, stupider, less challenging, and ultimately has trouble forcing the fun. The first Jurassic Park was a milestone of cinema at the time and it was unlike anything audiences had ever seen before. In Jurassic World‘s failed attempts to infuse steroids into the series, its creators have fashioned a movie that looks exactly like all the other sterile, terrible kiddie action movies of the last several years. Instead of being happy it’s less insulting than the Transformers movies, we should be asking for better movies. At least dinosaurs fight each other in it.\n\nGuilty Pleasures:\n\nHorror legends Vincent Price (House of Wax), Peter Cushing (The Curse of Frankenstein), Christopher Lee (The Wicker Man), and John Carradine (House of Dracula) star in the creaky comedy-horror B-flick The House of Long Shadows (1983). The actors’ ages are showing and you’re worried for their joints every time they lift a pewter goblet and, truth be told, the story is dopey and the script, for the most part, fails at being either comedic or horrific. However, if you’re a fan of the withering cinematic warlocks listed above, you’ll probably enjoy watching them effortlessly outshine both the silly script and Desi Arnaz, Jr.\n\nCon Air (1997) is of historical significance if only because it may be the first film Nicolas Cage’s zaniness broke free of its previously Oscar-winning tethers. Donning the worst mullet, worst Southern accent, and worst back-story, Cage and a stuffed bunny board a prison plane full of psycho mutinying inmates (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, and others make up the airborne cast). It’s dumb, loud, and a mostly unintentionally hilarious blast in the spirit of Face/Off. It’s nonstop nuttiness in the guise of a serious action thriller. Also features John Cusack ( 1408) and Colm Meaney (Get Him to the Greek).\n\nInterestinger and Interestinger:\n\nRight after I heard the news of Christopher Lee’s passing I watched Rasputin: The Mad Monk (1966). Hammer vixen, Barbara Shelley (Village of the Damned), co-stars in this loose biography of the bizarre Russian mystic who weaseled his way into the last Czarina’s good graces. It may not be the most memorable movie, but it’s got some good moments and Lee gives a fun performance as the titular hypnotizing wacko. Tom Baker (Dr. Who) is still my favorite Rasputin though.\n\nAlexander Payne (Sideways, About Schmidt) puts some gorgeous black and white photography to good use in Nebraska (2013). Bruce Dern (Silent Running) and Will Forte (SNL) star as an alcoholic, dementia-addled old man and his good-natured, long-suffering son respectively. Woody Grant (Dern) believes he’s won some prize and demands to go to Omaha to retrieve his cash (everyone else knows it’s all a scam). Reluctantly, his son David (Forte) agrees to take him—if only to ensure the stubborn patriarch’s safety. When Woody starts telling family and locals of his dubious earnings before he’s even collected the nonexistent dough, the small town drama begins…but not without some comical Midwestern moments. It’s pleasant, humorous, and ultimately a tender little film.\n\nThis film is timely, intriguing, and—while somewhat high on its own cleverness—raises a lot of good points…if in a smug and sort of pretentious manner. Justin Simien and Adriana Serrano’s Dear White People (2014) is the closest thing we have to a Do the Right Thing for generation-blog. Black, white, and mixed race ivy league students verbally spar over racial privilege and politics. It’s wonderfully cast and hits its points efficiently and does a good job of leaving enough ambiguity for audiences to mull over. And it delivers its messages in a genuinely funny and entertaining way. For a movie dealing with so many hot button issues it’s a wonderfully watchable film.\n\nBeyond Our Borders:\n\nSet in a weird Iranian town called Bad City, Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) is a sumptuously photographed off-beat vampire flick that feels like a slowly creeping dream. It’s dark, doleful, deliberately paced and, while it most assuredly won’t be for everyone, it’s a rich example of inventive horror that explores vampire tropes in ways that rival Let the Right One In or Only Lovers Left Alive. You’ll never look at the ghostly specter of a flowing black burka atop an aimless skateboard the same way again…if you’ve ever seen that before to begin with. Like a lot of offbeat neo-vampire fair, it’s a wry but sexy slow-burn.\n\nLa Grande Illusion (1937) is a classic jailbreak POW movie directed by Jean Renoir (La bête humaine). The story concerns French officers and soldiers being held captive by the Germans during World War I. What sets La Grande Illusion apart is its daringly human portrayal of the enemy. People are people and just happen to be French or German. For a classic war movie, it is almost refreshingly absent of nationalism. It’s rightfully ranked alongside The Great Escape, Stalag 17, and The Bridge On the River Kwai.\n\nFinding Our Way Through the Shadows:\n\nOrson Welles (Citizen Kane) adapted a story by Franz Kafka with Anthony Perkins (Psycho) in The Trial (1962). Shot in Europe, the story unfolds like a subtle nightmare. A man is put on trial, but is never told the charges and he becomes entangled in the fuzzy dream logic of this world’s chaotic legal system. It feels like a trip down the rabbit hole and the cinematography and gritty interiors and landscapes add such strange beauty and texture to this peculiar project that was apparently, like many of Welles’ films, under-appreciated at the time of its release.\n\nHere’s a challenge readily embraced by director Delmer Daves: can you hide your protagonist’s face for the first half of your movie? Better yet, film most of it in POV. Somehow Dark Passage (1947), starring Humphrey Bogart (The Maltese Falcon) and Lauren Bacall (The Big Sleep), nails it and, rather than it coming off as a cheap gimmick, really utilizes the unfamiliar technique for solid narrative effect. It’s a classic mystery noir about a man who escaped from prison (convicted for the murder of his wife). While there are many brilliant scenes in the movie and clever camera angles, my favorite bits might be the conversation with the taxi driver and subsequent meeting with the plastic surgeon. The POV really pulls you into the story in a surprising and effective way.\n\nA quiet getaway driver played by Ryan O’Neal (Paper Moon) is trying to avoid being set up by an obsessed police detective (Bruce Dern). That’s really all you need to know for Walter Hill’s The Driver (1978). Not to be bogged down with too much dialogue or too complicated a plot, The Driver is all gorgeous 70s style and fantastic car chases. The film exudes coolness. Isabella Adjani (The Possession) also co-stars. Watch it. It’s great.\n\nReally, a Tough Call:\n\nFans of the Coen Bros.’ Fargo may be familiar with the oft reported case of a Japanese woman who, believing the film to be a true story, went searching for where Steve Buscemi buried the suitcase full of money in the snow. The Zellner Bros.’ Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter (2014) is a fictionalized version of how that woman came to America in search of that money. Rinko Kikuchi (Pacific Rim) gives a heart-breaking and deeply internalized performance as Kumiko, a sad misfit obsessed with treasure hunting. Her journey from the alienating officetels of Tokyo to the isolating snowdrifts of Minnesota is weird, awkwardly comical, and touchingly disconsolate. This movie comes highly recommended. It’s a quiet and vaguely surreal film that sits with you hours after watching it.\n\nEveryone saw it. Everyone loved it. And, truly, I get it. Mad scientist George Miller’s fourth installment of his Australian cult series, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), really is a masterpiece of dystopic action and brutal but balletic car carnage. There’s an adrenaline that doesn’t quit and a score that pulses aggressively forward and an explosion-filled chase crammed with Frankenstein vehicles that doesn’t let up. It’s got a lot typical Miller quirk and visual inventiveness. Tom Hardy (Bronson) and Charlize Theron (Prometheus) stoically lead the way through a stark, unforgiving desert, but it is Nicholas Hoult’s character, Nux, who gradually becomes the real emotional core of the film. Motorcycle grannies, bungee guitar mutants, muscle cars souped up with spikes and tank treads, and chainsaw-wielding gas-mask guys atop 50 foot pendulums swinging over erupting furnaces of vehicular devastation not your thing? You may not enjoy this, if that be the case. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the Mad Max series or a newcomer, this is gleeful, calculated, visceral mayhem. It ought to be a crime to be this bonkers and badass.\n\nRate this:\n\nI am unstoppable. As always, organized by my increasing enjoyment of them.\n\nMeh/Misguided:\n\nI imagine the helper monkey industry suffered a blow after this flick hit VCR’s across America. George Romero (yeah, THAT George Romero) directs this horror thriller about a quadriplegic law student whose monkey-nurse, Ella, links minds with him to exact a series of revenge killings in Monkey Shines (1988). It’s ridiculous, silly, and full of laughable monologues, but that’s kinda why I watched it. Stupid, but enjoyable because it is so nonsensical and stupid. John Pankow and Stanley Tucci co-star.\n\nI was truly disappointed. Dirty Work (1998) may star comic geniuses, Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange (and feature Don Rickles, Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Jack Warden, and be directed by Bob Saget), but it has that lazy, squeaky clean Happy Madison stamp all over it. The movie wastes Norm and Artie’s talents with the obvious, by-the-numbers plot and yawn-inducing script. It has one or two entertaining scenes and some great line deliveries speckled throughout, but for a big Norm MacDonald fan this was a letdown. It does, however, boast the funniest prison rape scene.\n\nBetter, but still kinda meh:\n\nGru is an evil genius who wants to prove his thievery prowess is not outdated by stealing the moon. He adopts three orphan girls who show him the value of family. He has an army of eraser-like minions for comic relief and added cuteness factor. Despicable Me (2010) is a likable enough little film with some nice design and cool gadgets, but it never quite wows.\n\nFor completion’s sake I watched Muppets Most Wanted (2014). It’s not exactly a bad movie, just maybe not a great Muppet movie. The stuff that works best is the stuff that’s a little more daring, unusual, and un-Muppety, while the Muppets themselves feel somewhat stale and lost in the wrong movie. I chuckled at a few gags, I enjoyed the gulag stuff, and I liked a few of the songs quite a bit, but I think these Muppets need to retire or be taken in a more interesting direction.\n\nOkay…:\n\nMarjane Satrapi (Persepolis) directs this pitch black comedy about mental illness starring Ryan Reynolds. The Voices (2014) is not funny. Comedic mainly in premise and presentation, its content is downright disturbing. Jerry (Reynolds) talks to his dog and cat and they talk right back. Representing opposing sides of his chemically imbalanced brain, they confuse him to the point of serial murder. The voices themselves (also played by Reynolds) are well defined and interesting, the cinematography and effects are handled beautifully, and the supporting cast (Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick, and Jacki Weaver) are fine, but for some reason I could never shake the uncomfortable meshing of horror with this strange sense of comedy. In Monsieur Verdoux it works because he’s not mentally ill, he’s just a greedy, murdering jerk. Maybe it’s brilliant and I’m just missing it, but for me this was a tragedy in comedy clothing.\n\nBob Hope spews one-liners and Jane Russell is tough as nails in the cowboy comedy, The Paleface (1948). It’s not Bob Hope’s best and it bears a lot of the cringe-worthy Native American stereotypes common of this era of Hollywood. The whole time I kept wishing it was My Little Chickadee with W.C. Fields and Mae West (the married relationships in both movies are similar). It’s whatever. All in all, an inoffensive comedy romp…except for Native Americans.\n\nGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (2015) is a documentary about the Church of Scientology. We see all the seedy inner workings, the lies, the scandals, the power struggles, the ruined lives. It’s something that would be truly interesting to someone who had no idea what the Church of Scientology was prior to viewing. The movie is a great primer and lesson in cult practices with genuinely fascinating central figures. My problem was that I was familiar with most of this stuff before I watched it so it never struck me as anything groundbreaking. Having visited their free museum in Hollywood and gotten a free street stress test (for laughs) already, I gotta say: they do a crap job of covering up being a pack of deranged wackos. Someone who needs this documentary to tell them that has clearly never discussed Scientology with a Scientologist before. It’s an important expose on stuff that should already be common knowledge.\n\nA Field in England (2013) is a black-and-white minimalist psychedelic period drama set in an empty field near a 17th century battle. If that doesn’t get you, you probably won’t like this. A cruel alchemist enlists some deserters to dig up treasure for him. There is eating of magic mushrooms and violence. It’s slow and weird and has a lot of dick. It had some individual scenes I really enjoyed, but I never “got” what it was about. Maybe I need to watch it again.\n\nFun:\n\nYeah, yeah. I saw Joss Whedon’s Marvel’s Avenger’s: Age of Ultron (2015). I’ll come clean, I still don’t entirely get the appeal of most of the Marvel superhero movies. I don’t think they’re all bad movies. They just all look like the same candy-colored cartoon violence buildings-exploding movies. I never feel the weight of the threat and I never really feel tension or suspense in any of them. Call Nolan’s Batmans overly dour and brooding, but at least I felt the tension and stakes. That said, the best bits for me were the smaller character moments (Thor’s face when Captain Planet almost moves the hammer) and some of the dialogue was punchy and fun. Most of the action blurs together, but I did enjoy Iron Man fighting the Hulk. Not having read the comics, I have no idea what the magic stone things are or what they do or what the flying robot guy with the cape was or what his powers are and a bunch of other stuff was lost on me, but I can’t say it was a poorly done movie. It was exactly what I thought it would be and exactly what the audience is looking for, I’m sure.\n\nIf you thought A Bug’s Life was too talkie, check out Minuscule: Valley of the Lost Ants (2013). Based on a series of French short animations, this quirky comedy features adorable cartoon bugs against real life backgrounds. Wordless, and relying entirely upon humorously juxtaposed sound effects (flying beetles sound like car traffic), wide-eyed expressiveness, and cuteness factor, the film tells the story of a lost baby ladybug who helps a colony of ants protect its bounty of sugar cubes. It’s slight and simple, but cute and clever enough to sustain your attention. The chases and battles are pretty fun.\n\nA Trip:\n\nI’m a fan of magician, skeptic, and chicanery-exposing James Randi. An Honest Liar (2014) is a documentary that covers portions of his fascinating life (mirroring much of the life-trajectory of Houdini) and his mission to reveal spiritualist con-artists for the charlatans they are. It’s a loving tribute to the old codger. Like Going Clear, it may not cover anything new for people already familiar with the man’s life work, but it was nice to see it all in one place.\n\nIn all honesty, Roar (1981) is not a good movie. Yet, I love it. Meant to be squirrelly family comedy with animal hijinks, the film actually plays like a taut, nail-biting thriller. Let’s back up. Tippi Hedren (The Birds) wanted to make a movie with lions. In order to realize her dream, she and her family raised hundreds of lions and big cats for several years. The story shows a family trapped in a house with these aforementioned hundreds of lions (and a few tigers, cheetahs, panthers, and a couple bull African elephants). Wacky, right? Except there’s no special effects or stunts. It’s just an actual family in constant peril and threat of being mauled by mobs of wild carnivores. It is one of the most insane movies I’ve ever seen. Much of the cast and crew (including Tippi’s children) sustained multiple injuries from animal attacks throughout the filming. This film is madness manifest.\n\nThe Monkees’ surreal musical Head (1968), may not quite live up to the same high-spirited whimsical anarchy of The Beatles’ films (although, it might be better than Help!), but it’s got enough zany meta quirk powering its engines that it’s still a fun romp. The film is basically a series of mostly unrelated vignettes and episodes mocking television, war, advertising, and whatever else set to some great tunes from The Monkees. Bonus points for having the most bizarre use of Victor Mature ever.\n\nPanos Cosmatos concocts a truly weird and deliberately paced sci-fi horror about telepathy in Beyond the Black Rainbow (2010). Trapped for the purposes of study, a young woman is observed by a cold and mercurial scientist at the Arboria Institute. There isn’t much dialogue and not much is explained, yet the film is so visually striking and surreal that it has a weird appeal. The textures and atmosphere and colors and cinematography are so hypnotic that I could recommend it on aesthetics alone. The brokenness of the doctors is fascinating and the imagery sticks in the mind. Not for everybody, but certainly for some.\n\nThe Curious Sandwich:\n\nI re-watched Mike Judge’s cult classic Office Space (1999). I loved it when I first saw it, but strangely it might have been even funnier on this second viewing. Maybe because I now have had experience working in an office and I too have become increasingly critical of the inanity of professional formalities. The movie is still hilarious and still a biting indictment of what adulthood is expected to be. Still Judge’s best film and still a breath of fresh air. The great cast includes Ron Livngston, Gary Cole, Diedrich Bader, Jennifer Aniston, John C. McGinley, and Stephen Root.\n\nSergio Leone’s films seemed to get longer the older he got. Once Upon a Time in America (1984) feels like the 4 plus hours it is, but its atmosphere is so rich and its scenery so sumptuous that you don’t mind soaking in the beautifully realized details of an old New York City long gone. Robert De Niro and James Woods are Jewish gangsters growing up during the Prohibition. Told in flashback, we witness the friendships, betrayals, murders, and regrets of a lost era. While the movie is slow, I don’t think I’ve ever seen more beautiful cinematography or New York City look more detailed and gorgeous.\n\nDave Chappelle stars as a weed loving janitor who must raise money with his stoner roommates to get their buddy out of the slammer (he’s jailed for accidentally murdering a diabetic police horse via Funions and pizza). Their plan is to sell weed, but when Chappelle falls in love with a substance teetotaler he has to choose between the kush or the bush. Yes, Half Baked (1998) truly is a stoner classic that I had somehow never watched in its entirety. Thing is, it’s legitimately funny and Chappelle proves to be the perfect leading man for this story. Cast highlights include Steven Wright, Clarence Williams III, Jim Breur, Harland Williams, and a bevy of fun cameos (Tommy Chong, Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson, Jon Stewart, Janeane Garofalo, etc.). Rachel True is hot, but playing a thankless role as the hot girl.\n\nYeah, I sandwiched Leone’s crime epic between two infantile comedies from our childhood.\n\nEver Stalwart:\n\nWilliam Wellman’s Wild Boys of the Road (1933) is a pre-Code Depression-era road drama about kids of laid off fathers who decide to become train-hopping hobos rather than be a financial burden on their families. It’s a simple, if somewhat optimistically unbelievable, premise but the journey they go on is fascinating, mired by troubles, and despite amputations, thuggery, and possible rape somehow still resiliently optimistic. It’s a very American film. It’s a side of humanity that is both harsh and rarely depicted in old Hollywood flicks (sans Charlie Chaplin movies). Gritty yet sweet, Wild Boys of the Road is a curious time capsule that any cinephile should investigate.\n\nHow had I never seen Bill Murray’s only directed movie? [Co-directed with Howard Franklin] Quick Change (1990) is a great comedy about the post bank heist anxieties of trying to navigate New York City to get to the airport on time. Bill Murray, Geena Davis, and Randy Quaid are bank robbers who have had enough of the daily grind and so decide to retire early. Jason Robards is the cop hot on their trail. It’s great suspense and great comedy. I was especially pleased to see Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci in supporting roles. Despite Quaid’s overly hammy performance, the movie manages to be a sweetly cynical crime caper.\n\nMuch like Half Baked, I had never sat down and watched John Carpenter’s They Live (1988) all the way through. “Rowdy” Roddy Piper stars as a drifter who stumbles upon a secret. When he dons the weird sunglasses he sees the world for what it is: an elaborate advertisement to force humans to blindly consume. Naturally, the conspiracy is all orchestrated by gross, lipless aliens. It’s got some great lines, ridiculous fights, wonderful social satire, and a grim dose of truth. It also has one of the best movie endings ever. EVER! Keith David co-stars.\n\nThe Wave Finally Peaks:\n\nEmilio Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton star in Alex Cox’s darkly weird cult sci-fi comedy, Repo Man (1984). Otto (Estevez) is a punk who winds up repossessing cars with a bunch of lunatics who like to pop uppers and wax philosophic about the art of being a repo-man. It’s a truly unique movie that is neither obvious nor exactly easy, but it is an unforgettable and quirky viewing experience.\n\nFederico Fellini directs the great Anthony Quinn in La Strada (1954), but the real star is Giulietta Masina. It’s the story of a poor, naive country girl who is sold to a nomadic strongman. Though she is optimistic and full of wide-eyed wonder and good humor, her sweet character and odd appearance earn her no respect in the eyes of her abusive master. It is a compelling drama set against the landscape of rural Italy.\n\nRobert Altman made some pretty enigmatic movies in his time. As loopy as Brewster McCloud was, 3 Women (1977) might even be more odd…if less obviously so. Sissy Spacek is an awkward country waif who gets a job nursing the elderly. She immediately attaches herself to the awkward and vapid Shelley Duvall character. They develop a strange, uncomfortable bond and bizarre connection with a silent painter played by Janice Rule. After an accident their roles are turned upside down and the mystery of who these characters are only gets weirder. This movie is a quiet type of insanity and I really had no idea where it was going scene to scene. As baffling as much of it is, I kind of loved it. Weeks later, I’m still thinking about it.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is The Hitch-Hiker (1953) directed by Ida Lupino. It’s a simple set up. Two fishing buddies (Edmond O’Brien and Frank Lovejoy) on their way through Mexico pick up a hitchhiker who turns out to be sociopath and serial killer (William Talman). The rest of the film is a series of tense situations as the killer plays sick mind games with the two helpless men as they try to figure a way to communicate and outsmart their captor before he kills them both. It’s a fabulous vintage suspense thriller.\n\nRate this:\n\nI grew up watching the Muppets. Loved The Muppet Show, Muppet Babies, Fraggle Rock, Sesame Street, The Jim Henson Hour, you name it. The Muppets’ variety act lent itself to parodying countless popular songs over the years, but it also led to numerous original songs, some of which are really hard to forget. This is a ranked list of the origi"
