        "text": "They're a Weird Mob is part of the humour canon. By Greg Burchall.\n\nA GENERATION before Baz Luhrmann unleashed Australia upon a lucky nation of the same name, bonzer box office boffo was made by They're a Weird Mob, the tale of a hapless Italian immigrant who finds himself bamboozled by the \"strine\" lingo and crude culture of mid-century Sydney.\n\nThe film had an impressive roll-call of Australian talent — Chips Rafferty, John Meillon, Ed Devereaux, Graham Kennedy and Bondi Beach — and was based on the 1956 bestselling novel written by one Nino Culotta, who, upon investigation, turned out to be restless Irish-Australian pharmacist John Patrick O'Grady.\n\n\"Yer a dago, aren't yer?\" asks a friendly bloke called Kelly. \"Bigger than most, but a dago all the same.\" It's not a word you hear much these days.\n\n\"It's a time capsule,\" says John Patrick O'Grady's son, also John O'Grady, a former ABC writer and producer. \"Dad's Australia no longer exists, except as a dream dimly remembered, but I'm sure grand English ladies are still getting it on with crude Australian stockmen, especially when so many of them look like Hugh Jackman.\"\n\nThe book even did the rounds of the Hollywood cast in Melbourne to shoot On the Beach, in 1958. Although he probably understood little of the humour, Gregory Peck knew that bestsellers usually meant guaranteed audiences and so took out an option. But the Australian film industry was moribund and Peck could not raise interest from US studios.\n\nBritish director Michael Powell, still reeling from the lacerating response to his great chiller Peeping Tom, took up the rights and attempted something lighter, in partnership with local theatre company J. C. Williamson.\n\nO'Grady says it was not a happy experience for his father. \"Dad got on very well with Mickey Powell and trusted him, but was very disappointed at the return he got from the film,\" he says.\n\n\"Dad wrote a script, which was terrible — he was many things but not a scriptwriter — so Powell went to his retired collaborator Emeric Pressburger. They did some fantastic things together — Red Shoes, Colonel Blimp — but their hearts weren't in this and they didn't understand the culture.\"\n\nJ. C. Williamson and Powell offered the writer a percentage of the net (profits) but everyone, including his agent-son, advised O'Grady to demand a cut of the gross (box-office income). O'Grady took Powell's deal and, as a result of typical creative accounting, never saw a cent in his lifetime (he died in 1981).\n\n\"Powell knew how to stroke Dad and involve him — he got 100 quid a week as dialogue adviser — so he never thought Powell would screw him. But he got precious little royalties out of it, which upset him.\"\n\nThe film's phenomenal success, however, boosted book sales and made O'Grady rich, enabling him to become a full-time writer. He wrote another three Culotta books and 16 books under his own name.\n\n\"Dad loved being a celebrity, did a lot of public speaking, and he loved it,\" says O'Grady.\n\n\"There are some great moments in the film and the cast is terrific.\"\n\nO'Grady snr was a pharmacist who hated his trade, so he would regularly do something offbeat: walk to Bathurst and back, help someone he met in a bar to build a house, learn Italian from his barber.\n\n\"Dad's brother Frank wrote Australian historical novels,\" says O'Grady. \"Dad didn't like them and said, 'If I couldn't write a better book, then I wouldn't even start.' So my uncle bet him 10 quid he couldn't even write a book.\"\n\nAt this stage, the writer was teaching pharmacy in Samoa for the New Zealand government, but he sent back the completed manuscript of They're a Weird Mob to his son so he could collect on the wager.\n\nO'Grady jnr took the manuscript to Angus & Robertson, but it was rejected — the letter is still a reminder on the office wall — so he went to Ure Smith, a mainly non-fiction publisher, and it was accepted. Many reprints, the last in 1995, and more than a million copies later, the book is enshrined in the popular humour canon along with works by Henry Lawson and C. J. Dennis.\n\nThere was an attempt in the early 1980s to turn Weird Mob into a TV sitcom, which is familiar turf for O'Grady jnr, who has nurtured, produced and sold such shows as Mother and Son, Trial by Marriage, Dearest Enemy and Eggshells during 20 years at the ABC. The multiple Australian Writers Guild Awards winner says the 1970s and '80s was a golden era when \"there was nothing like the buzz of getting a good show into production\".\n\nThings are still weird out there in the film industry."
