        "text": "An international movie shot on location in a lost village near Parkes, and which sank into critical and commercial oblivion, has been revived by a local historian.\n\nIf not for Dan Fredericks catching a passing comment from a local, the film may have stayed forgotten.\n\n\"So I was like, OK. There's a decent story here.\"\n\nSunstruck the movie\n\nThe year was 1972 and the movie was Sunstruck, a British-Australian co-production starring Welsh actor, comedian and singer Harry Secombe. It also starred Australian actor John Meillon.\n\nSunstruck was the second film ever to receive funding from the then fledgling Australian Film Development Commission.\n\nBut the 70s were not a sunny time for Australian cinema, as society grappled with complex identity issues and Sunstruck suffered badly at the box office.\n\n\"The Australian film industry almost died in the '70s because Australian audiences would not go and see Australian films,\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\nThe classic fish-out-of-water plot was inspired by a promotional poster from the NSW Department of Education.\n\nCreated to try to entice British teachers to New South Wales, it featured a British teacher wearing a mortar board, gown and little else on Bondi Beach.\n\n\"That triggered the film's writers to go 'This could be a good idea for a film' — but have him not land on Bondi Beach, but in a one-horse town where nothing happens,\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\nThis became the fictional setting of Kookaburra Springs, where Harry Secombe's wide-eyed character would wash up.\n\nThe lost villages of Wongalea and Nelungaloo\n\nWongalea and Nulungaloo had faded from the map well before the British film crew stumbled upon their remains.\n\nBoth towns lie roughly 30 kilometres west of Parkes and were at their modest heights in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nBy the 1960s their schools had closed and by 1970 they were considered localities.\n\nBut their charming bush buildings remained and cast a spell over a weary and disillusioned film crew, who had scouted a vast NSW outback for locations with no luck.\n\n\"They'd been driving out west and were coming back to Sydney,\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\n\"They've come through Parkes and someone has said, 'Oh, let's just go down this road and see where it heads'.\"\n\nThere they found Nelungaloo's original homestead Braeside — charming, weathered and empty.\n\nIt was purchased from the film's budget, of around $400,000, and would become the Kookaburra Springs' pub and teacher accommodation.\n\nNow all they needed was a schoolhouse.\n\n\"Someone in town said 'There's a school in Wongalea that's closed. You could probably have that'.\"\n\nWongalea's disused school building was moved to sit next to Braeside, creating a mini studio block in the middle of central-west NSW.\n\nThey became part of the town\n\nMr Fredericks said the production uncovered an accidental wealth of talent in the Parkes region, with the production coming to rely on locals for cast, set builders, body doubles, props and even animal trainers.\n\nCast and crew felt embraced by the town and became a part of village life outside of the production.\n\nCrew made the Coachman Hotel in Parkes their base and lead actors Harry Secombe and Maggie Fitzgibbon performed in a charity night at Parkes Leagues Club.\n\nMr Secombe especially bonded with the townsfolk.\n\n\"You forget that he was a big star,\" Mr Fredericks explained.\n\n\"Everybody said, 'He was so warm and friendly and he made people laugh'. There was no prima donna about him. He was there for the people.\"\n\nBut the greatest adventure was for the local children who featured.\n\n\"There were 16 children in the film and 14 were Parkes locals. The producers were amazed at the quality of the acting,\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\nFor the bush kids chosen, the summer of 1972 would be a mind-bending walk on the wild side.\n\n\"They had on-set catering, which served steak at one point. These kids had never had steak before. Growing up on a farm it was chicken or lamb or that's it,\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\nThe youngest local featured was seven-year-old Sharryn Cunningham from the tiny farming community of Bindogundra.\n\n\"Here I was at seven years old and the first time I'm in a cab is being sent home to Bindogundra after a long day of filming!\" she said.\n\nIn a final homage to the townsfolk, producers elected for the worldwide premiere to be held in Parkes.\n\nA man with a plan\n\nMr Frederick's meticulous research of the production's time in the region has triggered local and ex-local memories, and momentum is building in the community for a revisit.\n\n\"I've been sitting on my DVD copy for probably five years. 2022 is the 50-year anniversary of its filming but I don't think people are going to wait!\" Mr Fredericks said.\n\n\"I'd like to do something big for the library. I'd like there to be a public showing, with local cast and a Q&A maybe.\"\n\nHe said the real thrill had been uncovering the experience on behalf of those involved and stirring up memories of a truly novel and happy time in the district's history.\n\n\"I like the film, I enjoy watching it, but I'd really love to watch other people watching the film. Seeing the twinkle in their eye when they go 'Oh yeah, that bit — I'd forgotten that bit'.\"\n\nSuch as the line: \"Good heavens, it's Evans!\"\n\nSir Harry Secombe was a member of The Goon Show from 1951 to 1960, and was knighted in 1981 — jokingly referring to himself as Sir Cumference. He died in 2001."
