Erland | Brea, CA - USA | 04/19/2006\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"'Crocodile Dundee' is a highly entertaining comedy romance released in '86 that implanted such delightful Aussie terms as; \"G'day\" and \"out for a walkabout\" into Amercian mainstream consciousness.\n\nPaul Hogan is absolutely perfect as the man from down under, Michael J. 'Crocodile' Dundee who is pursued by an American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) in search of a good newspaper story about the elusive crocodile hunter roaming the Australian Outback. When their brief but intense encounter blossoms into romance she invites Mic to return to New York with her and see the sights. Can a naive Aussie fresh from the bush cope with the perils that accompany life in the Big Apple? You Bet!!\n\nGreat family fun with good performances by Hogan and Kozlowski as well as John Meillon as Mic's Outback partner, Walter and a brief but memorable cameo by David Gulpilil.\"\n\nVery entertaining movie.\n\nJ. Gibson | United States | 07/14/2001\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Paul Hogan (Lightening Jack, Flipper) stars as Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee, a crocodile hunter. Wealthy reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski, Favorite Son, Almost and Angel) meets him during an excursion into the Australian Outback. Dundee accepts Sue's invitation to return to New York City with her. He soon finds that New York life is much different than the life he is used to. Not only must he learn to acclimatize himself with the new surroundings and deal with the jealous boyfriend of Sue Charlton. There are so many excellent 'fish out of water' scenes from this film; too many to list in one review.This movie is very charming in its simplicity. It isn't full of confusing and complicated twists and turns at every angle, doesn't have several different subplots to keep up with and isn't full of murky characters that really have no purpose other than to take up a frame. It is a simple romantic comedy that is very much worth the time spent viewing it.\"\n\nHeck, it's just fun, fun, fun from opening to close...\n\nWilliam E. Adams | Midland, Texas USA | 10/05/2006\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Although this movie has the feel of \"low-budget\" and a cast of unknowns at the time, it just turned out to be so enjoyable that I can't downgrade it. It is impossible to dislike Paul Hogan, and while Linda, his co-star, only grows on you slowly as an actress, by the end she is effective as well. The first sequel was tolerable, the second was excreable, but the original holds up even over many years. The film makes you want to be a macho man like Mick Dundee, and to win a woman like Linda. I saw it once on the big screen, but every time it shows up on television I watch between 10 and 30 minutes of it, just to have a laugh or smile.\"\n\nA comedy classic ! Paul Hogan at his best!\n\nR. Paul | Marseille, France | 09/03/2005\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"First of all sorry for my English that is not my first language.\n\nBut I want to write a review about this film that is for me my favourite film ever and the best of the 3 of the serie of the Crocodile Dundee.\n\nEverytime I watch this movie I am happy to see it and don't stop laughing. I like very much the funny jokes of actor Paul Hogan and regret that for the moment that there is not a fourth one... We can always dream...\n\nThere are some actors you don't know why but they have something in themselves very special,and between you and them it works! I like very much Paul Hogan because it seems that is way of making laugh is natural, He has that inside.\n\nThank you Paul Hogan for this movie that will always make me laugh at any time of my life because you are a great man!\n\n\""
