An actor whose three decade career was highlighted by supporting work in the stunningly profitable "'Crocodile' Dundee" films and Nicolas Roeg's world cinema classic "Walkabout," John Meillon entered show business in 1959, appearing in the Gregory Peck-lead sci-fi film "On the Beach." During the first half of the 1960s, he often acted in British films, and in 1966, he returned to Australia to star in the hit sitcom "My Name's McGooley, What's Yours?," which ran through 1968. In 1971, Meillon took on a decidedly different role, making a brief but memorable appearance as a psychotic family man in the outback-set "Walkabout." Three years later, he stared in the horror comedy "The Cars That Eat People," an early effort from director Peter Weir, who would soon become one of the most lauded filmmakers to emerge from Australia. After Meillon worked with Weir, he continued to take on a considerable amount of film and television roles, and in 1986, was seen by audiences worldwide in the adventure comedy "'Crocodile' Dundee." He portrayed Walter Reilly in the film, the mentor to star Paul Hogan's title character. Meillon would go on to reprise his role in the 1989 sequel "'Crocodile' Dundee II," which yielded similarly massive box office numbers.
