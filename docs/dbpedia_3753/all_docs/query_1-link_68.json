        "text": "It's a race of four vying for a spot on the Nevada System of HIgher Education board in District 2.\n\nOf the 11 people on the Nevada State Board of Education, four are elected by voters -- one in each of the state's four Congressional districts.\n\nIncumbent Angela Orr is looking to retain the seat she was appointed to in October by Gov. Joe Lombardo. She is the principal at Doral Academy, a charter school in Reno. She is facing challengers Paul Davis, Dorzell King Jr. and Matthew Buehler.\n\nThe Reno Gazette Journal was not able to reach Buehler for this story.\n\nWho is on the State Board of Education? Of the 11 members, four are elected to four-year terms in presidential election years by voters in each of the state's four congressional districts. Three members are appointed by the governor, Senate majority leader and speaker of the state Assembly for a two-year term. Four non-voting members serve one-year terms.\n\nWho moves ahead in the general election?

We need to elevate the literacy rate of our students. Nevada is 43rd out of 50 states in literacy. We can and must do better and look for innovative ways to engage and support our students in achieving their academic and career goals. We cannot have our students continuously falling behind compared to other states.\n\nWe must have successful students for them to prosper and for our state's economic growth. We must excel in education, especially in technological literacy, essential in preparing our students for future technologies. We all know that technology continues to evolve rapidly in our society. Our students must be prepared to adapt to these changes.\n\nKing: I'm running to get involved with creating solutions for our students and educators. I am a concerned parent, not a career politician. I have 10 years combined experience as an early childhood educator and a permanent sub educator. My professional experience gives me the tools to handle complex issues, and to be a leader in driving actions that produce change.\n\nOrr: With over two decades of dedication to public schools, I have been a history and government teacher, a teacher trainer, a curriculum developer and a principal. I’ve worked at every level of education K-16, as I was also honored to teacher future educators for eight years at the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nI’ve also dedicated myself to the research on teaching reading and ensuring early literacy instruction works for all students. My passion for civic education drove me to a few local nonprofits, including the Nevada Center for Civic Engagement, which positively impacts civic education across our state with programs like We the People and History Day. I proudly lead Doral Academy. I also fervently advocate for education reforms and the equitable distribution of resources on the State Board of Education, working to ensure that every student in Nevada has access to a top-tier education.\n\nWhat do you think Nevada has to do to improve education and our state’s national rankings?\n\nDavis: We must excel in education, especially technological literacy, to prepare our students for future technologies. We all know that technology continues to evolve rapidly in our society. Our students must be prepared to adapt to these changes.\n\nTechnological literacy will lead to success for our students in our world. We must offer state-of-the-art training for our teachers on the latest literacy instructional techniques and best practices in teaching. By emphasizing the fields of science, mathematics and technologies in our public schools should ensures that students are prepared for the workforce of tomorrow.\n\nThis readiness is essential for both personal career success and broader economic stability, which will hopefully lead to a higher national literacy state ranking and improvement in our educational system for Nevada.\n\nKing: First, we have to be committed to improving classroom teacher to student ratios. Second, we have to follow through on making classrooms safe for students and teachers. This means that we cannot tolerate violent students and we must foster strong relationships with law enforcement to combat gang activity. Lastly, our curriculum should not only focus on college readiness but basic job and independent living skills.\n\nOrr: Nevada's pathway to improving education and our national rankings is clear — we already possess the necessary knowledge and strategies. The real challenge lies in asserting our political will and in effective implementation of policies and practices that will make a difference. Nevada faces an alignment issue that prevents hard-working teachers and school staff from ensuring all students have what they need to be considered proficient and growing academically each year. My personal passion is increasing our literacy rate.\n\nWe must re-professionalize teaching and ensure that teachers are treated as educated, capable professionals who earn a good wage and who do not have to work in unsafe environments. And because we currently face a teacher shortage, we must also build strong and diverse pathways to becoming an endorsed teacher.\n\nWhat do you think is the role of schools in teaching children about topics such as sex education, cyber-safety, wellness, bullying?\n\nDavis: I would rather our children have too much information than too little so they can always make informed decisions about their lives. More knowledge is always better. I want students to know about sexually transmitted diseases and how to prevent them. Schools need to inform students about the risks of online activities and cyberbullying.\n\nThis goes for in-person bullying as well. It is up to the schools to teach mental and physical health and the critical need for a healthy body and mind for the rest of their lives. Finally, it is the responsibility of our schools to create a safe and welcoming environment for all students. This is vital for student well-being and academic success.\n\nKing: Sex education should be nothing more than basic biology. Only parents should teach values about sexuality, gender and community standards. Cyber-safety can be covered by schools and health/wellness as far as nutrition and exercise.\n\nWith bullying, schools can encourage kids to speak up and get help. But there needs to be more about helping kids have a strong and confident self-image so they are able to stand up against bullies and to make their own choices when faced with a crowd.\n\nOrr: Schools today are tasked with so much more than teaching core content. As educators, we take our responsibility to ensure that students are ready and able to learn as seriously as our responsibility to teach them. At (the Doral Academy) we prioritize explicit teaching and modeling of the habits of mind that lead to success in later life - being proactive, collaborating with synergy, understanding one’s emotions to better interact with others, and engaging in civil civic discourse around complex issues.\n\nOur students learn to respect and engage with diverse people and ideas. We allow all parents to preview our sexual health programming prior to engaging with students in the material, as we believe parent involvement and partnership is incredibly important to student success."
