Later, he moved to the Middle East and transitioned his focus to the analysis of Iran, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nServing in the U.S. Army, Mr. Davis was the lead analyst for MNA-3 Syria/Lebanon and coordinated with the IC on military and political issues affecting the tasked countries in regional and international activities. From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Davis served as lead intelligence analyst with the DIAâ€™s Iraq Division where he was responsible for Military and Political intelligence production in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nMr. Davis received his B.A. from Kean College of New Jersey and his M.A. from the American Military University.
