        "text": "In a stark challenge to the re-election prospects of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, more than 100 Republican politicians and former elected officials on Tuesday endorsed Paul Davis, his Democratic challenger.\n\nGovernor Brownback, who swept into office with more than 60 percent of the vote in 2010, faces an unexpectedly tough re-election this fall after spending much of his term pushing sharply conservative policies that have unsettled some members of his own party. Mr. Davis, a state legislator, has criticized Governor Brownback for his support of the largest income tax cuts in state history, cuts that sent revenues plummeting.\n\nThe group of 104 Republicans, which took the name Republicans for Kansas Values, included former mayors, a member of Congress and state representatives. They cited budget cuts to education and the income tax cuts as failed policies enacted by Mr. Brownback that have upset Kansas’ long history of cautious moderation.\n\n“I think Sam’s experiment, as he’s called it, is backfiring on us,” Wint Winter, a banker and former state senator, said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s gone way too far. We’re all very alarmed by the damage to our public schools, very alarmed by the damage to the state’s financial responsibility and very alarmed about the credit downgrade that Wall Street is paying attention to.”\n\nLarge income tax cuts signed into law in 2012 and 2013, with the support of a Republican-controlled Legislature, have caused deep concern among Kansans about the state’s financial stability. Since the cuts, state revenues have plummeted: In April and May, the state collected only $369 million from personal income tax, far short of the $651 million it had anticipated.\n\nIn May, Kansas’ credit rating was downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service, citing concern about the tax cuts and the state’s slow recovery from the recession.\n\nJohn Milburn, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that under Mr. Brownback’s leadership, “Kansas has created 53,400 new private-sector jobs, Kansas kids have 676 more certified teachers in the classroom, and recently provided $84 million in property tax relief for hard-working families.”\n\nHeath Kohl, the political director for the Kansas Republican Party, dismissed the group’s criticisms as something out of the children’s tale “Henny Penny,” calling it “Chicken Little, sky is falling” chatter.\n\n“Here you have this small group of people saying we’re going in the wrong direction,” he said. “I travel the state a lot, and I have yet to meet anybody who said we should raise taxes. Everybody knows we have to create a pro-job, pro-growth environment.”"
