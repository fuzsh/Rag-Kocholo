        "text": "Three dozen republicans explained why they crossed party lines in a Monday news conference.\n\nAmong those on the list are Former Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger and Former Lt. Gov. Garry Sherrer.\n\n“Our support of Paul may not come as a surprise, but these extreme polarized times make our announcement today even more important,” Praeger said.\n\nSeveral announced their support for Democratic Congressional Candidate Paul Davis.\n\n“They know who I am and what I stand for, and that’s why you’re seeing a lot of support for our campaign,” Davis said.\n\nDavis is running against Republican Steve Watkins for the Second District Seat.\n\nDuring a Monday news conference, several Republicans said they believe Davis will reach across party lines.\n\n“No individual and no political party has all the best ideas all the time,” Rep. Tom Sloan added.\n\nMany also mentioned Watkins Lack of political experience.\n\n“Nobody wants to send an amateur to represent them who needs on the job training. I’m ready to hit the ground on day one,” Davis said.\n\nIn a statement Watkins’ Official Campaign Spokesperson, Bill Piligra, said “Watkins’ vision for the 2nd District is a stark contrast to Davis’ 20 year record as a career politician. Piligra also said voters want lower taxes and enhanced border security.\n\nDavis said he will continue to focus on meeting the needs of Kansans.\n\n“…this election really needs to be about the people of Kansas who live here and the concerns that they have. And sending somebody to Washington who’s going to be responsive to them,” Davis added.\n\nDavis also had support from several Republicans when he ran for Governor four years ago.\n\nA new\n\npoll shows Davis with a one-point lead."
