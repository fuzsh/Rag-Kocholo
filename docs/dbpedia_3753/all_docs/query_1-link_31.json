        "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Prominent Democrat and former state lawmaker Paul Davis is considering a run for Congress in the 2nd District of eastern Kansas.\n\nDavis said Thursday that he expects to make a formal announcement about his plans this summer after spending several months talking to voters.\n\nDavis was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014, giving Republican Gov. Sam Brownback a tougher-than-expected re-election challenge. His Thursday announcement ends speculation that he might seek the governor's office again. Davis is a Lawrence attorney and former Kansas House minority leader.\n\nThe 2nd District seat will be open because Republican incumbent Lynn Jenkins does not plan to seek re-election.\n\nState Sen. Steve Fitzgerald of Leavenworth launched a campaign for the GOP nomination earlier this month.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
