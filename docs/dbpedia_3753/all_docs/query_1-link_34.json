        "text": "Paul Ryan (born January 29, 1970, Janesville, Wisconsin, U.S.) is an American Republican politician who served as a congressman from Wisconsin in the U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2019), where he was speaker from 2015 to 2019. He was selected by Mitt Romney to be his vice presidential running mate in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nWhile studying economics and political science at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, Ryan began working for Republican Sen. Robert Kasten, first as an intern and, after graduating in 1992, as an aide. In 1993 he joined Empower America, a conservative think tank cofounded by Rep. Jack Kemp, as an economic adviser and speechwriter. From 1995 to 1997 Ryan served as legislative director for Rep. Sam Brownback, and during the 1996 presidential campaign he also worked as a speechwriter for Kemp, who was Bob Dole’s running mate; Dole and Kemp lost the election.\n\nIn 1998 Ryan successfully ran for a seat in the House of Representatives. After taking office the following year, he became especially focused on issues relating to fiscal policy. In 2008 he released the first version of his “Roadmap for America’s Future,” a controversial budget plan that included a major overhaul of the tax code, the partial privatization of Social Security, and the transformation of Medicare into a voucher program. It also called for Medicaid to be replaced by state-controlled systems funded by federal block grants. Although the proposal failed to garner much support among Republicans in Congress, it proved popular with the party’s conservatives, and Ryan’s influence within the party greatly increased.\n\nAfter Republicans regained control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2011. Later that year he unveiled “Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promises,” a revised budget plan that called for individual and corporate tax cuts, trillions of dollars in spending cuts, and an overhaul of Medicaid; privatization of Social Security was not mentioned. The plan also included the repeal of Pres. Barack Obama’s health care reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare). In 2011 the plan passed the House but was voted down in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Another Ryan budget, “Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal,” was passed by the House in 2012.\n\nRyan’s positions on social issues—notably his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage—reflected his religious convictions as a Roman Catholic and were also popular with conservatives. In August 2012 Romney chose Ryan as his running mate in the presidential election. Ryan gave a strong performance in October at the vice presidential debate against his Democratic counterpart, Joe Biden. On November 6 the Republican ticket was defeated by Obama’s successful bid for a second term.\n\nRyan continued to be an influential member of the Republican Party, and in 2015 he became chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Later that year he emerged as the leading candidate to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House. Boehner, amid growing unrest among conservatives, had abruptly announced his intent to leave office. Faced with deep divisions within the party, Ryan agreed to become speaker only after receiving the promised support from several right-wing groups. He was easily elected, and on October 29, 2015, he assumed office, becoming the youngest person to hold the post in nearly 150 years.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Ryan supported Donald Trump, the eventual Republican nominee and winner, though he often voiced criticism of Trump. He subsequently sought to implement a number of Trump’s campaign pledges. In 2017 Ryan notably oversaw the House’s approval of legislation that effectively repealed Obamacare, though the measure failed in the Senate. Later that year, however, he helped secure congressional passage of a major tax reform bill, one of the representative’s long-standing goals. In April 2018—amid speculation that the Republicans might lose control of the House in the midterm elections (a prediction that proved correct)—Ryan announced that he would not seek reelection, and he stepped down when his term ended in January 2019. Two months later he joined the board of directors of Fox Corporation, the parent company of the Fox News Channel."
