        "text": "Bay Street Theater is hosting an exclusive exhibition with Keyes Gallery featuring the extraordinary works of celebrated artist and illustrator Paul Davis. Open to the public and free of charge, this captivating showcase, scheduled to run from August 1 to September 30, opens with a reception with the artist on Friday, August 11, from 5 to 7 p.m., promises to take visitors on an artistic journey through the world of theater posters.\n\nDavis is widely acclaimed for his exceptional talent in capturing the essence and magic of live performances through his iconic illustrations. His unique style, blending a keen understanding of the performing arts with striking visuals, has earned him a prominent place in the industry. Davis is known for his iconic images for posters, theaters, and museums. Kurt Vonnegut praised his work as “theater itself.” His distinctive paintings and posters for advertising, publishing, and entertainment have been the subject of museum and gallery exhibitions throughout Japan, Italy and cities around the U.S.\n\nHe formed the Paul Davis Studio in 1963, working first in New York and later in Sag Harbor, where he and his wife, Myrna, still live. His artistic style had a tremendous impact on the field of illustration. His illustrations have appeared in Life, Time, Playboy, Look, The Saturday Evening Post, Sports Illustrated and many other publications. From 1984 to 1982, Davis was Art Director of Joseph Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\nThe Bay Street Theater exhibition will showcase a curated selection of Paul Davis’s most cherished theater posters, which have graced numerous Broadway productions, off-Broadway shows, and acclaimed regional performances. Visitors can expect to be captivated by the depth of emotion and creativity that each poster exudes, reflecting the artist’s deep connection to the theatrical world.\n\n“We are thrilled to host this extraordinary exhibition by Paul Davis,” said Tracy Mitchell, the theater’s executive director. “His artwork has a way of transcending the boundaries of paper and ink, effectively conveying the heart and soul of every production he touches. It is a true privilege to have his art grace our gallery walls and share his incredible talent with the Sag Harbor community.\"\n\nThe exhibition will be on view in the Bay Street Theater Lobby Gallery. Art enthusiasts, theater lovers and the general public are all invited to come see the show. Bay Street Theater is on Long Wharf in Sag Harbor."
