We go to bed every night feeling profoundly thankful for all the work you and your team accomplished. We are truly impressed with the energy and thoughtfulness you brought to the project.”\n\n“I give my highest recommendation to Paul Davis after the wonderful experience we had with him and PDA. His advice, support, and design insights have been so important to our home renovation process in West LA. Paul is intelligent, thorough, and compassionate – he is an engineer and artist. He does not miss the smallest detail and his ideas saved us money, and more importantly nerves.\n\nHe is kind, punctual and very generous with his time and his knowledge. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an excellent architect.”\n\n“I’ve been lucky to know Paul Davis for many years and have always appreciated his high IQ and great positive energy. I recently hired him and his great team for an important project at my home in Santa Monica. The interaction was terrific. They listened to my ideas and then came back with designs that were above and beyond, and in one case totally magical. They are consummate pros and fair and smart. The whole team is great. Have them look at your project, for sure. Their ideas are awesome!”\n\n“Beautiful architecture that is well executed is a difficult process and the PDA team possesses that rare and magical combination of vision and precise attention to detail. The final product of our 5,300 square-foot, full-floor condominium renovation was elegant, functional and a fabulous home. Without the attention to detail, it is hard to control the project, the budget or the outcome. We were so happy to find a team that cared about all aspects of our project.”\n\n“After buying our first house, we tasked Paul with transforming it into our “forever” home. From the start, Paul and his team understood the brief better than we did. They designed and oversaw the construction, perfectly balancing timeless form and beauty with the functional requirements necessary for a growing family of five. Paul was attentive and responsive throughout the process, especially as we navigated the challenging headwinds of the Covid epidemic. Now that we’re in the house, we still can’t quite believe we get to live in such a gorgeous home. We’re so grateful to Paul and his team for their outstanding work, and so excited to enjoy our home for years to come!”"
