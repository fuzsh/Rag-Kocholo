        "text": "WASHINGTON – A nail-biter in Ohio. A resounding victory for labor unions in Missouri. And a sharp pivot toward the general election across the country.\n\nThose were just a few highlights from elections held across five states on Tuesday, from Michigan to Washington State.\n\nOhio's special election soaked up most of Tuesday's political spotlight, as Republican Troy Balderson clung to a narrow lead over Democrat Danny O'Connor.\n\nThe race was still too close to call early Wednesday, with several thousand provisional and absentee ballots still to be counted, according to the Ohio Secretary of State. But with all precincts results in, Balderson led O’Connor by 1,754 votes, or about .9 percent.\n\nThe photo-finish came in a district Republicans have held for more than three decades – made competitive this year mostly because of a fierce backlash against President Donald Trump. The outcome will be seen as a boon for Democrats, even if O'Connor loses, especially since Republicans spent more than $4 million on Balderson's behalf and dispatched Trump to the campaign trail.\n\nIf certified as the victor, Balderson will fill out the remaining months of ex-Rep. Pat Tiberi's term. Then, he and O'Connor will face off again in November for a full two-year term.\n\nAlthough the Ohio contest grabbed the most attention, voters in four other states chose nominees in a bevy of other crucial primaries on Tuesday.\n\nHere are the latest results in key races:\n\nKansas\n\nThe two leading Republican gubernatorial candidates in Kansas, incumbent GOP Gov. Jeff Colyer and Secretary of State Kris Kobach, remained locked in tight battle for the nomination.\n\nTrump weighed into the contested GOP primary Monday by endorsing Kobach, giving his favored candidate a surprise boost over the sitting Republican governor.\n\n\"Strong on Crime, Border & Military. VOTE TUESDAY!\" Trump said in a tweet supporting Kobach.\n\nKobach has repeatedly aired Trump's unproven claims of massive voter fraud, and he served as vice chair of the the president's controversial and now-disbanded commission set up to investigate those allegations.\n\nSome Republicans fret that if Kobach wins the primary, he could be vulnerable in a general election.\n\nDemocrats picked Laura Kelly, a veteran state senator, as their party's nominee. Although Kansas is a strongly GOP state, Democrats hope to make the governor's race competitive in November.\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins is one of 42 House Republicans not running for re-election this year, a record-high number that gives Democrats a better shot at winning control of the House in November.\n\nJenkins' eastern Kansas 2nd Congressional District would not be competitive if she had decided to stay on. Democrats got lucky when Paul Davis, a former state House minority leader, jumped into the contest and cleared the field. He has carried the district before, when he unsuccessfully ran for governor against Republican Sam Brownback in 2014.\n\nRepublicans nominated an Army veteran and political newcomer, Steve Watkins, to face Davis in November. He served in Afghanistan and is running as an anti-establishment figure.\n\nBut Watkins has attracted some controversy. His father set up a super PAC devoted to electing him. And he reportedly spoke with Democrats last year about a political run – although he denies he ever considered running as a Democrat.\n\nIn 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carried the 3rd Congressional District by 1 point – making incumbent GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder a top Democratic target in this election. First elected in 2010, Yoder won his last race with 51.3 percent of the vote.\n\nDemocrats picked Sharice Davids – a Native American lawyer and lesbian with a compelling personal biography – from a five-candidate field that highlighted the party’s divisions. Davids edged out Brent Welder, who embraced the insurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party and won the endorsement of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent socialist.\n\nSome Democrats feared the \"socialist\" label would not sell well in a general election in conservative Kansas. But Davids is also a progressive and would, if elected, become the first Native American woman in Congress and the first openly gay lawmaker from Kansas.\n\n“I’ve had to fight my whole life because of who I am, who I love and where I started,” Davids says in a video that highlights her training as a mixed martial arts fighter.\n\nThe match-up between Davids and Yoder could be one of the most competitive in the country come November, when control of the House will be at stake.\n\nMichigan\n\nThe November election for Michigan's next governor is headed for a showdown between Republican Bill Schuette and Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, both declared winners by 10 p.m. in Tuesday's primary.\n\nThe open seat for the top spot in Michigan government drew a slew candidates in Tuesday's primary. Current Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, is term-limited, and Democrats are hoping to recapture the governor's mansion in the general election.\n\nOn the GOP side, Schuette, the state's attorney general, won the Republican nomination, handily beating Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and two other contenders. Schuette’s victory came after an endorsement from Trump, which gave him a significant boost in the closing weeks of the race. Snyder had endorsed Calley.\n\nWhitmer, a former state Senate minority leader, emerged as the winner of the Democratic primary. She defeated Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the former head of the Detroit health department, and Shri Thanedar, an Ann Arbor-area scientist and entrepreneur.\n\nThe gubernatorial race is likely to be a toss-up come November.\n\nIn Michigan's Senate race, Republicans nominated a Trump-backed businessman and Iraq War veteran, John James, to face Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow in November. Stabenow is heavily favored to win a fourth term.\n\nAnother history-making candidate seemed poised to win in Michigan’s 13th Congressional District. Ex-state Rep. Rashida Tlaib led in the Democratic primary contest to replace former U.S. Rep. John Conyers, who held the seat for 52 years.\n\nIn a district that is overwhelmingly Democratic, Tlaib is all-but-certain to win again in November – an outcome that would make her the first Muslim woman in Congress.\n\nWith 96% of votes counted, Tlaib led with 33.2 percent of the vote, compared with 29.2 percent for Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones, considered a more establishment candidate.\n\nTlaib – a Muslim of Palestinian heritage in a district long associated with black Detroit – positioned herself as the most liberal and aggressive contender, promising to upend politics-as-usual in Washington. She calls herself “the bullhorn girl,” ready to take on health care, civil rights, educational equity and corporate greed.\n\nIn Michigan's hotly contested 11th Congressional District, two women — Lena Epstein and Haley Stevens, both running in their first campaigns — won their parties' respective primaries for an open seat in suburban Detroit expected to be one of the most closely watched races in the U.S. this fall. The incumbent Republican, Rep. Dave Trott, is stepping down.\n\nEpstein is a Republican businesswoman and Stevens is a former Obama administration official.\n\nTheir general election showdown will unfold in a district that has been reliably Republican in previous elections. But a relatively close result for Trump there in 2016 — he beat Hillary Clinton by 4 percentage points in the district — and the impending departure of Trott, has handicappers calling it a toss-up.\n\n\"This race could be on the very edge of House control,\" David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report wrote in a recent analysis of the House battleground races.\n\nMissouri\n\nIn a big win for organized labor, Missouri voters killed a \"right-to-work\" law that would have banned unions from collecting mandatory dues.\n\nThe GOP-led state legislature passed the law in 2017, but unions and Democrats blocked its enactment, and collected enough signatures to force Tuesday's public referendum. The fight drew big bucks and big names, including actor John Goodman, who cut an ad against the right-to-work law.\n\nThe outcome was a critical boost for labor unions, which have been weakened by a recent Supreme Court decision and other right-to-work laws across the country.\n\nIn the Missouri Senate race, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley both clinched easy nomination victories in Tuesday's primaries.\n\nTheir showdown this fall is expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive Senate races in the country, and the outcome could determine which party controls that chamber come January.\n\nWashington\n\nRepublican Rep. Dave Reichert made the 8th Congressional District seat a toss-up the instant he decided not to run for an eighth term. Democrats had salivated over the seat for years but could never beat the popular former sheriff.\n\nRepublican Dino Rossi advanced to the November election in Tuesday's voting. Rossi, a former state senator and real estate developer, is expected to be a formidable candidate in the general election.\n\nThe Democrats faced a contested primary among a slew of political newcomers, including Kim Schrier, a pediatrician; Jason Rittereiser, a former prosecutor; and Shannon Hader, a one-time public health official in the Obama Administration.\n\nSchrier held a 1,261 vote lead over Rittereiser on Wednesday as election Washington State officials continued to tally the results.\n\n\"This seat is a must-win in Democrats’ fight to take back the House,\" Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY'S List, told reporters last week. The group, which supports pro-abortion rights women candidates, is backing Schrier in the Washington race.\n\nMore: Ohio 12th special election: How Donald Trump turned this safe Republican seat into a toss-up\n\nMore: 'Right-to-work' up for a vote in Missouri: Here's what you need to know before Aug. 7\n\nMore: Exclusive: Democrats flood airwaves with health care ads, while GOP spots tout Trump in 2018 midterms\n\nContributing: Jessie Balmert of the Cincinnati Enquirer, Todd Spangler and Paul Egan of the Detroit Free Press, Will Schmitt of the Springfield News-Leader, and the Associated Press."
