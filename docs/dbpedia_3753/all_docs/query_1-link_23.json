        "text": "Please outline reasons you are the best candidate in the field to serve in the U.S. House?\n\nThe dysfunction of Washington has spiraled out of control, and I can’t sit back and do nothing. When bipartisanship becomes something that’s threatened by leaders as a last resort — rather than relied upon as the foundation for sound policymaking — the system has lost touch with America and no longer serves the public good. One person cannot change Congress alone, but every seat matters. I have a long history of building relationships across the aisle, finding compromise and getting things done as an elected official here in Kansas. We need more with that mindset in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been active on international trade. How has the president's actions helped or hurt the Kansas economy, especially agriculture, and how would you adjust the government's approach to trade?\n\nI convened an agricultural advisory group early in my campaign, and I’ve hosted roundtable discussions with Kansas producers and suppliers throughout the district. Without question, they are more worried about the President’s trade war than anything else. I am very supportive of renegotiating NAFTA to protect Kansas jobs, with the caveat that it does not cost Kansas market access. Our state ranks seventh in the nation for agricultural exports, and we cannot grow if trade tensions continue to escalate. It is critical that trade policy protect Kansas producers, retain existing foreign markets, and develop new and emerging markets.\n\nIn what ways would you reform federal law on funding of Planned Parenthood as well as the availability of legal abortion?\n\nI have never politicized women’s health and I never will. Planned Parenthood is one of our nation’s largest health care providers for women. They provide affordable birth control, vaccinations, lifesaving cancer screenings, testing and treatment for STDS, HIV screenings, miscarriage management, and other essential care to 2.5 million women each year.\n\nWhat should be the top priorities as Congress works to reform tax law? Explain benefits of your ideas.\n\nI support tax reform that helps middle class Kansans who have been left behind as corporations raked in record profits. As a legislator I voted to cut taxes over 150 times for Kansas families, seniors, and businesses. Unfortunately, the Republican tax law that Congress passed was a Brownback-style giveaway for special interests and campaign donors. It is exploding the national debt, stripping healthcare from 30,000 Kansans in this district, and ultimately raises taxes on Kansans earning less than $75,000 — all to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts.\n\nI say that instead of raising taxes on hardworking Kansas families, let’s cut them. Our tax code is riddled with loopholes. Most of these loopholes benefit big multinational corporations and the wealthiest Americans. They don’t help middle class Americans, they only help widen the gap between the very rich and the rest of us. If these loopholes and others are closed, we can recoup $900 billion in the next 10 years. Last December, I supported a plan to close those $900 billion worth of corporate loopholes and to use it to cut tax cuts for middle and lower income Americans. We need real tax reform for real people\n\nGun violence in the nation's cities, often brought into focus as a consequence of mass shootings, is a public health challenge. What are your recommendations for improving public safety while balancing constitutional right to bear arms? How should government better protect school buildings from shooters?\n\nI support the 2nd amendment and the individual right to bear arms. I’m also a dad, with a second grader who must practice “active shooter drills” with her classmates. Elected leaders have a responsibility to do more to keep our children safe, but they keep letting partisan politics get in the way. There are many commonsense, bipartisan ideas worthy of consideration to enhance gun safety without hampering constitutional rights. Some include strengthening the background check system so fewer violent criminals and domestic abusers get access to weapons, or laws to prevent individuals on terrorist watch lists from buying a gun.\n\nWhat is your view of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq? Would you propose scaling back the military's role or expanding it?\n\nThere is no question that we need to prevent the return of Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorists. We also need a smart, defined strategy for bringing our troops home. That means more than a military-only approach. We have the best, strongest military in the world, but we also need to utilize diplomacy and the support of our allies to get our troops home.\n\nDo you believe the law should be amended to limit the role of special-interest spending in federal campaigns? What is your view of super PACs that leave a heavy footprint on campaigns?\n\nAbsolutely. Every dollar spent by out-of-state special interest groups or dark money organizations to influence our election silences the voices of Kansans who actually live here. The obscene amounts of money flooding our campaigns and elections have fundamentally broken our government. We’ve reached a point where members of Congress are all but ‘renting themselves out’ to high dollar campaign contributors, and Americans are fed up with billionaires setting the agenda. Changing the system is how we give Kansans back their voice and restore accountability to Congress.\n\nHow should the federal government change its approach to illegal immigration, border security, work permits, visas or handling of undocumented adults and children?\n\nWashington’s failure to fix our immigration system has created a national crisis. We need leaders who will stop politicizing the problem and find a bipartisan solution that is tough, practical, and humane.\n\nOpen borders are dangerous and put Kansas communities at risk. I support stronger border security, improved vetting procedures, and more resources for law enforcement to target criminals in the country illegally. I oppose the abolishing ICE. Additionally, “safe havens” for drug dealers, gangs, and other criminals cannot be tolerated. America is a nation of laws, and anyone who commits a violent crime must be prosecuted to the law’s fullest extent — no exceptions.\n\nAmerica is also nation of immigrants. This is why I support the Dream Act and strongly oppose family separation. We have a moral obligation to protect children and young people who were brought here by no fault of their own. I am frustrated that innocent children remain at risk because Washington is too broken to act — even when there is bipartisan agreement.\n\nImmigration reform is a complex and serious issue. However, years of hardline rhetoric by politicians who exploit the issue have resulted in an America that is more divided and less safe. It’s time to find a compromise that will fix our immigration system once and for all.\n\nWhat is your analysis of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller? Should there be new limits on such inquiries?\n\nRobert Mueller is a respected prosecutor and should be allowed to complete his investigation; I would be seriously concerned if any president intervened, regardless of party. I support bipartisan proposals in Congress to prevent this potential outcome, but I feel further politicization of the matter - before the investigation concludes or evidence officially made public - is unhelpful. I’m focused on the issues I hear about every day in Kansas, which include the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, the rigged nature of our tax code to benefit corporations and the wealthy, and the dangerous stranglehold lobbyists and special interests currently have on Washington.\n\nHow do you propose to tackle the wave of fatalities tied to prescription and illegal drug addiction that is touching communities throughout the nation?\n\nIt's time for Congress to stop dragging its feet on this issue — abuse of prescription drugs has become a public health crisis across the United States. This is certainly an area where I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together. I support recent efforts to speed up the development of non-addictive painkillers, stepping up enforcement efforts to stop the flow of addictive drugs from other countries, and sending more grant money into states to combat the problem with prevention and treatment.\n\nHere is the 2018 C-J General Election Voters Guide as it appeared in the Sunday, Oct. 14 newspaper."
