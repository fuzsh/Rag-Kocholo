        "text": "The definition for Liar: A person who tells lies.\n\nSynonyms: fabricator, fabulist, fibber, prevaricator, storyteller.\n\nRelated Words: exaggerator, mythomaniac, calumniator, defamer, libeler, libelist, slanderer; perjurer; distorter, falsifier; equivocator, palterer; gossip, gossiper, talebearer; charlatan, cheat cheater, counterfeiter, cozener, deceiver, defrauder, dissembler, dissimulator, double-dealer, fraud, hustler, knave, mountebank, operator, pretender.\n\nAs the 2016 City of Riverside Mayoral Campaign unfolds, I am dumbfounded by all the storytelling that comes from Councilman Paul Davis. As we fact check the fabrication of details he delivers to the public, we are perplexed by his continuous chatter that gets more meaningless over time. Is he trying to hustle or confuse the public, and all the other candidates?\n\n1. I stated Mr. Davis wanted to privatize trash haulers and he would give Burrtec the contract because Burrtec is a contributor to his campaign: Paul Davis stated very clearly, he never received campaign contribution from trash haulers: These documents state very clearly that he is receiving money from Cole Burr who happens to own Burrtec. He also received tickets to the speedway. Please look very closely to the entire 2015 campaign contribution and expenses. You might find some other very interesting facts, such as who else owns Paul?\n\n460 Davis (01-01-14 – 06-30-14)_R 460 Davis (01-01-15 – 06-30-15)_R 700 Davis, Paul (1-1-14 – 12-31-14)\n\n2. I made a comment about the reduction in Police Officers. Paul Davis stated that we are not cutting police officers, “no one is cutting officers.” The Press Enterprise stated in a current article the City would be demoting Lieutenants to Sergents, in addition, we have 17 unfunded positions that we will be eliminating. Maybe Mr. Davis doesn’t know what ‘cut’ means, let’s help him: to take away, detach, trim, reduce.\n\n3. I explained to the public the budget cuts that will be made will affect the taxpayer, police, fire, streets, tree trimming etc. I also explained that the intelligent leadership of our City exchanged ‘Public Safety’ for ‘Government Entertainment,’ and the Council will never cut Government Entertainment. Paul just plain fibbed about the cuts to the Fox and the Convention Center. He said they were going to cut to $300,000. What the heck was he talking about? He must have pulled the $300,000 figure out of his hat. The contracts in place for the Fox and the Convention Center keep going up. Each contract started at about $1.5 to $1.9 million dollars.\n\n4. He keeps on exaggerating that Councilman Mike Soubirous and himself fought to cut the budget. Paul Davis and Mike Soubirous voted YES to every budget increase there was. Mike Soubirious in NOT endorsing Paul Davis for Mayor. There is a reason for that!\n\nThirty Miles of Corruption can find countless times during the election process that Mr. Davis was deceiving the public. Here are just 4 examples of the double-talking Councilman who wants to be your Mayor. So far Davis has demonstrated that he is a bully and a distorter. You decide which word or words effectively describes Paul Davis! Vote 2016.\n\nWe are just going to call Davis “Lying Paul?” And that’s a matter of a fact!\n\nEVEN RUSTY BAILEY RECEIVED CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM COLE BURR OWNER OF BURRTEC WASTE, BUT WASN’T QUITE SURE."
