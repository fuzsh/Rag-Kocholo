        "text": "Former state Rep. Paul Davis of Sangerville, the Republican candidate for state Senate District 4, will face Democrat David Ziemer of Orneville Township in the Nov. 4 election.\n\nThe district includes nine towns in Somerset County, six in Penobscot County and most of Piscataquis County.\n\nDavis, 71, who won the party nod in the June primaries by defeating fellow conservative Douglas Thomas of Ripley, said he is running for office again because he wants to see more jobs come to Maine for an improved economy.\n\nZiemer, a Vietnam veteran who was unopposed in the June Democratic primary, said he is running for office because area Republicans have not done a good job on matters he considers important.\n\nDavis said that he wants “to see our young have a life in Maine.”\n\n“I also want to see our retirees stay in Maine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I am a voice of reason and proven leadership for central Maine. I have a deep desire to serve the people of this district. I have the time and energy to do so,” he said.\n\nDavis, a retired police officer, said he will work to strengthen the economy by attracting businesses that will provide jobs. One way to do that, he said, is to lower the current high cost of energy in Maine.\n\nZiemer said the state should restore municipal revenue sharing so that it is again fully funded, but with frugal hand.\n\n“Municipalities must be very careful of their spending, as state government needs to be careful with state spending,” he said.\n\n“This area has been represented poorly by the Republican Party for many a year,” Ziemer said. “Issues such as education, providing health care for all, creating more sustainable employment, expanding Internet access and speed, helping expand agriculture, and expanding the four-season tourism have been neglected by our present representatives. I would strive to bring the voice of our area to the state Senate.”\n\nAs for the question of Medicaid expansion to provide coverage to more low-income residents, Davis said the cost would be too high for the state to carry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Medicaid was expanded several years ago and the state has had huge budget problems ever since,” he said. “Maine simply cannot afford to do this.”\n\nZiemer said he favors Medicaid expansion “with the long term goal of a single payer health care system.”\n\nDavis said he agrees with Republican Gov. Paul LePage on his position denying state reimbursement to local communities for general assistance payments made to undocumented immigrants.\n\n“I am married to a lady that came to the U.S. with her mother at the age of 2,” he said. “She became a citizen of the U.S. the legal way. Our tax money should go to our citizens and those here legally.”\n\nZiemer, though, called LePage’s position ludicrous grandstanding.\n\nZiemer said the state should provide more funding for communities both through an extension of the state sales tax and by requiring full funding of municipal revenue sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Both are needed to help fund education,” he said.\n\nDoug Harlow — 612-2367\n\ndharlow@centralmaine.com\n\nTwitter: @Doug_Harlow"
