        "text": "Paul Davis is a member of a small, highly-talented and yet highly unfortunate group of Arsenal players.\n\nThe cultured midfielder rose through the ranks at Highbury and played 447 times during a 17-year spell - but he never got capped for England.\n\nWas he the best Arsenal player never to wear the Three Lions? Only George Armstrong, John Lukic and Peter Simpson could put up any real argument.\n\nDavis turned professional in 1979 and seemed feted to have a successful Arsenal career from the off. His debut came on April 7, 1980 when Terry Neillâ€™s much-changed side won 2-1 at White Hart Lane.\n\nHe was a regular over the next couple of seasons, becoming a firm crowd favourite in the process. His main weapons were his left foot, his vision and his fierce loyalty to the club.\n\nDavis played throughout the successful Littlewoods Cup run in 1987 but picked up an injury at the start of the 1988/89 campaign and sat out the dramatic denouement at Anfield.\n\nHe missed only one game in the side that won the title in 1990/91 but was more of a peripheral figure in the seasons that followed. However Davis did play in the two cup finals in 1993 and was a driving force behind the Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 1994.\n\nHe was released in June 1995 and played five games at Brentford before hanging up his boots for good.\n\nDavis coached in the Arsenal academy for a time and occasionally co-commentates for Arsenal Player's Matchday Show.\n\nHe remains one of the most popular players to represent the Club in the past 30 years.\n\nWHAT THE FANS SAID"
