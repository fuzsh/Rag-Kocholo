        "text": "Three dozen Republicans offered their support Monday for Democratic congressional candidate Paul Davis, reprising the bipartisan support he received during his failed gubernatorial campaign four years ago.\n\nDavis — who is locked in a tight race with Republican Steve Watkins for the 2nd District seat Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins has held for the past decade — leans on GOP as he pitches himself as a candidate willing to reach across the aisle and combat Washington, D.C., gridlock. The Watkins campaign wants to brand him as a career politician in contrast to the first-time candidate.\n\nFormer Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger joined mayors, school board members, ex-legislators and former Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer in the endorsement of Davis. The field of 36 was limited to the 2nd District.\n\n\"It is hard to recognize Congress these days,\" Praeger said. \"The corruption, the gridlock — it seems to have morphed our nation’s capital into a graveyard for fundamental American values. We remember values of leadership, civility and patriotism that Congress is supposed to embody, but we cannot see them anymore in our elected leaders. We believe Paul Davis is someone who can help change that.\"\n\nThe list of Republicans who endorse Davis overlaps with the 27 who announced last week they would support state Sen. Laura Kelly, a Democrat from Topeka, in the governor's race against Republican Kris Kobach, Libertarian Jeff Caldwell and independents Greg Orman and Rick Kloos.\n\nDuring the 2014 governor's race, 100 Republicans from across the state endorsed Davis in his attempt to unseat Gov. Sam Brownback. The Lawrence lawyer, who spent 12 years in the Legislature, lost by 32,000 votes.\n\n\"We need new leadership across the board, and a renewed commitment to putting country over party on both sides,\" Davis said. \"That’s what our campaign is all about.\"\n\nBryan Piligra, the spokesman for Watkins, said voters want lower taxes and border security. Although Davis has made it clear he won't support Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for a leadership position, Piligra said voters who oppose Pelosi are flocking to Watkins \"in droves.\"\n\n\"Steve’s vision for the 2nd District is a stark contrast to Paul Davis’ 20-year record as a career politician,\" Piligra said. \"Voters know career politician Davis won’t suddenly stop raising our taxes once he’s in Congress. And Nancy Pelosi knows it too, which is why her (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) is propping him up to the tune of one million dollars.\"\n\nWatkins also benefits from out-of-state cash, including a recent misleading attack by the Congressional Leadership Fund.\n\nForecasts continue to show a close race between Davis and Watkins, with a slight shift in favor of the Democrat. A Siena College poll conducted Sept. 13-15 showed Davis leading 45-44 percent. The analytics-based news site FiveThirtyEight now gives Davis a 5 in 9 chance of winning the race.\n\n\"The only way to break through the partisan noise in Washington is to build relationships, to think independently, and to treat your colleagues with empathy and respect,\" said state Rep. Tom Sloan, R-Lawrence. \"It can be challenging, but Paul Davis is the person who can do it.\""
