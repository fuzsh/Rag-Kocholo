        "text": "Riverside City Councilman Paul Davis to Provide Leadership on Regional Board\n\nRIVERSIDE, Calif. – Paul Davis, a Riverside City Council member for nearly eight years, has been named President of the Riverside County Division of the League of California Cities.\n\nDavis, who was elected to the Riverside City Council in 2009 and re-elected in 2013, was named to the League of California Cities leadership post on Monday (11/14) during a Riverside County Division meeting in Cathedral City.\n\nDavis had previously served as Second Vice-President of the local division, which brings together elected officials from 28 cities around Riverside County to work on issues of mutual concern. The Riverside County Division is part of the statewide League of California Cities, which advocates for cities around California.\n\n“I’m excited to bring my experience and background to the leadership of this organization that does so much for cities around our county,” Davis said. “Riverside County is a large and diverse place, and the League’s local division plays a strong role in educating and unifying elected representatives from Corona to Blythe.”\n\nThe Riverside County Division is guided by an executive committee under the leadership of a division president. Elected city officials and professional city staff attend division meetings throughout the year to share what they are doing and advocate for their constituents’ interests in Sacramento.\n\nDavis’ previous service with the League includes stints as an Executive Board Member with the Riverside County Division, where he served on the League of California Cities Legislative Committee on Housing, Community, Economic Development, Taxation and Revenue.\n\n“The Riverside County Division is fortunate to have someone of Mr. Davis’ caliber at the helm,” Riverside Mayor Pro Tem Andy Melendrez said. “It’s also great for Riverside to have one of our own in a position to make a positive difference in regional decisions.”"
