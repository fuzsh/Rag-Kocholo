        "text": "Politics is like a pendulum. It can swing as far to one side as possible, but eventually, it makes its way back to center. Over the past three election cycles, Kansas politics has swung increasingly to the right. Just when we thought it could go no further after 2012, conservative Republican legislative victories in 2014 coupled with Gov. Sam Brownback’s re-election showed that the pendulum actually could go further right.\n\nSo perhaps there is still room for conservatives to add more victories in the 2016 cycle. But more than likely, the pendulum should start moving back to center. To do that, center-right Republicans have to figure out their mission and develop their own alternative to the state party machinery.\n\nA number of individual candidates have decided to run in the GOP primaries for 2016 versus conservative Republicans who have won office during the rightward swing Kansas has experienced since 2010. Dinah Sykes has already announced she is running against Greg Smith for Johnson County’s 21st District Senate seat, and she’s running a very aggressive campaign.\n\nPopular former Garden City mayor and current state Rep. John Doll is running against Larry Powell, who himself upended a moderate Republican in former Majority Leader Steve Morris during the 2012 primaries. More center-right candidates are likely thinking that their time to run is now.\n\nWhile most of the action appears to be in the Senate, others think centrists have a better chance of winning a governing coalition in the Kansas House. While focus has been on those candidates, an important prerequisite for center-right Republicans to compete electorally is support. The real test of moderate Republican strength will come in their ability to coalesce around a single organized leadership structure and message.\n\nOne significant advantage Gov. Brownback’s allies have had during the past three elections is a revived state GOP apparatus. From voter files to interest group connections, and from campaign plans to staffing, the Kansas Republican Party has been a support network for the legion of candidates that swept the Legislature. Moderate Republicans and Democrats, by contrast, were either completely disorganized (the moderate GOP members) or playing catch-up (Democrats) with the new GOP machine in Topeka.\n\nRegardless of structure, if more candidates such as Sykes and Doll emerge, we will at least see more competitive campaigns next year. But to win on a statewide basis, those center-right candidates will need a source of fundraising, voter data and volunteers. Those vital sources tend to be provided by political party organizations. Moderates don’t have a state committee of their own right now to shore up their candidates’ efforts.\n\nCenter-right Republicans seem to be stuck in neutral. No single group has emerged to become the organizational structure around which center-right candidates coalesce nor provided a unifying message for centrists. Republicans who oppose the state’s current rightward trajectory also seem to lack a vision of what they want to do beyond getting rid of Sam Brownback and his allies.\n\nModerate groups’ online posts look eerily similar to Paul Davis’ message during the 2014 campaign, essentially saying everything Brownback does is wrong and little else. To emerge as the voice of moderate Kansas, centrists need to develop a message defining what they are beyond not being Brownback-style conservatives.\n\nWhat, essentially, does it mean to be a centrist in the state of Kansas in 2015? Besides disagreeing with Brownback, we have little idea. Conservatives, by comparison, can unite behind a single brand and a popular message of tax reduction, giving them a significant advantage.\n\nWithout a strong message and stronger support, the pendulum will stay to the right in Kansas for some time to come.\n\n— Chapman Rackaway is a professor of political science at Fort Hays State University."
