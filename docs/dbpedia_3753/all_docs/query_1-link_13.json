        "text": "Recently-retired Cincinnati State faculty member Dr. Paul Davis has been elected as National Vice President of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).\n\nDr. Irene Mulvey, a math professor at Fairfield University (Connecticut) was elected president of the 105-year-old faculty-led organization.\n\nPaul has been an active member of the AAUP since the Cincinnati State Chapter formed in 1989. He was a member of the first faculty bargaining team at Cincinnati State, and served as Chapter president, treasurer, and as a long-time member of the Chapter’s Executive Committee.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 Paul served as a board member of the state-wide Ohio Conference of AAUP.\n\nIn the National organization, Paul served for over a decade on the AAUP Collective Bargaining Congress Executive Committee.\n\nPaul said, “It’s a great honor to help lead an organization that does such great things for faculty throughout the U.S.”\n\n“My election is also a tribute to the hard work of the faculty of Cincinnati State,” Paul added.\n\nCincinnati State AAUP Chapter President Pam Ecker said, “Paul has been a tireless leader at local, state, and national levels. He provided strong and effective guidance for the National AAUP Collective Bargaining Congress during challenging times for higher education faculty.”\n\n“National AAUP is going to be in good hands with Paul as part of the leadership team,” Pam said.\n\nPaul joined the Cincinnati State faculty in 1987 and retired in 2019.\n\nNational AAUP rules permit retired faculty to serve as officers, provided they are members of the Association. Paul holds Retired Member status in Cincinnati State AAUP.\n\nThe AAUP election was conducted via mail-in balloting.\n\nOther National AAUP officers elected included Secretary/Treasurer Christopher Sinclair of the University of Oregon, and At-Large members Nivedita Majumdar of John Jay College at the City University of New York (CUNY) and Glinda Rawls of Western Michigan University."
