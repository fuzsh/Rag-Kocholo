        "text": "To the Editor;\n\nThink dirty politics happens only at the national level? Think again it’s alive and well right here in rural Maine. I refer to the letter by Andy Torbett published this week on the Piscataquis Observer website. Of course, it’s hard to tell if Torbett wrote the letter or if Sen. Paul Davis wrote it. Since Davis hired Torbett to write letters the last time I ran against him and even reported it on his ethics reports as a campaign expense. This letter is just the latest example of the half-truths and outright falsehoods we have endured for years from the Davis camp.\n\nPlease let me explain, from the beginning.\n\nLast summer I attended an event with Gov. LePage and when the Governor spoke he told the audience that Doug Thomas “ needed to go back to the Legislature.” I later asked Gov. LePage if I decided to run would he endorse me. He said yes.\n\nA couple of months later I called the Governor and told him I was going to run. He sent an endorsement letter. At that time Steve Foster had signed up to run with Davis as his treasurer. A few days after I enrolled as a candidate Davis decided he did want to run after all and got in the race, and Foster pulled out.\n\nAt that time, I hadn’t made public LePage’s endorsement. I thought it was now a different race and called the Governor. I offered for him to rescind the endorsement. He said no, he had given his word and the endorsement would stand.\n\nThe endorsement from LePage is real. Torbett and Davis may not like it, but they both know it. The last time I ran against Davis they questioned my honesty, my integrity and went so far as to imply I was a skunk in a radio ad. The dirty tricks these men have pulled on anyone who opposes them is unbelievable.\n\nI have copies of ethics reports, radio ads and letters to document these charges for anyone who wishes to see them. We have a great video of a conversation between Gov. LePage and me that we will be releasing later this week. That video will further back up what I’m saying. I welcome you to look and judge for yourself.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to explain what happens when you contest powerful politicians here in rural Maine.\n\nDoug Thomas"
