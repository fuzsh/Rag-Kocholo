        "text": "Paul Davis Do Right\n\nThursday, July 05, 2018\n\nIt’s sad that some people aren’t recognized for their true talents until after they’re gone. That may be true of a singer/songwriter from the 1970s and 1980s named Paul Davis. Davis was a preacher’s kid who was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi on April 21, 1948. On his 60th birthday he had a heart attack and died the next day, back in Meridian.\n\nHe had 15 songs that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the first was a cover of the Jarmel’s hit “A Little Bit Of Soap” that reached #52 in 1970. He placed 8 songs in the Top 40, the first being “Ride ‘em Cowboy,” which peaked at #23 in 1975. Davis had 2 Top 10 songs, “’65 Love Affair,” which peaked at #6 in 1982, and “I Go Crazy,” that reached #7 in 1978. That song was on the Hot 100 for 40 weeks, a record at the time.\n\nPaul’s background as a preacher’s kid was most evident in the lyrics of the song “Do Right,” which hit #23 on the Hot 100 in 1980 and spent 14 weeks on the chart. That song, from the 1980 album “Paul Davis,” was one of a couple of songs that year, including Bob Dylan’s “Gotta Serve Somebody,” that got airplay on both mainstream and Christian radio.\n\nHere’s a fan generated video of Paul Davis’ “Do Right.”\n\n4Him included a cover version of “Do Right” on their debut 1990 album, “4Him.”\n\nIn 1996 Take 6 included “Do Right” on their album “Brothers.”\n\nMore Recent Posts"
