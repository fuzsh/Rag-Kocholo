        "text": "Restoration and remodeling services contractor Paul Davis has launched PD Construction, the company’s new commercial property construction services division.\n\nBrady Chuckel, Paul Davis president, has named Paul Scott as the president of the new division. Scott is a licensed general contractor and began his career in his youth with his family’s construction business in Milwaukee. He worked with the local Paul Davis office in 2005.\n\nThroughout the years, Chuckel and Scott worked together while collaborating on local construction projects. They established a business agreement at Paul Davis Restoration in May.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, Scott has expertise in commercial construction, marketing and business development, senior project management and business ownership as president and chief operating officer of Sawdust Construction in Grafton. He holds a degree in Urban Studies and Urban Planning from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, with additional education in pre-architecture and business from Carroll University in Waukesha. Scott is born and raised in the Milwaukee area, graduated from Brookfield Central High School, and resides in Grafton with his family. He has been active in various area youth hockey and football programs, and professional organizations.\n\nScott will be responsible for overseeing commercial project staff and operations at PD Construction in Waukesha and Appleton, and in Lake County, Illinois.\n\nThe new division is currently hiring skilled tradesmen, project managers, supervisors, administrators and more. As a full-service general contractor, PD Construction will focus on office tenant improvements, retail buildouts, hospitality design and builds, multifamily developments, senior living remodels and expansions, K-12 education school projects, ground-up construction and industrial capital improvements, along with public and municipal projects.\n\nPaul Davis Restoration’s residential remodeling department will continue with the locally owned and operated firm specializing in construction, sustainable materials, customer service and employee engagement.\n\n“We are very pleased to welcome Paul as a key executive at Paul Davis Restoration and PD Construction,” Chuckel said in a news release. “Paul has vast expertise and knowledge as a general contractor and excellent management skills in the trades. He will ensure that our business customers receive exceptional service.”\n\nOwnership of Paul Davis of Southeast and Fox Valley was established in 2013 by tenured Paul Davis employees Brady Chuckel, Jeff Hertel and Tim Guilette. The company continued to grow with the purchase of Paul Davis of Lake County in 2021 and the construction of a new 30,000-square-foot office, warehouse, contents cleaning and storage facility. The initial franchise organization was formed in 1990 in Milwaukee.\n\nChuckel and his team have corporate offices at W226 N918 Northmound Drive, #100 in Waukesha, and an office in Appleton."
