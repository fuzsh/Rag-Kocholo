        "text": "It is not widely known, even in most political circles, how disastrous were the 2010 and 2014 elections for the Democratic Party on the state and local level. Nationally, of course, everyone remembers the tea-party-fueled energy that led to the Democrats’ loss of the House of Representatives in 2010 and then their further loss of the U.S. Senate in 2014.\n\nBut as the 2014 analysis in Realclearpolitics.com (“Republican Gains Deep and Wide,” Nov. 7, 2014) makes clear, this GOP trend is even deeper at the state level than nationally. In 2010, for instance, the GOP controlled only 15 state legislatures, and now it controls 31 (with another eight states having split control). Nationally, there were 143 more Republican state senators than Democrats in 2010, and by 2014 there was a 257-aggregate Republican lead. For state house races, the GOP has a 267-seat advantage in 2010, which now has jumped to 689.\n\nKansas political trends have followed this same trajectory. The GOP majority in the House went from 76 to 92 after the 2012 election (out of 125 total). Kansas Democrats, with only 33 seats left to defend in 2014, still lost another six in 2014, reducing their total to 27. The Senate now has a 32-8 Republican advantage.\n\nWest of Wichita, Democrats elected to the statehouse are virtually nonexistent. The Democrat “brand,” if you will, just doesn’t sell on the local level. What is a Democrat to do?\n\nWell, in 2014 we saw the Democrats resort to withdrawing their U.S. Senate nominee in Kansas to rally around a supposed moderate Independent candidate (Greg Orman). Further, the Democrat nominee for governor, Paul Davis, trotted out a group called “Republicans for Kansas Values” that endorsed him. The group was later exposed as having very few actual Republicans, but even worse, as Dave Helling in the Kansas City Star wrote (July 24, 2014), the group lacked any independence at all and was rather “just a part of the Davis campaign, much like Farmers for Smith, or Lawyers for Jones.”\n\nA further development might be seen in a local political group, the Mod Squad (at ksmodsquad.org), which sponsored a candidate presentation for the state Senate that I took the time to attend. The event was well-organized and well-attended (by about 50 mostly silver-haired voters, with hardly a millennial to be found).\n\nThe Mod Squad (as in “moderates”), with a tagline of “Moderation for Our Democracy,” presented a classic case of bait-and-switch. What I got last week was the other half of the Mod Squad agenda, which is, according to their website, “to return (Kansas) to our progressive roots.” It was progressive politics in all its glory.\n\nA few early questions on state finances and taxation policy were overwhelmed by the passion expressed about the Koch brothers, Americans for Prosperity, the state Chamber of Commerce, the NRA, school voucher plans, Kris Kobach, voter ID and the (apparently) biggest threat to our democracy, ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\nALEC is a conservative group based out of Virginia with an annual budget of about $7 million. It believes in “limited government, free markets, federalism,” which most Kansans find invigorating rather than scary. It hosts legislative conferences and helps prepare “model legislation” for issues in line with its conservative philosophy. It is subject to the same laws on lobbying or conflict of interest as Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club, but to progressives, ALEC is all evil.\n\nThe Mod Squad is certainly free to attack groups it disagrees with (the PowerPoint presentation on ALEC was the grand finale for the whole event), but to pretend their group represents political “moderation” defies belief.\n\nThe fact that the chairman of the group was the Reno County chairman of the Davis-Docking campaign and that their previous event featured Paul Davis as the keynote speaker and the presence of multiple former liberal Democrat candidates for state Legislature at the event would tip you off. But when the lady behind the literature table volunteered that the genesis of the group was the “2014 Davis-Docking campaign,” well, what is a community columnist supposed to think?\n\nAt least the local tea-party group is out and proud of its small-government conservative philosophy and doesn’t pretend to be anything else.\n\nThe strategic sense of Kansas liberals is lacking in this whole effort. Naming anything after a 1960s television show, with a slang term whose relevance is as dated as the word “groovy,” is beyond poor marketing in 2015.\n\nSo “keep the faith,” my liberal Kansas brothers: There will come a time when the squares finally “dig it.” But I wouldn’t hold my breath if I were you.\n\nPaul Waggoner is a Hutchinson resident and business owner.
