To share with you the pros and cons of various options and help you converge on the best solution for your situation.\n\nTo represent the companies we are contracted with in a transparent manner. To share with you the pros and cons of various options and help you decide and choose the best solution for you.\n\nInsurance products can be complicated, confusing and frustrating. There are some unique words in the insurance vocabulary. We act as your interpreter to “insure” your complete understanding.\n\nOur Process\n\nFirst, we ask enough questions to help you choose the best Medicare insurance solution for you. In some cases, we have forms that we ask you to complete so you will receive the best recommendation. Second, we do research (if needed). Third, you’ll receive suggestions on the most suitable solution for you.\n\nTo more completely serve you we project ourselves into your situation and circumstances. Then, we ask ourselves “what would I do if I were this person?” Sometimes, there is a clear and unique solution. More often, there are several possibilities that require us to further discuss and clarify what’s most important to you. Our goal is to uncover the optimal solution for you.\n\nPaul was recognized as one of the Valley’s “Trusted Advisors” by the San Fernando Valley Business Journal.
