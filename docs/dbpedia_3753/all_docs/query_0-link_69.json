        "text": "The most elite unit in Napoleon’s army was the “Old Guard.”\n\nIts members were the longest serving veterans and those with the fiercest loyalty to the Emperor. Last weekend I went to an event where the Old Guard of the Kansas Republican Party was gathered. Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker was there and I was breathlessly assured by one of her former staffers that if I played my cards right I would be granted an audience with the Queen Mother of “Moderate” Republicanism in the state.\n\nI quietly demurred, having had unpleasant dealings with “Nancy” over the years. In 1978, her opponent in the Republican Senate primary was Wichita businessman Sam Hardage. Hardage, his wife, and two children were badly injured in an airplane crash two days after the primary. (The night of the primary, I had gone with Hardage to Kassebaum’s headquarters to congratulate her. He held her arms aloft for the cameras, like the victor in a prize fight.)\n\nHardage and his family were medivacked back to Wichita from Colorado where the plane crash occurred. While they were in the hospital there I got a call from David Bushong, Kassebaum’s campaign manager, asking me to release Hardage’s list of campaign contributors.\n\nI called Hardage in the hospital to get his permission and was startled by his angry response. Apparently at the exact moment her campaign manager was telephoning me to get the “Glengarry leads,” Kassebaum was holding a press conference on television, claiming she’d just visited her defeated rival in the hospital, along with his family, and that they were all going to be fine but to join with her in her thoughts and prayers for their recovery.\n\nKassebaum had made all this up and Hardage saw this press conference from his hospital bed.\n\nI called Bushong back and told him what she needed to do to get the contributor’s list, i.e. go straight to the hospital and actually do what she’d claimed to have done earlier. Having caught Kassebaum in a lie, I was regarded by her with fear and loathing from then on, even though I loyally supported her as a senator.\n\nIn 1996, I was at a party for the delegates to the Republican National Convention in San Diego, my hostess’s son came up to her and said; “Mom, there’s this older couple here. He said his name is Howard Baker, or maybe it was Barker? The wife’s name is Nancy Katzenbaum, I think that’s right! Anyhow, they seem to think I should know who they are!” I thought to myself: “Sic transit gloria mundi” – “Thus passes the glory of the world.”\n\nNow “Nancy” is refusing to do a television ad for Pat Roberts, her successor.\n\nLarry Winn, III, the clown prince of yet another moderate Republican dynasty, was there too, as was Ed Eilert, former O.P. mayor and eternal Johnson County Board of Commissioners Chair. Derek Schmidt, as attorney general the only surviving Mod-Squad state wide office holder young enough to run in the future, was holding court in another corner. There were dozens of other guests from around Kansas whom I recognized from 40 years in Republican politics.\n\nThese are many of the same people who have decided this year to abandon the political party which was so good to them for so long, providing them an assured source of money and power for their entire adult lives.\n\nTheir names adorn the list of Republicans for Paul Davis (d.b.a. ‘Traditional Republicans for Common Sense’) and “Republicans for Greg Orman” (If they could figure out a way to betray 3rd District Congressman Kevin Yoder and elect his Democrat opponent, as they did so many years with “Republicans for Moore,” they would, but their ingenuity and resources are limited.)\n\nThe list of Republicans for Davis was originally one of 100 former office holders but it has now been expanded to five hundred. The common denominator that describes them all is “former.”\n\nOne name on the list is very “former” indeed. Former Overland Park State representative Phil (“Big Phil”) Kline died in February, five months before the group’s formation was announced.\n\nIn other words, they are people who have lost their positions in state and local government and with it their control of the Republican Party. Specifically, and most pointedly, they are the ones conservatives purged from the state senate after they tried to sabotage Sam Brownback’s agenda.\n\nThe Emperor’s New Clothes of this political season, which no one will talk about, is that the fiscal crisis that is threatening Brownback’s reelection was largely of the moderate Republicans’ own making.\n\nThe same people who are now delighted to swell the chorus that Brownback has endangered the state’s solvency deliberately created this situation to put him, and the state, in a political trap.\n\nThe original 2012 Brownback state income tax proposal was much more modest than the one ultimately passed.\n\nIt was deliberately designed to be revenue neutral, eliminating a number of deductions, credits, and exemptions in order to broaden the tax base and thus permit lower tax rates. The tax rates were to be cut across the board and not just for the wealthy, as his critics contend. However, by the time the co-captain of Team Moderate in the state senate, John Vratil, got through with the bill, all the loopholes were restored.\n\nThe annual revenue loss was thus tripled, jumping from a projected $94 million dollars to over $300 million.\n\nI’m reminded of the line from “Animal House;” ‘This calls for an incredibly stupid and futile gesture on someone’s part and we’re just the ones to do it.’ This should be the political epitaph of Vratil and company, because that “stupid and futile gesture,” a deliberate act of sabotage, resulted in their being wiped out in the August primaries later that year.\n\nThat spring, however, Vratil, his co-captain Steve Morris, and the other moderates thought they were sly dogs indeed. They thought that Governor Brownback wouldn’t dare sign such a budget buster into law. They could then run against him for not fulfilling his promise to cut state income taxes. Unfortunately, Brownback, the “Hell Boy” of their worst political nightmares, called their bluff, signed the bill into law and the tax cuts went into effect. To further add to their nightmares, the income tax cuts, when coupled with the repeal of the personal income tax on owners of pass-through entities like limited liability companies, looked like they might work, at least initially.\n\nIn 2012, all job growth in the Kansas City metropolitan area was on the Kansas side.\n\nEight thousand new jobs were added on the Kansas side, five hundred lost on the Missouri side, for a net gain that year in the KC Metro of 7,500 jobs.\n\nBrownback was right that it was “an adrenalin shot” to the economy. But like the proverbial shot of adrenalin, it just as quickly wore off. I thought at the time that Brownback took an incredible risk by stepping on this fiscal I.E.D. If the national economy did not recover fast enough, growth alone would not be able to make up for the lost tax revenues. That is exactly what happened, but the resulting crisis is more the moderates’ fault by forcing him into this Hobson’s choice. (If you don’t think Republican moderates and Democrats are capable of this kind of cynicism, consider how they castigated Brownback last year for not repealing a temporary sales tax increase, which their version of income tax cuts had made impossible by ratcheting up the deficit.)\n\nThe other issue the moderates have used to undermine Brownback was his proposal to change the state’s judicial selection process. Now a legitimate argument could be made that his call for giving a governor power to select judges would violate the separation of powers doctrine. This allocates the functions of government between three branches; executive, legislative, and judicial, none of which is supposed to encroach on the powers of the others.\n\nThis,however, was not the argument used by the moderates.\n\nThis was too subtle for them and thus less amenable to demagoguery. No, they-the legal establishment, as well as the political establishment – which in Kansas are largely one and the same – screamed that this would lead to a “politicized judiciary.” This is rich coming from a group that vets all judicial appointments through the party bosses. (For years this meant former State Senate President Dick Bond for moderate Republicans, Johnson County Democratic Chair Larry Gates for the Democrats. Conservative Republicans need not apply.) For several years all the new Johnson County District Court judges had worked in Dennis Moore’s law office or had been activists in the Kansas Democratic Party.\n\nI’ve written before of Judge Terry Bullock’s reign of error in Topeka, especially in the school finance area. Most recently, the husband of a sitting Kansas Supreme Court justice held a political fundraiser for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paul Davis at their home. (This was while the Court was considering the Democratic Party’s efforts to let their senate nominee withdraw from the ballot so “Independent” Greg Orman would have a better chance.)\n\nIn law, there is a saying that you cannot come into court seeking equity with “unclean hands.” The moderate and/or Democratic schtick about not changing the current judicial selection process lest we “politicize it” is a sick joke and an insult to the intelligence of the Kansas electorate. They have no moral or ethical standing to oppose Brownback’s approach, which at least has the advantage of candor. He wants to appoint conservative judges and he’s being thwarted by a corrupt legal establishment hiding behind the fig leaf of non-partisanship.\n\nThe thing you have to remember about the Moderate Machine is that they have the ethical standards of a pack of hyenas.\n\nThey only attack GOP conservatives when they are vulnerable, e.g. Brownback this year. (Where were they when he was running in 1998, 2004, and 2010?) They also only have these crises of conscience when they lose primaries. As long as they are firmly in control of the party machinery, they don’t care how conservative or ideological the party gets. Why did none of these people walk when Reagan was the standard bearer, if they’re so fearful of the G.O.P.’s “move to the right?”\n\nOh, yeah, Reagan in the White House could help them in Topeka!\n\nActually, Wint Winter, Jr. the former Lawrence state senator, who is the spokesman for “Traditional Republicans” – the anti-Brownback group – is a past master at leaving the Republican Party and then quietly rejoining it when it’s to his advantage. In 1980, he appeared on the podium in Lawrence with liberal independent candidate John Anderson, who was running against Ronald Reagan. Several years later he accepted appointment to the Kansas State Senate as a Republican. He also supported his law partner’s selection as a federal judge by Reagan’s running mate, George H.W. Bush, when Bush was president.\n\nModerate Republicans have abandoned the party innumerable times (e.g. Republicans for Jill Docking, Republicans for Kathleen Sebelius, Republicans for Paul Morrison, Republicans for Dan Glickman, Republicans for Dennis Moore, etc.) only to come slithering back when it is to their personal advantage.\n\nFor one hundred and fifty years the Republican Establishment controlled state and local government without any concern about the party’s positions on the issues, its overarching philosophy, or its candidate’s beliefs. Now that they are out of power, the clear aim of many moderates is to pull the temple down around the party’s ears, like Samson in the Bible. This is true even though it means defeating one of their own, like Pat Roberts.\n\nTwo hundred years after the real battle of Waterloo, we are now at the GOP Old Guard’s own political Waterloo, their last chance to wrest control for themselves.\n\nWhatever Brownback’s and Roberts’s shortcomings, which the moderates seldom if ever objected to before in their 30 year and 50 year long careers, the voters of this state should not turn back the reins of power to the corrupt few who profited so long from running the Kansas Republican Party, which is what will happen if Brownback and Roberts are defeated.\n\nAt the actual Waterloo, Napoleon held back committing the Old Guard to battle until the last possible hour. He then ordered them to make a suicidal charge at the British lines but it was to no avail. The Old Guard had failed and with it Napoleon’s desperate bid to regain power. Let’s hope this last charge of the Kansas Moderate Old Guard, driven more by spite and resentment rather than any adherence to principle, is equally in vain."
