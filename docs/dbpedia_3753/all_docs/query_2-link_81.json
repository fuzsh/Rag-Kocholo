        "text": "I’m Dr. Paul Davis, a dedicated advocate for education and running for the State Board of Education District 2 election. I've been a professor for 48 years, currently teaching American government at Truckee Meadows Community College. I also taught for 18 years at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the graduate department on international terrorism, and I'm a three-time International Fulbright award-winner in India, Egypt and Israel.\n\nThe reason for running is my great passion for all types of education.\n\nWe need to elevate the literacy rate of our students. Nevada is 45th out of 50 states in literacy in a recent 2023 study. We can and must do better and look for innovative ways to engage and support our students in achieving their academic and career goals. We cannot have our students continuously falling behind compared to other states.\n\nSome programs I would like to consider would be surveys from the top 20 states in education and determine why they are so successful and determine whether some of those programs could be implemented in our state on a trial basis. It seems not many students in high school even know that the State Board of Education exists, so why not have high school student body presidents on a rotating basis come to our State Board’s monthly meeting and present and inform the Board of what proposals they would suggest to help increase literacy in their schools?\n\nI would also like to have Board meetings conducted at high schools on a rotating basis so many teachers could attend meetings and give us a firsthand view of what can be done to increase our educational literacy. I am sure that many of their proposals would be pretty illuminating.\n\nMany Nevada students today are engaging in dual college credits that allow public schools to take college credit courses while still in high school, which is a wonderful program. The fact that I am a longstanding TMCC community college professor and a longstanding UNLV professor involved in this program which allows me a unique perspective to assist our current state board members in discussing these programs.\n\nThe bottom line is that we must have accomplished and literate students for them to prosper and elevate their education for their success; and also for the economic growth of our state of Nevada to succeed in this competitive landscape. We must excel in education now and in the future.\n\nI gratefully seek your vote as a candidate for the State Board of Education – District 2.\n\nPaul Davis is a candidate for State Board of Education District 2."
