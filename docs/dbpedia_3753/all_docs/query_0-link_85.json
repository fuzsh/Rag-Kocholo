It has also been the most expensive congressional investigation in history. Chairman Burton alleged at the outset of the investigation that ``this thing could end up being bigger than Watergate ever was'' and that he would prove the existence of a ``massive'' Chinese conspiracy to violate our campaign finance laws. But as described in Part II, Chairman Burton never substantiated these and many other well-publicized allegations. Unfortunately, the pattern of ``accuse first, investigate later'' became a hallmark of the investigation. Part III of these views responds to the major findings in the majority report. The Committee spent over $7 million on the campaign finance investigation, issued 1,285 subpoenas and information requests, took 161 depositions, and received 1.5 million pages of documents, but found virtually no new information. The majority's investigation ignored Republican campaign finance abuses, targeting alleged Democratic violations in over 99% of the subpoenas and document requests issued by Chairman Burton. In fact, campaign finance abuses are bipartisan. As documented in Part IV, some of the most serious allegations of campaign finance abuses involve Republicans, such as the substantial and credible evidence that Majority Whip Tom DeLay participated in an illegal conduit contribution scheme. The ultimate irony of the investigation may be that at the same time that the Committee spent millions of dollars investigating alleged Democratic campaign finance abuses, the majority of Committee Republicans supported the efforts of the Republican leadership to defeat campaign finance reform legislation and to hamstring the federal agency that is charged with enforcing campaign finance laws. Part V describes these efforts. I. The Investigation Was Characterized by Partisanship, Mishaps, Abuses of Power, and Waste The Government Reform and Oversight Committee's campaign finance investigation was the most partisan, inept, abusive, and wasteful congressional investigation since the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. According to Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, ``the Burton investigation is going to be remembered as a case study in how not to do a congressional investigation and as a prime example of investigation as farce.'' 2 According to the New York Times, the Committee's efforts are a ``House investigation travesty'' and a ``parody of a reputable investigation.'' 3 The Washington Post called the investigation ``its own cartoon, a joke and a deserved embarrassment.'' 4 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ House Probe of Campaign Fund-Raising Uncovers Little, Los Angeles Times (May 2, 1998). This article and other news stories related to the campaign finance investigation are attached to this report as Exhibit 5. \\3\\ A House Investigation Travesty, New York Times (Apr. 12, 1997). \\4\\ Mr. Burton Should Step Aside, Washington Post (Mar. 20, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This section of the minority report describes the systemic problems that characterized the investigation since its beginning. It reviews the partisan motives that fueled the investigation, the majority's mishaps and mistakes, the persistent abuses of power that plagued the investigation, and the Committee's wasteful use of tax dollars. A. The Investigation Was Partisan 1. Chairman Burton Promised to Conduct a Fair Investigation Even before Chairman Burton officially began his campaign finance investigation, serious questions were raised by others in the Republican party as to whether the probe would be partisan and unfair.5 Aware of these concerns, Chairman Burton pledged to conduct a fair and bipartisan investigation. Chairman Burton told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, ``As chairman I have to be as non-partisan as possible. I have to be as fair as humanly possible.'' 6 He was later quoted in the New York Daily News as saying, ``I look at myself as in a quasi-judicial position, and I think it's important that I appear as fair as possible.'' 7 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ See, e.g., The Wrong Man for a Sensitive Job, New York Times (Nov. 20, 1996). \\6\\ Burton Promises to Put Partisanship Aside in Role as Oversight Chairman, Roll Call (Nov. 14, 1996). \\7\\ Even GOP Wary of Burton, New York Daily News (June 8, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In an attempt to appear fair, Chairman Burton promised to look into allegations of both Republican and Democratic abuses. At the April 10, 1997, Committee meeting, Chairman Burton stated that ``substantial evidence of improprieties will be pursued wherever it leads. . . . [T]he Committee's current protocol does not . . . limit the Committee from taking investigative leads whenever they go wherever they go within the Committee's jurisdiction.'' 8 Similarly, as the first hearings approached, Chairman Burton said, ``Well, I'm a partisan Republican, but I will tell you, we're going to be very fair and judicial in our approach to handling this whole scandal. And where Republicans have made mistakes and broken the law, we're going to try to get at that as well.'' 9 In his opening statement at the first hearing, Chairman Burton added, ``the committee also is examining matters relating to the Republican National Committee and will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead us, in either party.'' 10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Chairman Burton, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Business Meeting (Apr. 10, 1997). \\9\\ NBC's Meet the Press (Sept. 14, 1997). \\10\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on Campaign Finance Improprieties and Possible Violations of Law, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (Oct. 8, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A number of other Republican Committee members also assured the public that the investigation would look into all allegations of campaign finance abuses, including possible abuses by members of Congress. Rep. Christopher Shays noted, ``our Chairman said that we have the right to look at wrongdoing wherever we find it. . . . It is so clear that even an idiot would understand we have jurisdiction over the executive, legislative, and judicial branch. . . . This Committee has 360 degrees [of] jurisdiction.'' 11 Rep. Connie Morella added, ``the wording in the protocol that we have before us is the kind of scope that allows us . . . to go beyond the executive branch and beyond government agencies. So if it is congressional, so be it, it is congressional.'' 12 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Rep. Shays, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Business Meeting (Apr. 10, 1997). \\12\\ Rep. Morella, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Business Meeting (Apr. 10, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Chairman Burton Later Admitted That He Is ``After'' the President Despite the public pronouncements of Chairman Burton and other Republican Committee members that the investigation would be fair and nonpartisan, the Chairman eventually admitted that his goal was to remove the President and damage the Democratic party. In an April 1998 interview discussing President Clinton with the Indianapolis Star newspaper, Chairman Burton said, ``If I could prove 10 percent of what I believe happened, he'd be gone. This guy's a scumbag. That's why I'm after him.'' 13 After the interview, the paper reported that Chairman Burton ``is a man on a mission: to link the president of the United States to an indictable offense.'' 14 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Burton's Pursuit of President, Indianapolis Star (Apr. 16, 1998). \\14\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton reportedly expressed similar views at a 1997 luncheon hosted by GOPAC, the Republican political action committee formerly headed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich. According to a report in Esquire magazine: Brashly acknowledging his own partisan motives during this closed meeting of political allies, Burton tells the GOPAC crowd that the current fundraising scandal will turn out to be the Democrats' Watergate, resulting in a net gain of ``twenty to twenty-four seats'' for the GOP in next year's congressional elections. ``It's over!'' he hollers.15 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ All the President's Menaces, Esquire (August 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Over Ninety-Nine Percent of Subpoenas and Other Information Requests Targeted Democrats The number of subpoenas and information requests issued to investigate allegations of Democratic fundraising abuses and the number of subpoenas and information requests issued to investigate allegations of Republican fundraising abuses are not a matter of subjective dispute. These statistics show that Chairman Burton used his unilateral subpoena power to target Democrats almost exclusively. Out of the 1,285 information requests, depositions, or interviews issued or taken by Chairman Burton through September 30, 1998, 1,272--over 99%-- targeted allegations of Democratic fundraising abuses. This statistic includes 674 out of 684 subpoenas for documents, 159 out of 161 depositions, all 18 formal interviews, 294 out of 295 document requests and interrogatories, and all 118 outstanding deposition requests and all 9 outstanding interview requests. Objective sources recognized the unfairness of such a focus. Congressional Quarterly (CQ) observed, ``Unlike [Senator] Thompson, who sought a degree of evenhandedness, the more partisan House is looking almost exclusively at Democratic abuses, avoiding inquiries into questionable practices employed by Republicans to raise record-shattering amounts of money in 1996.'' 16 According to CQ, ``[e]ven some Republicans concede that the probe's credibility is on the line because of its one-party focus.'' 17 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ House GOP Casts Wide Net in Renewed Scandal Hunt, Congressional Quarterly (Jan. 17, 1998). \\17\\ Burton Panel Faces Tough Fight Over Scope, Procedures, Congressional Quarterly (Apr. 5, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the statistics from the Committee's investigation might suggest that wrongdoing has been committed by only the Democratic party, statistics from the nonpartisan Federal ElectionCommission paint the opposite picture. At the March 31, 1998, Committee hearing, both FEC Vice Chairman Scott E. Thomas and General Counsel Lawrence Noble testified that FEC investigations of campaign finance violations are almost equally divided between Republicans and Democrats: Mr. Waxman. Based on your experience at the Federal Election Commission, are Democrats responsible for 99 percent of the campaign finance abuses? Mr. Noble. Not based on my experience. I think it's spread pretty evenly. Mr. Waxman. It's what? Mr. Noble. It's spread pretty evenly, I think. Mr. Waxman. Spread pretty evenly. Can you estimate what percentage of the violations you investigate are Democratic, and what percentage are Republican? Mr. Noble. I don't have that. Our office does not keep figures in that regard. Mr. Thomas. Mr. Chairman, I might be able to help you there. I have been sensitive to this kind of criticism since a recent Wall Street Journal article came out a while back, wherein it suggested that someone was under the impression 9 out of 10 of our cases were against Republicans. And I had my assistant go back and look at what the status was at the beginning of 1995 and again at the beginning of 1998. Of the active cases that we had going back in the beginning of 1995, as I strike the percentages of the cases involving Republicans versus Democrats, 53 percent were involving Democrats; the remaining percentage, out of 100 percent, would have involved Republicans, roughly the same percentage in the beginning of 1998.18 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on Federal Election Commission Enforcement Actions: Foreign Campaign Contributions and Other FECA Violations, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 108-109 (Mar. 31, 1998). It is wrong to use taxpayer funds to engage in partisan political activities. Yet the one-sided focus of the investigation shows that this is exactly what transpired. The Committee's extensive powers and resources were used virtually exclusively to target Democrats for partisan advantage. As the statistics and a review of the record make clear, substantial evidence of Republican abuses was simply ignored. 4. Republican Campaign Finance Abuses Have Been Routinely Ignored Although Chairman Burton promised that ``substantial evidence of improprieties will be pursued wherever it leads,'' the Chairman routinely ignored substantial evidence of Republican campaign finance improprieties. In fact, Chairman Burton ignored Republican abuses even while investigating parallel allegations against Democrats. Examples of these Republican campaign finance abuses are summarized below and are discussed in more detail in part IV. a. Republican Favors for the Tobacco Industry Chairman Burton held four days of hearings in January 1998 investigating the alleged influence campaign contributions to the Democratic Party had on an Interior Department decision to deny an Indian casino application in Hudson, Wisconsin.19 Foreign campaign contributions were not at issue in this inquiry. Specifically, Chairman Burton investigated whether a former Democratic National Committee treasurer used his influence to advance the decision, and whether then-DNC chairman Don Fowler called the Interior Department on behalf of DNC contributors who opposed the casino. Yet despite numerous requests from the minority, Chairman Burton refused to investigate similar allegations involving Republicans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on the Department of the Interior's Denial of the Wisconsin Chippewa's Casino Application, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., v. 1 (Jan. 21, 22, 28, 29, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example, it was widely reported that the Republican leadership included a $50 billion tax credit for the tobacco industry in the 1997 balanced budget legislation after the Republican National Committee received $8.8 million in contributions from the industry. The Washington Post reported that during the budget negotiations, House Speaker Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ``insisted on a provision that would give tobacco companies a $50 billion credit against the sum they had pledged to settle anti-tobacco litigation.'' 20 According to the Post, Republican leaders ``were among Congress's top recipients of tobacco industry funds,'' and the tax credit was ``pushed'' by former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour, who became a tobacco industry lobbyist.21 Nonetheless, Chairman Burton denied written requests made by the minority on June 10, 1997, August 29, 1997, and January 13, 1998,22 as well as a request at the January 21, 1998, Committee hearing,23 to investigate evidence of possible Republican favors in return for tobacco industry contributions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ How a $50 Billion ``Orphan'' Was Adopted, Washington Post (Aug. 17, 1997). \\21\\ Id. \\22\\ Letters from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (June 10, 1997; Aug. 29, 1997; and Jan. 13, 1998). A complete set of correspondence between Rep. Waxman and Chairman Burton (comprising 143 letters from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton and 44 letters from Chairman Burton to Rep. Waxman), and other correspondence related to the investigation, is attached to this report as Exhibit 1. \\23\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on the Department of the Interior's Denial of the Wisconsin Chippewa's Casino Application, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (Jan. 21, 22, 28, 29, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At the January 21, 1998, hearing, Chairman Burton used a chart to explain why theCommittee was investigating the Hudson casino matter. Chairman Burton's chart read as follows: Hudson Facts 1. Law requires consultation with tribes 2. Lobbyists were hired to stop progress 3. Tribal meetings with big contributors: $400,000 (opponents) vs. $6,000 (proponents) 4. $350,000 of contributions to Democrats 5. Duffy and Collier leave Interior to work for Shakopees 6. Collier carried $50,000 check to DNC on behalf of Shakopees 24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Id. at 105. At the same hearing, Rep. Waxman used a similar chart to explain why the Republican ties to the tobacco industry should --------------------------------------------------------------------------- be investigated. Rep. Waxman's chart read as follows: Tobacco Facts 1. Tobacco industry hires former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour as their lobbyist. 2. Tobacco industry gives $8.8 million to Republican party since 1995; the three biggest contributors to the Republican party were all tobacco companies. 3. Speaker Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Lott insert a secret provision into the budget bill that gives the tobacco industry a $50 billion tax break. 4. With no discussion on the merits, the largest special interest tax break in history is passed.25 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ Id. at 167. As Rep. Waxman noted in his opening statement at the January 21 hearing, ``The $50 billion giveaway to the tobacco industry is indistinguishable from today's hearing. In fact, the only difference in the matter is the industry's contributions and the benefit they received dwarf today's subject.'' 26 Of course, a second distinction is that the Hudson casino matter involved contributions to Democrats while the tobacco industry tax break involved contributions to Republicans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ Id. at 13-14. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This was not the only questionable activity involving the Republican leadership and the tobacco industry that the Committee failed to investigate. On July 20, 1998, the minority staff released a report entitled, ``Air Tobacco: Campaign Travel on Tobacco Industry Jets,'' 27 which analyzed the tobacco industry's practice of providing its corporate aircraft to congressional leaders and political parties for campaign activities. The report found that (1) the tobacco industry provides more subsidized campaign travel to congressional leaders and political parties than any other corporate special interest and (2) the beneficiary of subsidized campaign travel from the tobacco industry is the Republican congressional leadership and Republican party organizations. In total, the report found that the Republican leadership and Republican organizations reported 84 separate disbursements totaling as much as $244,000 to the tobacco industry for campaign travel from January 1, 1997, through May 31, 1998. The tobacco industry was reimbursed only for the cost of first class travel--far below the actual cost of flying on corporate jets--resulting in a subsidy to the recipients 15 to 45 times greater than the amount of the disbursements. Reports by Democratic campaign organizations, meanwhile, indicated no disbursements to the tobacco industry for travel. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Minority Staff Report, Air Tobacco: Campaign Travel on Tobacco Industry Jets (July 20, 1998). This staff report and other campaign finance reports issued by the minority are attached to this report as Exhibit 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As reported in the Washington Post, ``The nation's leading tobacco companies made their corporate jets available to Republican lawmakers and GOP committees for dozens of flights in the past year. . . . Much of the travel occurred as the tobacco companies were trying at first to get Congress to approve legislation to give them some protection from mounting lawsuits, and later as the companies successfully lobbied Republican senators to kill that legislation after the lawsuit protection was removed.'' 28 Rep. John Linder, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, responded that he sees ``nothing wrong'' with the travel. It is ``another big perk we get,'' he said, ``I don't apologize for it.'' 29 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ Tobacco's Influence Takes Flight in GOP, Washington Post (July 20, 1998). \\29\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Republican Conduit Contributions Chairman Burton held a hearing to investigate allegations that the DNC received illegal conduit contributions made by Charlie Trie through Manlin Foung, Joseph Landon, and David Wang.\\30\\ He also held separate hearings on alleged conduit contributions to Democrats involving German businessman Thomas Kramer \\31\\ and a Venezuelan banking family.\\32\\ Yet Chairman Burton refused to investigate evidence that Republicans received similar conduit contributions.\\33\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on Conduit Payments to the Democratic National Committee, 105th Cong., 1st Sess.

Waxman to Chairman Burton (Apr. 29, 1997 and May 8, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example, on August 6, 1998, the minority members of the Committee (with the exception of Rep. Turner who recused himself from the issue) requested that Chairman Burton schedule hearings to investigate an allegation that the third-ranking Republican in the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, orchestrated conduit contributions to the campaign of Brian Babin, a Republican congressional candidate in Texas in 1996.\\34\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ Letter from Reps. Waxman, Lantos, et al. to Chairman Burton (Aug. 6, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to an affidavit from Republican contributor Peter F. Cloeren, Jr., Rep. DeLay advised Mr. Cloeren on ways to funnel illegal campaign contributions to the Babin campaign.\\35\\ Although Mr. Cloeren already contributed the maximum amount allowed by law, Mr. Cloeren stated that Rep. DeLay advised him that ``additional vehicles'' could be used to send money to Mr. Babin, including Triad Management Services and the campaigns of other Republican candidates. Mr. Cloeren also admitted that he contributed $37,000 to Mr. Babin through employees, who contributed $1,000 each with the understanding that Mr. Cloeren would reimburse them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\35\\ Affidavit of Peter F. Cloeren (Aug. 6, 1998). This affidavit is attached to this report as Exhibit 6. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These allegations clearly warrant further investigation. Not only do they involve the House Majority Whip, a high- ranking elected official, but they offer an unusual potential for illuminating hearings because the source of the conduit contributions appears to be willing to talk about the contributions voluntarily. Nevertheless, Chairman Burton has not even responded to the minority's request for an investigation. The Cloeren contributions were not the only conduit contributions to Republican candidates. During the October 9, 1997, Committee hearing, Rep. Waxman noted, ``Conduit payments are, of course, illegal; unfortunately, they've also become much too common. . . . The Federal Election Commission is currently investigating 27 conduit payments involving 214 individuals.'' \\36\\ Yet despite minority requests, Chairman Burton refused to investigate any conduit contributions involving Republicans, including: Simon Fireman, the former vice chairman of the Dole campaign's finance committee, who pled guilty to making more than $100,000 in illegal conduit contributions; \\37\\ Nevada-based Deluca Liquor & Wine, Ltd. and its vice president, Ray Norvell, who pleaded guilty to making $10,000 in illegal conduit contributions to the Dole campaign; \\38\\ and Pennsylvania-based Empire Sanitary Landfill, which pleaded guilty to funneling $129,000 in corporate funds to campaigns through its employees, including $80,000 to the Dole campaign.\\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on Conduit Payments to the Democratic National Committee, 105th Cong., 1st Sess.

Republican Fundraising on Federal Property Chairman Burton extensively investigated allegations that President Clinton and Vice President Gore used the White House and other federal property, such as Air Force I, to solicit campaign contributions.\\40\\ Yet at the same time he was investigating fundraising by Democrats on federal property, Chairman Burton refused requests from the minority to investigate evidence that Republicans have used federal property for fundraising. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ See, e.g., Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to the Executive Office of the President (Mar. 4, 1997) (The subpoena included 45 separate requests for ``all records relating to'' over 200 different entities, persons, and executive branch functions, including all official delegation trips abroad, fundraising events and activities, and guest lists for various official and party activities). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example, although White House videotapes clearly show that events were held for major Republican contributors in the Reagan White House,\\41\\ Chairman Burton denied minority requests to investigate these events.\\42\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on White House Compliance With Committee Subpoenas, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 163 (Nov. 6, 7, 1997). \\42\\ See e.g., Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (June 10, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Additionally, Republicans in Congress--led by Speaker Gingrich--have used federal property for fundraising purposes. Invitations to the 1995 Republican House-Senate dinner put a price tag on access to the Republican leadership in federal buildings: $15,000 contributors were invited to a ``Senate Majority Leader's Breakfast'' hosted by Senator Bob Dole in the ``Senate Caucus Room,'' and $45,000 contributors were invited to a luncheon hosted by Speaker Gingrich in the ``Great Hall of the Library of Congress.'' \\43\\ Nevertheless, despite the similarities between the Republican practices in Congress and the Democratic practices in the White House, Chairman Burton refused to respond to minority requests to investigate the congressional practices.\\44\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ Waxman Cites Republicans for ``Selling Access,'' Washington Post (Mar. 11, 1997).

Waxman to Chairman Burton (June 10, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- d. Illegal Foreign Contributions to Republicans One major focus of Chairman Burton's investigation was to determine whether there was a concerted effort by the White House or the DNC to solicit illegal foreign campaign contributions. Yet Chairman Burton was reluctant to investigate significant evidence that Speaker Gingrich and other Republican leaders may have solicited illegal foreign contributions. One of the primary figures investigated by Chairman Burton was Ted Sioeng, who was described by the Chairman as ``an Indonesian-born businessman who travels on a Belize passport, suspected by committee members of working along with his family, on behalf of the Chinese Government interests in the United States.'' \\45\\ According to Chairman Burton, Mr. Sioeng ``has a major stake'' in Red Pagoda cigarettes, which `` is owned by the Chinese Government, and it is a convenient way to funnel money into campaigns in the United States by Ted Sioeng.'' \\46\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\45\\ Congressional Record, H4545 (June 11, 1998). \\46\\ Congressional Record, H3058 (May 12, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the course of the Committee's investigation, evidence emerged that linked Mr. Sioeng to Speaker Gingrich. At his deposition, for example, California State Treasurer Matt Fong, a Republican, testified that he arranged for Mr. Sioeng to meet privately with Speaker Gingrich in the Speaker's office.\\47\\ According to press accounts, days after this meeting Mr. Sioeng contributed $50,000 through his daughter's company, Panda Industries, to the National Policy Forum, a subsidiary of the RNC,\\48\\ and ``sat in a place of honor next to Gingrich . . . [at a] reception for Gingrich at a Beverly Hills hotel.'' \\49\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ Deposition of Matthew K. Fong, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, 66-68 (Mar. 2, 1998).

Waxman repeatedly wrote Chairman Burton to request further investigation of the ties between Mr. Sioeng and Speaker Gingrich.\\50\\ On June 11, 1998, for example, Rep. Waxman wrote Chairman Burton to request that Chairman Burton fulfill the commitment he made at the April 30, 1998, Committee meeting when he pledged that ``our entire investigation involving Ted Sioeng and the foreign money he gave the campaigns is exploring both Democrat and Republican contributions.'' \\51\\ Chairman Burton, however, never responded to these requests. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\50\\ See, e.g., Letters from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (Mar. 20, 1998 and June 11, 1998). \\51\\ Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (June 11, 1998) (quoting Apr. 30, 1998, Committee meeting). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton also refused to investigate properly evidence that former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour used the National Policy Forum to solicit foreign contributions from Hong Kong businessman Ambrous Young. According to news reports and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee investigation, the RNC received millions of dollars in last-minute campaign funds in 1994 after Mr. Barbour secured $2.2 million in loan guarantees from Mr. Young.\\52\\ Although Chairman Burton at first agreed to minority requests to investigate the NPF allegations (and even sent subpoenas to the NPF, Ambrous Young, and others involved in the transaction),\\53\\ Chairman Burton dropped the investigation as soon as it became clear that the continued investigation of this issue would require Chairman Burton to issue a subpoena to Mr. Barbour. In fact, Chairman Burton never even responded to Rep. Waxman's June 17, 1997, letter requesting that Chairman Burton issue a subpoena to Mr. Barbour.\\54\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ The G.O.P.'s Own China Connection, Time (May 5, 1997). \\53\\ Subpoenas from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to: Benton L.

Waxman to Chairman Burton (June 17, 1997) (quoting Letter from Richard Richards to Haley Barbour (Sept. 17, 1996)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There also were a number of allegations involving Chairman Burton's relationships with foreign governments and entities that were not investigated by the Committee. These were described in news articles in the Washington Post, New York Times, and many other papers.\\55\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\55\\ See, e.g., Pakistan Lobbyist's Memo Alleges Shakedown by House Probe Leader, Washington Post (Mar. 19, 1997); Representative Is Accused of Pressuring a Lobbyist, New York Times (Mar. 19, 1997); FBI Probes Funds Charge Against Burton, Washington Post (Mar. 22, 1997); House Chairman Linked to Lobbyist for Mobutu, New York Times (May 15, 1997); Burton, Others, Accepted Illegal Funds, The Hill (Apr. 16, 1997); Education Dept. Official Says Burton Pressured Him On Behalf of Contributor Who Runs Caribbean School, Roll Call (May 12, 1997); Burton Echoed Turkish Line After Interest Group Donations, The Hill (May 28, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- e. The Activities of Triad Management Services Even when Chairman Burton publicly promised in Committee meetings that the Committee would investigate allegations of Republican abuses, he later refused to fulfill these promises. One noteworthy example is the activities of Triad Management Services. According to news reports and evidence uncovered during the Senate investigation, Triad is a for-profit political consulting group founded by former Oliver North fundraiser Carolyn Malenick to serve as a ``rapid-fire'' attack mechanism for Republican candidates.\\56\\ The Wall Street Journal reported that Triad advised Republican contributors on ways to circumvent federal contribution limits to individual candidates by laundering funds through other candidates and PACs who would then make a contribution to the contributor's candidate of choice.\\57\\ According to Triad's attorney, Mark Braden, Triad spent over $3 million on ads against Democratic candidates in about 40 races across the country. The ads were paid for by two non-profit groups, Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, funded by Triad.\\58\\ Triad was especially active in Kansas, where it spent over $1 million to assist Senator Sam Brownback and Reps. Vince Snowbarger, Todd Tiahrt, and Jim Ryun. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\56\\ For Their Targets, Mystery Groups' Ads Hit Like Attacks From Nowhere, Washington Post (Mar. 9, 1997). \\57\\ Adviser Helps Political Donors Spread Their Wealth, Wall Street Journal (Apr. 10, 1997). \\58\\ Bank Records Provide Insights into Triad Funding; Firm Put $1 Million into Kansas Races, Kansas City Star (Oct. 31, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The minority repeatedly urged Chairman Burton to investigate these allegations. At the November 7, 1997, Committee hearing, Rep. Carolyn Maloney asked Chairman Burton, ``I would like to know when you are going to issue subpoenas to the groups and individuals involved in the Triad Management scheme to violate or evade the campaign finance laws?'' Chairman Burton responded, ``We are looking at it. And we very well may do that.'' \\59\\ At the following hearing, Rep. Thomas Barrett asked Chairman Burton, ``What about the Triad Management? Are we looking at that, Mr. Chairman?'' Chairman Burton replied, ``I am going to send a subpoena to Triad. Does that satisfy you?'' \\60\\ One month later at another Committee hearing, Rep. Tom Lantos asked FBI Director Louis Freeh to look into Triad's activities. Following this request, Chairman Burton stated, ``There will be, as I said before, an investigation into the Triad matter.'' \\61\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on White House Compliance with Committee Subpoenas, 105th Cong., 1st sess., 204 (Nov. 6, 7, 1997). \\60\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on Johnny Chung: His Unusual Access to the White House, His Political Donations and Related Matters, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 89 (Nov. 13, 14, 1997). \\61\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearings on the Current Implementation of the Independent Counsel Act, 105th Cong., 1st. Sess., v. 2, 47-49 (Dec. 9, 10, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite this pledge, Chairman Burton never investigated Triad's activities. Chairman Burton did not issue any subpoenas to Triad, Citizens for Reform, or Citizens for the Republic Education Fund; and no depositions were taken of Ms. Malenick, Mr. Braden, or any Triad employee. Ironically, at the same time he was refusing to investigate Triad for alleged federal elections law abuses, Chairman Burton was issuing 14 subpoenas to investigate allegations that the Kansas Democratic party evaded Kansas state elections law.\\62\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ Subpoenas from the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to: Richard Alldritt, Tom Beall, Steve Boyda, Micheline Z. Burger, Dorothy Davis, Henry Helgerson, Jerry Karr, Dennis Langley, Marge Petty, Doug Walker, and Constance Wray (Feb. 17, 1998). Tom Beall and Dennis Langley (Mar. 17, 1998); and the Kansas Democratic Party (Mar. 19, 1998). Several of these individuals first learned that they were subject to this investigation through press reports rather than from the Committee. See e.g., House Inquiry Turns to Kansas, Kansas City Star (Nov. 18, 1997); Fund-Raising Probe Heads for Kansas, Wichita Eagle (Nov. 19, 1997); Deposition of Douglas Walker, 44-45 (Feb. 23, 1998); and Deposition of Senator Marge Petty, 39-40 (Feb. 24, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. The Majority Doctored Evidence and Suppressed Testimony to Make Democrats Appear Culpable The partisanship that plagued the Committee's investigation went beyond targeting Democrats and ignoring Republican abuses. Chairman Burton also engaged in the practice of providing the public with selective evidence that implicated Democrats in wrongdoing while withholding exculpatory evidence. The most egregious example of this practice involved the selective release of edited transcripts of Webster Hubbell's prison phone recordings. a. The Webster Hubbell Tapes On April 30, 1998, Chairman Burton released to the media edited transcripts of 54 tapes of Mr. Hubbell's prison telephone conversations subpoenaed from the Bureau of Prisons.\\63\\ On May 3, Rep. Waxman wrote Chairman Burton to protest the release of the transcripts and to complain that Chairman Burton's ``distortion in both words and meaning is inexcusable.'' \\64\\ The following day, after reviewing the transcripts and the tapes, the minority staff issued a report detailing the ``numerous alterations and omissions in the Master Log released by Mr. Burton.'' \\65\\ This prompted Rep. Waxman to write to Chairman Burton, ``It now appears that it is you or your staff who have intentionally altered the transcripts of tapes. . . . [A]s far as I am aware, [this action] is without precedent in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives.'' \\66\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\63\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Federal Prison Camp, Cumberland, Maryland (May 8, 1997). \\64\\ Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (May 8, 1998). \\65\\ Memorandum Re: Analysis of Hubbell Master Tape Log, Government Reform and Oversight Committee Minority Staff (May 4, 1998). \\66\\ Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (May 4, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Following Chairman Burton's release of the transcripts, it was widely reported that the transcripts omitted crucial portions of the conversations that contained exculpatory information.\\67\\ The Washington Post found, for example, that ``the excerpts left out a statement by Hubbell that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has `no idea' of billing irregularities at the Little Rock law firm where they both worked. Also deleted was an assertion by Hubbell that he was not being paid hush money to keep him from cooperating with independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's Whitewater investigation.'' \\68\\ Side-by-side comparisons in the Washington Post and other newspapers of Chairman Burton's transcripts with what was actually said on the tapes revealed large discrepancies.\\69\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\67\\ See, e.g., Bridling G.O.P. Leader Says Tapes Speak for Themselves, New York Times (May 5, 1998); Burton Defends Hubbell Transcript Actions, Washington Post (May 5, 1998); Portions of Hubbell Prison Tapes Released, Los Angeles Times (May 5, 1998). See also letters from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (May 3, 1998 and May 4, 1998): letters from Chairman Burton to Rep. Waxman (May 4, 1998); Memorandum Re: Analysis of Hubbell Master Tape Log, Government Reform and Oversight Committee Minority Staff (May 4, 1998). \\68\\ Democrats Hit Burton Over Tapes of Hubbell, Washington Post (May 4, 1998). \\69\\ See, e.g., Burton Defends Hubbell Transcript Actions, Washington Post (May 5, 1998); Excerpts from Prison Conversations With Hubbell, New York Times (May 5, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton's response to this criticism was to release the tapes in their entirety, without regard for Mr. Hubbell's legitimate privacy interests. As described by the Los Angeles Times, ``The tapes released Monday--or, more accurately, tossed through the air by a Burton aide to a horde of reporters in a House committee room--cover several months' worth of conversations `Inmate Hubbell,' as prison officials called him, had with his wife, sister, attorneys and daughters in 1996.'' \\70\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\70\\ Portions of Hubbell Prison Tapes Released, Los Angeles Times (May 5, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the following days, even Republican members criticized Chairman Burton's actions. Ata closed Republican conference meeting, Speaker Gingrich told Chairman Burton, ``I'm embarrassed for you, I'm embarrassed for myself, and I'm embarrassed for the conference at the circus that went on at your committee.'' \\71\\ And Committee Republican Christopher Shays said that the release ``calls into question our investigation. It reduces credibility when these kinds of things happen.'' \\72\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\71\\ Burton Apologizes to GOP, Washington Post (May 7, 1998). \\72\\ Newt Defends Rep. In Tape Release, Associated Press (May 6, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Similarly, scores of newspaper editorials chastised Chairman Burton's conduct with headlines such as ``Tale of the Tapes--Rep. Dan Burton Brings a Serious Inquiry Into Disrepute'';\\73\\ ``Congressman Plays Dirty With Tapes'';\\74\\ and ``Abuse of Privacy; Burton Should Be Censured for Leaking Excerpts from Hubbell's Jail Conversations.'' \\75\\ The Washington Post editorialized, ``Dan Burton was every bit as irresponsible and ham-handed as has been charged in releasing, as he did, doctored transcripts of the former associate attorney general's prison phone conversations.'' \\76\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\73\\ Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (May 8, 1998). \\74\\ Allentown Morning Call (May 5, 1998). \\75\\ Harrisburg Patriot (May 5, 1998). \\76\\ Mr. Burton's Transcripts, Washington Post (May 6, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Other Examples of the Selective Use of Evidence The Hubbell tapes were not the only instance in which Chairman Burton refused to present exonerating evidence. Chairman Burton rejected the minority's request to call a number of key witnesses to testify at the Hudson casino hearings in January 1998.\\77\\ For example, Chairman Burton rejected the minority's request to call to testify locally elected officials who were on the record against the proposal, including former Republican representative Steve Gunderson, Republican state representative Sheila Harsdorf, and Republican governor Tommy Thompson.\\78\\ These witnesses would have corroborated the Interior Department's contention that there was strong local opposition to the casino, which, rather than political contributions, was the crucial factor in the Department's decision to deny the casino application.\\79\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\77\\ See, e.g., Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (Jan. 16, 1998). \\78\\ Letters from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (Jan. 12, 1998 and Jan. 16, 1998). \\79\\ The majority also rejected the minority's request to call Deputy Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Hilda Manuel, to testify. Ms. Manuel is the top-ranking career civil servant at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and played a key role in the Department's decision to deny the application. She would have told the Committee about a conversation with Secretary Babbitt in which he said he did not want a role in deciding the outcome of the application--evidence that directly refuted the majority's allegations. Deposition of Hilda Manuel, 98 (Jan. 6, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Similarly, at the April 30, 1998, hearing on Venezuelan money in the 1992 campaign, Chairman Burton called two Assistant District Attorneys from Manhattan to testify about evidence they uncovered of foreign conduit contributions, which they had provided to the Department of Justice. The majority alleged that the Department of Justice failed to properly investigate the matter because it involved a Democratic fundraiser. Chairman Burton, however, did not include representatives of the Department of Justice at the hearing. In response to the minority's concerns that the hearing was one- sided, Chairman Burton promised ``we will have the Justice Department up here. It's now 4 o'clock, and we didn't want to run this thing on into the late night hours, but we will have the Justice Department up here and we will ask them the questions that were raised today.'' \\80\\ Chairman Burton never in fact allowed the Justice Department to respond to the allegations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\80\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on Venezuelan Money and Presidential Election, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 109 (Apr. 30, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This pattern was repeated when Chairman Burton refused to allow Attorney General Janet Reno to testify at the August 4, 1998, hearing on her decision not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign finance violations. The independent counsel statute grants the authority to appoint an independent counsel solely to the Attorney General. Yet Chairman Burton allowed only the testimony of Department of Justice officials who recommended the appointment of an independent counsel. He refused to allow Attorney General Reno the opportunity to present the other side of the issue.\\81\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\81\\ House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Hearing on the Need for an Independent Counsel in the Campaign Finance Investigation, 105th Cong., 2d. Sess., 66-67 (Aug. 4, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. The Investigation Was Plagued by Mishaps From the outset of the investigation in January 1997, the Committee's investigation was characterized by mishaps and mistakes. The Committee issued subpoenas to the wrong witnesses, staked out the home of an innocent individual, released the President's private fax number, and caused an international incident on a trip to Taiwan. As the Atlanta Constitution commented in an editorial, ``These fellows make Inspector Clouseau look like Sherlock Holmes.'' \\82\\ The Committee's problems were summed up in one news article headline which read, ``Burton's fund-raising probe efforts seems jinxed.'' \\83\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\82\\ Clinton's Foes Bungle Again, Atlanta Constitution (May 5, 1998). \\83\\ Burton's Fund-Raising Probe Effort Seems Jinxed, Associated Press (Sept. 17, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Subpoenas Issued to the Wrong Individuals On at least three separate occasions, Chairman Burton issued subpoenas to individuals with no connection to the campaign finance investigation. On April 3, 1997, the majority issued a subpoena for the bank records of Georgetown University history professor Chi Wang instead of Los Angeles DNC contributor Chi Ruan Wang.\\84\\ The 65-year-old professor told the Los Angeles Times, ``This is unbelievable. . . . I have no idea why they have my name.'' \\85\\ The Committee withdrew the subpoena, but rather than apologizing to Mr. Wang, a majority investigator implied to the Los Angeles Times that Professor Wang may have still been under investigation and refused to acknowledge that the majority had made a mistake, stating: ``Whether [Professor Wang] deserves a subpoena or not, we haven't decided, We've put it on hold . . . we're not sure we made [a mistake].'' \\86\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\84\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Chevy Chase Bank F.S.B. and the National Capital Bank of Washington (Apr. 3, 1997). \\85\\ Investigators Mistakenly Issue Subpoena to Wrong DNC Donor, Los Angeles Times (Apr. 15, 1997). \\86\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In September 1997, the Committee issued a subpoena to Brian Kim, a mail carrier from Downey, California.\\87\\ A U.S. marshal tried to serve the subpoena on Mr. Kim at the U.S. Post Office. Unfortunately, the majority had identified the wrong Brian Kim. Mr. Kim said he was ``scared'' and ``embarrassed'' by the incident because his supervisor thought he had done something wrong. Mr. Kim called the majority and told them that they had the wrong person. He was told to write a letter to the majority confirming that fact, which he did. He never received any apology from the majority.\\88\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\87\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Brian Kim (Sept. 2, 1997). \\88\\ Minority counsel phone interview of Brian Kim (Sept. 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On month later, in October 1997, the majority subpoenaed the phone records of LiPing Chen Hudson of Virginia.\\89\\ Mrs. Hudson and her husband became aware of the subpoena only after they received notice from their local phone carrier that the documents had been subpoenaed. The Hudsons have not been involved in any political campaign this decade, raising their concerns that Mrs. Hudson was targeted because of her ethnic background.\\90\\ In response to the error, majority spokesman told the Wall Street Journal, ``To err is human''; he then passed the blame onto the telephone company for not double- checking with the majority before producing the records.\\91\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\89\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Bell Atlantic-Virginia, Inc. re: LiPing Chen Hudson (Sept. 19, 1997). \\90\\ Letter from Rep.

The Committee's ``Stake Out'' of Felix Ma As discussed below, the majority's practice is to conceal its domestic investigative travel from the minority. On a few occasions when minority staff was permitted to travel with the majority staff, however, the minority observed the majority staff use inappropriate and inept investigative techniques. For example, during a nine-day investigative trip to Los Angeles in August 1997, Committee staff conspicuously ``staked out'' the residence of Felix Ma, whom the Committee hoped to interview. As CBS reported on Face the Nation, when Mr. Ma returned home, the investigators ``became a virtual SWAT team, accosting him as he left his car.'' \\92\\ It turned out that the Committee staff was interrogating the wrong Felix Ma.

In this instance, the majority staff rang the doorbell of a condominium unit occupied by a person with the last name Negara without knowing whether he was the ``Mr. Negara'' for whom they were looking. There was no answer. Despite the uncertainty that this was the correct individual, the staff trespassed onto the property by slipping into the building behind another individual. After knocking loudly and persistently on Mr. Negara's door and receiving no answer, the majority counsel knocked on neighboring doors, asked passersby if they knew Mr. Negara, and contacted the building manager and questioned her about Mr. Negara. The manager complained that these men had entered the building without permission from the residents or the management. Id. Also on the trip, the majority staff attempted to contact Cindy Tashima. Ms. Tashima, who is a ``diminutive'' woman and was home alone, was intimidated by the large men in dark suits repeatedly pounding on her door, who she later described as ``look[ing] like the Men in Black,'' Id.; CBS's Face the Nation (Sept. 14, 1997). Ms. Tashima's only connection to the investigation was that in 1990 she worked for less than one year at a company listed in 1991 as the employer of an individual who had made a suspect contribution.

The Committee's Release of the President's Private Fax Number Another mishap involved the accidental release of the President's private fax number. As the Atlanta Journal- Constitution reported, ``The House committee investigating campaign fundraising briefly posted President Clinton's personal fax number on the Internet . . . despite a request that it keep the number private.'' \\94\\ The Committee obtained the fax number during a deposition and failed to redact the number before posting the deposition on its web page.\\95\\ As a result of this mistake, the President was forced to change the fax number. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\94\\ Clinton's Private Fax Number Put on Web in ``Lapse,'' Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Nov. 22, 1997). \\95\\ Deposition of Dick Morris, 90 (Aug. 21, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. The Committee Actions in Taiwan Chairman Burton sent five investigators to Taiwan in March 1998 to interrogate high-level Taiwanese officials and businessmen about campaign contributions.\\96\\ The questioning enraged members of the Taiwanese Parliament who ``claimed that the dignity and judicial sovereignty of the nation has been infringed upon.'' \\97\\ According to a Taiwanese newspaper, the lawmakers ``condemned'' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for allowing the investigators into the country and said ``that Taiwan's international image had been damaged,'' thus setting off an international diplomatic incident.\\98\\ As a result, ``[t]he investigators left with little more than a long list of canceled meetings.'' \\99\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\96\\ Burton's Campaign-Finance Probe Is Drawing Criticism for Mounting Costs and Slow Progress, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 27, 1998). \\97\\ Visit by US Aides Sparks Controversy, Free China Journal (Mar. 20, 1998). \\98\\ MOFA Rebuked Over Handling of Probe, China News (Mar. 19, 1998). \\99\\ Burton's Campaign-Finance Probe Is Drawing Criticism for Mounting Costs and Slow Progress, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 27, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Insensitivity to the Concerns of Asian-Americans Unfortunately, many of the victims of the Committee's improper conduct were Asian-Americans who were subject to highly intrusive subpoenas seeking their personal banking records, credit card records, phone records, and travel records. In total, 423 out of the Committee's 684 documents subpoenas sought information relating to individuals with Asian surnames. The Committee also sought INS records for many Asian- Americans, even though, in many instances, this information was decades old and had no relevance to this investigation.\\100\\ This raises serious questions of whether the investigation unfairly targeted Asian-Americans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ See, e.g., Committee document request to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Aug. 13, 1997) (Committee requested that INS ``provide the Committee with a copy of any I94 records and the entire contents of the alien registration a.k.a. `A' files'' for 47 individuals). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the House and Senate campaign finance investigations, Asian-American activists expressed their concern that their political participation was being unfairly scrutinized. Karen Narasaki of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium said that the investigations imposed ``a chilling impact on Asian-American political involvement.'' \\101\\ Francey Lim Youngberg of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies commented, ``We don't condone any illegal activities, but we don't want the actions of a few individuals to taint a whole community.'' \\102\\ As a result of these concerns, a coalition of Asian-American civil rights groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in September 1997, alleging that public officials, the two political parties, and the media have ``engaged in a pattern of bias based on race and national origin.'' According to the complaint, there is a clear pattern of ``bias and unequal treatment destructive of the rights and interests of Asian-Pacific Americans and legal immigrants.'' \\103\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\101\\ Asian-Americans See Rising Racism, USA Today (July 15, 1997). \\102\\ Asian American Donors Feel Stigmatized: DNC Puts Unwanted Focus on Growing Political Group, Washington Post (Sept. 8, 1997). \\103\\ Asian Pacific American Petition to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (Sept. 11, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At the Committee's September 24, 1997, business meeting, Rep. Tom Lantos spoke about the harmful perceptions created by this investigation: I believe that there is a grave danger that stereotyping and Asian bashing will become and, in many instances, have become part and parcel of this investigation. . . . This investigation, perhaps inadvertently, has clearly contributed to stereotyping and racebaiting. As one who is singularly conscious of this issue, I want to call attention to this issue because Asian-Americans have as much right to participate in the political process as do Americans of any other origin. Deliberately or otherwise, Asian- Americans have been the target of both of these investigations to an unacceptable and overwhelming degree . . . The last thing this country needs at this stage is an attempt to whip up racial tensions and Asian bashing. These hearings clearly have contributed to a climate of xenophobia, which we ought to avoid.\\104\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\104\\ Rep. Lantos, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Business Meeting (Sept. 27, 1997). This insensitivity to the concerns of Asian-Americans regarding the investigation was also evident in the full House. On July 22, 1997, Rep. Jack Kingston went to the House floor and stated that the illegal donations were ``only the tip of the egg roll.'' \\105\\ Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas mocked the DNC in a floor speech in July for accepting contributions from people with foreign-sounding names: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\105\\ Rep. Kingston, Congressional Record, H5500 (July 22, 1997). If you have a friend by the name of Arief and Soraya, and I cannot even pronounce the last name, Wiriadinata, something like that, who donated $450,000 to the DNC and was friends with a guy named Johnny Huang, and later returned it because Wiriadinata could not explain where it came from, then probably there is a high probability that it's money from foreign nationals . . . I could go on with John Lee and Cheong Am, Yogesh Ghandi, Ng Lap Seng, Supreme Master Suma Ching Hai and George Psaltis.\\106\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\106\\ Rep. DeLay, Congressional Record, H5485 (July 14, 1998). After being criticized for his floor statement, however, Rep. DeLay said, ``In no way did I mean to suggest that Asian-Americans should not participate in our democracy,'' House GOP Whip Assailed Over Remarks on Foreign-Sounding Names, Apologizes, Boston Globe (July 18, 1998). Regrettably, this insensitivity reinforced the views of many who saw a racial bias in the Committee's investigation of alleged campaign finance abuses. 6. Republican Acknowledgment of the Committee's Incompetence These mishaps and mistakes have embarrassed even Republican members and staff. They have called the investigation ``a big disaster,'' \\107\\ ``incompetent,'' \\108\\ ``unprofessional,'' \\109\\ and ``[a]n embarrassment, like Keystone Cops.'' \\110\\ According to one former senior Republican investigator, Charles Little, ``[n]inety percent of the staff doesn't have a clue as to how to conduct an investigation.'' \\111\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\107\\ GOP Memo Targets 3 N.E.

In his letter of resignation, Mr. Rowley stated that he had ``been unable to implement the standards of professional conduct I have been accustomed to at the U.S. Attorney's office.'' \\112\\ The Washington Times reported that Mr. Rowley was concerned that David Bossie, Chairman Burton's chief investigator, ``was trying to use the probe to `slime' the Democrats, while Mr. Rowley wanted `to follow where the evidence leads.'

The best investigations have gone to great lengths to involve the minority and protect the rights of minority members. The House Watergate investigation, for example, gave both the chairman and the ranking minority member identical authority regarding the issuance of subpoenas and the release of documents.\\120\\ Similarly, in the Iran-Contra investigation, the majority and minority jointly made all procedural decisions.\\121\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\120\\ H. Res. 803, sec. 2(b), Rpt. 93-774 (Feb. 1, 1974). \\121\\ Letter from Rep. Lee H. Hamilton to Rep. Waxman (June 16, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton's campaign finance investigation abandoned these procedural safeguards and vested unprecedented powers in Chairman Burton, who, in turn, trampled the rights of individuals and the minority members. A commentary in the Los Angeles Times described the conduct of the majority as follows: In the year or so since the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee began its wide-ranging probe into Democratic fund-raising practices . . . [t]hose forced to appear are grilled in private, sometimes for hours at a stretch, with few of the protections from badgering that shield witnesses in the real world. . . . This would be funny if it were not redolent of a mentality that Washington has not seen for some decades. The term `McCarthyism' is used too often and too loosely, but there are times when it is useful, and one of those is now. What made the McCarthy phenomenon so sinister was . . . several grotesque characteristics of the investigations themselves. First, the investigations could be triggered by legal political conduct. Second, they probed broadly, even indiscriminately, on the ground that some people actually turn out to be guilty. Third, anything you said to one investigation could be used against you in another, creating boundless jeopardy for anybody questioned. Fourth,merely being investigated could ruin honest and dishonest alike. All those things are happening now.\\122\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\122\\ Jonathan Rauch, In the Loop of McCarthyite Investigations, Los Angeles Times (Mar. 15, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. The Committee Abused the Subpoena Power The subpoena power is one of the most coercive powers of Congress. The issuance of a subpoena compels an individual to appear before, or submit documents to, a congressional committee against his or her will. For this reason, the issuance of a subpoena in past investigations was regarded as a serious step that was taken only with (1) the concurrence of the ranking minority member or (2) a committee vote. These safeguards provided minimal checks and balances that sought to insure that the subpoena power was not abused for partisan political advantage. Even when Democratic chairmen had the power to issue subpoenas unilaterally, they refrained from exercising this power. In fact, since the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s, no Democratic chairman of a committee ever issued a subpoena unilaterally, without either minority consent or a committee vote. In the Iran-Contra investigation, for example, Democratic Chairman Lee Hamilton had the authority to issue subpoenas after ``consultation'' with the ranking minority member,\\123\\ but he never used this authority unilaterally. Rep. Hamilton described the subpoena procedures he used during the Iran- Contra and other investigations as follows: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\123\\ House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, Committee rule 4, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987). As a matter of practice in the Iran-Contra investigation, the four Congressional leaders of the Select Committee--Senators Inouye and Rudman, Representative Cheney and I--made decisions jointly on all matters of procedural issues, including the issuance of subpoenas and the taking of depositions. I do not recall a single instance in which the majority acted unilaterally. In fact, I do not recall a single instance in which our decisions were not unanimous. With respect to the October Surprise Task Force, I followed a similar approach with Henry Hyde.\\124\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\124\\ Letter from Rep. Hamilton to Rep. Waxman (June 16, 1997). This practice of obtaining either minority concurrence or a committee vote was also followed in the Senate Whitewater investigation \\125\\ and the Senate campaign finance investigation.\\126\\ It was even followed in the Government Reform and Oversight Committee during the 104th Congress under Chairman William Clinger. In a letter to Rep. Cardiss Collins stating how he intended to interpret the Committee rules, Chairman Clinger wrote, ``I shall not authorize such subpoenas without your concurrence or the vote of the committee. I believe that this new rule memorializes the long-standing practice of this committee to seek a consensus on the issuance of a subpoena.'' \\127\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\125\\ S. Res. 20 (May 17, 1995). \\126\\ Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, S. Rpt. No. 167, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., v. 6, 8687 (1998) (hereafter ``Senate Report''). \\127\\ Letter from Chairman Clinger to Rep. Cardiss Collins (Mar. 6, 1996). But see Letter from Rep. Cardiss Collins to Chairman Clinger (Aug. 2, 1996) (Despite this commitment, Chairman Clinger unilaterally issued four subpoenas relating to the Travel Office-FBI file acquisition investigation during the August 1996 recess). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton, however, shunned this longstanding precedent. In the Committee rules adopted on February 12, 1997, and in the investigation's document protocol adopted on April 10, 1997, Chairman Burton sought and obtained the power to issue subpoenas unilaterally, without minority consent or a Committee vote.128 He then proceeded to issue 758 unilateral subpoenas. These subpoenas were for both documents (684 subpoenas) and witnesses (74 subpoenas). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\128\\ Committee rule 18(d) and Document Protocol Sec. A.2(a) (Apr. 10, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Near the end of the investigation, after the minority members refused to support additional immunity requests without procedural reforms, the Committee's document protocol was amended to provide for a vote of a five-member working group, consisting of three Republicans and two Democrats, in the event that the minority objected to the issuance of a subpoena.129 Even this limited safeguard, however, was shown to be a sham procedure when Chairman Burton denied the minority an opportunity to present its objections to each of the majority members before seeking working group approval for a subpoena to Attorney General Reno.130 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\129\\ Committee Document Protocol Sec. A.2(a) (June 23, 1998). \\130\\ Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (Aug. 24, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton's unilateral subpoena power led to many abuses. As discussed above, he issued subpoenas to the wrong witnesses. He also issued many subpoenas that did not meet the requirements of relevancy, admissibility, and specificity that apply in a judicial context. Forexample, Chairman Burton subpoenaed all DNC records relating to its senior staff.\\131\\ This request covered matters relating to the DNC's internal budgeting, campaign strategies, and political activities unrelated to fundraising. The subpoena also demanded all DNC records relating to high-level White House contact with the DNC and all DNC phone records from January 20, 1993, forward without limiting the request to fundraising. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\131\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to the Democratic National Committee (Mar. 4, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton also issued a broad subpoena to the White House for all phone records from Air Force I and Air Force II and all records of visitors to the White House residence since 1993, among other things.\\132\\ The subpoena was issued without regard for its impact on national security or the Clinton family's privacy. For example, the request for all visitors to the White House made no exception for Chelsea Clinton's friends, relatives of the First Family, or visits by doctors or clergy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\132\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to the Executive Office of the President (Mar. 4, 1997). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In another example, Chairman Burton abused the subpoena power by ordering a private citizen to violate the law. Chairman Burton subpoenaed accountant Donald Lam for all tax preparation material related to Ted Sioeng, his family, or their businesses.\\133\\ Mr. Sioeng objected to disclosure of this information. As a result of the client's objection, federal law prevented Mr. Lam from providing the material without a court order.\\134\\ Specifically, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7216 prohibits someone ``engaged in the business of preparing . . . [tax] returns'' from ``disclos[ing] any information furnished to him for, or in connection with, the preparation of any such return.'' Violating the statute subjects the accountant to criminal penalties including a fine and imprisonment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\133\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Donald Lam (Jan. 30, 1998). \\134\\ Letter from Mark MacDougall, et al., to Chairman Burton (Feb. 13, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notwithstanding Mr. Lam's obligations under federal law, Chairman Burton ruled in a February 20, 1998, letter that Mr. Lam must provide the information to the Committee or risk being held in contempt of Congress.\\135\\ Not only did this action unilaterally compel a private citizen to commit a federal crime, it also circumvented 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6103, which provides that tax records can be obtained only by the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, or the Joint Committee on Taxation, absent special authorization from the House. In effect, Mr. Lam was put in the position of having to choose between violating the tax code, which would subject him to a possible fine or imprisonment, or facing congressional contempt.\\136\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\135\\ Letter from Chairman Burton to Steven R. Ross, et al. (Feb. 20, 1998). \\136\\ Letter from Rep. Waxman to Chairman Burton (Feb. 27, 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, Mr. Lam was not the only accountant to be subpoenaed for tax preparation materials. Chairman Burton also subpoenaed Michael C. Schaufele for tax preparation materials related to Webster Hubbell.\\137\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\137\\ See Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Michael Schaufele (Feb. 4. 1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In contrast to Chairman Burton's approach, former House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell followed the proper course in attempting to obtain tax records of junk bond financier Michael Milken during a 1990 investigation of Mr. Milken and his firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert. Once it was determined that a request for these records would violate 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7216, Chairman Dingell applied to the court for an order to obtain the documents.\\138\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\138\\ See Application for Order for Providing Tax Preparer Information, Misc. No. 90-231 (D.D.C. Aug. 14, 1990). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Burton also unilaterally issued subpoenas that appeared to be politically motivated and were unrelated to the campaign finance investigation, including a number of requests related to the matter of the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. For example, Chairman Burton subpoenaed the Investigative Group, Inc. (IGI), the company run by long-time Washington detective Terry Lenzner, for any documents relating to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation or members of Congress.\\139\\ According to George: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\139\\ Subpoena from House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to Investigative Group, Inc. (Mar. 30, 1998). Burton assumed he would be handed a treasure trove of documents that would embarrass the Democrats. But when Lenzner and his lawyers searched their files, they made a startling discovery: The investigator known for digging dirt for Clinton had actually done more snooping for Republicans than Democrats. When Lenzner's lawyers made that fact known to Burton's staff, the request was quickly withdrawn.\\140\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\140\\ George Magazine (Aug. 1998). In addition to subpoenas, Chairman Burton also sent interrogatories related to the Lewinsky matter. For example, on Apr. 1, 1998, Chairman Burton sent interrogatories to Democratic fundraiser Nathan Landow. The interrogatories were issued only after the press reported that Kathleen Willey, who accused President Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance, alleged that Mr. Landow tried to influence her testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Although Chairman Burton said he would not investigate the President's sexual conduct, request 27 of the interrogatories asked Mr. Landow to ``[d]escribe any conversation or contact you have knowledge of regarding making a suggestion to any potential witness before . . . a grand jury or other legal proceeding.'' Chairman Burton also sent interrogatories to the White House for information about its assertions of executive privilege in the Lewinsky matter, the White House Counsel's office debriefings of witnesses appearing before Mr. Starr's grand jury, and information about White House attorney work-product that was shared with the President's personal attorney in the Jones and Lewinsky matters. Chairman Burton also subpoenaed the White House for all records relating to the White House C"
