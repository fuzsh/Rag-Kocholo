I am so excited and blessed to be here at Bluefield State University and working with some amazing people. My goal is to make sure this program reflects a family atmosphere in all that we do. I care deeply about all these players and their success on and off the court. I’m going to push them to achieve their highest goals as well as love them and respect them throughout the process. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of goals, but we can only get there by taking advantage of each practice, each weight room session, each film session etc. Controlling what we can control and getting a little bit better each day,” said Coach Davis.\n\nThe Coach Davis File\n\nFull Name: Paul Kendall Davis\n\nBirthplace: Clio, SC\n\nEducation: B.S., Physical Education, Winston-Salem State University\n\nM.S., Sport Management, Western Carolina University\n\nCertificate in Program Management, Western Carolina University\n\nPaul Davis Coaching Timeline\n\nAssistant Coach | Winston-Salem State University (2)\n\n2016-17 | 2017-18\n\nAssistant Coach | Queens University of Charlotte (1)\n\n2018-19 Assistant Coach | Livingstone College (2)\n\n2018-19 | 2019-20\n\nHead Coach | Bluefield State University (3)\n\n2021-22 | 2022-23 | 2023-24\n\nPaul Davis Head Coaching Record\n\n2020-21 Head Coach | Bluefield State University 5-19\n\n2021-22Head Coach | Bluefield State University 12-14\n\nPaul Davis Championships\n\n2019 – SAC Regular Season | Queens University of Charlotte\n\n2019 – Southeast Regional | Queens University of Charlotte\n\nPaul Davis Post Season Appearances\n\n2019 – Elite Eight | Queens University of Charlotte\n\n2023 – USCAA | Bluefield State University"
