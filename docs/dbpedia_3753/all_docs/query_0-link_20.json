        "text": "JEFF GREENFIELD:\n\nThis is what you'll see just about any autumn in Kansas: fields of corn that await the harvest, the search for food at a farmer's market or at Oklahoma Joe's always crowed barbecue. And this is what you'll hear: the roar of the crowds and the motorcycles at a Kansas State football game.\n\nBut for all that is familiar in this place, in this season, there is one thing happening here that is almost totally unprecedented. Something so surprising, almost shocking, that it has Republicans from Maine to Hawaii asking, \"What's the matter with Kansas?\"\n\nIn what is surely the biggest surprise of the 2014 midterms, both Republican Senator Pat Roberts and Republican Governor Sam Brownback find themselves in serious political peril in this most Republican of states. Two races that were on no one's radar a few months ago – one of which may decide who controls the United States Senate.\n\nIt's enough to make an observer like the Kansas City Star's Dave Helling, who's covered politics for almost 35 years, to feel as if he's not in Kansas anymore – where every statewide official and every member of Congress is Republican.\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD:\n\nFor the 78-year-old Roberts, political vulnerability is an unwelcome stranger. First elected to the house 34 years ago, Roberts is finishing his third term in the Senate, continuing a string of GOP victories that stretches back to 1938.\n\nBut Roberts has been hit by the same crosswinds that have buffeted other veteran Republicans: the sense that he's \"gone Washington.\" In February, the New York Times revealed that Roberts has no home in Kansas, that he rents out a room in a supporter's house on a golf course and has rarely been seen back in the state.\n\nAnd Roberts is fighting another perception: that he's too much part of the system, a symbol of the older order, and out of step with Tea Party conservatives, something that may be reflected by how he describes himself.\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD:\n\nIf the Senate race here has national implications, the Governor's race seems to illustrate an old political adage, that all or at least a lot of politics is local. Governor Brownback's problem stems not from Democrats but overwhelmingly from Kansas Republicans, who are a special breed.\n\nThe 58-year-old Brownback was elected governor four years ago, after two terms in the U.S. Senate. He brought with him a strongly conservative agenda, both on social issues like abortion and with historically large tax cuts, an experiment Brownback said in supply-side economics. For national Republicans, tax-cuts are an unalloyed good. But Kansas Republicans? Well…\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD:\n\nAs in every campaign, the outcome could hinge on the unanticipated. Just in the last week, Paul Davis has had to explain how he was caught up in a police raid at a strip club 16 years ago. And some Republicans have begun to hint that Senate candidate Orman's Wall Street ties may be as big a problem for him as they were for Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nBut what we're already seeing is the unanticipated on steroids: the possibility that America's reddest state might go blue this year."
