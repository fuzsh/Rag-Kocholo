        "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. — The evolution of the Kansas Republican Party mirrors that of the national party, a rightward shift from the moderation of Dwight D. Eisenhower to the mainstream conservatism of Bob Dole to the small-government absolutism of former Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita-based Koch Industries.\n\nNow the party appears to be shifting once more: toward the hard-line nationalism of President Trump. And that has delighted Democrats who see an opening to make significant gains in a conservative-leaning state.\n\nA crucial moment will come in Tuesday’s primary election when Kansas’ secretary of state, Kris Kobach — a Trump ally who has become a national lightning rod for his views on immigration and voting rights — could snatch the nomination for governor from the incumbent, Gov. Jeff Colyer.\n\nIf Republicans select a candidate as polarizing as Mr. Kobach, it could have profound political implications for both local and national Democrats. Not only could they take back a Great Plains state governorship — winning veto power in the next round of redistricting — but they could also pick up a pair of House seats, making Kansas as pivotal to the battle for control of the House as more traditional, and more liberal, battleground states.\n\nThe potential for such pickups, turning Bleeding Kansas several shades bluer, has alarmed Republican officials in Topeka, the state capital, and in Washington.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association has lobbied the White House to stay out of the primary, out of fear that a Trump endorsement would effectively seal Mr. Kobach’s nomination and imperil the party’s chances in the fall. West Wing officials also have little desire for Mr. Trump to intervene here, but after the president’s recent streak of success in Republican nominating contests, nobody felt confident predicting what he may do in this race, and as he heads into a weekend of unmonitored golf at his New Jersey resort.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
