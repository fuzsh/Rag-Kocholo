        "text": "WASHINGTON — In the early 1990s, Tortilla Coast, a popular Capitol Hill watering hole, was staffed by ambitious young men and women flinging Tex-Mex and margaritas at patrons whose jobs in the nearby House and Senate office buildings they not so secretly coveted.\n\nOne of those waiters, a tall, dark-haired Midwesterner named Paul Ryan, stood out to his boss and co-workers. He was the guy who always showed up for work on time, wore neatly pressed khakis and chatted about economic policy as he floated along in a kayak at an after-work party. While the other twentysomethings pounded beers after work, Mr. Ryan was known to stick to just a few.\n\n“I think even then he probably had an eye toward his future,” said Scott Johnson, a waiter back then who was looking for work in the Clinton administration.\n\nMr. Ryan’s sense of purpose extended to the conservative research group where he was also working at the time, winning the sort of praise from Republican elders that would help pave his remarkably propitious path in Washington, where he has spent most of his adult life. From his first summer as a Senate intern, a position he got thanks in part to the libertarian economist who was his college mentor, Mr. Ryan made an impression with his discipline, his command of supply-side economics and his uncanny ability to develop relationships with like-minded conservatives.\n\n“We were the beginnings of the network that he has now developed,” said former Senator Robert W. Kasten of Wisconsin, in whose office Mr. Ryan first worked as a college junior.\n\nWinning the right supporters wherever he went, Mr. Ryan has risen rapidly in Washington, moving easily from lowly staff aide to 28-year-old congressman to the Republicans’ pre-eminent policy expert. His economic ideas, which once placed him outside his party’s mainstream, have shaped the 2012 campaign debate. And on Wednesday night in Tampa, Fla., the policy wonk who through his political skills and disciplined focus defined the Republican agenda will, at age 42, accept its nomination for vice president.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
