Davis, D.M.D., has been elected as the medical professions representative to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Board of Trustees for the 7th Congressional District.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“MUSC has had a profoundly positive impact, not only on my life, but on the lives of so many others in our state and around the country,” Davis said. “I am extremely honored to have the opportunity to give back to the university by serving on its Board of Trustees.”\n\nHe attended Wofford College on a golf scholarship and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1994. He earned his doctorate from the MUSC College of Dental Medicine in 1999, where he also completed an advanced education in general dentistry residency. After practicing in Mount Pleasant for six years, Davis and his family decided to move back to his hometown of Florence, where he has maintained his private practice since 2006.\n\nDavis is a member of the Florence Dental Society and is the past president of the Pee Dee District Dental Association. He has served on the board of governors for the South Carolina Dental Association and is a member of the South Carolina Delegation to the American Dental Association.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
