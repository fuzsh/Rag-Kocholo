        "text": "Paul Davis\n\nABWE President\n\nPaul and his wife, Martha, have served in pastoral ministry since 1989. In their lifetime of ministry, they have led church plants, Christian schools and dynamic ministry teams. Additionally, they have given oversight to children’s, youth and college/career ministries. They enjoy pace-setting leadership as well as serving as educators, conference speakers and ministry trip facilitators.\n\nIn 2017, Paul became the seventh president of ABWE. Today, Paul and Martha are working hard to meet, support, and encourage the ABWE global team, striving to embolden gospel-centered churches to become sending and supporting churches, connecting God-enabled donors to the visionary projects of our fields, and humbly working to build, heal and reignite relationships with ABWE partners past, present and future.\n\nThe Davises have four adult children who are maturing believers in Jesus Christ.\n\nMinne Bouma\n\nVice President of Global Ministries\n\nMinne and his wife, Michele, began their ministry together by teaching and administrating in Christian schools in New Bern, North Carolina and Brantford, Ontario before joining ABWE and serving overseas in Portugal.\n\nIn 2016, they assumed the leadership of ABWE Canada and were blessed to serve the Canadian board and missionaries for five years before they were called to serve at the International Headquarters. As Vice President of Global Ministries, he has the unique privilege of serving the entire ABWE family of ministries, and Michele and Minne delight in spending time with the missionary team around the globe.\n\nThe Boumas have two college-age sons, Drew and Caleb.\n\nDuane Early\n\nVice President of Strategic Partnerships\n\nThe Lord led Duane into full-time ministry while a student at the University of Michigan. He continued his education and theological training at Summit University in Clarks Summit, PA, and Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary. Duane and his wife, Susan, were involved in two pastoral ministries and one church plant during their first 15 years of marriage.\n\nIn the 90s, the Lord led them Duane, Sue, and their two daughters to join ABWE in order to open and lead the first team in the country of Ukraine. The team was able to grow both in quantity and quality while developing the Church Ministries Institute, multiply churches, and launch mission endeavors throughout the Russian-speaking world.\n\nIn 2000, Duane was asked to serve as the Regional Director for Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and in 2009, Duane became Vice President of Global Operations. He began his current role in 2017.\n\nDoug Martin\n\nVice President of Strategic Initiatives Development\n\nDoug and Sharon Martin joined ABWE in 1994. Doug served as the first Country Coordinator for Romania until 2004, when he accepted the role of Regional Coordinator for Eastern Europe and the Martins relocated to Budapest, Hungary.\n\nIn 2010, Doug became the Executive Director for North America, now known as EveryEthne—a ministry focusing on equipping the North American church to cross cultures without crossing borders by reaching their own communities. In 2021, Doug transitioned to his current role.\n\nDoug enjoys golf, playing with his four grandchildren, and watching The Voice.\n\nJoe Masshardt\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nJoe has faithfully served at ABWE since 2011, taking on a variety of roles in accounting and finance over the years. In 2024, he stepped into the role of Vice President of Finance, where he currently leads the finance, technology, and human resources teams. Joe is deeply committed to ABWE’s mission and is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to God’s work globally alongside a great team. He is deeply committed to serving local churches, missionaries, and donors.\n\nJoe and his wife, Stacy, are blessed with three young children."
