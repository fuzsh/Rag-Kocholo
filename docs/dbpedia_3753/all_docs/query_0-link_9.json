        "text": "Lawrence Democrat Paul Davis made his candidacy for Kansas governor official today in a YouTube video (watch it after the jump) called “Restore Kansas.”\n\nThe Pitch reported in August that Davis, the House Minority Leader, had plans to run for governor in 2014, and the candidate had launched a campaign website. In the video, Davis says the only label he’s interested in is “problem solver.”\n\nKansas Democratic Party executive director Jason Perkey issued the following statement: “Paul Davis is a moderate leader with a record of bringing Democrats, Republicans, and Independents together to support our schools, working families, and businesses. This race is about the steep cost of being a Kansan. These costs have sky-rocketed because of Sam Brownback’s bad policies. Paul Davis will fight for our kids, our families and get our state back on track.”\n\nDavis is clearly Kansas Dems’ choice. Can he win over red-state Kansas?"
