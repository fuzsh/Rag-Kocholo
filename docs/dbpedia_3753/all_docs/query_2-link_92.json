        "text": "2024 July 25\n\nRe-introducing Participation Reports to encourage best practices in open metadata\n\nWeâve just released an update to our participation report, which provides a view for our members into how they are each working towards best practices in open metadata. Prompted by some of the signatories and organizers of the Barcelona Declaration, which Crossref supports, and with the help of our friends at CWTS Leiden, we have fast-tracked the work to include an updated set of metadata best practices in participation reports for our members.\n\n2024 July 22\n\nMetadata schema development plans\n\nItâs been a while, hereâs a metadata update and request for feedback In Spring 2023 we sent out a survey to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks? The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work. Thereâs a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we really want to make sure weâre focusing on the projects that will have the most immediate impact for now.\n\n2024 July 02\n\nCrossmark community consultation: What did we learn?\n\nIn the first half of this year weâve been talking to our community about post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is published it isnât the end of the journeyâit is read, reused, and sometimes modified. That’s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide notifications of important changes to research made after publication. Readers can see if the research they are looking at has updates by clicking the Crossmark logo.\n\n2024 July 01\n\nCelebrating five years of Grant IDs: where are we with the Crossref Grant Linking System?\n\nWeâre happy to note that this month, we are marking five years since Crossref launched its Grant Linking System. The Grant Linking System (GLS) started life as a joint community effort to create âgrant identifiersâ and support the needs of funders in the scholarly communications infrastructure. The system includes a funder-designed metadata schema and a unique link for each award which enables connections with millions of research outputs, better reporting on the research and outcomes of funding, and a contribution to open science infrastructure.\n\nBiography\n\nPaul Davis helps members and users navigate all things metadata. He joined in May 2017 and in his spare time he enjoys playing sport as regularly as possible, despite the body not healing as quickly as it once used to. He enjoys spending time with his family and has a passion for all things food.\n\nMy name is Isaac Farley, Crossref Technical Support Manager. Weâve got a collective post here from our technical support team - staff members and contractors - since we all have what I think will be a helpful perspective to the question: âWhatâs that one thing that you wish you could snap your fingers and make clearer and easier for our members?â Within, youâll find us referencing our Community Forum, the open support platform where you can get answers from all of us and other Crossref members and users. We invite you to join us there; how about asking your next question of us there? Or, simply let us know how we did with this post. Weâd love to hear from you!\n\nQuality metadata is foundational to the research nexus and all Crossref services. When inaccuracies creep in, these create problems that get compounded down the line. No wonder that reports of metadata errors from authors, members, and other metadata users are some of the most common messages we receive into the technical support team (we encourage you to continue to report these metadata errors). We make membersâ metadata openly available via our APIs, which means people and machines can incorporate it into their research tools and services - thus, we all want it to be accurate.\n\nHello, Iâm Paul Davis and Iâve been part of the Crossref support team since May 2017. In that time Iâve become more adept as a DOI detective, helping our members work out whodunnit when it comes to submission errors.\n\nIf you have ever received one of our error messages after you have submitted metadata to us, you may know that some are helpful and others are, well, difficult to decode. I’m here to help you to become your own DOI detective."
