Focusing on energy independence, fighting reckless spending in both parties, standing up to communist China’s aggression, protecting farmers and ranchers from over-regulation, and defending Utah’s land from federal overreach—he’s been busy. Before Congress, John led a company that designed and built shooting ranges. This real world experience taught him what it’s like to successfully build something from the ground up. As Provo mayor, he cut the city’s budget by over 8% and earned a 94% approval rating from residents. He understands that running a leaner government is important, and he uses that as an example of how the federal budget should also operate. John’s 6 years of seniority in the U.S. House will follow him to the Senate where seniority really matters. Utah won’t have to start over. John now wants to take his unique experience and proven track record of getting things done for Utahns to the U.S. Senate. He believes that Utah families deserve to be heard and will continue to work hard every day to make Utah an even better place. As our Senator, he’ll keep getting things done for Utah.

During his civilian career, he worked for several years in the Pentagon as the senior legislative advisor to the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

I am running because legislators pass hundreds of bills that they do not read or understand and because they listen to the elites more than they do to us. In fact, legislators all too often socialize the elites’ costs while privatizing the profits rather than addressing the challenges facing average Utahns who are just trying to make ends meet. In addition, our legislature has become more like the U.S. Congress when it comes to increasing state spending and imposing mandates. I will always listen to you and put you first while working to kill terrible bills, improve bad bills and to rescind stupid laws already on the books. I will form citizen advisory groups to help me evaluate bills and make good decisions. I will only serve one term.\n\nBountiful, UT 84010\n\nOffice Name Political Party Candidate Status Bio Website Email Phone Assessor Andy Hansen Republican General Bio Email 801-243-7125\n\nAndy Hansen - Assessor\n\nAndy Hansen has spent the last 10 years working in the Davis County Assessor’s office. During his time in the Assessor’s office, he worked as a Commercial Real Estate Appraiser, Residential Team Lead and as the Chief Deputy Assessor. He is a Certified General Appraiser with over 20 years experience. He has a Bachelor’s in Finance from the University of Utah. Andy lives in Woods Cross with his wife and their four children.

He served in the Marine Corps Reserve Infantry for eight years. After 9/11, his unit was deployed for Operation Noble Eagle, a quick reaction force, and then to the Middle East for the Iraq War. On a local level, he has served many roles in his church, and with the Boy Scouts of America. 1047 West 1300 South\n\nWoods Cross, UT 84087\n\nCommissioner John Crofts Republican General Bio Website Email 801-888-4272\n\nJohn Crofts - Commissioner\n\nI am committed to representing the Voters' interests first. Here are three key points of my platform: LOW TAXES: The significant increase in property values has led to dramatic tax increases, burdening voters. I advocate for prudent fiscal management, wise utilization of public funds, and ensuring each taxpayer dollar is pent judiciously. We can do better, and I commit to saving taxpayer dollars. HIGH-DENSITY-HOUSING: The proliferation of high-density housing is encroaching on our neighborhoods, and give challenges for our communities. Trendy, excessive, high-density housing is bad for the Voter and our families. HOMELESSNESS: Homelessness is a significant threat. Voters don't want to bring homelessness to our doorstep. Mandates from the State Legislature demand Davis County have a homeless shelter. This is a bad mandate, and I will push back. Attracting homelessness leads to urban decay, jeopardizes neighborhoods safety and poses unnecessary risks to our communities and families. I pledge to put the Voter first, and safeguard our neighborhoods and families. I am running for Davis County Commissioner solely through the County Convention--and you, the County Delegates will decide if Voters First proceeds. I ask for your vote on April 13th. 2616 North 1750 East\n\nLayton, UT 84040\n\nCommissioner Michael J Lambert Unaffiliated General Bio Website Email (801)317-8583\n\nMichael J Lambert - Commissioner\n\nHi, my name is Michael. I bring a unique set of experience and perspective to the Office of Commissioner. I’m an unaffiliated candidate and believe in the important value of bipartisanship, particularly in our modern politics. Professionally as a social worker, I’ve worked extensively with youth and families. I’m a northern Utah native and our family has loved finding a home here in Layton. My experience includes an internship in D.C. through the Hinckley Institute of Politics; past city council meeting attendance and coverage; county contract work serving early Head Start children and their families; supporting young adults with anxiety transition to college at Weber State; and have enjoyed volunteering in a local school here, co-chairing our School Community Council and serving as secretary. I’m passionate about issues affecting children; our shared land and surrounding areas, including the vitality of the Great Salt Lake and our air quality; mental health; and civic representation for all Davis County residents. My work experience has taught me how to listen, manage conflict, and create consensus among diverse groups and interests. I will bring these aptitudes to the Office of Commissioner. I look forward to getting to know you and earning your vote!\n\nLayton, UT\n\nRecorder Kelly A Silvester Republican General 801-520-4500\n\nKelly A Silvester - Recorder\n\n2831 West 1475 North\n\nLayton, UT 84041\n\nSurveyor Max B Elliott Republican General Bio Website Email 801-971-9813\n\nMax B Elliott - Surveyor\n\nMax Elliott has been with Davis County since 1959 and as a licensed surveyor since 1964.
