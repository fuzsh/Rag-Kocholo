        "text": "(born 1970). American politician in the Republican Party, Paul Ryan served as a congressman from Wisconsin in the House of Representatives beginning in 1999. After winning prominence for his conservative views, he was chosen to be the Republican nominee for vice president in 2012. Although he failed in that quest, he continued to serve in the House of Representatives and in 2015 was elected speaker of the House.\n\nPaul Davis Ryan was born on January 29, 1970, in Janesville, Wisconsin. He studied economics and political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, graduating in 1992. While attending college, Ryan had become involved in politics, working for Republican Senator Robert Kasten, first as an intern and then as an aide. In 1993 Ryan served as an economic adviser and speechwriter for Empower America, a conservative think tank cofounded by Representative Jack Kemp. From 1995 to 1997 Ryan served as legislative director for Representative Sam Brownback. During the 1996 presidential campaign he also worked as a speechwriter for Kemp, who was Bob Dole’s running mate. (Dole and Kemp eventually lost the election.)\n\nIn 1998 Ryan successfully ran for a seat in the House of Representatives. After taking office the following year, he focused on issues relating to fiscal policy. In 2008 he released the first version of his “Roadmap for America’s Future,” a controversial budget plan that included a major overhaul of taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Although the proposal failed to garner much support among Republicans in Congress, it proved popular with the party’s conservatives, and Ryan’s influence within the party greatly increased.\n\nAfter Republicans regained control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2011. Later that year he unveiled “Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promises,” a revised budget plan that included individual and corporate tax cuts, trillions of dollars in spending cuts, and an overhaul of Medicaid. The plan also included the repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law. In 2011 the plan passed the House but was voted down in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Another Ryan budget, “Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal,” was passed by the House in 2012.\n\nRyan’s positions on social issues—notably his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage—were also popular with conservatives. In August 2012 Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, selected Ryan to be his vice presidential running mate in that year’s general election. In November Romney and Ryan were defeated by the Democratic ticket of Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nRyan continued to be an influential member of the Republican Party. In 2015 he became chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Later that year he emerged as the leading candidate to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House. Boehner, amid growing unrest among conservatives, had abruptly announced his intent to leave office. Faced with deep divisions within the party, Ryan agreed to become speaker only after receiving the promised support from several right-wing groups. He was easily elected, and in October 2015 he assumed office, becoming the youngest person to hold the post in nearly 150 years."
