SK Telecom is South Korea's largest wireless carrier: it leads the local market with 50.5 percent share as of 2008. Since its creation in 1984, the company has evolved from a first generation analog cellular system, to second generation CDMA, then to the world's first third-generation synchronized IMT-2000 cellular system. SK Telecom also became the world's first carrier to commercialize HSDPA in May 2006. SK expanded into the landline market by acquiring second-rated fixed-line operator Hanaro Telecom in February 2008.\n\nExpanding 4.5 million fixed lines to 20 million in just 12 years, kt introduced universal telephone service to every citizen of Korea, leading the development and advancement of communications services. More recently, kt established an advanced broadband network for the first time in Asia, and launched Korea's first communication satellite 'Mugunghwa (Sharon's Rose)', contributing to making Korea one of the most advanced countries in information and communications. Since becoming a government-funded corporation in 1997, kt changed its business portfolio to focus more on wireless and internet services instead of fixed lines. Taking over Hansol M.com and merging with its subsidiary KTF, kt expanded its business scope and included mobile communication as its main service. kt became a privately owned company in 2002 and began concentrating on building broadband network. As a result, the company set several new records including the increase of ADSL subscribers to 6 million in just 3 years and played a leading role in the age of digital networking.\n\nQualcomm is an American fabless semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and services.
