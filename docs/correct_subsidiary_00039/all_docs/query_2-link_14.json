        "text": "Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt <d.schmidt@vanderbilt.edu>\n\nDr. Douglas C. Schmidt is currently the President-appointed and Senate-confirmed Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, where he is responsible for overseeing the evaluation of the operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability, and (when necessary) lethality of United States defense systems to defend the homeland and prevail in conflict.\n\nHe's on leave from Vanderbilt University, where he is the Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Engineering in Computer Science, the Associate Chair of Computer Science, and a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems. He is also on leave from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a Visiting Scientist. From 2018 to 2022 Dr. Schmidt served as the Associate Provost of Research Development and Technologies and the Co-Director of the Data Science Institute, both at Vanderbilt University.\n\nDr. Schmidt is an internationally renowned and widely cited (an h-index of 93, an i10-index of 402, and a citation count of 48,500+) researcher whose work focuses on patterns, optimization techniques, and empirical analyses of object-oriented and component-based frameworks and model-driven engineering tools that facilitate the development of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware frameworks and mobile cloud computing applications on parallel platforms running over wireless/wired networks and embedded system interconnects. His recent research focuses on prompt engineering techniques and prompt patterns that enhance the accuracy and expressiveness of large language models (LLMs) and generative augmented intelligence platforms."
