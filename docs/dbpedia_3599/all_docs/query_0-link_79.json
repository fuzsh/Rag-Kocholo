Jazz musicians, later dubbed âGoodwill Jazz Ambassadors,â became a U.S. propaganda toolâinitially, unbeknownst to the artists, writes Diplomatic Courier's Melissa Metos in her review of the film 'Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat.'",

        "text": "Amidst all the brassy diversion, the CIAâat the request of Eisenhower and under the careless oversight of the UNâorganized Patrice Lumumbaâs capture. On 17 January 1961, he was transferred to Katanga where he was beaten and assassinated by both Belgian and Congolese soldiers. When the news of his murder reached the U.S., supporters of Lumumba were outraged, and Civil Rights activist Maya Angelou organized a protest at the UN. On 16 February 1961, Angelouâalongside Lincoln, Roach, and about 60 othersâcrashed the UNâinspiring yet heartâwrenching footage of women being pushed to the ground as they chant âLumumbaâ and âBigoted sons of bitches,â to the beat of Roachâs drums and the rising force of Lincolnâs voice. In the film, the once nostalgic jazz soundtrack reaches an urgent âcrescendo of defiance;â Lincolnâs lyrical scream reverberating through the theater.Â\n\nThe last 30 minutes of the film show hardâtoâstomach scenes from the Congo: women and children being killed, captured, and tortured. Families seeking shelter from bombings. This climax to the coup dâÃ©tat orchestrated by Colonel Joseph Mobutu of the Congolese National Army (CNA) is further emphasized by two very abrupt interruptions. Towards the beginning of the film, it was a Tesla commercial, and towards the end, an iPhone commercial. Flashing across the screen, the HD graphics cut through what was likely a very teary crowd at that point. It was a piercing contrast to the blackâandâwhite historical footage. Brief but perhaps one of the most significant parts of the film, it is Grimonprezâs way of tying history to the present.Â\n\nAs it was evident from the various quotes, the U.S. and Sovietâs interest in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), wasâand is stillâtied to minerals such as the uranium and radium found in the Shinkolobwe mine, another global actor in this film about diplomacy and decolonization. This mine was home to the uranium responsible for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The inhumanely mined coltan in our iPhone batteries also originates from DRC mines.Â\n\nDirector Grimonprez portrays the power of jazz as threefold: its power to evoke emotion in an audience; its power to peacefully protest; and its power to become a coerced actor and weapon of diplomacy and conflictâamong them the Congo Crisis and assassination of Lumumba."
