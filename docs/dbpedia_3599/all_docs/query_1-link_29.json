        "text": "Martin Fayulu told the BBC the people of the nation deserved to know the truth of the election, which he said had led to a \"coup\".\n\nAnother opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, was declared the winner amid accusations of a power-sharing deal with the outgoing president.\n\nSeveral deaths and injuries have been reported in the wake of the results.\n\nThe election was to choose a successor to Joseph Kabila, who has been in office for 18 years.\n\nThe result, if confirmed, would create the first orderly transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.\n\nThe influential Catholic Church, which posted 40,000 election observers, said the result did not match its findings.\n\nWhat has Mr Fayulu said?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane, Mr Fayulu said he would challenge the declared result in the constitutional court.\n\n\"I will do whatever is possible for me to do to get the truth because the Congolese want change,\" he said.\n\nMr Fayulu admitted such a challenge would have little chance of success as the court was \"composed of Kabila's people\" but he said he did not want to give his opponents any chance to say he had not followed the law.\n\n\"Felix Tshisekedi has been nominated by Mr Kabila to perpetuate the Kabila regime. Because today the boss is Kabila,\" Mr Fayulu said.\n\n\"Mr Kabila cannot stay and make an arrangement with someone who will not have any power... Mr Tshisekedi knows himself that he did not win.\"\n\nMr Fayulu said he feared there would be violence if the electoral commission did not give the true figures \"polling station by polling station\" and that it was the right of all Congolese to demonstrate according to the law.\n\nHas there been any violence?\n\nThousands of supporters of Mr Tshisekedi took to the streets to celebrate but those who backed Mr Fayulu also came out in protest.\n\nViolent scenes were reported in Kikwit, where at least two policemen and two civilians were said to have been killed.\n\nThere were reports of several hundred students protesting against the result and being dispersed by tear gas in the town of Mbandaka.\n\nProtests were also reported in Kisangani but the south, where Mr Tshisekedi has broad support, was mainly celebrating.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all sides \"to refrain from violence\" and widespread unrest has not yet been reported.\n\nWhat was the result of the election?\n\nAccording to the National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election.\n\nThe full results were:\n\nFelix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes\n\nMartin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes\n\nEmmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes\n\nTurnout was reported to be 48%.\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nCandidates must file any appeal to the constitutional court within 48 hours of the announcement of the provisional results.\n\nJudges will then have seven days to deliberate.\n\nConstitutional expert Jacques Ndjoli told the BBC there were three possible outcomes: the court could confirm Mr Tshisekedi's victory, order a recount, or cancel the results altogether and call fresh elections.\n\nThe constitutional court has never overturned results before, and some think most of its judges are close to the ruling party.\n\nIf Mr Tshisekedi were confirmed as the winner, he would be expected to be inaugurated within ten days.\n\nHow has the result been received?\n\nMr Tshisekedi hailed his victory, vowing to be \"the president of all DR Congolese\".\n\nHis spokesman, Louis d'Or Ngalamulume, said there was \"never any deal\" with Mr Kabila.\n\nMr Kabila's ruling party, whose candidate came a distant third, has not yet contested the result, although it did not rule out doing so.\n\nAbroad, the response was a mix of appealing for calm and calling for clarification.\n\nThe African Union leader, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said any dispute should be \"resolved peacefully, by turning to the relevant laws\".\n\nThe US hailed the \"courageous\" Congolese voters and called for a \"clarification of questions which have been raised regarding the electoral count\"."
