        "text": "Here is a list and tribute to many great photographers who came to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo and made it part of their lives and work.\n\nAlice Seeley Harris (1870-1970) (Photojournalism)\n\n“Lady Alice Harris (born Seeley; 24 May 1870 – 24 November 1970) was an English missionary and an early documentary photographer.\n\nHer photography helped to expose the human rights abuses in the Congo Free State under the regime of King Leopold II of the Belgians.\n\nAlice Seeley was born in Malmesbury to Aldred and Caroline Seeley. Her sister, Caroline Alfreda Seeley, was a school teacher.\n\nIn 1894, she met her future husband John Harris. Finally in 1897, after seven years of trying, Alice was accepted to go out to the Congo Free State. Shortly afterwards, Alice and John got married on 6 May 1898 at a registry office in London.\n\nThey had four children: Alfred John, Margaret Theodora, Katherine Emmerline (known as “Bay”) and Noel Lawrence. Alice spent many years in Frome in Somerset and died at the age of 100 in 1970 at Lockner Holt in Guildford, Surrey.” Wikipedia\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1889, aged 19, Alice entered the Civil Service and was later appointed to the Accountant General’s office in General Post Office, London. Alice gave her spare time to Frederick Brotherton Meyer’s mission work at Regent’s Park Chapel and later Christ Church, Lambeth.\n\nAlice left the Civil Service to enter Doric Lodge, the training college of the Regions Beyond Missionary Union. Four days later, as her honeymoon, Alice sailed with John on the SS Cameroon to the Congo Free State as missionaries with the Congo-Balolo Mission. They arrived in the Congo three months later, on 4 August 1898, and then travelled to the Mission Station Ikau near Basankusu. She was appalled and saddened at what she witnessed there and began campaigning for the human rights of the Congolese natives to be recognised.\n\nCampaigner\n\nAlice was stationed with her husband John from 1898 to 1901 at the Mission Station at Ikau, near the Lulonga River, which is a tributary of the River Congo in the Balolo Tribal region.\n\nLater, from 1901 to 1905, they were stationed at the Mission Station at Baringa, a village in Tshuapa District, Befale Territory, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It stands on the banks of the Maringa River, approximately 100 km upriver from Basankusu.\n\nDuring her time in the Congo, Alice taught English to the local children, but her most important contribution was to photograph the injuries that were sustained by the Congolese natives at the hands of the agents and soldiers of King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold was partly exploiting the local population so fiercely to profit from increased rubber demand after the invention of the pneumatic or inflatable tyre by John Boyd Dunlop in Belfast in 1887. Methods of coercion included whipping, hostage-taking, rape, murder and burning of gardens and villages.\n\nThe most famous and shocking atrocity, whose aftermath Harris captured in her photography, was the severing of hands. In 1904, two men arrived at their mission from a village attacked by ‘sentries’ of the Abir Congo Company (ABIR) after failing to provide sufficient rubber. One of the men, Nsala, was holding a small bundle of leaves which when opened revealed the severed hand and foot of a child. Sentries had killed and mutilated Nsala’s wife and daughter. Appalled, Alice persuaded Nsala to pose with his child’s remains on the veranda of her home for a picture.\n\nInitially, Alice’s photographs were used in Regions Beyond, the magazine of the Congo Balolo Mission. In 1902, the Harrises returned to Britain temporarily. In 1904, Alice’s photographs reached wider distribution including Congo Slavery, a pamphlet prepared by Mrs. H. Grattan-Guinness, wife of the editor of Regions Beyond, and in King Leopold’s rule in Africa by E. D. Morel. The same year saw the founding of the Congo Reform Association by Morel.\n\nIn 1906, Alice and John Harris began working for Morel’s Congo Reform Association. In early 1906, they Alice toured the United States. John wrote that they had presented her images at 200 meetings in 49 cities via magic lantern screenings. In December 1906, the daily paper New York American used Harris’s photographs to illustrate articles on atrocities in the Congo for an entire week.\n\nIn 1908, the couple became joint organizing secretaries of the Congo Reform Association and, in April 1910, they became joint organizing secretaries of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines’ Protection Society. She soon relinquished her official position, but assisted John at the Society until his death in 1940. She continued her active speaking career and was listed with Christy’s Lecture Service alongside Winston Churchill and Ernest Shackleton.\n\nIn November 1908, Leopold II ceded administration of the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, thus creating the Belgian Congo. The Harrises returned to the Congo from 1911–12, following the handover of the Congo to Belgium. They noted improved conditions in the treatment of natives and later produced a book, Present Conditions in the Congo, illustrated with Alice’s photographs. Soon thereafter, hundreds of Alice’s African documentary photographs were displayed at an exhibition at the Colonial Institution.\n\nIn 1933, she became Lady Harris when her husband was knighted, but was known for saying, “don’t call me Lady!”.\n\nIn 1970, Alice reached 100 years old and was interviewed by BBC Radio 4 on a programme called Women of Our Time.\n\nShe was the first centenarian to be a member of the Frome Society for Local Study, which has placed a plaque near where she lived in Frome.” Wikipedia\n\nMore information :\n\nBBC article: “The horrific consequences of rubber’s toxic past – 24 July 2019”\n\nJean Depara (1928-1997) (Photojournalism)\n\nBiography 1 :\n\n“Depara begins in 1951 to photograph, the year of his marriage in Matadi. To record the event, he buys a small Adox camera. Back in Kinshasa in 1951, Depara attempts to reconcile photography and various odd jobs (repairer of bicycles, cameras, scrap …). Then in 1953 he set up his studio “Jean Whisky Depara” in Kato on No. 54.\n\nInter-ethnic metropolis since the years 1920-30, Leopoldville, as Brazzaville on the other side, is a bustling capital where you heard day and night Polka, Maringa, Tango, and of course Rumba. The music brings together the entire population of the city, Ghanaian, Senegalese, Congolese, coastmen, African, European… Music is the cultural link around which the populations of the city have joined forces, finding both melodies and ancient rhythms, and modern ones created by their idols or imported from Europe and Americas.\n\nGrouped into associations, youths of Leopoldviile (Kinshasa) gather in companies each with a gang leader, a style of dress, their female muses, a place where to meet (usually one of the countless bars, dance halls, the ‘Siluvangi’, ‘Amouzou’, ‘Congo Bar’, ‘Air France’, ‘Quist’, ‘Ok Bar’, ‘Chez Macauley’…) and ear music band (the most important are “OK Jazz” with Franco and the “African Jazz” with Joseph Kabasele), with singers and musicians perfectly trained in church choirs.\n\nThe boom of the music was amplified by the many labels installed on site (as ‘Olympia’ created in 1940, ‘Ngoma’ en 1947, ‘Loningisa’, ‘Opika’, ‘Essengo’…). They have facilitated the use of new instruments like electric guitar and sax, the diffusion of tubes (with radio) across Africa and Europe, organizing concerts and remuneration of the authors.\n\nDepara is part of these fun-loving youths, dancing, flirting. By day, while continuing photo studio, he attended in the city Nganda (bars) as ‘Kwist’ held by a West-African, ‘Ok Bar’, on Itaga, ‘Sarma Congo’. He also enjoys photographing bodybuilders (great seducers soon very popular) that he finds the afternoon at the sports complex La Funa, a place of entertainment for all, Blacks and Whites.\n\nAt night, alone with his flash camera slung over his shoulder, ‘like a bow’ he said, he toured the fashionable nightclubs : the ‘Afro Mogenbo’, the ‘Champs-Elysées’, the ‘Djambo-Djambu’, the ‘Oui’, the ‘Fifi’, the ‘Show Bot’.\n\nIn 1955, the ‘Kongo Bar’ was the most ‘in’ spot on Tshoapa street after Itaga, (now a church) along the ‘Opika’ (intersection Kabambaré-Bokassa) and the ‘Bingabar’ on Moero lake (Barumbu neighbourhood).\n\nEach dancing had its resident orchestra and its regulars boys and girls. The atmosphere was crazy, suitable for all encounters. And the business of photography was easy for Depara. Noticed in 1954 by Franco, the maestro of the Zairean rumba, he became his official photographer (Depara was only 26) and invited him to all his musical evenings (including in Mokalia) until the singer’s death in 1989. The atmosphere is crazy, as selling photography easy.\n\nWhile keeping up his night work, he tooks photograph the day in his studio until 1956. From 1975 to 1989, in his fifties, he become the official photographer attached to the Parliament.\n\nIn 1989 he retires to devote himself to fishing and building pirogues. Depara died in 1997 in Kinshasa at the age of 69 years, leaving more than 5000 pictures of a boosted and carefree time when Kinshasa was the vibrant and crazy heart of all over Africa. Kin-the-joy, Kin-the-madness” as says the novelist Achilles Ngoye.\n\nThe photograph of Depara, always perfect framing and knowing transcribe the crazy atmosphere of the youth of Kin, not bother with any prejudice about actors of its nights, nor of taboo, or surprising love for a night, there a beautiful provocative neckline, or even after the escapade of a band in search of adventure. Because Depara is not only a photographer but also a young man who lives moments of his photo. And we relive those moments. The great Depara photographs the great Kinshasa in years 1951-75.” Revue Noire\n\nBiography 2\n\n“Lemvo Jean Abou Bakar Depara, known as Depara (1928–1997), was an Angolan-born photographer who worked in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nDepara purchased his first video camera to record his wedding in 1950; four years later, he was made official photographer to the Zairian singer Franco. In 1975 he became official photographer to the National Assembly of Democratic Republic of Congo. He also took many photographs of the social scene of Kinshasa during the period. At his death in 1997 he left a large archive of untitled negatives; many of these have been reprinted and titled for sale since his death.\n\nSome of Depara’s work is in the collection of Jean Pigozzi.” Wikipedia\n\nBiography 3\n\n“Born in 1928, Kboklolo, Angola. Died in 1997, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where he lived and worked.\n\nDepara came to photography almost by accident. To record his wedding in 1950 he bought himself a small Adox camera after which he never ceased to seek out new subjects for his lens. Settling in Kinshasa in 1951, Depara first combined his photography with various small jobs: repairing bicycles and cameras, dealing in scrap metal. In 1954 the celebrated Zairian singer Franco invited him to become his official photographer, launching Depara’s career as a chronicler of Kinshasa social life in the era when the Rumba and the Cha Cha defined the city’s rhythm. He set up a studio under the name Jean Whisky Depara and spent his days in bars like the Kwist, the OK Bar, or the Sarma Congo. At night he hung out at such clubs as the Afro Mogenbo, the Champs-Elysées, the DjamboDjambu, the Oui, the Fifi, the Show Boat. Night owls particularly fascinated him and with his flash Depara captured an Africa stripped of conventional social codes. Interracial couples, hipsters, and those who in imitation of James Dean chose to “Live fast, die young” became both his subjects and his clients.\n\nAmong Depara’s themes in his photographs are the Miziki who have such a powerful role in Kinshasa society.\n\nThese associations of women were rooted in pre-independence traditions, and a Moziki (singular form of Miziki) could act as a banker within her social circle. In the 1950s and 1960s, Miziki associations took such names as La Pause and La Mode, and commissioned famous bands to compose songs for their annual events.\n\nDepara died leaving his archive of hundreds negatives untitled; with the permission of the artist’s family, his close friend Oscar Mbemba has titled the works in the spirit of this era. “\n\nSource : Magnin-A (retrieved 2023)\n\nMore information:\n\nGallery 51\n\nSmithsonian : National Museum of African Art\n\nRevue-Noire\n\nHerzekiah Andrew Shanu (1858-1905) (Photojournalism)\n\nWikipedia\n\n“Herzekiah Andrew Shanu (1858 – July 1905) was an African photographer notably recognized for his involvement in the campaign against inhumane abuses in the Congo Free State.\n\nEarly years\n\nHe was a Yoruba man, originally from Lagos in what is now Nigeria. He initially became a school teacher. He was educated at the Church Missionary Society Grammar School, and later in the Training Institute for Teachers, at the end of which he graduated as a teacher.\n\nFor a few years, he taught at a Lagos Primary School.\n\nHowever, in 1884, he entered the colonial service of the Congo Free State as a clerk, rising to the rank of district sub-commissioner and a French-English translator in the office of the governor-general in Boma.\n\nEstablishing himself at Boma, then the capital, he opened a general store and photographic studio. In 1894, he traveled to Antwerp to attend the Exposition Internationale d’Anvers. Some of his photographs were published in Le Congo illustré. In 1900 he demonstrated his loyalty to the Congo Free State by supporting the authorities during a mutiny by the Force Publique.\n\nIn 1903 Shanu supplied Roger Casement with information concerning the abuse of West African workers in the Congo, who in turn referred him to E.

He was knighted in 1897, and served in Parliament as a Liberal Unionist member for Lambeth North from 1895 to 1900.\n\nMore than a century after his death, Stanley’s legacy remains the subject of enduring controversy. Although he personally had high regard for many of the native African people who accompanied him on his expeditions, the exaggerated accounts of corporal punishment and brutality in his books fostered a public reputation as a hard-driving, cruel leader, in contrast to the supposedly more humanitarian Livingstone. His contemporary image in Britain also suffered from the inaccurate perception that he was American. In the 20th century, his reputation was also seriously damaged by his role in establishing the Congo Free State for King Leopold II. Nevertheless, he is recognized for his important contributions to Western knowledge of the geography of Central Africa and for his resolute opposition to the slave trade in East Africa.”\n\nRoyal African Museum\n\nCasimir Zagourski (1888-1944) (Photojournalism)\n\n“Casimir Ostoja Zagourski (in Polish Kazimierz Zagórski; 9 August 1883 – 10 January 1944) was a Polish pioneering photographer of Central African peoples and customs.\n\nZagourski was born in Zhytomyr in 1883. He was a Pole, from the noble Clan of Ostoja.[1] He served in the Imperial Russian Air Force until 1917, rising to the rank of colonel, and in the Polish military during 1920.\n\nHe emigrated from Europe in 1924 and settled in Léopoldville (Belgian Congo), gallicizing his name and opening a photographic studio. Between 1924 and his death he travelled widely in Central Africa, undertaking expeditions to photograph “disappearing” native African traditions in 1929, 1932, 1935 and 1937.[2]\n\nHis albums and a postcard series collectively entitled L’Afrique qui disparaît! gained him considerable renown.\n\nHe died in Léopoldville in 1944.” Wikipedia\n\n“In the years between the two world wars, no photographer in central Africa visually articulated popular ideas about the peoples in this region more eloquently than Casimir Zagourski (1883-1944). His oeuvre consists of hundreds of black-and-white prints, exquisite in technical and aesthetic execution.\n\nZagourski was born Kazimierz Zagórski in what is today Ukraine to the family of a Polish nobleman. (In 1883 Poland was under Russian occupation, and the family had moved to Russia.) Zagourski served in the czarist air force, and following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 he returned to a now-independent Poland, but he found it difficult to make a living. In 1924 he settled in Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, and opened a photographic studio. Zagourski became an accomplished photographer specializing in portraiture. He soon received commissions from the colonial government to cover official events, and he photographed colonial buildings and establishments.\n\nHis great passion, however, was to document the peoples of central Africa. Like his contemporaries, he believed that central African cultures were on the verge of extinction and that photography could preserve those aspects that were bound to disappear. Between 1929 and 1937, he set out on several expeditions to French Equatorial Africa (A.E.F.), Rwanda, Kenya and Tanganyika. With superb technique and great sensitivity he created portraits of Africans that–although taken in the tradition of anthropological photography–evoke a sense of closeness and empathy. He documented African dress and adornment, scarifications, coiffures, dances, masquerades and architecture. Accomplished images of landscapes give a sense of the sheer beauty of central and eastern Africa.\n\nZagourski selected 415 of these pictures and published them as numbered series of photographic prints on postcard stock in a portfolio he titled L’Afrique qui disparaît! (Vanishing Africa!). Deluxe editions of the portfolio, bound in embossed leather and carrying his imprint, can be found in several European collections. He also created exhibition prints, among them a set for display in the Belgian pavilion during the 1937 Colonial Exhibition in Paris. L’Afrique qui disparaît! is a masterpiece, articulating the vision of this gifted photographer and his views about Africans, which he shared with his contemporaries. Casimir Zagourski, who died in Léopoldville in 1944, left a lasting legacy of photographs that shaped the public’s image of central Africa for many years to come.” Smithsonian: The Image World of Casimir Zagourski\n\nAntoine Freitas (1919-1990) (Photojournalism)\n\n“Antoine Freitas, born in 1919 in Angola and died in 1990 in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo), is a Congolese photographer, one of the pioneers of photography in Africa.\n\nTrained by a missionary in Angola, he settled in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) in 1932, then traveled the country as a traveling photographer from 1935.

(Belgian colony propaganda)\n\n“Carlo Lamote, born in 1928, left for the Belgian Congo in January 1950 as a photographer-filmmaker at Inforcongo, the Information Service of the General Government. On June 30, 1960, he became Advisor to Anicet Kashamura, Minister of Information and Cultural Affairs. In October 1961, he was put in charge of setting up Congolese Television by the Minister of Information and Cultural Affairs, Joseph Iléo. In 1964, he left the Belgian Technical Assistance to found the film production and distribution company Inter African Films and the African Newsfilm Agency. In 1965, he became President of the International Press Association in the Congo and, in 1966, founded Congovox, whose main partner was the Congolese government and of which he became the Managing Director. In 1980, he founded his own real estate company in Congo and, in 2005, the AideGoma association of which he is the Secretary General.” Source\n\n“Though no biographical information on Carlo Lamote has yet come to light, he was clearly a Belgian photographer working for Congopresse, the main agency for photojournalism in the Belgian Congo from its inception in 1947 until independence in 1960. Lamote’s image likely dates from the early 1950s.” Elliot Fine Art\n\nArticle : Carlo Lamote and Cédric Gerbehaye 50 years of photographing in Congo, Knack.be (25/05/2010)\n\n“Carlo Lamote started in 1950 as a photographer in the service of the Belgian Congo. After independence, he founded the Congolese state television news service.\n\nPhotographer Cédric Gerbehaye was far from then born, his Congo passion only flared up three years ago.\n\nWe brought both generations together around a table with lots of pictures. “Photographers are the archivists of their era.”\n\nCarlo Lamote and Cédric Gerbehaye are almost fifty years apart. So two generations. But also: the age of the country that brought them together, four high in the tower block in Ostend where Carlo Lamote (82) lives with his wife Gigi. The meeting was orchestrated by us, call it a gamble.\n\n(…)\n\nPhotographer and cameraman Carlo Lamote left for Congo in 1950 to work for the colonial information service. For ten years he traveled to all corners of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi to highlight the colonial achievements.\n\nPropaganda is something like that, which does not detract from the fact that he turned out to be an excellent photographer within those boundaries.\n\nTogether with his colleague Henri Goldstein, Lamote has shaped our image of the Belgian Congo. Open any book about the 1950s in the colony, and you’ll find their names below the photos.\n\nAfter independence, he founded his own film production company and news agency, with Visnew, ABC and CBS as regular customers. He was one of the founders of Congovox, the news service of the Congolese state broadcaster, which was also not averse to propaganda. “I was director,” he says. “Once I was summoned to President Mobutu. He had stepped on his toe because we had shortened his speech. That couldn’t happen again. When the chief spoke, the people had to be able to hear every word. (…)\n\nOwn plane\n\nCarlo Lamote has a proven method for breaking the ice. He takes out his photo and scrapbook, a colossus of 12 kilos. It starts with childhood snapshots and ends with a disturbing number of obituaries of acquaintances from Congo. His career and life course lie between the two extremes.\n\nPhotos, of course, but also certificates of prizes he received, and articles he wrote for De Week, the only Flemish magazine in Congo that was founded by his brother Jos Lamote.\n\nCédric leafs through the book, Carlo comments. “Working at Inforcongo was a luxury,” he says. “We had a DC3 from the Force Publique available, which we flew to the most remote airstrips in the bush. A car was ready on site, because the roads were still passable at that time. We stayed in a hotel or a gîte, all at the expense of the state.\n\nOf course we knew what was expected of us: we were paid to clean up the colony’s image. Is that propaganda? Maybe, but I’ve never felt uncomfortable with it. The image we put up was realistic.”\n\n(…)\n\nIt’s not just that the infrastructure is completely in tatters. The more I am in Congo, the more I am amazed at the corruption.\n\nIt is everywhere, in the highest echelons in Kinshasa, but also in the smallest village along the river.”\n\nThe browsing continues. Grimer images emerge between the cheerful holiday snaps and grandiose tableaux of people, fauna and flora.\n\nCarlo Lamote was there when anti-Belgian riots broke out on 4 January 1959 in Léopoldville. The revolt lasted four days and killed dozens of blacks. “But those photos were never published,” says Carlo, resigned effortlessly to this form of censorship.\n\n“Inforcongo had no interest in it, they did not want to make the concern in Belgium greater than it already was.”\n\nThe riots were nevertheless a turning point, as Congo was heading towards independence at breakneck speed.\n\nOn June 30, 1960 Carlo was working as a cameraman, his last job for Inforcongo. In one of the photos you can see him standing with his Arriflex 16mm on his shoulder, an extra in the margins of a historical scene in which Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and King Baudouin play the leading roles. “It was a very charged moment,” he says. Lumumba’s speech came as an ice-cold shower.\n\nIn this photo you can see how I zoom in on the king. Not coincidentally, because like everyone else I thought he would get up and walk away angrily. They stopped him, otherwise he would have done it.”\n\nBelgium complex\n\nFifty years later, is there something to celebrate on June 30? And if so, does King Albert have to go to the party in Congo? “There is nothing to celebrate,” says Carlo.\n\n“Everything is broken over there. I have seen Carl De Keyzer’s Congo book. I’ve been to all those places myself, you should put my photos next to his. The decay hurts the eye.\n\n(…)\n\nCan photos change the world? Carlo doesn’t believe in it. We are inundated with images of war and misery, he muses, people shrug their shoulders at it. Cédric sounds less resigned. “Of course I cannot change the reality in Congo. Photos do not have that power, as far as I know, it has only happened twice that photographers have influenced the course of a war. I think of Vietnam and Abu Ghraib in Iraq, although the photos there were taken by American prison guards. So I have no illusions, but I do have ambition: I want to break through the general indifference to the suffering in Congo. If people start to think and feel involved after seeing my images, then I have succeeded.”\n\nWar criminal Nkunda\n\nThe war photos awakened Carlo’s memories. He was the first correspondent when the Belgian paratroopers drove the Simba insurgents from Stanleyville in 1964, the massacre of black and white is very clear to him. Not a war, but just as gruesome was the mock trial with which Mobutu eliminated four prominent politicians in 1966. Les pendus de la Pentecôte, that’s the name of that inky black page in Congolese history. According to Carlo, it is his best report ever, while he was not able to shoot a single image. “All journalists had to hand over their cameras, both at the trial and at the public execution.\n\nA colleague from AFP had smuggled a pocket camera along. I made a tear in my newspaper so that he could secretly photograph the execution. Unfortunately, that image failed. I saw four people die by hanging that day. I knew one of them, former Prime Minister Evariste Kimba, very well. I was blown away by that for a long time.”\n\nHas he also worked in dangerous conditions? Cédric ignores Carlo’s question. He is often labeled a war photographer, but he resolutely refuses. Concerned photography is the English term he prefers. (…)\n\nThe farewell is cordial. Carlo does not dare to promise that he will come to the vernissage in the Brussels Botanique. Health, you know. But he definitely wants the book. “Tough work,” he says. “It is heavy, you go very deep. I don’t really see any comparison with my work, neither in style nor in terms of themes. But yes, two generations difference. Photography has changed, and Congo has changed.’ Cédric puts his arm on the elderly man’s shoulder. “And yet there is a common ground,” says the young Brussels resident. “Despite the difference in style and approach, we do the same. Photographers are the archivists of the era in which they live, each in their own way.”\n\nBY ERIK RASPOET / photo filip naudts\n\nSource : Knack.be (Translated from Dutch using Google Translate)\n\nMore information :\n\nLiberas Expo\n\nJoseph Makula (1929-2006) (Belgian colony propaganda)\n\n“Joseph Makula (1929–2006) was a Congolese photographer. He initially served as a military photographer for the Force Publique before being hired as the first Congolese photographer for Congopresse in 1956. After Congopresse closed in 1968, he worked as a freelancer and established his own studio. He died in 2006\n\nJoseph Makula was born in 1929 in Orientale Province, Belgian Congo. He attended a nursing school in Stanleyville, but enlisted in the Force Publique in Port-Francqui in 1948. The following year he was stationed in Léopoldville, and the editor of the army’s newspaper, Sango Ya Biso, tapped him as a photographer for the publication. He was later made a supervisor of a military photographic lab tasked with developing film. He left the army in 1956 and briefly found work at a newspaper, Pourquoi pas l’Avenir.\n\nLater in 1956 or 1957 Makula was hired by Congopresse, the Belgian Congo’s official press agency, as its first Congolese photographer. He mainly photographed “évolués”, educated Congolese who formed an elite social group in the colony. He worked mostly in and around the capital, Léopoldville, taking few photographs in the outlying provinces and never taking pictures of villages. Unlike his European colleagues, Makula took few photographs of official ceremonies or visiting foreign dignitaries.\n\nFollowing Congolese independence in 1960, Congopresse’s European staff departed, and Makula went to Belgium for a training course in photography. When he returned to the Congo, he trained a new group of Congolese photographers for the agency, including its only woman photographer, Mpate Sulia. In 1968, Congopresse closed down and Mukula became a freelance photographer. He set up his own photo studio, Photo Mak, in Lemba, Kinshasa, in 1981. It operated until 1991.
