        "text": "Domaine Louis Latour covers 48 hectares of vineyard, from the red Grand Cru of Chambertin and Romanée-Saint-Vivant in the Côte de Nuits to the white Grand Cru of Corton-Charlemagne and Chevalier-Montrachet in the Côte de Beaune. The company went from strength to strength during the 19th century culminating in the purchase of these exceptional sites. Today, Louis Latour's vineyards, represent the largest holding of Grand Cru vineyards in Burgundy.\n\nDomaine Louis Latour Video\n\nSustainable Viticulture at Domain Louis Latour\n\nBurgundy's varied and diverse terroirs are unique and the characteristics of each parcel are expressed through the single variety wines. In Burgundy our red wines are made from Pinot Noir and our white wines from Chardonnay. The grapes are hand harvested, Pinot noir grapes are sorted and de-stemmed whilst the whites are sorted and then taken directly to the press.\n\nChristophe Deola has been in charge of Domaine Louis Latour since 2017. Oenologist and Engineer of the prestigious Agronomic Institute of Paris, Christophe Deola began his career as oenologist in Bordeaux at Château Phélan-Ségur. He then joined the National Institute of Agricultural Research before travelling to Tasmania, Australia to vinify the wines of Piper's Brook Winery. After having worked for various Burgundian domains, he joined Maison Louis Latour in 2011 as technical director before being appointed director of Domaine Louis Latour in 2017. Passionate, erudite and meticulous, his search for excellence is a daily pursuit whose aim is to produce wines of stature, finesse and elegance.\n\nSince the early 1990s Maison Louis Latour have actively practiced sustainable viticulture and worked to preserve the ecosystems and biodiversity of their vineyards. Christophe Deola shares this vision and is actively following and developing the work already put in place by his predecessors. It is in this spirit that Maison Louis Latour chose to practice traditional viticultural techniques where care of the soil is essential to allow the vines to grow in the best conditions. Several examples of our commitment to preserving the ecosystem are the use of cover crops between rows, production of our own compost and alternative non chemical pest control measures.\n\nInnovation has been at the core of Maison Louis Latour since our inception and today, we are at the forefront of wine research in Burgundy. Our research investigates the impact of vinegrowing and winemaking on the climate, environment and geological complexities of each parcel, and the genetic diversity of the vines in our vineyards. Since 1996 our weather stations have been managed in partnership with the University of Dijon, the data collected has allowed us take better vineyard management decisions. In recent years this work has gone even further with an initiative called 'Paysage de Corton'. The initiative stems from the work begun by Maison Louis Latour and, in 2009 , became an association with other growers from the village of Aloxe Corton. This partnership between growers is unique and seeks to addresses the problems of erosion, drainage in the village's vineyards and undertakes projects such as the planting of trees and hedges and the maintenance of bee hives to promote biodiversity.\n\nNoble terroir is central to a great wine however to fully achieve this, the work of a highly skilled team is essential. Extreme attention to detail is required at every stage to ensure the right decisions are made. This is especially true in pruning and canopy management.\n\nDomaine Louis Latour's philosophy has always been to maximise the quality of grapes to produce great wines; 90% of the work is done in the vineyards however the remaining 10% is critical. The care and attention to detail seen in our vineyards is carried over into our winemaking where we are committed to traditional and manual techniques. All domaine wines are made in Aloxe-Corton at the beautiful Corton Grancey Cuverie."
