        "text": "By REUTERS\n\neopoldville, the Congo -- President Joseph Kasavubu was deposed early today in a bloodless military coup by Maj. Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu, the Congolese Army commander. General Mobutu installed an Army Government under his own direction.\n\nAnnouncement of the coup was made in a dawn proclamation over the Leopoldville radio.\n\nThe proclamation of the new government named Col. Leonard Mulamba, 34 years old, as Premier in place of Evariste Kimba, who was named by President Kasavubu only 10 days ago to try to form a new government.\n\nMaj. Gen. Louis Bobozo, head of the army command in the Katanga provinces, was named to replace General Mobutu as head of the army while General Mobutu assumed the role of President.\n\nLeopoldville Is Calm\n\nThe proclamation said a meeting of high ranking army officers yesterday decided to remove the Kasavubu Government because of its \"absolute failure\" in the political field.\n\nLeopoldville remained calm throughout the change of leadership and there were no extra military patrols evident in the city. But a handful of para-commando troops were stationed at the radio station and all transmissions were controlled.\n\nMr. Kasavubu, 53 years old, spent the night at his presidential palace in suburban Leopoldville.\n\nHe was due to leave the residence during the morning, a source close to the deposed President said.\n\nThis is the second coup by the 35-year old General Mobutu. In 1960, he deposed President Kasavubu and headed a college of Commissioners for nine months before handing back control to the parliament.\n\nToday's coup follows a tense conflict between President Kasavubu and former Premier Moise Tshombe, the Katanga leader, who was removed from office as Premier by Mr. Kasavubu on Oct. 13.\n\nBut, led by Mr. Tshombe's Conaco party alliance, the Parliament refused on Nov. 14 to approve a Government led by Mr. Kimba, a North Katanga politician.\n\nNew Government's Proclamation\n\nLeopoldville, Friday, Nov. 25 (AP)--The Congolese National Radio broadcast this communique this morning:\n\n\"On the evening of Nov. 24 the Army Commander in Chief, Maj. Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu, invited the army leaders to his home. There they discussed the military and political situation and found the military situation to be satisfactory.\n\n\"The army leaders found the political situation against the best interests of the country--the army is the only national institution with the confidence of all the people. The army takes the following measures:\n\n\"1. President Joseph Kasavubu is dismissed.\n\n\"2. Premier-designate Evariste Kimba is relieved of his duties.\n\n\"3. Brig. Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu assumes the functions of the chief of state.\n\n\"4. All national institutions will continue to function.\n\n\"5. The Congo will continue its obligations to the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.\n\n\"6. The Congo vows friendship to its neighbors.\n\n\"7. The Congo adheres to the Organization of African States and Malagasy if Parliament agrees.\n\n\"8. Rapprochements with other African states will continue.\n\n\"9. No external interference will be tolerated.\n\n\"10. Censorship against all suppressed papers is lifted and editors are invited to print again.\n\n\"11. All constitutional rights are respected, including the freedom of conscience, religion, expression, press and assembly.\n\nIn Washington, an official said the State Department had learned of the coup from United States embassy sources in Leopoldville. The official said first reports indicated the city was quiet, adding: \"We're watching, of course.\"\n\nRecent Test With Tshombe\n\nA summer-long struggle for power in Congolese politics be [WORDS MISSING]\n\nThe test came when the Leopoldville Parliament met in October. Mr. Tshombe did not resign and Mr. Kasavubu dismissed him. However, Mr. Tshombe showed no signs of leading a revolt, as he professed he wanted to build his party, known as Conaco, into an effective Opposition.\n\nIn the last week there were signs that the political struggle was getting tougher. Mr. Tshombe charged that Mr. Kasavubu had embarked on a policy of \"repression and intimidation\" to insure his own re-election.\n\nGeneral Mobutu, who has been chief of staff of the Army since July, 1960, has been considered a moderate voice in both military and political affairs. The thin, bespectacled young man does not look the role of the \"strong man,\" but he has demonstrated on many occasions that he could keep the Congolese army in his grip."
