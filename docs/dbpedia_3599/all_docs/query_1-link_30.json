The Brass Band Stage, nestled in Armstrong Park, will showcase an impressive array of local talent, including the Rebirth Brass Band, Hot 8 Brass Band, Tremé Brass Band, Original Pinettes Brass Band, Shake Em’ Up Jazz Band, and more. Simultaneously, the Congo Square Stage will feature a Drum Circle and a variety of musical acts including Corey Henry & Tremé Funktet, The Rumble, Tribal Gold, Claude Bryant & the Reggae Allstars, Alfred Banks with special guest Kaye the Beast, and several African dance groups.\n\nThe festivities kick off with a live concert by Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and the Golden Eagles at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center, 1225 N. Rampart Street, on Friday, March 22. Tickets for this show are $10, available here.\n\nLeading up to the festival, a Tom Dent Congo Square Lecture will explore the rich oral traditions from Africa, focusing on how these traditions are passed down through family lineage. Big Chief Victor Harris’ journey and the Mandingo Warriors’ unique contributions to the Black Masking Indian Tribe will be highlighted. The lecture is free and open to the public on Wednesday, March 20, from 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center, 1225 N. Rampart Street.

The Class Got Brass competition is presented by the Gia Maione Prima Foundation and takes place on Saturday, March 23, where middle and high schools in Louisiana have the opportunity to create a New Orleans-style brass band with up to 12 members. They’ll enter a competition in the form of a “second-line” parade with celebrity judges, and more than $50,000 worth of instruments and supplies are up for grabs for the winning schools’ music programs. The deadline to apply is Friday, February 23, 11:00 pm.

Sylvester of Sherman Atlas Sylvester & Stamelman LLP. Gia Maione Prima was a singer and the widow of Louis Prima, the famous jazz musician, singer and composer from New Orleans. The GMPF makes donations to tax-exempt organizations supporting and encouraging an appreciation for American jazz, American popular music and jazz performance as well as the fine arts.\n\nAbout the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation:\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation invests proceeds from Jazz Fest and additional funds that we raise for year-round programming in education, economic development and cultural enrichment. Education programs include the Don “Moose” Jamison Heritage School of Music, the Tom Dent Congo Square Lectures, the Class Got Brass competition for school brass bands, a youth audio workshop program, youth vocal workshops, and more! Economic Development initiatives include the Community Partnership Grants, the Catapult Fund accelerator program and Sync Up entertainment industry workshops. Cultural enrichment programs include the Jazz & Heritage Concert Series and annual Foundation Festivals: the Crescent City Blues & BBQ Festival, the Congo Square Rhythms Festival, the Tremé Creole Gumbo Festival and the Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco Festival. Importantly, these are free programs that the Jazz and Heritage Foundation has developed over many years to ensure that we give back to Louisiana. The Jazz & Heritage Foundation also owns radio station WWOZ 90.7-FM and the Jazz & Heritage Archive. In late 2014, the Foundation opened the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center – an education and community facility named for the late Jazz Fest founder George Wein and his wife Joyce. In March of 2020, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation established the Jazz & Heritage Music Relief Fund – a statewide relief fund to support Louisiana musicians who were affected by the pandemic. In the last two years the Jazz & Heritage Foundation has been able to provide relief funds of more than $2 million dollars supporting musicians, music industry gig workers, Black Masking Indians and other indigenous cultural practitioners.
