He told me yesterday he ran into a guy on a stream he and I used to fish when we were kids and this guy was there to harvest brookies. I know that stream extremely well, and I really don‚Äôt think it can withstand a lot of harvest. it‚Äôs not a big stream at all and the fishable section is very short. I highly doubt this is the guy‚Äôs first and only trip there too. Add natural mortality and incidental mortality from c&r, and that might point to why its a somewhat struggling population.\n\nThere have been times in the past where I got concerned about that stream because I could tell the population was way down.

They want the public to be unaware as they quietly get extirpated largely due to PA fish and boats actions. Its like PA fish and boat crapped the bed and instead of doing the right thing and cleaning it up they just pulled the covers over it and said ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù. Its why their afraid to do any public education on brook trout like the delinquent goal in their trout management plan lists. Why they don‚Äôt post about them on social media(i have seen like 30 red eared slider posts in FB but like 1 with a brook trout), its why they don‚Äôt make any regs for them that would educate the public, its why they keep pushing ‚Äúwild trout‚Äù management so they can homogenize native and invasive species together in the publics mind and no one realizes their causing a loss of one and spread of the other.\n\nEventually the blankets will have to come off the bed and everyone will see they have been letting the s**** pile up for years.\n\nPA fish and Boat cannot decide if they want to tell people there would be an army of villagers with pitch forks and torches if they were catch and release vs. ‚Äúno one keeps em‚Äù which is obviously horse s****.\n\nThey can do it for brown trout which probably will have many more angry anglers who like to harvest them vs. brook trout but bot for the state fish listed in the wildlife action plan.

Except it's our state fish and they mandated it in the state wildlife action plan, bay agreement, etc.\n\nWe have so many of them! There's no issue. They aren't declining. Nothing to see here.\n\nSympatry is good! Just have to plant trees and everything will sort itself out.\n\nWhat were the results of the special brook trout waters like upper Kettle & Birch Run several years ago?\n\nWe really don‚Äôt know because their only goal was to make a 12 foot long brook trout. We don‚Äôt know what it did effect it had on genetics/gene flow, long term populations at proper scale ect. In 2023 the idea of making a management change in fish that have life history events at watershed scale and measuring a 300 some meter reach is about as relevant a contribution to fisheries science as what my son did in his diaper this Am that shot up the back of his Onezee. Now this study was done years ago but long story short the results don‚Äôt have much any conclusive findings from a species conservation standpoint and even its measurement of attempted goal, the 170 something millimeter brook trout was shaky at best with the small sample size of the reaches could have completely missed 170 mm fish due to life history events like going to bigger water down stream ect.\n\nWhat were the results of the special brook trout waters like upper Kettle & Birch Run several years ago?\n\nFrom the Minutes from the 117th Meeting of the PFBC held on January 21, 2016:\n\nVolume 67 Page 20\n\nJanuary 21, 2016\n\nDESIGNATIONS\n\nC. Designation of Upper Kettle Creek Basin as Catch and Release All-Tackle under Section\n\n65.15.\n\nCommentary:\n\nThe upper Kettle Creek basin was managed under the Wild Brook Trout Enhancement\n\nProgram through July 2015. As part of evaluating the wild Brook Trout enhancement\n\nregulations, staff monitored 16 treatment and seven control streams (statewide\n\nregulations) throughout Pennsylvania. The goal of the evaluation was to assess the Wild\n\nBrook Trout Enhancement Program as a whole to determine its efficacy. Results of the\n\nprogram evaluation indicated that the regulation was not effective at increasing the\n\nnumber of adult (>4 inches) or legal size (>7 inches) wild Brook Trout. As a result, staff\n\nrecommended that the wild Brook Trout enhancement regulations be eliminated, and the\n\nBoard approved this action at the July 2015 Commission meeting. Staff also indicated\n\nthat a subset of the streams managed under the wild Brook Trout enhancement\n\nregulations might be moved to another existing special regulation if the data supported\n\nthis management change.\n\nDuring the review of the Wild Brook Trout Enhancement Program, staff noted that the\n\nupper Kettle Creek basin streams seemed to respond differently than the other streams\n\nincluded in the study. Staff worked with the Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife\n\nResearch Unit to analyze the data on an individual stream basis to determine if this was\n\nthe case. Results indicated that five of the seven sample sites located on upper Kettle\n\nCreek and four of its tributaries had a significant increase in the number of legal-size\n\nBrook Trout. These were the only streams managed under the wild Brook Trout\n\nenhancement regulations that showed a significant increase. The upper Kettle Creek\n\nwatershed is the largest stronghold for Brook Trout in Pennsylvania, is a destination\n\nfishery for anglers, and was the largest system included in the study. These factors may\n\nhelp to explain why this system responded differently than the other waters in the\n\nprogram.\n\nBased on the final data review and the ecological importance of the upper Kettle Creek\n\nwatershed, staff recommend that the upper Kettle Creek basin from the headwaters of\n\nKettle Creek downstream to the confluence with Long Run, including Long Run and all\n\ntributaries upstream to the headwaters, be designated as catch and release all-tackle under\n\n58 Pa.
