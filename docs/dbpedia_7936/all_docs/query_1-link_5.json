        "text": "Yes, enforcement is a problem, but let's forget about that just one minute.\n\nOn unstocked wild trout streams, Brook compose of 69 percent of wild trout caught. 236,461 total brook trout caught.\n\nThe harvest data is also saying 19,297 wild brook trout 7 inches or larger are harvested.\n\nWhich is 12.25 percent the caught population\n\nharvested.\n\nThen compare that to this PDF on wild trout in PA Witten by Mike K.\n\nI keep hearing it takes 4 or 5 years to grow a legal size brook trout, then I hear most don't survive that long, then we harvest 12 percent the total caught at 19,000 fish a year.....\n\nOuch.\n\nWhat percentage of the total caught population is legal size?\n\nUsing the numbers, if 8 percent of a brook trout population is legal (and that's in our best waters, half the states waters have few legal size brook trout), we harvest at a very high rate the legal ones caught.\n\nI'm doubting much, if any, get released that are legal size.\n\nIMO of course.\n\nA buddy of mine is a game warden. He told me yesterday he ran into a guy on a stream he and I used to fish when we were kids and this guy was there to harvest brookies. I know that stream extremely well, and I really don’t think it can withstand a lot of harvest. it’s not a big stream at all and the fishable section is very short. I highly doubt this is the guy’s first and only trip there too. Add natural mortality and incidental mortality from c&r, and that might point to why its a somewhat struggling population.\n\nThere have been times in the past where I got concerned about that stream because I could tell the population was way down. They bounce back, but what would it be if it weren’t for the added deliberate harvest?\n\nA buddy of mine is a game warden.

Its rediculous.\n\nThey don’t want to draw any attention to wild native brook trout because the management in this state is the largest skid mark in their underpants. They want the public to be unaware as they quietly get extirpated largely due to PA fish and boats actions. Its like PA fish and boat crapped the bed and instead of doing the right thing and cleaning it up they just pulled the covers over it and said “nothing to see here”. Its why their afraid to do any public education on brook trout like the delinquent goal in their trout management plan lists. Why they don’t post about them on social media(i have seen like 30 red eared slider posts in FB but like 1 with a brook trout), its why they don’t make any regs for them that would educate the public, its why they keep pushing “wild trout” management so they can homogenize native and invasive species together in the publics mind and no one realizes their causing a loss of one and spread of the other.\n\nEventually the blankets will have to come off the bed and everyone will see they have been letting the s**** pile up for years.\n\nPA fish and Boat cannot decide if they want to tell people there would be an army of villagers with pitch forks and torches if they were catch and release vs. “no one keeps em” which is obviously horse s****.\n\nThey can do it for brown trout which probably will have many more angry anglers who like to harvest them vs. brook trout but bot for the state fish listed in the wildlife action plan.

Except it's our state fish and they mandated it in the state wildlife action plan, bay agreement, etc.\n\nWe have so many of them! There's no issue. They aren't declining. Nothing to see here.\n\nSympatry is good! Just have to plant trees and everything will sort itself out.\n\nWhat were the results of the special brook trout waters like upper Kettle & Birch Run several years ago?\n\nWe really don’t know because their only goal was to make a 12 foot long brook trout. We don’t know what it did effect it had on genetics/gene flow, long term populations at proper scale ect. In 2023 the idea of making a management change in fish that have life history events at watershed scale and measuring a 300 some meter reach is about as relevant a contribution to fisheries science as what my son did in his diaper this Am that shot up the back of his Onezee. Now this study was done years ago but long story short the results don’t have much any conclusive findings from a species conservation standpoint and even its measurement of attempted goal, the 170 something millimeter brook trout was shaky at best with the small sample size of the reaches could have completely missed 170 mm fish due to life history events like going to bigger water down stream ect.\n\nWhat were the results of the special brook trout waters like upper Kettle & Birch Run several years ago?\n\nFrom the Minutes from the 117th Meeting of the PFBC held on January 21, 2016:\n\nVolume 67 Page 20\n\nJanuary 21, 2016\n\nDESIGNATIONS\n\nC. Designation of Upper Kettle Creek Basin as Catch and Release All-Tackle under Section\n\n65.15.\n\nCommentary:\n\nThe upper Kettle Creek basin was managed under the Wild Brook Trout Enhancement\n\nProgram through July 2015. As part of evaluating the wild Brook Trout enhancement\n\nregulations, staff monitored 16 treatment and seven control streams (statewide\n\nregulations) throughout Pennsylvania. The goal of the evaluation was to assess the Wild\n\nBrook Trout Enhancement Program as a whole to determine its efficacy. Results of the\n\nprogram evaluation indicated that the regulation was not effective at increasing the\n\nnumber of adult (>4 inches) or legal size (>7 inches) wild Brook Trout. As a result, staff\n\nrecommended that the wild Brook Trout enhancement regulations be eliminated, and the\n\nBoard approved this action at the July 2015 Commission meeting. Staff also indicated\n\nthat a subset of the streams managed under the wild Brook Trout enhancement\n\nregulations might be moved to another existing special regulation if the data supported\n\nthis management change.\n\nDuring the review of the Wild Brook Trout Enhancement Program, staff noted that the\n\nupper Kettle Creek basin streams seemed to respond differently than the other streams\n\nincluded in the study. Staff worked with the Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife\n\nResearch Unit to analyze the data on an individual stream basis to determine if this was\n\nthe case. Results indicated that five of the seven sample sites located on upper Kettle\n\nCreek and four of its tributaries had a significant increase in the number of legal-size\n\nBrook Trout. These were the only streams managed under the wild Brook Trout\n\nenhancement regulations that showed a significant increase. The upper Kettle Creek\n\nwatershed is the largest stronghold for Brook Trout in Pennsylvania, is a destination\n\nfishery for anglers, and was the largest system included in the study. These factors may\n\nhelp to explain why this system responded differently than the other waters in the\n\nprogram.\n\nBased on the final data review and the ecological importance of the upper Kettle Creek\n\nwatershed, staff recommend that the upper Kettle Creek basin from the headwaters of\n\nKettle Creek downstream to the confluence with Long Run, including Long Run and all\n\ntributaries upstream to the headwaters, be designated as catch and release all-tackle under\n\n58 Pa. Code § 65.15. Staff plan to continue monitoring the wild Brook Trout populations\n\nin this watershed.\n\nA notice of proposed designation was published at 45 Pa. B. 7072 (December 12, 2015)\n\n(Exhibit I). The Commission received a total of 12 public comments regarding the\n\nproposed designation – four prior to and eight during the formal comment period. Eight\n\nof the comments support the proposal; two prefer catch and release artificial lures only;\n\none prefers catch and release fly-fishing only; and one supports single barbless hooks.\n\nCopies of all public comments were provided to the Commissioners.\n\nFrom the Minutes from the 117th Meeting of the PFBC held on January 21, 2016:\n\nVolume 67 Page 20\n\nJanuary 21, 2016\n\nDESIGNATIONS\n\nC.
