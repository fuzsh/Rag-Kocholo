        "text": "Mifflin County Stream Information\n\nTea Creek’s headwaters lie in Rothrock State Forest. A few miles downstream from the state forest boundary, the stream reemerges as a limestone spring creek and a Class A brown trout stream. This stream, with its rich alkaline waters and near 54-degree water year-round, boasts excellent numbers of wild brown trout. The stream also holds a fantastic early season BWO hatch, which begins in March. Otherwise, scuds and cressbugs are typically reliable patterns that often produce fish here.\n\nAccess: Tea Creek is easily accessible at Mifflin County Youth Park, Reedsville.\n\nHoney Creek, a premier, Class A midsized wild brown trout fishery, emerges from a cave where it flows to its confluence with Kishacoquillas Creek. Honey Creek, similar to the nearby and world-renowned Penns Creek, is often described as a scaled down version of its more famous, larger twin. Natural food sources include BWOs, sulphurs, grannoms and terrestrials. Spring is the best time to fish Honey Creek, although the stream fishes well most of the year. Typical patterns like pheasant tails and hare’s ear nymphs work well most of the year, while patterns such as green weenies fish well in the midsummer months. Stream temperatures can sometimes get a little warm during a hot, dry summer, so a stream thermometer is a good tool to have.\n\nAccess: Honey Creek has two public parks, Bender Park, located in Reedsville and Reedsville Community Playground.\n\nKishacoquillas Creek is a large, limestone-influenced stream and is Class A brown trout waterway. The stream is heavily stocked with rainbow trout and brown trout in its lower reaches. The best fishing occurs from where Honey Creek meets Kish, nearly doubling the stream volume. Kish Creek is known for blizzard-like hatches of grannoms caddis, excellent BWO hatches, and a good sulphur hatch in May. The green weenie is also a very effective fly on Kish Creek in midsummer. Mann’s Narrows, between Reedsville and Yeagertown, can be dangerous when waters are high.\n\nAccess:-In Reedsville, heading towards Yeagertown on Main Street, go over the bridge to the gravel pull-off. The gravel trail takes you to the most popular section.\n\n-In Yeagertown, head to the baseball field at the end of Meadowfield Drive.\n\n-Kish Park (formerly Derry Township Community Park). Campsites available.\n\n-Lewistown Rec Park. Public parking.\n\nEast Licking Creek is a mountain freestone stream that contains wild, native brook trout and is stocked by the PBFC. East Licking Creek also has a sizable stretch of “delayed harvest, artificial lures only” section that ensures that plenty of fish remain long after the trout season opener. This creek fishes best in the spring and can get very low in summer. Spinners, live bait, and simple flies such as elk hair caddis, San Juan worms, green weenies, and woolly buggers are all effective.\n\nAccess: This stream is easily accessed as the best water lies all within Tuscarora State Forest. Licking Creek Drive parallels the stream allowing for miles of accessible water.\n\nJuniata County Stream Information\n\nBlacklog Creek is a 28.5-mile freestone tributary of Aughwick Creek. It rises in the Tuscarora State Forest and flows southwest between Blacklog Mountain and Shade Mountain. It is stocked with rainbow, brook and brown trout. Natural food sources include crayfish, minnows, all stages of select mayflies and caddis flies.\n\nCocolamus Creek is a 22.1-mile freestone tributary of the Juniata River. It begins east Cocolamus and meets the river just below Millerstown in Perry County. It is stocked with rainbow, brook and brown trout. The Cocolamus is also home to many native species such as smallmouth bass, rock bass, sunfish, the occasional chain pickerel, fall fish, suckers and a few carp. Natural food sources include crayfish, sculpins, minnows, helgrammites, all stages of select mayflies, caddis flies and stone flies.\n\nDelaware Creek is a 6-mile-limestone and freestone tributary of the Juniata River. It begins west of East Salem and flows south where it joins the river in Thompsontown. This is a small stream that is home to both wild brown trout and native brook trout populations, and is a stocked trout stream, with rainbow, brook and brown trout. Smallmouth bass can be found in the lower end from Thompsontown down to the mouth. Natural food sources include crayfish, minnows, all stages of select mayflies and caddis flies.\n\nLost Creek is a 17.5-mile freestone tributary of the Juniata River. Designated as a Class A wild trout stream from where it rises just inside of the Snyder County line and flows to Oakland Mills, this northeastern section supports a population of wild (natural reproduction) trout of sufficient size and abundance. From Oakland Mills to the river, it is designated as a stocked trout stream, with rainbow, brook and brown trout. Natural food sources include crayfish, sculpins, minnows, all stages of select mayflies, caddis flies and stone flies.\n\nSpectacle Run is a 4-mile branch of East Licking Creek that flows east along Shade Mountain. Designated as a Class A trout stream, it is home to native brook trout. A few wild brown trout can be found closer to where it branches off from East Licking Creek. Natural food sources include minnows, all stages of select mayflies and caddis flies.\n\nTuscarora Creek is a 49.2-mile limestone and freestone tributary of the Juniata River. It flows between Tuscarora Mountain and Shade Mountain where it eventually meets the river in Port Royal.

Native species include sunfish, fall fish, suckers, and smallmouth bass. Natural food sources include crayfish, sculpins, minnows, helgrammites, all stages of select mayflies, stone flies and caddis flies.\n\nAccess – The better access points for all streams across Juniata County will be at most bridges that provide ample and safe pull-off areas, as well as other safe areas along roads that parallel a particular stream. Seek permission from landowners before parking on or traversing any private property."
