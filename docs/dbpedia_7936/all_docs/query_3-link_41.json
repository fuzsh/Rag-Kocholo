        "text": "The Venango Conservation District announces funding opportunity for landowners in Venango County to manage invasive species through new pilot program.\n\nThe Venango Conservation District, in cooperation with local partners, established an invasive species management cost-share program to manage invasive species throughout Venango County. Known as the Venango County Partnerships for Regional Invasive Species Management (PRISM), the grant program seeks to fund projects that manage terrestrial and/or aquatic invasive species in Venango County.\n\nSpecies of plants, animals, insects, and pathogens that do not naturally occur in a defined area and cause harm to the economy, the environment, or human health are considered invasive. Examples include Multiflora Rose, Spotted Lanternfly, and Zebra Mussels. After becoming established in an area, invasive species outcompete native species for food and space and can cause property or agricultural damage.\n\nAny landowner including private individuals, municipalities, non-profits, and educational institutions with property located in Venango County are eligible to apply for up to $7,000 per project. A 50:50 match is required (either cash or in-kind). Applications are currently being accepted by the Venango Conservation District until September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Venango County PRISM program is part of a larger pilot program created by the Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts (PACD) and partners from the PA Governor’s Invasive Species Council. After receiving a $210,000 grant from the USDA Forest Service, PACD offered the PRISM pilot program to 13 counties in northwest Pennsylvania. The program will “address the critical need to manage invasive species that threaten Pennsylvania’s economy, environment, and human and animal health by developing strong, diverse stakeholder partnerships,” according to PACD.\n\nInterested applicants can find more information including the application form on the Venango Conservation District’s website. For questions or to discuss a potential project, please contact Bailey Kozalla of the Venango Conservation District by calling 814-676-2832 or emailing [email protected].\n\nFinancial and other support for the PRISM Pilot Program in NW Pennsylvania is provided by the Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts, Inc. through a Landscape Scale Restoration Grant with the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.\n\nThe Venango Conservation District, located at 4871 US 322, Franklin, PA 16323, is accepting proposals for a contract to construct approximately 100 feet of stream-bank stabilization and fish habitat in-stream structures in Cherrytree Run located on Sportsman Lane (41.497706, -79.70034) within Cornplanter Township in Venango County, Pennsylvania. The Cherrytree Run Fish Habitat Improvement Project will address an urgent environmental need to stabilize eroding stream banks as well as create standard fish habitat structures. The scope of this project consists of 100’ of stream bank in which 1 modified mudsill structure will consist of four 20 feet long sections.\n\nThis process is an open call for qualified contractors.\n\nThe Venango Conservation District is a tax-exempt organization. Proposal prices should be calculated without applicable sales tax.\n\nA pre-bid meeting will be held at the project site on Friday, July 12, 2024 beginning at 10:00 a.m. Meeting location will be at 41.497584, -79.700361 on pull off onsite on Sportsman Lane located directly off of Rt. 8. Please contact Bailey Kozalla by calling 814-676-2832 ext. 2 or emailing [email protected] to RSVP for this meeting by 4:00 p.m. on July 11, 2024. Contractor representative attendance at the bid meeting is required for the submission of a successful bid for the project.\n\nAll construction activities for this project will be subject to the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act of 1961. Prevailing wage rates determinations from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry for this project are attached.\n\nSealed proposals must be received by the Venango Conservation District by 3:00 pm on July 26, 2024. Proposals may be sent via email in pdf format to Bailey Kozalla:\n\nBailey Kozalla\n\nWatershed Specialist\n\nVenango Conservation District\n\n4871 US 322\n\nFranklin, PA 16323\n\n(814) 676-2832 ext. 2\n\n[email protected]\n\nRequest for Proposals WORDFile Size: 3466 kbFile Type: docx\n\nDownload File\n\nRequest for Proposals PDFFile Size: 652 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\nRFP Attachments PDFFile Size: 652 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\nRecognized by both the Pennsylvania State House and Senate, April 28th through May 4th 2024 Pennsylvania will be celebrating Conservation District week across the state. Pennsylvania state legislators recognize the need to support grass-roots conservation efforts in 2945 and passed the Conservation District Law which Conservation Districts. Every county except Philadelphia has a Conservation District office. We thank Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Scott Hutchinson and Representative R. Lee James for their support of Conservation Districts in the Pennsylvania Budget.\n\nThe Venango Conservation District (VCD) was established in 1961. Over the years our board of directors and staff have worked hard to provide natural resource conservation services through many stewardship programs. In the beginning, the board of directors worked with farmers to review and approve conservation plans. Our first staff member was a “Gypsy Moth” Program Technician. They administered the program to help landowners manage infestations of the invasive species. Over the years the Venango Conservation District has administered the DEP Chapters 102 and 105 Permitting programs, the West Nile Virus program the Watershed Specialist program, the Dirt Gravel and Low Volume Roads program, the Chapter 38 Nutrient Management and Chapter 91 Manure Management Program and many environmental education initiatives.\n\nThis week, the Venango Conservation District celebrates our accomplishments in the past year. We welcomed new staff members to the Chapters 102 and 105 Permitting programs, the Dirt Gravel and Low Volume Road program, the Watershed Specialist position and Administrative Secretary position. We completed projects that constructed Agricultural Best Management Practices on three operations in Venango County. We provided funding and technical assistance to six municipalities to construct practices to build better roadways that reduce sediment pollution to local streams. We assisted landowners with permitting for earth disturbance at construction projects. We provided several educational events to promote natural resource conservation awareness to both youth and adult audiences.\n\n​\n\nIn 2024, we will continue to provide technical assistance, education and funding to support landowners in Venango County with their natural resource conservation needs.

And for the kids who didn’t grow up with it, it’s a chance for them to get exposed to it.”\n\nThe competition originated in Pennsylvania in 1979 in the Fulton, Luzerne and Schuylkill conservation districts, then called “Envirolympics,” and Envirothon has since spread across the state and to more than 45 states, eight Canadian provinces and territories, and two Chinese provinces.\n\nVenango County has been participating for decades.\n\n“Bailey’s done a really good job building back Envirothon back up after COVID,” said Conservation District manager Lisette Lane. “It lost quite a bit of interest during COVID.”\n\nConfidence, study time and results varied from team to team on Friday, but there was one thing everyone had in common. When asked by Kozalla prior to the awards ceremony whether they had a good time, a resounding “Yeah!” came from the assembled students in the park office.\n\n“It’s fun, very fun,” said senior Hailey Gunnery, a member of Rocky Grove’s Leap Frogs team. “I love being able to be outside, learning about all of the nature stuff and issues facing the world, and being with friends.”"
