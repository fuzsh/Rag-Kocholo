        "text": "Fishing in State Parks and Forests\n\nPennsylvania’s wealth of freshwater produces outstanding fishing opportunities for every level of interest.\n\nThere are 85,000 miles of rivers and streams, and thousands of lakes and ponds in Pennsylvania. Much of this abundant freshwater wealth is found within our state parks and state forests -- 101 state parks and 20 state forests are open to fishing.\n\nA wide variety of popular fish species inhabit the waters of our parks and forests. Pristine streams and cold creeks are home to native brook trout and stocked rainbow and brown trout.\n\nMeandering rivers team with smallmouth bass, catfish, and pike. Largemouth bass, bluegills, and yellow perch populate the calmer waters of lakes and ponds.\n\nFishing in Pennsylvania State Parks\n\nPennsylvania state parks provide almost unlimited opportunities for fishing and boating fun.\n\nPennsylvania has giant lakes like Pymatuning -- at 17,000 acres -- down to small ponds set aside for children and ADA accessible fishing only.\n\nYou also can fish in the Susquehanna or the Delaware rivers, and other major and minor rivers, as well as those small bodies of water called anything from streams, creeks, licks, and runs.\n\nMany state parks open to fishing also have lodging available including yurts, lodges, houses, modern cabins, and rustic cabins. Year-round or seasonal camping is also available at 60 parks.\n\nReservations for state park lodging can be made online or by calling 1-888-PA-PARKS (1-888-727-2757).\n\nFishing Tackle Loaner Program in State Parks\n\nThrough a partnership with the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the American Sportfishing Association, and DCNR, the public can borrow fishing rods, reels, and an equipped tackle box to try fishing while at certain parks.\n\nHow can you be prepared?\n\nA valid ID must be provided by at least one adult in the group.\n\nEquipment is loaned on a first-come-first-served basis and can only be used within the park.\n\nPark staff may be available to give brief instructions upon request.\n\nAll equipment must be returned at the agreed-upon place and by the agreed-upon time.\n\nGear will be supplied, but bring your own bait with you.\n\nThose 16 years or older need to have a valid Pennsylvania Fishing License.\n\nKnow what you can and can’t keep. All fishing regulations must be followed.\n\nWhether you are giving fishing a try for the first time, or returning to a childhood activity, these state parks provide free tackle for loan:\n\nState Parks with Fishing Tackle Loaner Programs​ ​ ​ Bald Eagle​ Bendigo ​Black Moshannon​Chapman​Clear Creek​Colonel Denning​Cook Forest​Frances Slocum​French Creek​Gifford Pinchot ​Hills Creek​Kettle Creek ​Lackawanna​Little Buffalo​Locust Lake ​Lyman Run M.K.

Winter Raccoon Creek Reeds Gap​Ricketts Glen​Ryerson Station​Tobyhanna​Tuscarora​Tyler ​Yellow Creek​​\n\nContact the participating state park office for information on availability and how to loan equipment.\n\nIce Fishing in State Parks\n\nPennsylvania state parks have many lakes for you to find the ice fishing hole for you. Most state parks with fishing also permit ice fishing.\n\nState Parks Winter Report\n\nFind out where to go with the state park’s weekly State Parks Winter Report, online from mid-December until spring thaw.\n\nIce Fishing Safety Tips:\n\nTest ice thickness with an auger before fishing. Four inches of solid ice is the minimum recommended thickness for a single angler. Seven inches of solid ice is the minimum recommended thickness for small groups of anglers.\n\nSpread out. Crowds can put too much weight onto one area.\n\nBe aware of changes in ice thickness across a body of water. Perimeter ice is weaker due to shifting, expansion and sunlight reflecting off of the bottom.\n\nAvoid areas with protruding logs, brush, plants, and docks. These structures absorb heat, weakening the surrounding ice.\n\nAvoid areas with multiple or intersecting cracks, and standing water over ice.\n\nUse extra caution on rivers and streams where ice can appear thicker than it really is. Moving water erodes ice from below the surface.\n\nVenturing out on ice alone is not advisable. Take a friend along for fun and for safety.\n\nWear a PFD (life jacket).\n\nAlways carry safety equipment and know how to use it.\n\nCheck the weather and plan accordingly. Several days with temperatures above freezing will weaken the ice.\n\nNight Fishing in State Parks\n\nNighttime fishing, whether from a boat on from the shoreline, is a popular pastime. Pennsylvania State Parks provides great opportunities for this recreational activity.\n\nNight fishing is generally permitted in areas designated for fishing and non-whitewater boating. However, persons who plan on fishing at night from the shoreline can first contact the park office to determine which locations are open to this activity.\n\nFishing with a Float Tube in State Parks\n\nFloat tubes, also known as a belly boats or kick boats, continue to rise in popularity. Quality float tubes are permitted while fishing in state park lakes and still waters, away from designated swimming and boat launching areas.\n\nA quality U-shaped, V-shaped, or round float tube is constructed of high quality, durable materials with one or more inflatable bladders inside a sewn cover.\n\nFloat tubes may only be propelled by non-mechanical, non-motorized devices like oars. A U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device must be worn at all times. No launch permit is required.\n\nA state park officer can terminate float tube use if the device does not conform with material quality requirements, is being used in an unsafe manner, or is used during unsafe conditions.\n\nADA Access for Fishing in State Parks\n\nThis activity or structure is ADA accessible.\n\nSome state parks have fishing piers to accommodate people with disabilities. The DCNR interactive map for Where to Fish shows what fishing facilities are accessible for people with disabilities.\n\nIf you need an accommodation to participate in park activities due to a disability, please contact the park you plan to visit."
