        "text": "A slate of habitat projects focusing on the restoration of forest and freshwater habitats, including several in Pennsylvania, have been launched with $1.5 million in grants from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Central Appalachia Habitat Stewardship Program.\n\nThe grants, with others awarded for projects in Virginia and West Virginia, “will improve habitat for some of the region’s most iconic species, including eastern brook trout, hellbender and wood thrush,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director of NFWF.\n\nMore best waters found across Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission adds to its growing lists of wild trout streams.\n\n“When we are making management decisions to keep our forests and landscapes resilient and rich with a diversity of species, it’s important to have good science,” Pennsylvania DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn said. “We appreciate these NFWF grants to our partners in Pennsylvania as we work together toward that goal.”\n\nThe projects will enable more than 400 different landowners to improve management on more than 3,100 acres of public and private forests, and restore 10 miles of streamside forest, open up more than 25 miles of upstream habitat to fish, reintroduce 100,000 freshwater mussels and create nesting habitat for the eastern hellbender.\n\nHellbenders found in a new Pennsylvania water\n\nA crew working on stream stabilization discovered a new population of snot otters in an unnamed Pennsylvania waterway.\n\nPennsylvania projects are:\n\nRestoring large forest blocks in state parks for key bird species in the Laurel Highlands, Indiana University of Pennsylvania Research Institute, $199,896. The project will restore multiple forest age classes and habitat complexity for key bird species in large forest blocks in two state parks in the Laurel Highlands that serve as anchors in a network of forested lands in the region. The focal birds are the golden-winged warbler, cerulean warbler and wood thrush.\n\nAssessing eastern brook trout patches to determine future actions that improve connectivity, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, $186,863. The project will assess the population status and habitat condition within previously identified eastern brook population patches in the Mid-Upper Allegheny River and Pennsylvania Wilds to determine the most appropriate restoration actions to improve aquatic connectivity. At least five patches will be assessed by completing 100 electrofishing surveys, at least two priority patches will be reconnected through culvert replacement and 1.5 miles of forested riparian buffer will be restored to reduce sedimentation.\n\nRestoring dynamic forest structure to improve wildlife habitat for birds in the Pennsylvania Wilds, American Bird Conservancy, $175,000. The project will use timber harvests and non-commercial methods to create or enhance 450 acres of young forest habitat, 500 acres of mature forest habitat and 400 acres of late successional habitat to support the entire reproductive cycle of the golden- winged warbler, cerulean warbler and wood thrush.\n\nAdvancing conservation-based estate planning with private forest landowners, Pennsylvania State University, $79,987. The project will develop and offer a targeted workshop series to increase awareness and implementation of evolving legal and financial tools to achieve conservation-based estate planning in Pennsylvania among estate planning attorneys, financial planners and consulting foresters.\n\nImplementing a landscape-scale approach to managing private forestlands for birds and resilience, National Audubon Society, $183,419. The project will implement landscape-scale forest conservation to benefit forest birds on private lands in Pennsylvania through financial incentives provided by the American Forest Foundation’s Family Forest Carbon Program. The goal will be to restore 900 acres of mature forest habitat for wood thrush and 225 acres of late successional forest habitat for cerulean warblers, and enroll 20 landowners in habitat management on their lands that will also facilitate carbon sequestration.\n\nTesting a methodology for monitoring eastern brook trout restoration response in the Cross Fork Watershed, Trout Unlimited, $139,987. The project will develop a methodology and conduct eastern brook trout population response monitoring in the Cross Fork Creek watershed, the largest drainage in the Kettle Creek watershed. The methodology, which will be suitable for replication range-wide, will replace one culvert, opening 8.5 miles of previously inaccessible stream habitat; improve 1,500 feet of dirt and gravel road to reduce sedimentation; and improve water quality, and then will monitor brook trout population response.\n\nThe Central Appalachia Habitat Stewardship Program was established in 2017 and to date has awarded 35 grants totaling more than $4.7 million.\n\nThanks for visiting PennLive.
