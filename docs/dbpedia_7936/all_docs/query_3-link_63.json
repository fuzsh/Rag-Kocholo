        "text": "About 4 million trout are being placed in waterways across the state and there are a few things you need to know before you try to catch some of them.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has started stocking about 3.2 million trout across 697 streams and 129 lakes across the state in anticipation of the season opening April 6.\n\nIn addition to trout raised at state fish hatcheries, PFBC cooperative nurseries operated by sportsmen's clubs and other groups across the state will add another one million trout to waters open to public angling throughout the year.\n\nWho needs a license to fish in Pennsylvania?\n\nAnglers 16 years of age or older must possess a valid Pennsylvania fishing license. The cost for a resident fishing license is $27.97 and the trout permit is $14.97.\n\nFishing licenses and permits can be purchased through the HuntFishPA online portal on the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission website, on your smartphone using the FishBoatPA mobile app or by visiting one of nearly 700 retail license issuing agents like sports shops and county treasurer offices.\n\nTrout permits\n\nA current Pennsylvania trout permit is required to fish for trout in Pennsylvania waters. An angler “fishes for trout” when the angler: Takes, kills or possesses, while in the act of fishing, a trout from any Pennsylvania or boundary waters; fishes in waters under special trout regulations; fishes in any Class A Wild Trout Waters or Wilderness Trout Streams or their tributaries, and fishes in streams and rivers designated as stocked trout waters.\n\nVoluntary permits\n\nCustomers who purchase a 2024 fishing license can once again support their favorite PFBC programs through the purchase of voluntary permits for bass, musky, wild trout/enhanced waters, and habitat/waterways conservation. These permits are not required for fishing and carry no additional privileges, but all funds generated through them are reinvested into their respective program. The agency has been able to invest more than $620,000 into special projects funded by the sale of voluntary permits since 2019.\n\nWhen is the first day of trout season in Pennsylvania?\n\nThere are several important dates for trout anglers this year:\n\nMarch 30 – Statewide Mentored Youth Trout Day 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.\n\nApril 6 – Statewide Opening Day of Trout Season at 8 a.m., creel limit of five trout that are at least seven inches long.\n\nSept. 3 – Extended trout season begins with a creel limit of three.\n\nNov. 1 through April 30 – Mandatory Life Jacket Requirement in effect for boats under 16 feet long, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards.\n\nMentored Youth Trout Day\n\nIn an effort to help more young people get involved in fishing, there’s a mentored youth day held before the official start of fishing season. This year, it’s from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on March 30.\n\nMore: Young girl talks about first ever trout, experts explain which baits to catch more fish\n\nYouth anglers must obtain a Voluntary Youth Fishing License that costs $2.97 or a free Mentored Youth Fishing Permit from the PFBC, and be accompanied by a licensed adult angler in order to participate. The angler may mentor multiple youth.\n\nThe Voluntary Youth Fishing License provides an extended return for both Pennsylvania’s youth and the Commission. For each license purchased for $2.97, the commission receives $5 back in funding as a federal reimbursement. The commission receives no federal reimbursement for free Mentored Youth Permits.\n\nAnglers 16 years of age or older must possess a valid Pennsylvania fishing license and current trout permit and be accompanied by a youth.\n\nParticipating youth may keep two trout that have a minimum length of seven inches. Adult anglers are prohibited from possessing trout this day.\n\nStocking trout: More than 4 million trout are coming to a lake or stream near you\n\nKeystone Select\n\nThere are trout waters were people can fish throughout the year. The Keystone Select Stocked Trout Waters is a program where sections of 24 streams across the state are stocked with large trout measuring 14-20 inches, and managed under Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only or Miscellaneous Special regulations. Under the program, approximately 10,000 large trout will be distributed among the streams.\n\nFish for Free Days\n\nNo fishing license is needed to fish on May 26 and July 4 on public waters in Pennsylvania. Other regulations apply.\n\nNew in 2024 for boaters\n\nWaterways conservation officers are looking for debris and plants on boats that may cross contaminate another waterway.\n\nOfficers may ask boaters to remove aquatic plants or prohibited species from a watercraft, trailer or water-related equipment before transport or before immersing in a waterway.\n\nMore: Pennsylvania fishing license fees to remain same in 2025 because of increased sales\n\nLake Erie Permit\n\nAll anglers fishing in the waters of Lake Erie, Presque Isle Bay and their tributaries, including waters that flow into those tributaries, are required to possess a valid Lake Erie permit for $9.97 or a combination trout/Lake Erie permit for $20.97.\n\nWhat types of trout are stocked in Pennsylvania?\n\nThe PFBC plans to release 2.4 million rainbow trout; 702,000 brown trout, 132,000 brook trout and 14,000 golden rainbow trout. As with past practice, the average size of the trout produced for stocking is 11 inches in length with an average weight of .58 pounds.\n\nWhile every fish is fun to catch, it’s also good to know which type of trout you caught when you tell your friends and family about your success.\n\nFortunately, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission provides the following descriptions to help anglers understand the differences:\n\nRainbow: They are known for their pink lateral stripe, dark spots and shiny scales. They have a greenish color and their tails have dark spots. The majority of stocked trout in streams and lakes in Pennsylvania are rainbows.\n\nBrown: Brown trout are more brown and gray in color. They have shiny scales but don’t have the pink stripe down their sides that is found on rainbows. Browns have dark black and red spots. The fins are clear, yellow-brown and unmarked. The belly is white-yellow.\n\nBrook: Brook trout are a darker colored fish that have red spots with bluish halos that dot the length of the body. Sometimes they have orange coloring on their lower half. Brook trout is the state’s official fish.\n\nGolden rainbow: The easiest trout to identify is the golden rainbow trout. They have a deep yellow or orange coloration and are easy to spot in shallow waterways. They are a gold-orange rainbow trout raised under artificial fish culture conditions and stocked as a novelty for angling sport. The PFBC reports the golden rainbow was developed from one fish, a single female trout with a genetic mutation that gave her a mixed golden and normal rainbow trout coloration. She was found in the West Virginia hatchery system in 1954. Through selective breeding with regularly marked Rainbow Trout, an all-gold, Golden Rainbow Trout was developed. It is a stronger hybrid species of the similar colored Palomino trout that was previously stocked in Pennsylvania.\n\nLake: Lake trout are similar to a brook trout, but have light spots across their sides and have a distinct forked tail. They are found in large waterways like Raystown Lake and Lake Erie.\n\nSteelhead: If you fish around Lake Erie, you may encounter steelhead, which is a type of rainbow trout that lives part of the year in the Great Lake. They are a more silvery colored fish that has earned the nickname “chrome” by some anglers. They can grow to more than 30 inches long. There are special regulation for fishing for trout around Lake Erie, please consult your summary guide handbook regarding Erie waterways.\n\nTiger: The Fish and Boat Commission does not raise tiger trout, which is a cross between a brook trout and a brown trout. However some are still found in waterways, including through some private stockings. They look similar to a brook trout but have wavy lines on their sides instead of spots.\n\nCatch and release\n\nIf you don’t want to keep your fish, the commission offers the following advice to give your catch the best chance for survival:\n\nUse barbless hooks.\n\nPlay fish quickly.\n\nTry to land your fish as quickly as possible, don’t play the fish to exhaustion, and use a landing net.\n\nKeep the fish in the water. The chance of a fish being injured increases the longer it is held out of water.\n\nWet your hands, net and other materials that may come in contact with the fish.\n\nHold the fish upside down while removing the hook. This can often pacify the fish and reduce handling time.\n\nRemove hooks quickly. Hemostats or long-nose pliers are essential tools for quickly removing hooks.\n\nCut the line. When it is not possible to remove the hook without harming the fish, cut the line.\n\nDon’t touch the gills. Do not handle fish by placing your fingers in the gill slits.\n\nHold the fish upright underwater after hook removal and allow it to swim away under its own power. If necessary, hold the fish out of the current until it revives.\n\nStill have questions?\n\nThis feature is not meant to include all the regulations required for anglers. For further information, consult 2024 Fishing Summary/Boating Handbook that is provided with your fishing license or the digital version that can be found on the PFBC website, or viewed on the FishBoatPA mobile app."
