        "text": "The 88 species of fish found in the French Creek Watershed represent a number of rare specimens, a wide variety of panfish and game fish prized by anglers. French Creek harbors muskellunge, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, pickerel, perch, sunfish, and bluegills. These species are found in the 117 miles of mainstem, 460 miles of major tributaries, and the watershed’s lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.\n\nTrout fishing is a popular recreational pursuit in the watershed. The West and South Branches of French Creek are annually stocked with trout, as are most of its main tributaries, including LeBoeuf Creek, Muddy Creek, Conneauttee Creek, Woodcock Creek, Cussewago Creek, Little Sugar Creek, and Sugar Creek. Wild, naturally reproducing brown trout populations are found in South Branch, a high gradient clear water creek, and in LeBoeuf Creek, a Class A trout stream.\n\nFCVC and other public groups support a number of boat launches and public properties that can aid your next fishing adventure. Users looking for access points along French Creek should visit our water trail page and explore our interactive map. Anglers should also visit the PA Fish and Boat Commission’s website to learn about regulations and find a county guide to find fishing-specific information (access, stocked streams/ lakes, hatcheries, etc)."
