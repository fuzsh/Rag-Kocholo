        "text": "Brook trout are resilient. The have thrived in the cold waters of the Appalachian mountains for several million years, and longer in areas that glaciers did not touch. In the deep in the mountain hollows protected by towering oak and pine and impenetrable rhododendron thickets, the southern Appalachian brook trout - known to be genetically distinct from its northern counterparts, is found in the tiniest of headwater tributaries, in what anglers call 'small water'. Farther north, brook trout swim in ponds, lakes, and coastal rivers, and they take on different sizes and colors in these different habitats. Scientists and managers are constantly unfolding more facets of its life history, that is - how it grows and reproduces, where it lives, what it eats, and what strategies it uses to stay alive in diverse habitats. In Maine, biologists recently discovered brook trout spawning under the cover of lake ice."
