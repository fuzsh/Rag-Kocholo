        "text": "Worms, lures, and flies beware! Pennsylvania’s wild trout streams and lakes are filled to the gills with trout! Along with the wild trout that populate PA’s streams and lakes, the Fish and Game Commission are releasing 3.2 million adult rainbow, brook, brown, and golden rainbow trout into 695 streams and 128 lakes throughout PA in time for the statewide trout season opener on Apr. 6. There will be plenty of chances to land “the big one” through the Keystone Select Stocked Trout Waters program where about 10,000 large trout, 2- to 3-years old and measuring between 14 to 20 inches will be released in select streams.\n\nSo pack your reel, order your Pennsylvania fishing license, and plan to cast your line in some of the finest PA trout waters. Never been fishing? You can test the waters during Pennsylvania’s two Fish-For-Free Days in 2024, May 26 and Jul. 4, where no fishing license is required!\n\n1. Oil Creek\n\nNearest City: Titusville and Oil City\n\nOil Creek State Park provides the best access to fishing in Oil Creek, a prime trout fishing spot with three streams providing brook trout fishing opportunities. Many anglers take advantage of the aquatic insect hatches that occur during the month of May or explore some of the creek’s tributaries, where wild brook trout make their home. Several small paths and trails lead from the park roads to the water.\n\n2. Neshannock Creek\n\nNearest City: Mercer\n\nWhile Neshannock Creek is open year-round, fishing in the 20-mile freestone stream is most rewarding during fall and spring. Neshannock Creek is heavily stocked with brown and rainbow trout, and the waters near the upper part of the creek are popular with fly fishermen.\n\n3. Slippery Rock Creek\n\nNearest City: Slippery Rock\n\nSlippery Rock Creek features trout and bass stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Originating in the town of Slippery Rock, the creek intersects McConnells Mill State Park. This is where anglers can access trails leading to stretches of trout-filled waters.\n\n4. Youghiogheny River\n\nNearest City: Ohiopyle\n\nThe Youghiogheny River, located adjacent to the Great Allegheny Passage, rewards hikers and bikers (the non-motorized kind) traveling the trail with fantastic PA trout fishing opportunities. Accessible from Ohiopyle State Park, the Middle Youghiogheny supplies tamer fishing waters, while the Lower Youghiogheny’s more turbulent waters are best explored with a professional fishing guide, who can lead you to hefty brown and rainbow trout.\n\n5. Cedar Run\n\nNearest City: Cedar Run\n\nBoasting a population of wild brown trout, Cedar Run is another tributary of Pine Creek. The “fine little trout stream,” much of which flows through Tioga State Forest, offers a tranquil fishing experience sheltered by pine and hardwood trees and a designated trophy trout area.\n\n6. Slate Run\n\nNearest City: Slate Run\n\nA tributary of Pine Creek, anglers love Slate Run’s fly-fishing opportunities. This Class A wild trout stream supports an abundance of wild brooks (“brookies”) and brown trout and features lovely pools, runs, and riffles. With horizontal shale beds lining the stream’s banks, it’s easy to see how the stream got its name.\n\n7. Fishing Creek\n\nNearest City: Bloomsburg\n\nThis creek truly lives up to its name. With numerous deep pools and excellent runs, Fishing Creek is considered one of the finest spots for anglers searching for trout. The special regulations section of the creek is only one and a half miles long, but still offers outstanding fishing. The creek also offers great trout fishing in the winter months with holdover trout that roam the deep pools.\n\n8. Spring Creek\n\nNearest City: State College\n\nHoping to land a monster trout? Spring Creek is where your fish tale might come true! With plenty of 16- to 20-inch long fish, this wild trout fishery is an anglers’ dream due to its combination of wild browns and some great insect hatches. Spring Creek is full of pristine fishing hot spots including such popular destinations as Fisherman’s Paradise, and many other areas that offer solitude and lots of wild and aggressive fish.\n\n9. Letort Spring Run\n\nNearest City: Carlisle\n\nFishermen and those less inclined to pick up a pole can all enjoy the scenic Letort Spring Run and its nature trail. The fertile limestone spring creek near Carlisle has a wide variety of aquatic vegetation in its waters, is bordered by lush trees and bushes, and has calm, clear waters perfect for fly fishing. Advice for less-skilled anglers: a few poor casts can scare trout away from areas for the rest of the day, so hone your tactics before hitting this fishing hole.\n\n10. Monocacy Creek\n\nNearest City: Bethlehem\n\nMost trout in Monocacy Creek are at least 12 inches in length, but there is always a chance of getting lucky with a 10- to 12-pound rainbow. For the seasoned anglers looking for a challenge, the wild browns that roam the creek are no easy task to pull in. With great fishing offered year-round, the Monocacy is a great place to come with a spinner rod or fly gear.\n\n11. Wissahickon Creek\n\nNearest City: Philadelphia\n\nLocated in Philadelphia’s Fairmount Park, the 23-mile Wissahickon Creek is fully stocked with trout each spring. An excellent local excursion for the nature lover, you can explore the creek’s surrounding woodlands via hiking and biking paths and try your skills at fishing in its deep pools, fast riffles, and tumbling water pockets.\n\nTo learn about additional fishing destinations in Pennsylvania, check out the VISIT PA website.
