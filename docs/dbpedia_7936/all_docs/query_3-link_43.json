        "text": "Today we dive into fishery science and conservation with James Suleski of the Pennsylvania Native Fish Coalition. James is on a mission to bridge the gap between anglers and fisheries scientists.\n\nWe explore the challenges faced by native brook trout, like climate change and the impact of invasive brown trout. Tune in to learn more about the strategies, misconceptions, and hopes for protecting these species.\n\nNative Fish Coalition with James Suleski.

One such approach is stopping the stocking invasive trout, which has shown promise in small streams.\n\n47:00 – James highlights Dr. Shannon White’s research on brook trout, which challenged the previously held belief that brook trout are sedentary.\n\n58:00 – According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, roughly a third of freshwater fish are at risk of extinction.\n\n1:00:00 – Native Fish Coalition’s strategy involves educating the public, encouraging them to reach out to legislators for stocking reforms, and fostering dialogue to promote responsible conservation practices.\n\nVisit their website at NativeFishCoalition.org\n\nRelated Podcast Episodes\n\nWFS 446 – Maine Fly Guys with Greg LaBonte – Musky, Brook Trout, In the Film Podcast\n\nRead the Full Podcast Transcript Below\n\nNative Fish Coalition Conclusion with James Suleski\n\nWe gained insights into the challenges and opportunities surrounding native fish conservation. Reaching out to your local fisheries managers and engaging in discussions can make a big difference in preserving our aquatic treasures."
