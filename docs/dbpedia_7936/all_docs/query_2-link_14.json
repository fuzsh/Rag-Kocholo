        "text": "This is not the only upland burrowing crayfish species, so some of our ecologists call these the Orange Burrowing Crayfish, because no other Pennsylvania species are orange like this. Rarely seen on the surface, they emerge at night or during rain, when the air is very humid, and forage for leaves and small animals. They especially like worms. They often sit at the mouth of their burrow at night, waiting for prey to wander past. The mothers provide extended parental care, sharing burrows with offspring, providing food and protection.\n\nIndicates: Clay and silty soils; generally found in or near wetlands\n\nFound In: Where the groundwater is close to the surface (not necessarily near surface water). They burrow into the groundwater, leaving chimneys, or piles of mud pellets, or blops of mud on the surface, depending on the moisture and clay content of the soil. They are somewhat tolerant of disturbance (For example, can sometimes be found in roadside ditches.) and need clean groundwater.\n\nTheir range is limited to Fayette and Somerset counties, including Bear Run Nature Reserve, and parts of adjacent West Virginia. The range also includes one county in Maryland, and there is one record in Westmoreland County.\n\nThe frosted elfin is a small brownish-gray butterfly with tiny tails and silvery scales on the hindwings that give it a frosted appearance. The relationship between a frosted elfin butterfly and its host plants, wild indigo and wild lupine, is an excellent example of how a host plant indicates a habitat for a specific pollinator. It is important to know how to make the habitat more suitable for the host plant, which is better for the butterfly. If the plant is not there, the butterfly won’t be there.\n\nIndicates: Barrens and open, dry habitats that support their host species\n\nFound in: Pine barrens, a rare habitat type characterized by fire-dependent conifers, scrub oak and grassy openings that support wild indigo and wild blue lupine\n\nThese carnivorous Pennsylvania native plants, found in bogs and mossy swamps, have leaves shaped like pitchers or tubes, edged with a nectar to attract insects. Insects land on the edge of the tube and fall into the trap, where hairs inside prevent escape. The insect is digested by enzymes in the plant.\n\nIndicates: High quality habitats. Peatlands and bogs, where pitcher plants grow, regulate streamflow and groundwater recharge, protecting water quality. Home to many rare plants, bird and insects, they store large amounts of carbon, which mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nFound in: Sphagnum bogs and other acidic wetlands\n\nGrowing to half inch to two inches long, fairy shrimp have 11 pairs of leg-like appendages called phyllopods used for swimming belly-side up. Wood frogs and salamanders such as spotted, Jefferson and marbled, are all vernal pool indicators, as are the delicate fairy shrimp.\n\nVarious insects, crustaceans, amphibians and other invertebrates that need water early in their lifecycles live in vernal pools, free from predation from fish, which could not survive in vernal pool conditions. Vernal pool species can survive low oxygen levels and drying out completely in summer, and fare well in stagnant water – all conditions that fish cannot tolerate.\n\nIndicates: Vernal pool habitat\n\nFound in: Vernal pools, which are shallow depressions on land, usually surrounded by trees, that temporarily fill with snow melt and rainwater and only appear in the spring and fall.\n\nINVASIVE SPECIES\n\nInvasive species can also be indicator species. For example, their presence can indicate invaded habitat that is ecologically degraded. They can be evidence of increased human-caused disturbance.\n\nAreas where these species invade likely were once pristine in their native species diversity and ecological functioning. However, introducing these and other invasive species, whether accidentally or purposefully, can cause rapid and often negative change. In some cases, invasive species can “blend in” with their surroundings, going unnoticed by passersby who might not know their true identity.\n\nEducation and awareness--coupled with vigilant searching--can allow natural resource professionals and community scientists to better understand invasive species distributions and inform land managers of areas where treatment should be prioritized.\n\nAn ornamental shrub historically used in living fences for livestock and for herbal medicine, the invasive Japanese barberry was imported into the United States in 1875.\n\nJapanese barberry has oval-shaped leaves that are often red-tinged. Compact and dense, it rarely exceeds four feet in height. Interestingly, it will root where its drooping branches touch the ground, a process called layering. In mid-spring to early summer, drooping clusters of pale yellow flowers develop, turning into bright red berries.\n\nIndicates: Large patches or monocultures of Japanese barberry can indicate an invaded habitat that has been ecologically degraded. Its presence in natural areas can harm spring-time tourism due to its ability to displace and outcompete spring ephemeral wildflowers that many people will travel far to observe in bloom.\n\nThe presence of Japanese barberry in natural areas warrants management, which can come with high economic costs in terms of manpower, time, equipment and herbicide. Effective control efforts can prevent Japanese barberry from altering important ecosystems and displacing native plants that are important to pollinators.\n\nFound In: Barberry is shade tolerant, drought resistant and adaptable to a variety of wooded habitats, wetlands and disturbed areas. Due to its popularity in the nursery trade, Japanese barberry can often be found growing in residential and commercial areas.\n\nSome information sourced from the DCNR fact sheet for Japanese and European Barberry and Penn State Extension’s Japanese Barberry factsheet.\n\nThe bright yellow flowers of lesser celandine bloom in early spring, rising above their green, kidney-shaped leaves.Abundant, finger-like tubers are produced by the plant's roots and are only visible if dug out of the ground.This aggressive perennial plant emerges earlier than most native species and can easily displace native spring ephemerals with its thick carpet of vegetation. This in turn negatively affects native pollinators, which rely on spring ephemerals for nectar and pollen during a time when other food sources are scarce.\n\nIndicates: Monocultures of lesser celandine indicate an invaded habitat that has been ecologically degraded. Its presence in natural areas can harm spring-time eco-tourism from lesser celandine’s ability to displace and outcompete spring ephemeral wildflowers that many people will travel far to observe in bloom.\n\nThe presence of lesser celandine in natural areas warrants management, which can come with high economic costs in terms of manpower, time, equipment and herbicide. Effective control efforts can prevent lesser celandine from altering important ecosystems and displacing native plants that are important to pollinators.\n\nFound In: Forested floodplains, woods, meadows, roadsides and waste places. Lesser celandine seems to prefer moist, sandy soils. Less frequently, it will invade drier soils.\n\nSome information sourced from the DCNR fact sheet for Lesser celandine.\n\nHydrilla, a submerged aquatic plant, can grow in water as deep as 20 to 40 feet. Its green leaves are whorled in bunches of 3 to 8 (most often five) and its stems are long and branching. Its leaves have small sharp teeth on the edges and sometimes have spines on the midvein, which make the plant feel rough to the touch. During the late growing season, small white tubers form on the plant roots. They are used for food storage and allow the plant to over-winter.\n\nIndicates: Monocultures of hydrilla indicate an invaded habitat that is has been ecologically degraded. Its presence in both large and small waterbodies can hinder biodiversity and limit aquatic recreation including fishing, swimming and boating. Propeller boats can easily become clogged by hydrilla’s thick floating mats, requiring frequent cleanings to travel short distances.\n\nThe presence of hydrilla in natural areas warrants management, which can come with high economic costs in terms of manpower, time, equipment, and herbicide. Effective control efforts such as those occurring at Pymatuning Reservoir (Crawford County), Raystown Lake (Huntingdon County) and Harvey’s Lake (Luzerne County) can prevent hydrilla from altering important ecosystems and displacing native species.\n\n*Note: Management efforts occurring at the aforementioned locations are being led by various state agencies and organizations.\n\nFound In: Freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, impoundments and canals.\n\nSome information sourced from PA DCNR and PA Sea Grant."
