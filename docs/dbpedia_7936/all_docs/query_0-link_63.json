        "text": "A very special live presentation on Pennsylvania’s native Brook Trout will be given on Tuesday, September 27th, at 7:00 pm at the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission building, located on Elmerton Avenue in Harrisburg. This presentation is free and open to the public, appropriate for all age groups. It is sponsored by the Doc Fritchey chapter of Trout Unlimited.\n\nDr. James Suleski, a TU chapter Board Member, will be the guest speaker for the evening. Dr. Suleski has been studying the habits and habitat of our Pennsylvania brookies for several years, and his passion for the protection and preservation of this trout species is well known.\n\nHe has pursued the brookie tirelessly, not to catch it, but to learn more about it, so that we can better understand how to provide for its continued survival. And now he wants to share his material with all of us so that we can come to a greater appreciation for our state gamefish.\n\nDr. Suleski has been a guest on multiple podcasts and worked with many conservationists to spread the knowledge of brook trout preservation. We invite everyone to attend this special evening!"
