These are the latest success stories from a seven-year effort to pinpoint the state’s populations of wild brook, brown, and rainbow trout so these sensitive waters can be protected in the face of ongoing development.\n\nTU crews have surveyed more than 700 streams over the past six years, an effort it celebrates in a new short film, “86,000 Miles of Streams,” produced by award-winning photojournalist Sam Dean.\n\nThe film features Joe Baylog, president of TU’s Forks of the Delaware chapter outside Easton. Baylog is working to ensure protections for his favorite waters so his young daughter will be able to enjoy fishing for wild trout like he does. “What’s the old saying? You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone?” he asks in the film. “I think the reality is we don’t necessarily know what we have, and only thru exploration and research will we understand what we have.”\n\nPhotos and video courtesy of Sam Dean.
