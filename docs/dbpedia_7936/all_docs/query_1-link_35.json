In Pennsylvania, you can fish for trout all year, and within the state, over 125 stocked trout streams are open to year-round fishing.\n\nAs a general rule some of the best places to fly fish in Pennsylvania include:\n\nYoughiogheny River\n\nAllegheny River\n\nSusquehanna River\n\nLittle Juniata River\n\nBig Fishing Creek\n\nCedar Run\n\nFalling Springs Creek and more.\n\nFly fishing in the Keystone State can be an enjoyable experience for anglers of all experience levels. This article will look at all 25 of Pennsylvania's best spots for fly fishing.\n\nBest Fly Fishing locations in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is lucky to have an abundance of great fly fishing spots. Some of the best places to fly fish in Pennsylvania are:\n\n1. Allegheny River\n\nThe Allegheny River is a 325-mile (523 km) long headwater stream of the Ohio River in western Pennsylvania and New York. The Allegheny runs from its source barely above the midpoint of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York, then zigzags southwesterly across the state line to merge with the Monongahela.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Allegheny River, Pennsylvania:\n\nTrophy Dungeon - Natural- Size 8\n\nFlashback Pheasant Tail Beadhead Gold - Size 18\n\nJig Caddis Pupa Nymph - UV Olive Tungsten - Size 10\n\n2. Big Fishing Creek\n\nBig Fishing Creek, in Clinton County, is Pennsylvania's northernmost limestone stream with public access. From its source near Rte. 80 in the highlands east of Tylersville to its mouth on Bald Eagle Creek near Lock Haven, this waterway is Class A all the way through.\n\nBig Fish Creek is a 29.98-mile (48.25 km) long tributary of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. It flows into the Susquehanna River at Rupert, East Bloomsburg, and Bloomsburg, respectively. The watershed encompasses 385 square miles (1,000 km2).\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Big Fishing Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nElk Wing Caddis Tan- Size 16\n\nFlashback Hare's Ear Beadhead Natural - Size 20\n\nAutumn Splendor- Size 4\n\n3. Big Spring Creek\n\nBig Spring Creek, a 5.0-mile-long (8.0 km) tributary of Conodoguinet Creek in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, is the fifth largest spring in Pennsylvania and has a median flow of 18 million US gallons/27 cfs per day. Big Spring Creek rises near US Route 11, approximately 8 miles (13 km) northeast of Shippensburg, and feeds Conodoguinet Creek near Newville.\n\nIt's the ideal location to catch a 5-pound wild brook trout on a dry fly with a constant supply of cool, fertile water. Wading is permitted but not required in the 1.5-mile catch-and-release-only fly fishing area.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Big Springs Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nZebra Midge Black - Size 20\n\nTrico Dun and Spinner - Size 18-22\n\nSpanish Bullet Olive Tungsten - Size 14-16\n\n4. Cedar Run\n\nCedar Run is a north-flowing tributary of Pine Creek in Lycoming and Tioga counties in Pennsylvania. It begins just north of White Horse Hollow and runs south to just south of Oxbow Hollow beneath the Route 414 overpass.\n\nWhile Cedar Run isn't stocked, it has a healthy population of wild brown trout and brook trout in its source streams. Fahnestock Run and Minehole Run are neighboring tributaries with plenty of streambed brown trout.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Cedar Run, Pennsylvania:\n\nTrico Dun and Spinner - Size 18-22\n\nZebra Midge Curved Silver - Tungsten - Size 18\n\nSpotlight Caddis Emerger - Olive - Size 14\n\n5. Elk Creek\n\nElk Creek is a 30.4-mile (48.9 km) tributary of Lake Erie in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The creek belongs to the Lake Erie watershed and drains a basin of 99.4 square miles (257 km2). The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission regularly stocks Elk Creek with brown trout and steelhead.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Elk Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nDisco Midge - Pearl - Size 18\n\nGlo Bug Red Dot (Egg) - Orange)- Size 10\n\nPheasant Tail Jig Hot - Size 12\n\n6. Falling Springs Creek\n\nFalling Springs Creek is a limestone spring creek in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. It travels for four miles from a spring before merging with Conococheague Creek. The stream boasts a large population of wild rainbows and browns, which are not stocked by the state between the spring and I-81. Some rainbows grow to be as big as eighteen inches in length.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for Falling Springs Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nTrico Spinners - Size 20\n\nFlashback Hare's Ear Beadhead - Olive - Size 18\n\nMuddler Minnow - Size 6\n\n7. Fishing Creek\n\nFishing Creek is a minor tributary of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, United States, with a length of 29.98 miles (48 km). It joins the Susquehanna River near Rupert and Bloomsburg, and its watershed covers an area of 385 square miles (1,000 km2).\n\nCanoeing, birdwatching, and fishing are some of the recreational activities available. The creek is renowned for its trout population, which includes brook, brown, and rainbow trout, but it also harbors various other species of fish.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for Fishing Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nElk Hair Caddis CDC - TAN- Size 16\n\nSexy Walt Worm Tungsten - Size 16\n\nSlump Buster with Cone - Black - Size 6\n\n8. Kettle Creek\n\nThe Kettle Creek is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River that flows through Tioga, Potter, and Clinton counties in Pennsylvania. It measures around 43 miles (69 km) long.\n\nAlthough many streams in the Kettle Creek watershed are classified as \"Class A Wild Trout\" by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, lower portions of the stream suffer from acid mine drainage. The upper reaches of the creek are considered to be of excellent quality.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for Kettle Creek, Pennsylvania:\n\nRoyal Wulff - Size 12\n\nPrince Nymph Jigged Tungsten - Size 12\n\nBarr Emerger PMD - Size 20\n\n9. Lake Erie\n\nLake Erie is North America's fourth-largest lake (by surface area) and the eleventh-largest globally. It is also the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest (by volume) of the Great Lakes, resulting in a short average water stay time. Lake Erie's maximum depth is 210 feet (64 meters).\n\nFly fishing in Lake Erie is popular for targeting steelhead, brown trout, and smallmouth bass. The best time to go is from July through September, during the prime walleye season, but fish can be caught year-round.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for Lake Erie, Pennsylvania:\n\nCopper John Hot Wire Beadhead - Red Gold- Size 12\n\nGlo Bug Red Dot (Egg) - Pink- Size 10\n\nSlump Buster with Cone - Black - Size 6\n\n10. Letort Spring Run\n\nEven the most seasoned anglers find Letort Spring Run hard to fish. The sparkling water ensures that if you are not careful, the trout will see you. In Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, Letort Spring Run is a 9.4-mile-long tributary of Conodoguinet.\n\nThe most difficult sections of the stream to fish are at the headwaters, where the water is thick with plant life. The largest trout may be found in the upper reaches; however, because of the dense aquatic vegetation, they are difficult to catch. The mile-and-a-half stretch of the stream with the biggest brown trout in any portion is catch-and-release only. This sector begins at route 481 above the bridge and ends near Reading Railroad Bridge.\n\nStick to the lower sections of the stream, which have some broad open areas that are easier to cast into. The bottom portion also contains runs and riffle areas with faster water, making it simpler to catch trout.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for Letort Spring Run, Pennsylvania:\n\nCrystal Midge - Size 16\n\nDisco Midge Pearl - Size 18\n\nJuju Bee Midge- Size 22\n\n11. Little Juniata River\n\nThe Little Juniata River is a 32.1-mile (51.7 km) tributary of the Juniata River in Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River basin. It is formed at Altoona by the confluence of several short streams. The Logan Valley is where it flows northeast, at the base of Brush Mountain. Fly fishing on this river is excellent; it has a Class A wild brown trout population and does not require stocking.\n\nRecommended Fly Patterns for the Little Juniata River, Pennsylvania:\n\nRS2 Gray - Size 20\n\nHot Wing Caddis Tan - Size 12\n\nPheasant Tail Jig Natural Tungsten - Size 12\n\n12. Little Lehigh Creek\n\nThe Little Lehigh Creek is 24 miles (38.6 km) long and flows through the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania's easternmost portion. It begins in Longswamp Township, Berks County, and flows generally northeast through Lower Macungie Township and Salisbury Township before emptying into the Lehigh River near Allentown.\n\nThe stream is bountiful in Berks County, but the best fishing on this creek is in Lehigh County. It has some nice hatch of aquatic insects, as well as lots of scuds, and good dry fly fishing. A “Delayed Harvest Fly Fishing Only” zone extends from the T-508 bridge downstream to the T-510 bridge.
