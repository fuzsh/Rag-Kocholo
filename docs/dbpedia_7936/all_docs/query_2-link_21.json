        "text": "Other Wildlife Management\n\nDCNR lands host many different wildlife species, some are common, others are rare, still others are important game species.\n\nDCNR manages these wildlife resources through planning, inventory, and review, and close coordination with partner agencies:\n\nPennsylvania Game Commission\n\nPennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nWildlife Species on DCNR Lands\n\nWildlife species have special management needs based on their habitat and food requirements.\n\nWhether wildlife is rare or is a popular game species, species have specific management and conservation needs developed to enhance or maintain their habitat and food on DCNR lands.\n\nBelow are some of the activities DCNR is doing to benefit these species or their habitat on state forest or park lands.\n\nBrook Trout\n\nPennsylvania native brook trout is the state’s official fish, and they:\n\nAre indicators of superior water quality\n\nProvide recreational angling opportunities\n\nAre a symbol of our state’s outdoor traditions\n\nTrout fishing at DCNR state park and forests is a popular pastime.\n\nActivities that benefit brook trout also improve habitat for other cold water stream fish. DCNR and the Pa. Fish and Boat Commission work to benefit trout on DCNR lands:\n\nDCNR implements stream habitat improvement projects, such as placement of large woody debris and riparian plantings, to benefit trout and other fish.\n\nDCNR’s Brook Trout Conservation Plan (PDF) details the conservation measures the Bureau of Forestry will take to benefit the habitat of this species on state forest land.\n\nGame Birds\n\nDCNR benefits these popular game birds through forest management and specific habitat improvement projects.\n\nDCNR works with the Pa. Game Commission and non-profits such as National Wild Turkey Federation. Some of the projects include:\n\nGrouse habitat improvement by promoting shrubby young forests\n\nTurkey habitat improvement by using native seed mixes with preferred food sources\n\nWoodcock habitat improvement by improving young forests and removing invasive species\n\nElk\n\nElk are important large mammals on the landscape. They were almost extinct from Pennsylvania in the past, but have been re-introduced by the Pa. Game Commission in the elk management area in northeast Pennsylvania.\n\nElk viewing areas are available at the Elk Country Visitor Center, the Quehanna Wild Area, and the Elk Scenic Drive, part of the Pennsylvania Wilds.\n\nElk hunting is permitted on state forest and park lands in designated elk hunt zones and with an elk hunting license.\n\nSpecial seed mixes are used in some infrastructure revegetation to benefit elk in the elk management area.\n\nTurtles\n\nThere are many species of turtles found on state forest or park lands.\n\nDCNR has been working with the Pa. Fish and Boat Commission to benefit these reptiles. Work includes:"
