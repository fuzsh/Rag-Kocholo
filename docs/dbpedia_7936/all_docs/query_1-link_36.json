        "text": "State symbols can be a silly fun fact, but emblems can also be vehicles for change. Designating a state symbol is often done to bring awareness to an issue – in Hawaii, for example, state officials named the Hawaiian Hoary Bat one of its state mammals to sound the alarm for possible extinction. In Montana, the state fish choice brought awareness and conservation efforts to a species in decline.\n\nNearly every state has designated an official state fish except for three. Here's a breakdown of the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlabama's official state fish is the largemouth bass. The tarpon is the state saltwater fish.\n\nAlaska\n\nAlaska's state fish is the giant king salmon, an ocean beauty that can weigh up to 100 pounds.\n\nArizona\n\nThe Apache trout is Arizona's state fish.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas' state primitive fish is the alligator gar, which can grow up to 10 feet long and nearly 350 pounds. An 11-year-old Arkansas resident ran a #Garkansas campaign for 451 days until former Governor Asa Hutchinson signed the bill in 2019.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe golden trout, native to California, has been the state fish since 1947. California also has a state marine fish, the garibaldi.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado's state fish is the greenback cutthroat trout. the species was originally thought to be extinct until the early 1990s when researchers discovered a small population of trout in Rocky Mountain National Park streams.\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut's state fish is the American shad, the largest of the state's herring species that reside in the Connecticut River and swim upstream.\n\nDelaware\n\nThe weakfish is Delaware's state fish.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nD.C. has its own state fish despite not being an official state.
