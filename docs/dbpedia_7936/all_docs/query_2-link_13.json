        "text": "Family Overview\n\nFamily Salmonidae, the trout and salmon family, includes great game fish like trout, salmon, chars and grayling, as well as food and baitfishes like whitefish and ciscoes. The trout and salmon family is large. It is native to cool and cold streams and lakes throughout Europe, northern Asia and North America, and reaches as far south as northwest Mexico and extreme northern Africa. One family member, the Arctic Char, is the freshwater fish that occurs the farthest north. Because of their popularity for sport and commercial fishing, this family has been stocked in waters worldwide and is now found on nearly every continent.\n\n​\n\nMany trout that anglers catch in Pennsylvania are the result of the stocking of hatchery-raised fish. However, where streams are cold and clean enough, with proper spawning habitat, Pennsylvania also has a wealth of reproducing populations of wild trout. In Pennsylvania, the trout and salmon family includes three species of the genus Coregonus, all native and found in Lake Erie: the rare Longjaw Cisco, the Cisco or Lake Herring, and the Lake Whitefish–silvery well-scaled fishes with deeply forked tails. The Whitefish is currently an important commercial species. It has rebounded with reductions in the numbers of Sea Lampreys and Rainbow Smelt. Rainbow Smelt were believed to prey on whitefish eggs and young.\n\nOther members of the trout family native to Pennsylvania, not introduced, are Chars of the genus Salvelinus: the Brook Trout and the Lake Trout. Brook Trout remain the only wild trout native to Pennsylvania's inland streams and rivers, while the four other native species (Longjaw Cisco, Cisco or Lake Herring, Lake Whitefish, and Lake Trout) inhabit the state's lakes.\n\nIdentification of Common Trout and Salmon in PA.

Comparing Native, Wild, and Hatchery Fish\n\nPennsylvania has an impressive diversity of fishes within the Family Salmonidae., However, in conversation and in text, they are sometimes referenced using varying terminology. For example, it is not uncommon to hear an angler mention phrases such as: “I’m going to spend the day fishing for natives,” or “Wow! That is a beautiful fish! I’m sure it is wild.”\n\nOne might also find themselves reading about the 3.2 million hatchery-reared trout that the PFBC stocks into approved stocked trout waterways each year. All of this vocabulary can become quite confusing when it comes to correctly recognizing a fish for what it may or may not be. What constitutes the difference between a native fish, a wild fish, and a hatchery fish? The best way to understand how to properly categorize these fishes is to have clear definitions for the terminology used.\n\nNative fishes are those species of fish that occurred historically and naturally in Pennsylvania’s waterways before any human involvement.\n\n​It is known that the Brook Trout is the only native salmonid to Pennsylvania’s inland rivers and streams. This means that historically these populations were the only salmonids that could be found inland within Pennsylvania. The Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout populations that can be found today are considered non-native species and were introduced through human intervention. The Brook Trout is Pennsylvania’s only inland salmonid that can be classified as both native and wild. Understand that this does not indicate that Rainbow Trout and Brown trout cannot be referenced as wild fishes.\n\nBrook Trout are Pennsylvania’s only inland salmonid (trout/salmon) classified as both native and wild.\n\nWild fishes are those species of fish that were born and grew up within the stream, river, or lake.\n\nPopulations of wild Brown Trout have been documented in many waterways throughout Pennsylvania. Even though Brown Trout are classified as a non-native species in Pennsylvania, it is very common for them to be referenced as wild if, in fact, that fish was born within the waterway with no human intervention. The same can be said for some populations of Rainbow Trout in Pennsylvania. This is not the case for fishes that were born and reared within a hatchery setting.\n\nHatchery fishes are those species of fish that are spawned and reared within the hatchery system.\n\nEvery year, Pennsylvania stocks hatchery trout into approved waterways throughout the state. These fishes provide angling opportunities for the public in many lakes, river and streams where anglers would otherwise not have the opportunity to experience catching them. The PFBC stocked, hatchery-reared Brook, Brown, and Rainbow Trout are NOT classified as wild fishes. Regardless of reference or status, Pennsylvania’s salmonids – whether native, wild, or hatchery – require cold, clean water and ultimately play a role in ecosystem health and ecology. ​\n\nBrown Trout (top) and Rainbow Trout (bottom) can be classified as either wild or hatchery fish in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe PA TIC program further enforces this fact through education and interpretation, giving students the opportunity to learn more about Pennsylvania’s important aquatic resources. ​\n\nHistory of Trout Provided in PA TIC\n\n​Today, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) provides Rainbow Trout to all registered PA TIC participants. Historically, however, this is not the only species students have raised from eggs to fingerlings in the PA TIC program. In the beginning (2006-2007), PA TIC participants visited a local hatchery to choose the type of trout eggs they wanted to raise in their classrooms. Trout selected included Brook, Rainbow, or Brown Trout.\n\nPA TIC eggs are now sourced from a single hatchery: the Benner Spring Fish Culture Station.\n\nIn 2008, with the program gaining more popularity and interest, PFBC began providing trout eggs from one state hatchery to streamline the PATIC program’s source of eggs, shipment process, and fish health, and to direct where the trout were allowed to be released (e.g., Stocked Trout Waters). At that time, the trout of choice was the Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), the state fish of Pennsylvania and the only salmonid (trout/salmon) native to Pennsylvania's streams, unlike the non-native Rainbow and Brown Trout, also populous in the state's waters. Although all eggs used in the program originate from stocked, hatchery-reared trout rather than wild trout, the PA TIC program's use of Brook Trout helped deepen students' understanding of the value of native species in healthy watersheds.\n\nFor nearly a decade, PFBC continued to provide Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) as the “TIC Trout.\" Then, in 2016, fisheries biologists began to receive increased angler reports of parasitic Gill Lice (Salminocla edwardsii) being found on Brook Trout, not only in stocked trout waters, but also in native trout waters. This type of Gill Lice is “host-specific” to the Char family, meaning that in Pennsylvania it exclusively parasitizes the Brook Trout. Simultaneously, PFBC fisheries biologists were implementing statewide management strategies to minimize conflicts between hatchery Brook Trout and PA’s Wild Brook Trout populations. In 2019, PFBC made a proactive decision to decrease Brook Trout stockings statewide, first within the PFBC hatchery system and then within the PFBC’s Cooperative Nursery Program.\n\nAs the responsible organization for Pennsylvania's aquatic resources and the provider of PA TIC trout eggs, PFBC extended this decision to the PA TIC program. Beginning with the 2019-2020 PA TIC school year, PFBC switched from using Brook Trout to using Rainbow Trout as the source for TIC eggs. This transition represented an important effort to conserve and protect Pennsylvania’s native Wild Brook Trout populations.\n\nFrom 2006-2007, PA TIC students raised hatchery-born Brook Trout, Rainbow Trout, or Brown Trout. In 2008-2019, students exclusively raised hatchery-born Brook Trout.\n\nSince fall 2019, PA TIC students have raised hatchery-born Rainbow Trout. This is part of an important effort to conserve and protect Pennsylvania’s native Wild Brook Trout populations.\n\nThe program’s current use of Rainbow Trout eggs does NOT mean Brook Trout and native-species education no longer have a place in participants' hearts and classrooms. As the only salmonid native to the rivers and streams across the eastern United States, it is deeply important that students and teachers not only understand the proactive decision made by PFBC to protect Brook Trout populations, but also the important role that native Brook Trout play in coldwater ecosystems and the history of Pennsylvania's waters.\n\nPA TIC partners and teachers are encouraged to explore the link between native species and healthy watersheds, while the live Rainbow Trout provide a unique learning experience for students to intimately study trout life cycles, aquatic adaptations, coldwater ecosystems, non-native species, and so much more! ​\n\nBrook Trout (top), Rainbow Trout (middle) and Brown Trout (bottom) fingerlings collected and released safely during a PFBC fish community survey. While the trout fingerlings are beginning to exhibit the unique markings and colors that define their species, all three fingerlings or \"parr\" bear longitudinal \"parr marks.\" These stripes provide important camouflage and protect the fingerlings from predators.\n\nWhy Rainbow Trout?\n\n​The Science Behind the Shift\n\nAs the TIC program continues to grow—from 90 PA TIC programs in 2008 to roughly 415 programs in 2019—we are always seeking new ways to continue maintaining a sustainable program. Such a program benefits TIC teachers, students, and program partners, but also does not impact Pennsylvania's water resources. Our program should have:\n\nbig impacts on students\n\nand\n\nsmall impacts on water resources\n\nGill Lice (S. edwardsii) parasitize the gills of a brook trout, decreasing the fish's ability to survive stresses in temperature and dissolved oxygen. Photo courtesy of Wisconsin Trout Unlimited.\n\nA difficult but necessary milestone in our sustainable program model occurred in the 2019-2020 school year, when PFBC switched to Rainbow Trout eggs for the PA TIC programs. This shift from hatchery-reared Brook Trout to hatchery-reared Rainbow Trout was part of an ongoing management strategy to continue the enhancement and protection of Pennsylvania's wild native Brook Trout populations and their coldwater environs from threats, such as:\n\n​Potential degradation of genetic integrity of Wild Brook Trout populations\n\nPotential competition with hatchery reared Brook Trout​\n\nPathogens/parasites, including Gill Lice (Salmincola edwardsii) for which Brook Trout are “hosts/vectors”\n\nGill Lice are a current and real issue for PA’s Wild Brook Trout populations. In 2016, fisheries biologists began to receive increased angler reports of the species of Gill Lice that is host-specific to Brook Trout, not only in stocked trout waters, but also in native trout waters. Among these reports were the first incidents of parasitic Gill Lice on Pennsylvania’s wild inland Brook Trout, or those Brook Trout not associated with Lake Erie drainages. Although Gill Lice are not linked directly to fish mortality, the parasites are linked to a decrease in respiration (Gill Lice are attached to the gills) and increased susceptibility to warming temperatures, thereby negatively impacting a Brook Trouts’ overall survival. Continued stocking of hatchery-reared Brook Trout, including those released in PA TIC, could potentially exacerbate the risk of wild native Brook Trout being parasitized and, by extension, inhibit the survival of these important populations.\n\nWant to learn more about Gill Lice?
