        "text": "Habitat\n\nThe Brook Trout lives naturally in small, cold, clean streams. It also adapts to ponds and lakes, as well as in-stream beaver ponds. Brook Trout are found in Pennsylvania as wild populations in the Ohio, Susquehanna, Genesee, Potomac and Delaware River watersheds. Brook Trout are also found throughout the state as hatchery-raised, stocked fish. The habitat of wild Brook Trout has been greatly reduced in Pennsylvania since European settlers arrived, with land-use changes, mining, and warming and silting of streams, and with other pollution and stream habitat degradation. Naturally self-sustaining populations can still be found in limestone spring-fed streams and cold, mountain creeks. Brook Trout can tolerate relatively acidic waters, but not temperatures much over 65 degrees.\n\nLife History"
