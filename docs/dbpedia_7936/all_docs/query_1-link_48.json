The most highly sought-after fish species in the fishing in Pittsburgh PA river systems are hybrid striped bass, trouts, smallmouths, largemouths, walleye, and more. This destination is among the best in the world, with Lake Erie and the Susquehanna River being the most known for their incredible smallmouth fishing trips. However, Pittsburg is close to numerous other hot spots for popular game fish.\n\nThe Allegheny River\n\nThe Allegheny River flows along the northern section of Pittsburgh to Point State Park downtown. The water in this river is clearer and cooler than any other waterway in the city because of the riverâ€™s dams and tributaries. You will find walleye, catfish, sauger, and bass in these local waters. The Highland Park Dam is full of walleye when the water level is low. The USA today and Game & Fish Magazine voted this spot as a top PA fishing spot, making it one of the most nationally recognized spots for anglers within city limits.\n\nVerona Public Docks\n\nLocated on the Allegheny Riverâ€™s east riverbank, Verona Public Docks is an excellent place for fishing. Its cool and clear waters will provide anglers with sauger, bass, catfish, and walleye. Other access points to different fishing spots such as the Milvale boat ramp, the Highland Park Dam, the 40th Street Bridge are among the most popular ones in the region.\n\nNine Mile Run\n\nFrick Parkâ€™s Nine Mile Run was formerly a sewer that has been rehabilitated and is now full of gamefish. This fishery provides one of the most authentic and off-the-map experiences. To get to this spot, you have to cross smaller pools of water and comb through vegetation.\n\nOhio River\n\nThe mouth of the Ohio River forms at the joining of the Allegheny downtown and Monongahela. The OH River waters are deeper and broader as it makes its way out of Pittsburgh. The best place for casual fishing is Pittsburghâ€™s Point State Park, where anglers using the docks can fish from the shallow waters.\n\nIf you continue downriver to other fishing spots, you will find the Emsworth Lock and Dam and Neville Island. In this river, you can catch smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, flathead catfish, blue catfish, white crappie, black crappie, northern pike, trouts, paddlefish, and more.\n\nRaccoon Lake\n\nLocated in Beaver County, Raccoon Lake is an ideal place for family outings and gives the feeling like you have escaped Pittsburghâ€™s city life while remaining close to it. There is a fishing pier to catch the largely populated sunfish and bluegill.\n\nCross Creek Lake\n\nWith 258 acres at your disposal, the Cross Creek Lake located in Washington County is a 50-minute drive away from Pittsburgh. The lakeâ€™s sizeable surrounding area makes it a great fishing spot and provides the best bass fishing in the area. Keep in mind that this lake has public docks and a paved boat ramp, making fishing more ideal.\n\nBest Local Spot For Panfish\n\nLake Arthur\n\nLake Arthur sits north of Pittsburgh and is known for producing some of the largest bluegills and crappies in the region. Several of the stateâ€™s top record crappies were caught in Lake Arthur. The bluegills consistently push the 9-inch range in this lake. When fishing in Pittsburgh area the most effective method is to use panfish lures such as small jigs tipped with natural-looking soft plastics.\n\nBest Local Spot for Giant Catfish\n\nMonogahela River\n\nThis river flows from West Virginia, joining into the Allegheny River, and produces some giant catfish. Although murky, these waters have the required quality to be the home for many different species. The remaining structures from the industrial era are convenient enough for angling along the river. People can catch the lurking fishes around the old docks and riverfront walls. Fishers will have a wide variety to catch, including bullhead catfish, rock bass, walleye, muskie, brown trout, brook, and rainbow trout.\n\nClean Water Act\n\nThis cityâ€™s waters used to be polluted in the industrial era; however, authorities took an initiative to cleanse the areaâ€™s contaminated waters. Today the rivers are exceptionally clean and are again home to species that died out in the past. The Clean Water Act in 1972 turned back the tide of pollution in the local waters. The Act had a remarkable effect on the water quality and created various regulatory and non-regulatory tools that dramatically reduced discharges into the waterways, managed polluted runoff, and financed municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Programs were set in place so that the state could support public recreation in and on the water. Today, Pittsburg possesses the second-highest number of pleasure boats in the United States."
