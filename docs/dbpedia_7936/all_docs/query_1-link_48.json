This destination is among the best in the world, with Lake Erie and the Susquehanna River being the most known for their incredible smallmouth fishing trips. However, Pittsburg is close to numerous other hot spots for popular game fish.\n\nThe Allegheny River\n\nThe Allegheny River flows along the northern section of Pittsburgh to Point State Park downtown. The water in this river is clearer and cooler than any other waterway in the city because of the river’s dams and tributaries. You will find walleye, catfish, sauger, and bass in these local waters. The Highland Park Dam is full of walleye when the water level is low. The USA today and Game & Fish Magazine voted this spot as a top PA fishing spot, making it one of the most nationally recognized spots for anglers within city limits.\n\nVerona Public Docks\n\nLocated on the Allegheny River’s east riverbank, Verona Public Docks is an excellent place for fishing. Its cool and clear waters will provide anglers with sauger, bass, catfish, and walleye. Other access points to different fishing spots such as the Milvale boat ramp, the Highland Park Dam, the 40th Street Bridge are among the most popular ones in the region.\n\nNine Mile Run\n\nFrick Park’s Nine Mile Run was formerly a sewer that has been rehabilitated and is now full of gamefish. This fishery provides one of the most authentic and off-the-map experiences. To get to this spot, you have to cross smaller pools of water and comb through vegetation.\n\nOhio River\n\nThe mouth of the Ohio River forms at the joining of the Allegheny downtown and Monongahela. The OH River waters are deeper and broader as it makes its way out of Pittsburgh. The best place for casual fishing is Pittsburgh’s Point State Park, where anglers using the docks can fish from the shallow waters.\n\nIf you continue downriver to other fishing spots, you will find the Emsworth Lock and Dam and Neville Island.

The lake’s sizeable surrounding area makes it a great fishing spot and provides the best bass fishing in the area. Keep in mind that this lake has public docks and a paved boat ramp, making fishing more ideal.\n\nBest Local Spot For Panfish\n\nLake Arthur\n\nLake Arthur sits north of Pittsburgh and is known for producing some of the largest bluegills and crappies in the region. Several of the state’s top record crappies were caught in Lake Arthur. The bluegills consistently push the 9-inch range in this lake. When fishing in Pittsburgh area the most effective method is to use panfish lures such as small jigs tipped with natural-looking soft plastics.\n\nBest Local Spot for Giant Catfish\n\nMonogahela River\n\nThis river flows from West Virginia, joining into the Allegheny River, and produces some giant catfish. Although murky, these waters have the required quality to be the home for many different species. The remaining structures from the industrial era are convenient enough for angling along the river. People can catch the lurking fishes around the old docks and riverfront walls. Fishers will have a wide variety to catch, including bullhead catfish, rock bass, walleye, muskie, brown trout, brook, and rainbow trout.\n\nClean Water Act\n\nThis city’s waters used to be polluted in the industrial era; however, authorities took an initiative to cleanse the area’s contaminated waters. Today the rivers are exceptionally clean and are again home to species that died out in the past. The Clean Water Act in 1972 turned back the tide of pollution in the local waters. The Act had a remarkable effect on the water quality and created various regulatory and non-regulatory tools that dramatically reduced discharges into the waterways, managed polluted runoff, and financed municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Programs were set in place so that the state could support public recreation in and on the water. Today, Pittsburg possesses the second-highest number of pleasure boats in the United States."
