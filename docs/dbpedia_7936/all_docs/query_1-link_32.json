        "text": "Last weekend I spent time chasing wild brook trout in the mountains of Clinton County, focusing on tributaries of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. This weekend, I decided to move further east and search for wild brook trout in Sullivan and Wyoming Counties. There is a popular State Park located in Columbia, Luzerne, and Sullivan counties called Ricketts Glen. This park is well known in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York because of its many hiking trails and magnificent waterfalls formed by Kitchen Creek. Just north of Rickets Glen State Park is a large track of state owned property known as State Game Lands Number 57. This track of game lands is made up of over 45,000 acres and has several streams running through it that hold populations of wild brook trout. The challenge I found is getting access to them.\n\nOn Saturday morning I drove north to Wyoming County and attempted to enter Game Lands 57 from the north. Google Maps makes it easy to find entrances and state roads that head into the forest, what they don’t show is where roads are gated. I drove a few miles into the forest on 4x4 roads and had no issues. About a mile down this road, I ran into a State Game Commission Truck with two officers that were patrolling for spring turkey season. I chatted with them briefly and they explained that the road I was on would only be open for a few more days and would be gated after turkey season ended. I asked them about the streams I was looking to access, specifically South Brook and Opossum Creek. They said that both of these creeks were a long way back and would only be accessible on foot or by bicycle due to a second gated road. I was frustrated. I continued down the road and sure enough, where I wanted to turned left was a shut and locked gate. One truck sat at the small lot in front of the gate, probably a bird watcher, or perhaps someone even crazier than me, wiling to hiking a couple miles on foot to get entrance to a small stream.\n\nWhen you’re deep in the forest, cell phone signals are usually non-existent. I had no way to search for a back up entrance to access these streams. I drove all the way back the way I came. I drove out of the park and headed towards Forkston, Pennsylvania, hoping to find at least two bars on my cellphone. Eventually I hit a “live” spot and pulled into a small gas station to set my next course of action. I found that there was an additional entrance to the state land to the west, but it would require an additional thirty minutes of drive time. Did I really have a choice? I headed west.\n\nOnce I reached the second entrance I followed my GPS to the first left turn that was to take me to the lower reaches of Opossum Creek. Unfortunately I found that this road was also gated and locked. It was turning into one of those days. I looked at my GPS and the map showed the road I was on continuing for another couple of miles and I saw there was an unnamed body of water crossing it. I decided it couldn’t hurt to check it out. As I drove towards this stream, I passed a small stream that paralleled the road for a bit. This water had a bronze tint and appeared to tannic. Water that is tannic is often that color due to decaying vegetation and can also be a sign of acid mine drainage. I was concerned that any water I found might be void of life, but to my surprise, when I arrive at the small bridge crossing, this unnamed body of water appeared to hold clear spring water. I looked upstream through the trees and the water didn’t look very wide. For a second I considered leaving, but I’d come this far, it was only noontime. I rigged up my 8’-4wt G-Loomis Pro-4X with a 9’-6X leader. I put 24” of 6X tippet at the end of the leader and tied on a #16 Psycho Prince Nymph pattern that was purple, had bright flash wrap on the hook and a gold bead head."
