Often brilliantly colored, particularly in the wild, the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalus) is Pennsylvania's state fish and one for which many anglers wet a line. Jason Detar, Area Fisheries Manager, and Nathan Walters, Coldwater Unit Leader, both with the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, will share information about this beautiful char and highlight fishing opportunities.

This event, hosted by Penguin Court, is open to the public. It is a "pay what you wish" program with proceeds benefitting Penguin Court's education and outreach. Registration is required to receive the Zoom link. Thank you for considering a donation.
