I look like I’m walking

Sometimes I swing my arms further, my steps get quicker

But I tread on nothing

And I’m still in the same place

I look like I’m enjoying myself

Absorbed in my work

My hand reaches for my phone

But lets go, for loneliness

Cannot be quenched at 4 a.m.

I look fine when I talk to you,

Your life perhaps a tangent to mine

But like a swan’s turbulence beneath the surface

So is my mind

Unable to escape the reflection of your face

And the echoes of your words

Didn’t expect to fall for you

While climbing in self-confidence

Didn’t know what a big influence

That small talk had on me

Didn’t know what it all meant

Still unsure what it now means

Is that all, then?

Was there nothing to begin with?

Of course.
