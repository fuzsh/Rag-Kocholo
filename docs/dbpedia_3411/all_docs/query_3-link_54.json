The Digital Institutional Repository contains most RIT theses; however, not all past works have been digitized. If you are seeking a specific thesis and do not see it here, please contact the RIT Archives Collections.\n\nAll theses and dissertations from 2010 to the present are also available to Rochester Institute of Technology faculty, students and staff from ProQuest."
