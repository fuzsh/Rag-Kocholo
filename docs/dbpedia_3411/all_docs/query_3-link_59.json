        "text": "As is fitting of the times, I spent a few minutes with ChatGPT/Dall*E to prompt my way to that image. In the distant past (last year), I would have used a search engine, scouring the internet for such an image. If I could even find anything close to what I wanted, I’d then be worried about copyright, and the fact the image is probably also being used by someone else. Now, I know this image is “my own”, at least I think so, and it represents exactly what I wanted.\n\nI went through several iterations before I got to this image, and I could go through several more rounds, tweaking along the way, but it was less than 5 minute’s worth of work. Such is “the power of AI”.\n\nThis image represents a couple of things that are going on right now. Between advances in hardware tech, and the rise of new things such as LLMs, and quantum computing, and humanoid robotics, there’s a wave of things that threaten to swamp our human understanding of the world and the way things work. I recently had a discussion with a friend who’s working in the core of all this AI hullabaloo, and they are clearly thinking “what does this all mean? It’s moving so fast we haven’t truly thought about the implications to humanity…”. Just let that sink in for a moment. If you thought you were being overwhelmed as an outsider, the people on the inside are having the same thoughts.\n\nOK, so… What to do?\n\nWell, there it is. An actual functioning CNC router table.\n\nBeing one to invent random words, I came up with “manufatory”, to mean “manufacturing at the speed of thought. What am I trying to get at? In general, I’m on a crusade for tequity, having an equity share in technology, for intergenerational wealth creation. Whether it be owning stocks in a company, or patents, or other artifacts, being able to ride the rising tide of tech wealth requires owning a piece of it, and not just being a consumer of tech.\n\nSo, what’s this manufactory business about? Software production is one kind of intellectual property, but not all things are software. Everything we interact with in the world was created by someone, or some machine, somewhere in the world. Being able to think up a design, produce the goods economically, and sell them into open markets, is tequity.\n\nA couple blogs back (Embodied AI – Software seeking hardware) I mentioned three machines,\n\n3D printer\n\nCNC router\n\nRobot arm\n\nA robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\n\nA robot may not harm a human being.\n\nA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law\n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nA robot must know it is a robot.\n\nIsaac Asimov popularized the “Three Laws of Robotics” in his Robot series, starting in 1940. Asimov is a pillar of modern day science fiction. Not “just a writer”, he was a full on scientist, philosopher, and all around renaissance man. Asimov gave us the word “robotics”, and here we are!\n\nIt was 5 years ago when I wrote about my home automation efforts: Home Automation – Choosing Bulbs\n\nBack then, I was enthusiastic about replacing the myriad halogen bulbs in my house with LED based bulbs, and while I was at it, ‘automating’ them as well. I installed Philips Hue, some Lutron dimmers, and hooked it all up to Alexa so I could say “downstairs lights on!”. So, 5 years on, how has it gone?\n\nWell, aside from doing the occasional demo of turning the lights on and off by talking to the ever present speaker, we really don’t use the automation at all. Why not? It’s far easier to just flick the light switch on or off when you enter/exit a room, and we never really got into ‘automation’, like setting up on/off patterns when on vacation.\n\nThe “AI” space writ large, covers an array of different topics. At this moment in time, the Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured everyone’s imagination, due to their uncanny ability to give seemingly good answers to a number of run of the mill questions. I have been using ChatGPT specifically for the past year or so, and have found it to be a useful companion for certain tasks. The combination I use is GitHub Copilot, in my Visual Studio development environment, and ChatGPT on the side. Copilot is great for doing very sophisticated copy and paste based on comments I type in my code. ChatGPT is good for exploring new areas I’m not familiar with, and making suggestions as to things I can try.\n\nI have been writing code since about 1978, when I first had access to a Commodore PET computer. For me, it’s always been about having fun, doing things with the machine that might not be obvious, and certainly not achievable on my own. Over the years, I’ve picked up some tips and tricks to help me get to the interesting parts sooner rather than later. During the 1980s-1990s, there was a ‘demo scene’ wherein coders such as myself, were engaged in trying to push our ‘personal computers’ to the limit in terms of what they could do visually, and with audio. This demo scene was often centered around computers such as the Commodore 64, or Apple II, or the venerable Commodore Amiga. The demo scene days are largely gone, and computers are a few orders of magnitude more powerful than those early personal computers.\n\nAnd yet…\n\nThat’s a lot of fonts. But, it’s a relatively simple task to achieve once we’ve gained some understanding of how to deal with text. We’ll park this bit of code here (fontlist.cpp) while we gain some understanding.\n\nI must say, dealing with fonts, and text rendering is one of the most challenging of the graphics disciplines. We could spend years and gigabytes of text explaining the intricacies of how fonts and text work. For our demo scene, we’re not going to get into all that though. We just want a little bit of text to be able to splash around here and there. So, I’m going to go the easy route, and explain how to use the system text rendering and incorporate it into the rest of our little demo framework.\n\nWait, what? Well, yah, why not?\n\nOne of the joys I’ve had as a programmer over the years has been to read some paper, or some article, and try out the code for myself. Well, ray tracing has been a love of mine since the early 90s, when I first played with POV Ray.\n\nBack in the day, Peter Shirley introduced ray tracing to an audience of eager programmers through the book: Ray Tracing in One Weekend. There were two subsequent editions that followed, exploring various optimizations and improvements. For the purposes of my demo scene here, I wanted to see how hard it was to integrate, and how big the program would be."
