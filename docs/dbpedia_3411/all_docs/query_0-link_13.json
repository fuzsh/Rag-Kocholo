        "meta_description": "Lisaac is the first compiled object-oriented programming language based on prototype concepts. The ideas in Lisaac are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (where all values are objects), Self (the prototype-based side) and Eiffel (the powerfull design by contract). More than the advantages of Self, Lisaac ensures the protection of communication mecanisms and operating systems tools. Indeed, the use of prototypes and dynamic inheritance is fully adapted to the conception of operating systems.",
