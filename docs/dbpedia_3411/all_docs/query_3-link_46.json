        "text": "Hey there, LinkedIn community! 👋 Sharing a slice of my journey and some thoughts that have been brewing in my mind as I transition into a new role. Thrilled to dive into a more generational, healthy, and supportive workplace as a Human Resources Coordinator after 6 rewarding years in HR. 🌟 Now, as I embrace this exciting chapter, I wanted to share a few insights that I believe can contribute to more awareness, effective management, and a positive workplace culture from an employee's perspective. 🚀 **🔹 Your Authentic Self Matters:** To all job seekers out there, remember that your unique experiences and strengths define you. Embrace them and bring your genuine self to the table. It's your individuality that sets you apart. 🌈 **🔹 Building Bridges Through Listening:** I'm learning that being a junior in HR means honing the art of active listening. Understanding each team member's voice and perspective is at the core of creating a nurturing work environment. 🗣️ **🔹 A Culture of Inclusivity:** Let's work together to make our workplaces more diverse and inclusive. Small, meaningful actions can create a culture where everyone feels welcomed and valued. 🤝 **🔹 Nurturing Mental Well-being:** Prioritize mental health, yours and others'. We're at our best when we're mentally well, so let's foster an environment where conversations about well-being are celebrated. 💆♂️ **🔹 Lifelong Learning Never Stops:** Whether you're a junior or a seasoned pro, the journey of growth is continuous. Keep upskilling, stay curious, and embrace change as a chance to learn something new. 📚 I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to a workplace that embodies these principles.

I am re-posting this one because it reminds me of a mantra I used when times were tougher for me: \"I am not a victim. Life doesn't have to just happen to me, I have some say and control over how I experience life.\" We have control over whether our work feels purposeful. I like that. It also reminds me of some other beliefs I have accumulated over the past few years [nothing groundbreaking or original here]: -employees have to want to be engaged to be engaged (they have control, we can't just impose engagement on them) -employees have to want to change to change (we can impose it on them, but they can choose to act in their old ways, aka control) How can employers get employees to WANT to find meaning and purpose in their work, to want to feel engaged and connected, to want this change coming at them? No really, I am asking.\n\n: 🌟 My Journey: From Trying to fulfil Family dreams to Finding my own passion 🌟 Life is a journey filled with unexpected turns, and my path has been no exception. 🔹 Starting Point: Medical Aspirations My journey began with a deep desire to fulfill my family's dreams by preparing for a career in medicine. The rigor and discipline required were immense, and I was determined to succeed. Yet, as I delved deeper into the field, I realized that my true passion lay elsewhere. 🔹 A Shift in Focus: Business Psychology This realization led me to pivot and pursue a degree in Social and Organizational Psychology. It was here that I discovered my fascination with understanding human behavior in the workplace. I learned how psychological principles could be applied to improve business outcomes and enhance employee well-being. This was a turning point, as I felt a strong alignment with my interests and aspirations. 🔹 Current Passion: Human Resources Today, I am passionately pursuing a career in Human Resources. This field allows me to combine my knowledge of psychology with my desire to make a positive impact on people's professional lives. From talent acquisition to employee engagement and development, HR offers a dynamic and fulfilling career path. I am excited to contribute to creating supportive and productive work environments. 💡 Lessons Learned Follow Your Passion: It’s essential to listen to your inner voice and pursue what truly excites you. Be Adaptable: Life may take you in unexpected directions, and it’s important to be flexible and open to change. Leverage Your Skills: Use your unique background and skills to carve out a niche that aligns with your passion and strengths. I am grateful for every step of this journey, as it has shaped me into the professional I am today. Here’s to the exciting path ahead in Human Resources! 🚀 #CareerJourney #HumanResources #BusinessPsychology #FollowYourPassion #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nFeeling stuck in your career?

I certainly did. By the time we reach our mid-twenties, our athletic coaches, school teachers, professors, and counselors have all moved on. Even those early career mentors and the workplace buddies our companies assigned have disappeared. Without noticing it, we begin to resist new ideas, new experiences, and instead prioritize goals that will make us feel stable and comfortable. Why do we do this? I think it’s because many of us stop letting people into our lives who challenge us to grow at a pace even remotely close to what we once experienced. We start to place more value on seeking environments and experiences that make us comfortable rather than challenge us. Life is all about growth and development. The growth of ourselves and those around us. Fight the desire this week to seek comfort at the cost of compromising your own growth. Find a way to seek out and allow people back into your life who will challenge your growth and development. #hrconsulting #careercoaching #humanresources #careerdevelopment #professionaldevelopment **************** Sharing insights designed to fuel your career advancement - Follow Michael Chadwick & Mission Ready Consulting Group.
