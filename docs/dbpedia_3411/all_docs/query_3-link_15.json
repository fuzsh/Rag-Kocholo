The Smalltalk Opportunity Today • Tools for research • Tools for reverse engineering • Grid and MPP Computing • Meta-modeling and Meta- Programming environments • Simulation Environments For eLearning • Searching For Sapphire? © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n38. In Search of Sapphire - ScriptingSmalltalk • Perl, Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby … needs competition – bad design, too complex, too slow • TTY Smalltalk with friendly Publication Language and ASCII Syntax • Java like class and package structure • Proper Modules, Namespaces and Components • Multiple IDE Support – Smalltalk-80, Eclipse, Visual Studio.Net • Proper lexical closures and continuations • Don’t Ignore Functional and Vector Languages © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n39. In Search of Sapphire - ScriptingSmalltalk • Bindings to Windows and Linux platforms C APIs (internet programming) • Better support for strings, XML, threads (persistent CGI) • SapphireWeblog – Smalltalk's own vision of Zope which combines, Wiki, Web server • Improved Libraries – Simplified (VB) and better Algorithms • Image disappears and reappears as a cache • Smallscript.net and F-Script are exemplars, we need more © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n40. Summary Respect The Best – Embrace The Future • The path to widespread use or commercial success is never clear – follow the customer • Customers keep you honest and should force you to simplify • Smalltalk is a much better language for modeling the world • Smalltalk is a much better language for modeling than UML • Smalltalk is a much better language for scripting than Python, Ruby, PHP etc. but needs to meet them on their own terms © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n41. © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n42. © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n43. © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n44. © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n45. © Bedarra Corp 2002\n\n46. © Bedarra Corp 2002"
