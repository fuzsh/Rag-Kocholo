        "text": "I am the inventor of multiverse travel, and I am not insane. Insanity is marked by an acute irrationality, a lack of coherent thought, or a prolonged psychosis. My behavior over the past eleven years, forty-seven days, and approximately fifteen hours has been entirely forthright and logical. I am not detached from reality. In fact, I have acted very much in accordance with the authentic material world as it has been presented before me. I am not insane. It is reality that has gone mad.\n\nAs I write to you today, I shall make my case that I did not murder my wife and children, nor did I kill myself. I was entirely justified in what I did againâ€¦ and again. And when you have heard my perspective in full, I am sure you will come to sympathize with what I am about to do."
