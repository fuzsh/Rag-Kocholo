        "text": "I’m often asked for advice on university courses.\n\nWhich one should they choose?\n\nShould they even go to university at all?\n\nParents will give the usual suggestions:\n\n“Go to the most prestigious one, so that it impresses employers”\n\nor\n\n“Pick a course with safe job prospects”\n\nMy view is slightly different.\n\nLet’s look at what you actually get from a degree.\n\nThese are some valuable skills, but maybe not the ones they advertise at Open Day…\n\nFind things that interest you\n\nMost students have no idea what they want to do in ten years’ time.\n\nYou might have an inkling but not a firm idea.\n\nThis is the advantage of generalist courses that teach you how to think, rather than a specialization or practical skill.\n\nExamples include: Arts, Science, Engineering, Business and Design.\n\nThese courses are like a canape dinner: various little bits of food, some delicious, some strange, some disappointments and some that surprise you.\n\nIf you think you’ll love every subject, you’re in for a rude shock.\n\nTake the good with the bad, and hopefully you find 4-5 subjects that inspire you – then use these as launch points for your career.\n\nLearn the fundamentals of your field\n\nIt’s important that you’re across all the basics of your chosen area, not just your favourite bits.\n\nIt’s vital that you don’t have the wool pulled over your eyes when you’re working full-time.\n\nIn my business degree, this meant everyone needed to be able to read a balance sheet, market a product, manage a team, analyse data, and understand the law – irrespective of their major.\n\nThis ensures that you won’t make any horrible mistakes or embarrass yourself out in the real world.\n\nHow to work in a group\n\nYou’re going to spend a lot of time working in groups, and it’s easy to see this as a drawback.\n\n“These idiots are ruining my grades! If they weren’t here I’d do much better on this assignment”\n\nHere’s the problem: Those idiots are the assignment.\n\nThe work you produce sucks.\n\nNobody will ever ask to see the reports you wrote at university.\n\nThis is about the skill of working with other people, even (and especially) difficult people.\n\nYou will always have to work with other people.\n\nYou won’t always get to pick who they are.\n\nLearning how to make the most of your team is invaluable, and is a skill that will stay with you forever.\n\nHow to get a high grade\n\nAt some point in your degree, you should do what it takes to get a great score.\n\nPick one of the 4-5 subjects you love, and go the extra mile.\n\nIt’s good to know how to get a high distinction, so that when you need to do something well, you have an idea as to what a good effort looks/feels like.\n\nHow to coast and get a Pass\n\n“P’s make Degrees”\n\nI hated that expression.\n\nThe problem is, there’s some truth to it.\n\nYour career is going to be full of projects that you don’t enjoy.\n\nSome of these just need to get done, and 51% is good enough.\n\nThis is the skill of not exerting yourself on the things that don’t matter to you, but still doing enough to get the job done.\n\nHow to make friends\n\nEvery university exists outside of your comfort zone.\n\nEveryone finds the first few weeks tough; when you’re meeting new people and trying to establish your own identity.\n\nThis is not a once-off event, this happens over and over again in life.\n\nWork, conferences, social events, moving suburbs, moving countries.\n\nUniversity is practice: getting comfortable with introductions, small talk, socialising over a coffee or a beer, and turning strangers into friends.\n\nThe mechanics of a great presentation\n\nSome odd people, including myself, are inspired and educated by bad presenters.\n\nYou watch them and ask yourself “What’s going wrong?”\n\nWhy isn’t this working?\n\nWhat’s wrong with their slides?\n\nWhat are they doing with their hands?\n\nThe problem with good presenters is that they make it look easy.\n\nA bad lecturer highlights the craft of public speaking, and accidentally teaches you some brilliant lessons.\n\nHow to present on your own\n\nYou will bomb a talk at some point.\n\nBefore you freak out, think about this: Where would you like it to happen?\n\nThe safest place in the world?\n\nAn 8:00 Monday morning class where nobody cares.\n\nYou will make mistakes, and if you’re sharp, will never make them again.\n\nIt will be the worst presentation you ever give, and there will be virtually zero consequences.\n\nI found that really heartening.\n\nHow to present as a group\n\nYour team will be required to give a presentation.\n\nMost read that as:\n\n“Get your whole team up the front, standing awkwardly in front of the projector, everyone waiting for their turn to read out the slides word-for-word with their backs to the audience”\n\nYou’ll make mistakes, learn the craft, and be forever stronger for having cringed so much at your own work.\n\nHow to write a report\n\nBeing able to write a good report is a useful skill.\n\nYou learn how to be interesting, make a point, and support your arguments with references.\n\nThe work itself will be terrible, and nobody will read it once it’s been graded.\n\nYou’re building a muscle, not a back catalogue.\n\nHow to bluff a report\n\nHere’s another valuable skill: being able to take a topic you know nothing about, and five hours later you have a neat 2,500-word essay with 10 different citations.\n\nSure, it won’t be the best work, but what a talent!\n\nLife is full of situations where you need to become an “Instant expert” and pretend you know more than you do.\n\nThis skill is 20% trickery, 30% creativity and 50% sheer work ethic.\n\nCross-Cultural dialogue\n\nYou will work with international students.\n\nMaybe you ARE the international student.\n\nThe temptation is to let the locals do most of the work, because their English is better.\n\nDon’t fall for it.\n\nYour career will have you working with people from all over the world.\n\nSometimes you’ll be the one that nobody understands.\n\nBy becoming patient and skilled at pushing through cultural and language barriers, you’ll make the most of your group’s talents and create better work.\n\nYou’ll also make some strong friendships and valuable contacts for the future."
