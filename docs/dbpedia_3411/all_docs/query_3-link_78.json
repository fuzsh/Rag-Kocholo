        "text": "Last week I was at the EOS Conference in San Diego üòé (I have been EVERY YEAR and now CATALYST Integrators¬Æ brings our whole team), and it was an experience that touched me deeply. What struck me most was the emphasis on inner work, a theme that resonated profoundly with me and experiencing with my team. We began with our quarterly planning session poolside üçπ on Coronado Island with my badass Integrator, Alex Hayes. There's something about the serenity of water! Together, we laid out our vision, aligning our goals with our values, setting the stage for what lies ahead this quarter. Throughout the conference, surrounded by the contagious energy of the Catalyst crew, I found myself immersed in a sea of wisdom and inspiration. From the captivating insights shared by speakers like my new friend Benny Fisher to the unparalleled wisdom of Gino Wickman (total fan girl over here), every moment felt like a revelation, a gentle nudge towards growth and harmony. One highlight that stands out in my memory is our first-ever in-person Raving Fans dinner at Puesto (the service and food was AMAZING). It was an evening filled with laughter, hugs and meaningful connections. The joy of seeing faces light up with shared enthusiasm and passion while being IN PERSON was truly heartwarming. Yet, amidst the hustle and bustle of learning and networking at the conference, there was a pivotal moment of pause at the end for the Catalyst team ‚Äîa wellness retreat designed to nurture our minds, bodies, and spirits at Saffron and Sage. It was a sacred time to replenish our energy, to reflect on the lessons learned, and to reconnect with ourselves and each other before returning home to our families. The impact of inner work AND body work cannot be overstated. It's the foundation upon which all other achievements are built. Taking the time to delve into our innermost selves, to confront our fears, and to nurture our strengths is not just beneficial‚Äîit's essential. Time for treating your body well is equally as important. üôè And in the company of like-minded individuals, the journey becomes all the more enriching and SO FUN. Looking back, I'm reminded of the profound importance of carving out space for inner work, for meaningful connections, and for moments of rest and rejuvenation. These are the ingredients that fuel our personal and professional lives, enabling us to show up fully present and engaged, both in our work and in our relationships. ü¶ã Here's to the transformative power of inner work, to the joy of shared experiences, and to the precious gift of time spent with loved ones. May we continue to prioritize our well-being and nurture the connections that enrich our lives, both in and out of the workplace. Thank you for making this an incredible experience and for being in San Diego Alex Hayes Nicole Mennicke Jeremy Walter, MBA Laura Keane Ebeling Courtney Biederbeck, MPA Lynsey Peterson we missed you Adam Holtz and Jodie Steele"
