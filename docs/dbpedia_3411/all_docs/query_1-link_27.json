        "text": "The Industry of Yesterday Will Not Sustain The Demands of Tomorrow, Or Even Next Month.\n\nLike many interesting stories, this one begins in a cozy corner bistro over dinner drinks. My wife and I had escaped both the kids and a cold, wind-whipped, November rain for our scheduled date night.\n\nLeaving the men’s room after drying off, I walked into a former colleague. We exchanged the usual small talk when he asked if I was still in the craziness of the recruiting business. Owning up that he was too, he tut-tutted me as only a New Yorker can — but he made a suggestion. He had started his own HR technology software firm and was looking for ways to automate and shorten the process of sourcing by matching resumes from internal company databases, ATS’s (Applicant Tracking Systems) and other sacred repositories of CV’s, to open jobs using AI. I was intrigued. He asked if I might be interested in seeing his operation and, it not being too far from my office, we quickly made a date to meet a few days hence.\n\nIn short order, I forgot about the appointment, my phone alerting me to the meeting. I really couldn’t spare the time but, with some optimism that I might benefit from our conversation, I headed uptown.\n\nI picked up a few good ideas, mostly tweaks for streamlining some operations, but nothing much more. I was already restless at work and it struck me that the incremental adjustments I had just heard would lead to few changes in our stale process. The problems we faced were greater than a few mods. After all, I thought, shuffling large piles of resumes into smaller more discreet piles were hardly robust enough for building trust, transparency, and accountability so desperately missing in the recruiting supply chain. Even with great software and wonderful talent, our industry as an ecology was grounded, mired in the same old business practices, laden with frustrations and populated oftentimes with recruiters, on-site vendors, managed service providers — in fact any intermediaries, like middlemen and agencies causing an extortionate amount of friction.\n\nIt was true of online job sites and computerized systems offering only one-dimensional views of candidates to the degree that we were losing talented applicants leaving job opportunities vacant because too many quality candidates would no longer tolerate the process. Frankly, the complexity and sunk costs of recruiting and placing a real champion is often more gut instinct than planning. Welcome to dysfunction junction.\n\nHowever, where some see a problem, I recognized an opportunity.\n\nInfected by the start-up bug, I began to see a vision of a better way to locate candidates and make them visible to recruiters and companies.\n\nBy way of introduction, I am Isaac Marks, a 17-year recruiting industry executive. For me, the fast pace, dynamic interplay of conversation and negotiations, the peaks and valleys that are the emotional rollercoaster of sales gets my blood rushing every morning. Yet after so many years — the last half dozen at a firm I helped grow from 10 people on billing to over 150 with significant bottom-line growth. I started questioning long-held assumptions thought to be ‘the way.’ As I stumbled through my introspection, I began to feel disdain for, and, honestly, a dislike for recruiting and the process in general. As B.B King sang, “The Thrill is Gone.” One sure thing — the recruiting supply chain is a malignant process that starts with a lie and ends with one. Further, my intuition was confirmed by hard data and extensive research that made it clear the industry was going to be disrupted. The only remaining question was, by whom?\n\nI knew we were at the precipice of an inevitable slope gliding away from the centralized, rent-seeking business model designed to insert itself between candidates and employers to extract money from the process. Further, I had seen too many similar industries either committing corporate seppuku or marching a well-trod path to destruction. Their failure to adapt doomed them to extinction. Why should anyone believe it wouldn’t happen in recruiting?\n\nSo as that became my vision of the future, I believed waiting for someone to save us was a childish fantasy. As Louis Pasteur said, “Chance favors the prepared mind.” For the next few months, with clean sheets of paper, every evening I would sit at the kitchen table\n\nmapping out what the industry should look like, what I would expect of the people and their roles I would want to work with. I knew we would need to incentivize candidates, recruiters and in fact, anyone we would invite into our ‘club’. I knew the candidate would be our new and a very demanding customer, not the employer.\n\nWhen I felt I had working documents I made three critical moves. The first and perhaps most imperative was the commitment that any firm with which I would be associated would be founded on three main principles: trust, transparency, and accountability. Once I established that core came the moment of truth. I went in search of individuals who believed as I did. I guess I underestimated the pent up loathing for the status quo just one millimeter below the surface as in short order I had my partners. Finally, I made a full-time commitment to my new vision, completely divesting myself from the company I help build over long nights, frenzied workdays, and mountains of self-examination.\n\nUltimately from a conversation in a restaurant was birthed BHIRED.\n\nOur global mission has been nothing less than the creative deconstruction of the recruiting industry. From the bones of this capsized dreadnaught, the construction of a new superstructure, a platform built on our guiding principles of trust, transparency, and accountability came to life. BHIRED’s blockchain based ecosystem will incentivize and reward accurate and timely participation in the hiring process, reduce hiring times, and help the most qualified candidates and employers efficiently find each other. Imagine no more fake profiles; recruiters and candidates cooperating on an even playing field, and an inviolate ban on chicanery. Most importantly, with ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH!\n\nOur launch date is not more than thirty days out, so I’ll be in this space every week and maybe more, detailing BHIRED, its features, and benefits and how you can be one of the first to jettison a tired system clothed in out of date processes, inevitable frustration, and blind to a contemporary blockchain platform visualizing candidates in 3D, to provide secure, incorruptible data, verified members and entities, and monetize everyone onboard ultimately recruiting the best candidates for the best jobs at the best companies.\n\nSo keep a weather eye out in this space for the next, best BHIRED news.\n\nFor instant information, reach me, Isaac Marks at isaac@bhired.com or 347–417–2002"
