        "text": "During this season of moody brooding, I remembered how much I missed you, dearest Friend and Reader, so I thought it was the perfect prompt for me to pay a brief visit to see how you’re doing. I hope that you’ve been coping well. It’s undoubtedly been a paranormal Twilight Zone for all of us, one way or another, and a sudden and abrupt halt on a path we didn’t expect. We’re only now shaking our heads and looking up around at the new landscape of our daily lives.\n\nI’m grateful to say that I’m good, and our family has been blessed by a wonderful little girl—Ruby Vera—my first grandchild, who arrived a month early in February. Of course, she’s beautiful, healthy, brilliant, wonderous, and a very old soul despite being just eight months old. I’ve been able to spend time with her a couple of days each week—and our precious rendezvous are such sacred moments and such happy respites from the din of the outside world. Ruby V makes me delighted to be me, her Mamie.\n\nBut back to the supernatural veil that’s being parted, especially for those of us who have been secretly inhabiting private spheres of loss and longing, day in and day out, for longer than we can even remember. We live with ghosts, or rather, we choose to live with our night-shades, which doesn’t leave much room –physically, emotionally, and psychically--for us to grow, explore or discover what’s on the other side of our grief. For if there is a ghost, there is grief.\n\nBelieve it or not, I find a strange comfort in stories about women, houses, and ghosts. Some of the greatest ghost stories involve houses—think about Daphne du Maurier’s astonishing novel Rebecca published in 1938. And the great Cornwall estate is known as Manderley. “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.” It was an international best-seller and has never gone out of print. Thanks to Alfred Hitchcock’s Academy Award-winning 1940 film –a stunning gothic romantic noir starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, Rebecca has become an iconic metaphor for becoming a woman. In her own life Daphne du Maurier’s Cornwall home, Menabilly, became a secret code for her life’s work which always seems inevitably bound by the extraordinary three-dimensional trinity of women, houses and, ghosts. Daphne du Maurier’s many ghostly lives were not deciphered until after her death.\n\nMy cherished All Hallows Eve solo seasonal indulgence has become a ritual of dipping into much-loved suspenseful short stories, as well as watching black and white obscure cinematic thrillers, especially English and Irish ghost stories. I cuddle on the bed with spiced hot apple cider, the cats, and a small bag of good chocolates. Pleasure is perfected if the ghost story includes a house that holds secrets. Every home tries to shelter the secrets of the woman who lived there once, in the same way, that the woman once upon a time loved the house. The American poet Louise Townsend Nicholl put it best:\n\nI gave my love to the house forever\n\nI will come till I cannot come, I said\n\nAnd the house said I will know\n\nThe Anglo-Irish writer Elizabeth Bowen is a personal favorite for ghost stories, especially her goosebump short story Hand in Glove (1952). Bowen believed that the truly scary supernatural story “lies in their being just, just out of the true.” Just out of the frame of life, lingering, observing you. Haunting. Remembering.\n\nAnother perennial favorite Hallowe’en book is Alison Lurie's collection of 9 eerie tales in Women and Ghosts. I especially love the visitation to a woman who thinks she’s marrying Mr. Right by the ghost of his first wife. How many times do former wives try to warn their successors? How many times do we not listen? This is another dreadful way to become a shroud in your own near-life experience.\n\nNow the spine-tingling dramatis personae of the American author Edith Wharton is revealed in between the lines of a long out-of-print collection of ghost stories just published by the New York Review of Books with her original preface: The Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton. Celebrated as one of the most astute and deft chroniclers of the New York upper classes during the 19th century’s Gilded Age of robber barons, which followed the Civil War, Wharton only published her first novel (The Valley of Decision 1902) when she was forty. Before then, she was an interior and landscape designer. Her famous novels were The House of Mirth(1905) and The Age of Innocence which won her the Pulitzer Prize in Literature in 1921, the first woman to do so. Still, the paranormal doesn’t immediately come to mind when one thinks of Wharton, as much as the corseted, closeted straight-laced, prim, and proper prose does. Still, when she put together a collection of her ghostly short stories written between 1902 to 1937, she let the figments of unfulfilled passion and desire out into the shivery night where they belonged.\n\nThe last three decades of Wharton’s life were lived as an American ex-pat residing in France with an apartment in Paris and a house that had been a 17th-century convent built on a hillside overlooking the Mediterranean called Hyéres in the south of France. Wharton was a complicated woman, as was Daphne du Maurier, Elizabeth Bowen, and us all, leading many secret lives that were only revealed after their deaths—and hence they lived with ghosts all their lives. But now, their ghosts can become sources of inspiration for those of us who will read between their lines.\n\nEdith Wharton confides: “I have sometimes thought that a woman’s nature is like a great house full of rooms: there is the hall, through which everyone passes in going in and out; the drawing-room, where one receives formal visits; the sitting-room, where the members of the family come and go as they like; but beyond that far beyond, are the other rooms, the handles of whose doors perhaps are never turned; no one knows the way to them, no one knows whither they lead; and in the innermost room, the holy of holies, the soul sits alone and waits for a footstep that never comes.”\n\nIn her autobiography, A Backwards Glance, Wharton confesses: “Years ago I said to myself: “There’s no such thing as old age, there is only sorrow.”… I have learned with the passing of time that this, though true, is not the whole truth. The other producer of old age is habit: the deathly process of doing the same thing in the same way at the same hour day after day, first from carelessness, then from inclination, at last from cowardice or inertia. Luckily, the inconsequential life is not the only alternative; for caprice is as ruinous as routine. Habit is necessary; it is the habit of having habits, of turning a trail into a rut, that must be incessantly fought against if one is to remain alive.\n\n“In spite of illness, in spite even of the arch-enemy sorrow, one can remain alive long past the usual date of disintegration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways.”\n\nPerhaps women adore ghost stories because we have such a difficult time letting go. Bring up the topic of ghosts at any dinner party, and most of the female guests will be able to contribute an anecdote of a sighting or a haunting, usually set in old houses.\n\nBut “objects have ghostly emanations, too that attach themselves to their solidity,” the writer Dominique Browning tells us in her marvelous book, Around the House and In the Garden: A Memoir of Heartbreak, Healing, and Home Improvement. “Things with drawers—chest, armoires, night tables, trunks—seem to be most populated pieces of furniture.”\n\nI have had a difficult time leaving my beloved home Newton’s Chapel, in England. It has been twelve years since the severing, made even more acute because I stored my belonging in containers on both sides of the Atlantic for all this time, paying the equivalent of a mortgage to house boxes instead of myself.\n\nThe medical-intuitive (a spiritual diagnostician) Caroline Myss, a pioneer in the field of energy medicine and human consciousness, tells us that when we know we are supposed to move on or out of a situation that is stunting our soul’s growth, and we consciously refuse to do so because the unchartered terror of choice and change scares us, a celestial clock starts ticking. “If you’re getting directions, ‘Move on with your life, let go of something,’ then do it. Have the courage to do it. This is the way it is. When you let go of something, it’s sort of like a time warning that says,’ You have ten days left. After that, your angel’s going to do it.’ So, the desire to hold on is not going to stop the process of change…You know that’s true.”\n\nI’ll never forget the moment I heard her tell me that while listening to her audiotape Spiritual Madness: The Necessity of Meeting God in Darkness. Isn’t that interesting? I thought…I wonder if she’s right. Ten days later, my life was lying in smithereens around my ankles, and I was shaking my head, terrified, stunned, and incredulous in the presence of passion and betrayal. When you hear, see, read, or intuit your authentic truth, pay attention. You can run, but you cannot hide, especially from your ghosts.\n\nSo as Halloween turns into the season of November’s All Souls Day and Thanksgiving, I’m beginning to sort through a one-bedroom apartment and two garages full to the brim of mysterious brown boxes. It’s the remainder of all I strived with every fiber of my being to hold on to—the remains of the days of my English dream—linens, rugs, paintings, personal objects, a few antiques, and probably more throw pillows than any sane woman should own, but that’s another story for another day.\n\nI know that half of my collection will go to another auction. Still, this time I’m hoping that I don’t hover like a ghostly spirit wanting to share the item’s unique history but prevented from the Other Side, mixed in with the distress that something you found priceless is now somebody else’s bargain.\n\nThese boxes hold all the things I’ve loved, collected over a lifetime, and used to create a beautiful home for myself and my daughter; the antique beds and their William Morris canopies, the grandfather clock, the 17th century carved mirror that hung in the nave of Newton’s Chapel, the stunning sculpture of Sir Isaac Newton by the marvelous English sculptor Graeme Mitcheson; the Arts and Crafts chandelier and furniture designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and created by the Glasgow Art School from his original drawings. I was such a lucky woman to be able to work with so many artists. I am so grateful for the blessing of living in such a beautiful home that cherished the past and nurtured our souls. No more than now, I suppose, when I have chosen to let go.\n\nI never told you that gratitude had to be expressed with big smiles. I (hope) that the “thank you” offered in defeat, disillusionment, disappointment, and despair are the most treasured because they are priceless tokens of trust, especially when trusting Heaven is the last thing in the world you want to do. I hope there is another home I will be led to and will love, but I also know that I can’t keep looking back anymore if I want to find it. Nor can you. I finally understand the Biblical story of poor Lot’s wife, who was warned not to look back as angels were leading her family to safety—evacuating a cataclysmic disaster—as many of you have had to do in these last few calamitic years. But she did turn back to look one more time at all she was leaving and losing and was turned into a pillar of salt. The salt was from her tears.\n\n“Only in a house where one has learnt to be lonely does one have this solicitude for things,” Elizabeth Bowen confessed in her masterpiece The Death of the Heart (1938). One’s relation to them, the daily seeing or touching, begins to become love, and to lay one open to pain.” Bowen struggled her entire life to keep her family’s old Irish home Bowen’s Court; she had a nervous breakdown over unpaid bills in the 1950s. After she “recovered” she lectured and taught in the States to keep it going. Finally, she was forced to sell and then lived to see her beloved home torn down and razed to the ground. She spent the rest of her life living in hotels or with friends. I know I’m at a new threshold, and I pray to move through this change with as much grace and grit as Daphne du Maurier, Edith Wharton, and Elizabeth Bowen did in tweed suits, pearls, and heels. When I look at the courageous women who have gone before me—I call them my Swell Dames—they offer me a hand to help and guide me as I begin again. I feel such a deep connection with these women with a past because, as Bowen said, their ghosts are “just out of being true.”\n\nSo, if you have to let go, move on and begin again, you’ve come to the right friend, who’s learned that loving and losing are both sides of our ghost stories: the Here and After.\n\n“I have tried to give away some of the things in my house that have ghosts; I think they would be better off somewhere else, and I want to be rid of certain memories,” Dominique Browning confesses, indeed for all of us. “…the armoire that was part of a marriage, the carpet that was part of a love affair, the photograph that was part of hope, the bedcovers that were part of too many sleepless nights. Begone.”\n\nOffering a shoulder and one last loving, lingering look at whatever in your life is the long goodbye. May you be safe and sheltered in the embrace of Mother Plenty and guided by the Master Builder, and may you soon find your path to the hearth waiting in your heart. You have no idea how much I love you, and I am grateful for your calling me back into the world. I’ll keep the stories coming. May there be good chocolate in your future. Blessings on your courage and always, cherished friend and reader, dearest love.\n\nXO SBB\n\nJust two weeks after celebrating the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, much of the country was abruptly under a quarantine, against wearing masks and angry that they weren’t celebrating the Thanksgiving they had anticipated after winning the war to end all wars. Yet America, along with the rest of the world, was suddenly battling an invisible enemy-- The Spanish Flu—the deadliest pandemic since the “Black Death” plague of the middle ages—and Thanksgiving 1919 would be postponed as well.\n\nYou might be approaching this Thanksgiving with dread in your heart for the future and sorrow for what has happened this past year and unfortunately continues to happen every day. The deadly Covid virus now spreads beyond our comprehension with double the deaths on our Homefront in nine months than four years in the French trenches.\n\nWhen deep discouragement comes, I comfort myself by thinking of the long line of heroic women who came before us. For we are not the only women who have known difficult times, survived them and started over. I find solace drawing upon the wisdom and strength of generations of women who died before we lived—our pilgrim mothers, the pioneer women on wagon trains, native American mothers, enslaved African women who became freed African-Americans; wild west immigrant homesteaders, migrant Hispanic women, European and Russian Jewish refugees, Asian mothers crossing the Pacific and young Irish women like my Nana, Rose, carrying a baby in one arm and a suitcase in the other. I think of my Kentucky Granny, Lucy Eliza Lyttle Donnelly, rolling out biscuit dough in her salmon-pink chenille bathrobe. The world could end tomorrow, but come what may, there would always be fresh hot biscuits for breakfast. These extraordinary women have come to represent grace under pressure in the archives of my heart.\n\nWe need to remember that to be one woman is to be all women. That all women are endowed with a blessed DNA—the genetic code of courage, ingenuity, creativity, perseverance and determination. Our Destiny, Nature and Aspirations are Heaven endowed, so why wouldn’t we be given the spiritual wherewithal to fulfill them?\n\nWe have and it’s called Moxie. I want you to think of a woman’s spiritual Moxie as an indomitable feminine strength hidden in the secret recesses of our hearts; small time-capsules containing the seeds of resilience, restoration, and self-reliance that grows best from the ashes of its previous existence, like the giant Sequoia trees in California.\n\nI love the word Moxie. It’s great American slang—a noun that means grit, gumption, sass, pluck, know-how, nerve and verve. I love its exhilarating combination. Originally coined as the brand name for a non-alcoholic health drink in 1885, Moxie was good for whatever ailed you especially if you were shy and modest. And while at times we can feel fraught, frazzled, fragile, frightened and worn to a raveling as we think about the future, Divine Grace always knew we would come to this turning point—the choice between giving up life and our dreams or going forward with just one tiny step. Accessing our own Moxie was designed for this very moment.\n\nThink of Moxie as a feminine force that can only occur when two separate elements—inexhaustible courage and stubborn faith—are mixed. Through the spontaneous combustion of necessity and passion they create an entirely new compound: steely determination. Now ponder an irresistible force meeting an immovable object, and you’ve got the spiritual Moxieof your Authentic Self pushing through everything standing in the way of your happiness.\n\nOnly after we have been broken and emptied of all pretenses; only when we’ve faced heart-wrenching reckonings and impossible situations; only when the only opinions that matters are the Great Creator’s and your own, only when you remember who you were before the world shaped you into an acceptable version of who you should be, only then, do we become our Authentic Selves.\n\nThis is the Thanksgiving to gratefully take stock of what was working in your life and what wasn’t. Could the disguised blessing of this horrible pandemic be the opportunity to be ruthlessly honest, both inwardly and outwardly and make different choices about how we would like to go forward? Last Thanksgiving, the 25th anniversary of Simple Abundance which I rewrote and updated for the women we are today was published. I wanted to help both of us discover more moments of contentment than distress in this ghastly 24/7 “Breaking News” culture. I hoped we could encounter everyday epiphanies, find the Sacred in the ordinary, the Mystical in the mundane, and fully enter into the sacrament of the present moment, even if we’re alone and eating a turkey sandwich.\n\n“Don't you love being alive?\" asked Miranda. \"Don't you love weather and the colors at different times of the day, and all the sounds and noises like children screaming in the next lot, and automobile horns and little bands playing in the street and the smell of food cooking?,” Katherine Anne Porter asks in her 1939 novel Pale Horse, Pale Rider, one of the few novels to explore the Spanish flu through the changed destiny of a couple who have just fallen in love.\n\nThis Thanksgiving will be different from those we have shared in the past. But hopefully in the days to come you will make the thrilling discovery that everything in your life is significant enough to be a continuous source of reflection, reconnection and revelation. Even wearing a mask.\n\nSending dearest love and blessings on your courage.\n\nXO SBB\n\nI’ve been having a recurring dream (rather feverish, too) over the last few days, where I’m at a certain crossroad on the way to Jerusalem with hundreds of other pilgrims during the Crusades but at different time periods (there were three Crusades during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries). I ask every pilgrim I can find “Do you know how long this is going to last? All I want is the truth. I just need to know. How long is this going to last?”\n\nNo one answers back. They continue silently down the hot, dusty road ahead. I’m stuck standing at the crossroads.\n\nFinally, a group of Templar knights come along, and I ask them the same thing. There is low, groaning acknowledgement with grim and ironic laughter. Everyone is wearing armor and chain mail and I can’t see anyone’s face. One of the knights extends his arm to hoist me up on his horse and says: “Let’s find out together.” This is where I always wake up. On a horse with a strange, unknown knight headed to the Holy Land and knowing nothing.\n\nWe’ve been under lock-down for four weeks now, and the different stages of human grief and loss are beginning to play out around the world in our own personal pattern and collective ways while heroic health care professionals, first responders and essential service workers are keeping thousands of people alive and the rest of us safe. We have become fluent in the realm of the unspeakable.\n\nThe 13th German mystic Meister Eckhart tells us, “If the only prayer you ever say is “Thank You” it will be enough.” I’m not quite sure if that’s correct when we’re talking about the bravery of those on the front lines of this horrendous pandemic. But thank you. Bless you and your families.\n\nAs the bubble wrap of shock and denial has begun to shift, I still want the answer to how long is this going to last? Just give me the time frame. If I have a time span, then I can cope. Everyday I look for answers to my question and every night I go to bed as befuddled and bewildered as when I woke up.\n\nNot knowing anything (except that we weren’t prepared to begin quarantine and still aren’t prepared to end it) has left me confused, disoriented, incredulous and no doubt weighing a few extra pounds since discovering the medicinal power of Trader Joe’s “This Blueberry Walked In to a Bar” cereal rations. However, I don’t want to continue stuffing my anxiety into my mouth and really feel much better when my comfy pants aren’t tight. But I also really want to get a grip on whatever positive ephemeral emotions I can snatch and grab and process, such as “possibility.” But the gift of possibility requires a foundation of patience.\n\nPatience is the art of waiting. Like all high arts, it takes time to master, which shouldn’t be surprising, since patience is the knowledge of time and cycles. How to use time to your advantage, how to be ready before the crisis appears, how to be at the right place at the right time, how to pick your moments, how to bite your tongue. Patience is discovering the mysterious pattern of cycles that cradle the Universe because everything that has happened once will recur. Few humans learn the lessons first time around. Why else the philosopher’s warning that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it? The History channel has created a timeline of 16 deadly pandemics over the last two thousand years for skeptics.\n\nBut it’s the possibility I want to embrace today. I want to acknowledge, accept and give thanks for each and every possibility I discover or rediscover during this expanse of interim time.\n\nPerhaps a blessing each of us could hold onto during this quarantine, is the remembrance of prior passions that we abandoned because they weren’t practical. It’s quite illuminating to discover that often what a woman calls the search for true love isn’t a hankering for another person. It really turns out to be the suppressed desire to do something that she loves, something that makes her feel alive and joyful. I’ve rarely had as much joy in my life as the weekend I spent learning on the job how to midwife rare breed pregnant ewes (female in sheep speak) by doing it, rubber gloves up to my shoulders. A weekend and 80 newborn lambs later, I could barely move and spent two days sleeping. But it was the best sleep I’d had since the night my own beautiful lamb, my own baby girl, was born. There’s a soulful connection there, and I’ll find it.\n\nA friend sent me a marvelous link to an article in the New York Times by the restaurant critic Pete Wells featuring the wonderful sustainable farming practice of Shafer Vineyards in Napa Valley, California. They use flocks of sheep to graze the grass growing between their vines. The YouTube clip is over 6 hours long and is called “Relax with Sheep”. As Wells recommends, I also love to keep the browser tab open listening to the balm of baaing, then sitting straight up in wonderment because I can still identify a lamb’s bleating, just as I did once, well, it seems like only yesterday, but time is fluid right now, so it could have been centuries past.\n\nSuddenly and inexplicably, more often than anyone ever suspects, life stuns us with loss. A phone call in the middle of the night, a TV bulletin across the screen, a pounding at the door or a raging invisible pandemic that sweeps around the world in less than eighty days, ravishing and destroying lives faster than we can count. And what was, only a moment ago—what we took for granted—serenity, sanity, security, safety, sameness, the sacred ordinary—has been ruthlessly snatched away. Now we are left helplessly behind—bewildered, bereft, and incredulous at the unimaginable facing us--as we take a number in the waiting room of heartbreak.\n\nThe litany of loss seems enormous, the chasm between our past and our future fathomless. Will tomorrow be another day?\n\nThere are simply no words to express, or to console or encourage and yet, I can’t not write to you. In the realm of the unspeakable, there are no countries now. No politics. No borders. No outsiders. No wall, nor fences stops the Pale Rider we were warned about. When was that? Oh, only two thousand years ago. It seems like yesterday.\n\nThere’s no explanation, no reasoning, no self-help mantra, no belief big enough to surmount the anguish so many people feel at this moment. There’s no secret on earth to help us come to grips with the vast unknown. And yet, for hope, for inspiration look at the bravery of our First Responders, our doctors, our nurses and hospital staff—our heroes and heroines in the trenches and on the front lines, all the people rushing to help. God bless you and your families. Thank you for your courage and compassion. You are collectively our Comforters in Chief.\n\nI’ve written for twenty five years about the power of Gratitude to change our lives for the better. It’s easy to be grateful and to write about gratitude when life hums—when there’s money in the bank, when you’re healthy and have a roof over your head. But what I’ve not shared or written about enough is how Gratitude’s mystical power is greatest when She holds us together even as we’re falling apart—when a global pandemic forces you to the unemployment line, makes you afraid to go to work, or take a loved one to the ICU.\n\nBecause ironically, Gratitude’s most profound mysteries are revealed when we are struggling; during personal turmoil and overcome with doubt. Gratitude fills in the gaps. When we stumble in the darkness, rage in anger at the unfairness and throw faith across the room. When we abandon all hope and cry ourselves to sleep, Gratitude waits patiently to console and reassure us that we will get through whatever it is that we think we can’t or won’t get over, and if we can’t get over it, we will, eventually get through it.\n\nThe Bible instructs us “to give thanks in all circumstances,” but it doesn’t tell us we have to be smiling while we say it. In Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faiths, tears have always been considered one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Talmud teaches that “Even when the gates of Heaven are closed to prayers, they are open to tears” and in the Hebrew Old Testament, an entire book of the Bible is devoted to crying—the Book of Lamentations. And the Psalmist (56:8) recalls that “You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.” What book might that be?\n\nCould it be a Divine Gratitude Journal?\n\nOur most profound lessons about the meaning of life, love, goodness and courage are revealed when physicians and nurses put plastic garbage bags around themselves to nurse us. When paramedics, ambulance drivers, fire fighters and police rush in to carry us to safety. When the military sets up field hospitals in our parks. When industry pivots to make protective and life sustaining medical supplies before profits. When the woman who owns the shuttered boutique you so love begins to sew masks. When public health physicians tell us to shelter in place and we stay home so that our blessed health care comforters can save our lives without losing their own.\n\nWe’re all scared. Being scared is a sacred warning signal triggered to keep you and yours out of harm’s way. Just change the position of the letters “a” and “c” and scared becomes sacred. Being scared is a primordial instinct meant to keep you alive in dangerous situations until you can get the hell out of them. The more scared I am about any situation or circumstance, the more imperative it is for me to acknowledge it, face it, and learn how to push through to overcome it—and today I must do that by staying at home and writing to you.\n\nThere is a story of a woman who lost her only child and was left shattered, inconsolable, and alone. She went to the Buddha to ask his help in healing her wounded spirit. If he couldn’t help her, she would follow her only child to the grave and forgo her destiny. She would not, could not, continue to live this way. The Buddha agreed to help but told the mother she must first bring him back a mustard seed from a house that had never known sorrow. And so the woman set out to find one. Her search took her a long time. She went from house to house all over the world but there was not one that had never entertained grief as a guest. However, because every house knew what her pain felt like, they wanted to give her a gift to help ease her anguish. It could not make it go away, but it might help.\n\nWhen the woman returned home she opened her heart and showed the Buddha what she had been given: acceptance, forbearance, understanding, gratitude, courage, compassion, hope, truth, empathy, remembrance, strength, tenderness, wisdom and love. “The gifts were given to help me,” she told him.\n\n“Ah, they were? And how do you feel now?” he asked the woman.\n\n“Different. Heavier. Each gift comforts me in its own way, but there were so many I had to enlarge my heart to carry them all and they make me feel sated. What is this strange full feeling?”\n\n“Sorrow.”\n\n“You mean I’m like the others now?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Buddha softly. “You are no longer alone.”\n\nAnd neither are you. In the realm of the unspeakable, we are becoming fluent. Gracias. Grazie. Merci. Danke. Mesi. Tapadh leat. Go raibh maith agat. Tack. Tak skal du have. Hvala vam. Adank.\n\nTell me please, how to say thank you in your dialect, so you can hear me.\n\nDearest love and blessings on their courage and our own.\n\nAnd a heartfelt Thank you.\n\nXO SBB\n\nIn November 1929, just one month after the famous stock market crash which set in motion the Great Depression, an editorial in The Household Magazine encouraged their readers to take heart and have courage as they faced the unknown.\n\n“Thanksgiving Day was meant to be something more than a mere period of time between Wednesday and Friday of the last week in November. It may be something more than a holiday, or it may have none of the characteristics of one. What it is depends on the state of mind.”\n\nBy the third Thanksgiving of the Great Depression in November 1932, American homemakers and the women’s magazines they read had passed through the same desperate psychological stages a person experiencing profound loss endures—shock, denial, anger, bargaining and great grief –before settling in for what is often the longest stage of any traumatic change—depression. A new Democratic president-elect, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was getting ready to take over the White House, but it would be another few months before FDR’s rousing Inaugural Address reminded Americans that \"all we have to fear is fear itself.”\n\nThere would be seven more lean Thanksgivings of economic uncertainty followed by five years of the world at war. How did our grandmothers and great-grandmothers drag themselves out of bed to make biscuits for breakfast? An image of my Kentucky Granny rolling out dough in her salmon-pink chenille bathrobe and slippers has come to represent grace under pressure in the archives of my heart.\n\nYou might have approached this Thanksgiving with dread for the future and sorrow for what is happening now. When deep discouragement comes, I comfort myself by thinking of the long line of heroic women who came before me—not only those in my family, but every woman settler, explorer, adventurer, native American mother and prairie homemaker, who tamed wild lands and wild times to make homes for those they loved. I particularly love to meditate on the first band of Pilgrim women.\n\nThere were 18 women on the Mayflower, and although none of them died during the crossing from England to Massachusetts; by the time of the first “Thanks Giving” meal, a year later in 1621, there were only 4 women who had survived the brutal winter, spring sowing and autumn harvest. Four very tired women who needed to take care of 50 men and children daily.\n\nWith the men almost entirely focused on building houses and the village, the women had so many chores, they performed in shifts. For aside from cleaning and cooking, there was plowing and planting, preserving and putting away, caring for livestock, making soap and candles from tallow (animal fat), tending the sick and creating herb medicinals. There was so much work that they lived on one portion’s grace and if they didn’t drop down dead with their hand to the plow or wither away in a nighttime sweat from a succession of diseases contracted on the voyage, they took it as a sign that God meant for them to go on. And you know what, they were right.\n\nI love the bare bones simplicity of this truth. Sometimes in life, all we can do is put one foot out of the bed and then in front of the other, literally. I figure if you wake up in the morning, you’re meant to go on—continue at what you’re doing and ask Heaven to show you what you’re doing wrong, if you are. Ask for confirmation of what you’re doing right. Ask for what you need and want. Ask to be taught the right questions. Ask to be answered. Ask for the Divine Plan of your life to unfold through joy. Ask politely. Ask with passion. But ask! Ask to be heard. Ask for a blessed respite from daily crises. While you’re at it, ask for a deeply personal miracle—you know, the one you need so much you’re afraid to even pray for it? But if we can’t learn to ask for help, we’re going to be left on our own.\n\nWhat do you think the prayers of the Pilgrim women were? How about, “Please God, help me.” Thank you that I’m here, but why? How can four women take care of 50 men and children?” Well, those sound like pretty good openers.\n\nHere’s what I prayed for this Thanksgiving. May Heaven help us both understand this truth so deeply that it becomes sacred marrow that needs no words. Soul memory. Women are born with a blessed DNA—the genetic code of resilience, strength, ingenuity, creativity, perseverance and determination—that is what I call feminine spiritual moxie. Our Destiny, Nature and Aspirations are Divinely endowed, so why wouldn’t we be given the wherewithal to fulfill them?\n\nWhile our historical attention is drawn to the pilgrims and early settlers of this wild and beautiful land, we cannot overlook the women who were here before the pilgrims arrived. Author Dina Gilio-Whitaker, an Indigenous researcher and activist broadens our horizons on the heroism and humanity of Native American women. Dina shares the authentic stories of Native American women we should know more about, such as Nanye-hi (Nancy Ward) a cherished Cherokee leader granted the designation of Ghigau, which Dina explains, means “most beloved woman” and also “war woman.” As Ghigau, she sat in council meetings among both the war and peace chiefs. “Nanye-hi was in reality a diplomat of the highest order. In negotiations for the Treaty of Holston in 1781 she famously reminded U.S. treaty commissioners that “…we are your mothers; you are our sons.’”\n\nSo this Thanksgiving week whenever anything happens that triggers the feeling of angst or distress, take a deep breath and silently ask yourself a few questions as I do when I’m in the midst of trying to do everything and accomplishing nothing:\n\nIs my family safe today?\n\nIs there a roof over our heads today?\n\nDid I have to chop wood to keep warm today?\n\nTomorrow will I have to carry water from a creek 2 miles away?\n\nDid I have to shoot the turkey for our meal today?\n\nSadly, what has fallen through the cracks of social and domestic history over the last seventy years is the very sacred need to keep up women’s morale on the home front through whatever social, political, or economic turmoil or upheaval we are going through and every decade brings what seems like a new one. But they’re not because we haven’t learned very much from history and until we do and history becomes herstory, we’re going to continue experiencing cosmic déjà vu.\n\nWomen have always cared for the world, one way or another, but we still don’t know how to take care of ourselves. If we can’t do one, then we can’t do the other. I just love to share with you what I’m seeking: Divine connection and the courage to go on, wherever the pioneer trails lead us. We will not, cannot forget the legacy of loved passed down to us, our daughters, and granddaughters, from generations of beautiful, brave, and heroic women from centuries before, who reach through the portcullis of the past watching over us and encouraging us to go on, further than they could even imagine.\n\nSo come, my grateful sisters, come to gather together. Offer grace for the bounty of goodness. Raise the song of harvest home, the glass of good cheer, the heart overflowing with joy. We have so much for which to be thankful, so much about which to smile, so much to share. So much, that in this season of plenty, we can embrace the season of relinquishment. All we have is all we need.\n\nBut let us ask for one thing more: the gift of grateful hearts that will not forget what God has already done in our lives. Not only invited us to the feast, but made us feel so blessed and welcomed, we have the moxie to ask, please Mother Plenty, can I have some more?\n\nMay peace and plenty always be your portion. With dearest love, thanks for your sharing my words with other women that you love and blessings on your courage.\n\nXO SBB\n\nSuddenly and inexplicably, more often than anyone ever suspects, life stuns us with loss. A phone call in the middle of the night, a TV bulletin across the screen, a pounding at the door… and what was, only a moment ago—and what we took for granted—serenity, sanity, security, safety, sameness—is ruthlessly snatched away, blown to smithereens, engulfed by a wave or burned to the ground. And we are left helplessly behind—bewildered, bereft, and incredulous at the unimaginable now facing us--as we take a number in the waiting room of heartbreak.\n\nThis has been a shattering two weeks for many of us in California. Wildfires have raged, ravished and destroyed lives, homes and businesses. Paradise, an entire town of 26,000 souls, has been razed to the ground in dust and disbelief. Some have lost loved ones, most have lost their homes. All must start over now. The litany of loss seems enormous, the chasm between the past and the future fathomless.\n\nThere are simply no words to express, or to console or encourage and yet, I can’t not write to you. There’s no explanation, no reasoning, no self-help mantra, no belief big enough to surmount the anguish so many people feel at this moment. There’s no secret on earth to help you come to grips with the vast unknown. And yet, for hope, for inspiration look at the bravery of the first responders, those on the ground and in the air: the fire-fighters, police, paramedics, rescue pilots, ambulance drivers and the school bus driver who delivered 20 children safely home, all the people rushing to help. God bless you and your families. You are our heroes and heroines. Thank you for your courage and compassion. You are collectively our Comforters in Chief.\n\nI’ve written for twenty years about the power of Gratitude to change our lives for the better. It’s easy to be grateful and to write about gratitude when life hums—when there’s money in the bank, you’re healthy and have a roof over your head. But what I’ve not shared or written about enough is how Gratitude’s mystical power is greatest when She holds us together even as we’re falling apart.\n\nBecause ironically, Gratitude’s most profound mysteries are revealed when we are struggling during personal turmoil and overcome with doubt. Gratitude fills in the gaps. When we stumble in the darkness, rage in anger at the unfairness and throw faith across the room. When we abandon all hope and cry ourselves to sleep, Gratitude waits patiently to console and reassure us that we will get through whatever it is that we think we can’t or won’t get over, and if we can’t get over it, we will, eventually get through it.\n\nThe Bible instructs us “to give thanks in all circumstances,” but it doesn’t tell us we have to be smiling while we say it. In Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faiths, tears have always been considered one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Talmud teaches that “Even when the gates of Heaven are closed to prayers, they are open to tears” and in the Hebrew Old Testament, an entire book of the Bible is devoted to crying—the Book of Lamentations. And the Psalmist (56:8) recalls that “You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.” What book might that be?\n\nCould it be a Divine Gratitude Journal?\n\nOnce during a season of devastating loss, I forced out a sarcastic litany of “thanks” because I knew it was the only way that I could mourn and move on (the downside of spiritual law no one ever talks about is once you understand a lesson, you can’t play dumb). “There I’ve thanked you for my misery and pain. Are you happy now? But don’t you dare come near me,” I cried, holding up my hand to Heaven in defiance, pushing away the very Love I needed most. “So, thanks a million. Now you go your way and I’ll go mine.”\n\nNaked, complete, bitter surrender. But only because I’d been beaten senseless by sorrow. Sometime in order to bridge the chasm between our hearts and our souls, Spirit takes no prisoners. Almost immediately I was enwrapped in a surreal sense of peace which certainly passed my feeble capacity for understanding and it still does. I became genuinely grateful to have been carried off the battlefield of dumbfounded disbelief by a Source of power, wisdom, strength and love far greater than my own. Within a short time, the trajectory of my life was forever altered in miraculous ways. First the gesture, then the grace.\n\nMy most profound lessons about life, love, goodness and courage were revealed by Gratitude when Heaven and I were barely on speaking terms. If you read this now and think you aren’t ready for any thanksgiving this year, then I wrap you in my arms and reassure you that is okay. Heaven doesn’t keep score and Gratitude doesn’t keep count, other than to lift us up off the mat before Life’s referee calls us out.\n\nSending dearest love and blessings on your courage. And wishing you and yours safe passage to peace and plenty.\n\nXO SBB\n\nRecently I went back to read the Simple Abundance meditations I wrote for the Christmas season. I was surprised by how little had changed in my emotional response on the annual miracles women of all faiths perform during the holiday season. But December is the month of miracles. The oil that burnt for eight days. The royal son born in a stable. The inexplicable return of Light on the longest, darkest night of the year. As Willa Cather reassures us, “Where there is great love, there are always miracles.” Let’s believe her. If there’s ever been a year we all need to believe in a benevolent Giver of all Good, it’s this holiday season.\n\nGlancing back in a Dickensian kind of way, hovering over the scene with the Ghost of Christmas Past, I can see a mother of a young daughter. She’s writing in tiny room, the size of a closet and working at an old word processor, so ancient that quills and parchment would have been an upgrade; the monthly check-ups at the local computer shop came out of her grocery money, To make things worse, I’d been working on “The Book” for so long it had virtually became the fourth member of our family. I’m surprised I didn’t keep a place setting for her at the dining room table.\n\nI had been struggling over two years. I was supposed to be a paid working mother and it had been a long time between paychecks. Constant discouragement and I got to know each other very well during that time. There’s a certain turn of the screw that only 30 rejections from every major publisher in the US can trigger. People in your life begin to ask, not unreasonably mind you, if it’s not time to get a “real job.\" I had published two previous books and had been a nationally syndicated writer; I had been paid to write before. So the reasons? Simplicity wasn’t commercial, and a lifestyle book based on Gratitude? Forget it.”\n\nSome of the letters were so harsh, they still makes me wince.\n\nThere were some days when I didn’t want to get out of bed, but I had to make breakfast, lunch and do carpool. There were also many long, dark nights of the soul when I cried in the shower or into my pillow, trying to keep the self doubt and despair to myself. Then one day Katie asked me if would mail a letter for her, written not to Santa Claus but to Heaven. Of course, I read it and then promptly posted it in my heart. Babes-- you’re only kidding yourself if you think children don’t hear or know when Mom’s unhappy The letter read:\n\nDear Guardian Angel,\n\nThis prayer is not for me, it is for my Mom. Please Angel, let my Mom get a book contract. Please talk to the Guardian Angels of the People who decide about publishing ….\n\nThere’s nothing much you can do after reading something like this except start crying again, pull yourself together and get back to work. Start writing another meditation (like December 10th’ Gifts of the Magi). Eventually the thoughts, words, sentences, paragraphs and pages begin to accumulate and accelerate; propelled by your time, creative energy and emotion until the “Work” achieves the momentum it needs and breaks through your personal velocity to become strong enough to exist on her own.\n\nBy now, I had empirical proof of the power of Gratitude to change one’s disposition from pessimist to optimist, because back then I wasn’t just writing about Simple Abundance, I was living it. I was my own Research and Development Laboratory. I knew they were wrong. Still, two years into any project that the world’s not buying, and you either become a cynic and give up or get really stubborn. Guess which one was my choice? I made up a mockup of a New York Times Best Seller list and dated it for June 1996, three years in the future. I taped it to the word processor screen and spoke the words “Just watch me” before I started each day’s assignment. Later I discovered to my delight that Sir Isaac Newton also experimented on himself, as did Madame Marie Curie, the only person to win the Nobel Prize twice and Dr. Jonas Salk with his polio vaccine. I was in good company.\n\nAnd so I wrote Simple Abundance (and beat my own best seller deadline by two months) but the creative truth I want to share with you is that Simple Abundance really wrote me. As I learned how to use the wondrous power of Gratitude, Simplicity and Order to ground me in my daily round, I discovered that I could be open to the spontaneous occasions that revealed Harmony, Beauty and Joy surrounding me. The results seemed miraculous.\n\nThey still do. When I use the saving graces of Simple Abundance actively, especially when I’m worn to a raveling trying to balance work deadlines with the advancing holiday merrymaking, limited budget and finding a new home, I’m amazed at how I can cope with rising to an occasion I hadn’t expected. I’m thrilled that I can take another look around at my circumstances and figure it out. Or wait it out. Accept things for now. All I have is all I need today, except the realization of how much I have. Thank You.\n\nNow when I think of all the blessings that have arrived in my life wrapped in brown paper and string—as necessities instead of indulgences—it really makes me feel both humbled and incredulous. Believe me, I never wanted any of those blessings disguised as disappointment and despair. I would have refused to accept them and returned them to Sender, if I’d only known how to do it. But what I’ve finally learned is that if there is a gift in disguise, then there must be a Giver. What makes this all the more poignant is that when we stop to consider this, the truth is, it’s always been so. Christmas and great need are inseparable, as intertwined as hope and faith or the holly and the ivy. Remember we’re told “Now faith is the substance of things sought for, the evidence of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1)\n\nSome of you, my dearest ones, have been Simple Abundance kindred spirits for many years now. Other readers are new, finding me by happy coincidence or on the recommendation of a family member or friend. What we’re all seeking (me included!) is a respite from all the crises, and a succession of contented moments.\n\nSo shall we try a little holiday ritual together? Invite the Simple Abundance Graces to intervene in our daily round and show us just how “real” Divine assistance is, here and now. Asking for help is a woman’s toughest personal challenge, at least it still is for me. But here is a spiritual law (and gift) for the ages, especially this Christmas Present. We have to ask before we receive. Ask, Ask, Ask. (June 3). Trust me, if there’s a meditation in Simple Abundance, I lived it and took really good notes.\n\nI don’t suppose anyone has called you self-centered recently?\n\nWhy would they? Can you even remember the last time you considered your preferences before anyone else’s? Didn’t think so. Hey, Babe, you’re not alone.\n\nMost women recoil from the thought of personal descriptions that begin with the word “Self”, which is too bad because this self-defeating modesty eliminates a lot of flattering ones: self-poise, self-assured, self-confident. So why do we self-consciously shrink from self-admiration? Enquiring minds want to know. Well, probably ever since your hand was slapped reaching for the last cookie on the plate all those years ago, you’ve viewed satisfying your healthy wants and lusty needs as selfish and shameful.\n\nBut now that you’re all grown up, how about rediscovering how glorious you really are? It’s time to realize that the cheeks that once burned with embarrassment can now radiate with the vibrant glow of a self-possessed woman.\n\nI believe that there are three secret wounds to the feminine soul which I explored in my book Something More: Excavating Your Authentic Self: self-avoidance, betrayal, and marital indifference. At first you might think that this is not a book for you. Guess what? So did I, and I was the one writing it.\n\nWe have none of these problems. We have a beautiful home, a family we adore and work that we enjoy and fulfills us. So why then, do we secretly sense that there's got to be Something More to why we're here, something other than discovering what money, love and sex have to do with the Meaning of Life. We grow our own organic vegetables, take our Omega 3, meditate, start book clubs. We work out five days a week, treat ourselves to low-fat soy sorbet the other two, and then wonder why we're perpetually cranky. So what is the rest of it? we want to know (and preferably by the end of the afternoon). This perpetual question distracts and disturbs us and keeps us worn to a raveling.\n\nI thought we’d gently explore the first, self-dislike, or self-avoidance which might be why we never try to catch our reflection in the mirror or ever take photographs that we actually like. However, I love how the English novelist Virginia Woolf called this “her looking-glass shame,” the malady that breaks every woman’s heart because it is the bedrock that allows the other two to occur. I once made the observation that there is really no wound from which the soul rarely recovers except regret and you know what? I was right. It's taken me a heck of a long time to forgive myself and make self-nurturing amends, so if I can help at all, let me know. That's why I'm here.\n\nSo just between you and me how about a little chat? To begin with, there seems to be no vein of misery than runs deeper in all our lives than self-avoidance or personal dislike. But this is a fault line that guarantees our failure ever to be truly happy, no matter how much we accomplish or accumulate, or in whose arms we lie.\n\nSo why do we disapprove of ourselves? Let me count the ways. Some of the world’s most famous beauties can’t stand the physical sight of themselves. Self-dislike is an equal opportunity oppressor. In short, we may recoil from our human frailties, flaws and foibles in a world that approves only perfection; our personal oddities, eccentricities and bad habits give us ammunition every day, especially since we discount every positive virtue through insidious comparisons to other women.\n\nWe self-sabotage ourselves by constantly capitulating to the needs of others by disavowing our own; for ignoring the careless cruelties of loved ones in order to keep the peace; for struggling to live up to the expectations of those we don’t even care about; for denying the validity of our own unrequited desires.\n\nWe mercilessly rage against ourselves because we don’t look quite like the multi-orgasmic sex goddesses we once thought we’d become; or because we’re not quite the natural, full bonded mothers we assumed we’d be when we held that baby in our arms for the first time; or because we haven’t quite fulfilled the promise of our astonishing authentic gifts with a star on Hollywood Blvd or an Editor-in-Chief nameplate on our door by 40 and Heaven have mercy, we won't let ourselves ever forget what a disappointment we are. I didn't even start to write Simple Abundance until I was 44. It took me half a lifetime to even discover how much I didn't know.\n\nWhen was the last time you started off a conversation with “I’m sorry” and you weren’t? I did yesterday. “Elvira always lied first to herself before she lied to anybody else, since this gave her a conviction of moral honesty,“ Phyllis Bottome wrote in 1934 about a woman we all know too well.\n\nOne way we learn how to hide our self-dislike is by putting on our public masks and making sure that everyone else on the planet is happy. That’s why you’ve learned how to please, cajole, comfort and delight your parents, partners, lovers, friends, boss or children but haven’t a clue how to give Guess Who a moment of pleasure, as in an hour or two to call your own and rediscover what it is that brings a smile to your face or that amazing sense of contentment.\n\nWhich is how we die from self-pity, and that isn’t pretty.\n\nIt’s time to declare a détente with our imperfections, to lay down the artillery of self-abuse we aim at ourselves, the potions, prayers and punitive diets, cosmetic artifice and extreme customized corrections. I’m not suggesting that there’s isn’t a place for hair color, makeup and cosmetic nipping and tucking if it’s going to help you awaken to our own inner beauty. But I am telling you that nothing will help you get over looking-glass shame if the transformation doesn’t begin from within. First you have to be willing to seek ways of renewal that honor your body and restore it to its rightful place, as the sacred garment of your soul.\n\nMore often than not, we discover who we are and what makes us genuinely happy through the revelations found in the small the simple, and the common. In your tiny choices, in what seem like infinitesimal changes. In the unconsidered. The overlooked. The discarded. The reclaimed. In moments I call “everyday epiphanies.” When those “ah, ha” transmissions allow the static of the world to clear suddenly and the soul’s Morse code—the dots and dashes of our daily round, so often dismissed as meaningless—not only connect, but resonate on the deepest level.\n\nSo how do you learn to develop a finely honed sense of self-worth? Give thanks for the Swell Dame within, even if the world calls it self-worship. Pay attention from now on to what excites you, or moves you to tears. What makes the blood rush to your head, your heart skip a beat, your knees shaky and your soul sigh? And just remember, when someone else calls what you’re doing self-indulgent, you’ll know it’s self-preservation.\n\nSending dearest love and always, blessings on your courage. XO\n\nSBB"
