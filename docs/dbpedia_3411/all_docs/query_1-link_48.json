        "text": "What is it like to live with ROHHAD?\n\nROHHAD entered my life in 2018 when my youngest child, Isaac, was diagnosed at 2 ½ years old. His story is very similar to other ROHHAD families where Isaac was born healthy and developed normally, meeting all his milestones on time or early. But around age 2 I started to notice strange symptoms such as weight gain, sweating, lazy eyes, behavioral changes, and an abnormal breathing pattern while he was sleeping. I knew something wasn’t right and I brought him to the doctors many times, but they could never find anything to explain his symptoms and reassured me that I didn’t need to be concerned. Unfortunately, 13 days after his last doctor’s appointment, he had a cardio-respiratory arrest that required 10 minutes of CPR and resulted in a 105-day PICU hospital admission. He was stabilized and on a ventilator for weeks. Every time they tried to remove his breathing tube, it would need to be put back in a day or two later so it was decided that he would have a tracheostomy. During that time a tumor was found on his abdomen. So a day-long surgery took place and surgeons removed this tumor (later found out to be ganglio neuroblastoma), placed a tracheostomy, and a feeding tube into his stomach.\n\nShortly after that time, he was diagnosed with ROHHAD. When he was finally able to return home he was a completely different person. He required life support to stay alive, and I became his primary caretaker who not only managed an in-home intensive care unit but also spent 24/7 monitoring and responding to his symptoms to keep him alive.\n\nBut the question of “What is it like to live with ROHHAD?” is a struggle to answer, because there is nothing straightforward when it comes to ROHHAD. It’s a highly complicated disorder that would require a novel to explain the symptoms and what’s required to care for a child with ROHHAD. Even though families receive a diagnosis, not enough is known about the syndrome to be able to assist families with life and death decision making. Or even to offer any insight as to how the syndrome will unfold. That is where we need the help of others to contribute to research.\n\nWhen Isaac was first diagnosed, I had to explain to his 3 older siblings (ages 4, 7, and 10) what was happening. They were waiting for me to come home and tell them that the doctors finally figured out what was wrong and they were going to fix it. But I was only able to offer them information for half of their concerns: that we had a diagnosis. I’ll never forget how their eyes lit up when I said that doctors finally figured out what was making Isaac so sick. They were expecting reassurance from me that he was going to be fixed, and I had to tell them that it couldn’t be fixed. I explained to them that our brains have a “thinking” part, where we can tell our body what to do. And there’s another part of the brain that our thinking can’t control, like our breathing, our heart pumping, our blood pressure, and how we sleep. I went on to explain that the “thinking” parts of Isaac’s brain worked okay so he can still play, he can talk, and he can eat. But the part of our brain that we can’t control is that part of Isaac’s brain that doesn’t work properly.\n\nIsaac lived for 3 and a half more years with the help of a ventilator, a team of doctors and professionals, and me acting as his nervous system to help monitor and address his nervous system dysfunction when it would randomly appear. He passed away a few days after his 6th birthday.\n\nROHHAD took our precious boy from us. How many “firsts“ he will never get the opportunity to experience as a boy, son, brother, grandson, nephew, friend, and all of his teenage and adult life? So many peoples lives were altered when their expectations for a life with him in it were taken away.\n\nROHHAD has not just stolen a piece of my heart, but also a piece of myself. My heart will carry his spirit, his memory, and my love for him. My body will always carry the effects of the memories of pure joy, love, and contentment of him completing our family. But also the burden of remembering his last breaths and placing his body in the ground. Time’s relentless march will leave me remembering him longer than I could hold him in my arms. I have to spend the rest of my life without him. That’s what it’s like to live with ROHHAD.\n\nThe first 2 years of Isacc’s life were what one would consider “normal.” He met all his milestones on time or early. He bonded with his 3 older siblings. Life was grand.\n\nShortly after his second birthday, (sometime in March 2018) I noticed him breathing funny after he fell asleep. His breaths were quick and shallow and I knew something wasn’t right. I tried to copy his breathing pattern to see what it would feel like. It wasn’t pleasant.\n\nThe strange breathing pattern continued every time he fell asleep. I scheduled an appointment with his primary care provider, who assured me that “Little kids can have strange breathing patterns.” Over the next few months, a few other strange things were noted that caused me concern. He gained weight quickly over a short period. As a family, we ate a very clean diet, nothing processed. We are all very active. But even with restricting his food intake, his weight continued to increase. He also developed a lazy eye and became very sensitive to the sun. He wore sunglasses a lot. Most 2 year-olds won’t keep sunglasses on.\n\nThe most peculiar symptom that developed was a sudden hatred for his swing and fear of going near railings. Previously he loved his swing. I remember that spring every night after dinner, he would cry at the door wanting me to take him out to his swing. I would leave the mess from dinner to take the kids outside and push Isaac in his swing.\n\nI vividly remember putting him into his blue and red, plastic swing. With the sun low in the sky and filtering through the trees, it gave Isaac a halo through his golden locks. I buckled him in and gave him a big push. But instead of gleeful laughter, he cried. A pained cry. He wanted out immediately. As I took him out of the swing I had that yucky feeling in your gut when you know something is wrong. The next morning I called to schedule another doctor’s appointment.\n\nAt the doctor appointment, I again shared my concerns that something was wrong. I reviewed the strange developments: weight gain, lazy eye, quick and shallow breathing pattern when asleep, sweatiness that didn’t match the environment, and sudden fear of the swing. Again I was reassured that everything checked out fine, but they did some bloodwork to see if anything showed up. That was July 13, 2018.\n\n17 days later, on July 30 is the day that everything changed for Isaac and our family. It’s the day that transitioned us into the “after Isaac got sick” part of our lives.\n\nAfter a wonderful day spent with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, I put the kids to bed. About 2 hours later I went to check on the kids before I put myself to bed. Isaac’s breathing was fast, shallow, and had a strange sound to it. His pillow was soaked so I thought maybe he threw up. I turned on the light and discovered that he was drenched in sweat (in an air-conditioned room). He was rolling around and seemed very uncomfortable. Knowing something was wrong, I picked him up. He was very limp. He kept asking for water. I gave him some sips of water. His breathing sounded rattly and wet. It was so strange, he looked fine but my intuition was telling me he needed help. I woke up my husband and we took him to the Emergency Room.\n\nI remember telling my husband to hurry. I didn’t know what was wrong, but I knew it was serious. I only remember bits and pieces of our time at the local emergency department. They made us wait when we arrived. I didn’t understand why they had us sit down. I just said my child is having trouble breathing, it doesn’t make sense to have a seat and wait. But I knew that if I started acting “crazy” that it would compromise us getting the help we needed.\n\nOnce in the triage room, the nurse was trying to small talk with me as I held my limp baby. My husband expressed his concerns that Isaac was having trouble and that people weren’t responding appropriately. She told him to “calm down.” After that things get real blurry in my memory.\n\nThere were low oxygen levels and then a chest X-ray.\n\nWe moved to a different room and a doctor was telling me that Isaac had double pneumonia, his lungs were full of fluid. I remember asking “How is this possible? He hasn’t even been sick!” The doctor just opened his mouth but no words came out. He shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. This is around the time I shut down. I could still hear and see everything going on, but it was like I was underwater. Everything was strange and seemed really far away. I was still being asked questions but I was only able to respond with nods or shakes of my head. There were discussions about a helicopter on its way to transport him. There is a gap in my memory of what happens next. The next thing I actually remember is walking the halls of the next hospital we were transported to.\n\nBut thanks to a friend who sent me a journal during Isaac’s hospitalization, I have a written account of my memories before the trauma took them from my consciousness. The following is from that journal.\n\nIsaac was strapped into a stretcher and loaded into the back of a helicopter. I felt weird and robotic-like, got into the passenger seat at the front of the helicopter, and followed directions. I wasn’t able to speak and the pilot recognized that. He just asked me to nod my head in response to his questions. He started the take-off process. The propellers were spinning but we were still on the ground. Someone in the back of the helicopter (where Isaac was) banged on the divider between us. The medical responders in the back were telling the pilot we needed to go back in. Still in robot-mode, I exited the helicopter and followed the team pushing Isaac back into the hospital. They took Isaac to a new room and my husband and I were instructed to wait outside the room.\n\nWe asked what was going on, and a nurse offered to tell us what was going on in the room we were not allowed in. From the hallway, she looked in through the doorway but she wasn’t saying anything. She looked at us but I could tell she was trying to find the words. My husband asked, “are they doing CPR on him?” After an excruciating pause which already gave us the answer, she shook her head yes.\n\nIt was as if her response set off an invisible ripple through the air that hit us, knocking us to the ground. We clutched each other on the hallway floors and burst into tears. I tried pulling myself up by a hand railing but couldn’t. I wanted to scream, to let out a bellow from deep within. A primal maternal release. But I didn’t. I muffled my sounds to moans and weeping. If Isaac was dying I didn’t him to be scared. If this was his time to go, I didn’t want to frighten him with my sounds. If his soul was moving on I wanted him to know it was okay. I also didn’t want to distract the hands that were attempting to save my child’s life.\n\nMy baby. His little body. Where was his soul? I could feel him hovering on that fine line between here and not here. All that was left to do was to pray. All the prayers from childhood that I hadn’t recited in many years came back to me. As did the newer ones I’ve learned. I said them over and over again with the palms of my hands up against the wall that separated us. There were hands of strangers upon me. Hands that also couldn’t bear to do anything else but pray. I was grateful for those hands because I thought it would amplify my plea.\n\nThey did save him. But that was the beginning of something else entirely different.\n\nWe have been home for about 6 weeks. I’m not really sure how to describe the process of getting Isaac home. Over-whelming, intense, emotional, relieving are all words that come to mind. I don’t even know where to begin to tell you all we had to do to prepare for his arrival home. And I really don’t remember a lot. I remember pushing myself to keep going, even though I had been “going” for 16 hours straight. I remember talking myself out of a meltdown at Rite Aid when they screwed up the prescriptions. “You can’t lay on the floor and cry here. They won’t let you have Isaac home if you can’t do this. Don’t lose it. Not here. Not now. Keep going.” (Hopefully I didn’t say it out loud to the pharmacist!)\n\nHere’s a well-written article on the hidden workload of special needs parents.\n\nBut somehow we got everything done and welcomed Isaac back home. I also remember one of the kids shouting “They’re here! They’re here!” and we ran outside in the cold, jumping with joy to greet Isaac and his dad. The moment I had Isaac’s arms wrapped around my neck, all the stress and worry just melted away. He’s home. He’s still here and he’s home.\n\nThe next few weeks after his arrival home is another blur. We had so many people in the home checking on us and helping to make sure we had everything we needed. Doctors, nurses, EMS, social workers, to name a few. There was lots of planning, coordinating, communicating, and checking. We had to review all possible worst-case emergency scenarios. No parent wants to think about what to do when your child isn’t breathing. No parent wants to review life-saving procedures or think\n\nabout performing CPR on their 2-year-old. But we have to. When setting up his room, I had to think about all these emergency scenarios. I made sure the bed could be easily accessed from both sides. I had to make sure the oxygen tank had long enough tubing that it could reach his bed if needed. That the emergency trach supplies were in reach of the bed. That all of the supplies were labeled so that if my hands were busy pumping an ambu bag for CPR, that I would be able to tell people where things are. And then there was retelling the traumatic story of how Isaac ended up in the hospital. Over and over again. But none the less, we made it through. And we are adjusting to a new normal.\n\nThere were incredible improvements with Isaac within just a few days of being home. We knew he would improve once home, but we were pleasantly surprised by how quickly. He is now walking, running, galloping, and climbing up on the furniture. When we left the hospital, he wasn’t able to walk unassisted.\n\nIt has been beautiful to witness the kids showing their care and concern for their brother and making great memories. Like when Tommy, whose 8, brought snow in the house for him to play with because he couldn’t go outside. Seeing and hearing their excitement as they witness Isaac’s improvements is heartwarming.\n\nWhen Isaac was still in the hospital and we had no idea what was going on, I had a conversation with the other three kids about a glass ball. I told them that if our life was a glass ball, it was dropped on the ground and shattered. And we only had a few pieces put back together at the moment, but we are working on our pieces every day. I told them that we (my husband and I) have put our glass ball back together many times before. And each time our life was better than it was before. At one time our ball just had a life for me and Tom. With each child that entered our family, our glass ball had to be put together again in a new and much more beautiful way. This time, it is going to take longer to get our pieces back together. But it’s okay because it will be beautiful once we are back together again. And we have so many helpers: friends, family, community members, and doctors that are supporting us with putting the pieces back together. And all we have to do is keep loving, listening to each other, and helping. They may be young, but they are wise beyond their years. They had some amazing thoughts.\n\nNow that we are home I feel like I have all the pieces, but I’m just holding them in my hands. Now what? Our life before is gone. Now we have a life we didn’t choose. Our routines, schedules, ways of doing and being…are all gone. I have a new round-the-clock job of caring for a child with complex medical needs. We are starting from scratch. It’s kind of like the post-natal period when you bring a new baby home. We have to rest and recover. So we are doing our best to take it easy: lots of snuggles, reading, walks outside, watching movies and documentaries. I found this checklist of self-care for families and it’s a great resource for us.\n\nThese two quotes have been helping me as well.\n\nWe are figuring it out and having joyful moments along the way.\n\nThere was a time not that long ago, that I feared there would never 4 together again. 4 among the trees, free to be. I’m accustomed to checking for 4: 4 bodies to count, 4 voices to listen for. Even though we are together again, that fear is still there. Lingering. A silent reminder that weaves its way into the most joyful moments. Some days it feels cruel. At other times it feels like a blessing. A gift of another opportunity to choose wisely. I choose to seek out the beauty and joy. And to always choose to love and be loved."
