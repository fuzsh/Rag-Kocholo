        "text": "With 193 grants and over $50 million in funding to date, the Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program represents, to our knowledge, the largest funding initiative to meet the needs of scientific software used for research. Stories and data from this unique grantee community represent one of the best available accounts on the impact of the open source foundations of science. We're excited to share this report, hoping it will help highlight the importance of bringing more investments into open source for science. Check it out! https://lnkd.in/dajFbtvH Kudos to Kate Hertweck for leading this monumental 80-page data collection effort and a big thank you to the EOSS community, to all our program advisors and reviewers, and to the whole Science team at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for making this program a reality. #opensource #openscience #scientificcomputing\n\nHave you ever struggled with low self-confidence or felt like an impostor? üòø Have you encountered inappropriate comments from colleagues? üôÄ If so, you're not alone! Many people have faced these challenges, which is why, along with La√≠s Carvalho and Anezka Muller, we've organized a series of PyLadies events at EuroPython. Our goal is to empower you, help you boost your self-confidence, and provide strategies for handling unprofessional behavior in the workplace. üí™ Here's what we've prepared: ‚Ä¢ #IAmRemarkable#IAmRemarkable Workshop: Recognize and embrace your own value. ü•á ‚Ä¢ Modern Self-Defense (Modern√≠ sebeobrana): Learn techniques to address inappropriate behavior. üõ° ‚Ä¢ Meet & Greet with Experienced PyLadies: Connect with mentors. üë©üéì We'll also be hosting a PyLadies lunch and evening drinks to encourage networking. ü•ó üç∏ Space is limited, so be sure to register to reserve your spot! üìÖ\n\nI am deeply concerned when the director of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) describes the requirement to make a necessary dependency of an AI system (the data it is built with and cannot be built, rebuilt, or studied without) as: \"burdensome and unnecessary\". But that happened this morning. And I don't understand why. You cannot build a modern AI system without data. A description of the data does not meet the technical requirement any more than a description of OpenSSL enables cryptography. If 60% of the necessary source code of Linux was unavailable, not under an open source license, only \"described\", it would be obvious that Linux binaries couldn't possibly be open source. But somehow, that same situation is fine for AI? When someone insists that a lesser standard is \"good enough\", you should ask why. I don't know why. There are training datasets under open data licensing. Perhaps we need more, and I would be the first to consider that a good thing. The OSI director uses language like \"legal ramifications of distributing large amounts of data are deep and uncertain across legislations\". I'm grateful the OSI didn't use that same language to denigrate open source software, despite the complexities of copyright law across jurisdictions that continue today. Why are they using Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) language now? Like I said, I don't know. But you should ask why the OSI so vehemently insists you don't need open data. Addendum: I know sometimes LinkedIn posts things out of order, so if you want to learn more about this, I've written a short piece on the topic here: https://lnkd.in/gCsZ-gsH"
