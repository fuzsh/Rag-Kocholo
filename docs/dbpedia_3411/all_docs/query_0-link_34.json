        "text": "I say to Grads and Apprentices they should go out of their comfort zone and message people on LinkedIn to understand their experiences before deciding on a career. There are several benefits in doing this: 1) Networking ‚Äì You not only grow your network üë®üíºüë®üíº, but you become more comfortable in reaching out to people. The second part is sometimes overlooked, but something you do often in a corporate environment. 2) Insight ‚Äì You get a deeper understanding of a person‚Äôs career and experiences. This can be much more valuable than just doing research online. üíª 3) Communication ‚Äì You will speak üì¢ to people from different backgrounds at different stages of their career. This will naturally help improve your communication skills. 4) Rejection ‚Äì You will become more comfortable with rejection. Not everyone will respond to you, you‚Äôll worry üòü at first but it won‚Äôt matter when a few people give you their time. ‚è≤ You‚Äôll soon realise it‚Äôs quality not quantity which matters. 5) Preparation ‚Äì You can pick up how experienced people üë®üíº present themselves and some corporate lingo which will help you feel more prepared for your first day in the office. üè¢ Anything else you'd add? #networking #grads #apprentices\n\nAs we transition from university to the workforce, creating a distinct graduate identity becomes crucial for success.
