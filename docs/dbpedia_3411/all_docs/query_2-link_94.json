        "text": "𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐫-𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐬. Steve Jobs knew he wasn't a 10x engineer, so he doubled down on building a world-class user experience and design for the iPhone in his day. Warren Buffett avoided the tech industry, diving instead into straightforward businesses that he understood. By using his analytical strengths, he became one of the most successful investors of all time. Oprah Winfrey may not have started with strong business acumen, but she leveraged her strengths in empathy, communication, and connecting with people to build a lasting media empire. Bill Gates admitted that he wasn’t the most people-oriented leader, so he maximised his technical skills and vision for Microsoft, while others handled different aspects of the business. Key lesson here: work on your weaknesses, but work 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 on your innate strengths to be truly extraordinary. This was my biggest takeaway from our Product Women group coaching, hosted by the incredible Kaili Wu, held at Toku Nori, Amanda Lim’s amazing new restaurant (check it out if you’re in 🇸🇬). Thanks also to my team Nithya Karthikeyan, Diana Lim and Rachel Kuo for the great support! ✨ So what makes you truly extraordinary? ✨ #strengths #growth #productmanagers #women #coaching\n\nNetworking can be kinda awkward. You're in a sea of faces, trying to find that elusive common ground. You try not to talk about the weather. Cue the silence. You can’t help glancing at the clock. At Product Women, we've been there too. The struggle is real, which is why we're on a mission to create safe spaces for authentic connections. Recently, we teamed up with the incredible folks at DSG Consumer Partners to try something new: a Human Library experience. Picture this: small, intimate conversations with trailblazing female innovators like Liyana Fauzi Huang Yixuan (Eve) Nivedita Venkateish Mili Kale Maya Kale where questions and conversations just flow. No awkward small talk, just real stories about what it takes to be a product leader and tips on getting better at what you do everyday. Massive thanks to Angela Hu Marchella Febryanti for supporting this event and my team Nithya Karthikeyan Rachel Kuo Diana Lim for putting this together! What was your best networking experience?\n\nWhen I first graduated, I had all the naivety to think I had it all figured out. The grand five-year plan in my mind: Graduate, snag a cushy first job, get that promotion in one year, maybe a relocation overseas - all in the pursuit of becoming an unstoppable force. After all, aren't we all special little snowflakes destined for greatness? 🎓 Turns out, I wasn't the unique snowflake I thought I was. ❄️ Life's scorching reality melted me into a puddle of uncertainty. 🔥 💦 If I could have a heart-to-heart talk with my younger self: 1️⃣ 𝐈𝐭'𝐬 𝐨𝐤𝐚𝐲 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐮𝐭 🌈 Embrace the chaos, the unpredictable turns, and the beauty of not having every detail mapped out. Letting go of that grip on control is tough, I know. But sometimes, the detours lead to the most unexpected and fulfilling destinations. 2️⃣ 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐢𝐠 𝐣𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐬 🤸♀️ My journey from non-tech to tech might seem like one gravity-defying leap, but in reality, it was a series of small, intentional hops. Each experience, no matter how seemingly unrelated, contributes to your unique skill set. Recognise the value in every step, and let it guide your next move. 3️⃣ 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫 🎉 Progress beats perfection, hard work gets you to places, and every stumble is a lesson learned. Your imperfections tell you where to grow the most. Couldn't turn back time, but recently, I had the honour of sharing these stories with the extraordinary ladies at the Young Women's Leadership Connection. 🌟 Being a #freshgraduate in this climate isn't easy, but armed with these #mindsetshifts , you can be a little more patiently impatient, taking your career one hop at a time. 🐇 Thank you Felicia F., Rachel Lee and Yvonne Mak for having me! #transitions #pivot #nontech #tech #productmanagement #productmanager #graduation\n\n2024 is here, and let’s talk about career pivots. Starting in corporate was a game-changer for me, transitioning from aviation to tech. Here's why: 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 At the world's best airport, excellence meant doing things systematically, since safety was everything. It taught me to design structured processes, which also help to scale tech businesses. 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 In high-stakes negotiations in brokering airline partnerships, I learnt how to communicate - emails, briefs, meeting minutes - an invaluable skill in any business setting. 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 Navigating stakeholders and building relationships across different teams became second nature, a skill honed in a globally-connected business. I'm immensely grateful for my time at Changi Airport Group. This was where I learned the ropes of how to navigate chaos, conquer the uncharted, and get things done effectively. A disciplined approach, communication finesse, and knack for relationship-building, were the edge on my pivot into tech. Your unique background isn't a roadblock - it's the compass guiding you toward where you want to go.🌟🚀 https://lnkd.in/gcbx8zHj #pivot #career #aviation #airport #airlines #tech #productmanagement #productmanager #internationalrelations #womenintech #womeninbusiness #womeninproduct\n\nAn ex-boss once dropped the bomb: \"You won't make it as a product manager without a computer science degree.\" Honestly, that stung. For the longest time, I let that idea hold me back. I'd scroll through job listings, battling self-doubt that whispered, \"Who would trust someone without a tech background to lead digital product growth?\" After immersing myself in books, workshops, and any snippet of PM wisdom I could find, I stumbled on a revelation. Sure, technical skills matter, but the real magic lies in the softer, human-centric skills. The ability to empathize and communicate effectively — those qualities set phenomenal product managers apart. Hard skills? You pick them up along the way. Soft skills? You've got them; you just need to fine-tune them. So, I took a leap and hit that \"apply\" button, changing my trajectory in the process. Reflecting on the journey, I can't help but feel grateful for my time at ShopBack — a masterclass in showing what being a great product manager means. And now, I am joining the band at Spotify, as their first product manager in Asia! To all those who've been told they don't fit the mold — hear this: your potential to learn and adapt is boundless. The journey might throw challenges your way, but those challenges mold new stories. ✨ With the right mindset, the impossible is just an uncharted playlist waiting for you to hit “play”. 🎵 (throwback to a Bollywood party on my first week 💃) #generalist #pivot #transitions #productmanagement #productmanager #creators #growth #technical #selfdevelopment\n\nIt’s my last week at ShopBack. At ShopBack, we don't say goodbye; we say \"graduate.\" I mean, similar to why the #singapore office isn’t just an office, it’s a CAMPUS! 🏫 The energy here is all about growth, learning, and evolving. When it's time to toss that metaphorical cap in the air 🎓, it's a celebration of the experiences gained – a graduation into the next chapter. Here are three big lessons this amazing journey has etched in my heart: 1️⃣ 𝐁𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐭, 𝐚𝐥𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 In a places where \"packaging\" yourself in a certain way is sometimes rewarded, it's refreshing to be part of a culture that values intellectual honesty - saying, \"I don't know\" when needed. No fluff or hiding behind politics. Be real, accountable, and focused on the work, not the fancy packaging. 2️⃣ 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 Don’t complain and wait around for change – create it. Belief in an idea is just the start; at ShopBack, we're encouraged to own it and make it happen. Drive initiatives, make things better and be the change you want to see. 3️⃣ 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐦𝐬 As a product manager, I've learned it's never just one correct way of doing things. Effectively communicating with stakeholders can mean presenting a range of choices, sharing the pros and cons, and collectively arriving at decisions that benefit the entire team. A massive shoutout to the incredible folks at ShopBack. Your smarts and kindness have been my daily inspiration. ✨ To my mentors, thank you for taking a chance in me from the start. Your guidance has shaped me more than you know. 💙 As for what's next? Well, let's just say I'm gearing up to vibe to some seriously good music. 🎵🎸 Stay tuned! 🎶🚀 #graduation #mentorship #startup #culture #inspiration #learning #growth #transformation #communication #productmanager #newbeginnings #womeninproduct\n\n✨ What’s stopping me from ___? ✨ This was the most asked question by our product managers at Product Women during a magical evening of tarot card reading. 🃏 Imagine picture cards as a roadmap to your thoughts and emotions. 🗺️ Not predicting the lottery (who wouldn't want a sneak peek though? 🙈), but diving deep into your inner motivations. 🔍 So, what's been stopping you from unleashing your full potential? The cards led some of us to: - Fear of failure - Imposter syndrome - Overcommitment Let’s be real – we all share these challenges. 💪 🌟 The Hierophant, The Fool, The Empress – each card whispers something unique about your journey. They're door-openers to stories you might not hear in your everyday office banter. 💬 As a community, our stories are a mixtape of wins, struggles, and dreams. And hey, whether you're a tarot believer or not, sharing these stories can make you feel a little closer, a little more connected. 💖 Thanks tarot queen Eileen Teoh for patiently guiding us through our thoughts, Huishan Tan Rachel Kuo Nithya Karthikeyan Diana Lim for the great support! Cheers to unlocking mysteries, stronger connections, and celebrating each other’s uniqueness! 🎉 #productmanager #productmanagement #womeninproduct #community #tarot #roadmap #womenintech\n\n🔥 Roadmap your Rise 🔥 Fresh out of school, I thought my career would be a highway. Straight, predictable and smooth. I was going to stay in my first job, do well for 30 years and retire happily ever after. That never happened. It's more like a twisty country road. Unexpected turns, steep climbs, and heart-stopping drops. Business Development ➡️ Marketing ➡️ Operations ➡️ Product Management Now as a product manager I am trained to anticipate these risks. Roadmap like a boss. But our careers? There's no forecasting every curveball, no planning for every setback. But you know what? Sometimes this unpredictability makes the ride worthwhile. Your career roadmap will guide you, but it will never truly lead you to your destination. 🚀Here are some of those learnings that our superstar panellists Isaac Timothy Tay and Amanda Lim shared during our Product Women x ShopBack event: 1. 'Year of Yes': Say yes to opportunities, even when they scare you. Fear is a barrier, not a stop sign. 2. Hard work vs smart risks: Success is not just about working hard. It’s about taking calculated risks. 3. Choosing your company: Consider the people, product market fit, and market opportunities. 4. Company 'product metric': How many people whom you respect are in the company? 5. Accumulate 3 kinds of capital: Consider how your next role will help you accumulate intellectual, social, and financial capital. 6. Knowing when to quit: Recognise the signs that it's time to move on. Don't cling to a sinking ship. 7. Failure = learning: True failure is when you don’t learn from your mistakes. If you can explain why you failed, you've learned something valuable. 8. The courage to 'unship': Sometimes, rolling back your product is the best decision. It takes courage to admit a mistake and correct it. 9. Data discipline: Let data guide your decisions. Gut feelings are important, but numbers give you true confidence. 10. Interests beyond your domain: Being interested in another domain can inform your product sense. 11. Preserving emotional energy: Schedule your 1:1s and meetings at the start of the week before your energy depletes and affects your decision-making. You’re human, not machine. Massive thank you 👏 to Isaac and Amanda for keeping it real and sharing their wisdom so candidly. Your stories had us all hooked, hanging on to every word. Big 💖 to ShopBack People team Ethel Ching Bryan Lim Lynn Choi Yishan Teo for pulling out all the stops! From sponsoring the food to the venue and swag - your hard work made this happen! Shoutout to my dream team 🌈 Nithya Karthikeyan Rachel Kuo Diana Lim. It's your strength and motivation that powered us through. Thank you all who attended, hope you walked away with much more than swag 😉💡 Embrace the detours, enjoy the scenic routes. Because it's in navigating these unexpected twists and turns where we truly find our way. #productmanagement #careergrowth #roadmap #productmanager #techcommunity #learning\n\n🔥🙌 Battle-tested strategies on influence without authority 🎉💡 Super insightful panel discussion organised by Product Women in StashAway. Our rockstar panellists Julie Martin and Inez Foong generously shared their real-life experiences on #influence in their product careers 💼🚀 Here's the lowdown on the goldmine of insights: 1️⃣ Finding allies Building alliances across departments can amplify our voice and influence. Get that extra boost of confidence when you walk into a meeting with people who will support your viewpoint 🤝🌐 2️⃣ Know what stakeholders care about Understanding the priorities of stakeholders is crucial to aligning our vision and selling solutions. Convince them in their lingo. 🎯👞 3️⃣ Data-driven influence Transform \"I think\" to \"I know\" and swing decisions in your favor with compelling data-backed arguments. There's no arguing with the numbers! 📊💡 4️⃣ Going slow to go fast Sometimes, to move faster and further, we need to slow down. Take time to fully understand the problem, settle technical debts, and build a strong foundation. It's all about long-term success. 🐢🚀 5️⃣ Building context Perception is a tricky thing - what you see might differ vastly from what your boss or your reports see. Understanding their context is key before tailoring our pitch. 🖼🔑 A massive thank you to our Product Women who attended, and to our phenomenal panelists Julie, Inez and moderator Chloe Tan for their wisdom and experiences! Thanks to my A-team Nithya Karthikeyan Rachel Kuo and Diana Lim for organising this event. Also to Stashaway for having us at your cosy office! Missed this one? Brace yourselves, we've got more power-packed events coming up. Stay tuned! 🥳🗓 —— If you're a #female #productmanager in #singapore looking for a like-minded #community who are always up for a challenge and a good laugh, join us at Product Women.

Oh, it was an intense ride🎢 Sharing some lessons from this journey, not just for those planning a hackathon, but for any new initiative you’re gearing up to lead. 🌟 Challenge 1️⃣: Earning buy-in from key stakeholders 👑 It was tough to get participants at first as many teams were involved in other important projects. Participating in the hackathon meant that they had additional work on top of their day-to-day. The game-changer was when we shared our product vision and how it helps us succeed as one. Our key stakeholders didn't just give their blessings - they became our most valuable advocates, encouraging their teams to participate. Their endorsement was the catalyst we needed, turning our ambitious goal into a buzzing reality! Challenge 2️⃣: The need for speed 🏁 We had just 28 days from planning to execution. It was a pressure cooker situation, but we pulled it off! We learned that tight timelines can actually supercharge creativity. When the clock's ticking, the magic happens! Challenge 3️⃣: Making sure the ideas can run🦵 There was little value in just brainstorming session that gets lost in the shuffle. We wanted ideas that work. So, we set clear parameters, honed in on a single area to innovate, and steered teams towards crafting real-world, actionable solutions. And oh, did they deliver! A heartfelt THANK YOU 🙏 to all our participants, judges and helpers all across ShopBack for their spectacular support and enthusiasm! We learned, we innovated, but above all, we grew together! So if you’re starting a new initiative, remember, challenges are not roadblocks, but stepping stones. Embrace them, learn from them, and let them guide you forward! This hackathon? It was just us revving the engine. So, strap in. The real journey is just beginning. PS. If this sounds like your kind of thrill ride, check out our careers page. We're always game for more co-pilots on this rocket to the future! 🚀 #hackathon #productmanagement #productinnovation #teamwork #rapidprototyping #techcareer"
