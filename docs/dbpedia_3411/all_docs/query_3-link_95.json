        "text": "Since the beginning of my career, creativity has been the driving force behind my work and my vision as an entrepreneur. The obsession with innovation and the often-limitless search for new ways of thinking and creating has always accompanied me. Three decades ago, I empirically adopted a model that I called dual, for the execution of design solutions in their most varied aspects (graphic, product, environmental, service, business, etc.), an approach that integrates analytical and creative thinking at the same time. It took me 15 years to fully understand the effectiveness of the fundamental result of this model, which I called the Key idea, a common name in other methodologies, but which in my case was associated with a very particular process. Through the metaphor of the Lemniscate, I created symbolism and ritual for a dynamic and iterative process of constant alternation between analytical-critical thinking (based on intelligence) and intuitive-creative thinking (based on creativity) – and structured the model to work on the construction of powerful design concepts and solutions, the key ideas.\n\nIn 2010, I documented my methodologies through flexible and clear frameworks, with the aim of helping new designers at the then B+G (now CBA B+G) to achieve powerful ideas more quickly. As the framework was very flexible and broad, I also added other practical components to the method, including for example the insights matrix and mind maps, tools that stimulate the creation of ideas through creative simulation (not necessarily creativity), in other words – the generation of ideas from formulated and often linear processes that partly replace the spontaneous and intuitive creative process (real creativity).\n\nThese models, almost magical formulas used to arrive at a result from an intelligent and very rational process, helped my professionals in two ways: the less experienced were able to arrive at satisfactory results and the more experienced were able to speed up the path to real creativity enormously. And I understood at the time that the simulation of creativity through these models was on the border between analytical thinking and real creativity itself, often making it difficult for an unsuspecting critic to discern between truly creative ideas and solutions based on methodological constructs which I also began to adopt as a ‘warm-up’ or accelerator of real creativity.\n\nOur intelligence doesn’t create anything on its own, but it does provide us with the analytical capacity to concatenate the bases for generating a spontaneous idea. In other words, the proposal of the dual model for arriving at the new Key idea, which on the one hand works with intelligence (analytical-critical thinking) and on the other with creativity (intuitive-creative thinking) already offered, in principle, a process for both simulated creativity and real creativity, depending on the professional’s experience (cognitive knowledge), time and depth dedicated to the project. In other words, except for real creativity, any ability to formulate processes in a structured way can be passed on to AI systems. And this suggests that almost all predictable, tested and formulated activities that do not require ethical, moral and cultural context components can be replicated by the algorithms of this technology.\n\nHowever, real creativity, which involves intuition, emotion and non-linear thinking, is still a distinctively human area. On the intelligence side, morality, ethics, conscience, resolving emotional conflicts and understanding social contexts are also still intrinsic aspects of humanity. These are fields that go beyond the execution of tasks or the reproduction of supposedly creative or intelligent patterns.\n\nThe prompt, in the context of generative platforms, is a fundamental piece in the connection between human and computational capacity. It serves very well as a metaphor for the ‘human algorithm’ in the interaction between human and artificial intelligences, between real human creativity and the simulation of machine creativity, representing the perfect link between these two human cognitive capacities and their generative counterparts based on analogous data and formulas proposed by or for the machine. The same will happen with its cousin-brother in the next generation of human-machine interaction to dominate the scene, voice command.\n\nFaced with the challenge posed to analytical thinking, and reflecting on artificial intelligence, which is taking over a lot of space that we once thought was exclusive to human intelligence, I point to the indisputable opportunity to understand and preserve the essence of the components of human intelligence that are still irreplaceable, such as ethics and real creativity. I believe that the interaction between these intelligences reveals two major fundamental axes of evolution in design and beyond: one, which advances through the ever-increasing connection between the human and the synthetic, and a second, which puts the human back in its rightful dimension, potentially removing from our hands and minds all the automated, mechanical and process occupation that we have created for ourselves and overvalued over decades of our history. Let us take advantage of this unique moment to become human again, in the best way possible.\n\nLuís Bartolomei, CEO CBA B+G\n\nWe know that adapting global trends to local markets is crucial to the success of any brand that wants to stay relevant and alive. Understanding the cultural and social particularities of each region allows companies to implement innovations in a way that truly resonates with local audiences.\n\nIn our most recent webinar, in which we addressed the integration of new trends and innovations by companies to design an impactful future, our guest Daniela Klaiman, CEO of FutureFuture, emphasized the importance of adapting, or rather ‘translating’ trends according to the needs of each region. “Generally, trend reports come from abroad, and you can’t just copy and paste foreign trends here in Brazil, or in Latin America.”\n\nThis principle is especially sensitive when we look at emerging trends that raise discussions in various spheres, such as gender neutrality. Addressing this issue in Latin America goes beyond adapting a global idea; it’s a reinterpretation that considers the values, expectations and specific needs of local consumers.\n\nIn the context of Latin America, where around 18% of Gen-Z identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community, adopting a non-binary approach to product design represents a great opportunity for brands to adopt a more inclusive perspective, seeking to connect with audiences who value diversity and the expression of unique identities.\n\nIn our Useful Design Trends 2024 report, we addressed the “death of gender”, pointing out examples of brands and businesses that promote a design and marketing approach that moves away from binary gender norms, welcoming diversity. To see how this trend is unfolding in Latin America, we looked at some other examples from our region:\n\nAnother Place (Brazil): “Gender-free, no labels, to wear however you want” is the call from the Another Place clothing brand.\n\nPapel de Punto (Colombia): unisex clothing made from partially recycled fabrics, emphasizing its “clean and fun” profile.\n\nSimple Organic (Brazil): Brazilian representative of free beauty, the brand defines itself as democratic, disruptive, genderless and concerned about the health of people and the planet.\n\nO Boticário (Brazil): various products with gender-neutral fragrances for anyone to use.\n\nAnacê (Brazil): a brand that offers a fresh look at traditional tailoring, with flowing garments and no distinction between genders.\n\nCarla Fernández (Mexico): Mexican designer known for transforming indigenous textile techniques into contemporary clothing that respects and celebrates culture and fluid gender identity.\n\nIsaac Silva (Brazil): a democratic store selling genderless clothes that fit all body types.\n\nBrands that embrace this approach not only promote inclusion, but also establish themselves as benchmarks in an increasingly aware and demanding market.\n\nAlthough the gender neutrality trend is emerging as a point of reflection and action for many brands globally, in Latin America there is a certain hesitancy to fully adopt it. Despite examples of innovative initiatives, the scarcity of widely known cases reveals that this trend is often still seen as a niche.\n\nThis is reflected not only in the limited supply of products that challenge gender norms, but also in customers’ hesitation to recognize and embrace this cultural shift in their daily consumption practices.\n\nThis scenario suggests both an opportunity and a challenge: while there is fertile ground for innovation and differentiation in the market, there is also a need to cultivate a deeper understanding of the benefits and value of gender inclusion in product and service design. After all, truly adopting global trends in local contexts requires more than just introducing new products – it requires transforming perceptions and attitudes.\n\nSo the question is: are we ready to lead this change or will we be content to follow the pace of social and cultural transformation in our region? The answer to this question will define the future of inclusive design in Latin America and the role we will play on the global stage of social innovation.\n\nThere are 15 trends that promise longevity and sustainability, transcending the ephemerality that usually characterizes the world of brands. Our focus is on trends that last, that evolve and that continue to resonate year after year. We collect and select movements that not only signal change, but drive it.\n\nOur Useful Design Model\n\nFor us, design goes beyond aesthetic appeal, acting as an accelerator of meaningful change. This belief is summed up in our Useful Design Model, which is anchored in three levels of impact: individual, collective and global. These levels form the basis of our approach and are an integral part of the reporting structure.\n\nIt is structured around five essential pillars: Environment, Empowerment, Well-being, Society and Access. Each pillar represents a fundamental aspect of our world, highlighting the significant role of design in creating a better future. Through these pillars, we aim to show how design transcends traditional boundaries, acting as a powerful agent of transformation and progress.\n\nHere is a summary of the pillars and their trends in this Useful Design Trends 2024:\n\nDesign Trends | Environment\n\nAs we face the growing challenges of climate change, evidenced by record-breaking weather disasters in 2023, the urgency for sustainable initiatives has never been clearer. This pillar explores how design can revolutionize our production and consumption processes, advocating a shift towards sustainability that resonates at an industrial level.\n\n1. The Basics Reimagined\n\nReinventing raw materials and everyday essentials is a must.\n\nOpportunity: Mind the Senses\n\nWhen selecting new materials, consider the sensory impact of products. The tactile, visual, and even auditory qualities of materials can significantly influence the consumer experience. It’s all about creating a deeper, more memorable connection with your audience.\n\n2. Extended Lifespan\n\nReusing product life cycles, reducing waste and aligning with consumers’ sustainable demands.\n\nOpportunity: Sustainability as a service\n\nOffering subscription-based models in which maintenance, upgrades and end-of-life product management are included can be a game changer. This type of model ensures that products are kept in optimum condition for longer and that, when they reach the end of their useful life, they are disposed of responsibly.\n\n3. Ancestral Future\n\nCombining ancient wisdom with modern environmental solutions can bring advances and positive results for everyone.\n\nOpportunity: Sustainable supply chains with a story\n\nInvest in supply chains that not only prioritize sustainability, but also have a narrative. Source materials and ingredients from indigenous communities in a way that supports local economies and ecosystems. This approach ensures a sustainable and ethical supply chain and also gives products a compelling story that resonates with conscious consumers.\n\nDesign Trends | Empowerment\n\nCentered on Identity and Inclusion, this pillar addresses the need for design to empower people, especially Generation Z, to express their unique identities. It highlights the importance of universal design solutions that embrace diversity and promote self-confidence and self-expression.\n\n4. Universal Standard\n\nAddressing solutions through inclusive design, moving from niche adaptations to universal accessibility in conventional products and services.\n\nOpportunity: Empathetic AI assistance\n\nLeveraging AI to develop virtual assistants that adapt intuitively to the diverse needs of users, offering personalized and inclusive support for brand interaction and purchase journeys.\n\n5. Out of the box\n\nBy rejecting traditional norms and aesthetics, Generation Z embraces chaos, imperfection and originality.\n\nOpportunity: Encouraging creativity\n\nWhen navigating these transformative times, brands and individuals should not shy away from the strange, but rather play and experiment, allowing their audience to step outside their comfort zone which will take them to unexpected places. In doing so, they can reimagine what the norm is.\n\n6. Death of Gender\n\nMoving away from binary gender norms, brands are adopting diverse and non-binary approaches to product design and marketing.\n\nOpportunity: Expanding unisex products\n\nPromote inclusion by expanding unisex product lines, ensuring that marketing and design approaches are actively breaking down gender norms and adopting universally appealing design principles.\n\nDesign Trends | Well-being\n\nThis pillar takes a broad approach to improving quality of life, emphasizing physical, mental and emotional health. It explores how design can break taboos and create environments where individuals thrive, not just survive.\n\n7. Menopower\n\nBreaking the cycle of silence around the menopause is a significant transformation in the market, reflecting changing attitudes towards ageing and female empowerment in a growing Silver Economy.\n\nOpportunity: Attention to language\n\nBrands can go beyond terms like “anti-aging” by using positive and empowering language for products and campaigns about menopause and the beauty of aging gracefully.\n\n8. Sex Education\n\nEmbracing sex positivity as a central pillar of holistic well-being, especially among younger generations.\n\nOpportunity: Pop-up wellness experiences\n\nEstablishing spaces focused on sexual wellness that offer training, workshops and a portfolio of brands that guarantee a welcoming and stigma-free atmosphere.\n\n9. The Good Drugs\n\nThe narrative around psychotropic substances, from contempt to appreciation, is evolving, reflecting a change in society’s perception, in line with holistic wellness trends.\n\nOpportunity: Positive impact portfolio\n\nThrough strategic portfolio design, brands can develop a range of products that meet the different needs and preferences of consumers, from everyday wellness to more specific therapeutic solutions, maximizing positive impact.\n\nDesign Trends | Society\n\nFocuses on collective and shared growth, emphasizing the responsibility of organizations to contribute positively to their communities. In the wake of the pandemic and ongoing cultural changes, this section examines how design can facilitate community growth and shared value.\n\n10. AI Powered Creativity\n\nNew possibilities and ethical challenges arise as AI reshapes creativity.\n\nOpportunity: AI for social good\n\nHarnessing AI to address global challenges and promote sustainable development offers immense potential. Whether monitoring environmental issues, promoting fairness in lending or advancing the UN SDGs, there is an opportunity for organizations to use AI as a tool for positive change.\n\n11. Wiser Choices\n\nInfluencing behavior through design, emphasizing authenticity and leading by example.\n\nOpportunity: Advice on moderate consumption\n\nBrands must recognize their influence on consumer habits and commit to promoting moderation. This demonstrates corporate responsibility and is a key strategy for building trust and demonstrating genuine care for consumer well-being and environmental impact.\n\n12. Better Together\n\nRising communities offer connection and support against digital isolation, with brands promoting spaces for connection and shared experiences.\n\nOpportunity: Empower marginalized communities\n\nAddress economic disparities and promote cultural inclusion by providing tools and resources for the economic empowerment of underrepresented communities. This not only equips specific communities with the means to increase their wealth, but also ensures that their stories and perspectives are heard and valued in mainstream media.\n\nDesign Trends | Access\n\nThe last pillar, Access, envisions a future in which resources are universally accessible, advocating the democratization of resources. It highlights the role of design in ensuring that progress and benefits are shared inclusively, contributing to the collective good.\n\n13. Play it Smart\n\nConsumers and brands are adapting to the rising cost of living, focusing on smart spending and economical, environmentally conscious solutions.\n\nOpportunity: Transparent pricing\n\nEmpower consumers by developing an interactive platform that visually breaks down the costs of products. This platform could graphically represent how much is spent on raw materials, manufacturing, marketing and distribution, employing infographics and intuitive UI/UX.\n\n14. Micro Mobility War\n\nCities around the world are turning to ecological micro mobility, with alternative methods of travel, changing the urban landscape.\n\nOpportunity: Mobility partnerships\n\nBrands from different sectors, from technology to fashion, can form partnerships with micromobility solutions. For example, a technology brand could collaborate with city bicycle programs to create smart helmets equipped with GPS and safety features. Or a clothing brand could create specific outfits for scooter users, with elements of safety, comfort and style.\n\n15. Web3 to the People\n\nWeb3 is reformulating brand involvement with transparency, ethics and decentralized control.\n\nOpportunity: Transparent supply chain solutions\n\nUsing blockchain to make supply chains more transparent and ethical. This can be an important selling point for eco-conscious consumers who value sustainability and ethical practices. Brands can demonstrate their commitment to these values by providing customers with a transparent view of the product journey, from production to delivery.\n\nTwo years ago, CBA B+G embarked on a transformative journey by adopting a remote working model. This change was not only a response to global circumstances, but also a step towards innovation and adaptation to the new paradigms of the corporate world. The transition to remote working brought with it the need to adapt to digital processes, embracing the concept of flexible working. Today, we revisit the experience to understand how we have navigated these digital waters and what lessons have been learned along the way.\n\nOur reflection is inspired by the conversation we had with Fernanda Mourão, Architect of the Future of Work, our guest at Café+ in November 2023 to talk about the topic. Fernanda is an expert on the subject and provided insights and good observations on the remote, hybrid and face-to-face models in the search for greater productivity and quality of life.\n\nInsights into the flexible working model\n\n1. Space has become a working tool: Work is no longer a place but an activity. Spaces are now meeting places and the company culture is embodied in these environments.\n\n2. Onboarding requires a lot of attention: Because it is relatively new, the flexible or hybrid work model requires a more careful integration and onboarding process, especially for newcomers and junior employees.\n\n3. Adaptation and adjustment of perspective: The mechanisms for managing remote work have evolved rapidly, as has our adaptation to them. Natalia Azevedo, Senior Designer at CBA B+G, makes this point: “One thing we hear a lot is ‘in person we could get up and go to the colleague’s desk to talk’, as something that some people miss a lot. However, reading about the subject, there is a counterpoint from people who, when they were in the office, thought this was a terrible thing… I find this change in perspective very interesting, it shows how much we are biased by the ‘ideal of extroversion’ and we don’t even realize it.”\n\n4. Self-management is key: Flexible working requires more robust planning and self-management skills, without relinquishing responsibility for the company. This can be a challenge for some managers. A good example is Spotify, which offers remote working strategies and options, with an emphasis on employer branding.\n\n5. Romanticization vs. Reality: Recognize that not everyone is suited to being a “digital nomad” and that remote work is not a perfect, unanimous world ready to be inhabited. It has to be built – and in a collaborative way.\n\n6. Small talk has its value: It’s very important to create rituals that promote interactions not strictly related to work, adapting the dynamics of “small talk” to the online environment. We know that it’s not possible to reproduce the face-to-face experience in the digital world, but there are mechanisms to escape the distance and impersonality imposed by physical absence.\n\n7. Quality of life and sustainability: The remote model offers a better individual quality of life and allows the inclusion of employees from different parts of the world. For Mateus Potumati, Verbal Designer at CBA B+G, “the exclusively remote model, as well as avoiding wasted time and increased stress, is much more sustainable. A company that can adopt it is making a huge contribution to reducing its carbon footprint. This, in my opinion, should even be encouraged by governments.”\n\n8. The end of physical borders: An undeniable benefit of the remote model is the possibility of working with people from different corners of Brazil – and the world. This is not only beneficial for the work itself: it means a huge gain in diversity, inclusion and cultural breadth.\n\n9.Mobility and new dynamics in the city: Supported by technology, the dynamics of everyday life have taken on new aspects, generating an impact on the environment – transportation, demographics and sustainability are being rethought.\n\n10. New responsibilities for leaders and subordinates: The relationship with work has taken on new contours in terms of well-being, mental health and geographical freedom, as well as demanding greater self-knowledge from those who lead and are led. Everyone wins.\n\nWhile CBA B+G positions itself as a “laboratory” company with a 100% remote working model, we recognize the advantages and disadvantages and are constantly learning. “Adopting the remote working model has imposed new challenges on us, such as reviewing results, metrics and behaviors. But I’m sure that this change contributes and will contribute to the long-term success of our organization,” comments Luís Bartolomei, CEO of CBA B+G.\n\nThe experience so far suggests that, despite the nostalgia for the office and the unique challenges of the remote model, there is more to be gained from deepening and improving this flexible format, especially in the context of large cities with their difficulties in getting around. We will continue to explore and discuss this topic, always open to learning and adapting to better meet the needs of our team and clients.\n\nDesign is not just about visual elements, but also about creating a multisensory experience for customers. This can include using sound, touch, and even smell to create a more immersive brand experience.\n\nMake your assets iconic\n\nExplore the brand assets all the way, inviting the audience to see the world through the brand’s unique perspective. Think of your product shape as a portal to a large ecosystem… Ask yourself questions such as ‘Is there any singular characteristics of my brand I should explore?’ or ‘If my brand dropped the logo or wordmark, would people still recognize it?’\n\nExplore the senses\n\nThe 5 senses open a gate of multi sensorial experience that creates a powerful emotional bond that people will never forget – and they will never see your brand the same way again.\n\nMaggi sensorial culinary guide for the disabled\n\nCooking Blindly is a 130-page sensory guide that aims to stimulate the five senses, designed for people with different levels of visual impairment.\n\nCompanies and brands with a sustainable purpose can play a leading role in these transformations, generating a product-as-a-service offer (product-service system) to meet user needs and generate value. It is also necessary to develop brand-users relationships, seeking to understand their motivations, consumption habits and information needs.\n\nBelow we list some examples of brands that take part in this movement:\n\nPantys: a B-certified company for menstruation products, including menstrual panties, tampons, and other clinically tested solutions. The products are vegan, 100% carbon neutral and reusable.\n\nJá fui mandioca: “like the skin of a fruit” – startup of 100% compostable cassava biopackaging technology that turns into fertilizer in up to 90 days.\n\nB.O.B: born in 2019, a brand with the aim of acting against plastic pollution, offering bath products in bars with a low environmental impact and low water footprint.\n\nDesembala: cleaning products with plastic spray bottles that can be reused for a lifetime; the concentrated sachets completely dissolve in water.\n\nBefore having an idea for behavioral change, it is first necessary to fall in love with the problem, observing or interviewing individuals, trying to put yourself in their shoes. You will be surprised to note that a great deal of the thoughts and beliefs that each one holds are their own projected worldview, and not necessarily that of the target audience they wish to influence.\n\nLígia Dembinski, Design Manager & ESG Leader\n\nSince 2008, CBA B+G had been operating in a former warehouse on Rua Álvaro Rodrigues in the district of Brooklin, in São Paulo. The place perfectly matched us: it was an inviting space for teamwork, full of green areas and environments designed for collaboration, co-creation, and prototyping. We had created a very special environment over the years, that was loved and desired by everyone who had ever been there – employees, customers, or business partners.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic landed in Brazil. Like so many other companies, we had to adapt to the urgency of remote work to maintain the safety of each of the then-eighty employees. It wasn’t easy, we weren’t prepared. Almost nothing was in the cloud; we relied on a local server and heavy, immutable working tools. Many designers and production professionals had to take home their computers, mostly desktops, in a hurry. Chairs, ergonomic supports, monitors, and personal items had to be packed, and in addition to the logistic struggle, leaving our comfortable and beloved shed so abruptly felt as if a piece of our identity as CBA B+G had been ripped away.\n\nWe entered 2021 with many restrictions on social interaction, so we were forced to stick with the remote model. We noticed that companies of all sizes around the world were permanently adopting the hybrid or remote model. We realized it was a one-way path. Even after the end of the pandemic, the attitude toward work and productivity in organizations would never be the same. We chose the remote first model and said goodbye to the space we occupied, knowing that, of all the scenarios, the physical no longer had adherence to the new reality of work relationships, and the hybrid would be a potential combination of the worst of both worlds, preventing the cultural turn that we so desperately needed. It was not an easy decision, but I am confident that we made the right choice, a choice that contributed to ensuring the sustainability and success of our organization in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the structural challenges, we face an even greater cultural challenge. No matter how well a group of people works remotely, they miss getting together outside business meetings: bumping into each other in corridors, having coffee together, or celebrating birthdays. This is both natural and human. We recognize the importance of maintaining and nurturing this type of human connection, which is why we created our Get Together – in-person bonding events held every three months. Furthermore, by establishing a strong Culture and People department and improving the Communication department, we enhanced listening and increased the frequency and quality of content aimed at internal audiences. We also provide the benefit of a coworking network with over 1600 workspaces throughout Brazil to encourage meetings between teams that are in the same city.\n\n– Multidisciplinary approach\n\nDesign thinking emphasizes the value of assembling a diverse team, including the different stakeholders and users of the company’s product or service, to avoid having one viewpoint dominate the outcome. This combination enables us to examine the issue from various angles and ask the pertinent questions, such as: Is it desirable? Can we really do that? Does this make sense for my business?\n\n– Abductive reasoning\n\nAbductive reasoning derives from design thinking. Most business school programs teach deductive reasoning – from rules to conclusions – and inductive reasoning – from examples to rules. In clearly defined contexts, both deductive and inductive reasoning perform well. Working with businesses, however, frequently entails having access to insufficient information in a highly complex system. The concept of wicked problems, a term coined by Herbert Simon – a scientist and the inventor of design thinking, explains it: the more complex and multidimensional the problems, the more they demand a collaborative methodology and a deep understanding of human needs. Therefore, abductive thinking, a combination of inductive and deductive reasoning, is actually more suitable for such situations.\n\n– Focus on the user\n\nBusiness design uses user-centered and empathic design approaches. The starting point of any challenge is people. Every strategy is built based on a deep understanding of users, including information on their problems, objectives, and pain points. This helps us develop solutions that best fit their lifestyles.\n\n– Prototyping\n\nBusiness designers create prototypes not only to prove their validity but also to learn. To come up with the best-case scenario, we don’t simply consult a spreadsheet. We launch products and services to test the business. We develop financial projections and business cases to prove the financial viability of a product. We outline product ideas that represent strategic trade-offs to inform our strategic decisions. We create extreme business model scenarios and use them as prototypes to learn from customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. We occasionally produce business pitches that help make new business ideas concrete so that organizations can support the development of spin-offs or fund a startup.\n\nHow can CBA B+G help?\n\nThe discipline of business design is relatively new, the result of the growing pressure on design teams and design agencies to adapt their work to a business context. Today, it is part of CBA B+G’s worldview on design. From graphic to business design, we believe that design is first and foremost a way of thinking that uses methods and mental models to solve problems based on the consumer experience. We work beyond the surface of our clients’ businesses, fully meeting their needs through projects that include branding, service design, marketing, and business modeling.\n\nIf you want to know more about the subject or if you are interested in working with us on a project, do not hesitate to contact us."
