Object-oriented language based on prototype

Lisaac is a small prototype-based programming language. The ideas in

Lisaac are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self

(prototype-based) and Eiffel (design by contract). It has the following

features:

.

* pure object language

* very fast (like C code)

* dynamic and multiple inheritance

* dynamic definition slots

* static typing (invariant)

* generic types

* auto-cast type system

* programming by contract

* interrupt manager

* include C code facilities
