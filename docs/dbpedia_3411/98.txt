Lisaac is a small object prototype-based programming language created to enable the implementation of the Isaac operating system as part of Benoit Sonntag's thesis. Since Lisaac was created to support the development of an operating system, it has strong support for implementing low level features even though it is itself a high level language. The language was inspired by Smalltalk (everything is an object), Self (prototype based programming), and Eiffel (design by contract), but it has the distinction of being suitable to systems level programming through many techniques such as optimization of type predictions and code specialization.

In the performance benchmark The Computer Language Benchmarks Game, Lisaac currently places #5, essentially neck-and-neck with C and C++.
