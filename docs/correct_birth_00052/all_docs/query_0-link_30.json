        "text": "American composer and musician Frank Zappa entered the history of rock music as an unsurpassed experimenter. His innovative ideas inspired musicians in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. His legacy is still interesting to those who are looking for their own style in music.\n\nAmong his associates and followers were famous musicians: Adrian Bale, Alice Cooper, Steve Vai. American guitarist and composer Trey Anastasio expressed his opinion about his work as follows: “Zappa is 100% original.\n\nThe music industry puts pressure on people with incredible force. Frank never wavered. It's incredible.\"\n\nChildhood and youth of Frank Zappa\n\nFrank Vincent Zappa was born December 21, 1940. His family then lived in Baltimore, Maryland. Due to the father's work, which was associated with the military-industrial complex, the parents and their four children constantly moved. From childhood, Frank was interested in chemistry. It was connected with the work of the father.\n\nHe constantly brought home test tubes, gas masks, Petri dishes with mercury balls and various chemicals. Frank satisfied his curiosity by conducting chemical experiments. Like all boys, he became interested in experiments with gunpowder and pistons. One of them nearly cost the boy his life.\n\nFrank Zappa preferred music lessons. But later the musician claimed that the \"chemical mindset\" manifested itself in his music.\n\nAt the age of 12, he became interested in drums and attended Keith McKilopp's courses. The teacher taught the children the Scottish school of drumming. Taking the necessary knowledge from the teacher, Frank continued his studies on his own.\n\nFirst he practiced on a rented drum, then on furniture and all the tools at hand. In 1956, Zappa was already playing in the school band and brass band. Then he persuaded his parents to buy him a drum set.\n\nComprehending classical music\n\nAs \"teaching aids\" Zappa used records. He bought records and made rhythmic drawings. The more complex the composition, the more interesting it was for him. The teenager's favorite composers were Igor Stravinsky, Edgar Varèse, Anton Webern.\n\nThe record with the compositions of Varèse Frank put to everyone who came to visit him. It was a kind of intelligence test. Now, with the same intentions, Zappa fans turn on his music to their guests.\n\nFrank Zappa studied music by listening to hundreds of songs and listening to the opinions of people whom he called his musical mentors. The school bandleader, Mr. Cavelman, first told him about 12-tone music.\n\nThe music teacher at Entelope Valley School, Mr. Ballard, trusted him several times to conduct the orchestra. He then kicked a teenager out of the band for smoking while in uniform, doing Frank an invaluable favor.\n\nThe bandleader saved him from the boring job of drumming during football matches. English teacher Don Cerveris, having written his first screenplay, gave Frank his first film dubbing job.\n\nThe beginning of the career of the musician Frank Zappa\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Zappa moved to Los Angeles. He launched a career as a musician, composer, producer, film director and one of the most outrageous artists in the world of rock music.\n\nThe main motto of his work was the expression of his own opinion. Critics accused him of vulgarity, musicians - of illiteracy. And the audience enthusiastically accepted any Frank Zappa show.\n\nIt all started with Freak Out! (1966). It was recorded with The Mothers of Invention. The team was originally called Mothers (from the abusive word motherfucker, which, translated from musical slang, meant \"virtuoso musician\").\n\nDuring the period of worship of The Beatles and other fashionable artists, the appearance of long-haired guys dressed in incomprehensible clothes was a challenge to society.\n\nFrank Zappa and electronic music\n\nIn the album, released in 1968, Zappa finally declared his electronic approach to music. Cruising with Ruben & the Jets was very different from his debut album. He became the fourth in the group The Mothers of Invention. Since then, Zappa has not changed his chosen style.\n\nIn the 1970s of the last century, Frank Zappa continued to experiment in the fusion style. He also made the film \"200 Motels\", defended his rights as a musician and producer in lawsuits. These years were the peak of his career.\n\nOn numerous tours there were hundreds of thousands of fans of his unusual style. He recorded his music with the London Symphony Orchestra. His speeches in the courts were parsed for quotes. Frank Zappa became the most successful business musician in rock music. 1979 saw the release of two best-selling albums, Sheik Yerbouti and Joe's Garage.\n\nIn the 1980s, the musician preferred instrumental experiments even more. He released three instrumental albums in 1981. Zappa used the Synclavier as his studio instrument.\n\nSubsequent creativity was associated with this instrument. Zappa recorded and sold the first instrumental albums on order. But they were in great demand. CBS Records released their release internationally.\n\nRise in popularity in Eastern Europe\n\nIn the 1990s, Frank Zappa was enthusiastically welcomed in the post-Soviet countries. He himself did not expect such a number of fans in Eastern Europe.\n\nHe visited Czechoslovakia. President Havel was an avid admirer of the artist. In January 1990, at the invitation of Stas Namin, Zappa arrived in Moscow. He visited countries as a businessman. The doctor's diagnosis of \"Prostate Cancer\" made adjustments to the artist's tour schedule.\n\nFrank Zappa went down in history as an ardent opponent of everything that infringes on the freedom of choice of a person. He opposed the political system, religious dogmas, the education system. His famous speech to the Senate on September 19, 1985, was a critique of the activities of the Parent Center for Music Production.\n\nIn his usual snarky manner, Zappa proved that all the proposals of the Center are a direct path to censorship, and therefore to the violation of human rights. The musician not only declared about the freedom of the individual in words. He showed this by the example of his life and work. The musician was awarded the Grammy Award. Frank Zappa is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFrank has always been supported by his family. The first marriage to Catherine Sherman lasted 4 years. With the \"witch\" Gail (Adelaide Gali Slotman), Zappa lived from 1967 to 1993. In marriage, they had sons Dweezil and Ahmet, daughters Mun and Diva.\n\nFrank Zappa's last tour\n\nOn December 5, 1993, the family reported that on December 4, 1993, Frank Zappa went on his \"last tour\" at approximately 18.00:XNUMX pm."
