        "text": "Francis Zappa (Partinico, Sicily, May 7 1906[1] - April 7, 1973) was the father of Frank Zappa. In the 1930 and 1940 US Census he is listed as Frank Zappa.\n\nFirst guitar I played on was my father's guitar.[2]\n\nZappa's father was born in 1906 as the first son of Vincenzo Zappa (1876) and Rosaria di Lorenzo (1875 - 1951). They arrived in the US in 1907 and settled in Maryland where they ran a barbershop[3]. He went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study history in 1926 and graduated in 1930. He supported himself while studying by working as a barber until, in 1928, he met fellow student Jack Wardlaw[4] who was starting a banjo band[5] and asked him to play guitar with them.\n\nZappa bought a guitar in Raleigh and for the next three years played in two popular bands headed by Wardlaw…. In the Banjo Boys he played hillbilly and ragtime guitar, while in the Carolina Tar Heels he performed jazz music and Dixieland on both guitar and banjo.[6]\n\nMy dad... played guitar in some sort of ‘strolling crooner’ trio. (I still get birthday cards from the insurance company owned by Jack Wardlaw, the banjo player.) They used to go from dormitory window to dormitory window, serenading coeds with songs like ‘Little Red Wing’. [3]\n\nHis serenading attracted fellow student Nel Cheek. They married and, in November 1931, had a daughter Ann Zappa.[7] Francis was teaching at Rose Hill, North Carolina but growing marital problems and dissatisfaction led him to take a teaching job back in Baltimore. His wife did not want to leave her family and friends so they divorced and Ann stayed with her mother[8]\n\nIn Baltimore he taught history at Loyola College in Maryland.[9] Around 1935 he met Rose Marie Colimore whom he dated for four years. On 11 June 1939 they married and resided at the Colimore family home.[10] [11]. They had four children; three sons Frank (1940-1993), Bobby (1943-2018) and Carl (1948-2020) and one daughter Candy (1951).\n\nHe worked at various times as an analyst, engineer and metallurgist for the Lockheed and Convair aircraft corporations. His succession of jobs required the family to move every few years.\n\nHe wrote a book \"CHANCES: And How to Take Them\" (Art-Craft, 1966). He can be seen on the cover of We're Only In It For The Money, His son dedicated a chapter of his The Real Frank Zappa Book to him.\n\nMy Dad died while I was on the road. We were working at the Circle Star Theater in Phoenix[12], Arizona, in 1973. Gail made the funeral arrangements in my absence...[3]\n\nIn 1982, prior to a concert in Palermo which ended in a riot, Zappa visited his father's birthplace Partinico:\n\nI got a pretty good idea of what my Sicilian roots are like after seeing the town of Partinico - it was pretty bleak.[13]"
