It doesn’t work if it is not open.\n\n~Frank Zappa\n\nMy best advice to anyone who wants to raise a happy, mentally healthy child is: Keep him or her as far away from a church as you can.\n\n~Frank Zappa\n\nThe late great Frank Zappa was born in 1940\n\n….although he led groups that could be called rock & roll bands for much of his career, he used them to create a hybrid style that bordered on jazz and complicated, modern serious music, sometimes inducing orchestras to play along. As if his music were not challenging enough, he overlay it with highly satirical and sometimes abstractly humorous lyrics and song titles that marked him as coming out of a provocative literary tradition that included Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and edgy comedians like Lenny Bruce.\n\n~William Ruhlmann (allmusic.com)\n\nFrom January 12, 1995, Lou Reed inducts Frank Zappa into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame:\n\nClip from the “Baby Snakes” DVD:\n\n(1977 Halloween concert at New York City’s Palladium Theater)\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nBirth name Frank Vincent Zappa Born December 21, 1940\n\nBaltimore, Maryland, U.S. Died December 4, 1993 (aged 52)\n\nLos Angeles, California, U.S. Genres Rock, jazz, classical, experimental Occupations Singer-songwriter, musician, conductor, producer Instruments Vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synclavier, drums Years active 1955–93 Labels Verve, Bizarre, Straight,DiscReet, Zappa, Barking Pumpkin Associated acts The Mothers of Invention\n\nCaptain Beefheart Website zappa.com\n\nFrank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American composer, singer-songwriter, guitarist, recording engineer, record producer and film director. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa wrote rock, jazz, orchestral and musique concrète works. He also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa produced almost all of the more than 60 albums he released with the band The Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern along with 1950s rhythm and blues music. He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; he later switched to electric guitar.\n\nLet us include a full show, the incredible, An Evening With Frank Zappa from 1981:\n\nSet list:\n\nBlack Napkins – Montana – Easy Meat – Beauty Knows No Pain – Charlie’s Enormous Mouth – Fine Girl – Teen-age Wind – Harder Than Your Husband – Bamboozled By Love – We’re Turning Again – Alien Orifice – Flakes – Broken Hearts Are For Assholes – You Are What You Is – Mudd Club – The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing – Dumb All Over – Heavenly Bank Account – Suicide Chump – Jumbo Go Away – Stevie’s Spanking – The Torture Never Stops – Strictly Genteel – The Illinois Enema Bandit\n\nPlease check out that great finale: The Illinois Enema Bandit at 1:45\n\nMuffin Man – Live 1977:\n\nZappa was a self-taught composer and performer, and his diverse musical influences led him to create music that was often difficult to categorize. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. His later albums shared this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical. His lyrics—often humorously—reflected his iconoclastic view of established social and political processes, structures and movements. He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship.\n\nOne of Frank’s last interviews, conducted by NBC’s Jamie Gangel for the Today Show (1993):\n\nHe was a highly productive and prolific artist and gained widespread critical acclaim. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and for most of his career was able to work as an independent artist. He also remains a major influence on musicians and composers. Zappa was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. Zappa was married to Kathryn J. “Kay” Sherman from 1960 to 1964. In 1967, he married Adelaide Gail Sloatman, with whom he remained until his death from prostate cancer in 1993. They had four children: Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet Emuukha Rodan and Diva Thin Muffin Pigeen.\n\nAlbum of The Day:\n\nHot Rats (1969):\n\nOther December 21:\n\nCarl Dean Wilson (December 21, 1946 – February 6, 1998) was an American rock and roll singer, guitarist and composer, best known as a founding member, lead guitarist and occasional lead vocalist of The Beach Boys. Wilson performed lead vocals on a number of notable songs by the Beach Boys, including “Good Vibrations” and “God Only Knows”.Carl Wilson was the youngest brother of fellow Beach Boys Dennis and Brian Wilson and cousin of Beach Boy Mike Love. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Wilson died of cancer in 1998 while still actively touring and recording with the Beach Boys and on varied solo projects.\n\nAlbert King (April 25, 1923 – December 21, 1992) was an American blues guitarist and singer, and a major influence in the world of blues guitar playing. On December 11th, 2012, it was announced that King would be posthumously inducted into the 2013 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n“A Change Is Gonna Come” is a 1964 single by R&B singer-songwriter Sam Cooke, written and first recorded in 1963 and released under the RCA Victor label shortly after his death in late 1964. Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles, the song came to exemplify the 1960s’ Civil Rights Movement. The song has gained in popularity and critical acclaim in the decades since its release, and is #12 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nPublished 1963 (ABKCO) Released December 22, 1964 (single) Recorded December 21, 1963\n\nRCA Studios\n\n(Los Angeles, California) Genre Soul, R&B Length 3:12 Label RCA Victor Writer Sam Cooke Producer Hugo Peretti\n\nLuigi Creatore\n\n-Egil & Hallgeir"
