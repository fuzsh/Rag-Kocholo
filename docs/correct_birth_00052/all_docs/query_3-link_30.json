        "text": "American actress and author\n\nMoon Unit Zappa (born September 28, 1967) is an American actress, singer, and author. She is the daughter of musician Frank Zappa.\n\nMoon Zappa was born in New York City, the eldest child of Gail (née Sloatman) and musician Frank Zappa.[1] She has three younger siblings: Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva. Zappa's father was of Sicilian, Greek-Arab, and French ancestry, and her mother was of German and Portuguese descent.[2] Zappa attended Oakwood School in North Hollywood, California.\n\nZappa first came to public attention in 1982 at the age of 14, when she appeared on her father's hit single \"Valley Girl.\" The song featured Moon's monologue in \"valleyspeak\", slang terms popular with teenage girls in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. \"Valley Girl\" was Frank Zappa's biggest hit in the United States, and popularized phrases from the lyric such as \"grody to the max\" and \"gag me with a spoon.\" The song appeared on her father's 1982 album Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Zappa and her brother Dweezil were frequent guest VJs on MTV.\n\nShe sang on Dweezil's songs \"My Mother Is a Space Cadet\" b/w \"Crunchy Water\" in 1982 and \"Let's Talk About It\" from the album Havin' a Bad Day in 1986.\n\nAs a teenager, Zappa acted in the television series CHiPs, The Facts of Life, and the film Nightmares.[1] While still 18, she was a technical consultant and appeared in several episodes of Fast Times. As an adult, she has worked as a stand-up comic, magazine writer, and actress, appearing in the films National Lampoon's European Vacation and Spirit of '76, the television sitcom Normal Life, and The Super Mario Bros. Super Show.\n\nZappa appeared as a niqab-clad Muslim woman in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, as Ted Mosby's cousin Stacy in an episode of How I Met Your Mother, and on an episode (\"Pampered to a Pulp\") of Roseanne. In 2013, Zappa was the voice of Mrs. Lamber on FOX Broadcasting's Animation Domination High-Def series High School USA!.\n\nIn 2000, Zappa appeared as guest vocalist on Kip Winger's third solo album Songs from the Ocean Floor. She is the author of the novel America, the Beautiful, published in 2001.[3] She has also written for The New York Times.[4] In a 2016 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Zappa said she was working on a book about growing up in her \"crazy house.\"[5]\n\nZappa married Paul Doucette, drummer and rhythm guitarist for American pop group Matchbox Twenty, in June 2002. They have one child, Mathilda Plum Doucette. They divorced in 2014.[6]\n\nFollowing the death of Zappa's mother, Gail, in October 2015, it was revealed that her siblings Ahmet and Diva were given control of the Zappa family trust with shares of 30% each, while Moon and her brother Dweezil were given smaller shares of 20% each.[7] Speaking to the Los Angeles Times in 2016, Zappa called it \"the most hideous shock of [her] life.\"[7] As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will reportedly not receive any distributions from the trust until it is profitable—as of 2016 , it was millions of dollars in debt—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make money from their father's music or merchandise bearing his name.[7]\n\nIn 2018, the Zappa siblings were reported to have legally reconciled their differences, with Dweezil noting \"It may be a bumpy road at times – we are a passionate Italian family – but we have decided to work toward privately discussing issues rather than using public forums and lawyers.\"[8]\n\nZappa's memoir, Earth to Moon, will be released in August 2024.[9][10]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1983 Nightmares Pamela 1985 National Lampoon's European Vacation Rusty's California Girl 1985 The Boys Next Door Nancy 1987 Heartbeat Band Performer Direct-to-video 1989 Listen to Me Longnecker 1989 Heartstopper Lenora Clayton 1990 The Spirit of '76 Cheryl Dickman 1992 Little Sister Venus 1994 Dark Side of Genius Carrie 1996 Love Always Mary Ellen 1997 The Girl Gets Moe Hostess Jillian 1997 Pterodactyl Woman from Beverly Hills Susie 1998 Anarchy TV Katie 1998 Jack Frost School Teacher Uncredited 2000 Brutal Truth Alex 2000 Behind the Seams Astric 2010 Love & Distrust Donna Direct-to-video 2011 Last Will Belinda DeNovi\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 CHiPs Tami Episode: \"Speedway Fever\" 1985 The Facts of Life Sondra Episode: \"The Last Drive-In\" 1986 Fast Times Barbara 6 episodes 1987 Student Exchange Murphy the Biker Television film 1989 The Super Mario Bros.
