        "text": "Frank Zappa / The Mothers of Invention\n\nFrank Zappa (1940-1993) was an American musician, composer, bandleader, and social commentator. He was a highly prolific artist who released over 60 albums throughout his career, spanning a wide range of musical genres including rock, jazz, fusion, avant-garde, and classical.\n\nZappa was born in Baltimore, Maryland and grew up in California. He began playing music at a young age and was particularly drawn to the guitar. In the 1960s, he formed the band The Mothers of Invention, which became known for their unconventional, experimental approach to rock music.\n\nZappa's music was characterized by its complexity, humor, and social commentary. He was known for his virtuosic guitar playing and his ability to seamlessly blend diverse musical styles into his compositions. He was also a skilled orchestrator and conductor, and worked with a wide range of musicians and ensembles throughout his career.\n\nIn addition to his music, Zappa was a vocal critic of censorship and an advocate for artistic freedom. He testified before the U.S. Congress in 1985 about the dangers of censorship in the music industry, and founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) to fight against censorship efforts.\n\nZappa passed away in 1993 at the age of 52 due to complications from prostate cancer. He left behind a legacy as one of the most innovative and influential musicians of the 20th century, whose music continues to inspire and challenge listeners to this day.\n\nBorn Frank Vincent Zappa, December 21, 1940, Baltimore, Maryland; died December 4, 1993, Los Angeles, California.
