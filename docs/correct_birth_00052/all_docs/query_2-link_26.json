        "text": "Frank Zappa\n\nSelf-taught American composer, electric guitarist, singer and songwriter Frank Zappa was born in Maryland on 21 December 1940 to parents of Italian and French descent. Whilst at school he became interested in the experimental percussion-based music of Edgard Var√®se and also in 1950s rhythm and blues, and began writing classical music. This developed into an eclectic style which became difficult to categorize.\n\nIn the 1960s he was guitarist in the band The Mothers of Invention.\n\nZappa wrote his own lyrics to his songs, and these reflected his criticism of education, religion, the establishment and censorship.\n\nHe died in Los Angeles on 4 December 1993, aged 52, leaving a reputation as one of the most original composers and guitarists of his time, but remains as a strong influence on many contemporary composers and other musicians.\n\nA selection of articles about Frank Zappa"
