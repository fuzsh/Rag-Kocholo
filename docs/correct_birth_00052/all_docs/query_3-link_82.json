        "text": "Rancho Cucamonga High School student Aaron Hernandez was challenged to write a paper on finding a problem and going about how to solve it.\n\nOthers given government teacher Rebecca Guerrero’s assignment choose more typical topics, such as school security or the dos and don’ts of school-time apparel.\n\nAnyone who knows Aaron, 17, might not be surprised he wrote his paper about outrageous, innovative, jazz-rock fusionist Frank Zappa, one of his favorite musicians. When he learned Zappa spent his early years in Rancho Cucamonga but has never been officially recognized, that cinched it for him: He had to tell everyone.\n\n“I was really nervous,” the soft-spoken honor student said of the night he pitched the idea of honoring Zappa during a City Council meeting in November.\n\nAaron spoke about how Jack Benny, whose comical rendition of a train stop in “Cu-ca-monga!” earned him a statue that now stands at Chaffey College, as well as several streets named after city pioneers, saying Zappa belonged in that same group.\n\nYet, aside from a temporary exhibit at the library five years ago, there’s been no permanent tribute to the rock-jazz artist who developed his style in the city as an influential musician/composer and recording artist.\n\n“In honor of his memory and talents known throughout the world, I suggest this influential local figure also receive some sort of dedication in this city to ensure his memory and roots will not be forgotten and instead added on to the incredible history of Rancho Cucamonga,” Aaron concluded that night to a round of applause.\n\nAt the end of December, he turned in his paper. He’s talking to the city’s art department about a possible plaque and installation. One idea is to place it at Chaffey College, where Zappa spent a semester and used college band members as part of the Pomona Valley Symphony Orchestra for the soundtrack to the low-budget movie “The World’s Greatest Sinner.”\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Jan. 23, Aaron said his buddy, Steven Gust, wants to make this his Eagle Scout project. But the two haven’t worked out the details, Aaron said.\n\nWhat about a statue?\n\n“A statue would be nice,” Aaron said politely, adding: “He doesn’t seem like a statue guy.”\n\nIn fact, during one of his last TV interviews, Zappa said: “It is not important to even be remembered.”\n\nFrank Vincent Zappa was born Dec. 21, 1940 in Baltimore. His family moved to California where he attended eighth and ninth grade at Claremont High but after a move to the high desert, he graduated from Antelope Valley High in 1958.\n\nHe came to Rancho Cucamonga to attend Chaffey in 1960. Later, he began making music at friend Paul Buff’s Pal Recorders, a recording studio at 8040 Archibald Ave. There Zappa wrote “Memories of El Monte,” performed by The Penguins, a semi-hit after Zappa bought the place and changed the name to Studio Z.\n\nAaron began reciting Zappa’s history during the interview, at one point singing the song from a cassette tape given him by his grandmother. Zappa also did a song entitled “Cucamonga,” Aaron said. As part of his band The Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist, Zappa made 60 albums and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Zappa became a well-known singer, songwriter, guitar player, free-speech advocate and composer, often incorporating sounds with unusual musical threads and comical lyrics. Later in life, he crafted classical pieces performed in Europe and Asia to standing ovations.\n\nA four-song suite about Eskimos fighting fur trappers led to a hit in 1974 from his solo album “Apostrophe” called “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow.” When a photographer from this newspaper showed him his copy of the LP, Aaron immediately recognized it.\n\n“The guy at the swap meet wanted $30 for it and I couldn’t afford that,” he said. Instead, he checked out CDs from the Rancho Cucamonga Biane Library that he plays in his car.\n\nAaron’s favorite Zappa song is “Peaches En Regalia,” an instrumental piece that attracted much critical acclaim for the quirky artist, who passed away from prostate cancer on Dec. 4, 1993 at age 52.\n\nAaron said Zappa, along with his other favorite progressive rock artists such as Genesis and Steely Dan, don’t resonate with his peers. “Usually, when I talk about stuff like this with people they say: ‘Why do you listen to this old stuff?’ “\n\nHe said he’s drawn to any art form where expression is paramount. And like Zappa, he values free speech. He recently started reading “Naked Lunch,” the William S. Burroughs book banned in the 1960s because of language and descriptions involving a man’s struggle with heroin addiction.\n\nWhen Aaron began playing a Zappa song on his phone, he was asked why the unusual musical style appealed to him more than say, current pop artists.\n\n“It is not just people making a song because they have to. They want to see if they can push the boundaries,” he said.\n\nWhether Frank Zappa receives permanent recognition in town is not known. Aaron will be off to college next year, having applied to Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State Fullerton where he wants to study electrical engineering.\n\nWhat matters is what RCHS Principal Cary Willborn says is the way the assignment required the student to dip his toe into the complexities of the civic arena. “I tell every freshman my job is to get them ready for life after high school,” he said.\n\nAaron says he’s not sure whether Zappa will get a plaque. “Taking civic action is a long process,” he said.\n\nColumnist David Allen contributed to this article."
