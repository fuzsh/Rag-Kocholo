        "text": "Frank Zappa, born on December 21, 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland, was an American musician, composer, and filmmaker. He was known for his eclectic and experimental approach to music, as well as his sharp wit and social commentary. Zappa's career spanned over three decades, during which he recorded an enormous body of work, leaving behind a rich and diverse body of work.\n\nZappa rose to prominence in the 1960s with the formation of his band, The Mothers of Invention. Their debut album, \"Freak Out!\" (1966), was a groundbreaking release that combined elements of rock, jazz, and avant-garde music. The album's satirical lyrics and unconventional sound set the stage for Zappa's subsequent career.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Zappa pushed the boundaries of music with albums like \"Hot Rats\" (1969), \"Joe's Garage\" (1979), and \"Sheik Yerbouti\" (1979). These albums showcased Zappa's virtuosity as a guitarist and his mastery of complex musical arrangements.\n\nIn addition to his music, Zappa was also an outspoken critic of censorship and an advocate for free speech. He testified before the United States Congress in 1985 during hearings on obscenity in music, defending the rights of artists to express themselves without censorship.\n\nZappa's career was marked by his uncompromising commitment to artistic freedom and his disdain for commercialism. He released albums on his own independent record label, Zappa Records, and often financed his projects himself to maintain creative control.\n\nTragically, Zappa was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 and passed away on December 4, 1993, at the age of 52. Despite his untimely death, his legacy lives on through his music, which continues to inspire and influence artists across genres.\n\nFrank Zappa's impact on music and culture is immeasurable. His fearless experimentation, irreverent humour, and uncompromising individualism have earned him a place as one of the most innovative and influential musicians of the 20th century."
