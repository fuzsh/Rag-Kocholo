        "text": "Frank Zappa (1940-1993), the American composer, musician, and producer has been (and continues to be) a significant influence on musicians of all types. I for one found value in his musical creations, novel forms of expression, and quirky sense of humor. He put a harsh spotlight on the often cut-throat and cynical business of commercial music while forging his own public following as an underground cult-figure. Zappa regularly pushed the envelope about what was possible - both musically and culturally - and adapted his music comfortably to a diversity of styles and mediums. He thought outside of the box, and continued to innovate throughout his career - eventually realizing his life-long ambition to become a composer of “serious” chamber and orchestral music. Given that he was entirely self-taught, this was not an insignificant achievement.\n\nIn the late-60s and early-70s Zappa assumed the role as an articulate counter-culture spokesperson concerning the social issues of rock music. I remember that he appeared on a late evening TV talk show in the New York area with the bearded confrontational late-night talk-show personality Alan Burke. Burke was unabashedly rude, and would often scream at his guests on the air. I remember that he once threw someone out of the studio for being a “Communist.” When Frank Zappa was on the program, members of the studio audience were allowed to come up and ask questions. Often these people were intentionally planted in the house – hired actors armed with provocative scripts tweaked to create as much controversy as possible – especially during ratings season. An attractive blond woman appeared at the microphone (I assume she was blond, but I was viewing it on a small B&W TV with rabbit ears). She said, “Mr. Zappa, I find your music disgusting.” Without batting an eye, Zappa replied, “don’t worry little girl, someday you’ll grow up.”\n\nAs with the avant-garde composer John Cage, Zappa too was predispos ed toward Dadaist histrionics when on the stage. Even before he grew his scary looking signature mustache, Zappa was injecting humor and absurdity into his act. There is a historic clip on YouTube of Zappa at the age of 22 appearing on the Tonight Show with Steve Allen (1963). Allen, a venerable composer and pianist in his own right, crudely pokes fun at Zappa for his avant-garde antics for a cheep laugh. It's hard to read if Zappa is serious or self-deprecating about performing music on a bicycle with a bass bow. Already as a teenager he was experimenting with Musique concrète and interested in the music of Edgard Varèse. But on the Tonight Show you can’t tell if he was entirely serious about experimental music, or was in cahoots with Allen in making fun of it. It’s an ambiguity and contradiction that will continue throughout Zappa’s career.\n\nIn 2000, the Holland Festival in Amsterdam honored Zappa seven years after his death with a symphonic tribute billed as \"200 Motels - the suite.” Zappa had attempted personally to have his music performed in the festival in 1981, but his bid failed.\n\nI got the phonograph record when it came out, and recently re-listened to it. The works for small orchestra are intriguing. They portray a number of contrasting styles, beginning with the tile track – The Perfect Stranger. Opening with the sound of a doorbell, Zappa spins a musical narrative that draws broadly from a toolkit of standard 20th-century techniques. His orchestration is an amalgam of influences traceable to Messiaen, Gil Evans, Varèse, and Ives. In hearing the work, it reminds me of some of the student works presented at the Composers Conference at Wellesley each summer. There is a youthful innocence and vitality to Zappa’s opus, and he appears to be trying out a wide-assortment of musical gadgets in this piece. Harmonically, it is neither tonal or atonal, but characteristically Zappa. Zappa’s tunes are upbeat, rhythmically awkward, but always make you smile.\n\nNavel Aviation in Art? is only two and a half minutes long, and explores the sonorities of the chamber orchestra in ways that are somewhat similar to what Schoenberg accomplished in the Farben movement of Op. 16. Zappa adds into the mix seemingly random bursts of melodic fragments that emerge from time to time over the more-slowly evolving drone of the orchestra in the background. There is a transcendental feeling to it all, that larks back to The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives as a model of inspiration.\n\nThe third piece for chamber orchestra on the album performed by Ensemble InterContemporain is Dupree’s Paradise. This is much more of a pop composition, but flirts with dissonance and a modern harmonic language to some degree. The melodic and rhythmic inventiveness grabs your attention straight off the bat. Unlike a majority of contemporary music heard today, there is a feeling of buoyant jubilation and dance-like celebration in this work. His orchestration and melodic voice patterns reminds me of his classic rock instrumental work “Peaches En Regalia.” Both of these pieces, although composed decades apart, are cut from the same cloth. Here is a music video of Dupree’s Paradise on Youtube with animations are made by Bruce Bickford.\n\nAlso on the record album is Outside now, again, a Synclavier performance based on a transcription of Zappa's guitar solo in the song \"Outside Now\" from the Joe’s Garage album of 1979. (It turns out that the score can be printed out from the Synclavier digital midi file and was used by the Dutch Asko Ensemble in 2003 in an arrangement by Corrie van Binsbergen). Zappa’s program note for this four minute work describes musicians and performers in a soup line waiting for grant-givers from the National Endowment for the Arts to be dished out. He adds that it is “suited to minimalist choreography.”\n\nThe other pure Synclavier works on the Perfect Stranger album are possibly more interesting than Zappa’s orchestral scores. He seems more at home in an electronic world, where his “orchestration” is less jaded. The electronic music pallet affords Zappa a broader range of expression and freedom to experiment. The Synclavier also allows him to write more complex rhythms than would be practical for a large music ensemble working under the pressures of limited rehearsal time.\n\nAll in all, Zappa’s Perfect Stranger album is hard to define. It’s not hard-edged contemporary art music, and its not mass-market commercial music either. Zappa is a genre unto himself.\n\nWhat did Boulez think about Zappa? Boulez was asked about their collaboration at a panel discussion and open forum at Harvard a few years back by a student. Boulez smiled, and said that he thought Frank was exploring interesting new ideas, and he wished Zappa had lived longer to see where those ideas would have led to.\n\nZappa has a number of other serious works to his name. There is a String Quartet/Quintet of which three parts were performed by the new music group Ensemble Modern along with a Woodwind Quintet “Times Beach” of which Parts II and III were also recorded and released. Ensemble Modern, based in Frankfurt, has released three CDs of Zappa’s music and taken it on tour internationally.\n\nZappa seems to have established himself in Europe as a serious new music composer. For example in November of last year the group ascolta performed a program of Zappa (in arrangement and transcription) at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in England. It including four UK premieres: I was in a Drum, Reagan at Bitburg, Overture to Uncle Sam, and Samba Funk.\n\nAmerican composer and conductor John Adams has led many performance of Zappa’s works for smaller orchestra, including on tour with Ensemble Modern and the London Sinfonietta. Adams wrote with mixed reviews about Zappa’s work in his recent autobiography “Hallelujah Junction” saying, “Curiously, despite their huge name recognition and popularity, Zappa’s ‘classical’ works have yet to be taken up as part of the regular repertoire… There seems to be a quality issue with Zappa’s ‘serious’ works that cannot be gotten around.”\n\nPerhaps it is too early to evaluate the lasting impact of Zappa as a composer of serious contemporary chamber and orchestral music. His notoriety as a counter-culture rock hero certainly contributes to the attention he received in the world of serious art music, but at what price? An on-going cultural filtering process will define the gems from our collective 20th century music repertory, and some of Zappa’s concert works may in fact endure the cut. Fortunately Zappa's work has had the critical initial exposure needed to succeed, and he was able to over-come the financial limitations that plague so many composers today by supporting his own works. Watson writes (p.553) “In working with stadium-scale rock, Zappa managed to make enough money to finance abstract music which most avant-garde composers – either hopelessly under funded, or constrained by the artistic expectations of respectable funding bodies – can only dream of.”\n\nFrank Zappa died of prostate cancer in 1993 at the age of 53. His career lasted over three decades, and he recorded over 60 albums as a soloist and with his group The Mothers of Invention. The Zappa legacy continues in the work of his talented children, who in their own right have gained notoriety…\n\nMoon Unit Zappa (b. 1967), the Zappa’s oldest child, became known to the public at the age of 14 for her monologue in her father’s hit single “Valley Girl” in which she speaks in the “val-speak” regional dialect of southern California teenage girls of that era. She went on to have an acting career (appearing in the movie European Vacation) and is a writer.\n\nDweezil Zappa (b. 1969) derived his unusual name from his fathers’ term for his mothers’ oddly-curled pinkie toe. The hospital refused to register their son with this name on the birth certificate, so his parents officially named him Ian Donald Calvin Euclid Zappa. However, having grow up with the name Dweezil, it was legally changed back again after he was the age of five. He is a rock guitarist and actor. He co-hosted a show on the Food Network, and before getting married to fashion stylist Lauren Knudsen in 2005, had relationships with a number of Hollywood insiders – including Sharon Stone and the daughter of actor Robert Wagner. Dweezil Zappa recently went on an American and European tour playing his father's music, and kicked it off in the Netherlands in May of 2006 at the Heineken Music Hall, Amsterdam.\n\nAhmet Emuukha Rodan Zappa (b. 1974) is a musician who writes screen plays and novels. He co-wrote the song \"Frogs With Dirty Little Lips\" with his father. He married actress Selma Blair in 2004, but the two have divorced.\n\nDiva Thin Muffin Pigeen Zappa (b. 1979) was given her name because she was screaming louder than all the other babies in the hospital nursery.\n\nhttp://www.zappa.com/"
