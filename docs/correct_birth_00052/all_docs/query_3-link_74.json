        "text": "Baltimore is honoring one of its artistic native sons, Frank Zappa.\n\nCity officials were on hand Sunday to dedicate a bust of the eccentric musician. The bronze bust has been installed outside a library in east Baltimore.\n\nZappa was known for everything from novelty rock songs to elaborate classical compositions. He died in 1993.\n\nThe bust is a replica of one that stands in a public square in Vilnius, Lithuania, and was donated to the city by Zappa fans in that country. Zappa was born in Baltimore, but his music was more popular in Europe than in the United States.\n\nHis widow, Gail Zappa, said libraries were essential to her husband's musical education, and that's why she's happy with the placement of the bust."
