        "text": "Frank Zappa (1940-1993) is an American composer, whose work is characterized by a high degree of diversity and creativity. His output of over 60 CDs covers about all styles of the 20th century as rock, doo-wop and jazz as well as modern works for ensembles and orchestras. He also worked as a filmmaker and has a reputation as a critic of American society. After his early death due to prostate cancer, his legacy is governed by a family trust.\n\nEarly years (1958-1961)\n\nZappa was born in Baltimore on December 21, 1940. He became the eldest of four siblings. His father worked as an engineer with varying jobs, which caused the family to have to move frequently. His interest in music first showed itself during his teens, when he became a drummer in local bands. At the age of eighteen he learned to play guitar. At the same time that he was listening to blues, he taught himself to write sheet music and got fascinated by the music of Edgar VarÃ¨se. After graduation Zappa took one semester of formal musical education at Chaffee Junior College, where he met his first wife Kay Sherman. When he had reached twenty, Zappa had enough musical understanding to write orchestra music, next to being able to play the standard pop and jazz repertoire. Playing in bands became his job. The first opportunity to have his sheet music performed came when he got commissioned by Timothy Carey to do the soundtrack for The world's greatest sinner. With the orchestra music recorded in 1961, this film premiered in 1963. In the same year Zappa could record chamber music for another movie, called Run home, slow.\n\nThe lost episodes: Zappa's teens\n\nLost in a whirlpool, Pound for a brown, Sleeping in a jar, Waltz for guitar, Mice, The Blackouts\n\nThe mystery disc #1: movie scores\n\nThe world's greatest sinner (single and soundtrack), Holiday in Berlin, Run home, slow (theme and soundtrack), The little march\n\nSingles (1962-1964)\n\nIn 1961 Zappa first met Paul Buff, who was running a recording studio at Cucamonga. Paul was one of the first to operate a multi-track recorder. Their working relationship intensified in 1963, when they began collaborating for releasing singles. Zappa was involved as player, producer and songwriter. Their biggest success became Buff's Tijuana surf, with Zappa's Grunion run on the b-side. In 2009 Paul opened his Pal and Original sound archives on line, bringing to the public some yet unreleased recordings by Zappa. The money coming in from the Run home, slow, movie gave Zappa the opportunity to take over Buff's studio. He started working on a film project himself, but got thwarted by local officials. A set-up got constructed for arresting him for recording pornographic material. He got a minor sentence and actually had to spend a couple of days in prison. This was sufficient to block his business in Cucamonga.\n\nPal and Original sound: working with Paul Buff\n\nTake your clothes off when you dance, Ronnie sings, Fountain of love, Any way the wind blows, Why don't you do me right, Walkin' out, Waltz, Speed-freak boogie, Metal man, Tiger roach\n\nCucamonga years: singles and broadcast music\n\nOpus 5, Breaktime, Memories of El Monte, Love of my life, Dear Jeepers, Letter from Jeepers, The big surfer, Hey Nelda, Surf along, Grunion run, Everytime I see you, Mr. Clean, Jessie Lee\n\nThe mystery disc #2: projects\n\nThe Uncle Frankie show, I was a teenage malt shop, Status back baby, Toad of the short forest, Charva, Duodenum, Bossa Nova, Power trio, Mondo Hollywood, Original Mothers at the Broadside, Motherly love\n\nFirst line-up of The Mothers Of Invention (1965-1968)\n\nZappa continued to play in bands and took the lead of the Soul Giants, in 1965 re-baptized as The Mothers Of Invention. Freak out!, their first album, got released in 1966 as one of the first double albums in rock history. With Absolutely free from 1967 Zappa could demonstrate what he was capable of as a composer. Brown shoes don't make it is famous for bringing together a multitude of styles, using varying meters and rhythms, as well as an atonal interlude. The sudden rise of the hippie movement incited Zappa to compile We're only in it for the money, a social commentary. No two sequent Zappa albums are more different from each other than Cruising with Ruben and the Jets and Lumpy Gravy. The first a tribute to the doo-wop genre from the fifties, the second a bizarre collage.\n\nFreak out! - Fillmore West, 1966: into the rock industry\n\nHungry freaks, I ain't got no heart, Who are the brain police?, Go cry on somebody else's shoulder, Wowie Zowie, I'm not satisfied (1966), You're probably wondering why I'm here, Trouble every day (1966), Help, I'm a rock, It can't happen here, Monster magnet, Downtown talent scout\n\nAbsolutely free: complexities\n\nPlastic people, Duke of prunes (1967), Amnesia vivace, Invocation & ritual dance of the young pumpkin, Soft-sell conclusion, Uncle Bernie's farm, Son of Suzy Creamcheese, Brown shoes don't make it (1967), America drinks (and goes home), The big squeeze\n\nWe're only in it for the money: the sixties\n\nWho needs the Peace Corps?, Concentration moon, Bow tie daddy, Harry you're a beast, The ugliest part of your body, Absolutely free, Flower punk, Lonely little girl, Mother people, The chrome plated megaphone of destiny, No matter what you do\n\nLumpy gravy - Lumpy money: a collage\n\nOh no, It's from Kansas, I don't know if I can go through this again, Amen, King Kong (1968), Kangaroos, Envelops the bath tub, Foamy soaky, Unit 3A and 9, How did that get in here?\n\nCruising with Ruben and the Jets - Greasy love songs: doo-wop\n\nCheap thrills, How could I be such a fool, I'm not satisfied (1968), Jelly roll gum drop, Later that night, You didn't try to call me, \"No. No. No.\", Stuff up the cracks, Oh, in the sky, Chucha, If only I could be your love again\n\nUncle Meat - Weasels ripped my flesh (1968-1969)\n\nUncle Meat was the title of both an album and a movie. This movie only got completed as a video in 1986, with the music appearing on Ahead of their time. The modern harmonies of the Uncle Meat title track sound refreshing till today. Next Zappa recorded a fusion album under his own name. Hot rats features complex interwoven harmonies, obtained through overdubbing. In 1969 he was looking for new directions and disbanded the original Mothers Of Invention overnight. The band members were taken by surprise. The unreleased material Zappa had in stock appeared on Burnt weeny sandwich and Weasels ripped my flesh.\n\nUncle Meat: integration\n\nUncle meat (variations) (1969), Nine types of industrial pollution, Zolar Czakl, Dog breath (variations), Blood unit, The legend of the golden arches, Exercise #4 (1973), Electric Aunt Jemima, Prelude to King Kong, Ian Underwood whips it out, We can shoot you, The air, Project X, Cruising for burgers (1969), King Kong (1969)\n\nAhead of their time: a play\n\nPrologue (1968), Agency man, The rejected Mexican pope, Undaunted, the band plays on, Epilogue, Would you like a snack?

He asked them to become the front men of his new band. At first this new line-up of the Mothers of invention started where the previous band had stopped, with newly written material appearing on Chunga's revenge. Next they started working on specific subjects, building comedy acts around them. The groupie opera was released on Fillmore East, while Billy the mountain appeared on Just another band from L.A. A third sequence, the Sofa suite, only became completed with the 1992 release Playground psychotics. With Uncle Meat still unfinished, Zappa did manage to film 200 Motels, a movie about a band on the road. The soundtrack offers a bewildering variety of styles, featuring modern orchestral works as well as rock band pieces. The orchestral works were also planned to be performed in the shape of The suites, but the direction of the Albert Hall cancelled the concert when they noticed that they considered some of Zappa's lyrics obscene. Eventually The suites did appear on CD in 2015. The 1971 tour ended with disasters. In Montreux the concert hall took fire and in London Zappa got thrown off stage.\n\nChunga's revenge: mainstream pop\n\nTransylvania boogie, Road ladies, The Nancy and Mary music, Tell me you love me, Would you go all the way?, Chunga's revenge, The clap, Rudy wants to buy yez a drink, Sharleena\n\nFunky nothingness - The Mothers 1970 - Fillmore East, 1970: bootleg and archive recordings\n\nKhaki sack, Twinkle tits, Chunga basement, Basement jam, Love will make your mind go wild, Funky nothingness, Halos and arrows, Moldred, Dance of the just plain folks, Red tubular lighter, Giraffe-take 4, Brain police (1970), Solos from Call any vegetable and Holiday in Berlin\n\nFillmore East, June 1971 - Playground psychotics: comedy shows\n\nLittle house (1971), The mud shark, What kind of girl do you think we are?, Bwana dik, Latex solar beef, Junier Mintz boogie, Willie the pimp (1971), Do you like my new car?, Peaches en regalia (1971), Tears began to fall, Scumbag, Aaawk, Brixton still life, A typical soundcheck, Once upon a time, Sofa (1971), Divan\n\nJust another band from L.A. - Carnegie Hall - Finer moments: sequences and tempo changes\n\nBilly the Mountain, Number 7, Call any vegetable, Eddie are you kidding?, Magdalena, Penis dimension, Brain police (1971), The subcutaneous peril, You never know who your friends are\n\n200 Motels (1971 album) - 200 Motels, the suites: the overall piece of art\n\nOverture, Mystery roach, What's the name of your group?, Can I help you with this dummy?, Tuna sandwich bolero, Lonesome cowboy Burt, Touring can make you crazy, Would you like a snack?

He returned to the idea of recording a sequel to Hot rats. The recording sessions resulted in enough material for two albums, Waka/Jawaka and The grand wazoo. A small tour with this band got planned. The first part involved a big band, the second part - due to contractual obligations of some members - a smaller combo. Strangely enough Zappa himself released nothing from these live shows. This conspicuous gap was filled by The Zappa family trust (ZFT), governing his tape archive since 1993. Three CDs could be compiled from these concerts, Imaginary diseases, Wazoo and Little dots.\n\nWaka/Jawaka: the jazz combo\n\nBig swifty, Your mouth, It might just be a one shot deal, Frog song, Waka/Jawaka\n\nThe grand wazoo: the big band\n\nFor Calvin, The grand wazoo, Think it over, Another whole melodic section, Cletus awreetus-awrightus, Eat that question, Blessed relief\n\nWazoo - Imaginary diseases - Little dots: the jazz band live and blues\n\nGreggery Peccary (1972), The new brown clouds, Imaginary diseases, Variant I, Rollo, Been to Kansas City in A minor, D.C. boogie, Farther O'blivion, Little dots, Montana (1972)\n\nThe Roxy band (1973-1975)\n\nIn 1973 Zappa had formed a band that has become known as the Roxy band. First they recorded two commercially successful albums, Overnite sensation and Apostrophe ('), the latter briefly reaching #10 in the album charts. With Roxy and elsewhere this band showed that they could play complicated music live. One size fits all is a carefully balanced album, one of many examples of bringing together various styles on one release. In 1975 Zappa toured with Don van Vliet a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, his friend from high school days onwards. Their collaboration resulted in Bongo fury.\n\nOvernite sensation: riffs\n\nCamarillo Brillo, I'm the slime, The curse of the Zomboids, Dirty love, Fifty-fifty, Palladium jam, Dinah-Moe Humm, Montana (1973)\n\nApostrophe ('): collaborations\n\nDon't eat the yellow snow, Nanook rubs it, St. Alfonzo's pancake breakfast, Father O'blivion, Cosmic debris, Excentrifugal forz, Apostrophe ('), Uncle Remus, Stinkfoot (1974)\n\nRoxy and Elsewhere: meters and rhythms\n\nPenguin in bondage (1974), Pygmy twylyte (1973), Village of the sun, Echidna's arf (of you), Don't you ever wash that thing, Cheepnis, Son of Orange county, More trouble every day, The be-bop tango (1973-1992), The Sheik Yerbouti tango, Pojama prelude, All skate, Inca roads (1973), Dickie's such an asshole\n\nYCDTOSA II - A token of his extreme: versions differences and routines\n\nApproximate, Pygmy twylyte (1974), The idiot bastard son, Room service, Dummy up, Dupree's paradise (1974), The booger man\n\nOne size fits all: through-composed melodies and song structures\n\nInca roads (1975), Can't afford no shoes, Po-jama people, Florentine Pogen, Evelyn, San Ber'dino, Andy, Sofa (1975)\n\nBongo fury: working with Don van Vliet\n\nDebra kadabra, Carolina hard-core ecstasy, Poofter's froth Wyoming plans ahead, 200 years old, Cucamonga, Advance romance, Muffin man, The torture never stops (original version)\n\nZoot allures - Zappa in New York (1976-1978)\n\nWhen all members of the Roxy band had left, Zappa decided to stop using the name Mothers Of Invention, continuing under his own name only. Another new band participated on the rock-based Zoot allures album with Zappa himself appearing as a multi-instrumentalist. He now started touring with a smaller band of five or six members. Live material with this band has mostly been released by the ZFT. Zappa himself recorded Zappa in New York, with this band augmented to 12 persons for his December 1976 concerts only. This album includes The black page, his best known example of composing with irregular rhythmic groupings. The refusal of Warner Bros. to include Punky's whips was one of the reasons for a clash, only ending with a settlement in 1982. Next Zappa proceeded with a plan to release the material he had in stock as a quadruple album called LÃ¤ther, to be halted by Warner Bros. issuing these pieces themselves as four individual albums (Zappa in New York, Studio tan, Sleep dirt and Orchestral favorites).\n\nOrchestral favorites: classicism\n\nStrictly genteel (1975), Duke of prunes (1963-1975), Bogus pomp, Black napkins instructions, Evening at the Hermitage\n\nStudio tan: modulations\n\nGreggery Peccary (1975), Music for low budget orchestra, Lemme take you to the beach, RDZNL\n\nFZ:OZ - FZ plays FZ - Joe's series - Zappa '75 - Philly '76: the 5- and 6-piece band\n\nPhyniox, Reeny ra, Any downers?

The release became his best-selling album with Bobby Brown becoming a big hit in some European countries. The lyrics got in the way of this single becoming an international hit. Joe's garage deals with a hypothetical situation where a government is prohibiting music, with the main character Joe winding up being able to play music in his mind only. The album ends with the touching solo Watermelon in Easter hay. Tinsel town rebellion is a selection from recent live recordings. The growing importance of guitar solos in Zappa's output culminated with the box set Shut up 'n play yer guitar. You are what you is a one of Zappa's more accessible albums with for instance country, rock and even a gospel song.\n\nSheik Yerbouti - Hammersmith Odeon: disco references and solo building\n\nThe black page #2, I have been in you, Flakes, I'm so cute, What ever happened to all the fun in the world, Rubber shirt, Baby snakes, Dancin' fool, Jewish princess, Wild love (1979), Mo' and Yo' mama (London), Dong work for Yuda, Watermelon in easter hay (prequel), King Kong (1978)\n\nOne shot deal - Chicago '78 - Halloween: live compilations #1 and xenochrony\n\nHeidelberg, On the bus, Occam's razor, Twenty-one, Paroxysmal splendor, Yo' mama (Chicago '78), Ancient armaments, Stinkfoot (1978), Lobster girl\n\nJoe's garage: the emotional dimension\n\nCentral scrutinizer, Joe's garage, Catholic girls, Crew slut, Fembot in a wet T-shirt, Why does it hurt when I pee, Lucille, A token of my extreme, Stick it out, Sy Borg, Keep it greasy (1979), Outside now (1979), Packard goose (1979), Watermelon in easter hay (1979-1984), A little green rosetta, No more Mr. nice girl\n\nTinsel town rebellion: fashions\n\nFine girl, Easy meat, Panty rap, Now you see it-now you don't, Dance contest, The blue light, Tinsel town rebellion, Pick me, I'm clean, Bamboozled by love, Brown shoes don't make it (1981), Peaches III\n\nShut up 'n play yer guitar: modes\n\nFive-five-FIVE, Hog heaven, Shut up 'n play yer guitar (some more), While you were out, Treacherous cretins, Heavy duty Judy (1980), Soup 'n old clothes, Variations on the Santana progression, Gee, I like your pants, Canarsie, The deathless horsie, Pink napkins, Beat it with your fist, Return of the son, Pinocchio's furniture, Why Johnny can't read, Stucco homes, Canard du jour\n\nYou are what you is - The dub room special: rock 'n roll and other styles\n\nHarder than your husband, Doreen, Stevie's spanking, Tengo na minchia tanta, Goblin girl, Society pages, I'm a beautiful guy, Beauty knows no pain, Charlie's enormous mouth, Any downers?

At the same time he got commissioned by the Ensemble Intercontemporain to write a chamber music piece for them. These recording were released as The L.S.O. and The perfect stranger, the latter with Pierre Boulez conducting. Other performances of orchestra and chamber music scores followed. Among them Sinister footwear, in full regrettably only available as sheet music (apart from a bootleg recording). During these years Zappa's modern music works could also appear on his rock albums. Ship arriving too late to save a drowning witch unintendedly contained a small U.S. hit with Valley girl. On Them or us one of the Sinister footwear movements can be found. On The man from Utopia Zappa experimented with recitatives.\n\nShip arriving too late to save a drowning witch: the modern rock band\n\nValley girl, I come from nowhere, Drowning witch, Envelopes (1982), Teen-age prostitute, Lisa's life story\n\nThe man from Utopia: recitatives\n\nCocaine decisions, SEX, Tink walks amok, The radio is broken, We are not alone, The dangerous kitchen, Stick together, The jazz discharge party hats, Luigi & the wise guys, Moggio, The torture never stops (1980)\n\nThe London Symphony Orchestra: a modern composer\n\nSad Jane, Bob in Dacron, Mo 'n Herb's vacation, Envelopes (1983), Pedro's dowry, Strictly genteel (1983)\n\nThe perfect stranger: a modern composer (cntd.)\n\nThe perfect stranger, Naval aviation in art?, Jeff and Don, The girl in the magnesium dress, Outside now again, Love story, Dupree's paradise (1984), Jonestown\n\nThem or us - Sinister footwear: the modern rock band (cntd.) and instrumentation\n\nIn France, Ya Hozna, Truck driver divorce, Marque-Son's chicken, Planet of my dreams, Be in my video, Them or us, Frogs with dirty little lips, Sinister footwear I-III\n\nThe synclavier (1984-1986)\n\nIn 1982 Zappa bought a synclavier, a computer controlled synthesizer, that offered him the possibility to execute pieces, humanly impossible to play. Among the first recordings where this machine was used, was Thing-Fish. This work belongs to the literary side of Zappa with a peculiar plot about a government trying to spread out diseases deliberately. It has the shape of an opera. Does humor belong in music? is a compilation of live music as played during the 1984 tour. In 1985 a senate hearing was held about the possible introduction of warning labels when the lyrics of pop albums could be deemed dangerous or offensive. Zappa was one of the speakers against this idea and released FZ meets the Mothers of prevention as a reaction, doing many interviews as well. This last album also included some complex synclavier works. The next year Jazz from hell followed with the synclavier being present full-fledged. This album got rewarded with an Emmy.\n\nThing-Fish: an opera\n\nPrologue (1984), Mammy nuns, Harry and Rhonda, Galoot up-date, The evil prince, Mudd club, Harry-as-a-boy, Artificial Rhonda, The crab-grass baby, The white boy troubles, No not now, Briefcase boogie, Brown Moses, Wistful wit a fistful, Drop dead, Won ton on\n\nDoes humor belong in music?: the lyrics\n\nBaby take your teeth out, Let's move to Cleveland, Hot plate heaven, For Giuseppe Franco, Zoot allures (1984), Trouble every day (1984), Penguin in bondage (1984), He's so gay, Bobby Brown\n\nFZ meets the Mothers of prevention: politics\n\nI don't even care, One man - one vote, Little beige sambo, Aerobics in bondage, We're turning again, Alien orifice, Yo cats, What's new in Baltimore, Porn wars, H.R. 2911\n\nJazz from hell: the synclavier #1\n\nNight school, The Beltway bandits, G-spot tornado, Damp ankels, St. Etienne, Massagio Galore, The black page (1987)\n\nThe final tour and the tape vault (1987-1990)\n\nIn 1984 stopped being on the road every year and turned his attention to his huge tape archive with, among others, all the live recordings. He had the habit of permanently changing his compositions, so many alternative versions got available via the massive You can't do that on stage anymore set. It comprises six double CDs, covering his whole career and about all different bands and tours. Guitar is another guitar solo collection from the 1982 and 1984 tours. Still there would be much more releasable material in the vault, as some of the ZFT issues indicate. In 1987 Zappa initiated what turned out to be his final tour. It was done with a large band with a large repertoire. The last leg of the tour had to be cancelled because of conflicts within the band. The financial loss was compensated by releasing most of the set on Broadway, the hard way, The best band you never heard in your life and Make a jazz noise here. Trance-fusion is a third guitar solo CD, with the accent lying on the 1988 tour.\n\nGuitar: solo types and mingling of closely related scales\n\nSexual harassment intro, Which one is it?, Republicans, Do not pass go, Chalk pie, In-a-gadda-Stravinsky, That's not really reggae, Once again, without the net, Jim and Tammy's upper room, San Antonio, That ol' G-minor thing again, Hotel Atlanta incidentals, That's not really a shuffle, Sunrise redeemer, Orrin hatch on skis, But who was Fulcanelli?, For Duane, GOA, Winos do not march, Swans, what swans?, Too ugly for show business, Systems of edges, Do not try this at home, Things that look like meat, Canadian customs\n\nYou can't do that on stage anymore: live compilations #2\n\nBabette, Ride my face to Chicago, Carol, you fool, Chana in de Bushwop, Nig biz, King Kong (1971/82), Little rubber girl, Shall we take ourselves seriously, Don't you want a man like me?

He still lived for three years, being able to compose and yet again come up with new directions for his music. It did something to make up for his early death in 1993. After Jazz from hell Zappa continued working on the synclavier, eventually leading to Civilization phaze III and Dance me this. Both CDs show a mix of composed music and collage pieces, achieved by assembling samples. Wolf Harbor is a fascinating world of industrial sounds and percussion sections. Other synclavier music reached a public via indirect sources, as The Valdez score (radio broadcast) and Uncle Sam (as part of a ZFT release). The cooperation with the Ensemble Modern worked out very well. With The yellow shark, Zappa could release some early and recently written chamber music.\n\nOutrage at Valdez and others: documentaries\n\nOutrage at Valdez, The Valdez score, Improvisation in A, Budapest solo, Strat Vindaloo\n\nThe yellow shark - EIHN: counterpoint #2\n\n9/8 Objects, What will Rumi do?, T'Mershi Duween, This is a test, Uncle meat (1993), Times beach, Ruth is sleeping, None of the above, Pentagon afternoon, Food gathering in post-industrial America, Exercise #4 (1992)\n\nCivilization phaze III: the synclavier #2\n\nGet whitey, Put a motor in yourself, They made me eat it, Reagan at Bitburg, Navanax, Xmas values, N-lite, I was in a drum, A pig with wings, Hot & putrid, Gross man, Why not?, Beat the reaper, Samba funk, Uncle Sam, Amnerika\n\nDance me this: the synclavier #3\n\nDance me this, Pachuco gavotte, Wolf Harbor, Goat polo, Rykoniki, Piano, Calculus\n\nConclusion\n\nZappa has referred to his output as one big project, being held together by a conceptual continuity. This motto was more an attitude towards music than something you might call a development of a Zappa style: anything was allowed. Another slogan he liked to use was \"AAAFRNA\": anything, anytime, anywhere for no reason at all. This study contains over 600 note examples, showing a huge variety in every aspect: meters, rhythms, styles, instrumentation. About anything is coming by in such a creative manner that many consider Zappa a genius.\n\nConclusion (in full)"
