        "text": "Peaches en Regalia by Frank Zappa was recorded in 1970\n\nIt and was the opening track of his jaw droppingly brilliant LP (that’s what they were called then, Long Players, you could get change for £3 when you bought them) Hot Rats.\n\nI heard this album in the year it was released and as a 17 year old, I was stunned, I had never heard anything with such unusual instrumentation, time signatures and just interesting music!\n\nZappa pushed the boundaries constantly.\n\nHis comment on Rock journalists was typical “Rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, in order to provide articles for people who can't read”\n\nAm I alone in admiring Zappa? The answer is no, if John Lennon is to be believed in a memorable Rolling Stone interview said, “Well Zappa’s a genius but he’s a ****ing intellectual isn’t he?”\n\nAt around the time Zappa recorded Hot Rats he also recorded Weasels Ripped My Flesh. Chunga’s Revenge and Burnt Weeny Sandwich. It was a consistency he was never to achieve again.\n\nFrank Zappa was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on December 21, 1940\n\nZappa's father was of Greek-Arab descent, and his mother was of three-quarters Italian and one-quarter French. The family moved often during Zappa's childhood because his father, a chemist and mathematician, had various jobs in the US defence industry.\n\nZappa grew up influenced by avant-garde composers such as Varèse, Igor Stravinsky and Anton Webern, R&B and doo-wop groups, and modern jazz. His own ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural and mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of underground music and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards \"mainstream\" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like psychedelia, rock opera and disco.\n\nZappa left home aged 19, and moved into a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough none of his recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it. He appeared on The Steve Allen Show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of The Soots. Dot Records rejected them for having no \"commercial potential\"; a quote Zappa later used on the sleeve of Freak Out!\n\nTom Wilson signed The Mothers to the Verve Records division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which had built up a strong reputation in the music industry for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences.\n\nVerve insisted that the band officially change their name to \"The Mothers of Invention\" because \"Mother\", has certain connotations\n\nWith Wilson credited as producer, The Mothers of Invention and a studio orchestra recorded the groundbreaking double album Freak Out! It mixed R&B, doo-wop, and experimental sound collages that captured the \"freak\" subculture of Los Angeles at that time. The album immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the \"relentless consumer culture of America\". The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. Some of the session musicians were shocked that they should read from charts with Zappa conducting them, as this was not standard at a rock recording. The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had Dadaist elements.\n\nZappa moved into a house in Laurel Canyon and it became a meeting and living place for many LA musicians and groupies of the time, despite Zappa’s disapproval of their drug use. He labeled people on drugs \"assholes in action\", and he only tried marijuana a few times without any pleasure. He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns\n\n“We're Only in It for the Money” (released 1968). was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer.\n\nFrom then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. “We're Only in It for the Money” featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. The cover photo parodied that of The Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nAfter he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album Hot Rats.\n\nIt features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos. It was backed by jazz, blues and R&B session players including violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris, drummer John Guerin, multi-instrumentalist and previous member of Mothers of Invention Ian Underwood, and bassist Shuggie Otis, along with a guest appearance by Captain Beefheart (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, \"Willie the Pimp\"). It became a popular album in England, and had a major influence on the development of the jazz-rock fusion genre.\n\nWhile performing at Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino. The fire was seen from across the lake by the members of Deep Purple, who were inspired to write classic Rock track “Smoke on the Water”\n\nZappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe ('), which reached a career-high #10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single \"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow’ (‘cus that’s where the husky’s go)\n\nIn 1981, Zappa also released three instrumental albums.\n\nShut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, which was inspired by something an audience member shouted to Zappa during a concert. The albums focus exclusively on Frank Zappa as a guitar soloist, and the tracks are predominantly live recordings from 1979–1980; they highlight Zappa's improvisational skills with \"beautiful performances from the backing group as well\".\n\nMost of Zappa's projects came to a halt in 1990, when he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years, and was considered inoperable. After his diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and Synclavier works.\n\nFrank Zappa died on Saturday, December 4, 1993 in his home surrounded by his wife and children.\n\nAt a private ceremony the following day, Zappa was interred in an unmarked grave in Los Angeles. On Monday, December 6 his family publicly announced that \"Composer Frank Zappa left for his final tour just before 6:00 pm on Saturday\". I was fortunate in being able to put my name to a World Wide e-.mail to his wife Gail thanking Frank for the way in which his music had reached out to us in many different ways.\n\nIn 2005, the US National Recording Preservation Board included We're Only in It for the Money in the National Recording Registry\n\nTHEY NOTED\"Frank Zappa’s inventive and iconoclastic album presents a unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and America’s reactions to it\". The same year, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him 71 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time"
