        "text": "This chapter critically analyzes South African art criticism texts by White writers, highlighting racialized tropes in speaking about black artists and their creative production. These texts present black artists as lacking and mimetic, maintaining the naturalization of European colonial “fine arts” values and geo-specific histories. We posit that bodily epidermalized speech acts are operationalized as White property and cultural capital. By framing visual arts discourse in its bodily materiality, the chapter aims to point out the interconnectedness between theory, materiality, and practice when it comes to understanding and evaluating creative works. It also argues that the reproduction of Whiteness validates a naturalized (White) system of “looking at art” and the discoursing about and teaching of visual arts/art history.\n\nAbstract This paper outlines dominant views of South African English literature critics from the 19th century to the present. Against this backdrop, I examine some English texts written by blacks in order to demonstrate how attempts by some critics subjectively to strengthen some postmodern notions such as transnationalism have blurred the differences between black and white South African English fiction. I argue that in their essays black critics such as Daniel Kunene, Es’kia Mphahlele and Mbulelo Mzamane (all 1992), on the one hand, adopt a literary-historical approach to a consideration of South African literature written in English, pointing to a yet to be clearly articulated tradition of black South African English writing. On the other hand, white critics such as Ernest Pereira, Sally-Ann Murray, and Geoffrey Hutchings reveal how the South African fiction by white writers that they discuss basically shows how the writers of fiction endemically handle the South African milieu differently from the way their black counterparts do. This study seeks to show that such a differentiation is necessary, for present and future South African literary criticism to be balanced and enriched. I demonstrate that benefits of this kind of a rethinking of the humanities subsuming acknowledgement of heterogeneity in studies of South African English literature, include sustainable social cohesion.\n\nContemporary South African literature shows a renewed concern with the close bonds between land, place and people in the New South Africa. In the post-apartheid period, this is literature that reflects a close awareness of the need for an art that retains both a sense of creative integrity and the ethical and political demands of the narrative of the new, postapartheid nation. Often history is invoked not as the deterministic frame that regulates each character’s lives typical of so much of the country’s literature, but as the accumulated mesh of individual experiences encompassed by the historical narrative. More to the point, this is writing of great aesthetic energy and political relevance, strengthened by an urgent need to justify its own relevance and a desire to contribute to the healing of a nation that remains in many ways deeply wounded.\n\nThe trend in analyses of postapartheid South African literature is to see a body of writing that is largely “freed from the past” and which exhibits a wide range of divergences from “struggle” writing. This article provides a differently nuanced conceptualization and argues that some of the literature’s key dynamics are founded in “mashed-up temporalities.” My analysis borrows from Ashraf Jamal’s appropriation of art historian Hal Foster’s “future anterior” or a “will have been.” In my reading, emblematic strands of postapartheid writing are less “free from the past” than trading in an anxiety about never having begun. The body of literature in question—in this case, white post-transitional writing—is inescapably bound to the idea of the time of before, so much so that it compulsively iterates certain immemorial literary tropes such as those of the frontier and the journey of discovery. Further, I suggest that much postapartheid literature written in what I call “detection mode”—providing accounts of “crime” and other social ills—is distinguished by disjunctive continuity rather than linear or near-linear discontinuity with pre-transition literature, yet exhibits features of authorial voice and affect that place it within a distinctly postapartheid zone of author-reader interlocution.\n\nThis article revisits some of the controversies and debates that arose in 2012 surrounding works by South African artist Brett Murray, in particular his painting The Spear. Against the rather unanimous criticism of these works, it attempts a more nuanced and instructive assessment of these works’ political value, especially since some of the underlying issues remain largely unresolved and continue to haunt debates on political art in South Africa. A second aim of the article is to test the usefulness of some key concepts and arguments in contemporary work of French philosopher Jacques Rancière on aesthetics and politics for such an assessment. The article first applies Rancière’s theory of historical regimes of art to attempt a deep understanding of the fundamental assumptions and views concerning art that clashed in debates surrounding Murray’s works. It then considers two common, interconnected accusations of these works. One that considers their content to hold deeply counter-revolutionary views on political transformation, the other that they undermine genuine attempts at bridging the deep divisions of South African society. Finally, it examines Murray’s art in light of Rancière’s critique of what he calls the traditional critical art paradigm. Although the latter is held to add a valid and innovative register of critical analysis of the political status of art works, the article argues that if applied in monolithic fashion to Murray’s work, it also somehow misrecognizes the latter’s specific political mode and potential, a criticism that also holds for other criticisms considered in the article.\n\nABSTRACT The article approximates Derrida’s and Gates’s personal concerns about racial differences and state racisms. In Racism’s Last Word, Derrida (1986) investigates the meaning of the word Apartheid. Written nearly a decade before Mandela dismantles the state racist regime ruling the life of South Africans, Derrida’s text denounces that Apartheid “institutes, declares, writes, inscribes, prescribes. As a system of marks, it outlines spaces in order to assign forced residence or to close off borders. It does not discern, it discriminates.” The reflections exposed by Gates in the article Writing “Race” and the Difference it Makes explains how writing and freedom cooperate mutually, leading poet Phillis Wheatley to struggle to keep institutional racism at bay. The use of language in writing, Gates argues, “signifies the difference between cultures and their possession of power, spelling out the distance between subordinate and superordinate, between bondman and lord in terms of their “race.” In both Derrida’s and Gates’s thoughts, artistic use of language – painting, writing or both – becomes potential antidote against “relegating black people to walking abstractions, lustful creatures or invisible objects.” KEY WORDS: Racism, Apartheid, Panting, Writing, Race, Aesthetics, Logics."
