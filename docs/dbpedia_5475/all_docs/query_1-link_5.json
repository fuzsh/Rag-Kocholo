Lewis Nkosi was a South African writer who spent 30 years in exile due to restrictions placed on his writing by apartheid-era laws. He attempted every literary genre including novels, short stories, essays, poetry, drama, and journalism. His most well-known novel, Mating Birds, published in 1983, generated controversy for its story of a forbidden romance between a black man and white woman in South Africa. Nkosi faced censorship of his works in South Africa and was granted a one-way exit permit when he accepted a fellowship to study in the U.S. in 1961. He lived in exile, holding positions at universities abroad until returning to South Africa in 2001, where he spent his final years in financial difficulty",
