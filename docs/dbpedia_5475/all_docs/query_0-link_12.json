African Articulations showcases cutting-edge research into Africa’s cultural texts and practices, broadly understood to include written and oral literatures, visual arts, music, and public discourse and media of all kinds. Building on the idea of ‘articulation’ as a series of cultural connections, as a clearly voiced argument and as a dynamic social encounter, the series features monographs that open up innovative perspectives on the richness of African locations and networks. Refusing to concentrate solely on the internationally visible above the supposedly ephemeral local cultural spaces and networks, African Articulations provides indispensable resources for students and teachers of contemporary culture.

It is disguised by unused floor tiles and garden tools; on top are old copies of Huisgenoot, Zonk and Drum magazines, then Ludo and Snakes and Ladders game boards. ‘But as I got closer to the bottom of the box, my heart leapt with disbelief ’: Here was Down Second Avenue by Ezekiel Mphahlele and Road to Ghana by Alfred Hutchinson; and Blame Me on History by Bloke Modisane; and Naught for Your Comfort by Trevor Huddleston; and Tell Freedom by Peter Abrahams; [...] Chocolates for My Wife, by Todd Matshikiza; South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright by Mary Benson; The Ochre People by Noni Jabavu; Ghana: The Auto­biography of Kwame Nkrumah; Let My People Go by Albert Luthuli; Go Well Stay Well by Hannah Stanton, copies of Africa South magazine, and other lesser known books that I do not remember now. Banned books! (9)\n\nHere was, in other words, a secret archive of non-fiction from southern Africa and beyond, one that marked, he writes, ‘a turning point in my life’ (9). Ndebele describes the thrill of devouring the autobiographies of Bloke Modisane and Es’kia Mphahlele as two very different approaches to the same overriding social and political reality: ‘It struck me then that oppressed people were far more complex than the collective suffering that sought to reduce them to a single state of pain’ (10). This was the beginning of ‘a reading and writing journey that has not ended’, a process of seeking to understand his native land, and to represent it in prose with an immediacy and directness that he calls ‘the art of the fine line’: ‘Writing is the one art that compels the writer to explore and express complex feelings and thoughts through an attempt at simplicity and concreteness that are yet able to preserve the complexity’ (10). Life writing in South Africa often returns to this scene of encounter. If one unpacks that half-hidden crate, similar moments can be found nested (like Russian dolls) within the books Ndebele mentions. In Tell Freedom (1954), Peter Abrahams recalls discovering W. E. B. du Bois in Johannesburg’s Bantu Men’s Social Centre in 1937, along with Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes and other writers of the Harlem Renaissance: ‘I read every one of the books on the shelf marked: American Negro Literature’ (197). Mphahlele describes, in his more\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 7\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nsardonic way, ‘the small one-room tin shack the municipality had the sense of humour to call a “reading room” in the western edge of Marabastad’ (Es’kia 278): It was stacked with dilapidated books and journals junked by bored ladies from the suburbs – anything from cookery books through boys’ and girls’ adventures to dream interpretations and astrology. Mostly useless, needless to say. Still, I went through the whole lot indiscriminately, like a termite, just elated with a sense of discovery and of recognition of the printed word mostly connected with the mere skill of reading. (278)\n\nExamples can be multiplied: Mohandas Gandhi receiving John Ruskin’s Unto this Last in 1904 and being inspired to create his experiments in communal living near Durban and at Tolstoy Farm outside Johannesburg; Nadine Gordimer escaping from a mining town into nineteenth-century Russia via the library in Springs. In ‘Remembering Texas’, J. M. Coetzee describes coming across the colonial records of German South West Africa while pursuing doctoral research in Austin, a discovery that would eventually lead to a fictional debut, Dusklands, as a kind of hoax or parody non-fiction (Doubling the Point 52). Long Walk to Freedom is itself a discourse on reading: on Robben Island, Nelson Mandela immerses himself in the memoirs of Anglo-Boer War generals in order to understand the crucible of Afrikaner nationalism, and the historical process by which black South Africans had become the victims of the victims. Mine too is a series of books within books, of unexpected encounters with the archive. Henk van Woerden finds the 1966 governmental report into the death of Hendrik Verwoerd, and with it the remarkable life of his assassin Demetrios Tsafendas. As a boy, Jacob Dlamini comes across ‘The Strange Saga of Mr X1’, a notorious collaborator with apartheid’s death squads, and someone whose story unravels any simple binary of victim and perpetrator. At the Lenin Institute in Moscow, a young Thabo Mbeki reads Shakespeare’s Coriolanus as a blueprint for revolution. Panashe Chigumadzi reflects on the literary set-works, like Coetzee’s Disgrace, that showed up the fragile multi-racialism of her ‘born free’ schooldays in Limpopo. Sisonke Msimang and Lebogang Mashile work back through the canon of anti-apartheid non-fiction to explore the complexities of inter-racial friendship, and the awkward intimacies of domestic labour. In tracing encounters like these, I explore how unpredictable, uneasy or even ‘mostly useless’ literary inheritances are put to uses for which they were never intended. For in the colonial or apartheid context (and in a country where books are still taxed as luxury items) ‘the library’ has often been a scarce resource. Thinkers operating in such conditions needed to ‘squeeze blood from stones’: a phrase from Antonio Gramsci that Archie Dick quotes in excavating the reading practices of South African political prisoners\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 8\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\n(‘Censorship’ 8).1 His Hidden History of South Africa’s Book and Reading Cultures (2012) is a reminder of how the most important intellectual work in or about the country has often taken place outside formal institutions: in marginalised, covert or exile spaces. This kind of autodidactic, unaffiliated intellectual labour is a deep theme in my book. It seeks to understand how specific literary encounters and cultural texts are woven into the trajectory of individual lives; and how certain forms of reflective non-fiction (so powerfully in the case of Ndebele and Mphahlele) are able to rehearse the intimate and sometimes arbitrary ‘backstory’ of how one comes to know what one knows, and think what one thinks. These are written modes where the mediation of the personal voice is not effaced or denied but put to work, where the ‘I’ becomes a risky but vital intellectual tool. In a piece also collected in Fine Lines from the Box, ‘Thinking of Brenda’, Ndebele remarks that if his tribute has been a ‘personal, imaginative embrace’ of his subject (the musician and performer Brenda Fassie), then ‘I have also now made the personal, public’ (217). Having suggested elsewhere that the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a large-scale endeavour of making the private public – ‘a living example of people reinventing themselves through narrative’ (‘Memory’ 27) – he goes on: I think that only if we attempt this pouring out of personal feeling into the public domain will a new public become possible. We cannot tell what kind of public it will be; but we do need to release more and more personal data into our public home to bring about a more real human environment: more real because it is more honest, more trusting, and more expressive. (Fine Lines 217)\n\nReading, researching and writing about South African non-fiction has in many ways been an attempt to redress an ignorance about my own situation, an ignorance that my upbringing and formal education (during the final days of apartheid and the early years of the 1990s transition) did little to dispel, and often worked to inculcate. While some secondary schools made the historical events of the 1990s central to their curricula (even building questions posed by the TRC into their history lessons), at my partly liberal, partly conservative and certainly Anglophile boarding school, such events were only gradually, 1 With help from Hugh Lewin’s prison memoir Bandiet (1974), Dick records the attempts of warders in Pretoria Central to be archivists and librarians: ‘An even stranger arrangement later was chief warder Du Preez’s catalogue of purchased books. Over time the books could not be traced because most were filed under “T” since so many titles started with “The”. There was little improvement by the 1970s. The library catalogue, for example, listed The Tempest as science fiction, and Romeo and Juliet appeared as “author anonymous”’ (‘Censorship’ 8).\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 9\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nsomewhat grudgingly admitted. As I remember it, the proceedings of the Commission were mediated as something peripheral and barely mentioned. There was little sense that we were living through historic times. When I left for university abroad, I was surprised to find the immense interest that the global academic community was taking in the South African story, particularly in the question of transitional justice, post-apartheid culture and how creative work might contribute to reimagining the new nation’s pasts and futures. Having never read a great deal of my native country’s literature before, I now began (a typical reflex of the homesick) in earnest. To encounter Lewis Nkosi’s agile and fearless essays on Johannesburg, jazz and exile (so different from the institutionalised ‘Theory’ being fed to me as a student) or Coetzee’s unflinching 1997 account of Boyhood; to surrender to the confessional outpourings of Modisane’s Blame Me on History, Rian Malan’s My Traitor’s Heart and Antjie Krog’s Country of My Skull; to watch the intellectual nerve with which Jonny Steinberg set about some of the most difficult and dissonant subjects of ‘the new South Africa’ – farm murders, prison violence, HIV/AIDS denialism – such encounters forced me to begin reimagining my native land in ways that are far from over. In pursuing a PhD on post-apartheid returns to the colonial archive (novelistic, non-fictional, poetic, curatorial) I was confronted with the kind of theoretical and methodological quandaries that persist in this work. How can one conceive of history as a set of narrative and discursive practices, yet also try to discern some limit or ‘check’ to the literary imagination, beyond which past existences become too malleable or too easily usable for the designs and desires of the present? How can the matter of non-fiction narrative be conceived of as both wrought and received at the same time: that is, as an aesthetic, linguistic effect but also (simultaneously) as something verifiable beyond the text – outside, prior to or independent of any mediation? And how to respond to such works in a medium (academic prose) that is itself a kind of literary non-fiction? During these years, I worked as a researcher on the Cambridge History of South African Literature (ed. Attridge and Attwell, 2012), a multi-author collection intended as a comprehensive reference work and guide to the field. Since publication, it has struck me that the absence of a chapter devoted specifically to the question of literary or creative non-fiction is a notable gap in the survey. Quite what such a chapter might have looked like, or what linkages might have been drawn between the heterogeneous texts that would have populated it: these are difficult questions that it remains for me to think about in the chapters to come. But on first encounter, what they seem to share is a sense of narrative and intellectual pressure, a communicative passion or compulsion to make sense of a fractured country. In his account of post-apartheid writing, Leon de Kock frames South Africa’s non-fiction from the 1990s onwards as ‘an unadulterated brand of scrupulous\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 10\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nethical communication after decades of official prevarication and private denial’, yet also as a body of work which must reckon with the double imperative or ambiguity that ‘strikes a bass note’ in the literature of the transition: ‘a quest for establishing the truth of “what really happened” – and what continues to happen – in relation to a past that is itself subject to continual revision’ (Losing the Plot 10). The new literature, he goes on, ‘serves as a measure of an unreadable present and an unplottable future, appraised in relation to an eternally unsettled past’ (11). It is this double imperative that I, like many readers of critically aware non-fiction, find so compelling: its balancing of a fierce will-to-truth with an awareness of the endless human capacity for revision, self-delusion and error. The autobiographical narrative of ignorance and belatedness that I have outlined above underwrites this project. It has in one sense been an attempt to educate myself ‘after the fact’ of the transition, at a time when the terms of intellectual engagement are shifting fast in contemporary South Africa and entirely new questions are being posed. This book emerges into a post-transitional, postTRC moment in which much of the narrative non-fiction of the past decades has already begun to look like a historical phenomenon. As I explore in the final chapters on memoirs of the ‘born frees’, textured social history has given way to expressionism, radicalism and new forms of identity politics that are less ready to accept the freedom of writers to transgress divides of race, class and language. The scarcity of the hidden library is now difficult to imagine in a digital world where information is super-abundant, and where the matter of what it means to know something is undergoing changes that are profound and hard to articulate via existing literary or aesthetic categories. In teaching university seminars over several years, I have noticed that many students consistently use the word ‘novel’ to mean not just fiction but any long work of prose in the format of a printed codex. After several years, I gave up on trying to correct them, sensing that this might be less an error than the instantiation of new normal. Perhaps the division that matters most is increasingly not between fiction and non-fiction, but rather between the protocols of the book and those of the screen; or else between long-form and short-form text, with the different patterns of consumption and expectation that these involve. Nonetheless, I believe that the archive of critical non-fiction in South Africa is an extraordinarily rich one. As a new generation questions or rejects the conceptual architecture of the 1990s model of transition and reconciliation (and turns largely to the digital to do so), I work from the premise that returning to non-fictions from across the twentieth century reveals how deeply thinkers before us have grappled with questions of representation, complicity and the slippery nature of autobiography itself. For when, after all, do you know that you have arrived at the truth about yourself? What value can one give the outpouring of confessing narratives from South Africans, especially white South Africans, over the last decades (of which\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 11\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nmy paragraphs above form a small part)? How can genuine self-knowledge take shape in the context of political expediency, or within the high velocity of the online world? What constitutes a sincere confession in a secular context; and what about the strange pleasures of staged contrition, or loudly flagging the limits of one’s own ‘subject position’? If an autobiographical essay narrates its own coming to understanding, how stable or trustworthy can that endpoint ever be – at least from the vantage of a discipline that is trained to find silences and self-deceptions, slippages and omissions? To bring such questions right up to date: what valence can be given to the kinds of personal testimony that are increasingly informing radical student politics in the country, narratives of hurt and personal pain that demand to be taken as non-negotiable truth telling? Here then are the more sceptical counter-voices to Ndebele’s call for a release of personal data into the public realm, and to the unashamedly humanist language that he uses. From another perspective, we are in a sense the least reliable sources of information about ourselves. And this opens up the complex intellectual terrain in which fundamentally doubting or de-centred conceptions of the self in language (whether psychoanalytic, poststructuralist or performative) enter into dialogue with the strong and sincere truth claims, the ‘autobiographical pacts’, of non-fiction narrative (Lejeune 3). Reading this encounter becomes far more than just a theoretical issue; it broaches questions of whether working narrations of social relations are believable, whether they are just, whether the fictions that we live by are conducive to psychic health and open to change. Finally, this account of non-fiction in South Africa hopes to remember and prolong the moment of encounter: the moment of not (yet) knowing, of embarking on ‘a reading and writing journey that has not ended’ (Ndebele, Fine Lines 20). It wants to preserve a sense of onset, even naiveté in the presence of other existences and the ‘strange guests’ that arrive from the past.2 As such, I try to think and theorise from within the forms, surfaces and textures of the works in question, rather than subscribe too quickly to the knowingness of much academic prose. My case studies read for form, not because of any narrow formalism, but because it is here where one might see how innovative literary texts evolve their techniques for social thinking. * An enormous number of people have helped me with this project over the last six or more years, and I can’t hope to thank them all. I would however like to acknowledge the contribution of my graduate classes at the University of Cape 2 The phrase is from Nietzsche’s Untimely Meditations: ‘Historical knowledge streams in unceasingly from inexhaustible wells… The strange and incoherent forces its way forward, memory opens all its gates and yet is not open wide enough, nature struggles to receive, arrange and honour these strange guests (73).\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 12\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nTown, 2010 to the present, where many of these ideas and case studies were first broached. I owe much to Nick Mulgrew, whose thesis on ‘Authority in South African Non-fiction’ I supervised, and whose work on this topic has substantially shaped and often challenged my ideas in progress over several years. Alice Edy’s MA on concrete poetry and Willem Boshoff ’s ‘Verskanste Openbaring’ – a whole thesis about a single, illegible page of text – was a revelation, and one that helped me clarify ideas about conceptual writing and the paradox of anti-realist documentary. Rosa Lyster’s PhD on the apartheid censorship archive introduced me to a range of helpful material on what it means to think through the ‘paper regimes’ of authoritarian political cultures. My thanks also to Abdullah Dada, Lucy Gasser, Sa’eed Masoet, Siyabonga Njica and Alice Sholto-Douglas, who have played roles as research assistants during the course of the project. Several of the early chapters took shape in the writing workshops of the Archive and Public Culture research initiative, convened by Carolyn Hamilton at the University of Cape Town: a bracing inter-disciplinary space in which my thoughts on the literary uses and abuses of the past could be stress-tested among real historians. My thanks to all those participants and respondents. I would like to thank my teachers, David Attwell and Peter D. McDonald, for encouraging me to finish this monograph, and for being the true and always generous professionals that they are. Their thinking about the often impossible idea of ‘South African literature’, or what happens to the category ‘literature’ in a place such as this, has been invaluable over many years. Rita Barnard and Andrew van der Vlies played crucial roles as editors and interlocutors at different stages in this project, particularly in making an essay of mine the basis of a special issue of Safundi in 2012. Rob Nixon was a generous respondent at the time and has been ever since, over many discussions about the ‘infinitely varied, riddled, unsteady realities that non-fictional forms advance’ (‘Non-fiction’ 29). I am grateful also to the other editors who worked with me at journals where earlier versions of some chapters appeared: Research in African Literatures and Biography, where Anjoli Roy and John Zuern were required to field many emails from an aggrieved (but also, I think, secretly rather pleased) Ronald Suresh Roberts. I am very grateful to Robin Rhode for allowing me to use his work for the cover of this book. My thanks to Sean O’Toole for making available transcripts of his interviews with N. Chabani Manganyi. I have learned a great deal, and not always the easy way, from my colleagues and fellow academics, past and present: Peter Anderson, Derek Attridge, Elleke Boehmer, Barbara Boswell, Duncan Brown, Mbongiseni Buthelezi, Carrol Clarkson, Carli Coetzee, Victoria Collis-Buthelezi, Nadia Davids, Leon de Kock, Martha Evans, Sean Field, Gail Fincham, Anthea Garman, Harry Garuba, Colette Gordon, Lucy Valerie Graham, Lesley Green, Mandisa Haarhoff, Daniel Herwitz, Derrick Higginbotham, John Higgins, Kate Highman, Isabel Hofmeyr, Jeanne-Marie Jackson,\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 13\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nMegan Jones, Bodhi Kar, Billy Keniston, Charne Lavery, Julia Martin, Wamuwi Mbao, Isa Mkoka, Polo Moji, Christopher Ouma, Cóilín Parsons, Shihaam Peplouw, Natalie Pollard, Deborah Posel, Sam Raditlhalo, Graham Riach, Steven Robins, Daniel Roux, Meg Samuelson, Chris Saunders, Konstantin Sofianos, Kelwyn Sole, Simon van Schalkwyk, Chris Thurman, Hermann Wittenberg and ­Sandra Young.

My greatest debt is to Anna Hartford, who has helped me think more clearly, and truthfully, about difficult things, and whose presence is everywhere in the work to follow.

Saying non-fiction is like calling a whole wardrobe of clothes non-socks, or using the apartheid term ‘non-white’. It takes a minority identity as a reference point to categorise a majority, and so implies a hierarchy of values. Most pieces of writing in existence, from recipes to tax returns to Wikipedia pages, are broadly non-fictional: that is, their makers and readers assume the function of words referring to actually existing elements of the world in which such texts are embedded. And so, in order to narrow the focus of enquiry, an adjective is added: narrative non-fiction, creative non-fiction, literary non-fiction. Each of these multiplies the complications. Narrative non-fiction is non-specific; creative non-fiction sounds limited to the output of creative writing programmes. Literary non-fiction seems outdated and elitist, risking the discredited idea that literariness should be searched for as some privileged arena of discourse, or special added value. The object of enquiry in this book is one that I have found hard to bring into focus or keep still. But I hope that such unsettledness can be generative, and that it might speak to a difficult place at a difficult time. The place is South Africa, the time two decades and counting since the country’s first democratic elections in 1994. During this period of social and political transition, some of the most ambitious and compelling writing published within and about the country has emerged in non-fictive modes. The work of writers like Panashe Chigumadzi, Jacob Dlamini, Mark Gevisser, Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, Antjie Krog, Sisonke Msimang, Njabulo Ndebele, Jonny Steinberg, Ivan Vladislavić and many others forms a body of cultural production that is ambitious, textured, imaginative and self-aware; that is sometimes experimental, often risky and troubling, often divisive – and worthy of more critical attention than it has received. The work to follow is offered as the first book-length treatment of nonfictional form in modern South African literature. It reads a sequence of challenging documentary texts not simply as carriers of pre-existing information, but as ambitious and creative treatments of actuality. It considers a fuzzy set of narrative modes that are involved in orders of aesthetic selection and decision comparable to those that produce novels, short fiction, poetry and drama\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 1\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\n(genres that have traditionally been paid more attention by the discipline of literary studies). Building on the work of many other scholars, my case studies pay attention to prose surface, style and voice; to genre, metaphor and rhetorical tactics. They trace the strange and ethically complex process by which actual people, places and events are patterned and plotted in long-form prose narrative. For some readers and critics, a kind of ambitious and formally restless non-fiction has ‘become in a sense “the genre” of South African writing’ over the last decades, encompassing all those texts that make their meanings ‘at the unstable fault line of the literary and the journalistic, the imaginative and the reportorial’ (Brown and Krog 57). So what lies behind this perceived nonfiction boom? What cultural or psychic function is it serving? How can it be theorised and historicised? Non-fiction is often discussed in terms of relevance and topicality: its ability to render the contemporary moment, the ‘now’. Its relatively high sales in South Africa (and globally) are linked to its perceived role of taking sociopolitical readings of a world in flux: dust jacket copy promises state-of-thenation reports more credible than those of politicians or the media; but my account attempts a longer historical perspective. The recent wave of ‘experiments with truth’ (to adapt the title of Mohandas K. Gandhi’s 1927 autobiography) is read in mind of precursors across the twentieth century. Landmark works of black life writing and political memoir; the essays, reportage and New Journalism avant la lettre of the 1950s Drum writers; the extensive subgenre of South African prison writing; the techniques of social and oral history ‘from below’ that migrate from academic to more public registers – all of these emerge as possible forerunners of more recent works. I explore how the demands of witness and testimony have shaped writing in this part of the world for generations, but also trace how the most compelling non-fictions might come to exceed and outlast their immediate topicality and relevance. Why, in other words, does some news stays news? And what insights might Struggle memoirs and anti-apartheid texts release when revisited ‘now happily relieved of any need for solidarity’?1 In reading across the twentieth century for the most influential works of narrative non-fiction from a part of the continent known blandly as ‘South Africa’, three books surely stand out: Solomon T. Plaatje’s account of the consequences of the 1913 Natives Land Act, Native Life in South Africa (1916); the articles and addresses by Steve Biko collected in I Write What I Like (1978); and then Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom (1994), originary text of the new nation and our most exemplary life. Beyond this, 1 The phrase is from Lewis Nkosi’s 1990 essay marking the reissue of Bloke Modisane’s 1963 autobiography, Blame Me On History (online).\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 2\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n3\n\nthere are the various literary responses to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission – Antjie Krog’s Country of My Skull (1998), for example, and Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela’s A Human Being Died That Night (2003) – and then the TRC archive itself: that vast release of narrative into the public domain. The triumvirate of Plaatje, Biko and Mandela can be taken as metonymic of three deep currents of non-fiction that recur in many of the more recent works considered here. Plaatje’s work is a complex mosaic of different styles and genres, but it is anchored in the practice of narrative journalism, reportage and testimony, particularly as these pertain to violations of human rights and human dignity. Biko, in drawing on the passionate anti-colonial forms (and psychological registers) of Frantz Fanon, refines the critical and political essay into a form of great concision, frankness and rhetorical power. Mandela attaches his famous name to a collective exercise in life writing that is also explicitly a national allegory: a utopian writing-into-being of a new, democratic South Africa, and one in which every aspect of his subjectivity is made to do political work. This is a ‘life’, in other words, which is both an actual, individual existence in time and also its writing up for global consumption as a textual product and commodity. The chapters to follow track how these three non-fictive impulses are drawn on, woven together and reimagined in more recent South African writing: 1) literary journalism, testimonial narrative and reportage; 2) the critical essay as a form of narrative thinking able to braid together personal and political histories; 3) life writing in its many forms and registers, from ‘definitive’ biographies of public figures to more private modes like memoir, diaries, personal narrative and autobiographical confession. Yet even as it names various tropes or genres within the field of non-fiction, my approach is ultimately more interested in those works that seem to be in flight from, or writing their way out of, recognisable templates and preestablished narrative modes. In Krog’s acclaimed but contentious account of covering the TRC as a radio journalist, the three non-fictive codes above are scrambled together, and all sorts of liberties taken in search of a greater emotional and explanatory force on the page: ‘I cut and paste the upper layer, in order to get the second layer told’ (Country of My Skull 170–71). The result is a hybrid work that is deeply suspicious of universalised truth, and always alert to the gendered assumptions that form around notions of ‘objective’ versus ‘personal’ forms of writing: ‘Your voice tightens up when you approach the word “truth”’, the technical assistant says, irritated. ‘Repeat it twenty times so that you become familiar with it. Truth is mos jou job!’ [‘Truth is your job, after all!’] I hesitate at the word, I am not used to using it. Even when I type it, it ends up as either turth or trth. I have never bedded that word in a poem. I prefer the\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 3\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nword ‘lie’. The moment the lie raises its head, I smell blood. Because it is there… where the truth is closest. (36)\n\nIn Gobodo-Madikizela’s account of coming to know the imprisoned Eugene de Kock (once the commander of apartheid’s most notorious death squads), questions of expedient truths and revealing lies are still more charged. Published three years into the twenty-first century, A Human Being Died That Night is perhaps the first work of non-fiction in which a South African woman of colour writes extensively, and psychobiographically, about a white man (see Coullie et al., Selves in Question 19). It is a startling reminder that questions of narrative non-fiction can never be divorced from those of narrative power: who has the ability to write about whom; which stories are told across history; what comes to be heard or forgotten, and why. Hungry for sincerity and emotional honesty but suspicious of overbearing truths: both these globally travelled TRC books turn on ‘one of the striking ironies of the late twentieth century’: that a widespread ‘philosophical angst about the pursuit of truth has been accompanied by a new-found political confidence in exactly this project’, and a growing global enthusiasm for truth commissions (Posel and Simpson 1). Under its ‘Concepts and Principles’, South Africa’s TRC posited four different modalities of truth-telling: factual and forensic truth; personal and narrative truth; social or ‘dialogue’ truth; healing and restorative truth.2 In the work of the Commission from 1996 to 1998, these were generally conceived of as additive, aggregative, complementary and goaldirected; individual testimonies were shepherded by Chairperson Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s Christian ethos in the direction of an end point, generally forgiveness, reconciliation or amnesty. But it was largely beyond the scope of the TRC to engage the question of when such differently conceived techniques or genealogies of truth might modify, contradict, unsettle or work against each other; when they might point towards the unknowable, the unreconciled, the unforgiven. It is these psychic and political registers that the ambitious non-fictions I read here enter into. If the first decade of post-apartheid South African literary production saw a range of works that responded with journalistic and impressionistic immediacy to the Truth Commission, the second decade of democracy has been marked by a wave of what might be called post-TRC texts: more distant and recessed forms of accounting for the unfinished business of the transition. My book is addressed largely to this moment, and these works. It is drawn to self-reflexive, sometimes speculative, sometimes uneven texts: powered by a will-to-truth but simultaneously aware of the expedient, limiting or even illusory nature of truths arrived at too soon, or too easily. My case studies 2 See Vol. 1, Chapter 5 of the TRC Report: ‘Concepts and Principles’: ‘Truth’, 110–114.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 4\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n5\n\ninvestigate the inner workings of non-fictions that are (to match one negative definition with another) perhaps better thought of not as documents which seek to proclaim inalienable truths, but as attempts to reduce the number of lies – falsehoods, obscuring myths, received ideas, comforting social fictions – in the public domain. Uncertain, uneven, unpunctual, over-determined, excessive – these are some of the words I have found myself reaching for in responding to works that do not correspond to the simple narrative templates and timeframes of much public discourse. On the one hand, I attempt to understand the ‘surge of narrative energy’ surrounding non-fictional modes in a particular time and place (McGregor and Nuttall, At Risk 10). On the other, I hope to avoid an insular approach, as well as the narrative of exceptionalism in which many texts about South Africa’s political ‘miracle’ find themselves implicated. The post-transitional decades might be said to represent ‘a long walk to ordinariness’ (Cornwell, Klopper and Mackenzie, South African Literature), a shift from South Africa as a proxy for global hopes to just another ‘unredemptive, unengaging elsewhere’ (Nixon, ‘Non-fiction’ 32). And so the local materials are read in mind of a wider, global turn toward a bewildering array of non-fictional forms and formats: the many writers who work in the blurred territories between the fictive and the documentary, as well as a resurgent interest in the essay as a twentyfirst-century genre. In this sense, the non-fiction boom of the South African transition takes its place among a variety of global documentary traditions that refract moments of historical rupture or social reckoning.3 Any account of prose non-fiction today must also consider a broader turn towards what Rob Nixon calls the ‘cultural industrialisation of the real’ (‘Nonfiction’ 30). The last decades have seen an immense shift from analogue to digital worlds, from books to screens, and the emergence, across verbal, aural and visual platforms, of ‘a new normal that places a great creative and commercial premium on making a show of reality’ (30). In the overture to Reality Hunger (2010), a set of memos for the new millennium, David Shields attempts to sketch in a particular twenty-first-century cultural moment, or texture of 3 For some comparative perspectives, see for example: Bak and Reynolds, Literary Journalism and Calvi, ‘Latin America’s Own “New Journalism”’. The ‘factography’ of Soviet journalism which follows the Russian Revolution; grand reportage in war-torn western Europe and baogao wenxue in a modernising China; the New Journalism of 1960s counter-culture in the United States; literatura faktu in eastern Europe emerging from Communist rule; the long-standing genres of testimonio, crónicas and nuevo periodismo in Latin America and their engagements with the authoritarian state and endemic political violence; the Rwanda: écrire par devoir de mémoire project (writing as a duty to memory) in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide – such varied traditions suggest that it has often been in the domain of innovative non-fiction where moments of profound socio-political change find literary expression.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 5\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nexperience, as seen from Euro-America: an unconnected but interrelated set of cultural forms and artists who are ‘breaking larger and larger chunks of “reality” into their work’ (3). His list of examples ranges from literary to pop culture and across all kinds of media: DVDs of feature films that inevitably come with a ‘making of ’ documentary; behind-the-scenes interviews running parallel to the ‘real’ action on reality television shows; the remixing and recombination of all kinds of cultural data permitted by the digital environment (4).4 This massive increase in narrative possibility – in technologies for the scripting, screening and staging of real life – is perhaps one of the greatest shifts in communication and consciousness within human history. Its full consequences for ideas of truth and the self are still unfolding, and perhaps only dimly understood at this point. Yet in completing this book at a time when phrases like ‘post-truth’, ‘fake news’ and ‘alternative facts’ have become commonplace in public discussion, it seems there is a need for more powerful and creative tools to distinguish between the different orders of information folded into narrative non-fiction. The stubborn binary embedded within this negative definition remains – such is the case-by-case complexity of apprehending texts, and the sheer volume of stories that must be processed in a digital world – both inadequate and inevitable. * ‘Awakening on Friday morning, June 20, 1913, the South African native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth’. The first sentence of Sol Plaatje’s Native Life in South Africa (1916) is perhaps the most famous and often-quoted opening line in this country’s literature. Mothobi Mutloatse, Njabulo Ndebele, Kader Asmal – all begin their reflections on Plaatje’s account of the consequences of the 1913 Natives Land Act by reproducing it. In retrospect, it serves as preliminary not only to the book but also to the South African century. Reaching for a loan word, ‘pariah’, from the other major theatre of English-speaking colonialism in the global South, Plaatje evokes the fundamental denial of reality that underlay the creation of a new country in 1910: a reconciliation of Boer and Briton following the South African War, but one premised on the disavowal – social, political, cultural – of the lives of most inhabitants of the geographical space south of the Limpopo and Orange rivers. For Asmal, writing a Foreword to the 2007 Picador edition, it is ‘one of the most powerful and memorable first paragraphs in literature’ (xi). Except that it is not, strictly speaking, the first paragraph. Before chapter one comes a prologue, which opens as follows: 4 The ‘non-socks’ in my opening lines is lifted from Shields, who no doubt lifted it from somebody else in turn, given the argument his book makes against outdated intellectual property regimes and for the anarchic recirculation of cultural forms.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 6\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n7\n\nWe have often read books, written by well-known scholars, who disavow, on behalf of their works, any claim to literary perfection. How much more necessary, then, that a South African native workingman, who has never received any secondary training, should in attempting authorship disclaim on behalf of his work, any title to literary merit. Mine is but a sincere narrative of a melancholy situation, in which, with all its shortcomings, I have endeavoured to describe the difficulties of the South African natives under a very strange law, so as most readily to be understood by the sympathetic reader. (15)\n\nWith this very different kind of opening – self-conscious, rhetorical and recursive where the famous first lines are curt, confident and declarative – one senses the kind of torsions that Plaatje had to negotiate in presenting his passionate work of testimony and reportage to a distant public. In its stacked and carefully modulated clauses, the prologue enters the game by which a claim to literary merit is made in the very act of its being disavowed: a longstanding rhetorical device, the apologia, but one now inflected and contaminated by the colonial predicament. Who, after all, is the ‘we’ of the very first word? Embedded in this wishful, unrealised pronoun is a vortex of tensions concerning authority, audience and representation: tensions that will shape so much documentary writing from this part of the world, and will persist into another ‘new’ South Africa at the far end of the twentieth century. If the prologue starts, writes Bhekizizwe Peterson, by echoing colonial ideology and ‘reconfirming the absence of “the aesthetic” amongst Africans at the very moments when his texts demonstrated the contrary’ (81), then Plaatje’s humility and deference should be seen in part as a tactical move. Its sincerity is simultaneously a stratagem to petition the British public – a public that was, in the event, increasingly preoccupied by the First World War, and increasingly unconcerned with the lives of its imperial subjects who were not white. Intellectual, multi-linguist and interpreter for the British at the siege of Mafeking; novelist, diarist and translator of Shakespeare into Setswana; Secretary of the South African Native National Congress and member of its 1914 deputation to London: Plaatje was, when he began writing Native Life on board a ship travelling north, a member of a black elite ‘educated by and committed to the values of a white world that ultimately scorned them’ (Peterson 81). The knowledge and scope of this betrayal across the twentieth century – the global failure of a supposedly liberal humanism that prompted such sincerely ‘literary’ appeals but was ultimately deaf to them; an English articulacy corrupted and demeaned by subsequent history – such knowledge makes the prologue in some ways a beginning just as painful as the more famous opening lines. There is another, methodological lesson that can be drawn here. In considering Plaatje’s attempt to negotiate the thresholds of interpreting ‘native life’ to a distant audience – with its dynamics of insider and outsider, its fractured\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 7\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nsense of audience, its ‘subtle elaborations of African inscriptions into modernities’ (82) – Peterson pays attention to the matter of the textual threshold itself. Prologues, forewords and afterwords; endnotes, authors’ notes, notes to subsequent editions; dedications, glossaries, acknowledgements: these disparate kinds of writing, in lying beyond the boundaries of the main text in a printed book, can often be overlooked as supplementary or secondary. Yet, particularly within ambitious non-fiction narrative, a great deal of intellectual labour can be read out of these paratexts. An authorial prologue and petition like Plaatje’s is then ‘a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and strategy’ (Genette 2). And as we will see, some of the most compelling reflections on narrative non-fiction in South Africa can be found within these textual thresholds: a kind of in-built, selftheorising archive of documentary practice. As the complex rhetorical stance of Native Life in South Africa suggests, the matter of non-fiction turns continually on questions of representation, in all the literary and political senses of that word: on access to narrative, authorship, discursive authority and how these relate to histories of dispossession, inequality, racist segregation and resistance across the twentieth century. In traversing this difficult terrain I have three guiding arguments, or methodological axioms, drawn from the intellectual formations that underlie my approach, respectively: literary and cultural studies; questions of historiography and the archive; critical and postcolonial theory. For the rest of this chapter I explore more carefully how the question of non-fiction takes shape from each of these different disciplinary vantages. * First, and from the perspective of literary studies, I pay attention to form and argue for a method of cross-reading which ranges across the fiction/non-fiction boundary, placing works from different genres and even different mediums in dialogue. Literary history too often reads like with like – novels alongside novels, memoir against memoir, poems with poems – rather than setting different kinds of writing in counterpoint, and moving across classifications that are often little more than a publisher’s shorthand. The challenge, however, is to do this without dissolving or disavowing the specific truth claims of various modes – each with different techniques for smuggling world onto page; each working out different contracts about accuracy and candour with an implied reader. How, in other words, can one recognise that the experience of reading fiction and non-fiction are different, but also acknowledge the fictive lineaments within even the most truth-directed forms? Writing in the wake of the critical and postmodern theory that shows up the tacit fictiveness and narrativity inherent in all kinds of discourse, there is of course the temptation to dissolve and blur the fiction/non-fiction divide in\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 8\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n9\n\nall kinds of ways, or even to regard it as hopelessly obsolete. And certainly, a starting premise here is that any approach seeking to account for the full scope of literary production in southern Africa must in some ways move beyond this leaden binary. Yet on the other hand, any approach that entirely dispenses with the different kind of truth-claim (or factual status) assumed by (or attached to), for example, a novel and a work of social history, will remain somehow unsatisfying. Despite their resemblance in structure or technique, ‘literary non-fiction and fiction are fundamentally different’ writes Eric Heyne, and ‘this difference must be recognised by any theory that hopes to do justice to powerful non-fiction narratives’ (480).5 This may seem too absolute a binary for theoretically minded literary scholars. Yet in my experience of teaching graduate classes on, say, Ivan Vladislavić’s Portrait with Keys (a memoir of living and writing in Johannesburg, classed as NON-FICTION on the back cover of the international edition), even those students most ready to dissolve any distinction between fictional and nonfictional status into a postmodern play of signification are likely to find themselves mildly aggrieved on learning, after the fact, that Ivan Vladislavić does not really have a brother, that the cranky brother-character Branko in Portrait – often a mouthpiece for reactionary or crypto-racist sentiments in the work, and a foil to the more liberal, well-meaning narrator – is a fiction. It is a small but telling example of something that Daniel Lehman draws attention to in Matters of Fact: that those texts which blur genres and play in the borderlands between fiction and non-fiction do not so much deconstruct these categories as bring sharply into focus what is at stake in them: ‘The confession that, finally, it is impossible to delineate an exact boundary between fiction and non-fiction does not mean that the boundary does not matter’ (5). I would echo Lehman in saying that I don’t wish to reconstruct an absolute division in my bookshelf between fiction and non-fiction, but I do want to look at the range of narratives on that shelf – from Peter Abrahams to Virginia Woolf – ‘and describe how my very desire and difficulty in building such a division affects me as a reader’ (6). As a transaction between reader, writer and subject that can have material consequences for actual people, the non-fictional text is, Lehman goes on, implicated in a world beyond the written artefact. It is a term that carries the 5 Factual status, he writes in the course of making a useful basic distinction, is a category marker that has much to do with how the narrative is presented and received as its actual verbal content; factual adequacy is a value-judgment considering whether the work in question represents good or bad fact: ‘Status is either/or, a binary matter determined by contexts of reception and “the illocutionary intentions of the author”, whereas adequacy is a relative matter open to debate between readers’ (480–81). In other words, the question of engaging a text as non-fiction is always a process that involves both ‘external’ (top-down) categorisation and ‘internal’ (reader-directed) judgement.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 9\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nsense of being ‘deeply involved, complicit, even incriminated in both history and text’, and one that ‘complicates more traditional or tidy literary notions of “ideal” or “implied” authors and readers’ (4). The full power and problems of such documentary forms, he goes on, ‘cannot be understood until the discursive relationships among author, subject and reader that undergird nonfiction are read as closely as the words and images that make up the narrative itself ’ (2). It is an insight that comes into relief in my central chapters, which read a range of ambitious and contentious post-apartheid life writing – Mark Gevisser’s Thabo Mbeki: The Dream Deferred (2007), Ronald Suresh Roberts’s biography of Nadine Gordimer, No Cold Kitchen (2005), Jonny Steinberg’s Midlands (2002), The Number (2004) and Three-Letter Plague (2008) – in terms of racially inflected misprision and lopsided author/subject relations. Particularly in the case of Steinberg, whose books make their meanings within unreconciled gulfs of race and class while also probing criminal underworlds, the question of being implicated by narrative non-fiction takes on a very literal charge. If a tendency to entirely dissolve or disavow the non-fiction binary is one problem that I have repeatedly come up against, then the other side of the coin is the problem of rivalry. In Western literary theory from Aristotle onwards, one often sees the construction of a competitive, antagonistic relation in which the creative imagination – ‘fiction’, ‘the novel’ – is set against a more truthdirected adversary, whether ‘history’, ‘the New Journalism’, or the texture of the real itself. ‘The novelist lies helpless before what he knows he will read in tomorrow’s newspaper’, wrote Philip Roth in 1961: ‘The actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture tosses up figures daily that are the envy of any novelist’ (224). Variations on this theme – that unmediated or merely notated truth is stranger, and stronger, than fiction – permeate South African cultural criticism, stretching from Rian Malan’s bestseller My Traitor’s Heart (1990) back via the essays of T. T. Moyana to the Drum journalism of 1950s Johannesburg.6 Exploring apartheid as ‘A Daily Exercise in the Absurd’, Lewis Nkosi remarked: ‘At best an account of what a black man goes through in his daily life sounds like an exaggerated Kafka novel’ (Home and Exile 35). But, as he went on to argue in a well-known polemic, few novelists had properly risen to this challenge. 6 See Cowling, ‘Echoes of an African Drum’, for an exploration of how Drum journalists like Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Henry Nxumalo and Can Themba employ and anticipate the literary and often improvisational strategies that Tom Wolfe would later see as characterising the New Journalism: scene-by-scene construction; natural dialogue; third-person point-of-view; the use of ‘status-life details’, as well as a writerly voice that was ‘often lively, inventive, and colloquial, a marked departure from the reporterly style of serious journalism’ (21).\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 10\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n11\n\nInstead, he found only ‘the journalistic fact parading outrageously as imaginative literature’ (Home and Exile 126): a succession of ‘ready-made plots’ and untransformed ‘social facts’ that make it ‘difficult to see why we should give up the daily newspaper in favour of creative fiction, for the newspapers would tell us just as much about life’ (127). In a later decade, Njabulo Ndebele set about refining and complicating this cliché of rivalry between the creative and the documentary, suggesting that Nkosi ‘did not go far enough in his analysis of the problem’ (Rediscovery 16). Writing in Staffrider magazine in 1984, he theorised a tension that is not locked into the question of fiction versus non-fiction, but instead plays across all kinds of narrative modes: the relation between ‘the journalistic, informational ambience on the one hand, and the storytelling, narrative ambience on the other’ (Rediscovery 24, his emphasis). It is this space of dynamic tension that ambitious and aesthetically crafted non-fictions must navigate – the ‘conflict between the aim of storytelling and that of imparting social information’ (16) – while also embedding their own intra-textual reflections on what Ndebele calls ‘the phenomenon of information’ itself (16). Writing in mind of the 1970s Information Scandal (in which the apartheid government secretly founded, funded and bribed media outlets in an effort to change South Africa’s global image), he points to the nature of information in a capitalist society not as raw material but as an ideological commodity and manufactured product, its nature hinging ‘on such issues as who produces the information, who interprets it, and who disseminates it’ (16). In articulating what one might frame as a tension between knowledge and information, Ndebele’s diagnosis of apartheid as a deliberate and cynical exercise in denying reality still resonates in the twenty-first century. The Trump/Putin era has seen the apogee of a project in which media conglomerates, even in the ‘free world’, blatantly arrange and disseminate information in ways that correspond to predetermined ideological positions, positions that may well be ludicrous or cynical, but which serve the market and an elite with vested interests nonetheless. In a world of politically engineered social media feeds and well-funded digital misinformation, the result is a widespread sense of a damaged or debased real, and a cultural predicament that the traditional tools of critical and postmodern theory seem ill-equipped to address. Another often-cited example of a supposed rivalry between imaginative and documentary modes in South African literature is J. M. Coetzee’s 1987 address ‘The Novel Today’. Speaking at the height of the anti-apartheid struggle, the author and academic argued strongly against his chosen form being seen as a lesser form of discourse to be checked against the ‘answer script’ of history as if by a censorious schoolmistress: the novel as mere ‘supplement’ or handmaiden to the master discourse of historical materialism (2). Yet the problem with invoking ‘The Novel Today’ is that it tends to reinforce precisely\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 11\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe binary that is seen as so limiting at the outset. As Rita Barnard comments, it has often been taken up as ‘a kind of holy writ, a parable about the supremacy of fiction and storytelling’ (‘Beyond Rivalry’ 1). Because its metaphors are so extreme (the novelist feeling ‘colonised’ by the master narrative of Marxian and liberationist historiography) we are left with an after-image of this antagonistic opposition – ‘the novel’ versus ‘history’ – that overshadows the wider import of the address. That is: when History has been demythologised and revealed as a text among other texts, there exists a whole spectrum of different narratives and writings competing for legitimacy and primacy, making their different claims on the real. With all this in mind, my account begins from the premise that any simple notion of rivalry (or indivisibility) between fictive and non-fictive writing is inadequate. It cannot account for the flowering of both the novelistic nonfiction, and the historically textured novel-writing, that has characterised South African writing since the 1990s. Strains of fiction and non-fiction here have for a long time been in an unusually intense, intimate and constitutive dialogue with each other, and any attempt to engage South African writing in its fullest sense needs to find ways of addressing this complex and crossstitched relationship. ‘Is it fair to weave fictions out of the lives of real people?’ asks Vladislavić in The Loss Library: ‘How else are fictions to be made? All fiction is the factual refracted’ (30). As such, my challenge here is to read an array of different modes in critical counterpoint – literary journalism, fiction, life writing, drama, social history, poetry, documentary film, political biography, narrative essays, online posts, even conceptual art installations – with a sensitivity to how specific narrative techniques and rhetorical tactics are drawn on, refashioned and blurred into each other in the event of writing and reading. This method of cross-reading attempts to play across different genres and modes of address rather than remaining trapped within those protocols of symbolic exchange that thrive on an endless series of tired oppositions: fact and fiction; the novel versus history; the aesthetic versus raw experience; committed versus formalist; liberal versus radical. In the event of writing, it is perhaps more helpful to exchange such over-worked dichotomies for a space of dynamic tension between the found and the imagined, the informational and the narrative, the received and the wrought.7 And to concede that all the 7 The phrases ‘the received’ and ‘the wrought’ are from Janet Malcolm, who is (as we will see in chapter six) a major influence on the work of Jonny Steinberg. She uses them when discussing Virginia Woolf ’s life writing (Woolf ’s coinage), suggesting how the ‘hyper-reality’ of certain scenes ‘derives from a common artistic tradition and from certain technologies of storytelling, by which the wrought is made to appear as if it were the received. We call the tradition realism; the technologies are unnameable’ (Forty-One False Starts 73).\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 12\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n13\n\nworks considered here, non-fictional or not, are composed of these different elements, in various ratios and combinations, and with different consequences. * Second, I am interested in how certain strains of non-fiction narrate an encounter with the past unlike that produced by dominant (and often reductive) forms of public, post-apartheid or nationalist historiography. A ‘usable past’ is a familiar phrase, coined by the American literary critic and biographer Van Wyck Brooks. Writing in 1918, he opposed the conservative reflex by which scholars invoked the past to disparage the present, asking instead for a more dynamic approach in which history is better imagined as ‘an inexhaustible storehouse of apt attitudes and adaptable ideals; it opens itself at the touch of desire, it yields up, now this treasure, now that’ (331). ‘If we need another past so badly’, he went on, ‘is it inconceivable that we might discover one, that we might even invent one?’ (339) The invention of a usable past is of course an important project in newly liberated, transitional or decolonising societies where various political and cultural actors are trying to recover silenced histories: a moment (like South Africa in the 1990s) when textbooks must be rewritten and the basic contours of a new national narrative imagined into being. But what lies beyond that culturally sanctioned, politically appropriate moment of retrieval, reconstruction and remembering? What about an inappropriate, unpredictable or unusable past? In her far-reaching reflections on slave memory in the post-apartheid moment, What is Slavery to Me? (2010), Pumla Gqola reminds the reader that processes of public remembering and forgetting always exist side by side, and that imaginative renderings of history must themselves be historicised in order to understand ‘the relationships of entanglement between the forms of memory found and the timing of their public rehearsal’ (7). In tracing how the slave past ‘moves from the obscured to the well recognised’ (5), she nonetheless stresses the more discordant and difficult elements of this process: how a historical consciousness of slavery and its violence might have been masked by subsequent generations as a matter of survival; how archival traces of the disremembered reside in ‘modes that do not easily give up the stories’ (4). ‘The relationship of historiography to memory’, she writes, ‘is one of containment’ (7). At a still greater distance from South Africa’s first democratic elections, I would suggest that the idea of a too easily usable past carries a more dubious charge (one not dissimilar to the sceptical, Marxist notion of an invented tradition). It is a moment when the decolonial impulse to retrieve previously unvoiced histories can be co-opted by new forms of distorting nationalism; and when even the most self-confidently progressive engagements with the archive might risk ‘using’ – by which I mean instrumentalising, or conscripting – past existences that should properly retain more resistance to the designs\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 13\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nof the present. In circling around the phrase ‘unusable pasts’ (my alternate title for this book), I am concerned with all those awkward, ill-fitting, untimely histories that cannot be made to perform a simple or immediately recognisable political gesture. In telling the lives of defectors from the liberation struggle, or narrating the collapse of the ill-fated African Resistance Movement, writers like Jacob Dlamini and Hugh Lewin assemble complex meditations on betrayal, complicity and collaboration. In his memoir ‘I Gave the Names’, Adrian Leftwich reflects on a lifetime of infamy that followed from his turning state witness against his comrades in the 1960s. South African history is often produced as a series of heroic biographies, but these non-fictions turn to ideologically opaque or ‘useless lives’. The phrase is from the trial of Demetrios Tsafendas, the man who stabbed to death apartheid Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd on 6 September 1966, in full view of South Africa’s parliament. Tsafendas (the presiding judge declared) was a ‘meaningless creature’ who had led a ‘useless life’. The father of apartheid struck down at the height of his power by a ‘mad Greek’, a schizophrenic drifter who believed his body to be parasitised and was (so the story goes) acting on instructions from a tapeworm inside his gut – it is one of the strangest facts in South African history. It is also, of course, a kind of fiction, and one which first spurred me into thinking seriously about the literary treatment of actual lives. Tsafendas is quickly written out of Long Walk to Freedom as an ‘obscure white parliamentary messenger’ (512). Yet in fact he was not ‘White’, but rather someone who found himself multiply misread by apartheid’s bureaucratic machine. He is a figure often passed over in standard histories, disavowed by both Afrikaner and African nationalism. But his extraordinary, wandering life has been refracted into an array of texts and artworks that are often speculative, deconstructed and non-linear. So what does it mean to read history through such ‘creative’ forms, and how might they conceive of a past that in some measure refuses the desires and projections of the present? ‘Non-political’ prisoners, con men, collaborators, askaris, HIV/AIDS denialists, betrayers, ‘ordinary’ lives in extraordinary times – these are persons and predicaments that do not yield any easy political capital, but which for that very reason may be all the more powerful in understanding what it has meant for South Africans to make sense of their lives in, through, and despite politics. * The third intellectual problem threaded through the book unfolds from the following thought experiment: can the category non-fiction be theorised, can it even be imagined, without reference to colonialism and its aftermaths? After all, it sounds odd to speak of the myriad different kinds of knowledge encoded in southern African societies in forms other than the written document as\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 14\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n15\n\n‘non-fiction’. In their wide-ranging introduction to Selves in Question (a 2006 volume of interviews on southern African auto/biography) the editors reject labels like ‘life narrative’ and ‘life writing’. They remark, quite rightly, that such concepts do not take account of the wide range of symbolic expressions in which lives can take shape; that they are ‘biased against non-narrative, oral or non-verbal accounts’ (Coullie et al. 8). But it is precisely the problem of writing that one is forced to consider in theorising prose non-fiction: writing up the lives of other people; writing down their words. Writing up in the sense of filing a report, an article or even a PhD: forms premised on closure, judgement – the production of usable information, often for a distant audience. Writing down in the sense of transcribing, notating, translating and re-ordering the words spoken by somebody else. The shift from the spoken to the written, Stephen Gray remarked in 1985, persists as our major literary event: across all kinds of southern African texts, the narrator is continually positioned as ‘amanuensis of the spoken word’ (10). Works like Charles van Onselen’s The Seed is Mine (1997) and Steinberg’s The Number (2004) are exercises in cultural translation on a massive scale: enormous projects of transcribing, sifting and arranging the words of non-elite (and sometimes non-literate) narrators. From this point of departure (one not always considered by influential Euro-American approaches to literary journalism), the whole question of nonfiction is inseparably bound up with power, racialised difference and the particular forms of knowledge production that took shape in the colonial contact zone: logbooks of maritime exploration; trading company reports; projects of terrestrial surveying, prospecting and cataloguing; the archives of natural history, ethnography and colonial administration. That vast and oppressive collection, in other words, of ‘Narratives’, ‘Accounts’, ‘Travels’, and ‘Descriptions’ that make up what V. Y. Mudimbe has called ‘the colonial library’ (213). This genealogy of the documentary carries with it the knowledge techniques and technologies of colonial modernity: the invention of orthography and comparative philology; the global circulation of information via imperial networks intent on producing comparable sets of data; the reduction of African languages and life-worlds to print; the biopolitics of anthropometric photography, identity documents, census taking and pass books. In this context, ‘nonfiction’ comes to signify less a universalised debate about the nature of truth and falsehood than a particular set of textual practices and print cultures that make landfall from the fifteenth century onwards, and then undergo manifold transformations and contestations.8 As with many other postcolonies, South 8 To give a very literal example of a colonial documentary form making landfall: in an outline of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) writing system, Adrien Delmas shows how the daghregister (diary) of Jan van Riebeeck was first and fundamentally a nautical\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 15\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfrica’s is ‘a literature that has developed from exogenous sources and has ever since been through innumerable processes of adaptation and indigenisation’ (Attwell, Rewriting Modernity 19). It is from one of the most famous examples of this process that I borrow my title. Writing from his ashram at Sabarmati, Gujarat, on 26 November 1925, the 56-year-old Mohandas K. Gandhi – once a London-trained barrister in a suit, now a khadi-wearing Mahatma – begins his autobiography with a note of scepticism toward the whole idea of a written life. Some of his nearest coworkers (we are told) had prevailed on him to embark on the project; but ‘a God-fearing friend has his doubts’: ‘What has set you on this adventure?’ he asked. ‘Writing an autobiography is a practice peculiar to the West. I know of nobody in the East having written one, except amongst those who come under Western influence. And what will you write? Supposing you reject tomorrow the things you hold as principles today, or supposing you revise in the future your plans of today, is it not likely that the men who shape their conduct on the authority of your word, spoken or written, may be misled?’ (14)\n\nThis argument, Gandhi writes, ‘had some effect on me. But it is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiography’: I simply want to tell the story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape of an autobiography. (14)\n\nThis ‘Author’s Introduction’ was the first of a series of articles published between 1925 and 1929 in Gandhi’s own newspaper Navajivan (Young India), the successor to Indian Opinion, which he had established in 1903 at the Phoenix settlement outside Durban. And so what the English-speaking reader today encounters as An Autobiography first appeared in Gujarati as a long-running serialization under the title ‘The Story of My Experiments with Truth’. At Sabarmati, Gandhi had already completed the political history of his South African years, Satyagraha in South Africa (1928). It is a work that, not unlike Plaatje’s Native Life, tells the story of a frustrated appeal to the ideal of a form, requiring a daily log of conditions for navigation and dead reckoning at sea. At the southern tip of Africa, the seventeenth-century daghregister, ‘begun with the casting-off from Texel, would not […] be stopped, and would continue its narrative for the next one hundred and fifty years of the VOC’s presence at the Cape of Good Hope’ (106). Once on land, the Company directives about logging daily events were equally insistent: ‘Of all that occurs in your neighbourhood, you will keep accurate notes and a diary’, instructed Amsterdam on the eve of Van Riebeeck’s departure, ‘and shall not fail in this point’ (cited in Moodie 8). Such records have since formed the archival grain for several historical, postcolonial, post-apartheid novels set in the early Cape Colony.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 16\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n17\n\nglobal imperial subject; this is then abandoned for the different political strategy of satyagraha: often translated as ‘passive resistance’ but literally ‘truthforce’, ‘truth insistence’ or ‘firmness in truth’. In his characteristically mercurial style as editor, writer and leader, Gandhi hybridises and adapts supposedly ‘Western’ forms of print culture and autobiography for his own purposes, blurring the traditional liberal distinction of individual and political, and writing even the most intimate details of his bodily functions – his diet, his bowels, his sexual urges – into his autobiographical experiments.9 Along with Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom, Gandhi’s life must rank as the one of the most widely read autobiographies in the world (the contemporary Navajivan Trust edition, which retails for Rs.30, just over R6 or around half a US dollar, records almost 16 million copies printed, and this in English translation alone). Mandela’s Long Walk is strenuously allegorical, secular and collective: the ‘autobiography’ of a movement in which every detail has the feel of having been comprehensively reverse-engineered to serve the political parable. Partly the product of a team of ghostwriters at an American publisher, Mandela’s ‘I’ is less the trace of a confiding, historical subject than a strategy to write a new nation into being.10 Gandhi’s Experiments are more personal and piecemeal, imbued with the gnomic, otherworldly or unknowable truths of religious thought. ‘The instruments for the quest of truth are as simple as they are difficult’, he writes towards the end of the Introduction: ‘The seeker after truth should be humbler than the dust. The world crushes the dust under its feet, but the seeker after truth should so humble himself that even the dust could crush him’ (16). Yet saints, as George Orwell remarked in his 1949 ‘Reflections on Gandhi’, should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent (Collected Essays 9 See the discussion in Moore-Gilbert’s Postcolonial Life-Writing, in which he remarks that ‘from the outset, An Autobiography conjoins “reform” of Gandhi’s individual body with the struggle against foreign domination. Indeed, his desire for mastery of bodily appetites provides a template for developing the self-control and self-discipline necessary not just to attain self-rule in the political sphere, but to remain worthy of it’ (38). Moore-Gilbert introduces his book by showing how slave narratives like that of Olaudah Equiano (‘a precursor form of postcolonial life writing’) begin to circulate from as early as 1770: ‘This is roughly the same moment as Rousseau’s Confessions, widely regarded as the inaugural instance of western autobiography in a recognisably modern form’ (xi). As such, the question of empire is present at the founding moment of modern autobiography, if one widens the angle of vision (and so too the dual helix of confessional and testimonial impulses that wind through the varied life writings that I consider in this book). 10 For an account of how Mandela’s ‘extraordinarily reticent, even colourless’ narrative of imprisonment might have displaced or substituted for a very different kind of prison book written during his incarceration, see Schalkwyk, ‘Mandela’s “Missing” Manuscript’ (207) and Roux, ‘Mandela Writing / Writing Mandela’.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 17\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\n451); and the idea of experimenting with truth takes on a more dubious connotation in the larger Gandhian story. Arundhati Roy’s 2014 polemic, ‘The Doctor and the Saint’, decries the unseemly loyalty demonstrated by the young Gandhi to the British Empire, particularly during the brutal suppression of the Bambatha Rebellion of 1906. With the help of other dissenting scholars, she traces how his autobiography elides the segregationist and anti-black sentiments of his South African years. The fact that his vision of satyagraha was not extended to black South Africans during his Durban and Johannesburg years has led to a diametrically revisionist idea of Gandhi in some circles. This cultural shift from him being claimed by the ANC as one of the fathers of the liberation struggle to being written off as racist makes him another example of an awkward or ambivalent figure from history: someone who has changed from being a usable icon to a more unpredictable, unstable element of the South African past. Nonetheless, both Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom and Gandhi’s Autobiography remain global emblems of how it is in testimonial non-fictional forms that one finds the counter-voice that has always accompanied colonial conquest and political injustice: the humanitarian objection, mediated via texts that rely on documentary techniques even as they contest the uses to which these have previously been put. In this sense, the colonial library in southern Africa also holds works by writers like François Le Vaillant, John Philip, Thomas Pringle, Tiyo Soga, Olive Schreiner, Emily Hobhouse, John Tengo Jabavu, William Wellington Gqoba, John Langalibalele Dube, H. I. E. Dhlomo – producers of critical, corrective or anti-colonial non-fiction in a globalising imperial world, and precursors of the kinds of reportage and literary journalism that underwrite the twentieth-century liberation struggle. Prolific writers and editors of the New African Movement like Dhlomo were, Ntongela Masilela has argued, the crucial figures in ‘constructing the theoretical, political and epistemological instrumentarium’ for understanding and shaping a black South African modernity on its own terms (Cultural Modernity 5). It is in early black newspapers and periodicals – Dube’s Ilange lase Natal (The Natal Sun), Jabavu’s Imvo Zabantsundu (African Opinion), Plaatje’s Tsala ea Batho (The People’s Friend), to name just a few – that one can look for a longer genealogy of literary non-fiction in southern Africa. ‘What initially looked like a newspaper’, writes Isabel Hofmeyr of Gandhi’s Indian Opinion, ‘starts to resemble an ethical anthology’ on closer inspection (5), one that initially appeared in four languages (English, Gujarati, Tamil and Hindi) and four scripts. In such print cultures one sees the creation of a multilingual, sometimes anonymous and generically various counter-archive, one that contests the distortions and denialism of a white-supremacist press and its compulsive and phantasmic framing of ‘the native problem’. ‘A situation such as that existing in southern Africa’, wrote Mothobi Mutloatse in the introduction to the 1980\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 18\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nHistorical and theoretical approaches\n\n19\n\nanthology Forced Landing, ‘compels the black artist to use all avenues available to him in expressing the black experience, and whether it be autobiographically, sociologically, dramatically, poetically or otherwise, is not so important’ (1). Its companion volume, Reconstruction (1981), affords the categories ‘Journalism’ and ‘Essays’ an equal footing with ‘Poetry’ and ‘Prose’ in reading across 90 years of black historical literature. ‘It seems to me’, he goes on, that the black artist ‘is expected to be a jack of all trades – and a master of all! He has to be a tradesman, docker, psychologist, nurse, miner, matshigilane, tshotsha, teacher, athlete, toddler, mother, musician, father, visionary, imbongi and – above all – oral historian. That’s Forced Landing…’ (1). With all this in mind, the bringing together of ‘non-fiction’ and ‘non-white’ in my opening lines was no accident. When viewed from southern Africa, the claims to objectivity and documentary truth involved in writing up the lives of others are implicated in a long and painful history of producing (in the sense of producing knowledge about) the ‘non-white’: a history in which whiteness is the fiction that passes as normative fact. Objectivity, as Frantz Fanon remarked in The Wretched of the Earth, is always wielded against the native (‘Pour le colonisé, l’objectivité est toujours dirigée contre lui’ 75). The long shadow of that colonial ethnography, and what poet Gabeba Baderoon calls ‘the hurt of the Non’ (The History of Intimacy 58), must surely be held in mind when considering how the non-fiction text creates a reality it claims only to describe. And as Fanon, Biko and Edward Said have all shown in different ways, the discourse of the powerful is not simply a matter of silencing, effacing and ignoring other life-worlds. It is also a productive endeavour: an encyclopaedic, proliferating corpus of information techniques that are used to ‘know’ and to govern the subject (who becomes an object) of enquiry. ‘One of the most difficult things to do these days is to talk with authority on anything to do with African culture’; so runs the opening line of a 1971 address by Biko, who goes on to critique the unreality and hypocrisy of a certain strain of white-dominated intellectual production that, even in its most liberal variants, professed an opposition to racial inequality while nonetheless assuming an undue epistemic command over the lives of others: Somehow Africans are not expected to have any deep understanding of their own culture or even themselves. Other people have become authorities on all aspects of African life or to be more accurate on BANTU life. Thus we have the thickest volumes on some of the strangest subjects – even the ‘feeding habits of the ­Urban Africans’, a publication by a fairly ‘liberal’ group, Institute of Race Relations. (I Write What I Like 44).\n\nAny theorisation of non-fiction from the postcolony can hardly forget this history, and this challenge: the need for a ‘truth-force’ that will counter a demeaning objectivity; for frank talk that will contest a racialised knowingness; for\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 19\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nvernacular knowledge that will resist official or authoritarian informationgathering. Written into a context of material inequality and unresolved difference, narrative non-fiction in contemporary South Africa must (if it is equal to its situation) grapple in particularly charged ways with the power imbalances and risks involved in writing up the lives of others, even as it does evolve ways of telling that do make a strong claim on the real, and on real bodies. Self-reflexivity and an explicit foregrounding of subject position and the authorial presence, the narrating ‘I’, is one method of doing so; but it is not, I will argue, the only method, nor necessarily the most sincere, ‘honest’ or convincing. Experiments with Truth tries to widen and make more open-ended this discussion about epistemic authority and narrative method. It tracks the different ways in which compelling non-fictive texts mark out (and are marked by) long-running debates about historiography, knowledge production and the ethics of representation – even as they do attempt new ways of representing southern African history. With democratic South Africa now entering a moment of profound disillusion, disappointment and impatience – a moment signalled by renewed youth activism under the mantra of decolonisation – the practice of writing and reading narrative non-fiction is shot through with deep questions about the creation of knowledge: how it is produced, by whom and for whom. For if, as Ndebele has written, the death of apartheid must be seen not as an event but as a social process (Fine Lines 93), then the non-fiction of South Africa’s transition suggests how long, uneven and psychically complex this process will be.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 20\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nUnusable pasts\n\nThe secret history of Demetrios Tsafendas: assassin, madman, messenger\n\n2\n\nIn 2012, Human Rights Day in South Africa was officially commemorated not in Sharpeville, where the massacre that it marks took place on 21 March 1960, but in Soweto’s Kliptown, site of the signing of the Freedom Charter in 1955. President Jacob Zuma’s decision to distance the proceedings – physically and politically – from a march originally organised by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) provoked protest both on the streets of present-day Sharpeville and in the pages of the left-liberal press.1 Yet this state-led attempt to arrogate the meanings of Sharpeville was derailed entirely by the events of 16 August 2012 at the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana, when over one hundred striking workers were shot by policemen, and thirty-four killed. As the single most lethal use of force by the state against civilians since 1960, the Marikana massacre was soon dubbed the Sharpeville of post-apartheid South Africa. As the country has moved through other anniversaries and historical landmarks – the centenary of the 1913 Natives Land Act, the death of Nelson Mandela in 2013, the celebration of two decades since the first democratic elections in 1994 – such historical shorthands have become more common in the public sphere. Schoolchildren under Hendrik Verwoerd’s ‘Bantu education’ system may have received better instruction than the ‘gutter education’ of learners in some South African provinces today – a claim made by Mamphela Ramphele (‘Education System’, online). Campaigners against the Protection of Information Act (dubbed the ‘Secrecy Bill’) have repeatedly deemed it a step back toward apartheid-era censorship. Student confrontations with riot police during the #FeesMustFall protests of 2015 onwards have been refracted through the iconography of the Soweto Uprising, with placards reading: ‘1976 Reloaded’.2 1 The decision showed ‘an extraordinary failure of political and historical attention’ on Zuma’s part, wrote the editor of the Mail & Guardian Nic Dawes; in a year marking the centenary of the African National Congress, the ‘bombast of ANC historiography’ had effectively ‘decocted the content of the Sharpeville story and filled up the vessel of Human Rights Day with the narrative of the charter and the governing party’ (‘Why Zuma Can’t Bury Sharpeville’ 7). 2 See Booysen ed. Fees Must Fall for examples of and reflections on this comparison.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 21\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n22\n\nUnusable pasts\n\nWhat is at stake in such linkings of past and present? And to what extent should they be indulged or resisted? They seem at once inevitable and unsatisfying. Inevitable given that the conduct of the ruling party has borne out the thesis of an 1881 essay by Ernst Renan (one anthologised by Homi Bhabha in the influential 1990 collection Nation and Narration) which suggests that the modern nation-state constitutes itself through acts of both selective commemoration and deliberate forgetting – ‘I would even go so far as to say historical error’ (11). Nationalist agendas tend to resemble each other across the postcolonial divide, Edward Said remarks, particularly ‘in such malleable activities as reconstructing the past and inventing tradition’ (Freud and the Non-European 49).3 But such analogies and easy invocations of the past are also unsatisfying, even dangerous. Not only do they flatten out historical specificities, they also risk overlapping with a reactionary reflex that collapses the difference between (in this case) Afrikaner and African nationalist projects altogether: a strain of public discourse that works to excuse past injustice or to dismiss present transformation out of hand. As with those debates that turn obsessively on the question of whether to ‘blame’ apartheid or colonialism for current ills, the way in which history is put to work seems to show the often limited repertoire of conceptual shapes available to public culture as it debates the relation between past and present (and also reveals the difficulty of disaggregating progressive from reactionary critique of an ANC-led South Africa). ‘The flippant dismissal of the weight of the past on our collective present is just as unhelpful as its opposite’, writes poet (and once Deputy General Secretary of the South African Communist Party) Jeremy Cronin: ‘a simplistic evocation of that past as an alibi for our own weaknesses’ (‘How History Haunts Us’, online). More generally, what one is often left with is South African history and apartheid as a stock of all-too-familiar and overused signs. It is at this juncture that I hope to explore how certain forms of non-fiction might suggest models for estranging the past and for escaping the overly familiar rhetorical moves of much public debate. If ‘Sharpeville’ or ‘Bantu Education’, ‘censorship’ or ‘1976’ emerge as immediately recognisable (and usable) signs of apartheid’s human rights violations, then what might an unusable past consist of? What of an unrecognisable or even unpredictable past?\n\n3 A substantial body of post-apartheid literary and historical scholarship has considered how the South African past has been treated in ways that range from the innovative and liberatory to the politically expedient and patriarchal. See for example Baderoon, Regarding Muslims; Coetzee and Nuttall eds. Negotiating the Past; Gqola, What is Slavery to Me?; Johnson, Imagining the Cape Colony; Lalu, The Deaths of Hintsa; Samuelson, Remembering Nation; and Witz et al., Unsettled History.\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 22\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\nThe secret history of Demetrios Tsafendas\n\n23\n\nThe following chapters track a cluster of figures and events that have remained recalcitrant to now familiar narratives of struggle, liberation, truth, and reconciliation. They are concerned with histories that do not fit such linear, end-stopped plots. Demetrios Tsafendas, the ‘mad Greek’ who stabbed to death the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd, at the height of his power on 6 September 1966; the demise of the African Resistance Movement (ARM) following the psychological collapse of one of its leaders who turned state witness and betrayed his closest friends; the trial and execution of member John Harris, who placed a suitcase of petrol and explosives under a bench in Johannesburg’s Park Station during rush hour on 24 July 1964: each of these figures, and the events surrounding them, seem at once both present in the artistic imaginary but curiously absent from the way that South African history has come to be formalised. Often entangled and conflated by literature, these events from the mid-1960s provide a very literal example of how (to return to Coetzee’s metaphor) there exists no ‘answer script’ of history against which the literary text can be checked, as if by a censorious schoolmistress (‘The Novel Today’ 2). Instead, what one finds in each case are gaps in official historiography, around which are ranged a wide variety of creative treatments – texts that are by turns speculative, explicitly personal, or formally experimental. The histories of Tsafendas, Harris and the ARM represent sites of disassociation and disavowal, of humiliation, mental collapse, misplaced heroism and regret. The spectre of meaninglessness haunts them. Summing up ‘The State versus Demetrio Tsafendas’ on 20 October 20 1966, Judge J. P. Beyers talked of ’n niksbeduidende skepsel and sy nuttelose lewe – a meaningless creature who had led a useless life. In the decade following Sharpeville, such incoherent or incompetent ‘plots’ could not easily be absorbed into a politics of resistance – if, that is, the political was to be envisioned only as the domain of organised, collective and rational action. The historical impulse here seeks simply to thicken a sense of the South African past and to assess what valence one can give to speculative or formally experimental engagements with the apartheid archive. A more literary approach seeks to probe the matter of genre and literary form, imagined here as itself a kind of archive: a repertoire of narrative gestures and rhetorical figures that are simultaneously drawn on and refashioned in the writing event. As a deep narrative ‘grammar’, in other words, that determines the coming-intobeing of statements: that (to adapt Michel Foucault) describes ‘the law of what can be said’ in any given mode (The Archaeology of Knowledge 145). Why have these events compelled such generically varied and experimental approaches? What are their possibilities and limits; what is it that each chosen form can or cannot say?\n\nZ01_Twid_Book B.indb 23\n\n01/03/2019 10:33\n\n24\n\nUnusable pasts\n\nIn this chapter, I concentrate on the Tsafendas story, one that has intrigued me for a number of years.4 The opening section sketches the archive of official documents, myth and personal remembrance that surrounds and produces (or effaces) this man in the national imaginary. The later sections track more carefully how Tsafendas appears in a range of cultural forms, many of them experimental and playing at the borders of the fictive and the documentary. I pay close attention to the 1966 government report on the Verwoerd assassination, a fascinatingly conflicted document, yet one that many later creative treatments must rely on for its fine-grained archival texture. I then move on to Henk van Woerden’s speculative biography A Mouthful of Glass (originally published in Dutch as Een mond vol glas in 1998, translated and edited by Dan Jacobson in 2000) and close with an analysis of Penny Siopis’s short film Obscure White Messenger (2010), two artworks that represent, I believe, the most compelling responses to the question of Tsafendas and his ‘useless life’.\n\n‘A man without a country’ The many meanings of a meaningless life\n\n‘When Tsafendas reached Dr. Verwoerd’s bench, he drew the dagger, leaning over Dr. Verwoerd as though he wanted to say something to him, and then gave Dr. Verwoerd the first stab in his chest on the left side.’ So reads the Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Circumstances of the Death of the Late Dr. the Honourable Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd as it renders the climactic deed at 14:10 in the House of Assembly, September 6, 1966: ‘Dr. Verwoerd raised his hands as if to ward him off, and Tsafendas dealt him three more stabs before several Members of Parliament rushed to Dr. Verwoerd’s aid and overpowered Tsafendas’ (14). The tragicomic mixture of deference and violence here is suggestive of the larger problem that the enquiry had to address. How had so obscure and questionable a man as Tsafendas managed to come into such deadly proximity to the embodiment of high apartheid power? And what exactly was the nature of his ‘message’? The death of Verwoerd marked an indelible date in the lives of many South Africans (as did the assassination John F. Kennedy for Americans) and it provides a trigger for personal reminiscence among those of a certain generation: an entry into what one historian has called the ‘psychic archive’ of apartheid\n\n4 See also Twidle, ‘Visions of Tsafendas’, revised and extended for a 2017 collection of essays and creative non-fiction, Firepool: Experiences in an Abnormal World. These pieces reflect on the difficulties of approaching a life like that of Tsafendas within the disciplinary norms of academic research, and contain all the "
