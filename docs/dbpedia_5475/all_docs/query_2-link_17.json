        "text": "In postcolonial literary scholarship, not only is language generally seen as a signifier of culture and identity, it is also conceived as a tool for inscribing alienation, cultural difference, cultural distance and so on. This is why the idea of using a particular language, often the imperial one, in forging national unity in the post-colony has become the order of the day. Contradicting this position, this paper examines the linguistic strategies deployed in four post-apartheid works of fiction in order to demonstrate their metonymic significance in engendering national and cultural integrations in post-apartheid South Africa. It identifies code-mixing, code-switching, un-translated words and glossing as major linguistic strategies used in the selected works as textual and creative contribution to national integration in post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nOffering a reading of Mongane Wally Serote’s Revelations (2010) alongside other recent novels by black South African writers, this essay answers calls for more careful analyses of the roles that race plays within post-apartheid literature and culture. As it questions the shift away from a concern with institutional racism and white supremacy that is evident in much contemporary South African criticism, the essay contends that post-apartheid literature is not only racially marked, but also continues to produce knowledge on racial inequality, racial ideology, and resistance. In the process, it illustrates that grappling with colorblindness challenges pervasive understandings of nonracialism, reconciliation, and post-1994 literature. Revelations portrays nonracialism and reconciliation as necessary and inevitable, yet shows that the discourses are in conflict with demands for equality and justice. Concurrently veiling and revealing paradoxes inherent in South Africa’s dominant racial discourses from within, Serote’s novel demonstrates that enforcing colorblindness is an act of epistemic violence: not even at the diegetic level is nonracialism achievable.\n\nThe primary objective of this article, among other prescripts, is to unravel the lexicological arena of colonialism and apartheid as a pertinent subject in Ncedile Saule’s Umlimandlela (At the cross-roads). The reason to undertake this scholarly discourse is because of the vestigial elements of colonialism and apartheid that continue to subterfuge the constitutional democracy of our country, thereby decaying and delaying social cohesion and consciousness. Post-colonial theory is employed given that it concentrates on matters before and after the formal end of colonialism in South Africa in 1994. On the other hand, qualitative research methodology is utilized to recognize the selected isiXhosa novel as a primary source of data. Through conceptual and contextual discussions, the main findings certify that though South Africa formally ended colonialism, the currently witnessed colonial tendencies are deeply rooted in the colonial and apartheid systems. As a result, it is fair to accept...\n\nDrawing on broader discussions that attempt to envision new ways of negotiating identity, nationalism and race in a post-colonial, post-apartheid South Africa, this thesis examines how whiteness is constructed and negotiated within the framework of literary-journalistic narratives. It is significant that so many established journalists have chosen a literary format, in which they use the structure, conventions, form and style of the novel, while clearly foregrounding their journalistic priorities, to re-imagine possibilities for narratives of identity and belonging for white South Africans. I argue that by working at the interstice of literature and journalism, writers are able to open new rhetorical spaces in which white South African identity can be interrogated. This thesis examines the literary narratives of Rian Malan (My Traitor’s Heart, 1991), Antjie Krog (Country of My Skull, 1998, and Begging to be Black, 2009), Kevin Bloom (Ways of Staying, 2009) and Jonny Steinberg (Midlands, 2002). These writers all seem to grapple with the recurring themes of ‘history’, ‘narrative’ and ‘identity’, and in exploring the narratives of their personal and national history, they attempt to make sense of their current situation. The texts that this thesis examines exhibit an acute awareness of the necessity of bringing whiteness into conversation with ‘other’ identities, and thus I explore both the ways in which that is attempted and the degree to which the texts succeed, in their respective projects. I also examine what literary genres offer these journalists in their engagement with issues of whiteness and white identity that conventional forms of journalism do not. These writers are challenging the conventions of genre – both literary and journalistic – during a period of social and political flux, and I argue that in attempting to limn new narrative forms, they are in fact outlining new possibilities for white identities and ways of belonging and speaking. However, a close reading of these literary-journalistic narratives reveals whiteness in post-apartheid South African to be a multifaceted and often contradictory construct and position. Despite the lingering privilege and structural advantage associated with whiteness, South African whiteness appears strongly characterised by a deep-seated anxiety that stems from a perpetual sense of ‘un-belonging’. However, while white skin remains a significant marker of identity, there does appear to be the possibility of moving beyond whiteness into positions of hybridity which offer interesting potential for ‘becoming-other’.\n\nThe central argument in Alain Ricard’s Le Sable de Babel. Traduction et apartheid explores the complex relationship between translation as a practice that builds bridges and makes connections and apartheid as a set of concepts, laws and institutions that sought to implement racial separateness. Ricard emphasizes the ethics at work in dialogic translation; a practice that involves the creation of meaning and intercultural dialogue. Following the myth of Babel in the Bible according to which people were dispersed into different language groups, Ricard takes up Paul Ricoeur’s invitation to embrace translation as a means of overcoming these linguistic divisions with an ethics of hospitality across languages (Ricoeur, Sur la traduction, 2004). Of course, any openness to transcend the boundaries of language and ethnicity through translation was banished under apartheid with the adoption of racist laws, the segregation of space and the virtual exclusion of translation from Bantu education programs. Through the separation of people by race came connections between territory (inhabited by whites, blacks, coloreds, Indians), language (Afrikans, Xhosa, Zulu, etc.) and political rights in South Africa. Whereas many may have seen the form of despotism that was set up in South Africa under apartheid as somehow unique to that regime (1948-1994), Mahmood Mamdani has argued that the “decentralized despotism” under apartheid can and should be seen as exemplary of colonial relations of domination everywhere on the continent (Mamdani, Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism, 1997). Ricard builds on Mamdani’s observations and argues that African literature as a basic expression of freedom came up against a concept of human relations defined by the domination of one group by another across the continent."
