Accordingly, it is necessary to “own up” to my authorial presence. Born in apartheid South Africa to parents involved in anti-apartheid work, I was raised in a highly politicized and violent context. The interest that I developed in the film medium in my teenage years grew out of my family’s obsession with recording: my father would borrow a video camera once every few years in order to interview my sister and me about our lives, our political views, and our dreams for the future; he would also give the video camera to us and we would interview our parents on similar topics. In this way, the personal, political, historical, and anthropological potential latent in film as an audiovisual recording medium became apparent to me. As an undergraduate in the United States, I studied film production jointly with literature and found the theory and practice of film adaptation a compelling way of coalescing my interest in both art forms—cinema and literature. Adapting a South African novel, Olive Schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm (1883), into a short film as part of my Honors thesis, I felt great pleasure in feeling as though I was returning to my “African roots.” As a consequence, I decided to merge my love of Africa and my passion for film adaptation through a Ph.D. on African film adaptation. From the time at which I embarked on the Ph.D. until the present, in my position as a Lecturer in African Film at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, I have seen my work as twofold: on the one hand, as theoretical and critical, through my conventional academic writing; on the other hand, as practical, pedagogical, and political, in my founding of\n\nthe Cambridge African Film Festival (www.cambridgeafricanfilmfestival. co.uk) and my involvement in the founding and organization of the London African Film Festival as a way of increasing exhibition and distribution of African films in the UK, through my work as a filmmaker, and through my teaching. As I began my Ph.D., I found myself reading accounts of African cinema describing it as the “last cinema” due to its notorious overlooked situation globally. As small and localized as the Cambridge African Film Festival’s impact has been since its inauguration in 2002, it has nevertheless provided a forum for showing African films and the education of UK audiences on Africa through discussions with African filmmakers after the screenings. Coming to understand in a very real, hands-on sense the difficulties that face African filmmakers in getting their films distributed and exhibited has been an important part of my education as an African film critic. Furthermore, having made films myself, I am acutely aware of the institutional, communal, and practical aspects of the film medium which determine that the process of making a film is not an isolated and controlled one, but often contingent on multiple, recalcitrant factors and replete with necessary compromises. While the interpretation of one’s work remains with the beholder, the particular nature of filmmaking means that frequently a brief interview with a director can clear up a great number of issues and save the critic from embarrassingly far-fetched interpretations. Personal interviews with African filmmakers, writers, and actors therefore inform this book and are a crucial part of my methodology in all my work. In my conventional academic writing, of which this book is an example, one of my goals has been to do justice to the complexity of African screen media through providing extended, formal analyses of particular African films, while drawing simultaneously on interviews, historical sources, and sociocultural analysis in my interpretations. I had the privilege, over a steaming coffee in snow-covered Sweden, at the 2006 Stockholm African Film Festival, of asking Manthia Diawara, the first to write a book about continent-wide film production in Africa and an African filmmaker in his own right, what direction he feels African film criticism now needs to take. He said that what has been lacking within African film studies is a serious and profound consideration of the films themselves. Similarly, Keyan Tomaselli cites the great Ethiopian filmmaker, Haile Gerima, as saying: “As long as critical theory in African cinema does not make the transition to critixii\n\npreface\n\ncal analysis . . . the state of African cinema, now thirty years old, remains underdeveloped” (2006:84). Françoise Pfaff makes an argument for “innovative, kaleidoscopic analysis of African films” (2004a:8), and even scholars of Nigerian video films argue that, “We need much deeper readings of the films, approaching them as works of art with adequate interpretative sophistication” (Haynes 1997a:10). In African film studies, bibliographic approaches prevail, with critics recounting film narratives in an assumption that their readers will not have seen the films of which they speak. This has often been the case in the past, but as African films gain wider exposure and become more readily available for purchase, a rigorous tradition of African film scholarship needs to develop to complement this movement toward increased accessibility. Such scholarship might also broaden and enhance the work of early African film critics, who have been laboring steadily and tirelessly from the 1960s in order to secure more interest in the cinemas of Africa.1 The work of these African film critics and theorists has been supplemented more recently by the vital work of media ethnographers who are playing an important role in drawing together cultural-materialist and textual-aesthetic points of view, thereby emphasizing the need for film academics to acknowledge the geo-historical and sociocultural locatedness of the texts they analyze in addition to their aesthetic forms (Ginsburg, Abu-Lughod, and Larkin 2002; Askew and Wilk 2002). The ground covered by these researchers and critics is what makes this book possible. The extensive research into the contexts of film production, distribution, and exhibition in Africa—while by no means complete—has liberated me to concentrate to a greater extent in this book on the analysis of specific African films and the literary texts on which they draw, albeit consistently in relation to specific historical and political contexts and not with the assumption that texts are hermetically sealed aesthetic objects that exist outside of social life. Following media scholars such as Barber (2000), Ginsburg et al. (2002), Born (2004), and Tomaselli (2006), I have attempted to inflect my textual analysis with concern for how the texts are constituted by their social life and not in isolation from context. I attempt to analyze the films not only as texts but also as examples of material and cultural artifacts, where such artifacts emerge out of “a constellation of simultaneous social, institutional, technological, aesthetic and discursive forms” (Born 2004:96).\n\npreface\n\nxiii\n\nNevertheless, I want to emphasize the fact that my approach is in the first instance a textual one, in that it is a response to Diawara’s concerns that if African films are not treated as films (among other things), then we will necessarily succumb to the view that Africa has to offer the world only anthropological and historical objects. One of the arguments made in this book is that Africa is currently producing extraordinarily sophisticated, complex works of art—works of art that merit discussion not only in terms of their contexts but also their discourses and aesthetics. Just as all films (not merely African films) demand contextual and anthropological study, all films deserve textual analysis. While conventional film theory has not provided a means for successfully analyzing the heterogeneous genre of African screen media, nor have history and anthropology derived conclusive methodologies for doing so. It will only be through an interdisciplinary fusion of discourses—based in a profound awareness of autochthonous African practices and philosophies—that we might begin to develop adequate tools for this task. By focusing my analyses of the African films discussed here on the ways in which violence is represented and critiqued, I do not at all intend to suggest that violence is the only, or most important, feature to be examined in African cinema. On the contrary, I argue that by dealing with violence in certain ways, African filmmakers are participating in that larger project by African critics to try to understand and work against continuing violence, thus problematizing representations of Africa as inherently violent, and contributing to the ongoing construction of Africa itself. One of the guiding principles of the Cambridge African Film Festival has been to show films that reveal the many positive dimensions of Africa—dimensions that abound, remarkably, in spite of the poverty that continues to beleaguer the continent. The resilience, spirit, and humor that many Africans reveal in the face of such dire circumstances is inspiring, just as the films discussed in this book are inspiring in that they offer a profoundly progressive and humanist philosophy to the world at large at a time of widespread violence across the globe.\n\nxiv\n\npreface\n\nacknowledgments\n\nI want to thank Columbia University Press for its immediate interest in the original manuscript, and in particular Juree Sondker, associate editor at the Press during this time, for her stewarding of the project throughout, and Afua Adusei, editorial assistant at the Press, for handling the project in its final, crucial stages with such efficiency.

Late-afternoon sun streams into the large, cinder-block theater, making visible a magical gauze of red dust as more and more bodies enter, sweating, from the Sahelian heat outside. The rows of hard-backed chairs have completely filled up, so people do what feels most natural—they begin sitting down on the cool stone slabs, the steps between the rows, until the room is so packed it would be impossible to get out without a frantic bottleneck. You can hear the police officials shouting commands at people outside of the room, people who are still desperately battling to get in, suspecting that the film to be shown will be the highlight of the next year of their lives. You are lucky to be here. You were carried in by a tide of people, past the officials, who could do nothing to check this enthusiasm, whether spectators had tickets or not. The smell of frying brochettes (kebabs) drifts in from outside. You crane your neck to get a glimpse of the film starting on the screen: close-ups of a water surface, long shots of a village meet your gaze. A tingle of excitement runs down your spine as you glimpse the banner on one of the walls announcing that this is the 20th edition of FESPACO, the Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la télévision de Ouagadougou (Panafrican Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou), the largest and longest-running African film festival in the world. Founded in 1969 by a small group of African filmmakers, and held biannually in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso (the world’s fourth-poorest nation), FESPACO creates the sensation that “African Cinema” is not simply an imagined body of films, not simply a slogan for a desired but impossible\n\npan-African union, but something alive and well. After the day’s screenings, people gather around the pool at the Hotel Independence to drink millet beer and enjoy late-night debates about the films. On Sundays, Burkinabé gather to pray at the Place du Cinéaste Africain, a stone memorial at two dusty crossroads dedicated to the country’s filmmakers. About twenty feature films usually make up the official FESPACO competition list, spanning the entire continent from north to south. The sheer diversity of the films—examples of the multiplicity of and differences between film production in various African contexts—suggests that there are profound problems associated with the idea of an African Cinema. Acknowledgment of this dilemma has taken root in the recent alteration of the concept of “African Cinema” (pioneered by Vieyra 1975, Diawara 1992, and Ukadike 1994) to “African Cinemas” by certain contemporary African film critics (Barlet 2000; Turegano 2004). I prefer the term African screen media, which recognizes not only the plurality of styles and genres within African film production but also the increasingly diverse formats (video, television, new media) in which films are made. More metaphorically, the term media also reminds us, as Faye Ginsburg has argued, that films only come into being through a negotiation of sorts between maker and viewer—films are, quite literally, “mediators” (1995). Some African filmmakers have rejected the term “African Cinema” because of the bias implied not in the word cinema, but rather in the word African. They argue that the term might be seen to imply that Africa, a vast continent of fifty-three countries and hundreds of languages, is capable of producing only a certain kind of film. As Henry Louis Gates has shown, “Africa” derives from Latin and Greek words (meaning “sunny” and “without cold,” respectively), which were initially used to describe the north of the continent, but which later came to be applied to its entirety, thereby erasing its internal differences (1999:18). In opposition to totalizing accounts of Africa, which continue to assert themselves even today, contemporary postcolonial theorists have drawn attention away from the continental and toward the local—to a variety of different, specific Africas (McClintock 1992; Harrow 1999b; Haynes 1999a; Quayson 2000; Chrisman and Parry 2000; Young 2001). At the same time, certain African philosophers and writers such as Achille Mbembe (2001) and Tsitsi Dangarembga (2006) have pointed out that the desire for, or fantasy of, a continental African identity—inspired 2\n\nintroduction\n\nby the pan-Africanism of former leaders such as Haile Selassie, Kwame Nkrumah, and Gamal Abdel Nasser—has not foundered. This fantasy is manifested in political organizations such as the AU (African Union), in trade-economic partnerships such as NEPAD (New Partnership for African Development), and in arts festivals such as FESPACO and ZIFF (Zanzibar International Film Festival). Although African film criticism has tended to isolate sub-Saharan Africa from North Africa in its historiographies of film production, FESPACO features the work of many North African filmmakers, who have told me in interviews that they identify as much with Africa as with the Arab world. Martin Banham too has pointed out that “historically there has been immense cultural interchange between all parts of the continent, and particularly from the Arab world into East and West Africa” (2004:xv). The fact that Egyptian cinema, thriving already in the 1920s in the form of lavish, popular melodramas, has very different origins to cinema in other African countries has not prevented filmmakers, such as Khaled el Hagar, from seeking dialogue and collaboration with other African directors. In this sense, of the three definitions of Africa suggested by Ali Mazrui—racial, continental, and power-based—the continental definition seems to be in ascendancy (1986:26–30). The desire for pan-Africanism undoubtedly has something to do with a sense of shared, past oppression at the hands of the colonizers and, in film terms, it marks Africa as a continent that “is trying to reappropriate its image” (Gaston Kaboré, quoted in Thackway 2003:2). Pan-Africanism is, however, far more than a response to colonialism. The realities of life in Timbuktu and Maputo might be palpably different. The early militant cinema made in the ex-Portuguese (Lusophone) colonies might seem the antithesis of the burgeoning commercial video film industry in Nigeria (with a turnover of more than a thousand films a year). However, the desire of human subjects to erode boundaries and to unite into communities cannot be denied nor slighted—and neither can its potential to transform itself from imagination into reality be underestimated. The persistence of pan-African beliefs and attitudes in the African film scene cautions us against overlooking the role of desire, imagination, and subjectivity in the construction of African cinematic identities on the local, regional, and continental scales. The imbrication of imagination and reality has been theorized by scholars in a range of different fields in startlingly similar ways.\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nBenedict Anderson (1983) from a postcolonial perspective, Jacqueline Rose (1996) from a psychoanalytic point of view, and Brian Larkin (2002) from an anthropological stance have all explored the role that fantasy and imagination play in the construction specifically of nation-states. Anderson claims that the nation is “an imagined political community” (7) and that nationality and nationalism are “cultural artefacts of a particular kind” (4). Nations are therefore at once “imagined” and “artefacts,” immaterial and material. Taking off from Anderson’s concern with the nation, Rose in States of Fantasy concludes that “there is no way of understanding political identities and destinies without letting fantasy into the frame” (4), thereby allowing us to extemporize that cinema both frames and is framed by the nation and fantasy alike. For Rose, states exist in the concepts of “nations” as much as in the minds of nationals, and fantasizing—far from being a private, asocial activity—becomes generative of “the collective will . . . the unconscious dreams of nations” (3). Larkin, as a media ethnographer, explicitly references cinema, and the ease with which it lends itself to imagination and projection of national desire—both in the production and the reception of films. Negotiating between anthropological studies emphasizing materiality (Miller 2005) and those concerned with the role of imagination (Prins 2002; Turner 2002; Wilk 2002), Larkin argues in a study of the materiality of cinemas in Nigeria that fantasy is “the energy stored in the concreteness of objects” (319). Whether the material or the immaterial precedes the other is a question left unresolved by Anderson, Rose, and Larkin, but it would seem that they all view the fluidity between objects and concepts, the body and the mind, and nation-states and psychic states as certain. I too will explore this dialectic, and define films as cultural material artifacts as well as aesthetic texts that corral and inspire, and are corralled and inspired by, imagination, fantasy, and desire. However, I will look further than the interplay of imagination and nation to the implications of desire and fantasy for regions—both on a specific, smaller (South African and West African) scale and larger (African) scale. The greater aim of this book is to investigate local instances of filmmaking in order to test out possible continental trends, currents, and movements. Drawing together contemporary South African and Francophone West African film adaptations of literature as the objects of analysis seemed to me a productive way of acknowledging the differences among the cine4\n\nintroduction\n\nmatic production and traditions of diverse parts of the African continent, while also seeking clues to possible collective African identities on different scales (national, regional, continental). My faith in this project has been inspired in part by Imruh Bakari’s suggestion that the comparison of cinematic experiences in various African contexts is essential to the project of interrogating African cinema as a whole (2000:5). While the scope of the study and my unfamiliarity with languages other than English and French necessarily prevent me from covering the entirety of the African continent, a comparative study at least allows me to participate in that crucial conversation to which Kwame Anthony Appiah refers, a conversation at whose heart remains the exploration of the “possibilities and pitfalls of an African identity” (1992:xiii). In spite of the many differences identified, similar emphases in films from vastly different African contexts enables me to test out—however tentatively—the idea of Africa as a geographical and sociocultural entity with certain shared historical experiences and a certain shared vision for the future. That the contextual differences do demand serious attention and raise their own questions of integrity, however, is evident in the need for separate accounts of the histories of South African and Francophone West African film respectively (chapters 1 and 6). While I chose to undertake a comparative study of a national (South African) and a regional (Francophone West African) cinema partly to explore African identities in a range of geographical configurations, it is also the texts themselves that have demanded this focus. Since the early 1990s in South Africa and in Francophone West African countries (Senegal, Cameroon, and Mali), film adaptation of literature has flourished, but in a significantly different way in each context. In South Africa, filmmakers in the post-apartheid era have drawn on and adapted South African literary texts written during apartheid, in what appears to be a nation-building gesture, while in Francophone West Africa, filmmakers from different nations have taken inspiration from canonical literary texts—such as the Bible or Bizet’s Carmen—in what I will suggest is not a typical act of postcolonial appropriation, but a confident regional project of asserting Africa’s place in world history. While postcolonial and political theorists are sometimes too willing to reject the power of the state, the South African film adaptations remind us that in an immediate post-apartheid context a focus on the nation is wholly understandable. On the other hand, the fact that Francophone West African\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nfilmmakers are increasingly collaborating with one another suggests that the nearly half century since decolonization in West Africa has brought about a renewed emphasis on the region as the site with the most potential to foster cultural creativity. The separate historical introductions on the development of South African and Francophone West African film production are an attempt to take into account these important differences and their influence on film practices.\n\nAfrican Film: Adaptation, Violence, History The films examined here have been chosen not only because they are adaptations of literature but also because they are illustrative of a broader trend in African screen media that emphasizes the political and pedagogical responsibility of African film authors and audiences. In particular, the films highlight the filmmakers’ concern with the social realities of violence, and offer ways of conceptualizing, visualizing, and critiquing violence. The representation of violence of all kinds, physical and psychical, is evident in the films considered foundational in the cinematic corpus of Africa. The first documentary film by a black African, La Mort de Rasalama (Raberono; Madagascar, 1947), examines religious intolerance in its celebration of the centenary of the death of the female Malagasy Christian martyr, Rafaravavy Rasalama (1810–1837), who was speared under the reign of the queen Ranavalona I. The first short film by a black African, Mouramani (Mamadou Touré; France, 1953), is an adaptation of a West African oral story which allegorically critiques male dominance: the film centers on a relationship between a man and his dog, but the implication is that the dog’s subordinate role mirrors that of women. Bab el Hadid (Cairo Central Station) (Youssef Chahine, 1958), the most famous film by the “Father of Egyptian Cinema,” offers a chilling depiction of the influence of modernization and Westernization in Nasserian Egypt. The first short fiction film to be made in sub-Saharan Africa by a black African, Borom Sarret (directed by the “Father of African Cinema,” Ousmane Sembene; Senegal/France, 1963), observes the way in which the rich exploit the poor, and even the way the poor exploit one another. Sembene’s La Noire de . . . (Senegal/France, 1965), the film that most consider the first feature-length sub-Saharan African production, explores both continuing white racism in the postcolonial era and the materialism of its pro6\n\nintroduction\n\ntagonist, a Senegalese woman, Diouana, who decides to move to France to work as a maid. What is evident in this brief sketch of some of the first films made by Africans is not simply their concern with exploring violent social realities, but with the kind of “introspection” by which Frank Ukadike (1994:166) and Olivier Barlet (2000:98) define many contemporary African films. As Ukadike points out, “In the 1970s and 1980s, [African] cinema became more introspective, directed toward addressing contemporary African issues—colonialism and neocolonialism, social and cultural conflicts” (1994:166). Class, religious, and gender exploitation in Africa itself are the concerns of many of the first films made by Africans. This movement in African screen media which preoccupies itself not so much with the colonial past as with the postcolonial failures of Africa, dispenses with stereotyped images of the “evil West” and “victim Africa,” and is one of the criteria for African development detailed by postcolonial theorists such as Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze (1997). This kind of cinematic movement does not ignore the violence of the Atlantic slave trade, the colonial project, and apartheid, or the tremendous suffering of Africans, since this history allows us to understand more profoundly the contemporary, postcolonial forms of violence and oppression that are its legacy. However, this awareness of the past does not restrain filmmakers from searching for solutions to contemporary violence (in Africa and the rest of the world) within Africa itself. In the vein of Burkinabé filmmaker Fanta Régina Nacro’s film La Nuit de la Vérité (2005), which offers an Afrocentric perspective on genocide both in Africa (Rwanda) and Europe (the former Yugoslavia), the filmmakers analyzed here would seem to endorse African agency in contemporary global struggles against violence, and their makers are examples of the possibility of such agency. Rather than argue that postcolonial African film adaptation is merely a response to colonialism and colonial filmmaking, this book claims that the introspection of many contemporary filmmakers is highly progressive in the history of cinematic production in Africa. Whereas many colonial films made in Africa attempted to establish an authenticity for the colonial endeavor by celebrating the courage of white characters who defeat villainous, violent black characters, many of the first African films undermine the very attempt to authenticate identities through self-celebratory measures. The way in which African filmmakers rule out claims to authenticity is not\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nnecessarily derivative of poststructuralist ideas about the death of grand narratives. It has also emerged from Africans’ quotidian experiences and understandings of the cross-cultural interactions that sabotage any attempt at achieving cultural authenticity. Many Africans recognize that precolonial culture cannot simply and purely be recuperated—as Sembene himself says, “I no longer support notions of purity. Purity has become a thing of the past” (1995:176). From the beginnings of African film production, then, many filmmakers show an awareness that—as David Murphy has argued—“there is no ‘authentic’ Africa, nor is there an ‘authentic’ West” (2000b:240). If there is no authentic Africa or African Cinema, it follows that there is no authentic mode or style in which to make African films. Nevertheless, it is impossible to deny the profound interaction of the African arts with the mode of realism. Karin Barber, for example, refers to the “detailed evocations of lifelike ordinary individuals into everyday, recognizable space” in popular Yoruba art, and ultimately asks, “Is the apparent ‘realism’ and the portrayal of everyday life, found right across the continent in the colonial era in visual and verbal arts, a unified phenomenon or do different situations produce different ‘realisms’?” (2000:15). A survey of African films suggests that different situations not only produce different “realisms” but also give rise to a range of genres grounded in the desire to interact with and impact social realities. The majority of early African films tend to work within a traditional social realist mode, inspired in part by the aesthetic mode and political concerns of Soviet social realism, and also comparable with Italian neorealism’s mode of working with existing light and landscapes, nonprofessional actors, and giving preference to long, slow takes with little camera movement. From as early as 1973, however, with the screen explosion of Djibril Diop Mambety’s Touki Bouki, the genre of social realism lost its exclusive purchase on African cinema. Manthia Diawara has made a strong case against the idea of an authentic African film language of any kind, drawing attention to the vast differences among film styles, subjects, and genres throughout Africa (2000:81). This diversity of expression does not mean that it is impossible to find trends. What has fortunately been banished from African film criticism, however, is the previous hitching of authorial ideology to film mode—a practice encouraged by African governments, critics, and filmmakers wishing to prescribe what modes should be used to achieve certain political ends. It is now generally accepted—and it is certainly an argument put forward in 8\n\nintroduction\n\nthis book, which offers analysis of films that are made in a range of styles— that a film need not be made in a realist mode in order to be serious and/or political. As I will show, profound reflections on violence may come in many forms and formats, from social realism to postmodernism, from television drama to cinematic essay. What many African films share, rather than a particular mode, is, first, an engagement with local, contemporary realities in Africa and a desire to respond to these realities. Second, many African filmmakers make creative use of the past for the sake of contemporary audiences. The latter attribute may be symbolized through the image of the Sankofa bird from Akan mythology in present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast. According to Claire Andrade-Watkins, just as the Sankofa bird “flies ahead while looking to the past,” African cinema “marches backwards into the future” (1996a:145). In their recognition of the past as a source—however mediated it may be—the adaptations analyzed here form part of a subgenre of African screen media concerned with history (literary and otherwise). The Malian director Adama Drabo, for example, “describes his role as being ‘to interrogate the past to reflect upon and to forge the present and the future’ ” (Thackway 2003:462). Another Malian director, Cheick Oumar Sissoko, argues that African filmmakers “address the past by referring to what is happening today. That is what you could call a ‘political’ use of this past” (Thackway 2003:40–41). Bickford-Smith and Mendelsohn (2007), in a study of African history on the screen, argue that “many history films [about Africa] use the past to raise questions about the present” (10). According to Mbye Cham, “Since the 1970s many [African films] have drawn on the African past for their film narratives, often as a means of engaging with and ‘historicizing’ the pressing issues of contemporary Africa” (quoted in Bickford-Smith and Mendelsohn 2007:3). The essays on South African cinema in To Change Reels (Balseiro and Masilela 2003) reveal this cinema’s profound concern with history; Melissa Thackway designates an entire branch of Francophone West African films as “memory-history films” (2003); Tomaselli organizes his recent book on South African cinema around Ntongela Masilela’s concept of the “consciousness of precedent” (2006); and Mbye Cham (2004) and Josef Gugler (2004) think through the importance of historical representation in the context of African and Western viewing of African films. I too am concerned here with the way in which African filmmakers approach literary texts and\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nhistorical realities, adapting them so as to “embed” different forms of history in their art. All the films discussed here are connected to one another, then, through their “updating” of literary texts as well as of historical reality itself. It is through their deliberate re-historicization of texts and realities that the filmmakers critique certain forms of past violence as well as explore the provenance of contemporary violence in Africa. This book examines, for example, the way in which a feminist critique of contemporary violence comes about when the first black director to make a feature film in post-apartheid South Africa updates to 1989 a novella set in 1966, at the height of apartheid, about the rape of a black schoolgirl by her black teacher; or the way in which a Senegalese filmmaker and ethnographer reconfigures the racial and sexual anxieties of Mérimée/Bizet’s Carmen by setting the story in the year 2000 in La Maison des Esclaves on the Île de Gorée, a site where slaves were held before their shipment across the Atlantic. I discuss the kinds of meanings that are made out of the source texts and their historical moments in the new contexts. And I closely examine the way that these adaptations are able to rehistoricize violence and thereby engage viewers’ capacity for rational analysis of the multifaceted sociohistorical sources of contemporary violence.\n\nTheories of Film Adaptation Within African film theory, most work on adaptation has focused on the transformation of African oral narratives to the screen (Shehu 1995; Diawara 1996; Thackway 2003:49–92) and not on the adaptation of literature, as Mbye Cham suggests (2005:296). This focus is unsurprising when one considers the importance of oral tales in Africa, and the way in which African film narratives often mimic structures of orality. Nevertheless, recent studies have attempted to show that literature and the written word do have tremendous value to Africans (Barber 2006), and that studies of film adaptation of literature are worthwhile (Tcheuyap 2005). Cham argues that in African cultural studies “the focus has been predominantly on the relationship between the oral and the written” and that “only scant attention” has been given to the imbrication of oral narratives, literature, and film (2005:295). Some of the first African films were adaptations of literature,1 many of Sembene’s films are literary adaptations of his own novels,2 and many African film adapta10\n\nintroduction\n\ntions of oral narratives draw simultaneously on literary texts.3 Furthermore, many African film critics see the project of African writers and filmmakers as fundamentally linked in their joint effort to portray African realities so as to affect and move readers and viewers in particular ways. One can only imagine, then, that the dearth of specific research on African film adaptation of literature is a sign of resistance to the imposition of “Western” theory onto African artistic practices. Alexie Tcheuyap, the first African film critic to write a book-length study on adaptation (2005), follows the only path that seems viable in such a situation: he uses theory against itself. Analyzing adaptation in Africa largely from a poststructuralist perspective, he rejects film adaptation approaches focused on fidelity and medium specificity in favor of a notion of réécriture or a poetics of repetition. Tcheuyap aims to dismantle the deterministic authorial and media-imposed power relations constructed by conventional adaptation theory when he argues that, “The concern is . . . not the subjugation of a medium or a text, but that of the various creative, poetic and ideological processes implied in the repetition that brings change to any rewriting’” (2001:3). Tcheuyap’s definition of repetition is one that incorporates difference and that clearly does not locate itself within discourses, initiated by Benjamin and pursued by Baudrillard, around modernity’s modes of automatic, repetitive production. Like Tcheuyap, I want to examine African adaptation in the context of repetition-with-difference, repetition as a result of human agency rather than the simulacra of technological and industrial machinery. Like Tcheuyap, I grant equivalent status to literature and cinema, to source and secondary (and tertiary) text. However, where Tcheuyap’s focus is on the adaptation of African literature to film, my focus is on the adaptation of literature to African film—the practice and reception of film adaptation in Africa. Tcheuyap’s primary concern is with general film aesthetics, whereas my interest is in teasing out the aesthetics of African cinema. And while Tcheuyap clearly sees film adaptation of African literature as a distinct genre (thereby positioning the project in a Western framework), I attempt to ground African film adaptations of literature within the domain of African screen media, examining the ways in which these adaptations share other African films’ interest in social realities and the re-historicization of the past. Tcheuyap correctly diagnoses the problems of applying conventional film adaptation theory to African screen media. In displaying radical infidelity\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nrather than fidelity to their sources, African adaptations require a broadening of the scope of adaptation theory, which has until recently hinged on the notion of fidelity. Film adaptation theorists have tended to focus on the way in which adaptations are said to either “respect” or “disrupt” the original “meaning” of the literary text, as though this meaning were available in an unmediated way. Drawing attention to the prominence of fidelity as a topic of debate within adaptation studies, Erica Sheen has argued that, “The way adaptations [that are perceived to be “unfaithful”] produce not just animosity, but incoherent animosity, suggests that what is at stake is institutional definitions and identities rather than textual forms and contents” (2000:3). In a theoretical context in which “institutional definitions” are at stake, there would seem to be little place for African film adaptations that employ radical infidelity not as a sign of splendid auteurism (in the manner of the Nouvelle Vague adaptations [Horton and Magretta 1981]), but as part of a sociopolitical project. Beyond film adaptation theory, there are difficulties associated with applying theories of intertextuality derived from poststructuralism and postcolonialism. While Tcheuyap’s poststructuralist perspective establishes equivalence between source text and adaptation, its denial of origins does not allow for an account of the strong sense of authorship displayed by many African filmmakers. And postcolonial theory, which often sees African rewritings of canonical texts as a form of opposition, resistance, or appropriation, cannot explain the nonadversarial way in which the West African directors studied here deal with canonical texts. Nevertheless, two theories of adaptation have proven useful on a heuristic level—performative criticism and Theodor Adorno’s concept of mimesis—in that they aid the conceptualization of a specifically African form of adaptation. For while the new millenium has seen a surge in research on film adaptation,4 little account has been taken of African practices of adaptation, or of postcolonial adaptation more generally (Dovey forthcoming).\n\nFilm Adaptation as Performative Criticism An approach that takes into account the agency of the adapter as well as of the audience in cases of medium change has been articulated around the idea of performative criticism, which Kamilla Lee Denman argues “provides a multifaceted fictional response to a work of fiction that is not only an aes12\n\nintroduction\n\nthetic production but a work of interpretation with layers that can be sensorily, emotionally, psychologically, and intellectually apprehended” (1996:iii). In that film can be seen as a natural extension of the performance arts in Africa, Denman’s stress on the performative aspect of the interpretation offered by, and experienced through, film adaptations is useful. Denman’s performative framework functions in the context of African screen media since the nature of the African filmmaker’s role tends to carry with it a particular relationship to the African spectator—a relationship that could be said to have arisen out of long-established traditions. Many African filmmakers refer to themselves as “screen griots” (Sissoko 2003c:203), claiming a position as the inheritors of the tradition of communal West African oral storytelling and critique.5 Adopting this title, and translating oral stories as well as literary texts to the screen, African filmmakers are able, first of all, to reach non-literate African audiences, and, second, to encourage audiences to react to the cinematic experience in the same way that they would to a griot’s performance of an oral tale—that is, with a critical, modifying eye and not with the absent-minded passivity of spectators expecting to be merely entertained. As modern-day griots, African filmmakers thus play two roles: as the preservers and transmitters of African culture to future generations in the wake of the demise of oral storytelling; and as critical mediators of social realities, encouraging audience response and (re)action. In relation to the latter role, it is important to note that the oral narrative, central to African gnosis, not only involves audience participation but also requires the necessary modification of oral tales by audiences. Teshome Gabriel speaks about the performance of oral narratives in Africa as a “collective effort at mythmaking” (2002:x) that requires the active participation of the audience. As Barber argues in relation to the production and consumption of popular Yoruba plays in Nigeria, the proximity of the producers/actors to the audience means that “production and consumption themselves are often almost indistinguishable” (2000:5). In cultures where art has traditionally been seen as performative, and as requiring audience participation in the construction of this performativity, viewers tend to engage with films in a quite different manner from audiences in the West. Thackway describes how during performances in West Africa audiences play an embodied role—clapping or singing “call-and-response” refrains—and she points out that these “participatory practices” are often\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\ncarried across into film viewing (2003:52). Screenings tend to be accompanied by vibrantly and bodily expressed identification with the characters, a great deal of loud laughter, clapping at moments when the audience supports a character’s decision, and shouting when fortunes are reversed. This active participation is not restricted to West African audiences—as South African director Ramadan Suleman says, “Historically we all know that Africans or Third World people have the tendency, if they like something, to see it two or three times. . . . We have even experienced in movie houses that the audience knows movie dialogues by heart. They memorize; they even tend to talk to the screen characters!” (2002:291). This kind of identification does not necessarily end after the screening. At one point in Senegal, maids and housewives went on “strike” in order to attend repeated screenings of Sembene’s La Noire de . . . (1965). Screenings of Cheick Oumar Sissoko’s film Finzan (1989) caused heated debate in his home country, Mali, around the issue of female circumcision, and, as Sissoko himself says, “this kind of film was very necessary for launching the debate” (2003c:202). Sissoko’s film La Genèse (Genesis) (1999), which he himself screened in rural areas throughout Mali with a mobile film unit, and which deals with interclan violence, also initiated important discussion between stockbreeders (l’éleveurs) and agriculturalists (cultivateurs). While I have drawn on personal interviews with filmmakers, writers, and actors to try to reconstruct the reception of the films analyzed here, there is unfortunately a dearth of information that restricts me from fully activating the performative criticism of audiences themselves.6 One hopes that the work currently being undertaken by media ethnographers in examining the “social lives” of films as well as their textual aspects will help to bring the disciplines of anthropology and film studies into even more productive association in the future (Ginsburg et al. 2002; Askew and Wilk 2002). Although empirical research remains scant, it is possible to analyze, from a textual perspective, the impact of performativity on the form and aesthetics of African screen media. Although the filmmaker is, of course, not present in bodily form in a film, many techniques are used so as to mimic the presence of the filmmaker/griot, including the use of voice-over, opening and closing the film with a griot, or having the filmmaker act in the film. Lack of access to funding also tends to result in a mode of production that, while determined to some extent by the inevitably collective nature of any 14\n\nintroduction\n\nfilm production, bears the strong imprint of the director, who is often compelled to take on more than one role—sometimes as writer, director, producer, editor, and actor. This means that the authorial role in African films is more marked than in Hollywood films, for example, where specialization results in hierarchies of expertise. This form of authorship in African films is not oppositional, as was auteur cinema in Europe, but can be seen as an extension of social and artistic responsibility, a role articulated by DRC filmmaker Mweze Ngangura as follows: “in Africa, for many years now almost all filmmakers have regarded themselves as authors, as people with a mission, charged with carrying a message to their people” (1996:61). In this respect, African films share aspects of what Hamid Naficy (2001) calls exilic films—cinema made by exiles, émigrés, immigrants, and diasporic peoples who foreground their own authorial presence in their films. In an attempt to “put the locatedness and the historicity of the authors back into authorship” (34), Naficy challenges poststructuralist theory to rethink its denial of authorship and origins and to take account not only of the meanings assigned to films by spectators but also by authors, arguing that both authors and spectators are simultaneously “subjects of texts” and “subjects in history” (34). Like Ngangura, he sees film authors not as autonomous artists distinct from sociocultural contexts, as auteur theory tends to do, but as everyday men and women, both constituted by and critical of their environments. This challenge to poststructuralist theory has also been undertaken by recent postcolonial theorists such as Neil Lazarus, who argues that rather than seeing Eurocentrism as a monolithic episteme, we might see it as an ideological formation and thus as capable of critique by individual authors (2004:11–12). In drawing extensively on my interviews with African filmmakers, writers, and actors, I too intend to take human desire and intention seriously, thereby challenging the poststructuralist denial of authorship. Holding to Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding dialectic (1973), and to Karin Barber’s recognition that in many cases it is impossible to separate production and consumption in Africa, I see author and audience as two sides of the same coin. Furthermore, Barlet has warned us not to see the “African audience” as an indivisible collective, but as heterogeneous, as comprised of individuals. The project of reinstating the importance of authorship as well as spectatorship thus inevitably involves recognition of the role not only of the collective in Africa but also of the individual, something which might\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\nhelp us to move away from reductive oppositions of Africa’s “communalism” to the West’s “individualism.” As Barber writes of the Adédjobí Theatre Company’s Yoruba plays, A close look at the texts of these plays enables us to explore what kind “modern self ” [sic] is in fact projected, and how individuality, autonomy, and agency are conceptualized. . . . The bipolar before-and-after narrative of modernity that traces the emergence of the universal, individualistic, autonomous, post-Enlightenment “modern self ” from its particularistic, communalistic, tradition-bound antecedents is called into question by these representations. (2000:13)\n\nSimilarly, scrutiny of the South African and West African film adaptations in the chapters that follow reveals the films’ profound engagement with discourses around the limits of both individuality and communalism in Africa, showing that it is impossible to simplistically hold Africa to collective principles of ujamaa, unhu, or ubuntu without taking into account its dynamic redefinition of modern subjectivities. In summary, then, the recuperation of authorship as well as of spectatorship enables the possibility of performance and criticism, two concepts that are central to the claims of this book. In light of these claims, it seems important also to explore a paradigm of adaptation that devises a theory of critique while challenging the possibility of critique under certain sociocultural circumstances: Theodor Adorno’s concept of mimesis.\n\nFilm Adaptation as Adornian Mimesis The idea of performance suggests an embodied investment in film by both authors and audience, but it does not address the question of where rationality fits into the picture. Theodor Adorno’s concept of mimesis is useful to this study in that it marries the concepts of embodied and rational modes of being and sees this marriage as a prerequisite of critique. Mimesis, of course, has a long history, predating Adorno’s adoption and amplification of the concept. While it is not my interest to engage with this history here, it is important to point out that mimesis has primarily been conceived of in two ways. One form of mimesis has its origins in embodiment—in bodily mimicry—and the other in Plato’s idea of mimesis as imitation. The philoso16\n\nintroduction\n\nphy of history offered in The Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), which Adorno coauthored with Max Horkheimer, traces in a fragmentary, nonlinear way how, through the Enlightenment in the West, humans attempted to distance themselves as much as possible from mimesis as an embodied mode of being (often associated with mime and dance, and with Africa) in the pursuit of “civilized culture,” or rational modes of being. Adorno and Horkheimer argue that in the process of attempting to reject embodied modes of being, these modes are inevitably manifested within Western rationality itself. This sense of a dialectic is expressed in the two frequently cited assertions from The Dialectic of Enlightenment: “myth is already enlightenment; and enlightenment reverts to mythology” (Horkheimer and Adorno 1973:xvi). This statement seeks to acknowledge that magic and myth are already forms of cognition, of knowledge. The second thesis, that enlightenment reverts to myth, is explained by the way in which a totalizing rationality, such as that experienced in late modernity (according to Adorno), produces a complete reification of the world and assumes that it is the sole means to the truth, and thus inevitably becomes a myth (and incapable of offering critique) in that it fails to recognize its own contingency. Adorno thus seeks to locate embodiment and rationality within a continuum or constellation, with no dichotomy between them—they do not constitute a binary opposition. As soon as rationality denies the bodily, it loses its truth-value; at the same time, as soon as the bodily suppresses rationality, it forfeits its meaning-making power. Many contemporary film and literary theorists appear to be in the process of critiquing the validation of the rational over the bodily that has dominated post-Enlightenment “Western” thought, through a new focus on the sensory and on embodied modes of being and viewing/reading.7 Many African filmmakers, including those studied here, seem to be engaged in the opposite process: they are using the hyper-embodied medium of film to project their own versions of rationality into their films. The Cameroonian filmmaker Jean-Pierre Bekolo has said that he uses a great deal of voice-over in his films since he “was once told that no one ever hears what Africans say or what they think. And by extension such a statement would seem to suggest that Africans don’t think at all” (2000:25). Similarly, El Hadj, the protagonist in Alain Gomis’s film L’Afrance (2001), tells his white French lover who asks him if French attitudes to African immigrants have changed: “They used to say, all that Africans know how to do is play the drums; now they say, wow,\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nAfricans all have such great rhythm!” In both cases, Africans are confined to the bodily, to the “natural” or “pre-rational.” The heightened embodiment of which the film medium is capable cannot, therefore, simply be celebrated in Africa, a continent where imperialism was justified through the very polarization of European “rationality” and African “embodiment.” Rather than merely succumbing to a position of resistance, through consistently asserting African rationality over embodiment, the filmmakers discussed here maintain the necessary dialectic intrinsic to Adorno’s concept of mimesis. Furthermore, their films, as well as those of other African filmmakers, often move beyond the simplistic opposition of rationality and embodiment altogether to explore competing rationalities.8 In this sense, rather than countering the “embodiment” through which European colonialists tended to classify Africans, these filmmakers would appear to be drawing positively on Afrophone philosophies which present complex, multilayered definitions of “knowledge,” “belief ,” and “truth,” and which equate “being human” with “having knowledge,” with rationality (Dzobo 1992; Hallen and Sodipo 1997).9 Grounded in mimicry, Adorno’s mimesis allows for the possibility of a different kind of relationship between subject and object—an adaptive or correlating behavior in which the subject attempts to be like the object, rather than control the object by identifying it. Correlating behavior, according to Adorno, allows the subject to appreciate the object’s full, embodied materiality—through “sensuous knowing” or “sensuous Othering”—rather than classify the object through rational(izing) thought. It allows for identification with the object/Other (an embodied mode of being), rather than identification of the object/Other through the reifications of abstract thought. The films studied here harness embodiment by adapting to their objects— the literary texts, historical realities, and violence—in a way that “mimics” them, that approaches them closely rather than attempting to dominate or control them as do the rational discourses of academic disciplines. However, the films also access rationality through their complex re-historicization of the discourses of the literary texts and the historical moments in which they were made. If, as I have claimed, African film adaptations operate in the manner of Adornian mimesis, it is important to examine Adorno’s proposition that mimesis as critique is contingent on context. According to Adorno, 18\n\nintroduction\n\nunder the conditions of modernity and mass culture, mimesis as “a cognitive attempt to be like the object, is . . . progressively replaced by identification, thought’s attempt to subsume and classify the object” (Jarvis 1998:27). Mimesis becomes almost entirely repressed, as a result of the instrumentalization of reason, and it becomes confined to the “irrational” or “a-rational” language of art, which is increasingly viewed as separate from the rational language of science. Thus mimesis in art becomes reduced to the irrational, with the subject mimicking the object but denied the ability to offer any valid kind of knowledge of it. The classificatory mode of modern rationality, on the other hand, is faced with the dilemma of reducing the object or Other to pure concept, eliminating all embodied experience of it or affinity to it, which would seem to also invalidate the knowledge or critique thereby produced since it is not felt. For Adorno, cinema produced and received under the conditions of the “mass culture industry” exploits mimesis as both adaptation and imitation for its own manipulative ends. In his view, film cannot offer a critique of society precisely because of its mimetic qualities. Thus, on the one hand, because film can produce near-perfect imitations of empirical reality, “Reality becomes its own ideology through the spell cast by its faithful duplication” and “Imagination is replaced by a mechanically relentless control mechanism which determines whether the latest imago to be distributed really represents an exact, accurate and reliable reflection of the relevant item of reality” (Adorno 1991:55). On the other hand, “the sensuous individuation of the work,” which might be the means for avoiding the abstraction of identity-thinking, merely “contradicts the abstractness and self-sameness to which the world has shrunk.” This is the source of Adorno’s criticism of the cinema as medium, which leads him to make statements such as “Every visit to the cinema leaves me, against all my vigilance, stupider and worse” (1978:25). In the context of late modernity, according to Adorno, mimesis is able to offer critique of a totalizing instrumental reason only through the “determinate negation” of society, in the form of nonrepresentational modernist art’s mimicking of rationality itself. Adorno paints a picture of cinema as a medium not able, under late modernist Western conditions, to bring together the embodied and rational capacities necessary for mimesis as critique. As Michael Cahn has pointed out, Adorno thus associates modernity with a crisis of critique, and the\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\nquestion that arises is how a critique of violence is to be achieved, since critique “has to demonstrate its relevance by an involvement and similarity with what it criticizes” (1984:46). The identity-thinking of instrumental rationality, approaching the object via the abstraction of general concepts, cannot know the object in its embodied particularity, and it is mimicry which provides the means for approaching the object closely enough in order to be able to know it. Because art is the domain in which the body has not been entirely repressed, it seems to offer the means for critique, but, for Adorno, the risk is that, through its capacity to “be like” the world, art may simply work as an advertisement for the world. The most is at stake in art that deals with violence since this art risks producing an affirmation of violence by mimicking it. In Adorno’s schema, cinema within a totalizing social order is able to exploit the power of mimicry, turning citizens into automatons capable of the excesses of violence witnessed in the last century. According to Adorno, the spectacular mass displays of Nazi Germany and the mass media of the American culture industry constitute technologies of the visual that have been harnessed in the service of violent manipulation and control. While Adorno’s own totalizing claims contradict his dialectical argument, and result in a reduction of the differences inherent in the “West,” it is possible to argue—again, without wanting to essentialize “Africa”—that the very different relationship to screen media (and art of all kinds) in many African contexts enables rather than undermines critique through film. The active, embodied, and performative responses of many film audiences in Africa, as well as the difficulties associated with access to certain kinds of cinema in Africa (and particularly the kind of films discussed here), suggest that while film may be part of popular culture, it cannot be considered part of mass culture. Barber provides a resounding critique of generalized theories of the culture industry through her reference to popular culture in West Africa: Especially incongruous to popular culture in West Africa are those theories that assume a radical separation between production (by cosmopolitan technocratic elites) and consumption (by local masses), and which imagine these masses being unilaterally transformed by their exposure to the flow of internationally generated images. Local, small-scale West African producers are socially and physically close to their consumers, sharing much the same social experience and outlook. (2000:5)\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\nEven the thriving video film industries of Nigeria, and increasingly of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, cannot be described as initiating or participating in “mass culture” given the obstacles that filmmakers working in these industries face on a daily basis, including electricity failures, delays due to religious customs (such as the muezzin’s call for Muslims to pray), and piracy (meaning that it is difficult for producers to recuperate their costs) (This Is Nollywood [film, 2007] ). For my purposes, then, what is most significant is that it is possible to construct an idea of a critical branch of African screen media, since although African films can of course not be located wholly outside of a culture industry, they can be located within a public sphere that is characterized by closeness rather than the distance that has been associated with mass culture since Walter Benjamin’s famous first words on the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction (1935). This allows for a recuperation of the intentionality of both filmmaker and viewer, and it also enables a particular kind of engagement of filmmakers with their subject matter, and of viewers with the images on the screen, a relationship that makes critique possible. ■\n\n■\n\n■\n\n■\n\n■\n\nI have thus far made claims that African film adaptations offer performative criticism, and operate in the manner of Adornian mimesis. There are, however, three serious problems associated with the critique manifest in African film adaptations of literature that it is important to address. All three problems are related to the idea that the success of critique through film is dependent on its absorption by the audiences at whom it is aimed. The first problem is that many audiences in Africa are non-literate and will not have read the literary texts that the films adapt. In all sub-Saharan African countries, except the Seychelles, the non-literacy rate is more than 10 percent, and it is as high as 70 percent in many West African nations. While many Africans would have an oral knowledge of certain texts discussed here (such as the Book of Genesis) that can be said to substitute for having read them, in many cases it is unlikely that people will know the texts intimately. The criticism offered specifically through the literary adaptation process, then, is only accessible to those who are literate and who have access to the texts. The second, more fundamental problem has to do with the fact that it is very difficult to see the kind of African films discussed here in Africa. At\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nthe 2007 New York African Film Festival the Cameroonian documentary maker, Jean-Marie Teno, said: “I am sick of the question, who are you making your films for? American filmmakers never get asked this question.” If certain kinds of African films are not reaching the African public, however, the question of audience is a vital one, and it is impossible for African filmmakers and African film critics to disengage from it. The popularity and accessibility of films made in “Nollywood” (in southern Nigeria), “Kanywood” (in northern Nigeria), “Riverwood” (in Kenya), and “Bongowood” (in Tanzania), to name only a few of Africa’s booming video film industries, suggest that it is not impossible for African films to reach African audiences. It is difficult to reconcile the critical achievements of the filmmakers analyzed here with the rise of low-budget video filmmaking and its attendant entertainment or “showbiz” industries. The latter has rendered obsolete the arguments around whether culture (and particularly the relatively expensive practice of filmmaking) should be sidelined while African governments attempt to deal with the urgent issues of food, housing, and job creation. People are no longer relying on inept state structures to produce and consume their culture: they are doing it themselves. If the condition for a film being considered “African” is its accessibility to an African audience, then video films are more supremely part of “African screen media” than the films analyzed here. However, the nature of critique offered by such video films has been at issue. Nigerian filmmakers and historians such as Afolabi Adesanya and Wole Ogundele, and African film critic Kenneth Harrow, are deeply troubled by the commercial nature of the video industry and what it means for “serious” and critical African art. Alternatively, anthropologists such as Brian Larkin and Birgit Meyer express excitement at the local and global access to audiovisual media for Africans created through the video industries. What remains disturbing is the relative lack of research and discussion about the forms and functions of the video films. The general euphoria that Africans are producing and consuming their own films runs the risk of compromising important debate on the content and critique of such African films. While certain video filmmakers, such as Tunde Kelani and Ladi Ladebo in Nigeria and Bob Nyanja in Kenya, have adopted a critical voice, raising important issues around African art, ethnicity, and HIV/AIDS, other video filmmakers trade in the genres of horror, magic, and melodrama and often exhibit themes of 22\n\nintroduction\n\nvengeance in order to make money (Adesanya 1997:14). While such films may include social and political critique (Haynes 2006; Dovey 2007a), their chief difference from the films discussed here (and many other African films made on celluloid) is related to their representations of violence: whereas the films under analysis here offer a critique particularly of retributive violence, video films tend to affirm such violence in lieu of exploring restorative, nonviolent means of resolving social and political problems. While we cannot deny the importance and promise that video film holds in terms of addressing the crisis of representation in African societies, we also cannot refrain from analyzing the critique offered by all African films, regardless of the format in which they are made. In particular, given the beleaguered state of the entire globe in terms of “terrorism” of all kinds, state-sanctioned violence, wars, and violence against women and children, it would appear to be vital for African filmmakers not to renounce the position they have taken up in critiquing violence. Ogunleye refers to “criticisms about the amount of blood, debauchery and violence (both physical and spiritual), witnessed on African video screens” (2003:x). While one would not want to prescribe to African filmmakers what kinds of films they and audiences should make and watch, it is vital that an intellectual community explores and debates the iconographies and impact of African films. Specifically, the iconography of any commercial cinema (in Africa and elsewhere) must be analyzed, for, as one critic points out: An indigenous popular cinema will inevitably transmit and reinforce the priorities and beliefs of the society that finances it. An art cinema based in essentially nonprofit filmmaking, on the other hand, can risk interrogating that society’s values and suggesting alternatives. Nigerian cinema may soon face the same problem confronted by the U.S.: how to nurture and finance a noncommercial cinema, which can act as a critique and complement to its commercial counterpart. (California Newsreel 2000)\n\nThe question, then, is not of competing alternatives, of whether to choose commercial video production over critical filmmaking. It is of how to allow both forms of filmmaking to flourish and to inform and develop one another. Acknowledgment of the possibility of coevalness might shift African film criticism beyond the impasse that has recently arisen over the incommen-\n\nintroduction\n\n23\n\nsurability of the overtly commercial aims of certain filmmakers and the relatively noncommercial aims of others. On the one hand, Mweze Ngangura argues that African filmmakers can best contribute to social change through an entertainment cinema (1996). On the other hand, Clyde Taylor argues that the “desideratum of enlightenment will inevitably draw rejection from those who favour a commercial orientation. Much of the discussion among the builders of African cinema revolves around developing distribution and creating an industry: but the development of an industry could be the worst thing for the more profound social possibilities of African cinema” (2000:144). Taylor cautions critics against reifying African audiences, against assuming that “commercialised African audiences will be more resistant to trash and glitter than other societies” (ibid.). At FESPACO 2007, there was a strong consensus that everyone involved in African film has to work, in the future, toward bridging the gap between critical African films and the African public so that their critique may be fully activated for development purposes: whether this means evolving new popular forms of film that will appeal more to local, African audiences; making more films in African languages; harnessing the democratization process that has been opened up by new technologies; creating coproduction treaties between African nations; showing African films on television; or through creating alternate distribution and exhibition strategies. In order to acknowledge the importance of African films reaching an African public for their critique to be fulfilled, I address specific issues of audience in the historical introductions to South African and Francophone West African film, respectively. The third problem associated with the critique offered by African film adaptations of literature is as much a problem as it is proof that such films are necessary in Africa. If, according to Adorno, mimesis in a situation of late modernity in the “West” is virtually impossible given the reification of instrumental rationality at the expense of embodiment, one might similarly argue that mimesis in a situation of postcoloniality in Africa is virtually impossible given the damaging fissure of African minds (consciousness) from bodies, as described by Fanon (1967) and Steve Biko (1979). To both Fanon and Biko, writing long before Ngugi wã Th’iongo’s Decolonization of the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature (1986), the true tragedy of colonialism was its effect not so much on the body as on the psyche 24\n\nintroduction\n\nor consciousness of the colonized. To Fanon, racism results in an emphasis on the skin color of a victim to the extent that the victim can think of nothing other than his/her skin color—his/her mind becomes preoccupied with the body/skin. Similarly, according to Biko, the minds of black South Africans were the prime weapons in the hands of the apartheid government in South Africa, and he argues that, “Material want is bad enough, but coupled with spiritual poverty it kills” (1979:28). Reconstituting an effortless dialectic between mind and body was one of the aims of Fanon’s psychiatric work at Blida-Joinville in Algeria in the 1950s as well as of Biko’s Black Consciousness movement of the 1970s. Both notably involved the movement from group solidarity toward a resurrection of the importance of the individual. As Biko writes: “The philosophy of Black Consciousness . . . expresses group pride and the determination by the blacks to rise and attain the envisaged self ” (1979:68; my emphasis). The typical process of production and reception of fiction films—made by a collective but with a focus on individual protagonists, watched by a collective but ultimately stored within the minds of individual viewers—mirrors Fanon’s and Biko’s work and philosophies. The fact that contemporary African film adapters of literature are themselves engaging in mimesis—in the reconnection of rationality and embodiment—would then imply a process of healing, of overcoming the fracturing of selves, of mind from body, caused by colonialism. Biko is particularly relevant to this study in that rather than advocating a focus on the enemy’s violence, and on retaliatory violence, which is another way of playing by the oppressor’s rules, he called for an increased consciousness of African lives and realities.\n\nAfrican Screen Media, Mimicry, and Violence The main question that this book seeks to explore, then, is how African fiction filmmakers are representing and critiquing contemporary violence (murder, war, genocide, rape) that continues to ravage the African continent. Debate persists on whether the Western media exaggerates violence in Africa (Harding 2003a, 2003b, 2003c) or portrays it accurately (Schwab 2001:3–4). Those who believe that Africa is a particularly war-torn continent tend to cite the many military coups d’état that have occurred—in 1963 (Togo), 1966 (Nigeria, Ghana, Central African Republic), 1967 (Sierra Leone), and 1968 (Mali)—as well as the civil wars that took place throughout\n\nintroduction\n\n25\n\nthe 1990s (in Angola, DRC Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Burundi, and Rwanda) and are currently ongoing (in Sudan, Somalia, Chad, and DRC, among other countries). They reference apartheid in South Africa, and the dictatorships of Idi Amin in Uganda and, more recently, of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. While it is not my purpose to enter the academic fray about the magnitude of violence in Africa compared to other regions of the world, or how culpable the Western media is in (re)producing it, what is useful to my study is the consensus among political theorists that contemporary violence in Africa is characterized by intrastate rather than interstate conflict. Such recognition strongly suggests that much of the large-scale violence in contemporary Africa is not inherent to the continent, but is a product of the imaginary, volatile nations into which it was sliced during the 1884–85 Berlin Conference. Similarly, in that I approach the topic of violence through African films that re-historicize earlier situations of violence, I reject claims that Africa is in the process of “self-destructing,” as Schwab suggests in the title of his book (2001; my emphasis). Instead, I align myself with scholars who have taken the long view of history in Africa and analyzed the ways in which postcolonial violence is a metonymic displacement of colonial and other kinds of violence.10 At the same time, I try to avoid the one-dimensional view that all of Africa’s contemporary problems are a result of colonialism and apartheid, a view that patronizes Africans by assuming that they have no agency. As one international relations scholar puts it, “African wars, as with wars elsewhere, can never be attributed to a singular explanatory variable” (Bøås 2003: 43). Since I favor an approach that takes account of agency, I am concerned with how Africans themselves are responding to and representing violence of all kinds, including bodily (for example, murder or rape) and psychic/systemic violence (for example, colonial and institutional state violence). Cinematic representation of violence has been prominent in films made across the continent in the past decade, and the question of violence took center-stage at FESPACO 2007, as attested to in FESPACO 2007’s special bulletin on “Violence et cinema africain” (AfriCiné). In the brief section that follows, I want to address the relationship of colonial Africa and violence as a way of contextualizing the discussion of contemporary African representations of violence in subsequent chapters. Anthropologist Michael Taussig describes “the violence of the twentieth26\n\nintroduction\n\ncentury colonial frontier” in terms of the “mimicry by the colonizer of the savagery imputed to the savage” (1993:66). Taussig’s account of the physical violence of colonial encounters is the counterpart to Homi Bhabha’s notion of colonial mimicry as a form of discursive violence. Bhabha’s concept of mimicry was inspired by Fanon’s recognition in Black Skin, White Masks of the way in which colonialism bred mimicry by the colonized of the colonizers. Unlike Fanon, however, Bhabha is less interested in exploring the schizophrenic fissures with which colonialism disrupts the psyche and body of the colonized, and more interested in the schizophrenia of the colonizers as figured through colonial discourse. Fanon argues that “the European has a fixed concept of the Negro” (1967: 35)—that is, an essentially racist, dehumanizing concept. Bhabha counteracts this statement by saying that this fixed concept is actually not as fixed as it initially seems to be. To Bhabha this fixed concept emerges out of a long history and tradition of “civil” discourse, in which a stereotype of the black African is anxiously repeated. The repetition of this fixed concept or stereotype becomes a form of mimicry that represents an ambivalence, a shifting in the Western psyche between fear and desire of the black colonial subject. Bhabha thus argues that “the stereotype . . . is a form of knowledge and identification that vacillates between what is always ‘in place,’ already known, and something that must be anxiously repeated . . . as if the essential duplicity of the Asiatic or the bestial sexual license of the African that needs no proof, can never really, in discourse, be proved” (1994:94–95). This anxious repetition or mimicry, Bhabha claims, leads to ambivalence in the colonial text, thereby inauthenticating its supposed objectivity. It is this colonial mimicry that I want to trace in relation to the introduction of cinema into Africa. I hope to show how remarkable it is that certain African filmmakers have rejected a similar form of mimicry in their films and have instead embraced a form of (Adornian) mimesis that critiques violence. In Africa there was no gradual exposure to new technological developments at the end of the nineteenth century, no Thomas Edison inventing electric light, no George Eastman developing celluloid, no Étienne-Jules Marey brandishing his photographic gun. Nor was there regular entertainment of the kind Georges Méliès provided to French crowds with his magic lanterns, the forerunners of our modern cinemas. There was no Théâtre Optique, no Muybridge’s Horse, no Lumière brothers. Although Cinemato-\n\nintroduction\n\n27\n\ngraph screenings were given in a number of different African countries from 1895 onwards, these screenings were generally reserved for “elite” residents (usually white male civil servants), meaning that most Africans were not made aware of cinema’s existence until well into the twentieth century. Cinema came hand in hand with brutal colonization, and with patronizing and racist censorship and exhibition policies. The British, Belgian, Portuguese, and French colonizing authorities largely used cinema in an attempt to perpetuate the idea that Africans (and black people in general) were an inferior and violent race that required taming and civilizing. Films were made about Africa by European and North American filmmakers, who turned Africa into a savage, fabricated backdrop peopled by violent tribes with heathen rituals, against whom white heroes had to fight for “civilization.”11 As Robert Stam and Ella Shohat point out, these films, when shown in Africa, had “complex ramifications for spectatorship,” so that “some of the major figures articulating anticolonial and postcolonial discourse symptomatically return in their writing to colonial spectatorship as a kind of primal scene.” Stam and Shohat speak of “spectatorial schizophrenia,” given that black Africans were made to identify with white heroes while rejecting the “barbaric” Africans depicted in the films. In this way, they argue, colonial filmmaking in Africa initiated a particular mode of “black” reception (2000:386), a mode of spectatorship that has been analyzed in depth by Manthia Diawara (1988). Films were also made specifically for African audiences as early as the mid-1920s, when colonial film units were set up in various African countries—predominantly those colonized by the British and Belgians—for educational and propaganda purposes. Some films were made with a very limited form of collaboration between Africans and the colonizing powers, as in the case of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment, conducted from 1935 to 1937 in British East Africa, but the organizers’ patronizing and essentially exploitative attitude toward Africans is evident throughout their report. Of the belief that Africans were “unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood” (Notcutt and Latham 1937:23) and that it would have been dangerous to show them “harmful films” (22), the organizers made films to “educate” Africans as to why they should pay their taxes, save their money in banks, cultivate and drink tea and coffee, and trust Western medical technology more than their own natural healers (30–73). These films, based on 28\n\nintroduction\n\nthe assumption that the black races were by nature violent and in need of instruction and civilization, were also insidious advertisements for European products, designed to make Africans dependent on Europe and its new modern technologies. This “cinema in Africa,” then, was a method of control and modernization, a further means for subjecting Africans to the legal, bureaucratic, commercial, and scientific forms of organization of the colonizing powers. Films made about Africa and Africans, and films made for and shown to Africans, shared an assumption that Africans were inherently violent. One could argue, then, that colonial film production and exhibition were symptomatic of the colonial process as a whole. The “savagery imputed to the savage” in the earliest films made and shown in Africa is evident at every turn. It is of great interest, given the violence of colonization justified through the assumed violence of the colonized, that many of the first films made by Africans were fundamentally opposed to retaliatory violence. While, as Mbye Cham has noted, African cinema is no doubt a “child of political independence” (1996:1), its birth as a political cinema in a critical rather than revolutionary sense has not been adequately addressed. The development of African screen media—if confined to production by sub-Saharan Africans—began only in the 1950s, concurrently with the decolonization struggle and the advent of independence in many African nations, and its genesis as a politicized art form was, in part, a reaction to colonial cinema and ethnographic filmmaking in Africa.12 However, the overtly political origins of African screen media can be distinguished from a preexisting political cinematic practice and discourse—that of Third Cinema, a term coined by the Argentinean filmmakers Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, who in 1969 published their groundbreaking manifesto, “Towards a Third Cinema.” In their manifesto, Solanas and Getino reject what they call “First Cinema,” constituted primarily of seamlessly constructed illusionistic Hollywood movies, which, they argue, situate the viewer as “a consumer of ideology, and not as the creator of ideology” (1969:51), and propose Third Cinema as an alternative to “Second Cinema,” which they see as failing in its challenge to First Cinema.13 Solanas and Getino’s work was strongly influenced by the ideas of European thinkers such as Marx and Gramsci, and by anticolonial theorists such as Fanon and Cabral, and particularly by their theorizing of revolutionary or\n\nintroduction\n\n29\n\nproletariat violence (Fanon 1983; Cabral 1973). Fanon, as I have mentioned, was one of the first to address the imitative nature of colonial encounters. In The Wretched of the Earth, the first edition of which was prefaced by JeanPaul Sartre, Fanon urged colonized peoples to give up their “nauseating mimicry” (quoted in Sartre 1983:8) of the European colonists, who attempted to “white-wash” (Sartre 7) their subjects. Fanon did encourage mimicry on one front, however, urging colonized peoples to mimic the colonizers’ violence, and thereby transform it into revolutionary violence (Fanon 1983:28). This is the kind of violence that so-called “Third filmmakers” attempted to promote through their films. Solanas and Getino insist, throughout their manifesto, on filmmaking as a “guerilla activity,” the camera as the “inexhaustible expropriator of image-weapons” (58) and the projector as a “gun that can shoot 24 frames per second ”(58). They argue that Third Cinema should incite its viewers to action, that the film is “important only as a detonator or pretext” (62), and that Third filmmakers should “insert the work as an original fact in the process of liberation, place it first at the service of life itself, ahead of art” (50). Film screenings in Latin America provoked demonstrations and debates, and were used for the education of militant cadres in the 1960s and, owing to the threat of government reprisal, these screenings were often guarded by armed revolutionaries (Gabriel 1982:19). While emphasizing action rather than a change in consciousness, Solanas and Getino did argue that Third Cinema must effect the “decolonization of culture” (47), not only on the front of colonialism but also on that of neocolonialism. This early recognition of the centrality of culture in the development of Third World countries was taken up and endorsed by African filmmakers, and is particularly evident in those manifestos created at film festivals in Algiers in 1973 and 1975, Niamey in 1982, Harare in 1990, and Ouagadougou in 1991—manifestos that represent the first stirrings of a theory of “African Cinema” (Bakari and Cham 1996:17–36). Teshome Gabriel, however, allows us to pinpoint a key difference between Third Cinema and African Cinema in a way that other Third Cinema theorists, such as Roy Armes (1987), do not. Introducing the work of the Senegalese writer and filmmaker Ousmane Sembene, Gabriel argues that the so-called “Father of African Cinema” can be distinguished from Third filmmakers in that he views film as a political rather than a revolutionary medium (1982:22). According to Sembene,\n\n30\n\nintroduction\n\nIt’s not after having read Marx or Lenin that you go out and make a revolution. . . . All the works are just a point of reference in history. And that’s all. Before the end of an act of creation society usually has already surpassed it. . . . The role of the artist is to denounce what he sees wrong in society [. . . but] to give solutions escapes the artist. (Quoted in Gabriel 1982:22)\n\nThroughout his career, Sembene showed an interest in the consciousnessraising of his people, but not in inciting physical violence of any kind. His use of cinema to critique, summon reflection, or forewarn reveals his belief in the medium’s critical potential. I would argue, then, that instead of seeing Sembene as a father figure simply because he was the first black sub-Saharan African to make a feature-length film, or because of what some film critics identify as his pioneering of the mode of social realism in Africa (Pfaff 1984), he deserves this title for also being the exemplar and inspiration of an African cinematic mode that concerns itself with critical awareness rather than with revolutionary action.14 An appreciation for the critical nature of Sembene’s films—although not directly addressed in this book—therefore informs my discussions of the work of other African directors. What is most significant in this brief history of the cinema in Africa and the emergence of African film is the violence with which cinema was implemented in African contexts, and the choice that many African filmmakers have made to reject such violence and instead adopt a point of view that offers a critique of violence. Malian film critic Moussa Bolly argues that contemporary directors from Chad, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia “are exploring ways of breaking the cycles of violence in which Africa is plunged. A violence which, according to them, can never be the solution to the problems of Africans” (2007:1).15 As I have emphasized, by focusing on the ways in which violence is critiqued in African films, my view is not that violence is a staple of African cinema. Such a suggestion would fuel the erroneous image of Africa, perpetuated in much Western media, as inherently violent (Harding 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). On the contrary, I posit that by historicizing violence through the adaptation process, African filmmakers are problematizing representations of Africa as inherently violent. At the same time, we cannot deny that many millions of people in Africa\n\nintroduction\n\n31\n\ndo have intimate experience of different forms of violence, which means that even more is at stake in the specific representation of violence in this context. At the current time, when violence—although not inherent—is endemic in many African countries, and cannot simply be ignored, it seems important to ask how violence is to be dealt with in literature and film. Referring to the torture of prisoners in South Africa during apartheid, J. M. Coetzee talks about the way that writers are drawn to the torture room, pointing out that “there is something tawdry about following the state in this way, making its vile mysteries the occasion of fantasy. For the writer the deeper problem is not to allow himself to be impaled on the dilemma proposed by the state, namely, either to ignore its obscenities or else to produce representations of them” (1986:364). The dilemma is similar in relation to other forms of violence, too, and the question arises as to whether film as medium is, on the one hand, able to represent violence in a way that does not appeal to the fantasies of the viewer as voyeur, and, on the other hand, whether film as medium is able to achieve a critique of violence in a wa"
