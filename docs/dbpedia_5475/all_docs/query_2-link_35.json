Established by Oxford University Press in 1962 and continuing until 1976, it was the vehicle for the international publication of Wole Soyinka and Athol Fugard as well as Lewis Nkosi, John Pepper Clark, Obi Egbuna, Oswald Mtshali, Joe de Graft and Leopold SÃ©dar Senghor, amongst other African writers. Although small, controversial, financially unsuccessful and short lived, the series provides a unique insight into the process of postcolonial literary production and transnational cultural relations."
