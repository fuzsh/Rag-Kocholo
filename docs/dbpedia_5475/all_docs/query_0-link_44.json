Ransom Center GALLERIES austinchranicle.com I SEPTEMBER 7, 2007 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I 5 PAGE TWO Wild and Delirious A columnist's lament, by way of some favorite cultural touchstones BY LOUIS BLACK Years back, I was lucky enough to spend time hanging out with the king of softcore filmmaking, Russ Meyer ( Faster ; Pussycat ! Kill! Kill; Beyond the Valley of the Dolls; Vixen). Film Comment ran an interview with him by Ed Lowry and me; I talked to him for the Chronicle; there were also times when we just hung out. Meyer would talk about anything, in detail, whether you asked or not - includ- ing his sex life and his thoughts on the dif- ferent women he had known (unfortunately, it frequently included elaboration on exactly how he had known them, as well). When Meyer talked about folks he had worked with, there was a crucial way in which they were valued. Talking about a cinematographer he had worked with only once, he basically dismissed their entire rela- tionship by saying, “He didn’t get my joke.” Praising someone he had worked with for years, almost proudly, Meyer noted, “He got the joke.” The joke, of course, isn’t a simple knock- knock joke nor a comedian’s routine. It really doesn’t center on whether something is funny or not. That’s a small part of it, but the way that Meyer said “joke” made it clear he was talking about much more - something to do with codes by which we live, accented by one’s attitude and world-view. Ultimately, it is really about the rhythm of how you live your life in society: How you think of yourself and deal with others is just as important as how you approach fate. Henry Miller’s opening line to Tropic of Capricorn - “Once you have given up the ghost, everything follows with dead certainty, even in the midst of chaos” - is one I’m quite fond of quoting. Think about it. If nothing else, it is the opinion of a narcissistic, solipsistic egocen- tric. The statement is both definitive and nebulous. Easily taken as the most negative of sentiments, it could mean that, even in con- fusion, there is no hope and life has lost all meaning. Another way to interpret the line is much more positive: Once you have given up, then you are free! This deliriously wild state- ment is a challenge to the universe. Instead of surrendering, one stands in the direct path of a monster tornado, laughing. The end of Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch is a testament to Miller’s quote. The Wild Bunch, an outlaw gang, is in Mexican Gen. Mapache’s camp. The general has had Angel (Jaime Sanchez), one of the Bunch, tortured for assisting his enemies. Angel is brutally beaten, but he is not dead. The morning after Angel’s beating, three of the four surviving members of the gang are with prostitutes. Pike (William Holden) is the head of the gang. As played by Holden, Pike always carries himself with dignity, even as he dresses after spending the night with a young prostitute. His face reflects conflicting emo- tions, but, rather than being grand and tragic, they concern simpler matters. Pike needs sex, she sells it, and he bought it. There is some- thing else, however - something out of focus, almost unholy, about the whole situation. “To live outside the law you must be hon- est” is one of Bob Dylan’s great lines. Pike, this gang’s leader, wants to live outside the world, its rules, and its people. Still, he insists on order, though of a very different texture, with clear moral standards. Pike’s thoughts and his actions are not always as one. Meanwhile, the Gorch brothers have gotten into a fight with their prostitute because she is asking for more money, but brother Lyle (Warren Oates) is insisting that she told them it was two-for-one. His brother, Tector (Ben Johnson), seems amused. Pike walks into the room. Looking at the brothers, he says, “Let’s go.” It is important to understand that Lyle is not only the most base member of the gang but has little use for Angel, as well. Lyle, look- ing back at Pike, answers, “Why not?” In a career literally clogged with brilliance in almost every role he acted, this is still Oates’ finest moment. The three head out the door. Ernest Borgnine is outside, sitting on the ground. The other three walk out; Holden looks down at Borgnine. Not a word is spoken between them, but right away Borgnine gets it. He smiles, then laughs one of those eerie laughs of his - you can’t tell if it implies the peak of human enjoyment or the devil revealing him- self in human sound. Borgnine gets up. The four walk over to their horses, get their rifles, and then head down the street. In a way, this is the iconic shot of the movie: the four of them not talking, walking toward Angel and Mapache with his army. This is about honor; Angel is a member of their gang. They plan to free him, knowing they will die in the attempt. If they don’t have a code and lack honor, however, then they are nothing. “Let’s go.” “Why not?” Even in this world, you can live by your own rules, which has as its bottom line being willing to do anything for honor, even die, then you are free. In the same way Miller talks of let- ting go and Meyer of valuing the joke, this scene is about one’s core. Peckinpah’s family motto was “to enter your house justified.” Everyone who believes that doesn’t necessarily get Meyer’s joke, but everyone who does get it believes in that statement. Last week I was well along writing “Page Two,” holding forth on film and culture, try- ing to say something I really wanted to say. Often, after writing something over and over and finally getting it right, I understand much more clearly what I think. It is no secret that, even at my best, as a writer I am much more of a bar brawler - throwing out word after word, shoving clause on top of clause - than any kind of skilled, careful craftsman. A sure sign of a potentially disastrous piece of writing is when I spend days and days working on the wording and sentences (rather than full steam ahead, turning out thousands and thousands of words, boisterously crowded together). Unfortunately, I am like an addict: Even though I know better, when I sink into trying for a more delicate word construction, it is so inescapable as to make quicksand seem like Teflon. Which is how I stalled out most of the way through that column, though it wasn’t derailed by this obstruction. My own obses- sive compulsions caused me to pause. Even with this self-created crisis, the column was all but finished. I leaned back in the chair to close my eyes and, I was hoping, clear my brain. Leaning back, however, proved to be a mistake. Eyes closed. Involuntarily, I felt the flushing of all breath being pushed out of my body; like the characters in the cartoon “Balloon Land,” I deflated. This occurred not physi- cally but in almost every other way: My spirit gushed out like rushing, raging water from a 10-day storm slicing through a dam. It wasn’t the writing but the thinking. I had nothing to say and no desire to say it. You, the readers, disappeared, while the flames of my passion went out and even the embers grew cold. Regularly, with this column I really do try to hit a degree of honesty. Otherwise why do it? But sometimes I just get sick of me, of my writing, of words, of trying to craft ideas into words. At the heart of it, I am sick of myself. Thinking becomes a pompous torture, as thoughts careen between the ego and the heart. Rarely do I write about this, mostly because it isn’t of much interest to anyone. Some of it, however, is lazy and cowardly. The gaggle of geese that regularly write in assault- ing me and the paper are quite mistakenly convinced that their honking sounds pass for some kind of snide wit rather than just annoying noise. Giving them too easy a target isn’t healthy for them, our readers, or me. The problem with a regular column is that you sound pompous when you are being continued on p. 8 512.563.2437 roadklllpedicab.com ROADKILL PEDICAB CO AUSTIN TX UP TO 10% OFF ALL NOTEBOOKS! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ BACK TO Z™*.

Most of all, the voice of the column is not you. The column confines and contains. Necessarily, it limits one’s horizons. Often I am accused of doing the exact things I rail against. This was certainly true when I expressed my outrage over the unreal, hateful reaction to the Dixie Chicks’ comment about George W Bush. Readers would write that, here I was defending free speech (which I really wasn’t doing, exactly) at the same time I was trying to shut up people who disagree with me. Only I wasn’t. Instead, it was all about engaging in dialogue, not being silent. There is an enormous distance between conflicting opinions - even when offered in the harshest terms and in any or every way trying to shut people up - and censorship. The Chronicle is designed to provoke a reaction, whether it is posi- tive or negative. Stirring up our readers is a critical part of our relationship with and obligation to them. The Chronicle has “Postmarks” in the print edition and forums online, where the views of our readers are offered exactly as they write them, almost always without any editing or interaction on our parts. I qualified that statement because I will remove gra- tuitous curse words, and we won’t print libel or a letter that lacks any ideas but is filled with derogatory slurs. Read over the last three paragraphs. They make tar seem like vinyl. In the midst of speculation, I slip into self-pity. The problem isn’t writing this one col- umn; it is all the columns written, as well as those just thought of, crowding my head, holding a distorting sideshow mir- ror up to myself. “I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane”: Dylan again. It is not just ideas; it is that the “I” who writes has finally so pissed off the rest of me that everything is imploding, while nothing makes sense. I used to get the joke. I couldn’t write last week’s column because now I don’t even remember what it’s about, much less the punch line. ■ Treat the LeRoi Brothers Right Dear Editor, Re: “Treat Her Right” [“Hey, Hey, Hey!,” Music, Aug. 31]: You guys do remember the LeRoi Brothers, don’t you? They had a great cover of the Roy Head classic on their Forget About the Danger ... Think of the Fun EP I’m sure it was way better than the Barbara Mandrell or Mae West versions. Robert De La Cruz Thanks for Treating It Right Dear Editor, Thanks for the story on “Treat Her Right” [“Hey, Hey, Hey!,” Music, Aug. 31], a song near and dear to me ever since my ’66 start-up garage band added it to our repertoire - ever since I first heard it, actually. Does anyone know why it is so hard to find on CD? Any of Roy Head’s compilations that I’ve found do not include the original version. I finally found it on an out-of-print Best of ’65 CD, which I bought used, but it shouldn’t be that hard, should it? I mean shouldn’t everyone have a chance to enjoy this classic? To that end, I want to share this YouTube link to a ’65 performance of “Treat Her Right”: www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ga4mM01SeE. Enjoy! Peace , Steve Brown Domain Subsidies a Reminder Dear Editor, The subsidies to the big developer at the Domain reminds us again why we desperately need a different kind of City Council [“Are We Masters of Our Domain?,” News, Aug. 31]! We can have a pro-neighborhoods and pro-local-busi- ness council; all we have to do is refuse to accept anything less. Ron Coldiron 'Gems' Not 'Germs' Dear Editor, To anyone who scratched his/her head over Austin Powell’s piece on Jesse Dayton, Stag Records, and our [the Texas Sapphires] upcoming release [“Off the Record,” Music, Aug. 17], the album is entitled Roadhouse Gems, Live at John T. Floore Country Store, not Roadhouse Germs as was printed. Thanks for reading. We’ll see y’all on the dance floor! Billy Brent Malkus Rebecca Lucille Cannon The Texas Sapphires continued on p.10 Oops! A caption describing a photo of Michael Marroquin in last week's News feature, “Angels in South America” (austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/lssue/ story?oid=oid%3A531616), incorrectly stated that it was the \"only known photo\" of Marroquin. There might be many other photos of Marroquin, but this was the only one available to us. The Chronicle regrets the error.

He tries to do for ail his people and also the United States of America to keep all the dreams of all his people who are legal! Massey Villarreal, from what I read, is stat- ing that the congressman isn't taking care of the illegals, who stand up in Americans' faces and say, J 'We aren't going to follow your laws, and we aren’t leaving!\" Villarreal and his groups ought to be proud to help honest congressmen/ women to help their people, not backing illegals who blame the U.S. for not deporting them when they should have. And did many times, but they broke the laws time and time again, coming back into the U.S, If Villarreal and his groups are not interested in helping right a wrong their people are doing, then we don't need them here to tear down our America. Can’t the illegals stand up and say: “Yes we are at fault; we didn’t abide by the U.S laws, and now we have families, and children suffering from what we did. We should have followed the laws of America!\" America has bent over backward to help our immigrants. We give free food in our schools and hospitals and so many other programs, Americans and legal immigrants are tired of people who come and don't even appreciate what this great nation has done for them. Yes, big businesses have done them wrong, but it's because they are illegals. They get away with It But these businesses couldn't do this if the illegals had followed our laws and entered legally, l feel sorry for your children that you have caused this outrageous hardship on, and you alone are to blame, not the U.S, And it’s not our place to right your wrong.

Carole Stinson Fred, Texas Knows the Truth and Tells It Dear Editor, Re: Louis Black's response to the letter “Of Course There Is Only One Reality\" [\"Postmarks\"]: \"Finally, take a morally complex situation like in Iraq where almost everyone involved not only has a different perception of their own roie and intentions but also of the role and intentions of all others including those that they oppose. You can argue the reality of any event is knowable, but the interpretations are going to be radically different without any of them being either clearly right or clearly wrong as they involve far more complicated issues than what actually might have physically happened\" - Louis Black. What crapola! There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when the U.S, invaded. Next-door neighbor Iran is now working on them, and the U.S, caused it to happen. Since 9/11, more Americans have died in Iraq than died in the World Trade Center, and the number contin- ues to rise. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have died since our invasion, and the numbers will continue to rise whether we stay or leave. Two million Iraqis have fled their country, thousands of who gave assistance to the invaders, but only about 100 have been allowed to enter the U.S. We upset the balance of power in the Middle East, wasted hundreds of billions of dollars in another Vietnam quagmire, while U.S. victims of poverty and natural disasters are left to fend for themselves, and our constitutional rights are whittled away under the guise of homeland security (USA PATRIOT Act). Corporate America has feasted on the ' war against terrorism” as it does in all wars, and we are less safe today, despite the billions of public pork. History will show the 2000 presidential elec- tion was in fact a coup, followed by massive bloodletting and loss of individual freedoms that furthered the rise of corporate America. While major domestic issues languish, Congress loads meaningless legislation with wasteful \"markers\" to buy future votes. Our country is on the downside of its exis- tence because too many individuals have lost their moral compass and see events like Iraq as a morally complex situation. Bullshit, Charles O’Dell, Ph.D, Prohibitions Are Senseless Dear Editor, Kudos to Jordan Smith for her interview with Rob Kampia [‘Reefer Madness,\" News, Aug, 31], and I commend the Chronicle for devoting a regular column to the war on drugs, the blue- print for the PATRIOT acts and other abuses to the Constitution, I think it is time the Chronicle devotes a major issue to prohibition in general. Alcohol, abortion, ganja, guns, and gay rights: All these fronts in the culture wars have been the undoing of many worthy social causes, and \"progressives\" are just as likely as conservatives to support them with the same slash-and-burn attacks. The goal? Punishment of hated peoples. These senseless exercises in prohibition can blind us. I propose this example: George W. Bush’s equation of the Iraq war with the Vietnam War has most talking heads either dismissing or rationalizing Bush’s stance with some sort of historical comparison. But a look at the far right (which controls the GOP) reveals that its unques- tioned fervor and bloody determination stems from a hatred of the \"Sixties counterculture.\" What better way to remind Americans of what caused the downfall of our nation than to bring up the chief focus of that counterculture, Vietnam? The GOP knows whom they brung to the dance. Whom did the rest of us bring?

Re: \"Road Rules\" [\"Postmarks\" online, Aug. 28]: Shoal Creek requires bicyclists to straddle that lane if they want to ride safely because our gutless City Council caved to a few loud and Irre- sponsible neighbors on Shoal Creek Boulevard and prioritized both-sides on-street parking over bike lanes, against the objections of the Texas Transportation Institute consultants they osten- sibly hired to tell them what the right design was. Your anger is misplaced; the cyclists are mostly doing what they're supposed to do - give parked cars a very wide berth and do so far enough in advance to be safe. In other words, bikers didn't get 50% of the road. They didn't even get 5% of the road. They got absolutely nothing but the mistaken impres- sion that they belong in an unsafe facility dodg- ing parked cars. Thanks, Allandale! Mike Dahrnus Real Accountability Dear Editor, Budget Revelations: Is there real account- ability? Real affordable housing ? When core needs (i.e., affordable housing and health care) are effectively addressed, the entire community benefits exponentially from this investment. A committed investment in public services cre- ates a regenerative cycle of sustainability for our community. This invariably enhances public safety by reducing the probabilities for crises and desperation. Investing in public services is the investment that promotes a high return and also saves money in the long term. Therefore, in response to Gray Panther Mr. Clint Smith's quest/on [\"Postmarks,\" Aug. 17] regarding Wells Dunbar’s \"Budget Revelations\" [\"Beside the Point,\" News, Aug. 3] and Austinites Lobbying for Municipal Accountability follow-up \"Postmark\" (“Insist on Accountability!,\" Aug, 24), I too would like to know: \"What's Happening With Housing Bond Funds?\" How will these funds and the programs be managed and accounted for? And where’s the genuine responsiveness from our elected representatives regarding questions raised by its citizens and taxpayers? Referencing the question raised by ALMA: What good is a budget if the programs still lack accountability? City of Austin's internal waste needs to be cleaned if we are to have any effectiveness with our tax dollars. Cordially, Virginia Pratt Politicians Are Panhandlers, Too Dear Editor, Isn’t it ironic that Jennifer Kim is seeking a motion to ban panhandling when she and every other council member makes innumer- able individual solicitations to support their campaign efforts. Although the measure has been pulled temporarily, this is clearly a red- meat issue intended to woo the “personal responsibility\" voters who find it inconvenient and unaesthetic to look at these folks, let alone acknowledge the reasons that they are out there. None of us want to have people begging on the street corners of our neighborhoods, yet very few of us will vote for leaders who suggest we need to pay for services that will help reduce or prevent this. Alcoholism, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and other causes of homelessness and poverty are an intractable part of every society on the planet. Some soci- eties find ways to keep the negative Impact of this to a minimum, others continue to elect leaders who vilify and blame the homeless to get votes but do nothing to solve or improve the situation.

I ask, was the city accountable when it received and managed Housing and Urban Development grant funds for code upgrades and repairs to homes in East Austin? Did the city in the Nineties fail to meet its fiduciary and man- agement responsibility regarding the HUD hous- ing grant program targeted for East Austin hom- eowners? Is the city meeting its fiduciary duty with its current housing loan program? Is the city failing in its fiduciary responsibility in managing the $55-million affordable-housing bond funds when it dips into such funds to create new staff- ing positions? Is the city meeting its fiduciary responsibility if it allows only 7% of the city’s 2008 budget for Human Services? Are public offi- cials accountable when local regulatory agencies enact arbitrary and capricious decisions regard- ing water, fire protection, and roadways without policy or due process? Are the city and county accountable if police- and sheriff-training pro- grams fail to diffuse unconscious prejudices in its officers who enact biased threats and harass- ments upon citizens? Are landgrabs occurring when we observe 1) redistricting of floodplains, 2) demolition of affordable housing without affordable replacements, 3) formation of private land trusts with oversight boards composed of public officials, and 4) selective distribution of annexation approvals and access to water? Are we as citizens insisting on accountability when we fail to seek information to become informed? Are we as citizens accountable if we fail to require accountability from our public offi- cials? Do we insist on accountability? Joyce McCart Paper Ballots, Not Electronic Dear Editor, “An electronic voting system is to a mechani- cal one what a nuclear bomb is to a hand gre- nade. ... If someone manages to sabotage it, the results can be catastrophic.” (“Election Company Has Long Criminal History” by Daniel Hopsicker, see www.thelandesreport.com/Sequoia.htm.) Last month, the state of California determined that every electronic voting machine now in place can be hacked (see www.bradblog.com). There are scores of documented irregularities in elections where these machines were used going back many years. The companies that make these machines won’t let you see the source code. It’s a propri- etary secret. You’re just going to have to trust them. You literally have a much better chance for an honest transaction when you play a slot machine. At least those machines are heavily tested and regulated by the state in Nevada. We outsource things like garbage collection and road construction. Elections are inherently govern- mental in nature. They should never be outsourced, period. Scrap the electronic voting machines, every one of them. Go back to paper ballots. The hanging chads were a convenient red herring in the 2000 presidential election. The real crime in Florida 2000 was illegally remov- ing 80,000 black voters from the rolls so that they couldn’t vote. Wonder which candidate they would have voted for? Paper ballots are the only way to go (see www.blackboxvoting.org).

Rick Perry accepted the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and commuted the capital sentence of Kenneth Foster to life imprisonment. See “Point Austin,” right. Laura Hall was convicted of hindering apprehension and tampering with evidence and was sentenced to six years of incarceration, in the 2005 West Campus mur- der and dismemberment of Jennifer Cave by Colton Pitonyak. See “The Unexplained Death of Jennifer Cave,” p.32. As congressional deadlines approached to evaluate the administration’s “surge” of additional troops in Iraq, President George W. Bush made an unannounced visit to Anbar province to proclaim that the strategy is work- ing, despite accumulating reports to the contrary. Commented Austin U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, “With his Iraq roadshow, the president desperately hopes that his propaganda surge will succeed where his misguided troop surge has failed.” Next question: How soon will Bush attack Iran? “After carefully consid- ering the facts of this case ... I believe the right and just decision is to com- mute [Kenneth] Foster’s sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment.” - Gov. Rick Perry, Aug. 30 NAKED CITY On Tuesday, Sept. 11, the Planning Commission is scheduled to hear and may vote on whether the city will grant precedent-setting variances to the Waterfront Overlay for a proposed three-tower, 200-foot condo project at 200/333 E. Riverside, on the shores of Lady Bird Lake. The session is at 6pm at City Hall. - Katherine Gregor According to a group of researchers at the University of Washington, the Austin Independent School District does not distribute its funds equally across the district. The study, which looked at the four largest school dis- tricts in Texas, found that while the state has created greater equity among districts in Texas, that has not translated into greater equity between schools within districts. The study looked at how much each school would be expected to get according to its particular demographics; for instance, two schools with an equal number of poor students or English-language learners should get the same amount of money. Instead, the study found that a third of Austin schools received at least 15% more or less funds than they should have. Some of this is due to differences in teacher salaries, but, by and large, the study failed to find school charac- teristics that explained the discrepancies, concluding that “we have to question whether [the funding differenc- es are] driven by a district strategy at all.” - Michael May AISD schools that have failed to meet Adequate Yearly Progress under the No Child Left Behind law are required to offer their students free tutoring in read- ing and math. The service is provided to students at Dobie and Mendez middle schools and Johnston, Lanier, Reagan, and Travis high schools who receive free or reduced lunch. Few students have taken advantage of the offer so far, however. In order to boost the numbers, AISD is working with truancy judges in the schools’ attendance areas to encourage truant students to sign up for tutoring. AISD is also holding a fair this weekend, where parents can meet the state-approved providers, which include private companies, community organiza- tions, and public schools. The fair will be held 9:30am- noon on Saturday, Sept. 8, at the Delco Center (4601 Pecan Brook Dr.). For more info, parents can talk to their school guidance counselor or call Ralph Huhn at 414-0012 or Julie Lyons at 414-3280. - M.M. Doing the math, it looks like Downtown street con- struction could be continuing well into 2010 and beyond. At a recent City Council meeting, chief engineer Bill Gardner said that improvements to Brazos likely would not get under way until after the 2009 legislative ses- sion. Those will be followed by improvements to Colorado, if the city can find the funding. The general plan is to work upstream from Lady Bird Lake on the street grid. The two-way conversion of Cesar Chavez is under way and expected to take another four months. Improvements to Second Street are expected to take most of the 2008 calendar year, according to Gardner’s projections. - Kimberly Reeves Consultants have drafted an initial list of short-term projects to improve the Barton Springs Pool. In this continued on p. 17 POINT AUSTIN One Small Step Kenneth Foster is one life saved on the long road to justice BY MICHAEL KING God bless the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Gov. Rick Perry. That’s a sentence I never anticipated writ- ing, nor I suspect most Chronicle readers anticipated reading. But Perry’s decision last week, to accept the 6-1 recommendation of the BPP and commute the death sentence of Kenneth Foster to life imprisonment, is a his- toric step toward greater justice and mercy. Perry’s decision was essentially unprecedent- ed - the only previous times he has commuted executions were when he was effectively ordered to do so by court rulings: for example, that minors or mentally retarded inmates could not constitutionally be executed. The clemency decision seemed even more unexpected in light of Perry’s recent response to an earlier appeal for an execution moratorium by the European Union. In the condescending voice of his spokesman, Robert Black, Perry had told the Europeans to go suck a lemon: “While we respect our friends in Europe, welcome their investment in our state, and appreciate their interest in our laws, Texans are doing just fine governing Texas.” In other words: “Send us your money, and shut up.” So despite the worldwide outcry against the Foster execution - reportedly the governor’s office received 1 1,000 letters opposing it, 1 1 in favor - I fully expected Foster’s story to end in the same way as every one I’d followed before it. I’ve been writing about capital punishment in Texas for a decade and had long since con- cluded that the “clemency” system (presided over by the BPP) was thoroughly broken - indeed, that it doesn’t really exist. The board is officially required to consider any extra-judicial, mitigating factors in a capital punishment case. Not only had their almost unblemished record of rejections belied that responsibility, but I had watched a previous group of board mem- bers troop into federal court and testify, “We review the files to confirm the condemned has been duly convicted and that he had full access to courts” - a mantra that explicitly violated their mandate but echoed the position of the man who appointed them, then-Gov. George W Bush. Actual clemency was not just an after- thought - it was no consideration at all. Kafkaesque So whatever the reason for this brief break in the bloody chain, I applaud it. In his commuta- tion statement, Perry mentioned “the Texas law that allows capital murder defendants to be tried simultaneously” (Foster had been tried alongside the actual murderer, since executed), continued on p. 16 austinchranicle.com I SEPTEMBER 7, 2007 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I 15 news :: POINT AUSTIN :: FROM P.15 although that issue had not been prominent in Foster’s appeals; the main question had been the state’s application of the “law of parties” in this case - that Foster, who was nearby and complicit when Michael LaHood was killed, “should have anticipated” that the murder might occur and, therefore, must also die. Neither the facts nor the law sup- ported that conclusion, and as Foster’s pro bono attorney, Austinite Keith Hampton, told me last week: “Kenneth didn’t kill anybody, and we’ve already executed the guy who did. What interest did we have in executing anyone else?” Elsewhere he’d noted that even Old Testament law requires only “one life for a life.” Hampton, among the handful of Austin attorneys who volunteer for the thankless task of defending death row inmates, was still giddy last week as he tried to account for the difference in this case over all the ones he’s followed. “Nobody believes it,” he told me. “But as we got close, I really did believe that I had at least five votes on the board.” And in talking to the governor’s staff, he continued, “I got a sense that the voices from overseas might have actually mattered - there were 3,000 signatures on a petition from Germany alone.” Former President Jimmy Carter and South African cleric Desmond Tutu spoke out for Foster, and as part of the Italian anti-death-penalty campaign, the Roman Colosseum was lit on his behalf. Kenneth Foster is alive today because Keith Hampton and all his unnamed allies refused to allow themselves to believe that this Texas capital punishment story would end just like all the others. But of all those voices, always a double-edged sword in these public campaigns, Hampton’s is the voice that mattered most. His letter to BPP Presiding Officer Rissie Owens squarely put the responsibility for fixing the legal errors in Foster’s case on the extra-judicial shoulders of the board. “Kenneth Foster remains on death row because the courts are powerless to commute a sentence they know to be unconstitu- tional,” he wrote. “The procedural technicalities of death penalty review have left Mr. Foster the victim of the most Kafkaesque treatment ever inflicted by state government.” “I urge you to cut through the overgrown technicalities of death penalty review and recognize that our Constitution will be bloodied with an unconstitutional execution if you fail to act,” Hampton contin- ued. “The illegality of his execution has already been appreciated, but only you can enforce the law the judiciary . . . did not. Besides the many other reasons to recommend commutation (such as his demon- strable innocence), it would be tragic and shameful for a man to be executed because the executive branch was indifferent to the judicial branch’s impotence to correct its known mistakes.” Many More Somehow, Hampton cut through the ingrained resistance of the board and then the governor. “You have to remember, what they do all day for a living is turn people down for parole,” he told me. “I got to know what their thinking is, their institutional thinking. I made unusual appeals and unusual arguments, but my basic pitch for clem- ency was that the judicial branch had screwed up and that you [the executive branch] are the only ones that can correct the mistake.” All this, in some combination, prevailed - Kenneth Foster is alive today because Hampton and all his unnamed local and worldwide allies refused to allow themselves to believe that this Texas capital punish- ment story would end just like all the others. It’s one small step. Maybe it will be a turning point - death sen- tences slowly have been diminishing nationwide in recent years - but, as Texans, we’ve executed 402 people (at this writing) since the nation- wide resumption of capital punishment in 1982, and several more Huntsville executions are scheduled for this month. Foster has noted that “there are several other people condemned under the ‘law of par- ties’ like me” and has asked advocates to continue working. So may we all. It’s only one small step. But for today, God bless Gov. Perry, and God bless Keith Hampton. ■ Send comments, questions, and news tips to mking@austinchronicle.com.

BY MICHAEL KING If you thought it was still too early for Silly Season (i.e., municipal campaign time), last week’s City Council session may have changed your mind. The opening tarantara was sounded by Jennifer Kim, echoed with a deep trombone fill by Brewster McCracken. To what classic tune? “Oh, What’ll We Do, What’ll We Do, What’ll We Do ... About Panhandlers?” Here we go again ... J&B had co-sponsored a proposal to hold a public hearing on a new, more restrictive anti-soliciting ordi- nance (already banned in the Downtown corridor), pro- voked in part by recent complaints about frequent pan- handlers at 1-35 and Oltorf, near Travis High School. (Judging from neighborhood reports, it’s not clear if the transients are annoying the wannabe Rebels or the other way around.) BTP happens to be thoroughly famil- iar with that intersection, and we can report that, as always, the imminent dangers to life and limb remain speeders and DWIs. But we already have laws against those, don’t we? At any rate, the premeeting backlash from civil liber- tarians, homeless advocates, and folks who just think we’ve got better things to do was strong enough that Kim and McCracken backed down - until Sept. 27, when staff was asked to return with “recommendations” for a new ordinance, focused on “defining the perimeter” around school yards. In the meantime, McCracken declared, Lovejoylessly, “I personally don’t believe there is a free-speech right for strangers to approach your chil- dren’s school!” But if we take that away, how else will Sandy Kress, Neil Bush, and the rest of the Celebrity Test Floggers make a living? Look for the fun (and the horror stories) to return on Sept. 27 ... and on and on until May. □ In the meantime, the more immediate business is the fiscal year 2008 budget. The final budget hearings and adoptions take place this week, on three days beginning Monday at 10am (although last year, BTP recalls, approval didn’t take that long). After some sum- mer fuss over the city manager’s first draft in July - which showed a theoretical $27 million “deficit” (if coun- cil spent it all) that made for many hand-wringing head- lines and much talk-show hot air - the actual budget ($592.2 million in general funds) has been winnowed into balance, even with an 11% increase ($57.6 million) in spending. That’s largely the result of rising property values - so while your tax bill will increase, the tax rate (per $100 valuation) drops very slightly (from 41.26 to 41.20 cents, for a $721 bill on a $175,000 home). Most of the increased revenue will be devoured by structural costs - e.g., annual pay raises, insurance hikes, previously negotiated public-safety contracts - but the city manager and the budgeteers preserved a com- paratively paltry $5.4 million for additional “core service investments”: $1.6 million for paramedics, firefighters, and forensics; $2.3 million for parks, social services, and libraries; $700,000 for inspections, zoning, and urban-design resources. On this $600 million scale, $5.4 million doesn’t amount to much - if it weren’t for our ongoing bond investments, we couldn’t afford our- selves. (For a visual breakdown of Austin’s FY 2008 income and outgo, see pie graphs below.) Other highlights from last week’s meeting: We’ve got a new Families and Children Task Force (will they pan- handle or hold a bake sale?); in a break from all-munici- pal protocol, Kim and Lee Leffingwell called on Gov. Perry to commute the then-still-pending death sentence of Kenneth Foster (it worked!); and architect/planner Al Godfrey reported that after months of public comment, the Barton Springs Pool Master Plan project priorities have flipped - from building restoration to water-quality improvement and protection (gee whiz, Bill, sometimes they listen!).

The 2008 General Fund Budget Public-safety expenses account for almost two-thirds of the city's General Fund spending. Revenue comes primarily from three sources: property taxes, sales taxes, and utility transfers. Watershed Protection Uses of, Fun c/s — Genets/ Func/ $592.2 million 16 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I SEPTEMBER 7, 2007 I aUStinchronicle.com NAKED CITY :: FROM P.15 case, “short-term” means that the proposed 21 minor projects would be completed over the next one to three years. At a stakeholder meeting last week, consultant Al Godfrey noted the top short-term priorities: study of the pool’s circulation patterns, addressing the tree growth on the grounds, and burying overhead wires underground. While this week’s meeting was fairly tame, the Save Our Springs Alliance still is grousing that financial numbers aren’t attached to the various projects yet, failing to give a full picture of what might get done right away. - K.R. Bicyclist Vilhelm Hesness was killed July 11 when he was struck from behind by a sport utility vehicle, which later flipped over, near the corner of Manchaca and FM 1626. Now, more than eight weeks later, the Texas Department of Public Safety has given virtually no indication as to how it will handle the case. The accident report, the only data released thus far, noted that “failure to control speed,” on the part of the SUV driver, 43-year-old Richard Alan Lee of Austin, was a contributing factor. DPS spokeswoman Lisa Block said the investigation won’t proceed until Lee’s blood toxicology test, taken on the day of the incident, is completed by the DPS crime lab. Bicycling advocates and those close to Hesness are frustrated with the delay and say the case reinforces the perception that local authorities fail to deliver justice to drivers who injure or kill law-abiding cyclists. “We’re very concerned about the delay of this investigation. It should be treated as expeditiously as any other crime,” said Robin Stallings, executive director of the Texas Bicycle Coalition, adding that the tragedy is further evidence that Texas needs a bicycle safe-passing law. “It seems like if you’re not driving drunk and you don’t flee the scene, you get a free pass to run over cyclists.” Block said the typical DPS lab backlog is about six weeks, and further delays depend on workload and the priority of the case. Results are expect- ed this week, she said. - Daniel Mottola AISD students increased their overall SAT scores this year, bucking a state and nationwide decline. Austin students averaged an overall score of 1525 in 2007, up from 1513 in 2006. In Texas, scores dropped an average of three points to 1481 overall; nationwide, scores dropped seven points, to an aver- age of 1511. The increase was most dramatic for Latino students, whose average was up 32 points to 1404 overall, and African-American students, up an average of 30 points to 1258 overall. “We are proud to note the gains made by African-American and Hispanic students,” said Superintendent Pat Forgione in a press release. “But is there more work to be done to close the achievement gap? You bet.” The district also needs to work harder on encouraging students to take the test. Despite a districtwide goal of increas- ing SAT participation, only 2,379 students took the tests, which is 97 fewer than last year. - M.M. On Monday, Sept. 10, the Transportation Policy Board of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization will hold its only public hearing on a proposed package of more than $1 billion in new roads. Critics believe the fast-changing amendments proposed to CAMPO’s Transportation Improvement Program are too long on ill-conceived road projects, too short on transit (none), and insufficiently vetted by public scrutiny. Location: Texas state Capitol, Extension Auditorium Room E-1.004, 6pm. The public comments peri- od closes Friday, Sept. 14. - K.G. BEYOND CITY LIMITS On Aug. 31, Gov. Rick Perry blocked the execution of 30-year-old Kenneth Foster just hours before he was slated to die, accepting a recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Foster’s sentence to life in prison. It was the first time in seven years that Perry issued a death-sen- tence commutation that was not prompted by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Foster was convicted and sentenced to death in a joint trial for the 1996 murder of Michael LaHood in San Antonio. Foster took no active role in the murder, which was committed by co-defendant Mauriceo Brown, but was con- victed based on the state’s “law of parties,” based on the notion that Foster should have anticipated that Brown was going to kill LaHood. (Brown was executed last year.) Foster’s case earned worldwide attention - earning sup- port from the European Union, Texas lawmakers, and a bevy of celebrities, including former President Jimmy Carter, who decried the injustice of execut- ing a man who in fact did not kill anyone. Last week the board agreed, voting 6-1 to recommend a sentence commutation, which Perry granted. Interesting- ly, Perry did not mention in his public statement the law of parties. Instead, he said he was “concerned” about Texas law that allows capital murder defendants to be tried together, suggesting that was an issue “the Legislature should examine.” For more on the case see, “Wrong Place, Wrong Time,” Feb. 11, 2005. - Jordan Smith Lago Vista Pet Adoption and Welfare Services, now Lifelong Friends Pet Adoptions, located at 20803 FM 1431, escaped extinction in July after a successful fund drive raised enough money to keep its doors open and effect a transition to a totally independent, nonprofit, no-kill shelter staffed by volunteers and funded by donations. “Thanks to your generous support, we’ll continue to take the same great care of animals that find their way to us,” reads a notice on the website, www.lvpaws.org. The new name reflects a renewed mission: to help adoptable pets find a loving “forever home.” LFPA will continue to rescue and care for stray and abandoned dogs and cats, as well as educate the public about responsible pet ownership, which includes the resolve to spay/neuter their pets. The facility advertises itself as “not the average shelter” because it will not “participate in the killing of hundreds of healthy, homeless animals,” the website announcement states. As PAWS, the facility cared for more than 2,000 animals since opening in 1997. The organi- zation received funding for medical and spay/neuter services through grants from PetSmart, the Lower Colorado River Authority, and state license plates. Over the years, the shelter has improved, says the website, “by the grace of fundraisers like the silent auction, garage sales, dog walks, and the generous assistance of our many supporters.” For more info, call 512/267-6876 or see www.lifelongfriends.org. - Patricia J. Ruland Two years ago, almost to the day, Washington Humane Society Chief Operat- ing Officer Adam Parascandola arrived in Katrina-ravaged New Orleans to rescue stranded pets. He and Cory Smith of the Humane Society of the United States pitched a tent and began ferrying animals by boat to safety, then by car to a Gonzales, La., equestrian center he calls “our version of the Astrodome” in his dispatch, “A Diary From the Disaster.” This and other com- pelling accounts were re-released at www.humanesociety.org last week to com- memorate what is arguably the largest animal-rescue effort in American his- tory, of about 10,000 dogs, cats, and other critters, according to HSUS. On Aug. 29, HSUS also issued a post-disaster progress report. “No one was fully prepared to deal with Katrina,” said Wayne Pacelle, HSUS president, “but since 2005, federal and state policies have changed.” In 2006, the HSUS-backed Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act passed, and 16 states have since put some teeth in their own animal-rescue laws. In addition, the HSUS has allocated $34.6 million in disaster aid, including $8.35 million to rebuild 45 Gulf-region animal shelters, and held workshops on preparedness in 26 states. “It’s much easier to do the work before a disaster strikes than after,” Pacelle said. - PJ.R. On the climate-change front, mega-utility TXU made front-page news this spring when it announced it would drop plans for eight of 11 highly polluting coal-burning power plants and undertake reforms like lowering its sky-high rates, as part of a proposed buyout by two private equity firms. This Friday, when TXU’s shareholders vote on the deal, environmental watchdog groups are calling for a rejection of the deal unless the utility’s sweet-sounding prom- ises are put in writing. Among the demands: Public Citizen and the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition are calling for TXU to formally withdrawal state air-permit applications for its eight supposedly dropped plants, applications that are now only suspended. The groups also urge TXU to reflect promised reductions in mercury emissions, as well as global warming reforms, in plans for its three remaining plants - especially the huge, two-unit Oak Grove plant, regarded as an imminent air-quality threat to Austin and a carbon-dioxide train wreck. The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now is calling on TXU Chief Executive Officer John Wilder to apply some of his estimated $270 million in stock profits from the deal toward extending to five years a promised 18-month discount for low- income customers. Finally, the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, described on its website as an “international coalition of 275 faith-based institutional investors,” is calling for “quantitative goals ... to reduce mercury and total C0 2 emissions to below 2004 levels.” - D.M. As the newly elected president of the National Women's Political Caucus, Austinite Lulu Flores is already knee-deep in one of the most intriguing challenges in the group's 35-year history - to send a woman to the White House. The NWPC has endorsed New York Sen. Hillary Clinton for president, and Flores will co-host a Sept. 13 fundraiser for the former first lady, who will be joined in Austin by husband Bill Clinton. The last female presidential candidate backed by the NWPC was Shirley Chisholm, one of the original founders of the group, which grew out of the women's movement of the early Seventies. Flores, who took the helm of the NWPC last month at the group's annual meeting in Las Vegas, is a longtime civic and political activist with deep roots in Austin. In 2002, she landed in the Democratic run-off for the District 52 Texas House seat, ultimately losing to Rep. Eddie Rodriguez. Flores is the second Texan to serve as NWPC president. The group's first president was Lone Star legend Sissy Farenthold. - Amy Smith Cl Clarksville /fef* If? tfoiqt#- SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE 30K-60K-90K •TUNE-UPS* • ENGINES • BRAKES • •TRANSMISSIONS* •EXHAUST* •CUSTOM MODS* •COLLISION, PAINT & BODY* CALL FOR ESTIMATES www.jeepmasters.com 2617 SOUTH FIRST ST. austinchranicle.com I SEPTEMBER 7, 2007 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I 17 news Single- Member District Dilemmas The time may have come for single- member districts in Austin - the city is now majority minority, like most larg- er cities in the nation - but it was hard to tell at a recent meeting of the city’s Charter Revision Committee, which has begun exploring the issue. Even former Mayor Gus Garcia, who chairs the committee, admitted after the Aug. 22 meeting that the process of drafting a pro- posal for single-member districts is off to a slow start. While a series of earnest speakers assured the commit- tee it’s time to move from an at-large system to single- member districts, attendance at the meeting was ane- mic, and it’s obvious the committee will have to put something bold on the table to drum up interest. DeWayne Lofton, who ran an unsuccessful race against Sheryl Cole in the last city election, was in the audience. He said he supports single-member districts. They provide more diverse representation and force can- didates to focus on issues at the grassroots level, he said, as well as making campaigns a whole lot cheaper. But Lofton’s not convinced the committee is headed in the right direction - capable of building one vision within the next six months, in other words. And, without whole- sale change, he suspects this effort will go down at the polls (just like the six attempts before it) for two reasons: “First, because it’s designed to fail. We’ve drawn the maps in such a way that people tend to vote against the map instead of for the map,” Lofton said. “Second, there has never been any coordinated campaign to get people out to vote for the map. That means it fell back on a small core of Central Austin voters to try to get this thing passed.” At the Aug. 22 meeting, city demographer Ryan Robinson presented an overview of Austin’s changing demographics. One fact that stood out: The traditional bloc of African-American residents in East Austin has scattered to the north and south. Robinson said the best district he could draw was one with a popula- tion that was 35% African-American, and, even then, those African-Americans would be trumped by 44% Latinos. It’s not likely that would sit well with the Department of Justice. The best the city could do for Asians would be to draw an opportunity district - one with a majority of Hispanics, African-Americans, and Asians - in the north end of the city. Robinson has drawn these maps before - based on the sheer number of minorities in each voting precinct - so he understands the challenges. But the gaps continue to grow wider. For instance, the international immigrant popu- lation in Austin in 2000 was 8% of the city’s overall growth. Five years later, it was 23% of overall growth. Throw on top of that the income gradient from east to west - with the majority of families earning more than $100,000 living west of MoPac - and the fact that West Austin voters are up to three times as likely to vote as those east of 1-35. And, even beyond that, consider that significant new development like Mueller will also shift demographics, and the complexities mount. One new twist on the single-member district picture came from speaker Roscoe Overton. He pointed out that Memphis had overcome demographic issues similar to Austin by slicing the city in half by using a north- south dividing line and electing three at-large members on each side of the line. In Austin, that could be 1-35. Such a system does not require putting together oddly configured districts to elect a particular minority. At the same time, it cuts the territory in half so that candidates are not required to spend the big bucks they must spend on a citywide campaign. At the conclusion of Overton’s remarks, Vice Chair Chad Williams said he would like to know wheth- er such a configuration had increased voter turnout. The Charter Revision Committee’s next meeting is Sept. 13. Timing issues - especially if a petition drive is involved - almost rule out a May 2008 charter election. That means the most likely election date would be the November gener- al election or even the following May. Check out the commit- tee’s website at www.ci.austin.tx.us/charter. - Kimberly Reeves TEXAS CONSTITUTION GETS POLISHED UP The House Research Organization put out a list www.hro.house.state.tx.us/focus/amend80.pdf of all 16 constitutional amendments that will be appearing on the Nov. 6 ballot papers. Before you get all excited about the possibility of some new rights (pants back on, nude hitchhiker advo- cates of Texas) most of them are basically housekeeping and bookkeeping. First, there’s the money money money, and there are many bond issues on the table. All bonds have to be approved, and this year there’s a total of $9.75 billion waiting to be released. $500 million of that goes to student loans, so it actually doesn’t count toward the state debt limit. More than half of the rest - $5 billion - goes to road repairs, $3 billion to cancer research, $1 billion to state agency con- struction and repair projects, and a teeny-tiny-but- we’d-still-take-it $250 million to water and sewer ser- vices for economically distressed areas. But while bonds may be going out, property taxes may, well, at least go up less. Proposition 3 would limit ad valorem tax hikes to 10% per annum, while Proposition 5 gives cities with fewer than 10,000 people the power to freeze taxes if they’re applying for certain development grants. Best of all is Proposition 10, which finally brings Texas’ rules on tax breaks for disabled veter- ans into line with Veterans Administration recommendations. But for anyone looking for a change in the rules of governance, there’s always Prop. 11, written by Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas. This automatically would enter into the journal which way all reps and senators went on a record vote on a bill. This would replace the cur- rent system whereby it takes three legislators request- ing it be recorded. Keeping track of how the Lege votes?

That’s the gist of an Aug. 20 letter from city attorney Anne Morgan to Moriarty’s attorney, Robert Notzon, in response to Notzon’s Aug. 7 letter to City Manager Toby Futrell request- ing the city consider enabling Moriarty to return to his former position of program man- ager of the Austin Clean Water Program. Notzon’s letter also asked that the city pro- vide letters of apology and recommendation for former city environmental consultant Diane Hyatt, who lost her contracts with the ACWP when Futrell concluded that Moriarty and Hyatt’s personal relationship constituted a conflict of interest. Notzon suggested that since a subsequent investigation by the Office of the City Auditor (as reported by the Statesman in July) had found no wrongdoing and since the city acknowledged that Moriarty had done a fine job, “my clients request that the city take the next logical step of returning them to their previous professional positions.” If that can’t be done, Notzon continued, he is available to discuss “other options to assist in correcting the harms done to Ms. Hyatt and Mr. Moriarty.” Responded Morgan tersely, “This matter has been fully litigated and finally resolved between the City of Austin and Bill Moriarty.” She then continued, “The City does not intend to provide anything further to Ms. Hyatt.” In the spring of 2005, Moriarty was let go as program director by Earth Tech, the gener- al contractor on the ACWF? after the city dis- covered that Moriarty and Hyatt had become a couple sometime during Moriarty’s tenure and that Hyatt’s firm, Hyatt and Associates, had been assigned contracts under the program. Moriarty and Hyatt protested, to no avail, that their private relationship began after the con- tracts were awarded (a chronology still under dispute) and that, in any case, Moriarty had no role in awarding the work - such contracts are granted by the city department supervis- ing the project, in this case Public Works. Futrell was unmoved, insisting that Moriarty had a duty to disclose his relationship with Hyatt and that the consequent conflict of interest - real or perceived - merited Moriarty’s removal from the program and the loss of Hyatt’s contracts. By the time the initial dust storm settled, Moriarty had sued Futrell, Assistant City Manager Joe Canales, and Council Member Brewster McCracken for contract interfer- ence and defamation. That lawsuit, as Morgan reminded Notzon last week, was eventually settled - one outcome was a city letter for Moriarty’s file confirming that the ACWP under Moriarty was “a well run and successful Public Works program.” But Morgan reiterated that, despite Moriarty’s disagreement, “the City Manager determined that Moriarty had a conflict of interest [concerning Hyatt] that he failed to disclose.” Still very much pending is another lawsuit against numerous major city engineering firms and their representatives, whom Moriarty and Hyatt accuse of collaborating in an illegal effort to persuade the city to remove Moriarty from the ACWP As Notzon put it in his letter, “In approximately April 2005, several engi- neering firms, their representatives, and their lobbyists got together and decided to make unsubstantiated and false allegations against Moriarty and Hyatt to [Futrell] in an effort to remove Moriarty from the ACWP” Moriarty has contended that the engineering firms and their associates - including major local play- ers like PBS&J, Malcolm Pirnie, attorney David Armbrust, and former mayor Bruce Todd (among several others) - had been long accustomed to favorable treatment on city contracts and blamed Moriarty for installing performance standards and procedures mak- ing them increasingly subject to competition. Indeed, some of them claimed Moriarty had solicited bribes in return for steering con- tracts in their direction, but separate investi- gations by both the Austin Police and the Travis Co. district attorney’s office have found no evidence of wrongdoing. Morgan’s response to Notzon did not con- fine itself to rejecting his request for amelio- ration on behalf of his clients; she also icily accused him of violating state bar rules pro- hibiting direct contact with a represented defendant (i.e., Futrell) and implicitly threaten- ing litigation. A couple of days later, Notzon replied that he has no plans to sue the city or Futrell and, moreover, that “my letter was merely a glorified request for Mr. Moriarty’s and Ms. Hyatt’s jobs/contracts back given the fact that they are acknowledged by the City to have not engaged in the conduct for which they were accused and initially removed from their contracts. ... Given your letter, I will assume that the answer is no to both of my clients’ requests.” Asked last week about the correspondence, Notzon reiterated that he simply wanted to give the city an opportunity to “decrease the damages” to Moriarty and Hyatt, who have been forced to find other, less-rewarding employment (Moriarty out-of-state) since their removal from the ACWP Referring wryly to recent disclosures concerning alleged conflicts of interests involving City Manager Futrell her- self, Notzon said, “I thought, ‘Why not?’ Let’s give the city a chance to reconsider in light of new understanding of what is considered a ‘conflict of interest’ or even a ‘perceived con- flict of interest.’ They didn’t have to take that position in [Moriarty and Hyatt’s] case, and I gave Futrell an opportunity to rectify how con- flicts or ‘duty to report’ have been considered.” City attorney Morgan was out of the office this week and unavailable for comment about her correspondence with Notzon. The pending civil lawsuit suggests that there will be several more chapters to the Moriarty story. Responding to the city’s per- haps unsurprising rejection of help for his cli- ents, Notzon concludes his second letter by requesting that Morgan schedule depositions for Futrell and McCracken in the Moriarty/ Hyatt lawsuit against the engineering firms and their associates. Notzon’s initial plead- ings argue that the defendants illegally, via conspiracy and defamation, induced the city to force the removal of Moriarty and Hyatt from their ACWP contracts. Presumably Futrell and McCracken can shed some light on if, and how, that process came to be. - Michael King CHRIRS PLUS AUSTIN’S ONLY TRUE ERGONOMIC STORE FREE ROLLING DESKMATE WITH PURCHASE OF RECLINER Sept 4-15 MOST OF OUR VENDORS ARE GREEN CERTIFIED.

Last week, the city settled a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas by a group of independent TV and film producers and protesters following a November 2005 Ku Klux Klan rally at City Hall. Not only had the city estab- lished a massive police cordon to keep counter- demonstrators two blocks away from the City Hall Plaza, where a dozen San Angelo Klansmen were rallying in support of the pending state Proposition 2 (rebanning same-sex marriages), but city manag- ers and public-information officials created a “pro- fessional journalist” credentials test that effec- tively excluded noncomm"
