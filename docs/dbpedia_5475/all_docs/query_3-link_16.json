        "text": "ABSTRACT This article aims to discuss some points on literary aesthetics and interpretation with a focus on African literature and within the framework of the theory of stylistic criticism. The aesthetic dimension distinguishes African literature as a specific artistic creation in the comity of global culture. Literature like any work of art is prone to different interpretations and reactions as the phenomenologist Roman Ingarden has pointed out. But the criticism and interpretation of African literature must be carried out within the context of Africa’s peculiar tradition and values. In the attempt to discover the artistic status of a work, the interpretations must decipher the extraordinary in the formal aesthetic features of the work. The way a writer has made an ordinary story to look special beyond what is familiar gives the work its aesthetic value. Artful African work of fiction seeks to present the meaning of African social and cultural issues in a malleable poetic and narrative language, richly symbolic, that is imaginatively persuasive with a power to capture attention and emotionally sanctify the reader. Key words: African literature, aesthetics, criticism, judgment, appreciation. ABSTRAIT Cet article a l'intention de discuter un certain nombre de points sur l'esthétique et l’interprétation littéraires en se concentrant sur la littérature africaine dans le cadre de la théorie de la critique stylistique. La dimension esthétique distingue la littérature africaine comme une création artistique spécifique dans le comité de culture globale. La littérature comme n'importe quelle œuvre d'art est encline à de différentes interprétations et aux réactions, comme Roman Ingarden, le phénoménologiste a montré. Mais la critique et l'interprétation de la littérature africaine doivent être réalisées dans le contexte de la tradition particulière de l'Afrique et de ses valeurs. Dans la tentative de découvrir le statut artistique d'un travail, les interprétations doivent déchiffrer l'extraordinaire dans les traits esthétiques formels du travail. La façon dans laquelle un auteur a transformé une histoire banale en un texte particulier au-delà de ce qui est familier donne au travail sa valeur esthétique. La création artistique d’une œuvre de fiction africaine cherche à présenter le sens des problèmes sociaux et culturels africains dans un langage poétique et narratif malléable, richement symbolique, qui est imaginativement persuasif, capable de capturer l'attention et sanctifier le lecteur avec émotion.\n\nThe criticism of African literature awakened and grew by means of controversy during the 1970s and 1980s, with some of the critics taking the view that African literature can only competently be addressed by African critics, as if being an African provided one a special key to these literary artefacts. The prejudice in this is that what one studies is not literature, but Africanness, or what some call ‘the African experience’; and it has led to constructing instrument of analysis which are incapable of uncovering the literary qualities of the works. This has a negative effect on the literary tradition itself since it encourages the production of works displaying the features the critics have called African. This paper argues that the entire tradition – the literature, the criticism, and the literary theory – needs to connect to and stay engaged with other literary traditions of the world in dialogue, highlighting the fact that they are all things of the same kind.\n\nThe assertions that the appraisal of African literature lacks theoretical rigour are not valid. The reading of literature cannot be theory-free. Every discourse written or spoken about literature is grounded in theory(ies). Steve Ogunpitan claims that “all forms of literary criticism, all kinds of reading of literature are informed by theory, whether or not the reader is conscious of it” (1999:101). The application of theories, X.J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia observe, enables the reader “to analyse imaginative literature more perceptively” (2007:1507). If the reading of literature cannot be divorced from theoretical rigour, then the appraisal of African literature cannot be an exception. The reading of African literature has been enriched by the application of methods drawn from contemporary literary theories. The appraisal of African literature, borrowing the words of Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin (1989:155), “intersect in several ways” with contemporary literary theories such as postmodernism, Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis, ecocriticism and so on. Even though African literature is “utilitarian” (Tanure Ojaide, 1995:4), scholars and critics of African literature have attempted to apply intrinsic or text-base theories such as formalism, New-Criticism, structuralism and post-structuralism to the study of African literature for proper elucidation. Prominent is the effort of the African critic, Sunday Anozie, to apply the structuralist poetics to African literature. Amaechi Akwanya (2000:68) posits that “there are no theories which apply exclusively to African literature.” This implies that the study of African literature is placed on the pedestal of contemporary critical traditions. The “appropriation” of contemporary literary theories “offer perspectives which illuminate some critical issues addressed” by African literary texts, although African literary discourse “itself is constituted in texts prior to and independent of” these theories (Ashcroft, Griffiths & Tiffin, 155). Contemporary theories of literature are “viable for the discussion of African literature but they need constantly to be interrogated and rethought” (Akwanya, 68). This paper makes a case for the practicability of African New Criticism, which is a sort of hybrid of the textual and the contextual as opposed to the Anglo-American New Criticism, which is extremely textual; it is a formalistic explication of text with focus on the intrinsic; however it strives to resist the temptation of ignoring the extrinsic since both are modes of signification of meaning. Attempts would be made to examine how New Critical theory is “interrogated” and “rethought” in African context. For the purpose of this study, two poems (see the appendix) selected from Remi Raji’s Gather my Blood Rivers of Songs (2009) would be engaged for critical analysis in order to justify the relevance of New Criticism in the explication of the multiple layers of meaning in African poetic discourse irrespective of the fact that the majority of African poets have always been considered free-versers.\n\nCritics have argued that the African literary artist [traditional or modern] carries out some kind of function. This includes teaching his audience through his work, having qualified as the keeper of his society’s mores. Yet no critic has closely interrogated this stance and the constitution of the space of representation and teaching; what he really teaches; the shades of opinion that make him seem a recorder of his society’s mores; and other sundry lacunae. This article proceeds by problematising such terms as artist, society, mores and teaching, on one hand, and by invoking such theoretical concepts of literature enunciated by critics, from Aristotle to Akwanya, on the other, in order to dismantle the argument that the artist teaches. It also argues that the notion of function, either teaching or recording of mores, privileges unity of message. The sense of unity is later exploded via exploring the chaotic meaning in Nigerian literature from traditional to modern works. In addition, this work demonstrates that the artist is a victim of the fleeting space of in-betweenness in which his craft is formed and to which he owes allegiance. Rather than record the mores of a society, at most, society merely affords him a place through its language for the purpose of mediating ‘reality’ at a second remove. From the explorations of the above varied concerns, this work concludes that either the artist is a bad teacher, or is someone from whom the ability to teach or record his society’s mores breaks free.\n\nIn this dissertation an examination is made of the different strands of contemporary South African protest and resistance poetry. This is done by way of analysing selected poems to highlight the relationship which exists between politics and aesthetics and further to illustrate that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. A brief history of written African protest and resistance poetry is provided in an attempt to put this poetry within its historical context and to trace its influences and development. The poems are then examined with the express aim of identifying and understanding their themes and the socio-political contexts from which they emanate. These contexts are then shown to have important implications in so far as the aesthetics of protest and resistance poetry is concerned. The dissertation highlights the fact that for this poetry to be fully appreciated, there is a need to recognize the particular circumstances which surround it. This recognition is essential because these circumstances are instrumental in the shaping of the poetry and formation of an aesthetics of protest and resistance. An examination of whether this type of poetry has any socio-political relevance and literary significance to contemporary South Africa is also made."
