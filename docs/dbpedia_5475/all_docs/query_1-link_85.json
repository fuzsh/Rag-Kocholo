        "text": "Maria Alvarez\n\nBirmingham\n\nThe two most entertaining reads of the year were both first-time novels and are both wonderfully comic yet moving: A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian by Marina Lewycka (Viking) and the even better (by a whisker) The Family Tree by Carole Cadwalladr (Doubleday). They deal with families and the complications, divided loyalties and alternating emotions that they engender; Lewycka by invoking the fractured history of eastern European emigrés and Cadwalladr by examining the workings of genetics and memory. They handle serious issues with a real lightness of touch.\n\nLeon Bailey\n\nWorcester\n\nAs a long-time admirer of Jane Gardam it has been a real pleasure to read her latest novel, Old Filth (Abacus), with her insight into the way memory operates for elderly people, as well as her depiction of the quirkiness of the characters. This year, the discovery of Julie Myerson's books has been stimulating, alongside the latest offerings of two of today's best crime writers, Before the Frost by Henning Mankell (Vintage) and Flesh and Blood by John Harvey (Arrow). Larry Todd re-evaluates Mendelssohn, his music and his place in Victorian culture very well in his extensive biography, Mendelssohn: A Life In Music (Oxford University Press, USA). Patrick Hamilton's trilogy Twenty Thousand Streets under the Sky (reissued in paperback, Vintage) is a brilliant depiction of loneliness in an urban environment with especially convincing dialogue. Lastly, Candace Allen's fictionalised biography Valaida (Virago) portrays the life of Valaida Snow, a black woman jazz musician in a male-dominated world.\n\nLouise J Bird\n\nAltrincham, Cheshire\n\nSybille Bedford's Quicksands (Hamish Hamilton), is a wonderful memoir, which should be enjoyed like a wine of superior quality. Her memories encompass her childhood in pre-first world war Germany, her adolescence in France and England, with frequent visits to Italy, her second world war years in America and her return to England afterwards. On these wars Bedford hangs the tapestry of her family life, friendships, literary connections and the events that shaped her life. Quicksands is the bedrock on which her own novels - all of which deserve to be read or re-read - are based.\n\nRichard Burnett\n\nDidsbury, Manchester\n\nIn Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon (Bloomsbury), Gijs van Hensbergen eloquently explores the origins, impact and historical resonances of Picasso's seminal painting. The influence of the piece on American art during its sojourn at MOMA is revelatory. But better still is the account of the lengthy struggle to return the work to its spiritual home: a process intimately linked with the changing perceptions of Spanish identity and democracy. The book serves as a timely reminder of the power of an image: the UN's tapestry copy was veiled during the diplomatic frenzy prior to the Iraq war.\n\nAndreas Campomar\n\nLondon\n\nIt was through Alberto Manguel's wonderfully eclectic anthologies that I first learned how to read properly. This year's A Reading Diary: A Passionate Reader's Reflection on a Year of Books (Canongate) was a timely reminder of how and why one reads. From Borges's friend and collaborator, Adolfo Bioy Casares, to the great Brazilian novelist, Machado de Assis, by way of The Wind in the Willows and The Sign of Four, Manguel shows us how certain books have the ability to illuminate our everyday lives. Could there be a new trend here: \"reading diaries\" from some of our favourite authors?\n\nAnother timely reminder, though this time of how to write, was Shirley Hazzard's masterpiece The Transit of Venus (Virago). Such was the elegance and subtlety of her prose, I found myself having to re-read paragraphs.\n\nAlan Castree\n\nFetcham, Surrey\n\nA chance encounter with My Apprenticeship (Penguin) by Maxim Gorky led me to complete his autobiographical trilogy. What strength of character he had, not only to survive to adulthood but then to champion the cause of the Russian people during a reign of terror, and still manage to present his experiences with a sprinkling of dry humour. The memories of the first world war led me to another personal trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston (Faber) by Siegfried Sassoon. Here was a brave soldier who reflected deeply on his experiences and consequently blossomed as a visionary and campaigner for peace. The perseverance of these two men finds many echoes today, particularly among women, millions of whom are striving for equality and opportunity. The Bookseller of Kabul by Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad (Virago) and Reading Lolita in Iran by academic Azar Nafisi (Fourth Estate) comprise graphic accounts of the repression - domestic, social and intellectual - that so many women suffer in the 21st century. Finally, my thanks to Everyman for their inexpensive short anthologies of the works of wonderful poets, which provided me with an appreciation of the delights of Emily Dickinson's verse (Selected Poems); barely published in her lifetime but admired so justifiably now.\n\nSimon Clarke\n\nLondon\n\nThe British read fewer books in translation than other Europeans. Among the gems in translation were Carl-Johan Vallgren's The Horrific Sufferings of the Mind-Reading Monster Hercules Barefoot His Wonderful Love and His Terrible Hatred (Harvill), a highly inventive tale of a physical freak with preternatural powers set in 19th-century Europe. Leonid Tsypkin's dense and complex Summer in Baden-Baden (New Directions Paperback) centres on one summer in the life of Dostoevsky and will surely become a classic.\n\nKaye Coleman-Rooney\n\nBangkok, Thailand\n\nI re-read William Dalrymple's From The Holy Mountain (Flamingo) twice. His mix of scholarship, frank curiosity, compassion and humour make his journey a celebration, but also and primarily, a vital lament and witness. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini (Bloomsbury) is stunning and heart-breaking in its quiet intensity. A doctor by day, Hosseini's writing is meticulous and evocative, and so disciplined and assured it came as a surprise that this is his first novel. Another important witness, he shares Dalrymple's humanity and compassion, with a keen sense of how small cruelties betray us all daily.\n\nNorah Seton's deceptively unassuming The Kitchen Congregation (Phoenix mass market) shows that small kindnesses might on the other hand help to redeem us.\n\nI must mention Sightseeing by Rattawut Lapcharoensap (Atlantic Books) as a tragic-comic reflection on the human condition whether you're in Thailand or Truro.\n\nPhilippa Collins\n\nCatalunya, Spain\n\nThe Sound of My Voice by Ron Butlin (Serpent's Tail) is an extraordinary account by a Scottish writer of two days in the life of a successful but alcoholic businessman. The way in which the drink keeps family and office life safely at one remove, with reality sometimes forcing its way through, is beautifully done, and the book should be more widely known.\n\nManuel Vásquez Montalbán, who died last year, was a Catalan crime writer. Some of his books have been translated into English. The crime in Southern Seas (Serpent's Tail) is an excuse for a gastronomic, political and social tour of Barcelona.\n\nOliver Conolly\n\nLondon\n\nRaymond Tallis is a remarkable polymath, a distinguished academic doctor who writes on philosophy, among other things. His magnum opus, a trilogy (The Hand, I Am, and The Knowing Animal - all published by Edinburgh University Press) was published recently. It totals 1,000 pages of intricate argument to the effect that humanity has transcended its biological origins and that its distinctive features, the self (dealt with in the second volume) and knowledge (dealt with in the third) cannot be explained scientifically. The first volume, The Hand, provides an explanation of how we transcended evolution. A work rigorous enough to stretch professional philosophers, but underpinned by a passionate desire to communicate an important message to a wider audience. Another remarkable medical polymath, Theodore Dalrymple, has published a collection of essays of literary and social comment, Our Culture - What's Left Of It (Ivan R Dee Inc, US), of characteristic brilliance and insight.\n\nSue Cross\n\nby email\n\nSimon Winchester makes the way the earth moves into a rip-roaring blockbuster A Crack in the Edge of the World (Viking) is a gripping page-turning account of before, during and after the great American earthquake of 1906 which devastated the first San Francisco. After reading this book you might wonder how the inhabitants of the present city can sleep at night. Read this and the world as you know it might never seem the same again.\n\nCatherine Davies\n\nBelfast\n\nAbdulrazak Gurnah's By the Sea (Bloomsbury) melds the spice-laden scent of Zanzibar with the musty atmosphere of seedy boarding houses in south-eastern England. The experiences of the asylum seeker and the former bureaucrat are intertwined with a subtlety to be envied by any parfumier.\n\nNoel Streatfeild, best known for her children's books, gives a child's perspective of wartime life in Saplings (Persephone). Happy childhood holidays at the seaside are contrasted with the dispersion of the children to various relatives; they narrate their mother's nervous breakdown and descent into alcoholism following their father's heroic death in battle. With endpapers by Marion Dorn evoking Matisse's decoupage, the volume is a triumph of content and form; a delight to read and treasure.\n\nJRS Davies\n\nCastlerock, Coleraine\n\nAs a frequenter of second-hand and charity bookshops, I inevitably find myself catching up on old fiction. Indeed, two of the books I've enjoyed from such sources this year date back to the 1950s - Muriel Spark's still enjoyably deadpan Memento Mori (Penguin) and A Man's Estate (Eyre & Spottiswoode), a surprisingly absorbing story of family conflict by the neglected Welsh novelist Emyr Humphreys. Of more recent novels, I am still haunted by James Meek's The People's Act of Love (Canongate). But my personal best of the year was the quirky Ring Road (Perennial) by Ian Sansom. Like me, he is Essex-born but now resident in Northern Ireland, and his novel, set in an unnamed small town peopled by a bewildering - and bewildered - set of interrelated characters, not only was hugely entertaining but also helped me make sense of my new surroundings. And all without mentioning the Troubles.\n\nPatrick C Donaghey\n\nNo Fixed Address\n\nDespite being homeless for the past 12 months and more, I have kept up my reading - for pleasure, structure and sanity. These books (and others) have made a difficult situation bearable, and at times, strangely, not unpleasant. I re-read Iain Sinclair's London Orbital (Penguin). It was stunning on second reading and I will read it several more times yet. He gets into the creases of England now and in his guise as a pedestrian shows us the insanity of internal-combustion-engine obsession.\n\nRemains of Elmet, Ted Hughes (Faber). I can't stop myself returning again and again to a poet who writes lines such as: \"Stars sway the tree / Whose roots / Tighten on an atom.\"\n\nThe Collected Poems of Wilfred Owen (Chatto & Windus) are potent beyond words, including those I thought I was familiar with from memory, and fantastically haunting poems I haven't come across before, such as \"Shadwell Stair\". Peter Ackroyd's Dickens (Chatto & Windus) has the sense of the author walking in his subject's shoes. I also read A Selection of Poems and Letters (Penguin) by William Blake, who casts his shadow over all the above.\n\nDavid Edwards\n\nSt Helens, Merseyside\n\nFor some unfathomable reason This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson (Headline Review) didn't make the leap from the Booker long list to the short list. It would be a shame if other readers missed this intelligent, moving and awesomely researched book.\n\nGil Elliot\n\nLondon\n\nTolstoy's declared aim in War and Peace was to write \"a history of the people\". Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have done it for China in Mao: the Unknown Story (Cape), which roused the ire of academic historians. Some details may need correcting, as in all historical accounts, but this is enthralling, immensely readable, and accurate at its core: a book of the decade. Other books I've enjoyed, wondering why it's suddenly women who are putting us right about the world, are Karen Armstrong's A History of God (Vintage), and The Bookseller of Kabul, by Åsne Seierstad (Virago).\n\nJackie Ferguson\n\nTenby, Pembrokeshire\n\nSaturday by Ian McEwan (Cape) has to be my book of the year: a day in the life of the \"chattering\", Guardian-reading classes. A neurosurgeon lays bare the complex morality of life in Blairite Britain. The threat to idyllic family life arrives not in the form of terrorist outrage, but as a consequence of a random road-rage encounter. McEwan writes convincingly of the undercurrent of powerful atavistic forces which compel a civilised man to protect those he loves with everything in his power.\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (Serpent's Tail) is a study of childhood psychosis that should come with a health warning - this book fuels the nature/nurture debate and could seriously damage your certainties about childhood innocence and mother-love. Those as yet undecided about parenthood should perhaps consider Shriver's view of the relationship which seriously questions whether \"they fuck you up, your Mum and Dad\".\n\nPauline Ford\n\nShipley, West Yorkshire\n\nFather and Son: a Study of Two Temperaments by Edmund Gosse (Oxford University Press, originally published in 1907) is my book of the year. The father is Philip Henry Gosse, an eminent Victorian naturalist and widower; the son is Edmund Gosse, later a man of letters. This is the story of the son's upbringing by a man of intellectual stature and great charm, who was a rigid Plymouth Brother, abhorring, among many things, Christmas pudding, naked statues of Greek gods, and carnelian brooches. The book is suffused with affection and a great deal of humour, and the portrait of the father is always sympathetic, never a caricature.\n\nNina Foster\n\nDurban, South Africa\n\nMating Birds by Lewis Nkosi (HarperCollins) is about the fallout of a relationship between a black man and a white woman set in Durban under apartheid. The descriptions of the racially segregated beaches are exactly as I remember them. My best two finds of the year would have to be Ali Smith and Clarice Lispector.\n\nWaldo Gemio\n\nLondon\n\n\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Muslim man, regardless of his fortune, must be in want of a nine-year-old virgin wife.\" That's the opening line from part IV of Azar Nafisi's Reading Lolita in Tehran (Fourth Estate), which tells of how Nafisi, expelled from her university for not wearing a veil, ran a secret book group in which Nabokov, F Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James and Austen, among others, were discussed. Nafisi presents books as escape, as liberation, as weapons. Nicole Krauss's warmly humorous The History of Love (Viking) will move even the most jaded reader. Heartbreak and Vine, by Woody Haut (Serpent's Tail), is an unblinking look at the hardboiled authors (including Cain, Goodis, Thompson and Woolrich) who went to Hollywood to make their fortunes but more often than not found failure and addiction. Their lives are as dark and compelling as their stories.\n\nNorman Goodman\n\nLondon\n\nTake a walk with Iain Sinclair and you never know who you will meet or what will happen. Going to the Edge of the Orison (Hamish Hamilton) and making those connections with John Clare was a moving bonus. The first world war has once again sparked a superb and compelling novel, A Long Long Way by Sebastian Barry (Faber), which brought to me a fresh and overwhelmingly poignant story. An impulsive buy, Persian Fire by Tom Holland (Little, Brown), turned out to be one of my best. I was lost in the flowing narrative, which brings together characters and events I had previously known only through disjointed snippets of legend and half-known history. I rarely buy anthologies but have just discovered A Bedside Book of Birds by Graeme Gibson (Bloomsbury) and it's a gem. This garnering of writings from across time and cultures, together with the equally diverse sumptuous and stunning images, is full of pleasures. But, alas, no John Clare.\n\nAnthony C Hyland\n\nYork\n\nOwen Sheers' The Dust Diaries (Faber) vividly evokes the arid landscape of Zimbabwe and the social complexities of life in that country over the past 100 years and sensitively introduces the author's eccentric great-uncle, the poet, mystic and missionary, Arthur Shearly Cripps.\n\nJenepher Hawkins\n\nChelmsford\n\nThree non-fiction choices for devotees of history and biography: William Pitt the Younger by William Hague (Harper Perennial) is a lively and well-researched account of our youngest prime minister. Enlightening about the political skills that enabled him to hold office for 22 years, it also sympathetically reveals his more human and fallible side; bad luck in love, drink and debts contributed to his early death.\n\nThe Great Arc by John Keay (HarperCollins), the adventurous story of the mapping of India by intrepid 19th-century British engineers. Beset by disease and accidents, they fought their way through jungles and over mountains, improvising the most delicate instruments as they went; not surprising that the operation took nearly 50 years to complete.\n\nNot Quite the Diplomat by Chris Patten (Allen Lane) is a thought-provoking analysis of international relations, based on the author's recent post as European Commissioner for External Relations. From Bosnia to Korea via the Balkans and Middle East, Patten uses his experiences to reflect on the future, making his considered opinions most convincing.\n\nMartin Jones\n\nEastbourne\n\nJonathan Coe's marvellous Like a Fiery Elephant (Picador) did what a good literary biography should: it inspired me to spend the summer reading its subject's novels. BS Johnson cuts the figure of a working-class polymath: at home in the press box of a football stadium, a Hungarian university or in the company of Samuel Beckett. Johnson is the ultimate outsider, retching his way through a North Sea fishing expedition (Trawl), hitch-hiking through a long-gone Britain, horrified by the human condition (The Unfortunates) and disconnected from those who loved him despite his fieriness. I was hooked through Coe's enthusiasm and empathy for a man who could by turns be generous, intellectual, melancholy or despair-inducing.\n\nSue Keable\n\nCambridge\n\nOur Hidden Lives by Simon Garfield (Ebury Press) is an absolutely un-put-downable collection of diaries kept by ordinary people at the end of the second world war and on into peacetime. The diarists never meet but their stories are woven into a fascinating gem: a true insight into Britain's post-war days.\n\nAnne Keenan\n\nBelfast\n\nI read Roisin McAuley's first novel Singing Bird (Headline) and was hooked after the first page. It tells the story of Lena Molloy, who goes in search of her adopted daughter's natural mother after she receives a phone call from a nun, one-time supervisor of a home for unmarried mothers in Ireland, who helped arrange the adoption 27 years earlier. The story starts off in England and moves to the south of Ireland. The narrative is beautifully written and moves at a brisk pace. I have also read Meeting Point (Headline) by the same author, which starts off near Nice and moves to the north Antrim coast, combining romance, suspense, intrigue and a gripping plot.\n\nJ Kirkwood\n\nTyne and Wear\n\nAnn Wroe's Perkin (Vintage) - a biography of Perkin Warbeck - is a gripping historical mystery about much more than the princes in the Tower. The author combines an ability to track the movements of individuals dead for 500 years with a sharp eye for detail. Then, 500 pages in, detective work presents the reader with a piece of information that casts everything that has gone before in a fresh light, and implies a shocking betrayal.\n\nNick Lacey\n\nShipley, W Yorks\n\nBob Dylan's Chronicles: Volume One (Pocket Books) was brilliantly written and gave an insight into the creative process of one of the musical talents of the 20th century. Those who complained that Dylan remained an enigma missed the point that the creative process is an enigma to the man. Dylan appears in Mark Kurlansky's 1968: The Year That Rocked The World (Vintage), a fantastically narrated history of the year. Kurlansky weaves the disparate threads into a comprehensive snapshot of a momentous 365 days. Finally, Ian McEwan's Saturday (Cape) condensed into a day many of the concerns of the English bourgeoisie of the 21st century. Gripping and convincing, McEwan has developed into the most interesting novelist in Britain.\n\nTerry Lempriere\n\nWarrington, Cheshire\n\nMemoir by John McGahern (Faber) is a beautifully told account of a childhood in Ireland where the parents live largely apart and the growing up is laced with deeply tragic but surprisingly uplifting experiences. The book brought greater understanding of the writer's fiction.\n\nAndrew McCallum\n\nTottenham, London\n\nWhy isn't Ronan Bennett's Havoc in its Third Year (Headline Review) at the top of everybody's reading list? Devour this tale of 17th-century religious persecution and marvel at how Bennett gives contemporary relevance to age-old religious conflict. For a pertinent reminder of England's more recent past, Julian Maclaren-Ross's Selected Stories (Dewi Lewis Publishing) reveals a seedier underbelly to the mid-20th century than many would imagine, particularly his tales of wartime chaos and incompetence. Peter Schneider's newly translated The Wall Jumper (Penguin) about the follies of the Berlin wall has a tone similar to MacLaren-Ross's - gentle observations masking satirical swipes at life's absurdities. And if you prefer your satire on the harsh side then Bret Easton Ellis's Lunar Park (Picador) marks a return to form for the master of literary shock and awe. Stunningly original the book may be, but don't believe the critics who say it is his best yet - American Psycho cannot be beaten.\n\nVictoria Machin\n\nManchester\n\nIn October, I had a bit of a Linus moment. Instead of a blanket, I found myself a comfort book - Zadie Smith's On Beauty (Hamish Hamilton). I never got into White Teeth and so had let The Autograph Man pass me by, but - being a sucker for a pretty picture - there was something that drew me to Smith's tale of academic and family politics. At the end it felt as though I had eaten a box of rose creams - a warm sense of self-indulgence coupled with the regret that you'd finished so quickly and that none was left. Other highlights of 2005 include Simone de Beauvoir's fascinatingly detailed rendering of her early adulthood, The Prime of Life (Penguin). Finally, I must thank the friend who sent me Percival Everett's Erasure (Faber), a wry look at the literary world's attitude to race.\n\nRobert McNeil\n\nEdinburgh\n\nRosa Steppanova moved to Shetland from Germany and soon started to recreate the much-loved family garden of her Bavarian childhood. Normally, little grows in Shetland; the soil is poor and the largely treeless landscape battered by salty storms. But, in The Impossible Garden (The Shetland Times), Rosa recounts with great charm and a wealth of anecdote how, over many years, she struggled to establish a beautiful arcadia that is now open to the public. Cats and art, as well as plants, abound in a magical place where the wild elements are kept at bay.\n\nAdam Nightingale\n\nMilton Keynes\n\nMy book of the year is Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go (Faber). Ishiguro is usually cool, spare and enigmatic to the end, and while this is no exception, Never Let Me Go is an unbearably moving novel that broke my heart. Tackling the controversial and topical subject of genetic cloning, it doesn't flinch from the terrifying ramifications. I wept for the last 40 pages. A serious matter handled responsibly.\n\nOn a different tack, I also loved Niven Govinden's We Are The New Romantics (Bloomsbury). Witty, sharp and effortlessly readable, I devoured it in two evenings. Fizzy with pop-cultural references (even the jacket blurb quotes The Smiths) and chock-full of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll (or house and disco at least), you could mistake it for a well-written beach read, were it not for the intelligent handling of the nature of friends and relationships.\n\nAyo Onatade\n\nLondon\n\nMy favourite crime novels this year include The Snack Thief by Andrea Camilleri (Picador), featuring Sicilian detective Inspector Montalbano. He is sardonic, strong-willed, impetuous, eccentric, stubborn and driven by a strong morality, and most of his methods barely conform to what is seen as correct police procedure. The Galleon's Grave: Henry Gresham and the Spanish Armada by Martin Stephen (Time Warner Books) is a good historical romp about intrigue and deviousness in the court of Elizabeth I and the Spanish Armada. My favourite book of the year, however, is The Black Angel by John Connolly (Hodder & Stoughton). A dark, beautifully written tale that is as shocking as it is mesmerising.\n\nGail Riekie\n\nAberdeen\n\nBill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything (Black Swan), now available in paperback, is a hugely entertaining read. The science is made clear for the layman and the anecdotes about the discoveries and the people involved are engrossing to those of us familiar with the basic science. Another new paperback, Richard Dawkins's The Ancestor's Tale (Phoenix mass market), would be a wonderfully stimulating present for a reader who has enjoyed Bryson's book and is ready to tackle some more meaty science. In this lively synthesis of genetics and evolutionary theory, Dawkins gratifyingly never misses the opportunity for a swipe at proponents of the nonsense of so-called intelligent design. As a final suggestion, less well known than the other two, I recommend Venomous Earth by Andrew Meharg (Palgrave Macmillan), although perhaps a book on arsenic poisoning through the ages might be a dangerous gift for anyone suffering from over-exposure to the more difficult members of their family over the festive period.\n\nKatharine Sathe\n\nLondon\n\nI am half-way through Nicholas Ostler's Empires of the Word: a Language History of the World (HarperCollins), and have never had such a soaring, panoramic view of how language history evolves. It should be essential reading not only for anyone who wonders where words come from but for any student of early history.\n\nHarriet O'Donovan Sheehy\n\nDalkey, County Dublin\n\nInexplicably, until last year I had read nothing by Julian Barnes. Fortunately, however, Penguin chose him to select and write the introduction to a new collection of stories by my late husband Frank O'Connor, My Oedipus Complex and Other Stories. This convinced me he was a writer about whom I wanted to know more. Now I have read almost everything he has written. What a pleasure that has been. What a writer he is! Quirky, multi-faceted, profound, laugh out loud funny, highly intelligent and deeply empathic. It is hard to choose my favourite book but A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters, Staring at the Sun (both Picador) and Arthur & George (Jonathan Cape) would be in close contention.\n\nAndrew Shirley\n\nTooting, South London\n\nI only noticed Home by Tim Relf (Piatkus Books) because it had a cute dog on the cover. But I recommend it for a different reason. For someone like me, who moved from flat to flat in their 20s, it really strikes a chord, exploring where home is - and what it means - through the experiences of a man forced to move back in with his parents when their marriage hits hard times. What's intended as a weekend visit turns protracted when he discovers his dad's having an affair and his mum's having a breakdown. If this all sounds a bit grim, don't worry. It's hilarious - especially if you've experience of what life in the sticks is like. This is a book about identity. A book about the best and worst of families. A book about what it's like to be 30-something in the 21st century.\n\nDDR Thorpe\n\nBanbury, Oxon\n\nThree highly original books from this past year illuminate contrasting aspects of our recent past. David Reynolds's In Command of History (Penguin), in which the Cambridge professor of international history dissects, admires and, at times, excoriates the methodology of the six-volume history of the second world war by Winston Churchill and his many researchers, is an invaluable and necessary addition to the Churchill bibliography. Dominic Sandbrook's Never Had It So Good (Little, Brown) also demolishes many deeply engrained and inaccurate myths, in this case about the Macmillan years and the advent of so-called \"swinging\" Britain. In Speaking for England (Free Press), David Faber has written a sparkling biographical triptych on Churchill's contemporary, the Tory grandee Leo Amery and his two sons, Julian and John, the former a war hero, Macmillan's son-in-law and government minister, the latter a condemned traitor who was hanged at the end of the war.\n\nKenneth Till\n\nLydeard St Lawrence, Somerset\n\nIn 2005 I enjoyed many biographies but none more so than an unpublicised book that was more the story of an object - the semaphore line, or optical telegraph - and the people for whom it had great significance: Send It By Semaphore by Howard Mallinson (The Crowood Press). This early device for rapid communication, initially developed in France, was quickly recognised by Napoleon as a weapon for outwitting the English. Only the Royal Navy, together with the land forces that they safely escorted to the Continent, prevented French victory. The story is exciting and develops like a thriller, told with infectious enthusiasm."
