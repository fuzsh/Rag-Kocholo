        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a lecture given in commemoration of Thomas Henry Huxley* on December 14, 2007, anthropologist Adam Kuper of Brunel University, UK, declared that the original sin of anthropology was to divide the world into civilized and savage (Kuper 2008: 717). He was concerned with young Charles Darwin’s unfavorable reactions in 1833 to observing the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego. Kuper added: To compare civilized and primitive is to compare two imaginary conditions (720; see also Kuper 2005).\n\nObviously, the underlying framework of thought has been lingering on in surrogate terminology until the present, and has been a long-term impediment to the social sciences and the study of culture. Anthropologists still conceptualize grades of societal complexity; some assume that Western societies are individualistic and African societies, by contrast, rigidly community oriented. In the mid-twentieth century, Claude Lévi-Strauss (who celebrated his 100th birthday on November 28, 2008, before he died Oct. 30, 2009) once divided world cultures into hot and cold, one supposed to be dynamic, the other stagnant. Since Marcel Mauss’s concept of reciprocité in L’Essai sur le don (1925), the game of binary concept formation—also in Lévi-Strauss’s the Raw and the Cooked (1964)—has been irresistible, and not only in French intellectual circles. H. C. Triandis (1990) created the opposition tight cultures versus loose cultures; and Ulf Hannertz (1992), trying to avoid primitive, traditional, etc., came up with the notion of small-scale communities.\n\nAll these schemes tend to lump together, in the abstract, the alleged behavior of millions of people, drawing artificial dividing lines through humanity. In essence, many of these schemes of thought are based on a hidden formula Marshall Sahlins (1976: 216) identified as The West and the Rest. The West and those who are aspiring to be or to become part of its economic hegemony are self-classifying as dynamic, enterprising, market-oriented, individualistic, etc., while the Rest is supposed to be a world apart, variously described as third, even fourth, and thought to be stagnant, rural, overly dependent on tradition, collectivistic, folkloristic—developing.\n\nThere is no question that such conceptualizations have affected approach and methodology in cultural research, including the study of music, besides their psychological effect upon those who were the object of such research, with ensuing political consequences some generations later. Until recently, these concepts have been an ever-present undercurrent in popular discourse about culture. The dichotomy individualistic versus collectivistic often translates in music research into a tenacious belief that music in Africa is primarily a community expression, rigidly attached to social events and ultimately a product of an ethnic creative spirit with few individual composers to be traced, e.g., the mbira of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. Rooted in fragmentary observations across time and space, such beliefs ignore the tremendous investment of individual self-training, contemplation, and organizational talent that is necessary for acquiring instrumental skills, constructing vocal polyphonies, and organizing performance. It is something completely different from activating a cellphone or an electric switch.\n\nI am making these superfluous remarks to remind us that we ought to pay attention to the kind of ideological background glow that may have negatively affected the study of transatlantic cultural exchanges from the sixteenth to the twenty-first centuries. We can only be successful in our endeavor if we learn not only to focus on group phenomena but also on individual contribution and achievement in all the cultures concerned. Luckily, when I began to do field research in Africa in 1959, my previous familiarity with some of the exigencies of jazz performance, and the life histories of its cultural carriers, made me seek individual instruction in Africa from the beginning, by Evaristo Muyinda in Uganda and by Duro and Gboyega Ladipọ in Nigeria. Indirectly, and nonverbally at that time—purely through personal behavior—I declared my defiance of all unilinear and binary schemes aimed at dividing us.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of Africa as a repository of stagnant, age-old traditions had in fact already been shattered. Archaeologists such as Frank Willet in Nigeria, historians, and linguists had begun to patch together a dynamic picture of Africa’s cultural history. The study of musical genres and the individual works of their exponents was important in unraveling the dynamics behind stability and change, as well as identifying intra-African streams of influence, besides trans–Indian Ocean contacts (Alpers 1975) and those across the Atlantic.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nJazz Transatlantic is essentially a culture-contact and syncretist project. The prefix trans- means across and implies crossing as a process. Along imaginary trajectories we are then crossing and recrossing the Atlantic in different directions and historical periods in pursuit of a music termed jazz, from Africa to America and back. Indeed, it is this theme of crossing and recrossing that is central to this book. I am focusing on something that spreads, and that thing is more than sound; it includes language, and with it concepts, world views, beliefs, experiences, attitudes, commodities, and what is most important: knowledge and expertise.\n\nIn a 1971/72 article under the title Jazz—the round trip, Atta Annan Mensah alluded to the image of someone having purchased a roundtrip ticket upon departure from Africa to New World destinations, with the intention of coming back one day. Whether it takes the form of a search for cultural roots or for one’s personal genealogy, the fact is that by whatever pressures the original migration may have come about—economic constraints, slavery, kidnapping, curiosity, desire for adventures—there remains something unspoken that binds immigrants to the lands where their ancestors came from. And the great-grandchildren of those who have remained behind in the countries of origin, by fortune or design, are sometimes ready to welcome back the offspring of those who have been lost. In southeast Africa there is a verb in the Cinyanja/Chichewa language, kutchona, describing the state of being hooked up in foreign lands, getting stuck somewhere without thinking of returning. In a song composed in 1978 by Daniel Kachamba, Kutchona Bambo (Getting hooked up, Man!) such a state is described in the context of labor migration to South Africa.*\n\nObviously, Jazz Transatlantic has a certain span of meanings to be covered. One is the implicit reference to a multilateral historical process involving jazz. The music we call jazz has been a transatlantic phenomenon from its start, and it was the result of a constant flux and reflux of ideas embedded in contemporaneous late nineteenth-century musical events in Europe, Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere. This exchange started long before the famous 1893 World’s Fair Columbian Exposition in Chicago that brought musical troupes from Dahomey, the Middle East, and many other places to the United States. To separate jazz history from related developments on the other side of the Atlantic is therefore ill-advised.\n\nIn the 1920s a first reaction to jazz, by many musicians and composers rooted in the Western classical tradition, was to consider it a fascinating aberration from normal musical practice that meant always playing from written scores. Anything else was fake music, and so was jazz. But they hailed the apparent syncopation. It was also thought to be characteristic of jazz that the so-called weak parts of a 4/4 meter were to be accented. And certain notes sounded to the observers like minor thirds over a major chord. Those apparent deviations from Western tonality came to be called blue notes.\n\nUnfortunately, these assessments derive from heavy reinterpretation of unfamiliar phenomena. Actually, accents in jazz can fall on any point of the meter, on or off-beat, depending on the rhythmic shape of the voice lines. The beat can be organized incorporating sound accents, e.g., on 2 and 4, or no accents at all. And the so-called blue notes are not meant by blues singers to be deviations from anything; they are the hidden legacy of another, non-Western tonal system with cognates in some areas of the West African savannah, even in East Africa.\n\nA good auditory demonstration example of this background is Charlie Parker’s instrumental blues performance with John Lewis on piano in his composition Parker’s Mood recorded in New York, September 18, 1948. There is an introductory frame in minor, then Parker’s theme and variations in the twelve-bar blues form.\n\nHidden in Parker’s discourse is the blues tonal system, which is related to African tonal systems that are based on the exploration of partials over a single fundamental. Parker on his alto sax was acutely aware of partials, up to partial 11 at 551 cents, which in the mold of Western tunings can be rendered approximately as a flatted fifth, an interval important in bebop. It is therefore erroneous to link the harmonic structure of his music to Arnold Schönberg or others whom Parker professed to have been an inspiration for him. Rhythmically, there is no such thing as syncopation; Parker evolves his discourse over two simultaneous referential pulse-lines, one dividing the beat by three, the other by four. Accents can fall on any point of either pulse-line, depending on the structure of the melodic phrase to be articulated.\n\nGenerally, in jazz there are three simultaneous reference levels of timing. These are shared with most African music. The first (a) is what we now call the elementary pulsation or fastest pulse, which is like an infinite string of minimal time-units. Sometimes two elementary pulse-lines in a certain ratio, e.g., 3:4, are simultaneously present and integrated in the mind for the musician to shift between. Next (b) is the beat or gross-pulse which is simply the dance beat for the audience, if they want to follow it. And finally (c) is the length of the cycle. In African music short cycles dominate; in jazz it is the twelve-bar blues form, the AABA chorus form, and other forms. A jazz musician developing his improvisatory art navigates within all three reference levels, without actually thinking about them; they are only present subliminally. More consciously he is aware of the sequence of chord changes within the cycle, unless of course the themes are modal (as in some work of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, etc.), or even based on just one fundamental (as in some blues by Ornette Coleman). All this is internalized early, when learning to improvise. It then operates in the mind like an auto-pilot, so that a soloist would never go astray, whatever rhythmic or harmonic disorientation effects are run up by his partners.\n\nSuch audio-psychological facts, however, were not yet understood by analysts in the early twentieth century. Even the renowned musicologist Erich Moritz von Hornbostel was at a loss for coming to terms with basics in jazz when he first heard it in the 1920s. And yet it was he who earlier had identified what he called neutral thirds in recordings on wax cylinders brought by Günter Tessmann (1913) from Cameroon. Hornbostel acknowledged the existence of specific African tonal systems based on principles different from those of the Western scale.\n\nIn some areas of Africa, not only may neutral thirds appear in instrumental tunings, but there may be tuning systems that incorporate thirds of different size that clash—if you wish, major and minor—such as I recorded in a mourning song by a Tikar-speaking woman in central Cameroon in February 1964. She was accompanied by a man in Chief Ngambe’s entourage playing a five-string polyidiochord stick zither, tuned pentatonically but incorporating one narrow interval (Track 27 on the CD accompanying the Italian edition of Africa and the Blues, Kubik 1999a [2007]).\n\nIn spite of the great variety of expressive forms that we associate with jazz history, the music’s tonality and organization has remained part of an African culture world. This is not to downgrade the share of other musical cultures in fueling and refueling the creative process in the historical rise of different jazz styles, nor does it deny the status of jazz as an intrinsically American development. But it is evident from the bulk of our historical data that innovative stimuli have originated primarily with those artists in the United States (and more recently also in southern Africa) who in one way or another have carried on concepts and aesthetics from African music. Such understanding corroborates the composer George Lewis’s idea of an historically afrological character of jazz and other African American music. Jazz can be composed and performed by anyone who has learned its vernacular, but from the moment one is successful—irrespective of one’s place of birth, genealogy, and social background—he or she has irrevocably changed one’s personal cultural profile, and now belongs to the jazz culture, so to say. George Shearing, Lennie Tristano, tenor saxophonist Winston Mankunku Ngozi from South Africa, and many others—with their birth places scattered around the globe—all equally belong to it, as much as Jay McShann and John Coltrane.\n\nI might perhaps elaborate a bit on what I have said elsewhere: that we no longer think of individuals having a lifelong cultural identity conferred upon them by the communities in which they grow up. Socio-psychological studies suggest that no one is actually nailed down to a culture, let alone to membership in an ethnic group, although social pressure demanding conformist behavior can be intense.\n\nNot only do we change our personalities gradually during lifetime, we also change our cultural allegiances, as a result of learning. The transformation begins with contacts outside the individual’s earliest social environment, and particularly with learning other languages. Therefore, we speak today of a person’s momentary, transient cultural profile* rather than cultural identity.\n\nIn some persons this profile is subject to incisive changes during their lives, particularly if they constantly widen their contacts, or migrate somewhere else, or just travel a lot. This new model also makes superfluous earlier concepts relating to music, such as bimusicality, because any additional knowledge or skill acquired by the individual is integrated with all previous experiences and learning. Benny Goodman playing swing and also Mozart on his clarinet was not bi-musical. He simply expressed his personal affiliations, which happened to include swing, Mozart, and some other classical stuff, as much as Bunk Johnson expressed his, which included ragtime and blues, two very different traditions.\n\nThe study of European classical and contemporary art music, and by extension the adaptations of American jazz within that realm, is therefore also a legitimate part of transatlantic exploration. This has actually been well-covered in musicology. Jazz harmony has been studied intensively from the viewpoint of Western music theory—implicitly, however, subscribing to the idea that it is all based on European harmonic traditions. Jazz musicians in Europe have also been the subject of intensive stylistic and biographical work, including Django Reinhardt, George Shearing, or Albert Mangelsdorff. The Jazz Institute in Darmstadt, Germany, has devoted an entire volume to jazz in its interaction worldwide with other musical traditions, in short, jazz in global perspective (The World Meets Jazz, Knauer ed. 2008). In Chicago, the Center for Black Music Research (CMBR), under the directorship of Samuel A. Floyd Jr., carried out an extensive survey of the relationships, analogies, and common logic of African American musical styles in the United States and in the Caribbean. A broad panel of relationships was identified at the CBMR conference in Miami, June 9–11, 2000, on Music and Linguistics in the Caribbean and Other African Diaspora Cultures. Maureen Warner Lewis of the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, gave an answer to the important question why it was that in the Americas, certain long-dormant Africanisms would often erupt suddenly and be creatively used in new musical or other artistic manifestations. She stressed that the so-called Africanisms are often transmitted within small groups, even just families, without people in the mainstream culture being aware of their existence. Then at some stage in history, conditions can become favorable, and suddenly some of these traits in hiding surface to broader public awareness. Lewis presented her observations as an alternative to the popular hypothesis of cultural memory. She stressed that many African traits in New World cultures had survived somewhere on the periphery of the mainstream culture until, at some point in history, they made it to the center.\n\nIn our research we have combined historical methodology with participant observation, enhanced by psychological argument involving both audio-psychology and the psychology of culture contact. We will point to family resemblances between musical styles across the Atlantic, as first conceptualized by my good friend, the late Ernest Brown. In fact, there are many hidden family relationships. We want to get a glimpse of the subliminal, how the human mind operates when creating new forms of expression, connecting between them, musically and extra-musically.\n\nRecently, in a preface to Freddi Williams Evans’s book Congo Square (2010), J. H. Kwabena Nketia has shared with us some of his experiences in 1958 when he first came to the United States and into contact with African American cultural expressions, in Harlem and later in so called storefront churches in Chicago, where Melville J. Herskovits was taking him. He points out that there are areas of instant understanding between adherents to African and African American cultures and that the relationship between African and African American cultures is on a deeper level than their surface manifestations, and that what needs to be identified are the deep structures or the roots that generate the surface features as well as the specific roles, functions, and meanings assigned to them (x). He cites jazz musician Max Roach’s three-month stay in Ghana studying drumming and xylophone music, and emphasizes that Roach’s intention was not to go back to America and reproduce what he learned. On the contrary, his interest lay in acquiring a better sense of the organization and generative processes of this music which he could use creatively in his own way (x). The same, of course, can be said about European composer György Ligeti (1923–2006), who was deeply interested in the composition techniques of the court music of the Kingdom of Buganda (cf. Ligeti’s interview in Die Zeit, Feuilleton, 57, no. 5, 1988) but never plagiarized the music.\n\nDuring the last few decades the geographical range of field research in African and African American cultures has been considerably widened. While our much revered predecessors were focusing at the most on four to five different geographical areas in their data gathering—Melville J. and Francis Herskovits on Surinam, northeastern Brazil, Dahomey, Haiti, etc., or Nicholas G. J. Ballanta on Liberia, the US, and West African coastal traditions—our generation has been fortunate to work in a multitude of societies comparatively, widening the geographical coverage. I myself, with associated researchers on numerous fieldtrips, notably Maurice Djenda, Fortunato Pereira Gonçalves, Mario Ruy de Rocha Matos, Helmut Hillegeist, Donald Kachamba, Kayombo kaChinyeka, Moya and Lidiya Malamusi, Mose Yotamu, and others, have made some twenty-eight thousand field recordings in eighteen African countries over a span of fifty-three years. This collection is considerably larger than anything one could have accomplished in the 1930s and 40s with the equipment then available. In addition to our African field recordings, three of us have covered parts of Brazil, a bit of Venezuela, and in the 1990s it was possible for Moya A. Malamusi and me to work with David Evans, University of Memphis, who took us on joint field trips to the southern United States. Besides our studies of the jazz and blues literature in the library of the CBMR in Chicago in 1997,* these trips were an essential experience resulting in my book Africa and the Blues (1999a).\n\nUsing this database we can now reconstruct historical sequences. Sometimes we can also do so through the comparative study of artifacts and instrument-making technology. There are large collections of African musical instruments in museums around the world, comprising specimens from the early nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. They testify to tremendous technological expertise and power of innovation. I have carried out one such study on lamellophones, variously called mbira, nsansi, or kalimba, which constitute one of the most important African instrumental inventions in history (Kubik 1998d, 1999b, 2002a). The study included some New World derivatives, from nineteenth-century Brazilian specimens that are preserved in the Völkerkunde Museum, Vienna, and in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, to the ubiquitous Caribbean marimbula.\n\nThis wealth of information made me realize that there are certain pathways in human creativity that display remarkable resilience, while some others are experimental, even ephemeral, but may yet be pursued further by later generations. It is important to sort that out systematically, case by case, and prognosticate rates of survival.\n\nIn the realm of tuning systems, for example, we found that partials-based tonal systems, such as occur in certain musical cultures of the West African savannah, or in East Africa among the Wagogo and in South Africa, are particularly resilient. In a situation of culture contact they tend to impose their structures on other tonal worlds, subverting them. That happened in the United States in the late nineteenth century, leading to the blues; and it has also happened independently in the rise of mbaqanga and modern jazz in South Africa.\n\nAmong the traits of considerable resilience in African music, there is also the ubiquitous call-and-response organization in many musical genres, as well as other polyphonic devices: riff patterning, parallelism, interlocking, etc. Further, there is the general tendency to independent phrasings of melodic accents in songs, following speech patterns by stringing words and sentences according to the principle of one syllable per elementary pulse-unit, irrespective of the underlying meter or dance beat. This is very different from the formation of Greek verse, for example. It results in accents that cross the beat, off beat phrasing of melodic accents, as first described by Richard A. Waterman in 1952. These age-old developments in the music of sub-Saharan Africa are shared with jazz.\n\nThe same applies to an audio-psychological phenomenon such as swing, so important in various definitions of jazz. Swing is age-old in African music, but it is an effect only aimed at in certain African musical styles. It is not a universal phenomenon in the music of sub-Saharan Africa. Possibly swing as a kinemic-auditory phenomenon was first discovered in early West African savannah agricultural societies through women’s work, such as grinding millet. Archaeology and genetic research of plants suggest that millet agriculture (sorghum, pearl millet, etc.) and that of other African cereals developed ca. 5000–1000 BCE, according to J. E. G. Sutton, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Ghana, Legon (cf. map in Murray 1981: 43). That gives swing a possible time span.\n\nA recording I made by chance in a remote area of central Cameroon on February 14, 1964, demonstrates this kind of integration of voice and work rhythm. In a lonely hamlet on a thirty-kilometer walk through the savannah in the company of one youngster, we bumped into a Tikar-speaking mother with her child, as she was kneeling on the veranda of her house while grinding maize (in earlier times it was millet), and singing a song of complaint in blues-like tonality. Tremendous swing was emerging from the accents in her grinding rhythm. It was the result of sound kicks that fell on the last elementary pulse-unit of each series of triplets. I have discussed her song in greater detail elsewhere (Kubik 1999a: 73–78).\n\nHistorically connected with rhythmic organization that generates swing is a second principle of construction in some African music, which may have originated from work division in pounding, when two, sometimes three women gather around a mortar with their pestles, and strike alternately while sharing a song. I recorded one example among the Chamba in northeastern Nigeria in 1963 (Kubik 2010: 11; CD track 3). Each singer relates the song’s accents to her own pestle strokes, thereby operating from a relative, individual reference beat. This is probably how the interlocking technique, found in many African xylophone styles and some drumming (first documented by A. M. Jones in Northern Rhodesia in 1934; Jones 1949), may have originated in remote history. It actually takes only a short evolutionary step to transfer the millet-pounding organization of strokes to drumming and log xylophone playing in duple- or triple-division interlocking style. If the alternating strokes combine to suggest a cycle of twelve or twenty-four underlying pulse-units, with accents anticipating the song’s dance beat, the result is a lilting effect in the rhythmic structure that swings.\n\nAlso from savannah communities in Cameroon is an example I recorded in 1964 of another kind of music generating an enormous feeling of swing. Omaru Sanda, a musician at the court of Vute Chief Emtse, created variations on a large timbrh raffia-manufactured lamellophone by using his thumbs in a fast, alternating left/right movement, always sounding two adjacent lamellae at once with the same thumb. The lamellae were tuned in octave pairs. However, what one hears (and that is universal, it does not depend on one’s cultural background) is far from a mere rippling of fast notes; it is something the performer has not played, although he designed the structure so that such an effect would emerge. The total image of his playing action splits into auditory patterns perceptible at different pitch levels. For the audience it is as if two to three independent, interwoven melodic-rhythmic lines were coming up in the variations, one in the bass, another in the middle range, another in the higher pitch range. This is the so-called inherent pattern (i.p.) effect, which I have described on various occasions (Kubik 2010: 11: 107–30) as an audio-psychological illusion effect, aimed at and explored by various African music composers. As a compositional device it is concentrated in southern Uganda (e.g., xylophone music in Buganda and Busoga), but also is found among the Tikar and Vute chief musicians in central Cameroon, and in some other places of Africa. Many people have been amazed at Omaru Sanda’s performance, whenever I play those recordings in lectures. People cannot believe that it is generated by a single person with only two thumbs (Track 5, CD in Castagneto ed. 2007).\n\nLooking at jazz from the background of our African data opens up a special terrain of research. On several occasions in these books I will invite readers to time-travel from Africa to the United States and back, learning about a Ghanaian brass band instructor, visiting nineteenth-century New Orleans on the trail of Marie Laveau, and delving into a photographic riddle concerning Buddy Bolden’s only known picture taken of him and his band around 1900. Much of the space available will be devoted to a presentation of our own field research as it relates to the topic and to attempted historical reconstructions.\n\nIt is not possible to cover all the fascinating topics relating to the transatlantic approach in two books. This particularly concerns the second part of Mensah’s round trip: the return of African American music to Africa, not only jazz but a great variety of genres. Calypso records were already on sale in the former Gold Coast during the 1920s. From the 1940s to the 1960s, jazz proper caused reverberations in nearly all urban areas of Africa, but was soon eclipsed by the much stronger impact of other African American genres: rumba, pachanga, chachacha, and merengue in Central Africa; the twist in eastern and southern Africa during the early 1960s, etc. Soul music, especially by the Godfather James Brown, conquered several West African cities in the 1970s and ’80s as a result of his tours, and reggae as well as Rastafarian culture have left a permanent mark in southern Africa and elsewhere.\n\nTo be accurate, however, it is fair to say that, in terms of mass audiences, jazz had a spotty presence in most parts of Africa, even at the height of its worldwide popularity after 1945—with the exception of South Africa. There, the impact was particularly strong. Elsewhere it was usually celebrated and studied by small circles of fans and urban musicians with access to jazz records and instruments, such as in Dakar and St. Louis, Senegal, where an annual jazz festival was initiated in the 1960s and is still held. Other such places were Addis Ababa in Ethiopia (Falceto 2001) and Accra in Ghana (Feld 2012), particularly after Louis Armstrong’s 1956 visit. And yet the word jazz is almost universally current in Africa, though often with decisively altered connotations.\n\nAs to those fringe cases of the presence of jazz in Africa, they are now mostly history. If I listed them all, it would inflate our subject without adding essential information. Instead, I will concentrate in the second volume of Jazz Transatlantic (Mensah’s return or round trip) on southern Africa and South Africa in particular, where several forms of jazz, from swing to post-bop modern jazz have left an indelible historical mark and generated specific South African versions that were carried by personalities such as Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand), Winston Mankunku Ngozi, Duke Makasi, Gideon Nxumalo, and many others. The contribution by South African musicians to jazz history is significant and underlines the extent to which we may consider jazz to be part of a larger transatlantic family of musical styles.\n\nThe subject is not easy to tackle, however, as was pointed out by writer Lewis Nkosi in 1966 in a paper Jazz in Exile, published in the magazine Transition. Referring to Chris McGregor’s Blue Note quintet with Dudu Pukwana on alto sax and to a Johannesburg recording of his big band (Jazz—the African Sound, Gallotone/New Sound NSL 1011), especially to Pondo Blues, Nkosi points to some fructifying explorations of the indigenous African idiom. Mentioning what we would now call Short Cycle Form as a major contribution by South Africans to jazz, he emphasizes the existence of\n\na harmonic tension based on the overlapping of solo and chorus lines which may lead to the singing of two melodic lines simultaneously, and a very complex metric organization in which some beats are longer than others and accent is constantly being shifted, thus bringing about an element of frequent surprises for both players and dancers. For instance a song played in 4/4 time may suddenly seem to have shifted into 6/8 or 3/4. A number of South African jazz musicians are now going back to this African heritage for new ideas. It is interesting to note that by doing so they arrive at the same point where post-bop musicians like John Coltrane now find themselves though using different routes. (Nkosi 1966: 36)\n\nSuch analysis was already available in 1966 by a South African writer born 1936 in Durban, with engagement and intensive knowledge of jazz history.\n\nAs an illustration to Lewis Nkosi’s thesis, I will also focus in Jazz Transatlantic II on a group of musicians I have admired since 1969, when I first came across their music thanks to the late Irene Frangs, who used to frequent all jazz spots in Johannesburg, defying apartheid restrictions. The group was the Soul Jazzmen from Port Elizabeth, with Duke Makasi on tenor sax, Tete Mbambisa on piano, Psyche T. Ntsele on bass, and Mafufu Jama on drums. Their composition Inhlupeko, which means suffering or distress, is a precious example of how a mbaqanga cyclic theme was integrated into an AABA jazz form. This was post-bop jazz, in the tradition of John Coltrane, but with a remarkable South African tinge.*\n\nLewis Nkosi arrived at an interesting explanation of why jazz caught on so decisively in that part of Africa:\n\nThe industrial culture in South Africa especially, more than anywhere else on the continent of Africa, provides an ambiance where fusion between the Western and the African heritage has gone so far as to produce a new urban idiom. Mbaqanga, upon which South African modern jazzmen are constantly feeding, is really a fuslon of American jazz forms with some of these African strands I have enumerated. On any day in Johannesburg you can see shabby unemployed young Africans dancing on the pavements of the city to this jive music which is relayed by loudspeakers from inside record shops. If they survive the constant police raids, some of these kids, like Miriam Makeba, have gone on to conquer the world stage. (Nkosi 1966: 36)\n\nApart from the common African origins of much of their vocabulary and structure, all the expressions of jazz in Africa share transatlantic family relationships. Within that framework they are being created and re-created in never-ending contacts and exchanges.\n\n* Huxley (1825–1895) was a physical anthropologist in the vein of Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and other contemporaries.\n\n* I recall the late Daniel Kachamba’s composition only from our joint concert tour in 1978, after he first performed it at a concert in the town of Waiblingen, near Stuttgart, Germany, on September 1. The tour was organized by the Africa House of Arthur Benseler in Freiberg am Neckar. I was fascinated by a modulation Daniel had introduced in that composition, switching between two keys. The concert was privately recorded, probably by Roland Voitl, Tübingen, but it is not known whether the tapes still exist.\n\n* I first proposed this new model in 1992 at a conference in Miami organized by Gerard Béhague on so-called black ethnicity (Cf. Kubik 1994a: 17, 21).\n\n* We gratefully acknowledge that our work at the CBMR, Chicago in 1997 was carried out with a Rockefeller stipend. The Center hosted Moya A. Malamusi, two of his children, and me while in Chicago.\n\n* I am grateful to Diane Thram of the International Library of African Music, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa, for having copied for me the LP on which this title was first published in 1969.\n\nPART A\n\nJazz—The Word and Some Other Words\n\nIn 1960 cultural anthropologist Alan P. Merriam published an article under the title Jazz—The Word in Jazz Review, vol. 3, March–August. Decades later it was reprinted with some corrections, supplementary notes, and an updated bibliography (Merriam and Garner 1998: 7–31). Its principal objectives were (a) to examine the literature from 1917 to 1958 for ideas about the origin and meanings of the term jazz, and (b) to establish when the word was first used in connection with a specific type of music.\n\nSummaries dealing with some of these questions had appeared before, by Osgood (1926), Blesh and Janis (1950), and others. But it was Merriam who took the trouble to look through the earliest then available sources and systematically compare them. His survey begins with Walter Kingsley’s 1917 article Whence comes jass? Facts from the great authority on the subject in the New York Sun.\n\nScrutinizing the bibliography compiled by Merriam and Garner (1998), one is faced with the question of which are primary sources and which are not. The danger is always that one may give too much weight of credence to retrospective accounts, as compared to commentary from the period concerned, and also fall into the trap of mistaking secondary material—often diluted, heavily reinterpreted—for the original. The same applies, of course, to recorded music and, for example, to the ultimate source of the theme of Livery Stable Blues recorded by the Original Dixieland Jass Band for Victor in New York in 1917 (Charters 2008: 142–48). The controversy about copyright between Yellow Nunez and Nick La Rocca might even have an unaccountable twist, if it ever turned out that the theme and some basic variations had been borrowed from unknown musicians in New Orleans who were lacking the education or possibility of legal assistance to register and defend their legitimate claims.\n\nIn their article on sheet music and the commercial ascendancy of the blues (Evans 2008: 49–104), Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff have pointed out that US copyright laws were anathema to the creative process of folk-blues construction, which relied on the unrestricted recombination of commonly shared rhymes, metaphors, themes, etc. This was the contradiction that played out in the case of Livery Stable Blues. Ultimately it brought into question the very notion of copyright claims, if—in fact—oral tradition was so much involved. (On Livery Stable Blues see also Abbott and Seroff 2007.)\n\nAfter the first jazz recordings on disc appeared in 1917, there was a wave of anonymous commentary in periodicals such as the Literary Digest, the Music Trade Review, and Current Opinion about the new music. Both the music and the word stirred reactions, and one of the queries raised by those who were convinced of belonging to an advanced civilization was: Why ‘jazz’ sends us back to the jungle (Current Opinion 65: 165, September 1918). A mixture of factual observation and wild speculation made it into the media. One of the earliest substantial jazz commentaries was the article Jass and Jassism, which appeared in the June 20, 1918, edition of the New Orleans daily Times-Picayune, attracting many letters by readers.\n\nIn 1924 a movement gained momentum to abolish the word jazz because of undesirable by-meanings and immoral influence upon young people. Other words were proposed for its replacement, but none was adopted by the public. In the 1930s swing took over temporarily, investing itself into the then-current youth culture, just as jazz had done a generation earlier. In 1949 another attempt was made, this time by the editors of Down Beat, probably as a promotional gimmick, to replace the word jazz which in the meantime had gained new currency due to the New Orleans revival promoted by researchers in jazz history. It was in vain; the word jazz stayed on. But some of the other words proposed by those who wanted to get the thousand dollars offered for the winner of the contest survived into the future to become attached to new musical genres: hip → hip hop; freestyle → free jazz; beatpoint, beatfelt, etc. → beat music. Freestyle now refers to an improvisational type of rap. There was no trace in the proposals sent to Down Beat of a term like rock ’n’ roll, which would rise to prominence within the next few years, designating a blues-derived music with a strong appeal to the next young people’s generation.\n\nEarlier iterations of rocking, and rolling in relation to blues and gospel song, were, of course, plentiful (see the song index of Blues and Gospel Records 1890–1943), but Down Beat readers participating in the contest did not take up those leads. In the 1950s, some jazz terminology was adopted in rock ’n’ roll, such as doing the bop and Bopping the Blues, the title of a Carl Perkins rockabilly record.\n\nIn America and elsewhere, since 1917 the word jazz had conquered the sheet music and record market. In Europe the word jazz had also irrevocably caught on. Many writings in French, and the founding of the Hot Club de France in Paris in 1932, were instrumental in promoting the word. But its use was now restricted to what French jazz fans called le vrai jazz (the true jazz), in contrast to cheap commercialized alterations.\n\nEarliest Known Printed Sources\n\nBefore we proceed any further, it is important to lay bare—on the basis of present-day knowledge—where the earliest known printed sources of the word jazz can be found. Here something came up that was a surprise for jazz historians: (1) the earliest known printed appearance of the word was in connection with sports, not with music; (2) it was traced to newspapers in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and not to New Orleans or any other place in the South; (3) the word erupted all of a sudden in 1913 to become part of a quickly spreading sports jargon that was used by reporters on the West Coast with reference to baseball.\n\nEarly hints that the word was known on the West Coast had appeared in an anonymous article published in 1919 (cf. Merriam and Garner 1998: 22). This news received support in another anonymous article in 1924 (Etude 12: 517–18, 520; 595–96, August/September). Eventually, in 1939 a text by the noted San Francisco etymologist Peter Tamony clarified the matter:\n\nLate in February, 1913, the San Francisco Seals went into training at Boyes Springs.… Mr. Slattery, a sports editor, had heard the word jazz in craps games around San Francisco. It is a Creole word and means, in general, to speed up.… Mr. Slattery, with a sports-writer’s sense of the striking, began to use jazz as a synonym for ginger and pep. In a few days the novelty was taken up by other writers and the people around the camp, and was used in all descriptions. On the field the players were full of the old jazz, and there was jazz in the effervescent waters of the springs. Everything was jazzy, including the music Art Hickman played for the entertainment of the players and visitors.… The music he provided was his stylization of the ragtime of the day. It was an immediate hit. James Woods, manager of the Hotel St. Francis, heard Hickman while on a visit to Boyes. After Hickman opened at the St. Francis, national use of the word was only a matter of time. (1939: 5)\n\nHenry Osborne Osgood (1926: 18), in his book So This Is Jazz, referred to a panel of possible uses of the word jazz in San Francisco:\n\nSpeaking of different meanings, Ferdie Grofé … tells of a peculiar use of the word jazz in San Francisco, which does not seem to have obtained anywhere else. Out there in the years just preceding the War there were certain large and popular cafés which maintained orchestras and also a regular pianist, and gave cabaret performances, limited, however, to singing by young women. Each one had a solo to sing and occasionally they joined in an ensemble. They did not sing their solos from the stage where the pianist was stationed. It was part of their duties to mingle with the guests and join them at table. Whenever one of them heard the pianist begin the prelude to her number, she would rise wherever she happened to be and sing, but when the pianist decided it was time for an ensemble, he would announce, The next number will be jazz, and they would all troop back to the stage. There was no extra pepping up or rhythmic exaggeration in these choruses, and the word appears to have had no special significance as regards the music, simply meaning that it would be sung tutti instead of solo. (1926: 18)\n\nIn the periods after Merriam’s original 1960 article, research on the origins of the word did not come to a standstill. Some of the new findings have been summarized in chapter 1 of Lewis Porter’s book Jazz—A Century of Change (1997) under the title \"Where did the word jazz come from?\"\n\nIn a well-researched article, Our Word Jazz published in Storyville 50 (December/January 1973/74), Dick Holbrook, an expert in this field of study, gave credit to Peter Tamony for having found the earliest printed reference to the word in the San Francisco Bulletin, a daily newspaper, dated March 3, 1913, in a story by Edgar Scoop Gleeson on the sports pages, in which the latter was hailing the achievements of McCarl, a member of the San Francisco Seals baseball team. The word reappears again in Gleeson’s baseball stories throughout the month of March, albeit with no specific reference to music, except a casual mentioning of ragtime.\n\nVery soon, one of Gleeson’s colleagues, Ernest J. Hopkins, would produce a feature article on the new word jazz. Published in the San Francisco Bulletin on April 5, 1913, Hopkins begins by calling the word futuristic. He said that it had become current in the office of the San Francisco Bulletin to an extent that there were quarrels between the employees about its spelling, jazz or jaz, and that there were two factions on the staff violently opposed to each other. He gave a long list of related meanings to the word, from vigor, verve, virility, to happiness, and examples of its actual usage. It was then almost incessantly used in conversations about sports, and eventually about everything. The writer stressed that anything that takes manliness or effort or energy or activity or strength of soul is ‘jaz.’ He added: The sheer musical quality of the word, that delightful sound like the crackling of a brisk electric spark, commends it. It belongs to the class of onomatopoeia. It was important that this vacancy in our language should have been filled with a word of proper sound (quoted from Porter 1997: 7).\n\nHere one begins to prick one’s ears. If there was a vacancy to be filled in the English language, then jazz or jaz could not be English and should have arrived from somewhere, even from far away, perhaps from a tone language, because of its musical, even percussive quality (due to the buzzing z sound). That it was an onomatopoeic ideophone, as we would say today, was observed correctly. An ideophone is a short sound structure used symbolically to describe a state, an action, a manner, quality, idea, even a smell. As a denominator it operates outside grammar, and can be used as an adjective, verb, noun, or intensifier of any other verb. An ideophone can be monosyllabic like jaz, but also composed of several syllables, and many are onomatopoeic.\n\nThe use of such a word, almost overnight, by many people is a sure indicator of its novelty in the place concerned. It had started to be used in San Francisco that year in baseball reviews, expressing qualities of concentration and energy that experienced players had possessed in the past, but the present generation had still to acquire, in the sense of pep and enthusiasm. The old jazz was like a magic parcel that could get lost and then only jazzless San Francisco Seals would remain. But jazz might be brought back to them in a jazz wagon …\n\nHow the word got associated with music was discussed by the same sports writer E. T. Scoop Gleeson in an article published twenty-five years later in the San Francisco Call Bulletin, September 3, 1938. The popular band of Art Hickman, indelible in American music history and also mentioned in Peter Tamony’s account a year later, was performing ragtime-based music for dancers at Boyes Springs, where the San Francisco Seals then practiced. Apparently the word, which was associated with dice, was then applied to Hickman’s orchestra, which was described as the jazziest tune tooters in all the Valley of the Moon. Gleeson claimed that he remembered all this.\n\nRecently, researcher Lawrence Gushee (2005: 132, 299) has been intensively engaged in the search for the historical background of the word. He discovered in an April 1912 edition of the Los Angeles Times what seems to be the oldest written source testifying to the musical application of the term, still in the realm of baseball. And in 1913 a band going to play in the training camp for the San Francisco Seals was described as a jazz band. Bands that sit in the grandstands at sports events are still known as pep bands, David Evans tells me. Pep means sexual stamina, and more generally, energy (personal communication, May 10, 2012). So there is also this string of associations between jazz band and pep band with other implicit meanings.\n\nThe next series of sources in the chronology takes us to another city: Chicago, to where the word spread either from the West Coast shortly after 1913, or was already established there for some time and of other, unknown provenance. In interviews with members of Tom Brown’s Band, the New Orleans ragtime band that was invited to play in Chicago at Lamb’s Cafe in 1915, its cornetist, Ray Lopez (born 1889), reported half a century later how the word jass (in this spelling) had made its appearance that year. The musicians were used to calling what they played ragtime and blues (in the sense of slow drag). They were surprised to find that in Chicago their music would be given a different name. Their attention to the new word was drawn during a demonstration against them outside the café by people denouncing the noisy sounds produced by the band and the fact that they were not members of the musicians’ union in Chicago. According to what bandleader Tom Brown remembered, there was a placard carrying the message Don’t Patronize This Jass Music. Obviously, a word like jazz or jass—mostly with unfavorable connotations—was known in Chicago by 1915 (Charters 2008: 114–18).\n\nHere we might add that the mere fact of invitation of a New Orleans–based group to Chicago suggests that ragtime and blues-related music had been known in Chicago for some time and that entrepreneurs in Chicago were fascinated by the novelty of New Orleans music and its commercial potential. One should also not forget that in 1893 Chicago was for six months the venue of the World’s Columbian Exposition, a cultural and trade fair, with musical groups from many parts of the United States, and even overseas, being heard. Within the vaudeville theatre circuits musicians from New Orleans, St. Louis, and many other places were also regularly traveling all over the United States from the 1890s on. (See also Abbott and Seroff 2002.)\n\nIn his book Pioneers of Jazz: The Story of the Creole Band (2005), Lawrence Gushee reports about a letter by Ray Lopez, the band’s cornetist, in which he said that once, when they had just finished playing a conventional number, Hawaiian Butterfly, a man from South Side Chicago shouted at them: jazz it up, Ray! Thereafter the band played some up-tempo piece, jazzing it up, meaning play with more vigor and energy, and also play loud (Gushee 2005: 138). That means that the word was definitely also used as a verb. More recently, Lewis Porter (1997: 8) has pointed out that Some of the original uses of the word jazz still survive. People still use it to mean ‘lively’ or ‘energetic’ as in ‘That’s a real jazzy outfit’ or ‘Let’s jazz up this party.’\n\nAs a noun, the word was intriguing for the proprietors of Lamb’s Café. Forthwith the band was advertised as Brown’s Dixieland Jass Band, Direct from New Orleans, Best Dance Music in Chicago (Charters 2008: 118). So in 1915 New Orleans had already become a trademark city for musical quality. That the use of the word jazz—with the zz spelling—had come up in sports circles in San Francisco in 1913, and then surfaced in Chicago two years later with an ss spelling in connection with improvised ragtime played by a band from New Orleans, poses many questions that go beyond the search for clarifying the word’s etymology. Apart from the date of its first appearance in Chicago, it would be crucial to know: in which kind of social environment, in which kind of community was it first used in Chicago, before the arrival of that band train-ferried all the way up from the South?\n\nNo one among the members of Tom Brown’s Band in Chicago could have provided information of that kind, and such a question was not even posed. They were foreigners in Chicago, guest workers without union support, sanspapiers. Tom Brown’s Band had been hired in New Orleans by an entrepreneur from Chicago, Joseph Gorham, based on the band’s sound as it existed in New Orleans. Although we do not know what they sounded like, dance was equally important as an aspect of acceptance by northern audiences. It is clear that there was a gradually emerging colony of New Orleans musicians in Chicago. How they adapted to local tastes did affect perceptions of what constituted jazz during the period 1915 to 1920. All of a sudden, it seems, the word jazz was there, used by somebody who had picked it up from someone else, and that person again picked it up somewhere, and so on. Since no jazz researchers were yet active in 1915 to witness its early uses and contexts and start inquiries after the word first appeared—they could not have anticipated how important it would be—memory and oral tradition are the principal type of sources we have. And oral tradition of this kind, according to Lawrence Gushee, seems to hold that New Orleans musicians first heard the word in Chicago, and that it became current in New Orleans only after the Original Dixieland Jass Band had recorded in 1917 in New York.\n\nThat can be disputed. Dick Holbrook (1976), in his story of Ray Lopez, reports that the latter mentioned a nonmusical use of the word by William Demarest while rehearsing a vaudeville act in a Canal Street theater in New Orleans, ca. 1910. This statement seems to correct the assumption by Gushee that the word was unknown in New Orleans prior to the 1917 recordings by the Original Dixieland Jass Band. Some important written information relating to that period has been retrieved most recently by Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff in their book Ragged But Right (2007). From there emerges the importance of the traveling shows by African Americans during the first two decades of the twentieth century, preparing the terrain for the rise of blues and jazz. The vaudeville circuits and circus enterprises turned out to be a significant background to the competitive ascent of African Americans in theatre and show business, and a breeding ground for the further development of band ragtime and blues toward national recognition. Just a year after the Tom Brown event in Chicago, an African American newspaper, the Indianapolis Freeman, testifies to the fact that by 1916 the word jazz in various spellings was common in the Midwest, and had become a fashionable word for a new style of playing ragtime.\n\nThe October 28, 1916, issue of the Freeman advertises John H. Wickliffe’s Ginger Orchestra: Styled America’s Greatest Jaz Combination, Now at the Regent Theatre, Indianapolis. It is hailed as the first orchestra of Colored players that has appeared at that house. All its members and their specialties are then introduced and the page ends with the statement: Just can’t keep still when the Jaz combination plays. It will appear at the Washington theatre Saturday evening. (See original reproduction and picture of the eight-piece orchestra in Abbott and Seroff 2007: 172). It is most interesting that by 1916 the word jazz, in whatever spelling, was beginning to give rise to derivatives, such as Jaz combination. With trumpet, trombone, clarinet, and banjo, Wickliff’s Ginger Orchestra matches what had become a kind of standard instrumentation of groups that would be associated with the word jazz.\n\nPublished ragtime compositions and W. C. Handy’s blues were an indispensable part of the repertoire of African American musical groups appearing in the so-called annex or sideshow tent of circus companies. P. G. Lowery and his orchestra traveled from 1899 on with various circus companies, including the famous Wallace-Hagenbeck Circus in 1910. R. Roy Pope and his circus annex band was another group active by 1911, using brass instruments and drums. Prof. James Wolfscale’s Concert Band was one of the most notable and widely recognized groups, shortly before World War I. Wolfscale opened the 1914 season with a concert band of thirty-two pieces, writes the research team Abbott and Seroff (2007: 168). Thus the circus bands demonstrate that the concept of the big band was not as remote in the 1930s as has been thought. There are parallels in organization and the status of the leader. By 1916 the circus band, though versatile in its repertoire, had a significant portion of protojazz in it. Abbott and Seroff (2007: 170) write that Blues and emerging jazz were increasingly significant in Prof. Wolfscale’s musical program during the 1915 and 1916 seasons.\n\nIt was in these years that the term jazz became current. James Wolfscale’s son Roy, cornetist, had joined the John Wickcliff’s Ginger Band of Chicago in 1916. They had an engagement at Schlitz Palm Garden in Milwaukee and the Grunewald Café in Minneapolis (Abbott and Seroff 2007:"
