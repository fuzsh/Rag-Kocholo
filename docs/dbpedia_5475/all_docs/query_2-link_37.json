        "text": "Gugu Hlongwane\n\nSaint Mary's University\n\nA new post-conflict chapter characterized not by bigotry but by national unity is being written in South Africa. Playing a key role in the rewriting, representation, and remembering of the past is the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission which, in 1996, started the process of officially documenting human rights violations during the years 1960-1993. This nation-building discourse of reconciliation, endorsed by both the present government and South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), has been a crucial agent of a new collective memory after the trauma of apartheid. But the confession of apartheid crimes proved beneficial mostly for perpetrators in search of amnesty rather than a genuine interest in a rehabilitated society. Thus, the amnesty system did very little to advance reconciliation. It is for these reasons that the South African TRC was cynically regarded by its critics as a fiasco, a \"Kleenex commission\" that turned human suffering into theatrical spectacle watched all over the world. There is, in fact, little that is \"new\" or \"post\" in a country that retains apartheid features of inequity. What is often overlooked in this prematurely celebratory language of reconciliation is South Africa's interregnum moment. Caught between two worlds, South Africans are confronted with Antonio Gramsci's conundrum that can be specifically applied to the people of this region: an old order that is dying and not yet dead and a new order that has been conceived but not yet born. And in this interregnum, Gramsci argues, \"a great variety of morbid symptoms appear\" (276). Terms like \"new South Africa\" and \"rainbow nation,\" popularized by former president F.W. de Klerk and Desmond Tutu, the former chairperson of the TRC respectively, then, not only ignore the \"morbid\" aspects of South Africa's bloody road to democracy, but also inaccurately suggest a break with the past. This supposed historical rupture belies the continuities of apartheid.\n\nThe past, then, continues to infringe on the present in often-disturbing ways. But the question of how history is remembered is an interesting one. In South Africa, a pervasive rhetoric of amnesia permeates the social fabric. Indeed, as Ernest Renan asserts, the process of forgetting is \"a crucial factor in the creation of a nation\" (11). For the victims of apartheid, however, there is too much to remember. A case in point is the recent commemoration of the forced removals of thousands of people from the Johannesburg suburb of Sophiatown. Fifty years ago, the apartheid government, threatened by a location which was a microcosm of what South Africa could be like without the apartheid shackles, bulldozed homes that were in the way of \"progress.\" Today, Sophiatown is, in the minds of many, a time and place of mythical proportions, often remembered with much nostalgia. For David Graver, who includes the Junction Avenue Theatre Company's 1986 play, Sophiatown, in his anthology titled Drama for a New South Africa, the memory of Sophiatown is resurrected because it \"contemplates the possibilities of a world after apartheid,\" in which \"people from very different cultural backgrounds can forge a common social order\" (24). This article, a critique of the dominant discourse of reconciliation, will examine critical responses to Sophiatown as well as consider the relevance of this play for the \"new\" South Africa. Put differently, how much of an achievement is Sophiatown and to what extent is its focus on reconciliation a model for the future?\n\nTo answer the first question, there is no doubt that Sophiatown, a play set in the 1950s and performed in the mid-1980s, shows the creative vision of playwrights who, independently of institutional discourses, wrote against the grain. In his twenty-page introduction, Graver finds solace and hope in the very performance of a play like this during a period characterized by the military occupation of black townships and thousands of apartheid-related deaths. But four years before former president Nelson Mandela's release from Robben Island, this was a time when apartheid structures were crumbling, as Graver accurately points out. The Immorality Act of 1957, for example, was repealed and marriages could, for the first time, occur across colour lines. These changes notwithstanding, \"the White minority government [still] refused to entertain any notion of sharing power with the Black majority\" (Graver 24). Graver's hopefulness, then, is sustained by a play that transcends these difficult material conditions.\n\nWhile Martin Orkin's comments on the play do not evoke Graver's \"vibrant hybrid culture\" (24), he nonetheless describes Sophiatown as \"perhaps amongst the most successful of the post-1976 plays produced by a number of dissident ruling-class as well as oppressed subjects\" (198). Unlike other township plays written about this period, which \"[were] mostly unable to move beyond the parameters permitted by prevailing discourse\" (199), Orkin observes that this play was better able to articulate \"a national culture, to construct or recover what might be called a people's history and myth about its past\" (198). Both Graver's and Orkin's evaluations rightly suggest a time when the illogic of apartheid was defied through the mixture of various ethnic groups in places like Sophiatown where blacks had freehold rights. But whether or not the national culture privileged by Orkin is worth emulating is the other question to be explored.\n\nWith regard to how the play came about, journalist Jim Bailey explains in Malcolm Purkey's introduction that Sophiatown was inspired by actual events set in motion by two black South African writers: \"Nat [Nakasa] and Lewis [Nkosi who] set up house together [in Sophiatown] and advertised for a Jewish girl to come and live with them. Despite all the legislation of South Africa, they obtained one.\" Bailey explains that he \"met the sporting lass... [who] was good enough looking but very tall and thin\" (Graver 25-6). Notwithstanding the objectification of a woman reduced to body measurements - a point I will elaborate later - Purkey created the play in conjunction with members of the multiracial JATC. Although the members of this theatre company were fascinated by the account of a mysterious woman who became an important part of the play's inspiration, the following questions were still asked: \"Who could she [the Jewish 'girl'] possibly have been? Why did she take up the challenge?\" (Graver 26) These questions remain unanswered, but the \"she\" who answers Nakasa's and Nkosi's odd advertisement is, in the play's rendition of events, Ruth Golden. As Purkey clarifies, however, in writing the play they \"deliberately refrained from pursuing too far the actual facts of that event, attempting, rather, an imaginative reconstruction\" (26).\n\nAside from the fact that Purkey edited the story independently of the multiracial company when he \"was sent off for six weeks to shape the material into a working script\" (Graver 27), there is a sense in which Purkey wants to establish that these \"imaginative reconstructions\" were not too far from the actual truth. He explains: \"we were ....aware of our enormous responsibility to the people of Sophiatown - we had to strive to remain true to the spirit of the times. And so we started a series of interviews with representative figures from the period\" (26). It is this \"spirit of the times\" that needs serious examination.\n\nBefore exploring the play's limited national oneness, it is important to elaborate on the historical significance of a production that captures the high emotions of a people rendered helpless in the face of massive government apparatus. The play dramatizes the 1955 bulldozing of a Johannesburg location called Sophiatown, sandwiched between white suburbs. Tom Lodge, who dedicates a chapter of his survey of black politics since 1945 to \"The Destruction of Sophiatown,\" describes the show of force displayed by the eight government lorries and \"two thousand armed police\" (108) which descended on Sophiatown on the dawn of a rainy day. Spanning a period of five years, with the final resettlement of mixed-race people completed in 1960 (108), these forced removals signaled the \"triumph\" of apartheid. The all-white suburb that replaced Sophiatown, Triomph - an Afrikaans word for triumph - was evidence of the apartheid state's blatant maliciousness. There were many such removals, and millions were displaced in the process.\n\nLodge places the razing of Sophiatown in the context \"of a much wider social process in which many old-established inner-city African communities were uprooted and reconstructed under the supervision of the authorities\" (93). Aside from their proximity to white neighbourhoods, the Western areas - which included Sophiatown, Martindale, and Newclare - were, as Lodge explains, increasingly viewed as \"hotbeds of African resistance\" (99). In fact, the most organized branch of the ANC had its headquarters in Sophiatown (105), a situation which likely made the white minority government extremely uneasy.\n\nAside from political activists, Sophiatown was home to many different types of people. Writer and critic, Lewis Nkosi, who lived in Sophiatown, has described his years there as a \"fabulous decade\" (16-17). For him, this now-famous location represented \"a time of infinite hope ...possibility [and] great ferment\" (16-17). But critics such as Loren Kruger have questioned this depiction and have rather suggested Sophiatown as \"an actual but thoroughly imaginary place that came to symbolize a fragile moment of racial tolerance and cultural diversity, crushed by the apartheid juggernaut and later buried under the weight of more militant times \" (60). More important, she maintains that Nkosi's \"fabulous decade\" shared by Sophiatown writers and residents like Bloke Modisane and Don Mattera, was the non-representative view of \"only a small, English-speaking [black] literate elite\" (64). Given the divergent views of Sophiatown, it is crucial to be specific about which Sophiatown is being referred to. Contrary to Purkey's one-dimensional focus, there were seemingly many Sophiatowns. The residents of this famous town, who were not all writers and intellectuals, were themselves not one.\n\nIn \"remain[ing] true to... [Purkey's historic] spirit of the times,\" the play's opening scene evokes the memory of the \"blood [which] ran in the streets of Sophia\" (29) as the powers-that-be cleared the area for the \"Boere's dream of a white-only world\" (29). Lulu, a student living in the Sophiatown home where the bulk of the action takes place, reads a \"special notice\" (59) left for her mother and home-owner, Mamariti. Specified in the note are the \"terms of the Native Resettlement Act of 1954\" (59) requiring the vacating of the premises. The new location is the area of Meadowlands, \"twenty miles from town\" (64), where Sophiatown's black residents would be accommodated. But surprised by a removal that, counter to the notice occurs \"three days early\" (7), the residents can only hurriedly collect their piles of packed boxes and \"a lifetime of furniture and possessions\" (75).\n\nDisplayed in the play is Kruger's \"fragile moment of racial tolerance\" rather than Nkosi's \"fabulous decade.\" And contrary to Orkin's reading, there is very little evidence of characters' transcendence of the restrictive parameters of the day. The black characters in this play are stereotyped while Ruth Golden, the Jewish \"girl\" who answers an advertisement placed by a journalist named Jakes, is a more well-rounded character. She is the play's catalyst and voice of reason, even as she is mercilessly objectified by the men of the Sophiatown home. But despite this objectification, she is somehow elevated as the play's teacher who defines how racial reconciliation will be achieved within the scope of the play.\n\nSophiatown's eight characters, who supposedly exemplify Orkin's \"racial tolerance,\" live in a \"cramped but comfortable [house], suggesting care and warmth\" (28). The stage directions indicate that each character's relative space is \"defined by his or her things\" (28). Mamariti, the owner of the home under discussion, is a Shebeen Queen, a seller and brewer of alcohol. Her trade provides the money needed to send her daughter Lulu to school. On the morning of the forced removals, Mamariti is quite assertive against the \"five tall Dutchmen\" (75) who invade her home in the very early hours of that fateful day. Fahfee, a political activist in his forties, is the first to bring the news that \"homeowners in Sophiatown must sell their property to the government\" (35). Mamariti's son, Mingus, is a gang member in his late twenties whose job description involves \"robbing people on trains\" (64). Although his acts of robbery are in the main directed against white oppressors, he remains an unlikable character who is abusive to both his \"good-time\" black girl-friend, Princess, and his shoe-obsessed and \"barely articulate\" (28) mixed-race side-kick, Charlie. Ruth Golden, as I have indicated, is the Jewish woman from the white suburb of Yeoville who agrees to become part of Jakes' experiment in racial tolerance and reconciliation.\n\nAs the intellectual voice of the play, Jakes deviates somewhat from the stereotypical characterization of Shebeen Queens, criminals, and \"good-time girls.\" In his opening monologue addressed to the audience, he reveals the central role of stories in his life. When we are first introduced to him, he is searching for \"something new, something different\" (29). Ruth turns out to be this novelty, which will facilitate his new story. But before she arrives, his journalistic efforts are confined to writing love letters for Mingus in exchange for the details of the latter's gang-related escapades. When Ruth arrives, she becomes the subject of Jakes' article about the dynamics of living with a white woman in Sophiatown. The article about Ruth Golden, \"a Sophiatown phenomenon\" (53), which is an important \"break\" (57) for Jakes, is the first of four stories to be later published in the \"native\" magazine Drum. What the article reveals, however, is the shallowness of a journalist who is difficult to take seriously. In fact Jakes, who is quite self-effacing, refers to himself as a \"would-be intellectual, living in a wasteland, with no power to change anything except words - and a fat lot of good they do!\" (46) Part of the article on Ruth Golden reads:\n\nMixing it up in Softown. Dig that crazy white girl living it up in Gerty street! Pshoo!Was there a scramble when word went round Sophiatown that a Jewish girl was living at Mamariti's Diamond shebeen...A Jewish girl living in Softown! It's not possible. Is she crazy as a bedbug?...Well, folks, let me introduce you. She is none other than Ruth Golden. Height: five foot three inches...A pert but comfortable figure. Curious bright eyes...Could she be an eager intellectual? A wide-eyed jazz maniac? A demure but daring do-gooder? Or is it just an advertising stunt?... Hey no man, Ruth Golden's just a gal with a golden heart. (53)\n\nThere seems to be a lack of sincerity in the words of a writer who has given up. But it is possible that the creators of the play thought that they were realistically portraying not only the crippling effects of a censored society but also Drum magazine's well- documented \"relentless machismo\" (Nixon 20). But this overt surrender does not allow Jakes to develop very effectively as a character.\n\nIn terms of Jakes' personal life, there seems to be very little commitment there as well. His relationship with Ruth can only grow at a very superficial level. Although Lulu tells Ruth that Jakes is in love with her, the reader does not see any evidence of this. Perhaps, again, it is just a sign of those times: under apartheid, love across colour lines had to be an underground affair, a point driven home by Jakes when he repeatedly says, \"White skin, it's a fatal attraction\" (43). Since he cannot have Ruth, the next best thing is to scorn her.\n\nBut Ruth, who is unbelievably tolerant, takes her objectification in stride. While she contests her presence in an article where she does not speak, she is more concerned about her height, which is an inch taller than what Jakes documents. But she does show curiosity at another time when she is caught by Mingus trying to read one of Jakes' stories in the middle of the night. What is even more curious is that Jakes' Drum piece on Ruth's presence in Sophiatown may have made both blacks and whites aware of the possibilities of racial integration. But as Lulu asserts, Drum was not a magazine widely read by whites. And I doubt that Sophiatown denizens would have been as excited as Jakes is over the visit of a single white woman to their neighbourhood. Aside from the fact that the men in the location think that Ruth is sexually appealing, Jakes' article over-simplifies race relations, especially black men's implied fascination with white women.\n\nThe often-passive and ever-patient Ruth eventually contests Jakes' condescending attitude: \"Look at me,\" she says, \"You write about me, but you never look at me properly. Try to see beyond your own fictions. It's me, Ruth Golden, the girl with the golden heart, pert, comfortable, curious. Why don't you look at me properly, Jakes. Just once?\" (66). In her plea, Ruth challenges not only Jakes' belittling descriptions of her but also the laws of the day that prohibited such close proximity between different races. But it seems that Ruth, who subsequently develops strong feelings of love for Jakes, is the one who is caught up in fictions. Sexual relations between black males and white women were dangerous affairs in apartheid South Africa. A cursory glance was as risky as it was in the segregated southern states of America where black men were lynched for their \"roving\" eyes. At the root of this paranoia, in both countries, are the myths of black men's exaggerated sexual endowments, which could perhaps explain Jakes' reluctance to involve himself with a white woman who could possibly cry rape. However, there is an exceptional character in the play who comes close to fitting the stereotype of a violent black male. After having his sexual advances turned down by Ruth, Mingus calls her a bitch, \"a piece of rubbish!\" (69). The other housemates are never this aggressive; they are simply curious.\n\nAlthough Ruth quickly becomes \"part of the family\" (43), as Jakes states, her colour renders her suspect. Lulu finds her \"a strange European lady nobody understands\" (48). Fahfee, on the one hand, demands that Ruth work for her acceptance and aggressively insists that she \"earn...[her] trust.\" On the other hand, Mingus, who is generally violent both in deed and language, reminds Ruth that in the war for liberation it will be her blood that will be spilt (51). These hitches in racial acceptance and reconciliation are to be expected at a time in history when blacks and whites were at loggerheads. Although the racial reconciliation that is being tried out in the play interestingly reverses the object of curiosity - which is not the usual black person othered in his or her own country but a white woman put under a microscope and on unfamiliar ground - I do not read this subversion as a radical and new South African moment of racial tolerance. Arguably, the JATC members were reversing a stereotype of a black object or other. However, Ruth's otherness is temporary. Even as she is objectified, she is, for the most part, what we all should be: enabled subjects. But the colour of her skin affords her certain privileges, and in this position she is able to define the parameters of reconciliation.\n\nRuth defines reconciliation by privileging cultural fusion or Graver's already-mentioned \"vibrant hybrid culture.\" She influences her new \"friends\" to the point that they eventually agree that they are one. This topic of cultural fusion is brought up when Ruth is provided \"lessons on how to survive in Sophiatown\" (43). During these lessons, which are delivered by Jakes, Farfee and Mingus, she responds to Jake's question about the differences between whites and Jews: \"What's Jewish? I don't know what the hell I am. I'm Jewish on Mondays, I'm white on Tuesdays, I'm South African on Wednesdays, I'm a Democrat on Thursdays, and I'm confused on all the other days. Mostly I'm just confused\" (46). On this particular day, the general confusion in the house is intensified by Ruth's surprise, her \"home-made Jewish Friday night wine\" (55). As the jolly characters now under the influence of alcohol commune and \"break bread\" with one another, they participate in a cultural exchange that supposedly exposes their affinities. What they discover is that Hebrew sounds like tsotsitaal, an urban street slang that blends Afrikaans and African languages. There is also a conflation of amadlozi (African ancestors) with an allegedly-similar Jewish ancestor, the ghost of Elijah (55). While some differences become apparent in terms of the number of gods worshipped in each religion, these, however, eventually become inconsequential. What is of concern, especially to Jakes, is the blessing of a \"perfect confusion\" that will help to engender a \"brand new generation\" (56).\n\nEven before the characters discover a shared culture, Ruth instantly feels quite comfortable in Sophiatown. She is shamelessly pampered by her hosts who \"want life to be easy for the lady\" (45). They go to great lengths to provide her with a bath they initially do not have in the house. When one is eventually found, Ruth is embarrassed by the special treatment and insists on wanting \"to be like everybody else\" (41). Aside from the fact that the unused bath ends up as a brewery because she refuses to use it, Ruth remains of another world. The Sophiatown residents, then, are far from being one.\n\nThe polarization of the Sophiatown denizens is evidenced by the alcohol and money that Ruth brings into her new home. Her stay in Sophiatown, in the first place, is on condition that she pay the \"steep\" (36) rent required by Mamariti. So, the cultural fusion suggested by Graver goes awry. Ruth, whose parents are unaware of her whereabouts, also has an upper-hand in terms of her undisclosed reasons for accepting the curious advertisement that brings her to Sophiatown. While she is acquainted with the secrets of surviving the streets through a language lesson (43), it is only much later that she reveals to Princess, after being asked, that what brings her to Sophiatown is \"curiosity\" (41). While the truthfulness of her answer is appreciated, what is confusing is her lack of openness when Lulu, at another time, asks her a similar question. This time she responds curtly: \"Let's just say I've got my own stories to write\" (49).\n\nRuth's motivation for coming to Sophiatown remains oblique even as the play ends. What is clear is what Ruth does not find in Sophiatown. Apart from her feelings for Jakes which are not reciprocated, she does not find a healthy hybrid culture. There are too many schisms between her reality and that of the others. A movement towards \"cultural confusion\" only serves to reveal a strained reconciliation that is not achieved in the play and has not been achieved yet in a new South Africa where whites are generally not interested in the language and culture lessons Ruth tries to immerse herself in. This, I believe, is the play's revelation - a revelation that Graver perhaps misses in his zeal to celebrate the hybridity of his new South Africa.\n\nThus, cultural hybridity means naught if Africans themselves are not reconciled to their own cultures. Jakes is clearly a culturally-alienated man. His veneration of Bach and Russian novels is not a dilemma in and of itself. However, his over-zealous love for English gained from \"our church schools\" needs a postcolonial critique that is obviously not available to him. So it is left up to Ruth - who says, \"but you don't want to lose your own language\" (62) - to shed light on the situation. While this \"lesson\" elevates Ruth to the level of teacher, it serves to re-establish Jakes' lack of depth as a misinformed student steeped in colonist discourse. But insight is given to Lulu, who knows just how rotten Bantu education is. Unlike Jakes, she refuses colonial mimicry by satirizing William Wordsworth's canonical poem about \"a host of golden daffodils\" (Wordsworth 33) - a poem divorced from her hard reality.\n\nRuth, then, is often the belle of the ball. She is the one who sets the parameters of the plot and fundamentally moves it forward. It would be useful at this point to remember that Ruth initially enters a space where she is not expected. When she is eventually embraced, it is because of the material improvements she will make to the home. The romance of Sophiatown, however, is not sustainable. Ruth exits the play at a moment when the apartheid government was brutally crushing any semblance of racial fusion.\n\nAt the play's end, as the characters are forcibly removed from Sophiatown by the South African State, Ruth is shunned by Jakes, who treats her quite unfeelingly. Aside from the fact that her attraction to Jakes is not made explicit during the course of the play, she is willing to make enormous sacrifices for love. Jakes rejects her offer to shut the door on her family and explore the possibilities of living with him in another country (74). He snaps: \"I'm not letting some white girl put her hands around my heart when she feels like it...we lost what little chance we had\" (74). Jakes' response here is rather curt. But it can be read positively as an important moment of resistance by a man whose words and actions during the course of the play suggest someone who has lost direction. And unlike Frantz Fanon's black man who cannot resist the glamour of whiteness, at the end of the play Jakes knows what he wants. He is not going to \"marry white culture, white beauty, white whiteness\" (63). Perhaps at a different time, if true agency was his, a functional relationship could have developed. But this is not the case in the play. The environment, which is extremely unhealthy, will not allow a state of normalcy.\n\nAlthough Jakes does attempt to find Ruth at a later stage, the meeting seems impossible (77). His compassion towards her at this point suggests that his earlier insensitivity was perhaps misdirected. So Ruth exits the play unceremoniously. But during the course of the play, she is far from insignificant, even as Jakes insists that she'll \"always be looking from the outside\" (65).\n\nWhile Fahfee, in his political optimism, holds fast to the belief that writers like Jakes can help \"make a new South Africa\" (60), the characters in Sophiatown do not seem to know how to realize this transformation. For a variety of reasons, these characters are not able to achieve a genuine reconciliation, a point that Graver misses. As in current discourses of the \"new\" South Africa, the architects of the boundaries of reconciliation are white. But an argument can be raised that Jakes rejects Ruth and perhaps sets the limits of reconciliation himself. At the end of the play, he too has agency enough to determine the trajectories of his dealings with her. But in other areas Jakes simply does not have Ruth's power. On such unequal footing, then, reconciliation is aborted.\n\nGraver, who reads Sophiatown more optimistically, celebrates the cross-fertilizations of the new South African theatre. Characters like Ruth Golden, who outwit apartheid's obsessions with racial hierarchies, are held up as exemplary South Africans interested in the erasure of differences. But it is important to point out that this ideal of national unity is not Graver's alone. It is, in fact, the stated policy of the ruling African National Congress. There are, necessarily, many South Africans who take issue with this language. In his essay, \"Guilt and Atonement: Unmasking History for the Future,\" Njabulo Ndebele expresses serious reservations about the so-called \"new\" South Africa celebrated by critics like Graver. As far as he is concerned, the phrase \"new South Africa\" is \"fraught with much meaning and meaninglessness all at once\" (337). He observes that the root of the problem is the fact that \"South Africans don't know one another as a people\" (336). Rather, there's a cultural \"stand-off\" (337), with those who still hold the keys of the South African economy, the white South Africans, \"prescribing the manner in which the new friendship [and reconciliation] is to be carried out\" (337). This article makes similar observations about the cultural strangers in Sophiatown and in contemporary South Africa.\n\nWhile optimists such as Graver rush towards a theorization of South Africa's globalized hybrid cultures where blacks and whites are happily merging, cynics display not only a necessary caution but also a suspicion of the usurping language that encourages racial blindness. While current president Thabo Mbeki voiced his reservations about the ANC's language of oneness - specifically his assertions in a 1998 speech about a racially and economically divided two-nation state (71) - there are those who insist on a healed \"nation\" even in the face of its glaring wounds.\n\nIn terms of the theatre of the new South Africa, Coleen Angove privileges a \"reconciliation theatre,\" \"in which the reality of a polarized society is defied to present human beings from all racial and cultural groups, communicating, sharing and understanding one another's problems\" (44). Like Angove, Ian Steadman, who calls for a unified South African literature, is interested in ignoring the divisions of South Africa. His plea for a united South-African art that does not dwell on black and white camps, especially given that \"the battle against apartheid has, to all intents and purposes, been won\" (Blumberg and Walder 26), however well-intentioned, is perhaps too optimistic. In his opinion, labels such as \"black theatre,\" \"black people,\" and \"black aesthetic\" \"reflect not a nationalistic image of the politically defined State but a nativist image of a racially defined essence\" (33). But in an indirect response, Maishe Maponya asserts that \"as long as blacks do not have equal rights there'll always be black theatre\" (Steadman 104). Critics such as Maponya imply that South Africans of colour have gained political rights but whites have all the wealth. This generic South African literature thus feigns a state of oneness.\n\nThankfully, there are many critics in South Africa who see a problem with skipping crucial steps in a rush to get to the much-desired new South Africa. In an interview with Ashraf Jamal about the \"artistic and cultural vision\" of an emerging nation, several of these critics resist Angove's contrived theatre of \"reconciliation.\" As far as they are concerned, reconciliation is not yet being performed. Mannie Manim's response points to the societal fractures of a new South Africa which could potentially take \"many wonderful directions\" (Nuttall and Michael 198). But she also argues that \"the previously empowered [white South Africans] are living in denial. Emigration is a fact\" (197). Jamal argues in a similar vein: \"It is impossible today to speak of �the full dimensions of the new country and new people.' There is nothing whole here\" (Nuttall and Michael 198). Unlike Graver, who does not qualify the new in the new South Africa, these critics necessarily \"do not ignore the apartheid era,\" neither do they \"look beyond the narrow concerns of the anti-apartheid struggle to more abiding cultural realities\" (1) as Graver seeks to do. The reduction of the anti-apartheid movement to a \"narrow concern\" by Graver is astounding.\n\nIn a climate where \"apartheid has passed\" (1), Graver asserts that \"South African theatre deserves continued attention for its innovative variety of hybrid dramatic forms rich in vivid language, forceful performance styles and incisive social functions\" (1). Apparently, hybridity not only makes a new South Africa accessible to the outside world but also makes it relevant in terms of its \"universal lessons and appeal\" (1). Graver's starting point is clearly not South Africa but the globalized culture as a whole. So Dennis Walder is right in his criticism of Graver's primary valorization of an American audience, which perhaps explains his general carelessness with the spelling of characters' names (Walder 673). There are also problems with the translation of Zulu words.\n\nImportant in South Africa today are not the currently-fashionable creolized identities but rather a focus on other reconciliations. To date, there has been a lopsided focus on reconciliation between black and white South Africans. As evidenced by Sophiatown, characters like Jakes need to come home, culturally, because in a country like South Africa colonization has exacerbated the alienation from African cosmologies. Attempts by some black South Africans to reconnect with an African past are often viewed suspiciously by those who associate Afro-centrism with an exclusive black consciousness. A case in point is Daniel Herwitz's response to African praise poetry, which he finds \"over-the-top\" and \"so eminently unreadable, and so highly distasteful\" (51).\n\nIn terms of what Sophiatown can add to current discourse, perhaps a good place to start would be an appreciation of an awkward reconciliation tried out under difficult circumstances. Also important is a culturally introspective approach that does not turn the spotlight solely on Ruth Golden, but on other characters in the play who are in serious need of reconciliation and healing. Jakes, for example, needs to come to terms with his cultural alienation. And Mingus, whose violence is extreme, gives the present South Africa a chance to contend with a long history of colonial violence which was often brought into the home - with girls and women being the usual victims. Glamorizing Mingus' gangster life is counter-productive in a country that is already so troubled. With regard to the school lessons that Lulu finds so detestable, students in the new South Africa no longer have to suffer the poison of Dr. Verwoerd's inferior Black education that can be blamed for Jakes' colonial mentality. But linguistic colonization nonetheless continues in a country where English and Afrikaans retain control. Then there is Charlie, Mingus's coloured human \"dog\" and sidekick who, because of his cultural difference, cannot join his \"master.\" He is stabbed to death at the old Sophiatown home. His character offers an important opportunity to theorize vexed black/coloured relations. Graver may take issue with this, but evidently the struggle continues.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAngove, Coleen. \"Alternative Theatre: Reflecting a Multi-Racial South African Society?\" Theatre Research International 17.1 (1992): 39-45.\n\nFanon, Frantz.
