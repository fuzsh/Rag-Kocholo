        "text": "Air Travel\n\nIntroduction\n\nAirline restrictions on flying\n\nConsideration of security measures\n\nHealth considerations when flying\n\nPotential in-flight health problems\n\nIntroduction\n\nAir travel can expose you to a number of factors that can impact your health and well-being. Although most travellers won't notice any adverse effects to their health during a flight, the effects from flying may present challenges if you have certain underlying health conditions.\n\nAirline restrictions on flying\n\nThe airline you plan to fly with needs to make sure it is medically safe for you to fly, so you might need to tell them about any health condition you have. Airlines might not let you travel with them:\n\nif they are concerned that you have a medical condition that might get worse during a flight\n\nif you have an illness that could infect other passengers\n\nRestrictions and rules can vary between airlines, so if you are in any doubt, you should seek advice from the medical department of the airline. Most airlines have a medical advisory service, details of which can usually be found on their website.\n\nIf you think your health might be affected by flying, you should contact your GP or specialist before you book a flight.\n\nTravel by air is not normally advised in the following cases (this list is not exhaustive):\n\ninfants less than 48 hours old (longer after premature births)\n\nwomen after the 36th week of pregnancy or 32nd week for multiple pregnancy\n\nif you suffer from or have had:\n\nangina or chest pain at rest\n\nan infectious disease (e.g. chickenpox, flu), including COVID-19\n\ndecompression sickness after diving (sometimes called 'the bends')\n\nincreased pressure in the brain (due to bleeding, injury or infection)\n\ninfection of your ears or sinuses\n\nrecent heart attack\n\nrecent stroke\n\nrecent operation or injury where trapped air or gas may be present in the body (e.g. stomach ,bowel, eyes, face, brain)\n\nsevere long term diseases that affect your breathing\n\nbreathlessness at rest\n\nunresolved pneumothorax (punctured lung)\n\nsickle cell anaemia\n\nunstable mental health or psychotic illness\n\nConsideration of security measures\n\nSecurity restrictions on the type of equipment and fluids which can be taken into the aircraft cabin might affect what medical equipment or medication you can bring with you for use during a flight.\n\nPlease see the Travelling with Medicines advice page for further details.\n\nIf you have been fitted with any metal devices such as an artificial joint, a pacemaker or internal automatic defibrillator, then you should:\n\ncarry a medical alert letter from your doctor\n\nalert the security staff that you have a medical device fitted before passing through any screening equipment\n\nHealth considerations when flying\n\nHigh Altitude\n\nHigh altitude is generally considered to be 2,400 metres (8000 feet) and above. Aircraft cabins are kept at a pressure approximately equivalent to between 1,800 to 2,400 metres; developing symptoms due to high altitude (altitude sickness) is not usual during flights for most people. However, if you have a lung or heart condition, you might need to use oxygen during a flight because of the higher altitude.\n\nIf you fly in to an airport that is above 2,400 metres, for example in the Andes and Himalayas, you might get signs of altitude sickness.\n\nFor further information on the effects of altitude, see the Altitude and Travel advice page.\n\nUsing oxygen whilst flying\n\nIf you have a lung or heart (cardiac) condition, your symptoms might become worse during or after a flight, particularly if you become dehydrated or have over exerted yourself. You may need oxygen during the flight, even if you do not usually need it:\n\nIn advance of your flight you must arrange with the airline the use of oxygen and any assistance you need at the airport.\n\nIf you use your own home oxygen, you must still contact the airline in advance to discuss if you are able to use it on the flight.\n\nYou will need to contact your GP or specialist as they may need to provide medical information to the airline.\n\nPregnancy\n\nIf you are healthy and your pregnancy has been straightforward, then air travel is generally considered safe. However, some pregnant women with underlying risk factors might be at increased risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from flying.\n\nYou should get advice from your midwife or obstetrician before booking any flights.\n\nAirlines request a medical certificate from pregnant travellers if travelling after 28 weeks of pregnancy:\n\nmost airlines won't allow air travel after 36 weeks for a single pregnancy, and 32 weeks for multiple pregnancies\n\nthe medical certificate should detail your estimated delivery date and confirm that your pregnancy is uncomplicated and progressing normally\n\nYou must ensure you have travel insurance which covers both yourself and your unborn baby (in the event you need to give birth unexpectedly during your trip).\n\nSee the Advice for Pregnant Travellers page for more details.\n\nFlying with a disability\n\nNavigating an airport and flying can at times be stressful, cause anxiety and be physically exhausting. Many airports offer assistance services for those who have physical or hidden disabilities but these may need to be booked in advance. Cabin crew are not allowed to assist passengers who are unable to look after their own physical needs (such as using the toilet, assistance with meals or mobility) during a flight.\n\nIt is important that you make the airline aware of any special requirements you may need during the flight as soon as possible.\n\nYou should contact your airline well in advance of travel to check what assistance might be available to you for:\n\nyour journey through your departure airport\n\nboarding the aircraft and during the flight\n\ndisembarking the aircraft\n\ntransferring between flights\n\ntravelling through your destination airport\n\nIf you use an electric mobility aid such as an electric scooter or wheelchair, you will need to provide your airline with details of your equipment (such as make, model, size or weight) well in advance of your flight to enable the airline to check they can safely load and stow your equipment and undertake a fire risk of electrical equipment.\n\nIf you use a wheelchair and wish to remain in your own chair to the aircraft door rather than transfer to an airline wheelchair at check-in, you should inform your airline of your particular needs as soon as you can.\n\nShowing airline crew your equipment’s operating manual may be helpful, especially if they have any issues loading, disassembling or reassembling your equipment into the aircraft hold.\n\nInfectious Diseases\n\nTo reduce the potential risk of passing on infections to others on board an aircraft, you should postpone travel if you are actively unwell, especially if you have a fever, until you have fully recovered.\n\nThe quality of aircraft cabin air is carefully controlled and research has shown that there is a very low risk of infectious diseases being transmitted on board. The risk is no different from being sat close to someone on other forms of transport such as a bus or train. When transmission of infection does occur between passengers, usually as a result of a cough or sneeze or by touching surfaces which have been contaminated, they are usually seated in the same area of an aircraft.\n\nAn airline can deny boarding of any passenger who looks unwell, especially if they suspect the passenger might be infectious (infect other passengers).\n\nIf you have recently recovered from an infectious disease, but are still showing physical signs of being unwell, for example crusted spots following chicken pox, then you should carry a letter from a GP confirming that you are no longer infectious.\n\nIf someone has already travelled and is then found to have a serious infectious illness (such as measles or COVID-19) which could be a potential risk to other passengers, then contact tracing of passengers will be carried out by local public health authorities.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nYou should not fly if you have experienced recent symptoms of COVID-19 or have been identified as being a close contact of someone who has experienced COVID-19.\n\nYou should check the latest UK advice on the length of time you must self-isolate for after symptoms develop or being identified as a close contact, before deciding on travel:\n\nScotland – NHSinform\n\nEngland – NHS UK\n\nNorthern Ireland: NIdirect.gov.uk\n\nWales: GOV.Wales\n\nFurther information on reducing your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19) during travel is available on the COVID-19: Health Considerations for Travel advice page.\n\nPotential in-flight health problems\n\nDehydration\n\nThe circulating air inside aircraft cabins is very dry and can affect your skin, lips, nose and eyes. Discomfort can be reduced by using:\n\nskin moisturisers\n\nsaline nasal sprays\n\nlip balms.\n\nglasses instead of contact lenses, which may cause irritation\n\nAlcohol and caffeine containing drinks can make you pee more which can lead to dehydration:\n\nyou should try to drink plenty of clear fluids, such as water, during long flights and limit how much alcohol and caffeine you drink\n\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)\n\nThe cramped conditions and long periods of being less active on a flight can cause pain, stiffness or swelling of your legs. Being less active can lead to slow blood flow in your veins which increases your risk of developing a blood clot, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs most commonly form in the legs. Part of the clot may break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE) which is potentially life threatening.\n\nSee the Deep Vein Thrombosis advice page for further information and advice on reducing your risk of DVT during travel.\n\nEar nose, throat and dental conditions\n\nIt is common to experience a 'popping' sensation in your ears during take-off and landing. This is caused by the air pressure changes that occur during a flight mean that during take-off air moves out of your middle ear and sinuses and during landing it flows back into your sinuses and middle ears.\n\nIf you experience any discomfort, simple measures usually relieve symptoms such as:\n\nswallowing\n\nchewing\n\nyawning\n\nusing a pacifier (dummy) in infants (as it mimics swallowing)\n\nIf you are suffering from an ear or sinus infection you may experience intense pain during take-off and landing.\n\nYou should discuss this with a doctor prior to flying as it may potentially cause an injury within your ear.\n\nGeneral dental treatment, such as dental fillings, are not usually a contraindication for flying. However, some dental conditions or treatment can result in pockets of trapped gas (for example, unfinished root canal treatment, dental decay or abscesses) which may cause pain and discomfort when flying. You should seek advice from your dentist before flying in this instance.\n\nFlying after diving\n\nFlying too soon after diving might lead to you developing complications such as decompression sickness (more commonly called “the bends”). The general rule is to avoid flying until 12 -24 hours after your last dive. If in any doubt, you should seek specialist advice from your diving school before flying.\n\nJet Lag\n\nJet lag is the term used for when your normal sleep pattern is disrupted due to crossing multiple time zones.\n\nJet lag can cause:\n\ndifficulty sleeping at night\n\nwanting to sleep during the day\n\ndifficulties in concentration and remembering things\n\nchanges to your mood\n\nchanges to your appetite\n\nnausea (feeling sick), indigestion and constipation\n\nEffects of jet lag gradually wear off as your body adapts to the new time zone.\n\nTo minimise the effects of jet lag, you can consider the following measures:\n\nTry to begin adjusting your body to the new time few days before travel by going to bed 1 to 2 hours later if travelling westward, or earlier if travelling eastward.\n\nChange your sleep schedule to your new time zone as soon as possible after arrival.\n\nIf you take medication that needs to be taken at a specific time (for example antibiotics or insulin), you should speak to your GP or specialist to plan an altered schedule for taking your medication which takes time zone differences into consideration.\n\nOn long haul flights, you should:\n\nstretch and walk in the cabin when you can\n\ndrink plenty of water\n\navoid excess alcohol or caffeine\n\ntry to sleep on the plane during an overnight flight\n\nOnce at your destination:\n\nspend plenty of time outdoors in the natural daylight\n\ntry to eat meals and go to bed according to local times\n\nIf you are tired during the day, try taking a short nap (approximately 20-30 minutes) as this is unlikely to affect your ability to sleep at night.\n\nAvoid heavy commitments on the first day after travelling:\n\nbe prepared for tiredness in the evenings and early waking, which can last up to 5 days or more\n\nMotion sickness\n\nIt is uncommon to experience motion sickness during flying unless there is severe turbulence. If you are known to suffer from motion sickness in flight, you should:\n\nchoose a seat in the mid-section of the aircraft\n\nkeep motion sickness bags nearby\n\navoid alcohol during and for 24 hours before a flight\n\ndiscuss with your GP medications to manage your symptoms if they can be severe\n\nFear of Flying\n\nFear of flying is a common phobia to have. If you suffer from fear of flying, the following tips might be useful:\n\nA visit to your doctor prior to travel can provide you with reassurance about your general fitness for air travel:\n\nin severe cases, your doctor may be able to refer you for cognitive behavioural therapy in order to learn different ways to overcome your fears\n\nTell the cabin crew:\n\nreassurance about routine aircraft sounds and inflight activities can help reassure you\n\nOn a flight, try distracting yourself by talking with other passengers, watching a film, listening to music or reading.\n\nA number of airlines run courses aimed at alleviating fear of flying. Some of these are listed here:\n\nBritish Airways Flying with Confidence\n\nVirgin Atlantic Flying without Fear\n\nEasyjet Fearless Flyer\n\nAir Rage\n\nThis term is used to describe threatening behaviour or violence occurring on an aircraft, usually provoked or worsened by stress and frustration. Airlines will, when necessary, divert aircraft to offload disruptive passengers and legal action taken against those involved.\n\nMinimising the triggers causing air rage involves:\n\navoiding excess alcohol and substance misuse\n\nremaining calm when dealing with stressful situation such as crowding, delays and lack of information\n\nusing nicotine gum or patches to avoid the agitation of nicotine withdrawal when smoking is not allowed in airport buildings and during the flight"
