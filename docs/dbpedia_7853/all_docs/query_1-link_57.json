        "text": "If you’ve woken up this morning and your face is looking a little more puffy, or bloated, than you are used to, know that there are a few potential reasons why – most of which are easily remedied.\n\nWhile there are some health conditions, such as allergies or a sinus infection that might be the root cause, for most people, it's more likely that late nights, salty snacks or one, two many negronis that is the issue.\n\nTo figure out what might be at play here, WH consulted a handful of leading skincare experts, to get their take on the cause of, and solutions to a puffy face.\n\nWhat causes a puffy face?\n\n1/ Water retention\n\nTypically, the main cause of a puffy face is due to water retention. 'The reason for your face becoming puffy is usually due to vasodilation [the widening of blood vessels] and electrolyte [minerals in your body that have an electric charge and which help to balance the amount of water in your body] imbalance, causing fluid to leave your veins and go into your skin area,' notes Harley Street Dermatologist Dr Emma Craythorne.\n\n2/ Lymphatic system\n\nIssues with your lymphatic system could also be involved. 'The lymphatic system is incredibly important in its role for clearing impurities from the body, and occasionally it gets blocked or slowed down. One of the most important things you can do to improve lymphatic drainage is to drink water,' adds Dr Craythorne.\n\nThe trigger for this build-up of excess water varies. There are quite a lot of reasons this could happen to you, from eating too much salt, allergies, early wake-up calls, hot showers, alcohol and (the ever-unavoidable) PMS,' says facialist Lisa Franklin.\n\n3 /An abscessed tooth\n\nHaving a cracked or chipped tooth or an untreated cavity can allow bacteria to sneak into the pulp—the soft innards—of your tooth, where they can multiply, says Dr. Stewart. The abscess (a.k.a. infection) results in a collection of pus and swelling around the tooth or gums. Translation: You’ll have a wicked toothache and some jawline swelling.\n\n4/ A sinus infection\n\nThis could also be the reason you're looking a bit more bloated in the face than usual. When you have a nasty cold the air-filled spaces between the eyes and behind your forehead, nose, and cheekbones become inflamed and can get they blocked up with mucus. The pressure caused by that backup causes a dull ache around your eyes, greenish-yellow discharge from your nose, pounding headaches—and sometimes, a swollen face.\n\n5/ An underlying health issue\n\nWondering if an underlying issues cause a puffy face? 'There are many health conditions that can present with facial swelling including thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and kidney disease,' notes Dr Susan Mayou, Consultant Dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic.\n\nWhen to see a doctor for facial swelling\n\nHave concerns that this could be you? Give your GP a call and explain what's going on, to them. Also call 111 or your GP if your puffy face or swelling is painful to touch accompanied by a fever, rash, burning sensation, or joint pain as this could indicate you have an infection.\n\nHow can I prevent a puffy face?\n\nIf you know you’re prone to puffiness, aesthetic doctor Dr Sophie Shotter recommends 'sleeping propped up in bed, which can help,' as it will help the excess water to drain. 'Also remove makeup before bed, inflammation in the skin worsens puffiness and dirty makeup left on overnight will contribute to this,' she adds.\n\n'Triggers like allergies and hormones are unavoidable, so it’s worth being mindful of the amount of alcohol and salt you’re consuming around these times especially–and using cooler water to wash your face is a good idea,' advises Franklin.\n\nWhat foods cause a puffy face?\n\n'Too much sodium (from salt) in the body causes fluid retention which can present as a puffy face,' explains Dr Mayou. 'Use herbs and spices to flavour food rather than salt.\n\nReduce your intake of foods laced with salt such as the below\n\nCrisps\n\nProcessed meats\n\nAnchovies\n\nCheese\n\nGravy granules\n\nOlives\n\nPickles\n\nSalted and dry-roasted nuts\n\nSalt fish\n\nSoy sauce\n\nStock cubes\n\nDoes alcohol cause a puffy face?\n\nAlcohol is a diuretic that leads to general dehydration. Our skin becomes dry and can look wrinkly, but at the same time, the face can be puffy due to vasodilation. The complexion dulls but the facial skin can flush and with chronic excess alcohol ingestion the redness can become permanent with broken capillaries.\n\n'Alcohol can deprive your skin of vitamins and nutrients and can cause long-term damage – heavy drinking is linked to permanent redness and skin conditions such as rosacea, so it is important to moderate alcohol,' she warns.\n\nHow can I get rid of a puffy face?\n\n1. Get up and about\n\nWoken up with a puffy face? 'Get up and out of bed!' says Dr Shotter. 'Being upright will encourage fluid to drain from the face and swelling to reduce quicker.'\n\n2. Stay hydrated\n\nAlso, Dr Shotter recommends drinking plenty of water. 'It might sound counter-intuitive, but staying well hydrated will mean your tissue fluids are more balanced and puffiness will decrease.'\n\n3. Use a cold compress\n\nAll the experts agree that using cold water to cleanse or using skincare or facial tools straight from the fridge can help de-puff. 'Water retention can sometimes feel a bit inflamed or uncomfortable,' notes Franklin. 'The cool temperature will not only feel great but also help de-puff.'\n\n4. Try lymphatic drainage\n\nFranklin ends all her facials with a lymph draining massage using a rose quartz stone. 'We have lymph nodes all over our bodies and their purpose is to drain fluid from the tissue in the skin and transport it back to the bloodstream, however, if there’s any kind of obstruction then fluid will build up (aka water retention / puffiness).\n\n'This is where massage comes in, as it will help clear any blockages and accelerate the transportation of fluids. For example, to target puffiness around your jawline, use your Rose Quartz facial tool to sweep along your jawline with gentle pressure, sweeping from the chin towards your ear. Then, sweep downwards along the outside of your neck – always start in the middle and sweep out towards the edge of your face.'\n\n5. Exercise\n\nA workout can make all the difference to your bloated face. When you lay still and flat at night swelling accumulates around the eyes making them look puffy. Doing a workout or even just some light exercise will help.\n\n6. Try a cooling moisturiser\n\nThis uniquely cooling moisturiser is enriched with super-hydrating hyaluronic acid and is suitable for use when applied straight from the freezer for an icy, soothing saviour to combat tired and puffy skin\n\n7. Turn down your shower\n\nA hot shower may feel nice and relaxing but it can increase fluid as well as blood supply to the face, meaning you exit looking hot and puffy.\n\nTurning the heat down a notch or two is the best way to avoid this, however if you need high temperatures then just make sure to end your wash by splashing cold water on your face.\n\nHow can I get rid of a puffy face from alcohol?\n\nAs well as trying all the above, all the experts suggest skilling up on your at-home facial massage if you want to deflate a puffy face, fast.\n\nHere's how to do a facial massage for a puffy face\n\nIf you don’t have a facial massage tool, you can use your hands. Dr Craythorne recommends the following five minute facial massage for puffy faces:\n\nApply gentle but firm pressure and swipe upwards, using a gentle facial oil\n\nUse your ring finger for the eye area and gently pat around each eye, in circular motions\n\nMove your fingers across your forehead in both directions for around thirty seconds\n\nMove your fingers from below your chin using upward strokes towards your ears\n\nTap fingers around your lower jaw\n\nMove your hands from the top of your nose downwards and back upwards.\n\nGradually move your fingers and hands in sweeping motions towards your earlobes.\n\nPucker your lips together for a few seconds to stimulate blood in the mouth area and then smile widely.\n\nTo finish, move your fingers and hands from the base of your ears down to your collarbone in gentle sweeps\n\nHow to get rid of a puffy face, fast\n\nIn a rush? De-puff and cool by grabbing some trusty ice cubes that have been chilling in your freezer, wrap them up in gauze, and run over your skin, focusing on the eye and forehead areas. 'Your skin will be brighter, tighter and lifted,' says Dr Alexandrides.\n\nFollow with this Formulated with cryotherapy technology, it mimics the refreshing and detoxifying effects of extreme cold on the skin, helping to reverse the visible signs of fatigue and de-puff your face.\n\nWhat foods reduce swelling in your face?\n\nOccasional swelling can be a sign of long-term inflammatory disease so see your GP if you're concerned. In the mean time though you can also raid your fridge and pantry as certain foods can help to dial down inflammation.\n\nBananas\n\nFennel\n\nDark Green vegetables\n\nHealthy fats such whole nuts\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon and other fatty fish\n\nDark chocolate\n\nGreen tea\n\nTurmeric\n\nGinger"
