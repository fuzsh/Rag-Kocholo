        "text": "What’s the definition of adventure? What’s my definition of adventure? These are questions I asked myself when I decided that part of my work’s mission is to redefine the word’s meaning. After discovering answers to these questions, the next step was to wonder how others define adventure. What’s YOUR definition of adventure? As you read through all the choices, what fits you best? (Hint, hint…tell me how you define it in the comments below).\n\nThe Official Definition of Adventure:\n\nThe first step was to search the dictionaries for the official definitions. I remember as a kid having a monster-sized dictionary where we would look up words for fun. I’m thinking that old thing is just being used as a doorstop or for pressing flowers these days.\n\nHow I Redefine Adventure:\n\nMy personal definition was years in the making. I had always thought of adventure as ‘backpacking across Nepal’ type of thing. But then I started pushing myself to try new things under the auspice of ‘adventure.’ When I started this business, I created my tag line of “Shifting perceptions, one adventure at a time.” Over time, that’s become the meaning of adventure to me.\n\nHow Others Define Adventure:\n\nSince I’ve developed this habit of wondering, it came naturally to ask others to define the word (without looking it up!). I received so many responses, it would be challenging to include them all here. (For privacy’s sake, I’m not using full names or have changed them. In some cases, I’ve edited them for clarity and spelling.) The concepts seem to center around four categories- attitude, travel, the unknown, and excitement.\n\n1) Adventure as an Attitude\n\nAdventure is all about taking each experience, regardless if you know the outcome or not, and facing it head on. It is about seeing the world from a different perspective even if you saw it 1 million times before. It is choosing to see the beauty of the ordinary and finding ways on how to do it differently. ~Anna\n\nFollowing my curiosity. Exploring new areas in the city or nature. Being open to my own discomfort. Remembering that everything is funny. Exploration without expectation. ~Nola\n\nAdventure to me is doing something differently, whether it’s an activity, way of thinking, perspective…. or trying something new. ~Kate\n\nTo forge ahead into a plan or endeavor-that has some or all unknown elements- with current and the knowledge that the journey is the destination; An endeavor in which you are your journey/destination; A journey inward, as metaphorical experience in the outer world. ~Joanna\n\nAnything that gives you a thrill. Sometimes just hanging with a friend can turn into an adventure. It’s the way you approach life. ~Michelle\n\nAn experience that is not necessarily constrained; that reveals something new, unexpected or not; that brings joy, or educates; an event, or string of events that will always be remembered. ~Diane\n\nExploration and heightened senses. The capacity to feel that without going anywhere different necessarily. ~Loretta\n\nI’ve never been a white-water-raftin’, bungee-jumpin’ kind of girl—that’s not how I define adventure for myself. What I know for sure is this: The most important journey of our lives doesn’t necessarily involve climbing the highest peak or trekking around the world. The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.\n\nHaving the courage to stand up and pursue your dreams will give you life’s greatest reward and life’s greatest adventure.\n\nThis I know for sure: There really is no place like home. The place that speaks to the space within that resonates as you.\n\nHere in my own backyard, I find true comfort and joy (not just the Christmas carol kind) in knowing that every opportunity to open my eyes and meet a new day is an adventure all its own.\n\nThis is the real adventure of our lives: Who will you be? How will you show up when it matters?\n\n~Oprah (from “What Oprah Knows For Sure About Life’s Biggest Adventures”)\n\n2) Adventure as the unknown, out of comfort zone or a risk\n\nTo set out with excitement into the unknown. Embracing the challenges it presents, and being ready to be surprised and to surprise myself. ~Anne-Marie\n\nWillfully choosing an unknown path with the certainty that something unforgettable and unexpected will happen. ~Link\n\nStepping into the unknown…a new situation, travel, exploration. Open to not knowing, with a sense of wonder and welcome. A journey, with excitement about the newness of the experience and anticipation of what might unfold. ~Rebecca\n\nA little unknown, a little expectation, a little fear, a little off the beaten path, a little “magic,” a little not standard day – all mixed up together in a cocktail that creates a story at the end. ~Suzie\n\nAdventure requires risk. Risk requires bravery. Adventure to me is having bravery enough to take the risk with hopeful expectations that you will be rewarded with something. Be it a fun experience, a profitable tangible gain, or happiness. Maybe even fulfillment of some needed aspects such as a rush of excitement, seeking answers, or achievement of a goal. ~Debb\n\nDoing something that scares you just enough and excites you a whole bunch! Something that challenges your comfort zone or challenges you physically…I love an adventure! ~Erin\n\nStepping outside of your comfort zone – doing the unexpected – going further than usual. ~David\n\nAdventure is going out of the box with financial planning. ~Tami\n\nTo put yourself out there, take risks, and karma/Universe returns the favor. ~Hannah\n\nDoing something outside of a normal routine, out of character, 10 steps off…with a sense of exhilaration. ~Mary\n\nDoing something out of the ordinary that ignites my soul. Fun, perhaps spontaneous, involving a wee bit of risk. Ornate. Living in joy. ~Julie\n\n3) Adventure as Transformative Travel\n\nDoing something and going somewhere you never thought you’d actually do/go and when you’re there you still can’t believe it. ~Cherise\n\nGoing somewhere you have never been before and winging it! Those are usually the best adventures. ~Karen\n\nQuitting a job and taking the kids on a year-long adventure. We did one for two months and it was the best. Just scary. ~Annie\n\nTraveling someplace with my children and my man where nobody knows us and going on a nice shopping spree. Oh yes, shopping is an Adventure because sometimes some items are on\n\nCLEARANCE. When you travel to different places you find new stuff you may not have seen around your hometown. ~Sheila\n\nGoing to Florida on vacation with no place to stay for two days out of the 7. ~Ginny\n\nAttending an art exhibit and getting a meal at a highly rated restaurant I haven’t visited. Making travel plans with inspiring activities to experience. ~Holly\n\nAdventure is to explore interesting places, people, and history with the outcome of interacting with others who have a different worldview. ~Gretchen\n\nHanging out with me while in a foreign country. ~Daniela\n\nAny direction will get you there; no time constraint; and a like-minded companion. ~Jeff\n\nGetting lost and not calling it that.~ Grandma (paraphrasing her grandson, who once called getting lost an adventure!)\n\n4) Adventure as seen through the fun/exciting/new lens\n\nPursuing new experiences combined with excitement about what might occur! ~Leon\n\nDoing something that makes your heart pound. ~Lisa\n\nJumping in. Kinda my life. Exploring everything! ~Nina\n\nSomething fun & exciting with maybe an element of risk. ~Ken\n\nBeing Spontaneous. ~Roberta\n\nBeing Free. And feeling a sense of freedom… For ME. ~Deborah\n\nAdventures are fun mixed with curiosity and letting things flow. ~Terry\n\nDoing something that makes you take your breath in–and going on until you’re breathing normally again. ~Nancy\n\nAnything that makes you feel renewed. ~ Jan\n\nLiving life. We’re all winging it from one moment to the next. A giant rollercoaster. ~Boris\n\nJust getting up every morning? ~John\n\nSomething you’ve never done before that makes your body quiver with excitement. ~Jessica\n\nAdventure as an Attitude, part 2\n\nAdventure, it seems, has an element of fun excitement to most people. An element of risk is key. I still see Adventure as an Attitude, a way of looking at life. I’ll end this introspection into the meaning of adventure with two quotes from a person I admire, someone who feels his whole life has been and is an adventure, Sir Richard Branson.\n\nAdventure as a mindset allows you to see difficulties as challenges to be overcome, rather than obstacles to be failed.\n\nMaybe another adventure for me will be to connect with Richard Branson and discover his actual definition of Adventure. But for now… with all these choices you’ve read, I’d like you to tell me your definition of Adventure!"
