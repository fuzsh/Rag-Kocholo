        "text": "Here’s a quick history lesson—until the mid-1970s, most computer programs were created on punched cards. Engineers would take a piece of rectangular paper card and punch holes by hand on a keypunch machine and feed it into a card reader. The machine would then run the program. If the program produced an unexpected or incorrect result, it would probably be because an engineer punched the wrong hole in the card. The only way to fix the error was to scrap the incorrect card and replace it with a new one. This is how the software patch management process used to work back then.\n\nToday, patching has become an overly complex, cumbersome, and time-consuming process that needs robust tools and frameworks to change code and mitigate vulnerabilities. This blog explains patch management Program and its crucial to the IT device management lifecycle.\n\nWhat is Patch Management?\n\nPatch management is the process of applying updates to operating systems, applications, and firmware. It involves identifying system features that need to be improved, creating a fix, releasing the updated software, and validating the installation of the updates. The aim behind patching is to protect systems against vulnerabilities.\n\nAll devices need to be secured, whether it’s an employee’s laptop, a shared tablet at school, or a self-ordering kiosk in a quick-service restaurant. Organizations must carry out regular patching as it acts as a security tool against vulnerabilities that are caused by evolving threats, system configurations, or outdated patches.\n\nTypes of Patch management\n\nMany different types of patches exist, each serving a specific purpose. Some patches fix bugs to improve security, while others add new features to the software. These patches can be generally grouped into three main categories:\n\nSecurity patches: These patches address vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by attackers. They are essential for keeping your software safe and up-to-date.\n\nBug fix patches: These patches fix errors in the software that can cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or other problems. They can improve the stability and reliability of your software.\n\nFeature patches: These patches add new features to the software. They can improve the functionality of the software and make it more useful for users.\n\nWhat Are the Steps of Patch Management Process?\n\nThe patch management process works depending on whether a patch is applied to a standalone system or numerous systems in an enterprise’s network. Irrespective of the environment, there are three key steps involved in the patching workflow:\n\nStep 1 – Vulnerability Scanning\n\nThis step involves a complete inventory check of all open vulnerabilities on all assets. It’s essential to check all devices in the company’s IT environment that have access to detailed hardware and software information.\n\nStep 2 – Prioritization Strategy\n\nPrioritization is key to ensuring that the effort of patching under scarce resources is expended toward maximum risk reduction.\n\nStep 3 – Patch Management\n\nOnce a clear software patching strategy has been articulated and the vulnerabilities to be addressed have been prioritized, it is vital to use effective tools to discover patches from vendors and automate patching at scale. Finding and using the right patch management tools can significantly reduce the effort involved in patching.\n\nBest Practices for Patch Management\n\nFailing to patch software leaves organizations exposed to vulnerabilities that can be easily avoided. Industry best practice is to keep applications, operating systems, firmware, and services up to date with the latest security patches. Patches should be applied according to schedule and after discovering new vulnerabilities.\n\n1. Categorize by Risk and Priority\n\nFrom the patch management software perspective, not all applications, systems, and platforms are equal. After collecting an inventory of devices, segment all users and systems based on priority, such as risk level and the number of applicable and available patches.\n\n2. Utilize a Patch-Testing Environment\n\nOnce a patch is released, there’s no guarantee that it will perform without any snag. Create a patching testing lab environment that mirrors the production environment. After patches are deployed in the lab, the IT security staff should monitor these for any updates and check to see if any breaks occur.\n\n3. Patch Approval\n\nIt can be either manual or automated. The sheer volume of patch installation across enterprise servers, appliances, and the cloud can become an operational nightmare with the manual approach. Automated patch management tools are more sophisticated and automate repetitive, tedious tasks to shorten the time between a patch’s release and its implementation.\n\n4. Patch Distribution\n\nAfter approval, it’s time to roll out the patches. As a practice, deploy patches to a select group of devices after business hours. Monitor those patches and implement a disaster recovery plan if needed. Later, the deployment process to different device groups will be automated with patch management software.\n\n5. Document the Patch Management Process\n\nOnce a document has been applied, it is important to check for improvements in the patching process. Keep a record of the process and procedure under the company’s IT security policies and procedures documentation. After deployment, use the patch management Program to produce a report of the status of your devices.\n\nBenefits of Patch Management\n\nIn addition to protecting systems from vulnerabilities, a patch management system also presents organizations with several other benefits:\n\n1. Employee Productivity\n\nPatching ensures software and applications are up-to-date and run smoothly, supporting system uptime. It helps improve overall employee productivity by minimizing downtime caused by outdated or unsupported software.\n\n2. Compliance\n\nPatch management is commonly required by security frameworks or standards such as ISO 27001 Annex A, PCI DSS, or NIST Cyber Security Framework. Failure to comply with patch updates could result in fines, sanctions, or other penalties.\n\n3. Lower Costs\n\nPatching lowers the cost of device lifecycle management and repair. With a dispersed workforce, businesses have had to pivot quickly to provide support. Remote mobile device management tools extend the abilities of IT staff, lowering the need for costly on-site visits.\n\nThe Patch Management Lifecycle\n\nPatch management is a continuous lifecycle because vendors regularly release new patches. It ensures that software patches are efficiently managed and deployed across an organization’s IT environment. Furthermore, a company’s patching needs may change as its IT environment changes.\n\nOrganizations establish formal patch management policies to outline the best practices that admins and end users should follow throughout the lifecycle. This process involves several key stages, each essential for maintaining the security, functionality, and compliance of IT assets. The stages of the patch management lifecycle include:\n\nAsset Management\n\nAsset management is the foundation of the patch management lifecycle. In this stage, IT and security teams create a comprehensive inventory of all network assets, including third-party applications, operating systems, mobile devices, and both remote and on-premises endpoints. Standardizing the hardware and software versions across the organization simplifies the patching process by reducing the diversity of assets. This standardization also ensures that employees are not using outdated, unsafe, or incompatible applications and devices, which could otherwise complicate the patching process.\n\nPatch Monitoring\n\nOnce the asset inventory is established, the next stage in patch management lifecycle is patch monitoring. IT and security teams continuously watch for the release of new patches and track the patch status of each asset within the organization. This stage is crucial for identifying assets that are missing patches and ensuring that all systems are up-to-date with the latest security and functionality updates. Effective patch monitoring enables teams to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities and maintain the integrity of the IT environment.\n\nPatch Prioritization\n\nNot all patches are created equal, and some are more critical than others, particularly when it comes to security. In this stage of patch management lifecycle, IT and security teams use resources like threat intelligence feeds to identify the most critical vulnerabilities within their systems. Patches addressing these high-risk vulnerabilities are prioritized over less essential updates. By focusing on the\n\nWhy is Patch Management Important for Enterprises\n\nCyber threats are multiplying rapidly, with software vulnerabilities and ransomware attacks on the rise. Patching all devices—servers, desktops, laptops for remote offices and home workers—across a complex network can be a daunting task for businesses. While managing these patches manually might seem like a cost-saving option, it’s both inefficient and risky. Patch management tools offer a far more secure and streamlined approach.\n\nPatch management Process isn’t just another IT chore—it’s a critical line of defense for your entire organization. Here’s how:\n\nFortress against cyberattacks: Patches fix vulnerabilities in software and applications, acting as shields against cyberattacks. Unpatched systems are easy targets, potentially leading to devastating breaches.\n\nCompliance without complications: Regulatory requirements are becoming stricter. A strong patch management strategy ensures all your devices comply with the latest standards, keeping you on the right side of the law.\n\nBeyond bug fixes: Patches aren’t just about security. They often introduce new features and functionalities, improving usability and making life easier for your end users.\n\nKeeping downtime at bay: Ransomware and other cyber threats can cripple your systems, costing valuable time and money. Patch management Program keeps your devices updated and secure, minimizing the risk of downtime caused by security breaches.\n\nHow to Implement Patch Management in Your Organization\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how to implement effective patch management across your network’s systems:\n\n1. Seeing the Big Picture: Centralized Visibility\n\nFirst things first: you need a clear view of all your network devices. This centralized view allows IT admins to understand each system’s patching status. With this knowledge, they can prioritize critical and important patches for timely deployment.\n\n2. Scheduling Deployments: Balancing Security and Productivity\n\nFinding the right time to patch is crucial. Disruptions during work hours can be a pain for employees. Patch management tools can help by scheduling deployments based on user availability and system uptime data. These tools can also automate patch deployment based on pre-defined policies. This includes configuring settings like automatic reboots after installation.\n\n3. Patching Every Corner of the Network\n\nFor businesses with a global workforce, patching strategies need to be comprehensive. This includes systems on the local network (LAN), remote offices (WAN), and even employee homes (for remote work).\n\n4. Testing and Reverting Patches: Safety First\n\nBefore unleashing patches on your systems, always test them first. This ensures they function correctly without causing any issues. Once tested, deployment can proceed smoothly. However, even tested patches can sometimes go awry. That’s why it’s important to have a rollback plan in place. This allows admins to uninstall problematic patches from all affected systems.\n\nEffective Patch Management With Scalefusion MDM\n\nCompanies can fall behind on patching for many reasons, including talent shortages, infrastructure complexity, and software compatibility issues.
