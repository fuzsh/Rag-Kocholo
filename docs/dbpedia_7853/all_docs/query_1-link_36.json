        "text": "The Cyber Security Breaches Survey is a research study for UK cyber resilience, aligning with the National Cyber Strategy. It is primarily used to inform government policy on cyber security, making the UK cyberspace a secure place to do business. The study explores the policies, processes and approach to cyber security for businesses, charities, and educational institutions. It also considers the different cyber attacks and cyber crimes these organisations face, as well as how these organisations are impacted and respond.\n\nFor this latest release, the quantitative survey was carried out in winter 2022/23 and the qualitative element in early 2023.\n\nResponsible analyst:\n\nEmma Johns\n\nResponsible statistician:\n\nMaddy Ell\n\nStatistical enquiries:\n\ncybersurveys@dsit.gov.uk\n\nSummary\n\nIdentification of cyber security breaches and attacks\n\nCyber security breaches and attacks remain a common threat. However, smaller organisations are identifying them less than last year. This may reflect that senior managers in smaller organisations view cyber security as less of a priority in the current economic climate than in previous years, so are undertaking less monitoring and logging of breaches or attacks.\n\n32% of businesses and 24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months. This is much higher for medium businesses (59%), large businesses (69%) and high-income charities with £500,000 or more in annual income (56%).\n\nThis is a decrease from 39% of businesses and 30% of charities in 2022. The drop is driven by smaller organisations – the results for medium and large businesses, and high-income charities, remain at similar levels to last year.\n\nAmong those identifying any breaches or attacks, we estimate that the single most disruptive breach from the last 12 months cost each business, of any size, an average of approximately £1,100. For medium and large businesses, this was approximately £4,960. For charities, it was approximately £530.\n\nThe proportion of micro businesses saying cyber security is a high priority has decreased from 80% in 2022 to 68% this year. Qualitative evidence suggests that cyber security has dropped down the priority lists for these smaller organisations, relative to wider economic concerns like inflation and uncertainty.\n\nCyber hygiene\n\nThe most common cyber threats are relatively unsophisticated, so government guidance advises businesses and charities to protect themselves using a set of “cyber hygiene” measures. A majority of businesses and charities have a broad range of these measures in place. The most common are updated malware protection, cloud back-ups, passwords, restricted admin rights and network firewalls – each administered by two-thirds or more of businesses and half or more charities. However, across the last three waves of the survey, some areas of cyber hygiene have seen consistent declines among businesses. This includes:\n\nuse of password policies (79% in 2021, vs. 70% in 2023)\n\nuse of network firewalls (78% in 2021 vs. 66% in 2023)\n\nrestricting admin rights (75% in 2021, vs. 67% in 2023)\n\npolicies to apply software security updates within 14 days (43% in 2021, vs. 31% in 2023).\n\nThese trends mainly reflect shifts in the micro business population and, to a lesser extent, small and medium businesses – large business results have not changed.\n\nRisk management and supply chains\n\nA larger proportion of businesses take actions to identify cyber risks than charities. Larger businesses are the most advanced in this regard. For the first time, the majority of large businesses are reviewing supply chain risks, although this is still relatively rare across organisations overall.\n\nThree in ten businesses have undertaken cyber security risk assessments (29%, vs. 27% of charities) in the last year – rising to 51% of medium businesses and 63% of large businesses.\n\nA similar proportion of businesses deployed security monitoring tools (30%, vs. 19% of charities) – rising to 53% of medium businesses and 72% of large businesses.\n\nUnder four in ten businesses (37%) and a third of charities (33%) report being insured against cyber security risks – rising to 63% of medium businesses and 55% of large businesses (i.e. cyber insurance is more common in medium businesses than large ones).\n\nJust over one in ten businesses say they review the risks posed by their immediate suppliers (13%, vs. 11% of charities). More medium businesses (27%) and large businesses (55%) review immediate supplier risks. The latter result is up from 44% of large businesses in 2022.\n\nQualitative data suggests that receiving messaging around supply chain risks from bodies such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), or having the topic raised in audits, helps encourage organisations to take action in this area.\n\nBoard engagement and corporate governance\n\nBoard engagement and corporate governance approaches towards cyber security tend to be more sophisticated in larger organisations, although corporate reporting of cyber risks remains relatively uncommon, even among large businesses.\n\nThree in ten businesses (30%) and charities (31%) have board members or trustees explicitly responsible for cyber security as part of their job role – rising to 41% of medium businesses and 53% of large businesses.\n\n21% of medium businesses and 30% of large businesses have heard of the NCSC’s Board Toolkit – rising from 11% and 22% respectively in 2020 (when it was introduced).\n\n49% of medium businesses, 68% of large businesses and 36% of high-income charities have a formal cyber security strategy in place. Qualitative data suggests the impetus to develop strategies can come from management board pressure, audits and business acquisition. It can also coincide with cyber teams gaining operational independence, for example from IT departments.\n\nIn the last year, 16% of corporate annual reports across medium businesses covered cyber risks, rising to 33% of the reports published by large businesses. Across charities (of all income groups), 9% of these reports covered cyber risks.\n\nQualitative data shows a similar set of issues to previous years that prevent boards from engaging more in cyber security, including a lack of knowledge, training and time. It also highlights the importance of people in cyber roles being able to write persuasive business cases for cyber security spending, especially when they report directly to finance leads.\n\nCyber accreditations and following guidance\n\nThe proportion of organisations seeking external information or guidance on cyber security remains stable, at almost half. However, this means that a sizeable proportion of organisations, including larger organisations, continue to be unaware of government guidance such as the 10 Steps to Cyber Security, and the government-endorsed Cyber Essentials standard. Linked to this, relatively few organisations at present are adhering to recognised standards or accreditations, such as Cyber Essentials or ISO 27001.\n\n49% of businesses and 44% of charities report seeking information or guidance on cyber security from outside their organisation in the past year, most commonly from external cyber security consultants, IT consultants or IT service providers.\n\n14% of businesses and 19% of charities are aware of the 10 Steps guidance – rising to 32% of medium businesses and 44% of large businesses. Nevertheless, around two-fifths of businesses (37%) and three in ten charities (30%) have taken action on 5 or more of the 10 Steps. This is much more common in medium businesses (75%) and large businesses (89%). Just 2% of businesses and charities have enacted all 10 Steps, increasing to 7% of medium businesses and 20% of large businesses.\n\n14% of businesses and 15% of charities are aware of the Cyber Essentials scheme – rising to 50% of medium businesses and 59% of large businesses.\n\nA total of 9% of businesses and 5% of charities report adhering to ISO 27001. This is again higher among large businesses (27%).\n\nQualitative findings suggest the desire to seek external accreditation can be because clients demand it. It can also be a convenient way for organisations to generate a standardised set of documentation on their cyber security standards, or to enforce or speed up a positive change in their staff culture.\n\nIncident response\n\nWhile a large majority of organisations say that they will take several actions following a cyber incident, in reality a minority have agreed processes already in place to support this. This highlights an area for ongoing improvement for the study to continue monitoring next year.\n\nThe most common processes, mentioned by between a quarter and two-fifths of businesses and charities, are having specific roles and responsibilities assigned to individuals, having guidance on external reporting, and guidance on internal reporting.\n\nFormal incident response plans are not widespread (21% of businesses and 16% of charities have them). This rises to 47% of medium-sized businesses, 64% of large businesses and 38% of high-income charities.\n\nQualitative findings suggest another area for potential improvement is the relative disconnect between IT or specialist cyber teams and wider staff (including management boards) when it comes to incident response. Bridging this gap was felt to require good, regular communication between IT teams and wider staff. Post-incident reviews were also seen as a way to engage wider staff in cyber security.\n\nCyber crime\n\nSome cyber security breaches and attacks do not constitute cyber crimes under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and the Home Office Counting Rules. New questions were added this year to establish the extent to which the breaches or attacks that organisations experience could be defined as cyber crimes committed against them, using the principles in the Home Office Counting Rules. Further new questions explored the extent of fraud that occurred as a result of cyber crime. More detail about definitions of cyber crime and the rationale for expanding the survey in this way can be found in Chapter 6.\n\nAs this is the first year these questions have been asked and there is no baseline for comparison, users should be relatively cautious when interpreting these statistics.\n\nThe findings show that cyber crime is more prevalent among larger organisations, although this may be a sign of underreporting among smaller organisations.\n\nA total of 11% of businesses and 8% of charities have experienced cyber crime in the last 12 months, rising to 26% of medium businesses, 37% of large businesses and 25% of high-income charities. Looked at another way, among the 32% businesses and 24% of charities identifying any cyber security breaches or attacks, around a third (34% for businesses and 32% for charities) ended up being victims of cyber crime.\n\nSeparately, a total of 3% of businesses and 1% of charities have been victims of fraud as a result of cyber crime. This accounts for 9% of the businesses and 6% of the charities that identify any cyber security breaches or attacks.\n\nWe estimate that, across all UK businesses, there were approximately 2.39 million instances of cyber crime and approximately 49,000 instances of fraud as a result of cyber crime in the last 12 months. Across charities, there were approximately 785,000 cyber crimes over this period. The sample sizes do not allow us to estimate the scale of fraud resulting from cyber crime across charities. It should be noted that these estimates of scale will have a relatively wide margin of error.\n\nThe average (mean) annual cost of cyber crime for businesses is estimated at approximately £15,300 per victim. The sample sizes do not allow this cost calculation for charities.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\n\n1.1 Code of practice for statistics\n\nThe Cyber Security Breaches Survey is an official statistic and has been produced to the standards set out in the Code of Practice for Statistics.\n\n1.2 Background\n\nPublication date: April 2023\n\nGeographic coverage: United Kingdom\n\nThe Department for Science, Technology and Innovation (DSIT), in partnership with the Home Office, commissioned the Cyber Security Breaches Survey of UK businesses, charities and education institutions as part of the National Cyber Security Programme.[footnote 1] The findings of this survey provide a comprehensive description of cyber security for a representative sample of UK organisations, which provides a snapshot of UK cyber resilience at this point in time. It tells us about the cyber threats organisations face and the actions they are taking to stay secure. It also supports the government to shape future policy in this area, in line with the National Cyber Strategy 2022.\n\nTo increase the value of these statistics, the 2023 iteration of the study includes, for the first time, estimates of cyber crime, and fraud that occurred as a result of cyber crime (see Chapter 6). As this is the first year these questions have been asked and there is no baseline for comparison, users should be relatively cautious when interpreting these statistics. They should ideally be considered alongside other, related evidence on computer misuse, such as the statistics for retail and wholesale premises collected in the 2021 Commercial Victimisation Survey (CVS), and the general public statistics from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The Cyber Security Breaches Survey adds to the broad picture from these other surveys by looking at these types of crimes across all economic sectors.\n\nThe research was conducted by the independent research organisation Ipsos. The project requirements and reporting are approved by DSIT and the Home Office. For the 2023 publication this includes coverage of the following areas:\n\nprioritisation, information seeking (including use of government guidance) and decision making on cyber security, including among organisations’ management boards\n\ncyber security approaches, covering risk management (including cyber insurance and supply chain risks), technical controls, staff training and responsibilities and governance\n\nthe cyber threat landscape, including identification of cyber security breaches or attacks, their outcomes and impacts, their estimated financial cost\n\nincident response approaches and reporting of cyber security breaches or attacks\n\nthe prevalence, nature, scale and financial costs of cyber crime, as well as the prevalence, nature and scale of fraud that occurred as a result of cyber crime.\n\nThis 2023 publication follows previous surveys in this series, published annually since 2016. In each publication year, the quantitative fieldwork has taken place in the winter of the preceding year (for example, in winter 2022/23, for this latest survey).\n\nThis Statistical Release focuses on the business and charity outcomes. The results for educational institutions have been included in a separate Education Annex.\n\n1.3 Methodology\n\nAs in previous years, there were two strands to the Cyber Security Breaches Survey:\n\nWe undertook a random probability telephone and online survey of 2,263 UK businesses, 1,174 UK registered charities and 554 education institutions from 27 September 2022 to 18 January 2023. The data for businesses and charities have been weighted to be statistically representative of these two populations.\n\nWe carried out 44 in-depth interviews between December 2022 and January 2023, to gain further qualitative insights from some of the organisations that answered the survey.\n\nSole traders and public-sector organisations were outside the scope of the survey. In addition, businesses with no IT capacity or online presence were deemed ineligible. These exclusions are consistent with previous years, and the survey is considered comparable across years.\n\nThe educational institutions, covered in the separate Education Annex, comprise 241 primary schools, 217 secondary schools, 44 further education colleges and 52 higher education institutions.\n\nMore technical details and a copy of the questionnaire are available in the separately published Technical Annex.\n\n1.4 Changes since the 2022 study\n\nThe core approach for the 2023 study – data collected from organisations via a random-probability survey, predominantly conducted by telephone – is unchanged from the previous iterations. As such, we continue to make comparisons to previous years. Nevertheless, this year, we made more substantial changes to aspects of the methodology than in previous years. These changes were necessary to be able to deliver the larger sample sizes required this year, in order to explore the new topic of cyber crime. In total, we interviewed 3,991 respondents across all types of organisation (vs. 2,157 in 2022). We also undertook a higher number of qualitative follow-up interviews (44, vs. 35 in 2022).\n\nThe noteworthy changes to the methodology were as follows, with full details in the Technical Annex:\n\nWe changed the sample frame for businesses from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) to the Market Location business database. This was done to improve the overall sample quality, accuracy and telephone coverage. The sample frames for charities and education institutions were consistent with previous years.\n\nWe adopted a multimode data collection approach, allowing organisations to take part partially or fully online as well as by phone.\n\nWe substantially increased the use of split-sampling in the survey, where certain questions are only asked to a random half of the sample.\n\nThe mapping of the questionnaire to the government’s 10 Steps to Cyber Security guidance has changed, following a review by Professor Steven Furnell from the University of Nottingham. This is fully explained in Section 3.9.\n\nTo note, these changes do not prevent us from making year-on-year comparisons. The Technical Annex lays out the steps taken to validate trends and check for mode effects. While we are confident in the trend findings reported throughout, we cannot definitively rule out any potential impact that a change in the sample frame may have had on the business findings. Therefore, in all the charted trend data, we have used a dotted line to mark the trend for businesses from 2022 to 2023. This is simply to suggest to readers that any shifts should be treated with appropriate caution. Further years of data will help to validate the trend.\n\n1.5 Interpretation of findings\n\nHow to interpret the quantitative data\n\nThe survey results are subject to margins of error, which vary with the size of the sample and the percentage figure concerned. For all percentage[footnote 2] results, subgroup differences have been highlighted only where statistically significant (at the 95% level of confidence).[footnote 3] This includes comparison by size, sector, and previous years. By extension, where we do not comment on differences across years, for example in line charts, this is specifically because they are not statistically significant differences.\n\nThere is a further guide to statistical reliability at the end of this release.\n\nSubgroup definitions and conventions\n\nFor businesses, analysis by size splits the population into micro businesses (1 to 9 employees), small businesses (10 to 49 employees), medium businesses (50 to 249 employees) and large businesses (250 employees or more).\n\nFor charities, analysis by size is primarily considered in terms of annual income band, specifically looking at the subgroups of high-income charities (with annual incomes of £500,000 or more) and very high-income charities (£5 million or more). The sample size for charities (1,174) has substantially increased this year compared to the 2022 sample size (424).\n\nDue to the relatively small sample sizes for certain business sectors, these have been grouped with similar sectors for more robust analysis. Business sector groupings referred to across this report, and their respective SIC 2007 sectors, are:\n\nadministration and real estate (L and N)\n\nagriculture, forestry, and fishing (A)\n\nconstruction (F)\n\neducation (P)[footnote 4]\n\nhealth, social care, and social work (Q)\n\nentertainment, service, and membership organisations (R and S)\n\nfinance and insurance (K)\n\nfood and hospitality (I)\n\ninformation and communications (J)\n\nutilities and production (including manufacturing) (B, C, D and E)\n\nprofessional, scientific, and technical (M)\n\nretail and wholesale (including vehicle sales and repairs) (G)\n\ntransport and storage (H).\n\nAnalysis of organisation cyber security split by geographical region is considered to be out of the scope of this reporting. While we may occasionally provide data specific for UK regions (at International Territorial Level 1), we recommend caution in attributing these differences to actions taken or not taken by that region – regional differences may also be attributable to the size and sector profile of the sample in that region.\n\nWhere figures in charts do not add to 100%, or to an associated net score, this is due to rounding of percentages or because the questions allow more than one response.\n\nHow to interpret the qualitative data\n\nThe qualitative findings offer more nuanced insights into the attitudes and behaviours of businesses and charities with regards to cyber security. The findings reported here represent common themes emerging across multiple interviews. Insights and verbatim quotes from individual organisations are used to illustrate findings that emerged more broadly across interviews. However, as with any qualitative findings, these examples are not intended to be statistically representative.\n\n1.6 Acknowledgements\n\nIpsos UK, DSIT and the Home Office would like to thank all the organisations and individuals who participated in the survey. We would also like to thank the organisations who supported the survey development work, endorsed the fieldwork, and encouraged organisations to participate, including:\n\nthe Association of British Insurers (ABI)\n\nthe Charity Commission for England and Wales\n\nthe Charity Commission for Northern Ireland\n\nthe Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW)\n\nJisc, a not-for-profit company that provides digital infrastructure, services, and guidance for UK further and higher education institutions\n\nthe Office for National Statistics (ONS)\n\nthe Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR)\n\nUCISA (formerly known as the Universities and Colleges Information Systems Association).\n\nChapter 2: Awareness and attitudes\n\nThis chapter explores:\n\nprioritisation of cyber security within organisations\n\nreceiving and reacting to information and guidance about cyber security\n\nqualitative data on how organisations make decisions on cyber security.\n\n2.1 Perceived importance of cyber security\n\nAround seven in ten businesses (71%) and six in 10 charities (62%) report that cyber security is a high priority for their senior management. A roughly equal proportion say this is a very high or fairly high priority (Figure 2.1).\n\nWhile these are strong majorities, both results represent an apparent decrease in prioritisation from last year – this is explored in more detail in the next section (see Figure 2.2).\n\nIn interpreting this question, it is worth noting that in smaller organisations, the individuals responsible for cyber security – i.e. the ones who completed this survey – tend to be senior management, so are answering with regards to their own views. In larger organisations, these individuals may not be part of senior management, so their answers will reflect their own perceptions of their senior management team’s views.\n\nFigure 2.1: Extent to which cyber security is seen as a high or low priority for directors, trustees, and other senior managers\n\nOrganisation type % very high % fairly high % fairly low % very low % don’t know Businesses overall 36 35 19 8 2 Charities overall 30 32 22 12 3\n\nBases: 1,152 UK businesses; 570 charities\n\nIt is more common for larger businesses to say that cyber security is a high priority (91% of medium businesses and 96% of large businesses, vs. 71% overall). The same is true for high-income charities (90% of those with income of £500,000 or more, vs. 62% overall). This continues the pattern seen in all previous years, where larger organisations tend to treat cyber security more seriously, and consequently allocate more resources to it.\n\nBusinesses in the following sectors tend to treat cyber security as a higher priority than others:\n\nfinance and insurance (73% say it is a “very” high priority, vs. 36% of all businesses)\n\nprofessional, scientific and technical (46% a “very” high priority)\n\ninformation and communications (86% a “very” or “fairly” high priority, vs. 71% overall).\n\nIn previous years, the health, social care and social work sector has consistently reported a higher prioritisation of cyber security. This year, due to low sample sizes for this subsector at this question, this difference cannot be validated statistically. However, in other areas such as governance and risk management (covered in Chapter 3), this sector remains ahead of others.\n\nBy contrast, and in line with previous years, food and hospitality businesses tend to regard cyber security as a lower priority than those in other sectors (only 58% say it is a high priority, vs. 71% of businesses overall).\n\nBusinesses in the South East tend to place a higher prioritisation on cyber security than the average UK business this year (80% say it is a high priority, vs. 71% overall). This does not, however, reflect a consistent trend from previous years. There are no other geographic regions this year that stand out ahead of others.\n\nTrends over time\n\nFigure 2.2 shows how the prioritisation score has changed over time. At face value, cyber security has become less of a priority among both businesses and charities, reversing a consistent rising trend for businesses in earlier years.\n\nWhile there were more substantive changes to the survey methodology this year, such as a change in the business sample frame, we do not believe these to be the cause of this reversal. There is good evidence from the qualitative interviews, covered later in this section, that helps to explain the trend. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out any potential impact that a change in the sample frame may have had. Therefore, on Figure 2.2 and similar charts across this report, we have used a dotted line to mark the trend for businesses from 2022 to 2023. This is simply to suggest to readers that any trends should be treated with appropriate caution. Further years of data will help to validate the trend.\n\nFigure 2.2: Percentage of organisations over time where cyber security is seen as a high priority for directors, trustees, and other senior managers\n\nPrimarily, there has been a shift in the proportion saying cyber security is a “fairly” high priority (e.g. from 44% of businesses last year, to 35% this year). The proportions of businesses and charities saying it is a very high priority is more consistent with last year. This potentially creates a clearer distinction this year between the organisations that have maintained their cyber security despite increasing challenges in the business environment, and those where it might be seen as competing against other business challenges or priorities – further evidenced in this year’s qualitative findings.\n\nThe drop in overall prioritisation in businesses is also more concentrated among micro businesses (down from 80% in 2022 to 68% this year saying cyber security is a high priority). In other words, cyber security has dropped down the agenda among the businesses where it was already seen as a more marginal priority, and among the businesses that typically have the fewest resources to deploy. By contrast, among small, medium and large businesses, there has been no statistically significant shift in findings:\n\n83% of small businesses say it is a high priority (vs. 87% in 2022)\n\n91% of medium businesses say this (vs. 92% in 2022)\n\n96% of large businesses say this (vs. 95% in 2022).\n\nSimilarly, for high-income charities, the result is not significantly different from last year (90% in 2023, vs. 92% in 2022). By contrast, the result for low-income charities (with under £100,000 in annual income) has dropped by 14 percentage points (from 67% to 53%).\n\nIt is worth noting that, in each year of this survey, larger organisations have identified substantially more cyber security breaches and attacks than smaller ones (see Section 4.1). In this sense, it is those at greatest risk that have maintained their prioritisation of cyber security. Nevertheless, it is also important to note that most organisations are small. For example, micro businesses account for 82% of all UK businesses (if excluding those with zero employees). Therefore, this drop has significant implications for vast swathes of the business community.\n\nThe fall is broadly spread across economic sectors and across regions. The largest percentage point changes are in entertainment, service and membership organisations (down 29 points to 66%) and retailers and wholesalers (down 16 points to 66%).\n\nQualitative insights on cyber security prioritisation in the current economic and geopolitical environment\n\nThe qualitative interviews suggest that these survey findings – the lower proportion of organisations seeing cyber security as a priority this year – may be linked to changes in the external business environment. Various organisations highlighted that they faced rising costs and more difficulty with financial planning, due to inflation, higher energy prices and uncertainty about the economic situation.\n\nThere was a sense across interviews that the topic had dropped down the priority list among senior managers, relative to these wider concerns. This seemed to have hit smaller businesses and charities the hardest, given that the same senior individuals taking responsibility for cyber security in these organisations were also dealing with all the other general pressures facing their organisations. One interviewee, the Head of Finance in a high-income charity, highlighted that there were constant pressures to control their use of donor money and that they were nervous about their expected income in the coming year. The following quotes, respectively from a small hospitality business and a machinery retail and repair business, also highlights the focus on survival, leading to a reactive rather than proactive approach to cyber security:\n\nAt the same time, many of the organisations we spoke to were keen to stress that they had not decreased their spending on cyber security in the face of such pressures. Moreover, larger organisations tended to have maintained their levels of board engagement over the past year (covered fully in Section 2.2), rather than reining back. However, some interviewees flagged that the current situation may make budget negotiations harder for future years, if not now.\n\nThere were exceptions – organisations saying that cyber security had become a higher priority over the past year – but this was typically off the back of a cyber incident, or near-miss, within the organisation or the industry. For example, one senior manager from a high-income charity described how they had sped up a planned audit of their cyber security approach in response to other charities in their sector getting attacked. The charity had, following the audit, increased their cyber security budget, refreshed their policies around use of hardware and mobile phones, brought in mandatory training on phishing, and were planning to formally test their business recovery plan later in the year. Without this catalyst, organisations tended to take a reactive approach, where they would look at individual problems as and when they arose.\n\nHowever, even in this case, this senior manager admitted that their trustees found it hard to understand the risks, and relied heavily on the cyber security experts within the charity.\n\nBy comparison, recent geopolitical events were felt to have a more limited impact on organisations’ behaviour, and only impacted certain kinds of organisations. Where organisations had an international presence, or international clients, there was typically more awareness and concern about increasing cyber threats from countries such as Russia (linked in interviews to the war in Ukraine), Iran and China. Some organisations had blocked all traffic from these countries.\n\nThere were some instances where larger businesses that traded internationally had taken a different response to state-sponsored attacks than to other types of cyber security beaches or attacks. The broad examples offered included changing the list of critical assets to be protected, giving more tailored training given to staff, and influencing where incidents are reported. For example, one large business specifically mentioned they would be more likely to report a state-sponsored attack to Action Fraud.\n\nFor other organisations outside these large multinationals, stories in the media about state-sponsored cyber attacks could rouse the general interest of senior managers. However, such attacks were often not viewed as a threat for their organisations, worthy of special attention.\n\nMoreover, the impact of such news stories was often felt to be impermanent, rather than leading to a lasting change in the senior management or staff culture. In this particular case in a large tech manufacturer, it led to a short-term increase in reporting by the IT manager, moving from monthly to weekly written updates to the board, on top of existing quarterly presentations being delivered by the Chief Information Security Officer.\n\nSome organisations, such as the following high-income charity, also suggested that they could not reasonably change their cyber security approach to match a shifting geopolitical threat, because they had limited information on the source of the attacks they were facing.\n\nAnother small business pointed out that even if their incident reports mentioned a specific country, the attack that led to the incident may not have originated there, making it challenging and potentially not useful to have a targeted response.\n\n2.2 Involvement of senior management\n\nFigure 2.3 breaks down how often senior managers get updates on the state of cyber security and any actions being taken. It shows that updates tend to be more frequent in businesses than in charities, continuing a trend from previous years.\n\nThis year, this question was restricted to medium and large businesses, and to high-income charities. While the subgroup results are comparable across years, Figure 2.3 should not be directly compared to the equivalent figure from last year’s report given the changes in the groups being reported.\n\nThe new chart highlights that large businesses are also ahead of medium businesses in this respect, while high-income charities are behind both business subgroups. Two-thirds of medium businesses (65%) and eight in ten large businesses (81%) update their senior team at least quarterly, while just over half of all high-income charities (54%) also do this. Four-fifths of these businesses (79% of medium businesses and 86% of large businesses) and a similar proportion of these charities (80%) say senior managers are updated at least once a year.[footnote 5]\n\nThe results for these subgroups are similar to last year. Nevertheless, when taking a longer-term view, it is worth noting that in 2016 (the first year of this study), 71% of large businesses reported updating senior managers on cyber security on a quarterly basis, compared with 81% now. This suggests that, among large businesses, senior management discussion of cyber security is now more of a business-as-usual approach. Previous years of the study indicated that this was also the trend among smaller businesses, as well as large ones.\n\nFigure 2.3: How often directors, trustees or other senior managers are given an update on any actions taken around cyber security\n\nBoard responsibilities\n\nThree in ten businesses (30%) and a similar proportion of charities (31%) have board members or trustees taking explicit responsibility for cyber security as part of their job (Figure 2.4). This is across all organisations (i.e. not just those that have a formal management board) – although all registered charities have boards of trustees.\n\nAs might be expected, board-level responsibility is much more common in larger businesses, where the management board is likely to be larger. Around half of large businesses (53%) have a board member responsible for cyber security (vs. 30% of businesses overall). There is less variation in size among charities – for instance, a third (33%) of charities with incomes of £5 million or more have trustees responsible for cyber security (not significantly different from the 31% average).\n\nFigure 2.4: Percentage of organisations with board members or trustees that have responsibility for cyber security\n\nBusinesses overall 30% Micro businesses 28% Small businesses 34% Medium businesses 41% Large businesses 53% Within information and communications 49% Within finance and insurance 44% Within professional, scientific and technical 41% Charities overall 31%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,387 micro businesses; 400 small businesses; 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 161 information and communications businesses; 178 finance and insurance businesses; 285 professional, scientific and technical businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nInformation and communications businesses (49%), finance and insurance businesses (44%) and professional, scientific and technical businesses (41%) are each more likely than average to have board members taking responsibility for cyber security. These sectors, which tend to prioritise cyber security more, were also above average in the 2022 and 2021 surveys. At the other end of the scale, businesses in agriculture (17%), construction (21%) and food and hospitality (22%) are among the least likely to have board members assigned this role.\n\nTrends over time\n\nFigure 2.5 shows the trend over time for board members taking on cyber security responsibilities. Among businesses, it suggests a decline in board engagement since the 2021 study, which was the first where fieldwork took place under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmong charities, this year’s result represents an increase from last year (31% vs. 26%).\n\nFigure 2.5: Percentage of organisations over time with board members or trustees with responsibility for cyber security\n\nQualitative insights on formal versus informal board engagement\n\nIn qualitative interviews, the individuals taking day-to-day responsibility for cyber security highly valued engagement from senior board members, as it helped them to get the buy-in of wider staff (e.g. when cyber security directives came with the backing of senior management), to challenge and improve their own approaches, and to get quicker approval for new measures.\n\nHowever, we heard several recurring reasons to explain why board members did not engage, including a lack of understanding or interest in cyber security relative to the day-to-day operations of the organisation, a lack of training, a lack of time and a perception that their kind of organisation was not facing an especially high risk from cyber attacks. The following quote discusses a senior management team who were considered good at their own roles, but tended to leave cyber security matters to the finance director, operations manager and the interviewee (in a human resources role), who dealt with their third-party IT support.\n\nThe following example from a transport business highlights differing attitudes within the management board when being taken through a cyber awareness course:\n\nThe findings suggest board engagement becomes more structured and formal as organisations grow. Some of the larger organisations we spoke to had regular cyber security reports going to the board, had cyber security as a standing agenda item at board meetings (or at a subcommittee level just below the board), or reviewed cyber security as part of a regular look at their risk register. One high-income charity had webinar training designed specifically for their Chief Executive and Trustees that explained their specific role in supporting cyber security in the organisation, including supporting resource allocation and setting a good example.\n\nBy contrast, in small and medium-sized organisations, the approaches for keeping boards informed tended to be more informal. Several of these interviewees mentioned discussing cyber security with senior managers in an ad hoc and reactive manner, i.e. only when specific issues arose. One small social care business suggested their board would only need to hear about cyber security after a serious incident, or if a breach needed to be reported externally, in order to get board approval. Another mid-sized marketing business discussed growing very rapidly from a small boutique agency, meaning that they still had no regular board meetings in place – they would just make themselves available to the security lead as-and-when needed.\n\nOften, in these cases, it was clear that boards were placing a great deal of trust either in their internal IT leads, or in their external IT providers – they assumed that these individuals would flag any serious issues with them. There was a sense among some of the small businesses interviewed that the problem of cyber security had been passed onto external contractors, resulting in senior managers disengaging from the topic and understanding the actions being taken, both internally and externally.\n\nWhere boards were engaging with cyber security, we often found this to be led by a single person on the board, as opposed to a more collaborative effort across board members. The nature of this individual’s engagement depended on their wider job role. In organisations where this individual was in a finance role, it often led to cyber security being seen through a financial lens, as a cost centre. Those taking day-to-day responsibility for cyber security, like an IT manager, had to report directly to finance leads for budget requests. In these instances, there was a greater emphasis on having to produce written business cases to justify new spending. This was felt to be a challenging task, as the evidence produced needed to be persuasive. One technology officer who had to write these kinds of business cases talked about the best evidence as referring to the amounts that might be saved or the potential reputational hit. They also talked about their cyber security audits being largely finance driven:\n\nIn other organisations, there was sometimes someone on the board who had a specific interest or background in IT. These individuals could act as interpreters for other board members, but were sometimes entrusted to take sole charge of IT and cyber issues, with the rest of the board disengaging. Nevertheless, in these organisations, there was often a more flexible approach to cyber security spending. In the case of this manufacturing business, for example, there was a direct relationship between the Managing Director and the IT manager, which meant the business case was sometimes easier to argue:\n\n2.3 Sources of information\n\nOverall proportion seeking cyber security information or guidance\n\nExternal sources of information and guidance on cyber security include government sources, third-party cyber security or IT providers, trade bodies, as well as information found through an internet search or from the media. Approximately half of businesses (49%) and just under half of charities (44%) report actively seeking information or guidance on cyber security from outside their organisation in the past year.\n\nThese results mirror the previous iterations of the study in 2022 and 2021. For businesses overall, this result is lower than its peak in in 2018 and 2019 (59%), which was seen in the lead up to, and aftermath of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implementation. For charities, it has remained around this level since 2018 (when 36% of charities had sought external information or guidance).\n\nAs Figure 2.6 illustrates, external information is less often sought in micro businesses. This is the same pattern in charities – only a third of charities with incomes under £100,000 (34%, vs. 44% overall) have sought external information.\n\nThe sectors where businesses are most likely to seek out external information are finance and insurance (79%), and the professional, scientific, and technical sector (58%). Both sectors have stood out in this respect in previous years.\n\nFigure 2.6: Proportion of organisations that have sought external information or guidance in the last 12 months on the cyber security threats faced by their organisation\n\nBusinesses overall 49% Micro businesses 46% Small businesses 57% Medium businesses 72% Large businesses 63% Within finance and insurance 79% Within professional, scientific and technical 58% Charities overall 44%\n\nBases: 1,152 UK businesses; 686 micro businesses; 211 small businesses; 141 medium businesses; 114 large businesses; 93 finance and insurance businesses; 142 professional, scientific and technical businesses; 570 charities\n\nUnder one in ten businesses (8%) and a similar proportion of charities (12%) seek information internally within their organisations. Among both groups, this result is higher than last year (when it was just 3% of businesses and 7% of charities doing so).\n\nAs might be expected, internal information seeking is higher within large businesses (38%), which are more likely to employ cyber security specialists. This is higher than in both medium businesses (15%) and high-income charities (22%).\n\nWhere do organisations get information and guidance?\n\nAs in previous years, the most common individual sources of information and guidance are:\n\nexternal cyber security consultants, IT consultants or IT service providers (mentioned by 21% of businesses and 15% of charities)\n\nany government or public sector source, including government websites, regulators, and other public bodies (12% of both businesses and charities)\n\ngeneral online searching (8% of businesses and 6% of charities).\n\nTo note, this question is unprompted for those doing the survey by telephone (the vast majority), while those doing it online look at a prompted response list.\n\nThe wide range of individual sources mentioned, together with the relatively low proportions for each, highlights that there is still no commonly agreed information source when it comes to cyber security. For example, just 2% each of businesses and charities mention the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) by name, in line with the previous year. This rises to one in three large businesses (28%) and around half this proportion of high-income charities (15%).\n\nIn 2019, nine regional Cyber Resilience Centres (CRCs) were opened across England and Wales, specifically in order to help smaller organisations make their cyber operations safer. It is worth noting that these are most often mentioned as an information source by large businesses (7%) and very high-income charities (5% of those with £5 million or more in annual income). Beyond these larger organisations, specific mentions of the CRCs are negligible at present.\n\nThere are a small number of further differences by size, or between businesses and charities that should be noted, particularly around the use of external cyber security consultants, IT consultants or IT service providers:\n\nSeeking information and guidance from external consultants or providers is most common among medium businesses (46%) – higher than among large businesses (31%), and replicating a pattern from previous years. It reflects that these businesses may recognise the need for more cyber security expertise, but have to procure it externally, rather than employing experts internally like many large businesses.\n\nAmong micro businesses, the most common sources are also external consultants or providers (18%). The next most common response is business banks (5%).\n\nAmong charities, fewer than one in ten (6%) mention charity-specific sources such as their relevant Charity Commission.[footnote 6]\n\nAwareness of government guidance, initiatives, and communications\n\nThe question around information sources in the previous subsection tends to underrepresent actual awareness of government communications on cyber security, as it is asked unprompted for individuals doing the telephone survey. In these kinds of unprompted questions, individuals often do not recall specific things they have seen and heard. We therefore ask organisations, in a later set of prompted questions, whether they have heard of specific initiatives or communications campaigns before. These include:\n\nthe national Cyber Aware communications campaign, which offers tips and advice to protect individuals and organisations against cyber crime\n\nthe 10 Steps to Cyber Security guidance, which aims to summarise what organisations should do to protect themselves\n\nthe government-endorsed Cyber Essentials scheme, which enables organisations to be certified independently for having met a good-practice standard in cyber security.\n\nAs Figure 2.7 shows, Cyber Aware is the most commonly recognised of these. However, only a minority of businesses and charities have heard of any of these initiatives or campaigns.\n\nFigure 2.7: Percentage of organisations aware of the following government guidance, initiatives, or communication campaigns\n\nGovernment guidance, initiative, or communication campaign Businesses Charities Cyber Aware campaign 27% 30% 10 Steps to Cyber Security guidance 14% 19% Cyber Essentials scheme 14% 15%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nMedium and large businesses are substantially more aware of these guidance packages:\n\n50% of medium businesses and 59% of large businesses are aware of Cyber Essentials (vs. 14% of all businesses)\n\n46% of medium businesses and 54% of large businesses have heard of Cyber Aware (vs. 27% overall)\n\n32% of medium businesses and 44% of large businesses are aware of the 10 Steps guidance (vs. 14% overall).\n\nAs in previous years, there is little difference between UK nations and regions when it comes to awareness of these different schemes or campaigns.\n\nTrends over time\n\nFigure 2.8 illustrates that business awareness of these schemes and initiatives is close to the previous survey, although there is a pattern of declining awareness of Cyber Aware and the 10 Steps guidance over the last two years. Fewer charities also report having heard of Cyber Aware compared to the previous year (38% in 2022). More have heard of Cyber Aware than the other schemes, but still only a minority of businesses and charities are aware of each one.\n\nFigure 2.8: Percentage of businesses over time aware of the following government guidance, initiatives, or communication campaigns\n\nThis chart suggests an ongoing, untapped potential for organisations to make better use of the information and guidance that is already available to them. For example, Cyber Aware campaign materials might be used as a reference for employees, to raise their general awareness on cyber security. Increasing awareness of Cyber Essentials may help to combat the idea, raised in previous years of this study, that some organisations do not know what good minimum standards look like when it comes to cyber security.\n\nGuidance targeted at specific types of organisations\n\nSince 2020, the survey has asked about NCSC guidance that is directed to specific sizes of business or towards charities. This includes:\n\nthe NCSC’s Small Business Guide and Small Charity Guide, which outline more basic steps that these smaller organisations can take to protect themselves\n\nthe NCSC’s Board Toolkit, which helps management boards to understand their obligations, and to discuss cyber security with the technical experts in their organisation.\n\nFigure 2.9 shows that just under one in five micro and small businesses (15%) have heard of the Small Business Guide, broadly unchanged from the previous three years. This is similar between micro businesses (15%) and small businesses (17%), which was also the pattern in previous years.\n\nAround one in five charities (18%) have heard of the Small Charities Guide. This result for charities overall has been relatively consistent across years. However, as Figure 2.9 shows, the result for high-income charities specifically has gone up since 2021, now standing at over a third of these charities (36%).\n\nFigure 2.9: Percentage of businesses and charities over time aware of the Small Business Guide and Small Charity Guide\n\nThe Board Toolkit was specifically explored with medium and large businesses in the survey, as well as charities of all sizes. Among all groups of larger organisations, as Figure 2.10 shows, awareness of the toolkit has been on the rise, particularly amongst large businesses, since it was first published in 2020. However, the majority of medium and large businesses and high-income charities remain unaware of it.\n\nTo note, charities were only asked this question from the 2021 study onwards.\n\nFigure 2.10: Percentage of medium and large businesses, and charities over time aware of the Board Toolkit\n\nBroadly, these findings suggest that larger organisations are increasing their engagement with cyber security, and any stagnation (e.g. the decline in prioritisation discussed at the start of this chapter, or drops in awareness of the Cyber Aware campaign) is more localised among the smallest businesses.\n\nImpact of government information and guidance\n\nA total of 41% of businesses and 49% of charities recall seeing, when prompted, any of the government communications or guidance covered in the previous section, The survey asks a random subsample of these organisations about the changes they have made to their cyber security measures as a result of what they have seen. Over half of these businesses (54%) and around half of these charities (49%) report making any changes. To note, this question is unprompted in both the telephone and online surveys.\n\nThe figure for businesses making changes has increased since 2022 (when it was 44%), which itself was an increase from 2021 (37%). The result among charities remains higher than it was in 2021 (38%) and in line with the 2022 figure (also 49%). These changes appear to be across all size and income bands, i.e. they are not driven by larger organisations. It is worth noting that in our 2021 report, individuals in IT and cyber roles reported feeling constrained in taking action, because of the competing pressures on their time from having to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, while exposure to information may not have increased overall, organisations are now potentially more willing and able to act upon the guidance they see – given that many have stabilised their operations since the pandemic.\n\nLarge businesses are significantly more likely to have acted on seeing government initiatives or campaigns (67%, vs 54% of all businesses). Seven in ten high-income charities report having done so on seeing this guidance (71%, vs. 49% of charities overall).\n\nIn terms of the specific changes made, there are a wide variety of unprompted responses given. No single response appears especially frequently.\n\n25% of businesses and 22% of charities that recall seeing these government communications report making changes of a technical nature (e.g. to firewalls, malware protections, user access or monitoring).\n\n21% of businesses and 20% of charities have made resourcing and governance-related changes (e.g. increased spending, or updated policies or documentation).\n\n16% of businesses and 14% of charities say they have made changes to do with staffing (e.g. employing new cyber security staff), outsourcing or training.\n\nThe top unprompted individual response categories are:\n\nchanging or updating firewalls or system configurations (10% of businesses and 6% of charities)\n\nstaff training and communications (9% and 10%)\n\nchanging or updating antivirus or antimalware software (9% and 7%)\n\nupdating passwords, or adding multi-factor authentication (MFA, for 8% and 5%).\n\nChapter 3: Approaches to cyber security\n\nThis chapter looks at the various ways in which organisations are dealing with cyber security. This covers topics such as:\n\nrisk management (including supplier risks)\n\nreporting cyber risks\n\ncyber insurance\n\ntechnical controls\n\ntraining and awareness raising\n\nstaffing and outsourcing\n\ngovernance approaches and policies.\n\nWe then cover the extent to which organisations are meeting the requirements set out in government-endorsed Cyber Essentials scheme and the government’s 10 Steps to Cyber Security guidance.\n\n3.1 Identifying, managing, and minimising cyber risks\n\nActions taken to identify risks\n\nOrganisations can take a range of actions to identify cyber security risks, including monitoring, risk assessment, audits, and testing. They are not necessarily expected to be doing all these things – the appropriate level of action depends on their own risk profiles.\n\nFigure 3.1 shows the six actions covered by the survey. Deploying security monitoring tools and undertaking risk assessments continue to be the most common actions undertaken by both businesses and charities – although businesses are significantly more likely to be using monitoring tools than charities (30% vs. 19%).\n\nFigure 3.1: Percentage of organisations that have carried out the following activities to identify cyber security risks in the last 12 months\n\nActivities to identify cyber security risks in the last 12 months Businesses Charities Any of the listed activities 51% 40% Used specific tools designed for security monitoring 30% 19% Risk assessment covering cyber security risks 29% 27% Tested staff (e.g. with mock phishing exercises) 19% 16% Carried out a cyber security vulnerability audit 15% 14% Penetration testing 11% 9% Invested in threat intelligence 9% 7%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nEvery one of these actions continues to be more common in larger organisations. Eight in ten medium businesses (80%), nine in ten large businesses (88%) and eight in ten high-income charities (79%) have carried out at least one of the listed activities. As specific examples:\n\n53% of medium businesses and 72% of large businesses have used security monitoring tools\n\n51% and 63% respectively have undertaken cyber security-related risk assessments.\n\nAmong these subgroups, threat intelligence remains the least common activity. This is undertaken by around half (47%) of large businesses, while each other activity is carried out by between six and seven in ten large businesses.\n\nThose in the health, social care and social work sector are significantly more likely than the average business to have taken any of these actions (74% vs. 51%), as are finance and insurance businesses (71%), and information and communications businesses (67%).\n\nHow organisations undertake audits and implement their findings\n\nAmong the 15% of businesses that undertake cyber security vulnerability audits, a third only undertake internal audits (36%), a similar proportion only have external audits (33%) and a quarter (25%) carry out both.\n\nHow businesses undertake audits continues to be strongly linked to size:\n\nmicro businesses are most likely to solely use internal staff to undertake audits (44% of the micro businesses undergoing any type of audit)\n\nsmall businesses have the greatest tendency (44%) to only use external contractors\n\nlarge businesses, likely having greater financial and personnel capacity, are most likely to state that audits have been undertaken both internally and externally (56%).\n\nA similar proportion of charities have carried out cyber security vulnerability audits (14%, similar to 15% of businesses). Among these charities, there is a broadly equal split between those conducted internally (29%), externally (32%) or both (29%).\n\nReviewing supplier risks\n\nSuppliers can pose various risks to an organisation’s cyber security, for example in terms of:\n\nthird-party access to an organisation’s systems\n\nsuppliers storing the personal data or intellectual property of a client organisation\n\nphishing attacks, viruses or other malware originating from suppliers.\n\nDespite this, relatively few businesses or charities are taking steps to formally review the risks posed by their immediate suppliers and wider supply chain. Just over one in ten businesses say they review the risks posed by their immediate suppliers (13%) and fewer are looking at their wider supply chain (8%). Among charities, the respective figures are broadly similar (11% look at their immediate suppliers and 6% at their wider supply chain).\n\nAs Figure 3.2 shows, the overall figures mask a wide variation by size. Possibly reflecting a more complex supply chain, a quarter of medium businesses (27%) and more than half of large businesses (55%) review the cyber security risks posed by their immediate suppliers. It is still relatively rare for these businesses to review their wider supply chain (15% and 34% respectively do so). However, as the next section discusses, this has been improving.\n\nAmong charities, two-fifths (41%, vs. 11% overall) of those with incomes of £5 million or more, and a quarter (26%) of those with incomes of £500,000 or more, have reviewed immediate supplier risks. Among both subgroups, only 15% have reviewed their wider supply chains.\n\nReflecting a generally more sophisticated approach to cyber security overall, businesses in the finance and insurance (26%), and information and communications (21%) sectors are more likely than average (13%) to monitor the risks posed by their immediate suppliers. However, there are no significant sectoral differences when it comes to reviewing wider supply chains.\n\nFigure 3.2: Percentage of organisations that have carried out work to formally review the potential cyber security risks presented by the following groups of suppliers\n\nOrganisation type Their immediate suppliers Their wider supply chain Businesses overall 13% 8% Micro businesses 12% 7% Small businesses 18% 10% Medium businesses 27% 15% Large businesses 55% 34% Within finance and insurance 26% 15% Within information and communications 21% 9% Charities overall 11% 6%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,387 micro businesses; 400 small businesses; 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 178 finance or insurance businesses; 161 information and communications businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nTrends over time\n\nThis question has been asked since the 2020 study (the last pre-pandemic study). As Figure 3.3 shows, among large businesses specifically, the proportions saying they review both their immediate supplier and their wider supply chain risks are at their highest ever this year, having recovered from a drop-off during the pandemic.\n\nFigure 3.3: Percentage of large businesses over time that have carried out work to formally review the potential cyber security risks presented by the following groups of suppliers\n\nBarriers to addressing supplier risks\n\nThe organisations that review supplier risks (immediate or otherwise) still face challenges when attempting to do this. The predominant challenges identified, among those carrying out any review, have remained relatively consistent over time. They continue to experience a lack of time and money and not being able to elicit information from suppliers. Lack of time and money is a more substantial issue among charities than businesses (46% vs. 32%).\n\nFigure 3.4 shows that a wider range of barriers are also impacting organisations, including barriers around knowledge, skills and prioritisation. The ordering of these issues is in line with the two previous years this question has been asked.\n\nOverall, around three in ten businesses (29%) say none of the six factors in the chart have prevented them from understanding potential cyber security risks within their supply chain. This compares to 32% in 2022 and 36% in 2021. In other words, organisations are more frequently raising one or more of barriers in Figure 3.4 as an issue for them now than before. This suggests that businesses are on-the-whole starting to find supply chain cyber risk management more challenging than before (among those attempting to do it in any form).\n\nFigure 3.4: Barriers to businesses undertaking formal review of supplier or supply chain risks\n\nBarriers to undertaking formal review of supplier or supply chain risks Businesses Charities Lack of time of money for this 32% 46% Can’t get information from suppliers to carry out checks 31% 20% Not knowing what checks to carry out 25% 21% Not a priority when working with suppliers 25% 18% Lack of skills to be able to check suppliers in this way 18% 25% Not knowing which suppliers to check 13% 14%\n\nBases: 472 UK businesses that have formally reviewed supply chain risks; 233 charities\n\nQualitative insights on broad supply chain risks\n\nThe qualitative interviews suggest that cyber security in supply chains is still an issue where organisations lack awareness. Consideration of these kinds of risks was rare – some interviewees flagged that the interview was the first time they had thought about it. Nonetheless, several of the larger organisations we spoke to felt that there had been a general increase in awareness of the issue compared to previous years – matching the increasing action taken by larger organisations over the years (as charted in Figure 3.3).\n\nWith that said, there seemed to be a more specific focus on supply chain risks from IT and technology providers, with other physical suppliers sometimes overlooked. For instance, one large organisation mentioned that they did risk assessments for all IT suppliers, but would not necessarily do this for other suppliers. In the view of the Assistant IT Director, this potentially put them at risk if, for example, a department bought a smart device (i.e. connected to the internet) from a foreign equipment supplier that was not treated as IT procurement. Another Information Security Manager in a large business reported that the business had very formal processes in place for IT and software suppliers, including regular lines of communication, but felt that they were more “hit and miss” with non-IT suppliers.\n\nThe interviews did highlight various triggers that led organisations to consider the issue:\n\ncontractual requirements or procurement rules that referred to suppliers\n\ninformation and guidance from sources such as the NCSC\n\norganisations hearing about attacks on their supply chains through their customers\n\ninternal or external cyber security audits raising the issue.\n\nAt the more sophisticated end, organisations dealt with supplier risks in a variety of ways. We came across examples of contractual arrangements, supplier questionnaires, requirements that suppliers agree to external accreditations (e.g. ISO 27001), regular meetings with key suppliers, adding supplier risks to risk registers, and logging of data flows with suppliers on data protection registers. At the other end of the scale, there were a small number of examples of much more informal supply chain cyber risk management, including emailing suppliers ad hoc to ask what they have in place. One Managing Director of a micro digital marketing business said they would discuss things like passwords with suppliers verbally and would manage each supplier’s access to their systems on a project-by-project basis.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring of suppliers, post-procurement, was felt to be much more challenging to manage. This was often put down to time pressure and being crowded out by other business priorities. Many organisations felt they simply had to trust suppliers to follow contracts, and that it was difficult to extract further information if suppliers or partners were not forthcoming. There was a suspicion that suppliers or partners would want to keep cyber incidents to themselves. These discussions strongly reflected the top two challenges around supply chain cyber risk management mentioned in the survey (covered in Figure 3.4).\n\nQualitative insights on Digital Service Providers (DSPs)\n\nThis year’s qualitative strand also looked at perceptions of the risks posed by Digital Service Providers (DSPs). Relatively few interviewees were able to discuss this topic at all, with several suggesting it did not apply to them (which may indicate a lack of awareness around the topic). This was despite a definition for DSPs being provided, i.e. a supplier that manages a suite of IT services like an organisation’s network, cloud computing and applications.\n\nAmong the interviewees that did discuss the topic, this covered a wide range of DSPs, including general IT service providers (including hardware and software maintenance), cloud storage providers, network monitoring, threat identification, and training providers. Smaller organisations seemed especially reliant on DSPs, due to their lack of in-house expertise and capacity.\n\nAmong those that did talk about DSPs, cyber security was not commonly raised as a consideration when choosing a DSP. Instead, the focus was on things like track record and cost. One micro business said they had simply used the DSP that came as part of a free deal with the hardware they had purchased.\n\nOne large manufacturer mentioned that they had included a question in their tendering process for one DSP about their vetting of staff, but they also had a sense that suppliers might opt not to be truthful and reveal any issues around this for fear of losing contracts. Another interviewee agreed that, while they could enquire about any risks with DSPs, they would ultimately still proceed with procurement if they could not influence these risks.\n\nThere was an assumption that the DSP would be responsible for cyber security and would, at a minimum, be keeping back-ups in case of any data loss or disruption. As such, there was a great deal of trust placed in the DSPs that organisations had chosen, especially if they were household name companies like Microsoft or Google. There was an acknowledgement that DSPs took on a high level of responsibility.\n\nIn two of our interviews with large organisations, there were concerns that they might be at greater risk of state-sponsored attacks if their DSPs also serviced at-risk organisations, such as government departments and defence organisations. However, neither organisation was currently taking formal steps to address these concerns.\n\nCorporate reporting of cyber security risks\n\nVery few organisations at present tend to cover their cyber security risks in annual reports. Around a quarter of medium or large businesses (27%) – this question was only asked of larger businesses – published an annual report in the past 12 months.\n\nAmong these medium and large businesses, around a fifth (21%) covered their cyber security risks within it, which is broadly in line with last year (19%), when this question was first asked. Large businesses more commonly do so in 2023 (33% include cyber security risks, vs. 16% of medium businesses), which is also similar to last year.\n\nThis question is asked of all charities (not just high-income ones). Two-thirds of charities (64%) say they have published annual reports within the last 12 months, reflecting that it is a statutory obligation for them to do so. To note, where charities say they have not done so, it may simply be a lack of awareness on the part of the interviewee (e.g. if they are in a more technical roles). Among the charities that are aware of putting out an annual report, around one in eleven (9%) have covered cyber security risks in this report, i.e. a lower proportion versus businesses. This compares to 4% last year (a statistically significant change).\n\nWhile the year-on-year change are based on relatively small groups, they indicate that public reporting of cyber risks, while still relatively rare, is potentially on the rise.\n\nCorporate reporting was briefly discussed in the qualitative interviews as well. This highlighted that one of the main drivers of reporting was to reassure stakeholders and investors that the organisation took cyber security seriously. However, there was a sense across interviews that this kind of reporting should be intentionally vague and light on detail, so as not to give away any vulnerabilities to potential attackers, or provide intelligence to competitors. This meant that coverage of cyber security breaches was not typically included.\n\n3.2 Cyber security strategies\n\nAs Figure 3.5 shows, around half (52%) of medium and large businesses and just over a third of high-income charities (36%) have a formal cyber security strategy in place – that is, a document underpinning all policies and processes relating to cyber security.\n\nThis year, the question was only asked of these larger organisations, whereas last year it was asked of all businesses and charities, including smaller ones. Therefore, Figure 3.5 should not be directly compared to the equivalent figure from last year’s report. With that said, the large business result specifically is higher than last year (rising from 57% in 2022 to 68% this year). The result for medium businesses is on a par with last year (when it was 48%).\n\nFigure 3.5: Organisations that have a formal cyber security strategy\n\nMedium/large businesses (combined) 52% Medium businesses 49% Large businesses 68% High-income charities 36%\n\nBases: 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 358 high-income charities\n\nAmong the larger organisations that do have a cyber security strategy in place, around eight in ten of these business (80%) and charities (76%) report that this has been reviewed by senior executives or trustees within the last 12 months.\n\nQualitative insights on why and how organisations implement cyber security strategies\n\nThe qualitative research revealed the kinds of factors that led organisations to set up formal cyber security strategies, including:\n\npressure from management boards\n\nrecommendations from auditors following an audit\n\nperceived reputational risk\n\nbusiness acquisition – in one large manufacturing business, a company merger had led them to substantially reconsider their cyber security approach in the past year, since there was a need to reconcile the different set-ups in the previous companies\n\nresponses to GDPR.\n\nOn the final point above, it is worth noting that cyber security continued to be intertwined with GDPR compliance, in terms of policies, rules around storing data and staff training. In one case, this meant that both the IT and human resources team were involved in developing cyber security policies. One charity mentioned data breaches on their risk register, but in the context of GDPR rather than cyber risk. In another charity, the mandatory cyber security training for staff was heavily focused on GDPR.\n\nOne of the common behaviours among organisations that developed a formal strategy was to have cyber security break away from another department like IT or, in one case, facilities. This signalled a greater strategic prioritisation of cyber security and, in some instances, meant that it secured its own budget, separate from the broader IT budget. This was important to ensure continued spending on cyber security, given that this spending was not necessarily protected when it was simply part of the overall IT budget.\n\nInterviewees also discussed various barriers to adopting and implementing formal cyber security strategies, including:\n\na lack of expertise in-house or within their business network to support them in developing a robust strategy – such as where to start, what to include, and how to monitor progress\n\na lack of buy-in from the workforce – one charity noted that, with its high turnover of staff and volunteers, it was difficult to ensure staff knew what to do and who to contact in case of a cyber incident\n\na perception that cyber incidents were too varied, or alternatively that some types of incidents were too unlikely, to warrant a uniform strategy.\n\n3.3 Insurance against cyber security breaches\n\nWhich organisations are insured?\n\nJust under four in ten businesses (37%) and a third of charities (33%) report being insured against cyber security risks in some way. In most cases, as Figure 3.6 shows, cyber security insurance is an addition to a wider insurance policy – only 7% of businesses and 8% of charities have a specific cyber security insurance policy. Larger businesses are more likely to have a specific policy (26%), as are high-income charities (22%).\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, medium businesses are the most likely size band to have any form of cyber insurance (63%, vs. 55% of large businesses and 36% of micro or small businesses). This may reflect the idea that medium businesses tend to have more resources than smaller businesses to be able to afford insurance, while possibly not having the skills or tools to be able to address all cyber security risks internally like larger businesses.\n\nIt is worth noting the high level of uncertainty that remains at this question. One-fifth of business (20%) and charities (18%) do not know if their employer has any form of cyber security insurance, despite the survey being carried out with the individual identified by the organisation as having most responsibility for cyber security.\n\nFigure 3.6: Percentage of organisations that have the following types of insurance against cyber security risks\n\nOrganisation type Cyber security cover as part of a wider insurance policy A specific cyber security insurance policy Businesses overall 30% 7% Micro businesses 29% 6% Small businesses 33% 11% Medium businesses 40% 22% Large businesses 29% 26% Charities overall 25% 8%\n\nBases: 1,111 UK businesses; 701 micro businesses; 189 small businesses; 136 medium businesses; 85 large businesses; 604 charities\n\nAs might be expected, insurance cover is more prevalent in the finance and insurance sector itself. Half of finance and insurance businesses have some sort of coverage against cyber security breaches (48%, vs. 37% overall). A similar proportion of professional, scientific and technical businesses (52%) also report having cyber insurance.\n\nTrends over time\n\nCompared to the 2022 survey, the proportions with some form of insurance have moved in opposite directions for businesses (dropping from 43% to 37%) and charities (increasing from 27% to 33%) this year. For businesses, the drop is driven by fewer micro businesses (down from 38% to 29%) and small businesses (down from 40% to 33%) including cyber security cover as part of a wider insurance policy. It may reflect that these smaller businesses are attempting to cut their costs in light of the more challenging business environment this year, reflected in our qualitative findings (see Section 2.1).\n\n3.4 Technical cyber security controls\n\nEach year, we ask whether organisations have a range of technical rules and controls in place to help minimise the risk of cyber security breaches. The full list is shown in Figure 3.7. Many of these are basic good practice controls taken from government guidance such as the 10 Steps to Cyber Security or the requirements of Cyber Essentials. Towards the end of this chapter, we map survey responses to these schemes to estimate how many organisations are operating in line with the guidance.\n\nA clear majority of businesses and charities have a broad range of basic rules and controls in place. The most frequently deployed rules or controls involve cloud back-ups, updated malware protection, passwords, network firewalls and restricted admin rights – each administered by two-thirds or more of businesses. The least common rules and controls are around two-factor authentication (2FA), user monitoring, separated Wi-Fi networks, applying software updates and use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nThe following are more common in businesses than in charities – these are statistically significant differences (with exact percentages included in Figure 3.7):\n\ndata back-ups, both cloud-based and non-cloud\n\nupdated malware protection\n\npassword policies\n\nnetwork firewalls\n\nsecurity controls on the organisation’s devices, or only allowing access via these devices (as opposed to personal devices) – this likely reflects the greater tendency for charity staff and volunteers to be using personal devices due to lower spending on equipment\n\nagreed processes for phishing emails\n\npolicies to apply security updates within 14 days (i.e. patch management).\n\nFigure 3.7: Percentage of organisations that have the following rules or controls in place\n\nRule or control in place Businesses Charities Up-to-date malware protection 76% 63% A password policy that ensures that users set strong passwords 70% 55% Backing up data securely via a cloud service 70% 50% Restricting IT admin and access rights to specific users 67% 64% Firewalls that cover the entire IT network, as well as individual devices 66% 50% Security controls on organisation-owned devices (e.g. laptops) 59% 42% Only allowing access via organisation-owned devices 55% 33% An agreed process for staff to follow with fraudulent emails or websites 48% 37% Rules for storing and moving personal data securely 45% 43% Backing up data securely via other means 45% 39% Any Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for networks/applications 37% 27% Separate Wi-Fi networks for staff and visitors 34% 26% Monitoring of user activity 32% 27% A virtual private network, or VPN, for staff connecting remotely 31% 22% A policy to apply software security updates within 14 days 31% 22%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses, 1,174 charities\n\nMedium and large businesses are more likely than average to have each of these technical rules and controls in place. Specifically across large businesses, around nine in ten have adopted each of the following:\n\ndata backups, either via the cloud or other means (96%)\n\nrestricting admin rights (95%)\n\npassword policies (93%)\n\nsecurity controls on their devices (92%)\n\nup-to-date malware protection (91%)\n\nnetwork firewalls (91%)\n\nVPNs (90%)\n\nseparate Wi-Fi for staff and visitors (89%).\n\nThe two areas where a more substantial number of large businesses do not have technical rules and controls are in patch management (66%) and restricting access to organisation-owned devices (69%).\n\nAs in previous years, businesses in three sectors are less likely than others to have a range of these rules or controls in place. We have used software security update policies (i.e. patch management) as an example here, but businesses in these sectors fall short on several of the areas mentioned in Figure 3.7:\n\nfood and hospitality (23% have patch management, vs. 31% of all businesses)\n\nentertainment, services, and membership organisations (also 23%)\n\nconstruction (26%).\n\nTrends over time\n\nCompared to 2022, the deployment of the various controls and procedures has fallen among businesses:\n\nusing up-to-date malware protection (down from 83% to 76% among businesses)\n\npassword policies (down from 75% to 70%)\n\nrestricting admin rights (down from 72% to 67%)\n\nnetwork firewalls (down from 74% to 66%)\n\nagreed processes for phishing emails (down from 57% to 48%)\n\npatch management policies (down from 39% to 31%).\n\nMoreover, across the last three waves of the study (which have all taken place after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), some of these areas have seen consistent declines among businesses. This includes:\n\npassword policies (79% in 2021, vs. 70% in 2023)\n\nnetwork firewalls (78% in 2021 vs. 66% in 2023)\n\nrestricted admin rights (75% in 2021, vs. 67% in 2023)\n\npatch management policies (43% in 2021, vs. 31% in 2023)\n\nIt is important to note that these trends mainly reflect shifts in micro businesses and, to a lesser extent, small and medium businesses over time. On each of the technical controls in Figure 3.7, large businesses remain in line with where they were in 2022.\n\nGiven that micro businesses account for 82%[footnote 7] of the total business population, all the above changes over time are statistically significant for the micro business subgroup. As an example, among micro businesses, the use of up-to-date malware protection has fallen from 81% in 2021 to 74% in 2023.\n\nFor small businesses specifically, restricted admin rights are less common than in 2022 (down from 87%, to 79% this year).\n\nFor medium businesses, there have been drops since 2022 in the proportion saying they have security controls on their devices (from 91% to 79%) and agreed processes for phishing emails (from 86% to 78%).\n\nTaken together, these findings highlight an increasing cyber hygiene challenge among small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in the post-pandemic era.\n\nThe long-term trend also reflects shifts in ways of working since the pandemic. The proportion of businesses restricting access to business-owned devices has fallen successively over the last four years (from 69% in the 2020, pre-pandemic, study, to 55% this year).\n\nThere are relatively few consistent trends from 2022 to 2023 by sector. However, it is worth noting that some of the largest shifts over the past year are among retail and wholesale businesses. For example, the proportion of these businesses saying they have patch management policies has dropped from 41% in 2022 to 29% in this year.\n\nFinally, the following areas have also seen a decline among charities since 2022, mirroring the changes in the business population:\n\nusing up-to-date malware protection (down from 68% to 63% among charities)\n\nnetwork firewalls (down from 56% to 50%).\n\n3.5 Staff training and awareness raising\n\nThis survey does not explore cyber security skills and training in detail, given that there is another annual government study dealing with this topic – the cyber security skills series. Nevertheless, staff training is an important aspect of the 10 Steps to Cyber Security guidance, so we continue to estimate the proportion of organisations that have undertaken training or awareness raising activities around cyber security in the past year.\n\nOur results (Figure 3.8) show that in the 12 months prior to the survey, just under two-fifths of businesses (18%) and charities (17%) overall have provided some form of staff training. Historically, this has been much higher in larger organisations. Half of all medium businesses (52%), three-quarters of large businesses (77%) and half (49%) of high-income charities provided this training. Among businesses, the finance and insurance sector stands out, being the sector where such training is most common.\n\nFigure 3.8: Percentage of organisations that have had training or awareness raising sessions on cyber security in the last 12 months\n\nBusinesses overall 18% Micro businesses 15% Small businesses 28% Medium businesses 52% Large businesses 77% Within finance and insurance 48% Within health, social care and social work 35% Charities overall 17%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,387 micro businesses; 400 small businesses; 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 178 finance and insurance businesses; 88 health, social care and social work businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nTrends over time\n\nThis question was first asked in the 2021 study, giving two years of trend data since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (with the 2020 study fieldwork taking place before the pandemic). In that time, the proportion of medium and large businesses running training has consistently increased. For example, it was 47% for large businesses in 2021, compared to 61% in 2022 and 77% now. The result for high-income charities has also risen (from 35% in 2021, to 45% in 2022 and 49% now).\n\nThe aforementioned cyber security skills study from 2021 (also the first post-pandemic survey in that series) highlighted the pressure that COVID-19 restrictions placed on cyber security training, providing a rationale for the uplift we have seen since then, as restrictions have been lifted. Looking at the results for medium and large businesses in that study across the same years, there has also been a similar trend (although the sample sizes in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey are larger, and allow for more analysis of medium and large businesses).\n\nQualitative insights on successful staff training approaches and barriers to training\n\nA key theme that emerged from the qualitative interviews was the importance of good communication channels between staff and IT, and two-way feedback loops. For example, one finance business encouraged staff to report suspicious emails to IT, who then reviewed them and shared the outcomes. If the email was not genuine, the IT team would email all staff to highlight the kinds of tell-tale signs to look out for in future emails and would also alert the wider staff. In this way, this business had built a trusting relationship between IT and wider staff.\n\nDeveloping these close working relationships, raising the profile of IT staff and building a shared understanding of the need for cyber security, as well as the burdens associated with it, were all considered important. For instance, we spoke to organisations running mock phishing exercises and penetration testing. This was not only done to keep staff vigilant, but also to keep the frontline IT team visible, so that staff knew who to contact in case of an issue.\n\nA second theme was around staff being able to imagine the real-world impact of a cyber incident. One business described a successful, attention-grabbing approach by an external training provider – they produced a mock-up of a newspaper article saying that the business had been breached. This helped to reinforce the potential reputational risk.\n\nHowever, organisations continued to face challenges in promoting a cyber resilient culture among staff. Many of the challenges that emerged during the pandemic, when it became less easy to monitor and control staff behaviour (discussed in previous years of this study) had persisted now that hybrid working was often the norm. Those responsible for cyber security raised, for example, the risks around staff using external drives on work devices outside the office, where the behaviour might remain undetected.\n\nOrganisations sometimes wanted to deliver more frequent or interactive training, but were held back by a lack of capacity. For example, one large manufacturing business provided mandatory training to new joiners to teach them about phishing, cyber hygiene and data protection, but the IT team lacked the time to provide refresher training.\n\nAnother common issue was organisations being unsure how to evaluate training. This made it difficult to demonstrate value for money and, as a result, to get senior management to approve further training. One business described providing staff with introductory and refresher training online that could be accessed whenever staff wanted, but they were unsure how to measure its effectiveness and the impact on staff, beyond crudely counting how many had accessed the different courses.\n\n3.6 Responsibility for cyber security\n\nThe job titles of those completing the survey, who are identified by their organisation as being the individual most responsible for cyber security, provide an insight as to the likely seniority and influence of these individuals.\n\nThese results do not necessarily show the definitive proportion of organisations that have, for example, a Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). In organisations with these functions, we may have been directed to another senior individual with more day-to-day responsibility for cyber security, such as a senior IT colleague.\n\nGenerally, the larger the organisation, the more specific the job title of the individual covering cyber security matters. The findings outlined here are all in line with the previous study, when this was first asked:\n\nIn micro businesses, it is most likely to be a Chief Executive (35%), business owner (11%), or another senior management role (13%). Fewer than one in ten micro businesses have someone specifically in an IT-role looking after cyber security matters (4%).\n\nIn small businesses, the most common job roles were Chief Executives (18%), general office managers (17%) or those with another (unspecified) senior management role (14%).\n\nIn a third of large businesses, it is either the IT director (12%) or an IT manager, technician or administrator (20%), looking after cyber security. The respective figures for medium sized businesses are 9 and 12%.\n\nIn three in ten charities (30%), a trustee performs this function. Within the very largest charities (with an income of £5 million or more), 15% of interviews were completed by an IT Director, similar to the proportion among large businesses.\n\n3.7 Outsourcing of cyber security functions\n\nJust under four in ten businesses (36%) and a quarter of charities (26%) have an external cyber security provider. These overall figures are broadly consistent with those recorded in the previous three surveys, although the specific finding for large businesses has changed (from 60% in 2022 to 37% this year).\n\nAs Figure 3.9 shows, outsourcing of cyber security is substantially higher among small and medium businesses, as opposed to micro and large businesses. This pattern has been evidenced in previous years as well (although in 2022 and 2021 it was equally high in medium and large businesses). It is possible that large businesses are relying more this year on internal cyber security expertise than on outsourcing, while small and medium businesses perhaps cannot afford to recruit specialists to the same extent.\n\nHigh-income charities, on the other hand, tend to be more aligned with medium businesses. Six in ten of these charities (63%, vs. 26% overall) say they outsource aspects of cyber security.\n\nFigure 3.9: Percentage of organisations that have an external cyber security provider\n\nBusinesses overall 36% Micro businesses 32% Small businesses 50% Medium businesses 58% Large businesses 37% Within finance and insurance 62% Within utilities or production 46% Within professional, scientific and technical 43% Charities overall 26%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,387 micro businesses; 400 small businesses; 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 178 finance and insurance businesses; 206 utilities or production businesses; 285 professional, scientific and technical businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nPossibly because they are more likely to have cyber specialists internally, fewer than a quarter (22%) of information and communications businesses use external cyber security providers. By contrast, among finance and insurance businesses, the figure is six in ten (62%, vs. 36% on average).\n\n3.8 Cyber security policies and other documentation\n\nDo organisations formally document their approaches?\n\nAround three in ten businesses (29%) and a third of charities (35%) report having formal cyber security policies in place. To note, these may be part of a wider policy within the organisation, such as the IT policy. Smaller proportions (27% of businesses and 22% of charities) have a business continuity plan that covers cyber security.\n\nFigure 3.10 shows strong differences by size, with the majority of medium and large businesses having each form of documentation.\n\nWhile the charity results are similar to previous years, the business results suggest a reduction in cyber security documentation since 2022 (when 36% had policies and 34% had cyber security included in business continuity plans). As with the drop in prioritisation covered in Chapter 2, this is primarily focused among micro businesses.\n\nFigure 3.10: Percentage of organisations that have the following kinds of documentation\n\nOrganisation type A formal policy or policies covering cyber security risks A business continuity plan that covers cyber security Businesses overall 29% 27% Micro businesses 24% 23% Small businesses 46% 41% Medium businesses 63% 61% Large businesses 79% 79% Charities overall 35% 22%\n\nBases: 2,263 UK businesses; 1,387 micro businesses; 400 small businesses; 277 medium businesses; 199 large businesses; 1,174 charities\n\nDocumentation continues to be more prevalent in three sectors:\n\nfinance and insurance (63% have cyber risks in business continuity plans, vs. 27% overall, and 55% have cyber policies, vs. 29% overall)\n\nhealth, social care and social work (46% with appropriate continuity plans and 57% with appropriate policies)\n\ninformation and communications (39% with appropriate continuity plans and the same proportion with appropriate policies).\n\nWhen were policies last reviewed?\n\nOf the 29% of businesses and 35% of charities that have cyber security policies in place, over four in ten (45%) of those businesses and a third (34%) of those charities reviewed these policies within the last six months (Figure 3.11). For businesses, the figure is similar to the last two years, but still below the 2020 survey (the last pre-pandemic survey), when 52% said they had reviewed policies or documentation in the past six months.\n\nBusinesses are more likely than charities to have reviewed their policies within the last 12 months (82% of businesses, vs. 64% of charities).\n\nFigure 3.11: When organisations last created, updated, or reviewed their cyber security policies or documentation\n\nOrganisation type % in the last 3 months % 3 to under 6 months ago % 6 to under 12 months ago % 12 to under 24 months ago % 24 months ago or earlier % don’t know Businesses overall 25 20 36 9 3 6 Charities overall 19 15 30 15 10 12\n\nBases: 891 businesses with cyber security policies; 551 charities\n\nWhat is covered in cyber security policies?\n\nAs Figure 3.12 indicates, cyber security policies tend to cover off a range of topics. The aspects most often covered are around data storage and the appropriate use of the organisation’s IT devices. The use of personal devices and of Software as a Service (SaaS) is far less commonly mentioned. This is despite the increasing trend to drop rules insisting on employees only using organisation-owned devices (as noted in Section 3.4).\n\nBusinesses are significantly more likely than charities to cover the use of cloud computing in their cyber security policies (63% vs. 54%).\n\nFigure 3.12: Percentage of organisations with cyber security policies that have the following features in their cyber security policies\n\nFeatures in cyber security policies Businesses Charities How data is supposed to be stored 77% 72% What staff are permitted to do on organisation’s IT devices 74% 64% Remote or mobile working 64% 59% Use of cloud computing 63% 54% Use of network-connected devices 58% 54% What can be stored on removed devices (e.g. USB sticks) 58% 53% Use of personally-owned devices for business activities 50% 53% Use of Software as a Service 38% 37%\n\nBases: 891 businesses with cyber security policies; 551 charities\n\nIn 2022, the proportion of businesses that covered cloud computing in their cyber security policies fell to 56% after a multi-year upwards trend (52% in 2016, 60% in 2020, and 64% in 2021). The figure for 2023 is once more in line with the upwards trend (at 63%).\n\nIt is also worth noting that the proportion of both businesses and charities saying that their cyber policies cover remote or mobile working has not increased since the COVID-19 pandemic (which led to the normalisation of working from home or hybrid working across many organisations). In the 2020 survey (the last one conducted before the start of the pandemic), this was at 66% (vs. 64% now) for businesses and 68% (vs. 59% now) for charities. The charities result has varied across years, without a consistent upwards or downwards trend.\n\n3.9 Cyber accreditations and government initiatives\n\nThis section looks at both government and external cyber accreditations and initiatives.
