        "text": "What is psoriasis on the face?\n\nPsoriasis on the face, or facial psoriasis, is a condition that causes patches of thick, discolored and scaly skin on your forehead, around your eyes, on your cheeks or your chin. Facial psoriasis can also affect the skin around your mouth, on your eyebrows and your nose. These rash-like patches are called plaques. Psoriasis is a chronic condition, which means symptoms can come and go unexpectedly and there’s no cure.\n\nWhat are the different types of psoriasis that affect the face?\n\nThere are several different types of psoriasis. Some types of psoriasis cause symptoms that affect the skin on your face, including:\n\nPlaque psoriasis: Plaque psoriasis causes dry, discolored, scaly patches of skin.\n\nGuttate psoriasis: Guttate psoriasis causes small, dry, scaly spots on your skin after a streptococcal infection.\n\nPustular psoriasis: Pustular psoriasis causes small, pus-filled bumps on top of dry, scaly skin.\n\nSebopsoriasis: Sebopsoriasis is a cross between psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).\n\nScalp psoriasis: Scalp psoriasis causes swollen, discolored patches of dry, scaly skin on or around your scalp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWho does psoriasis on the face affect?\n\nPsoriasis on the face can affect anyone diagnosed with psoriasis.\n\nHow common is psoriasis on the face?\n\nPsoriasis affects millions of people. Over 3% of the United States’ population has a type of psoriasis. Most people who have psoriasis on the face also have psoriasis in another location on their body. About 50% of people diagnosed with psoriasis experience symptoms on their face at least once during their lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the difference between facial psoriasis, rosacea and eczema?\n\nPsoriasis, rosacea and eczema are all skin conditions that can affect the skin on your face. The main difference between each condition is the symptoms they cause, including:\n\nPsoriasis: Scaly patches of skin.\n\nRosacea: Small, swollen red bumps and visible blood vessels.\n\nEczema: A dry, discolored and itchy rash.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of psoriasis on the face?\n\nSymptoms of psoriasis on the face range from mild to severe and cause plaques to form on the skin of your face. Plaques are patches of skin that are:\n\nDry.\n\nScaly or flaky.\n\nDiscolored, from pink to red, red to purple or brown to silver.\n\nThick.\n\nPsoriasis on your face usually begins at your hairline and extends down toward your chin. Symptoms can resemble dandruff if a plaque forms at your hairline and the scales shed. Psoriasis that forms near your mouth can affect your ability to eat and cause discomfort.\n\nYou might experience mild itchiness from psoriasis plaques on your skin. If you scratch your skin plaques, they could break open. This could lead to an open sore or an infection. Signs of an infection are fluid drainage (pus), swelling and a burning sensation or pain.\n\nWhat does psoriasis on the face look like on dark skin?\n\nPsoriasis doesn’t look the same on every skin tone. If you have a dark skin tone, psoriasis can look like:\n\nA raised, scaly patch of skin.\n\nPatch of skin that’s dark brown or red to purple.\n\nPatch has gray to silver scales.\n\nWhen the plaque on your face goes away, you may have skin discoloration that lasts for a few months to a year. A healthcare provider can offer treatment options to improve how your skin heals after a psoriasis outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the stages of psoriasis on the face?\n\nPsoriasis can start as a flat, scaly patch and progress to a scaly plaque.\n\nWhat causes psoriasis on the face?\n\nWhile the exact cause of facial psoriasis is unclear, research suggests that inflammation from an overactive immune system causes psoriasis on the face. Cells in your immune system protect your body from foreign invaders, like bacteria, that can make you sick. With psoriasis, your immune system instead attacks your body’s healthy skin cells. This attack causes your skin cells to create new cells faster than they should, which leads to symptoms of psoriasis.\n\nWhat triggers psoriasis on the face?\n\nPsoriasis on the face could start after interaction with a trigger, which is an irritant or allergen that causes an outbreak of symptoms. Triggers for facial psoriasis include:\n\nStress.\n\nAn infection.\n\nA reaction to a medication.\n\nAn injury to your skin.\n\nIs psoriasis on the face contagious?\n\nNo, psoriasis on the face isn’t contagious. You can’t spread the condition to other people through physical contact.\n\nHow do I get rid of psoriasis on the face?\n\nTreatment for psoriasis on the face could include:\n\nTopical corticosteroid creams.\n\nTopinarof cream.\n\nRoflumilast cream.\n\nCalcipotriene cream.\n\nImmunosuppressants.\n\nLight therapy.\n\nOver-the-counter creams and moisturizers designed for psoriasis that include ingredients like salicylic acid to prevent flaking.\n\nMethotrexate injections or cyclosporine injections and biologics for severe cases.\n\nIt can be challenging to treat facial psoriasis because the skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive than the skin on the rest of your body. The treatment you use to treat psoriasis on your arms and legs, for example, might not work effectively to treat psoriasis on your face.\n\nBefore beginning treatment, talk to your healthcare provider about the possible side effects and any medications or supplements you currently take to avoid drug interactions.\n\nHow soon after treatment will I feel better?\n\nIt could take a few weeks to a few months after you begin treatment for your skin to improve after a psoriasis outbreak. Medicated treatments from your healthcare provider can speed up your skin’s healing time. You may have temporary skin discoloration where you had a psoriasis plaque for a couple of months up to a year on your face.\n\nWhat can I expect if I have psoriasis on the face?\n\nPsoriasis is a lifelong condition. You may experience psoriasis outbreaks on your face in addition to outbreaks on other parts of your body at the same time.\n\nAs psoriasis on the face can affect your appearance, some people find comfort in talking with a mental health professional if their symptoms affect their emotional well-being.\n\nIt may take a few different treatment options before you find one that works best for your skin. Each person’s skin is unique, so what works for you might not work for someone else with similar symptoms.\n\nThere isn’t a cure for facial psoriasis, but treatment is available to help you manage your symptoms."
