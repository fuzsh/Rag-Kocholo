        "text": "Cortical connections of the face patches\n\nConnections of PL\n\nPL, the most posterior face patch, is located in the caudal portion of TEO, and has been found to contain a large number of cells selective for the presence of the contralateral eye (Issa and DiCarlo, 2012). We injected PL in two monkeys ( ): left PL in monkey D ( ) and left PL in monkey B (Figure S1).\n\nIn monkey D, we made an injection from the surface of the temporal lobe (see online Methods; trajectory of the injection pipette is shown in ), while in monkey B we used a vertical approach, accessing the face patch from the top of the skull (Figure S1A). Physiological activity was recorded immediately prior to each injection, and the electrode position was confirmed at the end of the recording session with MRI ( , S1B–C). Regularly-spaced recordings (100 µm) were performed in order to carefully map the entire extent of the face patch ( , S1D). The center of the face-selective track was chosen as target for the injection. Following recordings, the electrode was removed and a glass pipette filled with tracer for the superficial injection in monkey D (CTB-555) or a metal needle for the vertical injection in monkey B (Cascade Blue) was placed in the same location as the recording electrode (see online Methods). Post-mortem histology confirmed the location of injection sites in PL for both monkey D ( ) and monkey B (Figure S1F–H). In both monkeys, the injection was precisely centered in PL ( , S1H).\n\nIn order to localize the labeled cells relative to face patches, we co-registered the histology plottings and the MRI (see online Methods for a description of the registration procedure); we found that the majority of the labeled neurons within IT cortex were located inside the face patches (Table S1). To obtain an overall view of the location of labeled cells in the cortex relative to the face patches, we plotted both face patches ( ) and labeled cells ( ) on a cortical flat map. Comparison of the two patterns ( ) reveals connections to PL not only from ML (1284 cells, ) but also from the most anterior patch AM (407 cells, ). A small projection was found from contralateral TEO (outside of the face patches, Figure S10A–D). In monkey B projections to PL originated from ipsilateral AM (120 cells, not shown), AL (196 cells, Figure S1I–K), and ML (112 cells, Figure S1O–Q); there was also a small projection from the contralateral ML (44 cells, Figure S10E–H).\n\nIn monkey D, 836 cells (33% of all IT cells) were located in IT outside the boundaries of the face patches. The majority of these cells (687) were located in the ventral part of TEO, posterior to the injection site. These cells were organized in dense aggregates ( ). Anterior to the injection site, cells in IT and outside of the face patches were scattered ( ). In monkey B, 130 neurons in IT cortex were located outside the face patches (16% of total cells in IT). These scattered cells outside the face patches were distributed throughout IT cortex, both in the convexity and fundus of the STS. They were mainly found in TEO, close to the injection site; further from the injection site cells were sparser (Figure S1L–N). The scattered cells outside of the face patches are not visible on the flatmap ( and S1V–W) because of their low density.\n\nOne of the goals of our study was to identify the source of inputs to the face patch system. In monkey D, we found inputs to PL from earlier visual areas V4 (4796 cells, ), V3 (1602 cells, ) and V2 (318 cells, ), and TEO (687 cells), posterior to PL ( ). V4 cells were concentrated in the ventral part of V4, in and ventral to the ios ( ). In monkey B we only found a projection from V2 (372 cells; Figure S1R–T). However, a lesion was observed immediately posterior to the injection site, probably due to guide tube placing during recordings, and it is possible that projections from earlier visual areas other than V2 were present but not visible due to the lesion.\n\nConnections of ML\n\nML is the largest face patch in the macaque brain. It is located in the rostrocaudal part of TEO and caudal TEpd, and from surface-based interspecies registration, may be homologous to the human fusiform face area (Kanwisher et al., 1997; Tsao et al., 2003; Van Essen, 2004). We injected ML in two monkeys: monkey D (left ML, ) and monkey B (left ML, Figure S2; right ML, Figure S3).\n\nIn monkey D, the fast blue injection site was precisely centered in left ML ( ). Most of the projection neurons were found in IT cortex on the left (ipsilateral) hemisphere, and concentrated within the face patches ( ). Numerically, 395 cells were found in AM ( ), 116 in AF (not shown), 125 in PL ( ), and 135 cells (9.5% of the cells in left IT cortex) were located outside of the face patches, scattered in IT cortex ( ), with two small clusters of cells lying between AF and MF ( ). Some cells were also found in the contralateral right hemisphere, mainly concentrated in ML (83 cells, data not shown). In addition, a small projection was found from the ventral part of area V4 (V4v; 41 cells, ). Another small projection was found from ipsilateral orbitofrontal area 13m/l (26 cells, ; corresponds to Fig. 67 in (Saleem and Logothetis, 2012).\n\nIn monkey B, the CTB-555 injection site in left ML was very superficial (layers I/II and very superficial part of layer III; Figure S2F–H). Because the injection site was superficial, we only found a small number of projection neurons and these were mainly located in superficial layers of the cortex (layers I–III). Most of the projections were concentrated within the face patches, similar to the previous case. Projections to left ML were found in AM (78 cells, Figure S2I–K), AL (730 cells, Figure S2L–N), the accessory patch, AP (103 cells, Figure S2R–T) and PL (105 cells, Figure S2R’–T’). Interestingly, in the accessory patch we found a convergence of cells projecting to both left ML and left AL after CTB555 and FE injections, respectively in the same case (Figures S2R–T; S4). No projections were found from other cortical areas outside of IT, including posterior visual areas V2, V3, and V4. Within IT, we found 125 cells outside of the face patches (12% of the total cells in IT).\n\nIn monkey B, the CTB-488/LY injection was precisely targeted in the center of the right ML, and covered most of the cortical layers (Figure S3F–H). In ipsilateral IT cortex we found 42 scattered cells outside of the face patches (17% of all the cells in IT, Figure S3L–N) and a connection with AL (195 cells, Figure S3I–K). We remind the reader the monkey B only had four face patches in the right hemisphere (missing AM and PL, Figure S3U–W), which could explain why only one connection to another face patch was found in this injection. We also found a projection from part of area V4 (334 cells) located within the inferior occipital sulcus (ios; Figure S3O–Q and R–T). We did not find any connection with MF and AF. A small projection was found from left ML (contralateral; 53 cells, Figure S10J–M).\n\nConnections of AL\n\nAL is located at the junction of TEm and TEad, on the ventral lip of STS (with the exception of monkey B, where right AL was located in TEad). Physiologically, AL is distinguished by the presence of two populations of face-selective cells, one tuned to upwards, downwards and straight views, and another tuned to left and right profiles in mirror symmetric fashion, positioning it between ML/MF and AM in terms of view-invariant identity selectivity (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010). We injected AL in three monkeys ( ): right AL in monkey N ( ), left and right AL in monkey B (Figures S4, S5), and right AL in monkey D (Figure S6).\n\nIn monkey N, the injection of Fast Blue precisely targeted AL; however, the injection site was mostly confined to the superficial layers I–III ( ). Most of the connections to AL were found in the ipsilateral temporal cortex ( ). The main projections were from AM (324 cells, ), AF (560 cells, ) ML (218 cells, ), and MF (98 cells, not shown). We found 112 cells outside of the face patches, scattered in IT cortex (8.5% of all cells counted in IT cortex, ), with two small clusters of cells situated posterior to AL and AF ( ).\n\nIn monkey B, we injected Fluoro Emerald in left AL. The left AL was very large in this case, so the injection was confined within its borders; however, the injection site was rather superficial, and mainly restricted to layers I–III (Figure S4H). In this monkey AL was connected to AM (186 cells, Figure S4I–K), accessory patch (97 cells, not shown in S4 but see Figure S2R–T), ML (1224 cells, Figure S4O–Q) and PL (45 cells, Figure S4R–T). No connections were found to the patches in the fundus of the STS (AF and MF) in the same hemisphere, nor to the patches in the contralateral hemisphere. 174 cells were found in IT cortex outside of the face patches, corresponding to 11% of the cells plotted in IT cortex (Figure S4L–N).\n\nRight AL in monkey B had an uncommon location, in TEad rather than at the ventral lip of the rostral STS at the junction of TEm and TEad, as in most monkeys and the left hemisphere in this monkey (Figure S5; compare the location of AL in the left and right hemispheres in F). We injected Fast Blue in this patch. As shown in Figure S5F–H the injection site encompassed most of the cortical layers and was precisely located in the patch. The main connections of right AL were with ML in the same hemisphere (1168 cells, Figure S5L–T), and the caudal parahippocampal area TFO in the medial temporal lobe (72 cells, Figure S5O–Q) and TH (37 cells, ). A total of 156 cells were found in IT cortex outside of the faces patches, representing 12% of the total number of cells in IT. Though most of these cells were scattered (Figure S5I–K), a small patch of projection neurons was found in an area of TEO, ventral to ML (76 cells, Figure S5R–T), and another small patch was visible posterior to the injection site (Figure S5W).\n\nIn monkey D, the injection of Cascade Blue in right AL was precise and located in all the cortical layers (Figure S6F–H). The main connections were found with right AM (1590 cells, Figure S6I–K), MF (642 cells, Figure S6O–Q) and ML (3025 cells, Figure S6O–Q). Figure S6Q shows very clearly two blobs of Cascade Blue staining, one in the fundus and one in the lower bank of the STS, corresponding respectively to MF and ML. A total of 630 cells were found in IT cortex outside of the face patches, representing 10.7% of the cells in IT cortex (e.g., labeling in area TEad; Figure S6L–N). In addition to these projections we found connections with perirhinal cortex (56 cells), and parahippocampal areas TF (268 cells, Figure S6O–P, star in S6P), and TFO (78 cells, Figure S6R–T). A weak connection was also found with orbitofrontal area 13 (12 cells, not shown). Several connections with the contralateral face patches in the left hemisphere were found in this injection, with AM (638 cells, not shown), ML, and MF (231 and 74 cells, respectively; Figure S10N–Q). We remind the reader that monkey D did not have AL in the left hemisphere.\n\nConnections of AM\n\nAM, the most anterior face patch in the temporal lobe, is located in ventral anterior TE (TEav). Functionally, it contains a fully view-invariant representation of facial identity and likely represents the endpoint of IT face processing (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010). We injected AM in three monkeys: left AM in monkey N ( ), right AM in monkey D (Figure S7), and left AM in monkey B (Figure S8).\n\nThe injection site of CTB-488 in monkey N is shown in and is well centered in the middle layers of the cortex in left AM. Most of the projection neurons were co-localized with the face patches ( ). The main connections were with AL (3789 cells, ), AF (281 cells, data not shown), and MF (899 cells, ), in the same hemisphere. A total of 262 cells were scattered outside the temporal lobe, 5% of the total number of cells found in IT ( ). Two small projections were found in orbitofrontal cortex, area 13m (6 cells, ), and in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, area 45 (9 cells, ). Projections were also found from contralateral AM (110 cells), AL (554 cells, Figure S10R–U), and AF (13 cells, Figure S10R–U).\n\nIn the right AM of monkey D, we injected Lucifer Yellow (Figure S7). The injection was confined to AM and centered in the middle of the cortical depth (Figure S7F–H). The main projections to AM were from face patches in the right (ipsilateral) temporal cortex (Figure S7U–W), specifically from AL (1222 cells), AF (332 cells), ML (808 cells, Figure S7R’–T’), and MF (1018 cells, Figure S7R’, S’). A total of 361 cells were found in IT cortex, outside of the face patches (Figure S7O–Q), 9.6% of all the cells in the right IT cortex. Right AM was also connected with perirhinal cortex, area 36c (144 cells, Figure S7L–N), and parahippocampal cortical areas TF (133 cells, Figure S7R–T) and TFO (109 cells, not shown). In addition, a weak connection was found with orbitofrontal area 13m (10 cells, Figure S7I–K). Connections were also found in the contralateral left hemisphere, with ML (52 cells, Figure S10V–X) and MF (48 cells, Figure S10V–Y).\n\nWe injected BDA in left AM of monkey B. This injection showed spillover into the white matter above the injection site (Figure S8H). This likely happened while retracting the cannula after injection, due to the high sensitivity of the tracer, and caused non-specific labeling near the injection site (Figure S8H). The main projections to AM were from AL (214 cells, Figure S8I–K) and ML (392 cells, Figure S8R–T). Scattered cells were also found outside of the face patches, e.g., in TEad (Figure S8L–N) and in the ventral posterior inferotemporal cortex, area TEpv (Figure S8O–Q). In total, we found 373 BDA-positive cells in left IT cortex outside of the face patches (38% of all the cells in IT). A projection was found from contralateral AL (90 cells, not shown).\n\nSubcortical connections of the face patches\n\nOne of the major goals of this study was to discover where information about faces might be routed, following passage through IT cortex. Surprisingly, we did not find strong connections from prefrontal cortex, as we had expected based on (1) the previous literature (Saleem et al., 2014, Borra et al., 2011), and (2) a previous unpublished finding from our lab that electrical microstimulation of AM activates two pre-frontal face patches in ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex (Moeller et al., 2008a). Instead, we found strikingly strong connections between the face patches and three subcortical structures, namely, the pulvinar, claustrum, and amygdala.\n\nWe found projections from the claustrum to all four injected face patches. In monkey N, the claustrum was connected with ipsilateral AM, in monkey D with ipsilateral AM, AL, ML and PL, and in monkey B with ipsilateral AL. The part of the claustrum connected with the face patches was consistently the ventral claustrum ( , S11A–I). We found that in all the cases we examined, neurons projecting to different face patches were in distinct regions and never overlapping. For example, in monkey D ( ), projections from the claustrum to PL (CTB-555) and ML (Fast Blue) in the same hemisphere were located very close to each other, but cells were not mingling. In monkey D, for technical reasons we were unable to see double labeling (tracers injected into right AM [Lucifer Yellow] and right AL [Cascade Blue] were not directly visible with fluorescence so we had to develop them by immunoperoxidase method with DAB). However the areas of projection to AM and AL were shifted by 500 µm: connections with AL were located at AP +13 and connections with AM were located at AP +13.5 (Figure S11D–I).\n\nThe connections from the pulvinar to the face patches were located in the lateral part (pl, and S11J–O). As in the claustrum, we found that different face patches receive projections from distinct subregions of the lateral pulvinar. In monkey B, we found projections to AL ( ) and ML ( ). AL had two areas of projection from the pulvinar: a main one at AP +3 and a smaller one at AP +1; the projection site to ML was located at AP +2, interdigitated with the one to AL. In monkey D, we found that the projection sites to right AL and right AM were separated by 500 µm (Figure S11J–O). In one case where we saw successful anterograde labeling, following injection of Lucifer Yellow in right ML of monkey B, we found anterograde labeling of axon terminals in the pulvinar ( ), and these axon terminals ended in the same region of the pulvinar that sent projections back to ML. Thus, at least in this case, the connections from the pulvinar to ML are reciprocal and form a loop.\n\nWe found projections from the amygdala in monkey D to AL and AM. Patch AL mainly received projections from the magnocellular subdivision of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmc) of the amygdala ( ), and AM from the intermediate subdivision of the basal nucleus (Bi, ).\n\nOverall, these findings show that each face patch is connected to a discrete subregion of these three subcortical structures, with minimal or no overlap between the areas of projection.\n\nControl injection outside of the face patches\n\nIn one monkey (monkey B), we made a control injection outside of the face patches (Figure S9). True Blue was injected in the lower bank of the STS, in a region between AL and ML corresponding to AP +7 (Figure S9F–H). Recordings were performed immediately prior to injection and cells along the penetration were not selective to any object category (Figure S9D). The efficiency of this injection was not good: we only counted 256 cells. These cells were mainly found in two small clusters (Figure S9L–Q), and neither was in a face patch (See panel “W” in the figure). This result suggests that not only do face patches not receive much input from the rest of IT cortex, they also do not send highly distributed output within IT.\n\nLayer analysis\n\nTo attempt to understand the hierarchical relationships between face patches, we used a set of widely accepted criteria established by classical studies (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Maunsell and van Essen, 1983; Rockland and Pandya, 1979). According to this model, the hierarchical structure of a circuit can be deduced from the layer position of the somata and synaptic terminals of the projection neurons. For retrograde labeling, if the majority of cell bodies (>70%) lie in supragranular layers, the connection is feedforward; if more than 70% of the cell bodies lie in the infragranular layers the connection is feedback; if the segregation of the cells is not as clear (30–70% of the cells lie in supra or infragranular layers) then the connection is bilaminar. If data from anterograde tracing are missing, as in our case, bilaminar retrograde labeling is compatible with any of the three hierarchical relationships, therefore in this study we will refer to connections of this type as ambiguous.\n\nThe percentage of neurons in the superficial layers in each face patch are indicated in Table S1. For layer analysis we excluded all the injections where the cell count in IT cortex was low (less than 1000 cells) such as left PL, right ML, and left AM in monkey B, or where the injection was limited to supragranular layers such as left ML and left AL in monkey B. A diagram summarizing hierarchical relationships based on layer analysis is shown in Figure S12. Out of the 20 connections taken in consideration, 8 had a clear direction of either feedforward (indicated by a blue arrow) or feedback projection (red arrow) and 12 had an ambiguous direction (green arrow). According to the Felleman and Van Essen criteria, all but one of these connections were either feedforward or ambiguous.\n\nConnections with subcortical regions\n\nWe found that the face patches are connected to the claustrum, pulvinar, and the amygdala. We found projections from claustrum to all the face patches. Labeled cells were localized to the ventral part of the claustrum, consistent with the connections between this subcortical structure and subregions of IT (Cheng et al., 1997; Webster et al., 1993). In monkey D, we found cells in the claustrum from two different injections in both hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, we identified two adjacent but non-overlapping clusters of cells projecting respectively to PL and to ML. In the right hemisphere, we found projections to AL and AM. These results indicate that the claustrum, like the pulvinar and amygdala (see below), has connections to the face patches that are focal and individual-patch specific. Almost nothing is known about the function of the primate claustrum, beyond that it is not multi-modal (Remedios et al., 2010). The existence of different regions of the claustrum connected to different face patches raises the obvious question, what is the functional role of these regions?\n\nConnections with the pulvinar were found in two monkeys. In one animal, the pulvinar was connected with PL, AL, and AM, in the second with ML and AL. Thus all four face patches tested have connections with this structure. Connections were mainly with the lateral pulvinar and had an antero-posterior organization: more anterior face patches connected to more anterior areas of the pulvinar. In the two cases where two face patches were injected in the same hemisphere, we did not find any evidence for overlapping connections in the pulvinar. This is strikingly in disaccord with the replication principle (Shipp, 2003), which states that cortical regions that are connected project to the same area of the pulvinar. It is possible that the replication principle, together with the communication facilitation hypothesis, holds for some regions, like V4 and TEO, but not for others, such as the face patches; our results underscore the need for combining neuroanatomy with electrophysiology in exploration of the pulvinar.\n\nWe found projections from the amygdala only to AL and AM, located in anterior TE. Cell bodies were found mainly in the accessory basal nucleus after AL injection, and in the basal nucleus after AM injection. These results are consistent with Webster et al., who found projections from these subregions of amygdala to TE and TEO (Webster et al., 1991). The amygdala contains cells selective for specific identities and expressions (Mosher et al., 2010), and most intriguingly, for eye contact (Zimmerman et al., 2012). The connection between the face patches and the amygdala may help to establish these properties."
