        "text": "This is the tenth of a whole series of interviews with all sorts of different people to show what effect adventure can have on your life. Initially, I will start with well established Adventurers and then we will branch out into people from all walks of life.\n\nMatt Prior\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n11 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 14, 2015\n\n--\n\nThe aim is to show how even the smallest amount of adventure can impact your life no matter who you are or where you come from.\n\nIf you’d like to take part and have a good story with pictures, please feel free to contact me via www.mattprior.co.uk\n\nIt has put a massive smile on my face reading about other people’s adventures and how pushing themselves out of their comfort zone has affected them in such a positive way. Over the past few months I’ve been asked by various people to do one of these from my own point of view and although it is slightly unconventional, it’s only answering the same questions so I thought I’d give it a bash. There are many more of these to come from some really interesting people so stay tuned!\n\nI won’t introduce myself here as that would be weird, but if this is the first time you’ve come across me, you can go to www.mattprior.co.uk for more info!\n\n“Commit to something, put your balls on the line and then figure it out.”\n\nPlease could you give us a quick run down on your life before adventure played a part:\n\nNomadic. The factories my dad worked at kept closing down so we moved around a lot. With that came the obvious: no long term friends, no real stability, always the new kid wherever I went etc. Apart from that it was fairly conventional, though we did live in a caravan at one point!\n\nFrom a very young age I was always curious about interesting people and what makes us happy. Up to the age of about 17, I largely followed what society dictated was the “path to success and happiness” and tried to excel as much as possible in whatever I did. All the while I focused on my dream of being a Pilot in the RAF. I was always sporty and loved the outdoors but I still felt that the life I was living was conventional and predictable.\n\n“From a very young age I was always curious about interesting people and what makes us happy.”\n\nHow and why did you get involved in all of this?\n\nI was drawn to the idea of adventure after various hardships (failure, death of friend/family, redundancy etc.) or when I felt I was stuck in a rut and knew things needed to change. Being a RAF Pilot was my goal since the age of 12, so when I failed to get in on the first attempt I didn’t know where to turn. I decided to get away and do something different and challenging, with the hope that I’d come back refreshed and refocussed. I worked hard and saved for over a year. Eventually I had enough to set off for Africa where I climbed mountains, slept under the stars, saw wild animals, met people who had never seen foreigners before and generally pushed myself out of my comfort zone as much as possible.\n\nIt worked a treat and I often go away for those reasons now. They show you what you’re actually capable of, not what you think you’re capable of. I realised I could go on these trips and not only have a great time and meet amazing people but also gain a lot in terms of personal development. The more I did, the more I pushed myself, the more I learned and the happier I became. It’s a cycle I haven’t been able to stop. That’s meant I have sacrificed other parts of my life to allow for adventures, but it’s all about choices at the end of the day!\n\n“I realised I could go on these trips and not only have a great time and meet amazing people but also gain a lot in terms of personal development.”\n\nDo you think anyone could do what you do?\n\nPut simply, yes (as long as they’re able to pass a Pilot medical, that’s the one uncontrollable factor). I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily easy and a lot of what I do involves a lot of behind the scenes work but ultimately, I think it’s available to almost everyone. You just have to believe in yourself and take the first step — which is usually the hardest. Once you go for these dreams, slowly and step by step, momentum takes over. You’ll be amazed how many people will help you along the way with whatever it is you’re trying to achieve.\n\nA lot of us reading this are lucky to be born into a relatively affluent part of the world — you should use that opportunity as there’s millions out there who would literally die for the opportunities we have freely available, regardless of your background. (I went to public schools which weren’t the best and had very few opportunities in comparison to many others, but you can create them, you just need to look elsewhere!) It’s a shame it’s not explained more in our education system. It’s only when you see what the developing world is like that you realise how lucky we are to have been born in the countries we were.\n\n“You’ll be amazed how many people will help you along the way with whatever it is you’re trying to achieve.”\n\nWhat would you say are the main excuses for not doing this sort of stuff and how would you suggest people overcome them?\n\nI’d say that most of this is in people’s heads and if you REALLY want to do something, there’s nearly always a way. The main excuses I hear are: time, money and family commitments. We all have to juggle these and in most cases, I think it depends where your priorities lie. (I do realise that there are cases where it is extremely hard, if not impossible eg. 24hr care for someone else, so this is more of a general comment.) I’m not saying adventures should be at the top of the list, because they shouldn’t but having a balance rather than the never-ending focus on money and excuses of why it’s “not possible” would be a good start.\n\nOne of the big things I have noticed is that making a change in your spending habits and lifestyle can make these opportunities far more likely. Even having one adventure for a short amount of time can make a world of difference in how you live your life. (And the shift in perspective it creates may save you money and time in the future, so look at it as an investment!) For a small risk in the grand scheme of things, there’s potentially a life changing reward.\n\n“One of the big things I have noticed is that making a change in your spending habits and lifestyle can make these opportunities far more likely.”\n\nYou have to take risks, otherwise you will remain stagnant. You know what’s going to happen if you don’t take risks, but if you did; doors can open, you meet new people, have new experiences, create new opportunities, it may even change yours and even other people’s lives for the better!\n\nA lot of people take several decades or longer to learn big life lessons. I often refer to this list made by a nurse who for several years counselled thousands of dying people in their last days. It makes me commit to things and follow through when I have the doubts that we all naturally have. If all these people had these regrets, I’m fairly confident we’ll all have similar ones if we don’t do something about it.\n\nThere’s never a perfect time and if you wait for that, you’ll be waiting until the day you die. Even if you do absolutely nothing that raises an eyebrow with your life, you’ll still get criticised, so you may as well go for it!\n\n“If all these people had these regrets, I’m fairly confident we’ll all have similar ones if we don’t do something about it.”"
