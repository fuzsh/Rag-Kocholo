        "text": "Patch Cipriano (real name Jev) Age 700+ Occupation Bus Boy (Hush, Hush)\n\nNora's Guardian Angel Gender Male Home Heaven (formerly)\n\nColdwater, Maine Romances Nora Grey (wife/girlfriend)\n\nDabria † (ex-girlfriend)\n\nJolie Abrams † (first love)\n\nHeight 6'2\" Race Fallen Angel Fate Alive (immortal) Appearances Hush, Hush\n\nCrescendo\n\nSilence\n\nFinale\n\nSpoiler warning!\n\nThis article contains plot details about the series.\n\nJev \"Patch\" Cipriano is a Fallen Angel who becomes a Guardian Angel. He is a powerful fallen angel who has a lot of enemies. He spends his time playing pool at Bo's Arcade, hanging out at Delphic Park, and looking out for his girlfriend at every possible turn. He didn't care for anything else other than becoming human until he met Nora Grey.\n\nHe knows how to become human - by offering Nora, his Nephilim vessel's female descendant, as a sacrifice. On the other hand, Dabria, Patch's old flame, tells him he can become Nora's guardian angel by saving her from death. Patch is left with the choice of being human or returning as a guardian angel.\n\nIt is also mentioned in Crescendo and Silence that his real name is, in fact, \"Jev\".\n\nHe lives in an underground studio beneath Delphic Amusement Park but is forced to move on short notice in Finale after an archangel trashed his studio. According to Nora he is the embodiment of masculine perfection and radiates mystery. He drives a black vintage Harley Davidson sportster motorcycle. He is also associated with the color black.\n\nIn Crescendo and Silence, Patch contacts Nora during her dreams. She is able to do the same in Silence.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nHe keeps his past under wraps and is accused of keeping more lies than telling truth from Nora - he is not, in fact, lying, but simply avoids the questions he is asked. He can be sly and brooding, he frequently leaves Nora furious or tongue-tied. He uses his charm as a way of getting what he wants and avoiding unwanted questions, though he begins to open up as the series progresses. He spends most of his time playing pool at Bo's Arcade. Nora eventually learns he is a fallen angel, who fell when he loved a human girl and tried to be with her. After failing to take control of a human body, the avenging angels ripped Patch's wings off on his way back to heaven. He cannot feel physically—it is described like experiencing the world through a pane of glass—but he can experience emotions. When he is restored as a guardian angel, he regains the ability to fly, though he still cannot feel, as he has not yet \"earned\" that right to feel back. But in the end of Finale, Patch can finally feel Nora's touch as well as other physical stimulation.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPatch is described as the ultimate bad boy, from his attitude to the way he dresses, “dark-Levi’s, dark-Henley, dark boots kind of guy who smells of spice, mint, and leather\". He has curly black hair, deep black eyes that \"take in everything and give back nothing\", a rugged skin tone (like a Spaniard) and is six-foot-two. According to Nora, he has sharp, almost Italian features. He is muscular, lean, and bore several scars, including a V-shaped scar on his back from when his wings were ripped off twice, first when he fell from Heaven and then when he traded his wings to Hank for Nora's freedom after he had gained them back. It is also stated by many people that he looks and can be very intimidating and scary. Yet apparently his features are too 'tough' to be beautiful. Patch also wears a silver metal necklace, his Archangel necklace, with his black attire.\n\nBackground[]\n\nPatch used to be an Archangel but fell from Heaven after falling in love with a human girl and attempting to be with her (by possessing a body and failing). According to Patch's Lost Letter to Nora, however, Patch states that he had used that girl as an excuse and that the real reason he fell was that he was tired of the archangels' shifting goals and wanted to push back against them and their rules. The reason he had stated that the girl was the reason he fell, it was because it simplified his motivations. (Whether or not this can be considered true is debatable). Before he fell, he was in a relationship with Dabria - an Angel of Death - for an unknown amount of time. It is unclear how much he cared for her, as he has soft moments for her, but he also left her to be with a human girl.\n\nAfter he fell, he met an Irish fallen angel by the name of Rixon, and they were friends for centuries afterwards until Patch finds out Rixon's plot against Nora Grey, and chains him in hell. Obviously his friendship with Rixon was diminished. But later when all the fallen angels were chained in hell, Patch possesses Rixon's body in order to get out of hell, because Dante offers Rixon and other fallen angels the chance to get out but they have to swear loyalty to him, but Patch refuses to do so.\n\nIn Crescendo, Patch reveals that his real name is Jev, and is secretly dating Nora in Silence. He reveals to her her past which she has forgotten. Hank ripped out his wings in an agreement to let Nora free\n\nAfter Chauncey/Jules' demise, Patch does not have a Nephil vassal until the Nephilim meeting that Nora arranges with The Black Hand's Army's higher ranks in Finale. Scott then swears fealty to Patch so that he can possess Scott and see what goes on at the meeting.\n\nPowers[]\n\nAs a fallen angel, Patch is stripped of most of his angelic powers, but can still manipulate the minds of weak willed humans, possess them for short periods, and create illusions. Though he is a very powerful fallen angel, he was an even more powerful archangel before he fell. In Silence, Patch's wings are torn off by a Nephilim named Hank Millar, and he again becomes a fallen angel.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nNora Grey - Nora is the love of Patch's life and his wife by the end of the series. They love each other more than anything and would do anything for each other. Patch is extremely protective of Nora and before meeting her, all he cared about was getting a human body but he even gave that up once he realized a human body meant nothing to him if he didn't have Nora with him.\n\nAt first, Patch came into Nora's life because she was his Nephil vassal, Chauncey's female descendant which meant that killing her would kill him and Patch would get a human body as he learned about in the book of Enoch. However, despite attempting to kill her various times, he could never go through with it because he fell in love with her and at one point, Nora was about to die at Chauncey's hand and finding no way out, but wanting to do something for Patch, killed herself so he could have a human body. Patch refused her sacrifice since having a human body didn't matter much anymore if he didn't have Nora.\n\nFor two months after those events, Nora and Patch were together and happy and Patch was Nora's guardian angel but he had to distance himself a bit from her since the archangels were upset as guardian angels are not supposed to be in a relationship with whom they're supposed to save. He would try to contact her in her dreams but nothing seemed to work and Patch's friend Rixon, wanting to sacrifice her lied to her and fed the clues that led her to believe that Patch is the one that killed her father. Throughout the second book Patch was pretending to date Marcie since Nora said she didn't want him as her guardian angel and he was then assigned to Marcie. By the end of the book, Patch saves Nora's life and goes rogue in doing so since he could not have interfered since he wasn't her guardian angel anymore. He finally takes her to the place where he lives but before anything happens, Hank Millar, Nora's biological dad goes there and asks them who killed Chauncey.\n\nThe third book starts with Nora in a cemetery and apparently Patch lets Hank rip out his wings. Nora has now lost all her memories and has been missing for 2/3 months but her memories have been wiped out for months before that, to the point where Patch came into her life. Nora does not remember him but has dreams and even once almost remembered him. Chance encounters and Nora being in danger resulting in them meeting. Nora's friend Scott who is also Nephilim meets her and tells her what she doesn't remember, everything about Nephilim and Fallen Angels. They break into a warehouse and Nora goes back a few days later and is in trouble when Patch, now going by his original name Jev, rescues her, and later, she gets her memories back and Patch lets her touch his wing scars. A series of events occur which result in Hank dying and since Nora swore an oath, she is now supposed to lead his Nephilim army to war against fallen angels. Patch promises her as he knows she has no choice but to lead the army that he would stand by her through everything. Throughout the book, Nora and Patch pretend to not be together and Nora pretends to be with Dante, her second in command. Around the end, Patch and Nora get possession of all of the fallen angels' feathers including Patch's and Marcie burns them all after finding out that Nora killed her father. Patch dies due to this and is in hell along with all the other fallen angels. Nora finally goes out after hours of crying to fight in the duel against Dante who betrays all the Nephilim including Nora.\n\nAfter a series of events, Nora kills Dante and eradicates Devilcraft. Detective Basso, a prominent character now revealed as an archangel undercover thanks her and tells her to go for a clean cut through the mark on her wrist and leaves. Nora sees Patch, they run into each other's arms and realize that Patch has been crying, thinking that he lost her. He reveals that when devilcraft got eradicated he didn't die among the others due to the fact that he didn't swear an oath and inject devilcraft but instead possessed his friend Rixon long enough to leave hell. Patch says some vows and Patch and Nora take a blood oath signalling that they are now married without all the ceremonies. When Nora goes for a clean cut through her mark and they complete the oath, Patch claims he can feel her and Nora realizes that this was Basso's gift to her that Patch a fallen angel who could not physically feel before, now can. The epilogue takes place 3 years later with Nora and Patch at her best friend Vee's wedding and they both are happy. Nora's mom is warming up to their pairing and is co-organizing Vee's wedding, finally accepting the fact that Nora and Patch would not have a traditional wedding.\n\nRixon- Rixon was a fallen angel just like Patch and they seem to have known each other for a very long time. Patch doesn't let a lot of people into his life or truth them, but he really trusted Rixon, and they would playfully beat each other up at times. Patch finds out Nora's life is in danger and also that Rixon is the one trying to kill her so he can have a human body. Rixon even feeds Nora lies which lead her to believe Patch killed her father instead of himself and tries to push them apart. At first, Patch couldn't intervene due to the fact that he wasn't Nora's guardian angel anymore but when he realized Rixon was going to kill her at that point, he went rogue, saved Nora and chained Rixon to hell. When Patch tells Nora this, it is evident he was sad and upset since Rixon was like a brother to him but betrayed him in the end."
