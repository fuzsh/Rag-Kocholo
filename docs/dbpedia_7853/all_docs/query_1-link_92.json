        "text": "Enter your date of birth\n\nMonth: Year:\n\nSorry, you do not meet the minimum age requirements\n\nContent Summary\n\nMultiplayer Maps: Three Brand New Core 6v6 Maps\n\nDeploy to an isolated research outpost in the mountains of Urzikstan on this mid-sized snow map based in and around the main transport facility. Climb up on the red container or the low roof along the top path to get over your enemies and use objects places around the main facility to climb up into the building.\n\nAccess the funicular’s lower carriage for a vantage point over the bottom lane. Be careful not to slip down the mountainside when exiting the carriage. Generally, mid-ranged Loadouts will perform best along the outer perimeter while close-ranged weapons reign in the interior locations (the main facility plus the smaller buildings near each starting spawn).\n\nDas Gross (Mid-Season)\n\nNew (Variant), Core, 6v6, Small-Sized\n\nAn ominous orange mist hangs in the air. Revolting preternatural tendrils and flapping tentacles have enveloped the high-rise construction site formerly known as Das Haus, snaking into every corner and transforming it into a nightmarish alien madness. Look for Das Gross to be added to the Vortex map Playlist.\n\nMultiplayer Modes: Demolish, Cause Havoc, Get Cranked\n\nEliminate the enemy while experiencing changing gameplay modifiers throughout the match.\n\nLast seen in Season 5 of Modern Warfare II (2022), Havoc is a Core Multiplayer mode inspired by classic arena-shooter gameplay, with additional enhancements courtesy of a random selection of chaos-inducing modifiers. Expect gameplay to be consistently entertaining, fast-paced, and never the same.\n\nThe action begins with the Team Deathmatch ruleset in effect, with the first team to reach 75 points awarded the win. However, Killstreaks (except those awarded with a modifier) are disabled, and a variety of match-changing modifiers come into play!\n\nOnce the action starts, you’ll notice a series of five circular icons under your map compass, at the top of the screen. These indicate the modifiers currently in play. After a two and a half-second countdown, your first modifier is awarded. Then, once either team has reached a score multiplier of 12 kills (12, 24, 36 and 48), another new modifier is added to the match, affecting both teams immediately, from the following modifier pool:\n\nAmmo Feeder: Auto reload after you kill an enemy.\n\nBoots off the Ground: Low gravity.\n\nCamera Shift: Third-person mode.\n\nChain Reaction: Sticky Grenades launched on kill.\n\nCharged Up: Gain Cranked on kills.\n\nEquipment Restock: Equipment is refilled on kills.\n\nEyes On: Advanced UAV is always active.\n\nGun Runner: Random gun on kill.\n\nHero Smash: Explosive landing from an elevated position.\n\nHot Shot: Crossbows only, Molotov bolts.\n\nLucky Three: Every three kills gives you a random Killstreak.\n\nOne Tap: Headshots kill with one bullet.\n\nSnapshot Killer: Launch a snapshot grenade (and ping pulse) on kill.\n\nSystem Reroll (Fifth Modifier only): Full reroll of all active modifiers.\n\nGame Mode: Headshots Only (Mid-Season)\n\nLook for Playlist updates that indicate the presence of certain gameplay modifiers, like the Minefield Mode in Season 3. Expect some playlists to have active Killstreak, or Event-based modifiers which may include one or more of the following. These will apply to any Multiplayer Mode you are currently playing within the Playlist:\n\nLooping Killstreaks: Streaks reset fully once you reach the upper end of your current streaks, allowing you to earn unlimited streaks in one life.\n\nEarning Killstreaks: You receive points added to your streak if you slay an enemy player with your Killstreak, or Assist in killing a player with your Killstreak.\n\nKillstreak Cache: When a player is eliminated, they drop a cache containing a percentage of their earned Killstreak progress. Grab the cache and add it to your own progress!\n\nCritical Countdown Event Items: During the forthcoming Critical Countdown Event, expect enemies to drop [[REDACTED]] in-game items that can be collected to more quickly progress the Event.\n\nGame Modes: Additional Content (In-Season, Mid-Season)\n\nThe grind continues! As always, you can earn MWIII Ranked Play rewards in three ways:\n\nRank Rewards: Available at launch and can be earned in any season. Players can continue their previous rank grind in Season 4.\n\nSeason Rewards: Available at the start of a season and only available in that season.\n\nEnd-of-Season Rewards: Rewards that are awarded after the season has ended and represent either your highest attained division or an active placement in the Top 250 Division. Season 4 brings new seasonal content to unlock in MWIII Ranked Play!\n\nWhile Ranked Rewards are unchanged from season to season, Skill Division Rewards have been updated.
