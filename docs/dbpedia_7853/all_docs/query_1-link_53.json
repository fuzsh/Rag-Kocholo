        "text": "This article has links to products that I may make commission from.\n\nIf you have an east facing garden, you may be wondering how to make the most of it.\n\nAn east facing garden can present both challenges and opportunities.\n\nOn the one hand, it receives most of its sunlight in the morning, which can limit the types of plants that can be grown.\n\nOn the other hand, the cooler temperatures and partial shade provided by east facing gardens can be ideal for certain types of plants.\n\nWith some careful planning, you can create a beautiful and productive garden that takes advantage of an east facing orientation.\n\nIn this guide, I will share with you everything you need to know about planning an east facing garden, from choosing the right plants to making the most of your garden's unique features.\n\nAn east facing garden is a garden that faces towards the east, which means that it receives most of its sunlight during the morning hours.\n\nThis type of garden can be situated on the east side of a building, fence or wall, or it can be an open garden that faces towards the east.\n\nBecause an east facing garden receives most of its sunlight during the morning hours, it tends to be cooler in the afternoon than a garden that faces south or west.\n\nThis can be beneficial for plants that prefer cooler temperatures, but it can also limit the types of plants that can be grown in the garden since many plants require full sun to thrive.\n\nAn east facing garden can also be more suitable for shade loving plants, as it provides only partial sun during the day.\n\nIt's important to take into account the specific conditions of the garden, such as the amount of shade, moisture, and soil quality, in order to determine the best types of plants to grow in an east facing garden.\n\nLeafy Greens:\n\nVegetables such as lettuce, spinach, and kale are ideal for an east-facing garden because they prefer cooler temperatures and don't require full sun to grow.\n\nVegetables like kale can also benefit from the morning sunlight that an east facing garden receives.\n\nCheck out my guide to Growing Lettuce in Containers for everything you need to know about growing leafy greens.\n\nBroccoli and Cauliflower:\n\nBroccoli and cauliflower can tolerate partial shade and cooler temperatures, making them a good choice for an east facing garden.\n\nThey do require some sunlight to mature properly, so it's important to choose a variety that can tolerate less light.\n\nTo learn more about growing cauliflower check out my guide to companion plants for cauliflower.\n\nBeans:\n\nBeans can grow in partial shade and prefer cooler temperatures, making them a good choice for an east facing garden.\n\nThey also benefit from the morning sunlight that an east facing garden receives.\n\nRoot Vegetables:\n\nVegetables such as carrots, radishes, and beets can do well in an east facing garden if the soil is well-drained and the plants are watered regularly.\n\nWhile these vegetables may not grow as quickly as they would in full sun, they can still produce a healthy crop.\n\nCheck out my guide to Growing Carrots in Containers.\n\nHerbs:\n\nMany herbs, such as cilantro, parsley, and chives, can grow well in partial shade and cooler temperatures.\n\nThey can also benefit from the morning sunlight that an east facing garden receives.\n\nTo learn more about growing herbs check out our post on the best combinations of herbs to grow together.\n\nGarlic:\n\nGarlic can tolerate partial shade and cooler temperatures, making it a good choice for an east facing garden.\n\nIt also requires well-drained soil and regular watering.\n\nTo learn more about the best compost for vegetable gardens check out my guide to the best compost."
