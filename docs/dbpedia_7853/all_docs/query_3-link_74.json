We’ll be adding new mini-trips throughout the semester. Some of these trips are added within 2 weeks of departure. Check back often under the “Mini Hikes” section below.\n\n“Mini-trips” are perfect for those who just want to get away for a relaxed, half-day hiking trips. These trips are small, 1/2-day hikes within 90-minutes or of Atlanta. They last roughly from 8 a.m. until about 3 p.m. Though some trips are scheduled to leave later in the morning and get back later in the day. These trips are an opportunity to get out of town and splash around in a creek or hike to the top of a small mountain and catch a pretty view. Mini-trips are limited to 6 people plus 2 or 3 ORGT staff. They’re fun escapes from campus. The cost is just $25 per person.\n\nFULL-DAY & OVERNIGHT TRIPS\n\nORGT has offered full-day and overnight weekend adventures for over 50 years! What makes them so great?\n\nMost of our trips beginner friendly. ORGT is a Campus Recreation program, not a club. We offer more than 100 open-enrollment adventure trips each year plus a whole lot more. There are opportunities to try something new and opportunities to build your skills.\n\nTrips are led by skilled Georgia Tech students and alumni. While paddling, caving, backpacking, and climbing aren’t rocket science, our trip leaders are rocket scientists (or at least are on their way to becoming something close to it.) When GT students apply the same passion to leading adventure trips that they put into academics, the results are amazing.\n\nThis fall, all trip registrations can be completed online at mycrc.gatech.edu. During spring and fall, trip registration opens 30 days before the trip goes out. You can register for trips as early as 30-days before the day of departure. Check the posted day for online registrations to open. More information on how to sign up can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nSuccessful participation in an adventure trip could lead you to one day becoming an ORGT trip leader. Just ask the staff on your next adventure and they’ll direct you to the next steps, including nomination, acceptance, orientation, and ongoing training.\n\nUPCOMING MINI TRIPS\n\nRegister for Mini-trips at mycrc.gatech.edu. Find the trips by clicking ‘All Programs’, then navigating to ‘Outdoor Recreation’ under the ‘classification’ tab.\n\nFee for mini-trips is just $25.00 per person which includes equipment, staff, transportation, and any permit fees.\n\nFee for full-sized adventure programs is $50-$60.\n\nStay tuned for more fall mini-trips.\n\nDestination Sample Mini-trips.

Sample\n\nTRIP DETAILS\n\nTrip details This info DOES NOT apply to Mini-trips*\n\nTrips include expert instruction, specialty equipment, and transportation. We’ll provide a “What to Bring” list so you are prepared for factors such as weather and physical activity, but typically, participants do not need to purchase any equipment in order to participate. You are responsible for bringing their own food and snacks, as well as money to purchase breakfast and/or dinner if you want to eat out along the way.\n\nWe keep group sizes small so we can ensure quality experiences. Most trips are open to 12 or fewer participants.\n\nTrips involve a 2-3 hour required class session the week before your trip. The trip leader will email you with details. During this pre-trip meeting, you’ll meet trip leaders, learn basic skills, be oriented to what to expect, and get answers to any questions you may have.\n\nSome trips have pre-requisites. Before going on a paddling trip, you’ll have to pass a swimming test in the CRC pool, which consists of swimming 25-50 yards and treading water for a minute. You may not wear a PFD (personal flotation device) for the test. To register for an intermediate-level trip, you must have successfully completed a beginner trip.\n\nThere are no pre-trip classes before Mini-trips.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE?\n\nOutdoor Recreation serves the Georgia Tech Campus community.\n\nAdventure trips are intended to enhance experiences for current students.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff may rent gear and register for open-enrollment instructional adventure trips. Because ORGT experiences are partially underwritten by student fees, faculty and staff rates are 2x’s the published student rates. Sorry, alumni are not eligible.\n\nWe reserve the right to limit the number of guests and faculty or staff participants on any trip.\n\nIn the past, we have allowed GT students to bring one guest on adventure trips. We have suspended this practice until further notice.\n\nNo one under age 18–unless a current Georgia Tech student with a waiver signed by a parent or guardian–may participate on any adventure trip.\n\nHOW TO REGISTER?\n\nAll trip registration is online. Register now!\n\nThe Wilderness Outpost is open 2-7 p.m., Monday to Thursday, and 2-5 p.m. on Friday. Call 404-894-7420 during open hours if you have additional questions about trips.\n\nHow do you find the Wilderness Outpost? We’re located on the lowest level of the CRC. If you enter the front doors of the CRC, walk down the hallway past the Member Services desk, then continue down the stairs at the end of the hallway, and follow the signs. You can also access the Outdoor Recreation office by entering the backdoor of the CRC under the “Outdoor Recreation” sign.\n\nTrips fill on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration opens 30 days before the start date of the trip. Trips fill quickly.\n\nTrip prices average $45 for full-day trips and $55 for overnights..\n\nWhile we do not often cancel trips, it does happen occasionally–most often due to inclement weather. If we cancel a trip due to poor weather or some other factor, you are entitled to a full refund.\n\nIf you cancel your registration at least 7 days before the trip, you are entitled to a credit that can be applied to future trips or rentals. To cancel, email the Wilderness Outpost at outdoorrec@crc.gatech.edu.\n\nRefunds are not given if you fail to show-up for your trip."
