        "text": "Urban Agriculture News\n\nHere you can find resources for all things urban agriculture in the London and surrounding area.\n\nBuilding Resilient Communities: Relationships, Resources, and Re-imagination\n\nBuilding resilient and strong neighbourhoods is more important than ever, especially in the face of climate change and other societal stressors. To face these challenges, neighbourhood and small grassroots groups are organizing across cities in Ontario.\n\nTransforming the Forest City into the Food Forest City\n\nDid you know that London and its region was once a vibrant food forest? According to the latest scientific research, food forests reached from the southern Amazon in Brazil to the Maritimes in Canada. They were actively managed by indigenous peoples on vast scales using techniques such as periodic burning.\n\nVacant lots, empty land, city parks – London's future of urban farming?\n\nAmong the proposed changes is explicitly allowing the growing of food in all types of zones of the city, including residential zones, and exempting small- and medium-sized greenhouses that are outside residential areas from detailed reviews.\n\nUrban Agriculture Strategy takes another step forward\n\nThe framework for a strategy that will guide and support London’s urban farming community has reached the draft stage, another opportunity for stakeholders to weigh in on issues connected to the increasingly popular method of local food production.\n\nSource: tvo\n\nHow edible forests are changing London’s landscape (and foodscape)\n\n​If you grew up in a rural area — or even if you’ve just spent time in the country — chances are you’ve picked berries at the local patch. In the city, though, where can you find fresh food, free for the picking?\n\nSource: London Free Press\n\nPearson: Londoners are hungry for urban agriculture\n\nAs conferences go, it didn’t appear much different from the many other gatherings that take place in London each year and which seek to move forward one initiative or another. But there was something different about the Urban Agriculture gathering…\n\nLondoners have a chance to weigh in on upcoming urban agriculture policy\n\n​London is embarking on its first urban agriculture strategy and an upcoming conference at the Central Library November 19 is offering residents an opportunity to contribute.\n\nBuilding a Resilient City with a Network of Community Food Hubs\n\nWhat if one day you stepped into your grocery store and found the shelves empty? Could it happen here in London?"
