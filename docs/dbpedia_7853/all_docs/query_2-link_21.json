Our previous packaging process always took at least 1-2 weeks before an updated version of an app was available for deployment.\n\n{\n\nThis is one of the most excellent support/product teams I worked with so far! I would say, you guys know very well your product when it comes to troubleshooting.\n\nPatch My PC is an excellent tool to manage third party updates through SCCM. I’m completely satisfied.\n\n{\n\nI was trialing Patch Connect Plus and having issues. PCP’s support was poor, outsourced, and they did not help me solve my issue. I switched to a Patch My PC trial and was experiencing the same issue. Justin reached out to Microsoft in less than an hour on my behalf and had a resolution.\n\n{\n\nI have been using the catalog for a while now, and I must say that I’m impressed by the high quality of the updates and the richness of the catalog.\n\n{\n\nOur experience has been great! We used to use SCCM for Adobe and Java updates only, but now we are able to use it for all of our 3rd party software while still using SCCM. It has made our endpoints much more secure in an automatic way."
