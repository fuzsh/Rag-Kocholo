        "text": "Skin and mouth\n\nIt’s common for a rash to develop over parts of the body that are exposed to the sun, most commonly the face, wrists and hands. A butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is common in lupus.\n\nSome people notice that their fingers change colour in cold weather, going first very pale, then blue and finally red. This is called Raynaud’s phenomenon and is caused by narrowing of the blood vessels, which reduces the blood supply to the fingers or toes. It can happen in the cold or in stressful situations.\n\nYou may develop mouth ulcers. More rarely, ulcers can occur in the nose.\n\nHair\n\nGeneral thinning of the hair is fairly common among people who have lupus. In some cases, there may be patches where the hair doesn’t grow, and this is called alopecia. Rarely alopecia can be more severe and affect large areas of the scalp. This can be distressing, but once a flare-up is brought under control the hair will usually grow back.\n\nJoints\n\nJoint pain is common in lupus, especially in the small joints of the hands and feet. The pain often moves from joint to joint.\n\nJoint pain, swelling and stiffness can be the main symptoms for some people with lupus. In most cases, lupus is unlikely to cause permanent damage or change the shape of joints. But it can sometimes cause serious joint problems. It’s important you tell your doctor or specialist nurse if you have any new joint pain.\n\nA small number of people with lupus have joint hypermobility. This is when joints are very flexible. It can lead to problems such as joint pain, poor balance and in rare cases dislocation – when a joint pops out of place.\n\nPain from muscles and joints may be due to a condition called fibromyalgia. This is a widespread pain syndrome and is thought to be caused by an imbalance in the central nervous system that controls and processes pain signals. It’s more common among people with lupus.\n\nIf you have pain in your groin, you should see your doctor. This could be a sign of a more serious complication called avascular necrosis. This is when there is a loss of blood supply to bone, which can cause bone damage. Steroid treatment can make this more likely.\n\nKidneys\n\nPeople with lupus can have problems with their kidneys. Kidneys play several important roles, including helping to remove toxins from the blood. Until kidney damage is severe, it has no visible symptoms. It often causes high blood pressure.\n\nIn most cases if spotted early, kidney problems caused by lupus can be treated successfully. Medication can prevent permanent kidney damage.\n\nKidney function tests will be a part of your regular check-ups if you have lupus.\n\nBlood and blood vessels\n\nLupus may also cause anaemia, which is when you have a lack of red blood cells. These cells carry oxygen around the body, and if you don’t have enough of them you can get out of breath and tire quickly. If you have these symptoms you should tell your doctor or nurse specialist.\n\nPeople with lupus might also have a low number of platelets, cells that help the blood to clot. If you find that you are bruising easily or notice bleeding from the gums or nose you should let your doctor or nurse specialist know. Lupus can also affect your white blood cells, which are important in fighting infections.\n\nSome people with lupus are more at risk of developing blood clots in veins or arteries. This problem is usually caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. These autoantibodies can also affect pregnancy, causing an increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nIf blood clots occur blood thinning medication will be needed.\n\nBrain and nervous system\n\nPeople with lupus may experience anxiety or depression. Some people have dizziness, memory loss or confusion. Lupus can cause fits similar to epilepsy, or very rarely, feelings of paranoia.\n\nHeart and lungs\n\nLupus can cause high blood pressure, particularly if the kidneys are involved. Steroid tablets, which are often used to treat lupus, can raise blood pressure when used in high doses.\n\nLupus can also make you more likely to have high cholesterol. Having high levels of cholesterol and high blood pressure can increase the risk of heart attack or strokes.\n\nYou should have your blood pressure and cholesterol checked regularly and treated if necessary. Having a healthy diet, a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly and avoiding foods high in saturated fat and salt, can reduce your cholesterol and your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nOccasionally lupus directly affects the heart and lungs. More often, it causes inflammation in the lining tissues around the heart, known as pericarditis. It can also cause inflammation in the lining of the lungs, known as pleurisy. Both these conditions cause breathlessness and sharp pains in the chest.\n\nRarely, large amounts of fluid develop in these lining layers, causing severe breathlessness.\n\nLupus may also cause narrowing of the blood vessels. This can lead to an increased risk of angina, when a reduced amount of blood gets to the heart muscle.\n\nOther organs\n\nPeople with lupus can experience swelling of the lymph glands, which may cause discomfort. If you notice this happening, and especially if you also have high temperatures and are losing weight, talk to your doctor or nurse specialist.\n\nLess frequently, lupus can affect the lining tissue of the gut, the gut itself, pancreas, liver or spleen, all of which can cause pain in the stomach.\n\nVery rarely, lupus can cause a painful red eye or changes in your eyesight. If you have any symptoms affecting your eyes, it’s important to see a doctor as soon as possible. If left untreated, eye problems caused by lupus can lead to permanent damage to your eyesight. These issues are very treatable.\n\nSometimes people with lupus can have an underactive thyroid. This is when the thyroid glands in the neck don’t produce enough hormones. This can lead to problems such as tiredness, weight gain and depression.\n\nA condition known as Sjögren’s syndrome, which causes severe dryness of the eyes and mouth, is more common among people with lupus.\n\nLess commonly, people with lupus can have the inflammatory type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis, or a condition known as myositis, which is inflammation of the muscles.\n\nThere’s no cure for lupus at present. However, the condition can respond well to a number of drugs. The earlier treatment is started, the more effective it’s likely to be.\n\nDrugs\n\nThe drugs used to treat lupus will depend on how serious it is and which parts of your body are affected. Your treatments will probably be changed or adjusted as your symptoms flare up or improve. Many drugs used to treat lupus were originally developed for other conditions but were later found to be useful in lupus.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\nThese drugs can treat inflammation and pain in your joints. Examples include ibuprofen and naproxen.\n\nThey are often used for short periods of time. If used over a long term they can cause problems with the kidneys and so may not be advised for people who have had kidney disease. Other long-term side effects can include thinning of the lining of the stomach, so they may be prescribed with drugs known as antacids to protect against this.\n\nYou won’t usually be given NSAIDs if you’ve previously had stomach ulcers.\n\nSteroids\n\nSteroids, also known as corticosteroids, can reduce inflammation. There are different types of steroid medication.\n\nSteroid creams can be used to treat skin rashes.\n\nTablets, for example prednisolone, can be used for short periods when symptoms are active. They can also be used as a longer-term treatment if symptoms persist, but will often be reduced to the lowest effective dose.\n\nSteroid injections into a muscle or vein can help control a flare-up. Sometimes people can have steroid injections into the scalp to treat hair loss – though the hair often grows back on its own when the condition is brought under control.\n\nWhen taking steroid tablets, it’s a good idea to carry a steroid alert card, which records your dose and how long you’ve been taking it. If you become ill, or have an accident and are injured or unconscious, it’s important for the steroid to be continued or possibly even increased. Steroid treatment can prevent your body producing enough natural steroids in response to a trauma such as an injury. Because of this it is important not to suddenly stop taking them if you have been on them for a while without speaking to your rheumatologist first.\n\nYour doctor, rheumatology nurse specialist or pharmacist can give you a steroid card.\n\nAntimalarials\n\nThese drugs can help reduce inflammation. They can help to lower cholesterol and control kidney conditions.\n\nThe most common example used to treat people with lupus is called hydroxychloroquine. It can be used alone or with steroid creams for skin rashes. It’s also useful for fatigue and joint pain.\n\nIn some cases, hydroxychloroquine can affect the eyes. While this is rare, it can be serious. Therefore, you will need regular eye tests if you are taking this drug – especially if you’ve been taking it for five years or more.\n\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\n\nThese are drugs that reduce the effects of an overactive immune system. This can stop the immune system having a damaging effect on the body’s own tissues. Examples include:\n\nazathioprine\n\nciclosporin\n\ncyclophosphamide\n\nmethotrexate\n\nmycophenolate.\n\nThey may take several weeks or even up to three months to take effect. Then they might need to be taken over a long period. The dose could be reduced once your condition is under control.\n\nThey may be used along with steroid tablets and may allow the steroid dose to be reduced.\n\nPeople on DMARDs will need to have regular blood testing to check how effective they are, and what impact they are having on the body.\n\nBiological therapies\n\nBiological therapies are a newer type of DMARDs. They have a more targeted effect on specific cells within the immune system. Examples include rituximab and belimumab.\n\nThey can remove or reduce the activity of B-cells. These are a type of white blood cells, and in people with lupus they may produce harmful autoantibodies that attack the body’s own tissues.\n\nThey can be used to treat people with lupus when older types of DMARDs aren’t effective or if the lupus is very active.\n\nIf you’re taking a biological therapy, it’s a good idea to carry a biological therapy alert card. You can get one from your doctor or rheumatology nurse specialist. If you become unwell, anyone treating you will know you’re on a biological therapy and that you’re therefore possibly at risk of its side effects, including infections.\n\nIf there’s a significant build-up of fluid in the lining tissues of the heart or lungs, this may need to be drained using a needle and syringe.\n\nRarely, some people with lupus develop kidney failure, which may require dialysis. This is a treatment to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working. In some cases, people may need a kidney transplant.\n\nHowever, severe kidney damage can usually be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment of lupus.\n\nWhat about side effects?\n\nAll drugs have some potential side effects, and you and your doctor will need to balance the risk of side effects with the need to control your symptoms. Sometimes this may mean taking additional medications to protect against the side effects of others.\n\nTreatments such as calcium, vitamin D tablets and drugs called bisphosphonates may be given to guard against the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis. This condition can be a risk for people who take steroids at high doses or for long periods. You may be given DMARDs instead of high doses of steroids.\n\nIf you have lupus, and especially if you’re on a DMARD or biological therapy, you’ll be more prone to infection. Take care to avoid contact with people with infectious diseases like chickenpox or if they’ve recently been in hospital. You should discuss your vaccination status with your rheumatologist or GP. You might need to avoid live vaccines.\n\nIf you suffer from a severe infection or require antibiotics you may need to stop your DMARD treatment for a short time, and restart them once you’ve recovered from the infection.\n\nPlease visit our information pages on drugs for more information about your medication.\n\nDrugs are important in controlling lupus, but there’s also a lot you can do yourself to help manage your symptoms. Having a healthy diet, exercising regularly and not smoking will help reduce your risk of developing the more serious complications of lupus.\n\nManaging a flare-up\n\nLupus is a condition that naturally improves and worsens at different times. Learning how to manage a flare-up of your symptoms helps you to be more in control of your condition.\n\nThe reasons for a flare-up can vary from person to person, but exposure to sunlight, too little rest time, infections and stress can all play a part. It can be useful to try to spot the things that lead to a flare-up and find ways of managing or avoiding them.\n\nKeep in touch with your rheumatology team, especially through your rheumatology nurse specialist and the telephone advice line available in most units.\n\nFatigue\n\nYou may find you often experience fatigue, and it can be a big problem. If there’s a specific cause, such as anaemia or an underactive thyroid gland, this can be identified by a blood test and treated.\n\nSome medications such as hydroxychloroquine can help. Learning to pace yourself – finding the right balance between rest and activity – will help. Exercise improves fitness and stamina and can therefore help in overcoming fatigue, but you’ll need to start gently and gradually increase the amount you do. Ask to see a physiotherapist for advice about suitable exercises.\n\nSmoking\n\nMany of the problems caused by lupus can be made worse by smoking. For example:\n\nLupus and smoking can both cause narrowing of the blood vessels, causing circulatory problems and increasing the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\nLupus can make you more at risk of infections involving your throat, airways or lungs. Smoking can cause long-term lung damage which can make these infections more frequent and severe.\n\nWhen lupus affects the kidneys it can lead to high blood pressure. Smoking can also contribute to high blood pressure, increasing the risk of strokes and worsening kidney disease.\n\nWhile it can be difficult to stop smoking, treatments are available that can help you to stop. Talk to your GP or call a smoking helpline to find out the ways they can help.\n\nIf you do smoke, giving up can be one of the most important things you do to reduce the risk of the more serious complications of lupus.\n\nExercise\n\nThere will be times when you may not feel like doing very much and it’s important to rest when you need to. However, too much rest will cause the muscles to weaken and may make you feel more tired, so you need to find the right balance between rest and exercise.\n\nWalking and swimming are recommended as they can improve fatigue, fitness, strength and stamina without putting too much strain on the joints. Even when you’re having a flare-up, a small amount of exercise is helpful, and you should find some gentle exercise that you can do even on a bad day.\n\nExercise, particularly weight-bearing exercise such as walking or jogging, can help to keep bones strong. This can reduce the chances of the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis, that can be more likely if you take steroid tablets.\n\nDiet and nutrition\n\nThere’s only limited evidence available on the effect of diet in controlling lupus. However, there is some evidence that a diet low in saturated fat and high in omega-3, which is found in oily fish, may be helpful. You can also try taking fish oil supplements, but use fish body oil, not fish liver oil. Too much fish liver oil can cause you to have too much vitamin A, which can have side effects such as liver damage and hair loss.\n\nMake sure to get enough vitamin D and calcium. These important nutrients are needed for strong bones.\n\nCalcium is in dairy products, such as milk, cheese and yoghurts, as well as some green leafy vegetables.\n\nIn general, the best source of vitamin D is a healthy and safe amount of sunlight on bare skin. Because it isn’t possible to get enough vitamin D from sunlight all year round in the UK and because too much sunlight can be unhealthy for people with lupus, you might need to take vitamin D supplements.\n\nBe careful of any exclusion diets where large food groups are removed from the diet – you need all the nutrients that a well-balanced diet will provide. Consult a dietitian if you need more specific advice.\n\nSunlight\n\nToo much ultraviolet light from sunlight can cause a red rash across the cheeks and the bridge of the nose, often known as the butterfly rash. It can also sometimes cause problems with internal organs to flare up. Bear this in mind when choosing a holiday destination and discuss with your nurse specialist or dermatologist if in doubt.\n\nKeep out of the midday sun and wear a hat. Keep your skin covered or use sun cream of factor 50 or greater – which is available on prescription for people with lupus. You can also buy high-factor sun creams that include a tint and can be used as foundation make-up. Be careful when sitting under sun umbrellas on a paved area as the sunlight will be reflected onto your face.\n\nRaynaud’s phenomenon\n\nIf you experience Raynaud’s in your hands or feet, dress suitably for cold weather. Smoking is bad for the circulation and is likely to make symptoms worse. Regular exercise will improve your circulation.\n\nThere are also drugs that can be prescribed to people with Raynaud’s, to improve circulation to the fingers and toes. Talk to your doctor about these.\n\nLooking after your mental health\n\nBecause of the pain, fatigue and disruption to life, lupus can cause anxiety and depression.\n\nIt’s important to talk to someone you trust if you’re feeling down or worried. This could be a friend, relative or a healthcare professional. Versus Arthritis has a helpline if you’d like to speak to one of our trained advisors. Our helpline is open Monday to Friday from 9am to 8pm. Call free from the UK on 0800 5200 520.\n\nEven if it doesn’t affect the course of the condition, emotional stress can sometimes make lupus seem worse. It’s not always easy, but there are things we can all do to help manage stresses in our life. For example – you might want to try relaxation techniques such as meditation or mindfulness.\n\nYour doctor may be able to refer you to a psychologist who can help with coping strategies.\n\nTherapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may help. This is a talking therapy that can help you manage problems by changing the way you think and behave. It’s most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems.\n\nRegular exercise can improve feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nWork\n\nIf you have lupus, you may want to seek extra support at work. You could talk to your human resources department.\n\nThere might be equipment that your company could provide you with to make you more comfortable and help you do your job better. There may also be flexible working arrangements so you could work from home at least some of the week, or alter your shift patterns to avoid rush hours.\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 means that employers have a responsibility to remove barriers in the workplace for people with a disability and financial support is available to help them do this through the Access to Work scheme.\n\nYou may not think the term disability is appropriate for you, especially if your condition is well treated and under control a lot of the time. But it can apply to lupus, meaning you’re entitled to additional support to help you in your employment or education.\n\nThe Equality Act states that someone is disabled if they have a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term negative effect on their abilities to do normal everyday activities, if they weren’t taking any medication. It might help to ask yourself, if I wasn’t taking any medication, would I find it difficult to do things such as dress or wash myself, go shopping or go out to work on my own?\n\nMeeting others with lupus\n\nLupus is a difficult condition to live with and throws up many challenges, especially during periods of life when you may need more energy.\n\nMeeting others with lupus doesn’t necessarily remove these challenges but it can help you to cope with them by sharing your thoughts and concerns with someone who understands. You may have access to an education programme through a lupus nurse specialist or you may wish to meet others through patient support groups such as LUPUS UK.\n\nContraception\n\nIf you have lupus you should talk to your doctor about what form of contraception would be best for you. It can be important to avoid unplanned pregnancies if you have lupus, particularly when your condition is active and affecting your kidneys, if you’re on certain drugs, or if you have high blood pressure.\n\nYou might need to avoid contraceptive pills containing oestrogen as there is a very small risk that they can cause blood clots, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These blood clots can be dangerous if they break off and travel around the body, such as to the lungs.\n\nThis is more of a risk if you have antiphospholipid antibodies, which means you’re already at risk of blood clots.\n\nIt’s best to use contraceptive pills that contain only progesterone or only low-dose oestrogen, or consider barrier methods of contraception, such as condoms.\n\nIf you’re taking steroid treatment, you should avoid using the contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate, which has the trade name Depo-Provera. This is given by injection. It increases the risk of developing osteoporosis because it reduces the levels of oestrogen in your body, which is important for bone health.\n\nThe Mirena coil, which releases progesterone only, is often a recommended option for women with lupus.\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\nIn the past there has been concern about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increasing the risk of flare-ups of lupus. However, recent research has suggested that it’s relatively safe to use for short periods if symptoms of the menopause are severe and your lupus is otherwise well controlled. Make sure you speak to your rheumatologist if you are planning to start HRT.\n\nComplementary medicines\n\nThere’s no scientific evidence that suggests any form of complementary medicine helps to ease the symptoms of lupus. But if you have joint pain, acupuncture and massage may help. The pain relief may only last a short time to begin with, but repeated treatments may bring longer-lasting benefits. You may need to visit a private practitioner as the treatment may not be available on the NHS.\n\nGenerally speaking, complementary and alternative treatments are safe if you want to try them, but you should always discuss their use with your doctor before starting treatment. There are some risks associated with specific therapies.\n\nIn many cases, the risks associated with complementary and alternative treatments are more to do with the therapist than the therapy. This is why it’s important to go to a legally registered therapist, or one who has a set ethical code and is fully insured.\n\nIf you want to try a complementary or alternative treatment, it’s important to talk to your doctor first.\n\nI was diagnosed with discoid lupus over 20 years ago. It started with a spot on the tip of my nose and rashes and discolouration on my face, including my eyebrows.\n\nOne day a hairdresser asked if I’d ever had brain surgery because of the dark discoloration to my scalp. I also had indents on my fingertips. I was in my mid-twenties and didn’t understand what was happening.\n\nFor a time, I was successfully managing my discoid lupus, thanks to being prescribed hydroxychloroquine.\n\nBut four years later I started developing new symptoms. It began with night sweats, my bed clothes would be soaked. My sense of smell altered.\n\nI’d go to work, come home, feel so tired, and need to sleep for a couple of hours. I’d then wake up, have a shower and go to bed for the night. I couldn’t do anything in the evenings.\n\nI couldn’t sleep flat. I had pillows to prop me up. My GP sent me to A&E, and this led to a diagnosis of pleurisy – inflammation around the lungs.\n\nAfter being in hospital for a week I was off work and recovering at home. I was coming to the end of 10 days on ibuprofen when one day my feet were so painful I couldn’t put any weight on them. I then started to develop joint pains everywhere.\n\nThe slightest movement was extremely painful and I was really struggling.\n\nBecause of all these new symptoms I was referred to a rheumatology consultant, who confirmed I had developed SLE. This was a scary and bewildering time.\n\nI was tried on different kinds of immunosuppressive drugs, and I eventually settled on methotrexate. I was also prescribed steroid tablets as well as calcium with vitamin D. I was still taking the hydroxychloroquine.\n\nIt then came to light that I was developing issues with my kidneys and so I was put on a drug called mycophenolate mofetil, and I was taken off methotrexate. The real plus for me was this resolved my joint pains.\n\nAs I had been on hydroxychloroquine for a long time, last year my rheumatologist stopped prescribing me it due to concern about the risk to my eyes.\n\nI’ve always believed in the importance of good nutrition and exercise.\n\nI wasn’t going to allow my condition to stop me exercising. It’s so important to keep your body mobile and fit. Exercise doesn’t just help physically, but also emotionally and psychologically.\n\nWith lupus, there can be confusion, frustration and resentment. But you have to try to understand, accept and even embrace what’s happening, before you can move forward.\n\nMy advice would be keep on top of your medication, have a healthy lifestyle, try to understand your condition and make the most of the expertise, care and help available from your healthcare professionals. It’s important to have a good relationship with your clinicians, but also to take responsibility for yourself.\n\nI’m thankful that the management teams at my places of work have been understanding when issues of my lupus have arisen.\n\nGenerally, my lupus doesn’t stop me working or enjoying my hobbies.\n\nHave positivity and hope in your armoury. There is always hope, there is always help available, and you will have possibilities and options open to you.\n\nWhen I was 25 I went to see my family in the Caribbean. This was a trip I regularly made and loved going on. But it was soon clear things weren’t right. I was depressed, I’d lost my appetite, and my energy levels were low.\n\nMy relatives were concerned and took me to a hospital for some tests, but nothing was discovered.\n\nOne day we went to the cinema and I became very unwell. When the movie was finished, I couldn't put my feet on the ground, I was in excruciating pain. It was like pins and needles multiplied by 1,000 times. I had to be carried out of the cinema. It was scary.\n\nThis was back in 2007 and shortly after I got home to London, I went to my local hospital for further tests. This led to a diagnosis of lupus.\n\nI remember thinking, 'How can I get this? I'm young, fit and healthy'. It was a big adjustment for my family and I.\n\nA major problem over the years has been fatigue. I have to plan the week ahead. Fatigue is always there. Sometimes you don't have to be doing much and you get this overwhelming need to sit or lie down.\n\nI try to sleep and eat properly. I've cut out red meat and swapped it for fish, chicken and vegetables. I also drink lots of water.\n\nLast year I returned to work after some time off because of my lupus. I work for the Deaf and Disabled People’s Organisation (DDPO).\n\nI was quite anxious going back to work. I am confident and outgoing, but I found it quite daunting. My body is different from my pre-lupus days.\n\nThrough the Access to Work scheme I was provided with an adjustable chair and desk, and this made the world of difference.\n\nIt helps to be open about your condition, so you can get the support you need and are entitled to. Being open and talking about my condition has been a positive for me.\n\nI set myself SMART goals. This stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound. So I used this when thinking about what jobs to apply for, location of workplaces, hours I could work a week.\n\nIt’s important to push yourself a bit, but not too much so that it’s not possible.\n\nIt has taken me 13 years to reach this point; and it has not been easy. Returning to work has been a personal achievement for me, and for many returning to work is not an option due to their condition and the symptoms.\n\nI am still very much a work in progress and after 13 years I am still discovering the limitations of my body because of lupus and arthritis. If my journey gives one person hope that their situation can change, given time, I would be happy."
