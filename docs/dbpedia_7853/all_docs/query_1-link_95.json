        "text": "An estimated 1-6 out of every one hundred people could be sensitised to latex, but not everyone who is sensitised will have symptoms. ‘Sensitised’ means your immune system has produced antibodies to latex after coming into contact with it and these could cause symptoms if you come into contact with it again in future.\n\nThe number of people with latex allergy rose from the 1980s when latex gloves became widely used, particularly among healthcare professionals. To meet the rise in demand, the way latex gloves were made changed and high protein powdered gloves were commonly used. The powder in the gloves could absorb the latex proteins and become airborne which is likely to have caused a rise in allergies.\n\nLater, powder-free low-protein latex gloves became available, as well as latex-free alternatives, leading to a fall in latex allergy from the late 1990s. But if you have latex allergy you will still need to be careful to avoid latex.\n\nThe term for this more serious reaction is anaphylaxis (pronounced anna-fill-axis).\n\nMost healthcare professionals consider an allergic reaction to be anaphylaxis when it involves difficulty breathing or affects the heart rhythm or blood pressure. Any one or more of the ABC symptoms above may be present.\n\nIn extreme cases there could be a dramatic fall in blood pressure. The person may become weak and floppy and may have a sense of something terrible happening. Any of the ABC symptoms may lead to collapse and unconsciousness and, on rare occasions, can be fatal.\n\nYou may be offered skin prick tests and/or blood tests. You might also be offered a “challenge” test, where you are exposed to latex in strict conditions with medical supervision.\n\nWhat can mean you’re at higher risk?\n\nSome clues that you might be at higher risk of more serious reactions are:\n\nyou have already had a serious reaction, with any of the ‘ABC’ symptoms\n\nyou have asthma, especially if it is not well controlled\n\nyou have reacted to a tiny amount of latex.\n\nIf you have asthma and it is not well controlled, this could make an allergic reaction worse. Make sure you discuss this with your GP or allergy specialist and take any prescribed medicines.\n\nPatch testing is used to diagnose Type 4 allergy. This is where the health professional applies diluted rubber accelerator chemicals which are added to latex during processing (not usually the natural rubber latex protein itself) to your skin. The test is run over several days because, with a Type 4 reaction, there is a delay between contact with the rubber chemical and when the symptoms appear. This can vary from hours to several days.\n\nIf you have mild allergic symptoms, you may be prescribed antihistamine medicine that you take by mouth. If you are at higher risk of anaphylaxis, you may be prescribed adrenaline to use in an emergency.\n\nAdrenaline comes in pre-loaded adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) that are designed to be easy to use. Make sure you know how and when to use them. Ask your healthcare professional to show you how to use your specific brand of AAI. You can also find help on the manufacturer’s website where you can get a free trainer device to practise with.\n\nYou must carry two AAIs with you at all times, as you may need to use a second one if your symptoms don’t improve after five minutes or get worse.\n\nIf you have asthma, and it is not well controlled, this could make an allergic reaction worse. Make sure you discuss this with your GP or allergy specialist and take any prescribed medicines.\n\nSome people with Type 1 (immediate) latex allergy also react to certain fruits and vegetables, including banana, avocado, tomato, potato, kiwi, chestnut, lychee, papaya, passion fruit, fig, melon, mango, pineapple, peach and lettuce.\n\nThis is known as cross-reactivity, where the proteins in latex have a similar structure to the proteins in these foods. If you are allergic to any of these foods, you may also be allergic to latex, and vice versa.\n\nSymptoms normally affect the mouth after eating the food and are usually mild. They can include tingling or itching in the lips, tongue or throat. More serious reactions can occur, so discuss this with your doctor. You can also discuss which foods might cause you a problem.\n\nRaw potatoes can cause contact reactions when people with latex allergy peel potatoes, but cooked potato is not usually a problem.\n\nNot everyone with latex allergy has latex-food syndrome, and most people with latex-food syndrome will only react to a small number of foods.\n\nSome flu vaccines have a latex needle sheath. In the Green Book, the UK Health Security Agency says the risk for people with latex allergy is extremely small, but that if you have a history of serious allergy to latex (anaphylaxis) you should be offered an alternative latex-free vaccine that covers the same disease where possible.\n\nDiscuss this at your local surgery before having the flu vaccine and request one that does not have a latex needle sheath."
