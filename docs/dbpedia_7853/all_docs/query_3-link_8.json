        "text": "I started a Abomination Vaults campaign (as GM) to learn the Pathfinder 2 (Remaster) rules, and I like it well enough but something i did not count on is being kind of burnt out on dungeon exploration due to a year of alternating running and playing a 5E Rappan Athuk game.\n\nI don't want to abandon this game because the group messes and we are having fun, but I would like to get out of the dungeon for a while. I am looking for recommendations of a relatively short (3 or 4 session) adventure involving overland travel and exploration that I can insert into the AB campaign. The hook doesn't matter -- I can have the PCs need to go get something or whatever. But since I am still learning PF2E(R) I would prefer a published scenario for this \"first outing\". It doesn't have to by by Paizo but would preferably work well within the expected design constraints of PF2E(R).\n\nThanks.\n\nYou could look at \"Troubles in Otari\", which is a series of 3 adventures meant to be run right after the Beginner Box. The adventures are level 2, 3, and 4, and involve some wilderness travel.\n\nI haven't played or run them (yet), but I did run the Beginner Box and we rolled right into \"Abomination Vaults\" immediately afterwards. Now that the party's nearly level 4 and getting a bit burned out on the dungeon crawl, I've thought about interleaving the \"Troubles\" adventures with more AV exploration, just to break things up. I'll have to adjust the level of difficulty for them, but that's not too hard in PF2E.\n\nMy group is currently halfway through level 6 and a good chunk of the way through the Laboratory level. They haven’t complained about the dungeon crawl, but I’ve noticed they really dig into the side quests that have them spending time in town and interacting with the NPCs so I might also chop some bits out of Troubles in Otari to give them a bit more to mix it up.\n\nMy group is currently halfway through level 6 and a good chunk of the way through the Laboratory level.

I wanted to avoid the info dump of \"here are the 26 people whose names you need to know\" and was introducing them gradually, but probably without enough of a hook to make them memorable. I wrote up a cheat sheet for the players (locations in town, who they've met, main quest & side quest info, etc.) which will hopefully make Otari more interesting.\n\nWe also switched from playing 3 times a month down to 1 (the other GM was ready to run the last segment of our multi-year 5e campaign!), which made it hard to remember what was going on anyway. So we're going to wait until the 5e game is complete, then go back and play AV more regularly.\n\nI think I haven't done a great job highlighting the NPCs in town.

Two of the players went with connections to Wrin from their past to bring them to Otari at her request. I'd need to dig through my notes for the other 3, but they didn't really have major connections and were just passing through as things started.\n\nThe group started forming bonds with the townspeople since I encouraged them to use different vendors in town to sell stuff.\n\nThey actually were starting to become friends with Carmen Rajani prior to him stealing the sword. They hadn't met the mayor, so they were sympathetic to his complaints about the mayor's hold on power and some of his gripes made sense to them since they were handling all the town's problems without much connection to the mayor. It made his arson and theft of the sword that much better when they had to deal with it."
