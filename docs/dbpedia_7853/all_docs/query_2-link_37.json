        "text": "Patches are new or updated lines of code that determine how an operating system, platform, or application behaves. Patches are usually released as-needed to fix mistakes in code, improve the performance of existing features, or add new features to software. Patches are not newly compiled OSs, platforms, or applications—patches are always released as updates to existing software.\n\nPatches can also impact hardware—like when we released patches that altered memory management, created load fences, and trained branch predictor hardware in response to the Meltdown and Spectre attacks of 2018 that targeted microchips.\n\nBecause modifications like these are usually quicker to distribute than minor or major software releases, patches are regularly used as network security tools against cyber attacks, security breaches, and malware—vulnerabilities that are caused by emerging threats, outdated or missing patches, and system misconfigurations.\n\nBecause patching without a clearly defined patch management process can get messy.\n\nEnterprise IT environments can contain hundreds of systems operated by large teams—requiring thousands of security patches, bug fixes, and configuration changes. Even with a scanning tool, manually sifting through data files to identify systems, updates, and patches can be onerous.\n\nPatch management tools help generate clear reports on which systems are patched, which need patching, and which are noncompliant.\n\nLearn how Red Hat Satellite simplifies patch management\n\nImplementing a vigilant patch management policy takes planning, but patch management solutions can be paired with automation software to improve configuration and patch accuracy, reduce human error, and limit downtime.\n\nAutomation can drastically reduce the time IT teams spend on repetitive tasks, like identifying security risks, testing systems, and deploying patches across thousands of endpoints. Managing these time-consuming processes with reduced manual input frees up resources and enables teams to prioritize more proactive projects.\n\nFor example, a handful of Red Hat® Ansible® Automation Platform modules can automate portions of patching processes, including invoking HTTP patch methods, applying patches using the GNU patch tool, and applying (or reverting) all available system patches.\n\nFor many organizations, multiple servers work together for one customer, and these servers—since their functions are intertwined—must be rebooted in a specific order when patches are deployed. With Ansible Automation Platform, the Ansible Playbook ensures this happens correctly and consistently, so IT teams don’t have to."
