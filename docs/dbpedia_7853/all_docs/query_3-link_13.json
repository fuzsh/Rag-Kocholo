        "text": "Adventure is a word that is so often used, but does anyone REALLY know what it means?\n\nWhat is adventure? What does it mean to be adventurous?\n\nHeck, our blog name even has the word adventure in it! Does it always have to entail jumping off airplanes or diving through shipwrecks (both of which we’ve actually done)? Sure, by those standards you could say Tom and I are adventurous travelers.\n\nWe love going off to the unknown to experience something new. If we were standing by a waterfall and someone tells Tom to jump, without blinking an eye, he would. Our bucket list consists of cage diving with great white sharks, trekking through the Amazon Jungle, and bungee jumping off a bridge.\n\nBut, is that really what adventure is?\n\nI turned to my trusty friend Google and it gave me the definition of;\n\nAdventure Meaning\n\n“Engaging in an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity.”\n\nSure, that covered all our bases, but to us, adventure means so much more. Yes, we realize that our idea of adventure may be completely different from the person sitting next to us.\n\nWe might find that eating strange Filipino street food (like fried bugs and animal innards) is adventurous to us, but to the average local person, eating those is part of their everyday life.\n\nAlthough somewhat perplexing, I realized that it was part of the beauty of adventure. It is the fact that each person has a different opinion of what adventure is.\n\nTo us,\n\nAdventure is about…\n\ngoing out of your comfort zone to open yourself up to the experiences and beauty that life gives you, no matter what path you choose to go on.\n\nAdventure is all about taking each experience, regardless if you know the outcome or not and facing it head-on. It is about seeing the world from a different perspective, even if you’ve seen it a million times before.\n\nIt is choosing to see the beauty from the ordinary and finding ways on how to do it differently.\n\nEditor’s Note: Check out the Best Adventure Quotes of all time if you have a minute!\n\nSo just because we are jumping off 200m high gorges, bathing elephant and climbing volcanoes, does it mean that our adventure is better than everyone else’s? Absolutely not.\n\nTo us, adventure is stepping out of your comfort zone by doing something that you normally wouldn’t do. From helping out a random person to working up the courage to make friends with a stranger. It is about finding something that you love and pursuing it relentlessly.\n\nAdventure is Not…\n\nalways about going away to some exotic destination, but about finding excitement in both the new and the old.\n\nIt is exploring where you are and choosing to look at it differently. It’s about going on a road trip not because you want to reach a particular destination, but because the journey there would awesome! Adventure can be found in our everyday lives. In the little things. If only you choose to see it.\n\nRelated: Best Travel Books that you should read this year.\n\nAdventure Could Mean…\n\ntaking the selfless leap of raising a family.\n\nMassive recognition needs to be given to people entering the roller coaster of parenthood as they take on the role of becoming a mother and father, or sometimes even both. Both my sisters are raising families of their own and there isn’t a day that goes by where I am not proud of what they are doing.\n\nFor some people, getting married and having kids may be the biggest adventure that they will ever take on, but they do it none the less. They face it with nothing but determination and selflessness in order to provide the best for their families.\n\nAdventure Could Also Mean…\n\nworking your ass off to become successful in your job.\n\nWhether you are building a business or making a name for yourself in your company, if that is what you want in life, why should you not view it as an adventure? Some people put their blood, sweat and tears into a job where they constantly strive to build their skills on a daily basis.\n\nAs long as you see the bigger picture and are working towards a goal, pursuing your career could be your adventure. To us, growing this blog has been an adventure in itself. It has its ups and its downs, but every day, we wake up realizing how lucky we are to be able to pursue our passions in life.\n\nRead: How Starting an Adventure Blog Changed Our Life\n\nAdventure could mean spicing up your daily routine by trying out a new meal, ordering your coffee in a different way, or even something as simple as trying out a new look from time to time. In any situation, you can find different ways to be adventurous as you try something new and exciting.\n\nAdventure is about trying out new experiences, whether you will like it or not. I must admit that even though I have jumped off planes and have done more adventurous things than anyone in my family, I often get scared. Just the thought of jumping off high places make my palms sweat and my heart race.\n\nHowever, I do them anyways. Why? Because I don’t want to live my life in the safety of my comfort zone. I want to live a life that exhilarates and excites me.\n\nAt the End of the Day, Adventure is About…\n\nseizing opportunities and taking on life with nothing but passion, enthusiasm and excitement.\n\nOur point is that every day should be treated as an adventure. Whether you are hiking through the Sahara desert, growing an enterprise, or chasing your kids down your yard, choose to look every day with a sense of marvel and excitement.\n\nDare yourself to do something out of the ordinary and breakaway from your everyday routines.\n\nThis is what adventure means to us. Pursuing whatever you want out of life relentlessly and passionately. So to those that say adventure is only for those that hike through caves and trek through jungles, hear this. Adventure is a choice.\n\nLife is a big adventure and it is up to YOU to choose how you are going to live it.\n\nMore travel inspiration, advice and articles;\n\nThe Best Travel Gear\n\nInspired?
