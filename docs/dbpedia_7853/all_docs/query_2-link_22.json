        "text": "What is software patching? Definition\n\nSoftware patching is the process of incorporating a set of changes on a computer program or its supporting data to ensure security and smooth functioning. A software patch arrives as a temporary fix between full releases of a software package. Often, software patching is predominantly rolled out to fix security vulnerabilities and other bugs and is referred to as bug fixes or bug fixes. In a few cases, the patch is installed into an existing software for improving usability or performance.\n\nPatching is a part of software lifecycle management, and this involves planning and strategizing what goes out first and to which systems at a specified time. Sometimes, poorly designed software patches may introduce new problems and may disable a device or remove services that the user is no longer authorized to use.\n\nSoftware patching may be done for any of the following reasons:\n\nEnhancing the software (Upgrade)\n\nInstalling new drivers\n\nFixing a software bug (Bugfixing)\n\nAddressing the latest security vulnerabilities\n\nAddressing other software issues\n\nWhy is a Patch Manager Necessary?\n\nIn recent times, more and more companies have started to rely on their in-house IT infrastructure for business expansion. This helps save money and increase overall profitability in their new ventures. Since viruses and other malware threats are on the rise more, businesses are reinvestigating their security requirements to protect their information technology environment in a better way.\n\nSoftware is Insecure\n\nEnsuring safety on software platforms has become a matter of grave importance to many software service providers. As a result, software companies release patches to their users to secure their system vulnerabilities. Insights from the past indicate that every machine in a business environment needs to install the latest patches to stay protected. For instance, if one device in an IT environment is not patched, it can cause stability issues for the entire environment and possibly hinder usual processes from functioning normally.\n\nZero Day Attacks\n\nZero-day attacks rarely occur. There is a time gap between the identification of the vulnerability and the patch creation. Zero-day attacks can have a wide range of impacts on your online presence. Some of their effects include wasted time, degradation of your brand, and revenue loss. With proper patching practices, the attacks can be easily averted.\n\nUnsupported Software\n\nThese days, it is not uncommon for vendors to suddenly stop supporting software. This means that patches for discovered vulnerabilities will no longer be available. To stay protected, it is best to stop using this outdated software. Hackers often target users still using outdated software.\n\nKey Features & Benefits of ITarian Patch Manager\n\nITarian Patch Manager is an easy-to-use patch management tool that gives MSPs total control over the deployment of updates to OS and third-party applications on network endpoints.
