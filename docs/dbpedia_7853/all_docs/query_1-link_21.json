        "text": "Quick, convenient, and easy to use, wellness patches are the latest self-care products rising in popularity. While they've been around for a while, celebrity endorsements – such Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, being seen seen sporting a Nucalm Biosignal Processing Disc on the inside of her wrist this week – have resulted in a renewed spike in interest for the wellbeing tool. But what exactly is a wellness patch and how does it work?\n\nThe adhesive discs attach directly to your body and contain ingredients that are absorbed through the skin. Each is targeted to specific needs and results; whether you struggle to sleep, need to de-stress or re-energise, or are looking for a natural remedy to alleviate period pain or muscle ache, there’s likely to be a patch that will perform for you. And, using a tried-and-tested delivery system with the science to back it, the slow release of ingredients ensures that you’ll be drip-fed the benefits all day (or night), so they won’t wear off after an hour or two.\n\nMeghan's US-based NuCalm patch was developed with neuroscientists with the aim to improve sleep, moods, and ease daily stresses, so you feel revived and ready to take on the day. NuCalm works alongside an app, which plays sounds (or binaural beats) that claim to engage the mind. Essentially, the patch sends signals for your brain to relax and you can select your accompanying NuCalm session on the app, whether that's the Rescue, PowerNap or FlowState. It's arguably one of the more hi-tech wellness patches out there.\n\nCloser to home, the pharmacy Victoria Health stocks A-list acupuncturist Ross Barr’s patch range, and says that his products are consistent bestsellers. After being flagged on popular daytime TV show This Morning earlier this year, they continue to sell in the thousands. CBD brand Kloris was also surprised to find that its patches surpassed many of its other offerings, catapulting them into the position of hero product.\n\n“The patch popularity is continuing to grow. People just love the ease and directness of them and for anyone that’s confused with the dosing of , our takes that out of the equation,” explains Kim Smith, the co-founder of Kloris.\n\n“They’re not more or less effective than topicals or supplements, but they can be a beautiful complement to them,” continues Smith. “They can also be the most suitable option for some people because they are transdermally absorbed, meaning that they bypass the liver and digestive system.”\n\nOthers argue that patches are superior to other forms of supplements. Tests by Vitamin Injections London – which has a Vitamin B12, B Complex and D3 and ‘Clarity’ patch in its range – found that the ingredient absorption rate was 90 per cent, compared to around 15 per cent via oral supplements.\n\nHow do wellness patches work?\n\nThe process is twofold. “We use special pressure-sensitive matrix technology that incorporates functional active plant compounds into a plant-based adhesive polymer matrix,” explains Smith. “From here, the ingredients are continuously released into the skin and bloodstream within concentrated amounts.”\n\nBesides the transdermal benefits that aid the body, the aroma and what it does to the brain plays a huge part in the success of these stickers. Subtle Energies, who have three varieties of Inhalation patch – , and – stress that the essential oils that are released when applied are another reason they work so well. “They create a constant stream of chemical molecules, which in turn generates nerve impulses to the hypothalamus, activating and releasing hormones. These then impact the limbic region of the brain – which links to thinking, intellect and emotions – so just a simple inhalation can cause mental, physical and emotional changes,” explains Farida Irani, founder of Subtle Energies.\n\nHow do you use wellness patches?\n\nAnother win is that they’re effortless. Super discreet, they can be placed anywhere on the body depending on what they’re being used for. For example, Ross Barr’s Healing Patches are perfect for combating menstrual cramps when placed on the abdomen while Kloris’ Sleep Support Patches can be popped on the inside of your inner arm or wrist before bed.\n\nThey’re also travel-friendly and can be discreetly packed without any bulk. Plus there’s zero risk of leakages or spills which can make them a handy accompaniment when flying, particularly long haul when you need to factor in some shut-eye. Add in that they’re sweat- and waterproof too, so you don’t have to worry about showering or going in the water when you’re wearing them, and you can see why they’re all the rage.\n\nAre wearable patches sustainable?\n\nUnlike other single-use items that have got a bad reputation, these brands are working hard to be sustainable. Barr’s patches are biodegradable and come in recyclable (and minimal) packaging; Kloris uses a biodegradable natural copolymer adhesive and the packaging is made from a sugar beet cellulose alternative to plastic, which biodegrades in three-to-six months. For Subtle Energies it’s a work in progress. “While we use recyclable foil and non-toxic environmentally friendly skin adhesive, the challenge we face is the polymer required for sealing the aroma into the patch, but we are working with various companies to help meet these demands,” says Irani.\n\nFast becoming a respected and popular addition to aid your wellbeing, expect an influx of patches soon. However, just like supplements, there will be some that don’t fare as well or simply aren’t as reliable, depending on their delivery systems and ingredients list. For now though, these are the ones we rate as top notch, so get sticking…"
