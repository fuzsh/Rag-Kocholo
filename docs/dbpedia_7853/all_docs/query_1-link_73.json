        "text": "Rituximab is a targeted cancer drug. It is a treatment for certain types of lymphoma or leukaemia.\n\nYou might have the original rituximab drug called Mabthera. Or a biosimilar such as Truxima, Ruxience or Rixathon.\n\nA biosimilar is a very similar copy of the original drug, but it is not exactly the same. Biosimilars undergo strict testing to check they work just as well as the original drug.\n\nHow does rituximab work?\n\nRituximab is a type of targeted cancer drug called a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies target proteins on the surface of cancer cells. Rituximab targets a protein called CD20. CD20 is found on white blood cells called B cells.\n\nRituximab works by attaching itself to all the CD20 proteins it finds. Then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them.\n\nHow do you have rituximab ?\n\nYou might have rituximab on its own or with other cancer drugs (as part of a treatment regimen). You usually have it as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously). Or as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously).\n\nDrugs into your bloodstream\n\nYou might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:\n\ncentral line\n\nPICC line\n\nportacath\n\nIf you don't have a central line\n\nYou might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm. You have a new cannula each time you have treatment.\n\nAs an injection under your skin\n\nYou have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach.\n\nYou might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.\n\nWhen do you have rituximab?\n\nYou usually have rituximab as cycles of treatment. This means that you have the drug and then a rest to allow your body to recover. Each cycle varies depending on what type of cancer you have.\n\nRituximab can cause an allergic reaction. So before each dose you have paracetamol, a steroid and an antihistamine drug such as chlorphenamine (Piriton).\n\nFor the first cycle of rituximab, you have it as a drip into your bloodstream slowly over a few hours. This is to prevent an allergic reaction. Your nurse will increase how fast it goes in (rate) approximately every 30 minutes if you have no allergic reaction.\n\nYour next rituximab drip will usually go in quicker, but this will depend on how you got on with the first cycle.\n\nDepending on your cancer type, you may be able to have rituximab as a subcutaneous injection. You can only have rituximab as an injection if you’ve had at least one dose of rituximab into your bloodstream. And you didn't have any serious side effects whilst you had it.\n\nYour healthcare team will explain more about how you will have your treatment.\n\nTests\n\nYou have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.\n\nBefore treatment starts, you have a blood test to check for viruses such as Hepatitis B infection or Cytomegalovirus (CMV) . This is because infection with these viruses can become active again if you’ve had them in the past.\n\nWhat are the side effects of rituximab?\n\nSide effects can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having.\n\nWhen to contact your team\n\nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:\n\nyou have severe side effects\n\nyour side effects aren’t getting any better\n\nyour side effects are getting worse\n\nEarly treatment can help manage side effects better.\n\nWe haven't listed all the side effects here. Remember it is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects. But you might have some of them at the same time.\n\nYou usually have rituximab with chemotherapy drugs. The side effects listed below are from having rituximab on its own or in combination with chemotherapy drugs.\n\nCommon side effects\n\nThese side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:\n\nIncreased risk of getting an infection\n\nIncreased risk of getting an infection is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.\n\nInfections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.\n\nBruising and bleeding\n\nThis is due to a drop in the number of platelets in your blood. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).\n\nAn allergic reaction\n\nSome people have an allergic reaction to rituximab. This reaction is most likely to happen during treatment and when you first have the treatment. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include high temperature (fever), chills, feeling or being sick and difficulty breathing.\n\nYour nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. They will slow down or stop your drip for a while.\n\nGeneral swelling\n\nA build up of fluid (oedema) that may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.\n\nFeeling or being sick\n\nFeeling or being sick is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. It might help to avoid fatty or fried foods, eat small meals and snacks and take regular sips of water. Relaxation techniques might also help.\n\nIt is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treat it once it has started.\n\nHair loss\n\nYou could lose all your hair. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarms, legs and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.\n\nSkin changes\n\nSkin problems include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. Less commonly you might have a raised itchy rash on the skin also known as hives.\n\nRituximab can also cause a severe skin reaction, but this is rare. Symptoms usually start as tender red patches which leads to peeling or blistering of the skin. You might also feel feverish, and your eyes may be more sensitive to light. This is serious and could be life threatening\n\nSkin problems usually go back to normal when your treatment finishes. Let your doctor, nurse or pharmacist know of any skin changes.\n\nHeadaches\n\nTell your healthcare team if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.\n\nTiredness and weakness\n\nYou might feel very tired and as though you lack energy.\n\nVarious things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.\n\nOccasional side effects\n\nThese side effects happen in between 1 and 10 out of every 100 people (between 1 and 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:\n\nbreathlessness and looking pale due to a drop in red blood cells (anaemia)\n\nweight loss\n\nhigh blood sugar levels - symptoms might include feeling very thirsty, a dry mouth, passing urine very often, feeling tired, blurred vision or weight loss\n\nlow levels of calcium in your blood causing symptoms such as painful muscle spasms and cramps, twitching of muscles, numbness or tingling in feet and hands or around the mouth\n\nhigh levels of a substance (enzyme ) called LDH in the blood. You will have blood tests to check this\n\ndifficulty falling or staying sleeping (insomnia)\n\ndizziness\n\nfeeling agitated and anxious, rarely rituximab can also make you feel very low in mood or nervous\n\nunusual feelings of the skin – such as numbness, tingling, pricking, burning, a creeping skin feeling, or reduced sense of touch\n\nheart problems such as an abnormal heart rhythm and a heart attack\n\nlow blood pressure that can cause you to feel lightheaded or dizzy, sometimes this can happen when you stand up from sitting or lying down (orthostatic hypotension)\n\nhigh blood pressure that might cause headaches, confusion, vision problems or chest pain\n\neye problems such as dry or watery eyes or red, sore, itchy eyes (conjunctivitis)\n\nhearing changes such as ringing or buzzing in the ear (tinnitus) and ear pain\n\npain in different parts of your body such as your tummy (abdomen), muscles, joints, back, neck and where the cancer is\n\nstiffness in your muscles, arms or legs\n\nlung problems such as shortness of breath, tightening in the chest, chest pain or coughing. Rarely you might have asthma or low levels of oxygen\n\nconstipation\n\ndiarrhoea\n\ndifficulty swallowing\n\nmouth sores and ulcers\n\nindigestion symptoms include heartburn, bloating, and burping\n\nloss of appetite\n\na blocked, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing\n\nsore throat\n\nsweating and, or night sweats\n\ngenerally feeling unwell\n\nflushing - sudden reddening and warmth of the neck, upper chest and face\n\nseveral body parts (organs) stopping working\n\nRare side effects\n\nThese side effects happen in fewer than 1 in 100 people (fewer than 1%). You might have one or more of them. They include:\n\nchanges to the way your blood clots - too little clotting causing bleeding or too much clotting causing blood clots\n\na blood disorder where your red blood cells get destroyed faster than they can be made (haemolytic anaemia)\n\na condition where your bone marrow stops making your blood cells (aplastic anaemia)\n\nswollen lymph nodes\n\nswollen tummy (abdomen)\n\nchanges to the levels of chemicals in your body caused by a breakdown of tumour cells (tumour lysis syndrome) - you will have regular blood tests to check for this\n\ntaste changes\n\ninflammation of your blood vessels – symptoms can vary depending on which blood vessels are affected - general symptoms include feeling very tired, loss of appetite, weight loss, a high temperature, and aches and pains\n\na hole in your stomach or bowel (perforation) - contact your doctor straight away if you have pain, sever cramps, feeling tightness or bloating in the stomach area\n\nkidneys stopping working - you will have tests to check how well your kidneys work\n\nCoping with side effects\n\nWe have more information about side effects and tips on how to cope with them.\n\nWhat else do I need to know?\n\nOther medicines, foods and drinks\n\nCancer drugs can interact with medicines, herbal products, and some food and drinks. We are unable to list all the possible interactions that may happen. An example is grapefruit or grapefruit juice which can increase the side effects of certain drugs.\n\nTell your healthcare team about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies. Also let them know about any other medical conditions or allergies you may have.\n\nLoss of fertility\n\nIt is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.\n\nPregnancy and contraception\n\nThis treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or get someone pregnant while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards.\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment. Let them know straight away if you or your partner become pregnant while having treatment.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nDon’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 12 months afterwards. The drug may come through in the breast milk.\n\nTreatment for other conditions\n\nIf you are having tests or treatment for anything else, always mention your cancer treatment. For example, if you are visiting your dentist.\n\nImmunisations\n\nDon’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.\n\nIn the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and one of the shingles vaccines called Zostavax.\n\nYou can have:\n\nother vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual\n\nthe flu vaccine (as an injection)\n\nthe coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine - talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the best time to have it in relation to your cancer treatment\n\nMembers of your household who are aged 5 years or over are also able to have the COVID-19 vaccine. This is to help lower your risk of getting COVID-19 while having cancer treatment and until your immune system recovers from treatment.\n\nContact with others who have had immunisations - You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine. Sometimes people who have had the live shingles vaccine can get a shingles type rash. If this happens they should keep the area covered.\n\nIf your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray as this is a live vaccine. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.\n\nBabies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy.\n\nMore information about this treatment\n\nFor further information about this treatment and possible side effects go to the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) website. You can find the patient information leaflet on this website.\n\nYou can report any side effect you have to the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) as part of their Yellow Card Scheme."
