        "text": "Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, automates the process of patching managed nodes with both security-related updates and other types of updates.\n\nYou can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. (On Windows Server, application support is limited to updates for applications released by Microsoft.) You can use Patch Manager to install Service Packs on Windows nodes and perform minor version upgrades on Linux nodes. You can patch fleets of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type. This includes supported versions of several operating systems, as listed in Patch Manager prerequisites. You can scan instances to see only a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches. To get started with Patch Manager, open the Systems Manager console. In the navigation pane, choose Patch Manager.\n\nPatch baselines\n\nPatch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, in addition to optional lists of approved and rejected patches. When a patching operation runs, Patch Manager compares the patches currently applied to a managed node to those that should be applied according to the rules set up in the patch baseline. You can choose for Patch Manager to show you only a report of missing patches (a Scan operation), or you can choose for Patch Manager to automatically install all patches it find are missing from a managed node (a Scan and install operation).\n\nPatching operation methods\n\nPatch Manager currently offers four methods for running Scan and Scan and install operations:\n\nCompliance reporting\n\nAfter a Scan operation, you can use the Systems Manager console to view information about which of your managed nodes are out of patch compliance, and which patches are missing from each of those nodes. You can also generate patch compliance reports in .csv format that are sent to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket of your choice. You can generate one-time reports, or generate reports on a regular schedule. For a single managed node, reports include details of all patches for the node. For a report on all managed nodes, only a summary of how many patches are missing is provided. After a report is generated, you can use a tool like Amazon QuickSight to import and analyze the data. For more information, see Working with patch compliance reports.\n\nIntegrations\n\nPatch Manager integrates with the following other AWS services:"
