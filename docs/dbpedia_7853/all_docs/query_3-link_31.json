        "text": "Do you ever feel like the days blend into each other? A week passes and it’s hard to say what distinguished that week from any other week.\n\nMuch of adult life is like that. We stick to our routines — which is often wise, because routines make good choices automatic! — but when too much sameness stacks up, years disappear into memory sinkholes, measured only in the changing heights of children.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We don’t say “where did the time go?” when we remember where the time went.\n\nThat brings us to Tranquility by Tuesday Rule #6: One big adventure, one little adventure.\n\nEach week, aim to do two things that are memorable, and a little out of the ordinary.\n\nA “big adventure” could take 3-4 hours (think half a weekend day).\n\nA “little adventure” could take an hour or so (doable on a lunch break or a weekday evening).\n\nI find that two adventures a week is a good rhythm. It’s not enough to exhaust or bankrupt anyone, but it is enough to change the experience of time. As you look back on a week, you see that it wasn’t a week just like any other. It was the week you went to the orchid show, or went ice skating, or tubing, or tried that new ramen restaurant or… you get the picture.\n\nSo, as you are doing your Friday planning this week (see Rule #2: Plan on Friday) think about what big adventure and what little adventure you can plan into your week. Over the next 7-day Monday to Sunday week (Feb 27 to March 5) I’ll be going to see the Sleeping Beauty ballet and hopefully the Philadelphia Flower Show. I may also be speaking to middle school students, which would definitely be an adventure. What’s on the docket for you?\n\nIn other news: I am hosting Zoom office hours on Monday the 27th at 1:30 p.m. eastern for people doing the TBT Challenge. Check today’s email for the link!\n\nYou can also check out how one busy woman made space for more adventures in her life. Check out this “TBT In Real Life video” here.\n\nI am personally not feeling adventurous this morning as my 3-year-old was up for a while in the middle of the night. Fortunately, this hasn’t happened for a while. It reminded me how grateful I am to be moving into the stage of life when I can go to sleep at a set time and wake up to an alarm…"
