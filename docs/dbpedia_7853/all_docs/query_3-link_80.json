        "text": "About Us...\n\nOutdoor Adventures has been introducing Cougars to the outdoors since 2008. We offer opportunities to meet new people, see new places, and have new and diverse experiences. Whether you have hiked before or are just now becoming curious about outdoor recreation, our trips are for CSUSM students wanting to explore.\n\nOur goal for all Outdoor Adventure trips is to build group unity through a cooperative effort by appreciating a wilderness adventure and creating friendships. We challenge students and ourselves to break away from the day-to-day routines. You can choose from day trips, to weekend trips, and to extended week-long excursions that vary in outdoor activities.\n\nOur trips are led by CSUSM student guides, many of whom have acquired extensive wilderness training and enjoy sharing their love and avidity for the outdoors with others! So take the plunge and join in on the adventures!\n\nBe sure to follow us on Instagram @csusmrec for updates, information, and more.\n\nYou can also sign up to receive the Outdoor Adventure Newsletter for updates, trip reminders, job/volunteer opportunities, opportunity drawings, workshops, and more.\n\nAll University programs require student participants to follow standards of the CSUSM Student Code of Conduct in order to ensure a safe, respectful learning environment.\n\nAs the Policy states:\n\n“The University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff. Each member of the campus community should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, to be civil to one another and to others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.”\n\nFailure to abide by these standards could result in becoming ineligible to participate in Outdoor Adventure programs indefinitely.\n\nOutdoor Adventures + 8 Dimensions of Wellness\n\nThe eight dimensions of wellness are a holistic model for health and well-being that includes emotional, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, environmental, occupational, and financial wellness. Outdoor Adventures can support and enhance each of these dimensions of wellness in the following ways:\n\n1. Emotional Wellness\n\nParticipating in outdoor activities can improve emotional wellness by reducing stress and anxiety, promoting relaxation, and increasing feelings of joy and satisfaction.\n\n2. Intellectual Wellness\n\nExploring the outdoors can enhance intellectual wellness by promoting curiosity and learning about nature, history, and culture, and engaging in critical thinking and problem-solving.\n\n3. Physical Wellness\n\nOutdoor activities promote physical wellness by providing opportunities for exercise, improving cardiovascular health, and promoting physical strength, endurance, and flexibility.\n\n4. Social Wellness\n\nParticipating in outdoor programming can improve social wellness by building relationships and connections with peers and leaders, fostering a sense of community, and promoting teamwork and collaboration.\n\n5. Spiritual Wellness\n\nEngaging with nature and outdoor spaces can promote spiritual wellness by fostering a sense of awe, wonder, and appreciation for the natural world, and promoting a connection with something greater than oneself.\n\n6. Environmental Wellness\n\nOutdoor Adventures can promote environmental wellness by fostering an appreciation for the natural world, promoting sustainable practices, and educating participants about environmental conservation and preservation. See Leave No Trace Principles below.\n\n7. Occupational Wellness\n\nParticipating in outdoor activities can promote occupational wellness by providing opportunities for career exploration in fields such as outdoor education, recreation, and conservation.\n\n8. Financial Wellness\n\nOutdoor Adventures provides subsidized experiences which can promote financial wellness by providing affordable opportunities for outdoor exploration and adventure, reducing financial stress, and promoting financial literacy and responsibility.\n\nLearning Outcomes for Students Who Participate in an Outdoor Adventure Trip:\n\nDevelop skills for outdoor activities\n\nStudents will learn basic skills for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, rock climbing, and kayaking. They will learn how to use appropriate gear and equipment, develop techniques for safety, and plan a trip on their own.\n\nCultivate environmental awareness\n\nStudents will gain a deeper understanding of environmental issues and sustainability. They will learn about the impact of human activities on natural resources and ecosystems, and explore ways to minimize their ecological footprint while enjoying outdoor activities.\n\nPromote physical fitness and well-being\n\nStudents will engage in physical activities that promote health and well-being, such as hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, and more.\n\nEnhance personal growth and self-awareness\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to challenge themselves and step outside their comfort zones. They will learn about their own strengths and weaknesses, and develop self-confidence and resilience through outdoor participation.\n\nFoster appreciation for cultural diversity\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds and learn about different cultures and perspectives. They will develop respect for cultural differences and build empathy and understanding through shared outdoor experiences.\n\nLeave No Trace Principles"
