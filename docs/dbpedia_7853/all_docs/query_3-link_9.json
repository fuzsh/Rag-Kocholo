        "text": "“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”\n\n-Mark Twain\n\n“Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live.”\n\n– Norman Cousins\n\nWhen I was 19 years old, I wanted to thru-paddle the Everglades for 125 miles of some of the most backcountry swampland the U.S. had to offer. Well, that’s an understatement. I had to do it. I don’t know why – I just felt this calling. My parents were worried I would drown or be eaten by crocodiles, and I had similar concerns myself. I could have easily abandoned the idea and instead gone fishing or... more insidious, played video games for the day. But, through some inspiration from a muse or through fate itself, I did it. Before I left, I wrote in my journal:\n\n\"Now the World is calling... and I must go to wander and explore. Mom is of course worried. So is Dad. They have reason; more experienced people than us have died in the wilderness. But it's something I must do, and risks are a part of life. What is man making himself by removing risks and dangers? It's not that I haven't assessed the risks, either, or that I don't care about them. With proper planning and preparation they aren't that great. But also, within reason, I would rather live fast than die slow.\"\n\nIt happened again a year later - I worked at a remote field station in Arctic Alaska and decided I needed to ride my bike back to Anchorage instead of getting a ride in by motorized vehicle.\n\nAnother year went by, and it happened again. I needed to see the rest of the Continental U.S. I needed to ride my bike across the country. Having had enough solo-riding from my Alaskan trip, I decided to go with a group of young people... yet this time, my parents were doubly worried. A fellow student and friend had been killed the year before riding across the country. Another extraordinary girl was killed the week before my trip began. Why do something so risky?\n\nIn my mind there were two reasons.\n\nThe first was that a friend of mine had also been killed one night walking down Thayer Street, the main street in campus. There are risks in everything we do in this world, from walking down the street, to driving in a car, to riding your bike across the country. I wasn't going to stop walking down main street on campus because of Avi's death, and I wasn't going to give up a calling because of Paige's.\n\nThe second reason was written in my journal as follows:\n\n\"I want everyone to know that I am well aware that I could die doing this. I want them to also know that I would be dead inside if I didn't.\""
