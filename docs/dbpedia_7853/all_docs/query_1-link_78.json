        "text": "Dermaplaning is an easy, quick process that involves shaving vellus hair on your face with a specially designed dermaplaning razor.\n\nPeach fuzz, or as the pros know it, vellus hair, is the ultra-fine, downy hair that grows on your face.\n\nVellus hair can become denser with age or as a result of conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. For many people, peach fuzz can cause insecurity and low self-esteem.\n\nYou’ve probably come across the term “dermaplaning.” If you dream of baby-smooth, hairless skin, this quick and noninvasive procedure may sound like a dream come true — however, dermaplaning isn’t always as dreamy as it sounds.\n\nIn fact, if it’s performed on the wrong type of skin by an inexperienced hand, it can lead to some serious horror stories.\n\nDermaplaning is a procedure in which a single razor blade is used to remove the top layer of skin. The procedure is quick, relatively painless, and involves little to no recovery time.\n\nWhile the removal of peach fuzz is one of the main draws of dermaplaning, it also has other benefits.\n\n“There is a big misconception about dermaplaning, as people think it’s a hair removal treatment,” Maja Swierczynska, the lead aesthetic practitioner in London’s STORY clinic and dermaplaning trainer at Harley Academy, tells us. “Dermaplaning is actually a superficial exfoliation treatment, and a removal of vellus hair is a positive side effect of this treatment.”\n\nAs an exfoliation treatment, dermaplaning can also help to remove dead skin, increase brightness, and improve skin texture.\n\nThe benefits of dermaplaning\n\nYour makeup will look smoother and more natural.\n\nIt can make your skin care products more effective.\n\nThe procedure can refresh and brighten your skin’s appearance.\n\nYou can put on makeup and go about your day within 24 hours after treatment.\n\nThe downsides of dermaplaning\n\nThere are a range of common side effects, including breakouts, risk of infection, redness or discoloration, and irritation.\n\nThe procedure can be costly.\n\nThe procedure only affects the top layers of your skin, so it isn’t as effective as more intensive exfoliation treatments.\n\nAt first glance, dermaplaning looks relatively simple. Most of us shave our legs at home. So, why not shave our faces at home, too?\n\nWhile dermaplaning may look like something you could do at home, most professionals recommend against it.\n\n“In my opinion, one of the biggest dangers is that dermaplaning blades became available online,” Swierczynska says. “Without knowing the correct technique, such as the right angle and how you should hold the blade, you can easily cut the skin and this can lead to infection.”\n\nNot only can self-dermaplaning be dangerous, it can also be less effective.\n\nIn a clinic, dermaplaning can be paired with another treatment, Swierczynska explains, such as a skin peel, LED light therapy, or a HydraFacial, which will leave you with much more noticeable results.\n\nAs with any exfoliating treatment, dermaplaning can result in some temporary side effects.\n\nBreakouts\n\nIf you are prone to acne, dermaplaning can result in a fresh breakout. You can reduce your chances of a breakout by avoiding active acne when dermaplaning. As Swierczynska says, “Dermaplaning shouldn’t be performed on active acne, as it can easily spread the bacteria and cause another flare-up.”\n\nBecause dermaplaning removes a layer of skin, it can leave your face more exposed.\n\nIf your dermaplaning blade contains any bacteria or you have bacteria on your hands, you may be more likely to experience a breakout after your treatment.\n\nIrritation\n\nDermaplaning can also cause irritation to your skin. After all, the procedure involves scraping a blade across your skin.\n\nFor 1 or 2 days after your dermaplaning session, you may feel that your skin is red, discolored, or itchy.\n\nDryness\n\nIt is perfectly normal for your skin to feel dry or even a little flaky after an exfoliating treatment like dermaplaning.\n\nUltimately, the procedure should improve skin dryness by lifting away any dead skin cells. However, in the first few days, the exfoliation may leave your face feeling tight and dry.\n\nMinor cuts\n\nA more intensive dermaplaning session may leave you with a few tiny cuts or grazes on your skin, especially if you have uneven skin texture.\n\nHowever, if you get the treatment from a professional, any cuts should be incredibly small and should heal fully without leaving any marks behind.\n\nWhile there are some side effects to dermaplaning that are normal and temporary, there are other potential side effects that can be more damaging — especially when the treatment goes wrong.\n\nAs Nicola Russell, celebrity facialist and owner of Skin Geek clinic, tells us, there is always a low risk that the procedure can go wrong — even if you visit a professional. “Like most treatments, there are always some risks involved if it’s not carried out by a trained professional or if you aren’t an ideal candidate for it,” she says.\n\nCertain people, it turns out, aren’t good candidates for the treatment.\n\nIf you have an active skin condition such as acne, for instance, the treatment may end up spreading bacteria around your face, resulting in irritation and breakouts.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin or a recent sunburn, you may find yourself with more severe side effects. The treatment is also unsuitable for people who have taken Accutane or isotretinoin within the last 6 months.\n\nWhen dermaplaning goes wrong, Russell explains, “you may be left with nicks, scratches or deeper cuts, and there is always the risk of infection and possible scarring. If the skin has been overworked, then your skin’s barrier will be impaired and you will be left red, inflamed, and sensitive, and many skin care products will irritate it.”\n\nOther problems can occur, too.\n\nSwierczynska explains that the dermaplane scalpel can end up removing hair from your hairline or eyebrows if the practitioner is inexperienced or if you perform the procedure at home. She also says that it’s vital to avoid using a hairdryer after the treatment, as your forehead will be more prone to burns.\n\nIn some rare cases, a dermaplaning treatment can turn into a nightmare. Swierczynska recalls one client who tried to perform the treatment on herself at home.\n\n“This patient decided to use dermaplaning to remove her facial moles,” she says. “She ended up in [the emergency room] with an open bleeding wound on her cheek and a few stitches afterwards.”\n\nDermaplaning horror stories can also occur in clinics. YouTuber Taylor Wynn got the treatment in 2019 and was left with deep scratches and cuts all over her face.\n\nIn a video, she explained, “I got dermaplaning done today by a professional who, like, Edward Scissorhanded my whole face and neck.”\n\nThroughout the procedure, Wynn felt blood dripping down her face several times. “She put on stuff afterwards and it was stinging,” she went on. “I just hope it’s not going to scar.”\n\nBeauty journalist Heather Muir Maffei also had a bad experience with dermaplaning in 2019. In an Instagram post, she showed that her skin was covered in red marks.\n\nShe wrote, “Numerous times throughout this facial, I felt uncomfortable, which I verbally expressed as burning, stinging, and on fire. I was told I must be sensitive… When I went to the bathroom to change, I saw my skin — red, raw, and with a beating sensation — I knew something was wrong.”\n\nMaffei’s horror story has a happy ending.\n\n“Skin heals — fast!” she wrote. She was prescribed a wound-healing cream and after 2 weeks, her skin was almost back to normal.\n\nDermaplaning can be a wonderful exfoliating treatment that can rejuvenate and refresh your skin, while simultaneously removing that annoying, fluffy peach fuzz.\n\nHowever, like all skin treatments, there’s always a risk that things can go wrong.\n\nAvoid your own dermaplaning horror story by seeking out a trained professional for the procedure, preparing your skin, and doing your research.\n\nMeg Walters is a writer and actor from London.
