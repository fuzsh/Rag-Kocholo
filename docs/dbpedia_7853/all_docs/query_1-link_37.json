        "text": "Oral health and dementia\n\nAs a person's dementia progresses, they can get more confused and struggle with daily tasks. This is because they may see things differently and have problems understanding what’s in front of them.\n\nWhen it comes to oral health, a person with dementia can:\n\nforget their usual mouth care routine\n\nstruggle to do practical tasks in the right order\n\nhave difficulty holding a toothbrush\n\nmisjudge distances, such as applying toothpaste onto a brush\n\nshow no interest in mouth care, due to low mood, tiredness or apathy\n\nforget about dental appointments\n\nhave trouble accepting dental treatment\n\nhave difficulty communicating pain, discomfort, or distress.\n\nThese challenges will vary from person to person, and at different stages of their condition.\n\nIn general, as a person’s dementia symptoms get worse over time, they will need more support with their mouth care.\n\nCommon mouth care problems\n\nMany people with dementia develop problems with their teeth and gums.\n\nThese need to be looked after properly to prevent them getting worse. If not, they can often lead to difficulties with chewing and swallowing. They can also be very painful.\n\nTooth decay\n\nThis is a common reason for losing teeth. The best way to prevent it is regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste and limiting sugary foods.\n\nTooth wear and damage\n\nThis can lead to the tooth becoming sensitive, causing pain when eating very hot, cold, sweet or sour foods.\n\nGum disease\n\nThis can cause the gum to become inflamed, making it red and sore. There are two main stages of gum disease – gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\nDry mouth\n\nThis can be uncomfortable and make it harder to speak, chew or swallow. When it’s severe, the surface of the tongue can be sore and cracked. It can also lead to fungal infections.\n\nHow to tell if a person with dementia has mouth care problems\n\nEating less\n\nProblems with teeth or other parts of the mouth can make it difficult to eat properly. Over time, a person eating less than they need to loses weight and becomes malnourished.\n\nIf you are concerned, ask the person if they have any mouth pain or trouble swallowing. If they can’t understand your question, you can:\n\nuse non-verbal gestures, such as pointing to your teeth\n\nobserve them for signs of dental distress, such as wincing when brushing\n\noffer them softer, blended food to check their general appetite\n\ncheck their mouth for any unusual signs, such as swellings or bleeding.\n\nIf you have concerns, speak to a dentist.\n\nA person who wears dentures can also have difficulty eating if their dentures aren’t fitted properly, or they are the wrong size for their mouth.\n\nIdentifying toothache and other mouth pain\n\nIn the later stage of dementia a person may have difficulty understanding their pain or asking for help.\n\nThis means they may not be able to tell when they have a toothache, or take steps to resolve it, such as taking painkillers or seeing a dentist.\n\nIt’s important to be on the lookout for signs of pain and distress, such as:\n\nstruggling to eat food or refusing it (particularly hard foods or very hot or cold foods)\n\nfrequently touching their face or mouth\n\na swollen face\n\nleaving their dentures out\n\nbecoming increasingly restless, moaning or shouting\n\nhaving disturbed sleep\n\nstruggling to take part in daily activities\n\nrefusing attempts to help them with their mouth care\n\nbehaving aggressively (particularly towards you or someone else caring for them).\n\nThese changes in behaviour can be distressing. However, it’s important not to dismiss them as part of the person’s dementia.\n\nIt could be a sign that they are in pain and need help. If the person you are caring for is having any of these problems, check their mouth for signs of pain and arrange a visit to the dentist if necessary.\n\nIt can be useful to keep a note of when these signs first started, how long they’ve lasted for, and if painkillers have helped. This can help the dentist to identify the problem.\n\nMouth infections\n\nGerms can get easily into the mouth. Most are harmless so long as the mouth is cleaned and rinsed regularly. However, when they get into a cavity or sore gums, they can cause a tooth infection.\n\nA dental abscess is a pocket of bacteria and pus that forms inside the gums and can be very painful if it isn’t treated with antibiotics. A person with dementia may feel this pain and become very distressed yet struggle to tell others what the problem is.\n\nIf you are caring for a person who needs assistance with mouth care, it is important to check for any signs of infection.\n\nYou can check that the tongue, cheeks, gums and the roof of the mouth all look a normal, healthy colour.\n\nSeek help from a dentist or a health professional if you see any of these signs:\n\nred, swollen or bleeding gums that last for more than a few days\n\ncracked, red, sore or crusty corners of the mouth\n\nswelling around the mouth\n\nred or creamy white patches anywhere in the mouth, particularly on the tongue.\n\nIf the person wears dentures, check the area where they would normally fit.\n\nDry mouth\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult to know if a person with dementia has a dry mouth, especially if they have communication difficulties.\n\nHowever, you may be able to see some of the signs during everyday mouth care, such as:\n\ndry and cracked lips\n\na stickiness on the cheeks or tongue\n\nfood debris in the mouth\n\ndried saliva on the tongue or palette\n\nred, sore or swollen gums around a denture, which can cause it to become loose.\n\nA dry mouth can happen for a number of reasons:\n\ndehydration\n\nthrush in the mouth (a fungal infection)\n\nside effects of many medicines\n\nanxiety\n\ncancer therapies, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy\n\nbreathing more through the mouth than the nose, such as when congested or using oxygen therapy.\n\nIf a person has a dry mouth, first check to see if they are drinking normally and are well-hydrated. It’s common for people with dementia to not drink as much as they need to.\n\nIf dry mouth is being caused by a thrush infection, the person will have red and white patches in their mouth. It can cause an unpleasant taste and soreness.\n\nIt can normally be treated effectively with medication, which can either be bought from a pharmacist or prescribed by a GP.\n\nIf they are taking any medicines, check the leaflets that come with them to see if they can cause dry mouth as a side effect.\n\nCertain medicines used to treat high blood pressure, overactive bladder, stomach problems, pain, allergies, or mental health problems can cause dry mouth – particularly when someone is taking more than one of them.\n\nA GP or pharmacist may recommend switching to an alternative medicine if one is available.\n\nRelieving a dry mouth\n\nThere are several ways that a person with dementia can reduce discomfort caused by dry mouth, including:\n\nsipping water frequently throughout the day to keep their mouth moist\n\nchewing sugar-free sweets or gum, if this is safe and comfortable\n\nusing dry mouth products (a gel, liquid spray or lozenges) to help lubricate their mouth. These products can either be prescribed by a dentist or purchased from a high street pharmacy\n\nlip balm can make dry lips more comfortable.\n\nBrushing teeth regularly helps to prevent the tooth decay that can speed up when there is much less saliva in the mouth.\n\nIf the person has memory problems, they may need to be reminded to do these things throughout the day."
