The guide includes promising practices, case studies and suggested resources in each of 15 content areas — all with a focus on expanding the quality and quantity of out-of-school science programming.\n\nThe Adventure Central after-school program was also highlighted on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Youth.Gov site as part of their effort to provide a one-stop shop for information about federal youth programs and initiatives.\n\nAdventure Central Scholarly Output Compilation"
