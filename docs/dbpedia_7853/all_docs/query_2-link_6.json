        "text": "Hi, there! My name is Patch Adams and I’m a 75-year old clown who is also a physician. In medical school (1967-71) I realized that the way medicine was practiced was wrong. So, I designed a hospital addressing some of the major problems in our health care delivery. The staff of this hospital would live together in a communal eco-village and artist colony, and everyone would make the same salary: $300 / month. This hospital would charge no money, carry no malpractice, and accept no medical insurance. A medical practitioner could spend as much time as he or she would want with a patient and be open to all kinds of healing.\n\nAt 18, I decided to be 6 qualities: happy, funny, loving, cooperative, creative, and thoughtful. These 6 qualities allow me to be an instrument for peace, justice, and care for all people and nature. This is why I am a clown. Flame On!\n\nAre you looking to create wild interest in your cause?
