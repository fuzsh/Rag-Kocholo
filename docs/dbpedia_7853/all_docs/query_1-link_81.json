        "text": "After emerging from this tricky period relatively unscathed, Arsenal must be tempted to think they've made it through the most difficult patch of the season. This international break offers an oasis of opportunity for rest and recuperation. However, the indications are that there will be no let-up when the Gunners return to action in late November.\n\nWhile Hector Bellerin, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey are expected to return to bolster the squad for the game against West Brom on Nov. 21. The likes of Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky and Danny Welbeck will remain sidelined. The midfield may begin to look healthier, but the attack will still be enormously reliant on the likes of Alexis and Olivier Giroud. With the Frenchman up top, Arsenal look considerably one-paced. The return of Walcott and Welbeck can not come soon enough.\n\nIdeally, they'd be available for the frantic festive period. In the week of Christmas, Arsenal host current league leaders Manchester City before travelling to Ronald Koeman's impressive Southampton. It promises to be a defining period for Wenger's men. With the games coming thick and fast, Wenger will need to use his squad intelligently to prevent further injuries.\n\nThe fact that the City game takes place at the Emirates Stadium is typical of the scheduling of the first half of Arsenal's season. By the time New Year's Day rolls around, Arsenal will have played City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham at home. Trips to Southampton and Chelsea will be the only occasionns on which they've travelled to face one of the Premier League's supposed bigger clubs.\n\nThat means that Arsenal will face five of their toughest away games in the second half of the Premier League season. Although their record has recently improved in such encounters -- Arsenal have won away against both City and United in this calendar year -- they have had a tendency to struggle when visiting elite opposition. The recent 5-1 humbling at Bayern Munich suggests that habit may be returning.\n\nThrow in the possibility of a sustained Europa League campaign, and it becomes clear that Arsenal's calendar offers little reprieve. For a squad as fragile as theirs, it's a daunting proposition.\n\nWhile the Gunners have recovered impressively from a slow start to keep up with league leaders Manchester City, it will take an even greater effort to maintain that pace after Christmas.\n\nArsenal fans know better than most that the Premier League title race is a marathon, not a sprint. Several times in the past few years, Wenger's team have produced an excellent half season only to be let down by the remainder. That can not happen this time. If Arsenal want to end the long wait for a Premier League title, they will need to show some serious stamina. Arsenal have made it through a tricky patch, but there are arguably tougher trials ahead."
