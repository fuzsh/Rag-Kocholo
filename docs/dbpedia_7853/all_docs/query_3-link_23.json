        "text": "Wizarding up ideas for adventures is one of my favourite things to do. I find it enjoyable, exciting, but also easy. I’m surprised how often people tell me that they really want to do an adventure but don’t know what to do.\n\nHopefully this walk-through of the way I come up with ideas might get your own adventure cogs whirring…\n\nCycling round the world: I’d done some test trips already: 6 days cycling round Scotland and down to Yorkshire (exhausting!), the spectacular Karakoram Highway, Mexico to Panama and Buenos Aires to Lima.\n\nSo I knew that I wanted to do more cycle touring. I accepted that I’d need to do it alone (though I kept scrabbling around to find a companion through nervousness about being lonely). And I was ready to go bigger than I had done before.\n\nFrom there the idea just spiralled, really: “maybe I could cycle to India? If I get to India I might as well carry on to Australia. If I get to Australia I’m halfway around the planet; I might as well keep going. If I’m going to cycle round the world I want to do the job ‘properly’: I should ride the length of the Earth’s three main landmasses.” [There’s a map of my eventual route here.]\n\nI’ll summarise this technique as “Test a small idea, then grow it to the limits of your enthusiasm (and budget and time). Go big to avoid future regrets.”\n\nThe Marathon des Sables: This was my brother’s suggestion. He thought it would be a useful chat-up line. I was looking for a challenge and the self-proclaimed tag of the “toughest race on Earth” piqued my curiosity and ego and overcame the stonking price tag. “Adventure as challenge and pub-boasting-fodder.”\n\nOn foot through India: I’d never been to India, I’d never done a long walking journey. So far, so easy. But, where to go?! There are a million lifetimes’ adventures to be had in India. I could have become paralysed by choice. I narrowed it down quickly by the Goldilocks Method: not too far for the time I had available, not too short, just right. After that I only had to pick a suitable river to follow (following a river is always a good idea for a journey) and began. “Adventure through a process of elimination.”\n\nThe South Pole: this is the biggest project I have been involved in that wasn’t ‘my’ baby. It is also the only one that I did not see through to completion. I suspect there’s a strong link between those two things… This idea began with dreams of Antarctica having read loads of polar literature. I knew that I did not have the credentials or the type of character needed to raise the enormous sponsorship sums required for a polar expedition.\n\nSo I began looking for an existing project I could get involved with, initially via the RGS. Because of my four-year bike trip I began making friends with lots of different folk in the adventure ‘scene’, including Ben Saunders who was plotting an audacious return journey to the South Pole. Long story short: I partnered up with Ben, we spent 5 years futilely chasing sponsorship, I quit the team, Ben found the cash and a new partner and headed off down South. 😀 “Adventure through joining someone else’s idea.”\n\nIceland: Pick up a map and dive in. ‘Read’ it like a book, searching for patterns, oddities, round trips, beginnings and endings, mysteries and uncertainties. Look for where you have never been; perhaps even look where nobody has ever been. Look for where people have been and told their tales, then tweak their story to create your own. Look, look, look and you’ll find ideas galore.\n\nThe idea of crossing Iceland came from a map: oh look, a conical-shaped country of manageable size. What if I started at one shore, went up to the high land in the middle, then down to the other side? Beginning and finishing an adventure at the sea is always satisfying.\n\nOnce I had the framework for the trip I could fill in the details according to my whims: why not packraft the ‘downhill’ section? Why not carry a month’s food supply to make it all pleasantly self-contained? “Pick up a map and start scheming.”\n\nRowing the Atlantic: In a similar vein to a polar project, I knew that I didn’t have the logistical gumption to ever put together an Atlantic row by myself. Therefore when I received an email out of the blue asking if I fancied joining an up-and-running expedition that was due to depart mere weeks from now, I knew this would be my only chance to row an ocean. I was more than happy to join someone else’s project and just do what I was told to get the job done. So I said, “yes” even though I was busy etc. etc. “Seize opportunities at the expense of regrets, even when they are inconvenient or pricey.”\n\nThe Empty Quarter desert: An attempt to replicate a spellbinding story I’d read in a book. Inspired by Wilfred Thesiger, I had dreamed of this trip for years. But the logistics, faff, and expense of dealing with camels kept putting me off. So in the end I accepted my limitations and went for the dumb human-camel approach. “Pragmatic compromise based on a hero’s wonderful journey.”\n\nBusking through Spain: Another trip inspired by a book that I loved. But this time with zero compromise on the initial premise. This trip was seeking a different set of challenges to the usual adventures I went on. “Ask what living adventurously means to you these days. Go and do that.”\n\nWalking around the M25: I hate the M25. Everyone does. Its humdrum tedium is the very antithesis of ‘adventure’. And yet, at the time, I was becoming increasingly convinced that ‘adventure’ was more about your attitude than your latitude. In which case, could I find adventure in the least-adventurous place I knew? “Adventure via hypothesis. Imagine how something not obvious might pan out.”\n\nPackrafting to Muckle Flugga: I was listening to Test Match Special on the radio when the lighthouse keeper at Muckle Flugga was interviewed. I had never heard of Muckle Flugga. I learned that this was the northernmost tip of the British Isles. Somewhere extraordinary in my own country that I had never even heard of? I was hooked. “Adventure hatched through curiosity. Look close to home for newness, surprise, and a romantic-feeling quest.”\n\nSuilven: My favourite mountain –a stunning, jagged shark fin– that I had often looked at but never got round to climbing. A great friend who was always up for adventure if I came up with the ideas and sorted the boring logistics. And then just a greedy feast like when you put chocolate ice cream on top of strawberry on top of raspberry: pile all my favourite means of transport on top of each other and I was left with a pleasing-sounding mission. To get from central London to a tent on top of my favourite mountain by sleeper train, bicycle, packraft and boot. Perfect! “Think of the places you love, the people you love, the adventures you love. Mix them together and make them happen.”\n\nI hope that these examples answer Anne’s question about how I make the next adventure challenge me more than the previous one. If I was a specialist I would need to search for something higher, harder and faster every time. But because I am a generalist, I am able to make the next adventure more challenging by making it differently challenging. That is really important for keeping adventure fresh for me."
