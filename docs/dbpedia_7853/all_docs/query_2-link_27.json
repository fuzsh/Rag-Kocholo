        "text": "Centralized visibility over all the systems\n\nThe first step to achieving a seamless patch management workflow is to have centralized visibility over all the systems in the network. This will enable the admins to understand the patching status of the systems and thus prioritize the missing patches or patches with higher severity (critical or important) to the systems.\n\nScheduling deployments without affecting employee productivity\n\nScheduling and deploying patches without affecting employee productivity is one of the most crucial factors to be considered while implementing patch management. One of the most convenient ways to achieve this is by deploying patches based on the user's availability and system uptime stats.\n\nAdditionally, admins can leverage patch management tools to create deployment policies and deploy patches to the systems automatically while configuring the pre or post-installation criteria such as rebooting the systems and so on.\n\nDeveloping strategies to patch all the systems across the network\n\nFor enterprises with employees spread around the world, it is imperative that the admins develop deployment strategies to patch all of the systems in LAN, remote offices (WAN), and employees working from home.\n\nTesting and rolling back patches\n\nTesting of patches should always precede the deployment. Once the patches have been tested for functional correctness, they can be deployed to the systems safely.\n\nOn the contrary, if the patches show signs of anomalies or disrupt system performance post-deployment, admins should also have the ability to roll back (uninstall) these patches across all the systems where they have been deployed.\n\n5 steps for an efficient patch management process\n\nAs important as it is to understand \"what is patching\", it is far more crucial to deploy patches strategically. While installing patches is a must, installing them the second they are available can wreak havoc on endpoints. This is why it's highly recommended you create a strategic approach that strikes a fine balance between the time to patch and patch prioritization.\n\nHere are the five steps for an efficient patch management process:\n\nChoose a centralized patch management solution\n\nManually updating patches and keeping tabs on reports is an impossible task. When an organization grows, applying patches manually becomes increasingly difficult and impractical, paving the way for critical errors. This is why it's best to opt for patch management solutions that offer a central console featuring patch deployment, reporting, and customizations.\n\nTest patches prior to deployment in a pilot environment\n\nThere are several instances wherein certain software patch (or patches) have caused system instability and crashes. As a result, it is highly recommended to test the patches in a pilot group of endpoints before they are deployed to the production machines. As a best practice, the pilot group of endpoints must have all the same flavors and operating system versions being used in the network.\n\nPrioritization and systematic deployment\n\nSorting the patches and the endpoints you need to patch by priority is yet another important step for an efficient patch management process. It is best to practice patch deployment in the endpoints in groups and not as a whole. Moreover, patches should be deployed based on their severity, with critical patches being the top priority.\n\nAutomate patching\n\nManual patching of all the endpoints in an organization is a repetitive task that demands time and labor, causing productivity drops. In addition, it increases the overall time to fully patch every endpoint in the organization, leaving more room for exploitation by threat actors. Automating the entire patch management process and using a patching tool for your organization ensures faster response times, enhanced security, and improved productivity.\n\nTrack and generate reports\n\nTracking the progress and failure of the patch deployments in the network and keeping a record is crucial. Generating and maintaining reports helps with assessing the patch compliance of the network.\n\nWhat are the best practices for patch management?\n\nPatching endpoints regularly can keep cyberattacks at bay to a large extent. Here are a few patch management best practices that we recommend you follow:\n\nAutomate patch management, especially for security updates\n\nA study by the Ponemon Institute, the Costs and Consequences of Gaps in Vulnerability Response, states that it takes 16 days on average to patch a critical vulnerability once detected.\n\nSay goodbye to tedious downloads and manual installations with automated patch deployment. From scanning missing patches to installing them on the respective endpoints, automated deployments are not just easy, but accurate and fast.\n\nUse a critical-updates-first approach\n\nAs many as 72% of respondents in the same Ponemon study reported difficulties in prioritizing patches.\n\nWith a critical-updates-first approach, admins can sort and act on the patches that need to be installed immediately. This reduces the threat response time and ensures efficient patch management.\n\nSchedule auto-deployments twice a week\n\nWith scheduled auto-deployment of patches, your endpoints will keep receiving regular patch updates as and when released. Our experts recommend scheduling deployments twice a week to allow proper testing and approval of patches.\n\nAllow user intervention to prevent productivity drops\n\nWhile it's essential to patch endpoints as soon as possible, admins also have to ensure continued user productivity. With flexible deployment policies in place, users can choose to postpone updates if the update conflicts with their business-critical tasks.\n\nImportance of patch management solutions for an Enterprise\n\nWith a plethora of patch management tools available in the market today, it is important that you identify the patch management software that best suits your organization's needs. Before taking a look at how you can identify one, let's understand the importance of patch management software:\n\nSimplifies the patch management process: Any of the ideal patch management solutions simplify the entire patch management process: from identifying the missing patches, testing them, deploying to the required endpoints, and generating reports. This further negates any manual intervention.\n\nKeeps vulnerabilities at bay and systems in compliance: With tens of thousands of vulnerabilities being detected every year, they must be tracked and mitigated before being exploited. With patch management software in place, the vulnerable applications can swiftly be detected and remediated thereby bolstering the endpoint security as well as keeping them compliant.\n\nEnsures productivity and network security: Achieving network security and compliance in an enterprise of thousands is a tough job. Since the employees are spread over various geographical locations and have different job requirements, devising a common patching policy becomes a hassle.\n\nWith modern patch management tools such as Patch Manager Plus, admins can create patching schedules that ensure network security is achieved without affecting the end user's productivity.\n\nGenerates insightful reporting for audits and compliances: As important as it is to deploy patches, admins should also have track of the deployments as well as the unpatched systems. A patch management solution generates real-time reports that make it easier to track all the stages of the patch deployment task as well as other important details of the network, which are crucial for compliance and audit purposes.\n\nHow to choose the right patch management software?\n\nHow do you find the best patch management software for your organization? The answer depends on the features that you're looking for. Every business has its own set of demands, but there are a few common traits most organizations want to see in patch management software.\n\nThe patch management tool should:\n\nApply patches across every major operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nSupport software patching for heterogeneous endpoints such as laptops, desktops, servers, remote devices, etc.\n\nProvide patching support for third-party applications.\n\nHave a completely automated patch management feature to save time and money for users.\n\nOffer dynamic reporting with details on the status of patches.\n\nHave an interactive, affordable, easy-to-use, web-based interface with support documentation to help users at every step.\n\nRemote Patch Management: To manage remote patching for work-from-home options.\n\nPatch Manager Plus provides:\n\nWindows patch management: Automates Windows patching, mitigates security risks, and fixes vulnerabilities in minutes.\n\nmacOS patch management: Deploys and manages patches to all macOS endpoints from a single console.\n\nLinux patch management: Provides on-demand and scheduled patch deployment of Linux-related security fixes.\n\nIf you're looking for one of the most affordable patch management solutions that offers everything listed above, look no further; Patch Manager Plus offers all these features to help keep your network patched and secured, all from one, central location. This patch management tool is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux and offers a Free edition for up to 25 devices. In addition, it also provides server patch management to help keep data secure and up to date.\n\nServer patch management involves testing and patching physical and virtual servers with little to no downtime. This free patch management software gives you access to all the essential features required to patch your systems. This patch management solution can secure your entire infrastructure.\n\nManageEngine's flagship patching software - Patch Manager Plus is available both as an on-premises as well as a cloud patching solution. With remote jobs changing the way IT operates, you can perform patching on the go with Patch Manager Plus Cloud.\n\nSecurity patch management\n\nSecurity patch management is the process of detecting, testing and deploying security patches or updates to the systems to address the security vulnerabilities and issues. Security patches ensure that the known security vulnerabilities in the systems and the network are promptly mitigated.\n\nWhile patch management refers to the deployment of patches across all the endpoints, it usually encompasses both the security and non-security patches. The deployment of security updates across the endpoints should always be of primary focus and should be performed promptly after testing, as soon as the updates are released. Other non-security updates or feature enhancements can be deployed in the subsequent deployment schedules, once the security patches have been installed.\n\nServer patch management\n\nServer patch management is the process of detecting, testing, and deploying the missing patches to prevent the servers from being exploited by vulnerabilities and external threat actors. In addition, these patches improve the performance and stability of the servers by removing existing bugs and glitches while adding newer functionalities. For organizations and enterprises, server patch management is a critical task since the allotted server maintenance time is usually very less, as to prevent productivity drops.\n\nWith an automated patching software, not only can you automate the entire workflow but also ensure that the patches are tested and approved before deployment so as to prevent any anomalies. Refer here to know more about server patching.\n\nManageEngine's patch management solution to deploy software patches\n\nManageEngine Patch Manager Plus follows these six steps in its patch management process: synchronizing, scanning, downloading, testing, deploying approved patches to their respective computers, and generating reports.\n\nFor details on each of these steps, simply keep reading:\n\nSynchronization: All information about patches is collected from vendor sites and is fed into the patch database. This patch database is then synchronized with the Patch Manager Plus server.\n\nDetect: The next step is to identify the computers that require these patches. Patch Manager Plus automatically scans the computers in the network to detect the missing patches.\n\nDownload: All missing patches are downloaded from vendor sites. This includes security updates, non-security updates, service packs, rollups, optional updates, and feature packs.\n\nTest and approve: The downloaded patches are first tested in non-production machines (test groups). Deploying untested patches in a production environment can be risky - some patches and updates may lead to post-deployment problems like compatibility issues, which only make the admin's job tougher if incompatible patches and updates require uninstallation. The patches are approved only if they cause no issues post-deployment.\n\nDeployment: With flexible deployment policies, not only can you select the deployment window, but you can create patching policies as well. This patch management policy provides access to multiple deployment settings to help you decide when to deploy a patch and how.\n\nReport: After successful deployment, reports are automatically generated and the information is sent to the server. It supports customized reports, which help you to filter data easily and share results in a variety of formats (PDF, CSV, XLSX).\n\nFAQs\n\n1) What does patch management do?\n\nPatch management is the process of identifying, testing, deploying, and installing software patches (or updates) to computers thereby preventing them from being exploited by threat actors.\n\n2) What are three types of patch management?\n\nSoftware patches are generally of three types, i.e. Security patches, Bug fix patches, and Feature update patches.\n\n3) Why is patch management important?\n\nA proper patch management process mitigates bugs/vulnerabilities in the software by updating them with the latest patches/versions available.
