        "text": "Patch management is a process in which code changes known as “software patches”, are deployed to devices to fix or update the device’s operating system or software products. Patches are small installation packages or files that are installed on computers.\n\nPatch management helps prevent data breaches by fixing security vulnerabilities. It also makes it easier to ensure that devices are running the latest software versions. Patch management is an essential part of Windows and Mac management.\n\nIn order to select the right patch management software for your organization, you should evaluate the features available such as automated scanning, batched deployments, and available insights and reporting. The right tool should also align with your organization’s security needs and operational requirements.\n\nWhy is patch management important?\n\nThe main purpose of patch management is to ensure the security and performance of devices. Patch management software is used to address security vulnerabilities through monitoring and applying security patches. This helps reduce the risk of cyber attacks, protects sensitive data, and ensures regulatory compliance.\n\nAccording to a study by Tripwire, almost one-third of organizations have suffered a data breach due to an unpatched vulnerability. A study by Ponemon Institute and ServiceNow shows similar results. Almost 50% of the respondents report having had one or more data breaches in the past two years, and 60% of breached companies say that those breaches may have occurred due to an unpatched known vulnerability.\n\nUnpatched software is a real cybersecurity risk for organizations, which can result in data breaches that have multifaceted consequences. Luckily, security risks can be mitigated with efficient patch management practices.\n\nSource: Tripwire\n\nFurthermore, patching helps ensure the performance and stability of operating systems and applications. Patches typically include important software updates which tackle performance issues and remove outdated features. Effective patch management software also offers real-time visibility, prioritizes critical patches, and automates deployments in the background to minimize disruptions.\n\nBenefits of patch management\n\nSo why should your organization utilize patch management? Here are three major reasons:\n\nDevice and data security: Fixing security weaknesses with the latest software patches helps you prevent data breaches in which sensitive customer or company data can leak outside your company.\n\nCompliance: Patching helps you make sure that unauthorized people can not access your data and exploit it. Proper data storing and handling is also a prerequisite for complying with regulations, such as HIPAA and GDPR.\n\nUser experience: With patch management, you can ensure that devices are running smoothly without interruptions. Productivity increases as device users don’t have to struggle with performance issues or bugs.\n\nTypes of software patches\n\nThere are three different categories of software patches, each tailored to address specific issues:\n\nSecurity patches: Security patches are updates designed to fix software vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Vulnerabilities range from critical flaws to ones which can compromise system or data security. Managing security patches is important to protect systems from emerging threats and cyber attacks.\n\nBug fix patches: Bug fix patches address software bugs or glitches that impact program functionality or performance. These bugs can vary in severity from minor inconveniences to critical issues which can cause device crashes or security risks. Bug fix patches are vital for maintaining software stability and reliability by resolving known issues reported by users or discovered through internal testing.\n\nFeature update patches: Feature update patches introduce new functionality, enhancements, or improvements to existing software. These updates often include new features, UI, performance improvements, and support for new technology. Feature update patches are common in subscription and cloud software models where continuous updates deliver value and help maintain market competitiveness.\n\nHow does patch management work?\n\nPatch management is the process of identifying, testing, and installing updates to keep software and systems up-to-date. It ensures software security, stability and functionality by fixing bugs, closing security gaps, and adding new features.\n\nManual or centralized patch management?\n\nOperating systems and applications can be updated either manually or centrally with patch management software. If you're managing only a few computers and can easily keep track of your devices, manual patch management might work for you.\n\nHowever, hundreds of software patches are being released continuously for different applications and operating systems. Without an automated process, staying on top of those can be a complex, if not impossible, task.\n\nIf you're managing multiple devices and need to keep track of their patching status, you might want to consider centralized patching.\n\nUsing patch management software makes it easy to centrally monitor the patching status of your IT environment. It also allows you to upload and install all necessary patches to your devices automatically. This means that your IT Manager or device user doesn't have to manually search for new patches and install them separately.\n\nThere are several patch management solutions in the market, but having patch management as part of your Unified Endpoint Management solution makes device management significantly easier. With a UEM solution, you can view detailed information on your devices and manage other security configurations for your Windows and Mac computers.\n\nBest practices on implementing a patch management process\n\nBefore you get started, it's good to take a more strategic approach to your patching process rather than just start installing new patches immediately. We recommend using patch management software and creating a patch management plan that takes the following things into account:\n\n1. Up-to-date asset inventory\n\nThe number one rule is to always have an up-to-date device inventory to identify potential security threats. It's essential to know which devices you have in your IT environment and have access to detailed hardware and software information (e.g., operating systems, versions, locations, and device users).\n\n2. Patch detection\n\nMake sure to stay updated on the latest patches for your devices' operating systems and applications. Patches can be searched manually but patch management software enables you to automate the detection — ensuring that you don't miss any critical updates.\n\n3. Patching status\n\nBefore approving or deploying any patches, try to get a comprehensive understanding of the patching status of your software and computers. You can do this easily by running a patch scan on your devices with patch management software. Identify what are the most common and crucial patches that are missing from your computers.\n\nAlso, check which patches have been superseded by newer ones. You might not want to deploy those that have already been replaced by newer patches.\n\n4. Patching plan\n\nBefore you start approving the patch deployments, it's recommended to spend a while planning your patch management policies. Here are some questions and tips to help you with this:\n\nWhich patches are you interested in? Make a list of software applications that you want to patch.\n\nReview and verify your list against the results of the patch scan. Make sure your list is not unintentionally missing any software that has been detected in the environment.\n\nFor how long should the patch deployments be tested? When do you estimate to get results from the pilot group?\n\nHow soon should new patches be applied to managed computers?\n\nWho is responsible for overlooking the patch management process?\n\nShould users be informed about patching activities? We recommend informing at least the pilot users about new patch deployments so that they can report back the possible problems.\n\n5. Patch approval\n\nDepending on the patch management software or method you're using, you can approve patches either manually or let automation handle that for you. Manual patch approval gives you more options when it comes to selecting the individual patches, but automation is a great choice if you're looking for convenience.\n\nIf you're approving patches manually, it’s good practice to start approving them from the most recent ones and pay attention to possibly superseded patches. This way you can easily avoid the deployment of unnecessary patches that have already been replaced by newer ones.\n\nIf your patch approval process is automatic, available patches are deployed to pilot devices automatically based on your configurations.\n\n6. Patch testing and pilot group\n\nTo ensure that all patches work as they should, run a pilot for a selected number of devices before installing new patches on everyone's devices. Make sure that you have a diverse set of test or pilot devices. This helps you ensure the patches’ compatibility with all business-critical applications on all affected operating systems. If possible, also include some business-critical systems in your pilot group but make sure that they are easily recoverable if any problems occur.\n\nPay attention to the users of the pilot computers when choosing the pilot systems. Try to select pilot devices whose users are tech-savvy and perceptive. Remember to inform the users about the upcoming deployments so that they are aware of what’s going on and ready to report any possible problems without delay.\n\nIf any problems occur, do not approve the patch for other computers before investigating the issue more closely.\n\n7. Patch distribution\n\nIf no issues occur during the pilot, you can deploy the patches to all of your devices. We recommend deploying them first to a selected group of devices to make sure that everything is working as it should. With patch management software, you can automate the deployment process to different device groups.\n\nRemember to always have a patch rollback plan prepared in case of unexpected issues.\n\n8. Patch compliance status\n\nAfter the deployment, make sure that all of the patches have been installed successfully. With patch management software, you can easily get a report of the status of your devices.\n\nHow Miradore approaches automated patch management\n\nMiradore offers automated patch management for Windows and Mac — helping you to keep your Windows computers secure and running smoothly.
