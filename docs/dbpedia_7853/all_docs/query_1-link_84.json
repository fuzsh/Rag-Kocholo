        "text": "Primum Non Nocere. First, do no Harm.\n\nIt is the first rule of medicine; should we not extend this to skincare, too?\n\nFor those not deeply immersed in beauty trends, microneedling may be somewhat peculiar.\n\nIt is a cosmetic procedure that goes by various names such as dermarolling, derma stamping with PRF or PRP, and Morpheus 8,\n\nIt has a superstar status because of its purported benefits to the skin.\n\nHowever, concerns and reported side effects have risen amid the buzz about its advantages.\n\nSo, for this article, I will delve into the intricacies of microneedling to understand where things can potentially go awry.\n\nAre you keen to learn more? That’s great, because I dedicated a free ebook to it, which you can read here.\n\nBefore I proceed, it’s important to clarify that microneedling can produce excellent results when performed by experienced dermatologists or skilled skincare specialists.\n\nHowever, challenges tend to emerge when microneedling crosses into the domain of at-home treatments or is performed by individuals in the industry who lack the necessary expertise.\n\nIn such cases, the potential side effects can span from scars, pocking, and infections to track marks, enlarged pores, and an expedited ageing process.\n\nSome individuals have encountered complications like erythematous papules, alterations in skin pigmentation, permanent indentations, systemic hypersensitivity, and even the development of granulomatous dermatitis. There have been instances suggesting potential tumour formation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\nWith a career spanning over three decades as an experienced esthetician, I want to emphasise that my intention is not to promote fear or alarm.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to disregard the weekly emails and comments we receive from our audience (see comment section) and these case studies, which vividly portray the physical and psychological trauma many have endured due to poorly executed microneedling treatments.\n\nTherefore, this article aims to raise awareness regarding the potential risks linked to microneedling facial procedures, highlighting the complications that can arise so that you can be well-informed if you are contemplating having such a treatment.\n\nWhat is microneedling\n\nMicroneedling is a medical procedure that employs fine, sterile needles vibrating at high speeds. These needles puncture the skin’s surface with thousands of tiny holes in a few seconds.\n\nThese controlled micro-wounds are believed to stimulate a healing response in the skin, boosting collagen and elastin and developing new blood vessels in the dermis, the deeper layer of skin.\n\nIn technical terms, it takes advantage of your skin’s response to any inflammatory wound.\n\nFor example, if you cut your skin, your body’s first line of defence is to deploy white blood cells; these release chemicals that increase the production of components that comprise your skin’s intercellular matrix.\n\nThey tell your body to patch the hole, creating new cells at the site of the wound.\n\nA classical wound may be defined as a disruption of tissue integrity; any wounds, whether caused by injury or remodelling, rely on the biological phases of healing: inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling.\n\nThe Misconceptions\n\nMany believe microneedling is a collagen-stimulating treatment that employs needles to injure the skin. This ultimately enhances collagen and elastin production and improves skin texture, pores, and fine lines.\n\nMicroneedling, in reality, penetrates the epidermis, your skin’s outer layer, creating minor puncture marks that disrupt your skin’s natural defence mechanisms. Consequently, your skin must work harder to repair these micro-tears through collagen induction, potentially leading to various skin issues.\n\nThat tightening sensation in your skin is inflammation and swelling. Breaking down your skin’s protective barrier with needles induces temporary trauma and injury, producing a plump, swollen skin effect. The often-described “lit-from-within” glow following microneedling is, in fact, a result of inflammation, which we believe can contribute to premature ageing.\n\nGiven the fact that there is trauma inflicted on your skin during this procedure, I hope you can appreciate why I emphasise the importance of choosing a skincare specialist with substantial experience in microneedling. It is essential to shop around before deciding on your treatment provider.\n\nWhy You Should Avoid Microneedling at Home\n\nCross-contamination is a significant concern with this treatment, mainly because the handpiece allows backflow. To minimise the risk of infection, microneedling should be performed in a sterile clinical environment by a skincare specialist experienced in this treatment.\n\nEven a puncture as shallow as 0.2 mm can trigger an inflammatory response in your skin, potentially leading to issues at various depths. Moreover, at such depths, you’re introducing active serums to areas they aren’t meant to reach.\n\nIn summary, if your skin is compromised and showing signs like redness, dryness, inflammation, or acne-related issues, or if your skin is under stress, it becomes highly susceptible to damage, as demonstrated in this study (1).\n\nTestimonials\n\nClemmy from London wrote: “I’m in dire need of assistance. My skin’s condition has worsened after microneedling at home. The treatment seemed to have torn apart my skin beneath the surface. My previously flawless skin is now in shambles, and I’m on the verge of tears. It’s lost its firmness and support, and I’m aware of the structural damage it’s sustained. I feel like I’ve been grazed all over. I’m too self-conscious to even step out of my house, and it’s been six months, yet my skin shows no signs of healing. I had absolutely no knowledge of the risks associated with microneedling\n\nNancy from Australia wrote: “I performed microneedling at home for the first time and i awoke to a swollen face and I had these scratch-like marks. IMy skin was irritated during the procedure, and that should have raised red flags. I also have some bruising. I went to clinic where they recommende I have a series of peels, which unfortunately triggered inflammation in my skin. Fast forward to today, and my skin is marked with tiny holes and lines. Thanks to the incredible support and products from your team, it’s gradually on the path to recovery. Nevertheless, it has been a time-consuming and strenuous journey, and looking back, I wish I had never ever done this to myself.”\n\nAngela, a client, experienced the following: “I am 43 and I performed three micro needling treatment on myself which has left my face inflamed and I am battling severe facial burning. My once smooth skin is sensitive, and my pores are enlarged. I have been to a few dermatologists who have no idea what to do. Your advice is helping to rebuild my skin. I can’t thank you enough. I wish I had known about these microneedling side effects earlier.”\n\nMarian from the USA wrote: “Micro rolling has destroyed my skin. After i performed the second treatment on myself I noticed bumps and holes in my face. It has dried out my skin and created strange horizontal lines I did not previously have; in short, microneedling at home is UNSAFE. Do not attempt it.”\n\nJen from Australia wrote: “After having 25 pages of blood tests, my dermatologist was very thorough, it been found that my condition is due to having a course of microneedling with PRP, treatments. I am devastated; my dermatologist believes I have solid facial oedema, which is very rare. I am now on Roaccutane & may need to be on it for 1-2 years; although my skin is responding, this will be a long battle to get rid of it. I’m completely shattered i had no idea i should not perform this treatment on myself. I would NEVER recommend micro-needling to anyone. I warn all my friends about the micro needling risks so they never suffer like I am. Your Xcell barrier repair skinshot has been a lifesaver I refer to it as liquid gold.”\n\nThank you to those who openly shared your microneedling before and after the journey. I hope that together, we can help rebuild the health of your skin.\n\nThe following case studies (2) examined people who suffered facial allergic granulomatous reactions and hypersensitivity associated with microneedling treatment.\n\nSide Effects of Microneedle Treatment\n\nReason #1: I have inflammation and rosacea\n\nChronic inflammation is highly damaging.\n\nMicroneedling is designed to create a certain level of inflammation, a natural response to the treatment’s trauma. This inflammation is generally considered a normal, physiological reaction that helps stimulate skin repair and rejuvenation. Most mild allergic or inflammatory responses should subside within a week.\n\nHowever, if the inflammation persists, it might indicate that your immune system is reacting to a perceived foreign substance that it can’t eliminate. Chemicals, organic or inorganic materials, or bacterial infections could trigger this.\n\nInitial redness and swelling may not be noticeable to the naked eye, which can be misleading. Prolonged inflammation that makes your skin sensitive to the touch can potentially harm the structural cells and matrix proteins in the deeper layers of your skin.\n\nIn some cases, persistent inflammation may lead to conditions like rosacea or granulomatous dermatoses, manifesting as inflammation and tissue distortion. These conditions can take weeks or even months to become apparent. This process is sometimes referred to in the industry as “skin flamm’ageing.”\n\nAny plumping or firmness sensation during the initial stages is often just an illusion caused by the body’s inflammation response, leading to temporary swelling. Unfortunately, this inflammation can also lead to collagen breakdown, further accelerating the ageing process.\n\nIf you are concerned you have rosacea, we have created an entire resource you can read here.\n\nReason #2: My skin looks aged and sagging\n\nWhen microneedles penetrate the deeper skin layer of the dermis, it triggers an inflammatory response that stimulates fibronectin production.\n\nThis glycoprotein acts as a scaffold for newly induced collagen, which tightens and smoothens the skin over time, reducing wrinkles and improving scar appearance.\n\nHowever, the needle punctures mechanically damage the collagen fibres, desensitising the receptors responsible for signalling collagen synthesis.\n\nThis can lead to a paradoxical effect, where initial treatments succeed, but subsequent sessions have the opposite outcome.\n\nRepeated collagen destruction through microneedling forces your body to produce more collagen fibres to replace what’s lost. Over time, this natural ability diminishes, accelerating the ageing process.\n\nIt’s crucial to understand that microneedling induces a stress response in the body. When your skin experiences this stressor, your body rapidly replenishes lost collagen.\n\nWhile this might create the illusion of plumper skin, the damage to your skin’s internal scaffold can become apparent immediately or take years to manifest. The result is often lines, wrinkles, hollow areas, and sagging skin.\n\nFurthermore, microneedling can damage healthy cells and disrupt their integrity, leading to cell death and an accelerated ageing process. Cellular turnover occurs when live skin cells replace old ones through cellular division.\n\nDuring this process, the chromosome’s end in the cell’s nucleus, known as a telomere, is gradually cut off. Once approximately 60 divisions have occurred, the telomere is completely depleted, and ageing begins.\n\nMicroneedling accelerates the rate of cell division in your skin. The faster this occurs, the more rapidly your skin ages, resulting in sagging and the development of expression lines.\n\nA note on fat loss in the cheek area\n\nIn the article “Understanding the Aging Face,” I discuss a study conducted by Oxford University (1), which proposes a significant insight into the dynamics of the ageing process in facial fat pads. According to this research, damage to the malar fat pad, responsible for the plumpness of the cheeks, is associated with specific types of movements.\n\nThe study suggests that horizontal movements may tighten the ligaments that anchor the malar fat pads in place, while vertical movements could have the opposite effect, potentially loosening these ligaments.\n\nThis finding offers a compelling explanation for experiences involving invasive microneedling procedures, where the machine is often dragged up and down, as well as certain hand facial exercises that entail up-and-down movements in this particular area of the face. These actions may inadvertently impact the integrity of the ligaments supporting the malar fat pads, contributing to undesired outcomes or complications.\n\nReason #3: My skin inflames when I apply products\n\nMicroneedling significantly disrupts your skin’s impermeable barrier function, composed of multiple layers of dead, keratinised cells that protect your deeper, living cells.\n\nThe needles create thousands of channels that allow topically applied substances to penetrate your skin.\n\nHowever, until these channels form effective plugs and initiate healing, your skin remains exposed and vulnerable to anything it encounters.\n\nThis can lead to various concerns related to the treatment, often stemming from the topical solutions applied to the skin during maximal barrier function disruption.\n\nSubstances naturally occurring in your skin are generally safe, while those that do not should be avoided.\n\nWe recommend using “skin-identical hyaluronic acid” during the healing stage and, once healed, transitioning to a formula containing ceramides, lipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids.\n\nWe’ve detailed what happens when you micro-needle specific ingredients into your skin in a dedicated article, which you can read here.\n\nReason #4: My skin has an orange-peel texture\n\nMicroneedling creates hundreds to thousands of puncture holes in your skin, not visible to the naked eye but large enough to serve as pathways to your bloodstream.\n\nYour skin interprets this as trauma, causing your sebaceous glands to become overactive and your skin to become excessively oily.\n\nThe increased oil production can lead to clogged pores, breakouts, and an uneven, orange-peel-like texture akin to cellulite. These textural changes are often associated with low-grade inflammation resulting from microneedling.\n\nAnother reason skin develops an orange peel texture is cellulitis, a condition caused by bacterial infection of open skin. It can cause skin to become pitted, swollen, red, and tender.\n\nBacteria cause cellulitis, which oral antibiotics can treat. However, it is a severe infection, so do see a dermatologist if this sounds like you.\n\nOther issues may include the development of raised, milia-like bumps, blackheads, and enlarged pores."
