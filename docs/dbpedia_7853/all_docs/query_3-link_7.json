        "text": "Discussion in 'Crime, Thriller & Action' started by Domino355, .\n\nBasically, my question. I mean, the grand travel stories, series of quests. I just can't find many new adcenture stories being published.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it that people just aren't interested in these kinds of stories anymore (well it is one of the oldest genres in the book)? That it is just too tropy and writers can't get anything new from it, or maybe that these stories are too linear?\n\nI personally think that all of the great adventures on Earth have been explored, and people have realized that. So, they filled the void with science fiction adventures, but the space craze wore out and is pretty much over. We'll probably see some revival within the next 20 years or so, though, based on the survival stories becoming popular.\n\nJust my two cents, take with a grain of salt.\n\nI would say Adventure is becoming more of a subgenre more than anything. Much like Keystroke stated, much of the world has already been discovered and this leaves little in the ways of Adventure. So most adventures will take place in a selective few manners. 1. Young Kids discovering the world themselves. 2. Fictionary worlds developed in order to create the ability for an Adventure timeline. 3. TombRaider - In reflection, I would not say Adventure is a \"dying\" genre, but more a stagnating one. Nothing new in terms of idea sparking material has been introduced in human society so thus, not many books being PRIMARILY adventure based. Though I guess debatably, many fictions could be classified adventure as characters are going place to place. So a question, what does Adventure mean to you?\n\nRandom theory: Maybe the fact that most of the planet is explored and known discourages stories that are about travel discovery, so that that impulse is redirected to worlds that are purely fictional--fantasy and science fiction.\n\nI did one that fits your definition to a tee. A Roman diplomatic mission to China in 100AD, a helluva 17,000 mile quest with lots of adventure in what is for most readers a whole new undiscovered world: Storms, pirates, firefights, skullduggery, unlikely alliances, a disaster in the court, a dramatic rescue, return overland with the nomadic Xiongnu, silk road caravans, the Bactrian empire (modern Afghanistan)... something unexpected happens every chapter. Be sure to buy a copy of \"The Eagle and the Dragon, a Novel of Rome and China\" as soon as I can get an agent and a publisher. (Shameless plug!)\n\nYou may not be looking in the right genre labels - a lot of SciFi and Fantasy can follow a very traditional adventure story format.\n\nOne of the hotter titles this year is David Levine's \"Arabella of Mars\" - which despite the title is actually in the Fantasy realm - and from what I hear that one is straight-up high-seas adventure-questing.\n\nI also just read the first book of Karl Schroeder's Virga series - \"Sun of Suns\" - which in fairness is ten years old, but that's a fairly well respected SciFi series and the first book was, again, straight up high-seas adventure (including pirates) just without the water.\n\nIf you're talking about globe trotting adventures that involve heroes and villains, ancient artifacts or lost cities and the world is at stake then there are still authors out there writing these styles of books. Matthew Reilly is known for his action thrillers with his new book, The Four Legendary Kingdoms, eagerly anticipated. Andy McDermott and Clive Cussler are two more active authors in the genre. I'm currently writing my own globe trotting adventure and still believe it's a genre that holds great wonder and possibility. Just saying.\n\nYeah, there's tons of stories that are like that. They just go by different labels. At the bookstore I hang around in, the \"Fantasy\" section has loads of books involving the tropey things like warriors and quests et al (of course, there's also much more diversity beyond solely those things). Also, other related genres, like sci-fi and dystopia, have similar elements as well. Books in the YA section also include some of those categories.\n\nSo yeah, adventure stories exist, in the sense that probably the vast majority of genre fiction involves an adventure of some kind. It's not just labeled \"Adventure\" on the cover sticker.\n\nWikepedia defines the Adventure story as: An adventure is an event or series of events that happens outside the course of the protagonist's ordinary life, usually accompanied by danger, often by physical action. Adventure stories almost always move quickly, and the pace of the plot is at least as important as characterization, setting and other elements of a creative work.[1]\n\nThe notion of exploration (as in going someplace where NOBODY has been before) isn't really part of the genre. Adventure stories take the protagonist somewhere THEY have never been before, that will involve danger and physical action. I'd say Romancing the Stone and the other movies like that are Adventure stories (made into movies), even though where the protagonist goes is not an unknown part of the world.\n\nI would expect that it's the 'adventure' part of the story that is important in this genre, more so than defeating bad guys or solving mysteries, or whatever else the plot includes. It's the tackling of something new and dangerous that seems to drive the genre.\n\nI don't think the genre is dying, I just think people expect more than just a quest. There needs to be well structured characters, deeper meaning, etc.\n\nI'm not sure authors have to come up with something so horribly 'unique' or 'different', but there has got to be some sort of feeling, some sort of emotion, to the work.\n\nAdventure stories is certainly one of the oldest genres as you said. If adventure means for people to go on quest for a destination or goal, I would say that a lot of people imagine that being too simple for their stories, which is certainly ridiculous. I believe some of the greatest stories and even movies follow the quest formula (Krull is awesome ), so it is sad that you don't see people writing in that sort of genre much anymore. Probably because people want to write stories with more depth and analyzable detail than just a straightforward quest from A to B.\n\nImagine it, though, any story is an adventure as long as the characters aren't having fun during it (I forgot who said that!)\n\nWhy does adventure have to be a long journey? Most have a satisfying trip,\n\nbut the ending is just not going to compete with the journey overall.\n\nThe best part is the struggles and other things along the way, not necessarily\n\nthe destination.\n\nAdventure dead, no. It is alive and well, perhaps you just need to look a little\n\ndeeper in the mix to find the specific version of it that you like.\n\nAdventure isn't dead but I think it has been sublimated into other genres now. More of an element that an actual category. SFF is loaded with adventurous plots and overtones, but it always gets labeled under its larger mother category. I think even if you wrote a pure adventure story (like an American teenager chasing poachers through the Amazon) the overlords would probably market it as suspense/thriller. I have no idea why, but that does appear to be a thing now.\n\nI definitely agree with what other people are saying, Adventure books are still being written and released, just under a different category. For example, I would say The Hobbit is an adventure book, but over here at the local bookstore, it's under Fantasy or Children's Books. So maybe the label itself is disappearing a little bit at the moment, because the books are being put in different categories, but when you look at it, they are still Adventure books."
