The adventure begins when Pongo and Perdita's pup Patch, who is not satisfied being just one out of 101, gets the chance to meet his TV hero, Thunderbolt, the One-Of-A-Kind Wonderdog. When Thunderbolt's trusty sidekick Lightning reveals that the show's producers are on the lookout for a new star, Thunderbolt with Patch in tow struts out into the real world to perform true acts of heroism. And when puppy-obsessed Cruella De Vil returns, it's Patch and Thunderbolt's teamwork and friendship that will save the day.
