Final years

Robert Cunninghame Graham remained sprightly and rode daily even in his 80s. He continued to write, was the President of the Scottish Branch of the P.E.N. Club and involve himself in politics. He died from pneumonia on March 20, 1936 in the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina following a visit to the birthplace of his friend William Hudson. His body lay in state in the Casa del Teatro and received a countrywide tribute led by the President of the Republic before his body was shipped home to be buried beside his wife in the ruined Augustinian Inchmahome Priory on the island of Inchmahome, Lake of Menteith, Stirling.

The following year, June 1937, a monument the Cunninghame Graham Memorial was unveiled at Castlehill, Dumbarton, near the family home at Ardoch. Later it was moved to Gartmore, closer to the principal Graham estate, which he had been forced to sell in 1901 to the shipping magnate and founder of the Clan Line, Sir Charles Cayzer, Bt. His estates at Ardoch passed to his nephew, Captain (later Admiral Sir) Angus Cunninghame Graham, the only son of his brother Cdr. Charles Elphinstone-Fleeming Cunninghame Graham, MVO.
