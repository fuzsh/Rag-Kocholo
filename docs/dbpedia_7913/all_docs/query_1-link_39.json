        "text": "Includes accounts of Graham’s extraordinary political career from Hansard, and national and local newspapers\n\nExamines Graham’s role in the founding of both the Labour party and the SNP\n\nDiscusses Graham’s unique political journalism and evocations of Scottish life and character\n\nAnalyses Graham's relationships with literary figures such as Oscar Wilde, Frank Harris, John Galsworthy, G. B. Shaw, W. H. Hudson and Joseph Conrad\n\nR. B. Cunninghame Graham was a well-known and hugely influential figure in late 19th- and early 20th-century Scottish politics and literature. This book explores Graham’s early political views, his time as a Member of Parliament, his disillusionment with the Liberal Party and his reputation as the first declared ‘socialist’ MP. Using documentary evidence and tangible philosophical links, the book traces Graham’s early political influences derived directly or indirectly from key 19th-century figures, particularly William Morris. It also examines Graham’s anti-imperialist, anti-colonial and anti-racist speeches and writings, and his active support for women’s rights and universal suffrage.\n\nLachlan Munro strips away the mythology surrounding Graham to reveal an altogether more complex picture, exploring his political and literary achievements, during a time of enormous political, economic and cultural upheaval – the reverberations of which are still ongoing."
