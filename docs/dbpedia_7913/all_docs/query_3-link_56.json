        "text": "Happy Birthday to Don Roberto, elected member of parliament for North West Lanarkshire in 1886, and holder of many historic firsts: generally regarded as the first socialist MP; probably the first MP who had previously been a gaucho; and officially the first MP to use the word “Damn” in the Commons - for which he was suspended from the House. (Quite bloody right, too. We don’t want parliament filled up with a load of sweary-faced buggers.)\n\nThe first socialist MP wasn’t, as you might have expected, a labourer, an artisan, or even a member of the rising middle classes. Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1852-1936) was a Scottish aristocrat, a descendant of Robert II of Scotland, and – to many revisionist genealogists – the rightful king of Great Britain and Ireland. “If I had my rights,” he once said, “I should be king of England. And what a two weeks that would be!”\n\nFrom these unrevolutionary beginnings was forged one of the most extraordinary characters British politics has ever seen, and – which is not so often remembered – a parliamentarian of great seriousness and no little significance.\n\nAfter an unhappily conventional schooling at Harrow, his real life began when he was seventeen. His family tree included not merely Scottish kings but also Spanish and Latin American nobility. The blue blood remained, but the money had gone. With the old estate on the brink of ruin, teenage Robert set off to make his fortune ranching in Argentina. The fortune never materialised, and the family estate was eventually lost, but he did spend his youth having adventures in that country as well as Mexico, Uruguay, the USA and Paraguay. At one point he was kidnapped by rebels, and became an enthusiast for their cause.\n\nBy the time he returned to Scotland, in 1881, his life experiences had turned him into a champion of the underdog, wherever such dogs might be found. They had also given him a Latin appearance – a dashing Spanish beard-and-tash combo and cowboy clothes – as well as the nickname “Don Roberto” which, along with “the uncrowned king of the Scots,” stuck to him for most of his life.\n\nIt was listening to socialist speakers at public meetings that gave his moral sense a political structure. He attended lectures by the likes of William Morris, George Bernard Shaw and Keir Hardie, befriending these socialist pioneers and soon joining them as an effective orator.\n\nDon Roberto arrived in parliament having stood as a Liberal, but on an unmistakably socialist manifesto: nationalisation of land and industry, abolition of the House of Lords, universal suffrage, and free school meals. He didn’t stay with the Liberals for long, forming in 1888, with Keir Hardie, the Scottish Labour Party (not to be confused – though it would be hard to do so – with the currently extant organisation of the same name.)\n\nDespite his noble lineage, this rebel MP was immediately and deeply hated by the ruling class’s parliamentary wing. His charismatic humour, his intelligence, his wide knowledge of the world, and his skill in debating made fools of his opponents, and they didn’t appreciate it much. He was excluded from the House, like a disruptive schoolboy, on several occasions. A maiden speech in which he described parliament as a “dreary waste of mud and stucco” can’t have helped.\n\nGovernments wage a never-ending struggle to ban public protests, and almost every generation of citizenry has to fight to retain or extend their right to dissent (never more so than in 2024). Although most of Don Roberto’s time as a politician was devoted to supporting the 8-hour working day, trade unionism and better working conditions, and relief for the unemployed, he was also a leading fighter for civil liberties – and not just in parliament, but on the streets as well. For all his status, he was shown no favours when the state cracked down: Don Roberto MP was beaten, held without food, water or medical attention, and finally imprisoned for taking part in demonstrations.\n\nHe noted that in this “free country” the working man was free to starve – “That is a boon you can never take away from him” – but not free to attend meetings which the government disapproved of. (Some years later, he spent more months as a prisoner, this time in a mediaeval castle in the Atlas Mountains, while trying to reach a forbidden city. In disguise. As a sheik. But that’s another story.)\n\nDon Roberto lost his seat in parliament in 1892, and set off on his wanderings again. He became one of the most lauded travel writers of his time, admired by many of his most famous contemporaries.\n\nIn later life, Cunninghame Graham devoted most of his time to seeking self-government for Scotland. He had from his earliest days in politics supported Home Rule, but over time his position hardened and he advocated complete independence. When the Scottish National Party was formed in 1934, the result of a Frankenstein surgery stitching together bits of mutually antagonistic factions, Cunningham Graham became its joint president.\n\nWhen he died in a hotel in Buenos Aires aged 83, a nation mourned. Not his own nation, but Argentina where the body of this revered horseman, adventurer and friend of liberty lay in state while the Argentine president paid his respects.\n\nFriends with just about every significant figure of his era – along with Texan cowmen, Scots miners and Latin American revolutionaries – Don Roberto had been sculpted by Epstein, turned into a character by the playwright George Bernard Shaw and the novelists Joseph Conrad, HG Wells and John Galsworthy, and painted by John Lavery.\n\nI don’t think we’ve got room for the bizarre story of his brilliant wife, the Chilean-French writer and socialist Gabriela Marie de la Balmondière, who a family researcher in the 1980s discovered was actually a Yorkshirewoman named Carrie Horsfall, so we’ll end instead with Don Roberto’s verdict on Henry Campbell-Bannerman: “He has all the qualifications for a great Liberal Prime Minister. He wears spats and he has a beautiful set of false teeth.”\n\n*\n\nSources:\n\nRiot! by Ian Hernon (Pluto, 2006)\n\nhttps://clangrahamsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/donroberto.pdf\n\nwww.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/books/book-review-don-roberto-the-adventure-of-being-cunninghame-graham-by-james-jauncey-4193517"
