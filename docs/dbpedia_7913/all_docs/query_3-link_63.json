        "text": "This is one of several articles written by Louis Stott who generously offered local aspects of his scholarship to the archive of Loch Ard Local History Group–our thanks to Louis and his family for this material.\n\nKatharine Atholl, Her Grace the Duchess of Atholl, (1874-1960) was daughter of historian Sir James Ramsay, she became MP for Kinross and Perthshire in 1923 and was the first Conservative woman minister as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education (1924-29. Katharine was born in Edinburgh, in 1874. She was brought up at Bamff House, but the family moved to London.\n\nHer husband, Marquis of Tullibardine, succeeded to the title and estates (and a heavy debt) of Duke of Atholl in 1917. When Katharine stood for parliament in 1923 it was as Duchess of Atholl, becoming Scotland’s first woman MP (Perth and Kinross) and shortly afterwards, the conservative party’s first woman minister. She became an outspoken opponent of the appeasement policy of Neville Chamberlain, and was deselected by her constituency. She stood as an independent, but was defeated at a by-election in 1938.\n\nJ. F. L. Bateman (1810-1889), civil engineer: born in Halifax; early on in his career he became engaged on the Longdendale water works for the city of Manchester (1846-77) and later on the Thirlmere reservoir (1879); he superintended the supply of water to Glasgow from Loch Katrine, 1866-60, works “worthy to bear comparison with the most extensive aqueducts in the world not excluding those of ancient Rome” (James M. Gale): during this period he lived at Tigh na Traigh, Loch Ard; he constructed waterworks for many other authorities in Britain and abroad including those in Perth.\n\nSusanna Blamire (1747-94) Cumbrian poet whose sister, Sarah, married Col Thomas Graham in 1767. Between 1767 and his death in 1773 Susanna spent much time in Scotland with her sister. One of her lost poems celebrated the ‘Lake of Menteith’ while several others became famous songs. The DNB puts it thus: “As a song-writer she deserves to rank very high. She preferred to write songs in the Scottish dialect, and three at least of her songs are exquisite, ‘What ails this heart o’ mine?’, ‘And ye shall walk in silk attire’ (The Siller Croun), and ‘The Traveller’s Return’. Another beautiful song, ‘The Waefu’ Heart’, is, with great probability, attributed to her. In 1871, Sarah Tytler and J. L. Watson included her in The Songstresses of Scotland, asserting that she “adopted Scotland and the Scotch with enthusiasm, and thenceforth wrote Scotch songs like a Scotchwoman”.\n\nSir David Young Cameron.

He painted in both oils and watercolours; his subjects were mainly Scottish landscapes, such as Waiting for the Ferry: a Quiet Morning on Loch Awe (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1865). However, he also produced paintings of the English Lake District, Devon, and the home counties. He died, unmarried, at Dundarach, Aberfoyle, Perthshire, on 7 October 1876\n\nDavid Christison, secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, was one of the first to acknowledge the symbology, design and history of gravestones, using those in Aberfoyle, among others, as an illustration.

His father worked in Cox’s Bank, Charing Cross, London, and Edward began his working career there. But his ambitions did not allow him to stay for long in banking. He was strongly attracted to playing the bagpipes and to learning Scottish Gaelic, and he served in the London Scottish Volunteers, and later in similar units connected with the Argyll and Sutherland and the Seaforth regiments, playing in their pipe bands; by the 1890s he was using the name Ewen MacDonald as one more appropriate for a highland piper.\n\nDwelly left London in 1891 and took up work with the Ordnance Survey in Scotland. In 1896 he married Mary MacDougall at Doune, Perthshire. She was a native Gaelic speaker. It was about this time that he began to collect Gaelic vocabulary in a systematic way, corresponding with Gaels in many highland areas and recording local usages in a detailed way, as well as information about implements and practices that were already near the end of their lifespan, including a multiplicity of names for an early-morning dram of whisky. He also made extensive use of previously published Gaelic dictionaries. Lived in Gartmore\n\nCol Henry Robert Eyre (1842-1904).

In a note to Rob Roy, Scott speaks of him as one “whose urbanity in communicating information on the subject of national antiquities is scarce exceeded by the stores of legendary lore which he has accumu­lated.” He was long a member of the General Assembly’s committee for revising the Scriptures in Gaelic. He married. 9th Aug. 1790, Catherine Sommers, Greenock Publications: Sketches descriptive of Picturesque Scenery on the Southern Confines of Perthshire (Edinburgh, 1806, 1810, 1812); Essay on the Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian (Edinburgh, 1807); General View of the Agriculture of Stirling­shire (Edinburgh, 1812); General View of the Agriculture of Kinross and Clackmannan (Edinburgh, 1815); Account of the Parish, and its Zoology and Botany in Ac­count of Port of Menteith (Sinclair’s Stat.

The song begins:\n\nThen tell me how to woo thee love;\n\nO tell me how to woo thee!\n\nFor thy dear sake nae care I’ll take\n\nThough ne’er another trow me\n\nRobert Graham made several significant literary friendships. Hector MacNeil (1746-1818), the minor poet, was a frequent visitor to Gartmore 1786-90 when he lived near Stirling. Graham almost certainly met him in the West Indies, where he served as a tax collector. There he knew Smollett and was made one of the great author’s trustees. Robert Burns (1759-96) thought Graham “the noblest instance of great talents, great fortune, and great worth that ever I saw.” John Leyden (1775-1811) dedicated a book of poems to a Miss Graham of Gartmore, probably one of William’s daughters.\n\nRobert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, the celebrated writer and politician lived in Gartmore House until its upkeep became too much for him. A good account of Graham at Gartmore appears in Sir John Lavery’s A Painter’s Life [1940] He painted the famous portrait of Graham which G. B. Shaw used as a prototype both for Captain Brassbound, and for Major Bruntchli in Arms and the Man. It is in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow who also have a small bronze head by Epstein. At the Playing Field in Gartmore is the Cunninghame Graham Memorial which was erected in 1937 at Castlehill, Dumbarton, and removed to Gartmore in 1981.

She entered Gray’s School of Art in Aberdeen to study garden design, but quickly transferred to architecture, and was appointed lecturer in the history of art and architecture at Gray’s, She accepted a teaching post at Glasgow School of Art in 1920. She set up practice in Glasgow in 1920, and specialised in domestic architecture, particularly in kitchen design. She is considered Britain’s first practising woman architect.

She lived in Kippen in later life.\n\nHugh Kennedy (1826-1895) one-time Provost of Partick, and the contractor to the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle railway and very many other projects lived, at the end of his life in Corrienessan (then Ardend), specifically built for him. In Aberfoyle Kennedy was associated with the Railway and the Slate Quarry and the episcopal Church.\n\nReverend Robert Kirk [Kirk, Roibeart] was born in 1644 in Aberfoyle where his father (from Edinburgh) was minister, the first generation of his family to be born in the Highlands. He became the minister of Aberfoyle. He learned Classical Gaelic and was involved in the complete metrical translation of the Psalms when his wife Isabel Campbell (daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Mochester) died in 1680. These Psalms were published in 1684, dedicated to Lord John Murray of Atholl. His Gaelic vocabulary was printed in 1702, but his Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies (1691) brought him lasting fame. He died in 1692.\n\nColin Kirk, Writer to the Signet, (Robert Kirk’s son) married Jean, Margaret’s sister, who was second daughter to George Stirling of Herbertshire.\n\nRobert Macgregor, commonly called Rob Roy, (1671-1734) entrepreneur and highland freebooter; baptised, 7 March 1671, in Buchanan parish, but may have been born considerably earlier; in 1689 he was at the Battle of Killiecrankie; in 1691 he [or his father] was the leader of an exceptionally daring raid called the `Her’ship [robbery] of Kippen’; 1693 married Mary Helen, daughter of MacGregor of Comar; by 1693 he had `acquired an interest, by purchase, wadset, or otherwise, to the property of Craigroyston’; engaged in freebooting and cattle trading as a result of which he became indebted to Montrose; appeared to side with the Pretender in 1715; participated in rising in 1719; there were protracted disputes with Montrose including, about 1716, the seizure of Graham of Killearn and the surprise and capture of Rob at Balquhidder by Montrose, but he escaped; from 1722 he was held at Newgate for his Jacobite sympathies but released by1726; lived until his death in Balquhidder.\n\n“It was on account of the harsh action of the first Duke of Montrose (d. 1742) that Rob Roy Macgregor was driven to freebooting. Rob Roy had been very successful as a cattle dealer, and Montrose advanced him money to purchase cattle on condition that he should share in the profits. It so happened that the speculation of Roy on this occasion resulted in serious loss. Being unable to refund the money he was compelled to deliver up Craigroyston to the duke. From this time Roy maintained himself chiefly by robbing Montrose’s tenants; but, partly owing to the connivance of the Duke of Argyll, Montrose was baffled in his efforts to obtain redress.” [DNB]\n\nRob Roy had five sons: Coll, Ronald, James, Duncan, and Robert. Not long after his father’s death Robert shot Maclaren of Invernenty and was brought to trial, but the murder was found not proven. Young Robert enlisted in the 42nd regiment. James More distinguished himself on the side of the Pretender in the ’45, and was attainted for high treason, but succeeded in making his peace with the government. James, Duncan, and Robert forcibly abducted Jean Key or Wright, a young widow (who had inherited some property by the death of her husband), from Edinbellie, Balfron, Stirlingshire, in December 1750, and compelled her to marry young Robert. James Mór was tried in 1752. The jury brought in a special verdict of guilty in extenuating circumstances, but while the import of the verdict was under discussion he made his escape, and being outlawed went to France, where he died in great poverty in October 1754. Duncan, was tried in 1753 and found not guilty. Robert, who was apprehended in May 1753, and tried on 24 Dec. following, was condemned to death, and executed on 14 Feb.\n\nWilliam Gauld Maclagan (1903-1972) was Professor of Moral Philosophy, University of Glasgow, 1946-1969.

He was newly appointed when Boswell and Johnson were received at the University by the professors. Scott has him as one of the eyewitnesses of the kidnap in 1750 of Jean Key by the sons of Rob Roy. He used to describe as a terrible dream their violent and noisy entrance into the house where he was living The Highlanders filled the little kitchen, brandishing their arms, demanding what they pleased, and receiving whatever they demanded. Richardson was an accomplished minor poet and a prose writer of distinction. His areas of expertise included Shakespeare and Celtic superstitions. His Poems, Chiefly Rural was published in 1774. In ‘A Farewell to Aberfoyle’ Richardson refers to the waterfall near David Marshall Lodge.\n\nHow pleasing to my pensive mind\n\nThe memory of thy bold cascade\n\nAfter Robert Graham inherited Gartmore in 1775 Richardson moved there, and, Richardson having acquired a cottage at Bridgend of Gartmore, the two renewed an old acquaintanceship.

For the next few years, he and his wife spent half their time at Aberfoyle, where Sime painted landscapes. With some of his new wealth, Sime bought The Idler and installed himself as co-editor in 1899, but it proved a disastrous investment, and he sold up in 1901.
