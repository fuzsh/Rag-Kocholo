        "text": "No matter where I go on my travels, whether that’s here in Scotland or abroad, I usually find something or someone connected with Dumbarton.\n\nAnd so it was when I called in at the recently refurbished Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.\n\nI was hardly in the door of the gallery, which is in Queen Street and just a five-minute walk from Waverley Station, when I saw a familiar face.\n\nIt was a bust of Don Roberto, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, once of Ardoch estate at the foot of the Lea Brae on the Dumbarton-Helensburgh road.\n\nThe bronze is one of a number in the gallery by Sir Jacob Epstein.\n\nI was brought up in Brucehill where not just one but two streets are named after the great man – Bontine Avenue and Graham Road.\n\nI also often played football in the Monument Park on the Castlehill side of Cardross Road, where a monument stood in Don Roberto’s honour for many years.\n\nIt was so often vandalised however that his family had it taken away and re-erected near their estate at Gartmore in Stirlingshire.\n\n“Imagine Don Quixote walking about your studio and sitting for his portrait,” wrote Jacob Epstein in his autobiography.\n\n“This was RB Cunninghame Graham, and you could see him on horseback any day in Hyde Park on his small American Mustang, seated in a high saddle, riding along Rotten Row in a bowler hat.\n\n“He was no poseur, as many imagine. His distinguished appearance and bearing were natural. No man with easier manners, more debonair and courteous.”\n\nIt says this about the bust in the gallery brochure: “The sculptor emphasized his model’s worn, lop-sided features and broken nose and expressed their irregularities in a broken ‘impasted’ surface.”\n\nSir Jacob himself said: “In the head I modelled he seems to sniff the air, blowing from the Sierras, and his hair is swept by a breeze from afar.”\n\nSo, who was Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham – and why was he famous?\n\nBrucehill might have been one of the most deprived council housing estates in West Dunbartonshire, but it produced a remarkable number of bright young men and women who went on to do well in life.\n\nOne of them, Professor John Walker, who was brought up in Caledonia Terrace and who now lives in Canada, published collections of Cunninghame Graham’s South American Sketches (1978), Scottish Sketches (1982) and North American Sketches.\n\nProfessor Walker wrote a great deal about Graham, who was born in London in 1852 and became a prominent Scottish politician, writer, journalist and adventurer.\n\nGraham was a Liberal MP; the first-ever socialist member of the Westminster parliament; a founder, and the first president, of the Scottish Labour Party (1888-1893) and a founder of the National Party of Scotland in 1928. He became the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934.\n\nThe blood that ran through his veins was a mixture of military, Scottish and Spanish - his grandmother was a Spanish noblewoman Doña Catalina Paulina Alessandro de iménez – and the first language he learnt was his mother’s maternal tongue, Spanish.\n\nHe spent most of his childhood on the family estate of Finlaystone in Langbank – you can see the estate by looking across the River Clyde from Firthview Terrace in Brucehill – and Ardoch in Dumbarton.\n\nAfter being educated at Harrow, Graham went to Brussels and on to Argentina to make his fortune from cattle ranching. He became known as a great adventurer and gaucho there, and was affectionately known as Don Roberto.\n\nHe also travelled in Morocco disguised as a Turkish sheikh, prospected for gold in Spain, befriended Buffalo Bill in Texas, and taught fencing in Mexico City.\n\nHe travelled to Mexico by wagon train from San Antonio de Bexar with his bride Gabrielle Chidiock de la Balmondiere, a half French half Chilean poet.\n\nIn 1883 he came back to the UK and entered politics, attending socialist meetings where he heard and met William Morris, George Bernard Shaw and Keir Hardie.\n\nGraham quickly made his name as an impressive orator and became an MP espousing causes which ranged from the abolition of the House of Lords to votes for women, nationalisation of land and coal mines, free school meals and Scottish Home Rule.\n\nHe also campaigned for the establishment of an eight-hour working day. Graham was suspended from parliament for making what was called a “disrespectful reference” to the House of Lords.\n\nHe was the first MP ever to be thrown out of the Commons for swearing; the word was damn.\n\nGraham’s main concerns were the plight of the unemployed and civil liberties and he fought against attempts by the police to prevent public meetings and free speech.\n\nHe was jailed for six weeks after being arrested and badly beaten up at the Bloody Sunday protest demo in Trafalgar Square in 1887.\n\nOn independence, he is said to have joked that he wanted a “national parliament with the pleasure of knowing that the taxes were wasted in Edinburgh instead of London.”\n\nHe was a hero to many and he achieved so much, living into his eighties but there is an old saying about a prophet seldom being recognised in his own country.\n\nOne local woman once told me: “Socialist my tonsils (or words to that effect). He was a toff who would ride his horse around and around the field at Ardoch until one of the farmhands came to open the gate for him to get out.”\n\nHe died on March 20, 1936, in Buenos Aires and is buried beside his wife on the island of Inchmahome in the Lake of Menteith.\n\nAnyway, if you want to see this arresting Epstein bust of Don Roberto, head for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.\n\nI’ll tell you some more about items of local interest there, including portraits of Jimmy Logan and Lex McLean, next week."
