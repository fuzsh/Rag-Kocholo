        "text": "The Searchers, American western film, released in 1956, that is widely considered director John Ford’s masterpiece. It features John Wayne in one of his most-notable performances, portraying perhaps the most morally ambiguous character of his career.\n\nEthan Edwards (played by Wayne) is a mysterious drifter who arrives at the Texas ranch of his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) in the aftermath of the American Civil War. He is warmly greeted by Aaron and his family: his wife, Martha (Dorothy Jordan), and their daughters Lucy (Pippa Scott) and Debbie (played by both Lana Wood and Natalie Wood). Ethan is clearly a controversial figure, and there are implications that he has engaged in legally dubious actions. When Ethan and other local men are lured out to chase Native Americans who have stolen cattle, Aaron’s ranch is attacked by Scar (Henry Brandon), a feared Comanche chief, who murders Aaron and Martha and kidnaps their daughters. Enraged, Ethan embarks on an obsessive crusade to track down Scar and rescue the girls. He is initially joined by a local posse as well as Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a young man who is considered the Edwardses’ adopted son. Ethan’s hard-bitten ways eventually alienate most of his allies, but he and Martin continue their quest, even after they discover that Lucy has been murdered. The search goes on for years, with Ethan’s motivations coming under question as his racist anger toward Native Americans suggests that he might kill the girl he initially sought to save.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
