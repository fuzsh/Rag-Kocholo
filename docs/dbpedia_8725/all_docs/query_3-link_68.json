        "text": "We had so much fun writing last year’s list of bingeable book-to-screen adaptations that we decided to task two of the most prolific readers and pop culture consumers on our staff with the sequel. Keith and Sarah break down nine excellent films and TV series based on popular books for kids, teens, and adults.\n\nYou can check out part three here.\n\n÷ ÷ ÷\n\nKEITH'S PICKS FOR ADULTS\n\nJulieta\n\nAdapted from Runaway by Alice Munro\n\nI absolutely revere Pedro Almodóvar, the master filmmaker of Spain. It’s unusual, but not completely unprecedented, for him to adapt another writer’s work for one of his films. And in this case, he chose three stories by Canadian master of the short story, and Nobel laureate, Alice Munro. Already this film has an incredible pedigree, and I hope I don’t have to say anything more to sell you on it. Just imagine yourself in a James L. Brooks movie, in the back seat of a convertible. Up front, Almodóvar’s at the wheel and Munro is next to him. Everybody’s in sunglasses as you drive down a beach. Enjoy the ride.\n\nKim’s Convenience\n\nAdapted from Kim’s Convenience by Ins Choi\n\nTurning a play into a film usually involves changes at the margins, such as adding locations and cutting some dialogue. But to convert his hit play into a CBC sitcom, playwright Ins Choi (along with co-showrunner Kevin White) made numerous changes, like de-aging the entire Kim family. Comparing the play and the series is an interesting reflection on the different narrative arcs necessitated by the different mediums, and having two parallel views provides a richer understanding of all the characters, as well as of the immigrant experience in Canada. As a fun bonus, the House of Anansi Press’s edition of the script has extensive behind-the-scenes information about both the stage productions and the show.\n\nPassing\n\nAdapted from Passing by Nella Larsen\n\nThis one isn’t available yet, but will be on Netflix sometime this year. Adapted by British actress Rebecca Hall from Nella Larsen’s underappreciated novel of the same name, the film stars Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga and was shot in black and white. The premiere at Sundance was greeted with strong reviews, and I can’t wait to see it for myself.\n\nSARAH'S PICKS FOR KIDS AND TEENS\n\nPaddington and Paddington 2\n\nAdapted from Paddington by Michael Bond and Peggy Fortnum\n\nI have to admit, it took me a while to watch these movies. They seemed gimmicky or overwrought. How could an adaptation of Paddington in the 21st century even work? But after the first movie — and then the second — became critical darlings, I started to realize that I might be missing out. (I was.) These adaptations are more genuine, delightful, silly, and wonderful than they have any right to be. The Paddington films are movie magic at its best. Somehow, they take Michael Bond’s friendly, marmalade-loving bear with a hat and the occasional hard stare and do him justice. Not only do they successfully modernize the tale — these books did begin publishing in the ’50s — they manage to do so without sacrificing charm or cheapening the story, all while achieving critical success.\n\nHeads up: The third film just went into production, so here’s your chance to catch up and be ready when it’s released.\n\nThe Mysterious Benedict Society\n\nAdapted from The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart\n\nFinally, a Mysterious Benedict Society adaptation (and a show on this list airing right now)! As I’m writing this, we’re four episodes into this show’s eight-episode Disney Plus run and so far it’s a delight. Like all the best children’s shows, this one owes its success to the young actors bringing its protagonists to life. This show lets the young characters be smart and funny while nodding to the wild, weird experience of being a kid. Its supporting cast of adults is nothing to balk at either, headed by Arrested Development’s Tony Hale as the eponymous Mr. Benedict and supported by the ever-funny Kristen Schaal."
