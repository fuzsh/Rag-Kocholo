        "text": "Where Westerns were Born\n\nSince 1925, nearly 200 feature-length films have been made in the “Moab to Monument Valley region” of southeastern Utah.\n\nThe first 3 films made here were based on novels by Zane Grey.\n\nWhen Zane Grey first visited the region in 1906 he became inspired to write stories about the landscapes and local characters he encountered. He returned frequently and generated dozens of novels that became the cornerstones of “Western” fiction.\n\nRainbow Bridge\n\nAn important location in Navajo, Hopi, Ute, and Paiute belief systems, this formation also inspired some of the first “Western” novels Zane Grey ever wrote. Those works became the first movies made in southeastern Utah, spreading images and scenery from the Moab to Monument Valley region around the world.\n\nImage courtesy the New York Public Library.\n\n10 of the movies made in this region were classic Westerns made by the celebrated director John Ford, including the picture that made John Wayne a Hollywood star: Stagecoach (1939).\n\nA decade later in 1949, Moab ranch owner George White brought John Ford to a picturesque stretch of the Colorado River with a view of red rock spires and snow-capped mountains. The director didn’t hesitate to use the location for almost every scene in his next Western, Wagonmaster (1950).\n\nThe organization evolved to become the Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission in 1993, and is considered to be the longest continually operating film commission in the country, if not the world.\n\nThanks in part to their efforts, within a year the legendary director John Ford filmed several movies at the White’s ranch or within a few miles of the property, ushering in a wave of filmmakers and studios eager to utilize the region’s picturesque landscape for their latest motion picture.\n\nJohn Ford returned to the Moab area to use the White’s ranch as the setting for Rio Grande in 1950 and his last Western, Cheyenne Autumn, in 1965.\n\nJohn Ford\n\nAlthough controversial and contrarian, “Pappy”, as he was called, undoubtedly defined the Western film genre. His use of landscapes southeastern Utah in nearly a dozen films gives the Moab to Monument Valley area the nickname “John Ford Country”.\n\nImage of John Ford (left) on set at the White Ranch during the filming of Rio Grande courtesy of Harold B. Lee Library, L. Tom Perry Special Collection Photo Archives, BYU.\n\nIn total, John Ford directed nearly a dozen notable Westerns in the Moab to Monument Valley region, and he remains the most celebrated director in Academy Award history.\n\nHis classic films tied the landscape of southeastern Utah to the mythos of the American West and engrained the iconic red rock formations into the hearts of moviegoers around the world.\n\nIn 2002, the Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission and Red Cliffs Lodge established the Moab Museum of Film and Western Heritage on the White’s ranch property."
