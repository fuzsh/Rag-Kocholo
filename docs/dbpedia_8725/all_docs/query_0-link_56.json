        "text": "With Friday’s theatrical release of “The Ballad of Lefty Brown,” next week’s arrival of the superb movie “Hostiles” and “Godless” shootin’ up the ol’ Netflix, we’re a seeing an encouraging revival of the Western that . . .\n\nTarnation! I can’t do this again. I’ve written stories about the return of Westerns every few years since the 1980s, and it’s giving me saddle sores. Look folks, what had been Hollywood’s most reliable action/mythic/sociological metaphoric/guys-in-hats-singing genre from the dawn of the sound era to 1980 bit the dust more than three decades ago, and all the “Dances with Wolves,” “Unforgivens,” “Deadwoods,” “Django Unchaineds” and “Revenants” since then have not resuscitated it as a regular, viable thing.\n\nMaybe that’s for the best. Great as the best Westerns were and always will be, the category as a whole rested on dubious assumptions, like it’s OK to steal others’ land, white makes right, and everything can be solved with guns.\n\nNot saying that meant Westerns deserved to end up on boot hill. Films reveal a lot about the cultures they come from, and whether they intended to be instructional or not, horse operas revealed more about America than any other kinds of movies. The current ones each do a fine job of that in their own ways, and it’s significant that each is built around a particular aspect of the closing of the Old West in the run-up to the 20th century: Imposing corrupt political order on the new states/formerly wild territories (“Lefty Brown”), coming to terms with the animating hatreds that conquered the frontier (“Hostiles”), armed women who ain’t gonna take all of your cowboy crap anymore (“Godless”).\n\nAll of which gets me to thinking: Which Westerns were responsible for killing the Western? The ones that exploded the genre’s underlying assumptions, of course, and/or lost their producers a trainload of money. These also tended to be some of the best Westerns ever made, naturally; they were driven by ideas more than action, though the good ones delivered plenty of the latter too.\n\nHere are five movies that shot the genre where it hurt. All of ’em – even the last one if you’ve got the time to waste on the director’s cut – are worth seeing for much more than that.\n\n1. The Searchers: Weird that a film from 1956, near the pinnacle of movie Westerns’ popularity and at the start of their decade dominating television, should be looked at as the beginning of the end, right pardner? Well, let’s see. Director John Ford had nearly single-handedly whipped the genre out of its sleepy shoot-’em-up/singing cowboy malaise with the kinetic, iconic and flat-out thrilling “Stagecoach” in 1939. He spent the decade after World War II establishing the manifest particulars of Hollywood’s Western legend with the likes of “My Darling Clementine,” “Wagon Master” and the cavalry trilogy “Fort Apache,” “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon” and “Rio Grande,” films built to last as long as the sandstone mesas he loved in Monument Valley and John Wayne’s granite presence.\n\nImagine, then, the shock to the triumphalist system of Ford casting Wayne as “Searchers’” unreconstructed racist Ethan Edwards, pathologically determined to find his niece that the Comanches captured as a girl, and kill her if she’s slept with one of them as a woman. Even the Anthony Mann/Jimmy Stewart psychological Westerns that had shadowed Ford’s folksier masterpieces didn’t sport a hero this psycho. The Good Guy idea would never be the same. And Ford – in that perfect final shot of civilization safely entering the cabin to celebrate while the monster who made that possible stays, unwelcome now, outside the door – showed us that he knew it.\n\n2. A Fistful of Dollars: Sergio Leone’s 1964 remake of Akira Kurosawa’s samurai send-up “Yojimbo” established a cynical, selfish, untrustworthy Western hero in Clint Eastwood’s Man with No Name, perfect for the dawning ’60s attitude of blurring the lines between outlaw and hero and questioning established morality. The gorgeously grimy look of Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns – the two Eastwood follow-ups “For a Few Dollars More” and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” his unshaven epic “Once Upon a Time in the West” and the destructively comic “Duck, You Sucker” – laid a subversive variant of Italian Neorealism on Hollywood’s idealized view of history, and the studios simply could not fall back on their cleaner version after that.\n\n3. The Wild Bunch: No American director wove the closing of the West and the crumbling of the movies that celebrated it together better than Sam Peckinpah. He made more modest passes at the subject in “Ride the High Country” and “The Ballad of Cable Hogue.” But this 1969 blowout, set in 1913 during the Mexican Revolution, killed everything that moved. Outlaw codes, unbridled masculinity, horse travel, how being a good shot could get you out of just about any predicament – Peckinpah mowed down standard movie concepts like that newfangled machine gun took everyone out. And he did it with a violence and speed (both shockingly rapid and graphically slo-mo) many Americans weren’t prepared for, but needed to see.\n\n4. Little Big Man: Hollywood sporadically portrayed Indians sympathetically since at least the 1950 “Broken Arrow” (Ford even attempted to, not very well, in his last Western, 1964’s “Cheyenne Autumn”). By 1970 the paradigm shifted forever with Arthur Penn’s picaresque dark comedy about the sole white survivor of Custer’s Last Stand. Raised by Cheyennes, Dustin Hoffman’s Jack Crabb wanders a frontier of nutty, dangerous settlers and not always noble, but nicely defined, Native Americans. It’s hilarious and heartbreaking, capped by Chief Dan George’s disappointed, still-living Old Lodge Skins’ acceptance that things don’t always end the way you want them to: “Sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn’t.”\n\nThat sentiment would apply to the dying Western for the next 10 years. Penn went on to do another one with Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson at the peaks of their popularity, “The Missouri Breaks,” but it was unexpectedly one of 1976’s worst box office failures. The following year a little passion project that transferred Western tropes to outer space, “Star Wars,” put another big nail in the genre’s coffin, which was finally sealed by:"
