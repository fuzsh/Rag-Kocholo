Wagon Train debuted on September 18, 1957 and reached the top of the Nielsen ratings. It is the fictional adventure story of a large westbound wagon train through the American frontier from Missouri to California. Its format attracted famous guest stars for each episode appearing as travelers or residents of the settlements that the regular cast encountered.[1] The show initially starred supporting film actor Ward Bond as the wagon master (replaced after his death in 1960 by John McIntire) and Robert Horton as the scout (eventually replaced by Robert Fuller).\n\nThe series was inspired by the 1950 film Wagon Master[2] and the 1930 early widescreen film The Big Trail, both featuring Bond.\n\nThe series influenced the development of Star Trek, pitched as \"Wagon Train to the stars\" and launched in 1966.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series chronicles the adventures of a wagon train from St. Joseph, Missouri, across the plains of the Midwestern United States and the Rocky Mountains to Sacramento, California. It features the trials of the series regulars, who conducted the train through the American West.\n\nEpisodes revolve around the stories of guest characters portraying members of the massive wagon train or encountered by it. Many starring roles were played by already famous actors such as Ernest Borgnine, Bette Davis, Jane Wyman, Ronald Reagan, Lee Marvin, and Joseph Cotten. Episode titles routinely emphasize the guest characters, such as \"The Willy Moran Story\" and \"The Echo Pass Story\".\n\nAs a favor to Ward Bond, film director John Ford joined the show to direct a 1960 segment titled \"The Colter Craven Story\", which includes many members of the \"John Ford Stock Company\", momentarily featuring John Wayne speaking from the shadows and billed in the credits as \"Michael Morris\".[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe regular cast includes:\n\nWard Bond as wagon master Major Seth Adams (1957–61, seasons 1–4). Bond died of a heart attack in the middle of the fourth season, and was replaced by John McIntire as wagon master. No explanation was ever given on the show.\n\nRobert Horton as scout Flint McCullough (1957–62, seasons 1–5).\n\nJohn McIntire as Christopher Hale (1961–65, seasons 4–8), replacing Bond as wagon master upon Bond's death. McIntire had guest starred in a Season 3 episode in the role of preacher Andrew Hale, apparently Christopher's brother according to a reference made by Christopher later in the series.\n\nRobert Fuller as scout Cooper Smith (1963–65, seasons 7–8) replacing the McCullough character after Robert Horton left the series. Fuller had previously played a lead in the Western series Laramie and physically resembled Horton. Fuller and McIntire rotated top billing from week to week on the series. Fuller even shared the same birthday as Horton, albeit nine years apart.\n\nFrank McGrath as cook Charlie Wooster (1957–65, seasons 1–8), one of only two regulars to last the entire series.\n\nTerry Wilson as Bill Hawks (1957–65, seasons 1–8), was one of only two regulars to last the entire series.\n\nMichael Burns as Barnaby West (1960–65, seasons 6–8).\n\nScott Miller (aka; Denny Miller) as Duke Shannon (1961–64, seasons 4–7).\n\nChick Hannan[4] in various roles (1957–65, seasons 1–8), mostly as a wagon train member.\n\nIn the first four seasons Ward Bond was billed above Robert Horton in the opening credits. In season five Horton rotated top billing with relative newcomer John McIntire, a practice which subsequently continued with McIntire and Robert Fuller rotating top billing from episode to episode when Fuller joined the series in the seventh season.\n\nDuring the sixth season, Horton had left and Fuller had not yet replaced him, so McIntire carried the show with the supporting cast. Neither Bond nor McIntire, both veterans of dozens of supporting roles in movies, routinely had a leading role in theatrical films, although Bond did in at least one B-picture. Rivals Bond and Horton frequently quarreled on the set, an extensively publicized development at the time, while their characters disputed within the episodes.[5] According to Scott Eyman in his biography of John Wayne, Bond's jealousy of Horton was fueled by Horton receiving more fan mail. Eyman stated Bond would try to limit Horton's screen time and interfere with any good lines Horton might be given in the scripts. They eventually reconciled shortly before Bond's death.[5]\n\nGuest stars\n\n[edit]\n\nClaude Akins appeared in four episodes during the show's first four seasons.\n\nAnna Maria Alberghetti carried the lead in \"The Conchita Vasquez Story\" (1959), cast as part of a gang of Comancheros who intend to attack the wagon train to steal rifles headed to the United States Army. Conchita decides to leave the Comancheros and move west after she falls in love with the scout Flint McCullough, but she is killed by a bullet from her own people when they ambush the wagon train.\n\nEddie Albert appeared as Kurt Davos in the 1962 episode \"The Kurt Davos Story\" as a blacksmith forced to leave the train by a crippling injury.\n\nRoscoe Ates appeared in the 1958 episode \"The Sacramento Story\" in his later familiar role of \"Old Timer\".\n\nParley Baer appeared in three episodes in different seasons, usually as a disgruntled passenger.\n\nCarla Balenda appeared as Martha Leeds in \"The Annie Duggan Story\" (1963), credited as Sally Bliss.\n\nMartin Balsam appeared as Marcey Jones in the 1964 episode \"The Whipping\".\n\nTrevor Bardette, as Will Rudge in \"The Levi Hale Story\" (1962), as Sheriff Lund in \"The Lily Legend Story\" and as Henry Ludlow in \"The Antone Rose Story\" (both 1963).\n\nWilliam Bendix, in the second season, played a sea captain who had shanghaied Adams and Wooster in \"Around the Horn\".\n\nCharles Bickford and Roger Smith, five months before Smith was cast on 77 Sunset Strip, appear in \"The Daniel Barrister Story\", which aired on 16 April 1958 (Season 1, Episode 29). In this segment, Daniel Barrister, played by Bickford, objects to medical treatment for his wife, Jenny, the victim of a wagon accident. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter H. Culver, played by Smith, has successfully fought a smallpox epidemic in a nearby town. He is brought to the wagon train by scout Flint McCullough to treat Mrs. Barrister. Viewers never know if Barrister yielded to allow Dr. Culver to treat Jenny.\n\nTheodore Bikel appeared in \"The Dr. Denker Story\", season five, episode 14, in the role of a traveling musician who is transporting a mysterious shipment of dynamite to San Francisco for the United States Army.\n\nErnest Borgnine appeared five times on Wagon Train, including twice as \"Willy Moran\" (albeit for only a few moments in Moran's second appearance). In the pilot episode on 18 September 1957, Borgnine's Moran is revealed as a former boxer consumed by alcoholism but seeking sobriety. Michael Winkelman guest starred as young \"Ben Palmer\" in this episode, as he was beginning his regular role as Little Luke McCoy on ABC's The Real McCoys. On 1 October 1958, Borgnine reprised the role of Willy Moran in the episode \"Around the Horn\". Major Adams had fought with Moran at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nNeville Brand appeared in \"The Zebedee Titus Story\" in 1964 as an aging pioneer who joins the wagon train as a scout.\n\nHenry Brandon appeared six times, most notably in \"The St. Nicholas Story\" (1959).\n\nJohn Carradine appeared in supporting roles in the 1958 episode. \"The Dora Gray Story\", and the 1960 episode, \"The Colter Craven Story\".\n\nLon Chaney Jr. appeared as Louis Roque in \"The Jose Morales Story\", Season 4, episode 5 (1960), and in the 1961 episode, \"The Chalice\", as Carstairs.\n\nJan Clayton and Beulah Bondi highlight \"The Prairie Story\", written by Jean Holloway, which examines how the forbidden prairie, particularly the strong wind, plays havoc on the lives of the women on the wagon train. This theme is also examined in the novel The Wind by Dorothy Scarborough. Robert Horton carries the lead in this episode that aired on 1 February 1961, three months after the death of Ward Bond.\n\nJeanne Cooper guest stars in an episode titled \"The Whipping\" shown during season 7 (1963–64) of Wagon Train.\n\nLou Costello appeared as the title character in one of his last roles, \"The Tobias Jones Story\" (1958).

After an accident, Cliff and Flint are stranded in the wild, trying to survive until they can reach a small town. This was one of Dan Duryea's rare \"sympathetic\" roles, and one that he would reprise for the final Wagon Train episode of the same season.[6] In his fourth appearance on Wagon Train, he played a mentally unstable man obsessed by demons and superstitions in \"The Bleymier Story\", broadcast 16 November 1960, eleven days after the death of Ward Bond.

The theme was conducted by Revue musical director Stanley Wilson. In the second season, a new more modern sounding theme was introduced. \"(Roll Along) Wagon Train\" was written by Sammy Fain and Jack Brooks and sung by Johnny O'Neill. About midway through the second season this was replaced with an instrumental version by Stanley Wilson. In the third season a more traditional sounding score was introduced. \"Wagons Ho!\" was written and conducted by Jerome Moross, who adapted it from a passage of music he had written for the 1959 film The Jayhawkers. This theme would last through the series' run and is the most remembered Wagon Train theme. Stanley Wilson re-recorded \"Wagons Ho!\" when the series went to color in 1963, then an abbreviated version of the 1963 re-recorded theme was used for the final season when it returned to black-and-white.[11]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nTaking inspiration from John Ford's 1950 film Wagon Master, Revue Productions conceived of a semi-anthology series with an emphasis on strong storytelling and quality direction with weekly guest stars known for their work in motion pictures and other media but retaining a regular cast of characters to provide a touchstone for audiences.\n\nAt an initial budget of US$100,000 (equivalent to $1,085,000 in 2023) per segment, Wagon Train episodes cost over 40% more than most contemporary hour-long Westerns, allowing it to film on location in California's San Fernando Valley and afford its expensive guest stars.[12]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal broadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show ran for 284 episodes over 8 seasons: the first aired on September 18, 1957, and the final segment was broadcast on May 2, 1965.\n\nThe series aired for most of its run as hour-long episodes in black-and-white except for five episodes during the 1961-62 season which were produced and broadcast in color to promote NBC's parent company RCA's color television sets. After its move to ABC the show mirrored \"The Virginian\" on NBC by filming in color and expanding to 90 minutes. In its final and eighth season and due to declining ratings,the show returned to its hour format and was filmed in black and white.\n\nSyndication\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen the original Ward Bond episodes were broadcast weekday afternoons on ABC beginning in 1963, a new series title \"Seth Adams Trailmaster\" was given to the episode to avoid viewer confusion because Wagon Train was still on the ABC evening schedule. A new theme song, the \"Trailmaster Theme\", written and conducted by Stanley Wilson, was used for these syndicated episodes. The later episodes from the John McIntire era were syndicated under the simpler title \"Trailmaster.\" All episodes eventually reverted to their original titling after the series left the air. The 75-minute episodes were usually syndicated separately, sometimes shown on local stations as \"movies.\"[citation needed]\n\nOne episode very seldom shown is \"Princess of the Lost Tribe\" (season 4 episode 6, shown 6 Nov 1960), in which Flint McCullough happens upon the hiding place of descendants of the Aztec Indians - now moved up from central Mexico to the vicinity of Arizona, with Raymond Massey playing their king, Montezuma IX, speaking English with flawless educated diction.\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004 Alpha Video released three episodes of Wagon Train on DVD. Four years later Timeless Media Group released a DVD selection consisting of 12 episodes on three discs. Also in 2008, it released The Complete Color Season, a 16 disc box set with season seven and 16 select episodes from the other seasons. From 2010 to 2013, Timeless Media Group released the series in eight box sets of one season each, and the seventh season lacks the bonus episodes.[13]: 89\n\nCultural influences\n\n[edit]\n\nGene Roddenberry said he pitched Star Trek as \"Wagon Train to the stars\", referring to the concept of a recurring cast on a long journey with famous guest stars becoming the focus of various stories. In his March 11, 1964, initial pitch document, he wrote, \"Star Trek is a Wagon Train concept—built around characters who travel to worlds 'similar' to our own.\"[14]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
