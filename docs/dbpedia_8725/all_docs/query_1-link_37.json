        "text": "Return with me now to those thrilling days of yesteryear (or about a half-century ago) when the television screens were ablaze with tales of the Old West (as it rarely was).\n\nToday’s review of TV Westerns focuses on one of the most popular.\n\nThe series ran for a total of 284 episodes, most of them black-and-white. It premiered on NBC in September 1957 and switched to ABC in September 1962 where it traveled on for three more years.\n\nI can say traveled on because the show was “Wagon Train.”\n\nThe inspiration for “Wagon Train” probably came from John Ford’s fine 1950 Western, “Wagonmaster.”\n\nThe movie starred Ward Bond as the leader of a wagon train of Mormons heading across the desert to Utah. A young Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. joined the train to help them deal with Indians, the elements and outlaws.\n\nIn addition to Ward Bond as the wagonmaster, the TV Western featured an ensemble cast with Robert Horton as Flint McCullough, scout, Frank McGrath as Charlie Wooster, cook, and Terry Wilson as Bill Hawks, assistant wagonmaster and lead wagon driver.\n\nEach year the wagon train would depart St. Joe, Mo., making its way west to California. Along the way there was a high volume of endless adventures and encounters with interesting characters.\n\nThe element that made the series special was the weekly character studies of the folks met along the trail. Some weeks the regulars were only seen in secondary roles.\n\nIn its eight-year run, the “Wagon Train” had only two wagonmasters. When Ward Bond died in 1960, Major Seth Adams was replaced by John McIntire as Chris Hale. Horton quit the next year and Robert Fuller as Cooper Smith joined the cast.\n\nThe continuing infusion of guest stars actually made the series seem as though there was a new Western every week.\n\n“Wagon Train” spent three years placing a close second to “Gunsmoke” before it became the No. 1 program on television for the 1961-62 season. Following the show’s demise on network TV, “Wagon Train” went into syndication under other titles.\n\nTrue to Western form, it’s probably still riding off into the sunset on some channel yet today.\n\n• “Look into my eyes.” Roughly 10 to 15 percent of people react with either complete acceptance or total rejection of hypnotism attempts.\n\n• “We’re No. 2.” The First State Bank of Norton, Kansas houses an unusual collection. The mezzanine is decorated with portraits of those who ran for president of the United States and finished second. In addition to the picture, there is a short biography of each person. Recent entries include John Kerry, John McCain and Mitt Romney, while lesser-knowns such as Gen. Lewis Cass are also included. It’s called the Also Ran Gallery.\n\n• A typical American housewife — are there any remaining? — walks an average of 594 miles per year in her “job.”\n\n• Richard M. Nixon was the first American president to visit all 50 states while he was in office.\n\n• “I wonder if poets get paid by the line,” said Tom perversely."
