        "meta_description": "One of John Ford's favorite of his own films, Wagon Master is beautifully shot and filled with warmth and relatively light-hearted adventure, without remotely being what one might call an action picture. Two genial cowboys (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.) sign on to lead a wagon train of Mormons across brutal territory. The only real conflict, besides the elements, comes from a largely dimwitted family of outlaws who take advantage of the train for their own illegal ends. A modern-day version of this story would undoubtedly be far more violent and disturbing. But Ford seems less interested in violence",

        "text": "One of John Ford's favorite of his own films, Wagon Master is beautifully shot and filled with warmth and relatively light-hearted adventure, without remotely being what one might call an action picture. Two genial cowboys (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.) sign on to lead a wagon train of Mormons across brutal territory. The only real conflict, besides the elements, comes from a largely dimwitted family of outlaws who take advantage of the train for their own illegal ends. A modern-day version of this story would undoubtedly be far more violent and disturbing. But Ford seems less interested in violence than in revealing his somewhat romanticized view of life in a community of travelers, a theme he was no stranger to. Many of the rituals associated with Ford's work, rituals both of character behavior and of his own cinematic style, are heavily engaged herein. The incessant earworm music of Stan Jones's song score is a drawback to full enjoyment, and the greatest joys are in watching skillful men handle horses and wagons while a masterly skillful director styles the photography of them. Ben Johnson is easy-going and likable in one of his few top-billed roles, but most of the rest of the cast (Carey, Ward Bond, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, and Alan Mowbray) adhere to performances that quite formally Fordian but not particularly real. I bow to no one in my admiration for Ford, my favorite director, but despite the beauty and coherence of this film, it has comparatively little of the power I associate with the best of Ford, such as The Searchers, The Informer, The Long Voyage Home, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. That it, along with the equally easy-going The Sun Shines Bright were among Ford's favorite and most personal films says a great deal about the contrast between what I think makes Ford great and what he appreciated about his own work. This is a very good film, but it's a bit of a daisy when compared to the redwoods I listed above."
