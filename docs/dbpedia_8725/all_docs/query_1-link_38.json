        "text": "Directed by…\n\nJohn Ford is one of the most significant figures in American film history – he made John Wayne into a star, influenced future generations of filmmakers like Orson Welles, Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino, and he remains the most decorated director in Academy Award history.\n\nMemorable Scenes\n\nWagonmaster is filled with John Ford’s classic “Irish humor”, some songs from the famous Sons of Pioneers, and of course, the spectacular scenery of Moab – most of it was filmed a few miles from the Museum in an area known as Fisher Towers.\n\nThe film inspired the beloved television series Wagon Train, which also starred Ward Bond.\n\nJohn Ford\n\nAlthough he made hundreds of movies, Wagonmaster was said to be one of John Ford’s personal favorites, one that he was most proud of. It tells the story of Mormon pioneers coming to Utah, and the characters of the American West that they meet along the way.\n\nLocal Importance\n\nThe first full length movie ever made in the Moab area, it prompted George White to form what would become the Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission.\n\nSince 1949, that organization has been attracting and supporting filmmakers to the region.\n\nGeorge White’s wife Essie Larsen White was hired to be a stand-in for one of the female stars and the White’s dog, Lucky, even makes an appearance pulling on one of the stars’ pant legs.\n\nEssie is seen on the right in costume near the set.\n\nE"
