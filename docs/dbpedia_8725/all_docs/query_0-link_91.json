        "text": "Eighty-one years ago, the still quite young art of motion pictures hit a pinnacle that, to this day, most film buffs consider unequaled. \"Gone with the Wind\", \"The Wizard of Oz, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"... you know the score. But has anyone bothered to comb through every subsequent year to verify if this assumption holds water? Is '39 just an easy point of reference, or is it really, truly The Greatest Year in Cinema History? This is just one man's opinion, but having pored over fairly complete lists of releases from the last eight decades, there might be one or two years that top ol' '39. And given that directors tended to take greater care with their shot composition and lighting in the predigital days, don't be surprised if the last decade isn't well-represented on this list.\n\n2 of 50\n\n1978\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne of the weaker years of the decade, but horror continued to pick up the slack, while many of the era’s heavy hitters misfired or tried to get themselves killed in the Philippines. George A. Romero’s facility for blending social commentary with crowd-pleasing/repelling gore peaked with “Dawn of the Dead” and “Martin,\" while John Carpenter’s runaway indie hit “Halloween” turned the slasher film into a reliable profit generator for the next decade (while nearly destroying the horror genre in the process). While we’re talking profitability, John Landis single-handedly created the market for profane, snobs-vs.-slobs sex comedies with “National Lampoon’s Animal House.\" Malick followed up “Badlands” with the ineffably lovely “Gates of Heaven,\" while Scorsese revolutionized the concert film with “The Last Waltz.\" Also of note: De Palma’s “The Fury,\" Cimino’s “The Deer Hunter,\" Ashby’s “Coming Home,\" Altman’s “A Wedding,\" Schrader’s “Blue Collar”, Mazursky’s “An Unmarried Woman,\" Noyce’s “Newsfront,\" Walter Hill’s “The Driver,\" Errol Morris’ “Gates of Heaven,\" Dante’s “Piranha,\" Liu Chia-liang’s “The 36thChamber of Shaolin” and Kaufman’s “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\n11 of 50\n\n1945\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe nascent Italian neorealism movement blossomed in 1945 with the release of Roberto Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City,\" which was shot in and around the bombed-out ruins of the city with cobbled together equipment and mostly non-actors (aside from Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi). The French film industry was also getting back up to speed with treasures like Marcel Carné’s “Children of Paradise,\" Jacques Becker’s “Paris Frills” and Robert Bresson’s “Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne” (though Jean Renoir and Réné Clair went abroad for, respectively, “The Southerner” and “And Then There Were None”). The year’s best film by far was David Lean’s railway station romance, “Brief Encounter” (possibly the director’s finest work), while films noir were all the double-crossing rage (e.g. Preminger’s “Scarlett Street,\" Edgar Ulmer’s “Detour” and Joseph H. Lewis’ “My Name Is Julia Ross”). Wilder’s no-frills depiction of alcoholism in “The Lost Weekend” won Best Picture, while Michael Curtiz did fine melodramatic work with “Mildred Pierce.\" Hitchcock turned in the fascinating but flawed “Spellbound”.\n\n16 of 50\n\n1958\n\nGetty Images\n\nHitchcock’s “Vertigo”, Welles’ “Touch of Evil” and Kurosawa’s “The Hidden Fortress” (George Lucas’ “Star Wars” blueprint) in the same year — it’s hard to find a more cinematically significant year than this. It’s not, however, all that difficult to find a better overall assortment, which knocks this year down a few pegs. Don Siegel’s “The Lineup” is a nose-buster of a B movie, Terence Fisher’s “Horror of Dracula” got Hammer’s bloodsucker franchise off to a bloody great start (never a better Drac/Van Helsing duo than Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing), Mann’s “Man of the West” is one of his best oaters, Nicholas Ray’s “Party Girl” is a deliciously nasty noir, Budd Boetticher’s “Buchanan Rides Alone” is an above-average Randolph Scott collaboration, “The 7th Voyage of Sinbad” is a Technicolor Ray Harryhausen showcase, and, well, who doesn’t love “The Blob?\" But Hitch and Welles are doing a lot of heavy lifting here.\n\n18 of 50\n\n1962\n\nGetty Images\n\nFour masterpieces (“Lawrence of Arabia,\" “Jules and Jim,” “L’Eclisse” and “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance”) and a whole lot of very good to great. As was the case throughout most of the ‘60s, the best films were being made outside of Hollywood: Kurosawa’s “Sanjuro,\" Buñuel’s “The Exterminating Angel,\" Pasolini’s “Mamma Roma,\" Godard’s “My Life to Live,\" Ozu’s “An Autumn Afternoon,\" Rosi’s “Salvatore Giuliano” and Tarkovsky’s “Ivan’s Childhood.\" Kubrick took to England to shoot “Lοlita” and never returned. Back in America (though far from Hollywood), the ultra-moody indie horror classic “Carnival of Souls” predicted the DIY rise of “Night of the Living Dead.\" Studio-wise, Aldrich was in fine form with “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” Frankenheimer turned in the frighteningly prophetic “The Manchurian Candidate” and Peckinpah started in with his Western revisionism on “Ride the High Country.\" Perhaps most significantly, the James Bond franchise got kicked off with “Dr. No.\" Also important: The utterly unclassifiable sci-fi/horror flick “The Manster” finally hit theaters.\n\n19 of 50\n\n1979\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt’s hard to find a theme in the final year of The Decade that Saved American Cinema. The New Hollywood phenoms were mostly in exquisite form — Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now,\" Ashby’s “Being There,\" Allen’s “Manhattan,\" Fosse’s “All That Jazz” (and some maniacs would make a case for Spielberg’s theatrical cut of “1941”) — but the filmmakers that would dominate the ‘80s were definitely on the rise. Ridley Scott’s “Alien,\" Walter Hill’s “The Warriors,\" Ivan Reitman’s “Meatballs” and George Miller’s “Mad Max” were, in one way or another, supercharged entertainments; they were aimed squarely at the pleasure center. Not terribly concerned with the pleasure center: Tarkovsky’s “Stalker,\" Fassbinder’s magnificent “The Marriage of Maria Braun,\" Joan Micklin Silver’s “Chilly Scenes of Winter,\" Kieslowski’s “Camera Buff,\" Schlöndorff’s “The Tin Drum” and Benton’s “Kramer vs. Kramer.\" Also notable: Cronenberg’s “The Brood,\" Miyazaki’s “The Castle of Cagliostro,\" Reiner’s “The Jerk,\" Meyer’s “Time After Time,\" “Monty Python’s Life of Brian,\" Ballard’s “The Black Stallion,\" Hiller’s “The In-Laws” and “Richard Pryor – Live in Concert.\"\n\n29 of 50\n\n1980\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"The year that gave us not just Ruggero Deodato’s “Cannibal Holocaust\" but also Antonio Margheriti’s “Cannibal Apocalypse.\" And “Raging Bull.\" Just an insane year before you factor in the rest of it. But factor we shall! Fassbinder’s 15-and-a-half-hour “Berlin Alexanderplatz,\" Kurosawa’s comeback “Kagemusha,\" Kershner’s “Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back,\" De Palma’s “Dressed to Kill,\" Malle’s “Atlantic City,\" Kubrick’s “The Shining,\" Mackenzie’s “The Long Good Friday,\" Rush’s “The Stunt Man” and Resnais’ “Mon oncle d’Amérique.\" Two of the most influential comedies of the decade hit that summer (“Caddyshack” and “Airplane!”), as did Robert Zemeckis’ cult favorite “Used Cars.\" This was also the year of Cimino’s “Heaven’s Gate,\" which has seen its critical reputation do a 180 over the last few decades. Fuller’s “The Big Red One,\" Demme’s “Melvin and Howard.\" Cause for celebration or consternation: the massive success of “Friday the 13th\" signaled that the slasher craze was here to stay.\n\n30 of 50\n\n1959\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe French New Wave officially kicked off with Alain Resnais’ gorgeously somber “Hiroshima mon amour” and François Truffaut’s semiautobiographic “The 400 Blows,\" while Ed Wood delivered his scrappy pièce de résistance in “Plan 9 from Outer Space” — i.e. this was a wildly diverse year for cinema. On the more skillful side of indie cinema, John Cassavetes unveiled his interracial drama “Shadows,\" which radically shifted perceptions of what movies could be and do. As for the studios, you still can’t make more satisfying mainstream entertainments than Hitchcock’s “North by Northwest” and Hawks’ “Rio Bravo”; all you can do is equal them. Wilder bounced back in a big way after a few spotty years with “Some Like It Hot.\" Bresson’s “Pickpocket\" is a masterpiece. Satyajit Ray’s “The World of Apu” closed out the filmmaker’s brilliant Apu trilogy. Boetticher continued his Ranown Western series with the terrific “Ride Lonesome.\" Ozu was nearing the end of his brilliant run, but “Floating Weeds” and “Good Morning” are exceptional works by any standard.\n\n32 of 50\n\n1971\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs the bloodshed increased in Vietnam and tensions reached a fever pitch at home, the world’s greatest filmmakers held up the mirror to our declining nature to let us know that we were a long, long way from OK. Where to start? Peckinpah’s “Straw Dogs?\" Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange?\" Siegel’s “Dirty Harry?\" Bogdanovich’s “The Last Picture Show?\" Russell’s “The Devils?\" It was a year rife with downers, none more essential than Altman’s anti-Western “McCabe and Mrs. Miller.\" The cliché of the bummer ‘70s ending was probably cemented by “The French Connection,\" which ticked off moviegoers by letting the bad guy get away. But there was still fun to be found: Forman’s “Taking Off,\" Allen’s “Bananas,\" Ashby’s “Harold and Maude,\" Nichols’ “Carnal Knowledge,\" Hodges’s “Get Carter,\" Siegel’s “The Beguiled…OK, it was a rough year. Other superlative works: Roeg’s “Walkabout,\" Malle’s “Murmur of the Heart,\" Lucas’ “THX-1138,\" Spielberg’s “Duel,\" Pakula’s “Klute,\" Sarafian’s “Vanishing Point,\" Hellman’s “Two-Lane Blacktop,\" Rivette’s “Out 1” and Leone’s final Spaghetti Western, “Duck, You Sucker.\" Also important: Melvin van Peebles and Gordon Parks kicked off the blacksploitation genre with, respectively, “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” and “Shaft.\"\n\n39 of 50\n\n1974\n\nGetty Images\n\nCoppola owned this year with the that’s-just-not-fair duo of “The Godfather: Part II” and “The Conversation.\" These aren’t just two of the best films of the year or the decade. They’re both all-timers. And yet culturally speaking, if you had to single out one film to represent the war-and-corruption-weary sentiment of the era, you’d probably go with Tobe Hooper’s unsparing “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\" Or maybe one of these classics: Pakula’s “The Parallax View,\" Polanski’s “Chinatown,\" Peckinpah’s “Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia,\" Altman’s “California Split,\" Cassavetes’ “A Woman Under the Influence,\" Malle’s “Lacombe, Lucien”, De Palma’s “The Phantom of the Paradise,\" Boorman’s “Zardoz\"...these were strange, unnerving days. Lightening the mood tremendously was Mel Brooks, who pulled off the comedy version of Coppola’s feat by releasing “Blazing Saddles” and “Young Frankenstein” in the same year.\n\n40 of 50\n\n1984\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe home entertainment market had fully exploded by this point, which meant low-budget movies that would’ve never seen the light of a projector in small towns were now available to rent at the local video store — ergo, there was a glut of subpar product. There was also an indie film boom underway, which gave us the Coens (“Blood Simple”), Jim Jarmusch (“Stranger Than Paradise”) and a gem from John Sayles (“The Brother from Another Planet”). The cinematic schizophrenia of the ‘80s is probably best represented by this string of movies: Dante’s “Gremlins,\" Cox’s “Repo Man,\" Forman’s “Amadeus,\" Reitman’s “Ghostbusters,\" Wenders’ “Paris, Texas,\" ZAZ’s “Top Secret!” De Palma’s “Body Double,\" Carax’s “Boy Meets Girl,\" Cameron’s “The Terminator,\" Demme’s “Stop Making Sense,\" LVT’s “The Element of Crime,\" Craven’s “A Nightmare on Elm Street,\" Reiner’s “This Is Spinal Tap,\" Tavernier’s “A Sunday in the Country,\" Richter’s “The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,\" Leone’s “Once Upon a Time in America,\" Brest’s “Beverly Hills Cop” and Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\"\n\n42 of 50\n\n1989\n\nGetty Images\n\nKrzysztof Kieślowski’s 572-minute “The Dekalog” is only one of the most astounding achievements in film history, so this year would rank very high even if the only other film released were Peter Bοnerz’s “Police Academy 6: City Under Siege.\" But 1989 ranks near the top because this was also the year that gave us Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,\" Soderbergh’s “Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" Allen’s “Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" Jarmusch’s “Mystery Train,\" Gus Van Sant’s “Drugstore Cowboy”, John Woo’s “The Killer”, Lehmann’s “Heathers”, De Palma’s “Casualties of War,\" Kloves’ “The Fabulous Baker Boys,\" Branagh’s “Henry V,\" Jane Campion’s “Sweetie”, Miyazaki’s “Kiki’s Delivery Service,\" Crowe’s “Say Anything…,\" Reinert’s “For All Mankind,\" Cameron’s “The Abyss,\" Herek’s “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure,\" Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”, DeVito’s “The War of the Roses”, Zemeckis’s “Back to the Future Part II,\" Almodovar’s “Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,\" Greenaway’s “The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover” and Hal Hartley’s perfect little debut, “The Unbelievable Truth.\" And, screw it, “Lethal Weapon 2.\"\n\n43 of 50\n\n1954\n\nGetty Images\n\nA pivotal year for Japanese cinema thanks to Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai,\" Kinoshita’s “Twenty-Four Eyes,\" two from Naruse (“Late Chrysanthemums” and “Sound of the Mountain”), a pair from Mizoguchi (“Sansho the Bailiff” and “The Crucified Lovers”), Inagaki’s “Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto” and the city-stompin’ debut of “Godzilla.\" Hitchcock caught fire again with “Rear Window” and the visually playful 3-D exercise “Dial M for Murder,\" while Rossellini peaked with the sensational “Journey to Italy.\" Nicholas Ray’s “Johnny Guitar” ranks as one of the greatest and most subversive Westerns ever made; Cukor’s “A Star Is Born” is still the definitive version of that oft-told tale; Kazan’s “On the Waterfront” gave Brando his most iconic pre-Corleone role; and Visconti’s lush melodrama “Senso” is the best thing he ever did aside from “The Leopard.\" This was a spectacular year on every level, including monster movies (e.g. Jack Arnold’s “The Creature from the Black Lagoon” and the giant ants of Gordon Douglas’ excellent “Them”).\n\n50 of 50\n\n1975\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis is the year that New Hollywood ecstatically/tragically found its equilibrium. Altman and Ashby found the ideal subjects for their shambling, satiric aesthetics and crafted a pair of masterpieces in, respectively, “Nashville” and “Shampoo.\" Meanwhile, that young upstart Steven Spielberg nicked their shaggy penchant for overlapping dialogue and used it to make \"Jaws\", which was then the most successful film of all time (it also singlehandedly launched the idea of a \"summer movie season\"). If only it could’ve stayed like this forever. Kubrick transformed Thackeray’s picaresque “Barry Lyndon” into the tragedy of a twit, and it appropriately stands as his crowning achievement. Also knocking out a career best work was Chantal Akerman, whose “Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” is an acute observation of a sex worker’s gradual unraveling. Also of note: Lumet’s “Dog Day Afternoon,\" Pollack’s “Three Days of the Condor,\" Walter Hill’s “Hard Times,\" Argento’s “Deep Red,\" Allen’s “Love and Death,\" Forman’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,\" Cooper’s “Overlord,\" Sembene’s “Xala”, Bartel’s “Death Race 2000,\" Weir’s “Picnic at Hanging Rock” and, of course, “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\""
