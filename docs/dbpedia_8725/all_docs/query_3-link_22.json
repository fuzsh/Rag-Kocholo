L.-------------------J In this chapter, we will discuss the three major types of movies: narrative, documentary, and experimental. Within narrative movies, we will look at the subcategory of genre films, and we will explore six major American film genres in particular. Finally, we will look at a tech­ nique-animation-that is often discussed as if it were a type but that is actually usedto make movies of all types. The Idea of Narrative The word narrative is much more than simply a general classificationofatypeoffilm.Asyouwillsoonsee,depend­ ing on when and how we use the term, narrative might mean several slightly different things. Since we'll be using the termnarrativeinvariouswaysthroughoutandbeyond our exploration of the three essential types of movies, let's discusssomeofthe waystoapproachtheterm. When it comes to cinema, nothing is absolute. In the worldofmovies, a narrative mightbe a type of movie, the story that a particular film tells, the particular system by which a fictional story is structured, or a concept de­ scribing the sequential organization of events presented in almost any kind of movie. Once you become familiar with these different ways of looking at narrative, you will be able to recognize and understand almost any us­ age that you come across. - ----- - --------- A narrative is a story. When people think of any medium or form-whether it's a movie, a joke, a com­ mercial, or a news article-that tells a story, we consider that story a narrative. Journalists will often speak of finding the narrative in a news item, be it coverage of a city council meeting, a national election, or an Olympic swimming competition. By this, they mean that under the facts and details of any given news item is astory. It's the reporter's job to identify that story and organize his reporting in such a way as to elucidate that narrative. Journalists do this because humans are a storytelling species. We use stories to arrange and understand our world and our lives. So, of course, news articles are not the only place you'll find narrative. Scientists, songwrit­ ers, advertisers, politicians, comedians, and teachers all incorporate narrative into the ways they frame and pre­ sent information. Thissemester, youwilllikelyhearyour professor refer to the narrative of a particular movie. Depending on the context she uses, she might be talking aboutthe story that the film tells, whetherthat movie is a science-fiction film or a documentary about science. Narrativeis a type ofmovie. Our mostcommon per­ ception of the word narrative is as a categorical term for those particular movies devoted to conveying a story, whether they are works of pure fiction like Alejandro Gonzalez Ifiarritu'sBirdman (2014) or a fictionalizedver­ sion of actual events such as Selma (2014; director Ava DuVernay). As we have made clear in previous chapters, these narrative films are the focus of this book. We'll dis­ cuss the narrative film as a type of movie (along with ex­ perimentaland documentary films) later inthis chapter. Narrative is a way of structuring fictional or fictionalized stories presented in narrative films. Storytelling is a complicated business, especially when relating a multifaceted story involving multiple charac­ ters and conflicts over the course of two hours of screen time. Besides being a general term for a story or for a kind of movie, narrative is often used to describe the way that movie stories are constructed and presented to engage, involve, and orient an audience. This narra­ tive structure-which includes exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement-helps film­ makers manipulate the viewer's cinematic experience by selectively conforming to or diverging from audience expectations of storytelling. Chapter 4 is devoted to this aspect of narrative. Narrative is a broader concept that both includes and goes beyond any of these applications. Narra­ tive can be defined in a broader conceptual context as\n\n3. any cinematic structure in which content is selected and arranged in a cause-and-effect sequence of events occurring over time. Any time a filmmaker consciously chooses and organizes material so that one event leads to another in a recognizable progression, that filmmaker is employing narrative in its most basic sense. In this case,narrativeis notsimplythetellingof a fictional story, it is a structural quality that nearly every movie pos­ sesses, whether it's an avant-garde art film, a documen­ taryaccountof actualevents, ora blockbusterHollywood fantasy. Movies do not have to arrange events in conventional order to employ narrative organization. In 21 Grams (2003), director Alejandro Gonzalez Ifi.arritu and screen­ writer Guillermo Arriaga arrange the events compris­ ing the intersecting stories of ex-convict Jack (Benicia Del Toro), dying heart patient Paul (Sean Penn), and recovering cocaine addict Cristina (Naomi Watts) in a One thing leads to another The Idea of Narrative 69 The most elemental way of looking at narrative is as a cinematic structure that arranges events in a cause-and-effect sequence. This causality is the basic organizing structure of most movie narratives. Consider the principal events in one of the best-known movies of all time, Star Wars (1977; director George Lucas): A starship is boarded by repressive Empire forces. The princess passenger records a plEa for help on an android, which escapes to a desert planet. The roving android is captured by scavenging Jawas, who sell it to the farm family of Luke Skywalker, who discovers the message, which senos him in search of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who teaches him the way of the Force and accompanies him on a mission to rescue the princesi,. One event leads to another and another and another. Decisions are made, which lead to actions, which have consequences, which mo­ tivate reactions, which cause subsequent decisions, actions, and consequences. And so it goes. The viewer engages with this logical progression, anticipating probable developments, dreading som;, and hoping for others. sequence motivated more by causality than chronology. A sequence in which Paul receives a heart transplant and Cristinaloses her familypropels the movieinto a scenein which Paul approaches Cristinaafter he tracks her down as the person who saved his life by donating her recently deceased husband's heart. This personal connection is followed by the moments immediately preceding the death of Cristina's husband, the tragedy that ultimately brings these two lost soulstogether. The next scene presents a devastated Jack resolving to turn himself in after leaving the scene of an accident that killed a man and his two daughters, knowingfull welJ.\n\n4. 70 Chapter 3 Types of Movies [� Causal minimalism ,r:,,_ fiction movie need not have a traditional goal-driven plot to be considered narrative. Richard Linklater's Slacker (1991) has no central char­ ,icter, no sustained conflict, and tells no single story; yet its structure is very much built on cause-and-effect connections, however tenuous, between the young bohemians who drift in and out of the movie. Beginning with a man getting off a bus (played by Linklater himself), the camera follows one character to another, drifting through a succession of over a hundred individual participants as they cross paths in Austin, Texas. Each encounter leads to the next, and so forth, in an extended exercise in causal minimalism.\n\n5. that his confession could send him back to prison. These events occur over time but are not connected by it. The scene-to-scene causality in this case is not motivated by chronology, but from the remorse, vulnerability, and sac­ rifice that bind the central characters. This approach to narrative demands a greater level of participation from viewers, who must actively engage with the movie to rec­ ognize the connections presented and reassemble events into a chronology that enables them to fully comprehend the story. Although nonfiction filmmakers shooting documen­ tary footage obviously can't always control the unstaged events happening before their cameras, contemporary documentary filmmakers oftenexploit theirability tose­ lect and arrange material in a cause-and-effect sequence of events. This very deliberate process may begin even beforecameras roll. Searchingfor Sugar Man (2012) director Malik Ben­ dejelloul surely recognized the narrative potential of the disappearance and rumored death of Sixto Rodriguez. The American folk singer had never achieved anything approaching notoriety in his own country, but record­ ings he released in the 1960s made him a superstar in South Africa. Because his music, particularly a song titled \"Sugarman,\" was associated with the country's antiapartheid movement, Rodriguez was still a major cultural figure there, even though he had not toured or recorded-or been heard from at all-in decades. Ben­ dejelloul structured his film as a missing-person investi­ gation filled with tantalizing clues and frustrating dead ends, as well as testimonials to Rodriguez's unique ge­ nius that feed the viewer's increasing hunger for a righ­ teous resurrection. Searchingfor Sugar Man reaches its narrative climax with the discovery of Rodriguez, poor and obscure but very much alive, in Detroit, Michigan. Thenonfictionfilmmaker's selective role is even more apparent in the Academy Award-winning documentary Born into Brothels (2004; directors Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman). The film's events are structured around co­ directorBriski'sexplicitlystatedintenttousephotography to reach and ultimately rescue thechildren of prostitutes in Calcutta's red-light district. The film's events are ar­ ranged in a cause-and-effect structure strikingly similar to that of a conventional fiction movie, where the film­ makers themselves not only select and arrange events, but actively participate in them. Briski engages the chil­ dren first byphotographingthem, then by teachingthem to taketheirownphotographs. She works to convincethe sex workers to allow her greater access to their children. Types of Movies 71 As the children's talents emerge, sheleads themon photo­ taking expeditions to the beach and the zoo, and even­ tually stages a series of public exhibitions of their work. As the children grow in confidence and ability, the se­ quence of events builds to a conclusion that engaged and gratified mainstream audiences, as well as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awarded the film an Oscar for Best Documentary Film. Those docu­ mentary filmmakers who strive to avoid influencing the events they record still exert a great deal of narrative in­ fluence during the editing process. Most experimental, or avant-garde, movies try to break from the formulas and conventions of more main­ stream narrative and documentary films. Even so, the. employ narrative according to our most general defini­ tion of the concept, despite being more concerned with innovation and experimentation than accessibility and entertainment. The complex process of making movies discourages purely random constructions. Filmmakers engaged with planning, capturing, selecting, and arranging footage tend to create sequences that grow logically in some way. The linear natureofmotionpictures lends itself to structures that developaccordingtosomeformof progression, even if the resultant meaning is mostly impressionistic. Thus nearly every movie, regardless of how it is categorized, employsatleastaloose interpretation ofnarrative. Types of Movies Filmscanbe sortedintoa varietyof systems. Thefilmin­ dustry catalogs films according to how they are distrib­ uted (theatrical, television, straight to DVD, streaming, etc.); how they are financed (by established studios or independent producers); or by their MPAA rating. Film festivals frequently separate entries according to run­ ning time. Film-studies curricula often group films by subject matter, the nation of origin, or the era or orga­ nized aesthetic movement that produced them. The wholeideaofbreakingdownanartform asmulti­ faceted as motion pictures into strict classifications can be problematic. Although most movies fall squarely into a single category, many others defy exact classification by any standard. This is because cinematic expression exists along a continuum; no rule book enforcing set cri­ teria exists. Throughout the history of the medium, in­ novative filmmakers have blurred boundariesand defied classification. Since this textbook is interestedprimarily\n\n6. 72 Chapter 3 Types of Movies in understanding motion-pictureform, the categories of films that we'll discuss below-narrative, documentary, andexperimental-arefocused on the filmmaker's intent and the final product's relationship with the viewer. Narrative Movies As we learned earlier, the primary relationship of a nar­ rative film to its audience is that of a storyteller. Narra­ tive films are so pervasive, so ingrained in our culture, that before reading this book, you may never have [!J stopped to consider the designation narrative film. Af­ ter all, to most of us, a narrative movie is just a movie. We apply a label only to documentary or experimental films-movies that deviate from that \"norm.\" What distinguishes narrative films from these other kinds of movies, both of which also tell stories or use other formal aspects of narrative? The answer is that narrative films are directed toward fiction. Even those narrative movies that purport to tell a true story, such as 0 David 0. Russell'sAmericanHustle (2013), adjust the sto­ ries they convey to better serve the principles of narrative structure that filmmakers use to engage and entertain audiences. Events are added or removed or rearranged, and characters are composited-actors (who are usually more attractive than the actual participants they play) add elements of their own personato the role. AmericanHustle acknowledges this necessary manip­ ulation right up front; Russell's movie retelling of con artists caught up in a famous FBI sting operation opens with a title card that replaces the usual \"based on a true story\" claim with a more candid disclaimer: \"Some of this actually happened.\" Audiences may be attracted to movies marketed as \"based on a true story\" due to the perception of immediacy or relevance that such a label imparts. But the truth is that very few \"true stories\" can deliver the narrative clarity and effect that audiences have come to expect from narrative films. No matter what the source, typical narrative films are based on screenplays in which nearly every behavior and spokenline arepredetermined. Thecharacters areplayed by actors delivering dialogue and executing action in a manner that not only strives for verisimilitude but also facilitates the technical demands of the motion-picture production process. These demands include coordinat­ ing their activity with lighting design and camera move­ ment, and performing scenes out of logical chronological sequence. This action typically takes place in artificial - Narrative commonality Even those narrative films bearing an overt ideological message or a dark theme are designed to engage an audience with a story. A twisted formal exercise like David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (2001) [11. an earnest political thriller like Stephen Gaghan's Syriana (2005) [21. and an animated crowd-pleaser like Gore Verbinski's Rango (2011) [31 all deliver different messages and are designed to appeal to different audiences. But they all employ the same narrative structures and techniques designed to transport viewers into a story, get them in­ vested in the characters, and make them care about the end results, despite knowing up front that none of it is real. worlds created on studio soundstages or in locations modified to suit the story and technical demands of pro- duction. The primary purpose of most narrative films is entertainment, a stance motivated by commercial intent. Many narrative films canbe broken down stillfurther into categories known as genres. We'll explore that sub­ ject later in the chapter.\n\n7. Docu mentary Movies We might say that narrative film and documentary film differ primarilyinterms of allegiance. Narrative film be­ gins with a commitment to dramatic storytelling; docu­ mentary film is more concerned with recording reality, educating viewers, or presenting political or social anal­ yses. In other words, if we think of a narrative movie as fiction, then the best way to understand documentary film is as nonfiction. But it wouldbe amistake to thinkthat simply because documentary filmmakers use actual people, places, and events as source material, their films always reflect ob­ jective truth. Whatever their allegiance, all documen­ tary filmmakers employ storytelling and dramatization to some degree in shaping their material. If they didn't, their footage might end up as unwatchably dull as a sur­ veillance video recording everyday comings and goings. As upcoming chapters will repeatedly illustrate, all ele­ ments of cinematic language-from the camera angle to the shot type to the lighting to the sound mix-color our perceptions of the material andsoare subjective tosome degree. And no documentary subject who knows she is being filmed can ever behave exactly as she would off camera. So the unavoidable act of making the movie removes the possibility of a purely objective truth. And truth, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Every documen­ tary filmmaker has a personal perspective on the sub­ ject matter, whether she entered the production with a preexisting opinion or developed her point of view over the course of researching, shooting, and editing the movie. The informed documentary viewer should view these mediating factors thoughtfully, always trying to understand how the act of cinematic storytelling and the filmmaker's attitude toward the people and events depicted affect the interpretation of the truth up on the screen. These complicating factors may have influenced film critic John Grierson, who originally coinedthe term doc­ umentary in 1926 to delineate cinema that observed life. Some time after he started making documentaries him­ self, Grierson described the approach as the \"creative treatmentof actuality.\" Robert J. Flaherty's pioneering documentary Nanook ofthe North (1922) demonstrates the complex relation­ ship between documentary filmmaking and objective truth. Flaherty's movie included authentic \"documen­ tary\" footage but also incorporated a greatdeal of staged Types of Movies 73 reenactments. He reportedly encouraged the Inuit sub­ jects to use older, more \"traditional\" hunting and fishing techniques for the film instead of their then current prac­ tices. However, no one who watches Nanook could argue that the film's portrayal of the Inuit and their nomadic northern lifestyle is a complete failure. The challenge for the viewer is to untangle Nanook's nonfiction function from its dramatic license, to view its anthropology apart from its artifice. Such a task requires a broad apprecia­ tion of both the movie and its subject from cinematic, historical, and scientific perspectives. We tendtoassume that a wide separation exists between fact and fiction, historical realityand crafted story, truth and artifice. The difference, however, is neverabsolute in any film. Historically, documentary films have been broken into four basic approaches: factual, instructional, per-­ suasive, and propaganda. Factual films, including Na.. nook of the North, usually present people, places, or processes in straightforwardways meanttoentertainand instruct without unduly influencing audiences. Early ex-· amples include some of the first movies made. In 1896, audiences marveled at the Lumiere brothers' short, one­ shot films documenting trains arriving, boats leaving, and soldiers marching off to the front. (At that time, the Nanook of the North Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922), a pioneering non­ fiction film, gave general audiences their first visual encounter with Inuit culture. Its subject matter made it significant (and successful), and its use of narrative film techniques was pathbreaking. Flaherty edited together many different kinds of shots and angles, for exam­ ple, and directed the Inuit through reenactments of life events, some of which-hunting with spears-were no longer part of their lives.\n\n8. 74 Chapter 3 Types of Movies spectacle of moving images impressed viewers as much as, or more than, any particular subject matter.) More recent documentaries that could fall into the factual­ documentary classification include Patrick Creadon's Wordplay (2006), an appreciation of the people who cre­ ate and complete crossword puzzles, and Finding Vivian Maier (2014; directors John Maloof and Charlie Siske]), a portrait of an obscure nanny who was unveiled as a master photographer when her life's work was discov­ ered after her death. Instructional films seek to educate viewers about common interests, rather than persuading them to ac­ cept particular ideas. Today these movies are most likely to teach the viewer basic skills like cooking, yoga, or golf swings. They are not generally considered worthy of studyor analysis. Persuasive films were originally called documentary filmsuntilthetermevolvedtorefertoall nonfictionfilms. The founding purpose of persuasive documentaries was to address social injustice, but today any documentary concerned with presenting a particular perspective on social issues or with corporate and governmental in­ justice of any kind could be considered persuasive. Di­ rector Gabriela Cowperthwaite's motivation in making Blackfish (2013) was not to simply entertain or inform audiences, but persuade them to oppose the practice of holding Orea whales in captivity at animal theme parks. Michael Moore's darkly humorous, self-aggrandizing documentaries take the persuasive documentary a step further. His confrontational and provocative movies ad­ dress a series ofleft-of-center politicalcauses, including health care (Sicko, 2007), gun control (Bowlingfor Col­ umbine, 2002), and the Bush administration's role in the Iraq War (Fahrenheit 9/11, 2004). When persuasive documentaries are produced by governments and carry governments' messages, they overlap with propaganda films, which systematically disseminate deceptive or distorted information. The most famous propaganda film ever made, Leni Riefen­ stahl's Triumph ofthe Will (1935), records many events at the 1934 uremberg rally of Germany's Nazi party. It thus might mistakenly be considered a \"factual\" film. Triumph of the Will The most accomplished (and notorious) propaganda film of all time, Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1 935) is studied by historians and scholars of film. Much of the blocking of the 1 934 Nuremberg Nazi rally was crafted specifically with the camera in mind. Riefenstahl, wearing a white dress and helping to push the camera [1], films a procession during the rally. Taken from a dis­ tant perspective, this shot conveys many concepts that the film­ maker and the Nazis wanted the world to see: order, discipline, and magnitude [21.\n\n9. I After all, no voice-over narration or on-screen com­ mentator preaches a political message to the viewer. But through its carefully crafted cinematography and editing, this documentary presents a highly glorified image of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi followers for the consumption of non-German audiences before World War IL Over a century of documentary innovation has blurred the distinctions between these four historical categories. Most documentary movies we consider wor­ thy of study today are hybrids that combine qualities of two or more of these foundational approaches to non­ fiction filmmaking. This versatility is one reason that documentary is enjoying a renaissance unprecedented in the history ofcinema. Barbara Kopple's Harlan County USA (1976) is an example of the nonfiction filmmaking style known as direct cinema. While many documentaries include on­ screen or over-the-shoulder interviewers having con- Documentary storytelling Types of Movie s 75 Many documentary filmmakers select subjects that offer potential narrative development. The resulting movie may be considered fac­ tual, or even persuasive in some ways. But the content need not be \" important:' Rather, the movie's primary intent is to entertain and involve audiences with the struggles of goal-driven protagonists. The efforts of a hapless but relentless Wisconsin filmmaker to mar­ shal the resources and support necessary to complete a low-budget horror film is the subject of Chris Smith's American Movie (1999) [1I. S. R. Bindler's Hands on a Hard Body (1 997) [21 follows twenty-four desperate contestants through a grueling and often dehumanizing endurance contest to win a new pickup truck. Seth Gordon's The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters (2007) [3] explores the strange, obsessive world of classic arcade-game enthusiasts by chronicling the efforts of high school math teacher Steve Wiebe's attempts to achieve the official world record score in Donkey Kong, despite the efforts of the competitive gaming establishment to preserve that distinction for their hero, Billy Mitchell. versations with subjects (in the segments on television·s 60 Minutes, for example), direct-cinema documentaries eschew interviewers and even limit the use ofnarrator. . Instead ofhaving voice-over narration to encourage the audience's indignation about the crime, scandal, or cor­ ruption being exposed, direct cinema involves placing small portable cameras and sound-recordingequipment in an important locationfordays orweeks and recording events as they occur. The resulting documentary may never include a question from an interviewer; instead, it enables the audience to overhear conversations and in­ teractions as they happen. Harlan County USA doc­ uments a yearlong Kentucky coal miners' strike in 1973-74. Risking her life and the lives of her crew, Kop­ ple aligned herself with the United Mine Workers of America, who were intimidated and sometimes shot at by strikebreakers for the Eastover Mining Company.\n\n10. 76 Chapter 3 Types of Movies During the film, Kopple's cameras begin to focus on the coal miners' wives, who encourage, cajole, and chastise their men to maintain the strike, walk the picket lines, and hold their families and communities together. While direct cinema can help reveal a subject in pro­ found and unexpected ways, this technique may not re­ move the narrative voice and perspective as much as hide it or transfer its function to the more \"invisible\" powerof other filmmaking systems. The editing process, for example, can include and exclude materials, ironi­ cally juxtapose people, events, and ideas, and arrange and order reality to suit the filmmaker's perspective. Documentary filmmakers continue to employ con­ ventional formal elements such as interviews, voice­ over narration, and archival footage in innovative ways to create new and compelling nonfiction forms. Direc­ tor Ken Burns seeks to bring history alive by presenting historical documents, archival photographs, painterly location shots, and posed artifacts to public-television audiences in a formalized style very different from the handheld \"fly on the wall\" perspective offered by direct­ cinemadocumentaries. He has been knownto film thou­ sands of historical photographs in his signature manner, where the camera glides and the framing tightens; such Clirect cinema \"dramatic\" camera movements emphasize details and link them to the narration and historical observations. Burns's use of the effect became so ubiquitous that Ap­ ple computers incorporated it into their home-movie­ editing software iMovie and openly identified it as the \"Ken Burns Effect.\" Many documentaries investigate events that hap­ pened in the past, but some of these cinematic investi­ gations are more personal than historical. The approach of films like Andrew Jarecki's Capturing the Friedmans (2003) rejects presenting a single \"factual\" interpreta­ tive stance in favor of offering a more ambiguous range of often-conflicting accounts. Capturing the Friedmans explores accusations of child molestation leveled at Ar­ nold Friedmanand his teenage son, Jesse, from multiple perspectives through a collage of homemovies, archival mediacoverage, and interviews with both family mem­ bers andalleged victims. Director Errol Morris incorporates cinematic tech­ niques normally associated with highly stylized narra­ tive and experimental films into the typically spartan documentary form. Fast, Cheap & Out ofControl (1997) implies profound associations between his seemingly diverse subjects-a topiary gardener, a lion tamer, a Documentaries made in the style known as direct cinema attempt to immerse the viewer in an experience as close as is cinematically pos­ s ble to witnessing events as an invisible observer. Direct cinema films like Albert and David Maysles's Grey Gardens (1975; codirectors Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer) seek to avoid conventional documentary techniques such as interviews and voice-over narration, and instead rely on very small crews and lightweight, handheld camera and sound equipment to capture the action as unobtrusively as possible. As they filmed Grey Gardens, the Maysleses observed that their extroverted subject \" Little Edie\" Beale 11 1 was becoming more interested in performing for the filmmakers than in ignoring their presence. Some direct cinema purists may have discouraged or deleted her behavior, but the Maysleses saw Edie's need for recognition, and the delusions that fueled it, as a crucial part of her reality. The filmmakers acknowledged their own role in the situation by incorporating their own image (as captured in a mirror) into the movie 121.\n\n11. robotics researcher, and a scientist studying nakedmole rats-by intercutting interviews of all four men and lac­ ing the movie with artfully crafted extreme close-ups, beautiful slow-motion effects, footage from old adven­ ture films, abstracted reenactments, and original mu­ sic by Caleb Sampson. Morris is famous for conducting his interviews using an Interrotron, a device of his own invention that projects the director's face onto a glass plate placed over the camera lens. The apparatus allows the subject to address responses directly into the lens, which establishes direct eye contact with theviewer. Experimental Movies Experimental is the most difficult of all types of movies to define precisely, in part because experimental film­ makers actively seek to defy categorization and conven­ tion. For starters, it's helpful to think of experimental cinema as pushing the boundaries of what most people thinkmovies are-or should be. Afterall,avant-garde, the term originally applied to this approach to filmmaking, Boundary-pushing documentaries Types of Movies 77 comes from a French phrase usedto describe scouts and pathfinders who explored ahead of an advancing army, implying that avant-garde artists, whether in film or an­ other medium, are innovators wholead, rather than fol­ low, the pack. The term experimental falls along these same lines. It's an attempt to capture the innovative spirit of an ap­ proach to moviemaking that plays with the medium, is not bound by established traditions, and is dedicated to exploring possibility. Both avant-garde and experimen­ tal (andother terms) are still used to describe this kind of movie. But since experimental is the word most com­ monly used, is appropriatelyevocative, and is in English, let's stick with it. In response to the often-asked question, \"What is an experimental film?\" film scholar Fred Camper offers six criteria that outline the characteristics that most ex­ perimental films share. While no criterion can hope to encapsulate an approach to filmmaking as vigorously di­ verse as experimental cinema, a summary of Camper' list of common qualities is a good place to start: Two recent documentaries test the boundaries between observation and exploitation, fiction and nonfiction. In Exit Through the Gift Shop (2010; director Banksy), what begins as a rambling archive of street art shot by a somewhat incompetent enthusiast namedTheirry Guetta turns into a movie about Guetta himself when one of his subjects (the mysterious and wildly successful artist known as Banksy) appropriates the footage, takes over the camera, and turns Guetta into a pseudo-celebrity called Mr. Brainwash. Banksy uses his considerable clout to influence the art world and his subject, and he records the results as the fame-hungry Guetta (and a small army of paid assistants) mounts a huge exhibit of new artworks credited to Mr. Brainwash [1 ]. The Act of Killing (2012; directors Joshua Oppenheimer, Anonymous, and Christine Cynn) begins as a relatively conventional documentary look back at the politically motivated massacre of as many as 2.5 million Indonesian citizens in the 1960s and 1970s. What immediately stands out is that Anwar Congo, the former death squad leader being interviewed, makes no attempt to downplay his role in the genocide. On the contrary, he proudly demonstrates his favorite execution methods. The filmmakers harness their subject's brazen narcissism by facilitating (and filming) increasingly elaborate re-creations of torture and murder, all staged by and starring Anwar and his sidekick Herman Kato, a former paramilitary leader and self-described gangster [2]. The resulting spectacle is pro­ foundly disturbing, yet inescapably amusing. Are Anwar, Herman, and Mr. Brainwash dupes or wily collaborators? Can a movie be a documer,­ tary when the filmmakers actively manipulate the people and events they document7 Does the precise nature of truth matter, so long as the results are entertaining? Parsing these questions is a part of the experience of watching both ExitThrough the Gift Shop and The Act of Killing.\n\n12. 78 Chapter 3 Types of Movies 1. Experimentalfilms are notcommercial. They are made by single filmmakers (or collaborative teams consisting of, at most, a few artists) for very low budgets and with no expectation offinancial gain. 2. Experimentalfilms arepersonal. They reflect the creative vision of a single artist who typically con­ ceives, writes, directs, shoots, and edits the movie with minimal contributions by other filmmakers or technicians. Experimental film credits are short. 3. Experimentalfilms do not conform to conventional expectations ofstory andnarrative cause andeffect. 4. Experimentalfilms exploit thepossibilities ofthe cinema and, by doingso,often reveal (andrevelin) tactile and mechanical qualities of motion pictures that conventional movies seek to obscure. Most conventional narrative films are constructed to make audiences forget they are watching a movie, whereas many experimental films repeatedly remind the viewer of the fact. They embrace inno­ vative techniques that call attention to, question, and even challenge their own artifice. 5. Experimentalfilms critique culture andmedia. From their position outside the mainstream, they often comment on (and intentionally frustrate) viewer expectations of what a movie should be. 6. Experimentalfilms invite individual inte1pretation. Like abstract expressionist paintings, theyresist the kind of accessible and universal meaning found in conventional narrative and documentary films.1 Because most experimental films do not tell a story in the conventional sense, incorporate unorthodox imag­ ery, and are motivated more by innovation and personal expression than by commerce and entertainment, they help us understand in yet another way why movies are a form ofart capable ofa sortof motion-picture equivalent of poetry. Disregarding the traditional expectations of audiences, experimental films remind us that film-like painting, sculpture, music, orarchitecture-can be made inas many ways as there are artists. For example, Michael Snow's Wavelength (1967) is a 45-minute film that consists, in what we see, only of an exceedingly slow zoom lens shot through a loft. Al­ though human figures wander in and out of the frame, departingat willfromthatframe or beingexcludedfrom it as the camera moves slowly past them, the film is al­ most totally devoid of any human significance. Snow's central concern is space: how to conceive it, film it, and encourage viewers to make meaning of it. Wavelength is repletewithdiffering qualitiesofspace,light, exposures, focal lengths, and printing techniques, all offering rich possibilities for how we perceive these elements and interpret their meaning. For those who believe that a moviemust represent thehuman condition, Wavelength seems empty. But for those who believe, with D. W. Grif­ fith, that a movie is meant, above all, to make us see, the work demonstrates theimportanceof utterly unconven­ tional filmmaking. Su Friedrich's experimental films also \"make us see,\" but in different ways. Friedrich's Sink or Swim (1990) opens abstractly with what seems to be scientific foot­ age-a microscope's view of sperm cells, splitting cells, a developing fetus-inexplicably narrated by a young girl's voice recounting the mythological relationship between the goddess Athena and her father, Zeus. As the movie's remaining twenty-five segments unfold, the offscreen girl narrator shifts frommythologicalaccounts of pater­ nal relationships to third-person accounts of episodes between a contemporary girl and her father. The epi­ sodes are illustrated with candid documentary footage, often featuring men and girls at play, and with what ap­ pear to be home movies, edited in a way that obscures theirorigins. The footagesometimesenforcesthenarra­ tion's mood and content, but just as often conflicts with the girl's story or combines with it so that additional meaning is imparted to both image and spoken word. As the successive layers are revealed, what began as an apparent abstract exercise reveals itself as an auto­ biographical account of the filmmaker's troubled rela­ tionship with her distant and demanding father. Iron­ ically, this experimental approach ultimately delivers a more emotionally complex and involving experience than most conventional narrativeordocumentary treat­ ments of similar subject matter. While Wavelength explores cinematic space and Sink or Swim focuses on personal expression, other exper­ imental films are primarily concerned with the tactile and communicative qualities of the film medium it­ self. These movies scavenge found footage-originally 1.

Tocreate Tribulation 99:AlienAnomalies underAmer­ ica (1992), his feature-length satire of paranoid conspir­ acy theories, Craig Baldwin collected thousands of still andmovingimages from awidevarietyofmostlyvintage sources, including educational films, scientific studies, and low-budget horror movies. By combining, superim­ posing, and sequencing selected shots, and overlaying the result with ominous text and urgent voice-over nar­ ration, Baldwinchanges the image context and meaning, thus transforming the way audiences interpret and ex­ perience the footage. Experimental filmmaker Martin Arnold also manip­ ulates preexisting footage to alter the viewer's interpre­ tation and experience with a method that is in many ways the reverse of Baldwin's frenetic collage approach. Arnold's most famous film, Passage a l'acte (1993), uses only one sequence from a single source: a short, rela­ tively mundane breakfast-table scene from Robert Mul­ ligan's narrative feature To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). Using an optical printer, which allowsthe operator to du­ plicate one film frame at a time onto a new strip of film stock, Arnold stretched the 34-second sequence to over 11 minutes by rhythmically repeating every moment in the scene. The resultforces us tosee the familiar charac­ ters and situation in an entirely newway. What was orig­ inally an innocent and largely inconsequential exchange is infused with conflict and tension. Through multiple and rapid-fire repetitions, a simple gesture such as put­ ting down a fork or glancing sideways becomes a hostile or provocative gesture, a mechanical loop, or an abstract dance. Like many experimental films, Passage a l'acte de­ liberately challenges the viewer's ingrained expectations of narrative, coherence, continuity, movement, and for­ ward momentum. The resulting experience is hypnotic, musical, disturbing, fascinating, and infuriating. It's easy to assume that films that test the audience's expectations of how a movie should behave are a rela­ tively recent phenomenon. But the truth is that film­ makers have been experimenting with film form and reception since the early days of cinema. In the 1920s, the first truly experimental movement was born in France, with its national climate of avant-garde artistic expression. Among the most notable works were films by painters: Rene Clair'sEntr'acte (1924), Fernand Leger Types of Movies 79 and Dudley Murphy's Ballet mecanique (1924), Marcel Duchamp'sAnemic cinema (1926), and Man Ray's Emal,­ Bakia (1926). These films are characterized uniformly by their surreal content, often dependent on dream impressions rather than objective observation; their abstract images, which tend to be shapes and patterns with no meaning other than the forms themselves; their absence of actors performingwithin a narrative context; and their desire to shock not only our sensibilities but also our morals. The most important of these films, th surrealist dreamscape An Andalusian Dog (1929), was made in France by the Spanish filmmaker Luis Bufi.uel and the Spanish painter Salvador Dali. Re-creating the sexual nature of dreams, this film's images metamor­ phose continually, defy continuity, and even attack cau­ sality-as in one scene when a pair of breasts dissolves into buttocks. Although an alternative cinema has existed in the United States since the 1920s-an achievement of sub­ stance and style that is all the more remarkable in a country where filmmaking is synonymous with Holly­ wood-the first experimental filmmakers here were either European-born or influenced by the French, Russians, and Germans. The first major American ex-· perimental filmmaker was Maya Deren. Her surreal films-Meshes ofthe Afternoon (1943), codirected with her husband, Alexander Hammid, is the best known-­ virtually established alternative filmmaking in this country. Deren's work combines her interests in vari-· ous fields, including film, philosophy, ethnography, and dance, and it remains the touchstone for those studying avant-garde movies. Concerned with the manipulation of space and time, which after all is the essence of filmmaking, Deren ex­ perimented with defying continuity, erasing the line between dream and reality. She used the cinematic equivalent of stream ofconsciousness, a literary style that gained prominence in the 1920s in the hands ofsuch writers as Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Dorothy Richardson and that attempted to cap­ ture the unedited flow of experience through the mind. In Meshes, Deren is both the creative mind behind the film and the creative performer on the screen. She takes certain recognizable motifs-a key, a knife, a flower, a telephone receiver, and a shadowy figure walking down a garden path-and repeats them throughout the film, each time transfiguringthem intosomethingelse. So,for example, the knife evolves into a key and the flower into\n\n14. 80 Chapter 3 Types of Movies Rearranged footage A sequence in Craig Baldwin's Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies under America (1 992) presents successive images of Mayan carvings [1 ]. Lucha Libre masked wrestlers 121. natives in ceremonial woven suits 13!. hooded prisoners 14!. and nature footage of snakes 151 to illus­ trate the narration's breathless claim that displaced aliens hiding be­ low the earth's surface have been forced to mate with reptiles. The power of editing to create meaning through juxtaposition allowed Baldwin to mutate his seemingly random collection of images of wildly disparate origins into a cohesive, if bizarre, story of the malev­ olent aliens emerging from their subterranean lair to attempt world domination.\n\n15. a knife. These changing motifs are linked visually but also structurally. Deren's ideas and achievementsbridge the gap between the surrealism of the French avant­ garde films and such dream-related movies as Alain Res­ nais's Last Year at Marienbad (1961), Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963), Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), and Luis Bufiuel's TheMilky Way (1969). Deren's work greatly influenced an American under­ ground cinema that emerged in the 1950s. It has since favored four subgenres-the formal, the self-reflexive, the satirical, and the sexual-each ofwhich tends to in­ clude aspects ofthe lyrical approach so typical of Deren. Works of pure form include John Whitney's early ex­ periments with computer imagery in such films as Ma­ trix I and Matrix II (both 1971); Shirley Clarke's Sky­ scraper (1960), one of several lighthearted, abstract tributes to city life; Peter Kubelka's ArnulfRainer (1960), which created its images through abstract dots; Jordan Belson's Allures (1961), using abstract color animation; Robert Breer'sFistFight (1964),which combines anima­ tion, images ofhandwriting, and other material; and Er­ nie Gehr's The Astronomer'sDream (2004), in which he speeds up the images so much that they become vertical purple lines. Self-reflexive films, meaning those that represent their own conditions of production (movies, in other words, about movies, moviemaking, moviemakers, and so on), include Hans Richter's Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947), in the spirit of surrealism; Stan Brakhage's five-part Dog Star Man (1962-64), whose lyricism is greatlyinfluenced by Deren's work; Bruce Baillie'sMass for the Dakota Sioux (1964), which combines a lyri­ cal vision and social commentary; Hollis Frampton's Zorn's Lemma (1970), a complex meditation on cine­ matic structure, space, and movement; and Michael Snow's Wavelength (1967), which we alreadydiscussed. Films that take a satirical view of life include James Broughton's Mother's Day (1948), on childhood; Stan van der Beek's Death Breath (1964), an apocalyptic vi­ sion using cartoons and other imagery; Bruce Conner's Marilyn TimesFive (1973), which makes its comic points bycompilingstockfootage from othersources; and Mike Kuchar's Sins ofthe Fleshapoids (1965), an underground look at the horror genre. Satirical and sexual films often overlap, particularly in their portrayal ofsexual activities that challenge con­ ventional ideas of \"normality.\" Examples of these in­ clude Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising (1964), an explicit Experimental film: style as subject Types of Movies 8 1 Among many other random repetitions and animations, Fernand Leger and Dudley Murphy's Ballet Mecanique (1924) repeatedly loops footage of a woman climbing stairs. This action lacks com­ pletion or narrative purpose and instead functions as a rhythmic counterpart to other sections of the film, in which more abstract objects are animated and choreographed in (as the title puts it) a \" mechanical ballet.\"\n\n16. 82 Chapter 3 Types of Movies Experimental film: image as shock Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dalf collaborated to produce An Andalusian Dog (1929), one of the most famous experimental films. Through special effects, its notorious opening sequence can be summarized in fourshots: [1] the title, \"Once upon a time . . . ;· which, under the circumstances, is an absurd use of the classic beginning of a nursery story; 121 an image of a man (who has just finished sharpening his straight razor); 131 an image of the hand of a differently dressed man holding a razor near a woman's eyeball with the implication that he will slit it; and [4] an image of a slit eyeball.There is no logic to this sequence, for the woman's eye is not slit; rather the slit eyeball appears to belong to an animal. The sequence is meant to shock the viewer, to surprise us, to make us \"see\" differently, but not to explain what we are seeing. homosexual fantasy that is tame by today's standards; Jack Smith'sFlamingCreatures (1963), a major test case for pornography laws; andmanyofAndyWarhol's films, including Lonesome Cowboys (1968). The directors who made these films tended to be obsessed, as was Deren, with expressing themselves and their subconscious throughcinematic forms and images. These days, movies that seem to be in direct opposi­ tion to Camper's experimental film criteria dominate our culture. Popular cinema is largely commercial, universal, and narrative. When most of us think of movies, we picture movies that conceal their artifice, reinforce viewer expectations, and seek a common, ac­ cessible interpretation. While purely experimental cinema rarely penetrates into the mainstream, this highly personal and innovative approach to cinematic expression continues to thrive on the fringes of popular culture. A grassroots \"micro­ cinema\" subculture has grown out of the affordabil­ ity and accessibility of digital video formats, personal\n\n17. Manipulated footage Naomi Uman's Removed (1999) employs a reductive approach to found-footage filmmaking that made audiences reinterpret and reexamine previously existing footage. She used nail polish and bleach to remove the female character from the emulsion of all 10,000 frames of a 7-minute pornographic movie. The result forces the viewer to experience the objectification of women in a literal­ or at least graphic-sense. The film's female character appears as an animated blank space that is physically manipulated by the male actors. computer-based editing systems, and video-hosting Web sites like YouTube and Vimeo. Most film festivals, from the most influential international competitions to the smallest local showcases, feature experimental pro­ grams. Many prestigious film festivals specializing in ex­ perimental cinema, such as theAnn Arbor Film Festival, attract hundreds of submissions and thousands of pa­ trons each year. International organizations like Flickr provide experimental filmmakers with an online venue to share and promote their work. Peripheral Produce and Invisible Cinema are among a growing number of companies and cooperatives that distribute experimen­ tal film and video compilations on DVD. Many art mu­ seums consider experimental applications of cinematic principles a fine-art form worthy of public display along with painting and sculpture. Artists such as Bill Viola, Matthew Barney, Pierre Huyghe, and Douglas Gordon have attracted great at­ tention to their avant-garde video installations, which change the traditional ways in which viewers experience and interact with moving images. Christian Marclay handled his experimental film The Clock (2010) like a H ybrid Movie s 83 limited edition fine-art print. The movie has never been distributed or broadcast; only seven copies have been sold to museums and collectors. The Clock is a precise assembly of thousands of images and lines of dialogue culled from existing movies and television shows, each one indicating a particular chronological moment in a 24-hour cycle. And, finally, while truly experimental films rarely if ever reach mass audiences, experimental approaches to narrative construction, visual style, and editing tech­ niques do often find their way into movies made by film­ makers sympathetic to the avant-garde's spirit of in­ vention. Many of the Hollywood directors incorporating experimental techniques developed a taste for uncon­ ventional innovation in film school or art school, or while honing their craft on music videos, commercials, and independent art films. Thesefilmmakersinclude Da-­ vid Lynch (Inland Empire, 2006), Spike Jonze (Where the Wild ThingsAre, 2009), Michel Gondry (TheScience of Sleep, 2006), Richard Linklater (A Scanner Darkly, 2006), Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche, New York, 2008), Gaspar Noe (Enter the Void, 2009), Nicholas Wind·­ ing Refn (Drive, 2011), and Jonathan Glazer (Under the Skin, 2013). Experimental sensibilities have emerged in a growing number of mainstream productions, from Christian Wagner's wildly kinetic editing in Tony Scott movies like Domino (2005), to the abstracted images in the title sequences for David Pincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), tothe simulated found-footage se­ quence that opened each episode of the HBO dramatic series True Blood (2008-2014). H ybrid Movies The flexibility of film form has made cross-pollination among experimental, documentary, and narrative ap­ proaches an inevitable and desirable aspect of cinematic evolution. The resulting hybrids have blurred whatwere oncedistinctborders amongthethreeprimary film-type categories. For example, Roger Beebe's experimental movie The Strip Mall Trilogy (2001) documents a mile­ long stretch of strip malls in Florida but so isolates and abstracts the images that he evokes meanings that tran­ scend any architectural or anthropological investigation ofcommercial suburban development. Ray Tintori's nar­ rative movie Death to the Tinman (2007) most certainly tells a story, but does so with narration, cinematography,\n\n18. 84 Chapter 3 Types of Movies Documentary/narrative fusion Larry Charles's Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) [1] pushes the documentary/ narrative marriage to its extreme by placing the fictional character of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) in real-life situations with people who were led to believe that they (and Borat) were the subjects of a documentary about a foreign reporter's exploration of American culture. The result functions as both documentary and narrative: we experience a deliberately structured character pursuing a clearly defined goal, but that pursuit is punctuated with a series of spontaneous explosions of authentic human behavior provoked and manipulated by Borat/Cohen and captured by a documentary film crew. Director Jonathan Glazer took the hybrid a step further in Under the Skin (2013), his fiction film about an alien (Scarlett Johansson) who gradually begins to empathize with the humans she was sent to Earth to harvest. Glazer shot most of the movie using hidden cameras, so that many of the people appearing on-screen didn't know they were being filmed. The technique lends a sense of documentary realism to an otherwise fantastic situation. The men attracted to the beautiful extraterrestrial can't help convincingly portraying unsuspecting victims [2]. Film-type fusion Perhaps the film that best exemplifies the fusion of narrative, documentary, and experimental film types is William Greaves's Symbiuµ:;yc;/10- taxiplasm: Take One (1968). Greaves employed three camera crews and instructed the first crew to shoot only the series of actors performing the scripted scene, the secondcrew to film the first crew shooting the scene [1], and the third to shoot the entire multilevel production as well as anything else they judged footage-worthy going on around them. The edited film frequently uses split screen to present several of its mul­ tiple layers simultaneously [2]. Greaves intentionally provoked his various crews and casts with vague or contradictory directions, until what amounts to a civil war erupted as some of the film professionals involved began to question the director's intentions and methods. Greaves, who functioned as the director of the actors as well as a sort of actor himself in the dual layers of documentary footage, made sure that every aspect of the ensuing chaos-including private crew meetings criticizing the project-was captured on film and eventually combined into an experimental amalgam that breaks down audience expectations of narrative and documentary, artifice and reality.2 2.

We've already discussed the importance of narra­ tive to many documentary films. A growing number of narrative feature films that incorporate documentary techniques demonstrate that the borrowing works in both directions. Contemporary directors such as Jean­ Pierre and Luc Dardenne (Two Days, One Night, 2014), Lance Hammer (Ballast, 2008), Benh Zeitlen (Beasts of the Southern Wild, 2012), Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Sta­ tion, 2013), and Kelly Reichardt (Night Moves, 2014) use small crews, natural lighting, handheld cameras, and nonactors (alongside deglamorized professionals) to lend their gritty narrative films the sense of authen­ tic realism associated with documentary aesthetics and techniques.3 Genre Our brief survey of documentary and experimental cin­ ema demonstrates that both of these primary types of movies can be further divided into defined subcatego­ ries. These distinctions are both useful and inevitable. Any art form practiced by ambitious innovators and consumed by a diverse and evolving culture can't help developing in multiple directions. When filmmakers and their audiences recognize and value particular ap­ proaches to both form and content, these documentary or experimental subcategories are further differenti­ ated and defined. And the moment such a distinction is accepted, filmmakers and viewers will begin again to refine, revise, and recombine the elements that defined the new categorization in the first place. Genre refers to the categorization of narrative films by thestories they tell and the ways they tell them. Com­ monly recognized movie genres include the Western, horror, science fiction, musical, and gangster film. But this is far from a complete list. The film industry contin­ ues to make action movies, biographies (biopics), melo­ dramas, thrillers, romances, romantic comedies, fantasy films, and many others that fall within some genre or subgenre category. Cinema of ideas Genre 85 All cinema is about ideas-many about the idea of cinema itself-­ and there are many ways to make a film. Some filmmakers find nothing more challenging than making a movie about an idea for its own sake. With The Tree of Life (2011 ), writer/director Terrence Malick gently deals with such abstract ideas as life and death, love, family, joy and sorrow, the flow of time, and whether eternity exists. Its visual impact, produced by vivid images of our natural world, cre­ ates an overlaying structure. Under that he gently tucks a beautifully realized account of one family's life in the 1950s American South­ west, thus letting us experience the universe and the individual. But its principal purpose, like that of all cinema, is to make us see and help us understand its ideas. A long list like that may lead you to believe that all films are genre movies. Not so. A quick scan of the movies in theaters during a single week in 2014 reveals many narrative films that tell stories and employ styles that don't fit neatly into any existing genre template. The nongenre titles filling out the top fifteen box offic leaders during the last weekendin 2014, forexample, in­ cluded Night at the Museum: Secret ofthe Tomb (Shawn Levy), The Gambler (Rupert Wyatt), Wild (Jean-Marc Vallee), and TopFive (Chris Rock), as wellas TheHunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 (Francis Lawrence), which borrows from a number of genres but doesn't land di­ rectly in any. Genre is certainly not the only way that narrative movies are classified. The film industry breaks down films according to studio of origin, budget, target audi­ ence, and distribution patterns. Moviegoers often make viewingdecisionsaccordingtothedirectorsand/orstar:, of the films available. Film scholars may categorize and analyzea moviebasedonawiderangeofcriteria,includ­ ing its specific aesthetic style, theartists who created it, 3.

Carlos Kase for some of the ideas in this analysis.\n\n20. 86 i:hapter 3 Types of M ovies [� its country or region of origin, the apparent ideologies expressed by its style or subject matter, or theparticular organized cinematic movement it emerged from. Unlike these film movements (such as French New Wave or Dogme 95), in which a group of like-minded filmmakers consciously conspire to create a particu­ lar approach to film style and story, film genres tend to spring up organically, inspired by shifts in history, politics, or society. Genres are often brought about in­ advertently-not through any conscious plan, but rather because of a cultural need to explore and express issues and ideas through images and stories. Many classic genres, including Westerns, horror, and science fiction, emerged in literature and evolved into cinematic form during the twentieth century. Others, such as the mu­ sical, originated on the Broadway and vaudeville stages before hitting the screen. Some, like the gangster film, were born and bred in the cinema. Cultural conditions inspire artists to tell certain kinds of stories (and audi­ ences to respondto them), the natureofthosenarratives motivates certain technical and aesthetic approaches, and eventually the accumulation of like-minded movies is detected, labeled, studied, and explicated by cinema scholars. Genre study Scholars find genre films to be especially rich artifacts that can re­ veal a great deal about the culture that produced and consumed them, as well as about the filmmakers who made them. How does Martin Scorsese, a director associated with gangster films such as Mean Streets (1 9731 [11 and Goodfellas (1 9901 [2], apply the con­ ventions of that genre to the rise and fall of an unscrupulous stock­ broker in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) [3]? What do the forty-eight or so thrillers that Alfred H itchcock produced in a prolific fifty-year span tell us about the evolution of our popular culture, film style, the movie business-and Hitchcock himself? And, of course, academic scholars are not the only movie lovers who find it useful to categorize films by genre. Genre significantly affects how audiences choose the movies they attend, rent, or purchase. Movie review­ ers often critique a film based onhow itstacks up against others in its genre. Most movie-rental retailers organize movies according to genre (along with more general catchall classifications like drama and comedy). Online and newspaper theater listings include a movie's genre alongsideits rating, running time, and show time. Of the aforementioned fifteen top-grossing mov­ ies for the weekend of December 26, 2014, at least ten could be considered genre films: Interstellar (Christo­ pher Nolan) is science fiction; The Hobbit: Battle ofthe Five Armies (Peter Jackson) is fantasy; Into the Woods (Rob Marshall) and Annie (Will Gluck) are both musi­ cals; and Exodus: Gods and Kings (Ridley Scott) updates the classic \"sword and sandals\" biblical epic. Two top­ grossing animated kid's movies have adopted action film subgenres: Big Hero Six (Don Hall and Chris Wil­ liams) is a superhero movie, and Penguins of Mada­ gascar (Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith) is a James Bond-style spy thriller. Unbroken (Angelina Jolie), The Imitation Game (Morten Tyldum), and Big Eyes (Tim\n\n21. Burton) are all biographical films, a genre that recounts a significant historical period of a notableperson's life. Since genre labels allow us to predict with reason­ able certainty what sort of movie to expect, these clas­ sifications don't just help audiences make their viewing choices; the people that finance movies often must account for genre when deciding which projects to bankroll. Genres offer familiar story formulas, conventions, themes, and conflicts, as well as immediately recogniz­ able visual icons. Together, they provide a blueprint for creating and marketing a type of film that has proven successful in the past. Studios and distributors can de­ velop genre-identifiedstars, select directors on the basis of proven ability in a particular genre; piggyback on the success of a previous genre hit; and even recycle props, sets, costumes, and digital backgrounds. Just as impor­ tant, theindustry counts on genre to predict ticketsales, presell markets, and cash in on recent trends by mak­ ing films that allow consumers to predict they'll like a particular movie. In other words: give people what they want, and they will buy it. This simple economic principle helps us understand the phenomenal growth Genre masterpieces Genre 87 of the movie industry from the 1930s on, as well as the mind-numbing mediocrity ofso many ofthe movies the industry produces. The kind of strict adherence to genre convention driven solely by economics often yields de­ rivative and formulaic results. If genre films are prone to mediocrity, why are so many great filmmakers drawn to making them? Part of the answer can be found, of all places, in a stateme t by the Nobel Prize-winning poet T. S. Eliot, who wrote: \"When forced to work within a strict framework, the imagination is taxed to its utmost-and will produce its richest ideas.\" Eliot was talking about poetry, but the same concept can be applied to cinema. Creatively ambitious writers and directors often challenge them­ selves to create art within the strict confines of genre convention. A genre's so-called rules can provide a foundati n upon which the filmmaker can bothhonor traditions and innovate change. The resulting stories and styles often expertly fulfill some expectations while surprising and subverting others as the filmmaker references, refutes, and revises well-establishedcultural associations. Genre has intrigued so many of our greatest American and Not all genre movies are disposable formula pictures churned out for the indiscriminate masses. Many of cinema's most revered films are also genre movies. Stanley Kubrick's 2007.· A Space Odyssey (1968) incorporates virtually every standard science-fiction genre element, including speculative setting, special effects, and a decided ambivalence toward the benefits of technology. Yet Kubrick's skills as a storyteller and stylist make 2007 a work of art that transcends conventional attitudes toward genre movies.\n\n22. 88 t:hapter 3 Types of Movies European filmmakers that numerous entries in the canon of important and transformative movies are genre films. The Godfather (1972; director Francis Ford Coppola), Goodfellas (1990; director Martin Scorsese), and Bonnie and Clyde (1967; director Arthur Penn) are all gangster films; Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is science fiction; Carol Reed's The ThirdMan (1949) and even Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960) could be con­ sidered film noir; Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) is a romantic comedy; John Ford's The Searchers (1956) is a Western, as is Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966); Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain (1952) is a musical; David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (1962)is a biography anda war movie andan epic. Still, audiences don't like just the classic films that transcend genre conventions. Genre films have been prevalent since the earliest days ofcinemabecause, con­ trary to popular perceptions, most movie viewers value predictability over novelty. Elements of certain genres appeal to us, so we seek to repeat an entertaining or en­ gagingcinemaexperiencebyviewing a film that promises the same surefire ingredients. We get a certain pleasure from seeing how different filmmakers and performers ave rearranged and interpreted familiar elements, just as we are exhilarated by an unexpected deviation from the anticipated path. Toput this relationship into gastro­ nomic terms: the most common pizza features a flour­ based crust topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, but it's the potential variety within that familiar foundation that has made pizza one ofAmerica's favorite foods. A less obvious but perhaps more profound explana­ tion for the prevalence of genre lies in the deep roots of genre in our society. Remember that any given genre naturally emerges and crystallizes not because Holly­ wood thinks it'll sell, but because it gives narrative voice to something essential to our culture. The film industry may ultimately exploit a genre's cultural resonance, but only after cultural conditions motivate enough individ­ ual artists and viewers to create the genre in the first place. For example, no studio executive or directors' club decided to invent horror movies out of thin air. Horror movies exist due to our collective fear of death and the human psyche's need for catharsis. Westerns enact and endorse aspects of American history and the human condition that Americans have needed to believe about themselves. We go to these movies not only to celebrate the familiar, but to enforce fundamental beliefs andpas­ sively performculturalrituals. As ourworld evolves and audience perspectives change, genre movies adapt to reflect these cultural shifts. A Western made during the can-dopatriotism ofWorldWar II is likelyto express its themes differently than one produced at the height of the VietnamWar. Genre Conventions Movie genres are defined by sets of conventions-as­ pects of storytelling such as recurring themes and sit­ uations, setting, character types, and story formula, as well as aspects of presentation and visual style such as decor, lighting, and sound. Even the movie stars asso­ ciated with a particular genre can be considered one of these defining conventions. Keep in mind that these conventions are not enforced; filmmakers don't follow mandated genre checklists. While every movie within any particular genre will incorporate some of these ele­ ments, fewgenremovies attempt to includeeverypossi­ blegenreconvention. Story Formulas Theway amovie's story is structured­ its plot-also helps viewers determine what genre it belongs to. For example, gangster films-from How­ ard Hawks's Scarface (1932) to Ridley Scott's American Gangster (2007)-tendto share a plot structureinwhich an underprivileged and disrespected immigrant joins (or forms) an organized crime syndicate; works his way to the top with a combination of savvy, innovation, and ruthlessness; becomes corrupted by his newfound power and the fruits of his labors; and as a result is betrayed, killed, or captured. Romantic comedy plots are structured around char­ acters in love as they couple, break up, and reconnect. When they first meet, the two characters (usually a man and a woman) are at odds. They fall in love in spite of, or sometimes because of, this seeming incompatibility. Thenthey mustovercomeobstacles to theirrelationship in the form of misunderstandings, competing partners, social pressures, or friction caused by the aforemen­ tioned incompatibility. Eventually the romance will ap­ pear doomed, but one halfofthe couple will realize they are meant for each other and make a grand gesture that reunites the romantic duo.\n\n23. Theme A movie's theme is a unifying idea that the film expresses through its narrative or imagery. Not every genre is united by a single, clear-cut thematic idea, but the Western comes close. Nearly all Westerns share a central conflict between civilization and wilderness: settlers, towns, schoolteachers, cavalry outposts, and lawmen stand for civilization; free-range cattlemen, Indians, prostitutes, outlaws, and the wide-open spaces themselves fill the wilderness role. Many classic West­ ern characters exist on both sides of this thematic con­ flict. For example, the Wyatt Earp character played by Henry Fonda in John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946) is a former gunfighter turned lawman turned cowboy turned lawman. He befriends an outlaw but falls in love with a schoolteacher from the east. Early Westerns tend to sympathize with the forces of civiliza­ tion and order, but many ofthe Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s valorize the freedom-loving outlaw, cowboy, or Native American hero. Gangster films from Howard Hawks's Scarface (1932) to Ridley Scott's American Gangster (2007) are shaped by three well-worn, but obviously resonant themes: rags to riches; crime does not pay; absolute power corrupts absolutely. The thematic complexity made possible by the tension between these aspirational and moralistic ideas can give viewers a more meaningful experience than we might expect from a genre dedicated to career criminals. Character Types While most screenwriters strive to create individuated characters, genre films are often populated by specific character \"types.\" Western protag­ onists personify the tension between order and chaos in the form ofthe free-spirited but civilized cowboy or the gunslinger turned lawman. Female characters also per­ sonify this tension, but only on one side or the other-as schoolmarm or prostitute, only rarely as a combination ofboth. Other Western character types include the cun­ ning gambler, the greenhorn, the sidekick, and the set­ tler. John Ford packed nearly every Western character type into a single wagon in his classic Western Stage­ coach (1939). The horror and science-fiction film antagonist is al­ most always some form of \"other\"-a being utterly dif­ ferent from the movie's protagonist (and audience) in form, attitude, and action. Many of these movie mon­ sters are essentially large, malevolent bugs-the more Genre 89 foreign the villain's appearance and outlook, the better. When the other is actually a human, he often wears a mask designed to accentuate his otherness. Setting Setting-where a movie's action is located and how that environment is portrayed-is also a common genre convention. Obviously, Westerns are typically set in the American West, but setting goes beyond geogra­ phy. Most classic Westerns take place in the 1880s and 1890s, an era of western settlement when a booming population of Civil War veterans and other eastern ref­ ugees went west in pursuit ofland, gold, and cattle trade. The physical location of Monument Valley became the landscape most associated with the genre, not because ofany actual history that occurred there, but because the scenic areawas the favorite location ofthe prolific West­ ern director John Ford. Since science-fiction films are speculative and, there­ fore, look forward rather than backward, they are usu­ ally set in the future; sometimes in space, sometimes i futuristic earth cities, sometimes in post-apocalyptic desolation, but almost always in an era and place greatly affected by technology. Unlike gangster films, which are almost always urban in setting, horror films seekthe sort ofisolated locations-farms, abandoned summer camp:;, small rural villages-that place the genre's besieged pro­ tagonists far from potential aid. Presentation Many genres feature certain elements of cinematic language that communicate tone and at­ mosphere. For example, horror films take advantage of lighting schemes that accentuate and deepen shadows. The resulting gloom helps to create an eerie mood, but horror films are more thanjust dark; filmmakers use the hard-edged shadows as a dominant compositional ele­ ment to convey a sense of oppression, distort our sense ofspace, and conceal narrative information. Film noir, a genre that also seeks to disorient the viewer and convey a sense of unease (although for very different thematic and narrative reasons), employs many ofthe same ligh·- ing techniques. Ironically, science-fiction films use the latest high­ tech special effects to tell stories that warn against the dehumanizing dangers of advanced technology. In fact, the genre is responsible for many important special ef­ fect innovations, from the miniatures and matte paint­ ings that made possible the futuristic city ofFritz Lang's\n\n24. 90 Chapter 3 Types of M ovies Metropolis (1927) to the motion-control cameras and . otoscope animation that launched the spaceships of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to the special \"virtual camera system\" director James Cam­ eron and hisAvatar(2009) team used to capture actors' expressions and actions as the first step in a revolution­ ary technical process that transformed the film's cast into aliens inhabiting an all-digital world. Westerns, a genre clearly associated with setting, fea­ ture a great many exterior shots that juxtapose the char­ acters with the environment they inhabit. The human subject tends to dominate the frame in most movie com­ positions, but many of these Western exterior shots are framed so that the \"civilized\"' characters are dwarfed by the overwhelming expanse of wilderness around them. Movies in the action genre often shoot combat (and other high-energy action) from many different angles to allow for a fast-paced editing style that presents the ac­ tionfrom a constantly shifting perspective. These highly fragmented sequences subject the viewer to a rapid-fire cinematic simulation of the amplified exercise presum­ ably experienced bythe characters fighting on-screen. Stars Even the actors who star in genre movies factor i to how the genre is classified, analyzed, and received by audiences. In the 1930s and 1940s, actors worked under restrictive long-term studio contracts. With the studios choosing their roles, actors were more likely to be \"typecast\" and identified with a particular genre that suited their studio-imposed persona. Thus John Wayne is forever identified with the Western, Edward G. Rob­ inson with gangsterfilms, and Boris Karloff with horror. These days, most actors avoid limiting themselves to 0a single genre, but several contemporary actors have be- c me stars by associating themselves almost exclusively with action films. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jet Li, Jason Statham, and others have benefited from the genre's preference for physical presence and macho persona over acting ability. It's not that no genre stars can act. In fact, an actor who has become identified with one genre will often receive extra attention and accolades for per­ forming outside of it. For example, Bill Murray became a star while acting in screwball comedies, but his subtle performances in the dramas Lost in Translation (2003; director Sofia Coppola) and Broken Flowers (2005; di­ rector Jim Jarmusch) made him an actor worthy of movie critics' praise. Multigenre stardom These days, few actors are associated with a single genre. Scarlett Johansson, since taking on the recurring superhero movie role of the Black Widow in Iron Man 2 (2010; director Jon Favreau) I1 ]-a part she has reprised in three subsequent Avengers movies-starred in three very different science-fiction films as well as a psycho­ kinetic killer in the action-packed Lucy (2014; director Luc Besson), as a lonely alien in the artsy Under the Skin (2013; director Jon­ athan Glazer), and as the voice of a sentient computer operating system in the cerebral Her (2013; director Spike Jonze) 121. During the same period, she also played the elegant movie star Janet Leigh in the biopic Hitchcock (2012; director Sacha Gervasi) [31, and a woman competing with her boyfriend's porn addiction in the raunchy romantic comedy Don Jon (2013; director Joseph Gordon­ Levitt).\n\n25. Compiling an authoritativelist ofnarrative genres and their specific conventions is nearly impossible, espe­ cially in an introductory textbook. There are simply too many genres, too much cinematic variety and flexibility, and too little academic consensus to nail down every (or any) genre definitively. Nevertheless, the next section offers a closer look at six major American genres to help you begin developing a deeper understanding of how genre functions. Six Major American Genres Gangster The gangster genreisdeeply rootedinthe conceptofthe American dream: anyone, regardless of how humble his origins, can succeed. For much of its history, America's wealth and political power have been wielded primar­ ily by successive generations of a white, Anglo-Saxon, highly educated, and Protestant ruling class. American heroes like Daniel Boone, leaders like Andrew Jack­ son and Abraham Lincoln, and popular novelists like Horatio Alger Jr. challenged this tradition of power by birthright. Their example gave rise to the notion that anyone with intelligence and spunk can rise to great riches or power through hard work and bold action. The nation's expanding population of working-class Amer­ ican immigrants were eager to embrace this rags-to­ riches mythology. By the turn ofthe twentieth century, pulp-fiction ac­ counts of the American West had already established the hero as an outsider who lives by his wits and is will­ ing to break the rules to achieve his goals. Two histori­ cal events provided the remaining ingredients needed to turn these working-class notions into what we know now as the gangster genre. First, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitu­ tion-passed in 1919-banned the manufacture, sale, and transport of alcohol. This ill-advised law empow­ ered organized crime, which expanded to capitalize on the newfound market for the suddenly forbidden bev­ erages. Many of the criminal entrepreneurs who ex­ ploited this opportunity were Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants. What's more, Prohibition legitimized unlawful be­ havior by making outlaws out of common citizens thirsty for a beer after quitting time. As a result, com- Six Major American Genres 91 man people-many of them immigrants themselves­ began to identify with the bootleggers and racke­ teers. They were seen as active protagonists who took chances, risked the consequences, and got results-all surefire elements of successful cinema heroes. The stock market crash in 1929 and the resulting economic de­ pression further cemented the public's distrust of au­ thority (that is, banks and financiers) and the allure of the gangster. In this specific cultural context, American audiences began to question the authority of discredited institu­ tions such as banks, government, and law enforcement. This viewpoint fed their fascination with the outlaws who bucked those systems that had failed the rest of so­ ciety. As the Depression deepened, the need for vivid, escapist entertainment increased. Hollywood was the ideal conduit for this emerging zeitgeist; the result was the gangster film. Just as the gangster film emerged, however, the film industry adopted a production code that forbade mov­ ies from explicitly engaging audience sympathy wit \"crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.\" As a result, while early gangster films were among the most violent and sexu­ ally explicit movies of their time, the central conflicts and themes they explored were often at odds with one another. For example, the stories were centered around outlaw entrepreneurs who empowered themselves, bucked the establishment, and grabbed their piece of the pie; yet, by the end of the story, this theme of suc­ cess would give way to a \"crime does not pay\" message in which the enterprising hero is finally corrupted by his hunger for power and thus defeated by forces oflaw and order. In many of these films, violent crime was both celebrated and condemned. Movies that had audience:, sympathizing with criminals (or at least their goals) at the start would ultimately turn an exhilarating rags-­ to-riches story of empowerment into a cautionary tale of the consequences of blind ambition. Central char-­ acters would achieve their goal, only to be killed either by the law or their own equally ruthless subordinates. Along the way, audiences enjoyed the vicarious thrills of a daring pursuit ofpower, as well as the righteous satis­ factionofseeingorder restored. While modern gangster narratives have expanded t include awide range ofstoriessetwithinthemilieu ofor­ ganizedcrime, classic gangsterplots typically follow this rags-to-riches-to-destruction formula. The protagonist\n\n26. 92 C:hapter 3 Types of M ovies �iangster plot elements Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather trilogy (1972-90), perhaps the most famous gangster film series, includes many plot elements common to the genre, including the protagonist's humble origins and his rise to power through a combination of astute management and ruthless violence. But Coppola incorporated genre innovations that differentiated The Godfather movies from more typical gangster films. For exam­ ple, the protagonist, Michael (Al Pacino), is an unwilling crime boss forced into syndicate leadership by circumstances and birthright. The plot elements of a humble origin and the rise to power are presented as flashbacks featuring not Michael, but his father, the man whose death propels Michael into a life of organized crime. Finally, Michael is unusual in that he attains power and prestige but is not destroyed (physically, at least) by corruption and greed. is initially powerless and sometimes suffers some form of public humiliation that both emphasizes his vul­ nerability and motivates his struggle for recognition. (This humiliation can come at the hands of a governing institution or the ruling gang organization; often, the en­ suing conflict pits thegangsterhero against both the law and the criminals currently in control.) The hero gains status and eventually grabs power and riches through ingenuity, risk taking, and a capacity for violence. Most gangster protagonists are killers, but their ini­ tial victims (such as the thugs responsible for the pro­ tagonist's initial humiliation) are usually portrayed as deserving of their fate. This pattern shifts as the hero eaches his goal to rule the criminal syndicate. His am­ itionclouds his vision; he becomes paranoid and power­ hungry, and begins to resemble his deposed adversaries. Before he self-destructs, he often destroys-figuratively or literally-characters that represent his last remaining ties to the earnest go-getter who began the story. Fre­ quently, the protagonist expresses last-minute regret for what he has become, but by then it's almost always too late. More sympathetic secondary characters often serve to humanize the gangster antihero. While the doomed protagonist is nearly always male, the secondary char­ acters who provide a tenuous connection to the Old World values that he must sacrifice on his climb up the ladder usually take the form of a mother or sister. The onlyother female character typical to thegenre is either a fellow criminal or a sort of gangster groupie known as a moll. Whereas the protagonist's mother loves him for his potential humanity, the gangster moll loves him for his potential power and wealth. She is a symbol ofhis as­ pirations-an alluring veneer concealing a rottencore. The protagonist may also have a sidekick-a trusted companion from the old neighborhood-who makes\n\n27. The antihero The gangster movie gave the cinema some its first antiheroes.These unconventional central characters pursue goals, overcome obsta­ cles, take risks, and suffer consequences-everything needed to propel a compelling narrative-but they lack the traditional \" heroic\" qualities that engage an audience's sympathy. While he may not be courteous, kind, and reverent, he is almost always smart (if uned­ ucated), observant, and brave. More than anything, the gangster­ hero is driven by an overwhelming need to prove himself. This need motivates his quest for power, fame, and wealth-and almost al­ ways proves to be the tragic flaw that brings about his inevitable downfall. In the final moments of Raoul Walsh's White Heat (1949), the psychopathic protagonist Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) declares \"top of the world, Ma! \" before blowing himself to bits rather than submitting to the policemen who have him surrounded. the journey with him, This friend may be responsible forgivingthe protagonist his first break in the business, only to be eclipsed by the hero later. He is often instru­ mental in the protagonist's downfall, either as abetrayer or as a victim ofthe central character's greed and lust for power. Antagonists come in two forms: law enforcement agents and fellow gangsters. In stark contrast to por­ trayals in traditional procedurals, the police in gangster movies are portrayed as oppressors who are corrupt, in­ competent, or both. They are sometimes in league with the gangster antagonist, the current kingpin who lacks the imagination or courage of our hero. His overthrow is often one of the first major obstacles the protagonist must overcome. Of course, the ultimate antagonist in manygangster movies is the protagonist himself. Legend has it that when the gangster Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he replied, \"Because that's where the money is.\" The same sort of logic ex- Six Major American Genres 93 plains the setting of the vast majority of gangster films. Movies about organized crime are set in urban locations because organized crime flourishes primarily in large cities. The particulars of the setting evolve as the plot progresses. The story usually opens in a slum, develops on the mean streets downtown, and then works its way upward into luxury penthouses, In contrast to most movie stars, the actors most closely associated with earlygangsterfilms were dimin­ utive and relatively unattractive. The authority that actors like Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney con­ veyed on-screenwas made all the more powerfulbytheir atypical appearance. (In another twist of Hollywood logic, Cagney-whose gangster portrayals were among the most brutal in cinema history-was equally belov d as a star ofhappy-go-lucky musicals.) Other notable gangster films include Little Caesar (1931; director Mervyn LeRoy); The Public Enemy (1931; director William A Wellman); Scarface (1932; direc­ tor Howard Hawks); White Heat (1949; director Raoul Walsh); Touchez pas au grisbi (1954; director Jacques Becker); Rififi (1955; director Jules Dassin); Bonnie and Clyde (1967; director Arthur Penn); Le Samouraf (196'7; director Jean-Pierre Melville); Battles without Honor or Humanity (1973; director Kinji Fukasaku); Scarface (1983; director Brian De Palma); Once upon a Time in America (1984; director Sergio Leone); The Krays (1990; director Peter Medak); Miller's Crossing (1990; direc­ tor Joel Coen); Reservoir Dogs (1992; director Quenti Tarantino); Sonatine (1993; director Takeshi Kitano); Road to Perdition (2002; director Sam Mendes); City of God (2002; directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund); and Mesrine: Killer Instinct and Mesrine: Public Enemy #1 (2008; director Jean-Frarn;ois Richet). Fil m Nair I n the early 1940s, the outlook, tone, and style ofAmer­ ican genre films grew decidedly darker with the emer­ gence of film noir (from the French for \"black film\"), a shift clearlydenotedby its name. Not that movies hadn't already demonstrated a cynical streak. The gangste movies that surfaced in the previous decade featured antiheroes and less-than-flattering portrayals of our cit-­ ies and institutions. World War I, Prohibition, and the Great Depression began the trend toward more realis·· tic, and thus bleaker, artistic and narrative representa·· tions of the world, as evidenced in the written word of\n\n28. 94 Chapter 3 Types of Movies Fatalism in film noir Film noir movies sometimes present information and events in a way that heightens the audience's sense that the hard-luck protagonist is doomed from the moment the story opens. Director and screenwriter Billy Wilder pushed this technique to the extreme in two of his most famous noir movies, both of which reveal the demise of the protagonist. The first moments of Double Indemnity (1944) open with antihero Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) stumbling wounded into his office to confess to the murder he will spend the rest of the story trying to get away with [1 J. Sunset Boulevard (1950) goes one step further. The entire film is narrated in first-person voice-over by a protagonist (William Holden) presented in the opening scene as a floating corpse [21. t e time. Pulp-fictionwriters like Dashiell Hammetthad been publishing the hard-boiled stories that formed the foundationof film noir since the early 1930s. In fact, if not for the efforts of Hollywood and the U.S. government during World War II, film noir might have come along sooner. Instead, gung-ho war movies were designed to build support for the war effort, and lighthearted musicals and comedies were produced to provide needed distractions from overwhelming world events. Yet the same war that helped delay the arrival of film noir also helped give birth to the new genre by exposing ordinary Americans to the horrors of war. Whether in person or through newsreels and newspa­ pers, troops and citizens alike witnessed death camps, battlefield slaughters. the rise of fascism. and countless other atrocities. Many of the genre's greatest directors. including Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, andFritzLang,werethemselves marked by the hardship and persecution they had expe­ rienced before leaving war-torn Europe for Hollywood. Others, like Samuel Fuller, fought as American soldiers. The atomic bombthatended thewaralso demonstrated that not even a nation as seemingly secure as the United States was safe from its devastatingpower. The financial boom that the war effort had generated ended abruptly as the soldiers returned home to a changed world of eco­ nomic uncertainty. Film noir fed off the postwar disil­ lusionment that followed prolonged exposure to this intimidating new perspective. In part because many of the early noir movies were low-budget \"B\" movies (so called because they often screened in the second slot of double features), the genre was not initially recognized or respected by most American scholars. Its emphasis on corruption and de­ spair was seen as an unflattering portrayal of the Amer­ ican character. It was left to French critics, some of whom went on to make genre films of their own, to rec­ ognize (and name) the genre. In fact, the American critic Paul Schrader (himself a filmmakerwho has written and directed noir films) feels that film noir is not a genre at all. He claims that \"film noir . . . is not defined, as are the Western and gang­ ster genres, by conventions of setting and conflict, but rather by the more subtle qualities of tone and mood.\"4 4.
