        "text": "Bronislau Kaper composed the score for the 1950 film A Life of Her Own, starring Lana Turner as a model whoâs having an affair with a married man played by Ray Milland. Kaperâs film score was nominated for a Golden Globe award, but the picture did not do well at the box office. However, the lush and haunting score was so appealing that it was used for a second film in 1952, Invitation, starring Dorothy Maguire and Van Johnson. Paul Francis Webster wrote the lyric for Kaperâs main theme, called simply âInvitation.â So although Kaper wrote the melody in 1950, the songâs date is usually given as 1952.\n\nWebster had collaborated with Duke Ellington on 1941âs âI Got It Bad and That Ainât Goodâ and won two Academy Awards with Sammy Fain for âSecret Loveâ and âLove Is a Many-Splendored Thingâ and another with Johnny Mandel for âThe Shadow of Your Smile.â Kaper (whose first name is sometimes spelled âBronislawâ) won an Oscar for his 1953 score for the film Lili and wrote two other songs which have entered the jazz repertoire: âOn Green Dolphin Streetâ and âAll Godâs Chillun Got Rhythm.â\n\nKaperâs unforgettable melody is admirably matched by Websterâs equally haunting and somewhat mysterious lyric:\n\nWherever I go youâre the glow of temptation,\n\nGlancing my way in the grey of the dawn\n\nAnd always your smile holds that strange invitation\n\nThen you are gone\n\nWhere oh where have you gone?\n\nGeorge Shearing arranged âInvitationâ for piano, and Frank Mantooth wrote a Latin arrangement of the song. Rosemary Clooney recorded it in 1963 with a lush background arranged by Nelson Riddle. Without ever having charted, âInvitationâ seeped into the jazz standard repertoire. Just since 2000 it has been recorded by vocalists Freddy Cole, Andy Bey, Patricia Barber, and the New Four Freshmen; pianists Rene Rosnee, Randy Halberstadt, and Steve Kuhn; saxophonists Herb Geller, Vincent Herring, and Don Braden; trumpeter Brian Lynch, bassist Ray Drummond, and Bob Florence Limited Edition. It is also featured on the soundtrack of For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story."
