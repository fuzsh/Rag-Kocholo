Such as this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOudGh8psEo\n\nHowever today, we have to be Epic composers. We are like Transformers, and each piece has to be more epic that the other guys.\n\nAnd any old styles won't do anymore, its got to be trendy (what's Han's doing now?).\n\nAnd LOUD (how does TJ do it?).\n\nOne-ups-man-ship is the name of the game - like Charlie Sheen says. If you're not winning, you need a new sample library.\n\nIts like WWE sports dude. Epic winning. Bi-winning!\n\no=? o=?\n\nNo more chance just to write different styles of music simply because they compliment the film. That's so \"last century\"! :wink:\n\nRe: How to do great arrangements...., Composer \"Bronislau Kaper\"\n\nYes but with samples, we are free to do anything!\n\nYet, we still restrict ourselves. Odd isn't it?\n\nWe are like freed slaves that prefer to stay close to our master.\n\nAs Wendy Carlos said, we have a whole chess board to play on, yet, we are all crowding in on the same square.\n\nRe: How to do great arrangements...., Composer \"Bronislau Kaper\"\n\nYes but with samples, we are free to do anything!\n\nYet, we still restrict ourselves.

But we can learn from cynicism too.\n\nI'm a bit cheerier today.\n\nActually, I think the reason everyone's targeting the same chess square is that's the one that's making money. If other squares were also profitable, I think people would gravitate there too.\n\nRe: How to do great arrangements...., Composer \"Bronislau Kaper\"\n\nSorry, I was in a cynical mood.... :?

You don't know when you will be called to compose something or choose to compose something because of the money. A person won' just compose, they'll work with the director, they will hear a temp track, they'll have done research on what is popular and what is happening now for the style they need to compose. All that will mean the same \"chess square\"^_- if it's profitable.\n\nRe: How to do great arrangements...., Composer \"Bronislau Kaper\"\n\nMaybe I have written a wrong headline here on this thread.\n\nWhat I first mean: Click on the CD`s pictures on the link I posted, and then there you can listen to many audio examples, and then think about arranging, knowledge of composing e.t.c. .... .\n\nThis thread is not meant as an attack to the modern film music!\n\nI have changed the headline into: \"How great these arrangements are!
