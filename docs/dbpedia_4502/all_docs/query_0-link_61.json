        "text": "Performers:\n\nDaniel Rotem – soprano and tenor saxophones\n\nKuba Stankiewicz – piano, music arrangements\n\nDarek Oleszkiewicz – double bass\n\nTina Raymond – drums\n\nWhat if we ventured the theory that all that jazz flows out of the Vistula River? Kuba Stankiewicz, an excellent jazz pianist and composer, began his professional career in the mid-1980s, playing with Jan ‘Ptaszyn’ Wróblewski and Zbigniew Namysłowski. He studied at Boston’s Berklee College of Music, and played in Artie Shaw’s orchestra in the US. Having returned to Poland, he has focused for many years now on Polish film music from before WWII, and its influences on the world’s jazz. These explorations bore fruit in the form of successful albums with music by Victor Young, Bronisław Kaper, and Henryk Wars – all in Stankiewicz’s own original arrangements. Eventually he came to the source, since both Young and Wars acknowledged the overwhelming impact on their music of Roman Statkowski, an outstanding Warsaw-based teacher and composer (who in turn had studied with Rimsky-Korsakov, among others). Stankiewicz set motifs from Statkowski’s opera Maria (1906) and turned his arrangements into a jazz tale that is Romantic and contemporary at the same time."
