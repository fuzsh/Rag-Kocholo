        "meta_description": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBronisław Kaper ([brɔniswaf ˈkapɛr], February 5, 1902 – April 26, 1983) was a Polish film composer who scored films and musical theater in Germany, France, and the USA. The American immigration authorities misspelled his name as Bronislau Kaper. He was also variously credited as Bronislaw Kaper, Bronislaw Kapper, Benjamin Kapper, and Edward Kane.\n\nKaper is now perhaps best remembered as the composer of the jazz standards \"On Green Dolphin Street\" (lyrics by Ned Washington) and \"Invitation\" (lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) which were originally the respective title tracks for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's films Green Dolphin Street (1947) and Invitation (1952). He also scored the MGM film musical Lili (1953) for which he received the Academy Award for Best Original Score, MGM's 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, and the TV series The F.B.I. (1965–1974).",
