This was apparent in his choices of subject, as in Kullervon surumarssi (Kullervo's Funeral March, 1880) for orchestra, based on a topic from the Kalevala, and in his quoting of Finnish folk tunes as in the two pieces entitled Suomalainen rapsodia (Finnish Rhapsody, 1881, 1886).

Kärkkäinen has later taken up a more expressive approach, as in his orchestral works Sarja I (Suite I, 1997), and Läpi yön (Nocturnal Journey, 1999).

During his education, he also attended many summer composition master courses arranged by Centre Acanthes in Avignon and Aix-en-Provence, France, studying with Iannis Xenakis, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, and Georges Aperghis, among others.

He joined the faculty of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL in 1967 and became a professor there in 1973.

In his youth, Karłowicz spent some time travelling through Europe (Heilderberg, Prague, Dresden) and in 1887, his family settled in Warsaw where he studied violin with Jan Jankowski and Stanislaw Barcewicz. After a few years, poor health (both mental and physical) forced him to give up the violin, but he quickly began studying composition with Gustaw Roguski in Warsaw (1894) and later with Heinrich Urban in Berlin (1895-1901). His early compositions include short piano pieces, the Serenade op. 2 for string orchestra, Muzyka do bialej golabki (Music to the White Dove) Op.6 for full orchestra, and various songs which were published in two collections as Op. 1 and Op. 3 Karlsen, Kjell Mork\n\nmore...31 Mar. 1947\n\nOslo, NorwayNorwegian organist and composer Karlsson, Erik Mikael\n\nmore...10 Dec. 1967\n\nNynäshamn, Swedena composer of electroacoustic music since 1985.

In the late 1970s, he turned  perhaps inspired by the new rise of Modernism  to a more chromatic idiom, though without abandoning his roots. His most significant work in this experimental period was Komposition för orgel och symfonisk blåsorkester (Composition for organ and concert band, 1983). After a transition period of a few years, Karlsson arrived at his current style in the early 1990s. This can be seen as a sort of mature return to his early ideals, beginning with the intensely melodic and technically challenging Violin Concerto (1991/93), whose Romantically tinted Neo-Classicism recalls Prokofiev. The Violin Concerto was also Karlsson's first work in a traditional genre; it was later followed by the powerful Bartók-like String Quartet (1997) and the First Symphony (1999) Karnovich, Yuri Larovich23 Dec. 1884\n\nKaunas, Lithuania22 Dec. 1941\n\nKaunas, LithuaniaLithuanian composer Karzew (or Kartsev, Karzen, Kartzev), Alexander Alexeyevich19 Jul. 1883\n\nMoscow, Russia3 Jul. 1953\n\nMoscow, RussiaRussian composer Kasatschenko (or Kazatsjenko, Kazatchenko, Kazachenko), Grigorii (or Grigory) Alexeyevich (or Ivanovich) (also Nikolai)3 May 1858\n\nSt. Petersburg, Russia18 May 1938\n\nLeningrad, RussiaRussian composer and conductor Kasbergen, Marinus\n\nmore...13 Nov. 1936\n\nKrimpen aan de Lek\n\nThe NetherlandsDutch composer Kaschubec, Erich\n\nmore...18991945German composer Käser, Mischa\n\nmore...1959\n\nZurich, Switzerlandstudied guitar in Winterthur, lute in Basel and composition both with H.

Kastners complete and concise treatise discusses the standard orchestral instruments and several obscure and ancient instruments. Intended principally for young composers, it provides the most detailed descriptions of the standard wind instruments of his day and discusses recent developments like the ophicleide and valved brass instruments. After the publication of the Traité, Kastner released a supplement including Aldophe Saxs newest innovations, entitled Cours dinstrumentation, which included musical examples of principals discussed in the Traité.

Its successor, Nummisuutarit (The Cobblers on the Heath, 1930), based on the highly popular comedy by national author Aleksis Kivi, did not fare nearly as well.

In addition to writing instrumental and vocal works, Koskelin has shown an interest in crossdiscipline projects.

For example, in one of his best-known works, Jaakobin pojat (Jacob's Sons, 1976), the Biblical list of names is presented using Sprechgesang, whispers, glissandos, highest and lowest possible notes of undetermined pitch, and a spatial element Kostelanetz, Andre\n\nmore...23 Dec 1901\n\nSt. Petersburg, Russia13 Jan 1980\n\nPort-au-Prince, Haitiwas one of the biggest names in American light orchestral music in the middle of the 20th century.
