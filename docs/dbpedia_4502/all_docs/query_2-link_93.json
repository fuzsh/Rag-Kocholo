        "text": "Annual Awards Competition Recognizes Young Emerging Musicians\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic announces the winners of the 2006 Bronislaw Kaper Awards for Young Artists. The February 25 competition was held on stage at Walt Disney Concert Hall for the piano category with Kenric Tam of Los Altos Hills winning first place; Rossina Grieco of La Jolla winning second place; Vijay Vankatesh of Laguna Nigel winning third place; and Shan Shan Li of Pacific Palisades being named Most Promising Musician.\n\nA total of fifteen young pianists between the ages of 9 and 17 competed in the first round where they were required to play excerpts from a solo piano sonata, one of the 48 Preludes and Fugues from the Well Tempered Clavier by J.S. Bach, and Samuel Barber's Nocturne. Four pianists moved on to the finals and performed excerpts from a piano concerto of their choice.\n\nA distinguished panel of pianists served as judges for the competition, including Los Angeles Philharmonic pianist Joanne Pearce-Martin, renowned new-music champions Gloria Cheng and Vicki Ray, and internationally acclaimed soloists Norman Krieger and Walter Ponce.\n\nAward winners receive monetary awards: first place received $2,500, made possible by the Foothill Philharmonic Committee; second place received $2,000 made possible by Los Angeles Philharmonic Concertmaster Emeritus David Frisina; third prize won $1,000 made possible by the Valley Juniors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and Most Promising Musician won $500, made possible by Encore.\n\nThe Bronislaw Kaper Awards for Young Artists are held annually by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the piano and strings instrumental categories, which alternate each year. Named in honor of the late Bronislaw Kaper, a renowned film composer who served for more than 15 years as a member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association's Board of Directors, the Awards encourage the development of young and gifted musicians.\n\n# # #"
