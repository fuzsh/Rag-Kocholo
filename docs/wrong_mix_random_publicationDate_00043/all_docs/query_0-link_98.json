        "text": "By STEPHEN HAWKINS AP Baseball Writer\n\nARLINGTON, Texas — When Teoscar Hernández needed a moment to calm down during the Home Run Derby, the Dodgers outfielder got a boost from a former teammate who just happened to be last year’s champion.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. wore a Toronto Blue Jays jersey with Hernández’s name and No. 37 on the back as he watched the competition, honoring his friend from their time as Toronto teammates from 2017-22.\n\n“That was a surprise of the night,” Hernández said. “He brings my jersey from Toronto, and when he goes to home plate. He was trying to calm (me) down, and so he had passed two times, and it works. He said he wanted to help me going into the last round.”\n\nHernández won the Home Run Derby when he edged local star Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals, 14-13, in the final round Monday night. Hernández, who has been “invaluable” to the Dodgers during his first season with the team, received $1 million and a diamond-encrusted chain for his win.\n\nThe 31-year-old Hernández hit 49 homers over three rounds that totaled 3.98 miles (his longest traveled 466 feet) and became the first Dodgers player to win the derby among 11 who have tried. While not participating in the derby this year, Guerrero gave Hernández advice during breaks.\n\n“If I have to bet, it doesn’t matter who I’m going against, I’m going to bet on myself,” Hernández said when asked if he felt like the underdog. “People maybe underestimate myself.”\n\nWitt, needing one home run to tie with one out remaining, drove a ball to one of the deepest parts of Globe Life Field in left-center, where it hit halfway up the wall to the left of the 410-foot sign.\n\n“When I hit it I knew I kind of – I didn’t hit it great. But, yeah, I just was trying to blow on it or something,” Witt said with a chuckle. “The first thing I thought was just no pop. … We got to do a couple more curls or something.”\n\nKansas City has never had a derby winner.\n\nBoth finished their two-minute final round with 11 homers, before bonus swings were added. Witt came up short of his first two bonus swings, then hit two homers in a row – one a 457-foot drive that got him one more swing.\n\nWitt was the No. 2 overall pick by the Royals in 2019 out of Colleyville Heritage High School, about 15 miles north of the Texas Rangers’ stadium. It was his first time in the derby, but he was the high school home run champion in Washington in 2018 – and is the only player to compete in both contests.\n\nThe 24-year-old Witt finished with 50 homers overall that traveled 3.8 miles.\n\nWitt had knocked out Cleveland switch-hitter José Ramírez 17-12 in the semifinals. Hernández beat Philadelphia’s Alec Bohm, 16-15, after a tiebreaker when both got three swings – Hernández hit two out, and Bohm one. They were tied at 14 after the three-minute segment and their bonus rounds, and Bohm came close to avoiding that, but the last ball he hit then landed on the warning track in left-center field.\n\nRamírez and Bohm both hit 21 homers to pace the first round. Witt started with 20 homers and Hernández had 19.\n\nThe New York Mets’ Pete Alonso fell short in his bid to join Ken Griffey Jr. as a three-time derby champion when he hit only 12 homers in the first round.\n\nInstead of a single-elimination bracket like last year, the four hitters with the most homers in the first round advanced to the semifinal round. It then became a bracket-style competition.\n\nAlonso hit a 428-foot homer to left-center field on his first swing, but couldn’t get into a rhythm. The others knocked out after the first round were hometown favorite Adolis García of Texas, Atlanta’s Marcell Ozuna and Baltimore’s Gunnar Henderson.\n\n“It’s disappointing, but for me, I think it’s really just a blessing and it’s just fun being out there,” Alonso said. “At the end of the day, it wasn’t my day.”\n\nOzuna did have the longest homer of the night at 473 feet. Angels star Mike Trout in 2022, and Oakland’s Seth Brown in 2021 have both hit 472 feet homers in games at the stadium that is now in its fifth season.\n\nBohm, one of a franchise-record eight Phillies named All-Stars, has only 11 homers this season – the fewest among the eight derby competitors. He said he was going to try to hit as many balls as he could to left field and did – pulling all 21 of his homers that way in the first round.\n\nIt still felt like 100 degrees outside the ballpark when the derby began, but the retractable roof was closed on the stadium that opened in 2020. When the Rangers hosted the 1995 All-Star Game across the street in their old stadium without a roof, the derby wasn’t yet a prime-time event and was held in the sweltering mid-afternoon heat.\n\nFrank Thomas won in 1995 with 15 homers over three rounds in a different format. Albert Belle finished with a total of 16, then a Home Run Derby record, but Thomas beat him in the final round, 3-2."
