        "text": "5 Songs About Los Angeles – Explained\n\nSure, LA is a movie town (Hollywood and all that) but it’s also a major music market, with countless musicians, singers, songwriters, and performers calling LA their stomping ground. In addition to serving as the backdrop for many pop culture juggernauts and jam sessions, LA has served as a huge inspiration and major character in many of our favorite musical hits over the years.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at five of our favorite songs about Los Angeles, and as a bonus, we’ll let you know which of our LA Tours to book to experience the Los Angeles movie locations up close and personal. (Bonus points if you sing along.)\n\n1. All I Wanna Do — Sheryl Crow (1993)\n\nNo song in the world so brazenly screams “Los Angeles” more than Sheryl Crow’s 1993 mega-hit “All I Wanna Do”. Quite literally, the song declares “This is LA!” as the beat kicks in. “All I Wanna Do” rocketed a then-unknown Sheryl Crow to superstardom, peaking at #2 on the Billboard charts, and sweeping the 1995 Grammy Awards in the “Record of the Year” and “Best Pop Vocal Performance” categories.\n\nThe song features a rollicking beat and lyrics by a poet named Wyn Cooper. At the time, Crow and her musician friends met weekly to jam at their “Tuesday Night Music Club” sessions. Searching for inspiration, Crow’s producer found a book of poetry in a used bookstore in Pasadena, and brought Crow a poem called “Fun” by Wyn Cooper. Crow composed the song to Cooper’s words, finding it easy to sink into Cooper’s narrator character. Once the song became a hit, Crow used the song to promote Cooper’s book, earning him considerable royalties.\n\nThe song reflects a laid back LA lifestyle, and is told from the point of view of a character named “Billy,” sitting in a bar and watching his life go by. While the music video was actually shot in front of the Roxy Theatre in Clarksville, Tennessee, you can head to LA’s Roxy Theatre on the famous Sunset Strip to feel like a rock star. The song prominently features “Santa Monica Boulevard” as a repeated motif, and references the protagonist sitting in a bar across the street from a car wash. While Crow does not mention a particular bar as the setting for the song, you can check out any of the bars on Santa Monica Boulevard around West Hollywood for a rockin’ 90’s inspired experience. Our favorite way to experience LA? Take our evening Hollywood Hills Hike and watch the sun go down over Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nLA Locations:\n\nSanta Monica Boulevard\n\nThe Sunset Strip\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Roxy (Ok, this is technically Tennessee, but we promise the LA Roxy on the Sunset Strip is far cooler and more star-studded.)\n\nJust…LA. In general.\n\nFeatured in these Tours:\n\nLA in a Day – Los Angeles Bike Tour\n\nHollywood Bike Tour\n\nHollywood Hills Hike\n\nSunset Strip Walking Tour\n\n2. California Love — 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Roger Troutman (1995)\n\nHow do you not hear the funky opening talkbox “California Love” and not immediately feel ready to hit the dance floor? The second song on our list of our favorite songs about LA is 2Pac and Dr. Dre’s 1995 smash hit ode to the Golden State. While there are several disputes about the song’s origin, rumor has it that 2Pac first heard Dre’s version of the song (which featured Dre rapping for 3 verses,) at a barbecue at his Calabasas home, and wanted to write his own verse. 2Pac wrote his verse in 15 minutes at the barbecue, and the “west” is history.\n\nThe beat samples hits from many prolific musicians, including Joe Cocker’s “Woman to Woman,” and Ronnie Hudson’s “West Coast Poplock.” The song also prominently features vocals by Roger Troutman, known for pioneering the funk movement and his use of a talk-box hooked up to an instrument. (That’s where those funky, distorted sounding “California knows how to party” lines come from! The “shake it, shake it baby,” you hear in the song is Troutman interpolating his lines from his Zapp hit “Dance Floor,” also into a talkbox.)\n\nThe song was a huge success, hitting #1 on the Billboard 100 and was nominated for 2 (posthumous) Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a duo or a group. The song highlights swingin’ times in the Wild Wild West, pays homage to the LA cities of Watts and Compton, and gets us amped about some of the best places in Los Angeles. It is arguably 2Pac’s most famous songs, and one of our favorite anthems about our favorite city.\n\nLA Locations:\n\nThe City of LA\n\nThe West Side\n\nCompton\n\nWatts\n\nLong Beach\n\nPasadena\n\nFeatured in these Tours:\n\nLA in a Day Bike Tour\n\nHollywood Bike Tour\n\nManhattan and Redondo Beach Private Bike Tour\n\nPrivate South Bay Nature Walk and Hike Tour\n\n3. Beverly Hills — Weezer (2005)\n\nFor the past 15 years, it’s been nearly impossible to hear or utter the phrase “Beverly Hills” without fervently breaking out into song, clapping your hands, and stomping your feet. (Just me?) Nothing (quite literally) screams “Beverly Hills” more than Weezer’s 2005 smash hit anthem about aspirations of stardom, glory, and glamour. Weezer lead singer River Cuomo states that he got the idea to pen the tune after attending the opening of the new Hollywood Bowl, flipping through a program, spotting a photo of Wilson Phillips, and fantasizing about leaving an ordinary life behind and living like a superstar.\n\nThe group went on to film a tongue in cheek music video at the Playboy Mansion (which technically isn’t in Beverly Hills, but in neighboring Holmby Hills,) and featured a cameo by none other than the legendary Hugh Hefner himself. While the song has a sarcastic vibe, Cuomo intended for the sentiment to be honest, and regards the final verse as one of the finest things he’s ever written. We highly recommend throwing this on and blasting it through Beverly Hills. Better yet, do so on our world-famous Beverly Hills Celebrity Bike Tour, that’s where WE want to be.\n\nLA Locations:\n\nBeverly Hills (duh)\n\nHolmby Hills – The Playboy Mansion\n\nHollywood Hills\n\nFeatured in these Tours:\n\nBeverly Hills Celebrity Bike Tour\n\nBeverly Hills Walking Tour\n\nBeverly Hills Private Bike Tour\n\nPrivate Beverly Hills Hike Tour – hike past dozens of celebrity mansions in Beverly Hills’ famed Franklin Canyon!\n\nInterested in more LA movie star homes?

Free Fallin’ — Tom Petty (1989)\n\nFree Fallin’ is a 1989 sleeper hit, highlighting a young girl’s struggle to come of age in the San Fernando Valley. Written by Tom Petty, the song was almost a throwaway, as Petty struggled to find lyrics appropriate for the now-iconic opening chords to the tune. Petty was jamming with his partner, Jeff Lynne, and made up the first couple of phrases (“she’s a good girl, loves her mama…”) and made Lynne laugh. They continued to play, and completed the song in 2 days.\n\nThe song references multiple Los Angeles filming locations, giving locations in the San Fernando Valley, or simply, “The Valley” top billing. If you’re reading this and need to ask “What is the Valley, anyway?” We’ve got you. The San Fernando Valley is the massive urban valley north of Central Los Angeles, bound by the mountains in the surrounding Transverse Ranges of Southern California. The Valley has 1.77 million people, and is home to strip malls galore, Valley Girls, Kardashians, and Paul Thomas Anderson’s filming universe. Petty sings about numerous Valley locations in “Free Fallin’,” including the suburban neighborhood of Reseda, Ventura Boulevard, Mulholland Drive, and more.\n\nThe song was a huge hit, peaking at #7 on the Billboard charts and ranked #179 on Rolling Stone’s list of the Top 500 Songs of All Time. It’s hard to think of a song that’s more quintessentially Los Angeles: cool vibe, good views, and a great song to listen to while cruising down the freeway (in your car or on an LA bike tour.)\n\nLA Locations:\n\nThe San Fernando Valley\n\nMulholland Drive\n\nReseda\n\nThe 101 Freeway\n\nThe Westside Pavilion (It plays the mall in the music video! Fun fact: this also played the iconic mall in “Clueless,” one of our other favorite films about LA.)\n\nFeatured in these Tours:\n\nGriffith Park Experience – views on views of the Valley!\n\nMalibu Mountain Bike Tour\n\nPrivate Runyon Canyon Hike Tour\n\nWestlake Group Bike Tour\n\n5. I Love LA — Randy Newman (1983)\n\nIt’s no secret that at Bikes and Hikes LA, “we love LA,” too! This iconic LA tune was penned by Randy Newman in 1983, and inspired by a very Los Angeles conversation Newman had with Eagles member Don Henley aboard a private jet (as one does.) Henley was lamenting not being able to charter Learjets, a fleet of private jets anymore, and Newman sarcastically responded “You can’t live on a million a year anymore.” Henley suggested Newman write a song about Los Angeles and the arrogance surrounding it.\n\n“I Love LA” is Newman’s anthemic love letter to Los Angeles, even taking musical inspiration from the Beach Boys, a band to which he pays homage musically and lyrically in the tune. Newman highlights different LA regions throughout the tune, name-dropping Imperial Highway, the West Side, the South Bay, and famous streets, such as Victory Boulevard, Century Boulevard, and Santa Monica Boulevard (which is also home to Bikes and Hikes LA, and Bike Shop LA!) The song is a snarky take about LA’s excess wealth, out of touch stereotype, and self-love. The song is played after home team wins at major LA sporting events (the LA Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Galaxy, and the Kings all use it in their games.) It’s been used in many films (its cameo in “The Bean Movie” is a personal favorite of mine,) parodied (hello, Kris Jenner “I Love My Friends!”) and serves as the city’s unofficial anthem. Take any of our Los Angeles tours and see why “we love it” too!\n\nLA Locations:\n\nImperial Highway\n\nPacific Coast Highway\n\nSanta Monica\n\nCentury Boulevard\n\nVictory Boulevard\n\nSanta Monica Boulevard\n\nVenice Beach\n\nDowntown Los Angeles\n\nDisneyland\n\nInglewood/Randy’s Donuts\n\n…and more!\n\nFeatured in these Tours:\n\nLos Angeles Full City Tour on a Bike\n\nVenice and Santa Monica Bike Tour\n\nDowntown Los Angeles Private Walking Tour\n\nCrank up the volume, roll down the windows, and blast these tunes as you come visit Los Angeles!\n\nThere are so many ways to see Los Angeles — and we recommend you start with our tours of Los Angeles!
