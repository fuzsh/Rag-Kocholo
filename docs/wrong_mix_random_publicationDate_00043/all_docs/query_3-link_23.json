        "text": "History\n\nBeverly Hills' history unfolded as a saga of resilience and transformation. The area was originally inhabited by the native Tongva tribe who poetically called their spot El Rodeo de las Aguas, or \"the gathering of the waters.\" Initially ranch and farmland, the region later transitioned to lima bean fields which was then bought by oil investors led by Burton E. Green. In the early 1900s, the land would be developed for residential property after Green struck water instead of oil, thus creating the Rodeo Land and Water Company.\n\nTo attract potential home buyers to the burgeoning enclave, The Beverly Hills Hotel was built in 1912 by Margaret Anderson, two years before the City of Beverly Hills was incorporated on January 28, 1914. This luxurious establishment not only accommodated travelers, but also served residents as a city hall, community center, movie theater and church. The Beverly Hills we know today became the “home to the stars” in the 1920s when a migration of entertainment industry figures made their move into the city after the era’s most glamorous couple, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, bought land and built their estate, Pickfair.\n\nWhen water supply concerns brought annexation by the City of Los Angeles to the political agenda, it was Mary Pickford and other Hollywood heavyweights of the time who would lead opposition and bring the 850 residents to vote against annexation and keep Beverly Hills independent on April 24, 1923. In the 1930s, the iconic Beverly Hills Shield was designed by the Warner Bros. art department at the request of studio president and resident Jack Warner to mark Beverly Hills city limits, which are still in use today.\n\nBeverly Hills: The First 100 Years by Robert S.
