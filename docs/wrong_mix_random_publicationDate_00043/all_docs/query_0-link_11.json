        "text": "Many classic TV shows have been made into reboots or revivals, but Beverly Hills, 90210 stands a cut above. The iconic Fox hit was reimagined not once, but twice. The show focused on twins Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) after they moved from Minneapolis to Beverly Hills, California. Upon their arrival, they formed friendships with Dylan McKay (Luke Perry), Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), David Silver (Brian Austin Green), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris), Valerie Macon (Tiffani Thiessen) and Emily Valentine (Christine McCarthy). The series aired from 1990 to 2000 to before being rebooted in 2008 with an all-new cast. In summer 2019, much of the original cast reunited for BH90210. “We are all so excited to go back to work together because it’s like family coming back together,” Spelling exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2019 about the project. The group experienced tragedy ahead of the show’s air date, however, when Perry died after suffering a massive stroke at the age of 52 in March 2019. Scroll down to see what the rest of the OG cast is doing now:\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nJennie Garth\n\nThe actress ruled West Beverly from 1990 to 2000 as Beverly Hills princess Kelly Taylor. Kelly was BFFs with Donna and Brenda and part of one of TV’s greatest love triangles, dating both Brandon and Dylan. Since the series wrapped, the mother of three starred in What I Like About You and Mystery Girls and competed on Dancing With the Stars in 2007. Garth was also featured in the 2008 rendition of the show, playing a grown-up version of the role that made her famous. She then rejoined the rest of the 90210 OG members in summer 2019 to play herself, reminiscing on her days as Kelly Taylor.\n\nGarth and Spelling launched their Beverly Hills, 90210, rewatch podcast, “9021OMG,” in 2020. A year later, the Illinois native starred in two TV movies.\n\nIn 2013, after 12 years of marriage, the actress divorced Twilight star Peter Facinelli, with whom she shares three kids. She went on to tie the knot with actor Dave Abrams in 2015.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nJason Priestley\n\nThe Canadian actor played always-ethical high school heartthrob Brandon Walsh from 1990 to 2000, leaving at the beginning of the ninth season as his character traveled to many locations around the world for his career in journalism. Priestley, who has played Matt Shade on Global TV's Private Eyes since 2016, returned to his former zip code of 90210 when the series’ six-episode quasi-reboot aired on Fox in August 2019.\n\nHe shares a daughter, Ava, and a son, Dashiell, with wife Naomi Lowde-Priestley, whom he married in 2005.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nShannen Doherty\n\nFamous for causing trouble on set, Doherty played Brandon Walsh's headstrong, wannabe thespian twin sister Brenda from 1990 to 1994. Though her character departed the show physically, she was referred to as Dylan’s significant other until season 9, when he announced they had separated. The actress then spent three years on the CW hit Charmed but left the show in 2001 due to a rumored feud with costar Alyssa Milano.\n\nShe reprised her role as Brenda Walsh in 90210 for a handful of episodes and joined her OG costars for the BH90210 revival. Doherty was a part of the short-lived 2018 Heathers reboot and also appeared on Dancing With the Stars in 2010. Following Perry’s passing, she appeared on Riverdale in October 2019 as a tribute to her late onscreen love.\n\nDoherty struggled with health issues in 2015, when she revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. By 2017, she was in remission, but in February 2020, she announced that the cancer had returned and was stage IV. In November 2023, Doherty revealed that the cancer had spread to her bones.\n\nShe married and divorced twice (Rick Salomon, Ashley Hamilton) before meeting and falling in love with Kurt Iswarienko, whom she wed in 2011. Doherty and Iswarienko split in 2023.\n\nDoherty died in July 2024 at the age of 53 following her cancer battle.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nBrian Austin Green\n\nFrom 1990 to 2000, Green played the lovable-yet-nerdy David Silver, who aspired to be a hip-hop artist. The actor has appeared in several hit series since his Beverly Hills days, including Freddie in 2005, Desperate Housewives from 2010 to 2011 and Anger Management, in which he played Sean Healy, in 2012. He played himself in the 2019 90210 reboot.\n\nGreen has four older children — son Kassius, whom he shares with ex Vanessa Marcil, and Noah, Bodhi and Journey, whom he shares with ex-wife Megan Fox.\n\nAfter Green and Fox split in 2020, he started seeing Dancing With the Stars pro Sharna Burgess. Green, who appeared on The Masked Singer and judged The Masked Dancer, joined DWTS as Burgess' partner for season 30 in 2021. In February 2022, they announced Burgess’ pregnancy. Just five days later, Green and Fox’s divorce was settled. Green and Burgess welcomed son Zane in June 2022 and announced their engagement the following year in September 2023.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nTori Spelling\n\nAt 17, the sTori Telling author starred as virginal Donna Martin for the duration of the series. She later admitted she was cast in the role thanks to her father, the late Aaron Spelling, who created the hit show. Spelling has been busy since her stint as Donna in both the original series and its reboot. In 2006, she landed her own reality series, Tori & Dean: Sweet Home Hollywood, which centered on her life with then-husband Dean McDermott and their five children. She also had a role in a reboot of her cult 1996 Lifetime film, Mother, May I Sleep With Danger? During 2019’s short-lived BH90210 show, Spelling trolled her and her husband’s history of financial struggles. Spelling cohosts the “9021OMG” podcast with Garth.\n\nSpelling and McDermott sparked split speculation in 2021 after the actress revealed they no longer sleep in the same bed and he wasn’t included in her family’s Christmas card. In March 2022, however, McDermott included Spelling in his International Women’s Day tribute.\n\nIn June 2023, McDermott announced via Instagram in a since-deleted post that he and Spelling called it quits after 17 years. He confirmed their separation that November 2023, revealing that his alcoholism contributed to the breakup. Spelling reportedly filed for divorce in March 2024 just two months before their 18-year wedding anniversary.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nLuke Perry\n\nThe iconic actor portrayed brooding teen rebel Dylan McKay — and Brenda Walsh's first love — from 1990 to 2000. McKay was also romantically linked to Kelly Taylor and Valerie Malone on the show. Post-90210, the father of two took to the stage in the London's West End theater production of When Harry Met Sally alongside Alyson Hannigan. He later played an inmate on HBO's Oz, had a guest-starring role as a gay bird-watcher on Will & Grace and nabbed a starring role as Linc Stark in John From Cincinnati. His second big break came in 2017, however, when he was introduced as Fred Andrews, a main castmember in the CW smash Riverdale, before his March 2019 passing.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nIan Ziering\n\nThe actor played immature ladies’ man Steve Sanders, who grappled with issues over being adopted, for the entire length of the show, which ran from 1990 to 2000. Like Garth and Doherty, he had a stint on Dancing With the Stars in 2007. He has starred on several reality shows since the teen drama ended, including The Apprentice (2015) and Worst Cooks in America (2018), as well as several Sharknado movies.\n\nThe New Jersey native is the father of daughters Mia and Penna, whom he shares with ex-wife Erin Ludwig. The duo split in October 2019 after nine years of marriage. Us confirmed in October 2022 that they had agreed to a divorce settlement.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nGabrielle Carteris\n\nThe actress played neurotic, overachieving school newspaper editor Andrea Zuckerman, who was hopelessly in love with Brandon Walsh, from 1990 to 1995. After leaving the series in 1995 to host a short-lived talk show, Carteris did a stint on VH1's Surreal Life. The actress was partially paralyzed for months after a debilitating injury filming the Lifetime movie Past Tense in 2006, but has since recovered, going on to bag recurring roles in shows such as My Alibi (2008) and Code Black (2015). The former president of SAG-AFTRA trade union also appeared on the Fox 90210 reboot in 2019. Three years later, Carteris made her way back to TV and appeared on the mini series We Own This City.\n\nShe has been married to Charles Isaacs since 1992, and has two daughters, Kelsey and Molly.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nTiffani Thiessen\n\nThe Saved by the Bell alum played bad girl Valerie Malone from 1994 to 2000. At the time, she was dating costar Green. From 2015 to 2017, she served as the star and executive producer of her own Cooking Channel series, Dinner at Tiffani’s, and she currently shares her recipes with fans on her personal blog. Thiessen portrayed Lori Mendoza on Netflix’s Alexa & Katie from 2018 to 2020, who had a far more wholesome image than her original 90210 character. Much to the delight of fans, the actress reprised her role as Kelly Kapowski on the Saved by the Bell reboot in the first two seasons.\n\nShe is married to actor/artist Brady Smith, with whom she shares daughter Harper and son Holt.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy, who now goes by Christine Elise, portrayed troubled teen Emily Valentine, who famously played Dylan and Brandon for fools while dating them both at the same time, though she ultimately chose Brandon. Emily was institutionalized after destroying a homecoming float with fire on the show. She also dated Priestley off screen for five years from 1992 to 1997, according to his 2014 book, Jason Priestley: A Memoir. The actress has credits on E.R. and several horror productions including Body Snatchers and the 2021 Chucky series."
