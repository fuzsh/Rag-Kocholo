In spite of failing vision, Iâve continued with volunteer work at the local senior center and the public library. I was honored to be chosen library volunteer of the year for Los Angeles County back in 2006. I canât drive anymore (bummer), but my legs still work so I can walk to many of the places where I need to go. One of my three sons still lives in the vicinity (Long Beach). I have four grandchildren all living far away, so I have to travel to spoil them. My two brothers are still in Rochester, and I see them and their families about every two years and look around the U of R campus to see all the changes. Iâm still enjoying life and hope you are too.â\n\n1957\n\nKay Hatton Ryder has been appointed to the Universityâs Lifelong Learning Advisory Council.
