        "text": "Virginia Robinson Gardens\n\nVirginia Robinson of the Robinson’s Department stores, whose family built this estate in 1911, was known as the \"First Lady of Beverly Hills.\" She was famous for her legendary card games and extravagant parties, which were frequented by celebrities like Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin and Lillian Disney.

The home's facade was inspired by the surreal designs of famous architect, Antoni Gaudi. This house is just steps from the Golden Triangle. Be sure to walk or drive down the alley that runs along the house's left side as the swirling exterior can be seen even better from the back.\n\nThe Witch's House, also known as the Spadena House, appears to be plucked straight out of a fairytale. The house was built in 1921 for a silent film movie studio, Willat Studios in Culver City, to serve as its offices and dressing rooms. When the studio closed, the Spadena family moved the home to its current location in Beverly Hills, where it has been since 1934. Thanks to the pointy, lopsided roof, tiny windows and stucco with a distressed paint technique, the home has been described as the quintessential Hansel and Gretel house.\n\nThe Witch’s House was featured in our Beverly Hills Duets video episode, Motorcars & Manors. Watch now.\n\nO'Neill House, 507 North Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210\n\nThe Witch's House, 516 North Walden Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210\n\nBoth homes are private residences.

Mr. Brainwash's installations remix iconic and multi-medium works that draw viewers into his unique worldview with a mash-up of historical and pop iconography referencing artists from all over the world.\n\nThe museum is open Friday through Sunday from 1 p.m. – 6 p.m. Tickets are required to enter the museum and can be purchased online.\n\nMr. Brainwash Art Museum, 465 North Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210\n\nGreystone Mansion & Gardens: The Doheny Estate\n\nBuilt in 1928 for the son of a prominent oil baron, the majestic Greystone Mansion today is surrounded by 18.5 pastoral acres of lush, city-owned parkland.\n\nGreystone has had feature roles in dozens of famous movies including The Big Lebowski, There Will Be Blood, Ghostbusters, Austin Powers: Goldmember and Spiderman.\n\nVisit Greystone Mansion and stroll through two public areas on the grounds-the beautifully maintained formal gardens with their centerpiece fountain, and the pool and inner courtyard area.
