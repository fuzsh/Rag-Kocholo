        "text": "Here, in all its glory, is Netflix‘s long list of movies premiering on the streamer in 2024, and there’s quite a few gems. While Netflix tries to program an event film each quarter, there’s clearly more star-studded pics than that as that’s what gets subscribers to click.\n\nOf note, dates have been announced for five features including the Eddie Murphy fourthquel Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (July 3), the animated Nickelodeon Latino title The Casagrandes Movie, (March 22), the cartoon movie Woody Woodpecker Goes to Camp (April 12), the Mark Waters-directed Brooke Shields and Miranda Cosgrove title Mother of the Bride (May 9), and the Mark Wahlberg and Halle Berry action title The Union (August 16).\n\nAlso on deck is Amblin’s first movie under its Netflix deal, the Taron Egerton TSA thriller Carry On, the Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz action movie Back in Action, franchise movies like Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon: Part Two the Scargiver, and plenty of Christmas movies.\n\nEven with Netflix film boss Scott Stuber exiting, expect business as usual in regards to theatrical distribution from the streamer. That means no exclusive wide run for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, ala Amazon and Apple’s pivot to theatrical. That said, limited exclusive runs of movies, sometimes ahead of their streaming dates, continues to be par for the course including for the upcoming Adam Sandler-Carey Mulligan drama Spaceman, which will be in select theaters on February 23 with an in-home drop date of March 1.\n\nBelow is the 2024 slate. Check out the 2024 Netflix TV series slate here.\n\nORION AND THE DARK (February 2)\n\nOrion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid –– shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, even falling off a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he’s the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grow closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown –– to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.\n\nDIRECTOR: Sean Charmatz\n\nWRITER: Charlie Kaufman\n\nPRODUCERS: Peter McCown\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Walt Dohrn and Bonnie Arnold\n\nSTUDIO: DreamWorks Animation\n\nVOICE CAST: Jacob Tremblay, Paul Walter Hauser, Angela Bassett, Colin Hanks, Natasia Demetriou, Golda Rosheuvel, Nat Faxon, Aparna Nancherla, Ike Barinholtz, Carla Gugino, Matt Dellapina, Nick Kishiyama, Mia Akemi Brown, Shannon Chan-Kent, Jack Fisher, Werner Herzog\n\nLOVER, STALKER, KILLER (February 9)\n\nDocumentary. Dave was recently out of a long-term relationship and eager to restart his romantic life, so he did what most people do: He tried online dating. Liz and Cari were two of his most promising connections, both single moms with winning personalities who helped bring him out of his shell in different ways. It should have been an opportunity for this hard-working, devoted dad to enjoy a second chance at casual romance, but it turned into a twisted love triangle, putting Dave and everyone he cared about at risk. Using interviews with those involved – including the law enforcement officers who cracked the case – alongside vivid reenactments that bring viewers into the tension and paranoia of Dave’s four year nightmare, this feature documentary from Curious Films (Running with the Devil) and director Sam Hobkinson (Fear City: New York vs The Mafia), deftly assembles the pieces of a mind-bending true tale of harassment, digital deception, and murder in America’s heartland.\n\nDIRECTOR: Sam Hobkinson\n\nPRODUCER: Sophie Clayton-Payne\n\nPLAYERS (February 14)\n\nNew York sportswriter Mack (Gina Rodriguez) has spent years devising successful hook-up “plays” with best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) and their crew. While it has led to countless one-night stands over the years, following their playbook comes with a strict set of ground rules — chief among them: you can’t build a relationship from a play. When Mack unexpectedly falls for her latest target, charming war correspondent Nick (Tom Ellis), she begins to rethink the game entirely. As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps. Also starring Joel Courtney, Augustus Prew, Liza Koshy, Ego Nwodim, and Marin Hinkle, PLAYERS is directed by Trish Sie from a screenplay by Whit Anderson and produced by Ross M. Dinerstein, Marc Platt, Adam Siegel, and Ryan Christians.\n\nDIRECTOR: Trish Sie\n\nWRITER: Whit Anderson\n\nPRODUCER: Ross M. Dinerstein, Marc Platt, Adam Siegel, Ryan Christians\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Ross Girard, Sophia Lin, Gina Rodriguez, Molly Breeskin\n\nCAST: Gina Rodriguez, Damon Wayans Jr., Joel Courtney, Augustus Prew, Liza Koshy, Ego Nwodim,\n\nMarin Hinkle and Tom Ellis\n\nEINSTEIN AND THE BOMB (February 16)\n\nIt’s 1933 and Albert Einstein the most famous scientist in the world is on the run. In fear of his life, he has no choice but to abandon his German homeland, as Hitler seizes power and begins the systematic persecution of the Jewish population. Einstein must find somewhere to hide from the very real threat of Nazi assassins. But where does a global celebrity disappear from view? The answer leads to a wooden hut in a field in Norfolk and the little known story of Einstein’s English hideaway. A time and place that will be a turning point in his life, between Europe and the US, between pacifism and aggression and a moment that will ultimately define his relationship with the most powerful of all inventions – the atom bomb. Using Einstein’s words only – his speeches, letters and interviews – to script his dialogue, this innovative docu-drama from BBC Studios (The Anthrax Attacks, the Emmy winning The Surgeon’s Cut) fuses dramatic sequences with archive footage of Einstein’s life as it unfolds across both world wars, the rise and fall of fascism, the advent of the atomic age. The result is a uniquely insightful and moving portrait of one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th Century and beyond.\n\nDIRECTOR: Anthony Philipson\n\nWRITER: Philip Ralph\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Andrew Cohen, James Van der pool\n\nTYLER PERRY’S MEA CULPA (February 23)\n\nWhen criminal defense attorney Mea Harper (Kelly Rowland) takes on the murder case of artist Zyair Malloy (Trevante Rhodes), the truth isn’t as obvious as it seems.
