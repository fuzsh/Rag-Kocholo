Usually Ringo meets with fans in whatever city he is in, a tradition that began July 7, 2008 when he convened with fans and friends on the streets in front of the Hard Rock Café in Chicago, passing out cupcakes and joining the crowd for “Peace and Love” exactly at Noon. In the ensuing years it has grown enormously and in 2019 there were over 30 Peace & Love events in countries all around the world.\n\n2020’s pandemic prevented an in-person event, and Ringo instead moved the celebration to be virtual, hosting “Ringo’s Big Birthday Show,” which featured unseen concert and unique performances by Starr, Paul McCartney, Joe Walsh, Ben Harper and Dave Grohl, Sheryl Crow, Gary Clark Jr and Sheila E. The show was broadcast globally via AXS, YouTube and Ceek and it benefitted Black Lives Matter Global Network, The David Lynch Foundation, Musicares and WaterAid. Meanwhile the #peaceandlove posts came from near and far, with the Mars Rover and The International Space Station being the first to wish Ringo a Happy Birthday “From 260 miles above our home planet, NASA Astronauts wish Ringo Starr a happy 80th birthday! Since our orbiting laboratory operates in Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT, it’s officially July 7 – a perfect date to send #PeaceAndLove to everyone across the universe!”\n\n2021 found Ringo celebrating with a few friends and family with a photo call at his Peace sculpture, with the world celebrating with their wave of peace and love celebrations globally.\n\nIn 2022, Ringo welcomed friends, family and the media to his Peace sculpture and over 30 Peace and Love regional events happened around the globe. In addition Ringo’s star song – the sound the stars made when he was born along with a recording of him saying “Peace & Love” – was beamed out into space and to the International Space Station (ISS) where it orbited around the Earth, passing over many countries and much of the Earth’s population beaming back down messages of peace and love while also traveling out to distant stars. In 2023, Ringo returned to the Peace sculpture to greet friends, family and the media while over 30 Peace and Love events kept the wave of peace and love traveling around the world. While NASA help spread the message to the universe and by beaming at Noon PST a pre-recorded message from Ringo from Barstow California based station in the Deep Space Network.\n\n2008 – Chicago, IL Hard Rock Cafe\n\n2009 – Online campaign including in store salutes at Noon at all Hard Rock Cafes worldwide\n\n2010 – New York City, NY: Hard Rock Cafe, Times Square\n\n2011 – Hamburg, Germany: Hard Rock Cafe\n\n2012 – Nashville, TN: Hard Rock Café\n\n2013 – Online celebration including a video message from Ringo\n\n2014 – Los Angeles, CA: Capitol Records Tower\n\n2015 – Los Angeles, CA: Capitol Records Tower\n\n2016 – Los Angeles, CA: Capitol Records Tower\n\n2017 – Los Angeles, CA: Capitol Records Tower\n\n2018 – Nice, France: Hard Rock Café\n\n2019 – Los Angeles, CA: Capitol Records Tower\n\n2020 – Los Angeles, CA: Virtual celebration, “Ringo’s Big Birthday Show”\n\n2021 – Los Angeles, CA: Beverly Hills Garden Park\n\n2022 – Los Angeles, CA: Beverly Hills Garden Park\n\n2023 – Los Angeles, CA: Beverly Hills Garden Park"
