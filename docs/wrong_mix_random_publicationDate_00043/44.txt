Welcome To The Beverly Hills Playhouse

The Beverly Hills Playhouse is one of LA’s oldest and most respected acting schools. For over forty years, we’ve offered ongoing scene-study classes to both professional and aspiring actors at all levels. Founded by the legendary Milton Katselas, and currently owned and run by Milton’s longtime student, director/playwright Allen Barton, the BHP is well known for delivering a unique and practical approach to addressing Acting, Attitude, and Career Administration.

Our Books

The BHP currently uses two primary books to supplement the work happening in class. First is Milton Katselas’ “Acting Class: Take A Seat,” which has been part of the program here for decades. Originally it was handed out as a three-ring binder that allowed Milton to add and delete articles as he chose. In 2008, Milton and Allen Barton re-worked the entire book from cover to cover for its first hard cover publication that fall. That version is still in use today.

In 2017, Allen wrote his own book, “The Oasis of Insanity.” Part 1 of that book a memoir of his apprenticeship with Milton over 18 years, in the form of various stories about what Milton was like and the goings on at BHP over those years. Part 2 is a collection of essays that originated as blog entries over 8 years, and then were edited, refined and grouped into topics covering Acting, Study, Career, and Life as an Actor.
