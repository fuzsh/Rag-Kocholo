British Indie Rock is a genre of alternative rock music that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. It is characterized by its use of guitar-driven melodies, often with a strong emphasis on melody and song structure. It typically features a combination of indie rock, post-punk, and new wave influences, and often incorporates elements of other genres such as folk, electronica, and hip hop. British Indie Rock bands often have a DIY aesthetic, and often focus on themes of youth culture, social alienation, and political and economic issues. Popular British Indie Rock bands include Arctic Monkeys, The Libertines, Blur, and The Smiths.
