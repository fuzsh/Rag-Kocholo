Indie Rock: Indie is slang for a type of guitar orientated music derived from 'punk'. Indie has generated it's own fashions as with most youth music. Originally an abb. of Independent, being a record label not affiliated to a major label such as Sony or EMI.

I have said this once and will say it again, Coldplay IS NOT INDIE!!!

I tend to group them with Britpop.. It's just convenient considering their from Britain and the quality of their songs puts them in that category. But Wikipedia/Answers.com call them "post-Britpop"

And well, they won grammies under the best "Alternative Music Album" back in 2003 for the 2002 Grammy Awards. So Alternative music? along with Radiohead, Bjork & Sigur Ros?
