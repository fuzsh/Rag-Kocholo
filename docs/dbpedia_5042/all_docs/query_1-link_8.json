        "text": "Or how britishness helped indie music to develop.\n\nAs I repeated throughout the weeks, indie music is not a unique conception of a type of music. There are many subgenres, branches and ways of conceptualising indie music and what it means. Today, I’m focusing on Britpop, a typically British alternative-rock type of music, that helped to set some features of what can be understood as indie music.\n\nWhat is Britpop?\n\nBritpop is a music genre that emerged in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s. It is characterized by catchy melodies, guitar-driven sounds, and lyrics that often reference British culture and identity.\n\nFour bands can help to understand what Britpop is : Blur, Oasis, Suede, Pulp.\n\nBritpop emerged in the mid-1990s as a reaction to the grunge and alternative rock scenes that dominated the music landscape in the early 1990s. Britpop bands often had a DIY approach to music-making and were associated with the indie music scene in the UK. Many Britpop bands, such as Oasis and Blur, started out as indie bands before achieving mainstream success.\n\nIn fact, some people argue that Britpop was a kind of subgenre of indie rock, as many Britpop bands shared the DIY vibe and independent spirit of the indie scene. Both indie music and Britpop celebrated a certain kind of authenticity and anti-commercialism, and both were influenced by the British music of the 1960s.\n\nWomen artists and britpop\n\nIf Britpop was dominated by those four man composed bands and by the “lad-culture”, it cannot just be reduced by this overly masculine environment. With artists like Elastica, Sleeper, Echobelly, Lush — that were singing feminist and anti-lad lyrics and maybe even Björk — even if she has her own music genre — women-led bands were also dominating the charts and were well-appreciated for their music.\n\nLad-culture was not the only aesthetic allowed by Britpop : it let more and more space to alternative culture, ungendered aesthetics and anti-misogynist anthems.\n\nInfluences and imagery of Britpop\n\nBritpop is a result of a lot of influences from 60s British pop music to the 80s indie pop but also by 70s punk-rock, British shoegaze. Even if it only lasted between 5 and 6 years, its impact was important notably thanks to the imagery that was used.\n\nThe main influences throughout the decades\n\nBritish music of the 1960s: Britpop bands were heavily influenced by the British music of the 1960s, particularly bands like The Beatles, The Kinks, and The Who. Many Britpop bands incorporated the catchy melodies and guitar-driven sounds of these bands into their music.\n\nPunk rock and new wave: Britpop was also influenced by the punk rock and new wave movements of the late 1970s and early 1980s. These movements were characterized by a DIY ethos and a rejection of and a rejection of mainstream culture, which resonated with Britpop's anti-commercialism and independent spirit.\n\nGlam rock: The flamboyant and theatrical style of glam rock, popularized by bands like David Bowie and Roxy Music in the 1970s, also influenced Britpop. Many Britpop bands adopted the glittery, androgynous fashion and stage personas of the glam rock era.\n\nManchester scene: The music scene in Manchester in the late 1980s and early 1990s was also a major influence on Britpop. Bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays blended elements of indie rock, dance music, and psychedelia and helped to pave the way for Britpop’s fusion of guitar-based rock and dance beats.\n\nImagery used and marketing interest\n\nBritpop was also associated with a wider cultural movement known as \"Cool Britannia,\" which celebrated all things British, including fashion, art, and film. This movement reflected a growing sense of British identity and pride in the wake of Margaret Thatcher’s conservative government and the decline of the British music industry in the 1980s. The imagery associated with Britpop was equally British and working class.\n\nEven if certain lyrics were kind of anti-commercialist, Britpop is now more seen as a marketing tool and a cultural moment than a real subgenre of indie music.\n\nBritpop was also fuelled by medias as “The Battle of Britpop” showed it. The media opposed Oasis and Blur, who released singles on the same day in 1995, competing for the top spot on the UK singles chart and continuing to fuel their rivalry until late 90s. Soon, radios and the music market was over-saturated by Britpop music.\n\nDecline\n\nHowever, because Britpop artists never reinvented themselves and because they didn’t adapt to the changes of the musical landscapes — electronic, hip-hop, melancholic music making their come back… — Britpop fell off people’s favor quickly. The golden age of Britpop only lasted about 5 or 6 years.\n\nFurthermore, the optimism and pride that coexisted with Britpop imagery crashed because of political and social reasons such as the wars in Kosovo and in Irak. Some also talk about the release of Radiohead’s album Ok Computer that was at the opposite of what Britpop was. The war against hard drugs also impacted Britpop artists that were really close to heroin, cocaine and others.\n\nYet, Britpop had such an influence on the music industry that lots of people said that it was only buried when Damon Albarn (from Blur) and Noel Gallagher (Oasis) collaborated in 2013. The Battle of Britpop was finally over (?).\n\nMy recommandation of the week would be the playlist published by Spotify : Britpop, Etc. It includes the main hits of this “golden era of 90s British indie”.\n\nSources used :\n\nBritpop page on Wikipedia\n\n“From Oasis to Elastica: The ultimate guide of Britpop in 20 bands” on Far Out by Philip Waines.\n\n“La Britpop: histoire d’une culture menée par Blur et Oasis” on Numero by Honorine Boudzoumou.\n\n“What killed Britpop? 12 Theories from RAdiohead to Tony Blair”, on NME by Emily Barker.\n\n“What happened to the female stars of Britpop”, on BBC by Fraser McAlpine.\n\nP."
