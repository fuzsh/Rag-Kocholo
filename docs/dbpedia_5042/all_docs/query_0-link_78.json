        "text": "Being the daughter of French music royalty (Charlotte's parents are none other than the late Serge Gainsbourg and British singer and actress Jane Birkin) is both a highly enviable and highly uncomfortable position. And Charlotte is the first to admit that whenever the subject of music comes up she automatically compares herself to her father. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that after recording her debut album at the age of fifteen (Charlotte for ever released in 1986), Ms. Gainsbourg chose to drop music and pursue an acting career instead.\n\nCharlotte, who made her screen debut in Claude Miller's coming-of-age classic L'EffrontÃ©e, triumphed at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year carrying off the Best Actress award for her performance in Lars von Trier's Antichrist. 2009 was also the year Charlotte returned to the recording studio and set to work on her third album, IRM. Interestingly enough, her last album 5:55 was produced by two committed Serge Gainsbourg fans: Nicolas Godin and Jean-BenoÃ®t Dunckel (Air.) And it turns out that Californian music maverick Beck, who manned the studio controls on IRM, also cites Charlotte's father as a formative influence.\n\nBeck, renowned for his whizzkid genius in the studio, started out with the rhythms on IRM and then grafted instruments, arrangements and Charlotte's whispery vocals on top. Charlotte herself participated in some of the sonic experimentation and the resulting album is an impressively protean work which meanders freely between folk, pop and electronica. Listeners are treated to everything from crazy percussion-playing (Master's Hands, Trick Pony) and a collage of Apollinaire poems (The Collector) to a Velvet Underground-influenced track entitled Me and Jane Doe (a reference to Vanessa Paradis' dog!)\n\nThe album's title track is a darker and more disturbing number featuring actual sounds from an IRM scan. (The track recalls Charlotte's personal hospital experience when she was operated on for a brain injury after a water ski accident in 2007.) Did the making of IRM have therapeutic benefits for the singer? Charlotte is not saying, simply stating that IRM is her \"most personal\" album to date."
