        "text": "due to the heavy influence of streaming and the way songs are promoted ie preorder single sales going towards album preorders. Rock and Indie struggle to go top 40. Indie rock fans dont play the same song ten times a day so will never been able to compete with the mainstream pop market anymore.\n\nThe loop hole that allowed preorder tracks to count for both the singles and album chart has been closed so no more David Bowie shock massive hits etc. IF half the tracks downloaded are preorders or grats the single will never chart.\n\nAlso there has been lots of successful bands this year in the album chart with top 3 album hits see Foals, Muse, Maccabees, Chvrches, Wolf Alice, Bring Me The Horizon,Mumford & Sons,New Order,Bullet For My Valentine,Florence, Vaccines, Blur ,All Time Low, Noel Gallagher ,Imagine Dragons, Fall Out Boy and many more.\n\nEven Biffy Clyro who will have a new album very soon will no longer have a top 40 hit single, you heard it hear first. If you like rock or indie forget the top 40 until their is a massive shift in taste.\n\n0\n\nBut we don't get loads of different bands heard. We get Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Ellie Goulding, Jess Glynne, Little Mix and Pharrell in a loop.\n\nI think that is the problem today, there is virtually no variation on any of the mainstream TV or radio stations, it is the same old thing every time.\n\nEven ...Later with Jools Holland, which should be covering all genres of music, simply ignores anything the producers don't like. It is about time it was scrapped and something more like The Old Grey Whistle Test was brought back, a programme that really did cover a broad spectrum of music.\n\n0\n\nSurprised nobody has mentioned Arctic Monkeys either.\n\nWhy do the charts even matter though, it doesn't bother me at all whether a band I like are in the charts or not, as long as they're making music and I can listen to it and see them live then that's all that matters.\n\nI can honestly say I never even glance at the charts, I couldn't tell you who is number one and I probably haven't heard of most of the acts in the charts. I still listen to loads of modern music though.\n\nPersonally I miss the time when we had a chart full of bands who wrote their own stuff, bands such as Queen, Depeche Mode, The Jam, Madness, The Police, The Cure, ELO, Blondie, Human League, OMD, XTC and loads more,\n\nBut why does it matter what's in the charts as long as there's plenty of good music about? I couldn't care less about the charts as long as there's lots of good bands to listen to, you just have to look a little bit harder to find them.\n\n0\n\nI think it's been summed up, there is little variation. The global release day and streaming has basically killed the singles chart and Beiber making it to #1 was the death knell. Record companies dictate the radio, TV and singles chart therefore any newcomer to \"break\" through has an uphill climb, add to that the stale singles chart or some of the mindless lemmings who buy a song because some t---t on X-Factor sang it.\n\nYou need a shift, and I think at the moment, we're too far gone to encourage a shift. The indie/rock acts have the album charts and having a #1 album carries a lot of prestige.\n\n0\n\nThe other big problem is it's the same handful of hitmakers getting (co)-writing credits over and over again - Martin, Tedder, Kurstin, Schuster, Nowels etc.\n\nI was thinking the same. In a way it's going right back to the early 20th Century when popular music was all about tin pan alley writers and publishers being in control. However, Rock n'Roll turned up and we thought that was all changed. It seems not.\n\nSurprised nobody has mentioned Arctic Monkeys either.\n\nBut why does it matter what's in the charts as long as there's plenty of good music about? I couldn't care less about the charts as long as there's lots of good bands to listen to, you just have to look a little bit harder to find them.\n\nI didn't mention the Arctic Monkeys because I didn't think they actually had a No 1 album in the time period mentioned but they are a great band.\n\nYes, there is a lots of good music around but it still needs some monitoring and curation by someone like John Peel to filter out the best stuff.\n\n0\n\nKilling Joke's 15th studio album, 'Pylon' entered the charts at Number 16 this week. The Band and us fans were pretty amazed at this.\n\nSaw them in Brighton last week, Gig was sold out, and they put on an awesome show.\n\nThere's great music out there, you just have to make an effort to find it these days.\n\nThe Charts were ruined by Cowell and his like. Bands like Killing Joke just don't sell anymore, but on occasion can put a dent into the mainstream.\n\nThe Live scene still has a healthy appetite for Bands though, as trying to get tickets for anyone I like is always a nightmare\n\n0"
