        "text": "Introduction\n\nSince emerging in the 1950s, rock has been the dominant form of popular music. It originated in the United States and spread to other English-speaking countries and across Europe in the 1960s. Eventually it became the sound track for young people throughout the world. The history of pop music into the 21st century has basically been that of rock and its variants, including disco, heavy metal, punk, and hip-hop.\n\nEarly Rock and Roll\n\nIn its early years rock was known as rock and roll (or rock ’n’ roll). This music was largely a mix of country music and rhythm and blues. Signifying rebellion and sexuality, rock and roll appealed to teenagers and often horrified their parents.\n\nBy the mid-1950s such performers as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Fats Domino, who had generally been considered rhythm and blues artists, were popular with white audiences as well as African Americans. Radio disc jockeys began calling their music rock and roll. Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti,” Berry’s “Maybellene,” Diddley’s “Bo Diddley,” and Domino’s “Ain’t That a Shame”—all early rock-and-roll hits—were released in 1955.\n\nIn 1954 record producer Sam Phillips, who had been searching for a “white man with the Negro sound and the Negro feel,” had begun recording the country singer Elvis Presley at Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee. Records such as “That’s All Right Mama” featured Presley’s high tenor voice singing with bluesy inflection. In 1956 the 21-year-old Presley created a sensation with his rock-and-roll-styled “Heartbreak Hotel,” the first of his 14 records in a row that sold more than a million copies each.\n\nPresley’s success inspired other country performers to sing rock and roll music in the late 1950s. They were called rockabilly singers, and the most prominent of them were the hiccupping vocalist Buddy Holly and the frenetic singer-pianist Jerry Lee Lewis. Other popular rockabilly stars included Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent. The popularity of Presley also helped to encourage the practice of “cover” recordings. That is, when new records by black performers appeared on the charts, white singers would record simplified versions of the same songs. The recordings by the white performers received wider distribution and were consequently played on more radio stations than the original recordings.\n\nAnother trend in rock and roll in the 1950s and ’60s was vocal groups called “doo-wops” because they sang nonsense syllables in many of their songs. Most of them featured bass singers who could sing extremely low notes and also singers who could sing tones in extremely high falsetto voice ranges. The Platters were one of the most popular of such vocal groups.\n\nFolk Rock\n\nThe growth of the civil rights and antiwar movements in the United States in the 1960s was accompanied by the popularity of such folksingers as Pete Seeger and the pure-voiced soprano Joan Baez. Other acts, such as Peter, Paul and Mary, created a bridge between traditional folk music and rock. The intersection of the folk tradition and rock came to be known as folk rock. The genre offered socially conscious rock music flavored by such traditional music as English and Celtic ballads and gospel songs. Popular folk-rock acts included the Mamas and the Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Byrds.\n\nThe pivotal artist in the fusion of folk and rock, and the one whose music reflected social changes most dramatically, was Bob Dylan. He began as a folksinger in the early 1960s and soon began writing songs urging peace (“A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall”) and equal rights for all Americans (“Blowin’ in the Wind”). In 1965 he began leading rock bands. His songs then became more personal and abstract, with complex, poetic lyrics unprecedented in popular music.\n\nSurf Rock\n\nAs surfing became popular in the United States in the early 1960s, a new genre of rock emerged to represent the West Coast lifestyle. Surf rock’s characteristic cascading electric-guitar playing was developed by surfer Dick Dale and his band the Del-Tones. The Beach Boys were the best-known act of the surf genre. Led by Brian Wilson, the band at first sang songs about surfing and “California Girls” in sweet barbershop quartet harmonies. By the mid-1960s they became interested in new recording-studio technologies such as overdubbing—a technique of recording engineering that made their five voices sound like many more—in complex harmonies such as those of “Good Vibrations.”\n\nThe British Invasion\n\nIn the 1950s rock and roll in Britain was predominantly imported from the United States. By the early 1960s, however, British youth weaned on American blues, rhythm and blues, and rock had developed a vital rock scene of their own. Soon rock swept across the Atlantic once again, this time from Britain to the United States in a movement called the British Invasion.\n\nThe defining band of the British Invasion was the Beatles. A quartet of musicians from Liverpool, England—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—the Beatles were already a phenomenon in Britain before arriving triumphantly in New York City in early 1964. They sang songs written mainly by Lennon and McCartney, whose infectious music and witty lyrics made them two of the finest 20th-century songwriters. Early Beatles songs were in standard forms (“She Loves You”). Their lyrics gradually became more subtle and tender (“Yesterday”) and sometimes abstract (“A Day in the Life”). Leading rock music experimenters, the Beatles often used overdubbing and other advanced record-production techniques to invent new musical effects. They disbanded in 1970.\n\nTwo other seminal bands of the era, the Rolling Stones and the Who, were counterpoints to the Beatles. In contrast to the Beatles’ respectability and charm, the Stones cultivated a rebellious image and played brash, often dark music to match. Successful recording artists, the Stones were also great concert performers, propelled by the energy of lead singer Mick Jagger and the intensity of guitarist Keith Richards. The Who shunned Beatlesque love songs in favor of aggressive songs of teenage angst. Their legendarily loud concerts ended with them smashing their instruments onstage. In 1969 the Who originated the rock opera with Tommy. Both the Rolling Stones and the Beatles proved to be among rock’s most durable bands, with members still performing more than four decades after their 1960s debuts.\n\nPsychedelic Rock\n\nThe hippie counterculture of the 1960s gave rise to a genre called psychedelic, or “acid,” rock. It featured song lyrics about psychedelic drugs and incorporated feedback and distortion, improvisation, and long instrumental solos.\n\nGuitarist Jimi Hendrix, the gravel-voiced singer Janis Joplin, the Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, and the Grateful Dead were the most prominent of psychedelic rock performers. Hendrix created masterly solos using extremely loud volumes and creative sound effects. He ended his shows by setting fire to his guitar. Joplin and Hendrix died of drug overdoses within a month of each other in 1970, both at age 27. The gifted lead singer of the Doors, Jim Morrison, died a year later at the same young age. Despite the short lives of most psychedelic bands (the Grateful Dead being a notable exception), the genre had a huge impact on rock music, greatly influencing such offshoots as heavy metal, progressive and art rock, funk, punk, and electronic music.\n\nProgressive Rock\n\nOften pulling elements from classical music and jazz, progressive rock took an iconoclastic approach to rock’s traditional forms. The antecedents of progressive rock (sometimes called art rock) were psychedelic rock and the musical experimentation of such bands as the Beatles (circa Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) and Frank Zappa. Common in progressive rock were extremely long songs and the “concept album,” or an album whose songs are linked by a common theme or story line; the use of electronic instruments, especially synthesizer; complex melodies and harmonies; and frequently changing or unusual time signatures and rhythms.\n\nThe prototypical progressive rock bands include Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, and Genesis, all of which formed in Britain in the late 1960s. Notably, Genesis launched the successful solo careers of lead singer Peter Gabriel and drummer Phil Collins.\n\nSinger-Songwriters\n\nFrom folk rock and the far-reaching influence of Bob Dylan grew the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s. Preeminent singer-songwriters included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Randy Newman, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Cat Stevens, Carole King, and Jackson Browne. Their music, while highly individualized, shared introspective, poetic, and often autobiographical lyrics sung in idiosyncratic voices.\n\nAmong the most successful artists to emerge from the singer-songwriter tradition was Bruce Springsteen. He began his career in the early 1970s, playing in East Coast cities and building a reputation as a charismatic stage performer. Pairing a rough-edged baritone voice with a classic rock sound, his most characteristic songs were insightful, sensitive portraits of working people. Springsteen continued recording and touring into the 2000s, sometimes with his E Street Band and sometimes with other musicians or as a solo artist.\n\nDisco\n\nDiscotheques, or nightclubs offering recorded rock music for dancing, first appeared in the 1960s. In the 1970s long rock songs, usually played at fast tempos and with skipping rhythms, became known as disco music. Disco was strongly influenced by upbeat Motown songs, the syncopated rhythms of funk, and the sweet melodies of pop soul. Popular disco stars included Gloria Gaynor and Donna Summer. Disco music was featured in the movie Saturday Night Fever, and an album of music from the film, performed by the Bee Gees, became the most popular record of the 1970s. Although disco came under harsh criticism for its commerciality, the genre can be credited as the precursor to such later dance music styles as house and techno.\n\nMadonna, one of the most successful pop stars of all time, began her career in the early 1980s with disco-inspired dance hits such as “Holiday.” She had a keen eye and ear for translating trends from the underground club culture into pop songs. A former dancer herself, Madonna never strayed far from her roots in dance and club music. Her 1998 album Ray of Light brought techno music into the mainstream.\n\nGlam Rock\n\nA musical movement that began in Britain in the early 1970s, glam rock (also called glitter rock) brought over-the-top spectacle to the rock arena. The preeminent glam rocker was David Bowie. With the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Bowie introduced the first of his several theatrical personae, Ziggy Stardust, a fey-looking alien rock star. Musically, the album was quintessential glam, combining aggressive guitar-oriented hard rock, foreboding lyrics, and catchy, pop-influenced choruses. Other British performers associated with glam rock included Queen, Roxy Music, and Elton John, who combined glam rock’s showmanship with diverse pop musical styles. In the United States glam rock engendered such diverse musical acts as Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground, the early punk band the New York Dolls, and the hard-rocking and heavily made-up Kiss.\n\nPunk Rock\n\nPunk, which exploded on the American and British music scenes in the 1970s, was stripped-down hard-rock music paired with hostile lyrics typically condemning the consumerism of modern urban society. Punk also made a radical fashion statement—torn clothes, leather jackets, and garishly dyed hair, with razor blades and safety pins for decoration—to embody teen rebellion and alienation.\n\nPunk found much to condemn in the British ruling class, and the British group the Sex Pistols, featuring Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious, was the definitive punk band, offering such classic anthems as “Anarchy in the U.K.” Another notable British punk band was the Clash. Bands that defined the American punk scene included Iggy and the Stooges, the Ramones, and the Patti Smith Group. Punk was largely eclipsed by disco in the late 1970s, but its spirit survived into the 1980s, albeit mostly underground, with the postpunk offshoots hardcore and new wave. The British band Joy Division, which later became New Order, was a notable success of the late punk era.\n\nHeavy Metal\n\nThe antecedents of heavy metal’s signature drums, bass, and distorted electric guitar were the blues-based rock of mid-1960s British bands, the guitar virtuosity of Jimi Hendrix, and the stage shows of glam rock. The early 1970s pioneers of the genre included Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath. Throughout the ’70s metal bands such as Kiss, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Alice Cooper gained an international following mainly through extensive touring.\n\nA new wave of British metal acts, including Def Leppard and Iron Maiden, along with the innovative guitar playing of Eddie Van Halen, revived the genre in the 1980s. Heavy metal achieved its greatest mainstream success in that decade with such pop-oriented bands as Mötley Crüe, Poison, Bon Jovi, and Guns N’ Roses. In opposition to their commercialism, harder styles of metal arose, some of which flourished underground. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer were among the bands that pioneered thrash metal, characterized by a fast tempo and aggressive lyrics.\n\nNew Wave\n\nTaking its name from the French New Wave cinema of the 1950s, the new wave genre of popular music arose in the late 1970s. It fused an arty sensibility with the do-it-yourself principle of punk to produce catchy and often subversively humorous music.\n\nA diverse category, new wave encompassed such American artists as the B-52s, Blondie, the Go-Go’s, and the Cars. New wave innovators included Devo and Talking Heads, both composed of former art students. Among British new-wave acts were the clever singer-songwriters Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe; Squeeze and XTC, whose songs were sophisticated and infectious; and the so-called New Romantics, including Duran Duran and Adam and the Ants. By the mid-1980s the distinction between new wave and mainstream “corporate” rock was blurred, especially for such commercially successful bands as the Pretenders, the Police, and U2. New wave’s impact on pop music continued through the 1990s.\n\nAlternative and Indie Rock\n\nBy the mid-1980s rock, then three decades old, had evolved from its controversial origins into a well-established part of popular culture. No longer an expression of youthful rebellion, rock had become mainstream music predominantly for adults. In reaction against conventional rock, some independent-minded bands of the 1980s and 1990s sought to stretch the rock tradition to create something newly personal. Their music was labeled alternative rock. R.E.M., the quintessential college-radio stars of the 1980s, was the most successful of early alternative rock bands.\n\nThe breakthrough moment for alternative rock was the 1991 release of the single “Smells Like Teen Spirit” by the band Nirvana. Inspired by the aggression of punk and heavy metal, the music of Nirvana featured distorted guitars and ravaged vocals expressing alienation, anger, and despair. With the success of local bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam, Seattle, Washington, became ground zero for a new musical style called grunge. While the popularity of grunge faded in the mid-1990s, its lasting influence was bringing alternative rock to the mainstream audience.\n\nAnother term that came to be applied to alternative rock bands was indie rock. “Indie” was short for “independent,” referring to the fact that many of the bands released their music through independent record labels rather than the major labels. Eventually “indie” came to identify the genre more than the method of distribution. In the 21st century indie rock remained a sort of catch-all term for idiosyncratic artists working outside of the mainstream.\n\nThe Ongoing Evolution of Rock\n\nThis overview of the music’s evolution over the decades shows how rock became the most inclusive of musical labels. It encompassed a broad range of sounds and styles, many of which bore little resemblance to the original rock and roll of the 1950s. The defining quality that unified these diverse sounds under the label of rock was authenticity. Rock was distinguished from pop music in that the main motivation of its makers was not commercial sales but rather the authentic expression of the songwriter’s or performer’s feelings or worldview. Rock, then, was defined more by an attitude than by any particular sound.\n\nWith authenticity as the leading criterion, rock in the 21st century continued to embrace a great variety of artists. One measure of this diversity was the lineups at rock festivals staged throughout the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world. There hip-hop stars such as Jay-Z and Kanye West played headlining sets alongside electronic/dance performers such as LCD Soundsystem and Daft Punk, art rock bands such as Radiohead and Arcade Fire, and “classic rock” acts such as Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney."
