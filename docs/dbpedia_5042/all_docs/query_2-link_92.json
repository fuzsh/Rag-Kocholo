        "text": "From 60s and 70s classics to Britpop and modern Indie\n\nMany of these bands owe a lot to guitar groups from the 60s and beyond, and our indie rock function bands' setlists do include a few nods to the Kinks, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and other musical heroes. Having gone down a storm at festivals all over the UK and as corporate entertainment for prominent brands, our indie bands have cut their gigging teeth and are itching to show you what they've got!\n\nUpbeat, Fun and Ready to Rock 'n' Roll!\n\nThe indie our indie wedding bands cover is typically upbeat and has a sizeable sing-along factor, featuring frantically strummed guitar, funky bass lines, danceable drumbeats and the odd keyboard for colour. Indie fashion borders the extremes of smart and casual, so our indie bands won't look out of place at wedding functions, corporate events, awards ceremonies, festivals, graduations and charity events or at birthdays, work outings, office parties or garden parties. And, since indie sits comfortably between pop, punk, rock and dance music, it's a genre that'll appeal to all tastes.\n\nWhatever the size of your venue, whatever the extent of your budget, and whatever the style of your event might be, we at Bands for Hire will help you deduce which of our fantastic indie bands will fit the remit. We have larger bands featuring 5 or 6 members if you want the sound to be filled out, and we also have acoustic duos or even solo performers if you had something more chilled out in mind. You'll still get that youthful, vibrant energy and trendy haircuts, however many members you decide to hire!\n\nIndie DJ Sets and Wedding Packages"
