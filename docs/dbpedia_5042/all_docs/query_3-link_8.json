You should refer to this list when answering the Section B stylistic question of the AS music technology listening and analysing exam (Unit 2 Music Tech Resources).\n\nInstrumentation:\n\nVocals (usually male)\n\nBacking Vocals\n\nTwo guitarists – Lead and Rhythm\n\nKeyboards\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nPerformance and Arrangement:\n\nGuitar as the main harmonic instrument\n\nGuitar sounds commonly associated with indie are often referred to as jangly – a fairly light tone, often picked, sustained arpeggios with effects\n\nVocals are often fairly understated, with a melancholy or introspective feel\n\nBacking vocals are not usually a big feature, so the music tends to be relatively sparse\n\nSome songs are long and loosely structured, almost like extended jams around a groove\n\nSolos do not form a very important part of the music\n\nTechnology and Production:\n\nGuitar amplifiers and effects play a big part in the sound of Indie music – The light, sustained tone and use of delays is common in many bands\n\nDIY production ethic, low budget recordings based on simple capture of live performances.\n\nInfluences:\n\nUK Rock (The Beatles, The Who, The Kinks)\n\nVelvet Underground and Psychedelic Rock\n\nPunk Rock\n\nFunk\n\nHouse"
