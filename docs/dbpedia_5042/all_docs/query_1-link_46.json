Indie music can be seen as a form of artistic expression that values creativity, originality, and authenticity over commercial success.\n\nIn this guide, we will explore:\n\nThe Meaning and Origins of indie music\n\nSome of the most influential and popular indie artists and genres in history\n\nSome examples of indie songs that you can listen to and enjoy\n\nThe Impact of indie music on the World of Music and Culture\n\nWhat is Indie Music?\n\nThe word “indie” is short for “independent”, which implies a degree of autonomy and freedom from the control of major record labels and corporations. Indie music is music that is created by artists who operate outside of the mainstream music industry, either by choice or by necessity. Indie artists typically have more control over their creative process, artistic vision, and distribution channels than artists who are signed to major labels.\n\nIndie music is not a genre in itself, but rather an umbrella term that encompasses many different genres and subgenres of music that have emerged from the independent music scene.\n\nSome of these genres include:\n\nIndie rock\n\nIndie pop\n\nIndie folk\n\nIndie electronic\n\nIndie hip hop\n\nAnd many more\n\nIndie music can also be influenced by various musical traditions and cultures from around the world, such as indie Latin, indie African, indie Asian, and so on.\n\nIndie music can be characterized by a number of features, such as:\n\nA DIY (do-it-yourself) approach to recording, producing, and distributing music, often using low-budget or homemade equipment and methods.\n\nA preference for experimentation, innovation, and diversity over conformity, standardization, and repetition.\n\nA rejection of mainstream trends, conventions, and expectations in favor of personal expression, identity, and authenticity.\n\nA sense of community and collaboration among indie artists and fans who support each other through word-of-mouth, social media, blogs, zines, festivals, and other platforms.\n\nA resistance to commercialization, corporatization, and commodification of music and culture.\n\nHistory of Indie Music\n\nThe origins of indie music can be traced back to as early as the 1920s when independent record labels emerged to challenge the dominance of the major labels in the music industry. These independent labels offered more opportunities for artists who were marginalized or excluded by the mainstream market, such as jazz musicians, blues musicians, folk musicians, rockabilly musicians, soul musicians, punk musicians, and many others.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, some British producers and artists launched their own independent labels as outlets for their work and artists they liked. Some examples are Joe Meek’s Triumph Records, Tony Hatch’s Pye Records, Andrew Loog Oldham’s Immediate Records, George Martin’s AIR Studios, and Richard Branson’s Virgin Records. These labels helped to foster the development of genres such as skiffle, beat, mod, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, glam rock, folk rock, and more.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of punk rock and new wave sparked a new wave of independent labels and movements that challenged the status quo of the music industry. Some examples are Malcolm McLaren’s Sex Pistols’ label Glitterbest Records, Rough Trade Records, Factory Records, Stiff Records, Mute Records, 4AD Records, Sub Pop Records, SST Records, Dischord Records, Alternative Tentacles Records, Def Jam Records, Tommy Boy Records, Sugar Hill Records, ZTT Records, Warp Records, Creation Records, Sarah Records, Matador Records, Merge Records, Domino Recording Company, XL Recordings, Ninja Tune, etc. These labels helped to popularize genres such as post-punk, hardcore, synth-pop, electro, hip-hop, house, techno, and more.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the indie music scene continued to grow and diversify, as new technologies such as the internet, digital recording, and software synthesizers enabled more artists to create and distribute their music independently. Indie music also became more mainstream, as some indie artists achieved commercial success and recognition, such as Nirvana, Radiohead, Arcade Fire, The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, Lana Del Rey, Lorde, and many others.\n\nExamples of Indie Music\n\nIndie music is a diverse and eclectic field that encompasses many different artists and genres.
