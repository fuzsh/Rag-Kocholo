        "text": "In this blog post, we give you 15 alternative indie music artists that are worth checking out. Keep reading to see our full list.\n\nAlternative indie music covers a genre of music that combines elements of alternative rock and indie rock. It typically features more experimental, unique soundtracks than mainstream alternative rock, and is often considered to be more authentic and artful than commercial pop music.\n\nSome popular alternative indie rock bands include Arcade Fire, Modest Mouse, and Vampire Weekend. While the genre is not easily defined, alternative indie rock typically has a quirkier, off-kilter sound that sets it apart from other types of music. If you're looking for something a little different, then alternative indie rock might be the perfect genre for you.\n\nOne could argue that the very term \"indie rock\" or \"alternative indie music\" is something of a misnomer since the vast majority of popular independent rock bands are now signed to major labels. Nevertheless, there are still several unsigned bands that are worth checking out.\n\nSo if you're looking for something a little different from the mainstream, be sure to check out our SharePro: Indie Musician Community with thousands of alternative indie music and much more in the indie music scene.\n\nTake a look and a listen to our picks for Alternative Indie Music\n\n1.
