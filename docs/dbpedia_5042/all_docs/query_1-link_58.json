        "text": "By: Ally Allen\n\n1965: The Velvet Underground record their first demos. In 1967, they release their first album ‘The Velvet Underground & Nico’ which, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, shapes the future of rock and indie music alike. 1\n\n1976: Nick Lowe’s record “So It Goes” is released by the indie record label Stiff, making it the first UK punk single. According to Stiff Records, their label is “the maverick indie” and served as a guide for the various indie record companies that followed.2\n\n1981: Depeche Mode is formed. They are known for their “synthpop” aesthetic and by the end of the 80’s began selling out stadium across the globe. They continue to tour today and sold out London’s O2 arena in 2008 in less than an hour.3\n\n1986: New Musical Express, or NME, releases cassette gathering popular indie music artists called C86. This compilation, according to NME, defined the indie-pop sound of the 80s.4\n\n1988: Sub Pop Records is created. The label adopted Nirvana, a grunge band consisting of Kurt Cobain, David Grohl, and Krist Novoselic.5\n\n1989: XL Recordings is formed. The label has developed into an indie powerhouse with acts, such as Vampire Weekend. The label is highly selective as well and typically signs one artist every year.6\n\n1991: Nirvana’s second record, ‘Nevermind,’ is released, and has sold at least 31 million copies, proving that indie bands do have a place on the charts.7\n\n2006: Domino Records releases the Artic Monkey’s debut album “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not,” selling 363,735 copies during the first week of release. The band went on to win the 2006 Nationwide Mercury Prize8, which recognizes the album of the year for British and Irish bands and singers.\n\n2012: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a 71% increase in indie musicians since 2003.9\n\n2013: Vinyl record sales witness a 33% growth in sales, selling six million copies in 2013. This statistic is closely related to the growth of indie music as many artists release music on both CD and vinyl. 10"
