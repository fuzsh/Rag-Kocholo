        "text": "Wet Leg feels like a band that would have absolutely dominated that teen blog/ tumblr period of 2007-2012.\n\nMaybe it’s because I was at the peak of my awkward teen powers in that period, but having listened through the self-titled debut album from The Isle of Wight act a couple of times now, their sound has thrown me back more than a decade to a time where trying to being cool and unique in an online space was a lot more time consuming than it should have been (please keep in mind I wasn’t allowed social media or anything of the like while at school, so this is all purely anecdotal from friends who did).\n\nWith a sound wedged in that mysterious and chaotic vibe somewhere between Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Le Tigre, Gossip and Metric, there’s been an incredible buzz surrounding the English group for the past 12 months that could (and honestly probably will) transcend and connect to generations past, present and future.\n\nAfter bursting out with the inescapable “Chaise Longue” in the middle of 2021, Wet Leg has continued to release a flurry of catchy, hook laden and slightly sardonic hits over the past six months or so, all of which have managed to make it onto their debut.\n\nWhile it makes sense to lead into your debut album having released a couple of songs, Wet Leg has gone one step further and by the time of release, they have already released half of the songs on the album.\n\nSome may interpret this as showing their cards too early. I’m here to say, yes they have shown their cards, but luckily for the band, it’s just about a royal flush.\n\nContinue reading review by Dylan Marshall on The AU Review\n\nThey may sound like one of those shit southern dad rock bands, but don’t let the name Black Country, New Road put you off as this young English chamber rock ensemble are changing the landscape of contemporary rock and alternative music.\n\nEqual parts King Crimson, Godspeed, Arcade Fire, Black Midi and something else entirely, BC, NR seemingly came out of nowhere on the promise of a couple of wild and lengthy singles at the start of this decade.\n\nSigning to legendary electronic-leaning UK label Ninja Tune, their 2021 debut album For The First Time was a surprise storm; an unhinged whirlwind of chaos, noise, post-rock, math rock, seething violins, dreamlike woodwind, manic brass and the bizarre stream-of-consciousness ranting and raving of vocalist and lyricist Isaac Wood taking the centre stage.\n\nIn just forty short minutes, BC, NR’s debut album blew me apart listen after listen and left me wanting so much more each time. Ants From Up There leaves me feeling full and then some, running at just shy of an hour. The septet have knuckled down and expanded their vision so perfectly, using that extra running time to expand the sonic space, their dynamic structures and control their chaos, resulting in a record that is brighter, bolder and more complete.\n\nAnts From Up There by Black Country, New Road\n\nListening back to their debut after many listens of this follow up, I can see clearer now that some of the tracks on that album were more sporadic and loosely tied together. Though not a bad thing, the three act nine minute anthem ‘Sunglasses’ traversed through more clever ideas than one song could handle, and there isn’t really a song quite as loose and free-form as this here, as exhilarating as that song is.\n\nIf For The First Time was a suffering artist blurting out to their therapist their most dangerous thoughts and darkest secrets, then Ants From Up There is a calm; an acceptance; the sound of a troubled soul working through their hardships. This sentiment could apply to the septet as a whole, or even the idiosyncratic, enigmatic voice that is Isaac Wood.\n\nContinue reading on AudioTrail blog\n\nNew indie rock music videos are dropping left and right in past weeks, so we’re doing our best to keep up with reviewing and posting the best indie music videos of 2022 – one volume of 5 each at a time. Please share, like or follow to tell us you dig this series so we are inspired.\n\nJust for clarification: ‘best indie music videos’ refers more to our feeling about the song itself and not the video by itself. The use of ‘video’, and the YouTube embed, helps separate posts with just audio, and those with audio AND video.\n\nIn this case, brothers and sisters, the video can be animation, lyric, or a real ‘real’ music video (if that makes sense?).\n\nWe do not post YouTube video singles that include mash-ups of stock footage and public domain media.\n\n(YouTube/Google has a pretty strong hold on the music videos marketplace. The only viable competition – Vemo – is now owned by guess who? Google. Does this space allow fair competition? Doesn’t look like it – does it? Every time Google stock-owners go to the bank they say “GOO_GOO_GA_GA” when they see how much money – on paper – they are making. Remember – money either enhances or corrupts.)\n\nIn This Installment:\n\nBeach House – “Sunset” from Once Twice Melody (Feb. 18th)\n\nPUP – “Robot Writes a Love Song” from The Unraveling of Pup, The Band (April 1st)\n\nMJ Lenderman – “The Hangover Game” from Boat Songs (April 29th)\n\nBaby Strange – “Under The Surface” from Land of Nothing (April 20th)\n\nHater – “Something New” from Sincere (May 5th)\n\nIt’s no secret to our readers/followers that we have been big Beach House supporters from the get-go (more than 15 years by now – wow) after listening to the duo’s 2006 self-title debut album, featuring still-amazing tracks like the mega-loved “Master of None” to “Saltwater”, and others like the spooky “Tokyo Witch”, over and over again.\n\nNow we are fortunate to have a track and video from the duo’s upcoming new release Once Twice Melody set to drop February 18th via Sub Pop Records.\n\nVictoria Legrand‘s soothy, mysterious vocals and Alex Scally‘s dreamy, moody instrumentations on “Sunset” and many other tracks have never run dry or become ho-hum over the years.\n\nBeing overly analytical in cases like this can be a big fault: so, at the end of the day, all we can say about Beach House is they’re on our forever favorite indie duos of all time list.\n\nToronto punk quartet PUP are set to drop their foruth album, The Unraveling of Pup, The Band on April 1st via Little Dipper/Rise Records.\n\nThe video/audio track “Robot Writes A Love Song” shifts from melodic guitar-rock into an anthemic synth and drum machine-driven groove.\n\nThe band’s statement hints at something different coming up: “[It is] not just the next PUP record, but the most PUP record.”\n\nPUP members recorded and mixed the tracks last summer at Grammy-winning producer Peter Katis’ (Interpol, Kurt Vile, The National) Connecticut mansion.\n\nNew instruments like piano, synths and horns are used for the first time on a PUP album and includes contributions remotely from the following artists: Sarah Tudzin (Illuminati Hotties), Kathryn McCauhey (NOBRO), Mel St-Pierre (Casper Skulls) and Erik Paulson (Remo Drive).\n\nAsheville, North Carolina ndie rocker and former Wednesday band member Jake Lenderman, who records as MJ Lenderman, returns with a new track about Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals. The song, “Hangover Game,” is off of his forthcoming album Boat Songs.\n\nWith combating guitars and a remarkable cresecendo, the track unravels a story that Michael Jordan’s infamous 1997 illness was not food poisoning, but instead a ‘bad hangover.’\n\nLenderman turns the song into a silly two minutes of poetic alt-country bliss. Boat Songs drops official April 29th via Dear Life Records.\n\nScottish rockers Baby Strange released their new video single “Under The Surface”.\n\nThe video is wonderfully creative and memorable – an accomplishment these days, especially on what we assume was a limited budget. Overall it’s a clever artistic concept that doesn’t need to be flashy or elaborate to be effective. Of course it helps that the song itself is a kick-ass rocker.\n\nAnother single, “Midnight,” released on New Years Eve – was the first teaser from the band’s upcoming second album, Land of Nothing, due April 20th via Icons Creating Evil Art.\n\nIt’s a powerful song for me, writing it was a total release”\n\nVocalist and guitarist Johnny Madden explains: “’Under The Surface’ is a song about feeling trapped and wanting to find a way out of whatever is holding you back. It’s about paranoia, dark thoughts and the need to get over them. It’s a powerful song for me, writing it was a total release and when we finished it in the studio I felt a weight was lifted from my shoulders.”\n\nFrontview Magazine : “There is an underlying rawness to the energy sewn deep into the fabric of Glasgow that Baby Strange have harnessed with an unrelenting force.”\n\nSwedish band Hater has dropped the first single, “Something” from their new album Sincere.\n\nIt’s the indie quartet’s follow-up to 2018’s Siesta, “Something” is a hypnotizing mix of shoegaze guitars, Caroline Landahl‘s wonderfully diverse vocals and soft, offset drum beats.\n\nThis newest peek-view at the upcoming release of Sincere on May 6th via Fire Records."
