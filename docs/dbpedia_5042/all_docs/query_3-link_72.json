I identify here two subgenres of indie and electronic music scenes and analyze how the handful of musicians that comprise these burgeoning movements are fighting to keep their respective national cultural traditions alive in the face of iTunes, mp3s, and P2P filesharing that have universalized a certain form of pop music which cuts across languages and cultures. The hybrid musicians I interviewed for this project combine flamenco or fado with a variety of indie sounds: rock, pop, power pop, hip hop, trip hop, post punk, spaghetti western, shoegaze, or experimental electronic. The end result is a musical production which simultaneously attempts to voice their nationality as well as their generation. They are the torchbearers of tradition for an Iberian generation raised on The Velvet Underground, David Bowie, The Clash, The Replacements, Nirvana, and The Strokes. Their music references these and other global indie bands alongside those of twentieth century Iberian urban folk icons--Bambino, Camarón de la Isla, Enrique Morente, Amália Rodrigues, Alfredo Marceneiro, and Carlos do Carmo. I have developed a framework with which to contextualize and conceptualize the various issues addressed by these bands: authenticity, globalization, nostalgia, cultural capital, national-gender identity, and the economic crisis plaguing contemporary Europe.\n\nThis chapter arose from a research project (Cheung, 2010) reporting on a linguistic study of song lyrics by Hong Kong musicians who composed in English.

The study aimed to reveal the use of metaphor, both as a rhetorical technique and a linguistic phenomenon, in a small lyric database I compiled. The motivation of the project was both a linguistic and an educational one, in that the awareness of metaphor may improve language learners' reading comprehension and capacity to produce creative writing (e.g. Cardoso, 2005 ; Hashemian & Nezhad, 2007). Th at said, the original study did not address the broader topic of how the musicians, many of whom have English as a second language (ESL), position themselves in what Benson and Chik (2012) refer to as the \"language question\" in the Hong Kong popular music scene. Specifically, the language question refers to how language choices-Cantonese, Mandarin, English or a blend of these-potentially influence production and consumption of Hong Kong popular music. While English is one of Hong Kong's official languages and the main medium of instruction in tertiary education, as well as in English-medium primary and secondary schools, Cantonese remains the de facto language among the locals across everyday and institutional contexts, including the entertainment and music industry. In view of this, it would be necessary to investigate the factors contributing to their choice to use English, perhaps as a strategic move away from the \"mainstream\" music scene. In the following, I first explain briefly how language choice might be influenced by the development of Hong Kong popular music. Th is is followed by an explanation of the concept of \"metaphor\" and its relevance to an understanding of the language question. I then report on the findings from a corpus study of metaphor in English lyrics in Hong Kong independent (or \"indie\") music and those of a recent qualitative study in which indie musicians were interviewed and their lyrics examined. To conclude the chapter, I discuss the significance of the two studies in understanding how Hong Kong ESL users shape their identities through language. I also point to three potential directions for future research on Hong Kong independent music.\n\nMontreal-based indie-rock band “Arcade Fire” have been lauded as the most important band of the last decade.

In terms of their cultural and potentially theological significance it has been argued that Arcade Fire is to Gen Y what U2 is to Gen X. This chapter explores the music and content of their latest album Reflektor, released in October 2013. The main influences in this album are Haitian “rara” music, the 1959 film Black Orpheus, and an essay by Danish philosopher and theologian Søren Kierkegaard entitled ”The Present Age,” in which he contrasts the “passionate age” with the “reflective age.” These influences and the resultant themes are explored, with a final reflection framed by the Apostle Paul’s interaction with his contemporary culture, and using the work of Charles Taylor, to discover ways in which this important voice from the margins might speak to and help the contemporary church as it engages in mission in the postmodern world.\n\nThis book examines the post-1960s era of popular music in the Anglo-Black Atlantic through the prism of historical theory and methods.

By using a series of case studies, this book mobilizes historical theory and methods to underline different expressions of alternative music functioning within a mainstream musical industry. Each chapter highlights a particular theory or method while simultaneously weaving it through a genre of music expressing a notion of alternativity―an explicit positioning of one’s expression outside and counter to the mainstream. Historical Theory and Methods through Popular Music seeks to fill a gap in current scholarship by offering a collection written specifically for the pedagogical and theoretical needs of those interested in the topic.\n\n“This study of ‘insurgent’ modes of popular music in the last third of the 20th century accomplishes quite a feat. It yokes together a wide swath of sub-genres and styles--including reggae, punk, hip hop, alternative rock and country—through the lens of what the authors are calling “historical theory,” in order to chart a different, more comprehensive pathway through the annals of pop music history. Shonk and McClure achieve an enviable balance of accessibility and scholarly depth, making this volume ideal for introductory college courses as well as more experienced researchers seeking a quick guide to specialized topics.”\n\n--Pamela Fox, author of Natural Acts: Gender, Race, and Rusticity in Country Music; co-author of Old Roots, New Routes: The Cultural Politics of Alt.Country Music\n\nAustralian Indie music is just one of the various global offshoots of the post 1980’s trend towards more localised, lived-experience based, cultural product creation (Cummings, 2008).

A useful resource in conceptualising what constitutes Indie music generally is David Hesmondhalgh’s 1999 analysis of the importance of the word indie, found in volume 13 of Cultural Studies;\n\n“The mid-1980s’ coining and adoption of the term, an abbreviation of ‘independent’ (as in independent record company) was highly significant: no music genre had ever before taken its name from the form of industrial organisation behind it. For indie pro- claimed itself to be superior to other genres not only because it was more relevant or authentic to the youth who produced and consumed it” (p.35)\n\nThis formulation of what it means to be ‘indie’ is integral when considering the effect transnational forces might have on Australian indie music. The main question then, is how can something so firmly rooted in ‘the local’ possibly survive the breaking down of global barriers associated with the rise of transnational media? Can something so contingent on local social structures and cultural infrastructure retain its level of perceived “superiority” and “authenticity” when faced with the now near-free flowing exchange of cultural ideas which globalisation has brought us?\n\nSome front matter including table of contents from a rough draft of an anthology with the working title \"Outsight Anthology - 25 Years of Music Journalism\".

This is an anthology of a quarter century of music journalism in print, on the web, and on air. Starting in 1989 with music journalism in Detroit's Jam Rag, then a self-syndicated column of the alternative press, this morphed into Outsight Radio Hours: New & non-mainstream music with artist interviews. A new, 2-hour episode was produced weekly from the late 90s until July, 2014.\n\n------------------------------\n\nI am closing in on a first draft of my book project and I plan to start sending out feelers today, so I hope to get some good feedback, ideas. I am keeping the full text out of distribution, but I am sharing the TOC and a bit of frontmatter: https://www.academia.edu/45175577/Outsight_Anthology_25_Years_of_Music_Journalism\n\nI began with about 700 items. Now, 100% have been transcribed and all but 41 (about one half of one percent) and proofed, refined, and placed in the lager work. It takes me between an hour or two per interview to do that final step. So, I am about eighty hours of work away from a first draft. This should happen some time by the end of year. (I work mostly on Sundays and occasional evenings.)\n\nThe working draft is already closing in on eight thousand(!) pages, so I that to be about the length of the finished work. What do to with it!\n\nI am looking for suggestions. One idea is to find some publisher to put out an extremely abridged version with something like a PDF of the entire work available as a download to purchasers. Another idea is to schedule out blog posts of one item per day over a couple of years.\n\nAny other ideas? Pros and cons?\n\nThank you\n\nThe present-day impulse to slow down and embrace one's roots, as a reaction to internet-fuelled neurasthenia, is a foundational facet of indie neofado hybrid music production.

However, this article explores a flipside of this phenomenon: The indie neofado band Deolinda performs music that jolts as it mollifies. Deolinda's innocuous revolution is comprised of elliptical and ironic lyrics which whisper of an urgency in the forced stasis of national economic stagnation and which shout against an idle complacency in the self-imposed immobility of the Portuguese millennial generation known as geração à rasca (generation scraping by). The band's lyrics are written from the innocent perspective of a fictional cartoon girl named Deolinda as she observes twenty-first century Portuguese life. The child protagonist perceives the common sense we all share—those ideological structures which are invisible to us precisely due to their transparent and 'natural' position in the existing scheme of things—from a drastically different worldview, one that renders these ideological structures visible as profoundly uncommon and unnatural. Deolinda's adolescent insight has helped to form the foundation of an entire Portuguese youth movement which has taken to the street in protest over the turn-of-the-decade economic crisis and externally imposed austerity measures. Several national journalists have pointed to this protest movement as a template for the Spanish indignados and, therefore, the U.S. occupy movements.\n\nThis chapter examines how social media platforms strengthen the independent scene in Chile by bringing artists closer to their fan base and helping them make decisions about their music in looking to international reach.

Chile, isolated by distance and geography, has a small population (17 million) compared to other Latin countries, and is not as attractive to investments from the music industry. Based on data gathered from different actors within the current scene (bands, solo projects, label personnel, fans) from three cities (Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción) (N: 30), we discusses the impact social media has on the promotion and consumption of music; and on the organization of the scene across local and international boundaries. We argue that Chile's indie scene centrally revolves around social media, not only for the promotion of music and gigs, but also to facilitate the exchange between music, fans, and labels. The centrality of social media has overcomes an otherwise sense of isolation from global music scenes. Indie values are configured around an entrepreneurial and adaptable spirit, and so has seen the most growth through social media, even though some tensions emerge for different actors of the scene in relation to selfpromotion, socialization, and precariousness.\n\nThis chapter examines the re-configuration of Jess Franco in the late 1980s and early 1990s as both a cult figure and an active agent in the changing coordinates of the Spanish cultural scene.

For this purpose, we use a wide spectrum of primary sources and a series of interviews with some key players in Franco’s revival—namely, music entrepreneur and fanzine publisher Carlos Galán, film producer Tomás Cimadevilla, Jess Franco historian Álex Mendíbil, and comic author and curator Borja Crespo. Through this analysis, we define the contours of cult filmmaking, more generally, and cult auteurism, more specifically, within the political, social, and cultural coordinates of Spain. We also scrutinize how fan-made Spanish publications circulating in alternative circuits, such as Subterfuge or Spiral, turned pivotal in the re-definition of the Spanish cult film canon. We compare these publications to official documents such as the 1993 Filmoteca Española’s retrospective (curated by Carlos Aguilar) brochure and mainstream press articles from daily national newspapers such as La Vanguardia or El País. In addition, we trace a series of connections between the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s Spanish underground and indie scenes, and Jess Franco. We analyze the intimate relationship between the indie music scene, concentrating on Franco’s music video for the Los Planetas rock band and the significant contribution of the music label and publishing house to the making of his film Killer Barbys (1996). Consequently, we study the concept of cult filmmaking as a cross-media phenomenon where diverse players, stemming from different disciplines, intervene. Finally, the chapter explores how Franco’s subcultural production has filtered into the Spanish cinematic mainstream through the work of filmmakers such as Álex de la Iglesia, Santiago Segura and Pablo Berger. We hope to demonstrate how Jess Franco became a privileged mentor and reference for a new breed of creators who aimed at superseding the existing status quo within the Spanish cultural scene.\n\nThis article discusses the notion of amiguismo within Chilean indie music circles.

Amiguismo is the contention that indie music in Chile is produced through interpersonal favours, thus hamstringing the sector’s economic and artistic development. The article analyses how two indie music venues in Santiago are composed by interconnected musicians and media workers. It contends that complaints about amiguismo arise as participants seek to make their activities of musical production and circulation economically sustainable. The struggle over resources highlights the politics of sociality underlying music production, which clashes with historical understandings of art, the public sphere, and the market as a-social. The notion of amiguismo thus highlights the political dimension of musical and social life within the ideologies of capitalist modernity that deny such politics. The article argues for the importance of examining economic concerns in analyses of the formation of public culture and musical meaning, and suggests that musical study can contribute to understanding the contradictions of capitalism.\n\nIn “How to Disappear,” a song from her last album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Lana Del Rey leads us to expect a how-to manual, but she gives us a poem instead: “Now it’s been years since I left New York / I got a kid and two cats in the... more\n\nIn “How to Disappear,” a song from\n\nher last album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Lana Del Rey leads us\n\nto expect a how-to manual, but she\n\ngives us a poem instead:\n\n“Now it’s been years since I left New York /\n\nI got a kid and two cats in the yard /\n\nThe California sun and the movie stars\n\nI watch the skies getting light as I write / As I think about those years / As I whisper in your ear / I’m always gon’ to be right here / No one’s going anywhere.”\n\nSuch an unabashed display of sentimentality is compounded by the photographic and/or painterly image on the album’s cover, in which Del Rey clings to a man, a handsome man, and she clings to the American flag and Americana, and she clings to kitsch and she clings to melodrama and the problematic histories that each of these normative and patriarchal phenomena might provide, even as they all sink together. Staying with the doomed ship (loving the doomed ship, even) is an act of radical generosity.\n\nDuring the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, 'lo-fi,' a term suggesting poor sound quality, the opposite of 'hi-fi,' became a characteristic perceived in certain popular-music recordings and eventually emerged as a category... more\n\nDuring the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, 'lo-fi,' a term suggesting poor sound quality, the opposite of 'hi-fi,' became a characteristic perceived in certain popular-music recordings and eventually emerged as a category within independent or 'indie' popular music. It is typically taken to express the technical and technological deficiencies associated with amateur or 'DIY' musical production, namely at home using cheap recording equipment. However, this thesis rejects the assumption that lo-fi equates to a mode of production and charts it as a construction and a certain aesthetics within popular music discourse, defined as 'a positive appreciation of what are perceived and/or considered normatively interpreted as imperfections in a recording.' I chart the development and manifestation of lo-fi aesthetics, and the ways it focuses on various 'lo-fi effects' such as noise, distortion ('phonographic imperfections') and performance imperfections, in several decades of newspapers, magazines and websites covering popular music in the English-speaking world.\n\nI argue that lo-fi aesthetics is not merely the unmediated, realist authenticity that it is often claimed to be, but one that is also fascinated with the distance from perceived commercial norms of technique and technology (or 'technocracy') that lo-fi effects signify. Lo-fi aesthetics derives from aesthetics of primitivism and realism that extend back long before phonographic imperfections were positively received. I also differentiate between lo-fi aesthetics and aesthetics of noise music, distortion in rock, glitch, punk and cassette culture. An appreciation for recording imperfections and the development of 'lo-fi' as a construction and a category is charted since the 1950s and particularly in the 1980s, 1990s and in the twenty-first century, taking in the reception of artists such as the Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan, Hasil Adkins, the Shaggs, Jandek, Daniel Johnston, Beat Happening, Pavement, Sebadoh, Guided By Voices, Beck, Will Oldham, Ariel Pink and Willis Earl Beal.\n\nTaiwanese indie bands are getting noticed for their actively crossing international borders and performing in various Asian and western countries.Using materials from a decade of research on Taiwan’s indie music development, the author... more\n\nTaiwanese indie bands are getting noticed for their actively crossing international borders and performing in various Asian and western countries.Using materials from a decade of research on Taiwan’s indie music development, the author outlines three paths through which Taiwanese indie music has taken to establishing a foothold in the overseas markets:\n\n(1) rising from indie music scene, crossing over to the mainstream market, and then embracing the global Mandopop market;\n\n(2) rising from the indie music scene and connecting with comparable indie musicians and audiences through the East Asian DIY network;\n\n(3) performing actively and translocally through the brokerage of entrepreneurial indie promoters.\n\nTaking these three coexisting models into account, this chapter will illuminate the transnational development of Taiwanese indie music. Most crucially, indie music acts have apparently engaged in grassroots, bottom-up, transnational practices emerging outside of the mainstream music industry and the top-down governmental support.\n\nR.E.M. transformed itself from a locally-identified music group from Athens, Georgia to an anonymous, postmodern band in the period between 1983-1995.

Forming in Athens in the early 1980s, when most of the members were enrolled at the University of Georgia, R.E.M. has released an ep, ten albums and three compilation albums. Michael Stipe sang and became the group’s enigmatic frontman: Peter Buck, the allegedly self-taught musical historian, primarily played guitar; Mike Mills played bass and keyboards, and sang back up; and Bill Berry, noted for his bushy eyebrow, played drums and also sang back up. Always relentlessly identified as hailing from Athens, Georgia, at the outset of its career, R.E.M. toured locally, but also configured itself outside that home-base as representing a new South. Paradoxically, however, as it became more successful, the band deliberately became, at least in some ways, more anonymous and less-regionally identified.\n\nCritically valorized as one of the most erudite, articulate and principled of American rock bands, R.E.M. had rejected traditional Southern rock mores and music--an association with Jack Daniels, macho posturing, Confederate flags and fraternities, as well as a more blues based guitar sound--and instead tried to convey a new Southern sensibility, partly gothic, pastoral and lyrical, and partly cosmopolitan. At first, the band embraced its own vision of Southern culture, primarily in the context of Southern religion and aestheticism, and its potential for anonymity, but gradually tried to replace that identification with a mixture of politics and postmodernity, one that finally emblematizes not the South but the West. In this article, I explore how R.E.M. used both the South and postmodernism in its self-configuration, and especially its visual self-presentation, and why the two finally became incompatible, though only partly incommensurate, modes of representation.\n\nRecent years have seen not just a revival, but a rebirth of the analogue record.

More than merely a nostalgic craze, vinyl has become a cultural icon. As music consumption migrated to digital and online, this seemingly obsolete medium became the fastest-growing format in music sales. Whilst vinyl never ceased to be the favorite amongst many music lovers and DJs, from the late 1980s the recording industry regarded it as an outdated relic, consigned to dusty domestic corners and obscure record shops. So why is vinyl now experiencing a 'rebirth of its cool'?\n\nDominik Bartmanski and Ian Woodward explore this question by combining a cultural sociological approach with insights from material culture studies. Presenting vinyl as a multifaceted cultural object, they investigate the reasons behind its persistence within our technologically accelerated culture. Informed by media analysis, urban ethnography and the authors' interviews with musicians, DJs, sound engineers, record store owners, collectors and cutting-edge label chiefs from a range of metropolitan centres renowned for thriving music scenes including London, New York, Tokyo, Melbourne, and especially Berlin, what emerges is a story of a modern icon.\n\nEndorsements & Reviews:\n\n“Vinyl is a state-of-the-art treatment of an unforgettable object and medium that raises many of the issues central to contemporary anthropology. Its subject-matter should make it appealing to students and general audiences, while its theoretical sophistication makes it relevant to scholars of music, technology, popular culture, and cultural objects.” – Jack David Eller, Anthropology Review Database\n\n“Bartmanski and Woodward have created a masterpiece that any record lover should have on their shelves” – Record Collector magazine\n\n“Bartmanski and Woodward … provide meticulous detail as to how materiality matters … Bartmanski and Woodward divide their book into chapters that fervently trace various aspects of vinyl: its history, its functionality and use as a medium, its production and physical properties, and its consumption. In each chapter, they attend to the materially mediated cultural meanings within which vinyl is entangled.” – Robin Bartram, Northwestern University, Qualitative Sociology\n\n“Vinyl culture is back, and it’s even more vibrant than it was in its heyday, before digitalization. Bartmanski and Woodward take us to the epicentres of this revolution, and let those who are behind it tell us about their passions for this iconic medium. This is an exemplary study of the social and sensory life of things.\" - David Howes, Professor of Anthropology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada\n\n“In the age of the digital, with the ubiquitous smart phone and MP3 technologies providing consumers with instant access to global sounds irrespective of where they are, Vinyl explores the persistence of an old technology within the production and consumption of music. In doing so it demonstrates the complex ways in which material objects form a meaningful part of our everyday lives – not just through the sounds of vinyl but by how it feels and looks. The text is beautifully written, impassioned, yet critical. Welcome to the world of the post-digital.” – Michael Bull, Professor of Sound Studies, University of Sussex, UK.\n\n“A passionate ode to the analogue record, and testament to how vinyl embodies the content it mediates, with each record's unique journey etched into the material” – Hillegonda C.

To do so, this analysis will go through a study of the context in which music business is nowadays (cultural, social, technological issues) and the way indies moved in the past and are moving in the present of the industry. These issues will be examined in the first section, while in the second one will be provided the business structure of the labels, to be put in comparison with different models within the music industry (major labels and self-produced artists). Then, the second chapter will outline a common history of independent record labels, in order to provide a unified vision of their work, despite of subjective contexts. The last section will point out, via speculations and theories on the near future of the music business, the prospected expectations of independent labels, aiming to detect the identity and the role of these companies in today’s and tomorrow’s business.\n\nFinally, this research will explain how close is the relationship between the purely-economic model of independent labels and the artistic production, trying to determine a link between the success of these labels and the artistic freedom given to the artists.\n\nIndie music in East Asia has experienced tremendous growth in popularity since the mid-2000s, especially in China and Taiwan.

This trend has encouraged a number of indie bands to pursue more radical and alternative 'do-it-yourself' (DIY) careers within their local underground music scenes. Taking two bands from Beijing and Taipei as case studies, this article argues that their DIY music careers help them both to survive through their aesthetic freedom and to confront the paradoxical government involvement in the local music market. P.K. 14, a band from China, practice a pragmatic DIY music career with an oblique resistance to political authorities. Touming Magazine, a band from Taiwan, pursue a DIY career through punk ethics to fight against an overwhelming neoliberal discourse and a promotional state policy of developing a cultural and creative industry. While DIY career practitioners have opened up alternative possibilities to preserve the autonomy of making music, such a career path is still challenged by an unsustainable market, a shortage of financing, and the continued dominance of major music companies' own platforms. The situations these musicians face illustrate a more ambivalent type of politics, beyond mere emancipation, in their pursuit of a DIY career.\n\nFreak Scenes explores the increased licensing of indie music and representation of indie music cultures within American independent cinema since the 1980s.

Indie music has, since the 2000s, become highlighted in some indie films as an attraction, but this book probes how the appeal of indie music stretches back to the late 1970s, when punk music made its impact on filmmaking.\n\nSexton looks at a range of issues where indie music and indie film intersect, including commercial concerns, the growth of niche marketing, the increased employment of popular music in cinema and questions of authenticity, as well as the fraught tensions between commercial and artistic concerns. Case studies include: sonic authorship and indie music, representations of punk and indie scenes on screen, and an exploration of how racial and gender issues inform the representation and reception of indie cultures on film.\n\nIncluded are table of contents and proofs of the introduction.\n\nChuangzuo has emerged as a music trend through a music movement, and as a popular culture for youth in Malaysia, but the music of chuangzuo have not been described to the general public that is probably not aware of the identity in... more\n\nChuangzuo has emerged as a music trend through a music movement, and as a popular culture for youth in Malaysia, but the music of chuangzuo have not been described to the general public that is probably not aware of the identity in chuangzuo, the social aspects of chuangzuo as in a gongzuofang, and also how the music has sustained so far.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the identity and the sustainability of chuangzuo activities in Malaysia. The specific objectives are to produce a description on the settings of gongzuofang in Penang, an analysis of musical materials of chuangzuo, and a clarification of the identity and sustainability of chuangzuo based on the former two specific objectives.\n\nObservation through fieldwork is rendered for this ethnographic research. The primary setting is gongzuofang in Penang, namely the Wanderers and CZMusic which have been actively involved in chuangzuo activities. Observation, interviews and video recordings of important rehearsals and actual performance were rendered. The secondary setting of the fieldwork is based on related song-writing competitions, concerts and music camp, which were held in Penang and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe general phenomenon of chuangzuo depicts a scene where youth perform their own music compositions with guitars or light instruments. Chuangzuo is a music activity for the youth in Malaysia, as the music, mainly performed in Chinese, often depicts the youth’s life-cycle events. The music is commonly composed in the sentimental style or of a ballad that usually adopts a major key and the common simple quadruple time. Instrumentation is usually simple, and Chinese texts with rhymes are used. Though mixed language and vocables are included sometimes, the texts are commonly written in the discursive style.\n\nA gongzuofang is the basic unit of chuangzuo that accommodates youth’s music activities. It exists as an important space for music practice, music learning, idea sharing, planning, music presentation, socialisation, and also life-cycle events. The studied gongzuofang represents a typical organisation that provides its members with abundant opportunities in music compositions, as members learn to compose, perform, compete in music contests and produce music concerts or music recording.\n\nChuangzuo is an opportunity for youth to engage with music. They usually adopt elements of cultural fusion in their compositions, and they show amateurish characteristics in their music. This has formed the musical identity of chuangzuo. The social identity of chuangzuo is built through identity construction, individuality, communion formation and aspiration. Nevertheless, the need to survive changes for the long term has triggered the implementation of sustainability in the handling of chuangzuo. The sustainable ways, as observed, are organisation, commercialisation, hegemony and exclusion of certain music genres."
