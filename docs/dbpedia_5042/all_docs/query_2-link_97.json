        "text": "SHOUTS of “Brooklyn!” cut through the applause at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Valentine’s Day for the sold-out homecoming show of Yeasayer and MGMT, two of the borough’s reigning new buzz bands. And as Yeasayer rang out the last chords of “2080,” an echoey, disorienting song about environmental apocalypse, its singer, Chris Keating, made an announcement.\n\n“We’re going to play that on TV tomorrow,” he said with pride and disbelief, as the band members traded shrugs. “Yeah, TV,” he added. “Seriously. Conan O’Brien, tomorrow night.”\n\nThe crowd roared its approval. “Brooklyn!”\n\nBoth Yeasayer and MGMT released debut albums in the fall and were finishing a joint nationwide tour. And while it’s no surprise that a hip New York group would get network air time, it’s remarkable that music as dense and challenging as Yeasayer’s would bubble up so quickly. Its songs are tribal yet futuristic, with flashes of African and Middle Eastern melody, and tangles of electronic effects that recall 1970s progressive rock. Little known beyond the blognoscenti until October, when it made a splash at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, the group was bringing its self-described “Middle Eastern-psych-snap-gospel” to a mass television audience by mid-February.\n\nFor rock bands this is a great time to be weird and independent in Brooklyn. After years in which the sound of New York was defined by various shades of retro monochrome  the new wave minimalism of the Strokes, the disco-punk of the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem, the moody Anglophilia of Interpol  a new generation is making music that is indefinably eclectic and complex, and finding acclaim around the world.\n\nArty bands have long been essential to the musical fabric of New York, from the Velvet Underground to Sonic Youth to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. And while the current avant-garde bands aren’t shooting for the top of the pop charts, they face a very different business climate from that of their predecessors. In ages past many found homes at the major record labels, where, as “boutique signings,” they brought prestige rather than profit.\n\nBut with the music industry in crisis, and alternative rock particularly hard hit  the genre lost 19 percent of its sales last year alone  fewer and fewer such acts are being signed by the majors. Instead many choose to remain in the indie world, largely free from the commercial demands of the mainstream. And one result has been ever more diverse and experimental music.\n\nBrooklyn is “the most exciting place on the earth musically at the moment,” said Alex Miller, the new bands editor of NME, a British music magazine. “It’s gotten to the point where I had to stop constantly writing about Brooklyn because every week there seemed to be another five bands that were really interesting.”\n\nTo name just a few stars of the class of Brooklyn ’08: Battles, specializing in devilishly convoluted yet playful grooves; Dirty Projectors, led by a Yale music dropout equally virtuosic at punk guitar and classical orchestration; Grizzly Bear, with its layers of haunting, psychedelic harmonies; High Places, a primitivist male-female duo; the punishingly noisy Psychic Ills; Gang Gang Dance, with its polyglot sound collages; and Dragons of Zynth, who borrow some of the swirling atmospherics and cutting post-punk guitars of their mentors, TV on the Radio.\n\nEven the more pop-leaning new bands are adventuresome. Vampire Weekend, the three-fourths-Brooklyn group that is the breakout indie success of the year, updates the clean lines of new wave with touches of African guitar. And MGMT, the odd group out that signed with a major label, recorded its spacey, catchy album “Oracular Spectacular” with Dave Fridmann, known for his work with the Flaming Lips. (Both Vampire Weekend and MGMT, along with Yeasayer, High Places, Psychic Ills and hundreds of others, will be at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., next week.)\n\nThe success of bands like Yeasayer and Vampire Weekend is to some degree an indication of a thirst for new ideas in a rock landscape that, from mainstream radio down to the underground, has been sorely lacking in them.\n\n“Pop-rock has gotten so unsophisticated that experimental rock is the only thing to turn to,” said Anand Wilder, Yeasayer’s guitarist. “You have these frat guys in Atlanta who are too sophisticated to listen to Creed and Nickelback, so they’re like, ‘Maybe I’ll read this site Pitchfork and find out about this band Yeasayer or Dirty Projectors.’ ”\n\nThe new trend is also simply an effect of the swinging pendulum of New York music. In the years after the Strokes released their game-changing album “Is This It” in 2001, a raft of local bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem  their common musical denominator was a back-to-basics simplicity  were signed by major labels with some commercial expectations. But big sales proved elusive for group after group. “Is This It,” released in more robust times for the industry, went platinum, but sales slid for subsequent Strokes discs; the latest, “First Impressions of Earth,” moved 310,000 copies. LCD Soundsystem’s “Sound of Silver” topped the most recent Pazz & Jop critics’ poll in The Village Voice, but has plateaued at a modest 103,000.\n\nThe New York hipster mystique, it seems, hasn’t played well in the all-important marketplace of suburbia. “When you’ve got too much of a New York tag on you,” said Steve Ralbovsky, a veteran record executive, who signed the Strokes to RCA and now runs an imprint at Columbia, “it may endear you to places like Tokyo and London and Los Angeles. It may not endear you so much to other places in the country.”\n\nMeanwhile the local experimental scene was being regenerated. Odd trends sprung up, like an out-of-nowhere fascination with the guitar counterpoint of African highlife music. Groups like Battles, Grizzly Bear and Yeasayer made knotty technical complexity a defining characteristic of the New York rock sound for the first time in recent memory.\n\nFor Dave Longstreth, compositional polish is rooted in his education. He studied music and art at Yale, but “disappointed by school,” he spent his time making music under the name Dirty Projectors. (Now a full band, it’s had a number of different lineups.) Linking guitars with meticulously arranged classical instruments and slippery harmonies, he developed a style that juxtaposes the raw and the lush. For Dirty Projectors’ sixth and latest record, “Rise Above,” Mr. Longstreth reworked Black Flag’s 1981 hardcore classic “Damaged” as an exotic, intricate rhapsody.\n\nOver rice and beans at a Mexican lunch counter in industrial Williamsburg, Mr. Longstreth, who has a boyish giggle but at 26 is a self-reliant pro, explained the creative draw of Brooklyn. “If you don’t feel like you can live anywhere, you can live in New York and you’re home,” he said, though he spends half the year on the road.\n\nDespite gentrification Brooklyn is still a magnet for bohemians, though they have had to colonize ever deeper reaches. (Mr. Longstreth lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant.)\n\nThe sound of a city used to develop slowly and with limited influences, but in the Internet era the geographic barriers of music have largely been demolished. “We’re such a global village now,” said Dave Konopka, who plays guitar and bass in Battles, that instantly “you can have a band in London or Omaha that sounds exactly like a band in New York.”\n\nAnd yet New York bands have digested global influences in peculiar and recognizable ways. The Beach Boys-esque melodies of Animal Collective, for example, have a claustrophobic and utterly un-Californian intensity, and the lilting African guitars in Dirty Projectors and Battles are disrupted by spasms of noise.\n\nWith the promotional powers of the Internet and a network of increasingly sophisticated independent labels, bands that don’t have an obvious shot a mass popularity are finding fewer reasons to sign with the majors.\n\nAt the same time the majors, struggling with a huge sales slump, have been forced to focus on pop acts with broader appeal. The era of the boutique band is largely over, said Danny Goldberg, who has managed Sonic Youth and Nirvana and been head of Warner Brothers and Atlantic.\n\n“The majors have to think very short-term,” he said. “They need hits. It used to be that they were in that business but also in the business of developing long-term acts, so that they could sign a Talking Heads, and over a period of time they would become valuable. But that secondary part of their business is simply a luxury they can’t afford anymore.”\n\nWith the music industry in flux and diminished expectations all around, no band’s career trajectory is quite what it used to be. Vampire Weekend, by far the most commercially viable group on this scene, was the focus of a bidding war that included majors, but it signed with XL, an indie; its self-titled debut opened in the Top 20. MGMT went to Columbia despite a self-professed lack of pop appeal. And Yeasayer, emblematic of the scene’s brainy new direction, is fielding calls from companies of all stripes, said its manager, Jason Foster.\n\nFor the most part those low sales expectations have been borne out by the marketplace. Yeasayer’s “All Hour Cymbals”  released on the label Now We Are Free, created specifically for the group by Mr. Foster  has sold only 15,000 copies, and MGMT’s “Oracular Spectacular,” even with the backing of Columbia, has moved 21,000 since it became available in October."
