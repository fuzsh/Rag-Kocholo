        "text": "Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand\n\nAnother of the British post-punk revival bands, Franz’s hit Take Me Out enjoyed that tricky time-signature change and a dancefloor beat, but there was more to them than Gang Of Four impersonations. Key track: The Dark Of The Matinee.\n\nFoals - Antidotes\n\nFoals' debut was an indie rock was a critical and commercial success, peaking at number three in the UK album chart. The record - which was released on 8 April, and included the singles Cassius, Red Socks Pugie, Olympic Airways and Balloons, proved that the Oxford band - were bringing something different to the table.\n\nArctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\n\nAs the decade turned, guitar music got back to basics after the dark posturing of The Strokes and their ilk, and Alex Turner was the man to take indie rock back to the streets. 13 tracks of everyday Northern life set to irresistible singalong melodies. Key track: A Certain Romance.\n\nBloc Party - Silent Alarm\n\nRemember the post-punk revival of the early 00s? Bloc Party’s debut was the epitome of the genre: skittish guitars, danceable rhythms and an emotional core that dug deep. Key track: Helicopter, of course.\n\nThe Libertines - Up The Bracket\n\nWhen the cool kids were looking to New York for their thrills, Pete Doherty and Carl Barat created their own unique sound: the sound of Albion, Old England, street poetry and a title nicked from 50s comic Tony Hancock. Key track: Time For Heroes.\n\nColdplay - Parachutes\n\nThe post-Britpop era was a grim time, with some adventurous bands falling flat and some old favourites making good (The Verve, for one). It was Chris Martin that opened the 21st Century with an album of open honesty and emotion. They were all primed for superstardom. Key track: Don’t Panic.\n\nThe Streets - Original Pirate Material\n\nBritish rap was still an oddity even as late as 2002, but Mike Skinner nailed the genre with this peerless take on the UK garage scene. It’s basically the London version of Whatever People Say I Am. Key track: Has It Come To This?\n\nThe xx - XX\n\nAbout as lo-fi as you can get, The xx’s debut created a fascinating sound world, hinged around the voices of Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim and the beats of Jamie Smith. Key track: VCR\n\nKaiser Chiefs - Employment\n\nHaving aimed for the big time as Parva, it seemed like the last chance for Ricky Wilson and his mates, but their debut album was packed full of amazing, sardonic indie hits, with wry lyrics and anthemic choruses. Key track: Oh My God.\n\nEditors - The Back Room\n\nDark, compelling guitar rock led by the mournful baritone of Tom Smith and the scything guitar of Chris Urbanowicz. Key track: Munich.\n\nThe Courteeners - St Jude\n\nLiam Fray, the Bard Of Middleton, set out his stall with this debut, featuring Cavorting, What Took You So Long and the key track Not Nineteen Forever.\n\nJamie T - Panic Prevention\n\nMr Treays got a Mercury nomination for this slice of everyday South London life with a selection of cutting lyrics on modern “yoof” culture. Key track: Sheila\n\nThe Maccabees - Colour It In\n\nThe London band caused much regret when they packed it in during the summer of 2017 and this is debut shows why. The charming love songs, the inspirational lyrics and the quirky arrangements, they were much-loved. Key track: Latchmere."
