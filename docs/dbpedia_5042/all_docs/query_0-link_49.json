        "text": "I've been obsessed with this distinction lately, following some interesting discussion about this in the (highly recommended!) Indie-Rock Heavyweights Poll thread. I decided to do what any person with no life would do, and that's crunch some numbers.\n\nI took a list of 50 albums, and then did two Google searches for each one. First search would be the artist, album title, and the term \"alternative\":\n\n\"pearl jam\" \"vitalogy\" alternative\n\nSecond search would be the artist, album title, and the term \"indie\":\n\n\"pearl jam\" \"vitalogy\" indie\n\nGet the hit counts from both searches, compute the percent of the total between the two searches that came from the \"indie\" search, and there's a (crude) measure of the degree to which an album is more \"indie\" than \"alternative\".\n\nI chose the 50 albums this way:\n\n- 10 albums identified as \"indie\", from the Indie-Rock Heavyweights thread. I chose the ten albums that were leading the poll, although sometimes changed to a different album by the same artist if I was worried that the title was too common a word to get and would get too many false positives. Acts included Neutral Milk Hotel, the Arcade Fire, and the Decemberists.\n\n- 10 early-1990s albums that I consider very much \"alternative\": the big four Seattle acts (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains), R.E.M., Urge Overkill, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, etc.\n\n- 10 mid-1990s to early-2000s albums from the second and third wave of acts that followed the earlier alternative acts: Bush, Stone Temple Pilots, Creed, Nickelback, etc. These acts specialized in heavy rock, and didn't really get the most positive critical reception. I identified these as \"post-grunge\".\n\n- 10 albums by rock acts that I considered at the \"borderline\" of alternative and indie. Virtually all of these are from the early 2000s: the Strokes, the White Stripes, Trail of Dead, etc.\n\n- 10 albums by rock acts that I wouldn't identify as alternative or indie: U2, Coldplay, Muse, Kings of Leon, etc. I considered these \"mainstream acts\", and feel like the proportion of hits here would give us a good baseline to work off of; their percent indie is the \"default\" percent indie.\n\nHere's the main findings:\n\n- The group with the highest percentage of hits on the \"indie\" side are, unsurprisingly, the \"Indie\" group; 57% of their hits were on the \"indie\" search. The most \"Indie\" album of all 50 searched is the Decembrists' \"Picaresque\", for which 63% of the hits were from the \"Indie\" search.\n\n- More surprisingly, the highest percentage of hits on the \"alternative\" side is not the early-'90s \"Alternative\" group (61% \"alternative\"), but rather the mid- and late-1990's \"Post-grunge\" group (67% \"alternative\")! This makes some sense to me after I think about it: these bands followed in the wake of the earlier \"alternative\" acts, so they get that label, but, unlike the earlier bands, have not at all influenced today's \"indie\" acts, so they never get mentioned in discussions of \"indie\" music. The least \"indie\" album searched was Our Lady Peace's \"Naveed\", which got 76% of its hits on the \"alternative\" side.\n\n- The \"Mainstream\" albums (U2 etc.) got 45% of their hits on the \"indie\" side, suggesting that the terminology overall learns toward \"alternative\" rather than \"indie\".\n\n- The \"Borderline\" albums (Strokes etc.) landed 51% of their hits on the \"indie\" side, which is both a) higher than the mainstream number and b) closer to the rate for the \"Indie\" group than it is to the rate for the \"Alternative\" group. So they are probably closer to \"indie\" and \"alternative.\"\n\nHere's the full list of albums, along with their grouping and the percentage of their hits on the \"indie\" side. It's in order from most indie to least indie:\n\nDecemberists, \"Picaresque\" (Indie) - 63%\n\nTrail of Dead, \"Source Tags and Codes\" (Borderline) - 62%\n\nModest Mouse, \"The Moon and Antarctica\" (Indie) - 60%\n\nAnimal Collective, \"Merriweather Post Pavilion\" (Indie) - 59%\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel, \"In The Aeroplane Over the Sea\" (Indie) - 59%\n\nBelle and Sebastian, \"If You're Feeling Sinister\" (Indie) - 59%\n\nInterpol, \"Turn On The Bright Lights\" (Borderline) - 58%\n\nArcade Fire, \"Neon Bible\" (Indie) - 57%\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs, \"Fever to Tell\" (Borderline) - 57%\n\nGuided by Voices, \"Bee Thousand\" (Indie) - 55%\n\nPavement, \"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\" (Indie) - 55%\n\nBuilt to Spill, \"Keep It Like A Secret\" (Indie) - 53%\n\nSnow Patrol, \"Eyes Open\" (Mainstream) - 53%\n\nYo la Tengo, \"I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One\" (Indie) - 53%\n\nThe Killers, \"Hot Fuss\" (Borderline) - 51%\n\nU2, \"Achtung Baby\" (Mainstream) - 51%\n\nBlack Crowes, \"Amorica\" (Mainstream) - 51%\n\nINXS, \"Welcome to Wherever You Are\" (Mainstream) - 50%\n\nThe Strokes, \"Room on Fire\" (Borderline) - 50%\n\nDoves, \"The Last Broadcast\" (Borderline) - 50%\n\nThe Vines, \"Highly Evolved\" (Borderline) - 49%\n\nRide, \"Going Blank Again\" (Alternative) - 49%\n\nWilco, \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\" (Borderline) - 48%\n\nBlack Keys, \"Thickfreakness\" (Mainstream) - 48%\n\nNed's Atomic Dustbin, \"God Fodder\" (Alternative) - 47%\n\nOasis, \"What's the Story Morning Glory\" (Mainstream) - 46%\n\nWhite Stripes, \"White Blood Cells\" (Borderline) - 43%\n\nR.E.M., \"Automatic for the People\" (Alternative) - 43%\n\nUrge Overkill, \"Saturation\" (Alternative) - 42%\n\nCreed, \"Human Clay\" (Post-Grunge) - 42%\n\nHives, \"Veni Vidi Vicious\" (Borderline) - 40%\n\nMatchbox Twenty, \"Yourself or Someone Like You\" (Post-Grunge) - 40%\n\nSugar, \"Copper Blue\" (Alternative) - 40%\n\nBush, \"Razorblade Suitcase\" (Post-Grunge) - 39%\n\nColdplay, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" (Mainstream) - 39%\n\nMuse, \"Black Holes and Revelations\" (Mainstream) - 39%\n\nKings of Leon, \"Aha Shake Heartbreak\" (Mainstream) - 36%\n\nSmashing Pumpkins, \"Siamese Dream\" (Alternative) - 36%\n\n3 Doors Down, \"Away From The Sun\" (Post-Grunge) - 36%\n\nSoundgarden, \"Superunknown\" (Alternative) - 35%\n\nPearl Jam, \"Vitalogy\" (Alternative) - 35%\n\nPuddle of Mudd, \"Come Clean\" (Post-Grunge) - 35%\n\nNirvana, \"In Utero\" (Alternative) - 33%\n\nFoo Fighters, \"The Colour and the Shape\" (Mainstream) - 32%\n\nNickelback, \"Silver Side Up\" (Post-Grunge) - 31%\n\nAlice in Chains, \"Jar of Flies\" (Alternative) - 31%\n\nStone Temple Pilots, \"Tiny Music\" (Post-Grunge) - 29%\n\nSeven Mary Three, \"American Standard\" (Post-Grunge) - 29%\n\nCollective Soul, \"Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid\" (Post-Grunge) - 27%\n\nOur Lady Peace, \"Naveed\" (Post-Grunge) - 24%\n\nInterested in hearing people's points of view on this distinction/criticism of this approach (\"get a life\" is of course obvious and does not need to be stated)...\n\nI think 2002-2004 is when the term \"indie\" or what we refer to as \"indie\" (or the categorization of certain bands from that time period as indie) really took off. Of course, it could be that's just when I started REALLY paying attention to \"indie\" stuff (during the garage rock revival period/very shortly thereafter). Others may disagree with me on the time frame. I'm just going by my personal experience here, especially since I never heard of or payed attention to the term \"indie\" till later.\n\nI think that stuff at the time was still considered \"alternative\" (at least to me) but I think over time we started to re-categorize it. Now I don't consider something like The Hives \"alternative\" at all, but they were getting play on mainstream alternative rock radio (at the time).\n\nCase in point: Elephant by the White Stripes came out in 2003, but according to Wikipedia: The album won Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song (\"Seven Nation Army\").\n\nThe Hives were out in 2000 with \"Hate to Say I Told You So\" but again, I considered that \"alternative\" at the time.\n\nThe Caesars had \"Jerk It Out\" in 2002 too which was a big hit with me but again, that was \"alternative\" or just \"garage rock\" to me.\n\nI would have liked to have seen the dates of release on your list, I think that would have been helpful in determining and comparing and deciphering the data.\n\nI do agree with your assessment of certain bands like the Killers being \"borderline.\" I think a lot of \"borderline\" bands retained their mainstream status but got lumped into the \"indie\" categorization over time.\n\nI agree with your first point: of course Google hits for 'indie' will reflect whether you're actually on an indie label or not. But it is interesting to see that some of the 'borderline' acts got high indie hit rates even when they were on major labels; Trail of Dead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were both on Interscope when their albums were released.\n\nI do think that it's useful to think in terms of genre. Obviously good and bad is the most important thing, but thinking in terms of evolving genres can give you a hint of where things are going.\n\nI also think that a lot of it is just a shift in terminology from \"alternative\" to \"indie\", although it's not so clean-cut: the Neutral Milk Hotel and the Pavement albums have high \"indie\" rates, for example, despite being released in the mid-'90s when \"alternative\" was the term of art.\n\nnbakid2000 is too young to remember the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nI think you have to go through the history of theses genres to understand where they come from, and why the terms are confusing as to music of today.\n\nTerms like \"college rock\" and \"alternative rock\" were commonly used to describe bands in the '80s and early '90s like R.E.M., the Cure, Jane's Addiction or Sonic Youth. As with New Wave, the bands labeled as \"alternative\" acts did not share common musical traits. But there were some common elements: the type of audience, the scene in which the bands worked, the ethos under which the music was made. You could not define \"alternative\" music clearly, but like pornography, you knew it when you saw it.\n\n\"Indie rock\" was also used in the 1980s. For example, the Smiths were more often referred to as \"British indie rock\" than as \"alternative rock\".\n\nWhen Nirvana hit mainstream success in the early 1990s, many \"alternative\" style bands won major label contracts, broke onto Top 40 radio and started playing arenas. Around that time, I recall that \"indie rock\" became more commonly used. It usually referred to bands that were distinctively outside the major-labels and outside the Top 40 radio sound of that time -- for example, lo-fi acts like Guided By Voices, Pavement or Sebadoh. In 1993, you could still call R.E.M. \"alternative\", but you certainly could not call them \"indie\". A magazine like SPIN would use the term \"indie rock\" to let readers know that it was about more than the Smashing Pumpkins/Pearl Jam \"alternative\" rock played on the radio.\n\nDuring the early to late 1990s, I think music fans understood well the difference between \"alternative\" rock versus \"indie\" rock. If the OP asked his question during that period, it would not have been a confusing issue.\n\nIn the late 1990s, \"indie rock\" bands started getting mainstream success, like Modest Mouse (which was on an indie label, and had a lo-fi sound), and later the White Stripes and Arcade Fire. Around the late 1990s through early 2000s, the line between \"alternative\" and \"indie\" became extremely fuzzy. As of the last 10 years, I think the terms have become very confusing and often interchangable.\n\nI think that your point about the distinction between \"alternative\" and \"indie\" originating in the mid-1990's makes a lot of sense to me. As \"alternative\" became the most popular kind of rock music and inevitably more commercial, another term had to be employed to describe under-the-radar, artistically important rock music, and so why not use the perfectly good existing term \"indie\". It does fit well with what I'm seeing in the data. The earliest \"indie\" albums are from the mid-1990's, and it's also in the mid-1990's that we start seeing the second wave of \"alternative\" bands (the ones I politely labeled \"post-grunge\") that often weren't all that good--the ones that actually are most strongly associated with the \"alternative\" rather than the \"indie\" term.\n\nSo is it in the mid-1990's that the narrative of artistically important rock music begins to shift from \"alternative\" to \"indie\"? Makes sense to me. Although even an act as late as the White Stripes get more hits for \"alternative\" than for \"indie\", even when the search focuses on an album recorded while still on an indie label.\n\nI don't think that the terms \"alternative\" and \"indie\" are interchangeable today; I think \"alternative\" is a dated term that's more frequently used to describe music from the past. I'm interested in the distinction, but also believe that a transition was completed from one to the other sometime in the mid-2000s.\n\nSurprisingly, I know more about 80s music (including alternative/college rock) than I know about the 90s. (what bands were termed or lumped in is a bit fuzzy though, but I know the difference between the mainstream and non-mainstream stuff) The 90s were like a black void for music as far as I was concerned. I didn't keep up with it really even though I was somewhat \"aware\" of it. I didn't start to listen to \"current\" music on my own until around 2000. Most everything in the 90s I just heard in passing out in public and very occasionally on the radio if I was flipping through.\n\nSo I'm basically clueless about most 90s \"rock\"...I probably know more about 90s pop/rock than I do about the \"alternative/grunge/indie\" stuff. The late 90s is when I started to notice more music outside of what my parents had me listening to, but again, I didn't really start to delve into it deeply till about 2000 or so.\n\nI think what you posted in the other thread is pretty much spot on:\n\nThat would pretty much be how I would explain it, too, but with these added differences...\n\n\"Indie\" was a term first coined to describe bands that were on Independent - meaning not Major - record labels.\n\n\"Alternative\" is a term used to define a certain type of music, and was originally adopted because the groups it was used to describe were an \"Alternative\" from the mainstream. \"Indie\" bands, by their nature and status, often tend to fall under the \"Alternative\" banner, but not always. (Anyone else remember that brief period in the late 80's, before the \"Alternative\" tag came along, and this type of music was refereed to as \"Post Modern\"?)\n\nWhere things started to get mixed up and confusing was during the 90's, when two things happened...\n\n1) Many \"Indie\" labels started doing distribution deals with the majors, or even joined forces with them outright. In essence, they became the minor leagues for the Major labels, and kind of blurred the lines between who was or wasn't truly \"Indie\".\n\n2) Once bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc... starting selling in the millions and became mega popular, they ceased to truly be an alternative to the mainstream, and essentially, they became the new mainstream. \"Alternative\" then became whatever the local Alt Rock radio stations were pushing, and told you it was after that.\n\nNow the term \"Indie\" has sort of become what \"Alternative\" used to mean. It's a way of describing something as an alternative to \"Alternative\", since \"Alternative\" no longer really is an alternative to anything.\n\nAlthough personally, I still subscribe to the original definition. If I say someone is an \"Indie\" band, I mean they are on an Independent record label. What type of music they play (rock, Metal, Punk, Power Pop) doesn't really factor into it.\n\nThis is how I delineate the two as well. While I appreciate the research of the OP and find the numbers interesting, defining 'Indie' is pretty cut-and-dry for me, since I tend not to listen to or enjoy music branded as such (The Blow being the one exception): If there is a poster of it in the local hipster indie music store and a glowing review on Pitchfork, it's Indie. Like Bon Iver and Bonnie Prince Billy. I'm sure there's some reason for all the critical and consumer acclaim, but I can't find one. Maybe it's just me.\n\nAlternative is a little tougher to pin down; it does/did have an associative connotation whereas indie is a more literal one (being on an independent label), but there are some groups that fall outside of nineties grunge/college rock I would consider alternative. Like Ween, Beck, and Cake. Alternative seems to carry some modicum of mainstream commercial success, while indie acts survive seemingly outside of and in some cases against conventional success.\n\nAllmusic's entry on \"Alternative/Indie Rock\" explains it this way:\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/alternative-indie-rock-ma0000012230\n\nAlternative pop/rock is essentially a catch-all term for post-punk bands from the mid-'80s to the mid-'90s. There is a multitude of musical styles within alternative rock, from the sweet melodies of jangle-pop to the disturbing metallic grind of industrial, yet are all tied together by a similar aesthetic -- they all existed and operated oustide of the mainstream. In some ways, there are two waves of alternative bands, with Nirvana's unprecedented crossover success in 1991 acting as a dividing point. Throughout the '80s, the majority of alternative bands were on independent labels; those that eventually signed to major labels, such as Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, didn't break through to the mainstream and thereby were able to keep their hip credentials alive. If anything, Alternative Rock of the '80s was even more diverse and fractured than the mainstream; among the styles classified as alternative was roots rock, alternative dance, jangle-pop, post-hardcore punk, funk-metal, punk-pop, and experimental rock. All of these genres made into the mainstream, in some form or another, after Nirvana's success in 1991, but their edges were sanded down since many of the new alternative bands were signed by majors. Consequently, '90s altenative rock often sounds more sanitized and homogenous than its counterpart, especially since the heavier material proved to have greater commercial appeal than the quieter or quirkier elements of alternative rock. Most of these idiosyncratic bands didn't sign to majors (those that did quickly disappeared), deciding to stick to independent labels, where they had more artistic freedom. These bands were grouped together under the term indie rock. Although the term had been around since the '80s, in the '90s it connotated bands that were dedicated to their own independent status, either for musical or hipness reasons.\n\nAnother forum member, not me, posted what you attributed to me.
