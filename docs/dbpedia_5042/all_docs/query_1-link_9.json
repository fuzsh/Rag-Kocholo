        "text": "Indie Rock: Indie is slang for a type of guitar orientated music derived from 'punk'. Indie has generated it's own fashions as with most youth music. Originally an abb. of Independent, being a record label not affiliated to a major label such as Sony or EMI.\n\nI have said this once and will say it again, Coldplay IS NOT INDIE!!!\n\nI tend to group them with Britpop.. It's just convenient considering their from Britain and the quality of their songs puts them in that category. But Wikipedia/Answers.com call them \"post-Britpop\"\n\nAnd well, they won grammies under the best \"Alternative Music Album\" back in 2003 for the 2002 Grammy Awards. So Alternative music? along with Radiohead, Bjork & Sigur Ros?"
