Choose from 351 of the UK's best Indie bands to deliver an amazing, high energy performance that your guests will never forget.\n\nCan any indie band play my favourite song?\n\nProfessional indie bands will often take requests, but you will need to give them plenty of notice. Please also keep in mind that indie bands may ask for an small additional fee to prepare songs that aren't already on their song list. You can view the indie band's song list on their Encore profile.\n\nHow much time do indie bands take to set up?\n\nYour indie band will usually arrive about an hour or so before their performance begins to set up and get settled before they start playing. To avoid any delays, make sure the performance space is ready for the indie band prior to their arrival.\n\nMy venue has asked for the performer’s PLI & PAT inspection certificates. What are these?\n\nPLI stands for Public Liability Insurance. This insurance covers damage to another person or their property (it is also known as third party insurance). As many of our indie bands are members of the Musician's Union, they are already covered by PLI up to £10 million. PAT stands for portable appliance testing. Most of our indie bands will already have a PAT inspection certificate for their musical equipment/PA system, which they can provide to your venue if they need it."
