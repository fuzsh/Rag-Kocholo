        "text": "A totally personal countdown of my favourite indie rock albums from UK-based artists of the last 23 years. This is article three of three — find the other two at the bottom of the article. Clap if you like, comment, and let me know who I’ve missed…\n\n10. Get to Heaven— Everything Everything (2015)\n\nI was slightly late getting into Everything Everything. I first saw them touring their first album in support of Snow Patrol. I was only about 15 and I found their sounds completely unpalatable! Later, during my first year at university, they’d hit somewhat of a more mainstream audience and Distant Past — from the album Get to Heaven — was almost always played at indie discos. One day when browsing in HMV, I decided to buy their whole album catalogue to that point and started to play it on my second-hand CD player in my shared accommodation. I still may not have given them much of a chance had it not been for my flatmate taking a liking to them. But, over the next years, they became one of my favourite bands, and this is surely their most accomplished album. Hard-hitting, urgent and experimental, it engages from start to finish. ‘No Reptiles’ is one of the most bizarrely captivating songs you could hope to here, but for me nothing beats guitar solo on Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread.\n\nBest song : Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread\n\n9. Everything Is —Nine Black Alps (2005)\n\nOne of the first UK rock bands to feature on my iPod Nano back in the late noughties, this album was somewhat of an obsession of mine. The straightforward grunge sounds of Nine Black Alps were obviously music to my young ears — and I still think this band a better than their modest following would suggest. Drawing parallels to Nirvana, this album is a collection of fast-paced songs accompanied by lyrics of frustration. But lead singer Sam Forrest also shows an aptitude for acoustic songwriting on ‘Behind Your Eyes’ and ‘Intermission’. This album was not commercially successful, despite being released through Island Records, and the band were later dropped by the label. My first ever gig was seeing them touring their third album ‘Sirens’ in a tiny bar in Tottenham Court Road with my brother in 2012.\n\nBest song: Not Everyone\n\n8. A Hundred Million Suns — Snow Patrol (2008)\n\nPossibly the most recognised album in my top 10, this is an album I have returned to many times. I remember my mum first inserting the disc, brand new, into the car’s CD player soon after its release. There is nothing like that feeling — the feeling of having a fresh batch of songs from your favourite band or artist at your fingertips ready to be played for the first time. This is a feeling I’m convinced has been dampened by streaming, and certainly has been spoiled with record companies drip-feeding songs slowly over long periods before the release of an album. This release was particularly awaited. There was a lot of excitement around Snow Patrol at the time following the commercially successful ‘Eyes Open’ which featured the biggest hit of the decade, ‘Chasing Cars’. A Hundred Million Suns was not initially as ear-grabbing, but over time, songs like ‘Crack the Shutters’ and ‘The Planets Bend Between Us’ outshine Snow Patrol’s previous records lyrically.\n\nBest song: Crack the Shutters\n\n7. Blood and Chemistry — Arcane Roots (2013)\n\nArcane Roots began ripping up the rock rulebook with their first album ‘Left Fire’ in 2012. Left Fire is an unaltered experiment of progressive rock and metal driven by Andrew Groves’ audacious guitar playing and boundless song structures. They followed this just a year later with ‘Blood and Chemistry’, which channelled the same energies into a more polished and agreeable style. With song lengths averaging over 5 minutes, Groves still indulges in complex bridges and extended guitar solos on this album however; producing songs that are layered and unpredictable. He also succeeds in splicing a slower tune, later re-pieced as the song ‘Winters Wept’, across three sections of the album. The band, now disbanded, prove on each of their albums that when artists are given complete freedom, their creative genius is unleashed.\n\nBest song: Belief\n\n6. The Cribs— The Cribs (2004)\n\nOne summer, my older brother taught me how to convert a YouTube file into mp3 format and download it onto an iPod. I spent hours downloading songs from YouTube, often with very bad sound quality. This album was one of those. Already low fidelity, a trademark of The Cribs’ early music, this must have sounded pretty scratchy through my Apple earphones, but you didn’t complain. I was initially more inclined to albums two and three from the Cribs — songs like Mirror Kissers and Our Bovine Public were boyhood anthems — but my brothers were more drawn to the sharp catchy pop tunes of their first album, and it quickly became a hit in the car. The Cribs continued to release some of my most loved albums throughout my teenage years, but this one stands out as bottling up the rebellious years of my adolescence.\n\nBest song: You and I\n\n5. White Collar Lies — Kopek (2012)\n\nKopek are little known in the UK. My brothers and I came across them during the early days of Spotify when we were on holiday in Austria. I’m certain that if we hadn’t been on the continent, they wouldn’t have popped up on our ‘recommended’ list. The quartet made a name for themselves by winning Battle of the Band competitions in their native Dublin, and released this stomping album on the back of their triumphs. Their roots in the live music scene come through on an assured and confident record that denounces political injustice and profiteering. The title track ‘White Collar Lies’ typifies an album of bombastic guitar chords and chilling lyrics that reveal socialist ideals. ‘Floridian’ exposes a romantic side to the band, and demonstrates a knack for writing anthemic rock songs.\n\nBest song: White Collar Lies\n\n4. Opposites— Biffy Clyro (2013)\n\nI could easily have included any of Biffy Clyro’s albums in this countdown, but the timing of this album was memorable for me, having completed my GCSEs this year. This titanic rock album, featuring two discs, was exactly what my 16-year-old self needed to eat up over a long summer break; and was exactly what Biffy Clyro needed to cement themselves as generational greats following the massive ‘Only Revolutions’ three years prior. Months of binging this album culminated in seeing Biffy Clyro headline Reading Festival that summer. Their dynamic — and at points deranged — set included a topless Simon Neil setting fire to his guitar. This was biblical(!) stuff, especially for the thousands of impressionable teenagers and twenty-somethings in the crowd going ballistic. The band, who until this point were not yet of legendary status, announced themselves as world-beaters with ‘Opposites’, which gave euphoria and substance to their setlists.\n\nBest song: Sounds Like Balloons\n\n3. Long Way Down — Tom Odell (2013)\n\n2013 was evidently the summit of my musical enjoyment, and it was albums like this one which I had in my ears during the hours of studying. The only singer/songwriter to make it into my top 10, Tom Odell burst onto the scene at the time with an unfettered energy to his songs that you could not ignore. For such a young man, I felt there was a maturity to his lyrics and an authenticity to his songs that often you only hear on debut albums. And no, I am not ranking this album so highly based on Odell’s natural talents alone. This album is truly enjoyable to listen to and does not wane in rhythm or emotion at any point. I recently found out that at the time, NME gave this album a score of zero out of ten — to which I was utterly shocked. There was clearly some ulterior motive behind this review, but Odell himself has since described the album as ‘naïve’. If it is indeed naïve, that is probably what I love about it most. This was the work of a young man with no preconceived ideas about how he should sound — and unsurprisingly Odell has never surmounted this album.\n\nBest song: Till I Lost\n\n2. The Big Roar — The Joy Formidable (2011)\n\nAnother eclectic and expansive rock album, The Joy Formidable made waves with this debut back in 2011, earning them a slot supporting Muse. Since then, they’ve settled into becoming another hard-working band in a saturated market trying to create something new with each album. This is still their best effort to date and has slowly emerged as one of my all-time favourite albums. The effortlessness with which this Welsh trio create ecstatic moments on this record is noticeable. As if they’re jamming, The Joy Formidable meander and deviate, and with perfect timing, zone back in on the underlying hook running through the song. This is no doubt a testament to the strong bond between the three members, who, on account of seeing their live performance, are telepathic in how they communicate with music. ‘Whirring’ is a triumph that remains one of The Joy Formidable’s only unearthed masterpieces — 15 million streams on Spotify really isn’t bad for a song more than six and a half minutes long. Whilst this album never got the recognition it deserved in my opinion, perhaps that was best for keeping The Joy Formidable wholly on their own creative path.\n\nBest song: Whirring\n\nKing of Conflict — The Virginmarys (2013)\n\nLet me assure you, I am not the only person to rate The Virginmarys very highly. At the time of release, King of Conflict was made Editors Choice by iTunes US, and The Virginmarys also picked up best newcomers at the Classic Rock Awards 2013. Appearances at festivals followed that year, but The Virginmarys would inevitably find themselves on a side stage with the other heavy metal bands. Whilst this fitted their image quite well, King of Conflict is far more accessible than the name would suggest. Lead singer and guitarist Ally Dickaty names ‘The Colour and the Shape’ by Foo Fighters as being a key inspiration for this album, and it is in that overlap between heavy rock and mainstream guitar music that this album resides. Urgent and ambitious, The Virginmarys take themselves to limits on this album to provide track after track of relentless rock songs which are as explosive on record as they are live. ‘Dead Man’s Shoes’ and ‘Bang, Bang, Bang’ may sound slightly cliché song titles for a rock band, but there really is nothing here intended to fill out the album. Dickaty delivers every verse and chorus with an authentic vocal that speaks to the soul. Danny Dolan on drums hits speeds you may not previously have thought possible. This all adds to an intensity that never really lets up. Song for song, this is my most complete UK rock or indie album of the century so far.\n\nBest song: Portrait of Red\n\nListen on Spotify : https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6OUmKMRUmnspEC7e6s7W81?si=7c90805e97f14ab9\n\nFind articles one and two of the series below:\n\nMy Top 30 UK Indie Rock Albums of the 21st Century (30–21)"
