        "text": "Diverse, quirky, full of subgenres: indie music has something for everyone. From rock to pop, folk to microgenres such as vaporwave and synthwave, indie showcases artists’ creativity and authenticity and has embraced innovation since its earliest days. But what defines music as indie?\n\nWhere Did Indie Come From?\n\nIndie – short for ‘independent music’ – originally referred to music produced and distributed independently from major record labels. But it started out as a cultural movement too, emerging as a reaction against the major labels’ dominance in the 1970s – think of punk, which began in the US in the mid-70s when bands such as the Stooges released records through low-budget record labels. Buzzcocks’ Spiral Scratch EP, released in 1977 is recognised as rock’s first independently-funded and distributed disc. Game-changing indie labels such as Rough Trade, Factory and Mute then emerged on the UK scene.\n\nMainstream music came with its own constraints – how could artists create the music that captured and resonated with their individuality? Affordable recording equipment led to a boom in indie’s DIY ethic, which crossed over into everything from album art to marketing. In the 80s, rising British bands such as New Order and Echo and the Bunnymen embarked on US tours, whilst US indie rockers Sonic Youth, Pixies and Dinosaur Jr all released massive crossover albums.\n\nThe 90s were a golden age for indie music artists, both creatively and commercially – grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins and Soundgarden gained a global profile and spawned the catch-all, indie-related ‘alternative rock’ in the process.\n\nBritpop superstars Oasis, Pulp, Blur and The Verve all hailed from indie backgrounds, with the Creation label launching Oasis, Primal Scream, Super Furry Animals and many more.\n\nIndie’s exponential evoltion came courtesy of the internet and the advent of digital platforms, social media and streaming – Sheffield’s Arctic Monkeys were launched into the stratosphere with their debut album in 2006, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, as their huge fanbase, built through live gigs and MySpace, leapt into action. It sold over 118,000 copies on its first day in the UK: more than the rest of the top 20 combined. From unknown indie band to No. 1 on the singles charts in 6 months – that was the power of the internet in creating one of the biggest-selling indie artists of all time.\n\nNow independent artists could connect directly with their audiences: bypass the gatekeepers, and build a really dedicated fanbase in the process. Whereas it was initially a home for misfits, indie is now definitively a part of the mainstream.\n\nWhat Is the Characteristic of Indie Music?\n\nSome of the defining features of indie music are:\n\nIndependence\n\nDiverse genres\n\nAuthenticity\n\nDIY ethic\n\nInnovation\n\nNot having to answer to corporate record labels means that indie artists maintain control over their music, which is often self-produced, and their image. A combination of unique sounds and genuine lyrics showcase creativity and authenticity in indie music, which has created diverse genres spanning indie rock, indie pop, indie folk and more. Indie’s DIY ethic comes out through everything from distribution to grassroots marketing and community-building via fanzines and online. And indie has always been defined by innovation: pushing music’s boundaries with unconventional sounds and instrumentation and non-conformist attitudes. Indie’s openness to exploration allows artists to challenge the status quo.\n\nThese indie characteristics mean that it’s been a driving force behind important social and cultural movements, provding a platform for marginalised voices and addressing social issues.\n\nLet’s All Meet up in the Year 2000\n\nOver the past two decades, indie music has continued to rise through the ranks of mainstream culture. Indie artists embraced a more lo-fi aesthetic, a reaction against the polished, highly produced sound of mainstream pop. They recorded in small studios – and even their bedrooms. Again, it’s channelling the DIY ethos that’s always underpinned indie music.\n\nGuitar-driven indie fuelled the early 2000s, with The Strokes’ 2001 debut, Is This It influenced by garage rock and post-punk. The White Stripes had a minimalist approach, while Death Cab for Cutie catered for everyone wanting a more introspective, melodic sound. The indie music of the early 2000s certainly influenced pop culture as a whole, from fashion to art and film.\n\nPlatforms like BandCamp, SoundCloud and Spotify have been instrumental in indie artists reaching audiences far beyond their local scenes; artists may take issue with how much money they can make from the streamers, but it’s certainly true that they’ve democratised music distribution and discovery for indie artists – plus, they can connect with and build dedicated fanbases without the need for traditional record label marketing budgets and support.\n\nWho Are Today’s Best Indie Artists?\n\nIndie darlings Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers joined forces to create supergroup boygenius. Their debut EP boygenius was released in 2018, after which they went on hiatus for five years. The trio’s The Record, released last year, racked up six nominations at the Grammys, sweeping three of the categories: Best Rock Performance, Best Rock Song for ‘Not Strong Enough,’ and Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nMitski has made an indelible mark on the indie music scene with her profound lyrics and innovative sound. Born in Japan, her multicultural background is at the core of her work, and she’s known for her ability to meld lyrical depth and honesty with eclectic sounds and styles, blending everything from punk to electronic and folk.\n\nWhen it comes to indie music bands taking the music scene by storm, The Last Dinner Party mean business. The BBC’s Sound of 2024 and Rising Star Brit Award winners brought their gothic glam-rock/baroque pop to Glastonbury this year for an acclaimed set, following the No. 1 success of debut album Prelude to Ecstasy, released in February.\n\nIndie Music for Content"
