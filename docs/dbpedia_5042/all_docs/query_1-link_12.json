        "text": "Inspired by discussions in the \"Bands that never reached their potential\" thread, and the higher interest in new British artists than was apparent before, I thought I'd make this thread as a general discussion point for the British indie/alternative scene.\n\nI'm sure it'll disappear from the front page often, but it's hard to imagine a lot of these bands sustaining their own threads, so maybe this could be a place to discuss artists, post recommendations, and stuff like that?\n\nI guess it can encompass artists in the UK in all of the indie and alternative type genres, and focus on the bands active today and in this decade, as there's plenty of threads dedicated to '90s Britpop and so on.\n\nThat's a shame. They were nice guys, but the second album didn't really build on the first or get much attention.\n\nI think if you want to learn about new bands, NME isn't really the place to look anymore. DIY do a bit of a better job of it, but if you really want to be cutting-edge you need to follow the more blog/magazine hybrid digital titles, which often have bad writing and low quality control (although there's exceptions to that) but do tend to cover the bands at least.\n\nUnfortunately, good journalism about new music simply doesn't pay, so it's mostly produced by hobbyists. That means you either get amateur content (copied-and-pasted press releases, low-quality essays, unqualified critics getting on their soapbox, rambling gig reviews, mistakes everywhere), or good content but in a very low volume (because it's hard for publications to recruit good writers willing to contribute for free regularly, or because people get disheartened by all the effort they put in for a few hundred clicks at best).\n\nA lot of the amateur (sometimes semi-pro) publications below the top tier (the top tier being NME, DIY, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, maybe The Line of Best Fit, and a few others) produce content that's absolutely shocking, but they're there because they've got a team of people that've plugged away at it for years. Others appear and blow them away for quality, but their contributors either move on to the big players, or their small editorial teams burn out, and thus they disappear just as quickly."
