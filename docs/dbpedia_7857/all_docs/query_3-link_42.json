        "text": "The Black Slab (黒の石板, Kuro no Sekiban) was a magic item with the power of generating clothing. It takes the form of a black stone slab the size of a person's head, with various inscriptions old and new etched all over it.[1]\n\nOverview[]\n\nJust like the old and faded fine print etched onto the slab says, the way of using the slab for generating clothes is to first place the needed ingredients around it, before pouring magical power into the magic item to activate the process, after which the ingredients will be magically transformed into the clothing, much like how chefs cook various cuisines based on what ingredients are given. As such, once the logic of the slab is understood, many recipes for generating different and exotic clothes can be concocted.\n\nOriginally the heirloom of a woman engaged to the man in black robes, the slab was coveted by a nobleman who was obsessed with clothes. Through all sorts of crooked manipulation, the nobleman was able to gain ownership of the slab as well as control over its owner, whom he interrogated for the way of using the slab. In the end though, the nobleman never found out how to make clothes with the slab, and accordingly forgot that it even existed.\n\nUnbeknown to anyone else, the owner had secretly laid a curse on the slab, which targets the person who displays the most desire around it while it is used to generate clothing, though only one person at a time can get cursed. The cursed person will begin to desire the opposite of what he/she was desiring at the time of becoming cursed, and over time the opposite desire will turn permanent. The owner then etched the nature of the curse onto the slab in fine print, which Kazuma later speculated was for scaring the nobleman from using the slab if he discovered all the fine print on it, though it was also okay with the owner if the nobleman uses the slab without knowing of the curse and ends up turning into a good person.\n\nA few years afterwards, the man in black robes stole the slab out of the nobleman's mansion along with a gem, and dropped them on the return route Kazuma's party took after a quest so that they will pick them up. When used by Aqua in a test run, the slab generated a set of girl's sleepwear utilising the gem as an ingredient, while also cursing the masochistic Darkness to make her desire sadistic control over others.\n\nWhen the party became suspected of theft and was forced to make clothing able to affect their wearers for the nobleman, the slab was used to generate the requested clothing based on the recipes the man in black robes prepared and dropped off at Wiz's Shop. As part of his strategy to sell ingredients, Vanir also concocted a variety of other recipes for clothes that could either help lift the slab's curses on Kazuma's party, or were part of the clothing requisitions from Axel's inhabitants who heard about the slab's capability.\n\nFollowing the lifting of the curse on Darkness, the slab next cursed Megumin, who had been resentful of her small breasts, into desiring to spread the goodness of flat-chested loli girls. After that curse was lifted too, the slab tried to curse Aqua, at the time longing for somebody to heal her feelings, with the desire to heal the feelings of people other than her through working for them, treating them to bubbly, and giving them massages. But her goddess aura instead rebounded that curse onto Kazuma, making his companions nearly miss the deadline for reverting him to normal.\n\nAfter generating the School Invidia, Idol Superbia, and Sexy Luxuria requested by the nobleman as well as lifting the curse on Kazuma, the party gathered the ingredients listed on the recipe for the Berserk Ira, and placed them in their mansion as bait to catch the man in black robes. However, when they proceeded to generate the latest set of requested clothes for the nobleman, it turned out that the recipe was actually for generating the Armour of Wrath. The Armour began attacking anyone it sees, until Darkness put it on and walked out of the city while enjoying the unbearable pain it caused her to the countryside, where she stripped it off for Megumin to Explode.\n\nIn the confusion, the man in black robes, who had managed to steal the slab from the party, reclaimed the subdued Armour of Wrath, and utilising for ingredients it as well as the other three sets of nobleman-requested clothes he had previously stolen, he used the slab to generate a set of clothes containing all four emotions that can imbue him with enough power to enact his vengeance against the nobleman. However, doing so while displaying his strong desire to kill the nobleman caused him to be cursed by the slab, making him desire protecting the nobleman instead. The generated clothes were subsequently Stolen along with the slab by Kazuma, who sacrificed his life to restrain it by putting it on so that his companions can tear it up.\n\nAfter such an ordeal, the slab's powers ended up being drained to the point only one more clothing generation was possible. Kazuma and his party thus chose to generate a set of clothes corresponding to the situation faced by the main heroine or sub-heroine who was most intimate with Kazuma, before fulfilling their promise with the man in black robes by returning the spent slab to its original owner's family.\n\nClothes[]\n\nThe clothes generated by the Black Slab are not only exotically designed and in quality as best as the ingredients provided allow, but can also be made to affect the feelings of the wearer. However, clothes with overbearing effects, such as those generated from recipes the man in black robes concocted, will cause excruciating pain to wearers who resist it that can possibly turn fatal.\n\nWhen Kazuma generates a set of clothes not curse-related, he will test its effects by asking one of his party members to try it on if the clothes were requested by the nobleman. For those clothes requisitioned by other people, which can have slight differences in design and effect generated depending on whether ingredients for fantasization strengthening were used, he will in addition to his companions also ask Chris, Wiz, Yunyun, or Sena to model them out before delivery.\n\nRequested by the nobleman[]\n\nSchool Invidia\n\nスクール・インウィディア\n\nSchoolgirl uniform with blazer and hat, requested by the nobleman, that makes the wearer envious like when she sees her childhood boyfriend walking with a female friend.\n\nIt is able to move by its own will for displaying envy, and was later stolen from the nobleman to be used as an ingredient.
