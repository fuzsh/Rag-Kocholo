        "text": "The city of Hans Christian Andersen honours its literary background with beautiful bookstores. Get to know all the best literary places in Copenhagen!\n\nPolitikens Boghal – Rådhuspladsen 37\n\nThis bookstore was my favourite store for new books. They have the best collection of translated Danish literature I could find in Copenhagen, and a very good English collection as well. They organise a lot of events, so check their calendar when planning a visit! I also like their collection of literary merchandise: mugs, notebooks, that kind of stuff. It’s a great place to find a gift for a bookish friend!\n\nSecondhand bookstores\n\nCopenhagen has many cool secondhand bookstores, all with cute nooks, corners, dark wood and old books. Most of them have a good collection of English books, so it’s worth to check them out. These are my favourites:\n\nThe Booktrader – Skindergade 23\n\nPaludan Bog & Café – Fiolstræde 10\n\nBooks & Curiosities – Læderstræde 9\n\nThe Royal Library – Søren Kierkegaards Pl. 1\n\nThis building is a beautiful combination of modern and older architecture. Enjoy the view over the water from the staircases in the lobby, or take a peek at the old reading room in the older part of the building. This library is the biggest in Northern Europe and definitely worth the visit.\n\nThe Little Mermaid – Langelinie\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of Copenhagen is a literary one: the statue of the Little Mermaid from the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Prepare for a lot of tourists, but also for a lovely view over the water.\n\nBispebjerk Kirkegård – Frederiksborgvej 125\n\nAt this beautiful graveyard, you can find the grave of Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1944. His book The Fall of the King was named the best book of the 20th century by the Danish people. You can’t find his name on the map the cemetery provides, but if you show them a picture of the grave they’ll recognize it and point you the right way.\n\nBakkehus Museum – Rahbeks Alle 23\n\nThis house used to belong to Kamma and Knud Lyne Rahbek, who played an important role in the Romantic period in Denmark. Not only did they write themselves, but they helped other great Danish writers financially. They were visited by writers like Hans Christian Andersen and Adam Oehlenschläger, who wrote the Danish national anthem. Rahbek’s old study room has a beautiful collection of old books!"
