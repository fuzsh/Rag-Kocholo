        "text": "Cobe and MVRDV win the competition to design Denmark’s new Rock Museum – the Rockmagnet – in Roskilde. The project transforms a former concrete factory into a multifunctional creative hub. Three new volumes will be added on top of the existing halls: The Danish Rock Museum, The Roskilde Festival Folkschool incl. student housing, and the headquarters of the famous Roskilde Rock Festival. They share program in a public creative communal house. The museum with a total of 3.000 m² will be completed as the first phase in 2015."
