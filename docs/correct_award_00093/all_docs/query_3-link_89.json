        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. The first year that Nobel Prizes were awarded was 1901, with six recipients in five categories. The Nobel Prize in Physics was presented \"in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him.\" Who received the Prize?\n\nAnswer: Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen\n\nRöntgen (or Roentgen in English spelling) (1845-1923) made the discovery in November of 1895 while measuring the effects of passing an electrical charge through various types of vacuum tubing. Working with apparatus from Philipp Lenard led to some remarkable observations. Further experimentation led to the postulation that a new kind of ray might be possible.\n\nHe used the moniker \"X-ray\" to describe it as something unknown.\n\n2. Ten years after the inception of the Nobel Prize, this lady received her second award. She won the first along with her husband in 1903 in the field of Physics, and in 1911 she won it for Chemistry. Who was this lady?\n\nAnswer: Marie Curie\n\nIn 1903, Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre shared the Prize with Antoine Henri Becquerel. Becquerel received it \"in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity,\" while the Curies received it \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"\n\n1911 saw Marie Curie receiving the Nobel Prize for Chemistry \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"\n\nSadly, Marie Curie's death in 1934 was of aplastic anemia, which is today believed to have been a direct result of her exposure to radioactive materials over a prolonged period of time.\n\n3. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 did not actually receive the accolade until 1922, as it was determined that none of the nominees that year fulfilled the criteria outlined in Alfred Nobel's will. The statutes allowed for a delay of one year, thus enabling the bestowing of the Prize to this man \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" Who won the prize?\n\nAnswer: Albert Einstein\n\nOver his academic and professional career, Einstein (1879-1955) published over 300 scientific papers, as well as many non-scientific works, largely in the field of philosophy. After emigrating from Nazi Germany in 1933, Einstein eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1940.\n\nPlanck, Stark and Bohr were all Nobel Prize laureates for Physics as well, receiving them in 1918 (Planck), 1919 (Stark), and 1922 (Bohr).\n\n4. The awards speech in 1931 for Otto Heinrich Warburg began \"The discovery for which the Nobel Prize for _______ is to be awarded today concerns intracellular combustion.\" Which category completes the sentence?\n\nAnswer: Physiology or Medicine\n\nSpecifically, Warburg (1883-1970) received the Prize \"for his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme.\"\n\nWarburg was only in his early twenties when in the year 1906 he acquired his doctorate in Chemistry, and only five years later he followed that up with a doctorate in Medicine in 1911. He was appointed to a professorship at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in 1918, and was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Cell Physiology in 1931.\n\nHis discovery \"opened up new ways in the fields of cellular metabolism and cellular respiration. He has shown, among other things, that cancerous cells can live and develop, even in the absence of oxygen.\"\n\n5. Another ten years brings us to 1941. Due to World War II, no Nobel Prizes are awarded over a six year stretch, from 1940 until 1945 inclusive.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nIn actuality, the Nobel Prizes only took a hiatus for three years: 1940 through 1942. That said, the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded over five years from 1939 until 1943, and the recipients in 1938 and 1944 were both international organizations.\n\n6. The 1951 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature went to a Swedish writer \"for the artistic vigour and true independence of mind with which he endeavours in his poetry to find answers to the eternal questions confronting mankind.\" Among his works cited in the presentation speech were \"Ordkonst och bildkonst\" (Verbal Art and Pictorial Art), and \"Onda Sagor\" (Evil Tales). Who won the prize?\n\nAnswer: Pär Fabian Lagerkvist\n\nLagerkvist (1891-1974) wrote poems, plays, essays, stories and novels over a span of nearly sixty years. His arguably most famous work is \"Barabbas\" (1950), which was later adapted for the screen in 1961, and starred Anthony Quinn in the title role.\n\n7. Another decade gone, and a new first for the Nobel Prize. In 1961, Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjöld was the first and only person to receive a Prize posthumously. Hammarskjöld was the United Nations' second Secretary-General, serving from 1953 until his death in 1961. How did this Nobel Peace Prize recipient die?\n\nAnswer: In a plane crash\n\nHammarskjöld (1905-1961) was on the way to attempt to negotiate a cease-fire between the soldiers of the Congolese breakaway state of Katanga and United Nations soldiers. It was during the night of 17th September that the airplane crashed near Ndola in Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia). In the years that followed, three different inquiries were made into the cause of the crash, with no conclusive determination made, other than that foul play was not suspected.\n\nIn 1974, it was decided that no more posthumous Prizes would be given out, so Hammarskjöld's distinction as being the only such recipient will remain as such.\n\n8. A new Nobel Prize category was introduced at the end of the 1960s, and in 1971 the third person to win the Prize was economist Simon Smith Kuznets \"for his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth which has led to new and deepened insight into the economic and social structure and process of development.\" What is the full title of this category?\n\nAnswer: The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\n\nThe Riksbank is Sweden's central bank - founded in 1668 and considered the oldest central bank in the world - and responsible to the Riksdag (parliament) for monetary policy in support of price stability.\n\nSimon Smith Kuznets (1901-1985) was a Russian-born American economist and Professor Emeritus of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. His work \"Economic Growth of Nations\" was published in the spring of 1971, and it was lauded in the Prize presentation speech as having \"led to a new and more profound insight into the economic and social structure and the process of change and development.\"\n\n9. The 1981 recipient for the Nobel Prize in Literature was a Hungarian-born writer whose early life was lived in German-speaking countries (Austria, Switzerland and Germany) and who eventually became a British citizen in 1952. He received the Award \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power.\" Which Antarctic mountain is named after him?\n\nAnswer: Canetti Peak, Tangra Mountains\n\nElias Canetti (1905-1994) wrote almost exclusively in German during his active writing career. Many of his works touched on the tendencies of the masses (crowd psychology) in various societal situations.\n\nMount Saunders was discovered during the British Antarctic Expedition (1907-09) and was named for Edward Saunders, secretary to Ernest Shackleton.\n\nMount Menzies was named for Robert Menzies, former Prime Minister of Australia.\n\nThe namesake for Mount Rees was a geologist from the University of Nevada named Margaret N. Rees.\n\n10. This 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner spent the bulk of twenty years under political house arrest in her home in Rangoon after her political party won the Burmese election in 1990 and the military regime would not cede power. She was finally released on November 13th, 2010. Who is this amazing woman?\n\nAnswer: Aung San Suu Kyi\n\nIn addition to her Nobel Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi (b. 1945) has been awarded the Rafto Prize (human rights), the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding and the International Simón Bolívar Prize (awarded for contributing to the freedom, independence and dignity of peoples and to the strengthening of a new international economic, social and cultural order).\n\nIncidentally, she has also been named an Honorary citizen of Canada; only the fifth person to be so honored.\n\nSource: Author reedy\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor bloomsby before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
