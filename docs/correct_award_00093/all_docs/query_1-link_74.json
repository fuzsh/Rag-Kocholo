        "text": "Frank Morton Carpenter collects a 2.5-foot wing from a dragonfly-like giant insect that lived in Oklahoma during the Permian Period.\n\nRebecca wins Academy Award for best picture. The darkest aspects of the Daphne du Maurier novel were cleaned up a little, but the film was popular then and still remains a fan favorite. Its the only Alfred Hitchcock film to take the top Academy Award.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1945, the desperate need for labor in US defense plants and shipyards leads to the migration of 1.2 million African-Americans from the South to the North and West. This migration transforms American politics as blacks increasingly vote in their new homes and put pressure on Congress to protect civil rights throughout the nation. Their activism lays much of the foundation for the national civil rights movement a decade later.\n\nOn June 25, Pres. Franklin Roosevelt issues Executive Order 8802, which desegregates US defense plants and shipyards and creates the Fair Employment Practices Committee.\n\nThe US Army creates the Tuskegee Air Squadron (the 99th Pursuit Squadron) — an all African-American flying unit.\n\nZuse Z3 machine completed\n\nAnthropologist E. T. Hall excavates the ruins of a dwelling in New Mexico occupied between 700 and 900 AD. He finds two fossil jawbones of Eocene mammals that were deliberately carried to the dwelling by Paleo- Indians.\n\nGerman paleontologist H. Kirchner suggests that dinosaur tracks in the Rhine Valley might have inspired the legend of Siegfried slaying the dragon Fafnir.\n\n07 DEC 1941: Pearl Harbor bombed by Japanese The US immediately declares war on Japan. Germany quickly declares war on the United States. The US is now a full participant in World War II.\n\n08 DEC 1941: The US responds to Pearl Harbor. President to address joint session of Congress. Declaration of War expected.\n\n09 DEC 1941: The United States formally declares War on Japan.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley wins Academy Award for best picture. The drama was set in a Welsh mining village, with director John Ford winning one of the films five Oscars. Even then, many were surprised that the movie beat Orson Welles Citizen Kane, but a Variety reporter at the time attributed that to the 6,000 movie extras who voted on Oscars top prize: The mob prefers a regular guy to a genius.\n\nThe Atanasoff-Berry Computer is completed\n\nKodacolor, the first color film that yields negatives for making chromogenic color prints on paper. Roll films for snapshot cameras only, 35 mm not available until 1958.\n\n4-7 JUN 1942: The Battle of Midway occurs. Less than six months after Pearl Harbor the Japanese navy attempts to lure the remnants of the US Navy into a decisive battle at Midway Island. The Japanese plan backfires, as the battle proves to be a huge victory for US forces and the turning point in the war in the Pacific.\n\nMrs. Miniver wins Academy Award for best picture. The film, about a British family during the early days of World War II, came at just the right time, reassuring Americans that their newish war effort was the right decision.\n\nPainting by Piet Mondrian: Broadway Boogie Woogie was completed in 1943, shortly after Mondrian moved to New York in 1940. Compared to his earlier work, the canvas is divided into a much larger number of squares. Although he spent most of his career creating abstract work, this painting is inspired by clear real-world examples: the city grid of Manhattan, and the Broadway boogie woogie, a type of music Mondrian loved. The painting was bought by the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins for the price of $800 at the Valentine Gallery in New York City, after Martins and Mondrian both exhibited there in 1943. Martins later donated the painting to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nThe Colossus Mark 1 computer is delivered to Bletchley Park\n\nThe First Computing Journal\n\nWork begins on ENIAC\n\nCasablanca wins Academy Award for best picture. The WWII drama represents the studio system at its best, where all the talent (behind and in front of the camera) worked at their peak. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were not the studios first choices for their roles, but they remain one of the screens all-time great romantic pairings.\n\nJohannes Vilhelm Jensen awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style\".\n\nTriptych by Francis Bacon: Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion comprises three canvasses that are based on the Eumenides — or Furies — of Aeschylus's Oresteia, and that depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background. It was executed in oil paint and pastel on Sundeala fibre board and completed within two weeks. The triptych summarises themes explored in Bacon's previous work, including his examination of Picasso's biomorphs and his interpretations of the Crucifixion and the Greek Furies. The Three Studies are generally considered Bacon's first mature piece. When the painting was first exhibited in 1945 it caused a sensation and established him as one of the foremost post-war painters. Remarking on the cultural significance of Three Studies, the critic John Russell observed in 1971 that \"there was painting in England before the Three Studies, and painting after them, and no one ... can confuse the two\".\n\nOn April 3, the United States Supreme Court in Smith vs. Allright declares white-only political primaries unconstitutional.\n\nFirst Harvard Mark 1 shipped\n\nD-Day landing On June 6th, the largest amphibious force ever assembled, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, successfully attacks and establishes a landing on the coast of France at Normandy.\n\nGoing My Way wins Academy Award for best picture. Writer-director Leo McCarey once again proved his ability to balance tears and laughs, in this tale of a rule-breaking priest (Oscar winner Bing Crosby) taking over a New York parish from a retiring priest. In the latter role, Barry Fitzgerald was oddly nominated as both lead and supporting actor, winning in the latter category.\n\n13 APR 1945: President Roosevelt dies in office.\n\nHarry S. Truman becomes thirty-third president of the United States.\n\n28 APR 1945: US and Russian troops meet. Germany split in two.\n\n30 APR 1945: Press reports Mussolini killed by Italian partisans, his body abused. Hitler commits suicide by gunshot while hiding in his Führerbunker, but news of his death will not surface for a few days.\n\n02 MAY 1945: Hitler reported dead..\n\n08 MAY 1945: Germany surrenders unconditionally. The war in Europe is over.\n\n22 JUN 1945: Okinawa falls after 82 days of fierce fighting.\n\n16 JUL 1945: The Manhattan Project yields results — the world's first atomic bomb is secretly tested in New Mexico.\n\n27 JUL 1945: Churchill is defeated in British elections. Potsdam Declaration is reported, calling for Japan to surrender unconditionally or face \"prompt and utter destruction.\"\n\n06 AUG 1945: the first atomic bomb used in combat is dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.\n\n07 AUG 1945: The world learns about the atomic bomb. President Truman announces \"The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East\" and he calls upon Japan to immediately accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration or expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\"\n\n09 AUG 1945: The second atomic bomb used in combat is dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. The primary target for this mission was actually the city of Kokura, but the bomber crew moved on to the secondary target of Nagasaki when Kokura proved to be too obscured by smoke to get a clear view for the bombsight. Russia declares war on japan.\n\n15 AUG 1945: In the afternoon of August 15th (Japanese time), Japan announces its unconditional surrender. World War II is finally over. More than 60 million people have died as a result of the conflict.\n\nGabriela Mistral awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin American world\".\n\nCol. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr, is named commander of Godman Field, Kentucky. He is the first African-American to command a United States military base.\n\nGrace Hopper recorded the first actual computer \"bug\"\n\nPatent is Filed for the Harvard Mark I\n\nVannevar Bush publishes his ideas for MEMEX, a proto-hypertext system and forerunner to the World Wide Web\n\nThe Lost Weekend wins Academy Award for best picture. The film, directed by Billy Wilder, was widely admired even though it was controversial: Though movies had featured drunks since the silent days, it was considered daring to address the subject head-on.\n\nHermann Hesse awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his inspired writings which, while growing in boldness and penetration, exemplify the classical humanitarian ideals and high qualities of style\".\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Morgan vs Virginia, rules that segregation in interstate bus travel is unconstitutional.\n\nAlan Turing Proposal For 'ACE' Automatic Computing Engine\n\nENIAC Unveiled\n\nENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was announced\n\nFrederick Williams Receives Patent for RAM device\n\nAlong the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia, Gulag prisoners discover a nest with three frozen, mummified ground squirrel carcasses. They turn the carcasses over to the Gulag camp geologist, Yuriy Popov, who relays them to other Soviet scientists. Seventy years later, radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis of the ground squirrel mummies will identify their age at over 30,000 years old, and indicate that they are not direct ancestors of modern ground squirrels in the region.\n\nGeologist Reg Sprigg discovers fossils near the Ediacara Hills in Australia. The fossils are of multicellular organisms that predated the Cambrian Period, making them the oldest complex fossils yet discovered. At least some of the fossils are generally assumed to be related to modern cnidarians like jellyfish and corals.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives wins Academy Award for best picture. The world population was just adjusting to life after World War II and some film executives feared that audiences wanted escapism, not a movie reflecting their lives. But it was a huge hit, and its honesty in dealing with civilian changes and vulnerabilities are still powerful. It was produced by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by William Wyler.\n\nAndré Paul Guillaume Gide awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight\".\n\nPainting by Jackson Pollock: Reflections of the Big Dipper, consisting of built up layers of paint with dripped enamel as the final touch, concluding the composition. It was around 1947 that Jackson Pollock traded in his brushes for sticks, trowels and knives and began adding foreign matter, such as sand, broken glass, nails, coins, paint-tube tops and bottle caps to his canvases. Reflection of the Big Dipper was exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1948, along with sixteen other paintings by Jackson Pollock. The show received positive reviews. Pollock's works from this time are a transitional step between a more traditional handling of paint and his revolutionary technique of dripping paint on canvases off a large scale.\n\nOn April 10, Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers becomes the first African-American to play major league baseball in the 20th century.\n\nJ Lyons executives report on the potential of computers to automate clerical work\n\nThe Williams tube won the race for a practical random-access memory\n\nDennis Gabor invents holography.\n\nHarold Edgerton develops the Rapatronic camera for the U.S. government.\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History curator Edwin Colbert finds a massive quarry of Coelophysis dinosaurs in New Mexico and concludes from their skeletons that these Triassic dinosaurs were swift runners with a bird- like posture. Later examination of two fossils will lead Colbert to conclude they were also cannibals, but the \"last meals of juvenile coelophyses\" will eventually prove to be crocodilian.\n\nRudolph Zallinger completes The Age of Reptiles mural in the Yale Peabody Museum. His image of slow-moving dinosaurs will prevail until the 1960s.\n\nGentleman's Agreement wins Academy Award for best picture. The Elia Kazan-directed drama, starring Gregory Peck, was another hot-button winner, as it addressed the topic of anti-Semitism.\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\".\n\nPainting by Barnett Newman: Onement I features the first full incarnation of what Newman later called a 'zip', a vertical band of color. This motif would play a central role in many of his subsequent paintings. The painting's title is an archaic derivation of the word 'atonement', meaning, \"the state of being made into one.\"\n\nOn July 26, Pres. Harry Truman issues Executive Order 9981, directing the desegregation of the armed forces.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Shelley vs Kraemer, rules that racially restrictive covenants are legally unenforceable.\n\nIBM´s Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator was built\n\nThe Manchester Baby, the world's first stored program computer, ran its first program\n\nEdwin H. Land introduces the first Polaroid instant camera.\n\nThe Hasselblad 1600F camera is introduced.\n\nMary Leakey finds the skull of the ape Proconsul, about 16 million years old. Although a very significant find, it does little to bolster Louis and Mary Leakey's meager research funding.\n\nHamlet wins Academy Award for best picture. The black and white Shakespeare adaptation, from U.K.s J. Arthur Rank-Two Cities, was the first non-Hollywood film to take the top award. And Laurence Olivier became the first person to direct himself to a best-actor win."
