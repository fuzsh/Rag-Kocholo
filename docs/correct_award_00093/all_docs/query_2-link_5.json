        "text": "(1873–1950). The Danish novelist, poet, and essayist Johannes Vilhelm Jensen provoked much debate in his later years through his attempt to depict human development in the light of an idealized Darwinian theory. He received the Nobel prize for literature in 1944.\n\nOf old peasant stock and the son of a veterinarian, Jensen was born on Jan. 20, 1873, in Farsø, Denmark. He was sent to Copenhagen to study medicine but turned to writing. He first made an impression as a writer of tales. These works fall into three groups: tales from the Himmerland region of Denmark, tales from Jensen’s travels in the Far East (for which he was called Denmark’s Kipling), and more than 100 tales published under the recurrent title Myter (Myths). His early writings also include a historical trilogy, Kongens Fald (1900–01; The Fall of the King), a fictional biography of King Christian II of Denmark. Shortly thereafter, as a result of his travels in the United States, came his Madame d’Ora (1904) and Hjulet (1905; The Wheel). In 1906 he published a volume of poems, and late in life he returned to poetry, producing Digte, 1901–43 (Poems, 1901–43).\n\nJensen is best known, however, for the six novels that bear the common title Den lange rejse (1908–22; The Long Journey). This story of the rise of humankind from the most primitive times to the voyages of Christopher Columbus exhibits both his imagination and his skill as an amateur anthropologist. Jensen died on Nov. 25, 1950, in Copenhagen."
