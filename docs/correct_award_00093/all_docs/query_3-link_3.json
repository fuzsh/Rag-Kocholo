One of his most famous works is the novel “The Fall of the King” (1900-1901), which is part of his “Kongens Fald” (The Fall of the King) trilogy. This trilogy explores the history of Denmark and its transition from paganism to Christianity.\n\nJensen’s literary works often reflected his interest in history, mythology, and human evolution.
