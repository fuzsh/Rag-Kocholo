        "text": "Johannes V. Jensen (born Jan. 20, 1873, Farsø, Den.—died Nov. 25, 1950, Copenhagen) was a Danish novelist, poet, essayist, and writer of many myths, whose attempt, in his later years, to depict man’s development in the light of an idealized Darwinian theory caused his work to be much debated. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1944.\n\nOf old peasant stock and the son of a veterinarian, Jensen went to Copenhagen to study medicine but turned to writing. He first made an impression as a writer of tales. These works fall into three groups: tales from the Himmerland, tales from Jensen’s travels in the Far East (for which he was called Denmark’s Kipling), and more than 100 tales published under the recurrent title Myter (“Myths”). His early writings also include a historical trilogy, Kongens Fald (1900–01; The Fall of the King, 1933), a fictional biography of King Christian II of Denmark. Shortly thereafter, as a result of his travels in the United States, came his Madame d’Ora (1904) and Hjulet (1905; “The Wheel”). In 1906 he published a volume of poems, and late in life he returned to poetry, his Digte, 1901–43 being the result.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry"
