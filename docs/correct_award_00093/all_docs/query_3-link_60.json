        "text": "Aino Aalto (1894 - 1949) is a famous Finnish architect and designer. She studied architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology, as did her husband, the famous Alvar Aalto. In 1923, she went to work for the office of Gunnar A. Wahlroos in Jyväskylä, then left this position the following year to collaborate with Alvar Aalto.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a long and productive partnership. In 1935, together with Alvar Aalto, Maire Gullichesen and Nils-Gustav Hahl, Aino Aalto founded Artek, an internationally renowned furniture and lighting company. She played an important role in the company and served as general manager for Artek from 1941 to 1949. Aino Alto's career as a furniture and interior designer, architect and photographer is best known for her work in glass. Among her most famous works is the Aino Aalto glassware line, created in 1932 under the name Bölgeblick, which means \"water rings.\"\n\nAndreas Ferdinand Riise Bergsaker (b. 1990) is a Norwegian product designer based in Copenhagen. He graduated with a master degree in Product design from Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences (HiOA), in June 2015.\n\nHis work covers different everyday objects, designed for product longevity and generations to come. His designs are rooted in exploration of material and shape, and referencing cultural heritage with emphasis on traditional craftsmanship, industrial production processes and tactile qualities. His work has led to exhibitions in London, Milan, New York, Oslo and Stockholm\n\nArne Hovmand-Olsen had the world in mind, both before and after the 1950s, when he became one of Denmark's renowned furniture designers. A farmer's son and aesthete by nature, he began as a cabinetmaker's apprentice, before studying furniture design and pursuing his passion for visual composition and furniture design. In 1944, Arne Hovmand-Olsen opened his own design firm, where he combined the details of classic craftsmanship with innovative, modern design. He was a pioneer, not only in the field of architecture, but also in exporting designer furniture to meet the great interest abroad. In consultation with Arne Hovmand-Olsen's family, Warm Nordic continues the legacy of this great furniture designer and will regularly launch other classics from the House of Arne Hovmand-Olsen.\n\nArne Vodder was a leading light of what might be called the “second generation” of forward-thinking 20th-century Danish furniture designers — those who, following in the footsteps of Hans Wegner, Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl and others, first applied the skills, traditions and philosophical tenets of Danish craftsmanship to a modern furniture idiom.\n\nAs a graduate student in architecture trained by Finn Juhl, Vodder made his mark in the 1960s, when modern design had gained wide acceptance, particularly in the business world. Accordingly, many of Vodder’s chairs are quiet in form — projecting an air of sturdiness and strength, rather than avant-garde styling.\n\nVodder’s aesthetic flair was very pronounced in his cabinets and storage pieces — sideboards, bookcases, credenzas and buffets. In such pieces, Vodder liked to play with asymmetry. His bookcases often have a seemingly random array of variously sized shelves and nooks. A typical Vodder sideboard might have four sections, each different in purpose and look: an open stack of vertical shelves, and other cupboards covered with sliding panels in contrasting colored laminates and wood veneers. As you will see from the works on these pages, Arne Vodder had a sense of what kind of design was appropriate for which space: sobriety in the boardroom; playfulness at home.\n\nBent Karlby (1912-1998) was a Danish designer best known for his lighting fixtures: he is considered one of the most prolific and versatile Danish lighting designers of the 20th century. Many of his creations are based on various organic forms that indirect light adorns with details: for example, perforations slightly filter the light to make it warm. Towards the end of his career, however, he also designed several functional lighting fixtures with a strong geometric aesthetic. Bent Karlby worked with the Danish brand LYFA for more than 40 years and is probably best known for the lights he designed for the firm.\n\nHenrik Blum (born 1960, Denmark) and Rune Balle Olesen (born 1957, Denmark).\n\nBlum and Balle are industrial designers educated at the Danish Design School. Balle Olesen is also a qualified silversmith from Georg Jensen. Since 1996 Henrik and Rune have run the design company Blum & Balle. Their work methods are characterized by teamwork comprising several experts, such as technical specialists. At the same time they also find room for workplace specialists and information psychologists.\n\nBlum & Balle designed products and design solutions for danish companies designed tables, chairs.... All of these pieces of furniture are excellent examples of how form and function may be united.\n\nArchitect, designer, moovie director, profesor, Charles Eames creates, in 1930, his own design studio of architecture. With Eero. Saarinen, he wins in 1940, the first prize of design competition of the MODERN ART MUSEUM of NY .\n\nTogether With his wife Ray, they contribute to create an up to date style of furniture, produced byHerman Miller firm , the lounge chair is one of their famoust and extremly confortable chair. They also work together as photographs and moovie directors. Since 1957, Charles & Ray Eames produced their furniture with VITRA firm .\n\nThis mythic couple of designers influenced many generations by their way of life and philosophy and an always up to date design.\n\nIt is the details that distinguish Charlotte Høncke's design.\n\nOne of the great passions of this Danish designer is upholstered furniture,\n\nwhere original seams, a play of colors or a surprising shape arouse our curiosity.\n\nIn Charlotte Høncke's creations, the richness of details coexists.\n\nCoexists with pure forms and lines, while taking functionality into account.\n\nCharlotte Høncke immerses herself in the process of creating exquisite designs for the home,\n\ncapturing a sense of entity, comfort, and a timeless aesthetic, which not only\n\nrecalls history, but also embraces the spirit of our times.\n\nChristian Dell was born in Offenbach am Main in Hesse. He completed the silver forging studies at the academy in 1911 and from 1912-13 he studied at the Saxon college of arts and crafts in Weimar. From 1922 to 1925 he worked as a foreman of the metal workshop at the Bauhaus in Weimar where he was the man behind a highly innovative and pioneering style of design.\n\nAfter World War II, Christian Dell manufactured silver goods and opened a jeweller´s shop in Wiesbaden in 1948, which he operated until 1955. He died in Wiesbaden in 1974.\n\nBorn in London in 1974. He graduated in 1998 from the Department of Product Design at Kingston University, London, with a thesis on \"advanced materials\". He started his activity working on several design projects, collaborating with a few design studios until, in 2004, he founded his design studio based in Stockholm. The office focuses on combining technological research and innovation. His projects are often characterized by a sense of inventiveness and a poetic quality. Since 2005, he has been a guest lecturer in the industrial design course at LTH University in Sweden.\n\n(1889-1965) was known as an uncompromising designer. He viewed quality craftsmanship as the most important element of his work, making it his focus when developing new furniture. Unlike other cabinetmakers, Henningsen always created his own furniture pieces - although his greatest desire was to be recognized as a cabinetmaker and not as a furniture designer.\n\nn his designs, Henningsen was able to capture traditional expressions from other style periods and reinterpret them with a modern and organic flavor. He drew inspiration from earlier styles such as French Empire, Rococo, and British 17th-century furniture, much like one of the other great furniture designers of his day, Kaare Klint.\n\nuring Frits Henningsen's lifetime, Carl Hansen & Son was one of only two furniture producers to be shown such trust.\n\nWith a background of working with several projects in the Swedish film industry, Gunilla enrolled at Konstfack, the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, in 1983, to study interior and furniture design.\n\nGunilla became Lammhults first female designer and her continued work for Lammhults has resulted in a numerous range of furniture design.\n\nThe statement of the jury of the George Jensen prize received in 1996, one of many prestigious awards received, well describes her products. ”… strict, minimalistic and elegant design. The proportions and details of her furniture reveal a genuine sense of quality.”\n\nGunilla´s collaboration with saveral manufacturers, as well as designing kitchens, glassware, lightning and carpets, makes her one of the foremost names in contemporary Scandinavian design.\n\nHelge Sibast (1908-1985) was a Danish cabinetmaker and designer who continued the work of his father Peder Olsen Sibast. Besides a skillful carpenter, Helge Sibast was also a visionary designer, and in the 1950s and 1960s his simple, functional and high-quality designs gained success also outside Denmark, and even made their way to the White House. His best known designs, Sibast chairs No 7 and 8, Helge Sibast designed in 1953. In the 21st century Sibast’s tradition is carried on by Sibast Furniture, which was relaunched in 2012 by Helge Sibast’s grandson and his wife.\n\nISKOS — BERLIN Design is a partnership of Boris Berlin and Aleksej Iskos.\n\nThe company works within the fields of industrial, furniture and graphic design. The firm was only established in late 2010, but Boris and Aleksej have been working together for a number of years. In 1987, Boris co-founded Komplot Design, where Aleksej was employed as an assistant for more than 11 years. This long and fruitful cooperation has allowed them to develop a shared philosophy of design.\n\nJeppe Utzon is a third-generation architect - and fourth-generation designer. He has achieved international acclaim for his work, and the cross-creative DNA comes from no stranger. As the grandson of the famous Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who created the Sydney Opera House, Jeppe Utzon continues a rich family tradition through his work in the art of architecture. He runs a design studio in the centre of Copenhagen, and is doing projects for clients in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The projects are as diverse as private luxury homes in Denmark, eco holiday resorts in Nicaragua, iconic commercial buildings in Shanghai and floating social housing in Bolivia.\n\nWorking by reducing the product to its essence. Using mechanical solutions as the basis for innovative design. That's how he thinks. That's why he gets up in the morning. He wants to come up with clever ideas, not just make something beautiful.\n\nMaster's degree in industrial design engineering, Chalmers, Göteborg, 2005. Studied furniture design at Stenebyskolan in 2002.\n\nNow runs the design studio in Göteborg, Sweden, where he works on furniture and product design projects.\n\nMarkus Johansson graduated in 2011 from HDK (School of Design and Crafts) Goteborg, Sweden.\n\nHis studio is located in Central Goteborg where he specializes in design and the development of design of furniture, product, graphic and lighting.\n\nMarkus works with both Swedish and international design companies and has won numerous awards which also includes his highly acclaimed Nest chair which was exhibited at The Museum of Art and Design, New York.\n\nMarkus explains about his work:\n\n\"We try to find inspiration from various environments stretching from the human to the artefact, through analysing and processes. Our vision is to combine construction, function and form to enrich the everyday experience. Environmental thinking is of course important, but shouldn’t hinder creativity.\"\n\nThe work of Danish architect Mette Schelde (born 1985) ranges from product design to architecture and spatial planning. Rethinking the conventional, her works are sensory and functional. The studio was founded in 2012.\n\nWith a simple, sculptural expression, her creations take shape through an intuitive process that always puts people first. She is constantly exploring new methods and technologies that come and go in a mix of tradition and renewal.\n\nNorwegian designer Mia Hamborg (b.1980), BA in furniture from the Steneby School of Crafts and Design in Gothenburg has a passion for order, functionality, and colour. With her joyous and playful furniture, she continues an old Nordic tradition for wood turning and brings new life into the material. She compliments designer Sir Terence Conran for his acknowledgment that modern people often live with limited space and therefore making storage a design issue. She doesn't follow any strict design tradition, but the joy of life is her inspiration.\n\nThe Swedish architect Nils Strinning (1917-2006) was one of the most prominent designers of the mid-20th century. He was one of those who laid the foundations for what is now known as Scandinavian design. Nils Strinning is the creator of the famous String shelving system, a lightweight shelving system created in the 1940s that is still very popular today. The String system is simple to assemble and the shelves can easily be repositioned.\n\nNorway Says is a company based in Oslo, designing furniture, interiors and products.

Oivind finds great inspiration in nature, particularly in the snail – with regard to both the construction of the snail shell and the slow pace of the snail. In addition, the Fibonacci sequence, fractals, and other basic mathematical principles fascinate him. These sources of inspiration formed the basis for his very first design after getting his degree. For B&O he made the loudspeaker A9, which was introduced in 2012. The same principles have inspired his new series of lamps – the Swirl. The lamps have actually been in progress ever since he completed his studies in 2008, but Øivind has worked intensely on improving and polishing the features. His desire that light, form and function should work together to provide a handsome light experience, while the design of the lamp is quite airy, ties in very well with the Scandinavian tradition. As such, it is in complete harmony with LE KLINT’s collection, which these lamps will now become a part of.\n\nOki Sato, born in 1977 in Toronto, Canada, studied architecture at Waseda University in Tokyo.\n\nHe obtained his Master’s degree in 2002.

The designer takes his inspiration from Japanese uncluttered style to create a language of his time.\n\nThe philosophy of Oki Sato is reflected in his designs, thanks to which he transforms the interactions of people with the objects surrounding them by creating a parenthesis in their life.\n\nThis desire is found in the uncluttered and characteristic shapes of his designs, to which he always adds a touch of humour and conviviality.\n\nOle Gjerløv-Knudsen (1930-2009) was a productive Danish designer best known for his OGK Safari bench and chair, as well as his Modeline collection, designed in collaboration with Tørben Lind.\n\nAfter completing his training as a cabinetmaker, Gjerløv-Knudsen studied furniture design at the Danish School of Art, Craft and Architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.

For him there was no unbridgeable gap between the subjectivity of the fine arts and the objective world of science. He had a rare ability to bring poetry, geometry and design together in a harmonious design, where function and art is weighted equally.\n\nHis superellipse was to solve the double contrast between the circle and the square and that of the ellipse and the rectangle. Piet Hein's superellipse shape was adopted by various Scandinavian industries for use in architectural design, furniture, and household consumer products.\n\nIn addition to his work with the development of the superellipse Piet Hein has executed a great many other design commissions, from board in wood to the elegant Sinus lamp.\n\n\"Art is solution to problems which cannot be formulated clearly before they have been solved\".\n\nPiet Hein\n\nRainer Bachschmid was born in southern Germany on Lake Constance.

His avant-garde spirit has left an indelible mark on the history of design.\n\nRessell designed numerous steel and leather armchairs, sofas, chairs and even a bar (1960). In 1971, he designed the legendary Falcon chair.\n\nRessell was born in 1920 in Norway. He studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Crafts, Art and Industry and graduated in 1947. Sigurd Ressell entered one of his designs in a competition. This was noticed by Niels Vodder, a designer who regularly collaborated with Finn Juhl, a leading figure in design.

Despite the timeliness of his designs on the vintage market, there is a lack of biographical information about the designer and his eponymous manufacturing company.\n\nIt is assumed that Holm Sørensen designed lamps for the well-known Danish lighting manufacturers Fog & Mørup and Lyfa in the 1950s, before establishing his own lighting company, Holm Sørensen A/S to produce and distribute his own designs.\n\nHolm Sørensen's style varies considerably, with designs from the 1950s truly reflecting the mid-century modern lighting style, with clear influences from the De Stijl and Bauhaus movements. His muted floor and table lamps contain the classic tripod base that was popular at the time, referencing designs such as J. A. Busquet's H. Th. Pinocchio Lamp (1954).\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, Holm Sørensen's style changed completely. His designs range from colourful, geometric table and floor lamps to hanging lamps with unfinished brass and copper surfaces. These hanging lamps present Holm Sørensen's interpretation of the brutalist style, which was popular from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. Originally invented by Swedish architect Hans Asplund, the style has been adopted internationally by many iconic designers, including Le Corbusier.\n\nSøren Juul has had a lifelong experience within both design and architecture.

Alken (born 1970) has been recognised as one of Denmark's leading industrial designers of recent years. For over 20 years, he has run the Copenhagen-based design company Format Design. Thanks to his great sense of functionality, Thomas E. Alken's furniture not only makes you sit comfortably, it also makes you feel at home. Like Børge Mogensen and previous FDB furniture designers, he takes the human body and movement as his starting point, so that the furniture reflects the social dimension of the human being. A chair should not only be beautiful, it should also be comfortable.\n\nMedal-receiving, fully qualified Cabinetmaker from Aksel Kjersgaard and Risskov Møbelsnedkeri.\n\nTo work with living material can be challenging.
