These chapters Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters, particularly Science and Intelligence and, Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, are produced selectively. For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates Ivey sta- tistical data found in the .3urvey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased oast. Those pre- viously produced will continue to be available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the orderirg of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. It is coordinated, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Its territory has been an arena of conflict between rival empires temporal and f spiritual �since the dawn of the Christian era. Its people are for the most part descendants of Slavic 1/ tribes that migrated into the Balkan area some 13 or 14 hundred years ago. But prior to December 1918, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was established on the ruins of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires, they were never Joined together in a single state. Centuries of foreign domination and repeated upheaval hav left them deeply divided by differences in religion, nationality, language, political experience, and economic development. (U /OU Yugoslavia's survival as it multinational state has, in fact, been one of the minor miracles of our times. Ever since 1918 the Yugoslays have been wrestling with the difficult problerns of modernizing their backward economy, of protecting themselves against pressures and intrigues horn of the hegemonistic or irredentist aspirations of outside powers and of forging a united nation out of people previously separated �and sometimes set against each other �by geography, historical circumstance, and cultural influence. In none of these areas have they been wholly successful.

It stands outside a great palace built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian nearly 16 hun- dred years ago. The monument was completed during the reign of King Alexander and erected in its present location by the Tito regime. Its subject and setting capture the full sweep of the region's turbulent history and, like the life of the peasant -born Mes- trovic (who worked actively for the creation of a Yugoslav state only to become one of his country's most prominent expatriates), the fierce nationalism which has sometimes united and sometimes divided the Yugoslav peoples.

Of the staggering total of over 1.7 million 'ugoslays Mm perished in tine %�ears from 1941 to 1945, more than half died at the hands of their fellow c�ountr\\nurn.

Stalin, fearful of an adverse reaction in London and Washington, attempted to dissuade Tito from this course of action. But less than 2 years later, the Western allies� impressed with the te�nacit\\ of Partisan resistance activities and increasingly disillusioned with \\1ihtailmic �threw their full suppccrt behind Tito and forced Ding Peter to negotiate an agreement v\\ith the Communist leader that virtually assured file collapse of the� Yugoslav monarc�In. In acc:rdance \\%ith this agreement, it provisional government was established in Belgrade in March 1945. It included three members of King Pete-r's exile regime and fine representatives of prewar political parties. But Tit() and his lieutenants held all the key Posts, and their Partisan movement seas in undispittecl control of the country. Less than 9 months later, carefull\\ managed elections gave 'Tito the popular mandate he needed to legitimize and consolidate his position. The royalist representatives were forced out of the government and placed under house arrest. The mead\\ elected Constituent AssentW\\ promptly abolished the monarch\\. proclaimed the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and on 31 januar\\ 1946 approved a nev\\ constitution patterned closely after the existing Soviet model. Embodying the federal formula which Tito had advanced more than 2 \\ears earlier as the most promising solution to the� problem of ethnic and regional rivalries, the 1946 Constitution established six constituent republics corresponding to traditional divisions of the country (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro, ;;n(I Macedonia) as well as an autonomous province (Vojvuclina) and an autonomous region (Kosovo Metcrhija) within the republic of Serbia. Yugoslavia was, in effect, reborn under Marxist rule. And with this event its people entered it period of rapid change, experimentation, and uncertainty front which they have vet to emerge. Postwar Yugoslavia (S) Yugoslavia came out of World War 11 as much of a Balkan backwater as it had been during the early das:s of Alexander's rule.

Indeed, Yugoslavia was one of the West's m acti.e and brash antagonists during the early days of the cold war. The Soviet Yugoslav honeymoon was shortlived, however. Independent, self- confident, and understandable proud of the fact that they had come to power with little help from the Soviet army, Yugoslavia's Communist leaders reacted sharply to Soviet efforts to gain control over their country's political and economic affairs. Moreover, Belgrade entertained ambitions in the Balkan area which not only clashed with Moscow's own goals but served as a constant source of embarrassment in the Kremlin's dealings :with the Nest. In 1948, Tito's defiant attitude led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Soviet bloc. In the face of mounting Soviet economic, political, and military pressure designed to topple the Tito regime, Belgrade began to seek new ways to popular acceptance, to stimulate economic growth, and to provide for Yugoslavia's security. In late '.949, Yugoslavia espoused its nov well- known policy of nonalignment, thereby opening the way for Western support in times of need while retaining maximum flexibility in the cnnduct of its foreign affairs. Shortly thereafter, Belgrade launched a blistering attack on the Soviet Union's sacred Stalinist systern and announced that Yugoslavia would embark on a \"separate road to socialism,\" one which would relax the harsher aspects of Communist rule and eventualw ic.J to that ultimate, elusive Marxist goal: the withering away of th state. Since setting that course, Yugoslavia has be, an unusual laboratory of statecraft. It is a Communist state in name and theory, but in practice it is i t fully independent country which has rejected most of the \"socialist experience of other states, including the U.S.S.R., and which is deliberately removing its economy from centralized controls and freeing its people from arbitrary authority. Moreover, despite pretensions to it grand design, it is a state whose political, economic, and foreign policies have for more than 20 years reflected mainly improvisation and compromise. Thanks largely to Tito's firm guiding hand, the Yugoslav experiment has so far been relatively successful. The economy, with massive aid from the West, has shed some of the more cumbersome bits of Marxist theory, weathered recurrent crises, and expanded at an impressive rate The country has b -come increasingly industrialized and urbanized, 6 and fewer than half of its people now work on the land. The material well -being of most of the population has been substantially improved. And despite threats and blandishments from opposing power blocs, Yugoslavia has retained its sovereignty and achieved an influence in world affairs far cut of proportion to its size and power. Nevertheless, Belgrade's separate road to socialism has been a rocky one. There has been a persistent conflict �onu which was highlighted but not resolved by the ouster of Tito's conservative and ambitious heir apparent, Aleksandar Rankovic, in 1966 between those who favor greater political and economic liberalization and those %rho feel that the process of decentralization has already gone too far. The regime's failure to reduce the gap between th richer and poorer republics or to otherwise create a generally more egalitarian society has contributed to an undercurrent of discontent, particularly among students and workers. The interplay of governmental reforms, continuing economic prrblems, and a freer political climate has eroded the solidarity and authority of the Yugoslav Communist party (the League of Communists of Yugoslavia �LCY) clad has led to a resurgence of bitter regional and ethnic animosities. Time and time again, Tito has had to bring his awesome personal prestige and authority to bear in order to prevent his innovative ;vstem from breaking down. Against this background, Yugoslavia has moved deep into a difficult new transition period. Tito �who celebrated his Roth birthda. in 1972 �has been living to prepare his country for the day when he will no longer be around to serve as the ultimate arbiter. Since September 1970 he has introduced a sweeping new series of political and economic reforms designed to anchor his system in constitutional law and formal institutions. Shaken by the serious challenge to federal authority which was raised by Croatian leaders in late 1971, he has reorganized the LCY and directed it to redefine its role within the political system. He has called on the army, as it truly nationa' institution, to play an implicitly restraining role in domestic politics and to serve, if necessary, as the ultimate guarantor of federal integrity. And faced with it rapidly changing world scene, he has made repeated adjustments in his country's international course in hopes of .fostering greater unity and prosperity at home and of preserving national security abroad. But for all that Tito has clone, the uncertainties which trouble his countrymen and cloud Yugoslavia's future remain. Tito's political reforms are as yet APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100031 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100031 -1 incomplete and subject to periodic shifts in direct,,n. In any ment they will not be subjected to a true test of their viability until after his departure. Yugoslavia's economy, still moving away from bureaucratic controls and toward a radical decentralization of authority, faces an accumulation of problems. Extremist emigree groups have stepped up subversive and terrorist activities in hopes of exploiting the confusion of the succession period that is to come. And despite Moscow's currently friendly posture, the threat of Soviet meddling in Yugoslavia's internal affairs has not faded away. There are, in fact, too many variables �some domestic, some international �which will bear on the country's course of development to permit confident prediction as to whether or not the postwar Yugoslav experiment will survive more or less intact after Tito leaves the scene. But Yugoslavia's strengths and weaknesses� geographic, sociological, political, and economic �can be cataloged. Its principal problems can be identified. And all these factors can be combined with an analysis of current trends and past performance to yield a rough presuccession balance sheet.

It is frequently, if superficially, characterized as one country having two alphabets, three languages, four religions, five nationalities, and six republics. Its territory, as shown on the Summary Map, is irregular in shape, trending northwest to southeast along the eastern shores of the Ad:iatic Sea with maximum dimensions of about 530 miles in length and approximately 260 miles in width. Bounded by seven countries, Yugoslavia is a land of tiny villages and crowded cities, of superhighways arid horse -drawn carts, and of symphony orchestras arid blood feuds. It is L, land where snow still clings to alpine peaks while surnmer vacationers crowd resorts along the 945 miles of its California -like coastline and on many of its more than 700 islands. In the north, fertile lowlands stretch for some 300 rniles along the Sava and Danube rivers, broken only by low hills. '(these are the Pannonian plains, so called because they occupy the site of the ancient Pannonian Sea which gradually drained away after the Danube carved the famous Iron Gate gorge and thereby opened an outlet to the Black Sea. Here the climate and terrain have favored extensive cultivation and the development of a dense transportation network which traces its beginnings to roads built by the Romans in the first century A.D. But most of Yugoslavia's territory is dominated by mountain ranges and peaks that make overland communication difficult and account for sharp variations in climate. Elevations reach nearly 9,400 feet in the northwest, arid throughout Yugoslavia's rugged highlands forest and scrub covered ridges alternate with narrow steep sided valleys and scattered level basins. The scenery is spectacular, but living is difficult. The karst zone, an area of limestone mountains and plateaus stretching the length of the Adriatic coast and extending about 100 miles inland, is particularly inhospitable. This dry, rough region is cut by meandering gorges, pockmarked by sinkholes aril cracks, and undermined by extensive caverns. Because of limestone's porosity, a lack of water is a problem throughout the area �both on the mainland and on the adjacent coastal islands. Few of the rivers originating in the interior reach the and heavy rains disappear without a trace. Largely barren and unproductive, the harsh terrain of the karst zone still hampers efforts to overcome the isolation and backwardness of many of its inhabitants. The natural corridors through Yugoslavia's mountain ranges provided by major river valleys have played an important role in the country's history. But these are fey in number, and while there Lire some additional �and tortuous routes which cross the western mountains over high passes, most of Yugoslavia's upland country remains relat:. iaccessible. Development of this extensive regv is further hindered by the fact that devastating earthquakes have caused considerable destruction there in the past and pose a constant threat to life and to costly engineering projects. Nevertheless, the highlands are economically impo:tant because of their resource base. Much of the country's mineral wealth is mined along the faults which crisscross the area. Heavy forests which cover the upper slopes of hills arid mountains almost evervwhere but in the dry western zone support a well developed woodworking industry. And in the nonforested areas, meadow and alpine grasses provide pasturage for grazing. For a country of its size, Yugoslavia possesses a relatively large and varied array of natural resources. It ranks among Europe's leading producers of antimony, chromium, bauxite, mercury lead, and zinc. Iron and copper ores are also abundant, as are reserves of brown coal. Both oil and natural gas exist in exploitable quantities. 'rhe country's wiuely dispersed mineral resources also include substantial deposits of rock salt, calcium rock, and sulfur as well as smaller quantities of gold, silver, molybdenum, wolfw.i\" cobalt, and uranium. Its forest resources are ample, and its hydroelectric power potential is considerable. Yugoslavia's location, its difficult terrain, and the uneven distribution of its natural resources have all contributed to the diversity of its people. Little is known, however, of the original inhabitants of the area� principally Illyrians. They came under Greek influence in the fifth centu: v B.C. arid were incorporated into the Roman Empire some 500 years later. When Slavic tribes began pushing into the Balkans from beyond the Carpathians in the sixth and seventh centuries A.D., many Illyrians were killed or absorbed by the newcomers while others fled to the mountains and coastlands. The Albanians are believed to be descendents of the latter group. Ar d there are still some Vlachs, descendents of Romam..ed Illyrians who never adopted the Slavonic language, living as nomadic herdsmen in the mountains of Macedonia.

When the Slays arrived in the Balkans, they encountered a frontier that was to play a critical role in their future development. 1t ran from the Danube and the Sava in the Pannonian plains down the Drina river and thence across a mountainous corner of what is now Montenegn, ,o a point of the Adriatic coast not far from the current Albanian border. Emperor Theodosius, who drew this line in A.D. 395, thought that he was simply splitting 'lie Rowan Empire in half to stop his two sons front quarrelling. Yet for almost 1,600 nears it has served as a cultural, religious, linguistic, and at times political boundary between the Latin Catholic west and the Greek Orthodox east. Those South Slav groups that settled west of Theo dosius' line �the Slovenes and the Croats �fell under the influence of the Holy Roman Empire and its successor, the Habsburg empire. They adopted the Latin alphabet, the Roman Catholic religion, and a Western political outlook. 'Those Slays who settled east of the line� today's Serbs, Montenegrins, Bulgarians, and Macedonians �took their Orthodox version of Christianity, their C\\ rillic alphabet, in(] their political traditions from Byzantium. Then, following the Turkish victory over the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo in 1369, they had to endure five centuries of life under the Ottoman Empire �a disastrous experience which the Montenegrins (secure in their mountain redoubt), most Croats, and all Slovenes were spared. One legacy of' this period of 'Turkish rude is the million- strong Yugoslav Muslim communit\\ in Bosnia and 1 1ereegovina. Others include the general backwardness of much of southern Yugoslavia and the emergence of an Albanian ethnic majority in Serbia's hallowed Kosovo region. Thus, despite the common ancestry shared by the majority of its population, history and geography have combined to give Yugoslavia the most complex ethnic composition of any country in Europe. There are five main Slav \"nations Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, and Montenegrins �and a number of substantial non -Slav minorities or \"national groups,\" of which Albanians and the Hungarians are the largest. According to the last official survey �taken in 1973 �a little over 12% of the people profess no religious belief, 42ii are Serbian Orthodox, 32% are Boman Catholic, 12% are Muslim, and slightly less than 2`i are Protestants.

All other functions and responsibilities together with control of the bulk of the nation's material resources �have been or are soon to be surrendered to the republics and province,. The process of decentralization is to go much further than this, however. Tito's blueprint calls for the exercise of considerable autonomy backed by adequate independent financial resources �at the lowest level of local government, the commune. A new set of constitutional amendments giving effect to this principle is scheduled to be introduced in 1973. Plans are also afoot for cornpletely revamping the legislative system. Increased efficiency is not the only objective of these projected changes. \"Tito must reckon with the fact that while organized pluralism �the participation of regional organs, federal bodies, and various interest groups (youth, labor, professional, and economic) in Hie process c_: government �has become an indispensible element in the self- management ethic, it has combined with the gradual liberalization of the Yugoslav political climate to release centrifugal forces which could paralyze the country's federal system. I lence he hopes that the proliferation and realignment of decisionmaking centers will complement the other steps he has taken to contain these forces, to dilute the power of the republics, and to blur current regional and national disputes. Indeed, determined to avoid a crisis of succession, \"Tito has undertaken a radical overhaul of his country's entire political structure.. He has created collective executive bodies in both the party and government (the LCY's eight -man Executive Bureau and the 23- rnan Presidency) as heirs to his enormous personal power. He has staffed these bodies (in which genuine debate and give -and -take have become a standard part of the decisionmaking process) Nvith outstanding republican leaders in hopes shat by bringing the \"barons' to Belgrade �and by holstering the power of the collective presidency in relation to Yugoslavia's Federal Assembly �he will haute the interrepuhlic squabbling which reached such alarming proportions in 1971. In addition, he has streamlined the Federal Executive Council and established a number of interrepuhlic coordinating commissions charged with resolving disputes before they reach a point where they 12 must be referred to the collective Presidency for decision. To supplement these moves, Tito has sought enachnent of an Wray of additional statutory safeguards designed both to restrain personal ambitions and to contain regional rivalries. The kcy elements in this program include rotation of all major party and government assignments at 2- to .3 -year intervals, equal rel resentation for the republics in certain important bodies, and an almost check -and- balance division of authority both within and outside the governmental structure. 'The trouble with all this is that the system which Tito is creating is so complicated and cumbersome that it could easily break clown. In fact, Nvere it not for the sobering shock of the dramatic resurgence of Croatian chauvinism in late 1971, it might not be functioning as well as it is right down. Market socialism (C) The rudiments of Yugoslavia's current economic system were established in the years immediate]\\ following the country's expulsion from the Soviet bloc. During the period from 1950 to 1955, the means of production were transferred from state to \"social\" ownership, workers' management councils were established in all enterprises. agricultural collectivization was abandoned, the economic ministries and the state monopoly over foreign trade were abolished, state financing of investments was reduced, and obligatory state plans were replaced by far less detailed \"indicative planning.\" Since then, a series of major reforms �in 1961, 1965, 1967, and 1971 �have moved the economy ever closer to what has been termed, for lack of precedent, market socialism. As in the political field, decentralization has been the key element in Belgrade's approach to the management of the economy. By giving local administrations, individual firms, and� through workers councils �the workers themselves greater authority over their own affairs, and by providing them with a growing opportunity to reap the rev ails of their own enterprise, the regime hopes to promote efficiency, modernization, and long -term growth. It also hopes to make Yugoslav products competitive in world markets. Thus, while federal authorities are still charged with maintaining and regulating an integrated market and Nvith channeling money to the country's poorer regions, their direct role in the econony has been considerably reduced. Decisions on incomes, output, investment, and oreign trade are no-.\\ left largely in the hands of hanks and enterprises.

'I'll(! Yugoslays are probably no more prone than other peoples to act out of loft' principle when issues get close to home and affect important national interests; nevertheless, their behavior has generally been consistent with the professed objectives of nonalignment. Their independent assess�nent of various international developments has often led them to adopt positions close to thc.s, of Moscow �and there have been periods when Soviet- Yugoslav relations have been relatively warm. Sometimes, indeed, the Yugoslays have seemed all too ready to give the Kremlin the benefit of the doubt. But Belgrade has not hesitated to stand in open opposition to Soviet efforts to consolidate their hegemony in Eastern Europe or to expand their influence in the Mediterranean area. Tito's outspoken criticism of Moscow's behavior, coupled with his refusal to abandon his heretical domestic course, resulted in major Soviet economic sanctions in 1956 and in threats of even more tiire punishment some 10 years later. Similarly, Yugoslavia's actions in support of various national liberation movements, its condemnation of all alleged manifestations of imperiali.iin and neocolonialism, and its critical appraisal of \"reactionary\" developments in the W st have at one time or another sorely tried the patience of most of its important trading partners and creditors in NATO. Tito has sought to reduce the risks involved in his assertive foreign police posture by stressing his country's dedication to the concept of peaceful coexistence and its consequent desire to avoid letting occasional quarrels with Communist or non- Communist states seriously disrupt established diplomatic and economic ties. (Yugoslavia's action in breaking off relations with Israel in the wake of the 1967 Arab- Israeli war was a notable exception in the latter regard. But Belgrade's parallel efforts to bolster Yugoslavia's precarious position by developing and dominating a worldwide movement of nonaligned nations have fallen short of their mark. In terms of prestige, of course, the roN%ards of Yugoslavia's diplomatic offensive in the 'Third World have been enormous. And there have been other, more tangible gains as well. For example, the� First nonaligned sutnntit �held in Belgrade in September 14 1961� inspired tit(- subsv(pient formation of it broad, economically oriented grouping of underdeveloped countries (both aligned and nonaligned), the so- called \"77.\" This group, now numerically stronger than its narne indicates, was the prim(- mover in the� formation of the United Nations Conference for 'Trade and Development (UN( �rAD) and continues to yield Yugoslavia Borne economic and political benefits. But the hoped -for vast markets for Yugoslav goods in the )'bird World have failed to materialize. vlor. over, when the notwiigned chiefs of state gathered in Cairo in 196.1 for their second meeting, they were already badly divided by local issues and the impact of the sharpening Sino- soviet dispute. Since then, the nonaligned movement has grown in numbers, but not in cohesion. Most of its founding members have died or been deposed. In recent years, Yugoslavia's principal nonaligned partners, Egypt and India, have become more dependent on Soviet support than Belgrade would like. Not only did New Delhi and Cairo fail to join )'ugoslaviu in condemning the Soviet -led invasion of Czechoslovakia (ana the so- ca;led Brezhnev Doctrine) but the Indian and Egyptian regimes subsequently violated Belgrade's perception of nonalignment by concluding treaties of friendship acrd cooperation with Moscow. Disillusioned, the Yugoslays have begun to focus their foreign policy effort on matters closer to home �on the rapidly changing political and economic scene in Europe and on the strate,cally important Mediterranean Urea �and oil fostering their promis ng ne%y rapprochement with Peking. While it has nc t retreated from its established position of censure with respect to the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Belgrade has welcomed and encouraged a thaw in its relations with the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies. Taking advantage of the general relaxation of tensions in Europe, the Yugoslays have redoubled their efforts to find ways of circumventing discriminatory trade arrangements iu both Fast and West. At tit(- lime time, they have lost It() opportunity to remind both Washington and Mos- cow of the necessity of taking the vicys of small na- tions into account in any nerves aimed ii reshaping the existing political, military, and economic situation in aBv tnid- 19117, the fall of such Third World leaders as Sukarno and Nkrutnah, coupled with a deterioration in Yugoslav relations with Italy, the coup in Greece, and �mast of all �the Arab Israeli ssar, had led 'Tito to postulate the existence of an American -led conspiracy against all \"progressive\" states.

Thus they have emphasized their continued support of efforts aimed at an early convocation of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) within a broad nonbloc framework, and they have also shown active interest in proposals for organizing; an em ally extrabloc conference of Mediterranean countries. The shift in Belgrade's policy has been one of emphasis, not substance. Yugoslavia remains an active and influential member of the still largely Afro -Asian nonaligned grouping. But its muted performance at the most recent nonaligned gatherings �tl.e v r 1 Lusaka summit meeting and the 1972 conference of foreign ministers i �.:,uyana� stands in sharp contrast to the vigorous leadership it exerted in earlier years. All- people's defense (S) Belgrade has traditionally sought to give the impression that an invading force, no matter ho%N strong or from what quarter, would meet .vith fierce resistance and, even if initially successful, would encounter prolonged and costly partisan warfare. In keeping with this strategy, a ith an eye to bringing the conduct of military affairs into closer harmony with the concept of decentralizat'on, Belgrade began to consider plans for the development of sizable territorial forces and for increased emphasis on guerrilla warfare in 1967. Originally drafted on the assumption that Yugoslavia's defenses should be directed primarily against it possible attack from the West, these plans were hastily reoriented following the Soviet -led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August I968. By November of that year, they had been incorporated into it draft bill 6)r consideration by the Federal Assembly, and on I1 February 1969 Yugoslavia's new Nationwide (or \"all- people's I)efense Law was officially adopted. Under the new law, Yugoslavia has established a two- tiered defense system composed of its regular armed forces (presently totaling about 229,000 rnen and collectively designated as the Yugoslav National Armv �JNA) arid territorial defense units. Only the latter force (no%y said to consist of more than I million armed citizens) and the larger complementary civil defense organization are decentralized, with republican, local, arid factory authorities given primary responsibility for the levy, training, funding, and activation of the component units. Rftgional planning, supervkion, and coordination fall to the republics, but overall strategy and control remain in the hands of the Presidency and desig �tted mili- tary organs in Belgrade. Yugoslavia's defensive posture is now more clearly zinc] openly based than ever before on the practical and deterrent aspects of the concept of a \"nation in arms.\" Almost everyone between the ages of 16 and 65 is required to undergo training in military tactics, first aid, use of weapons, and the strategy of collective defense. Of these, men from 17 to 60 and women from 19 to 50 may be assigned to armed units. If attack comes, plan, call for a temporary forward defense by the centrally controlled and more heavily armed regular forces (assisted, where possible, by the activities of local territorial units), followed by the orderly and fighting retreat of these forces into the mountains. Theoretically, the time gained would suffice to transport enough government personnel and records into mountain redoubts to mobilize many of the country's more than 2 million reservists and to activate additional territorial partisan units. And once settled in the mountains, the retreating regular forces would cooperate with partisan units in continued operations against the invader. Impll.mentation of the new defense law has not been without its p oblems, but Belgrade has demonstrated its determination to strengthen the effectiveness of the nationwide system. It has donated a considerable quantity of military equipment, mostly light arms, to the program. It has rearranged its military districts in order to facilitate cooperation between local JNA commanders and their counterparts in the territorial forces. It has tested the system in a number of military exercises, including one, in the fall of 1971, larger than any staged on Yugoslav territory since the height of the Stalinist threat in the early 1950's. In addition, language was included in tl.e 1971 constitutional amendments which declares that no one has the right to sign or recognize the surrender, or occupation, of all or any part of Yugoslavia or to prevent Yugoslav citizens from taking up arms against an invader. Such acts would be punishable as treason. 15 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100031 -1 Kry wlA F c I.

But serious problems� including ethnic and regional rivalries, economic instabilit\\, and foreign meddling �still plague the country and still continue to do so for years to come. Since many of these problems are clo,ely interrelated, their reso- lution is likely to prove more difficult. Yugoslavia's economic difficulties. for example, both contribute to and are compounded by its complex nationalities problems. U OU The nationalities (C) No nation in Europe is more burdened with deep rooted ethnic hatreds than is Yugoslavia. historically, political assassination and civil war have suggested that no regime in Belgrade can long maintain effective national unit-, solely through authoritarian means. But current efforts to solve the country's problems through decentralization of authority and the creation of it relatively open society are by no means assured of success either. ri to S leadership and the sheer force of his personality and prestige kept the problem of ethnic animosities at hay throughout most of the postwar period. In recent gars, however, envy and distrust horn of the growin; disparities in regional levels of economic development have reinforced old feuds and suspicions and, in the freer p;nitic l climate whi( h has accompanied Tito's reforms, have resulted in it marked resurgence of regional and ethnic self assertiveness. In trying to cope with this plienotnenoti, party and government leaders have sometimes gotten s\\vept up in it, becoming partisans on one side or the other. The situation reached crisis proportions in late 1971 when central party and government organs proved incapabie of reining in the rationalist- infested Croatian leadership. \"Tito had to inte personally to set things straight. Before the dust settled, more than W) Croats had lost their jobs and the most ouh�poken nationalists among them had been remanded for trial. With the Groats at least temporarily in hand, Ti:o has moved against regional chauvinists throughout Yugoslavia. 1 ?ven so, the situation remains potentially explosive. As in the past, the three most volatile elements are the traditional animosity between Serb and Croat, the struggle of the Albanians in Kosovo to free themselves of Serb domination, and the conflicting interests of he poorer and richer regions. None of tovse problems is likely to be soon resolved. The government now admits that its program of channeling investment funds to backward areas will require a considerable gestation period before it produces results. The Serbs will continue to chafe at the erosion of their traditional status and prerogatives entailed in the ongoing process of decentralization. They are likely to be particularly reluctant to grant further autonomy to Kosovo �or even to live tip to the spirit of current constitutional provisions pertaining to the status and rights of that province. As a result, the Albanians will probably continue to regard themselves as a repressed minority and may again (as they did in 1963) resort to large -scale disorders. For their part, the Croats �still smarting from the purge imposed upon therm by Belgrade �arc likely to remain especially sensitive to any real or imagined injury to their political or economic interests for a long time to come. The party and the army (S) Tito's plans for pressing forward with political and economic decentralization called for the hurden of maintaining nation;-!, unit\\� to fall squarely on the shoulders of the federal organs of the LCY. And it was here that his system broke down in 1971. In the charged atmosphere of frank mid open political discussion which surrounded the preparations for Yugoslavia's latest round of reforms, regional nationalism flared and split the rinks of the party. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the LCY became something approaching it federation of nine relatively autonomous party organizations: six republican plus �on a slightly lower plane�two provincial and the military. By late 1971, the Croatian party had virtually ceased to communicate witi: the central LCY organs in Belgrade. Beginning with tile: stern measures he employed against the errant Croats, \"Tito has moved to dispel all thoughts of a federalized party and to restore rigid party discipline. Among other developments, the Executive Bureau has announced that henceforth it will send out \"teams\" to monitor the activities of local republican, provincial, and military party units. But the LCY remains in disarray. Confusion has been heightened by Tito's highhanded circumvention of the system he himself had built, as well as by his failure to set forth any clear -cut directives regarding the party's futu.t role. In addition, Tito's tough tactics have revived the old controversy between party Iibera's and conservatives, and many liberal 17 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100031 -1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200100031 -1 leaders including Serbia's competent former party chief Marko Nikezic �have expressed grave reservations about the current drive to recentralizc the IA 1'. Tito patience with his liberal critics apparently ran out in October 1972. Late that month, Nikezic and his second in command within the Serbian party, Latinka Perovic, were forced to resign. Within 30 days the President of the Assembly, Belgrade's party boss, the premier of Slovenia, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, the secretary of the Macedonian party, and three prominent editors followed him into retirement. Further purges seem inevitable. It seems likely that \"Tito's vie will ultimately prevail, but the LCY could well enw.ge from its current troubles as a thoroughly demoralized and relatively ineffective organization. If so, the army may temporarily hold the key to Yugoslavia's future. The jNA remains a highly centralized organization �Fhe only true national institution left in Yugoslavia. Like the party, it has been a mainstay of the regirne. But, unlike the party, it long remained outside the mainstream of developments in Yugoslav society. In recent years, however, Belgrade has sought to revamp the traditionally aloof military establishment and to encourage it to take a more active interest in domestic affairs. To these ends, changes were made which rid the JNA of its most conservative officers, restructured and rejuvenated its part\\ organization, and gave it broader representation in policymaking councils. All this has been reflected in it marked change in the general attitude prevailing in top military circles. A new interest in the resolution of political, social, and economic problems affecting the country's unity (and thus hearing on military capabilities) has emerged. And, although the military establishment's general loyalty to Tito has never been seriously questioned, ranking military officials now stress that this loyalty extends to Tito's systenu as well. At the height of the Croatian crisis, 'Tito sought and received unreserved military hacking for his move against the nationalist leadership in Zagreb. Since then he has emphasized his desire that the military establishment continue to exert it restraining influence c�n fractious local part\\ and government leaders. But while amply justified under Yugoslavia's current circumstances, this open invitation to the military to take it greater hand in civilian affairs carries certain risks of its own. It dramatizes Yugoslavia's domestic problems, adding to the general malaise at horns and encouraging efforts to neddle from abroad. Moreover, despite Belgrade's efforts to achieve it better ethnic balance within the JNA and to give the military 18 establishment a more progressive cast, Serbs and Montenegrins are still strongly over represented at the NCO and cornpany officer level and a nunher of top military leaders still tend toward it conservative position on the scope and pace of Yugoslavia's reforms. Hence the prospect of a more active military role in domestic politics could increase tensions in the! northern republics. Furthermore, while none of Yugoslavia's present military leaders seem to entertain political ambitions, there is always a chance that their taste for power could grow with experience. The economv (C) Yugoslav economic performance in the first half of 1972 was considerably better than in 1971. Improvement was most marked in the field of foreign trade where Belgrade's success in resiricting imports and, thanks to two devaluations of the dinar in 1971, in stimulating exports raised hopes albeit perhaps prematurely �that the country might register a modest current account surplus for the first time in 7 years. (In 1971, it ended up with a US$32.1 million deficit. But despite encouraging statistics and the welcome boost provided by some $500 million in new ,conom;c assistance from the West and by two large investment credits (one for $130 million, the other for 5! -3 billion) obtained from the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav economy remains deeply troubled. Although more than 750,000 workers have left the country to seek jobs abroad, domestic unemployment still stands at record levels. Import controls are now beginning to affect raw material supplies, thereby contributing to a general slowing of industrial growth and threatening efforts to create new jobs and to expand exports. In an atmosphere still marked by sharp regional rivalries, the government's attempts to stabilize the inflation ridden domestic economy have been severeiv hampered by the further decentralization of authority embodied in the 1971 reforms. Despite an extended freeze, consumer prices were rising at more than double the planned rate as 1972 drew to it close. The cost of living, fueled in part by a midyear 16 increase in food prices, was continuing to rise sharply. And Belgrade's efforts to control the money supply and personal incomes were still being opposed by the republics and the trade unions. At the same time, implementation of some of the recent economic reforms has been delayed by a lack of consensus on basic goals and by foot drugging at the republic level. Creation of a domestic foreign exchange market, for example, which had been slated for mid -1972, was postponed for at least 6 months.

Problems such as these promise to plague Yugoslavia for a long tittle to come. Neither the government's controversial stabilization program nor the most re cent round of decentralizing reforms attack the basic causes of Yugoslavia's economic instability. Even if Belgrade succeeds in muting regional rivalries, its complex and cumbersome ec�ononic system will be difficult to control. Unless the Yugoslays call restructure production to increase output of goods exportable to the west, their balance of pad tents will again be severely strained when heavv loan repay items are resurne�d in the mid 1970'x. And unless Belgrade opts permanently for an industrial growth rate considerably lower than its current Vi to I()o7j target, one 11111dest enough to keep both inflation and imports in check, the 1 110011\" and bust pattern of the 1960's is likely to be repeated throughout the 1970'x. External influences (C) In any event, Yugoslavia's Motion)ic �and perhaps political� fortimes will continue to depend to some degree on external factors over %hich Belgrade call exercise bolt limited control. As ill the past, Belgrade's mi .nbership in the World Bank and the International `lonetarc Fund and its active participation in variuns progranns administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are likely to yield both financial and tec�hnic�al assistance. But the situation with regard to Yugoslavia's principal foreign trade partners is more prjhlenutic�al. The Yugoslays htrye long been worried about the hardening East \\Vest ec�ononnic� division of Europe In order to protect themselves, they obtained observer status in the Council for Eco11011tic� Mtttual Assistance (CEMA) in 196 -I, became a full member of GATT in 1967, and negotiated a 3 -year trade agreement syith the Common Market in 1970. However, the recent expansion of the Common Market has raised nes\\ eluestiotts as to whether the Yugoslays will be +ble to rnai;ttain a high level of exports to the Nest, .rod thus accounts in part for Belgrade's interest in increasing trade and economic cooperatio't with the S ('pion and the other wennbers of EXIA.

Although most welcome, Moscow's generous response to Yugoslav reyuc�sts for credit draws attention to another problem That is likely to plague Belgrade throughout the succession period: foreign intervention in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. The Soviets will not he the only culprits, and the threat from the� Kremlin is not all immediate one. But even though 'Moscow has learned to live with �and even grudging1v accept 'fitcrist heres\\, the Soviets have clearly not abandoned hopes cf someday guiding the Yugoslays hack onto a more orthodox path. \"Thus the Kremlin has used the recent improvement in its relations with Belgrade to maneuver for a position of influence ill post -Tito Yugoslavia. In return for their latest investnte�nt credits, the Soviets obtained direct access to local enterprises, thereby joining the west in bcirg aiiomed io bypass fecicri authorities and to bargain directly with individual firms. The risk of such all arrangement to Yugoslav political independence is negligible in the near term. At present, some 70% of Belgrade's trade is with the non Communist world. Moreover. in recent years the Yugoslays have sought and received more than USS2.5 billio: in credits from the Nest. Over the long rum, however, the Soviets are likely to gain both valcuble local contacts and an added increment of economic leverage stemming from the� importance of their assistance to Belgrade's program for promoting the development of Yugoslavia's poorer regions.
