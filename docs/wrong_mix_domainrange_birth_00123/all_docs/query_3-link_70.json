        "text": "Rep. Ron Paul’s apologists want to dismiss the importance of the racist newsletters that were published for years under his name, as if they were some minor part of the congressman’s career, but in reality, they played a crucial role in keeping him politically active when he was out of office and back practicing medicine.\n\nPaul was first elected to Congress in 1976, serving four terms before deciding to run for Senate in 1984, losing in the primary to Phil Graham. Paul re-entered politics twice more. In 1988, when he ran for president as a Libertarian, and 1996, when he ran for Congress again. He’s served ever since winning that 1996 race.\n\nIn the past week, Andrew Kaczynski has brought three old videos to light showing Ron Paul plugging his newsletters. The videos have been used, primarily, to demonstrate that Paul was much more aware of the newsletters than he’s letting on, but there’s another reason why they’re significant. They all came as he was gearing up to re-enter politics. And in each of the videos — one from 1987 and two from 1995 (here and here) — Paul notes that he’s been working as a physician in private practice, but also explains that he’s remained politically active through the newsletters.\n\n“I was always very active in both politics and my profession,” he said in a 1995 C-SPAN interview. “When I came back, I resumed my medical practice, and I’ve been doing that ever since, but I’ve also stayed active in education…But along with that, I also put out a political type of business investment newsletter that sort of covered all these areas. And it covered a lot about what was going on in Washington, and financial events, and especially some of the monetary events.”\n\nPaul also has a similar line in another interview from 1995, which I posted below. So the newsletters were a central part of his pitch that he’s remained interested in politics despite being out of office.\n\nBut that’s not all. As Dave Weigel and Julian Sanchez reported for Reason magazine in 2008:\n\nThe newsletters, in other words, were a crucial part of Paul’s career. He profited from them both personally and politically, so he should be held accountable for them as a presidential candidate."
