        "text": "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson’s speech on the first night of the 2024 Republican National Convention was not the speech he intended to deliver.\n\nJohnson provided PBS News with the text of the speech he said he wanted to give on Monday.\n\nRead the full speech below.\n\nJohnson told PBS News Hour co-anchors Amna Nawaz and Geoff Bennett that he had rewritten his speech in the wake of the assassination attempt against former\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\nWATCH: Sen. Ron Johnson speaks at 2024 Republican National Convention\n\n“They literally loaded the wrong speech” on the teleprompter, Johnson told PBS News.\n\nRead Senator Ron Johnson’s speech:\n\nWelcome to Wisconsin!\n\nWe meet at a somber moment in history. We should all heed President Trump’s call for unity, strength, and determination.\n\n170 years ago, the Republican Party was born here, founded on the principle of freedom and dedicated to the fight to end slavery.\n\nIt’s an honor and privilege to represent the good, decent, hardworking, and very nice people of Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate.\n\nLike most Americans, they believe the purpose of government is to help improve lives, not make them more difficult. Unfortunately, President Biden and Vice President Harris have made our lives less safe and far more expensive – in other words, a lot MORE difficult.\n\nBack in 2008, Joe Biden ran on a ticket promising to “fundamentally transform America.” They weren’t joking. That was the Democrats’ new, radical, far left mission.\n\nToday’s Democrat party is not the party of our parents and grandparents. That party cared about workers and people struggling to get by.\n\nNow they are the party of open borders, reckless spending, and weakness on the world stage. Their fringe agenda includes biological males competing against girls and the sexualization and indoctrination of our children.\n\nDemocrats have forgotten American families.\n\nThey have abandoned the hard-working middle class.\n\nBut with President Trump and Republicans, those forgotten Americans are forgotten no more.\n\nRepublicans are the party of opportunity, liberty, and prosperity for all.\n\nWe proved we know how to make life better for all Americans, and we can do it again—with a secure border, smaller government, less regulation and lower taxes.\n\nRepublicans understand that Americans don’t want welfare, they want work.\n\nThey don’t want woke “equity;” they want God-given equality.\n\nThey want the promise of our founding documents: The right to pursue happiness.\n\nThat’s what Republicans will deliver.\n\nWe’ve repaired the damage caused by Democrats before, and we will do it again. We will complete the mission President Trump first articulated in 2016.\n\nTo Make America Great Again!!!\n\nMore RNC 2024 coverage"
