        "text": "Sir Leon Radzinowicz is one of the leading figures in the development of criminology in the twentieth century, working as an academic criminologist, an adviser to governments and as the founding Director of the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge. This account intertwines Sir Leon’s personal narrative as a criminologist with the development of criminology itself. Drawing on his long career spanning seventy years, from the 1920s to the present day, he writes about fundamental changes which have affected our understanding of crime and criminals, of criminal justice and penal systems, and of the tensions and dilemmas these pose for democratic societies. He offers a unique perspective on the intellectual and institutional history of criminology within a wide comparative perspective.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nList of plates Foreword by The Rt. Hon.

Hon. The Lord Woolf Master of the Rolls\n\nHow marvellous that Sir Leon has been spared to write this great book. He approaches his ninety-second birthday and his century is in sight. His admirers and disciples all over the world will celebrate its publication and will want to congratulate him on yet another marvellous achievement. After all, it is a quarter of a century since he retired in 1972 and a more impressive seventy years since he graduated at the age of twenty-two, magna cum laude, from the Institute of Criminology in Rome. Professor Roger Hood, in the introduction to Sir Leon’s Festschrift—Crime, Criminology and Public Policy (1973)—accurately forecast it was impossible to imagine him in a state of leisurely retirement. There could not be a better time for the Adventures to be published. Criminology, thanks to Sir Leon’s influence, may be flourishing in Britain but the penal system of the country has lost its way. We have forsaken Sir Leon’s message and instead of tackling the fundamental causes of crime we are sending more and more people to prison for longer and longer periods, ignoring the expense and ignoring the effect of overcrowding on the ability of the Prison Service to promote training and education for the inmates which are its responsibility. In the early 1990s, the prison population was 40,000 and falling. The Prison Service was focusing on developing regimes, preparing prisoners for release and maintaining family links. The service was seeking to make the criticism, that prisons are an expensive way of making people worse, unjustified. Now the population is over 60,000 and rising and we are back to crisis management. Once again the cancer of overcrowding is eating at the heart of constructive initiatives promoted by the service. The lessons learnt as a result of the Strangeways epidemic of riots are being forgotten. Recent events underline the relevance of Sir Leon’s comment that ‘international experience shows that as public concern about crime and its control increases, pressures to roll back the liberal procedures for bringing offenders to justice become more acute’ (see p. 118).\n\nxi\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThe present Labour government is having to pay for its failure to vigorously oppose the populist penal policies of the previous Conservative government. The sad spectacle of the previous government and the Opposition competing for the title of being the toughest on crime is now haunting the present government. As I write, a prison for child offenders is being established.1 The tabloids which bayed for the sentences which led to its creation are now expressing outrage at the cost of looking after the young criminals, said to be at least £125,000 per child per year. The only justification for this cost that the present government can give is that, by the time it took office, to cancel this folly would not have resulted in any saving. The clear implication being that the new prison does not have anything of real worth to offer, notwithstanding the huge costs involved. I wholeheartedly endorse Sir Leon’s statement that ‘no meaningful advance in penal matters can be achieved in contemporary democratic societies so long as it remains a topic of party political controversy instead of a matter of national concern’ (see p. 49). Sir Leon was a member of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment. The non-party political approach which resulted in its abolition demonstrates what can be achieved in the way of enlightened reform when politicians are able to discard their party labels. The state of our penal policy has caused Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, to call for the establishment of a Royal Commission to report on the situation. This is a remedy about which Sir Leon expresses reservations in Chapter 14. These reservations need to be borne in mind if, as I hope, Lord Bingham’s call is answered. I accept Sir Leon’s advice that ‘much good can be achieved in promoting progress and readjustments in the penal system not so much by putting on the agenda of reform huge, ambitious schemes of “reconstruction”, but by coming to grips with a series of much more limited and much more precisely defined topics in response to certain obvious, yet not adequately satisfied, needs’ (see p. 331). Yet, surely, the time is fast approaching when an overwhelming consensus will develop that, in order to protect the public against crime, some radical alternative response is required to those tattered remedies which are being currently deployed. When this happens, this work, which with eloquence and style surveys the timeless contribution of Sir Leon to criminal justice over his magnificently long lifetime, will be available to direct a new way forward. If we learn from his unique personal involvement, his unrivalled international experience and great wisdom, we should be able to avoid repeating the majority of the mistakes and the lost opportunities of the past. To quote Sir Leon again, we ‘are too often inclined to forget that\n\n1 The Medway Secure Training Centre; Group 4 has a fifteen-year contract to run the Centre.\n\nxii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nthere was always a time when the past was the present and that it is therefore prudent and fair to ascertain whether some of the solutions of the past do not contain a worthy message or a wise indication with respect to matters which still preserve their significance and utility in spite of the inexorable passage of time’ (see p. 43). It is an immense honour to be associated with this book by being asked to contribute this foreword. I suspect that this invitation is Sir Leon’s way of endorsing the reforms I recommended in my report on Prison Disturbances. If my suspicions are correct, I regard it as a huge compliment which I wish I could have repaid by the quality of this short foreword. Alas, as will be selfevident, I lack the abilities required to achieve this. I have found it impossible to convey as this book does the international and comparative scale of Sir Leon’s work, the dimensions of his personal experience, the breadth of his interests and the universality and timelessness of his criminology. It requires the erudition and elegance of a Sir Leon Radzinowicz to do justice to Sir Leon and that is exactly what this book does. It confirms that what Sir Leon has to say remains essential reading for anyone remotely interested in the subject which he has made his own: criminology.\n\nxiii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nIt is a very great honour and an enduring pleasure to have my last book introduced in such a generous way by Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls, and the author of the memorable report on our prison conditions. Penal reform demands not only a firm dose of realism but also a genuine social conscience and a deep concern for justice. Roger Hood, the first Professor of Criminology in the University of Oxford, was an exceptionally able student of mine. This relationship rapidly grew into solid friendship and close collaboration which, in the course of over thirty years, has assumed many forms. An unrepentant scribbler who easily might slip into overwriting—amongst other sins—I badly needed an exceptional editor. Roger Hood, not surprisingly, discharged this function to perfection. The fact that he knows the dark corners of our discipline so well made his task so much less strenuous. I am delighted to acknowledge that I am greatly indebted to him. I am grateful to Lloyd Cutler, the eminent Washington lawyer (he was legal counsel to two presidents) for introducing me to Judge Patrick Cudahy, the Chairman of the Patrick and Ann M. Cudahy Foundation. The trustees graciously voted to make a grant towards my research expenses. And so did the Wakefield Trust, established by Mrs Priscilla Mitchell, a dear friend of mine and a benefactor of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology. I may perhaps mention that I also made a contribution. It is very pleasing to have this book published by the widely respected publishing house of Routledge and to be taken care of by David Hill, the managing director. Our friendship goes back to the time when he, following his father, Alan Hill of Heinemann, became the publisher of the Cambridge Studies in Criminology series. I would like to renew my warm thanks to the following for providing me with much useful information—either through correspondence or by allowing me to visit them: Giuliano Vassalli, the former Professor of Criminal Law in Rome, Minister of Justice and now a member of the Constitutional Court of Italy; Professors Hans-Heinrich Jescheck, Günther Kaiser and Dr Barbara Huber of the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law in Freiburg i. Br; M. Eugène Frencken, then the Secrétaire xiv\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\ngénéral of the Belgian Ministry of Justice and Professors Françoise Tulkens and Dan Kaminski of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Law in the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve; Professor Hans Schultz of the University of Berne and the Federal Department of Justice in Switzerland; Eduardo Vetere and Irène Melup of the United Nations; Aglaia Tsitsoura of the Council of Europe; and last but not least the Home Office for enabling me to lose myself in the mass of papers relating to the period of my involvement. I have found the following three libraries indispensable in my work and I wish to express my appreciation to: Mrs Elizabeth Kelly, Director of the Biddle Law Library of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and to Mrs Marta Tarnawsky; to Professor Joseph Kürzinger of the Max Planck Institute; and to Mrs Helen Krarup of the Radzinowicz Library, Cambridge Institute of Criminology. Miss Frances Hoenigswald, on the staff of the Biddle Law Library, has always found time to help me in the search for, and classification of, the material I needed. Her devoted assistance has been most effective. I am happy to say that our collaboration continues. My secretary, Mrs Margaret Thompson, has again typed all my drafts with her usual exemplary reliability. As the drafts progressed through the word processor towards publication Humaira Erfan Ahmed and Hannah Bichard were asked to give a hand. I would like to thank them very much for their help.2 [* * *] When a man as old as I am decides to write a book he requires all the good will he can muster. I have been very fortunate in this respect, receiving support and encouragement from many quarters. As a further insurance I have taken to heart the following message conveyed by the great English actor Sir Ralph Richardson when interviewed by Russell Harty for the New Yorker magazine in 1977: HARTY: SIR RALPH:\n\nAre you viewing the prospect of old age with regret or happiness? I’m amazed that I’m so old as I am. I always had the idea that when I was old I’d get frightfully clever. I’d get awfully learned. I’d get jolly sage. People would come to me for advice. But nobody ever comes to me for anything, and I don’t know a thing. L.R. June 1998\n\nxv\n\n1 AT THE CREATION\n\nThe maestro ‘What are you reading, young friend?’ ‘Cesare Lombroso’s L’Uomo Delinquente.’ ‘Very good. But always remember that Lombroso was a genius who lacked talent.’\n\nThis was one of my first conversations with Enrico Ferri. It took place over seventy years ago, more precisely in September 1927 at his Institute of Criminology in Rome. He must have attached importance to his comment for a few months later, while talking to me in his splendid villa about the work of Lombroso, he pointed to Lombroso’s bust on his desk and said: ‘My young friend, do not make the mistake common to so many of Lombroso’s detractors and always remember that he was a man of genius though he was without talent.’ I followed up my legal studies in Paris and Geneva and went to Rome at the age of twenty-two. I had gone to Rome because it was there that criminology in an undiluted and expansive form was being shaped. So began what was to be a lifetime’s adventure in criminology. It was Cesare Lombroso, a medical man, who had launched the idea and followed it up in several vital, though often flawed, confused and contradictory directions. Enrico Ferri, the jurist, had taken it up with unusual imagination and zeal, and had deepened, widened and made more coherent its scope and contents, moulding the corpus of evolving knowledge and radical penal proposals under the aegis of a new school, the Scuola Positiva di Diritto Criminale. He had joined Lombroso in earnest in 1878 when, at the age of twenty-two, he had reviewed the second edition of L’Uomo Delinquente in the Rivista Europea, and he toiled in undisturbed cordial and fruitful collaboration with Lombroso for thirty-one years, until the latter passed away in 1909. By then Ferri was acknowledged throughout the world as the authoritative exponent and leader of the new creed. 1\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nLike everyone else I was fascinated by his appearance and presence. Tall, lean, bent slightly backward, with sensitive hands, elongated neck, superb head, piercing and oscillating eyes, engaging smile and a beautiful pliable voice which could express a whole range of moods: he embodied an altogether exceptional human being. ‘A man of really unusual physical beauty’, remarked Helen Zimmern in her book The Italy of the Italians (1906, p. 189), ‘is Enrico Ferri, as well as of charm of manner and of eloquence, which, when stirred to a theme dear to his heart, carries all before it.’ This was in harmony with the intellectual quality he radiated, for he was a man of many exciting parts and many considerable talents. No wonder one would come across him in all sorts of out of the way publications, and certainly not the kinds of places where the species of law professor would be expected to appear. This combination would have been unusual in anyone under any circumstances but it was particularly so in his case because the background from which he stemmed stood in the starkest possible contrast with his achievements. He, the fervent believer in the decisive influences of hereditary transmission and environmental constellation, must have been puzzled more than once when relating them to his own past (see Plate 1). He was born on 25 February 1856 in the small town of San Benedett-Po in the province of Mantua. His father, though he tried hard, proved to be a total failure. A purveyor of goods to a military unit, he became bankrupt and by a narrow margin escaped imprisonment for debt. The family continued to live, or rather to vegetate, in miserable conditions. All nine of his siblings died at an early age and in 1875 his father also passed away. His mother, by then fifty-three years old, became a cook and a laundress, and afterwards opened and ran a small tobacconist shop to support herself and her son through the lycée and the University of Bologna. They had no one in the world except each other and she became an integral part of his life, even after Ferri had married and had his own family. Their household became her home in the most intimate meaning of the term. At the age of fifty-seven she embarked upon learning the alphabet in order to read what was written about her son. And a tremendous lot was pouring in from all over the world; it warmed her heart and made her feel the happiest woman on earth, after so many dark and hard years of emotional and material deprivations. She lived to be ninety and Ferri saluted her memory in an article— ‘In memoria di mia madre’ — published in the Scuola Positiva, the journal of the new school, in January 1896. ‘Era forte e buona’ was the motto of his moving tribute, written without inhibition and affectation. His was a truly meteoric career. It was forged within the brief span of fifteen years, but its worth, diversity and scale would easily have required the full lifespan of any but an exceptionally endowed individual. It started in 1878 when, as a young man of twenty-two, he submitted his dissertation to the Faculty of Law of Bologna—instantaneously provoking acclaim and criticism, both of which continued to resound for many decades to come. He began to 2\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\naccumulate a criminological luggage of published work which, well before he was forty-five, had placed him definitely at the very forefront of the scholars in his chosen field. As a professor in several universities and finally in Rome his reputation was enthusiastically upheld by generations of grateful and admiring students. As a lecturer on a variety of subjects, frequently well outside the confines of criminal science proper, he was in steady demand far beyond Italy. His lectures were invariably regarded as brilliant, and so were his frequent interventions in international penal congresses. He was also an editor of Avanti, the mouthpiece of the left, and of Scuola Positiva, the authoritative organ of the new criminological school. Effective involvement and remarkable success in a series of sensational civil, criminal and political cases established him, again when he was not yet forty-five, as the preeminent advocate of Italy. Finally, as an orator, in a country renowned for its talent in flowery and passionate eloquence, he remained an undimmed star. The lionization was eagerly shared by the genteel ladies of literary circles whether in Naples or Florence, by not so easily satisfied academic audiences, by members of a stormy Parliament, in exacting courts of justice, and, most dramatically, by the masses—peasants in Sicily and workers in Milan—often hungry and in revolt. His socialist allegiance had faded away before I appeared on the scene and more will be said about it later (pp. 21–24). He was vain, very vain, but after all he was Italian and human and furthermore there was a tremendous amount to be justifiably proud of. He was self-centred, extrovert, yet subtle in human relations and public situations, persistent but not overbearing. There was nothing mean in him, indeed he was capable of generous gestures. His concentration and energy came close to being terrifying. His entire existence was geared to the objectives he had assigned to himself at an early stage. And all the ‘mechanics’ of life were at hand to sustain him. The family life was perfect. Sheer physical strength, unquenchable drive and well-balanced emotions were perfectly attuned to each other. Except for his early youth, his style of life could hardly have been made more agreeable and comfortable. Yet its enjoyment was strictly controlled, in many ways even spartan. He shared with us, his students, in the regular course on criminal law, as part of the curriculum of the faculty and in the smaller group at the institute —then known as La Scuola d’Applicazione Giuridico-Criminale— his scientific findings and postulates. With his superb gifts of exposition it came so easily to him, free of technicalities and hesitations. Always alert and indefatigable in pouncing on the weaknesses or inconsistencies in the work of his numerous adversaries, he hardly ever bothered to draw our attention to flaws or ambiguities inherent in his positivist version of criminology. Apparently Clemenceau used to say that he could always identify an article written by Jean Jaurès (the famous socialist leader), even when unsigned, simply because ‘it never ended with a question mark but always with a point of exclamation’. This characteristic admirably fitted the maestro and I 3\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nsuppose it would also have fitted Karl Marx or Sigmund Freud, indeed anyone with a mission to convey and a crusade to conduct. It was imperative for Ferri that we should digest, absorb and retain unchanged the doctrine as laid down by him and destined to last forever. Raising the slightest doubt made him visibly impatient, not to say bored. I was then too inexperienced to ponder upon the intense, intolerant, one-sided and often dangerous streaks of an innovator. This was to come much later. I was very young (twenty-two years old) and could hardly resist the invigorating criminological indoctrination, especially as it occurred at a time in my life when I needed to believe: much more to believe than to discern, to sift or to weigh up. The status quo Concentrate on the study of criminal procedure, rather than on the substantive criminal law, because in the latter field there remains little to be added to what has already been done by your fathers. (Francesco Carrara)\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century witnessed the emergence and radiation of powerful currents of thought which affected so many aspects of individual and society and of the individual in society. Auguste Comte—the visionary and inspiring projector of human destiny; Herbert Spencer—the pedantic and yet reassuring promoter of social engineering grounded on the developing industrial society; Karl Marx—the relentless and dramatic inquisitor of the capitalist economy, leaving no alternatives to his doctrinal precepts; Charles Darwin—the unassuming and yet supremely authoritative explorer of evolutionary processes in plants and animals, as well as in human beings. Their vitality and productivity were stupendous and their refutation of criticisms matched the fierceness of their opponents’ attacks. I plunged into them in the last year of my schooling in Poland with the easily predictable adverse effect on my final diploma (matura). With unabated enthusiasm I continued to peruse them in Paris and Geneva in addition to my appointed legal studies. Naturally I was very often left hazy, indeed confused, though the total impact was exciting and durable. I felt that humanity was at a cross-roads and continued to be so because many of the messages and their implications remained largely unfulfilled. Ferri was in the midst of this seemingly inexhaustible ferment at the very time he was seeking to form his outlook on life and to sharpen his scientific convictions. With his superb intelligence, sensibility and ambitions, he could not have remained a passive onlooker and was bound to become an active participant. He was captivated by the many-sided onslaught and the process of his intellectual and emotional identification with it was accelerated by the\n\n4\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nearly and continuing influence exercised on him by Roberto Ardigò—his teacher in his lycée who soon was to become a noted philosopher in Italy. Ferri urged me to make his acquaintance. I ploughed through a portion of his œuvre—twelve volumes in toto—but I felt that Ferri had exaggerated the significance of the man. However, Ardigò was a trumpeter of change and this appealed to Ferri enormously. By 1890, when he was not yet thirty-three, Ferri had made up his mind where he stood and remained faithful to this scientific posture for nearly four decades. It led him to make two assumptions: one flawed and ephemeral, the other correct and enduring. By ingenuous and tempting twists he convinced himself, and tried to convince others, that, putting aside some differences in interpretation and method, the four major currents of thought which so mightily agitated the contemporary mind, in effect, supplemented each other. Indeed, in the final analysis, they formed a harmonious and perfectly integrated symbiosis—with Karl Marx leading them all to the altar. How Comte, Marx, Darwin and Spencer would have responded to this offer of fusion is not difficult to anticipate, although rather difficult to prove for the simple reason that the first passed away in 1857, the second in 1883, and the third in 1882. Spencer was still alive, indeed very much so (he died in 1903), and his response was tart and succinct. In a letter to an Italian newspaper Spencer expressed ‘his astonishment at the audacity of him who has made use of [my] name to defend socialism’. Ferri, undeterred, remarked, in a spirited reply, there was no one in Italy who would misuse so grotesquely the name of Herbert Spencer, whose extreme individualism is known to all the world. But the personal opinion of Herbert Spencer is a quite different thing from the logical consequence of the scientific theories concerning universal evolution which he has developed more fully and better than anyone else but of which he has not the official monopoly nor the power to prohibit their free expansion by the labour of other thinkers. Ferri also met with violent opposition from within his own camp. Baron Raffaele Garofalo, the other eminent figure of the positivist school of criminal law and criminology, opened his attack through his pamphlet The Socialist Superstition (La Superstizione Socialista, 1895). From Marxist circles came the castigating voice of Antonio Labriola, who warned both the leadership of the Italian socialist party (through Filippo Turati) and the German party (through Friedrich Engels) of the dangerous consequences likely to emanate from Ferri’s interpretation, which diluted, indeed emasculated, Marxism through an opportunistic ideological accommodation. He conferred upon Ferri the insulting epithet of ‘signal charlatan’.\n\n5\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nNevertheless, it is difficult to deny that Ferri’s book Socialism and Positive Science (Darwin—Spencer—Marx) had a long and vigorous life. Its first appearance in Italy in 1894 was followed by two editions. Soon afterwards it was translated into French, Spanish and German. It went though three editions in the United States, the first in 1901, the last in 1909; and it landed in Britain as a volume in The Socialist Library in 1909, passing through five editions. Ramsay MacDonald, the editor of the series, wrote an interesting and eulogistic foreword. And some twenty years later, as Prime Minister, he attempted to erect a bridge in a government of national unity between the Tories and Labour, not unlike Ferri’s hope of reconciling Spencer with Marx. When I arrived in Rome in 1928 no one seemed to be discussing or even to be aware of these polemics. However, the maestro must have been still troubled by the problem of how to reconcile his faded socialism with the triumphant ascendancy of fascism and with the role that a positivist criminology could play within the orbit of an authoritative state without negating its very essence, scientific and moral. The way in which he thought he had solved this dilemma will emerge later. In the mean time, it is important to delineate the second of his assumptions because of its intrinsic and permanent value. It had imposed itself on Ferri’s mind from his early days and he shared it with us, eager to listen to him. Powerful thrusts of thought which affected the roots of individual and societal existence must inevitably have an impact on the major institutions regulating life. The impact may not always be acknowledged, it may vary in intensity, it may or may not be beneficial, but it is always there. The institution of criminal law and the system of criminal justice could not avoid such reverberations. And yet to the reformers of the day it appeared undeniable that these currents had been bypassing the structure of criminal law and its functioning. Isolated, unbent, static, supremely confident, the existing penal system was drawing its solutions from ideological and scientific resources primarily belonging to a phase of development which was losing much of its significance. To discover the theoretical model of criminal law embodying this outlook of the status quo one has to turn to Italy and direct one’s searchlights on Francesco Carrara. To find the practical model of its enforcement the road leads to the Criminal Codes of France and their numerous imitators. Born in Lucca in 1805, Carrara spent the first fifty-four years of his life there, teaching in a lycée and practising as a highly respected provincial lawyer in his beloved Tuscany. He was apparently also scribbling in his free time, but nothing seems to have come out of it. Not surprisingly he was little known. In 1859, he was called to occupy the Chair of Criminal Law at the University of Pisa, and almost immediately he became famous in Italy and indeed throughout Europe. Within a few years ten hefty volumes of his Programma del Corso di Diritto Criminale made their appearance and a further eight volumes of Opuscoli, containing his speeches, articles and shorter treatises, followed. He lived to be ninety-three and, although blind for the last few years 6\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nof his life, he continued to teach. Ferri told us one day how, anxious to meet Carrara in the flesh, he had gone to visit him in his house at Pisa and how, on that very occasion, a man accused of adultery (which was then a criminal offence) also called on Carrara to consult him about his predicament. The leading criminal jurist of the world had still felt that he needed further advice and the young Enrico was ordered to bring down from the upper shelves of Carrara’s library the treatise of Benedict Carpzow (1635) which, for a century, had a deep influence on criminal law and its interpretation in Saxony and beyond. Modest and unassuming, he was loaded with all imaginable honours and died as a venerable Senator of the Realm. The lovely and quaint Lucca has not forgotten him. In visiting the city, as I sometimes do when indulging in my picola cura in Montecatini, I cannot fail to come across the handsome monument erected in his memory, nor can I fail to make a note of the magnificent library he gave to the University of Pisa and the personal papers locked in the archives of the Courts of Justice of Lucca. There can be no proper discipline of criminal law and no satisfactory system of criminal justice, stated Carrara in the opening paragraphs of the introduction to his magnum opus, unless we discover the very basic principle which should inspire and guide them and see how this principle is adhered to when theoretical concepts are developed and practical solutions are set on foot.1 This is how he postulated the ‘fundamental principle and its formula’. First, ‘crime is not a factual entity but a juridical entity’ (‘il delitto non è un ente di fatto, ma un ente juridico’). Second, ‘criminal science has for its mission to curb abuses of authority’ (‘la scienza criminale ha per sua missione di moderare gli abusi dell’autorità’). The two, he confidently asserted, contain in themselves ‘the germ of everything that is true in criminal science’ (‘il germe di tutte le verità della scienza criminale’). The first signals that moral, psychological or sociological investigations and findings are not, and should not be, the concern of the criminal law. The business of criminal law is to deal with crime as a juridical fact, or still better, as a juridical artefact: to identify and to define it in objective legal terms by means of strict logical dissection and synthesis and place it appropriately within the catalogue of all the other acts of commission or omission brought within the orbit of the criminal law in force. The second element implies that the system of criminal justice should be grounded on a rule of law which disowns arbitrariness, excesses and all the devious pressures in prosecution, trial and conviction which had been sanctioned and freely practised under the ancien régime. The very institution of punishment has to be subordinated to this principle and conform to its two limbs. Its purpose is not to relate to the criminal perpetrator, to potential criminals or to society at large. When adroitly applied, punishment may well have an effect on these elements but they should be\n\n1 F.Carrara, Opuscoli di Diritto Criminale, 2 vols (Lucca, 1859–67), vol. 1.\n\n7\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nregarded as secondary, derivative and even accidental, because the basic justification of punishment is to ensure as far as possible ‘juridical protection’ (‘tutela juridica’). Although expiation, retribution and deterrence may flow from punishment they are but by-products of it and not its essence. Karl Roeder of Heidelberg University, a noted professor and penal reformer and a contemporary of Carrara, advocated reformation as the major purpose of punishment. 2 The latter lost no time in raising his voice against it, maintaining that, at best, this cannot be but an ‘accessory of punishment’ (‘chè un accessario della pena’); that ‘the rehabilitation of a criminal can be ascertained only through a most difficult experimentation absolutely unobtainable in social life’ (‘la correzione del colpevole è verificabile solo attraverso un difficilissimo sperimentalismo assolutamente irrealizzabile nella vita sociale’); and that by pushing this objective to the forefront one endangers the individual’s rights and assigns to the state—but an agent of criminal law enforcement—functions and prerogatives which do not belong to it. To the extent that punishment departs from its formal purpose and aims at securing this, or any other external objectives, criminal justice inevitably becomes less legal, more administratively oriented, more ideological and consequently more relativistic and unpredictable. The surest way to avoid these evils, states Carrara, echoing almost verbatim Beccaria, and to ensure that punishment does not become an act of violence, is to make it absolutely certain that it is public, prompt, necessary, the least severe in given circumstances, proportionate to the offence and fixed by law. In reviving these fiery polemics of the 1870s, one comes so very close to the controversies initiated by the Nordic criminologists and their counterparts in the United States and Britain in the 1970s, and cannot fail to react to them as something déjà vu. They are mostly radicals, whereas Carrara was a fervent Catholic and a liberal. It is one of the most attractive and puzzling features of criminology that when its evolution is retraced historically it reveals an almost incurable tendency to give birth to strange bedfellows. Enrico Ferri was an agnostic and a socialist. This entire classical vision, in an embryonic form, was first portrayed by Cesare Beccaria, whose Crimes and Punishments appeared for the first time in 1765. Beccaria had a genius for composing a stirring manifesto, but neither by intellectual temperament nor professional preparation was he capable of writing (or willing to write) a systematic treatise. It is here that Carrara stepped in. He constructed a system that encompassed the entire field of criminal science; its General Part, conferring rules such as those regulating criminal responsibility, attempts, complicity, provocation and premeditation; its Special Part including all the major offences; and its penal economy devised to secure an effective enforcement under legitimate public authority. And, because of its exceptional all-round quality, the treatise continued to be acknowledged\n\n2 K.Roeder, Rivista Penale (1875), vol. 2.\n\n8\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nup to the beginning of the twentieth century as the authorita tive and authentic text of the classical school of criminal law (I had in my library at Cambridge its tenth edition of 1924). Looking at the leading penal laws of the period and the professional literature supporting them. Carrara could not fail to feel exhilarated. He—the sophisticated scrutineer of the past—had become the unashamed troubadour of the present. In his inaugural lecture in 1873 he went so far as to exhort the undergraduates of the University of Pisa to concentrate on the study of criminal procedure rather than on the substantive criminal law, because in the latter field ‘there remains little to be added to what has already been done by your fathers’. New horizons Criminal law urgently needs radically new horizons. (Enrico Ferri)\n\nCarrara never failed to emphasize his indebtedness to Beccaria, nor did Ferri fail to express his admiration for both. But he was left unconvinced. To him the entire system needed urgently to be reshaped, root and branch. Partial reforms might appear to be useful but, in the long run, would prove to be pernicious because they would simply hide the basic structural failings and postpone the inevitable necessity for radical solutions. And, no question, the programme of penal reconstruction he taught me was the most radical of its kind ever presented anywhere in the course of the entire twentieth century and still remains so even today. In many ways it went much further than the reforms advocated by Beccaria and by Carrara following the French Revolution. What follows is an attempt to provide the gist of the new doctrine as faithfully and succinctly as I can. To amplify it by the findings and counterfindings of the very many studies generated by it would gravely unbalance my memoir. To take the point of departure: the fundamental principle formulated by Carrara and implied by Beccaria—which the French would be inclined to accept as their l’idée-force—was one-sided and incomplete. In consequence, it was not valid as the exclusive basis of the penal system. Yes, it was true that crime is a ‘juridical entity’ defined by strict normative legal rules and should continue to be so regarded, otherwise the frontiers of criminal law would be expanded far beyond what is necessary and justifiable. Other forms of behaviour labelled as anti-social, immoral, amoral, deviant, dissident, or even marginal, would fatally be brought within the scope of criminal behaviour. The very stability and coherence of the criminal law would be endangered beyond repair with far-reaching negative socio-political repercussions. 9\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nNevertheless, the formula as it stands had to be converted, or, more precisely, turned round: crime is an entity of fact (ente di fatto) before it becomes a juridical entity. The perception of crime as a natural phenomenon, i.e. the expression of a particular individual personality acting within the context of a specific social environment, must take precedence over the perception of crime as a formal phenomenon, i.e. the violation of a prohibition laid down under the penal law. The empirical approach is more basic and one which should be given priority over the dogmatic approach. Surely, the legal syllogism by itself produced a meticulously symmetrical construction grounded solely on aprioristic and deductive premises, an abstraction which would distort both the substance of criminal science and the purposes of a criminal code. And now to pass to the second limb of the classical position. Yes, it is true that criminal science and penal law should ‘have for their mission to curb abuses of authority’ and Ferri was profuse in his eulogy of this aspect of the classical school’s contribution. It represented through its basic ideological core, as well as through its specific provisions, a most generous reaction against the laws and traditions of the medieval ages: a reaction against the barbarisms inflicted upon individuals by a punitive and non-accountable state which exceeded by far its proper limits, thus uprooting in the penal sphere the zealous respect for individual rights, the solemn affirmation of which would forever remain the glory of the French Revolution. Yet Ferri believed that the time had come for a fundamental demarcation to be recognized. Whereas Beccaria had made his appeal to the old Europe at the dawn of a new social and political epoch, Carrara developed the doctrine in a period of social and political stability, when the view that criminal law should guarantee legality to all citizens, including criminals, had gained wide theoretical and practical acceptance. Though vigilance to preserve this most precious conquest should never subside, the battle had been won and firm conclusions flowed from it. From now on, the ingredient of liberal individualism, which by its very nature is static, should recede into the background in comparison with a vigorous social component, which by its very nature is dynamic. There should be no cleavage between crime and criminal, between criminal and society. Criminal policy should link up with social policy and the Magna Carta Criminal Code should merge into a Social Defence Code. If these two reformulations were to be thrown into the whirlpool of unfettered academic criminological explorations, nothing monolithic and radical was likely to emerge, simply because of the very many complex and dissonant questions inherent in them. But the situation would dramatically change if they were laid down in a categorical manner to serve as directives in the construction of a positivist criminal code. This is, in effect, what the maestro had in mind. With undiluted boldness, and in utter disregard of centuries-long moral and legal heritage, he drew from the reformulations two such directives. 10\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nFirst, the total elimination from penal codes of the concept of criminal responsibility; second, a similar rejection of the concept of punishment. There is, of course, a natural connection between the two: both evoke a deep echo in the philosophy of individual and social life as felt, perceived and taught by virtually all religious creeds across the world. Furthermore, the classicists assumed the existence of criminal responsibility as an essential part of the liberal creed of individual choice—the grounding for their retributive system. The positivists rejected it as being incompatible with social and personal determinism: an obstacle to their scheme for protective measures of crime control. The limitations of human free will were being revealed more and more clearly by the solid advances in medical and social sciences and they told against the rule of making offenders accountable for their offences whenever they could be held ‘responsible’ for their actions (or omissions). In practice, however, even the most sophisticated and subtle legal formulae proved to be unsatisfactory when they came to be applied to complex individual cases, except when in one way or another extreme insanity was beyond dispute. Not knowing what one was doing and not being able to control one’s actions are the two kernels of all such definitions. The very inclusion in penal legislation of the mental condition called ‘diminished responsibility’ was a recognition of the growing scepticism. And so were the so-often undignified and sterile confrontations between lawyers and medico-psychiatric experts acting on behalf of the prosecution and defence. The effectiveness and credibility of the system of criminal justice as a whole were affected by it. ‘Every active perpetrator of a crime’, stated Ferri, who was never tired of repeating it, is always legally responsible, provided that the act is his own, i.e., that it is an expression of his own personality, no matter what was his physical and psychological condition when he considered it and carried it out. Man is always responsible for every one of his acts, for the sole reason that he lives in society, and for as long as he does so. Legal responsibility is all that is needed. Similarly, punishment, as it was perceived and regulated in contemporary legislation, drew its raison d’être from roots identical to those which maintained the traditional concept of responsibility: namely, free will and moral guilt with their deeply embedded attributes of expiation, retribution and deterrence. Punishment was the restorative and responsibility was the declarative aspect of the same component. And to make it operative and visible—the classicists insisted—it was essential to ensure, as closely as possible, proportionality between the nature of the crime committed and the quality of the punishment inflicted. This—the positivists insisted—was again 11\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\na largely abstract, dogmatic process of thinking which contained neither guarantee nor hope that it would produce socially useful results in curtailing crime. There was no room for the institution of punishment within a Code of Social Defence. It should be erased and replaced by ‘Sanctions’ or ‘Measures of Social Defence’. This was not a mere reshuffling of terminology. The possibility, the probability, or the certainty of reversion to crime constituted the offender’s ‘state of danger’ (pericolosità). It was this which should be regarded as the decisive criterion in selecting an appropriate response to crime in each particular instance. The nature of the crime would still be taken into consideration, but it would be only one of the many factors indicative of the delinquent’s future course of life. The concept was not altogether new: it can be retraced in the nineteenth-century legislation introduced in many countries to try to cope with vagrancy and mendacity; in the very many reflexes of preventive police laws; in attempts to deal with recidivists and in deciding what to do with people suffering from insanity in its various shades. But never before had this concept been pushed into a central position in criminology, penal legislation and administration. It was Garofalo, the other major figure of positivism, who took up the idea in his memorable essay Di un Criterio Positivo della Penalità (1880), gave it a new look and, more importantly, a new dimension. Ferri, drawing upon this as well as upon his rich criminological knowledge and court experiences, elaborated the formula in several directions. He specified it with a detailed precision, making it readily available to be used as a spearhead in the imposition, enforcement and revocation of sanctions. It led to the following terse and novel syllogism to govern the process of sentencing and its aftermath: within the limits laid down by law a sanction is to be applicable to a delinquent in accordance with his state of danger—the degree of dangerousness to be determined by the gravity and kind of the criminal act, his dominant motives and his personality. The state of danger could be of two kinds, major or minor, the first to be assessed by seventeen criteria and circumstances, the second by eight. There was hardly any indicative aspect of the delinquent’s personality which was not to be explored in depth and recorded: such as the delinquent’s psychobiological make-up; social, family and professional background; criminal or any anti-social past; motivation and modus operandi; connection with or attitude towards the victim, before and after the commission of the offence. The cumulative effect of these indicators (my enumeration is not exhaustive but illustrative), providing that they were thoroughly and correctly registered and collated, could hardly fail to reconstruct a minutely individualized profile of a transgressor which, in the final analysis, would lay a foundation for the choice of an appropriate individualized sanction. The expectation was that, as a general rule, offenders declared to exhibit a maximum state of danger would, in their conduct, reveal a minimum of social 12\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nadaptability, whereas the conduct of those evidencing a minor state of danger would demonstrate a maximum of social adaptability. The positivists also held that the customary differentiation of offences, into those directed against property, person, sex and state, was hardly of any use in the processes of assessing the state of danger and choosing a sanction. This was simply because, in reality, the same type of delinquent might commit offences belonging to either or several of these classes and, inversely, because offences in any of these classes might be committed by different types of offenders. One needed to look at crime as a whole and then single out and describe the basic categories of criminals who produced it. Ferri regarded this as a pivotal task for criminological research as well as an essential adjunct to the sentencing and enforcement processes of criminal justice. At an early stage of his work he built up such a classification, enriching and refining it greatly as he went along in his explorations. It was made up of five primary categories: the born criminal, by instinct or congenital tendency; the insane criminal; the habitual criminal; the occasional criminal; and the criminal from passion. To these five he further added: the criminal couple; the criminal crowd; non-intentional transgressors; and, cutting across the entire spectrum, the group of young offenders. Each of these broad categories was supported by a many-sided characterization which revealed them not as skeletons derived from abstract schematizations, but as living human beings whom we may fear, despise, hate or sympathize with, but also whom we should not fail to acknowledge as the product of their individual personalities influenced by the sociocultural environment from which they came and continued to be part of. I must refrain from describing in greater detail this aspect of criminological positivism because of the nature of this book, but there is a point which I feel should not pass unnoticed. In arriving at this classification Ferri had relied heavily on material harnessed by many researchers, starting with Lombroso, but he had also made an original and major contribution himself. At an early age and singlehanded he embarked upon an inquiry into the crime of murder—concentrating on 1,550 (in round figures) individuals, made up of 700 soldiers (his control group), 300 of the insane and 550 convicted murderers—with the object of throwing empirical light on this, the gravest of crimes, and of checking the relevance of his group classification. The volume embodying the results appeared in 1895 but it is the fifth edition of 1925, thoroughly revised in substance and presentation, which should be remembered.3 In his lectures at the school and at the institute Ferri frequently shared with us his major findings, proving how vitally important it is to go beyond the crime of murder defined in legal terms and to concentrate on murderers within\n\n3 E.Ferri, L’Omicida nella Psicologia e nella Psicopatologia Criminale, including L’Omicidio Suicidio (5th edn, 1925).\n\n13\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nthe context of their environment. The many important differences between the five classes emerged distinctly: to take the extreme examples, the first category of murderers (the murderer by instinct or congenital tendency) revealed sixty characteristics and the last (occasional murderer) only fifteen. Some time ago I made a rather extensive summary of all his findings and showed it to Dr Donald West (Emeritus Professor of Clinical Criminology at the Cambridge Institute) whom I esteem greatly, not least for his cautious and critical mind. Although he naturally regarded the theoretical basis developed by Ferri as rather archaic he nevertheless agreed that ‘the factual observations on many points have since been observed and rediscovered by others’. This was the first major piece of criminological research I had come into contact with and I was fascinated by its modernity and exceptional insight. I continue to regret that this opus, today virtually unknown, has not been made available in English (or French for that matter). It was no less fascinating and instructive, though on an altogether different plane, to watch the maestro try to test his classification against the gallery of heroes and villains painted by the gripping literary imagination and magnetic language of Shakespeare, Dante, Dostoyevsky, Balzac or Zola: deranged or immoral; bent by a degenerative heritage or corrupted by a vicious environment; spurred by the lowest or by the noblest of instincts and motives—greedy and mean, ruthless and violent, calculating or emotional, weak or cowardly. He usually had no difficulty in rediscovering his criminal types in their œuvres and, carried away by his Italian emotionality, he would come near to conferring upon them (posthumously of course) the accolade he usually reserved only for a few most loyal criminological positivists. He published these bold interpretations in a book which met with instant success. It was translated into several languages (not into English as far as I know) and though somewhat erratic and strained it still makes for delightful reading.4 The design of a Code of Social Defence Young people are, as a general rule, much more interested in ideas than in their practicality. I was no exception. I am therefore particularly grateful to Ferri for having directed my attention to this at an early stage of my life. He was good at it. One of his favourite sayings was to the effect that however beautiful the branches and leaves of a tree may happen to be, that tree could not prove viable unless it also had firm and healthy roots. Thus, the mapping out of concrete and detailed plans of crime control, by which he meant both prevention and repression, figured prominently in his general approach and found a conspicuous place in his teaching. Furthermore, for those of us desirous to get a more thorough insight, there was always the possibility of\n\n4 E.Ferri, Delinquenti nell’ Arte (1st edn, 1896; 2nd revised edn, 1926).\n\n14\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nconsulting his books, articles and legislative proposals, knowing that he would always find time to respond to our queries. The classification of criminals into certain empirically proved categories and according to their state of danger, also empirically assessed, were the two basic elements which formed the core of the positivist criminal policy. Ferri formulated it very early, somewhere towards the end of the nineteenth century, and there was nothing in the literature of the period, or in practice, to compare with it for coherence, comprehensiveness, specificity and, last but not least, boldness. It would be unfair to pretend that everything originated from his design and he would have been the first to acknowledge it. Neither the International Association of Criminal Law nor the International Penitentiary Commission, both of which began to spread their beneficial effects on penal developments in Europe from 1900 onwards, contained a single proposal, major or minor, which had not already become part and parcel of Ferri’s scheme. In effect, he kept his eyes wide open for legislative innovations and practical reforms emanating from several European centres as well as from a few of the South American states. But he followed his own path. He honoured in full the penological legacy of the Enlightenment and of the French Revolution; indeed he went far beyond it, by expunging from his system any solution which belonged to, or displayed, the slightest affinity with the past. There was to be no transportation; no detention on public works, in chains or otherwise; no flogging, or any other devices inflicting immediate physical pain; no forceful exposure to the public; no police supervision as a penal sanction; no grounding of the prison system on solitary confinement; no capital punishment for any kind of crime. Even as late as 1900 the International Association of Criminal Law had ascertained a truly daunting list of aggravations to the enforcement of deprivation of liberty, pliable enough to be used as instruments of arbitrariness and torture, in the regulations governing at least forty-five European prisons. Yet the general assembly of the association, having taken note of this deplorable evidence, nevertheless concluded that these aggravations ‘could not be avoided’. Twelve years later, Franz von Liszt, the guiding spirit of the association, felt that it was still essential to do something about it and he moved a recommendation that aggravation in the enforcement of imprisonment should be unconditionally rejected. Stringent solitary confinement, baptized by Ferri as ‘one of the aberrations of the twentieth century’, still continued to play a prominent part in penitentiary organization everywhere. In the 1920s, when I was staying in Rome, evidence started to come in pointing to the emergence of ominous regressive trends affecting the entire penal sphere. Ferri’s deeply felt concern that criminal policy, because of its subject-matter, could not avoid at times making painful, tough decisions, but that it could and should nevertheless strive to be effective without being inhuman, began to be looked upon in certain influential quarters as just another faded socio-liberal shibboleth. Seemingly indifferent to the gathering 15\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nstorm, Ferri kept a firm grip on his vision of criminal policy. Untrammelled by the so-often tortuous process of harmonizing the legal definition of responsibility with the mental state of the particular offender; disregarding the traditional concepts of moral guilt, expiation or retribution; rejecting the insistence upon proportionality between crime and punishment and determining the latter, on the basis of predominantly utilitarian concerns of social defence, Ferri was enabled to give full rein to his resourcefulness and imagination in redesigning a system of unorthodox, variegated and elastic sanctions. There was to be a group of ten sanctions to deal with first and occasional delinquents, removed as far as possible from the imposition of short terms of imprisonment. Another rather unusual nucleus of sanctions was directed towards political offenders and those held responsible for crimes of passion. A welcomed expansion of fines was projected, making them more stringent and at the same time more effectively readjusted to the economic situation of individual delinquents. The idea of giving much fuller scope to compensation for damages inflicted upon the victims (physical, moral, social or material), first expounded by Garofalo, was taken up by Ferri and developed on a large scale throughout the whole penal spectrum, both as an independent measure and jointly with other types of sanctions. Elaborate separate institutions for those mentally affected, and a highly diversified system with special rules of criminal procedure and specialized courts inspired by a predominant reformative bent, were to be made available for young and young-adult transgressors. Brushing aside any objections or hesitations, both of which could justifiably be entertained with respect to indeterminate sentences, Ferri proposed two types: relatively indeterminate and absolutely indeterminate—that is to say, with a minimum and a maximum, or with a minimum but no maximum. Their use was to depend on whether offenders were early recidivists, habitual or dangerous or born criminals, on the degree of their state of danger and the probability of their social readaptation. The minimum could be as high as five or ten years and the maximum as drastic as twenty years or even for life. However, the possibility of a conditional discharge remained, although its use was to be regulated by a strict procedure. An imaginative and widespread system of after-care endowed with ample resources should become an integral part of the whole penal structure and not just left to sporadic, blatantly ineffectual, half-measures. Possibly inspired by Bentham’s scheme for criminal prophylaxy before crime is committed (ante delictum), Ferri recommended a combination of precautionary and preventive measures to be pursued on a systematic and regular basis. He called them ‘penal substitutes’. Finally one has to add to it all, or more precisely ‘superadd’, the exceptionally prominent part that Ferri expected the judge to play. The judge, to put it tersely and succinctly, was the centre of the system. His task was to ascertain the criminal category and the state of danger, minor or major, with 16\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nrespect to each individual offender; they were to select out of the rich well of sanctions the one that they regarded as the most appropriate in furthering the objectives of social defence, whether to secure readaptation or to activate prolonged, even permanent, segregation through the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. Judges were also expected to be involved with penal administration in many crucial matters such as conditional discharge from, or revocation of, an indeterminate sentence. It is true that some directives were laid down to guide them in their sentencing capacity but these were minimal when contrasted with the reality of judges’ enormous discretionary power. I do not know of any code in force, or any projected penal code, during the entire period of Ferri’s scientific and legislative activity (which extended over fifty years), nor in the course of the sixty-nine years since his death, which can bear any significant comparison with this aspect of the positivist design. But Ferri did not conceal his conviction that, as a general rule, the judiciary of his day was not up to the satisfactory discharge of so formidable a task. He proposed two changes to raise their standards, not only for the benefit of the exigencies of the sentencing process but for the benefit of the system of criminal justice as a whole. First, that the judiciary should be split into two branches: one dealing with civil and the other with criminal matters. This division should be stringently observed throughout all levels of the court organization. There should be an established career as a criminal judge. They would be carefully selected, well rewarded and held in high esteem. It was a foregone conclusion that there was no room under his design for the jury system. It was too amateurish, too emotional and too unpredictable. By its very nature and constantly changing composition it was inimical to a scientific, rational approach. Its total removal, even with respect to those charged with political offences, was essential, maintained Ferri, the professor who as an advocate had been their hero and darling for so many decades. Second, the curriculum of law school, which in Italy (as in Europe generally) was of three years’ duration, should be split into two phases. The first phase, occupying the first two years, should be concerned with the predominantly juridical study of the various branches of the law, including criminal law and criminal procedure. Ferri never denied the importance of the discipline—after all he had, at one time, been a successor of Carrara in Pisa. But here too he had definite views as to how it should be taught. He fulminated against the excesses of dogmatic, logistic and deductive study and interpretation. This so often led to sterile, splitting-of-the-hair disquisitions which lost sight of the fact that crime is foremost a natural and social fact. Almost as if it were provocation to the traditional scholars of criminal law, Ferri’s major opus on Murder contained hardly any reference to the crime of murder in its legal perception nor the hotly debated issues of ‘malice aforethought’ or ‘constructive malice’. Instead the volume opened with two substantial chapters tracing the crime of murder amongst animals and amongst so-called primitive people, fascinating chapters which, according to the expert 17\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nopinions I have consulted, have survived remarkably well the test of time. His bête noire in this respect was the German tradition. On this he was in full agreement with his contemporary Franz von Liszt, the head of the innovative criminal science school of Germany. No doubt in the eyes of the formidable Karl Binding, the unsurpassed master of dogmatic exposition, Ferri would share with Von Liszt the epitaph of Di Dilettanten. And Von Liszt would have to suffer the epitaph conferred by the classicist Luccini on Ferri: Gli Simplicisti. The second stage of law school, comprising the last year, should be devoted to criminology in its widest possible sense, comprising all the basic auxiliary disciplines concerned with the study of the phenomenon of crime and its control. In addition, there should be institutes of criminology attached to faculties of law ready to receive all those who desired to specialize in criminal science and practice. And at this juncture came the crucial requirement: no one should be appointed to be a criminal judge who had failed to follow this pattern of academic study. Thus, when a total view was taken, it was a vision of a system of criminal policy and criminal justice, dynamic and experimental, under which every single offence was regarded as a signal for launching a remedial and protective action with respect to its perpetrator. It was a system which, far removed from the early versions of Lombroso’s hypothesis of the origin of criminal behaviour, recognized the impact of social environment, yet regarded individual disposition as an independent and major factor in the etiology of crime, though of varying degree of intensity. It was a system which was not afraid of losing its juridical physiognomy by borrowing from the social and medical sciences any scheme or design which could be of help. It was a system which pleaded for closer integration between the various sectors of criminal justice in order to make better use of available resources. It was a system which was bent upon raising the status of criminal policy and the role of criminal justice in the governance of a country and one which would combine effectiveness with humanity. It was a system which acknowledged the value of criminology and expected it to monitor failings and achievements and new initiatives in a systematic and critical way. It was a system inspired by vigorous optimism, an optimism which was grounded in the dominant belief of the inevitability of expanding progress in all the major spheres of national life. In its wake, crime, as a mass phenomenon, was bound to disappear, except for that committed by a residue of predisposed criminals. The rest would be achieved by shaking off a criminal policy shaped by the classical school. It was a system incompatible, from the very start to the very end, with the under-developed and often distorted prevailing penal structures run routinely by a narrowminded, self-satisfied bureaucracy closed to outside independent and thorough evaluation. Ferri usually kept cool when criticisms, however severe, were directed against him and his school. Indeed, in some ways, he was too indifferent or even condescending, but he was certainly justified in feeling scornful when 18\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nthe eminent philosopher Giovanni Gentile castigated the positivists with the gibe that ‘the delinquent of Lombroso is not a delinquent, but the body of a delinquent’. In contrast, it warmed the heart of the positivists struggling hard for recognition when a Dutch professor of international reputation who was not a positivist stated: ‘L’école classique exhorte les Hommes à connâitre la justice; l’école positiviste exhorts la justice à connâitre les Hommes.’ Gerard Anton van Hamel put it as a heading to his paper written in honour of Lombroso and the aphorism made a tour du monde. The demise of criminological positivism To dislodge a philosophy and a doctrine as meaningful and so masterly communicated as the classical doctrine, to challenge the credibility of the major criminal codes of the period which were so firmly entrenched in the political culture, was a truly formidable undertaking. Yet Ferri never faltered in believing that, however long and bumpy the road towards recognition would prove to be, the essence of criminological positivism, clothed in obligatory legislative language, would ultimately win the day. He and his associates would then share in the glory of Beccaria and Carrara as having initiated a new phase of criminal jurisprudence and practice in that major European country which, for centuries, had enjoyed the reputation of being la patria del diritto penale. In the years 1919–21 they seemed to have come close, very close, to achieving this truly extraordinary triumph. Italy was to be endowed with a Positivist Criminal Code and positivism was to become a potent sociopolitical factor in the life of the country. Ludovico Mortara, the Minister of Justice and a former First President of the Supreme Court, felt that the time had come to replace the classical Code of Zanardelli, in force since 1885. By Royal Decree a Commission for the Reform of the Criminal Laws of the country was set up under the chairmanship of Enrico Ferri, packed with positivists or their close sympathizers. This was in 1919. In 1921 Ferri presented a Project of a Penal Code, containing its general part, together with an introduction which expounded its basic principles and signalled its main solutions. It was a remarkable document: of great clarity, precision, conciseness and force, but at the same time highly controversial. At once translated into several languages, it evoked intense interest all over the world. By 1927 it was dead and dead for good. Its burial was not, to paraphrase the title of a famous film, in ‘Italian Style’. There were no rites, no condolences, no recriminations, no memorial services, and seemingly no sadness and no joy. It was accepted as yet another event in the inevitable chain of events leading to a new chapter in Italy’s history. A fresh commission was appointed, this time under the direction of Arturo Rocco, the powerful Minister of Justice in Mussolini’s government, and its project of 1927 became the Codice Rocco. It remained in force until the\n\n19\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\ndownfall of the fascist regime, chasing away for ever the dream of a Codice Ferri. The stage was set for a dramatic denouement in conformity with Ferri’s personality and life, but nothing of this sort happened. What his thoughts were in this supreme crisis I did not know and, of course, I could not expect to know: I was too young, too insignificant and too foreign. I am pretty certain he did not share them with many, for, in spite of being so eminently sociable and clubbable, he firmly kept issues of grave importance to himself. As a matter of fact, I was rather glad to be ignored and so was everybody else. I had not come to Rome to be a public prosecutor, defender, judge or jury of Ferri’s conclusions. I came to see whether I could be inspired by him to believe that criminology had a substance and a message which made it worth pursuing. With the perspective now of more than six decades, I can perceive more clearly the four alternatives open to him at that time. He could, like Giacomo Matteotti, have engaged in an active fight against the fascist onslaught and, most likely, he would have shared the fate of Matteotti, who was brutally murdered by the fascist Falangists under Mussolini’s direct orders, his murderers remaining undiscovered. He could have left the country and continued in exile, say from Paris, his uncompromising opposition to all things fascist—the road followed by Filippo Turati, the central figure of the Italian socialist party with whom Ferri often crossed swords but whom he held in high esteem. He could have remained in the country, abandoning his previous political allegiance, abstaining from any direct or indirect action hostile towards the regime, yet not supporting it—to be a kind of silent outsider, but one who was not cut off from his natural environment. And, finally, he could have tried to arrange an accommodation, genuine or opportunistic, or both (in high politics it is often a mixture), with the new political reality and so in appearance or substance become part of it. The maestro must have been aware that his past could never be rekindled, and he therefore concentrated upon building a bridge between bygone positivism and the ruling fascist legal establishment. Ferri left the socialist party following the end of the First World War, obviously disillusioned like so many others. The party was in a dire state, bitterly divided between its left and right wing, incapable on its own of assuming power and opposed to sharing it with some other democratic nonsocialist party. It was thus reduced to impotence and, in the mean time, the country was plunging into chaos. This is acknowledged both by reputable historians of socialism as well as by historians generally, though of course this was not the only element of the national drama. ‘People, such as Croce, the liberal high priest,’ writes Denis Mack Smith, the leading English historian of modern Italy, ‘advocated Mussolini’s assumption of power as better than the existing anarchy, and believed that fascism might be gently directed into good constitutional usage.’ Nevertheless he judges harshly Ferri’s political activity, 20\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nseemingly supporting the view of a number of Ferri’s socialist colleagues who regarded him as ‘a notorious opportunist who never adhered to one policy for very long…a clever and dangerous man’.5 His attempt to secure criminological readjustments expressed itself in several ways. Some could not fail to appear rather theatrical and others consisted primarily in repainting the labels to the detriment of the substance. In 1926 he undertook the defence of Violet Gibson, an Englishwoman, obviously deranged, who attacked Benito Mussolini in circumstances most unpropitious for a successful assassination. 6 She was held to be not responsible, discharged and sent back to England. This episode warmed the hearts of loyal fascists. As a general rule only an abnormal person could contemplate the killing of Il Duce and that person should therefore be declared insane and sent to a mental institution. But a person who happened to be clearly politically motivated should be sentenced to death and put to death. All his life Ferri had been in favour of the total abolition of capital punishment but in 1926 he postulated a differentiation. There should still be no capital punishment for any common offence, including murder, but it could be justified in certain cases as an extreme and exceptional remedy in response to abnormal conditions prevailing in a society at a particular stage. And thus he gave his support to the Law of the Defence of the State of 25 November 1926, reintroducing capital punishment following four attempts on the life of Mussolini within twelve months, also with the object of ‘giving satisfaction to the deep feelings of public opinion’.7 And shortly afterwards, as might have been expected, the fascist legislators, forgetting the legacy of Beccaria and Carrara, reintroduced capital punishment within the wider context of their new Criminal Code. A much commented upon piece entitled Fascismo e Criminologia Una Lettera di Enrico Ferri published in the Popolo d’Italia (19 December 1923) had already revealed the imminent ideological shift, but of decisive significance was the forty-page article published initially in the Scuola Positiva (July 1926) and reissued in his Studi sulla Criminalità. 8 This clinched the issue. It was a piece which so vividly brought to life the Ferri of the past. Pugnacious, dialectical, eloquent, theatrical and at the same time often moving, well equipped with factual information, rich in comparative thrusts relating to several countries and long periods of penal history—trying to justify the present not only by its intrinsic merits but also by the missed opportunities of the past. It was a veritable tour de force. There he stood\n\n5 6 7 8\n\nDenis Mack Smith, Italy: A Modern History (1969 edn), pp. 228 and 369–70. Enrico Ferri, ‘A Character Study and Life History of Violet Gibson, Who Attempted the Life of Benito Mussolini on the 7th of April 1926’, Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, vol. 19 (1928–9), pp. 211–19. Sociologia Criminale, vol. 2 (5th edn, 1930), p. 488. 2nd edn, 1926, p. 696.\n\n21\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\ntrying to preserve the legacy he had built up over half a century—the vibrant essence of his entire life. But it was also a thoroughly sad piece. What he intended to prove could not be proved in good faith. The very title of his essay, ‘Fascism and the Positive School in Social Defence against Criminality’, contained contradictions which could not be satisfactorily sorted out and the more he tried to do it the more strained and disingenuous his attempt appeared to be. According to Ferri the divergence between positivism and Fascism would only exist if by positivism one understood a ‘philosophical system’ such as that of Comte, Spencer or Ardigò. The revival of the spiritualist trend in philosophy, also embraced by the fascist ideology, was easily to be explained as a justified reaction against the fatalism, determinism and materialism associated with philosophical positivism. However, a confusion had arisen only because of terminological misunderstanding. What he and his school meant by positivism was not the philosophical system of positivism but the positivist method of study and perception, and more precisely its empirical approach, an approach which was also common to fascism. This was obviously more of a dialectical twist than a serious argument. His second attempt at clarification was no less fallacious and possibly even more perilous. It was concerned with the central issue of the position of the individual in relation to society and the state. Here, Ferri asserted, there was no room for any misunderstanding. Long before fascism came to power he and his close followers had emphasized on more than one occasion that, in general, but more particularly in the penal sphere, the preservation of individual rights had gone too far at the expense of the legitimate concerns of the collective authority. Their draft Penal Code project of 1921, with its wide range of indeterminate sentences and other types of sanctions, had given ample proof of their concern. What positivism urged in the penal sphere, fascism ‘proclaimed in the sociological and political sphere, more specifically the reaffirmation of the pre-eminently sovereign rights of the state in the face of the excesses of the democratic individualism which is fast becoming demagogical and substantially anarchic…a state to which Benito Mussolini has affixed with good reasons a dynamic obituary’. In 1927 a second edition of his pamphlet Mussolini, Uomo di Stato appeared. A similar tribute is contained in two more of Ferri’s pamphlets which appeared at about the same time. This assertion, translated into plain language, meant that criminological positivism fits perfectly the purposes of fascism and could be adopted with good results as its criminal policy. Coming from the head of the positivist school such an assertion could perhaps, in the short run, yield a few dividends. But in the long run this self-inflicted deep wound placed him in a morally impossible position. Pushing his analysis further, Ferri singled out sixteen initiatives taken by the fascist regime which showed the strong imprint of positivism. It was a very mixed bag. A few of these reforms, projected or implemented, were innocuous 22\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nor even progressive, belonging to that early stage of fascism when it was still warmly praised in many influential international circles as the first movement of national renovation in the history of Italy which could make its trains run on time. Some others on this shopping list unmistakably revealed the iron fist of the regime aimed at reducing the margin of freedom and building up a machinery of justice which would secure a more insidious control. The few which could be shown to have a direct linkage with positivism are primarily those which were pliable enough to be part of an authoritarian criminal policy. The jury system was abolished but for reasons different from those adduced by Ferri. It was not because juries were not qualified to return sound and purposeful verdicts, it was because the verdicts could contain unwanted surprises prejudicial to the authorities, whereas the judges who owed allegiance to the regime could be relied upon. The discretionary power of the judges on criminal matters had been extended along the lines of Ferri’s project, not in order to ensure enlightened individualization but to make it easier to hit hard both actual and potential offenders. For the same reason, the state of danger was accepted as one of the criteria to determine the quality and degree of punishment to be imposed. Indeterminate sentences which replaced punishment were rejected. Instead a constellation of security measures of very long duration were introduced for certain categories of ‘dangerous’ offenders. These would be served after they had undergone punishments proportionate to the gravity of their offences and their culpability. In certain cases the police were given the power of administrative interference before the commission of an offence through the exercise of regular supervision or, still worse, through the exile to one of the less known isolated islands off the coast of Italy, well protected from innocent tourist intrusion or pointed impartial inspection. The Lombroso-Ferrian type of born criminal had at last found a niche in the famous Article 18 of the Criminal Code of Rocco, which reaffirmed an hereditary or otherwise determined individual disposition towards criminal behaviour as contrasted with the view which proclaimed the predominance of environmental factors, a view which had never found favour with fascist ideology. The maestro’s embrace was not spurned. He was still too important and still too widely remembered to be ignored. He was asked to join the commission set up by Rocco to formulate a new Criminal Code. The Institute of Criminology of Rome, the first of its kind in the world, which he had established in 1911 and which continued to be so close to his heart, received substantial support from the Ministry of Justice. He was appointed leader of the Italian delegation to the International Penal Congress held in London in 1925 and on his return presented a report to the government entitled The Triumph of Italian Science’. And he was made, like Francesco Carrara before him, a Senator of the Realm. One point should not be lost sight of in retracing these sad events because it makes them less painful and, in some ways, more redeeming. Throughout this period, perhaps in order to erase the bitter taste 23\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nof the accommodation with fascism, or, more importantly, because he wished to leave his scientific legacy unblemished and untarnished, and perhaps also because of a feeling that he would not live much longer, he embarked at the age of seventy upon scholarly work no less demanding than that he had undertaken as a young man when he had decided to break the status quo of his beloved discipline and make the world a better place. This entailed a new edition of his Studies in Criminality; a drastic revision of his major research on Murder; a Treatise on the Principles of Criminal Law; an intense preparation of the fifth edition of his magnum opus, Criminal Sociology.9 Here no apology was needed, no embarrassment was caused. Full praise was due. It seems to me that there are two ways of assessing the role and worth of the Scuola Positiva. First, in relation to what existed in the field of the study of crime at the time of its emergence. Second, what its qualities and limitations proved to be in the longer perspective of the subsequent evolution of criminology as a whole. Both approaches are required for a proper assessment and I shall attempt to say something about them when I have progressed further in retracing this evolution. In the mean time I have to close my Roman chapter. It was a wonderful experience. I was already fully aware at the time that it would remain for ever a permanent part of my being—and it proved to be so. I had been fortunate to have, as my Professors of Criminal Law, Henri Donnedieu de Vabres at the Sorbonne and Paul Logoz at Geneva. I owe them a lot. But Enrico Ferri was my first maestro and the only one I had. As it happened I was his last foreign pupil and follower. My work was rewarded by a doctorate of law cum laude and by a diploma of the Criminological Institute. Encouraged by Ferri I translated my doctoral dissertation from Italian into French and, no doubt largely because he volunteered to write a preface, I had no difficulty in finding a well-known Parisian publisher to launch it in 1929. On the eve of my departure from Rome Ferri invited me to come to see him again. He asked me whether I had made up my mind to follow the academic path and on receiving an affirmative answer he said:\n\n9 Thorsten Sellin noted in his significant article on Ferri that when the fourth edition had been published in 1900, Ferri had claimed that ‘he had examined all the literature of the previous decade to complete his document’. The fifth edition was published (in two volumes in 1929 and 1930) posthumously. Arturo Santoro, who had been assisting Ferri, completed the footnotes and saw the manuscript through to publication. Sellin commented: ‘It seems clear that in the nearly three decades between the two editions, Ferri had found less and less time to keep up with the literature, except in his own country. Of the circa 4,700 footnote references in the fifth edition less than 1,100 date from this century and 75 per cent of these are to Italian sources…Ferri used to say during his later years that he found nothing written of such importance that it had caused him to change his views.’ See Thorsten Sellin, ‘Enrico Ferri 1856–1929’, in Hermann Mannheim (ed.) Pioneers in Criminology (1960), pp. 277–300, at p. 287, fn. 19.\n\n24\n\nAT THE CREATION\n\nOne alternative would be the eternally exciting Paris; the other Geneva—a place of serene and civilized stability. You may feel somewhat isolated there, but you are not likely to lose yourself. I recommend Geneva. And I would like, if you will allow me, to send to Paul Logoz your ‘criminological profile’ as I see it. I shall be writing to him tomorrow. Only once more did I see Ferri; it was on 10 January 1929, when I had the honour to convey the homage of the University of Geneva at the sumptuous festivities mounted by the University of Rome to celebrate half a century of teaching in the context of his entire scientific activity. This was followed by the publication of a splendid volume In Onore di Enrico Ferri, containing articles from fifty authors and a list of over five hundred personalities from all over the world who wished to pay a tribute to him. Soon afterwards, on 2 April 1929, Ferri died at the age of seventy-three. I understand that, unlike his turbulent life, his passing away was peaceful.\n\n25\n\n2 FROM AN ACTIVE VOLCANO TO A WELL-ORDERED SCENERY\n\nReturn to Geneva The title I have chosen for this chapter reflects a personal feeling that got hold of me almost immediately on my return to Geneva. I remember that feeling vividly, but I am far from certain whether I can adequately recapture it. And yet, I should try, because the contrast which my title expresses not only relates to matters which may well be regarded as trivial, but also is a metaphor for a radically different attitude towards crime and punishment which prompts reflections of a more general character. Instead of being admitted to a sumptuous villa à la Ferri by a formally dressed servant, it was Professor Paul Logoz himself who opened the door of his charming chalet in the mountains near Geneva and ushered me into his small sitting-room, modestly furnished, with a few books on the shelves and a few handsome vases engraved with rustic designs. Criminology hardly figured in our conversation. Instead, the professor asked me whether I was attracted by mountains and whether I indulged in ski-ing— ‘it is important to start as early as possible if you wish to be good at it’, he announced authoritatively. He was certain that I had enjoyed my stay in Rome—and left it at that. He had no reasons to doubt that his recommendation that I should be appointed Privat-Dozent would be approved by the faculty. I should be prepared to start giving a course in the coming semester (in October) and I would be well advised to give some thought forthwith to the topic of my inaugural lecture, the choice of which he left entirely to me, refraining from making any suggestions. Nor did he enquire whether I already had a theme in mind which I was anxious to develop. He did, however, go out of his way to assure me that everything would turn out to be pleasing and worthwhile simply because, as far as he was aware, the faculty had never had so young a Privat-Dozent. Indeed, he said he was pretty certain that I would be the youngest in Europe. To use the local language,’ he said, ‘it would be an exciting mountaineering expedition.’ He would try to come on the appointed day to listen to me. The meeting was brief, exceedingly amiable, but at such a low key that it could hardly have been lower (see Plate 2).\n\n26\n\nFROM ACTIVE VOLCANO TO WELL-ORDERED SCENERY\n\nIn vain would one look for hundreds and hundreds of students flocking to the faculty’s premises for instruction like at the Sorbonne or in Rome. The Law School in Geneva consisted of, perhaps, two hundred students in toto and a regular class contained a mere fifty to sixty-five. I was one of only two foreign students, the other being a dear Polish friend of mine. Later, as a heroic and brilliant journalist, he was executed by the Nazis in Warsaw. Everyone else was Swiss and, with hardly any exceptions, they were from the leading legal and social circles of Geneva. All of them were visibly very comfortably off, well groomed, tastefully dressed, impeccably polite, confident and at ease. They could expect, in the natural course of events, to find their place in the legal establishment, in banks and important corporations, in public administration and in politics. Nor was there any difference in these respects between the pupils and their teachers. I do not remember a single professor who was not a Genevois. They too were part of la crême de la crême of this small but perfectly attuned world. They were neither anxious nor desirous to establish contacts with the eminent foreign lawyers who, at the time, were working in the League of Nations or the International Labour Office. They valued their self-sufficiency above all. They were a highly competent and thoroughly conscientious body of instructors. The Law Faculty building was somewhat sombre but, in a surprisingly transparent manner, it conveyed a relaxed, even-handed atmosphere which, without any disparaging intent, could be described as a faculty en famille. It could not have been better situated: in a charming, intimate park adjoining the most imposing part of the city, the Parc des Bastions. The stark monument of John Calvin, the most famous inhabitant of Geneva (next to Jean-Jacques Rousseau), stood close at hand to remind one that law and morals should always be intimate and faithful allies. Privat-Dozent is a term unknown in the English-speaking academic world and, as such, it calls for a brief explanation. The appointment did not entitle admission to the inner circle of the faculty. But, if conferred by a university of good repute, it signified a professorial potential and it marked the essential first step in an academic career. As a general rule no one could become a professor unless, at some stage, that person had been a Privat-Dozent and one could not become a Privat-Dozent unless one had obtained a doctorate and had written a special dissertation, the substance of which would be made use of in the inaugural lecture. A Privat-Dozent was expected to give a course of lectures which had to be approved by the faculty, but was hardly ever assigned teaching which was part of the required legal curriculum of the school.

Indeed, their value was precisely that they related to topics and problems which could not be integrated into the formal programme—either because of lack of time or space or because it was thought that the time was not yet ripe to tackle them in a less informal and more systematic manner.

Many people, including students, guided by an engaging politeness often bordering upon meaningless flattery, were in the habit of addressing one as ‘Monsieur le Professeur’. I must confess that as a Privat-Dozent, twenty-three years old and in an unusual foreign environment, I found it rather pleasing, but whether it was really good for me is another matter. I was informed by the Department of Public Education that I was dispensed from submitting a dissertation but that on 16 October 1928 at 3:15 p.m. in auditorium 50 I was to present ‘devant le corps de professeurs de la faculté une leçon sur “La crise et l’avenir du droit pénal”’ (‘The crisis and the future of the criminal law’). The lecture, forty pages long, was almost immediately published in Pari"
