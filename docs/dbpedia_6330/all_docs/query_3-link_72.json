I am most grateful for their cooperation and assistance in its preparation. I should also like to thank the Russian Foreign Ministry, the custodians of the Maisky diaries, for allowing me access to the original diaries, and for their help with archival sources and photographs. Particular thanks are due to Tel Aviv University for the generous grant towards the costs of the translation of the diary into English. Few publishers today would enthusiastically embrace a project which involves the publication of three large volumes of a heavily annotated diary. I am therefore indebted to Jonathan Brent, former director of the ‘Annals of Communism Series’ at Yale University Press, for recognizing the tremendous significance of the diary and for commissioning its publication. My friends, Paul Kennedy and Niall Ferguson, spared no effort in making sure the rare document saw the light of day. I am particularly grateful to John Donatich, the director of YUP, for his continued faith in the project and unstinting support. Jaya Chatterjee, my editor at the press, efficiently and in masterly fashion oversaw the production of the very complex three-volume edition. This is the fruit of more than fifteen years of extensive research. I was most fortunate to profit from a series of generous fellowships at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Institute for Advanced Study at Freiburg and the Rockefeller Research Center at Bellagio. They provided most conducive conditions for pursuing my work and fertile ground for testing and sharing my ideas with leading fellow historians. The lion’s share of my work, however, was done under the auspices of All Souls College, Oxford. It was Isaiah Berlin, a legendary fellow of the college, who first introduced me to Oxford in 1969 and encouraged me to write my dissertation there, and the circle was miraculously completed when I was first offered a visiting fellowship at the college in 2006 and then subsequently elected as a fellow. I can hardly find the proper words to describe the friendships I have forged at All Souls, and the challenging yet congenial environment I have encountered at the college – undoubtedly a guardian of scholarship in its purest form. Sir John Vickers, warden of the college, and the former warden John Davis made me feel at home and spared no effort in providing me with the utmost assistance and encouragement. I was extremely fortunate to have Tatiana Sorokina and Oliver Ready as translators of the diary. Their combined efforts have produced a meticulous and elegant translation that is convincingly idiomatic, yet faithful to Maisky’s unique literary prose. I was equally fortunate to have Clive Liddiard as my copyeditor. His succinct yet wise and punctilious\n\nx\n\nAck now l e d ge m e n ts\n\ninterventions improved the text considerably, as did his command of the Russian language and familiarity with Slavic and East European cultures. The staffs of the National Archives in London and Washington, as well as those of the State Archives in Moscow, were most responsive to my queries and helpful in producing relevant material for my research. Likewise, I am grateful to the dedicated archivists of the scores of collections of private papers which I consulted. They were all most responsive and enthusiastic about the diary and did their utmost to supplement it with precious material. Special appreciation is due to Hillel Adler, who initially helped me set up a most sophisticated database which allowed us to tame and master a voluminous body of archival sources. Dr Ruth Brown was as helpful in assisting me to set up the glossary of more than a thousand people mentioned in the diary. Dr James Womack produced some exquisite translations from the Russian of various letters in Maisky’s private archives. Finally, Ruth Herz, my wife, friend and companion, would be the first to admit that rather than a burden in our life, the years spent with Maisky represented a fascinating joint journey.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe quintessential Maisky – putting pen to paper.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe unique and fascinating diary of Ivan Mikhailovich Maisky, Soviet ambassador to London from 1932 to 1943, is one of the few diaries kept by a Soviet dignitary in the 1930s and during the Second World War.1 Stalin discouraged his entourage from putting pen to paper, and would not allow notes to be taken during meetings at the Kremlin. Keeping a diary, we are reminded, was ‘a risky undertaking when people scared to death were burning papers and archives. Diaries were particularly vulnerable, sought after by the police when they searched the dwellings of suspected “enemies of the people”.’2 Indeed, Maisky’s journals were eventually seized by the Ministry for State Security, together with his vast personal archive, following his arrest in February 1953 (two weeks before Stalin’s death) on accusations of spying for Britain.3 Pardoned in 1955, Maisky led a protracted – yet ultimately futile – campaign to retrieve them. His pleas were turned down by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the grounds that the diary ‘contained various official materials’. He was given only one year of limited access to it while he wrote his memoirs, but was denied access to any other archival sources.4 The diary remained inaccessible to researchers for decades. Serendipity often lies at the heart of scholarly discoveries. In 1993, under the aegis of both the Israeli and the Soviet foreign ministries, I launched a research project which culminated in the joint official publication of documents on Israeli–Soviet relations. It is hard to describe my excitement when, while seeking information on Maisky’s involvement in the Soviet decision to support the partition plan for Palestine in 1947, the archivist at the Russian Foreign Ministry emerged from the stacks with Maisky’s voluminous diary for the eventful year of 1941. No personal document of such breadth, value and size had before emerged from the Soviet archives to throw fresh light on the Second World War and its origins. Flipping through the volume, I was struck by its immediacy and frankness, by Maisky’s astute and penetrating insights, and by his superb prose. It emerged that the diary comprises over half a million words, minutely and candidly depicting the observations, activities and conversations of the ubiquitous Soviet ambassador in London. Maisky typed his daily impressions in the evening, though there are also handwritten entries (remarkably, some of which are missing from the Russian edition) which were often written away from the scrutinizing ‘oeil de Moscou’ within his office at the embassy. Examples of this are the report of his conversation with Eden on 10 June 1941, concerning rumours of a possible German offensive against Russia, and his appraisal of a possible Anglo-German agreement in the wake of the flight of Rudolf Hess, Hitler’s deputy, to Scotland in May 1941.\n\nxiv\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\nAppreciative of the distinctive value of the diary, Yale University Press generously agreed to publish the entire diary, with my extensive commentary, in three volumes. An abridged version has already appeared, containing about 25 per cent of the original diary, but stripped of the vast referential apparatus which is available here. Only a couple of entries, which were repetitive or technical in nature, have been excluded. Any abridgements are indicated by an initial space followed by ellipsis and a subsequent space. Wherever Maisky himself uses ellipsis, there is no initial space. When Maisky employs a word (or phrase) in English, that word appears in italics (editorial conventions also dictate that italics are used for such things as the names of newspapers or ships); whenever Maisky underlines a phrase for emphasis, an underscore is used here. The process of having the diaries declassified and then published in Russia (a legal prerequisite for any publication of such documents in the West) was long and arduous. The editorial work on the Russian edition was shared between the Institute of General History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of its director Alexander Oganovich Chubarian, and Vitaly Yurevich Afiani, director of the Archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which houses Maisky’s vast personal archives. I am much indebted to both for their cooperation. Their competent edition nonetheless conveys a strong official aplomb and tends to uphold the traditional Russian historiography of the events leading up to the Second World War, as if oblivious to the now freshly available Soviet archival sources, not to mention the vast Western archival sources and research literature. The commentary and annotations in the present volume bear no resemblance to those in the Russian edition. The obvious temptation was to reduce any editorial intervention to the minimum and allow Maisky to tell his own tale. However, a detailed contextual commentary seemed indispensable, considering the ruthless conditions under which Maisky kept his diary – forcing him to leave many blank spots in the otherwise rich and informative account – when the storm battered the gates of his own embassy. Fearful and concerned that the diary might be confiscated and denied to future generations, Maisky in fact kept at least three copies of it. The atmosphere turned so oppressive that, shortly before accompanying Eden to Moscow in December 1941, he sent one copy of the earlier part of the diary to Stalin, in what appears to have been an attempt to forestall possible arrest.5 The commentary is therefore by no means confined to the common practice of providing the reader with the basic auxiliary tools. The editorial work inevitably required a reconstruction of the gaps and missing dimensions in the diary, as well as unfolding its historical context. This called for thorough archival research of both Russian and Western archives. Maisky’s entries were juxtaposed with the voluminous correspondence in his private archives (which I unearthed in Moscow), as well as with the telegrams he sent to the Soviet Foreign Ministry (Narkomindel), and the reports by his interlocutors of their meetings. I was also privileged to gain access to Maisky’s personal photo albums: some of the images (many of which reflect the events described in the diary) are reproduced here. They often convey what thousands of words fail to do. I am most grateful to Dr Alexei D. Voskressenski, Maisky’s greatnephew and heir, for allowing me to share with readers Maisky’s incredibly personal, and at times intimate, gaze. The publication of Maisky’s diary conforms to the new approach in Russian history, which focuses on ‘Soviet subjectivity’ in the Stalin era.6 This diary, however, is not the typical Soviet diary, a vehicle to ‘self-perfection’, which was encouraged by the regime\n\nI n t roduc t ion xv\n\nas a means of political education and transformation. It is a personal diary, which would have been classified by the Soviet authorities as ‘inherently bourgeois’, revolving as it does largely around the theme of the self, rather than being a self-critical effort to become a good communist. It is a testament to the pivotal role which personal friendships, conflicts and rivalries played in early Soviet politics, transcending controversies over policy and ideology. It confirms that Soviet society and politics cannot be appropriately described without resorting to the human factor which exposes the unknown personal bonds. While Maisky’s commitment to communism is manifestly proclaimed, he is fully immersed in the tradition of diary writing among the Western ‘bourgeois’ intelligentsia. In fact, regardless of the obvious cultural differences, it resembles Pepys’s diary in its astute observation of the British political and social scene, spiced with anecdotes and gossip. Like Churchill, Maisky surprisingly hails the role of ‘great men’ in history. He further acknowledges the uniqueness of events, rather than following the Marxist interpretation, which subsumes the individual into larger social patterns. Most telling is the recurrent noncommittal statement in the diary: ‘let us wait and see’ – a powerful recognition of the dynamics of history, which is occasionally punctured by a determinist view of the inevitable success of the socialist revolutionary movement, though the timing and nature of the revolution always remain very distant and vague. Far from dismissing ‘the “personal contribution” to the great general cause’, Maisky openly argued in a letter to Georgii Chicherin, the commissar for foreign affairs, that one could ‘scarcely deny that “personality” plays or can play a certain role in history. At times, even not a minor one.’ It was ‘enough to remember,’ he reminded him ‘what Ilich7 meant for our revolution’.8 He had little doubt as to his own central role in shaping history. Describing a crucial meeting with Churchill in September 1941, when the fate of Moscow hung in the air, he wrote: I left home a quarter of an hour before the appointed time. The moon shone brightly. Fantastically shaped clouds raced from west to east. When they blotted the moon and their edges were touched with red and black, the whole picture appeared gloomy and ominous. As if the world was on the eve of its destruction. I drove along the familiar streets and thought: ‘A few more minutes, and an important, perhaps decisive historical moment, fraught with the gravest consequences, will be upon us. Will I rise to the occasion? Do I possess sufficient strength, energy, cunning, agility and wit to play my role with maximum success for the USSR and for all mankind?’ The diary spans a dramatic and crucial epoch and covers a vast spectrum of topics. It was manifestly written with an eye to posterity and awareness of Maisky’s own central role in the process.9 Maisky found himself at the forefront of events, which he believed (far earlier than others) were likely to drag Europe into a world war. He dwells on the shift in Soviet foreign policy in the early thirties and on the motives for joining the League of Nations and for adherence to ‘collective security’. It was Maisky who first alerted Moscow to the danger of appeasement. He fervently attempted to harmonize Soviet and British interests. His task, however, became increasingly difficult when Chamberlain arrived as prime minister in 1937 and pursued his ‘appeasement’ policy, against the backdrop of the ferocious purges raging in Moscow. The voluminous entries for 1938 provide\n\nxvi\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n1. Forging the Grand Alliance. Maisky clinking vodka glasses with Churchill. an insight into the events leading up to the Munich Conference and their devastating repercussions for collective security, as well as for the personal and political fate of both Maisky and Maksim Litvinov, the Soviet commissar for foreign affairs. The diary for 1939 unveils the tremendous psychological pressure under which Maisky acted in his desperate attempts to hasten the conclusion of a tripartite agreement between the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France, intended to forestall a Soviet drift towards isolation. It reveals how often he found himself at odds with his own government, culminating in a stormy meeting at the Kremlin on 21 April, at which both he and Litvinov were harshly criticized and which led to the dismissal of the latter two weeks later. The diary further exposes the confusion which engulfed Soviet diplomats in the wake of the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact and bears witness to Britain’s transition from peace to war. Just as gripping is Maisky’s description, as an informed outsider, of London during the Blitz, and of his frequent intimate meetings with Churchill and Eden. The significance of his war reminiscences can hardly be overstated. While it was the practice of the foreign secretary to keep a record of his meetings with ambassadors, this did not apply to the prime ministers. Consequently, no records are to be found in the British archives of the many crucial conversations held between Maisky and Churchill before and during the Second World War. The only records preserved for posterity are therefore Maisky’s detailed and immediate accounts in his diary and his more succinct telegrams to the Foreign Ministry. The diary thus becomes an indispensable source, replacing the retrospective accounts – tendentious and incomplete – which have served historians so\n\nI n t roduc t ion xvii\n\nfar. It would hardly be an exaggeration to suggest that the diary rewrites some history which we thought we knew. The unprecedented and extraordinary relations Maisky forged with the British leaders are well reflected in a farewell letter that the ambassador wrote to Churchill after his recall: Looking back now on these eleven years, I can say without hesitation that from a personal and political point of view my associations with you, extending over such a long time, have been the highlight of my Ambassadorship here … I greatly enjoyed all our meetings and talks, irrespective of whether you were in or out of office, as I always felt that I was dealing with one of the most remarkable Englishmen of our time. To this, Churchill replied: Your ambassadorship here has indeed covered a decisive period in the history of our two countries and of the whole world. I look back upon it with many pleasant recollections of our meetings both official and private … I look forward to seeing you myself in the not too distant future, and to renewing the personal friendship which we have already built up.10 The leitmotif interwoven with Maisky’s principal historical narrative is his personal struggle for physical survival during the ferocious purges, at the end of which only he and his friend, the feminist Aleksandra Kollontay, Soviet ambassador in Stockholm, remained at their posts in Europe.11 Throughout his ambassadorship, Maisky had to walk a tightrope: being frank in his conversations with his British interlocutors and yet careful not to antagonize the Kremlin. The inner tensions are evident throughout the diary. Fearing that relations between the two countries were poisoned by mutual suspicion, and aware of his own precarious position, Maisky often withheld vital information from the Kremlin. A striking example was the suppression of information concerning Churchill’s admission in 1943 that he could not even undertake to launch a cross-channel attack in 1944.12 The intertwined narratives are highlighted by penetrating – at times amusing – observations and anecdotes on British society, politicians, royalty, writers and artists which enliven the historical narrative. Maisky’s penchant for writing prose and poetry betrayed a compulsive urge for self-expression. The result is a hybrid of literature and history. ‘I had had literary inclinations since childhood,’ he reminisces: As a boy I was fond of keeping a diary and corresponding with relations and friends … As far back as I remember, I was always composing or describing something – a forest after rain, an ambulance station, a trip to Chernoluchye, a pine wood not far from Omsk, and so on. Having grown up a little, I tried my powers in diaries, school essays and articles on current topics. In later years, Maisky would confess to his close friend, the Fabian Beatrice Webb, who also entertained literary aspirations, that ‘he dislikes the profession of diplomacy; he and his wife would have been far happier in the academic or professional world; in\n\nxviii\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n2. A page from Maisky’s earlier diaries, following his arrest and exile in 1906. the lecture room, library or laboratory’.13 Indeed, when he was incarcerated at the age of 70, he wrote a compelling novel Close and Far Away. Maisky was further blessed with an extraordinary memory which, enhanced by penetrating psychological insight, powerful observation and insatiable curiosity, turned him into one of the most astute witnesses of the dramatic events and personalities of the 1930s. ‘Long diplomatic practice,’ he explained, had trained my memory to act as a sort of photographic plate, which could without difficulty take up all the characteristics of the people I met. Their appearance, words, gestures and intonations were rapidly recorded on this plate, building up into sharply defined, detailed images. Often I would reach a mental conclusion about a person – positive or negative, with or without qualifications – on the spot, straight after our first acquaintance.14 ‘You used to look down upon us from the Gallery in Parliament,’ recalled Harold Nicolson – author, diplomat and diarist – in a letter to Maisky, ‘with benevolent interest rather like a biologist examines the habits of newts in a tank.’15 Having spent two years in London in exile during the First World War, followed by two years as chargé d’affaires at the embassy in the 1920s and 11 years as ambassador, his circle of acquaintances was vast. The very intimacy Maisky enjoyed with the top echelons of British politicians and officials, as well as with intellectuals and artists, gave\n\nI n t roduc t ion xix\n\nhim a perfect vantage point. Records of his conversations cover inter alia five British prime ministers – Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill – as well as King George V, Edward VIII and an impressive array of prominent figures such as Anthony Eden, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Simon, Lady Nancy Astor, Samuel John Hoare, Herbert Morrison, Clement Attlee, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Hugh Dalton, Stafford Cripps, John Maynard Keynes, John Strachey, Robert Vansittart, Joe Kennedy, Harry Hopkins, Jan Christian Smuts, Jan Masaryk, Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells, to name just a few. For non-experts, with limited access to the rich and fascinating documents published by the Russians on the events leading up to the war, the diary provides a rare glimpse into the inner state of the Soviet mind: its entries question many of the prevailing, often tendentious, interpretations of both Russian and Western historiography. For experts, it supplements the documents published in the Dokumenty vneshnei politiki by providing a colourful and candid description of Maisky’s interlocutors, disclosing his own emotional, ideological and political thoughts, which are missing from the official documents. Moreover, it is stunning to discover the extent to which politicians and officials such as Beaverbrook, Lloyd George, Eden and Vansittart spoke candidly and openly with the Soviet ambassador – at times with more sympathy for the Soviet cause than has been conceived so far. It was one thing to hear from Beatrice Webb ‘that in her opinion the capitalist system has only 20–30 years left to live’, but quite another to learn from Brendan Bracken, Churchill’s confidant, that he was ‘unsure about capitalism’s future … arguing that the world is heading for the triumph of socialism, even if not exactly the socialism we have in the Soviet Union’.16 In one of their intimate fireside talks, Eden reacted to Maisky’s passing remark that capitalism was ‘a spent force’, thus: Yes, you are right. The capitalist system in its present form has had its day. What will replace it? I can’t say exactly, but it will certainly be a different system. State capitalism? Semi-socialism? Three-quarter socialism? Complete socialism? I don’t know. Maybe it will be a particularly pure British form of ‘Conservative socialism’.17 The plethora of memoirs and diaries of Western politicians that revolve around the Second World War is striking in comparison with the dearth on the Soviet side. The only significant memoirs to have emerged from Russia were those written by the military in the 1960s. The generals were allowed to shift the blame for the unpreparedness of the Red Army in June 1941 onto Stalin as part of the de-Stalinization process. Because of the paucity of personal recollections, Maisky’s series of memoirs18 (quoting selectively from his diary) turned out to be an indispensable source for historians in reconstructing Soviet policy. Compelling as they are, the memoirs, written with hindsight at the height of the Cold War, are contentious and misleading. That is why his extemporary and spontaneous diary assumes tremendous historical significance. The memoirs present Soviet foreign policy as morally and politically righteous, glossing over issues of contention. The memoirs have therefore often led historians up a blind alley and should indeed be reconsidered now that the full diary, which conveys the immediate and far less biased impressions, is available for inspection.\n\nxx\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\nThe discrepancy between the memoirs and the diary is hardly surprising. Throughout his professional life, Maisky paid a heavy price for siding with the Mensheviks during the revolution. By the late 1940s, his star was already on the wane. An early sign of his eclipse was the criticism of a booklet by Boris Shtein (Soviet ambassador in Italy during the 1930s) on the origins of the Second World War, in the Communist Party journal Bolshevik. The criticism of Shtein’s ‘objective approach’ spill over onto Maisky, who had reviewed the book favourably.19 At the height of the anti-Jewish frenzy following the Doctors’ Plot of 1952, Maisky was arrested and charged with espionage, treason and involvement in Zionist conspiracy. Although Stalin’s death two weeks later, in March 1953, spared his life, his incarceration was extended by two more years for alleged association with Stalin’s former henchman, L.P. Beria. Beria, who apparently wished to see Maisky installed as foreign minister in 1953, assigned him to coordinate intelligence activities in Britain at the Ministry of Home Security. In July 1953, however, Beria himself was arrested and soon afterwards executed. Maisky’s alleged association with Beria and his imprisonment seemed to reinforce the memory of his never-forgotten past association with the Mensheviks. As soon as Stalin died, Maisky hastened to address Georgii Malenkov, the newly elected chairman of the Council of Ministers, from his prison cell. He proposed to atone for his past mistakes by assisting in setting up a group of young, capable Soviet historians who would ‘specialize in combating the bourgeois falsification of contemporary history. The practicalities of this could be later discussed, in case it was found possible to save my life.’20 In 1955, at the age of 72, frail and sick after two and a half years of humiliation and imprisonment, Maisky faced a long and frantic struggle to reinstate his party membership and his position at the Academy of Sciences, and above all to secure full rehabilitation.21 Hardly out of prison, Maisky complained to Nikita Khrushchev that he was being ‘ostracized’, and vowed to do ‘his utmost for the benefit of the party’ by ‘effectively serving the Soviet State as an academic-historian’. He proposed to engage in research into the historiography of the Second World War which would ‘critically evaluate the literature published in the West’.22 Likewise he expressed to Voroshilov, chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the ‘most ardent desire … to best serve the Soviet State’ in the remaining years of his life by becoming the ‘in-house historian of the USSR’s foreign policy … unmasking the most eminent bourgeois falsifiers of contemporary history, particularly of the period of the Second World War’.23 Appearing before the powerful Control Committee of the Party in spring 1957, Maisky restated his fundamental objective of ‘unmasking the anti-Soviet falsifications of the Second World War history which currently are literally flooding the book markets of the capitalist world’.24 In July 1958, he again offered his services to Khrushchev in unveiling ‘the truth’. He even promised to submit his memoirs for Party approval, as he was ‘more than prepared to introduce whatever changes were necessary’.25 Even posthumously, when the Soviet Academy of Sciences honoured the centenary of Maisky’s birth in 1984 with a symposium and a book devoted to his life and work, his memoirs were hailed, inter alia, as ‘a weapon in the struggle against the reactionary historiography’.26 The historical value of the memoirs was further compromised by the severe censorship they were subjected to in the first place. His servility became even more pronounced when he was forced to remove criticism of Stalin from the final Russian edition of his memoirs in 1971.27\n\nI n t roduc t ion xxi\n\nThe history of Maisky’s long ambassadorship in London is indeed breath-taking. Early in the nineteenth century the British diplomat Stratford Canning predicted that public opinion might turn out to be ‘a power more tremendous than was perhaps ever yet brought into action in the history of mankind’. His French colleague, Jules Cambon, an experienced diplomat, suggested that in getting to know a country fully, an ambassador should not confine himself to ministerial contacts, and on occasion might find that ‘even the friendship of women of high social standing would be of great value to him’. But it was really Maisky who heralded a revolutionary style of diplomacy, which at the time irritated many of his interlocutors, but which has since been so much in vogue. He certainly was the first ambassador to systematically manipulate and mould public opinion, mostly through the press. A guest at the embassy recalled seeing Maisky’s first secretary in the corridor ‘lecturing to Cummings, the political editor of News Chronicle, that his writings on the Finnish war had been “grossly exaggerated”’.28 A superb ‘public relations’ man at a time when the concept hardly existed, Maisky did not shy away from aligning himself with opposition groups, backbenchers, newspaper editors, trade unionists, writers, artists and intellectuals. ‘I have never known a representative of a foreign power,’ recalled John Rothenstein, the director of the Tate Gallery, ‘who spoke so disarmingly, as though his listener had his entire confidence, or who took so much trouble to make the policy, or the ostensible policy, of his Government understood by the politically insignificant. And unlike most of his Soviet colleagues he seemed very ready to form private friendships.’29 Iverach McDonald, the young foreign correspondent of The Times, left a captivating recollection of Maisky’s modus operandi: Most British officials were scandalised at the way Maisky would sail along, when it suited him, unhampered by normal diplomatic conventions … He would never hesitate, by means of timely and artful disclosures, to give his hearers ammunition which they could use against Chamberlain, John Simon, and the others. His luncheon parties could be formal and orthodox, or they could be like meetings of opposition cliques … Whenever I went to see him at his embassy in Millionaires’ Row, he seemed to have all the time in the world to talk to a young man. In a flattering way he would unplug his telephone as a sign we were not to be disturbed. Or he would take me down to the end of the garden, with Kensington Gardens just over the hedge, where we could walk and talk with all the benefits of warm sunshine and complete privacy.30 Maisky cultivated a significant segment of the British press with consummate skill. He read the whole British press, practically without exception, daily and weekly. His ‘grasp of day-by-day changes in thought and emotion and his genial but unruffled contemplation of the whole war in all its details,’ remarked an American journalist, rendered him ‘one of the most thoroughly competent observers’ in London.31 What an ambassador has to aim at, Maisky told his friend Beatrice Webb, ‘is intimate relations with all the live‑wires in the country to which he is accredited – among all parties or circles of influential opinion, instead of shutting himself up with the other diplomatists and the inner governing circle – whether royal or otherwise’. Naturally he was first and foremost his own government’s agent, but when he spoke in his quiet, often humorous,\n\nxxii\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n3. Maisky inseparable from the newspapers. way he always gave the impression of ‘speaking as an individual rather than a mere record of his master’s voice’. He used to boast that he could place a letter in The Times whenever he chose to.32 Courting the press magnate Lord Beaverbrook certainly paid off. His Daily Express hailed the rise of Stalin as a defender of Soviet national interests rather than of the idea of world revolution. In autumn 1936, Beaverbrook reminded Maisky of his newspapers’ ‘friendly attitude’ towards Stalin and promised that ‘nothing shall be done or said by any newspaper controlled by me which is likely to disturb your tenure of office’.33 In 1939, Beaverbrook strongly recommended that Maisky arrange for a young journalist from the Sunday Express to go to Russia. The journalist, he wrote to the ambassador, ‘follows in his Master’s footsteps in all his political opinions. Of course, it is commonly said that the Master follows after Maisky.’ Eventually Beaverbrook became the champion of a second front in 1942.34 Persuasion was often rewarded by boons. ‘I venture to keep my promise to you,’ Maisky wrote to Beaverbrook, ‘and hope you will find to your liking the sample of Russian vodka I am sending. My wife told you, I believe, something of the Russian liqueur called “Zapenkanka”, and she is enclosing a sample of that which she hopes you will enjoy.’35 William Camrose, editor of the conservative Daily Telegraph, clearly appreciated the ambassador’s yearly supply of Russian caviar for Christmas: My dear ambassador No gift could have come more appropriately or welcome than did the delightful cases of caviar which I received last night. If nothing else good ever came out of Russia, caviar alone has been a great gift to civilisation!… Very many thanks for your kind thought.36\n\nI n t roduc t ion xxiii\n\n4. Maisky entertaining high society at his residence in London. As did Vernon Bartlett, diplomatic correspondent of News Chronicle: My dear Ambassador, I only returned to London yesterday from a short holiday and found your very kind gift awaiting me. May I thank you most sincerely. My passion for caviar is enormous and ought not to be encouraged in this way.37 At the Foreign Office, they were extremely frustrated by the fact that ‘no restrictions were placed on [Maisky] to prevent him doing pretty well anything he likes’, and that he had and was making ‘very plentiful use of free access to all Cabinet Ministers and others’.38 And yet Alexander Cadogan, the permanent undersecretary of state, reluctantly admitted that ‘It has not yet been possible to detect any personal weakness of M. Maisky that would be gratified by a present from the Secretary of State or Prime Minister.’39 And none of the official remonstrations proved effective. Faced with harsh criticism for feeding the press with vital details from the secret negotiations of the NonIntervention Committee during the Spanish Civil War, Maisky commented in the diary: ‘I remained utterly calm as if the noises had nothing to do with me whatever.’ At the time, his tactics were resented as mischievous and a gross breach of diplomatic practice. And yet today, looking back, they hardly seem so outrageous.40 His ideological predilections drove Maisky to seek particularly close contacts with the City, which he assumed controlled British politics. As soon as he landed in London, he asked his old friend, H.G. Wells to organize an ‘informal meeting with a “few intelligent bankers” … so that there may be an opportunity for a proper talk’. Wells complied. ‘We\n\nxxiv\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n5. Dining with industrialists in Birmingham. have done nothing,’ he urged Brendan Bracken, ‘to gratify Maisky’s morbid craving to smack Bankers on their backs and call them by their Christian names.’41 Francis Williams, editor of the Daily Herald, recalls how he was caught off guard during a tête-à-tête delicious luncheon at the embassy by ‘a very agreeable and civilized conversation’ on the London theatre and literature. However, as soon as the ‘English-seeming butler’ had withdrawn, leaving them to coffee and brandy, Maisky spoke of his esteem for Williams’ City column. Williams confesses to having felt ‘a little uncomfortable’ when, after discovering the extent of German dealings in the City, Maisky went on to interrogate him about the general outlook of the City and the influence it exercised on the British government. It dawned on him, as he later admitted, ‘that in the most delicate possible way the extent of my “reliability” from the Russian point of view was being probed’. In parting, Maisky expressed the hope that he could lunch with the journalist in the future, and did not shrink from making the following proposal: I suppose you would not contemplate sending me written reports from time to time on City institutions and affairs in the City? I would find it very interesting if you could. There must be much that you do not find it possible to print. It would be most valuable and we (the ‘we’ was stressed ever so slightly) would be most grateful. This was supplemented every Christmas by a jar of caviar and a bottle of vodka with the ambassador’s personal compliments. Indeed, the grey zone between being\n\nI n t roduc t ion xxv\n\nrecruited and retaining a professional integrity was manifestly crossed by many of the leading publicists and journalists, if not politicians, as the diary clearly reveals.42 Then, as now, the legacy of preconceived ideas about Russia and its people – the most lethal feature of relations between Britain and Russia since the eighteenth century – rendered Maisky’s position in London particularly precarious. The severe hurdles which he had to face in accomplishing his mission reflected the long legacy of mistrust and suspicion characterizing Anglo-Russian relations. Ever since Russia’s emergence as a major power in the eighteenth century, the Western world has found it difficult to accept it as an integral part of Europe. This rebuff, embedded in a deeprooted Russophobic tradition, was now heightened by the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1839, Marquis de Custine, whose entire family had been sent to the guillotine, sought comfort in Russia, the bastion of monarchical rule in Europe. He came back appalled, warning his readers that the Russians were ‘Chinese masquerading as Europeans’. Two centuries later, Churchill referred to the Soviet Union as ‘a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma’. The continuity in the Western perception of Russia was likewise conspicuous in his choice of the ‘iron curtain’, a mere paraphrase of the ‘cordon sanitaire’, with which Lord Curzon had hoped to isolate Western civilization from the Bolshevik ‘epidemic’ in the wake of the revolution. Nor have the Russians been immune to xenophobia, or clear about their own identity and destiny. The debate, in various shapes and forms, has accompanied each twist in Russian history. From the early 1830s, the Russian intelligentsia pursued a fierce debate between the Westerners and the Slavophiles over the road which Russia should follow to surmount her political, social and economic backwardness. The revolution further demonized the Western bourgeoisie. Seen from both the Western and the Russian sides, vindictiveness and resentment gave birth to preconceived ideas and mutual suspicion, which in turn shaped policies and were the main contributors to the calamitous events described in Maisky’s diary. Although Maisky was universally acclaimed as perhaps the most outstanding and informed ambassador to the Court of St James’s, he was met with suspicion bordering on hostility. He was little helped by the wide popularity he enjoyed among the people, which became a source of ‘irritation and contempt’ in the higher echelons, where he was often referred to as ‘that little Tartar Jew’.43 Even friends could not refrain from alluding to his ‘subfallstaffian figure’. ‘He sits there in his ugly Victorian study,’ flowed the venomous ink of Harold Nicolson in his diary, ‘like a little gnome in an arm‑chair, twiddling his thumbs, twinkling his eyes and giving the impression that his feet do not reach the floor.’44 The ambivalence was perhaps best encapsulated in General Edward Spears’ observation of Maisky: ‘sturdily built, obviously very strong and clever, a typical Tartar and no doubt basically cruel as are the people of his race’ – oblivious to the fact that Maisky’s roots (at least on his father’s side) were Jewish-Polish from the Russian pale of settlement.45 Beatrice Webb, who was particularly close to Maisky, wondered what the aristocratic Eden, the fascist charmer Grandi, the Nazi bounder Von Ribbentrop feel towards the stocky, ugly Jew‑tartar Soviet emissary, who compares more to a shrewd business man negotiating in a world market than to a professional diplomatist manoeuvring among the governments of the world. Half the government and half the Foreign Office regard him as enemy No. 1.,\n\nxxvi\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\nwhilst the others glance nervously towards him as a possible ally in saving the British Empire from the militant envy of Germany and Italy.46 A graphic description of such perceptions appears in Harold Nicolson’s impressions of a lunch hosted by Maisky at the Soviet embassy: The door was opened by a gentleman in a soft collar and a stubby yellow moustache. I was ushered into a room of unexampled horror where I was greeted with effusion by Mr Maisky … We stood in this grim ante-room while we were given corked sherry, during which time the man with a yellow moustache and a moujik’s unappetizing daughter carried tableware and bananas into the room beyond. We then went into luncheon, which was held in a winter-garden, more wintery than gardeny. We began with caviar, which was all to the good. We then had a little wet dead trout. We then had what in nursing-homes is called ‘fruit jelly’ … During the whole meal, I felt that there was something terribly familiar about it all. It was certainly not the Russia of my memory. And then suddenly I realized it was the East. They were playing at being Europeans … They have gone oriental.47 The condescending attitude was widely shared. The director of the Tate Gallery remembered a similar event when … my own glass was filled and refilled so often by a member of the Embassy staff that I so far momentarily forgot the importance of the occasion as to say to him that there was something funny about the insignia of the Hammer and Sickle, which one was accustomed to see chalked upon factory walls and in public lavatories, being engraved with such elegance on such magnificent table silver. This diplomat, who had not neglected his own glass, oblivious of the impertinence of my words, gave me a mournful stare, and indicating with his thumb the insignia on the handle of a fork said thickly, ‘It used to be birds’ – an allusion to the eagles of Imperial Russia.48 However, to others, such as the Labourite Herbert Morrison, Maisky appeared to be ‘a cogent talker’ who could ‘argue reasonably and vividly, but with an almost Western objectivity which made discussion with him, in contrast with the case of most communists, stimulating and useful’.49 Likewise Rab Butler (then undersecretary of state for foreign affairs) recognized that Maisky was ‘certainly the most pertinacious’ of all foreign representatives in London. Bernard Pares, the doyen of the British historians of Russia, marvelled at Maisky who had ‘never given [him] any forecast which did not prove true’.50 Finally, Bruce Lockhart, an old hand at Russian affairs, conceded that Maisky ‘certainly knew his England thoroughly, indeed too thoroughly for some people. But when I said goodbye, I thought that we might wait long before we were sent as good a Russian ambassador.’51 Unlike the reserved and harsh demeanour which characterized the later ‘Stalinist school of diplomacy’, Maisky and Agniya worked as a team and did their utmost to\n\nI n t roduc t ion xxvii\n\n6. Agniya Maisky, the ever-charming hostess.\n\n7. Reverent Agniya – the genuine Bolshevik – unveils a plaque at a house in London where Lenin lived. influence British public opinion by a display of sheer friendliness. Conservatives were just as welcome at their luncheon parties as Labourites. When Maisky arrived in London, he asked Bruce Lockhart to introduce him to the London society. Lockhart expressed surprise, suggesting that Maisky surely knew the British socialists better than he did. ‘Yes,’ replied Maisky, ‘but I want to meet more of the people who are running this\n\nxxviii\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\ncountry.’ At first Maisky’s receptions were ‘filled with Leftists dressed in queer clothes … gradually the guests had progressed from red ties to stiff shirts and evening dress, until one evening H.G. Wells who had come to a large party in an ordinary day suit found himself the only person so dressed’.52 Indeed Maisky lost few of his British friends even in the most difficult period, during the Soviet–German pact and the Soviet–Finnish war. Louis Fischer, the well-informed international journalist, commented on how Maisky ‘diligently and with infinite care … cultivated numerous important individuals in British political life’, while ‘his attractive wife added to his popularity in high society’.53 Agniya was omnipresent in his life, and on the rare occasion when she indulged herself with a shopping expedition, staying longer in Paris en route from a League of Nations meeting in Geneva, he would seem to lose his bearings. ‘My dearest Turchik,’ he wrote to her on one such occasion, I am bored to death. It’s not just that I am alone, completely alone within the four walls of this flat, but also that up to yesterday I didn’t even go down to the street … I’m reading a lot, listening to the radio and to records. Marusiya is feeding me well enough and the domestic side of things is in general ‘all right’ … Can’t wait to see you again soon. I kiss my dear sweet Turchik hard, and wait for her impatiently. Mikhailichi.54 The image they projected was of ‘strongly contrasting temperaments: she was gay, confident and an uncompromising revolutionary, he was quiet, with an occasional air of apprehension, and, though a loyal and devoted ambassador, rather liberal in his outlook’.55 Like her husband, Agniya seems to have been lured by the comfort and the glittering facet of life in London. Herbert Morrison observed that she ‘enjoyed her stay in London, for she admired the Londoners and liked their ways. I remember at a reception at the Soviet Embassy obliging her as best I could when she begged me to teach her the Lambeth Walk.56 She always remembered it.’57 A woman of ‘conventional charm and good manners, pretty’ and ‘attractively dressed’, she was criticized in parliament for ‘spending 1,500 guineas on a mink coat’ while the Russian armies were ‘being battered by the Germans’ and money was being raised by her in the factories for the Red Cross.58 In the late 1920s, Narkomindel had set up a sartorial and dressmaking establishment to produce garments for the wives, as well as for the diplomats themselves. They were, observed Beatrice Webb (who was attracted by high couture), ‘carefully designed according to the fashions prevalent at the courts or capitals concerned. Which accounts for the elegance of Madame Maisky and Madame Litvinoff, much commented on in the fashion papers.’ This was not the case with the ambassador, whose ‘stocky figure’, she observed, was often dressed ‘in a holiday attire, loose light garments of the most unconventional cut and colour’. Far more ideologically militant than her husband, Agniya could at times be pugnacious and allow her emotions to run wild. At a reception at Buckingham Palace she came across one of the Russian empress’s ladies in waiting wearing a medallion with the tsarina’s portrait. It was rumoured that she ‘spat on the picture’.59 It is most amazing to glean from Maisky’s diary how much room for manoeuvre was left for ambassadors, even under Stalin’s most ruthless authoritarian regime. Many of his initiatives were adopted as policy, at times even against the prevailing views held in the\n\nI n t roduc t ion xxix\n\nKremlin – the most striking examples being his unstinting support for the negotiation of a triple alliance with the West in early 1939 and the campaign for the second front in 1941–43. To get his way, Maisky often had to attribute his own ideas to his interlocutors, although the archives show that it was he who had initiated them. I have drawn the reader’s attention to a handful of such instances in my commentary. A typical example would be Maisky’s attempts to discourage Stalin from moving towards isolation and Nazi Germany following the exasperating experience of the Munich Agreement. He was not as successful in his attempts to halt Stalin and Litvinov from retreating from Spain. In the diary entry of 1 October 1938, he describes the advice he had given the government to adhere to collective security by citing a conversation with Lloyd George (well manipulated by him) who apparently exclaimed: ‘Just don’t leave Spain, whatever you do!’, further urging that ‘isolationism would be a bad policy for the USSR’.60 It was Maisky who early on warned of the impact the purges were having on British public opinion, proposing that justice should be seen to be done through public trials. Later he went on to warn Moscow of the dire impact of the purges of the military on the prospects for concluding a triple alliance.61 He also engineered Eden’s ground-breaking trip to Moscow and his meeting with Stalin in 1935, preferring him to Lord Simon, the then foreign secretary.62 As early as the end of 1937, Maisky advised Stalin how to address the appeasers: ‘Let “Western democracies” reveal their hand in the matter of the aggressors. What is the point of us pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for them? To fight together – by all means; to serve as cannon fodder for them – never!’ Stalin indeed repeated the ambassador’s words almost verbatim in his famous speech of March 1939.63 During his heyday in London, after the German attack on Russia, it was Maisky who forged the alliance when paralysis struck the Kremlin, prompting Churchill’s famous speech and paving the way\n\n8.

As most of those sources are easily available in print, they have been largely excluded from the present collection. On a few occasions, the long reports of conversations in the diary served Maisky as the basis for his official reports, some of which have previously been published, but only in Russian compilations. The introductory biographical notes about individuals appear on first mention. In most cases, the reference is to the position held by the individual during the period covered by the diary. To help the reader grasp the impact of the purges on the diplomatic corps, an attempt has been made to trace the fate of those at the London embassy and among the old cadre of Narkomindel who were purged during the repression. I have broadly followed the transliteration guidelines of the Library of Congress, with various simplifications. The two most important exceptions are: ‘ю’ is rendered throughout the diary as ‘yu’ (not ‘iu’), and ‘я’ as ‘ya’ (not ‘ia’). To remain faithful to the conventions of the time, the endings of proper names in ‘ий’ are transcribed throughout as ‘y’, not ‘ii’ (Maisky, Trotsky, etc.). Chinese transliteration follows pinyin; names that are perhaps better known in some other transliteration system are also given in the biographical notes. Strictly speaking, until 1946 the title of the Soviet foreign minister was people’s commissar for foreign affairs, while that of Soviet ambassadors was polpred. I have employed mostly the Western terms, which were used indiscriminately, even by the ambassadors themselves at the time.\n\nThe Making of a Soviet Diplomat\n\nIvan Mikhailovich Lyakhovetsky was born on 7 January 1884 in the ancient Russian town of Kirillov, near Nizhny-Novgorod, in the comfortable environment of a nobleman’s castle, where his father was a tutor to the son of the family. Maisky (Man of May), was a nom de plume he assumed in 1909 while in exile in Germany. His childhood was spent in Siberia, in Omsk, where his father, having studied medicine in St Petersburg, served as a medical officer.1 His father was of Jewish Polish descent, a fact which Maisky preferred to conceal. In his enchanting childhood memoirs he went a long way to stress the atheist atmosphere at home, but made the point that ‘officially, of course, we were considered to be Orthodox … as a schoolboy I was obliged to learn the catechism in class, to attend Vespers on Saturdays and Mass on Sundays, and to go to confession without fail before Easter’. Maisky, though, would find it difficult to shake off the ‘Jewish image’. Both in England and in the Soviet Union he was often perceived to be Jewish. The nephew of the famous Russian historian, Evgeny Tarle, recalled that his aunt, who ‘had a nose for Jews who’d been promoted at the time of the proletarian revolution’, confided in him that she thought ‘Maisky wasn’t really called Maisky, let alone “Ivan Mikhailovich”: “Isaak Moiseevich”, more likely’. Victor Gollancz, the Jewish leftist publisher, remembered Maisky telling ‘wonderful Jewish stories, which he called Armenian, and loved listening to mine, which he called Armenian too’.2 His father’s ‘secret love’ and the ‘mainspring of his soul’ was the ‘passion for science’. He served as a formidable role model for Maisky and as a source of inspiration for an insatiable intellectual aptitude and curiosity, professional dedication and unbridled ambition. His father’s rigidity and somewhat reserved nature were cushioned by Maisky’s mother, Nadezhda Ivanovna (née Davydova), who was a village teacher with a strong literary and artistic proclivity. In his memoirs, Maisky depicts her fondly as being ‘of a choleric temperament – lively, inconsistent, quick-tempered and talkative … She had something unique in herself, a kind of charm, which attracted people to her and easily made her the centre of attention.’ Maisky was exposed to literature from an early age. The packed bookshelves at home housed beautifully bound collected works of Shakespeare, Byron and Schiller, as well as the writing of the more radical intelligentsia such as Nekrasov, Dobrolyubov, Herzen and Pisarev. Maisky was well aware of the debate raging at the time on the purpose of literature and art, and on realism and aestheticism. Though claiming in later years, for obvious reasons, to have sided with the ‘utilitarians’, the young Ivan uncritically devoured ‘stacks of books and periodicals’. He was particularly captivated by Heine, his\n\nxxxii\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\n9. Jan Lyakhovetsky (Maisky) with his younger sister. lifetime compass and companion, whose portrait was to hang over his desk. Barely sixteen years of age, he expressed this admiration in a letter to Elizaveta, his confidante cousin: I have never seen a finer face than Heine’s. Every day I discover more and more excellence in Heine and I am convinced that his perpetually satirical, perpetually sceptical Aristophanes of the nineteenth century is one of the greatest geniuses and judges of the human soul in general, and of the people of our times in particular. Heine is humanity. He personifies it to perfection as nobody else has done. In him is reflected all the good and bad in humanity, the wide and motley panorama of the human marketplace, all its suffering and sorrow, all its anger and indignation.3 The literary atmosphere at home refined Maisky’s acute powers of observation, which were enhanced by his rich imagination and his curiosity. It helped forge his complex personality, which, while romantic and artistic, was also governed by a belief in ‘reason, science, knowledge, and the right of man to be master of life on earth’.4 The novels opened a window on Europe and awakened in Maisky a longing for travel and an interest in geography which would gradually shape his cosmopolitan outlook once in exile. That particular inquisitiveness was enriched by exposure to the bustling life of Omsk’s port, where Maisky spent any free moment he had strolling about the wharves and by the steamers, ‘looking at everything, listening and nosing about … I listened\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xxxiii\n\nto the stories of the pilots and sailors about their work and adventures and about the distant towns and places they visited.’5 In reconstructing a revolutionary past, Maisky would later identify a rebellious streak in the family – a dissident member of the clergy who went off the rails and joined certain revolutionary circles in the mid-nineteenth century. Likewise he would claim that his own parents sympathized with the Populist movement, that his mother had even ‘gone down to the people’, and that his father had come into conflict with the authorities at the hospital he worked in over his failure to prevent the young medical cadets from expressing revolutionary ideas in 1905. He makes much of the special relationship he cultivated with his artist uncle, M.M. Chemodanov, who worked as a zemstvo doctor in a remote village and was mildly involved in revolutionary activities. However, at its core, Maisky’s background and education were typical of the professional middle class, devoid of any political awareness.6 Having graduated from the local gymnasium (grammar school) at the age of 17 with a gold medal, Maisky enrolled at St Petersburg University, where he read history and philology. His literary talents were noticed around that time, when his first poem, ‘I Wish to Be a Great Thunderstorm’, was published in Siberian Life under the pseudonym ‘New Man’. His university education at St Petersburg, however, came to an abrupt and premature end when he was arrested and charged with revolutionary agitation.7 He was put under police surveillance in Omsk, where he joined the Menshevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Movement. In 1906 he was detained once again for taking an active part in the 1905 revolution, and was sentenced to exile in Tobolsk, where he produced a manuscript inspired by Sidney and Beatrice Webb and their History of Trade Unionism. Maisky had stumbled upon this by sheer chance when he was a student in St Petersburg. He would later confess to the Webbs that it ‘greatly contributed to my political education and to a certain extent helped me to find the path which I followed in my subsequent life’. ‘Never indeed,’ he wrote to his cousin in 1901, ‘have I read any novel with such a thrill as the Webbs’ book! How feeble, miserable and nonsensical all\n\n10. A model pupil in the gymnasium (front row, fifth from the right).\n\nxxxiv\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\n11. The breeding of a revolutionary: Maisky as a student at St Petersburg University. my former literary enthusiasms seem to me!’8 The evolutionary Fabian stream, with its strong social-humanist bent, suited Maisky’s temperament and served him as a political beam of light. Its residue was always close to the surface, even when he had to break with his Menshevik past and display loyalty to Bolshevism. Once in England, he cultivated intimate relations with the Webbs which lasted until their death, as is well attested in both his and Beatrice Webb’s diaries. Maisky’s sentence was eventually commuted to exile abroad. In his memoirs, written under the cloud of the purges in the wake of the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact (when his stock was low in Moscow), Maisky claims that his desire to emigrate was driven by a wish to study ‘socialism and the European workers’ movement’. However, the attraction of exile seems to have been more profound, revealing a cosmopolitan streak and a prodigious curiosity which can be traced back to his childhood, when he used to accompany his father – who believed that ‘nothing develops a child so much as travel and getting to know new places, new people, new races and customs’ – on his distant missions across Siberia. When the family moved to St Petersburg for a year, we find the nine-year-old Ivan still fascinated, ‘standing a long while on the granite quays of the Neva, watching the complicated manoeuvres of the Finnish boats, the loading of foreign ships, the tiny Finnish steamers darting briskly in all directions like dark blue beetles’. His exile further enhanced an enduring admiration for European (particularly German) culture, as he openly confessed in a letter to his mother: ‘I am still extremely happy with being abroad. I feel that I am growing quickly and powerfully here, in mind and in spirit. And, in fact, I’m almost grateful to the circumstances which have forced\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xxxv\n\nme to quit Russian soil.’9 ‘I like travel,’ he confessed to Bernard Shaw years later, ‘and I have travelled much over Europe and Asia … When I see people boarding a train, a ship or a plane, I feel a sort of romantic glow.’10 After a brief stay in Switzerland, Maisky settled in Munich, then the hub for Russian immigrants and artists, notably Kandinsky and his circle. Though associated with the Russian revolutionary movement, Maisky was as much involved in the activities of the German Social Democratic Party and the trade unions. He obtained his Master’s degree in economics at Munich University, and was well on with his doctoral dissertation when the gathering clouds of war led to an unanticipated and fateful new emigration – to London. The nomadic life suited his nature: After Germany, it’ll be very good to get acquainted with life and people in the United Kingdom, and ultimately I don’t mind where I live: Munich or London. On the way to England I’ll stop off for a week in Paris, to have a look at the city … And then I’ll head on from there to the British capital. I go to new countries with great interest and great expectations; we’ll see whether the latter come true. Ultimately, I think the main charm in life is a constant change of impressions, and nothing aids that so much as travel, rapid movement from one place to another.11 However, Maisky’s first encounter with London in November 1912, rather belied his later fascination with England. His Russian upbringing and life in the German socialist milieu did not predispose him to the kind of blind admiration for British liberalism that seized many of the romantic exiles of the nineteenth century. London, he felt, ‘swallowed and suffocated’ him. He did not know the language and felt lost in that ‘giant stone ocean’.12 Indeed, those early gloomy impressions are evident in a letter to his mother: Of course, I find London very interesting – from the political and socio-economic points of view – and I’m not at all sorry that I’m spending the current winter here. But I wouldn’t want to stop in these parts too long. Just the thought of getting stuck here permanently brings on a freezing ennui. No, I definitely don’t like London! It’s huge, dark, dirty, uncomfortable, with boring rows of identical little houses, permanently shrouded in fog … You don’t see the sun here for weeks, and that’s terribly depressing. I now understand why spleen is called the English disease, and I also understand why Heine so disliked the country of the proud Britons. ‘The ocean would have swallowed England long ago,’ he once commented, ‘if it weren’t afraid of an upset stomach.’ And he wasn’t far wrong: to digest a ‘nut’ like England wouldn’t be that easy.13 And yet the years in London and his friendship with Georgii Vasilevich Chicherin and Maksim Maksimovich Litvinov (who, for two decades, as commissars for foreign affairs, were to steer Soviet foreign policy) were to have a profound impact on Maisky’s later career. The three were brought together by Litvinov’s future wife, Ivy, who was born in London, the product of an implausible union between a Jewish intellectual and an Indian army colonel’s daughter. A non-conformist writer and rebel, she found solace from her\n\nxxxvi\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\ndespised employment (with an insurance firm) at the Golders Green home of her aunt and uncle, the Eders, who were left-wing thinkers. They held lively intellectual soirées, with revolutionaries, Freudians, Fabians and literary figures such as Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells.14 It was at the Eders’ house that Maisky, a frequent visitor, cemented his friendship with Litvinov and Chicherin.15 The three lived just around the corner from each other, first in Golders Green and then in Hampstead Heath, amidst a thriving colony of political exiles who found a bond with one another, regardless of the schism within the Russian socialist movement. Chicherin, whose aristocratic family could trace its origins and name to an Italian courtier who had settled in Russia at the time of Tsar Ivan III, had worked in the archives of the tsarist foreign minister. He was something of a polymath, endowed with an encyclopaedic memory. A renaissance man, well versed in literature and culture, he was also a fine pianist and the author of a highly acclaimed book on Mozart’s operas. He cut an eccentric and ascetic figure in London, leading a rather bohemian life. The conscience-stricken Chicherin had initially been a disciple of Tolstoy, before he joined the Russian revolutionary movement in exile, leaning towards Menshevism. This shortlived deviation did not deter Lenin from later appointing him commissar for foreign affairs. His signature would adorn the Brest-Litovsk and Rapallo agreements, the pillars of Soviet diplomacy. Litvinov, who had an obscure Jewish background and did not entertain any intellectual pretensions, was later to be meticulous in his work in Narkomindel (the Soviet Foreign Ministry), fastidiously observing the rules and etiquette of diplomatic work, and almost dismissive of the ideological constraints imposed on him. Surprisingly, despite his conspicuous personal contempt for Chicherin, the two were able to work together harmoniously for almost a decade. By the time they met in England, Litvinov, who was only eight years older than Maisky, had already gained a reputation as a seasoned revolutionary. It was therefore only natural for him to become Maisky’s mentor, introducing him to the country, its political institutions, its culture and a wide circle of people. What most endeared Litvinov to Maisky was his strong character, as well as his ability to grasp the essentials of a question without getting bogged down in the details, and his penchant for irony. The outbreak of the First World War, however, brought an estrangement between the two which was to mar their future working relationship. While Litvinov adopted Lenin’s position and was in favour of militant defeatism, Maisky sided with the Menshevik’s internationalist pacifist position, which sought an end to the war. For a while, Maisky even displayed great interest in the then all-encompassing popular ideas of the ‘Middle Europe’ movement, propagated by F. Neumann, which tried to merge the two most powerful waves of German history – the national-bourgeois wave and the socially oriented proletarian. It further sought to synthesize the precepts of Christianity with German idealism, humanism with class solidarity, and democracy.16 Maisky’s ingrained pragmatism and humanistic outlook, further enhanced by his English experience, came to the fore as the First World War dragged on. He was particularly obsessed with the fate of Western civilization and the European intelligentsia, who were being slaughtered in great numbers on the front line, and wanted humanism to be placed before any party considerations. ‘You see,’ he responded to a rebuke from Julius Martov, the Menshevik leader,\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xxxvii\n\n12. Ivy and Maksim Litvinov sipping tea with Ivan and Agniya at the Soviet embassy, 1935.\n\nthe longer the war drags on, the more a very serious danger appears before the belligerent nations: an enormous number of intellectuals – writers, artists, ­scholars, engineers, etc. – will die on the battlefields. The countries are exhausting their spiritual aristocracy, without which, whatever you say, no mental, social or political progress is possible … Of course, any losses are difficult to bear: losses of peasants, losses of workers, etc.; but I still think that losses among the intelligentsia are, in relative terms, the hardest, because they are the most difficult to make good. The intelligentsia is a fruit that grows slowly, and it might need a whole generation before the depletion in its ranks caused by the war is even partly put right. That’s why I think that a period has now begun when nations, for their own self-preservation, will have to protect intellectuals the way they protect, for instance, skilled mechanics, chemists, trained armaments workers, etc.17 Although Maisky is at pains to demonstrate in his diary (and even more so in his autobiography) the kinship and warmth that characterized his relations with Litvinov – a presentation that has led historians to pair the two – at times that relationship was troubled. Their temperaments were hardly compatible, and Litvinov did not shy away from rebuking Maisky, criticizing his essays on foreign affairs; on several occasions he even complained about him to Stalin.18 It was typical of Litvinov to keep people at arm’s length, though much of this was a deep-seated disdain for the cosmopolitan intellectuals. ‘Litvinov had no friends,’ recalled Gustav Hilger, a veteran and well-informed counsellor at the German embassy in Moscow. ‘There was one member of the kollegia of the Foreign Commissariat with whom I had established a relationship of mutual confidence. I asked\n\nxxxviii\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\nhim once how he got along with Litvinov, and received the significant answer “You don’t get along with Litvinov; you only work with him – if you have no other choice.”’19 Moreover, Litvinov detested those diplomats (and Maisky was certainly one of them) who sought the limelight. ‘Dignity’, it was said of him, ‘came natural to him … Flattery and bootlicking were entirely foreign. Nor could he bear these traits in others.’20 And yet they shared a common view of the international scene in the 1930s, and Litvinov did not shy away from supporting Maisky and even shielding him from the repressions which engulfed the ministry in 1938.21 Maisky was to continue to cultivate the special relationship which had been forged in exile. Congratulating Litvinov on his negotiations in Washington, which would lead in 1934 to American recognition of the Soviet Union, Maisky wrote: ‘Perhaps it’s because you and I are joined by a 20-year acquaintance and by the years of emigration we shared in London that I always follow your work and your speeches on the Soviet and international arena with a very special interest and an emotion of an almost personal character … Our long acquaintance gives me the right to tell you frankly things which, in other circumstances, could only seem out of place.’22 Maisky’s relations with Aleksandra M. Kollontay, the flamboyant and militant feminist and a future Soviet ambassador to Norway and then Sweden, at whose house he first met Litvinov, were entirely different. With her he maintained a warm personal friendship throughout his life. ‘I find it interesting to be with Maisky,’ Kollontay noted in her diary, ‘because we don’t only talk business. He is a lively man with eyes, mind and feelings open to perception of life in all its manifestations and in all fields. He isn’t a boring, narrow-minded person who doesn’t step beyond current business and issues.’23 Shortly after the February revolution of 1917, which brought down the tsarist regime, Maisky returned to Russia and was asked by Aleksandr Kerensky to join the Provisional Government as the deputy minister of labour. His politics were fast veering to the right of the Menshevik Party. In the wake of the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks, in January 1918, and the outbreak of the Civil War, Maisky failed to convince the Mensheviks to support the Samara-based Committee for the Reconvocation of the Assembly (Komuch) in its struggle against the Bolsheviks. His appeal to them was in keeping with his belief – a legacy of his European social-democratic experience – that staying neutral in the Civil War was ‘contrary to human nature and logic’, and that the Komuch government, composed of refugees from the Assembly, was a ‘democratic counter-revolution’. Acting on his personal convictions, Maisky defied the party, and in July 1918 crossed the front line to join the forlorn Komuch government as its minister for labour. He thus emerged as the champion of the sole armed socialist insurgence against Bolshevism.24 This was a move that would haunt him for the rest of his life and would lead to an ignominious repentance, which was dismissed by the Mensheviks as ‘memoirs of a renegade’. The ‘newly baptized’ convert was duly expelled from Menshevik ranks and admitted to his adopted church, branded with the eternal mark of Cain.25 When the White Admiral Kolchak seized control of the rebel government in 1919, persecuting the socialists, Maisky had to flee again, this time to Mongolia. His year in Mongolia, spent ‘crossing Genghis Khan’s former homeland on horseback and camel-\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xxxix\n\nback … among the deserted mountains and steppes, far from the political struggle, the heated public atmosphere, the influence of party traditions and prejudices’, made him reflect on the nature of the revolution – and on his own personal future.26 Maisky’s earlier timid and procrastinating attempts in summer 1919 to break with the past and make it up with the Bolsheviks – undertaken at a time when their fate was still hanging in the balance – were regarded as inadequate contrition.27 A year later he wrote to People’s Commissar for Education A.V. Lunacharsky, whom he had befriended during his years in exile: I now see that the Mensheviks were virtuous but talentless pupils of the past, timid imitators of long-outlived models, thinking in old clichés and formulae from books, without that precious feel for life, feel for the epoch … The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, excelled in boldness and originality, felt no particular piety towards the behests of the past or towards dogmatic incantations. They were flexible, practical and decisive … they spoke a new word in the field of revolutionary creativity, they created new forms of state, of economic life, and of social relations … which others lacked the boldness to realize.28 Throughout his life, and particularly during the dark days of the ‘great terror’, Maisky’s earlier association with the Mensheviks, and particularly the role he played in the Civil War (something that was meticulously glossed over in his memoirs and writings), cast a huge shadow over his career and credibility in Moscow. The constructed narrative of his conversion to Bolshevism that he sent to Lunacharsky – atonement for his failure to recognize the Bolshevik Revolution as a legitimate socialist one – concealed the torment of soul-searching which the transition involved and which was never to be fully resolved. Maisky’s inner conflict was reflected in The Peaks (Vershiny), a four-act drama in verse which revealed the everlasting romantic nature of his thinking, deeply immersed as it was in the nineteenth-century universal humanist tradition of the Russian intelligentsia and coloured by utopian visions. The distinctive codex of the intelligentsia was the formation of a Russian intellectual, independent of his class origin. The title page of The Peaks bore an epigraph from Maisky’s favourite poet, Heinrich Heine, in German with a Russian translation: ‘We want to create the kingdom of heaven here, on earth!’ Its theme was ‘humanity’s endless movement towards the glittering peaks of knowledge and freedom, which were visible and beautiful, but which could never be reached, because the movement was endless’. The extent to which Maisky genuinely repented and fully identified with the Bolsheviks (as he manifestly claimed to do in the first volume of his memoirs, written in dire circumstances in 1939–40) is hard to ascertain. In a selfreflective mood, Maisky related with empathy to Chicherin’s account of his conversion to Bolshevism which seemed to be a mirror image of how he felt: ‘Although I was once a Menshevik our ways have parted. The war has taught me a lot and now all my sympathies are on the side of the Russian Jacobins.’ He hesitated for a moment and then added: ‘I mean the Bolsheviks.’ I cannot be certain that at the time of this conversation Georgii Vasilevich was a convinced Bolshevik.29\n\nxl\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\n13. Maisky visiting his Fabian socialist idol and intimate friend Beatrice Webb at her countryside home. Later on, in her diary, Beatrice Webb, one of Maisky’s few trusted and intimate friends, painted a succinct and precise picture of Maisky’s intellectual and political character: Certainly Maisky is one of the most open minded of Marxists, and is fully aware of the misfits in Marxian terminology – scholastic and dogmatic. But then he has lived abroad among infidels and philistines and his mind has been perhaps slightly contaminated by the foreign sophistical agnostic outlook on the closed universe of the Moscow Marxians.30 Concerned with the ‘earthly punishments’ awaiting him in Moscow for his ‘political sins’, Maisky hoped to secure through Lunacharsky an amnesty for his past and a guarantee of safe passage as surety ‘against arrest, search, conscription, etc., on the road’. Lunacharsky passed on The Peaks and the covering letter to Lenin, recommending rehabilitation and even admittance to the Bolshevik Party. The Politburo approved, though in guarded terms, suggesting that Maisky’s expertise in economics should ‘first be used in the provinces’. He was accordingly instructed to proceed to Omsk, where he eventually established the first Siberian State Plan (Gosplan). Meanwhile his repentance was published in Pravda.31 Maisky’s ambitions, however, were intellectual rather than political. They led him at the first possible opportunity to Moscow, where he immediately established contact with Chicherin and Litvinov – ‘for old times’ sake’, as he later recalled,32 but clearly in the hope of enhancing his credibility, which had been shattered by his association with the Mensheviks.33 He grudgingly accepted a proposal to become head of the press department of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (Narkomindel), regarding the position as merely a springboard to greater things. At the ministry he met Agniya\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xli\n\nAleksandrovna Skipina, a strong-willed socialist activist, who was to become his third wife (a brief earlier marriage had produced a daughter, who went to live with her mother in St Petersburg and with whom Maisky, who had no further children, maintained sporadic contact; he had also had a short marriage of convenience to help a Russian stranded in London). Hardly had he settled in his new post than Maisky quarrelled with Lev Karakhan,34 Chicherin’s protégé, seeking his dismissal. Having failed to achieve his goal, he did succeed in steering Molotov, then the organizational secretary of the party’s Central Committee, to send him to Petrograd, where he briefly acted as the deputy editor of Petrogradskaya Pravda. This interlude as second fiddle ended in harsh discord with the chief editor, who, as Maisky complained to Molotov, had ‘taken care to make it impossible for [him] to work at the paper’. A brief spell as editor of the social and literary journal Zvezvda (The Star) came to a similar end in early 1925, following a squabble within the editorial board. On the whole, life in Leningrad did not agree with Maisky (or, more likely, with his young wife). He felt, as he explained to Molotov, like an ‘outsider … a second-class citizen’. In the relatively calm days of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Maisky could still comfortably manoeuvre his career, informing Molotov that he was ‘seriously contemplating returning’ to work in Narkomindel.35 Maisky’s first steps in his Bolshevik career revealed an inflated self-esteem, marked by a sense of intellectual superiority and a stubbornness which did not endear him to his colleagues and superiors and often set him on a collision course with them. Although the survival instinct somewhat suppressed those traits during the oppressive 1930s, they would nonetheless keep resurfacing throughout his ambassadorship in London, particularly in his encounters with British officials. Back in Moscow, Maisky’s fraternal relations with Litvinov, who was gradually taking over from Chicherin as the strong man in Narkomindel, proved propitious. In 1925 he was appointed counsellor at the Soviet embassy in London, a position which he clearly cherished. As he wrote to his mother, he and his wife Agniya: have taken a small house where no one else lives, we have a maid and we look after our own household … Agniya is learning singing and English and she’s starting to chatter a little in English. Our house is in one of the best London suburbs, next to the botanical garden, the air is beautiful, but it’s just a shame we don’t get more chance to enjoy it.36 But his stay in London was again marred by poor relations with his superiors at the embassy. Maisky opted to go back to Moscow, but within a year was persuaded by Litvinov to return to the embassy. Those were turbulent years in Anglo-Soviet relations, following the ‘Zinoviev letter’ affair of 1924 and the ‘Russian gold’ contribution to the miners during the General Strike of 1926. There was a fear in Moscow of a rupture in relations, and perhaps even of renewed military intervention. Matters were further exacerbated by the premature death of Leonid Krasin, the Soviet ambassador in London. As one of the few revolutionaries fluent in English and well versed in British affairs, Maisky found his services required. It is rarely recognized that, with no ambassador in London, as counsellor Maisky actually functioned as the de facto polpred. ‘In the old days,’ he\n\nxlii\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\nboasted in a letter to his father, ‘a counsellor would have figured very high on the “table of ranks”. Nowadays, the table of ranks has lost any significance for us; however, I can assure you that the work of a counsellor in a place like London is highly interesting and important … London today is the powerful centre of world politics which can only be compared to Moscow.’37 His enforced departure from England, following the severance of diplomatic relations in May 1927, left Maisky, as he confided to C.P. Scott, the proRussian editor of the Manchester Guardian, with ‘a feeling very much akin to personal grief’. His years in exile in London and the experience in the embassy had led him ‘to understand and respect British culture, which, although so unlike Russian Culture, contains much which is both valuable and great’.38 After six weeks of rest and treatment ‘on doctors’ orders’ at the Kislovodsk sanatorium in the Caucasus, Maisky was appointed counsellor at the Soviet embassy in Tokyo, where he spent the next two years. For a while, the appointment suited him well. ‘I arrived in Tokyo at the end of October,’ he wrote to H.G. Wells, ‘and at the present time look around with the greatest possible interest studying this most extraordinary country, which some twenty years ago gave you a good deal of inspiration to write “Modern Utopia”.’ Writing to the left-wing publicist Henry Brailsford, Maisky hailed Japan as a ‘unique country … combining in some extraordinary manner Oriental Mediaeval with the most modern Americanism … Add to this beauty of Nature, “Eigentumlichkeit” of people, of habits and customs … No wonder that so far I had no reasons to complain that our Foreign Office has sent me to this country.’39 Always indignant when placed in a subordinate position, Maisky was glad to see the Soviet ambassador transferred to Paris, as this put him (temporarily at least) in charge of the embassy. His experience in Japan helped shape his views on diplomacy, and particularly the belief that diplomats should be fully immersed in the culture and language of the country they were posted to.40 As a way of introducing the Russian\n\n14. Apprenticeship at the Tokyo embassy.\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xliii\n\npublic to Japanese culture, he organized an extensive visit by the leading Kabuki theatre to Russia, which encountered resistance within Japanese conservative circles. Indeed, during the troupe’s first performance back in Japan, following its triumphant tour of Russia, hired thugs released ‘live snakes under chairs all around the hall, just before it began. During the show, the snakes began hissing and crawling amidst the audience. A fearful panic broke out. Men snarled, women shrieked, children cried, the curtain had to be lowered and the performance was interrupted.’41 Several months later, once again in a subordinate position far from Moscow and Europe, and on the fringes of diplomacy, Maisky was feeling depressed. Moreover, as would be manifested time and again, he was easily led by the whims of his wife, who, he confided to a friend, was ‘feeling herself insignificant: primarily unemployed’.42 The embassy had become a hotbed of intrigue and calumny. Agniya and the wife of the trade representative were ‘at daggers drawn’ as to who should be the ‘First Lady’ at state functions. This antagonism between the two, which led to a flurry of correspondence between the embassy and Narkomindel, was not settled in Agniya’s favour, and split the Russian colony into factions.43 Barely a year into his mission, Maisky complained to Chicherin that living in Japan was ‘generally dull and wearisome: there is little political work (not enough for two), and any even slightly important question is dealt with in Moscow’. By now, however, Chicherin was ravaged by severe diabetes and was losing his grip on Narkomindel.44 Maisky therefore turned to Litvinov with an explicit demand for a prompt transfer, motivated by the Ménière’s disease which had troubled his wife since their sojourn in London and which, he claimed, had got worse in Tokyo, leaving her deaf in one ear. He further complained about the havoc which the weather in Tokyo was playing with his own health. Though it was up to the Collegium of Narkomindel to decide on his future appointment, Maisky did not fight shy of stating his own preference for spending a year or two in Moscow (though he was quick to add that he had ‘no objection whatsoever to returning to the West’). Litvinov responded favourably, proposing an ambassadorial role in Kovno, which he presented as the fourth most important post after Berlin, Paris and Warsaw. He was, however, also prepared to discuss alternatives if the offer did not appeal to Maisky. It is remarkable that, at the turn of the decade, it was still possible for a Soviet diplomat to dictate his own terms of employment. It was with great relief that Maisky received the news of the Politburo’s decision to withdraw him from Tokyo in January 1929. ‘Your attitude,’ he wrote to Litvinov in his now familiar supercilious yet cunning way, ‘inevitably invigorates my “Narkomindel patriotism” and wish to work in this environment.’45 On 4 April he was assigned to Narkomindel’s press department, but within a week the decision was taken to appoint him as minister plenipotentiary to Helsinki, where he spent the next three years. His stay there culminated in the successful conclusion of the Helsinki Agreement on nonaggression in 1932.46 Though a weighty post, even Helsinki was far from attractive to Maisky, who clearly aspired to a much more prestigious and challenging position in Central or Western Europe. ‘The Russophobia and Sovietophobia here,’ he lamented to H.G. Wells, ‘are supreme. It is a sort of a general delirium’s attack.’ For the moment, however, he tried to maintain ‘a cheerful and a good fighting spirit’.47 Service in London clearly continued to attract Maisky. Even after his expulsion from England in 1927, he had remained attuned to the British political scene. He\n\nxliv\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at\n\nwas thoroughly briefed by Brailsford, H.G. Wells and others about the prospects of the 1929 general election, which could signal the resumption of diplomatic relations – if not indeed his return to London. Those hopes, however, were dashed after the elections, when Ramsay MacDonald’s foreign secretary, Arthur Henderson, made the re-establishment of relations with the Soviet Union conditional on a settlement of tsarist debts. MacDonald, so Maisky learned from his sources in London, ‘whether by accident or design, tumbled right into the Tory trap, and repeated his old declaration about the identity of the Soviet Government with the Komintern [sic]’. The three months he spent in Moscow before taking up his post in Helsinki convinced Maisky that, despite the critical domestic situation, the Soviet government was ‘at present not at all in the mood to pay that exorbitant price’.48 His main thrust, therefore, was now directed towards Central Europe. Maisky’s prospects of advancement brightened when Litvinov replaced the ailing Chicherin as commissar for foreign affairs in July 1930. Maisky was quick off the mark in congratulating Litvinov, though in a somewhat condescending way, reminiscing about their shared dreams and hopes while in exile in London, and the endless evenings spent together discussing world affairs in a ‘murky, sooty flat at 72 Oakley Square’. This was only a prelude to repeated requests for a transfer from Helsinki, a ‘small political nowhereville … and a very dull one’, hardly a place where ‘an active and energetic polpred can remain for long’. Maisky again tried to dictate his own terms, this time by setting the beginning of the year as the deadline for his transfer – even to the extent of apparently being prepared to forsake his position at Narkomindel. ‘My intention to seriously commit myself to a long-term diplomatic work, of which I wrote to you a few years ago from London, has not weakened in the intervening years but rather intensified,’ he informed Litvinov, ‘so that I should be reluctant to leave Narkomindel. Of course, if any concrete prospects for transfer do turn up, I would ask you first to consult with me.’49 By now Stalin’s firm grip on the commissariat was restricting Litvinov’s room for manoeuvre. Neither Maisky’s personal pleading, while on vacation in Moscow at the start of 1931, nor a later appeal, again harping on Agniya’s failing health (which he claimed could only be treated in Vienna), seemed to move an increasingly disgruntled Litvinov. ‘As you ought to know,’ he reminded Maisky, ‘this issue is not decided by me alone, but by other authorities who are least of all inclined to take account of personal considerations.’50 Little deterred, Maisky went on pushing forward his own plan, alas in vain: ‘Are you certain that working in Vienna would condemn me to diplomatic passivity? Is it really impossible to work on Hungary and the Balkans from Vienna? Won’t it be possible to make Vienna our immediate link in dealings with the League of Nations, etc.?’51 In the absence of any response, Maisky confined himself to heaping praise on Litvinov, while vigilantly awaiting new opportunities: ‘I have no affairs for you today, I just wanted to congratulate you even at a distance on your recent successes in Geneva … The diplomats here are also showing a heightened interest in your personality, and talk quite often of your Geneva successes.’52 Resigned to a prolonged stay in Helsinki, Maisky was dumbfounded when the unexpected news of his appointment as plenipotentiary to London was conveyed to him by telephone on 3 September 1932. When, a month or so earlier, the Maiskys had\n\nT h e M a k i ng of a S ov i et Di pl om at xlv\n\nvisited Kollontay in Stockholm and candidly confided in her, the appointment to the United Kingdom was certainly not on the cards. ‘After a minor post as plenipotentiary to Finland,’ an amazed Kollontay commented in her diary, ‘suddenly London and at such a troublesome period.’53 Many diplomats were shocked by his appointment, remembering his dubious past in the Samara government during the Civil War. The decision was obviously made in great haste and reflected a change in the orientation of Soviet foreign policy. Litvinov had succeeded in convincing Stalin that Maisky’s familiarity with England – and particularly his ability to communicate and engage people in conversation – was vital. Stalin saw in it ‘some sort of an experiment’.54 Within two days, Litvinov sought an agrément for Maisky. The feeble excuses he offered for Ambassador Sokolnikov’s abrupt withdrawal were the latter’s desire ‘to assume work in the Soviet Union’ and ‘the London climate which does not suit him’. As Maisky’s name did not appear on the Home Office’s ‘black list’ of Soviet diplomats who were engaged in subversive activities during the crisis of 1927,55 the Foreign Office grudgingly agreed that there was ‘nothing in M. Maisky’s record that would make him persona non grata to H.M.G.’. The more so as his record in Finland was ‘not too bad’.56 The appointment, perfectly tailored to Maisky’s temperament and ambitions, was perceived by him as recognition of his talents and status, placing him as a lead actor at the front of the stage. ‘London,’ he wrote to his father, ‘is a world centre. The other world centre is Moscow. I have to work at the intersection of these two world systems, so it’s no surprise that all my time and energy goes on dealing with the many problems that arise from the simultaneous existence of the Soviet and capitalist worlds.’57 To Whitehall, the appointment of Maisky signalled the Soviet Union’s wish to shake off its revolutionary image in Britain by adopting a pragmatic and gradualist course towards socialism. Sokolnikov was evidently ill-suited to the position. Like Maisky, he was the son of a Jewish doctor in the provinces. He had signed the Brest‑Litovsk peac"
