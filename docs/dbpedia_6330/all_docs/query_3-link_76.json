B - Today tuberculosis has succeeded Malaria as ×× O O Ceylon's Public Enemy No. i. Each year it kills more people than does any other disease in the country. Besides being highly infectious, usually by the time that a person realises that he is ill, the disease has got such a hold on him as to be incurable. But T.B. is both curable, and preventable and the State and public charities have combined to eradicate the disease from the island. Some of the ways through which the Anti T.B. campaign works are Chest clinics with modern facilities, with a clinic to each provincial capital. Mass radiography campaign throughout the island for the early detection of T. B. B. C. G. Vaccination. A National Chest Institute where T.B. workers such as nurses, doctors, radiographers etc. could be trained and provision made for laboratory facilities. Financial assistance for T. B. patients and their dependents. An intensified campaign of health education on T.B. It is the duty of every citizen to help in the fight to eradicate T. B. Though the state spends heavily on the campaign, funds are yet not sufficient and private charity can be very useful. Through buying T.B. Seals, readily available at all Post Offices, every citizen can contribute to this fight against Ceylon's deadliest disease. FIGHT T. B. by buying T. B.

Oil pioneering has often done much to inprove and steady the economy of a country by providing revenuc for its treasury, and employment, wages and buying power for its workers.

UNIVERSAL TRAVEL AGENTS A Established 841 COOK'S WORLD TRAVEL SERVICE PREFACE BY S. D. SA PARAMADU Editor, The Ceylon Historical Journal and formerly Assistant Lecturer in History in the University of Ceylon. It was Voltaire who once said 'the man who ventures to write -contemporary history must expect to be attacked both for everything he has said and everything he has not said.' This is even more true of the writer of the biography of a living or a recently dead person, specially if his subject is a political figure. Today, more than four years after his death, few will question the greatness of D. S. Senanayake and his contribution to the development of Ceylon. Yet one seeking to write his hiography lays himself open to many criticisms. Firstly, Senanayake has not been dead for sufficiently long to see him in a proper historical perspective. Many of the movements that he inaugurated in Ceylon, such as the parliamentary system of government, or agricultural development in the Dry Zone, or the foreign policy of alliance with the West, are still continuing and have not lasted long enough or borne sufficient fruit, to be termed either unqualified failures or successes. Secondly, Senanayake's name and personality is too closely associated with a single political party, the U.N.P. which he founded, to make any judgment on his work impossible without incurring the risk of partisanship. Party propaganda has besides, woven round him a web of myth and legend which the student has to discard before any proper evaluation is possible. In spite of these difficulties however, we did undertake this biographical study since we felt that D. S. Senanayake has played a vital role in the history of contemporary Ceylon, and so deserves the serious attention of students that is his due. In fact, before planning this work we made a detailed study of conditions in Ceylon in the last fifty years, and went through a good deal of the published writings om Senanayake and his times. We read all his available speeches, both in and out of Hansard and had the fortune of studying the working of some of his policies, stich as on the development of land, and of discussing him with a number of men who either served under him or were his advisors. The figure that emerges from even a most cursory study however, is a man of undoubted ability, guided by a fervent desire to serve his country and gifted with rare wisdom and a courage to carry out his convictions. He was a political strategist of a high order and had the personality to endear himself to all with whom he came into contact. He was in short a man of stature, the closest there is in our short and effeminate national 'struggle' who could be called a great man. Though it is doubtful what historians\n\nPage 18 ï»¿2 EDITOR'S PREFACE of the future will say of the other leaders of the national movement, it is unlikely that they will not assign to D. S.Senanayake a place alongside Dutugemunu, Vijayabahu and Parakramabahu as among the great rulers of Ceylon. In the main, this study has two aims in view. The first is to make a sober historical evaluation of Senanayake's work, free from the partisan bias that usually surrounds him, and second to show him as a national and not a partisan figure, who deserves the respect of all Ceylonese regardless of party, in the same way for example, that all Americans regard George Washington even though he was the founder of the still active Democratic Party. But such a historical evaluation, free from partisanship creates certain other problems. What is to be the structure of the study? What aspects of Senanayake's life are to be chosen for evaluation and what left out? What are his salient achievements and what are the unimportant ones? What aspects of his work will last and influence the future, even though certain other aspects roused more interest when he was living? This selection is the more difficult in Senanayake's case for he was closely associated in one way or another with almost every single political, social and economic movement that exists in Ceylon today, while most of the policies followed by the present government were either inaugurated by him or worked under his direction. Our structure of study has been to take out what we think are the salient and more lasting feafures of his work, and which will influence the future, and devote an article to each, every article being documented with one of his speeches where possible. Thus we have an article on Senanayake and independence, on Senanayake as Minister of Agriculture and on Senanayake's foreign policy, each supported by one of his major speeches. There are also two additional articles on Senanayake the Man, showing the human side of his character, and one on the origins and working of the Soulbury Commission of 1944. We have also added a chronological list of the principal events in Senanayake's life which should be useful, while the first section of the book contains several tributes to the memory of Senanayake from world statesmen such as Nehru, Attlee and Menzies, which indicates the high place and prestige he enjoyed in the counsels of the leaders of the world. Forty illustrations have also been included to provide a complete pictorial record of his life and career. Our original plan of study however, included three more articles on Senanayake as Prime Minister, Senanayake and the United National Party and on the early life of Senanayake. The absence of these articles, for which we apologise, has been as much due to the difficulting of persuading contributors as to the paucity of Source materials, particularly in the case of the last article. The EDITOR'S PREFACE 3 absence of scholars willing to work on the subject is also seen by the fact that the published articles in this journal have been contributed by people who were intimately associated with Senanayake, and who could not thus be called strictly objective. This charge has much substance, though personally we think all these articles maintain an admirable detachment. We leave it however to our readers to form their own judgment on them. Considering the shortcomings noted above, we will not claim any completeness for this biography, but is will serye we hope, as an interim study until a more complete survey can be undertaken. We would also like to record another difficulty that arose in the preparation of this Memorial Number. That is the almost complete absence of source materials from which to reconstruct Senanayake's life, particularly in the period prior to 1936. Many of the sources which the biographer usually goes to, are not available in Senanayake's case. He kept no diaries or other records of his work, while family records are not numerous and dispersed. Official publications, which are usually not too useful to the biographer, are themselves few, except in the last 15 years of his life, while few of his contemporaries have published any memoirs of their own careers. Most of the material for reconstructing Senanayake's life could thus be got only from the individuals who worked and served with him. Evidence from this source too becomes scarcer daily with the death of these individuals. In fact, the story of the first thirty years of his life is even now, almost completely lost. This absence of source materials spotlights the immediate necessity for two things. First, is the need for establishing a Senanayake Archives, a sort of national repository where all the letters, family records, speeches, official publications, in fact almost anything that sheds light on Senanayake's life and work, could be collected and preserved for posterity and for scholars. Other countries, it might be remembered even have special museums for their prominent men and it would not be asking too much for a collection of records for one of Ceylon's greatest sons. To give only one example, Franklin Roosevelt's home at Hyde Park, New York, is now a national monument run by the American State in his honour, and is a repository of all the available source materials on Roosevelt such as his letters, diaries, family records, etc., which scholars can consult. The second need which the paucity of source materials emphasises is the necessity of undertaking immediately a complete biography of Senanayake for publication. A comprehensive biography however cannot be undertaken on his own by an individual in the present context in Ceylon. The study of the source materials alone, considering that the biographer will also have to\n\nPage 19 ï»¿4. EDITOR'S PREFACE search and catalogue them, will take a minimum of about two years of concentiated research, which no individual can afford on his own. Similarly, since printing costs are high and the book buying public comparatively limited, no person can undertake the publication of the biography, even if he could find the time and money to write it. The only solution appears to be for government or for some interested academic body like the University to commission an author with experience to write the biography. We need hardly say that the money spent in establishing a Senanayake Archives and in commissioning a biography will be money well spent, as it will salvage for future generations the life story of a man who has made a valuable contribution to the history of this country. If this Memorial Number could only point out the need for some immediate action to be taken on this matter, it would have served one of its major purposes. Finally, a word should be added as to the long delay there has been in the publication of this journal. It was first scheduled to be out on March 22nd 1955, but was postponed from time to time, till it has now appeared nearly one year late. The delay has been partly due to our unavoidable absence from Colombo for a long period, and also to certain gentlemen who agreed to write the three nissing articles we mentioned earlier. On their promise, we held up the publication of the journal since we thought it better to publish a complete biography late than an incomplete one to schedule. That we should have had to publish an incomplete work, and that too one year late, is a misfortune which alas, happens not infrequently to editors in this country. In conclusion it is our duty to acknowledge the many debts of gratitude, almost two numerous to mention, that we have incurred in the preparation of this journal. We would however specially like to record our appreciation to the following: to Mr. Dudley Senanayake who gave us much valuable help and advice in the planning of this study and placed at our disposal the valuable collection of photographs of his father. To our contributors, Sir Ivor Jennings, Sir Frederick Rees, Mr. J. R. Jayewardene, Viscount Soulbury, Mr. R. L. Brohier and Sir Nicholas Attygalle who very willingly wrote their articles for us, even though we have ill repaid their help by publishing the journal one year late. To His Excellency Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, Governor General, for contributing the Foreword and to Jawaharlal Nehru, R. G. Menzies, Earl Attlee, Ghulam Mohamed, Sir John Kotelawala and Viscount Swinton for the kind tributes they have paid to the memory of D. S. Senanayake. To the Editor of the Ceylon Observer, Mr. A. G. Vittachchi for kind permission to reprint the article by Sir Ivor Jennings which first appeared in the Ceylon Observer of March 23rd 1952. To Miss Rene Tickell, Director of the Book EDITOR'S PREFACE 5 Reviews Department of the British Council in London who kindly sent us several books for review, and secured us some inaccessible material on Senanayake. To Mr. C. E. L. Wickramasinghe, Managing Director of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon who very kindly laid at our disposal the valuable selection of photographs of Senanayake in he Lake House library. To Mr. Felix Gunawardana, Editor of the Times of Ceylon who lent us several rare photographs from the Times of Ceylon collection. To the Information Department and particularly to the Assistant Infor mation Officer, Mr. Tissanayagam, who also loained us several photographs and the British High Commission, the Pakistan High Commission and Messrs J. R. Jayewardene and R. L. Brohier who gave us permission to use several of their copyrighted pictures. An individual acknowledgment appears at the right hand bottom corner of each photograph used. Our gratitude also to Mr. C. C. Desai, former Indian High Commissioner who very willingly helped us to contact Shri Jawaharlal Nehru for his message, to Mr. A. R. Cutler, Australian High Commissioner who put us in touch with his Prime Minister, the Pakistan High Commissioner who secured a tribute from Mr. Ghulam Mohammed, former Governor-General of Pakistan and Miss E. M. Booker, Information Officer of the British High Commission who gave us the two messages from Earl Attlee and Viscount Swinton. We would also like to thank Miss S. Saparamadu who has given us much editorial and managerial help in the production of this journal, and Messrs S. M. Haniffa and M. S. M. Junaideen who secured several advertisements. A special defit of gratitude is owed to Mr. A Benedict de Silva of the C. W. E. Printing Department who personally supervised the printing of tne journal, and bore all our numerous and exacting demands with much patience. And last, but not least, we thank the advertisers who have very willingly helped us to bear the brunt of the heavy printing costs of this production. If not for their co-operation it would not have been possible to bring out such a well printed and illustratediournal, leave alone sell it at a moderate price within the range of everyone. We hope readers would in turn patronise our advertisers.\n\nPage 20 ï»¿THE COLOMBO COMMERCIAL COMPANY - Li MITED - (INCORPORATED IN GREAT BRITAIN. LIABILITY of MEMBERs Is LIMITED.)

S. Senanayake Memorial Number.' The people of Ceylon will always remember with gratitude the work he did as a politician and as a leader of the country. It is fitting, therefore, that the Ceylon Historical Association should dedicate an issue of its journal to the memory of the Father of the Nation. If the Historical Association could hold up his shining example to the students of this Island's history, it would have done one of its legitimate tasks. History has always provided her students visions of human greatness. May your journal, dedicated to the Father of our new independence, serve to reveal to the people this vision of a great leader of Ceylon, so that future generations may tread the path he trod.

SENANAYAKE, A SYMBOL OF FREE ASA By SHRI JAWAHARLAL NEHRU Prime Minister of the Republic of India ISTORY is not only what is written in the books, but what happens from day to day. There are periods when a country or a people move along accustomed grooves and not much that is remarkable happens. There are other periods when rapid and far-reaching changes take place, affecting the destiny of nations and the lives of milions of people. During a lengthy period of time, the countries of Asia became rather static and their fate was largely determined by outside agencies. That period is over and Asia has become dynamic again and the countries of Asia are trying to shape their own destiny. We of this generation, wherever we may live, have passed through this great period of transition and have seen the face of Asia change in this process. That change continues. Leading personalities in different countries become the symbols of this period of transition and thus become in some way agents of historic destiny. In Ceylon, Don Stephen Senanayake was such a personality, who impressed himself not only in Ceylon, but also on a wider sphere. If was my privilege to meet him on many occasions in Colombo as well as in London where we went to attend the Commonwealth Prime Minister's Conferences. It is fitting that on the occasion of celebrating the Independence Day of Ceylon,* he should be remembered as a person who helped to bring about the transition to freedom, and then to consolidate the freedom that had come. On this occasion, I should like to add my tribute to this builder of Modern Ceylon. New Delhi. * It was originally planned to issue this Memorial Number on Independence Commemoration day. 8 O O.

Prime Minister of Australia look back on my friendship with the late Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake with warm pleasure. Our friendship developed from official contacts and ripened during Commonwealth Conferences and the Australian Jubilee celebrations in 1951, when D. S. Senanayake did Australia the honour of visiting her shores. D. S. Senanayake was a man of enormous breadth of vision and of singular personal attraction. He pursued his objectivesand he had a wonderful faculty for defining them precisely-with sincerity and forcefulness, yet always with due regard for the rights and feelings of others. His work is a lesson in statesmanship-a lesson which has particular application for all of us who are members of this great Commonwealth of Nations. To a considerable extent Ceylon owes its present status to him. Nevertheless, despite the energy with which he strove for his country's independence, he was determined that if possible Ceylon's future should lie within the Commonwealth. It will be recalled that in his address to the people of Ceylon in February, 1948, he declared that Ceylon would always remain grateful for Britainâs âgoodwill and co-operation' and expressed the hope that Ceylon's relations with the nations of the Commonwealth âwill always be one of perpetual friendship and cordiality.'' Australia, and indeed most of the Commonwealth family have in common with Ceylon the need to make great strides in development during the course of the next few decades. D. S. Senanayake's work in promoting irrigation schemes, in bringing previously barren land under cultivation, in encouraging agriculture and in promoting scientific research, which led to a great increase in agricultural production generally, constitutes the best example for us all. His achievements and personal qualities will always earn him a place of warm regard in the hearts of all who had the honour to know him. That, I think-and it is a measure of the man's stature-would be the kind of memorial he would most appreciate.

SIR JOHN KOTELAWALA, P.C., C.H., M.P. Prime Minister of Ceylon. OT a day passes without some occasion on which my thoughts go back to the days when I was in almost daily contact with Mr. Senanayake. I am glad to be able to write even a brief note about him. When, this year, I look back on my twenty-five years in political life, I shall feel even more deeply his absence, for during the whole of this long period he and I worked together for the same objectives and with the same purpose. He coaxed me into entering politics and would not let me leave it thereafter. From 1931 until his death I was his closest colleague and disciple. To me that is far greater than being Prime Minister. I do not think I can pay him a higher tribute than that. I hope all of us will strive to keep his memory alive for all time. There is no better way than by preserving the freedom he won for our country after a whole lifetime of devotion and service to us all. It is difficult for me to resist the temptation to write at length of him. In this article, which, in the publication for which it is intended, must keep to a reasonable length, I propose merely to put down a few of the thoughts that occur to me. No other man had so many political enemies as Mr. Senanayake, and few others lived to make those same enemies come round at least to grudging admiration. And, of course, quite a number of them became close friends. It amused me, at first, to see them flit in and out of âTemple Trees after he became Ceylon's first Prime Minister and hurry to do things to please him. Later I realized that he had compelled admiration by proving that his judgment, as against theirs, had been right. Mr. Senanayake did not oppose or fight anyone for personal reasons of prejudice or envy that often compel average men to great efforts. He was not immune from human frailties, but he was too busy and far too intent on achieving Independence for Ceylon to be distracted by petty things. To him that goal was a stronger incentive than perhaps for any other Ceylonese of modern times. 11\n\nPage 26 ï»¿12 The Rt. HoN. SIR JOHN KOTELAWALA His every working day was devoted to thinking and planning to reach that goal, and from that great height he looked on all other minor ambitions, of his friends and enemies, with a patriarchal good humour. This singleness of purpose was accompanied by a confidence that he would achieve his objective. Failures in the early days of negotiation depressed many of his contemporaries. He merely Smiled and went on as if nothing had happened to upset his plans. All of us soon began to look to him for the last word in a controversy. While others debated, turned up books and polished their phrases, he looked on until he was asked what should be done. He began invariably with that famous phrase, âactually, as a matter of fact-'. Thereafter he proceeded to calm everyone and steered a middle course which, judged by later events, was really the only reasonable course. This happened so often that he came to be regarded as infallible. Whenever there was calm in the political seas some impatient critics thought Mr. Senanayake should retire and that his usefulness was over. They even waged a war of nerves over who should succeed him. The moment, however, some civil commotion or economic or political crisis broke the calm, then, like frightened children they rushed to âTemple Trees to seek counsel from the Old Man. 'Actually, as a matter of fact,- he saw nothing to Worry about. And, in a few unhurried words, he directed what should be done. In every crisis all of us felt we could go to him and that once he took charge of the situation all would soon be well. I sincerely think that there was no other Ceylonese in this century who rose to this stature of leadership through strength. His stature as a Leader was also won by his own example. He was never a military man but he practised the famous military dictum: â Never ask your men to do something you cannot do yourself.' He did not merely preach patriotism. He had no equal in the love of his country. He did not pay mere lip-service to religion. He was deeply religious and was devout without displaying devotion. He never asked others to work hard, he shamed the lazy into work by his own example. And he held the scales evenly for all who served him. Once he picked a man for a job he gave him his unqualified confidence and trust. He knew each one's gifts and abilities as well as limitations, and no jealous rival could oust his man by intrigue or A TRIBUTE TO D. S. SENANAYAKE 13 tale-bearing. Those who served him knew he would never let them down even if, on occasion, he lashed them with his tongue. He won loyalty by being loyal himself. No man was too small for his attention if he had the time, and, somehow, he would find the time. This meant sixteen or even eighteen hours of the day in his office, or travelling all over the country. I have seen him talk to callers for several hours at a sitting; and long past the time when most men's patience would have been exhausted, he would greet some hundredth visitor like a long lost friend. No man who went to see him ever forgot his kindness or the sincerity with which he promised to look into his grievance. Often, as it turned out there was nothing he could do for them, but their â P.M. had seen them and given them a hearing--that was something they would never forget. He had become, in fact, âThe Father of the Nation long before the newspapers gave him that name. He believed he had been called to undertake that responsibility and he also believed that he had the capacity to bear it well. And all the time he planned Ceylon's development so that her people would get into line again in the march of history. He died at a time when he was most needed, but he lived to see the people on the march.\n\nPage 27 ï»¿D. S. SENANAYAKE, THE CREATOR OF A NEW CEYLON By HIS EXCELLENCY GHULAM MOHAMMED Former Governor General of Pakistan T is indeed a great pleasure to me to have the opportunity of paying a personal tribute to the memory of the late Rt. Hon. D. S. Senanayake through the courtesy of the Ceylon Historical Journal. I had the privilege of meeting him during the historic Commonwealth Conference held in Colombo in 1950 and coming in close contact with the creator of New Ceylon. Like QuaidAzam Mohamed Ali Jinnah, Mr. Senanayake was one of those few leaders who did not only cherish the dream of freedom for their people but had also the will and the determination to see it fulfilled during their life-time. His name will be recorded in history as that of a great statesman and a patriot to whom nothing was dearer than the service of his people. He was a man of sterling worth with a broad outlook, a mature wisdom and a great determination. Ceylon owes much to him in the attainment of its present status and dignity in the comity of nations, but his memory will be revered throughout the entire free would. In Pakistan he will particularly be remembered as a sincere friend who laid the foundation of the present ever growing, cordial and happy relations between the two countries at the memorable meeting which was held between him and the Quaid-i-Azam, the founder of Pakistan.

Former Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Great Britain. gladly add my tribute to one who was a great servant and Prime Minister of another lovely island with its roots in ancient history. I had the good fortune to know Don. Stephen Senanayake for many years and to work with him. I shall always cherish the memory of that friendship. He was not only a wise leader in his own land; but he represented traditions of public life which are a prized possession and priceless asset throughout the Commonwealth. That he lived to lead Ceylon when she took her rightful and privileged place as a governing member of this great family of nations is indeed his memorial. Commonwealth Relations Office, London. 15\n\nPage 28 ï»¿D. S. SENANAYAKE AND INDEPENDENCE By SIR IVOR JENNINGS, Q.C., Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ceylon. HOUGH may others contributed at earlier stages, it was Mr. D. S. Senanayake's leadership which brought the agi tation for Independence to a successful conclusion in 1948. An Englishman who has studied the politicians and administrators of his own country can suggest that most of the agitation from 1932 to 1942 may have been on the wrong lines. A colony can obtain independence by force or by persuasion. If it abjures force, as a Buddhist country must do, it must use persuasion. A modicum of non-co-operation may draw attention to the strength of popular demand, and so help to gain independence by perSuasion: but effective non co-operation leads necessarily to force, as Mahatma Gandhi discovered; and if it leads to force it does not lead to persuasion. If, however, persuasion is to be employed, it must study the susceptibilities of the people to be persuaded. It is difficult to imagine anything less persuasive than the Pan-Sinhalese Ministry of 1936 and the debate on Sir Andrew Caldecott's despatch in 1939. Neither step could have persuaded anybody of anything except (possibly) the incapacity of the Ceylonese for selfgovernment. Mr. Senanayake's sturdy commonsense enabled him to realise the weaknesses of the tactics of the preceding ten years and to start on the process of persuasion. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke gave him every support, especially by making the services of the Civil Defence Department indispensable to the Commander-in-Chief. Sir Geoffrey Layton discovered that when he needed the assistance of the civil authorities it was easier to get things done informally through Mr. Senanayake and Sir Oliver Goonetilleke than to use âthe Governor's Government.' It was, however, made plain to him that the collaboration of the Civil Government would be half-hearted so long as no attempt was made to solve the constitutional problem. It was he who suggested something a little less stupid than the Declaration of 1941; and he was apparently supported by âthe Governor's Government' as soon as Sir Robert Drayton became Chief Secretary. 16 D. S. SENANAYAKE AND INDEPENDENCE 17 The declaration of May 1943 was not what Mr. Senanayake wanted, but his commonsense told him that when an offer was better than the Donoughmore Constitution it should be accepted as an interim measure and not rejected as inadequate. The fact that one could not leap to Dominion Status was not a reason for not taking the first step, for it shortened the distance to be leapt. It was not, however easy to persuade local opinion. The idea of accepting a British offer because it was better than nothing instead of rejecting it because more was expected was completely 1há¾á³. It was so much easier to make a speech attacking the British than to defend in public the acceptance of an inadequate offer. It was, however easier to get the Board of Ministers to agree to accept the offer than to get them to agree upon the terms of the public statement. The Board spent eight hours over the draft. Fortunately Mr. Senanayake now had a stout ally in Sir Robert Drayton. This was due to one of Sir Oliver Goonetilleke's bright ideas. He pointed out that for the first time in his life Mr. Senanayake was proposing to support âthe Governor's Government. It was therefore important that the Chief Secretary should be in complete agreement. Sir Robert was shown the draft which Mr. Senanayake was proposing; he said little, but that little was enough, and in the Board Sir Robert did his best to help Mr. Senanayake get the draft through. It went through eventually with a few amendments which seemed to weaken the document, though they never proved to be important. That Mr. Senanayake could oppose âthe Governor's Government' if need be was shown by the sequel. The reply from the Colonial Office was woolly and the situation was mishandled by the Governor, Sir Andrew Caldecott, but it was all done in good faith. Mr. Senanayake nevertheless thought he had been betrayed and gave the Governor the sort of dressing-down that Colonial Governors do not anticipate. Eventually Sir Oliver Goonetilleke's diplomacy and Sir Robert Drayton's draughtmanship produced a document which Mr. Senanayake thought sufficiently satisfactory, and the process of drafting the Constitution was begun. The fact that the new constitution was called âthe Soulbury Constitution has led those who have not read the documents to infer that it was produced by the Soulbury Commission. The fact is that it was produced by Mr. Senanayake. All the essential provisions of âthe Ministers' Draft' were embodied in the Soulbury Constitution, and the only substantial addition made by the Soulbury Commission was the Senate. Mr. Senanayake had produced a scheme for a Senate, but he found that the Ministers were divided\n\nPage 29 ï»¿18 SiR I WOR ENNINGS and therefore withdrew it, Substituting an empowering clause which would hawc enabled thic new single-chimmbcr legislat Lu Te to create a Senate if it felt so disposed. The belief that the Soulbury Commission producetil the Cep T1 s Litution is due partly to the fact that people doubted whether Mr. Sen: Taylke had the capacity to produce a Constitution: after all, he had newer passed Matriculation. This is, however, seriously to underrate Mr. Sem EÄ±nÄ±zÄ±yake's intelleci LilahlÄ± capacity, Nil tÄ±lÄ±r:Ä±lly lÄ±r: relied heavily on his advisers: any Minister who does not is hould to fall. What is more, he left insignificant detail to his advisers.

In the third place he was anxious for a Constitution which was so fair Lo all communities that they would forget that there were communities. When the distribution of seats was under discussion he was specifically asked how many Tamils he wanted in the House. His answer was typical: \"I don't care if they're all Tamils, provided they are elected as Ceylonesc'. In fact, he never counted how many Sinhalese or Tamils there would probably bc. He wanted the distribution of seats to be based on a principle which he could defend. He had no objection to anybody else trying to reach agreement, but hic did not think anybody would succeed. He believed that the negotiations would turn into haggling over odd seats, and he mercly grinned when he proved to be correct. He said he could get virtually complete argeement later on if the whole scheme, including the Tepresentation clauses, was fair to everyone, and gave a substantial measure of self-government. So it proved, for the State Council subsequently agreed by 51 votes to 3-two Indians and a Communist. When these and other principles were put into a draft he went through it very carefully with Sir Oliver Goonetilleke. How LO, S. SENANAYAKE AND INDEPENDENCE 9. carefully the work was done may be judged from the fact that hic draft which he submitt cd to his colleagues was the fourth. By this time he knew the text very well: even more important was the fact that lic knew thic answers to all the objections. NLImerous Illinor amendments were made by the Ministers, but the final text, which was published as Sessional Paper XIV of 1944, was in all css citials the same as that which he had circulated, except for the deletion of the Senate, which he did not regard as El qLics Lion of great illportance. This was not because he tried to force his scheme through the Board. He wanted agreement in the Board so that his hands would be strengthened when he cal me to 11egoliate at the âcommission or conference.â stipula Led by the Declaration. He had never intended to abide by the condition that the \"commission or conference should be postponed until after the War. What is more, he lade his intention plain both publicly and privately.

The contrast between the quiet, disinterested behaviour of the Ministers and the public advocacy of the supporters of other causes was in itself most effective. In any case Mr. Senanayake wanted to be in London when the Report appeared. If it was favourable he would ask for more; if it was unsatisfactory he would repudiate it. The Ministers were no longer bound by the Declaration, which the United Kingdom Government had itself repudiated. He could, therefore, ask for Dominion Status. Colonel Stanley was very willing to remedy a situation which his officials should never have created, and the invitation was sent very readily. Unfortunately there were no funds available. The Treasury was now controlled by Sir Oliver, and it proved very inventive of devices for getting a staff to London. The Royal Air Force provided a plane, But living expenses in Londonand they exceeded Â£ 100 a week-had to be borne by Mr. Senanayake himself. Mr. Senanayake made a great impression in London because he was so utterly unexpected. Whitehall was used to the slick, England-educated, graduate politician. It had not expected a bluff old farmer with a sense of humour. What is more he âknew his stuff.' Whitehall knew about him through his speeches and the despatches of the Governor. Everybody knows that Mr. Senanayake was not very articulate as a Speaker and that an ex tempore speech, as reported, was always ordinary. Sir Andrew Caldecott too, had never understood Mr. Senanayake. He once asked one of the advisers if he found Mr. Senanayake âintelligent'. The Soulbury Report was given to Mr. Senanayake in proof. As soon as he read it he grinned all over his face. The main principles of the Ministers' scheme had been accepted. The new Senate was of no particular importance. Above all, the fundamental defect of the Ministers' scheme had been made more defective. The Ministers had inserted all the limitations on self-government required by the Declaration, but they had put in all the possible qualifications and restrictions with the intention of bartering them one by one at the âcommission or conference. The Soulbury Commission had put qualifications and restrictions upon the qualifications and restrictions. This gave Mr. Senanayake an irrefutable argument. This Constitution-devised by the Soulbury Commission-simply would not work. It would break down as soon as an emergency arose. Why not scrap the restrictions and trust the Ceylonese? A reply had to be made forth with before opinion in the Colonial Office crystallised. Besides, the efficiency of Ceylon administration D. S. SENANAYAKE AND INDEPENDENCE 21 had to be demonstrated. Within 48 hours a lengthy memorandum had be delivered to the Colonial Office. It asked for Dominion Status; but if that required delay it asked for full self-government forthwith; and if there was difficulty about that there were defects in the Soulbury Constitution which ought to be removed. A few days later a full constitution, complete with draft agreements designed to tempt the Service Departments (who had probably had messages from Sir Geoffrey Layton). was delivered at the Colonial Office. The officials were astonished. What sort of colony was this? How could such a place be kept as a colony when it took Whitehall itself months to get this kind of thing done? The case was backed by Mr. Senanayake's personal representations; and here he secured his greatest triumph, for the Colonial Secretary was persuaded to take to the Cabinet a proposal for Dominion Status. Had it been a Conservative Government or had the Secretary of State been more persuasive, Ceylon might have become a Dominion in 1946. Unfortunately the Labour Government was very worried about India and Burma and it did not want little Ceylon to get Dominion Status before those problems were settled. The Colonial Office was apparently told to meet Mr. Senanayake's views as much as possible but not to confer Dominion Status. Mr. Senanayake was disappointed but not unduly worried. He would get the Soulbury Constitution into being and hold the general election. At the appropriate moment he would ask for, and obtain Dominion Status. When Burma was given independence the new Secretary of State, Mr. Creech Jones, told the Cabinet that he would soon have either Mr. Senanayake or Sir Oliver Goonetilleke on his doorstep. Shortly afterwards Sir Oliver turned up in London with a letter from Mr. Senanayake. It was a very short letter. It merely asked that Mr. Creech Jones have another look at Mr. Senanayake's letter of September 1945. Mr. Creech Jones did, and this time the Cabinet saw no reason to dissent. The details took time to work out, and independence was not finally proclaimed until the 4th February 1948, but the principles had been settled by July 1947. Mr. Senanayake was not liked by some of those who worked under him, because he could not tolerate inefficiency, procrastination and bombast. He liked people who could Work quickly, efficiently and cheerfully. To them he was delightful. He was himself excessively modest. He never said 'No'; he simply said \"I mean to say.' That meant âTry again.' Once he had confidence in an adviser he would let him do his job in his own way and himself stand the racket. If somebody else was making a case against\n\nPage 31 ï»¿22 SIR IVOR JENNINGS them he wanted an answer, and he would not put up with bluff; but once he had the answer he knew how to use it forcefully and decisively. On the evening of the 26th May, 1943 he explained at a conference in the Civil Defence Department how Dominion Status could be obtained and how he proposed to obtain it. He had confidence in his own people and he also had confidence that if he was adequately supported, he could persuade His Majesty's Government. He had not only the fire of a complete conviction but also the sense of strategy of a great general. There have been few greater statesmen in the history of the British Commonwealth, and Ceylon owes a debt to his memory that will be difficult to repay. THE SOULBURY COMMISSION (1944-45) By SIR FREDERICK REES Member of the \"Soulbury' Commission on Constitunal Reform 1944-45. Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wales. T is now ten years since the Soulbury Commission visited Ceylon. The purpose of this article is to record as precisely as possible the circumstances in which the Commission was appointed and the problems which it was called upon to consider. What conclusions it reached are fully stated in its Report which was published in September 1945. The analysis here offered is mainly based on the evidence given before the Commission at public hearings in Colombo Town Hall between 22nd January and 13 February of that year. The hearings themselves were designed to elucidate by question and answer, memoranda Submitted by individuals or on behalf of organisations, in response to a general invitation published by the Commission in the Press, The decision to appoint a Commission was announced by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons on 5th July 1944. It was to reach Ceylon towards the end of the year. The membership of the Commission, however, was not finally settled unti early in November and then arrangements for its departure had to be speedily made. The Commissioners had their first meeting in London on 30th November. At the Colonial Office they gathered a sense of urgency on several grounds closely related to one another. It was alleged that the public in Ceylon had become restive because the life of the State Council had, owing to the War, been twice extended. There had also been persistent complaints that the existing constitution had proved to be unworkable and all attempts to have it amended had been unsuccessful. The general feeling of discontent, it was suggested, might be exploited by extreme elements and thus hamper the War effort. At that time it seemed probable that after the defeat of Germany the main theatre of the War would be in the East where Ceylon would be an important base for its conduct. The appreciation at the Colonial Office of the position in Ceylon was more alarming than was justified by the facts. Political leaders there saw that conditions were opportune for them to exercise pressure on His Majesty's Government in favour of constitutional reform. 23\n\nPage 32 ï»¿24 SR FREDERICK REES The terms of reference of the Commission were:- \"To visit Ceylon in order to examine and discuss any proposals for constitutional reform in the Island which have the object of giving effect to the Declaration of His Majesty's Government on the subject dated 26th May 1943; and after consultation with various interests in the Island, including minority communities, concerned with the subject of constitutional reform, to advise His Majesty's Government on all measures necessary to attain that object.' It should be particularly noticed in view of what happened subsequently that the Commissioners were instructed (i) to examine and discuss any proposals for constitutional reform, (ii) to have regard to giving effect to the Declaration of 26th May 1943, and (iii) to consult various interests in the Island, including minority communities. The Declaration of 26th May 1943 was itself designed to give greater precision to the statement of 1st September 1941 in which His Majesty's Government recognised the importance of reform of the Constitution, but observed that there was \"little unanimity' on the subject in Ceylon, and promised that the matter would be taken up \"with the least possible delay after the War. This was regarded as an indefinite postponement and strongly criticised on the grounds already mentioned. The Declaration of 26th May 1943, therefore, indicated in a series of paragraphs how far His Majesty's Government was prepared to go to meet the aspirations of the people of Ceylon. Consequently, it must be quoted in extenso, particularly as the Commissioners were instructed to consider what steps should be taken to give effect to it. (1) The post-war re-examination of the reform of the Ceylon Constitution, to which His Majesty's Government stands pledged, will be directed towards the grant to Ceylon by Order of His Majesty in Council, of full responsible Government under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration. (2) His Majesty's Government will retain control of the provision, construction, maintenance, security, staffing, manning and use of such defences, equipment, establishments and communications as His Majesty's Government may deem necessary for the Naval, Military and Air security of the Commonwealth, including that of the Island, the cost thereof being shared between the two Governments in agreed proportions. TFE SOULBURY COMMISSION - 25 (3) Ceylon's relations with foreign countries and with other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations will be subject to the control and direction of His Majesty's Government. (4) The Governor will be vested with such powers as will enable him, if necessary, to enact any direction of His Majesty's Government in regard to matters within the scope. of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this declaration; and his assent to local measures upon these matters will be subject to reference to His Majesty's Government. (5) The present classes of Reserved Bills in the Royal Instructions will be largely reduced under a new Constitution. Apart from measures affecting Defence and External Relations, it is intended that these shall be restricted to classes of Bills which:- (a) relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of His Majesty's subjects not residing in the Island, and the trade and shipping of any part of the Commonwealth; (b) have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which in the Governor's opinion are likely to involve oppression or unfairness to any community; (c) relate to currency. (6) The limitations contained in the preceding paragraph will not be deemed to prevent the Governor from assenting in the King's name to any measure relating to, and conforming with, any trade agreements concluded with the approval of His Majesty's Government by Ceylon with other parts of the Commonwealth. It is the desire of His Majesty's Government that the Island's commercial relations should be settled by the conclusion of agreements, and His Majesty's Government will be pleased to assist in any negotiations with this object. (7) The framing of a Constitution in accordance with the terms of this Declaration will require such examination of detail and such precision of definition as cannot be brought to bear so long as the whole of the energies of the Service and other Departments of His Majesty's Government must remain focussed on the successful prosecution of the war. His Majesty's Government will, however, once victory is achieved, proceed to examine by suitable Commission or\n\nPage 33 ï»¿26 V SIR FREDERICK REES Conference such detailed proposals as the Ministers may in the meantime have been able to formulate in the way of a complete constitutional scheme, subject to the clear understanding that acceptance by His Majesty's Government of any proposals will depend:- First, upon His Majesty's Government being satisfied that they are in full compliance with the preceding portions of this Statement; Secondly, upon their subsequent approval by threequarters of all members of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the Officers of State and the Speaker or other presiding Officer. (8) In their consideration of the problem, His Majesty's Government have very fully appreciated and valued the contribution which Ceylon has made and is making to the war effort of the British Commonwealth and the United Nations, and the co-operation which, under the leadership of the Board of Ministers and the State Council, has made this contribution effective. What interpretation was to be put on paragraph 7 ? Was the suggested Commission or Conference merely to examine whether the Ministers' proposals satisfied the principles laid down in the preceding paragraphs of the Declaration ? If so, the terms of reference of the Commission were much too wide. They were instructed, it will be recalled, \"to examine and discuss any proposals' and to consult various interests in the Island, including minority communities. The Ministers chose to regard this as a departure from the undertaking given in the Declaration. In the meanwhile, however, they had drafted a scheme in the form of an Order in Council and forwarded it to the Secretary of State. The Ministers' draft can only be appreciated if reference be made to the criticisms of the existing Constitution which was based (with certain modifications) on the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commission which had reported in 1928. The Donoughmore Constitution was in itself a reform-in fact, a drastic departure from previous practice-and was ingeniously designed to solve the difficulties which had made the Constitution of 1924 unworkable. These difficulties in the opinion of the Donoughmore Commission arose because a representative legislature with a large unofficial majority had no control over the executive. It suggested, therefore, that executive functions should be vested in the legislature itself. After a General Election the members of the legislature (now called the State Council) THE SOULBURY COMMISSION 27 were to be divided by secret ballot among themselves between seven Executive Committees-each Committee to have charge of a Department-and the Chairmen of the Committees, together with the three Officers of State (the Chief Secretary, the Treasurer and the Attorney-General) were to form a Board of Ministers responsible for the general conduct of the business of government and in particular for the preparation of the annual budget. This was the feature of the Donoughmore Constitution which came under the sharpest criticism. The Commission also recommended the abolition of communal representation in favour of territorial representation based on universal suffrage without property, income or literacy qualification. Many regarded that as 'a leap in the dark' and the minority communities were particularly concerned about the possible consequences of taking it. The motion in favour of adopting the Donoughmore Constitution had been carried after prolonged discussion in December 1929 by a majority of two of the unofficial members in the Legislative Council. It was not long before it was alleged to reveal serious defects. The real weakness was that the Board of Ministers did not have, and were not prepared to assume, collective responsibility. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the Sinhalese majority, confirmed in power by universal suffrage, were not prepared to give the scheme a fair trial. There was a demand for \"a homogeneous Ministry wholly responsible to the Legislature.' Instead of the Chairmen of the Executive Committees becoming Ministers, it was suggested that the State Council should elect a Chief Minister, the other Ministers to be nominated by him and then Committees assigned to them. This would have been a step towards a responsible Ministry under the leadership of a Chief Minister. The Executive Committees were retained for the time in deference to the views of the minorities who regarded the system as some safeguard of their interests. One of their members might become a Chairman of a Committee and thus have a place on the Board of Ministers. In the first State Council two minority members had thus become Ministers. This meant that there was not unanimity on the Board of Ministers about reform of the Constitution-a point which the Secretary of State was not slow to notice. In the second election to the State Council in 1936 the representation of the communities was practically unchanged. When the ballot was taken to appoint members of the Executive Committees the Sinhalese so arranged the distribution of their numbers that they had a majority on every Committee. Each then proceeded to elect a Sinhalese Chairman and so formed a Pan-Sinhalese Ministry. This was a practical demonstration that under the Donoughmore Constitution there was no guarantee that any member of the minority communities would get on to the Board of Ministers. It was also possible to represent to the\n\nPage 34 ï»¿28 SIR FREDERICK REES Secretary of State that there was unanimity on the Board of Ministers in favour of constitutional reform; an argument which would carry little force when the method of achieving the result was realised. The minorities were naturally more convinced than ever that the Sinhalese aimed at domination. The Board of Ministers now launched an open attack on the Executive Committee system. They declared that it caused endless dissensions among Ministers who pressed the claims of their respective Committees and consequently there were constant delays in administration. In their opinion it ought to be replaced by the ordinary form of cabinet government. The discussion reached a further stage when the Secretary of State instructed the newly-appointed Governor, Sir Andrew Caldecott, to investigate the position and submit his observations. His âReforms Despatch' of 1938 was an independent expression of opinion based on a careful sifting of the evidence. He was convinced that the Executive Committee system had proved unsatisfactory. It made coordinated effort difficult and prevented the emergence of any real ministerial policy. So he recommended that it should be abolished. The alternative was a Cabinet with collective responsibility which might in time stimulate the formation of political parties. For he was as convinced as the Donoughmore Commissioners that communalism should be eliminated from political life. He rejected any suggestion that the franchise should be restricted by imposing a property or literacy test. He had to recognise, however, that this meant that the apprehensions of the minority communities would not be removed. So he made two suggestions. The first was that the boundaries of the electoral districts might be re-drawn so as to afford an opportunity for a fuller representation of the ten seats. The alternative (of which more will be said later) of attempting to effect a balance of majority and minority representation-the principle of \"Fifty-Fifty-he rejected. His second suggestion was that a place should be found in the cabinet for some representatives of the minorities, i.e. that the cabinet should be composite. The Sinhalese leaders, he found, realised that the formation of the Pan-Sinhalese Ministry had been a mistake, though they contended it had been forced upon them by circumstances. His solution of the problem was that the Royal Instructions to the Governor should contain a clause similar to that in the Indian Instructions, which charged him to use his best endeavours, in consultation with the person likely to command a majority in the Legislature, to select those, including so far as practicable members of important minority communities, who would inspire confidence. The proposals of the âReforms Despatch' were discussed at great length in the State Council. The Governor had to admit THE SOULBURY COMMISSION 29 to the Secretary of State that they had not received the general consent of all important interests in Ceylon. In fact, they were riddled with destructive criticisms with no attempt to find a basis for possible agreement. What was significant was the condemnation of the Executive Committee system which confirmed the views of the Pan-Sinhalese Ministry. It was obviously doomed. No less important was the condemnation of communalism, accompanied by a recognition of its influence in the proposal of a delimitation of areas to give the minorities better representation and the insistence on a composite Cabinet. To return to the Ministers' draft. It has already been mentioned that it was drawn up in the form of an Order in Council because that required precision of statement and comprehensiveness. The Ministers worked on the assumption that with the necessary legal revision it might satisfy the requirements of the Declaration of 26th May 1943. When the terms of reference of the Soulbury Commission were announced they took umbrage and withdrew the Draft. But they published it with an Explanatory Memorandum as a Sessional Paper is September 1944. Its contents were therefore known to the Commission and to those who submitted memoranda and gave evidence before it. Attention was naturally concentrated upon it. In general, it may be said that discussion turned on the alleged weaknesses of the Donoughmore Constitution and the proposals for reform put forward by the Board of Ministers. The Draft provided for the appointment by the Governor-General (the term used) of a Prime Minister who would recommend the appointment of his nine colleagues. They would form a Cabinet. The Prime Minister could also recommend the appointment of Deputy Ministers not exceeding ten in number. The Legislature (the name Council of State was suggested) was to consist of approximately 100 members, 95 of whom were to be elected on a territorial basis. The increase in the number of members is significant. The Donoughmore Commission had recommended that the Legislature should have 65 members elected territorially, but this had been reduced to 50. when the Constitution was promulgated, and that probably meant a more than proportionate reduction in the representation of the minorities. The mere increase might, therefore, operate in their favour. In addition a Delimitation Commission was to be appointed to divide each of the nine provinces into electoral districts and they were to proceed on the principle of allotting a district for every 75,000 of population plus a district for every square mile of area. This was frankly based on a consideration of the geographical distribution of the communities. The great majority of the Sinhalese lived in the densely populated areas, while the great majority of the Tamils and Muslims lived in the less densely populated areas, e.g., the Northern Province mostly\n\nPage 35 ï»¿30 SIR FREDERICK REES inhabited by Tamils could claim 5 electoral Districts on the basis of population but had 4 added in consideration of area. Sir Andrew Caldecott, as has already been mentioned, suggested a re-drawing of electoral areas so as to give the minorities better representation. Whether the population-area weightage which the Ministers had devised would in practice give the proportionate additional membership he suggested was a question which the Soulbury Commission often put to witnesses who were prepared to make estimates. The Ministers' draft provided for a single-chamber Constitution, but gave the Council of State power to establish a Second Chamber or Senate and to define its composition, powers, privileges, etc. They explained that the question of a Second Chamber was controversial and should be left for decision at a later date. A constitutional purist might point out that for the Council of State to decide whether the structure of the Legislature should be fundamentally altered by the creation of a Second Chamber was open to strong objection. In any event, it is almost inconceivable that it would do so of its own volition. As was stated in a memorial drawn up in April 1944 and addressed to the Secretary of State by a group which advocated a Second Chamber, the Ministers in formulating their proposals were in an embarrassing position. They were, it was pointed out, virtually judges in their own case: to include provision for a Second Chamber in their Scheme would imply that they thought the majority in the Council of State required some supervision and control. The minorities, on the other hand, alarmed by the removal of the checks contained in the existing Constitution, as, for instance, the limitation of the powers of the Governor and the abolition of the Executive Committees, were inclined to place their hopes on the creation of a Second Chamber with powers of delay and revision. They noticed, too, that the Ministers do not either in their Draft Order or Explanatory Memorandum make any reference to the qualification for the suffrage. The implication was that no change was contemplated. The vexed question of the conditions on which the Indian Tamils on the estates were to qualify for the vote remained in its unsatisfactory position. That experienced colonial administrator, Sir Philip Mitchell, has said recently that when a Commission arrives in a territory the bees in everyone's bonnet have the buzzing of their lives. This was certainly the experience of the Soulbury Commission. As one witness put it minorities are springing up like mushrooms since the advent of the Commission. Now and then the CommisSioners could not resist the temptation to ask when they were formed and how many members they had enrolled. The answers Were often revealing. But the cross examination was never hostile; THE SOULBURY COMMISSION 3. the suave question frequently elicits more than the witness realises. Much discussion turned on communalism. Many witnesses ascribed communal friction, if they admitted it to exist, to the introduction of the Donoughmore Constitution. The element of truth in this allegation was that, while in previous Constitutions the principle ofCommunalism was recognised, with the adoption of adult suffrage and territorial constituencies it was the obvious ground of appeal which a political candidate could make. There were no defined parties with opposing programmes. What the ordinary voter knew was the community (and within it the caste) to which the respective candidates belonged. Candidates did not hesitate to exploit this position. So territorial representation was for the most part in existing circumstances what one witness described as camouflage. The very suggestion of delimitation of electoral areas to offer the opportunity for a larger representation of minorities was an acknowledgement of the fact. The underlying structure of society in Ceylon is communal. In the course of history its strata have been laid down and preserved by the influence of location, religion and occupation. Location has divided the Tamils of the Northern Province from the Sinhalese; religion sharply distinguishes between the Sinhalese and Tamils, whether Ceylon or Indian on the one hand, and the Muslims on the other; while occupation separates the Indian Tamils on the estates from the typical small cultivator, whether Sinhalese or Tamil. The Donoughmore Commission recommended the abolition of communal representation partly because they found that if the principle was retained, claims for special representation came from an increasing number of communities, religions, castes and special interests, each of which asserted that they had as much right to the privilege as those who already enjoyed it. So they decided in favour of territorial representation perhaps without fully realising the effect of the impact of a Western idea on a traditional structure. The Soulbury Commission heard witnesses who pressed for special representation by nomination, separate registers of voters or special delimitation of electoral districts. The Ceylon Moors' Association asked for at least one seat in the legislature by nomination in order to have direct representation of the interests of their Chamber of Commerce. The All-Ceylon Minority Tamil Sabha (depressed classes) also asked for representation by nomination on the ground that adult suffrage in itself did not enable them to exert any influence on the Legislature for the redressing of their grievances. The All-Ceylon Scheduled Castes' Federation, on the other hand, wanted separate electorates with a separate register. The suggestion that areas should be specially demarcated so as to provide an opportunity for its representation in the Legislature was made by the Catholic Union of Ceylon. In its evidence it pointed out this would be possible\n\nPage 36 ï»¿32 SIR FREDERICK REES by extending districts along the coast instead of merging them with the hinterland. A similar plea was made by the Central Fisheries Union of Ceylon which asserted that the fishing interest was overwhelmed by the agriculturists. With the demarcation which the Union advocated it was estimated it would give them at least 15 or 20 seats. Finally the Ceylon Malayali Mahajana Sabha made the novel suggestion that there should be one or two Malayalis in the Second Chamber to protect their interests. To the Sinhalese territorial representation was quite acceptable. With their large predominance in numbers they could count on the return of a substantial majority in a General Election. It was this fact, of course, which caused alarm to the minorities and set them to contriving ways and means of neutralising the advantage. But before examining their proposals reference must be made to the claims of the Kandyans. They asserted that the Low Country Sinhalese had infiltrated into the Kandyan districts where they had gained key positions, e.g. as keepers of boutiques in the villages, and thus exercised a control over the poor villagers. This was an old complaint. The Donoughmore Commission, had noted the fear expressed in that the more resourceful invaders would take advantage of adult suffrage to consolidate their hold on the peasantry. The Low Country Sinhalese, the Kandyan spokesmen pointed out, had successively been conquered by, and had submitted to the rule of, the Portuguese, Dutch and British while the Kandyan Kingdom had retained its independence until it had of its own free will in 1815 entered into a treaty with King George III, in which it gave him its allegiance. The Soulbury Commissioners were well aware that their attention would be drawn to the Kandyan Convention and shared the general uncertainty of its relevance to present day issues. They had taken note that the Donoughmore Commission had viewed the Kandyan claim to special treatment not without sympathy and had made the innocuous and rather impracticable suggestion that the Legislature might sometimes meet at Kandy. But quite apart from the Kandyan Convention there was now the definite evidence that in two General Elections the majority of the seats in the Kandyan area had been captured by Low Country Sinhalese candidates. There were 21 territorial seats; but in the General Election of 1931, 10 Kandyans were elected and in 1936, only 6. What was the explanation? Witnesses put forward three-the ignorance of the voters, corrupt practices on the part of the candidates and the effect of the Indian vote. They had to admit that there were sufficient Kandyan voters on the lists to ensure the return of a Kandyan candidate if he was supported; in some instances in fact no Kandyan had come forward. The remedy suggested was that only Kandyans should be eligible for election in these constituencies. THE SOULBURY COMMISSION 33 Although the Kandyan case was stated by four organisations and one individual witness, it was clear that, despite the earnestness with which it was put forward, it had become weaker since it was presented to the Donoughmore Commission. Then the Kandyan National Assembly had suggested the division of the Island into three self-governing areas-the North and East; the Kandyan; and the South and West-united in a rather loose federation. Before the Soulbury Commission, witnesses were inclined to evade questions about federation, except the individual witness who said he thought it impracticable. The demand was now for a single local government unit which should have control of a large share of the revenue arising in the area. It was argued that the State Council spent much money on grandiose schemes of irrigation and colonisation which could be more profitably employed in the repair of small village tanks. The aim should be to prevent depopulation rather than to settle new colonists. The facilities for education were also defective with the result that Kandyan boys were handicapped in competition for posts in the Government Service. As an immediate remedy for this handicap it was seriously suggested that twenty-five per cent of the posts should be reserved for Kandyans, the others to be filled by competition; while for the reserved twenty-five per cent the minimum qualifying pass standard should be sufficient. In the long run, of course, it was agreed that improved education would be the solution. The Tamils are the largest minority community. Their spokesmen were the chief, though by no means the only, exponents of the principle of balanced representation. The number of seats held by the majority community were to be equal, or approximately equal, to those held by the combined minorities. It was the principle of weightage carried to the extreme point. The majority community would not then be in a position to dominate. At first sight this would appear"
