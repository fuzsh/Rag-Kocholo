Ironically, it must have been finished just before the American War of Independence broke out in 1775\n\nAnchor Yard, EC1 The Anchor tavern in Old Street was recommended in the early eighteenth-century Guide to Good Fellows, and is mentioned again in 1799, but thereafter it cannot be traced\n\nAnderson Street, SW3 John Anderson was a trustee appointed to develop this estate\n\nAndover Place, NW6 was given a Hampshire place name by analogy with the other Hampshire names hereabouts\n\nAndrew Borde Street, WC2 Dr Andrew Borde owned the former Hospital Master’s House, which stood here\n\nAndrews Crosse, EC4 Andrews Crosse stood on the site of the courtyard of the former Andrews Crosse Inn\n\nAngel Arcade, EC1 The Angel was one of the commonest medieval inn-signs and gave its name to a multitude of little streets\n\nAngel Mews, N1 An ancient side street in Islington\n\nAnglers Lane, NW5 Anglers Lane once ran down to a small bridge across the River Fleet at a spot that was popular with fishermen\n\nAnn Lane, SW10 may be named after Mary Ann Riley\n\nAnn’s Close, SW1 Name first found in 1842. Origin unknown\n\nAnsdell Street, W8 commemorates Richard Ansdell whose animal paintings were highly popular with the Victorian public\n\nAnsleigh Place, W11 contains back entrances to buildings in St Antis Road and Stoneleigh Street\n\nApollo Place, SW10 First shown on a plan of ‘Mr Riley’s freehold’ dated 1829. Probably from an early tavern sign in Riley Street\n\nApothecary Street, EC4 leads to Apothecaries’ Hall\n\nAppled Tree Yard (St James’s 7) was once St James’s Field, described in 1650 as pasture ground planted with apple trees. Some of the trees were probably allowed to survive when this yard and the surrounding streets were built 25 years later. Samuel Pepys came to St James’s in 1688 : and there walk an hour of two; and in the King’s garden, and saw the Queen and ladies walk; and I did steal some apples off the trees.’\n\nAquila Street (St John’s Wood 3) was built in about 1840. Origin unknown.\n\nArcher Street (Soho 7). Origin unknown. First found in 1675, when it was called Arch Street.\n\nArchery Close (Bayswater 3) recalls a nearby Archery Ground used by the Royal Toxopholite Society from 1821 until the land was wanted for development in 1834. Bathurst Street and the Archery Tavern now cover its site.\n\nArchibald Mews (Mayfair 7) used to be John Court, after John, 5th Lord Berkeley who owned and developed the land. When and why John became Archibald is not known.\n\nArctic Street (Kentish Town 8) was originally Franklin Street, probably named after its Victorian builder. This was changed in 1937 because there were other London Franklin Streets, and Arctic was chosen by association of ideas : Sir John Franklin was the British Arctic explorer who died in an attempt to discover the North-West Passage in 1847.\n\nArdwick Road (North Hampstead 1). After Major Ardwick Burgess: see Burgess Hill, North Hampstead.\n\nArgyle Square, Street and Walk (King’s Cross 4) and neighbouring streets were built on Battle Bridge Field (see Battle Bridge Road) in 1824, a few years after the adjoining Tonbridge School Field was laid out with streets named after places near Tonbridge, Kent. As a contrast, the Battle Bridge names were chosen from the north of Britain: Argyle, or Argyll, in Scotland; Belgrove Street, formerly Belgrave Street (Warwickshire); Crestfield Street, formerly Chesterfield Street (Derbyshire); and Birkenhead Street (Cheshire). There were also once Manchester, Liverpool and Derby Streets here.\n\nArgyll Road (Kensington 6). After the Duke of Argyll, of Bedford Lodge : see Duchess of Bedford’s Walk, Kensington.\n\nArgyll Street (Oxford Street 7). The 2nd Duke of Argyll, soldier and statesman, a founder of the union of Scotland and England, owned a small field on the site of this street. He established his town house here, but it was demolished to make way for Little Argyll Street. After his death in 1743, his successor the 3rd Duke built a new mansion in Argyll Street, which remained the family home until 1808. The London Palladium now occupies its site. Ref: 208.\n\nAriel Road (Hampstead 1). Ariel was a Hebrew word signifying a water spirit. Milton featured Ariel as a fallen spirit in Paradise Lost, and Shakespeare and Pope used the name in The Tempest and The Rape of the Lock. Ariel is also one of the satellites of the planet Uranus, but the reason this street should be so named is not known.\n\nArlington. Sir Henry Bennet, one of the King’s supporters in the Civil War, who loyally followed the royal family into exile, was rewarded at the Restoration with the Earldom of Arlington, and became Charles II’s Secretary of State. In 1681 the king gave him the Six Acre Close, previously part of Green Park, on which Bennet Street and Arlington Street St James’s, are built. , Arlington also received from the king the Manor of Tottenham Court, which passed to his daughter Isabella, ‘a sweete child if ever there was any’ according to the diarist Evelyn. At 5-years-old she married the king’s little illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy. Their descendants built Arlington Road, Kentish Town (8) : see Fitzroy Square, Tottenham Court Road.\n\nArlington Way (Rosebery Avenue 5) was built in 1822 on the site of an old footpath from Islington village to Sadler’s medicinal wells. Origin of name unknown.\n\nArne Street (Long Acre, Covent Garden). Thomas Arne, the composer of Rule Britannia and Where the bee sucks was born near here in King Street, Covent Garden, in 1710. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, but Thomas smuggled a spinet into his bedroom and practised secretly at night, muffling the strings with a handkerchief. In a borrowed livery he studied opera from the servants’ gallery at Covent Garden Theatre where later he was to become official composer. He died in 1778 and is buried, appropriately, at St Paul’s, Covent Garden.\n\nArneway Street (Westminster 7). In honour of Thomas Arneway, who founded in 1603 a charity for ‘the pore of Saint Margarettes’ in Westminster.\n\nArtesian Road (Westbourne Park 2) was built across a field containing an Artesian well, sunk in the early nineteenth century by boring through the clay surface to the water-bearing gravel below. It supplied the surrounding countryside with water until the 1850s, when it was filled in so that Talbot Road could cross the site.\n\nArtillery. Artillery Row (Victoria Street 7) commemorates ‘the Shooteing house in Tuttle Fields’ which stood on the site of Artillery Mansions and contained the butts where the Westminster men held their artillery practice, ‘that is to witt for Long Bowes Crosbowes and Handgonnes’. The parish accounts mention payment ‘To Mr Fisher, for making the Butts at Tothill’ as early as 1517. These butts beside Artillery Row (an old path from the Shooting House onto Tothill Fields) were not removed until the beginning of the nineteenth century. On the other side of London is Artillery Lane (Bishopsgate 5), a track which led into another Artillery Yard, a walled field seized from the Priory of St Mary Spital by Henry VIII and given over to the Honourable Artillery Company for national defence work. Volunteers and regular soldiers practised there weekly as a precaution in case of invasion, gradually replacing bows and arrows with guns and cannon. After the Artillery Company moved to its present ground in City Road in 1641, Gun Street and Fort Street were built across the Artillery Yard.\n\nArundel Street (Strand 5) and its neighbourhood—Norfolk, Howard, Surrey and Maltravers Streets belong to the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk, and have been in the family since 1549. Here stood Arundel House, their town mansion, formerly Bath Inn, which Henry Fitzalan, ancestor of the Dukes of Norfolk, purchased after Henry VII seized it from the Bishop of Bath. The streets were built when the house was demolished in 1678. The powerful Howards, once close kin of the royal family and still the premier noble family of England, have held many titles which appear as street names in Inner London.\n\nAshbridge Street (Marylebone 3). Arthur Ashbridge was the District Surveyor of Marylebone from 1884 until 1918. The large collection of prints, maps and cuttings relating to the district that he made during that time was bequeathed to the borough at his death, and is kept at Marylebone Road Library. The street was named after him in 1938.\n\nAshburn Gardens and Place (South Kensington 6) were begun in 1873. Origin unknown.\n\nAshburnham Road (Chelsea 6) runs the length of what was once the great lawn of Ashburnham House, stretching from Lots Lane almost to the King’s Road. The old house and its grounds, the home of the 2nd Earl of Ashburnham in about 1780, were replaced by rows of dreary streets in 1878.\n\nAshdown Street (Kentish Town 8). Edwin Ashdown esquire bought up several scattered properties in the rapidly developing Kentish Town district in the 1860s, including a house in Malden Crescent backing on to the little field on which this street was built in 1865. Ashdown probably owned the field as well as the house.\n\nAshen Tree Court (Whitefriars Street, City). A relic of the White Friars’ shaded cloister walks.\n\nAshland Place (Marylebone 3). The Victorian fondness for euphemism seems to have been responsible for the change of this name from Burying Ground Passage in 1886. The burying ground, now the adjacent recreation ground, was the graveyard belonging to St Marylebone Church.\n\nAshley Place (Victoria). Probably after Anthony Ashley-Cooper, better known as the Earl of Shaftesbury . At the time this street was begun (about 1850) he was still known by his earlier title, Lord Ashley. He was already the leading philanthropist of his age, famed for his attempts to improve the lot of lunatics and chimney sweeps, to limit the factory workers’ day to 10 hours, to prevent women and children working underground in mines and to open Ragged Schools for working-class children.\n\nAshmill Street (Marylebone 3) was originally Devonshire Street—the Portman family (Portman Square), who owned this land, also had estates in Devonshire. Renamed in 1912 after a village in that county, because there is another Devonshire Street in Marylebone.\n\nAshworth Road (Paddington 3). Four parallel roads named Ashworth, Biddulph, Castellain and Delaware were all formed in 1875. It would seem that this is just an alphabetical series, with no intrinsic meaning.\n\nAstell Street (Chelsea 6). Mary Astell, a remarkable femininist and a forerunner of the suffragettes, lived in Chelsea in Royal Hospital Road. She planned to set up a sort of monastery where women could withdraw from men and lead useful lives, but the idea was ridiculed by Swift and Addison. She was buried in Chelsea Old Church in 1731.\n\nAtherstone Mews (South Kensington 6). The name of a Warwickshire town. Connection with Kensington unknown.\n\nAthlone Street (Kentish Town 8), has replaced a notorious black spot of the Kentish Town slums. Its decrepit Victorian cottages and tenements were demolished by the St Pancras Housing Society and in 1933 the first block of ten large flats on the estate was opened by HRH Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, after whom the building was named Athlone House. More land was purchased on the other side of the street and three further blocks of flats were erected and named after Lady Pentland, Mrs J. B. Priestley and Leonard Day, all tireless members of the St Pancras Housing Society. The Society then obtained the London County Council’s permission to name the street Athlone Street.\n\nAttneave Street (Farringdon Road 5). Named in 1895 after Mr A. Attneave of 192 Pentonville Road, a builder who had made some improvements in this area.\n\nAubrey Road and Walk (Kensington 6). Aubrey de Vaere was Lord of the Manor of Kensington, granted to him by William the Conqueror.\n\nAustin Friars. The Dutch church here is all that remains of the important Augustinian (Austin) Friary, founded in 1253, which covered all the area between London Wall and Throgmorton Street and was the principal priory of the Order in England. After the dissolution of the monasteries, most of this property passed to the Marquis of Winchester, but its church was given to the Dutch colony in London.\n\nAvenue Road and Close (St John’s Wood 1). An avenue is ‘a wide and handsome street, usually bordered by trees, a good description of this road, which was a broad tree-lined boulevard when first built in the 1830s. A turning out of it was named Avenue Close some years later.\n\nAvery Row (Mayfair 71) and Avery Farm Row (Pimlico 71). Avery is a corruption of the old name Ebury (q. v.).\n\nAvondale Park Gardens and Road (North Kensington 2). Avondale Park was opened in 1892, the year the death of the Duke of Avondale shocked and grieved the nation. The young Duke, who was the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra and therefore heir to the throne, was only 28-years-old and had just become engaged to Princess Mary of Teck when he suddenly died of pneumonia at Sandringham.\n\nAybrook Street (Marylebone) Aye brook was the alternative medieval name for the River Tyburn : probably provided the first syllable of the Westminster names Avery Row, Hay Hill and Ebury Street. The stream flowed across the south end of the street and the slope of the valley is still just perceptible.\n\nAylesbury Street (Clerkenwell). The south side of this street was once occupied by Aylesbury House, whose grounds stretched from here to Albemarle Way. The house was originally part of the priory of St John of Jerusalem, which passed to the Earls of Exeter after the dissolution of the monasteries, and then by marriage in 1646 to the 1st Earl of Aylesbury. It remained the town house of the Aylesbury’s until 1706.\n\nBabmaes Street (St James’s 7) is a corruption of the name of Baptist May, who according to Pepys was Charles II’s ‘court pimp’. So lavishly and successfully did he entertain the king that he was granted ‘several parcels of ground in Pall Mall Fields for building thereon a square [St James’s Square] of thirteen or four­ teen great and good houses’ which he was to hold in trust for Henry Jermyn (see Jermyn Street). The grant included most of the site of Babmaes Street.\n\nBack Hill (Mount Pleasant 5) and Back Lane (Hampstead 1). ‘Back’ was formerly a name frequently given to roads lying at the rear of a main thoroughfare. It dates from a period when an average village boasted only two streets: the High Road and the Back Road. When the high road became impassably rutted or muddy, the back road often tended to replace it; Back Road, Islington (now Liverpool Road), originally a track behind Upper Street, has become a major thoroughfare in its own right. As surfacing on highways improved, the mime ‘Back’ came to imply ‘inferior, obscure’, and almost died out as a street name, but has survived in the phrases ‘back street’ and ‘back slum’.\n\nBacon’s Lane (Highgate 8) adjoins Old Hall, on the site of Arundel House, where the great Sir Francis Bacon died in 1626. Sir Francis was conducting an experiment in refrigera­ tion-not to be developed for centuries after his death-by stuffing a dead fowl with snow, to see if it could be preserved. In the process he caught a cold, and being too ill to go home, was taken to Lord Arundel’s house at Highgate. The Earl was away from home and Bacon on his death-bed wrote to him apologetically:\n\n‘… As for the experiment itself, it succeeded excellently well; but in the journey between London and High gate I was taken with such a fit of casting as I know not whether it were the Stone, or some surfeit or cold, or indeed a touch of them all three. But when I reached your Lordship’s house, I was not able to go back, and therefore was forced to take up my lodging here, where your house­ keeper is very careful and diligent about me .. .’\n\n… but not diligent enough to air the damp bed, where Bacon con­ tracted pneumonia and died a few days later.\n\nBaker Street (Marylebone 3). William Baker ‘of Saint Marylebone, Gentleman’ signed in 1755 an important business agreement with the Portman family of Portman Square. He had already controlled the farms on the Portmans’ Maryle­ bone estate fof many years, and now he was to lease out the fields for building. The venture evidently proved successful: when several streets, including Baker Street, had been built, William’s descendants were created baronets and moved to their present family home of Ranston, at Shroton, near Stalbridge in Dorset, where they are country neighbours of the Portmans. In 1821 Sir Edward Baker purchased Lisson village green adjoining the London Portman estate (see end-map) and left it to his brother, Sir Talbot Hastings Bendall Baker. On the green are built Ranston, Stroton and Stalbridge Streets and Bendall Mews.\n\nBaldwin’s Gardens (Gray’s Inn Road 4) belonged to Richard Baldwyn (born c. 1561), who combined the function of Treasurer of the Middle Temple for 28 years with that of Keeper of Queen Elizabeth’s gardens. He built some houses here in 1589. Exactly a century later his descendant Baldwyn Higgens sold the property to the ancestor of the Barons Leigh, whose family retained it down to the twentieth century; hence Leigh Place, a small turning out of Baldwin’s Gardens.\n\nBales Court (Old Bailey, City) was named in memory of Peter Bales (1547-1610) who set up a leading school of penmanship near the top of Old Bailey, ‘that teacheth to write all manner of handes, after a more speedie way than hath heretofore been taught’.\n\nBalfour Place (Mayfair 7) was rebuilt in 1891 and probably named after Arthur James Balfour, who became First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Commons in that year.\n\nBalliol Road (North Kensington 2). One of the Oxford place names given to turnings out of Oxford Gardens.\n\nBanbury Court (Long Acre). In 1647 Nicholas, Earl of Banbury bought a town house in Long Acre, then newly built up and fashionable, and named it Banbury House. It was demolished in 1699 so that this court could be cut through the site.\n\nBankside (Southwark 5). A very old road along the Thames bank, which was artificially raised to protect the fields behind. Southwark was a marshy, low-lying area and the water level beyond the bank was watched with anxious eyes when the tide was expected to be high:\n\nIt was the day, what time the powerful moon\n\nMakes the poor Banksider creature wet its shoon\n\nIn its own Hall,\n\nwrote Ben Jonson. An early fourteenth-century document records concern about the ‘Bank in theland of the Bishop of Winchester in South­ wark, which having been anciently made for the safeguard thereof, was then ruinous and broken’. The bank has been heightened and strengthened in recent years and many times in the past, to keep pace with the level of the Thames, which has gradually risen through the centuries owing to the tilting of the land-mass of England and the narrowing of the river bed when the Embankments were built. Refs: 115, 17, 202.\n\nBanner Street (Finsbury 5). The Middlesex Land Registry records ‘ various members of the Banner family residing and owning property in and near Old Street round about 1789, the year this street was built.\n\nThere was Henry Banner, carpenter, and Mary his wife, their son Francis, described as an ‘upholsterer of Aldersgate Street’, and John Banner, plumber, who lived in Whitecross Street just round the corner from Banner Street.\n\nBaptist Gardens (Kentish Town 8). The four mid-Victorian cui-de-sacs leading out of Queen’s Crescent were originally all named after saints : St James’s (now Modbury) Gardens, St Ann’s Gardens, St John’s Gardens and St Thomas’ Gardens. St John’s has since been changed to Baptist by association with St John the Baptist.\n\nBarbican (Aldersgate Street, City). A barbican was an extra fortification outside a medieval wall. The name is first found in London in 1279, referring to the watchtower just north of the city wall which guarded the road to the Aldersgate. It was part of a ring of defences, natural and man­ made, supplementing London Wall itself: on the south flowed the Thames, the east was guarded by the Tower, the west by the Fleet River and the Bailey (see Old Bailey), while the barbican and the swampy Moor Fields protected against invasion from the north.\n\nBarbon Close (Holborn 4). Nicholas Barbon (c. 1640-1698) was a doctor of medicine, speculator, founder of Fire Insurance, businessman, economist, jerry-builder, MP and confidence trickster. Through his varied career the common denominator was profit­ eering. He introduced Fire Insurance just after the panic of the Great Fire of 1666, and at the same time started to buy or lease ail the available building land near the City that he could lay hands on. Landowners who listened to his glib persuasions often lived to regret it: under him mass­ produced terraced houses, another innovation, soon sprang up-and sometimes fell down again as quickly. Wben he started to build Red Lion Square, the lawyers of Gray’s Inn were so angry that they marched in a body and assaulted the workmen. However, Barbon’s houses there and in Great Ormond Street near the entrance to Barbon Close are still standing.\n\nBarge House Street (Southwark). An ancient lane, which led to the Royal Barge House, where the English sovereigns kept their Thames barges by Tudor times. The Barge House stood at the water’s edge above a creek at the end ofBroadwall and probably fell into disuse during the Commonwealth, since in 1676 it was described as ‘a certain ruinous house called the King’s Old Barge House’.\n\nBarley Mow Passage (Long Lane, City). There has been a Barley Mow inn here for at least two centuries. Its sign is perhaps not so much a tribute to the brewers’ cereal as a corruption of St Bartholomew, in whose priory precinct it stands (see Bartholomew).\n\nBarnard’s Inn (High Holborn, City) was originally a medieval mansion belonging to the Dean of Lincoln and occupied in 1450 by Lionel Barnard, who converted it into an Inn of Chancery. Sir Francis Bacon was one of its members. The Inn closed down when the Dean of Lincoln sold the site in 1888.\n\nBarnby Street (Euston 4) was formerly Bedford Street, being part of the Duke of Bedford’s land, but there were so many Bedford Streets in the area that in 1896 the London County Cmmcil decided to change it. Renamed after Joseph Barnby, Victorian composer and conductor, who had recently died.\n\nBarnsbury Road (Islington 5). Bamsbury Manor, stretching from Highgate Hill in the north to Pentonville in the south, took its name from the bury, or manor house, of the Berners family. By at least 1235, and probably earlier, William de Bemers held land here which stayed in the famlly until John, Chancellor of the Exchequer and last Lord Berners, died in 1532. After that the manor passed to Sir Thomas Fowler (Fowler Road) and then by marriages in the family to Sir William Halton (Halton Road) and to William Tufnell Jollife (Tufuell Park). Ref:70.\n\nBamsdale Road (Paddington 2) dates from 1868. Probably just a ruralistic ‘advertising’ name.\n\nBaron Street (Pentonville 5) was originally Barron Street, from a field here called Barron’s Layers­ ‘layers’ being a local word for a meadow planted with clover belonging to Mr Joseph Barron. He acquired the field in 1753 and lived in a house beside it until the street was built in 1787.\n\nBarrett Street (Marylebone 3) was intended as the continuation of Henrietta Place, and was originally named as such, but the building of Stratford Place (q.v.) prevented the two ends from meeting. It was eventually named more appropriately after Thomas Barrett, who died about 1760 and was the land-owner of this small plot at the time the street was begun.\n\nBarrow Hill Road (St John’s Wood 8). Barrow Hill, the smaller eminence beside Primrose Hill, was so called as early as the year 986, and for generations was believed to be a prehistoric barrow, or burial site. But no evidence was found when the reservoir was dug on its summit in the early nineteenth century, and the name may come from Old English ‘baeruwe’, meaning grove or wood, having no connection with barrows. Barrow Hill Road, built on the Barrow Hill Fields, was planned to go all the way to the Hill, but only this short road materialised.\n\nBarter Street (Bloomsbury 4) was formerly Bloomsbury Market. The first bartering here was probably done by servants from the houses of Bloomsbury Square; the Earl of Southampton (see Southampton Row) began the Square in 1661 and provided the market to serve it the following year. For some reason the market was never a great success­ probably because Southampton’s heirs were the Dukes of Bedford, who already owned Covent Garden Market and would not encourage competition with it. Bloomsbury Market was finally demolished with the building of New Oxford Street (1847).\n\nRefs: 304, 330.\n\nBartholomew. Bartholomew Close (Smithfield 5) is a tortuous narrow lane, winding through the enclosed precinct or close of St Bartholomew’s Priory, ‘closed in with walls and gates and locked every night’ until the sixteenth century. The monastic buildings and the wall are pictured on Plate rr, the Agas map of c. 1560. The priory was founded in 1123 by Rahere, Henry I’s jester, who according to the legend ‘was rescued from the jaws of hell by Bartholomew himself, in return for a pledge to build a Priory and Hos­ pital’. All that remains of the priory is the Norman church ofSt Bartholo mew-the-Great, but the adjoining hospital survived the dissolution of the monasteries, and is now the oldest hospital in London.\n\nLike many religious foundations, St Batholomew’s was richly endowed with graots of land. Bartholomew Square (Finsbury 5) was built in 1811 on a field held by the priory since 1328. Nearby Baldwin Street is named after Richard Baldwyn, Treas urer of the Hospital at the time of development. There were also properties in Kentish Town, first acquired by the hospital in the twelfth century, and added to by charitable citizens. One of the fields, developed in the 1860s, now contains Bartholomew Road and Villas (8).\n\nBartholomew Lane (City 5) contained the church of St Bartholomew­ by-the-Exchange. Its site is now taken over by the new enlarged Stock Exchange.\n\nBartlett Court (New Fetter Lane 5) belonged in about 1615 to Thomas Bartlett, said to be Court Printer to Edward VI.\n\nBarton Street (Westminster 7) and Cowley Street were built in 1722 by Barton Booth (1681-1733), a famous actor of his day. He came from a well-to-do family which owned property in Westminster and also at Cowley, near Uxbridge.\n\nBasil Street (Chelsea 7). Origin unknown.\n\nBasing Street (Nolting Hill 2). In 1549 Edward VI granted the Manor of Notting Hill, which his father had claimed for the Crown, to Sir William Paulet, Lord StJohn of Basing, who became Lord High Treasurer and Marquis of Winchester soon afterwards. Lord St John sold the manor to pay off some debts in 1562.\n\nBasinghall Avenue and Street (City 5) are part of the Ward of Bassishaw. Both names are derived from the Basings’ ‘baga’, or enclosed house. The Basings came from Basingstoke in Hampshire originally, but before 1200 they settled in the City and became one of its leading families. Solomon Basing was Lord Mayor in 1216, as was Adam Basing in 1251. It was the custom for powerful men to take over the guard, or •weard’, of a section of the city, and thus their name came to be applied to the ward, and so surv1ved for centuries.\n\nBassett Street (Kentish Town 8). George Bassett was Surveyor to the Fitzroys, Barons Southampton, who owned large estates in Kentish Town, Tottenham Court Road and High­ gate (see Fitzroy Square). Bassett and his family were responsible for developing much of Kentish Town from the 1840s onwards.\n\nBassishaw Highwalk (City) is part of the post-war re-development of Bassishaw Ward.\n\nBastwick Street (Goswell Road 5) was so named by the local Vestry in 1885. Bastwick is a village in Norfolk, but it has no obvious connection with this street.\n\nBateman’s Buildings (Soho Square) crosses the site of the mansion and grounds of Monmouth House in Soho Square, once the home of the Duke of Monmouth, Charles II’s ambitious illegitimate son. After Monmouth’s execution in 1685 the house fell into decay until finally it was sold to Sir James Bateman, Lord Mayor of London, in 1717. When his grandson, the 2nd Lord Bateman, inherited it in 1744 he found the mansion too large for his own needs and difficult to let as a whole, since by then Soho was no longer a fashionable residential area. So in 1773 he had Monmouth House demolished and Bateman’s Buildings, then a double row of smaller houses, erected to replace it. Bateman Street was named after Bateman’s Buildings in 1884.\n\nBath Street (City Road 5) Led to ‘The Pleasure Bath, Peerless Pool, City Road.\n\nBattersea Bridge (6). ‘ea’ means ‘island’ or ‘marshy ground’, and it seems that low-lying Battersea beside the Thames was once encircled by a little back-water from the river.\n\n‘Batters’ is probably a corruption of the name of its Anglo-Saxon chieftain. The first Battersea Bridge was erected in 1771 and made of wood. An iron bridge replaced it a century later.\n\nBattle Bridge Lane (Bermondsey 5) skirted the east side of the medieval town house belonging to Battle Abbey, Hastings. A little stream ran alongside the lane on its way from the Maze Pond (q.v.) to the Thames, and the Abbot of Battle built a bridge over it to serve as his Thames-side landing­ stage.\n\nBattle Bridge Road (King’s Cross 4). Battle Bridge was the ancient name for the hamlet around modern King’s Cross. The bridge crossed the River Fleet, which meandered through the village . but what was the battle? Legends tell of Boadicea defeated here by the Romans, or Alfred fighting the Danes, or the East Saxons clashing with William the Conqueror. More likely are batells (French ‘bateau’), flat­ bottomed boats plying in the shallow Fleet.\n\nBayley Street (Bedford Square 4): after Sir John Bayley, a celebrated Victorian Judge, who lived at 41 Bedford Square in the 1820s.\n\nBaynes Court (Coldbath Square, Clerkenwell) : see Coldbath Square.\n\nBaynes Mews (Hampstead 1). In memory of Thomas Spencer Baynes (1823-1887), one of the editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, who used to live in Hampstead.\n\nBaynes Street (Camden Town 8). So named in 1937 after Sydney Baynes, who had been chief electrical engineer for the local Borough Council for many years, and lived nearby at 57 Pratt Street.\n\nBayswater (3) was the watering­ place belonging to an Anglo-Norman called Bayard or Baynard. It is situated at the point where the River Westbourne crosses the Roman Bayswater Road. In addition to this river, now flowing in a sewer-pipe under Brook Mews North (see end­ map), Bayswater’s gravelly soil held springs and wells which once supplied much of the City of London with water, and are remern bered in Spring Street, Conduit Place and Artesian Road nearby.\n\nBeak Street (Soho 7) owes its name to Thomas Beake, one of Queen Anne’s Messengers, who acquired a plot of land on the north side of the street in about 1680. This was the period of the great building boom which followed the Fire of 1666, when speculative builders, who might be anybody from aristocrats to labourers, entered the development business with a fair hope of making a quick fortune. The bigger specu­ lators, often financiers or courtiers like Beake, purchased the land, divided it into building plots and leased them singly to the lesser speculators, masons and carpenters, who erected the houses.\n\nBear Alley (Farringdon Street 5). From a seventeenth century inn-sign. The Bear was a common sign, reflecting the popularity of the cruel sport of bear-baiting, which took place at inn yards all over the country.\n\nBear Gardens (Southwark 5). The gory sport of bear-baiting was popular in England by the early middle ages; the bear, tied to a stake, was set upon by three or four\n\ndogs, while the audience placed bets on the result or simply enjoyed the fight. The first known mention of Bankside in Southwark as a baiting centre dates from 1546, when Hemy viii declared the abolition of the Bankside brothels and bull rings; however, the king was probably just trying to channel this considerable source ·or income into his own pocket, since a few months later the Yeoman of His Majesty’s Bears was permitted to ‘make pastime’ on Bankside. The Bear Baiting, which stood on the site of this alley, was a circular building like the early theatres, ‘wherein be kept bears, bulls and other beasts, to be baited; as also mastiffs in several kennels, nourished to bait them. These bears are there baited in plots of ground, scaffolded for the beholders to stand safe’. Sometimes this scaffolding collapsed with fatal results, and frequently maimed dogs were flung into the laps of the spectators.\n\nNot everybody approved of the sport. ‘Of Bearbaytynge’, written in\n\n1550, exclaims:\n\nWhat follye is thys, to kepe wyth daunger,\n\nA greate mastyfe dogge and a\n\nfoule ouglye beare;\n\nAnd to thys onelye ende, to se\n\nthem two fyght,\n\nWyth terrible tearynge, a full\n\nouglye syght.\n\nSamuel Pepys went to many bear fights on Bankside, but as he grew older found them ‘a very rude and nasty pleasure’. Evelyn the diarist thought them ‘butcherly sports, or rather barbarous cruelties’ and left ‘most heartily weary of the rude and dirty pastime’ after a visit to the Bear Garden in 1670. The Bankside Garden closed down not long after this; but bear baiting was not suppressed in other parts of England unti1 1835.\n\nBear Street (Leicester Square 7). From the heraldic device of the landowners, the Earls of Leicester.\n\nBeatty Street (Camden Town 4), built soon after the Battle of Trafalgar, was originally one of London’s many Nelson Streets dating from that period. To end the confusion between them it was renamed in 1937 in memory of both Sir William Beatty, the surgeon who tended Nelson’s fatal wound on board the Victory at Trafalgar, and Admiral Lord Beatty, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the First World War, who died in 1936.\n\nBeauchamp Place (South Kensington 7) was so named in 1885. Origin unknown.\n\nBeaufort Street (Chelsea 6). The Dukes of Beaufort had a sumptuous mansion on the site of the southern end of this street. Beaufort House was originally built for Sir Thomas More, and its atmosphere is conveyed in his masterpiece Utopia, ‘the author’s home writ large’. The Beauforts sold the house in 1737 to Sir Hans Sloane, Lord of Chelsea Manor, who demolished it and formed the street.\n\nBeaumont Place (Tottenham Court Road 4) stands on the site of a ‘cow tier’ attached to Tottenham Court, which the Fitzroy family, Lords of the Manor of Tottenham\n\nCourt, leased for development to a builder called Joseph Beaumont in 1791.\n\nBeaumont Street (Marylebone 3) is on part of the site of Marylebone Gardens, ‘by much the pleasantest place about town’ according to the Daily Courant, ‘and thought by the nobility and gentry to be very commodious for breakfast’. And to add excitement to pleasure, ‘the proprietor offers a reward often guineas for the apprehension of any highwayman found on the road to the gardens’. But the proprietor’s lease expired in 1777, whereupon the gardens were divided into plots and leased out for building by Sir Beaumont Hotham. Sir Beaumont, the younger son of a baronet, was a friend of Viscount Weymouth, the brother-in-law of the ground landlord.\n\nBedale Street (Southwark 5) was originally known descriptively as Foul Lane (in contrast to adjacent Stoney Street). Then in about 1800 the old name was no longer considered suitable, and it was changed to York Street, in compliment to the Grand Old Dnke, the Prince Regent’s brother (see York). However, there were so many London York Streets dating from that period that in 1891 it was changed again to avoid confusion, and York was replaced by the Yorkshire town of Bedale.\n\nBedford Gardens (Kensington)\n\nBuilt in the 1830s and probably named after the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, who lived close by: see Duchess of Bedford’s Walk.\n\nBedford Row (Holborn 4) has no connection with the Duke of Bedford’s lands nearby-it is part of Harpur’s Bedford Charity estate. Sir William Harpur, commemorated in Harpur Street, was born in Bedford in 1496. He arrived in London as a young apprentice, and rose in wealth and position to become Lord Mayor. By this time (1561) Bedford, like so many English towns, had been deprived of its local Church school at the dissolution of the monasteries, so Sir William refounded Bedford School and endowed it with thirteen acres of hunting land here at Holborn to ensure its financial viability. Green Street, now adapted to Emerald Street, on Harpur’s estate, may commemorate Edmond Greene, its first headmaster. The property still belongs to Bedford Corporation. Three other estates in this neighbourhood were bequeathed to provincial schools at the same period: see Rugby, Tonbridge and Aldenbam Streets.\n\nBedford Square, Avenue, Place and Way (Bloomsbury 4), Bedford Court, Street and Bedfordbury (Covent Garden 4) and Bedford Passage (off Charlotte Street) indicate the London possessions which the Russells of Bedford received in two stages, the first for merit in 1552 and the second by marriage in 1669. At the time the estates were unimportant orchard or pasture lands, yet they were to yield more profit to the later Dukes of Bedford than all the family’s numerous country properties.\n\nThe first London acquisition was the Covent Garden and Long Acre (the neighbourhood around present· day Covent Garden), which Edward VI gave the 1st Earl of Bedford for negotiating the surrender of Bou­ logne. The Garden was developed about 80 years later by Inigo Jones and Francis, 4th Earl of Bedford, who named the streets after himself his in-laws, and the Royal Family.\n\nThe other property came into the family when Francis’ grandson Wil· liam married Lady Rachel, daughter and heiress of the 4th Earl of Southampton, whose great-grandfather had been granted the Manor of Bloomsbury by Henry VIII. Bloomsbury extended from High Holbom to the Euston Road, between Tottenham Court Road and Southampton Row, with a few detached fields: one on the west side of Tottenham Court Road, and three adjoining Crowndale Road, Camden Town (see end-map), all now bearing street-names connected with the Bedford family. William started to build on the Holbom end of the property as soon as he acquired it, and his successors worked gradually north until finally houses covered the Crownda!e Road area in about 1850. Not all this property has remained\n\nin the family; Covent Garden was sold by the 11th Duke before the First World War, the Crowndale Road land at the other extremity of the estates went in 1933 and the fringes of what was left have been nibbled by purchasers; but the family names on more than seventy London streets continue to bear witness to three centuries of Bedford ownership.\n\nBeech Street (City 6A) was called le Bech lane as early as 1279, probably from a beech grove beside it.\n\nBeehive Passage (Leadenhall Market, City) was built across the site of a Beehive Tavern situated rather inappropriately in the poultry section of Leadenhall Market until 1885, when the Market was rebuilt.\n\nBeeston Place (Belgravia 7). Part of the Grosvenor family estate: see Grosvenor Square.\n\nBelgrave. Belgrave is a hamlet in Cheshire which the first Earl Grosvenor purchased in 1758. In 1784 he was created Viscount Belgrave, a title which his descendants, the Dukes of Westminster, still hold. When his son, Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster, decided to develop part of his Westminster lands in 1824, the names of Belgrave and other Cheshire and Flint properties were given to the streets and squares. Belgrave Square 7), happening to be the focal point of the area, gave the name Belgravia to thls select district. Belgrave Place and Upper and Lower Belgrave Street date from the same period. The Grosvenor estate in Pimlico was begun a few years later: Belgrave Road, Pimlico (7), was built in about 1830.\n\nIn consequence of Belgravia’s prosperity the name then became very fashionable, and propagated wildly in the outer suburbs until the London County Council intervened-a strange fate for a tiny village on the Welsh border. Belgrave Gardens, St John’s Wood (3), was apparently named simply for this cachet of respectability.\n\nBell Inn Yard (Gracechurch Street 5) commemorates a Bell Inn which stood here until the Great Fire of 1666. There is a plaque marking its site near the end of the Yard.\n\nBell Street (Edgware Road 3) was Bell Lane three hundred years ago, a little village street behind Lisson Green. It led to the Bell Field, which was probably attached to a Bell Inn in Edgware Road.\n\nBell Wharf Lane (Upper Thames Street 5). Probably named from an old tavern sign.\n\nBell Yard (Fleet Street 5). Le Belle, a ‘capital messuage’ large house­ stood here at the time of the dis­ solution of the monasteries and belonged to the Knights of St John. A plan dated 1592 in the British Museum indicates Bell Yard but does not mark the house, which had presumably been demolished by then. Later there was a Bell Tavern here, but now that too has gone.\n\nBelmont Street (Chalk Farm 8). Belmont, ‘beautiful mountain’, was a common Victorian street name, especially in areas where it was most inappropriate. There are also Belmonts in Camberwell, Lewisham, Shoreditch, Woolwich and Wands­ worth. An ‘advertising’ name.\n\nBelsize (Hampstead 1). Belassis, ‘beautifully situated’, was an aptly named manor house and park on the site of Belsize Square, halfway up the wooded slopes of Hampstead. Belsize Lane wound through the estate by an early date, and there was a grand tree-lined drive up to the house which is now Belsize Avenue. Belsize Park was once a footpath through the Park, and Belsize Park Gardens was Cut-Throat Lane, a lonely cart track to the nearest neighbour, Chalcots Farm in England’s Lane.\n\nIn 1316 Roger le Brabazon, Chief Justice to Edward II, bequeathed Bel-assis to the monks of Westminster Abbey, provided they said a daily mass for himself and for the Earl and Countess of Lancaster. Westminster Abbey remained Lord of Belsize Manor until 1887, and when the estate was developed Lancaster Drive and Grove were named after the old Earl and Buckland Crescent after the Dean of Westminster. Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister who was assassinated in the House of Commons in 1812, was a resident of Belsize House; he is remembered in Perceval Avenue, Belsize.\n\nBelvedere Road (Lambeth 4). The Belvidere (‘Fine View’) tavern and pleasure gardens opened here on the site of the Royal Festival Hall in 1718. It advertised ‘all sorts of wines of the prime growths’ and ‘eatables of every kind in season, after the best manner’. Guests could also enjoy ‘the choicest river fish, which they may have the diversion to see taken’.\n\nBendall Mews (Bell Street, Lisson Grove) belonged to Sir Talbot Hastings Bendall Baker.\n\nBenjamin Street (Clerkenwell 5) dates from about 1740. Origin unknown; probably the name of the builder or landowner.\n\nBennet Street (StJames’s 7) belonged to Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington.\n\nBennet’s Hill (Queen Victoria Street, City). St Benet’s Church was first built in the early twelfth century and dedicated to Benedict, the sixth century founder of the Benedictine order.\n\nBennett’s Mews (Southwark 5). This name is found in the area by 1720, when Bennet Street (now Rennie Street) was a narrow lane across the lonely Southwark marshes from Marigold Stairs on the Thames to Christ Church. Bennet was probably the developer who first erected houses along the lane.\n\nRef: 303.\n\nBennett’s Yard (Westminster 7) first appears in the parish rate-books in the year 1647. Five householders were then rated in the yard, one of them being a Mr Thomas Bennett.\n\nBentinck Street (Marylebone 3). Hans Willem Bentinck was the Dutch envoy responsible for arranging the marriage of Prince Wiiiiam of Orange to the Princess Mary, future Queen of England. As a leading adviser to William in his new king­ dom he was showered with rewards, including vast estates in England and Ireland, and the English Earldom of Portland. His grandson, William Bentinck, married the daughter of Edward Harley, and thereby acquired the land on which this street is built: see Harley Street.\n\nBerkeley Gardens (Kensington Church Street): see Sheffield Terrace, Kensington.\n\nBerkeley Mews (Marlebone 3). A turning out of Upper Berkeley Street.\n\nBerkeley Square and Street (Mayfair 7). John Berkeley was born about 1607, the youngest son of Sir Maurice Berkeley of Bruton in Somerset. He was a royalist commander during the Civil War, and after a victory at Stratton in Cornwall was created Baron Berkeley of Stratton. By a judicious marriage he added wealth to the title, and in 1664 bought a field fronting Piccadilly, as a site for a town mansion befitting his status.\n\nA few years later Berkeley House was completed in spacious grounds on the site of the present Devonshire House, Piccadilly. John Evelyn the diarist described it as a ‘sweete place’, with\n\n‘by far the most noble gardens, courts, and accommodations, stately porticos, &c. anywhere about the towne’. But by the time Lord Berkeley died in 1678, land along Piccadilly was so valuable that his widow could not resist sacrificing two strips of garden on either side of Berkeley House to the builders; Berkeley Street and Stratton Street were the result. Lord Berkeley’s son John sold the house to the Duke of Devonshire in 1696.\n\nMeanwhile in about 1675 the family had bought Hay Hill Farm, a 28-acre farm adjoining Berkeley House gardens. This stayed in the family after Berkeley House had been sold, and the 1st Lord’s grandson John, 5th Baron Berkeley built Berkeley Square, Bruton Lane, Place and Street and Charles Street (after his uncle or brother) on it in the 1740s. The farm belonged to the Berkeleys until the line finally expired in 1942.\n\nBerkley Road (Chalk Farm 8) is probably one of the hundreds of English suburban Berkeleys and Berkleys named in emulation of the select elegance that was once a part of Berkeley Square, Mayfair.\n\nBermondsey is recorded as Vermun desei in AD 708, the ‘ei’ or ‘marshy land’ of Beornmund. The low-lying village was intersected by numerous little streams. Bermondsey Street (5 so called by 1379, led from Tooley Street to Bermondsey Abbey, whose main cloister is now Bermondsey Square.\n\nBernard Street (Russell Square 4). Once part of the grounds of Captain Coram’s Foundling Hospital.\n\nBerners Place and Street (Oxford Street 4). In 1654 ‘Josias Bemers of the parish of Saint James Clerkenwell in the county of Middlesex Esquire’ purchased ‘for the sume of nyne hundred and seventie Pounds of lawful! English money’ a field called the Newlands (see end-map) on the north side of Oxford Street, ‘situate and being in the parish of Maribom’. His descendant William Bemers started to develop the land in 1738, and built on it Berners Street and Place and Newman Street. (It is said that he also owned Newman Hall at Quendon in Essex).\n\nBerry Place (Clerkenwell 5) was formerly Mulberry Place, in memory of the Mulberry Pleasure Garden which opened in 1742 in Corporation Row. Despite its mulberry trees, skittle alleys, concerts and firework displays, the garden did not attract the public sufficiently to make a profit, and was built over within a few years.\n\nBerry Place (Clerkenwell Road 5) is recorded as the property of a Kentish farmer called Thomas Berry in 1803, the year the street name first appears.\n\nBertram Street (Highgate 8). A Victorian name of unknown origin.\n\nBerwick Street (Soho 4) was built during the religious turmoils of 1688-9 by a Papist named James Pollett. By giving his street this name, Pollett may have been declaring\n\nallegiance to the Catholic Duke of Berwick, James n’s dashing young iJlegitimate son, who was then fighting in Ireland and on the conti­ nent to restore his father to the throne.\n\nBessborough Gardens, Place, Street and Way and Ponsonby Place and Terrace (Westminster 7) were begun in about 1841 and named in honour of John Ponsonby, Baron Duncannon of Bessborough. As First Commissioner of Woods and Forests Ponsonby was required to take an active part in the improvements and developments going on in London (including the designing of the present Houses of Parliament), and must have been responsible for these streets, which were Woods and Forests Department property. He was the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne.\n\nBetterton Street (Drury Lane 4). In honour of Thomas Betterton (c. 1635-1710), ‘the best actor in the world’ according to Pepys. He began his association with this district in 1659\n\nas an apprentice when he made an amateur appearance at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane, and he was later to become the leader of the\n\nUnited Company at Drury Lane.\n\nBevin Way (Clerkenwell 4). The Bevin Court Flats here were opened in April 1954 by Dame Florence Bevin, the widow of Labour statesman Ernest Bevin, on the third anniversary of his death.\n\nBevington Road (North Kensington 2). Bevington is a village in Gloucestershire. Connection with North Kensington unknown.\n\nBevis Marks (City 5). On the south-west side of Bevis Marks, occupying the land between Bury Street and Heneage Lane, stood ‘one great house, large of rooms, fair courts and garden plots’. It belonged to the Abbots of Bury St Edmunds, and was known as Bury’s Marks.\n\n‘Bury’s’ was corrupted to ‘Bevis’ during the middle ages, probably through scribal confusion between rand v. ‘Marks’ meant ‘boundary’ or ‘territory’, and appears in the words ‘margin’, ‘demarcation’ and ‘marquis’, the guardian of the frontier. When Henry VIII dissolved Bury Abbey, the Heneage family acquired the property.\n\nBickenball Street (Marylebone 3):\n\nsee Portman Square, Marylebone.\n\nBidborough Street (King’s Cross 4). Bidborough is a village two miles from Tonbridge: see Tonbridge Street King’s Cross.\n\nBiddulph Road (Paddington 3): see\n\nAshworth Road, Paddington.\n\nBilling Place, Road and Street (Fulham Road) ) stand on the site of the Billing Well Fields beside Billing­ well Ditch. This stream rose in Kensal Green Cemetery and flowed down to Chelsea (see end-map), where a stump of it survives as the Chelsea Creek, although the rest was filled in to take the tracks of the West London Railway. The ditch was once important for drainage and sewage and possibly even navigation, and a record dated 1410 mentions one John Lane in trouble for not scouring the ditch ‘at Byllingwelle’. A few years later we find tenants ordered to cleanse the stream from ‘Countas­ bregge [at Kensington High Street] to Billyng Wellditch’.\n\nRefs: 162, 100.\n\nBillingsgate (Lower Thames Street, City) was the chief City watergate, or quay, for fishing vessels mooring and landing their cargoes, by the early middle ages. An explanation of the name was given by Geoffrey de Monmouth in the twelfth century: ‘Belin a king of the Britons, about four hundred years before Christ’s Nativity, built this gate and named it Belin’s gate, after his own calling; and when he was deadhis body being burnt, the ashes m a vessel of brass were set upon a high pinnacle of stone over the same gate’. Stow writing his Survey of London in 1S98, is rightly sceptical of this version: ‘It seemeth to me not to be so ancient, but rather to have taken that name of some later owner of the place, haply named Beling or Biling’.\n\nBilliter Street (City 5) was Belseter· slane in 1298, the lane of the Bell· founders. Employment for a whole streetful of bellmakers was provided by the 100 churches in the City. Bells tolled not just for Sunday services and weddings as they do now but for all the main hours and devotions of the day, which directed the medieval citizen’s work, leisure and worship, and for the important ‘couvre-feu’, the curfew or lights-out. The little bells of beggars, animals and peddlars added to the ceaseless tinkling and pealing of London in the middle ages.\n\nBina Gardens (South Kensington 6). Name approved in 1866. Origin unknown.\n\nBingham Place (Marylebone 3) was named in 1892 after a town near Nottingham, the street being next to Nottingham Place.\n\nBirchin Lane (City 5) is found as Berchervere Lane in 1193. Eilert Ekwall, the leading authority on early City names, derives it from an otherwise unrecorded Old English word ‘beardceorfere’, ‘beard-cutter’; hence Lane of the Barbers.\n\nBird Street (Oxford Street 4) was begun in 1763 by Thomas Bird, a bricklayer. It formed the continuation of Binney Street, also called Bird Street originally, which he built in 1739.\n\nBird-in-Hand Yard (Hampstead High Street). The Bird in Hand tavern in the High Street has adjoined this yard since at least 1783.\n\nBirdcage Walk (St James’s Park 7). It is not widely known by Londoners that James I was in his time renowned for his love of wild-life, and collected a large menagerie of exotic animals and birds which he housed at enormous expense in StJames’s Park. His grandson Charles II continued the collection and remodelled the park, and it was probably then that the cages of the ‘volery’ were placed along the avenue which became known as Birdcage Walk.\n\nBisham Gardens (Highgate 8). In memory of Bisham House, a seventeenth-century villa in Highgate High Street, demolished in 1884. The street was formed across its gardens, which stretched to Swains Lane.\n\nBishop’s Bridge Road (Paddington 3) is shown on old maps as a path from Paddington Green to Westbourne Green, bridging the River Westbourne. The first Bishop here was Nicholas Ridley, Bishop of London, who was granted Paddington by the boy-king Edward VI. He was burnt at the stake by Edward’s sister Mary, but his successors in the See of London are still Lords of Paddington Manor and own most of the freehold land.\n\nCromwell seized Paddington during the Commonwealth period, but at the Restoration it reverted to the powerful Bishop Gilbert Sheldon, who leased the Manor to his nephews, Sir Joseph and Daniel Sheldon. (After the Sheldons’ lease expired in 1740, it passed to the Fredericks, whose family names cover the area: see Southwick Street). The estate was developed from 1795 on, and four consecutive bishops were commemorated in street names as urbanisation spread: Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London 1787-1808; John Randolph; William Howley, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1828, and Charles James Blomfield (I786-1857). Hence London Street, Sheldon Street, Porteus Road, Randolph Avenue, Crescent, Gardens and Road, Howley Place and Blomfield Crescent, Road and Villas.\n\nBishopsgate (City 5) was a Roman road, entering the City through one of the gates on the north side (see end-map). It gained its name from a tradition that the gate was restored in Saxon times by Saint Erkenwald, Bishop of London and Prince of East Anglia, who died in 693; just inside its site stands the medieval church of St Ethelburga, the only church in England dedicated to Erkenwald’s sister. In the middle ages the Bishop of London was responsible for keeping the hinges of the gate in good repair, and in return, ‘from every cart laden with wood he has one stick as it enters the said gate’. The gate was demolished in 1760, and on the site are two old plaques adorned with golden mitres, stating that ‘Adjoining to this spot BISHOPS­ GATE formerly stood’.\n\nBishopsgate Churchyard crosses the old graveyard of St Botolph-without­ Bishopsgate, now converted into gardens and tennis courts.\n\nBlack Horse Yard (Aldersgate Street 5). From a seventeenth-century Black Horse inn in Aldersgate Street, destroyed during the First World War.\n\nBlack Swan Alley (London Wall, City). A Blade Swan Tavern stood on the corner with London Wall in the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nBlackburn Road (Hampstead 1) dates from 1869, and is probably named after William Blackburn, a Pentonville builder, who erected houses in and around Frognal in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nBlackbume’s Mews (Upper Brook Street, Mayfair 7) probably had some connection with the Mr William Blackburne who according to the parish ratebooks came to live in Upper Brook Street in the 1720s, when this area was just being developed.\n\nBlackfriars (City 5) was once the home of the Dominicans, or Black Friars, a begging order of preachers who settled here in 1279 inside the City walls, within easy reach of citizens who would give them sus­ tenance. Blackfriars Lane winds through the middle of their precinct, and the old cloister is now Playhouse Yard. After Henry vrn dissolved the monastery, its church where the preaching friars had attracted large congregations for centuries was replaced by the parish church of St Anne. This was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 and all that remains of it is a plaque recording the site in Church Entrv.\n\nBlackfriars Bridge, the City’s second bridge, was opened in 1769, and leads to Blackfriars Road, thus extending the name of the Dominicans down into Southwark. Blackfriars Underpass, underneath the former monastery precinct, was the first stage of a projected dual­ carriageway to the Tower. For its electrical road-heating and other refinements it was granted the AA Gold Medal in 1967 for distinguished work in the cause of motoring.\n\nBlacklands Terrace (Chelsea 7). A large part of Chelsea was labelled ‘Blacklande’ in a survey of the parish dated 1544. At that time Chelsea was mainly exposed heath\n\nand bleak common, covered in a dark soil.\n\nBlagrove Road (North Kensington 2). Probably after Henry Gamble Blagrove, a nineteenth-century musician, who led the State band at Queen Victoria’s coronation. He is buried at nearby Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nBlechynden Street (North Kensington 2) crosses a 50-acre estate which James Whitchurch, a barrister, purchased for £10 an acre in the nineteenth century. He left his home at Blechynden in Southampton and built himself a house in Lancaster Road, North Kensington (now occupied by the Little Sisters of the Assumption). Streets were begun on the estate in 1846, and the first to be\n\nlaid out were named Aldermaston, Silchester, Bramley and Pamber after four neighbouring villages near Basingstoke, where Whitchurch’s daughter Florence Blechynden Whitchurch was living.\n\nWhitchurch divided his land into building plots which he leased to speculators: among them were John Calverley (Calverley Street), a Notting Hill builder; Joseph Job Martin, who was the landlord of the Lancaster Tavern in Walmer Road as well as the developer of Martin Street; Stephen Hurst, a builder from Kentish Town, who was responsible for Hurstway Street, and James Fowell of Gray’s Inn Road, who moved to more select Ponders End when the profits from Fowell Street started to come in.\n\nBleeding Heart Yard (Greville Street, Holborn) is derived from an old inn sign depicting a broken-hearted Virgin Mother, but until recently the name was always associated with the redoubtable Lady Hatton of Hatton Garden, who, according to the Ingoldsby Legends, entered into leagne with the Devil. Ultimately the Devil came to claim her, dressed as a dancer in black who whisked her away in the middle of a ball at Hatton House. She was never seen again-\n\nBut out in the courtyard-and just in that part\n\nWhere the pump stands-lay bleeding a LARGE HUMAN HEART!\n\nBlithfield Street (Kensington 6). A Staffordshire place-name. Connection with Kensington unknown.\n\nBlomfield. Charles James Blomfield, an energetic churchman who became Bishop of London in 1828, is remembered in several London streets. Blomfield Street in the City (5) is close to St Botolph’s Bishops­ gate, where Blomfield was rector before becoming Bishop. Bloomfield Terrace (Pimlico 7) adjoins St Barnabas Church, which the Bishop consecrated on St Barnabas’s Day\n\n1850. In Paddington, on the estate which has belonged to the See of London for centuries, his name was given to Blomfield Crescent, Road and Villas (3): see Bishop’s Bridge Road, Paddington.\n\nBloomburg Street (Westminster 7). Part of the Chapter of Westminster’s land: see Chapter Street, West­ minster.\n\nBloomfield Terrace (Pimlico 7) : see\n\nBloomfield.\n\nBloomsbury (4) is the name given to the medieval manor which stretched from modern Euston Road to High Holborn, and west to east from Tottenham Court Road to Southampton Row. It is a corruption of Blemund’s bury, the bury or manor house of William de Blemund, who bought the land in 1201. He was the brother of Gervase, an eminent Aoglo-Norman City merchant with a large mansion near Cornhill; hence the family name Blemont, literally ‘Corn hill’. The bury is clearly shown on Agas’ map, an impressive two-storey building protected by a\n\nstrong wall and what looks like a moat, dominating the surrounding countryside.\n\nIn 1545 the Earl of Southampton (Southampton Row) acquired the manor, which his descendants, the Dukes of Bedford, still partly own today. It was the 4th Earl of Southampton who started to develop the fields in 1661 by building Bloomsbury Square, the first open space in London to be designated a Square. Soon afterwards, to give the residents of the Square access to Southampton Row, Bloomsbury Place was built. Meanwhile, Bloomsbury Market had opened, and to serve it an old cart track was widened and named Bury Place (short for Bloomsbury Place). The road made to connect the market with the Square is now Bloomsbury Way. Bloomsbury Street came much later, as part of a Victorian slum clearance scheme.\n\nBlue Anchor Alley (Bunhill Row 5). The old Blue Anchor inn in Bunhill Row changed to its present name, the Artillery Arms, in 1856.\n\nBlue Ball Yard (StJames’s 7). From a Blew Ball tavern recorded here in the 1740s.\n\nBoddy’s Bridge (Upper Ground, Southwark) is situated in the Manor of Paris Garden (q.v.), whose records mention Richard Boddy living beside\n\n‘Bodyes Bridgin Upper Ground from 1630 until 1642. He built a bridge in Upper Ground over the little stream-one of many draining Paris Garden-which ran beside Colombo Street, under the Bridge and down to the Thames by Bull Alley.\n\nBoldero Street (Lisson Grove 3) contains warehouses of the adjoining firm of Spencer, Turner and Boldero, founded in 1840 as Spencer and Hall, Drapers. By 1857 Boldero had joined the business, which soon afterwards became a wholesale trade. In the 1890s it developed into a great department store, but since the decline of Lisson Grove as a fashionable area the firm has dealt only with wholesale drapery. It occupies 61-93 Lisson Grove.\n\nBolney Gate (Brompton 6). The 1965 flats called Bolney Gate occupy the site of Bolney House, a Victorian mansion which stood in Ennismore Gardens. It was built for Alfred Ruth and his cousin-wife Octavia Ruth, whose families were landed gentry from Dolney in Sussex.\n\nBolsover Street (Marylebone 4). Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire was part of the heritage of the Cavendish family. Through marriages of Cavendish heiresses, it passed to the families of Harley and then Portland, the owners of Marylebone Manor. Baron Bolsover is still a title of the Dukes of Portland, but under the 7th Duke the Castle has become National Trust property.\n\nBolt Court (Fleet Street 5) used to face the Bolt-in-Tun, a busy fifteenth­ century coaching inn on the opposite side of Fleet Street (on the site of no. 64). Its inn-sign showed a bolt, or\n\narrow, passing through a tun, which was probably the rebus of a landlord called Bolton. (The same sign can be seen carved in St Bartholomew’s Church at Smithfield in memory of Prior Bolton who restored the church).\n\nThe Boltons (Earl’s Court 6), the Little Boltons, Bolton Gardens and South Bolton Gardens occupy fields that were held by William Bolton as early as 1538. His heirs, all apparently named William, continued to farm the land for centuries, but sold it when the streets were begun: a property deed dated 1864, when The Boltons was under construction, described it as ‘land formerly of William Boulton esquire’.\n\nBolton Road (South Hampstead 3) lies on the Eyre Estate.\n\nBolton Street (Piccadilly 7). The Duke of Bolton owned land near Berkeley Square, according to the minutes of the Westminster Com­ mission for Sewers, which mention in 1696 that sewer pipes were being laid here to serve his property. Three years later this street first appears in the parish ratebooks.\n\nBonchurch Road (North Kensington 2) was apparently built by a native of the Isle of Wight; the first house to be erected here, in 1875, was called Shanklin House, and a turning out of Bonchurch Road is St Lawrence Terrace-Shanklin, Bonchurch and St Lawrence are neighbouring coastal resorts on the Island.\n\nBond Court (Walbrook 5) must have been the home of the prominent Bond family. Sir George Bonde, Alderman of Walbrook Ward 1584-1592 and Master of the Haberdashers’ Company, was an ancestor of Sir Winston Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough and the Dukes of Leeds through one daughter, and Victoria’s favourite Lord Melbourne through another. William Bond, also Master of the Haberdashers’ Company, became Alderman of Walbrook in 1649.\n\nBonny Street (Camden Town 8) was built in 1871, at the same time as Camden Road Station, probably by James Rippoth Bonny, an architect established in Camden Road. The corner house of the new street, next door to Bonny’s office, was a restaurant run by George Pye Bonny. The restaurant and the architect’s premises have since combined and become the Station Hotel, facing Camden Road Station.\n\nBooth’s Place (Wells Street, Maryle­ bone). Joseph Booth was the lessee of this mews in the 1760s, when the name first appears. He lived on the corner, in We11s Street.\n\nBorough High Street (Southwark 5). Southwark, was, and sometimes still is, known as the Borough, because in early times it was the only borough or suburb, outside the City Walls. The Romans founded a settlement here and built the High Street as an approach road to London Bridge.\n\nBoscastle Road (Highgate 8). Boscastle was the name of the first house built here, at the southern end. Probably after the birthplace of the Cornishman who owned the house in the 1860s.\n\nBoscobel Place (Belgravia 7) and Boscobel Street (Marylebone 3) are both named after Royal Oak pubs, Boscobel Woods being the scene of Charles n’s escape from the Round­ heads. Neither of the pubs exist now; the Royal Oak in Belgravia was demolished as part of a redevelopment plan in 1952, and that in Marylebone was replaced by railway sidings in the 1890s.\n\nBoston Place (Marylebone 3) was built in the early 19th century on what used to be Boston Field. The field was probably too waterlogged to be of agricultural value and was used as a rubbish tip. It also contained a large mud pit in which people fell and drowned from time to time.\n\nBoswell Court and Street (Holborn 4) were part of the successful speculative building enterprises carried out in this district by Edward Boswell in about 1710. He was a\n\nbricklayer from St Giles-in-the-Fields and a Churchwarden of that parish.\n\nBosworth Road (Notting Hill 2). The 13th Earl of Oxford, Lord of the Manors of Notting Hill and Kensington (see Earl’s Court) fought with Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field in 1485. However, it is unlikely that the builder of this street in 1867 had this in mind. Origin unknown.\n\nBotolph Lane (City 5). At the bottom of this lane is a plaque recording the site of St Botolph-by­ Billingsgate, burnt down in the Great Fire. It was one of the four City churches dedicated to the seventh-century saint, who also gave his name to Boston in Lincolnshire. Like the other three, all still standing, the chnrch was situated just by a City gate, for Botolph was a patron of travellers. The others are St Botolph Aldersgate, St Botoph Bishopsgate and St Botolph Aldgate (beside St Botolph Row and Street).\n\nBott’s Mews (Chepstow Road, Bays­ water) is behind the Princess Royal tavern in Hereford Road, which was opened by James Bott in the early 1840s. The Princess Royal was a popular country inn, with its own bowling green, fish pond and archery ground.\n\nBoundary Road once the boundary between the parishes of St Marylebone and Hampstead, now separates the London Boroughs of Westminster and Camden.\n\nBourchier Street (Soho 7) was renamed shortly after the death of the Reverend Basil Bourchier (1881-1934), rector of nearby St Anne’s Church. He must have often passed this street on his way to the church from his home in Soho Square.\n\nBourdon Street (Mayfair 7) is named after Bourdon House on the corner with Davies Street, now Mallett’s the antique dealers. The house was built in about 1725 and first occupied by William and Captain John Burden.\n\nBourlet Close (Riding House Street, Marylebone). Here great paintings are prepared for art exhibitions all over the world in the framemaking workshops and packing warehouses belonging to James Bourlet, fine art agents. The adjoining premises in Nassau Street have been their headquarters since 1848. The Bourlet family ran the business from the eighteenth century until 1908.\n\nBourne Street (Chelsea 7) runs beside the River Westbourne. The Westbourne can still be seen from one point in Bourne Street, encased in a large iron pipe that carries it over the tracks of Sloane Square Underground Station. Bourne Terrace (Westbourne Park 3) crosses the same stream higher in its course.\n\nBouverie Place (Paddington 3) and Radnor Place were named soon after young Lady Catherine Pleydell­ Bouverie died in childbirth at Paddington in 1804, worn down, according to contemporary gossip, by the neglect and ill-treatment of her husband, the future 3rd Earl of Radnor, who was ‘very immoral in respect of female connexions’.\n\nBouverie Street (Fleet Street 5) and its offshoot Pleydell Street are said to belong to the family of Pleydell­ Bouverie, Earls of Radnor.\n\nBow Lane and Churchyard (City 5). The famous church of St Mary-le­ Bow was originally called St Mary­ de Arcubus, translated as St Mary ‘of the arches’ or ‘of the bows’. The early Norman arches can still be seen in the crypt, restored since war damage, and the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Court of Arches is held there. The ‘great bell of Bow’ of the nursery rhyme used to ring the City curfew in the middle ages.\n\nBow Street (Covent Garden 4). ‘So called’, as John Strype explained in 1720, ‘as running in Shape of a bent Bow’.\n\nBowling Green Lane (Clerkenwell 5) was a country lane behind Clerkenwell Priory. At an early date there were bowling greens all along its north side, perhaps once patronised by those twelfth-century City clerks described by Fitzstephen who used to stroll to Clerkenwell ‘in summer evenings, when they walk forth to take the air’, after whom the district is named. The last green here closed in 1849.\n\nBoyle Street (Mayfair 7). After the Boyles, Earls of Burlington: see Burlington, Piccadilly.\n\nBoyne Terrace Mews (Kensington 2. Probably after Boyne House, a large early Victorian villa in Holland Park Avenue, where Holland Park Station now stands.\n\nBoyton Place (Penfold Street, Marylebone). Sir James Boyton, who died in 1926, was Unionist MP for East Marylebone from 1910 until 1918, and lived in the borough at 2 Park Square West.\n\nBradley’s Buildings (Pentonville 5) belonged to John and Charles Bradley, who ran an ironmongery business in Chapel Market in the 1840s.\n\nBraidwood Street (Tooley Street 5). This name is a tribute to the heroism of James Braidwood, the chief of the London Fire Brigade. He died in 1861 in a flaming warehouse at nearby Cotton’s Wharf, Tooley Street, which collapsed and crushed him, horribly mutilating the body.\n\nBramerton Street (Chelsea 6) was built on Chelsea Glebe in 1876 and given a Norfolk place-name. Origin unknown.\n\nBranch Hill (Hampstead 1) was so named about 250 years ago probably because it branched out of Hampstead High Street.\n\nBread Street (City 5), so called by the year 1163, was the traditional London bread market. After a royal decree of 1302 it was forbidden to sell bread anywhere else in the City; in this way prices and weights could be controlled for the benefit of the citizens, and dishonest traders could be punished, like one John of Stratford who ‘for making bread less than the assize, was, with a fool’s hood on his head, and loaves of bread about his neck, drawn on a hurdle through the streets of the City’.\n\nBream’s Buildings (Chancery Lane 5). Probably from its eighteenth­century builder.\n\nBrechin Place (South Kensington 6). Probably in honour of Lord Panmure of Brechin, who was responsible for building the Kensington Barracks during his term as Secretary of State for War (1855-1858).\n\nBrecknock Road (Camden Town 8). Part of the ancient trackway from King’s Cross to Highgate. Named after Lord Camden’s country estate.\n\nBremner Road (Knightsbridge 6) was built and named in 1875. Origin unknown.\n\nBressenden Place (Victoria 7). A modem road (1962) named after Bressenden Row, a little terrace of four or five cottages shown roughly on this site on Horwood’s map of 1819. Bressenden Row disappeared shortly afterwards and the original reason for the name has long been forgotten.\n\nBrewer Street (Soho 7) took its namefrom two breweries which stood on its north side when the street was first formed. The first, opened in about 1664. belonged to Thomas Ayres, who also gave his name to nearby Air Street. It continued brewing until 1826; the Lex Garage now occupies the site. Davis’s Brewery, dating from 1671, adjoined it on the west, on either side of modern Lexington Street, and sur­ vived for about 70 years.\n\nBrewhouse Yard (Clerkenwell 5). The first Brewhouse here opened in 1728, and the spot has been connected with brewing ever since. At present, Allied Breweries Ltd have their headquarters here.\n\nBrick Court (Temple, City), first built in the reign of James I, was the earliest set of brick chambers in the Temple in an age of timber.\n\nBrick Street (Piccadilly 7). An old lane, marked on a plan of 1614 as a hedgerow dividing two fields. The field on its north side, now the land between Brick Street and Shepherd Street, was then the Brickhill or Brick Kiln Close. The field lay in the valley of the Tyburn which was rich in brick-earth. Clay Street is higher up the same valley.\n\nBrickbarn Close (Edith Grove, Chel­ sea). There was a field called Brickbarn Close roughly on this site in 1620. In those days a brick house was still a rarity, so a barn of brick was certainly distinctive enough to give name to a field.\n\nBridewell Place (City 5) lies close to the site of the River Fleet, which gave rise to so many wells along its course that it was often known as the River of Wells. (Most of them are forgotten, but the Clerkenwell still exists). The well of St Brigid, or Bride, rose beside St Bride’s Church in Fleet Street. The association between the well and the saint probably dates back to very early times, before Christianity had discarded pagan wellworship. St Bride’s is one of the two places in London where relics of a Saxon church on the site can be seen (the other being Allhallows-by-the-Tower). Bridewell, first a palace given by Edward VI to the City for use as a workhouse, then used as a prison from 1729 until its demolition in 1864.\n\nBridford Mews (Marylebone 4). Named in 1934 after a village in Devonshire; this is a turning out of Devonshire Street.\n\nBridge Approach (Chalk Farm 8). Built to bridge the London and Birmingham Railway, which reached this point in the 1840s.\n\nBridge Place (Pimlico 7). After Eccleston Bridge.\n\nBridge Street (Westminster 7) was made to form an impressive approach to Westminster Bridge, which was finally opened in 1750. The idea of a second bridge over the Thames had been suggested many years earlier, but it was opposed by the City of London, who drew a steady income from toll-paying traffic using London Bridge, and wanted no competition. It was the first bridge on a major scale to be attempted in England since London Bridge in the twelfth century, and was designed by the Swiss engineer Labelye, who used the innovatory method of caissons­ timber boxes filled with stone and sunk to form a foundation. The design was not entirely satisfactory and the original bridge, where Wordsworth was inspired to write Earth hath not anything to show more fair, was removed and replaced in 1853.\n\nBridgefoot (Lambeth 7) is the name given to the Surrey end of Vauxhall Bridge.\n\nBridgeman Street (Marylebone 3). William Lord Bridgeman was not only First Lord of the Admiralty, Home Secretary and Chairman of the BBC, but also represented this area, Marylebone, on the London County Council. The street was named after him by the LCC in 1935, the year he died.\n\nBridgewater Street and Square (City 5) occupy the site of Bridgewater House, the seat of the Earl of Bridgewater. In a tragic fire of 1687 the house was destroyed and the\n\nEarl’s two sons, Viscount Brackley, aged 11, and 8-year-old Thomas, were burned in their beds. When the ruins were built over, Viscount Street and Brackley Street were named in memory of the dead heir.\n\nBridle Lane (Soho 7). An old lane, dating from a much earlier period than the surrounding streets; by Tudor times it was the boundary between Gelding Close (see Golden Square) and Windmill Field (see Great Windmill Street). The name probably refers to Abraham Bridle, a local carpenter, who built houses in Gelding Close backing on to the lane in the 1680s.\n\nBristol Gardens (Paddington 3) is a turning out of Clifton Villas. Clifton was a fashionable district of Bristol.\n\nBritten Street (Chelsea 6) was built in about 1818, at the same time as adjacent St Luke’s Church, and was named after a Mr J. Britten who was an early trustee of the church.\n\nRef: 73.\n\nBritton Street (Clerkenwell Road 5) was first built in 1719 and called Red Lion Street until 1936. In the dank and cobwebbed cellars of the Red Lion Inn (now demolished) from which the street took its name, young John Britton (1771-1857) served a miserable apprenticeship to his uncle, the landlord. His years there ‘dragged on as a lengthened and galling chain: for my health, always weak, was greatly impaired by constant con­ finement in damp, murky cellars’. Only six months before his appren­ ticeship was due to finish, he broke his indentures, and eventually became a famous antiquarian, topographer and architect, the author of the ‘Dictionary of Architecture’ and ‘Beauties of England and Wales’.\n\nBroad Court (Drury Lane 4) was built in about 1746, and was then by far the widest of the side streets giving on to Drury Lane; even so, it was only a yard or two wide at the end where it squeezed between the houses along the Lane. The reason for this was that ribbon development had already spread along Drury Lane, despite Stuart proclamations forbidding suburban expansion, and by the time the fields behind it came to be built up there was no space left between the houses for broad access roads.\n\nBroad Street Avenue (City 5). A turning out of Old Broad Street.\n\nBroad Walk (Regent’s Park 3). The principal, as well as the broadest, path across Regent’s Park, designed by Nash in 1812. It serves to mark part of the boundary between the London Borough of Camden and the City of Westminster.\n\nBroad Yard (Clerkenwell 5). An old yard, which is not, and never has been, particularly broad. The spaciousness and comfort which ‘broad’ implies were always completely lacking: Pinks, the Clerkenwell historian, describes it in 1865 as a nest of squalid human kennels and fever dens, with reeking dust-heaps before the doors-places without light or ventilation’. But it was broad compared to its neighbour, Frying Pan Alley (now demolished), which was only two feet six inches wide at one point, ‘there not being room in it to get a full sized coffin out without turning it on edge’, says Pinks cheerfully.\n\nBroadbent Street (Mayfair 7). Named after a distinguished local resident, Sir William Broadbent (1835-1907), a physician to the royal family granted a baronetcy for his services to medicine, who lived nearby at 84 Brook Street.\n\nBroadwall (Southwark 5) was a long and important causeway in the middle ages. Much of Southwark lay (and still lies) below high tide level, and had to be crossed on the artificial earth walls or banks: Bankside, Upper Ground (sometimes called Narrow Wall) and the Broad Wall.\n\nWith the drainage ditches which chequered the marsh and flowed either side of the Wall, the area must have resembled closely the present­ day Romney Marsh around Rye and Winchelsea.\n\nBroadway (Westminster 7) was a wide space at the junction of Petty France and Tothill Street. Like Broadwick Street, it owed its breadth to its early function as a market-place, in this case a haymarket formed in the time of James 1. The market had expired by 1720.\n\nBroadwick Street (Soho 7). The name was originally Broad Street­ the meaningless wick was added in 1936-and at first was only applied to the really broad section of the street, between Lexington Street and Berwick Street. It was begun in 1686, and its width was quite exceptional for that time. Strype, writing in 1720, explained this breadth: ‘About the Middle of this Street is a Place designed for a Hay Market … but whether it will be finished, Time will make appear’. The market was to have replaced the one in the Haymarket, but it was never completed. Instead a street market grew up round the corner in Berwick Street, where it still survives, while the ‘Place designed for a Hay Market’ is occupied by public conveniences.\n\nBroken Wharf (City 5). In the fourteenth century this wharf was shared by the Abbot of Chertsey and the Abbot of Hanune, who argued about who should repair it. Their quarrel lasted forty years, while the wharf slowly rotted and finally collapsed into the Thames.\n\nBrompton Road was the medieval track to the village of Brompton, probably named from broom growing in the neighbourhood. Brompton Place, a turning­ out of the road, was so named in\n\n1938. Brompton Square dates from the 1820s.\n\nBrook Gate (Park Lane 7) is the approach to Hyde Park facing Upper Brook Street.\n\nBrook Mews North (Bayswater 3) was built in about 1850 exactly above the Westbourne Brook, by then forced into underground sewers, close to the point where it flows into the Serpentine (see end-map). Hence also nearby Brook Street, Bayswater.\n\nBrook Street (Mayfair 7). The brook is the River Tyburn, which flowed across Brook Street. There is still a clearly perceptible dip in the street at that point, and in fact it is quite easy to trace the valley of the Tyburn the length of its course through Mayfair. The brook is now an underground sewer, and is visible only where it forms the Regent’s Park lake.\n\nBrooke Street (Holborn 5). Fulke Greville, courtier and man of letters, was born in 1554 at the family seat Beauchamp’s Court in Warwickshire. He attended Shrewsbury School, where he established a lifelong friendship with the young Philip Sidney, then followed Sidney to Court and immediately became one of Eliza­ beth I’s favourites. In fact, he out­ lasted his rivals in the Queen’s favour and was eventually ennobled as 1st Baron Brooke by her successor, James I. Brooke House at Holborn, his town residence, was the scene of his violent death in 1628 when an old servant stabbed him in a fit of rage at being left out of his master’s wilL Brooke House then passed down the family to Fulke’s kinsman Robert Greville, who married Ann Dodding­ ton and died in 1676. The house was then demolished: Brooke Street was soon formed across its site, while the gardens behind became Doddington (now Dorrington), Beauchamp and Greville Streets.Brooke’s Court stood just outside the garden wall.\n\nBrookfield Park (Highgate 8) was formerly a meadow crossed by the upper reaches of the Fleet brook, which issues from the Highgate ponds and now flows in an underground sewer beside this street (see end-map).\n\nBroomsleigh Street (Hampstead 1) is typical of a class of street name that came to maturity in Victorian Hampstead and was the ancestor of all suburban Acacia Avenues, Linden Groves and Meads Roads. The street was built by the Land Building Investment & Cottage Improvement Company Ltd, one of the land companies whose proliferation in the 1850s and 60s revolutionised the pattern of street building and naming: see Burlington Mews. This was the period which saw the beginning of Hampstead’s urbanisation, when landowning families who had farmed their fields for generations, and had no knowledge of how to develop them, sold out to the land companies -a continuing trend which has left most modern suburban building land in the hands of giant contracting firms or local councils.\n\nThe new owners had no interest in preserving old associations on these estates. In some cases they would name a batch of streets after the directors of the company and their country homes, but this source was soon exhausted, especially when (as often happened) the company consisted of a solitary businessman. Their only aim in naming streets was to give an impression of genteel, vaguely rural, desirable residences.\n\nHence the number of countrified suffixes and prefixes found in Hampstead streets. ‘Croft’ is the most popular: Femcroft, Hollycroft, Rose­ croft, Greencroft and Lyncroft. Endings like ‘wood’, ‘grove’, ‘bourne’, ‘hurst’, ‘leigh’ ‘ridge’ and ‘dale’ are fruitful basic elements: Inglewood, Netherwood, Maygrove, Honeybourne, Goldhurst, Cotleigh, Broomsleigh, Loveridge, Briardale, Holmdale. ‘Glens’ in this area Glenbrook, Glenloch, Glenilla, Glen­ more) are no guarantee of rocky vales.\n\nFlower names come into the same class. Narcissus Road dates from 1877, and being also the name of a Greek mythological character led to the appearance of a subsidiary Pandora Road four years later.\n\nWhen the companies wished to announce attractions more subtly, they relied on ruralistic associations like Ravenshaw Street and Rosemont Road), or names of pleasant villages and towns, usually in the West Country: this accounts for Glastonbury Street, Kemplay Road and Crediton Hill. Insipid but harmless names of this kind continue to spread with public acquiescence wherever English suburban development takes place.\n\nBrown Hart Gardens (Mayfair 7) was originally two separate streets, Brown Street (after John Brown, a local bricklayer, who leased the site from the Grosvenor family of Grosvenor Square) and Hart Street, probably from an early tavern-sign. They were first built in 1738 and united under the present name in 1936.\n\nRefs: 227, 329.\n\nBrown Street (Marylebone 3) dates from about 1815. This uninspired name was that of the speculating builder who leased this land from the Portman family of Portman Square.\n\nA few yards from Browning Mews (New Cavendish Street, Marylebone) lived Elizabeth Barrett, confined to her room at 50 Wimpole Street by her frail health and her overbearing father. Her poetry writing brought her to the attention of Robert Browning, the poet, who managed to overcome the obstacles which kept Elizabeth an isolated recluse. They fell in love, and to escape from Elizabeth’s father (who never forgave her) they eloped one morning in 1846 and were married secretly at St Marylebone Church.\n\nBrowning Oose(RandolphAvenue, Paddington), flanked by Robert Close and Elizabeth Close, continues the story: the couple’s cloudless but brief married life was spent in Italy, where Elizabeth, already delicate, declined and died in 1861. Browning then came to Paddington, and lived for 26 years at Warwick Crescent, beside the Grand Union Canal. It is said to be he who first called this area Little Venice, because of the happy Italian memories it revived.\n\nBrownlow Street (High Holborn 4). The Brownlow family, ancestors of the Doughtys, owned property be­ hind High Holborn by the 16th century: see Doughty Street.\n\nBrunswick was a popular name with builders in the year 1795, when Princess Caroline of Brunswick came to England to marry her cousin the Prince of Wales, later George IV. But the marriage was probably the least successful in the history of British royalty. Prince George is said to have been horrified at the sight of his bride and Caroline reported that he spent the wedding night in a drunken stupor. He stayed with her only until their daughter, Princess Charlotte, was born. Caroline, spurned and humiliated, led a wild vagabond life on the continent which shocked all Europe until her death in 1821.\n\nBrunswick Square (Bloomsbury 4) was built in 1795 on part of the grounds of Captain Coram’s Foundling Hospital: see Coram Street.\n\nBrunswick Mews (Marylebone 3), runs behind the Brunswick Chapel in Upper Berkeley Street, opened in 1795. The chapel closed in 1963, but the building still stands.\n\nBrunswick Gardens (Kensington 6), is a mid-Victorian name of unknown origin.\n\nBrushfield Street (Bishopsgate 5) was named in 1870 after Thomas Brushfield of nearby Fournier Street either because he built it – he had been involved in forming the Commercial Road a few years previously – or as a compliment, since Mr Brushfield was the local representative of the Metropolitan Board of Works (forerunner of the Greater London Council)from 1865 until 1875.\n\nBruton Lane, Place and Street (Berk­ eley Square 7). From the Berkeley family’s Somerset estate: see Berkeley Square, Mayfair.\n\nBryanston Square, Street and Place (Marylebone 3). From the Portman family’s seat in Dorset: see Portman Square, Marylebone.\n\nBrydges Place (Chandos Place 4). After Giles Brydges, Lord Chandos: see Chandos Place, Strand.\n\nBuckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace is the only official royal residence in the world named after a nobleman. John Sheffield, Dnke of Buckingham (no relation to the Villiers Buckinghams whose title had become extinct) was a philanderer at the dissolute court of Charles 11 and even wooed plain, stolid Princess Anne. Anne seems to have kept a soft spot for him, and many years later, when he was an ambitious and successful politician and she had just become Queen of England, she granted him the Dukedom and also some land out of Green Park as a site for Buckingham House.\n\nBuckingham House became Crown property in 1762, when George III bought it from Buckingham’s heir to give to his consort Charlotte. George III’s sons George IV and William IV wanted to convert the house into a palace, but spent so long perfecting it that both died before it was finished, and it was left to Queen Victoria to become the first royal resident of Buckingham Palace.\n\nBuckingham Palace Road (7) leads to the Palace but predates it by several centuries; it was the ancient road to Chelsea, not given its present name until the time of Victoria. Buckingham Gate (7) was originally simply the name of the gate into St James’s Park beside Buckingham House; it is now also applied to the approach road to the gate. Nearby are Buckingham Place, Palace Street and Palace Place.\n\nBuckingham Street (Strand 4). The name is a relic of the home of the notorious Dukes of Buckingham. George Villiers, the 1st Duke, was the first of the line of Villiers who wielded great power as favourites of the Stuarts. As a youth, he was of such angelic beauty that James I singled him out to be his Cup bea1er, and loaded him with honours and favours. In 1622 he gave him York House in the Strand, once the palace of the Archbishop of York. Villiers intended to rebuild the old house, but only the watergate (still standing in Watergate Walk) had been com­ pleted when he was assassinated at Portsmouth in 1628 by John Felton, a half-mad subaltern.\n\nThe 2nd Duke, another George, was a lesser edition of his father-a charming, faithless, flighty courtier. He was also a spendthrift, according to Dryden’s Absolom and Achitophel:\n\nIn squandering wealth was his peculiar art,\n\nNothing went unrewarded but desert.\n\nBeggar’d by fools, whom still he found too late,\n\nHe had his jest, and they had his estate.\n\nHe finally sold York House, decrepit and heavily mortgaged, to help pay his debts. Streets were laid out on its site in 1674 and were all named after him: George Court, Villiers Street, Duke Street (now part of John Adam Street), Of Alley (now York Place) and Buckingham Street.\n\nBucklersbury (City 5). The rich Bukerel family, who originated in Italy, are recorded in London by the year 1104. Many of them were Sheriffs or Mayors of London, and by about 1240 they lived in a fortified mansion, or bury, here on the bank of the Walbrook. It was ‘a great stone building, yet in part remaining on the south side of the street’ when Stow wrote in 1598, but ‘hath of long time been divided and letten out into many tenements’.\n\nBucknall Street (St Giles 4). So named in 1877 after Ralph Bucknall, a local brewer and eminent parishion er. Elected a Vestryman of St Giles in 1675, he took an active part in parish affairs until his death in 1710.\n\nBudge Row (City 5) is found as Bogerow in a document dated 1342, and was the quarter where boge, or lambs-skin fur, was sold. This part of the City was the centre of the London fur and skin trade; an Ordinance dated 1345 required all free men of the trade of furriers to dwell in Walbrook, Cornhill or Budge Row. Skinners’ Hall is still close by in Dowgate Hill.\n\nBulinga Street (Westminster 7). ‘Bulinga Fenn’ was a marsh mentioned in King Edgar’s Charter (AD 951). It stretched westwards roughly from the site of this street towards Chelsea, covering the future Pimlico district.\n\nBull Alley (Southwark 5) is probably derived from an inn of this name. The sign of the Bull often indicated a tavern where bull baitings were held; the bull, with its horns protected, was fastened to a stake in the inn-yard and set upon by bulldogs. The sport was already popular in Southwark by 1546, when Henry VIII ineffectually proclaimed the abolition of the Bankside brothels and bull rings.\n\nBull Inn Court (Strand). The Black Bull Inn in the Strand is first mentioned in a deed dated 1536, when it was described as a ‘new tenement and cottage’. It was demolished in 1686, whereupon this court was formed.\n\nBull’s Head Passage (Gracechurch Street, City) derived its name from the Bull’s Head Tavern in Gracechurch Street, found mentioned in the Daily Post in 1724.\n\nBulmer Mews (Nolting Hill 2) was described in 1824 as ground adjoining a field belonging to James Weller Ladbroke and in the possession of widow Sarah Bulmer.\n\nRef: 227.\n\nBulstrode Place and Street (Mary­ lebone 3). Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire was one of the many properties of the I st Duke of Portland, and the principal family seat nntil 1810. The 2nd Duke married Edward Harley’s heiress, and thereby acquired the land on which this street stands.\n\nBunhill Row (Finsbury 5). Legend has it that the Bone Hill, later corrupted to Bunhill and Bonhill, came into being when 1,000 cartloads of bones were brought here in 1549 from St Paul’s Cathedral (which owned Finsbury Manor) to ease congesti"
