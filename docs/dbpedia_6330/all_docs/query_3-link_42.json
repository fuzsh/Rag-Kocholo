Business:—Letter written to Gamboa to send 2 (sic) horsemen hacquebutiers to Lord Wharton when required, for an exploit in Scotland. Letter to wardens of the East and Middle Marches likewise to send 500 or 600 horsemen. Letter to my lord Chancellor to provide pay for those appointed to keep the North Seas since the beginning of summer. Warrant to Williams to pay Sir Edw. Boughton 42l. 2s. 6d. disbursed for rice faggot, etc. Agreement (detailed) made between Wm. Meyre, of Straylesounde, \"a Savoysyon born,\" and Wm. Overende, of Lynne, touching a ship taken by the latter, as laden with Scotchmen's goods and manned by Scots. *** Next entry is 28 Oct. 26 Oct. 658. Thomas Husey to the Earl of Surrey. R. O. \"This present Thursday\" (fn. n1) my lord's Grace (fn. n2) told me of your request for the access of your wife and children to Bowlene, and what answer the King made him therein, as Fowlmerston will declare. Schelton would have you write for him, for he thinks that my lady of Ritchmonde \"will stay him upon his account.\" My lord asked how far forth I was with Rwkwode touching Rowchford. \"What way,\" he asked, \"taketh my son for payment of his debts?\" I answered \" 'I know not.' 'Well,' quod he, 'he oweth Fulmertson an honest sum, and what oweth he you?' I answered 'So much as I can be content to forbear in respect of his necessity.' \" And so I gather that my lord will make some stop in your bargain for Ruschforde for payment of your debts. Handle Fulmerston discreetly and send your resolute answer. The money must come wholly to your hands, for you cannot both pay your whole debts and furnish your present necessities. P.S. in his own hand: Albeit \"the provision of those things committed to Senthelles charge\" will not be obtained at my lord's hand we shall make shift for them upon my credit in this town. My lord is determined that your revenues at Lady Day last shall be received by the steward, and the overplus paid to your ministers. Your lordship remains \"in as goud faime on thes sied the seesse as yowre lowkye sowksedinges have prosperid happelye on that sied.\" Londone, 26 Oct. Handle the matter wisely for the sale of your lands, for my lord said he would see your debts paid. \"And by thesse meanes and othere ye may be maid werye and you wille of Bowleine. As my trwste ys in yowe, bowrne thys lettere.\" Pp. 2. Add.: lieutenant of Boulogne.

Cannot sufficiently accuse the gout, not because of the intolerable pain which it gives him day and night, but because it detains him from tendering his thanks to the King for loving and honorable treatment \"in hoc jucundissime jam peracto progressu.\" Begs Paget to make his excuses. London, 26 Oct. 1545. No letters from the Emperor as yet, but they cannot be long in coming. Signed: Fran. Dilfus. Lat. Hol., p. 1. Add. Sealed. Endd. 26 Oct. 660. Otwell Johnson to John Johnson. R. O. London 26 Oct. 1545:—Your wife and family were well on Friday last, as I learnt from Mr. Gainsford, your gossip. We trust that you are safely arrived at Calleis. The day of your departing I learnt that my friend Thomas Appenrithe died on the Friday or Saturday before, \"wherefore I suppose that you have before this felt a piece of his father's mind towards me concerning mine Exchequer matter.\" I would gladly hear it, having his pack of cloth ready to send him. Your matter at Westminster remains as you left it, for Mr. Parson and \"Walke a knave\" make courtesy to reply. Mr. Crooke has promised to call tomorrow for your costs if they do not presently follow the matter. My cousin Bretain, your brother, is this day come to the Term and will help. Your shipping ends tomorrow, and your four pottels of wool are shipped. All your new wool here is used as you appointed. I could despatch much of it by Christmas for ready money if I might let the \"lokke\" go for 15s. 8d. the todd and the \"leiche\" for a mark. 16 mark the sack is above 16s. 5d., and too much by every man's judgment. \"Your purchaise I can do nothing therein as yett, for lakke of the woodeyers certyfication. Ther is yett no newe admitted.\" Harrison's 20l. is called for by Mr. Laxton, and to pay it to-morrow I must borrow of Mr. Tanfeld's bag until money comes in for wool or wine. Pray learn of Chr. Foele whether Henry Garbrand is come from the vintage. Herein is a letter of Mary Warner's to her brother Bartholomew, of whom pray require speedy answer to my letter concerning Ant. Bruskett's money; and show him \"that James Walche is come home lusty and merry out of Scotland (the Lord be praised) and is going forth shortly to sea, captain in my lord his master's ship. God speed him well!\" Commendations to all friends, including Wm. Home and Thos. Flecton. Hol., pp. 2. Add.: at Calleis. Endd.: aunsweryd le 8 in November at Calleis, etc. 26 Oct. 661. John Gery to John Johnson. R. O. London, 26 Oct. 1545:—Commend me to my uncle Johnson and my aunt, showing him that Robert Mandfelde had both the kilderkin of verjuice and the runlet of vinegar for him, although he writes to my brother Otwell that he only received the verjuice. Let him speak to Mandfelde for the vinegar, for both my servant and John Hollande, Mr. Appenrythe's servant, saw it on board with \"a card nailed upon it directed unto him.\" Private business matters with Mr. Bate and Mr. Benytt. Hol., p. 1. Add.: brother. 26 Oct. 662. John and Edward Maxwell to Wharton. R. O. Are informed that he is discontent with them for going against the house of Carlaverok, contrary to their chief. Went because the whole country was commanded thereto by the Governor, and refusal would have involved imprisonment for treason and loss of goods. Could not help to the house of Carlaverok, as the country was and is lying about it. \"Bot we have insafer as we mycht for glamer of ye cuntre causit . art of pulder and altailze haid to ye Treiff, quhilk hes beyne persewit [b]e ye haile cuntrecht of Gollovay, and trowis verrelie wt ye grace of God his hous salbe un voyn till his hame cummyn.

Hol., p. 1. Add. Endd.: 1545. 26 Oct. 663. Thirlby to Paget. R. O. Received the letters herewith from the King's Commissaries by Monsr. Vanderet; and, as the matter is weighty, and he has no experience, instructions or commission therein, he despatches the letters with all diligence to Cales, to go thence by the ordinary post. Gaunte, 26 Oct. Hol., p. 1. Add. Endd.: 1545. Beneath the address Paget has written: \"To be returned to the Court.\" 26 Oct. 664. Charles V. to Henry VIII. Spanish\n\nCalendar,\n\nviii., No. 160. D'Eick delivered the King's letter and now returns to convey, jointly with the resident ambassador, a verbal message from the Emperor. Ghent, 26 Oct. 1545. 26 Oct. 665. Charles V. to Gardiner. Ib.

Has seen his letter answering that of Granvelle from Brussels. Scepperus is returning with instructions for both, touching his latest mission by the King. Ghent, 26 Oct. 1545. 26 Oct. 667. Charles V. Add. MS.\n\n28,173, f. 329.\n\nB. M. Instructions for Corneille Schepperus and Fras. Van der Dylft on the return of Scepperus to the King of England. After cordial salutations, they shall tell the King that by Scepperus the Emperor is informed of what passed between the King and them touching the interview, the truce or peace between the King and the king of France, and the specification of certain points in the treaty of closer amity, which should be cleared up before the interview, for reasons mentioned in their instruction of 27 Sept. last, and that, learning both by the King's ambassador and by Scepperus, the King's desire to know the Emperor's resolution upon the interview as soon as possible, the Emperor has sent Scepperus back again to declare as follows:—Learning by Scepperus the King's desire to cross the sea for an interview if the Emperor would for that purpose approach the frontiers of Flanders and Arthois, the Emperor despatched an express to the King of the Romans and some of his trusted ministers to learn whether his coming to the Imperial Diet, fixed for the 10th Jan., might be deferred; but was answered that, to give the States no excuse for delaying to attend the Diet, and to check the mischief that might arise from the death of the Abp. of Mayence, first elector of the Empire, and the war between Duke Henry of Brunswyck and his adversaries, and to make timely preparation against the Turk (with whom truce or peace was uncertain as there was no news from the ambassadors sent to him), and other reasons, it was more than necessary that the Emperor should not fail to be at the Diet on the day prefixed. Now the King's passage cannot be before the truce, which is deferred by the difficulty which his ambassador has raised, his power being only to treat the peace and the truce jointly; and as the weather is now uncertain, the winter near, the days short and the sea unsafe, and the Emperor is advertised that the King has despatched hither the bp. of Winchester, \"ung des plus secretz de son Conseil,\" a personage well able to do what should be done in the interview, and the war between the princes might involve the ruin of all Germany, and the Turk is likely to seize the occasion for war on Hungary, the Emperor thinks that the King would rather counsel him to hasten into Germany. Otherwise it would be a great pleasure to the Emperor to meet the King. As to the secret points and articles of the treaty of closer amity which should be cleared up, since the King sends the said Bishop by whom he caused them to be declared to you (presupposing that the Bp. will be furnished with sufficient power), we will, before leaving these countries, give him our final answer. In case the Bp. has not the said power you will solicit the King to send it. Scepperus shall then return to the Queen of Hungary, and Vander Delft shall continue his charge and advertise as often as possible all news. Ghent, 26 Oct. 1545. French. Modem copy from Brussels, pp. 10. *** A fuller abstract of the above is in Spanish Calendar, VIII., No. 159. Add. MS.\n\n28,594 f. 179.\n\nB. M. 2. Another modern copy. Pp. 5. 26 Oct. 668. Gardiner to Paget. R. O. I have seen these letters to my lord of Westminster from the Commissaries with the Almains, and would the Admiral had been come, that I might tell my message to the Emperor in that matter; \"but here I tarry abiding answer from you.\" Newporte, 26 Oct. Skepperus will be here today in his return to the King. Hol., p. 1. Add. Endd.: 1545. Beneath the address Paget has written: \"To be returned to the Court.\" 27 Oct. 669. Scepperus to Charles V. Spanish\n\nCalendar,\n\nviii., No. 164. Pointed out to Winchester the importance of speedily concluding a truce; but he asserted that he had no authority to discuss any such truce unless the Emperor consents to the interview; his coming was to negociate peace and he expected to find the Admiral of France here or he would not have hurried so. Finds, too, that Winchester has no power to treat on the secret points which the writer submitted to the Emperor. Will therefore request the King to grant such powers. Nieuport, 27 Oct. 1545. 27 Oct. 670. Scepperus to Granvelle. Spanish\n\nCalendar,\n\nviii.. No 163. Expected to find Winchester at Bruges; but, since Saturday, he has remained in Nieuport because of the delayed arrival of the Admiral of France. Explained that the delay was through lack of a decision in the matter of the truce; and writes his reply to the Emperor. His King will not retain the Germans in his service at Calais and elsewhere. He is dissatisfied with them, and will complain to the Emperor of those under Frederick von Reissenberg. Nieuport, Tuesday, 27 Oct. 1545. 27 Oct. 671. Vaughan to Paget. R. O. This morning, bearer brought a letter from Mr. Chamberleyn, showing that, to enforce their demand for four months' pay the Almains have the King's Commissaries in ward. \"Happy is he that hath no need of Almaynes; for of all the nations under the heavens they be the worst, most rudest and unreasonablest to deal withal.\" Is now sending Mr. Dymock to the other commissaries with money; and will get as much more, by exchange or otherwise, and send it with diligence. Sent the Commissaries a copy of Paget's late letter. Andwerp, 27 Oct. Surely the Almains will keep the Commissaries until paid the fourth month. Hol, p. 1. Add. Sealed. Endd.: 1545. 27 Oct. 672. Bucler and Mont to Henry VIII. R. O.\n\nSt. P., x. 642. Wrote on the 21st inst. Letters from the scribe of the Lantgrave's \"cancellarie\" in Cassells came yesterday to the magistrates here, signifying that the Lantgrave, Duke Maurice and the Duke of Lunemburgh, with the Duke of Saxon's men, marched on Wednesday (fn. n3) night last, about 12 o'clock, by moonlight to attack the Duke of Brunswick's camp; who was ready for them and compelled them to \"recule.\" But the Lantgrave, animating his men, continued the fight till a great part of Brunswick's host cried \"misericordia;\" to which the Lantgrave, at the persuasion of the others, consented on condition that Brunswick and his eldest son would yield themselves, which they did. Today a messenger, passing through this town, says that the counts of Oldenburgh and Ritburgh are taken, and that he saw Brunswick and his eldest son brought prisoners into Cassels. The magistrates here look hourly for their own messengers. Have written to the Lantgrave's secretary to have news from him, but hitherto have had none. Franckforde, 27 Oct. Signed. Pp. 2. Add. Endd.: 1545. 27 Oct. 673. Bucler and Mont to Paget. R. O. Have written to the King, on the 21st, and now again, all news. Beg him to remember their post, for his return. \"If we had had anything to say we would have been with the Lantgrave at this present business.\" Franckforde, 27 Oct. Signed. P. 1. Add. Endd. 28 Oct. 674. The Privy Council. Dasent's\n\nA.P.C., 264. Meeting at Windsor 28 (misprinted \"xviijth\") Oct. Present: Norfolk, Hertford, Cheyney, Wingfield, Sadler, Paget, Petre, Riche. Business:— Order taken for Philip Chewte and John Istedde, bailiff of Hastinges, with two others of Hastinges, owners of a ship whereof Wm. Woller was captain, to restore to Ant. Macuelo goods taken out of a Spanish ship by Woller, and to apprehend Woller. 28 Oct. 675. Paget to Sleidan. R. O. The King has received as well your first letters touching the departure of your companions from the court of France, as these which have just been delivered to me, reporting that your said colleagues will be tonight at Ardres, and that the French Commissaries will follow. For answer, the King wishes me to advertise you that he will also send his; and I am preparing to go, for that purpose, and with me the bp. of Durham \"(quem Galli vocant episcopum Dulmensem, nomine Cuthbertum Tonstallum),\" and we will soon be at the sea side ready to cross when we hear from you that those of France are arrived at Ardre, or at least are on the way thither. There is no man to whom the sea passage is more hurtful than to me, and therefore I would not begin to cross until sure of the above; and, but for my love to the public weal, I would not cross the sea in winter to gain 50,000 cr. Within two days I set out. Recommendations to the Marshal. French. Draft in Paget's hand, p. 1. Endd.; Mr. Secr. Mr. Paget to Sleidanus, xxviijo Octobr. 1545. 28 Oct. 676. Wharton to Henry. VIII. R. O.\n\nSt. P., v. 552. Since his letters of the 25th, a great watch has been kept round the King's castle of Carlaverok by lairds Johnston, Dumlanerike, Lokenver and the countrymen of Nydisdaill, Galoway and Anerdaill, except the Bells and Batisons whom Wharton has in bond to serve the King. Finds great want of horsemen. On the 26th, having devised for 200, 160 or 180 horsemen to enter the said castle by night, drew secretly to Eske with 200 wallets and victuals for nine days and money for wages, but, of those appointed to meet him, found only 80 good horses; and yet the countrymen of Bewcastledaill, Esk, Leven, Lanercoost, part of the Quenys Hamys and all of the King's lands, the baronies of Burghe and Gillesland, the lord Dacre's lands, and the Bp.'s and \"Colligies\" of Carlisle were all there. Thomas Carlton and the others in Carlaverok actively defend it. Learns, this Wednesday morning, that the Maxwells begin to repent what they have done; and that no more power is come to the said house. Upon news of the Governor's coming, sent espials to learn where he is, who have not returned. Glencarne is master of Dumbretan castle. Lynoux is landed in the Isle of Boytt. On Thursday, 22 Oct., the Governor and Anguishe met at Langrik and agreed for the murder of Parson Lebberton, Anguishe's cousin. But the truth of proceedings in Scotland is uncertain. Has appointed, this St. Simon's Day, every ruler of men within 14 miles of Carlisle to bring before him all their horsemen who have horses worth above 4 mks.; and expects to relieve Carlaverok castle if the enemies keep no better watch than on the 26th. If he can get 200 light horsemen into the castle they will, within two days, be able to victual themselves, with Wharton's aid, by land and water, if the power of Scotland come not. If that power come they will \"as much esteem\" the winning of Loughmaben as Carlaverok, which will be a busy piece of work if Lord Maxwell prove true. Hears from John Maxwell of Cowhyll, in Loughemaben, that he has victuals for 60 men until Christmas, and that he has offered to deliver the castle to the Governor on condition that he is made captain of it. Carlisle, 28 Oct. Signed. Pp. 3. Add. Endd.: 1545. Despatched at Carlisle, 28 Oct., at 9 a.m. 28 Oct. 677. Vaughan to Paget. R. O. As he wrote yesterday, by Christmas, the King's Commissaries are kept in ward by the \"gent darmes,\" having not so few as a hundred waiting at their chamber doors. Sent them on Saturday last, 24th inst., by Mr. Avery, 30,000l. Fl.; and now makes haste to send the rest, 33,000l. Fl., by Mr. Dymok to Bynx in Henault, but lacks thereof 5,000l. Fl. which he cannot yet get. Today Jasper Dowche \"made a trayne to talk with me,\" and told his grief to learn by his friend Nicholucho, who is returned from England, that the King and you \"should not take well his service.\" I must entreat you to show friendly countenance to Barth. Compaigne, that he may signify to Jaspar Dowch that I have commended him. \"Undoubtedly here is nothing to be done without him.\" Perceiving him sorrowful, and knowing not where to get 5000l. or 6000l. wherewith to pay the Almayns, I merrily asked him whether, if I needed so much for a month or two, he could get it within a day or twain.

This morning, after Mr. Cristmas departed to you with our letters, came the \"guidons\" of the footmen saying, in the name of the commonalty, that, unless very shortly provided with money, they would put us, the Coronel and all the head officers in irons. D.escribe how they were pacified with a promise of 5,000 cr. or 6,000 cr. and some victuals until money should come. Sent for the Coronel, to whom on the 19th they delivered 11,500 cr., which if distributed would have left the footmen in the King's debt, and told him that he should rather have paid it and all that he had of his own than occasioned this broil and the imprisonment of the King's commissaries, they being watched day and night by half-a-dozen armed men as if they were murderers; and Chamberlain required certain of the captains to see the accounts between the Coronel and him from the day they first met at Colloine until 19 Oct., when the half of this second month was not ended, and reminded them of their promise to serve 8 or 10 days if the money should not be ready; but they would not listen. The Commissaries of the Emperor and bp. of Liege saw the reckoning, and said that they heard that this was a practice of the Coronel to break up and go succour his master the Landsgrave, who has been worsted by the Duke of Bromswicke. Learn secretly that his temporising and marching about ever since the muster was in order that he might not be far off if the Lands-grave needed him; and the writers have suspected as much ever since they wrote, by Francis, that a gentleman brought them \"credit\" from the Lands- grave, three days after they left the muster place, \"requiring us to return and aid him.\" This protracting of time, as written by Francis and Nicholas, the posts, the writers often \"laid unto him,\" and he scornfully replied that such an army was not to be led in the air, and that he would deserve the King's thanks; and he rejoiced that the King turned them from the devastated country of Bollonois to a fertile country where they would all be made rich and by their acts merit to be chronicled. Send intelligences which the French king's man who lay at Confluence to disturb this army, wrote to his master, showing that what has now come to pass was intended. He learned it from the captains and soldiers, following the march to Liege and then going to France. Have this from a messenger sent by Mons. de Longevale to the bp. of Liege, who was servant to the said man \"that lay at Confluence to practise with the Conte Pallatyne and other Protestants for to disturb this army.\" Other writings were found about the messenger, which they have set him to copy and will send by next post. This night, after supper, Riffenberghe sent his clerk to declare that the captains would have the fourth month according to Eidell Wolfe's and Buckeholt's bargains. Answered that neither the one nor the other compact bound the King to more than three months, who would pay as much as by their compact was due, but was not a prince to yield more because of their evil using of the writers, his commissaries, and had sent the Emperor a copy of his bargain. And, having knowledge of Mr. Averie's departing from Andwarpe with the money, the writers asked whether Riffenberghe according to his bargain, and his people according to their oath, would give the musters truly before receipt of the money, and grant the writers safeconduct to take them. To this obtained no answer. Find that Edell Wolfe and Buckeholte reckon to have the fourth month. The captains report that they have done service enough by their assembly, which caused the French king to retire from Bolloine. Finally, this morning, we have word that, when paid the second and third month, unless the King give the fourth month they will carry us with them as prisoners. And, because we think the Emperor will not be pleased with their long demore here and the damage they have done, we send the copy of the account kept with the Coronel to my lord of Westminster, to declare to his Majesty the dealings of Riffenbergh. Florines, 27 Oct. 1545. P.S.—When about to despatch the above, learnt Mr. Averie's arrival at Binckes, 6 leagues hence (and they send 200 more horse of Eydell Wulfe and Buckeholte to conduct him). Sent word to the Coronel requiring that, as the money was now come, they might be released and suffered to take the musters. After some delay, certain captains brought his answer that they should have liberty to take the musters and then return to prison \"till horsemen and footmen were clearly despatched of as much as they could ask,\" and as for the musters all who were sick or absent should be paid for. Upon receipt of Mr. Secretary's letter, from Mr. Vaughan, signifying again, as though we had been in the enemy's lands, to use them no more than the three months, we sent for the Coronel; who refused to come, but sent an account (copy herewith). It shows his unreasonable demands (detailed, one of them being that the horsemen should have four months' wages). We sent him word again that we would be loth to write thereof to the King, and that we had received further advertisements which we would declare to him. He sent answer that \"the horsemen should teach us what belonged thereto and to all the rest, and that we lay too much at our eases, that we should lie abroad in the camp and take part of the wet weather as the footmen do. And thus he useth us with as much spite as he can.\" He is reported to have said that he knows that he has lost the King's favour and will do his worst, and none of his captains will hear of his pact with the King; but, after paying the footmen, rather than we will consent to the fourth month, they shall carry us in irons and do with us what they list. Whether all that we write of his dealings is true we wot not; nor do we heed his sayings if he will keep his bargain. We have written to Mr. Vaughan to send us 30,000l. Fl. more and 10,000 cr. or 12,000 cr. besides, \"as was ordained afore\" to Binckes; and meanwhile we will \"rid\" the footmen. After despatching them, we shall see how the horsemen frame.

For the 3rd month, for their return homewards, we require them to send three or four gentlemen to Antwerp, with \"another of our colleagues,\" where it shall be paid; and we, Sir Ralph Fane and Thomas Chamberleyn, promise to remain with them meanwhile. That done, we require them to conduct us to some place at hand where we may be safe.

Thanks for letters of occurrents in the North sent by the writer's servant Flesher. Cannot believe it true that garrisons of Scottishmen are placed along the borders of Scotland, or the 90 men from Warke, who seem to have raised fire about Hume, could not have returned with the spoil so quietly. Marvels too where such garrisons can have lodging and coverture, victuals and horsemeat, \"since all is so razed, spoiled and burnt.\" Wonders what John Carr should mean (having 100 horsemen of his retinue and 60 hacquebutiers, horsemen, with Crowche lying there) to send but 80 of his men and 10 gunners instead of the whole number (as was appointed for such enterprises), and also when he writes of 150 Scottishmen in garrison at Kelsoo, why he suffers them to lie there in quiet. The Warden of the East Marches ought to consider this. As to the road with 800 men, of which Carre writes, lord Evre should be written to to that effect, so that they may destroy the country if the Scots have eftsoons \"manured\" it. Even if there were such garrisons of Scottish men, Carre might, with the adjoining garrisons of Norham, Ettell, Fourde and Woller, distruss them one after another; of which the Warden should also be reminded. Lord Baldewyn is lately dead, whose wife, now widow, \"hath been of long obstracted of her wits\" and is mother to Hertford's kinsman, Sir William Wroughton.

On 29 Oct., at 8 p.m., has received letters from the Council dated Windsor, the 26th, signifying that, with 200 hagbutters on horseback from Gamba, 500 or 600 horsemen from the Wardens of the East and Middle Marches, to whom he should write, and the power of the West Wardenry, it was thought that he could victual Carlaveroke, and that he should appoint small boats with victual to meet his army there; also that he should put 50 more horsemen at Langhollm besides the 50 already there. Explains that the way to Carlaveroke is 28 miles and, where it crosses Loker moss, it may easily be cut, that it passes within a mile of Dumfries, that in the present \"contagiouse\" weather no waters can be crossed for a day or two, that there are boats enough for 300 men but they cannot land within a mile of Carlaveroke, and their owners \"doubteth much to come on the sea at this time of the year,\" that the power of the West Marches is only 1,500, and of these but 200 are able horsemen (he wrote on the 28th of the want of horses), that the expedition must encamp three nights in Scotland and that it is thought by expert men not feasible at this season. Has however written to the said Wardens for 600 horsemen and to Gamba for 200 Spaniards, to be at Carlisle on Thursday, 5 Nov., and appointed the able men of the West Wardenry to be there; before which time he cannot arrange for defence of the country and other matters. Wishes Loughmaben castle were manned by such as might be trusted, and a strong garrison of horsemen laid there, and would himself rather venture to put certain light horsemen into Carlaveroke by night than pass there with double the aforesaid power. These two houses and Langhollm would keep those parts in subjection, and keep the Governor occupied if he should raise an army. Carlisle, 29 Oct. at midnight. Signed. Pp. 3. Add.

Wrote on the 24th inst. how their companions in the French court had taken leave, after learning by the writers that the sequestration of Boulogne was not agreeable to Henry, who also thought the means (intimated both by their companions and themselves as suitable for the final pacification) not sufficient to satisfy his claim. But since coming hither, have sent word to their companions that Henry seemed inclined to gratify their Princes, and therefore they should again move the French King for the assembly. This is done, and the French King has consented that they (the ambassadors) should meet for treaty, and that men from both sides may be sent as soon as possible. Have, for the sake of the ancient reputations of the two Kings, decided to beg them, in the name of the Princes, to send their men simultaneously to Calais and Ardre; and their companions, upon showing this to the King, have been answered by the Admiral that, to gratify the Princes and States, the King was well inclined to send in that way, and, if Henry sent men of like quality, would send him (the Admiral) and other personages of the Council. Beg him, therefore, in the name of their Princes, if he consents to treat, either of the sequestration of Boulogne, as heretofore declared by them, or of the final pacification in surrendering Boulogne to France, for recompense, and in comprehending the Scots (seeing that otherwise there seems no likelihood of pacifying differences), to send some of his Council to be at Calais on 11 Nov. or the day following. If he condescends to this, they would like to know by bearer what men he thinks of sending; but if he does not wish to listen to it, they beg him to send their dismissal that they and their companions may return home.

Add.: at Callais. Endd.: aunsweryd at Callais, 8 of November, etc. 31 Oct. 700. Wharton to Henry VIII. R. O.\n\nSt. P., v. 556. On 31 Oct., before day, received the Council's letters dated Windsor, the 27th., requiring him to consider (1) whether Carlaverok be tenable for as long as an army of Scots may lie before it, and (2) whether the Scots are likely to levy an army; concluding that if so, and there is no remedy, the King would deliver it to the Maxwells \"according to the priest's device\" upon their oath to keep it for him. Answers (1) that the house is tenable as long as furnished with ordnance, munition, men and victual; (2) that the Scots cannot levy such an army, and if they did, it could not continue there any time. The hold stands \"in a great strength of creeks and moss and but one way to come to it\"; and he will not deliver it \"to any Scot in Scotland, Maxwell or other,\" save as the Council signify. Has received the letter herewith from Gamboa, showing that he can only furnish 50 or 60 horsemen; and, seeing his sorrow and gentle offer of more footmen, Wharton writes to him for 500 footmen besides the horsemen. Apologises for this boldness. Sundry here think the whole number appointed too little. Wrote to Gamboa by this post, and appointed guides to bring them to Carlisle next Thursday night. (fn. n6) An espial out of Scotland says that the Governor appointed a convention at Lithcoo on Friday, 30 Oct., with men to go with him to Carlaverok; Anguishe and George Dowgles had summons by letter, but would not be there, and intend to lie this winter at Pebles. Another espial is come from Carlaverok, who there saw a letter from the Governor delivered to Larde Johnston, with thanks for Johnston's service against the Englishmen and promise to be there himself on Tuesday next. The Governor may break that appointment as he has broken others. Has word from Thos. Carlton that he has not victual to serve over Wednesday night next, and this day appointed 100 horsemen to lie in Lord Dacre's tower of Roclif, and another 100 to lie upon Esk, intending, tomorrow, to pay them wages for seven days and, with such Englishmen and Scotsmen as he can get, to practise within three or four nights an enterprise for Carlton's relief. Divers Scotsmen much desire Lord Maxwell's coming down; and, as the case stands, it were convenient. Carlisle, last of October. Signed. Pp. 3. Add. Endd.: 1545.

Joan. Sleidanus to Paget. R. O. We write again to the King; and after writing I received your letter of the 28th inst., and much thank you for the trouble you take to come hither, which demonstrates your zeal for the public good. I advertised you that our companions would come on Wednesday last to Ardres (and afterwards they came to this town) to confer with my companion and me. (fn. n7) Which they did; and that the King may know what will be treated we send him our whole advice. For our companions affirm that the King of France has consented to the sequestration, as we declared when with you, and, as to the final peace, is ready to do much for the love of our Princes, but he means to have Boulogne restored to him for reasonable recompense. As you send me word that you will in a few days set out towards the passage, I advertise you of this in order that, if you think that the King would not consent thereto, you may await other news from the King; and I have begged my lord Cobbham that enquiry may be made for you by the way and this packet delivered to you at once. We declare this frankly, and hope that, because of it, the King will not leave off treating, since other means may offer; but if the King does countermand you I beg you to hold me as one that desires to do you service. Of the commissioners of the king of France I can affirm nothing, save that if your master send some great personage the Admiral of France might be there; as you will learn by our letter to the King, which you may read. I will send word in good time when those of France shall be either at Ardres or on the way thither. We have assigned the 11th or 12th of November for them to be at Ardres and you at Calais. Please send me a word in answer. Calais, Saturday, 31 Oct. 1545, in the morning. French. Hol., pp. 3. Add. Endd. 31 Oct. 703. Francis I. R. O.

Harvel to Henry VIII. R. O.\n\nSt. P., x. 646. Wrote on 18 Sept. Today received letters from the Council, of 28 Sept., with Henry's to this Signory, which he delivered, and requested restitution of the Sign or Ludovico de Larme and his gentlemen, banished. The Signory received the letters gratefully and promised to treat the matter in their senate and \"make answer as expediently as they can.\" Has signified to the Countye Barnardo, Angiolo Marian and Philippo Pini to discharge their captains, and next year, if occasion be given, Henry will not refuse their service. Also advertised Angel Marian not to practise further with Signor Loigi Gonsaga and the Countye Rangon for this winter. Wrote in his last of the Hungarian who is gone in Henry's service to Constantinople. Expects letters from him shortly, for he seems diligent. By letters from Constantinople of 29 Sept., affairs of the ambassadors are protracted, and some say that the Turk refuses to compound with the Emperor unless Milan be rendered to the Frenchmen. Venetians affirm that the ambassadors shall depart re infecta. In Piedmont things proceed roughly, both parties \"ingrossing\" themselves. \"It is also renewed that the Bishop is in further practices with the Emperor for more state, being named not only Sene and Luke but also Milan.\" Venice, last of October 1545.
