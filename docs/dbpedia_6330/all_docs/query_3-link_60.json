Through the patronage of Sir George Byng, afterwards Lord Torrington, he was appointed captain of the Stromboli in 1709. He commanded the York in 1717, and the Advice in 1726 in the cruises up the Baltic. In 1727, during the siege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards, he com- manded the Oxford, and in 1731 the Buck- ingham in the Mediterranean. In 1738 he was appointed to command the Hampton Court, and was senior officer at this station until the arrival of Admiral Vernon in the following year. His opportunity arrived in 1739, when, during the war with Spain, he served under Vernon in the attack on Porto- bello, in the isthmus of Darien. He led the squadron into Boca Chica, placing his vessel, the Hampton Court, alongside the strongest part of the fortifications. When the fortress surrendered, the Spanish governor presented his sword in token of submission. Brown very properly declined to receive it, saying he was but l second in command/ and took the governor in his boat to Admiral Vernon. But the Spaniard was obstinate, declaring that but for the insupportable fire of the com- modore he never would have yielded. There- upon Vernon, very handsomely turning to Brown, presented to him the sword, which is still in the possession of his descendants. In 1741 Brown was appointed to the office of commissioner of the navy at Chatham, a situation which he held with unblemished reputation until his death, 23 March 1753. His daughter, Lucy, became the wife of Admiral William Parry, commander-in-chief â€¢of the Leeward Islands ; and her daughter and namesake married Captain Locker, under whom Lord Nelson served in his early days, and who subsequently became lieutenant- governor of Greenwich Hospital. There is VOL. VII. a portrait of Brown in the Painted Hall at Greenwich. [Charnock's Biog. Nav. iv. 1 ; Beatson's Nav. and Mil. Memoirs, i. 49 ; E. H. Locker's Naval Memoirs, 1831 ; H. A. Locker's Naval Gallery of Greenwich Hospital, 1842.] A. L. BROWN, CHARLES ARMITAGE (1787 P-1842 ?), writer on Shakespeare's son- nets and friend of Keats, went to St. Peters- burg at the age of eighteen to conduct the busi- ness of a Russia merchant started there by his eldest brother John. Working on very little capital, and hampered by political dis- turbances, the firm soon collapsed, and about 1810, at the age of twenty-three, Brown re- turned to this country utterly ruined. For some years afterwards he struggled hard for a livelihood, but the death of another brother who had settled in Sumatra put him at length in the possession of a small competence, and he devoted himself to literary pursuits. In 1814 he wrote a serio-comic opera on a Rus- sian subject, entitled 'Narensky, or the Road to Yaroslaf,' with music by Brahamand Reeve. It was acted at Drury Lane, under Arnold's management, for several nights from 11 Jan. 1814, with Braham in the chief part (GENBST, viii.405). The libretto was published in 1814, but its literary quality is poor. Brown made the acquaintance of Keats and his brothers be- fore September 1817. At the time Brown was living at Wentworth Place, Hampstead, a double house part of which was in the occu- pation of Charles Wentworth Dilke, and Keats was living in Well Walk, near at hand. In July 1818 Brown and Keats made a tour together in the north of Scotland. Brown sent a number of amusing letters to Dilke describing the trip, some of which have been printed in Dilke's ' Papers of a Critic/ and in Buxton Forman's elaborate edition of Keats's Brown Brown works. A diary kept by Brown at the same time is unfortunately lost. On the return from Scotland in August, Brown induced Keats to * keep house ' with him at Went- worth Place, each paying his own expenses ; and there Brown introduced the poet to Fanny Brawne and her mother, who had hired Brown's rooms during his absence in the north, and had thus made his acquaint- ance. At Wentworth Place Keats wrote his play of 'Otho,' the plot of which he owed to Brown. In April 1819 Keats wrote some hu- morous Spenserian stanzas on Brown, which are printed in the various editions of the poet's works. In 1820 Keats left for Rome, with his health rapidly breaking. In 1822, shortly after Keats's death, Brown paid a long visit to Italy. He met Byron at Florence, and tried to induce him to take a just view of Keats's poetry and character. In 1824 Kirk- patrick introduced Brown to Landor, and the introduction led to a long intimacy. For many years Brown was a frequent visitor at Lander's villa at Fiesole. In April 1835 Brown returned to England and lived near Plymouth. He busied himself in public lec- turing on Keats and Shakespeare, and in writing for newspapers and reviews. Landor visited him in 1837. In the middle of 1841 he suddenly left England for New Zealand, in the hope partly of improving his fortune and partly of recovering his health, which had been failing for some time. He obtained a government grant of land at Taranaky, New Plymouth, but he was so dissatisfied with its quality and situation that he resolved to re- turn to England. He wrote from New Zea- land to Joseph Severn, under date 22 Jan. 1842, announcing this resolve, but he appa- rently died before beginning the journey. In this, his last extant letter, he mentions that he was engaged on a ' Handbook of New Zealand.' A number of Keats's manuscripts came into Brown's possession on the poet's 'death, and Brown determined to publish some of them with a memoir by himself. He printed a few of Keats's unpublished works in the ' New Monthly Magazine,' but a short bio- graphical sketch which he wrote of his friend was refused by the booksellers and by the ' Morning Chronicle.' On leaving England, Brown made overall his manuscripts relating to Keats to R. Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton, whom he first met at Fiesole in April 1833. In his well-known book on Keats, Lord Houghton made a free use of Brown's papers. Brown's best-known literary work is his 1 Shakespeare's Autobiographical Poems, be- ing his Sonnets clearly developed, with his Character drawn chiefly from his Works/ London, 1838. Brown dedicated the book to Landor, with whom he had first discussed its subject at Florence in 1828. It is Brown's endeavour to show that Shakespeare's sonnets conceal a fairly complete autobiography of the poet, and although Boaden had suggested a similar theory in 1812, Brown was the first to treat it with adequate fulness or know- ledge. Brown often illustrates Shakespeare from Italian literature, with which he was widely acquainted. Lord Houghton says that Keats learned from Brown all that he knew of Ariosto, and that Brown scarcely let a day pass in Italy without translating from the Italian. His l complete and admirable Version of the first five Cantos of Boiardo's \"Orlando Innamorato\"' (HOUGHTON) was unfortunately never published. Of Brown's contributions to periodical literature, his pa- pers in the ' Liberal,' signed Carlone and Car- lucci, are very good reading. One called ' Les Charmettes and Rousseau ' has been wrongly assigned to Charles Lamb, and another, ' On Shakespeare's Fools,' equally wrongly to Charles Cowden Clarke. A story in the ' Ex- aminer ' for 1823 entitled ' La Bella Tabac- caia ' is also by Brown. Various references to Brown in the letters of his literary friends, among whom Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt are to be included, prove that he was at all times excellent company. Leigh Hunt is believed to refer to him in the ( Tatler ' for 14 Jan. 1831, as ' one of the most genuine wits now living.' Joseph Severn, Keats's friend, maintained a fairly regular corre- spondence with Brown for more than twenty years (1820-42), and many of Brown's letters to Severn and other literary friends will be printed in the ' Severn Memoirs,' edited by Mr. William Sharp. [Information from the late W. Dilke of Chi- chester, from the late Lord Houghton, from Mr. William Sharp, and from Mr. Sidney Colvin ; Buxton Forman's complete edition of Keats's works (1883) ; Dilke's Papers of a Critic ; Lord Houghton's Life of Keats (1848) ; Forster's Life of Landor; Notes and Queries, 5th ser. vii. 388, 6th spr. viii. 392. Mr. W. Dilke was of opinion that Brown was never known by the second name of Armitage until the publication of Lord Houghton's Life of Keats. On the title-page of the opera Narensky (1814) Brown is called Mr. Charles Brown, but on that of his work on Shakespeare's sonnets he is called Charles Armi- tage Brown. His eldest brother's name was John Armitage Brown. A son Charles or Car lino, who settled with him in New Zealand, survived him.] S. L. L. BROWN, CHARLES PHILIP (1798- 1884), Telugu scholar, son of the Rev. David Brown Brown Brown [q. v.], provost of the college of Cal- cutta, entered the Madras Civil Service in 1817, was employed for many years in revenue, magisterial, and judicial duties in the districts of Cuddapah and Masulipatam, where, in ad- dition to a knowledge of Persian, Sanskrit, and Hindustani, he acquired that mastery over the hitherto neglected language and literature of Telugu. which entitles him to a foremost place among South Indian scholars. He was appointed in 1838 Persian translator, and in 1846 postmaster-general and Telugu trans- lator to the Madras government, and became at the same time a member of the council of education, a government director of the Madras bank, and curator of manuscripts in the college library. He resigned in 1855, after thirty-eight years of service. His principal and Hindustani. On his return to England he accepted the post of professor of Telugu at University College. Among his titles to fame must be reckoned the fine collection of manuscripts, including over 2,000 Sanskrit and Telugu works, which he presented in 1845 to the Madras Literary Society, and which now form part of the government college library. [Autobiography (privately printed), with pre- face by D. F. Carmichael; Athenaeum, No. 2984; Times, 20 Dec. 1884; Ann. BeportKoyal Asiatic Society, 1885.] S. L.-P. BROWN, DAVID (Jl. 1795), landscape- painter, commenced his artistic career by painting signboards. At the age of thirty- five he placed himself for some time under works were his valuable dictionaries of Telu- George Morland, and made copies of that ar- gu-English (Madras, 1852), English-Telugu i tist's pictures, which are stated to have been (Madras, 1852), and 'Mixed Dialects and Foreign Words used in Telugu ' (Madras, 1854), published at the expense of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. His other writings included : l Prosody of the Telugu and Sanskrit Languages explained,' Madras, 1827 ; ' Vemana's Verses, Moral, Keligious, and Satirical,' Madras, 1829 ; ' Fa- miliar Analysis of Sanskrit Prosody,' London, 1837 ; ' New Telugu Version of St. Luke/ 1838 ; ' Grammar of the Telugu Language,' Madras, 1840, 2nd ed. 1857 ; ' Cyclic Tables of Hindu and Mahomedan Chronology of the Telugu andKanadi Countries,' Madras, 1850 ; 1 English and Hindustani Phraseology/ Cal- cutta, 1850; 'Ephemeris, showing the cor- responding Dates according to the English, Telugu, Malayalam, and Mahomedan Calen- dars, 1751-1850 ;' 'Telugu Reader: a Series of Letters, Private and on Business, and Revenue Matters, with English Translation/ Madras, 1852; 'Dialogues in Telugu and English/ 2nd ed.

He also edited 'Three Treatises on Mirasi Rights/ &c. ; translated from Mahratta the lives of Haidar Ali and Tippoo ; and printed in 1866 an auto- biography for private circulation. He was a frequent contributor to the ' Madras Journal of Literature and Science.' Some of his works were translated into Tamil, Canarese, since frequently sold as originals. Being un- able to endure the excesses of his master, he left the metropolis and obtained employment in the country as a drawing-master. The dates of his birth and death are unknown, but he exhibited at the Royal Academy ten land- scapes between 1792 and 1797. [Redgrave's Dictionary of Artists, 1878/1 L.F. , DAVID (1763-1812), Bengal chaplain and founder of the Calcutta Bible Society, was born in Yorkshire, and was edu- cated first under private tuition at Scarbo- rough, and afterwards at a grammar school at Hull under the Rev. Joseph Milner [q. v.], author of the ' History of the Church/ and at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Having taken holy orders and been appointed to a chaplaincy in Bengal, Brown reached Cal- cutta in 1786, and was immediately placed in charge of an extensive orphanage in that city, being at the same time appointed chap- lain to the brigade at Fort William. In ad- dition to these duties Brown took charge of the mission church. In 1 794 he was appointed presidency chaplain, in which office he is said to have commanded in an unusual degree the respect and esteem of the English at Calcutta. Among his most intimate friends were Henry Marty n, Claudius Buchanan, and Thomas Thomason, all of whom were successively re- ceived in his house on their first arrival in India, and regarded him as their chief guide and counsellor. To the cause of Christian missions he devoted himself with untiring zeal, labouring in it himself and affording generous aid to missionaries, both of the church of England and of other denominations. Brown's health failing in 1 8 1 2,he embarked, for the benefit of sea air, in a vessel bound u2 Brown Brown for Madras, which was wrecked on the voyage down the Bay of Bengal. The passengers and crew were rescued by another vessel and taken back to Calcutta, where Brown died on 14 June 1812. Charles Philip Brown [q. v.] was his son. [Bengal Obituary ; Memoir of Rev. Claudius Buchanan, D.D., by Rev. Hugh Pearson, London, 1819; Memoir of Rev. Thomas Thomason, by Rev. Thomas Sargent, 1833.] A. J. A. BROWN, GEORGE (d. 1628), an Eng- lish Benedictine monk, who in religion as- sumed the Christian name of Gregory, is believed to have been the translator, from the Italian, of the 'Life of St. Mary Magdalen de' Pazzi,' 1619. It is dedicated to Lady Mary Percy, abbess of the English convent of St. Benet at Brussels. Brown died at Celle, near Paris, on 21 Oct. 1628. [Oliver's Hist, of the Catholic Religion in Cornwall, 508 ; Weldon's Chronological Notes (1881), 158, Append. 6.] T. C. BROWN, GEORGE (1650-1730), arith- metician, was born in 1650, and was ap- pointed minister of the parish of Kilmaurs, in the presbytery of Irvine and county of Ayr, about 1680 (Scorr, Fasti, ii. pt. i. p. 178), having been ' translated from Stranraer ' (ibid. p. 384). 'About 1700 he was frequently charged for exercising discipline and marrying without proclamation' (ibid. p. 178). 'He in- vented an instrument called Rotula Arithme- tica, to teach those of very ordinary capacity who can but read figures to add, subtract, mul- tiply, and divide, on which the privy council, 13 Dec. 1698, recommended the lords of the treasury \" to give a reasonable allowance to be ane encouragement to him \" ' (ibid. p. 384). In explanation of this instrument he published 1 Rotula Arithmetica, with an Account there- of,' 12mo, Edinburgh, 1700, and in the same year produced 'A Specie Book serving at one View to turn any pure Number of any Pieces of Silver, current in this Kingdom, into Pounds Scots or Sterling,' 12mo, Edin- burgh, 1700. He next published ' A Com- pendious, but a Compleat System of Decimal Arithmetick, containing more Exact Rules for ordering Infinites than any hitherto extant,' 4to, Edinburgh, 1701, which he dedicated Â« to John Spotiswood, Baron of Spotiswood, Advo- cate ; ' on the title-page he described himself as ' minister of Killmarice.' His last work was ' Arithmetica Infinita ; or the Accurate Accomptant's Best Companion, contriv'd and calculated by the Reverend George Brown, A.M., and printed for the Author,' sq. 12mo, Edinburgh, 1718. This work, which was com- mended by Dr. Keill, F.R.S., Savilian profes- sor of astronomy at Oxford, was published by subscription. Brown died in 1730. [Watt's Bibl. Brit. ; Sinclair's New Statistical Account of Scotland, 1845 ; Scott's Fasti Ecclesise Scoticanae, 1868.] A. H. G. BROWN, SIR GEORGE (1790-1865), general, third son of George Brown, provost of Elgin, was born at Linkwood, near Elgin, on 3 July 1790. He was educated at the Elgin academy, and showed an inclination to enter the army. His uncle, Colonel John Brown, procured him a commission, and he was gazetted an ensign in the 43rd regiment on 23 Jan. 1806. He joined his regiment in Sicily, and was promoted lieutenant on 18 Sept. 1806, and served in the expedition to Copenhagen in 1807, at the battle of Vi- meiro, and in the retreat upon Corunna under Sir John Moore. In 1809 the 43rd was bri- gaded with the 52nd and 95th, and formed part of the famous light brigade. Brown was present in all its actions until in June 1811 he was promoted captain into the 3rd gar- rison battalion, and obtained leave to join the staff college at Great Marlow. Brown ex- changed into the 85th regiment in July 1812, which in August 1813 was sent to the Penin- sula, and formed one of the regiments in the unattached brigade under the command of Major-general Lord Aylmer. The brigade was engaged in the battles of the Nivelle and the Nive, in which Brown so greatly distinguished himself that he was promoted major on 26 May 1814. The 85th was then sent to ioin the expedition under General Ross in America, and at the battle of Bladensburg Brown was wounded so severely that his life was despaired of, and for his gallant conduct there he was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 26 Sept. 1814. So far Brown had had a brilliant military career. He was now selected for various staff appointments at home and abroad, and while serving as assistant quartermaster-general at Malta in 1826 he married a Miss Macdonell, third daughter of Hugh Macdonell. In 1828 Lord Hill, the commander-in-chief, appointed him deputy assistant adjutant-general at head- quarters. At the Horse Guards he remained in various staff appointments for more than twenty-five years, and in such capacities he rose to the highest ranks in the army without seeing any further service. In 1831 he was promoted colonel and made a K.H., and some years afterwards was appointed deputy adju- tant-general at the Horse Guards. In 1841 he was promoted major-general, and in 1850 he was appointed adjutant-general at the Horse Guards by the Duke of Wellington ; he was promoted lieutenant-general in 1851 ; and, in recognition of his long official services, Brown Brown lie was made a K.C.B. in April 1852. Soon after Lord Hardinge had succeeded Welling- ton as commander-in-chief Brown resigned his post at the Horse Guards in December 1853. His resignation was almost certainly caused by the reforms introduced into the administration of the army by Lord Har- dinge, but it has been hinted that it was partly due to the interference of the prince consort with the details of military business. In 1854 Brown was selected for a command in the army intended for the East, and soon showed that his long official life had made him something of a martinet. He was the first ot the general officers to reach Turkey, and his policy of 'pipe-claying, close-shaving, and tight-stocking ' was strongly condemned by the ' Times ' correspondent. Though he kept his men under close discipline, he was endeared to them by his kindness when the cholera broke out at Varna. He took command of the light division, and on landing in the Crimea in advance of his soldiers was nearly taken prisoner by a Russian outpost. At the battle of the Alma his division was in the heat of the battle, and his horse was shot down under him while he was cheering on the 23rd Welsh fusiliers to the attack on the Russian centre. After the allied army took up its position be- fore Sebastopol, the light division was posted on the Victoria Ridge, and so did not bear the brunt of the Russian attack on 5 Nov. Brown was soon on the field, and seems to have led the opportune attack of the French Zouaves, who recaptured the three guns of Boothby's demi-battery, which the Russians had just taken, and in doing so he was shot through the left arm and wounded in the chest (KINGLAZE, Invasion of the Crimea, v. 325). He refused to go home on account of his wounds, and assisted Lord Raglan, to whom he was by seniority second in command, through the winter, and in May 1855 he com- manded the English contingent to the Sea of Azoff, which took Kertch and Yenikale. On 28 June 1855, however, the day on which Lord Raglan died, he was invalided home by a medical board, and the imputation that he was jealous of Sir James Simpson is therefore unfounded (see Surgeon Watkins's letter to the ' Times ' on 5 Sept. 1865). He was made a G.C.B. in July 1855 and promoted general in September 1855, and was appointed colonel of the 1st battalion of the rifle brigade. On the conclusion of the war he was also made a knight grand cross of the Legion of Honour and a knight of the Medjidie. In 1860 he was appointed commander-in-chief in Ireland and sworn of the privy council there, and in 1863 he became colonel of the 32nd regiment and colonel-in-chief of the rifle brigade. In April 1865 he resigned his command, and on 27 Aug. he died at his brother's house of Link- wood, near Elgin, the house in which he was born.

M. S. BROWJST, GEORGE HILARY, D.D. (1786-1856), catholic prelate, born 13 Jan. 1786, was educated at St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, where he became vice-president and professor of theology. Afterwards he was missioner at Lancaster. On the partition of the northern district he was appointed vicar- apostolic of the Lancashire district by Pope Gregory XVI, and was consecrated at Rome on 24 Aug. 1840 with the title of bishop of Tloa 'in partibus infidelium.' On the re- storation of the hierarchy by Pius IX in 1850 he was translated to the newly erected see of Liverpool, in which town he died on 25 Jan. 1856. [Catholic Directory (1885), 59, 159; Weekly Eegister, 2 Feb. 1856.] T. C. BROWN, GILBERT (d. 1612), Scotch catholic divine, was descended from the ancient family of Carsluith, in the parish of Kirkmabreck. He entered the Cistercian order, and was the last abbot of Sweetheart, or New Abbey, in the stewartry of Kirkcud- bright, about seven miles from Dumfries. In that capacity he sat in parliament, 17 Aug. 1560, whilst the confession of faith was approved. He was, however, an active op- ponent of the Reformation. In 1578 he was complained of as being zealous in instructing the family of Lord Herries ; and in the fol- lowing year he was accused before the gene- ral assembly of enticing people within the bounds of 'papistrie.' Brown laboured so zealously for the catholic cause in Glasgow, in Paisley, and in Galloway, that in 1588 the general assembly complained of his ' busy- ness.' Lord Herries then expelled the pres- byterian ministers from Dumfries. As all endeavours to stop the catholic reaction proved unavailing, the general assembly, in 1594, petitioned for Brown's apprehension by the guard. At this period he entered into a written controversy with John Welsche, minister of Ayr, and composed ' Ane Answere to ane certaine libell or writing, sent by Mr. John Welsche, to ane Catholicke, as ane Answer to ane Objection of the Romane Kirk, whereby they go about to deface the veritie of that onely true religion whilk we Brown 6 Brown professe.' This elicited from Welsche 'A Reply against Mr. Gilbert Browne, priest,' Edinburgh, 1602, 4to, afterwards reprinted under the title of ' Popery anatomized.' At the time Welsche published this reply Dum- fries l had become the seat of excommuni- cated papists and Jesuits : ' and the abbot is described as the 'famous excommunicat, foirfaultit, and perverting papist, named Mr. Gilbert Browne, Abbot of New Abbey, quho evir since the reformatioun of religioune had conteinit in ignorance and idolatrie allmost the haill south-west partis of Scotland, and had been continowallie occupyit in practise- ing of heresy.' At length Abbot Brown was captured near New Abbey in August 1605. The country people rose in arms to rescue him, but were overpowered by Lord Cranstoun and his guardsmen. Brown was first conveyed to Blackness castle, and thence transferred to the castle of Edinburgh, ' where he was interteaned upon the kings expences till his departure out of the coun- trie' (CALDERWOOD, Historic of the Kirk of Scotland, vi. 295). Eventually he was banished, and he died at Paris on 14 May 1612. [Cat. of Printed Books in Brit.

In his twenty-first year he was admitted into the society of Jesuits at Compostella. After teaching belles-lettres for some time in Cas- tile, he was sent on a mission into his own country, whence removing into France, he became rector, in 1676, of the newly founded Irish seminary at Poitiers. Having been appointed confessor to the Queen of Spain, he died at Valladolid in 1679, during a journey to Madrid. He was the author of 'The Unerring and Unerrable Church, in Answer to a Sermon of Andrew Sail, preached at Christ Church, Dublin, in July 1674' (dedicated in ironical terms to the Earl of Essex), 1675, and < An Unerrable Church or None. Being a Rejoinder to \" The Unerring and Unerrable Church,\" against Dr. Andrew Sail's Reply, entitled \"The Catholic and Apostolic Church of England'\" (dedicated to the Duke of Ormonde), 1678. He is also the reputed author of a treatise, ' Pax Vobis.' [Ware's Works (Harris), ii. 186-7.] T. F. H. BROWN, JAMES (1709-1788), traveller and scholar, was son of James Brown, M.D., of Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he was born on 23 May 1709. He received his edu- cation at Westminster School, 'where he was well instructed in the Latin and Greek classics,' notwithstanding that he must have left school at the early age of thirteen, as in the year 1722 he went with his father to Constantinople. During the three years of his stay in the East on this occasion, the boy, ' having a great natural aptitude for the learning of languages, acquired a competent knowledge of Turkish, vulgar Greek, and Italian.' In 1725 he returned home, and 'made himself master of the Spanish lan- guage.' About the year 1732 he conceived for the first time (it has been said) the idea of a ' Directory of the Principal Traders in London.' A ' Directory ' upon a similar plan had, however, been already published in Lon- don as early as 1677. After having been at some pains to lay the foundation of it, he gave it to Henry Kent, printer, in Finch Lane, Corn- hill, who made a fortune by the publication. In 1741 he attempted to carry out a more ambi- tious project, namely, to establish a trade with Persia via Russia. Having entered into an agreement for the purpose with twenty-four of the principal merchants of London, mem- bers of the Russia Company, he sailed for Riga on Michaelmas day 1741, ' passed through Russia, down the Volga to Astra- chan, and sailed along the Caspian Sea to Reshd in Persia, where he established a factory, in which he continued near four years.' While there he was the bearer of a letter from George II to Nadir Shah. Dis- satisfied with his employers, and impressed with the dangers to which the factory was exposed from the unsettled nature of the Persian government, he resigned his post, and reached London on Christmas day 1746. The following year the factory at Reshd was plundered, and a final period put to the Persia trade. His old aptitude for languages enabled him during his four years' stay at Reshd to acquire such proficiency in Persian that on his return he compiled ' a copious Persian Dictionary and Grammar,' which, however, was never published. Lysons states that Brown was also the author of a trans- lation of two orations of Isocrates, published anonymously. He died of a paralytic stroke on 30 Nov. 1788, at his house in Stoke New- ington, where he had resided since 1734, and was buried in the parish church of St. Mary, where there is a tomb erected to his memory (LYSONS, iii. 290). [Gent. Mag. Iviii. pt. ii. p. 1128; Lyson.s's Environs of London, iii. 301-2.] G. V. B. Brown Brown BROWN, JAMES, D.D. (1812-1881), catholic bishop, was born on 11 Jan. 1812, at Wolverhampton. There, in the old chapel of SS. Peter and Paul in North Street, he often, when a child, served the mass of Bishop Milner. That prelate, taking a great liking to the boy, and observing in his little acolyte the signs of a vocation to the ecclesiastical state, sent him, in 1820, to Sedgeley Park Academy. There he remained until June 1826, and in the following August was placed by Bishop Milner, as a clerical student, at St. Mary's College, Old Oscott, now known as Maryvale. He completed his studies as an Oscotian with marked success, being chiefly distinguished by his proficiency in classics. On 18 Feb. 1837 he was ordained Eriest by Bishop Walsh. For several years e remained at Old and (from 1838 onwards) at New Oscott as professor and prefect of studies until, in January 1844, he returned to Sedgeley Park as vice-president, being af- terwards, before the year was out, promoted to the rank of president. Six years later on he was still holding that position when, in the summer of 1851, he was advanced to the episcopate. He was consecrated, on 27 July 1851, the first bishop of Shrews- bury in St. George's Cathedral, Southwark, by Cardinal Wiseman. Immediately after his consecration Brown went to reside at Salter's Hall, near Newport in Shropshire. His diocese comprised within it not only Shropshire and Cheshire, but also the six counties of North Wales. Such was the energy of his episcopal governance during the thirty years that elapsed between 1851 and 1881 that within that interval he had increased the number of priests there from thirty-three to ninety-five, of churches from thirty to eighty-eight, of monasteries from one to six, and of convents from one to eleven. And whereas in 1851 he had found not one poor school at all he left flourishing, near St. Asaph, the fine establishment of St. Beuno's College, and scattered all over his diocese sixty-three poor schools, at which 9,273 children were in daily attendance. Much of this wonderful increase was directly trace- able to his untiring energy and his remark- able power of organisation. In September 1868 Brown left Newport and went to re- side at Shrewsbury. On 8 Dec. 1869 he took part in the inauguration of the (Ecu- menical Council of the Vatican. On 17 April 1870 he was named by Pius IX one of the bishops assistant at the pontifical throne. Some weeks before the declaration of the dogma of papal infallibility, on 18 July 1870, Brown was released from his attend- ance upon it on the score of ill-health, and received permission to return homewards. On 27 July 1876 the silver jubilee of his episcopate was celebrated in the cathedral church at Shrewsbury, memorial gifts to the value of 1,600^. being presented to him on , the occasion. His health breaking down three years afterwards he obtained the assist- | ance of an auxiliary, Edmund Knight, who | was consecrated on 25 July 1879. Brown ! then went to live at St. Mary's Grange, I a sequestered spot near Shrewsbury, then ! recently purchased by him as the site of his [ proposed seminary. His active episcopal I work had thenceforth to be abandoned. But to the close of his life he sedulously watched over the general administration of his diocese. Death came to him at last very gently, in his seventieth year, on 14 Oct. 1881, at St. Mary's Grange. He had been present at four pro- vincial councils (those of 1852, 1855, 1859, and 1873) held during the time of his episco- pate. He presided at his own first diocesan synod in December 1853, at St. Alban's, Macclesfield.

K. BROWN, JAMES BALDWIN, the elder (1785-1843), miscellaneous writer, was called | to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1816, and practised on the northern circuit and at the Lancashire quarter sessions. He was ap- pointed judge of the Oldham court of re- quests in 1840, and died in November 1843. Brown married a sister of the Rev. Thomas Raffles, D.D., and was father of the Rev. James Baldwin Brown [q. v.] His portrait has been engraved. He was the author of: 1.

BROWN, JAMES BALDWIN, the younger (1820-1884), nonconformist divine, was the eldest son of Dr. James Baldwin Brown the elder [q. v.] Born in 1820 at Brown 8 Brown King's Bench Walk, Temple, he was sent to the London University, and at the age of eighteen was amongst the recipients of the first degrees granted by that body. It was intended that Brown should follow his father's profession, and he kept his terms at the Inner Temple for that purpose. He afterwards determined to devote himself to the ministry, and became a student at High- bury College. In 1843 he accepted the charge of a congregational church at Derby, and three years later he removed to London, becoming minister of Claylands Chapel, Clapham Road. During his ministry here Brown was distinguished for the breadth of his theological views. When the * Rivulet ' controversy arose in connection with the Rev. T. T. Lynch and his writings, Brown protested with other nonconformists against the severe attacks made upon Mr. Lynch. He also threw himself into the controversy on the doctrine of annihilation, and published a collection of discourses on the subject in op- position to the view held by the great body of the congregationalists. In 1870 Brown removed with the greater part of his congre- gation to a new and more commodious church in Brixton Road, with which his name was associated until his death. In 1878 Brown was elected to the chair of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. During his tenure of office he once more showed himself to be a fearless contro- versialist. A conference was held at Leices- ter, in which an effort was made by certain congregational ministers holding unorthodox views to fraternise with Unitarians and other advanced thinkers. Brown warmly supported the arguments of the advanced school, but the majority at the conference carried a resolution reaffirming the tenets expressed in the Con- gregational Declaration of Faith and Order. The enforced separation from friends on this and other occasions affected Brown keenly. Brown was a voluminous writer, as well as an active preacher and lecturer. In 1869 he published a volume entitled ' The Divine Mysteries.' He was also the author of: 1. * Studies of First Principles' (1848, &c.) 2. l Competition, the Labour Market, and Christianity ' (1851). 3. < The Divine Life in Man ' (1860). 4. < Aids to the Develop- ment of the Divine Life ' (1862). 5. l The Home Life ' (1866). 6. 'The Christian Policy of Life ' (1870). 7. ' Buying and Selling and getting Gain ' (1871). 8. 'First Principles of Ecclesiastical Truth' (1871). 9. < Our Morals and Manners' (1872). 10. 'The Higher Life ' (1874). 11. < The Battle and Burden of Life ' (1875). 12. < The Doctrine of An- nihilation in the Light of the Gospel of Love ' (1875) ; and a number of other works, sermons,, and contributions to periodical literature. For some time before his death Brown had! been in feeble health, and laid aside from active work. He was contemplating a visit to Switzerland when he was struck down with apoplexy, and died on 23 June 1884. Brown's reputation as a preacher extended far beyond his own denomination. In all public movements he took a great interest, and at such crises as the Lancashire cotton famine, the American civil war, the Franco- German war, &c., his sympathies and aid went out towards the distressed and the suf- fering. He was of a sensitive and active temperament, taking a great delight in work. His discourses were marked by much fervour, intellectual force, and literary finish. He deeply lamented the exclusiveness of the es- tablished church, and was a warm advocate of the claims of dissenters at the universi- ties. One of the reforms for which he had long striven was accomplished when Brown lived to see his own son take a first-class at Oxford after a brilliant university career. In culture and versatility of parts he wa& himself justly distinguished. [Times, 24 June 1884; Christian World, 26 June 1884 ; Brixton Free Press, 28 June 1 884 ; In Memoriam, James Baldwin Brown, by Mrs. Elizabeth Baldwin Brown (1884).] G-. B. S. BROWN, JOHN (d. 1532), sergeant painter to King Henry VIII, was appointed to the office by patent, dated 11 Jan. 1512, with a salary of 2d. a day, and a livery of four ells of woollen cloth at 6s. 8d. a yard at Christmas. On 12 March 1527 this salary was raised to 10/. a year. The work on which he was employed was not of a very elevated character. It consisted, as far as can be dis- covered from the records of the king's expenses, of painting flags for the Great Harry and other ships, surcoats and trappings for tournaments, banners and standards for the army sent into France under the Duke of Suffolk in 1523, escutcheons of arms, gilding the roofs and other decorations for a banqueting house at Greenwich, and for the castle at Guisnes in preparation for the Field of the Cloth of Gold. The only existing picture which was ever sup- posed to have been by his hand is a portrait on panel in the British Museum. It was pre- sented by Sir Thomas Mantel of Dover, and now bears the number 93. It is inscribed ' Maria Princeps An0 Doni. 1531. I. B.' ' In some respects,' says Sir Frederick Madden, 1 it resembles the Burghley picture, but its authenticity has been questioned.' The fact is that the face does not bear the least resem- blance to the features of Queen Mary, and the Brown Brown costume is some thirty years or so later than the date given in the inscription, which can- not be contemporary with the painting. In 1522 Brown was elected alderman of London, but resigned the office in 1525, before he had served either as sheriff or mayor. During the last years of his life he sat on the com- mission of the peace in Essex and Middle- sex. He was a member of the companies of Haberdashers and Painter Stainers, and shortly before his death (24 Sept. 1532) con- veyed to the latter company his house in Little Trinity Lane, which has from that time continued to be the hall of the company. The house had been in his possession since 1504. His portrait, dated 1504, is preserved in the hall, but is apparently a copy painted after the great fire of 1666, when the hall was burnt. His arms were ' argent on a fess counter embattled, sable, 3 escallops of the first ; on a canton, quarterly gules and azure, a leopard's head caboshed, or : ' crest, ' on a wreath argent and sable, a crane's head azure, beaked gules, winged or, the neck and wings each charged with an escallop counterchanged, and holding in its beak an oak branch fructed proper.' This resembles the coat borne by the Brownes of Kent. In the British Mu- seum is a book (Lansdowne MS. 858) which once belonged to him, and has his signature. It is the account of banners, &c., furnished to the Duke of Suffolk, and contains the shields of arms in colours of sovereigns of Europe and English nobles. By his will, dated 17 Sept. 1532, and proved 2 Dec. of the same year, it appears that he left a widow Anne and two daughters, Elizabeth and Isabel. By a pre- vious wife, Alice, he probably had two daugh- ters, married to Richard Colard and Edmund Lee. A house at Kingsland and lands in Hackney, and another house called 'The Swan on the Hope ' in the Strand, are mentioned, and certain books of arms and badges be- queathed to his servant. He was buried in St. Vedast's, Foster Lane. [Calendar of State Papers of Hen.

He was probably not settled till 1655, although he comes first into notice in some highly complimentary references to him in Samuel Rutherford's letters in 1637. In the year 1655 he was ordained minister of the parish of Wamphray in Annandale. For many years he seems to have been quietly engaged in his pastoral duties, in which he must have- been very efficient, for his name still lives in the district in affectionate remembrance. After the restoration he was not only com- pelled by the acts of parliament of 1662 to leave his charge, but he was one of a few ministers who were arrested and banished,, owing to the ability and earnestness with which they had opposed the arbitrary conduct of the king in the affairs of the church. On 6 Nov. 1662 he was sentenced to be kept a close prisoner in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh,, his crime being that he had called some ministers ' false knaves ' for keeping synod with the archbishop. The state of the prison causing his health to break down, he was- banished 11 Dec. from the king's dominionsr and ordered not to return on pain of death. He went to Holland. In 1676 Charles II urged the States-General to banish him from their country, a step which they refused to take. For a few years he was minister of the- Scotch church in Rotterdam, and shortly before his death, which occurred in 1679, he took part in the ordination of Richard Cameron [q. v.] He was the author of many learned and elaborate works, among which were â€” ' Apologetical Relation of the Sufferings of Ministers of the Church of Scot- land since 1660,' 1665 ; ' Libri duo contra Woltzogenium et Velthusium,' 1670 ; ' De- Causa Dei adversus anti-Sabbatarios,' 2 vols. 4to, 1674-76 ; l Quakerism the Pathway to- Paganism,' 1678 ; ' An Explanation of the- Epistle to the Romans,' 1679 ; ' The Life of Justification opened,' 1695. Other treatises were published between 1720 and 1792, and a manuscript history of the church is in the uni- versity library at Edinburgh. Of his treatise- on justification a writer says : 'It is by far our most thorough exposition and discussion of the doctrine it handles ; and it is all the more to be prized because of the particular bearing it has on the new views which Baxter and others had begun to propagate, and which in, some shape are ever returning among our- selves' (JAMES WALKEK, D.D., Carnwath,, The Theology and Theologians of Scotland).

BROWN, JOHN (1627P-1685), the f Christian carrier,' one of the most eminent names in the Scottish covenanting martyro- Brown 10 Brown logy during the stormy period known as the ' killing time ' before the revolution of 1688, was born about 1627. He lived in a desolate place called Priestfield or Priesthill, in the upland parish of Muirkirk in Kyle, Ayrshire, where he cultivated a small piece of ground and acted as a carrier. Wodrow describes him as ' of shining piety,' and one who had ' great measures of solid digested knowledge, and had a singular talent of a most plain and affecting way of communicating his knowledge to others.' He had (according to Claverhouse's account) fought against the government at the battle of Both well Bridge (1679); he refused to 'hear the episcopal ministers,' he instructed the people in the principles of his church, and he was on in- timate terms with the leaders of the perse- cuted party. In 1682 Alexander Peden, one of the chief of these, united him in marriage to his second wife, Marion Weir (who figures prominently in Brown's death-scene), and on this occasion Peden, according to Walker, foretold the husband's early and violent end. ' Keep linen by you for his winding-sheet,' he added. Early in the morning of 1 May 1685 Brown and his nephew were at work in the fields cutting peat. There was a thick mist, out of which Graham of Claverhouse with his dragoons suddenly appeared and seized the two men. According to that commander's re- port, drawn up not many hours after the event, what followed was this : ' They had no arms about them, and denied they had any. But being asked if they would take the abjura- tion, the eldest of the two, called John Brown, refused it. Nor would he swear not to rise in arms against the king, but said he knew no king' (according to an act of the Scottish privy council, 22 Nov. 1684, such refusal was punishable with instant death, WODROW, book iii. ch. viii.) ' Upon which, and there being found bullets and match in his house, and treasonable papers, I caused shoot him dead, which he suffered very unconcernedly ' (Claverhouse to Queensberry, 3 May 1685, quoted in Life referred to below). Many additional details are given by the covenant- ing historians. Wodrow tells us that the sol- diers were so moved by the manner in which Brown prayed before his death that they refused to fire at him, and that Olaverhouse * was forced to turn executioner himself, and in a fret shot him with his own hand before his own door, his wife with a young infant standing by, and she very near the time of her delivery of another child.' Patrick Walker's account was drawn up from information after- wards supplied to him by ' the said Marion Weir, sitting upon her husband's grave.' It contains a striking conversation between the widow and Claverhouse, and an affecting picture of the lonely woman, after the dra- goons were gone, performing the last rites to her husband's body, covering it with her plaid and sitting down in the solitude to weep over him. According to Walker's ver- sion it was the dragoons, and not Claver- house himself, who performed the execution. A monument was afterwards erected to mark the spot where Brown was buried.

W-T. BROWN, JOHN (d. 1736), chemist, was elected F.R.S. in iÂ£3% and during 1723- 1725 served on its council. He discovered the presence of magnesia in sea-water (Phil. Trans, xxxii. 348), and the nature of Prussian blue (Phil. Trans, xxxiii. 17). H. F. M. BROWN, JOHN (1715-1766), author of the * Estimate,' was born at Rothbury, North- umberland, where his father was curate, 5 Nov. 1715. His father, John Brown, a member of the Haddington family, had been ordained by a Scotch bishop, and at the end of 1715 became vicar of Wigton. The son was sent to the Wigton grammar school. On 18 June 1732 he matriculated at St. John's College, Cambridge, and took his B. A. degree with distinction in 1735. He took orders, and was appointed minor canon and lecturer by the dean and chapter of Carlisle. He showed his loyalty by serving as a volunteer in 1745 at the siege of Carlisle, and his sound whig principles in two sermons afterwards published. He thus obtained the notice of Dr. Osbaldiston, dean of York, who in 1747 became bishop of Carlisle, and who appointed Brown one of his chaplains. An accidental omission of the Athanasian Creed at the ap- pointed time brought a censure ; and Brown, after reading the creed out of due course, to show his orthodoxy, resigned his canonry. A poem upon ' Honour ' (first published in 1743), and an ' Essay upon Satire,' appeared in the third volume of Dodsley's collection. The last was ' occasioned by the death of Mr. Pope,' and contains a high compliment to Pope's literary executor, Warburton. War- burton saw it l by accident ' some time after its publication (NICHOLS, Anecdotes, v. 587), Brown Brown and upon and asked Dodsley to let him know the au- thor's name. He published it in the collected edition of Pope's works before the ' Essay on Man.' One line survives â€” And coxcombs vanquish Berkeley by a grin. A poem on ' Liberty/ occasioned by the peace, appeared in 1749. Warburton introduced Brown to his father-in-law, the munificent Halph Allen. Whilst staying at Allen's Brown preached a sermon at Bath against gambling (22 April 1750). It was published with a statement that the public tables were suppressed soon after the sermon was preached. Warburton now advised Brown to carry out Pope's design of an epic poem, ' Brute ; ' and when this was begun suggested an essay upon Shaftesbury's * Characteristics.' The essay, completed under Warburton's eye, appeared in 1751. The second part of this essay is a remarkably clear statement of the utilitarian theory as afterwards expounded by Paley, is highly praised in J. S. Mill's essay u * Bentham.' The book provoked answers from C. Bulkley, a dissenting minister, and an anonymous author, and it reached a fifth edition in 1764. Brown helped Avison in the composition of his essay upon ' Musical Ex- pression,' published in the same year (1751). He showed his versatility by writing two tragedies, ' Barbarossa ' (produced at Drury Lane 17 Dec. 1754) and l Athelstane ' (pro- duced 27 Feb. 1756) (GENEST, iv. 406, 453). The first obtained a considerable success. Oarrick acted in both, and wrote the prologue and epilogue of the first and the epilogue to the second. A line in the first epilogue, ' Let the poor devil eat,' &c., gave great offence to Brown. Neither has much literary value, though ' Athelstane ' was preferred by the critics to its more successful rival. Warbur- ton, Allen, and Hurd lamented that a clergy- man should compromise his dignity by 'making connections with players.' Warburton, how- ever, had introduced Brown to his friend Charles Yorke, and through Yorke's influence his brother, Lord Hardwicke, presented Brown in 1756 to the living of Great Horkes- ley, near Colchester, worth 270/. a year or 200J. clear (NICHOLS, Anecdotes, v. 286). In 1757 appeared Brown's most popular work, 'An Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times.' A seventh edition appeared in 1758, a ' very large impression ' of a second volume, and an ' explanatory de- fence ' in the same year. From the identity of the first and seventh editions of the ' Es- timate ' Hill Burton seems to doubt whether the success was genuine (Life of Hume, ii. 23). There is no doubt, however, of the impression made at the time. ' The inestimable estimate of Brown,' says Cowper (Table-Talk), 'rose like a paper kite and charmed the town.' It is a well-written version of the ordinary com- plaints of luxury and effeminacy which gained popularity from the contemporary fit of na- tional depression. Macaulay refers to it in this respect in his essay on ' Chatham.' In his first volume Brown describes Warburton as a Colossus who ' bestrides the world.' A cool- ness, however, seems to have arisen at this time between the two. Walpole ascribes it to Warburton's jealousy of his friend's success in a letter (to Montagu, 4 May 1578), from which it also appears that Brown was sup- posed to have been mad. Walpole says that he had only seen Brown once, and then { sing- ing the Stabat Mater with the Mingotti behind a harpsichord at a great concert at my Lady Carlisle's ' in ' last Passion week,' a perfor- mance which Walpole regards as inconsistent with Brown's denunciations of the opera. He also asserts that Brown was a profane curser and swearer, that he tried to bully Sir Charles Williams, who had answered the 1 Estimate/ and was supposed to be about to divulge the swearing story, and that he in- sulted Dodsley, who acted as go-between. Brown was clearly an impracticable per- son. He had complimented Pitt and the first Lord Hardwicke in his ' Estimate,' and the failure to obtain patronage induced him, it is said, to resign the living received from Hardwicke's son. In 1760 Warburton says that Brown is ' rarely without a gloom and sullen insolence on his countenance,' sympto- matic perhaps of mental disorder (Letters of an Eminent Prelate, pp. 300, 381). Bishop Osbaldiston, however, presented him to the living of St. Nicholas in Newcastle in 1761. Brown published several other works, which had little success : an ' Additional Dialogue of the Dead, between Pericles and Cosmo, being a sequel to a dialogue of Lord Lyttel- ton's between Pericles and Cosmo,' 1760 (intended to defend Pitt against the supposed insinuations of Lyttelton, who is said to have affronted Brown in society) (NICHOLS, Anec- dotes, ii. 339) ; the l Curse of Saul, a sacred ode ' (set to music and performed as an ora- torio), first prefixed to a 'Dissertation on the Rise, Union, and Power ... of Poetry and Music,' 1763 ; ' History of. the Rise and Progress of Poetry,' &c., 1764 (the substance of the last, omitting music) ; ' Twelve Ser- mons on various Subjects,' 1764 (including those at Carlisle and Bath already noticed) ; ' Thoughts on Civil Liberty, Licentiousness, and Fashion,' 1765, a pamphlet with some re- marks on education noticed by Priestley in his essay on ' The Course of a Liberal Edu- cation ; ' a sermon ' On the Female Character Brown 12 Brown and Education,' preached 16 May 1765, with an appendix upon education ; and l A Letter to the Rev. Dr. Lowth,' &c., 1766, an answer to an imputation made by Lowth in his con- troversy with Warburton upon Brown's sy- cophancy to Warburton. Brown advertised ' Principles of Christian Legislation,' in eight books, the manuscript of which was left to some friends in his will for publication. It never appeared. In 1765 Brown engaged in a curious correspondence, from which long ex- tracts are given in the ' Biographia Britannica.' Dr. Dumaresq had been consulted about the provision of a school system in Russia. A lady mentioned Brown to him as an authority upon such questions. Dumaresq wrote to Brown, and received in reply a paper proposing vague and magnificent plans for the civilisation of Russia. The paper was laid before the em- press, who immediately proposed that Brown should visit St. Petersburg, and upon his con- sent forwarded 1,000/. to the Russian ambas- sador for the expenses of the journey. Brown made preparations to start,bought a post-chaise and other necessaries, and obtained leave of absence as one of the king's chaplains. His health had been shattered by gout and rheu- matism, and the remonstrances of his friends and physicians induced him to abandon the plan of exposing himself to a Russian climate. He accounted for his expenses to the Russian minister, and wrote a long letter (28 Aug. 1766) to the empress, suggesting a scheme for sending young Russians to be educated abroad. He was apparently disappointed and vexed by the failure of the scheme. On 23 Sept. 1766 he committed suicide by cut- ting his throat. A letter from a Mr. Gilpin of Carlisle says that he had been subject to fits of ' frenzy ' for above thirty years, and would have killed himself long before but for the care of friends. \"Walpole's remark, given above, seems to imply that his partial de- rangement was generally known. [Davies's Life of Garrick, i. 206-15 ; Life by Kippis, with original materials in Biog. Brit. ; Letters of an Eminent Prelate ; Taylor's Kecords of my Life, i. 85 ; T. S. Watson's Life of War- burton.] L. S. BROWN, JOHN (1722-1787), of Had- dington, author of the ' Self-interpreting Bible,' was born in 1722 at Carpow, parish of Abernethy, Perthshire. His father was a poor weaver, who could only afford to send him to school for a few * quarters.' During one month of this time he studied Latin. Even at this early period he learnt eagerly, getting up by heart 'Vincent's and Flavel's Cate- chisms, and the Assembly's Larger Cate- chism.' When he was eleven his father died. His mother did not long survive. He him- self was brought so low by ' four fevers on end ' that his recovery was despaired of. During these trials the lad thought much on religious matters. After his recovery, he began to work as a herd-boy, and his contact with a wider and stranger world ' seemed to cause,' he tells us, 'not a little practical apo- stasy from all my former attainments. Even secret prayer was not always regularly per- formed, but I foolishly pleased myself by making up the number one day which had been deficient another.' A new attack of fever in 1741 reawakened his conscience, and on his recovery he ' was providentially deter- mined, during the noontide while the sheep which I herded rested themselves in the fold, to go and hear a sermon, at the distance of tAvo miles, running both to and from it.' During his life as a herd-boy he studied eagerly. He acquired a good knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His difficulties- in regard to the second of those were very great, for he could not for some time get a grammar. Notwithstanding this, he man- aged by the exercise of patient ingenuity to learn the letters on a method he afterwards described in detail (paper of 6 Aug. 1745 quoted in Biography). He scraped together the price of a Greek testament, and a well- known story describes how he procured it. A companion agreed to take charge of his sheep for a little, so setting out at midnight, he reached St. Andrews, twenty-four miles distant, in the morning. The bookseller questioned the shepherd-boy, and one of the university professors happened to hear the conversation. { Boy,' said he, pointing to a passage, ' read this, and you shall have the book for nothing.' Brown read the passage, got the volume, and walked home again with it (Memoir, p. 29 ; Dr. John Brown's Letter to John Cairns, D.D., p. 73). The herd-boy and his learning now became the subject of talk in the place. Some ' se- ceding students ' accounted for the wonder by explaining that Brown had got his know- ledge from Satan. The hypothesis was widely accepted, nor was it till some years had passed away that he was able by his blameless and diligent life to 'live it down.' He after- wards took occasion to note that just when he was * licensed ' his ' primary calumniator' was excommunicated for immoral conduct. Brown now became a travelling ' chapman r or pedlar. When the rebellion of 1745 broke out, he joined the ranks of the government sol- diers. He served throughout the affair, being for some time one of the garrison of Edin- burgh Castle. When the war was over, he again took up his pack for a time, but soon Brown Brown found more congenial occupation as a school- master. He taught at Gairney Bridge, near Kinross, and at the Spittal, Penicuik, near Edinburgh. He began teaching in 1747, known as the year in which the ' breach ' occurred in the secession church, to which he belonged. Two bodies were formed, called the Burghers and the Anti-burghers, of whom the first maintained that it was, and the se- cond that it was not, lawful to take the burgess oath in the Scottish towns (for full account see McKEKEOw's History, chap, vi.) Brown adhered to the more liberal view, and now began to prepare himself for the minis- try. He studied theology and philosophy in connection with the Associate Burgher Synod under Ebenezer Erskine of Stirling, and James Fisher of Glasgow. In 1750 he was licensed to preach the gospel, and next year was unanimously called to the associate con- gregation of Haddington. His congregation was small and poor, but though afterwards invited to be pastor to the Dutch church, New York, he never left it. His ministerial duties were very hard, for during most of the year he delivered three sermons and a lecture every Sunday, whilst visiting and catechising occu- pied many a weekday. Still he found time to do much other work. In 1758 he pub- lished ' An Help for the Ignorant. Being an Essay towards an Easy Explication of the Westminster Confession of Faith and Cate- chism, composed for the young ones of his own congregation.' This ' easy explication ' was a volume of about 400 pages. In it he liad taken occasion to affirm that Christ's righteousness, though in itself infinitely valuable, is only imparted to believers ac- cording to their need, and not so as to render them infinitely righteous. In the following year 'A brief Dissertation concerning the Righteousness of Christ' expounded the same view. He had branded the doctrine he op- posed as 'antinomian and familistic blas- phemy,' but notwithstanding it was defended by various anti-burgher divines, who retorted on him the charges of ' heresy,' 'blasphemy,' and * familism,' accused him of ' gross and palpable misrepresentation,' lamented the 4 poisonous fruit,' and dwelt on the ' glaring absurdity ' of his doctrine (see Doctrine of the Unity and Uniformity of Christ's Surety- righteousness viewed and vindicated, fyc. By Rev. JOHN DALZIEL (Edin. 1760), pp. 72-4). This bitter controversy did not prevent Brown from doing acts of practical kindness to various anti-burgher brethren. He continued to write diligently, and his name became more widely known. In 1768 he was ap- pointed professor in divinity to the Associate Burgher Synod. A great deal of work, but no salary, was attached to this office; the students studied under Brown at Hadding- ton during a session of nine weeks each year (McKEKROw's History, p. 787). In 1778 his best-known work, the ' Self-interpreting Bible,' was published at Edinburgh in two vo- lumes. Its design, he explains in the preface, is to present the labours of the best commenta- tors ' in a manner that might best comport with the ability and leisure of the poorer and labouring part of mankind, and especially to render the oracles of God their own interpre- ter.' Thus the work contains history, chro- nology, geography, summaries, explanatory notes, and reflections â€” in short, everything that the ordinary reader might be supposed to want. It is a library in one volume. Brown is always ready to give what he be- lieves to be the only possible explanation of each verse, and to draw its only possible prac- tical lesson therefrom. The style throughout is clear and vigorous. The book at once ac- quired a popularity which among a large class it has never lost. It has been read widely among the English-speaking nations, as well as in Wales and the Scottish highlands. How well known it and Brown's other works were in Scotland some characteristic lines of Burns bear witness : â€” For now I'm grown sae cursed douce, I pray an' ponder butt the house ; My shins, my lane, I there sit roastin' Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an' Boston. (Letter to James Tait of Glenconner, lines 19-220 His numerous other works strengthened his reputation, but none brought him any profit. One of his publishers, ' of his own good will,' presented him with about 40Â£, but this he lent and lost to another. His salary from his church was for a long time only 40Â£ per annum, and it was never more than 50/. Only a very small sum came to him from other sources. The stern self-denial that was a frequent feature in the early Scottish house- hold enabled him to bring up a large family, and meet all the calls of necessity and duty on this income. ' Notwithstanding my eager desire for books, I chose rather to want them, and much more other things, than run into debt,' he says. At least one-tenth of his small means was set apart for works of charity. Throughout his life Brown was an eager stu- dent, and his attainments were considerable. He knew most of the European and several oriental languages. He was well read in history and divinity ; his acquaintance with the Bible was of the most minute description. Although he says that ' few plays or romances are safely read, as they tickle the imagination, Brown Brown and are apt to infect Avith their defilement/ so that ' even the most pure, as Young, Thomson, Addison, Richardson, bewitch the soul, and are apt to indispose for holy meditation and other religious exercises,' and although he eagerly opposed the relaxation of the penal statutes against Roman catholics, he was, in regard to many things, not at all a narrow- minded man. His creed was to him a mat- ter of such intense conviction, that nothing seemed allowable that tended in any way to oppose it or distract attention from its so- lemn doctrines. His preaching was earnest, simple, and direct, ' as if I had never read a book but the Bible.' His delivery was ' sing- song,' yet 'this in him was singularly melting to serious minds.' A widely current story affirms that David Hume heard him preach, and the ' sceptic ' was so impressed that he said, ' That old man speaks as if the Son of God stood at his elbow.' The anecdote, though undoubtedly mythical, shows the popular impression as to his preaching. Brown's labours finally ruined his health, which during the last years of his life was very poor. He continued his work to very near the end. He died at Haddington on 19 June 1787, and was interred in the church- yard there, where there is a monument to his memory. He was twice married : first to Janet Thomson, Musselburgh, second to Violet Croumbie, Stenton, East Lothian. He had issue by both marriages. Several of his descendants have made themselves names in science and literature. Brown's other works have been divided into the following classes : â€” 1. Of the Holy Scriptures : ' A Dictionary of the Bible' (1769) ; ' A brief Concordance to the Holy Scriptures ' (1783) ; 'The Psalms of David in metre, with Notes' (1775). 2. Of Scripture subjects : ' Sacred Tropo- logy' (1768) ; ' An Evangelical and a Practi- cal View of the Types and Figures of the Old Testament Dispensation ' (1781) ; ' The Har- mony of Scripture Prophecies ' (1784). 3. Sys- tematic divinity : ' A compendious View of Natural and Revealed Religion ' ( 1782 ). 4. Church history : l An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Secession ' (1766) ; ' A general History of the Christian Church/ 2 vols.

Biography : ' The Christian, the Student, and Pastor exemplified in the lives of nine eminent Ministers ' (1781) ; l The Young Christian, or the Pleasantness of Early Piety ' (1782) ; ' Practical Piety exemplified in the lives of thirteen eminent Christians ' (1783). 6. Catechisms : ' Two short Catechisms, mu- tually connected' (1764); 'The Christian Journal' (1765). 7. Sermons: 'Religious Steadfastness recommended ' (1769) ; ' The- fearful Shame and Contempt of those professed Christians who neglect to raise up spiritual Children in Christ ' (1780) ; ' Necessity and Advantage of Prayer in choice of Pastors ' (1783). 8. Miscellaneous pamphlets: 'Let- ters on the Constitution, Government, and Discipline of the Christian Church ' (1767) ; 'The Oracles of Christ and the Abomina- tion of Antichrist compared, a brief View of the Errors, Impieties, and Inhumanities of Popery' (1779); 'The Absurdity and Per- fidy of all authoritative Toleration of gross Heresy, Blasphemy, Idolatry, and Popery in Great Britain' (1780); 'The Re-exhibition of the Testimony vindicated, in opposition to the unfair account of it given by the Rev. Adam Gib ' (1780 â€” Gib was a prominent anti-burgher clergyman who in this year had written 'An Account of the Burgher Re- exhibition of the Secession Testimony ') ; ' Thoughts on the Travelling of the Mail on the Lord's Day' (1785 â€” as to this, see Cox's Lit, of Sabbath Question, ii. 248, Edin. 1865). 9. Posthumous works : ' Select Remains r (1789) ; ' Posthumous Works ' (1797) ; 'Apo- logy for the more frequent Administration of the Lord's Supper r (1804). [Various short lives of Brown are prefixed to several of his works ; the most authentic is the Memoir by his son, the Rev. William Brown, M.D., prefixed to an edition of the Select Re- mains (Edin. 1856). Some additional facts, together with an engraving from a family por- trait, are given in Cooke's edition of Brown's Bible (Glasgow, 1855). Some of the more authentic of the many anecdotes about Brown are collected in Dr. John Brown's Letter to the Rev. J. Cairns, D.D. (2nd ed. Edin. 1861) ; see also McKerrow's History of the Secession Church (Glasgow, 1841).] F. W-T. BROWN, JOHN, M.D. (1735-1788), founder of the Brunonian system of medi- cine, was born at a village in the parish of Buncle, Berwickshire. The father was pro- bably a day-labourer, and he followed the teaching of the seceders. He died early in life, and his widow married another seceder, a weaver by trade. When Brown was twelve or thirteen he gave offence to the seceding community by going once to public worship in the parish church of Dunse, and, refusing to be admonished, he formally left the sect. As he grew up he began to develop a philo- sophical turn, after the manner of Hume, and continued all his life to be somewhat free in his thinking. His quickness induced his father to send him, when five years old, to the parish school of Dunse, then under an unusually good Latinist named Cruickshank, and attended by boys generally Brown's Brown Brown superiors in position. Before lie was ten he was head of the school ; but he was then taken away and put to his stepfather's trade. This made him miserable, and Cruickshaiik soon persuaded the parents to let him have the boy back to continue his schooling free of charge. Brown made himself generally useful in the school, and at thirteen he be- came pupil-teacher. He had fought his way to respect in the school no less by his superior j intelligence than by his physical prowess, j He was a stout thickset boy, with a ruddy I face and a strong voice, and he was among the foremost at wrestling, boxing, and foot- ball. In a note to one of his books he says that he once, when fifteen, walked fifty miles in a day. His memory was prodigious ; one of his old pupils tells of him that on one occasion, after going through two pages of Cicero with the class, he closed the book and repeated the whole passage word for word. The country people found out that he was a prodigy, and it was popularly believed that ' he could raise the devil.' When he was eighteen his master found him a tutorship which proved irksome, and he went to Edinburgh to support himself by private tuition, and to attend the lectures in philosophy and divinity. After several years of Edinburgh he came back to Dunse, and resumed his place as usher in the school. A year after, \"being then twenty-four, he went again to Edinburgh, and applied fruitlessly for a vacant mastership in the high school. He then bethought himself of the medical profession, and obtained leave from Monro, the professor of anatomy, to attend his lec- tures free. The other professors gave him a like privilege, and he continued to attend the medical classes for five years, supporting himself by giving private lessons in the classics during the first year or two, and afterwards by preparing medical students for their examinations. He was in great re- quest among the students for his convivial qualities. Meanwhile Cullen employed him as tutor to his children, and afterwards as a kind of assistant to himself, the precise nature of his duties being a matter of dispute between Cullen's apologists and Brown's biographers. In 1765 he married the daugh- ter of an Edinburgh citizen named Lamond, and set up a boarding-house for students. Cullen encouraged him to look forward to a professor's chair. He took an extra course of dissections for nearly a year, and studied botany in order to qualify himself for a new chair in the American colonies to which Cullen had the presentation. However he remained a private tutor in Edinburgh ; and it became clear after a few years that he was somehow not likely to gain academical promotion. His varied powers were well known, and there can be no question that his technical knowledge of medical subjects was adequate. Unfortunately he had an un- conscious art of putting his respectable col- leagues irretrievably in the wrong. He had some venial faults ; he became involved in debt, and had to compound with his credi- tors ; high feeding gave him the gout at five-and-thirty. His society was mostly composed of admirers, and he took no pains to make interest with men of influence. He put off taking his degree of M.D. for years after his medical course was done. When he sought to graduate in 1779, the Edinburgh degree had become impossible, and he got one at St. Andrews. At an earlier period he might as a matter of course have joined the society for publishing medical essays and observations (afterwards the Royal So- ciety of Edinburgh), but when he resolved to seek admission in 1778, Cullen privately advised him not to try: but he tried and was rejected. The antagonism to him had probably grown up in connection with his influence as a private tutor. Brown had to the last a large following of young men in Edinburgh. In 1776 the students had made him president of their Royal Medical Society, and they made him president again four years later, when the rupture between him and the Erofessors was complete. His divergence *om the teaching of Cullen had probably found expression in his private prelections. He afterwards exposed Cullen's errors in his trenchant criticism, ' Observations on the Present System of Spasm as taught in the University of Edinburgh ' (1787). The first formal indication of Brown's emendations on the basis of Cullen is said to have been given in a draft of his future ' Elementa Medicinae,' which he had written with a view to a vacant chair, and had shown to his patron. Then came his formal ostracism in 1778, and Brown at once took up the cudgels for his own doc- trines. He began a course of public lectures on the practice of physic, in which the errors of all former systems of medicine, and of Cul- len's in particular, were very freely handled. In two years' time he had got ready a tempe- rate exposition of his doctrine, the celebrated 'Elementa Medicinae' (1780). The purity of his Latin style at once insured for him an attentive reading abroad, especially in Italy and Germany ; and the practical good sense of much of Brown's teaching at length ob- tained for it an enormous vogue. That the great majority of diseases were expressions of debility and not of redundant strength, and that consequently the time-honoured practice Brown 16 Brown of indiscriminate lowering was a mistake, was a doctrine that commended itself to the sensible and unprejudiced. The ' Elementa Medicinee ' consists of ' a first or reasoning part,' which proceeds upon a philosophical conception of life and diseased life more fundamental than any that had ever before been framed, a conception which reappears in Erasmus Darwin's ' Zoonomia,' and in Spencer's 'Principles of Biology ' (' Incitatio, potestatum incitantium operis effectus, idonea prosperam ; nimia aut deficiens, adversam valetudinem. Nulla alia corporis humani vivi, rite secusve valentis ; morborum nulla alia origo'). In the second part he takes concrete diseases in systematic order, after the nosological fashion of the time, and ap- plies his doctrine to each. The sound practical truth running through the Brunonian system, that many paradoxical manifestations of morbid action were really evidences of de- bility which called for supporting treatment, has in the end been quietly absorbed among the commonplaces of modern practice. But it was many years before the opposing pre- judices were overcome. So late as 1841 Cullen's biographer appeals triumphantly to 'the intelligent practitioner' on behalf of bloodletting in inflammatory fever (Life of Cullen, ii. 326). Brown carried on the war in Edinburgh six years longer against the professors and the general body of practitioners. Hardly any practice came to him, and the attendance at his public lectures fell away. The needs of a large family and his own improvidence brought him into serious money troubles, and he was at one time lodged in prison for â€¢debt. During his last year in Edinburgh he published 'A Short Account of the Old Method of Cure, and Outlines of the New Doctrine.' He also founded the masonic lodge of the Roman Eagle, for the encourage- ment of Latin scholarship, and attracted to it a number of the best known wits and scholars of the place. In 1786 he removed with his family to London, and established himself in a house in Golden Square. In his domestic circle he had his greatest happiness. He had taught his three eldest girls and his eldest boy Latin, and had carried them some little way in Greek. Among his papers there was found a considerable frag- ment of a Greek grammar, written in Latin with rules in hexameter verse, which he had designed primarily for the use of his children. His cheerfulness never failed him. In Lon- don men of letters came to see him, among others Dr. Samuel Parr; but not many patients. He gave in his house courses of lectures on medicine, which do not appear to have excited much interest among London practitioners or students, although his name was well known among them. An invitation to him from Frederick the Great to settle at the court of Berlin somehow miscarried or was rescinded. Debts again overtook him, and, through a piece of sharp practice, and perhaps treachery, he was obliged for a time to become an inmate of the king's bench prison. One means of extricating himself, closely pressed upon him by a group of greedy speculators, was to give his name to a pill or other nostrum ; but the temptation was resisted. He now wrote more than he had done. He made an English translation of his 'Elementa Medicinse,' writing it in twenty-one days. He contracted with a publisher for 500Z. to produce a treatise on the gout, and he had other literary pro- jects which would occupy him, he said, for ten years to come. His prospects were cer- tainly brightening; he had several families to attend and patients were coming in, when he was struck down by apoplexy, and died on 17 Oct. 1788. He was buried in the churchyard of St. James's, Piccadilly. A portrait of him was engraved by William Blake, from a miniature now in the possession of his grandson, Mr. Ford Madox Brown. He left four sons and four daughters, who were provided for by the generosity of his friends, Dr. Parr among the rest. His eldest son, William Cullen Brown, subsequently studied medicine at Edinburgh, where he was received with much kindness by Dr. Gregory and other professors, and admitted to the lectures without fee. He, like his father, became president of the Royal Me- dical Society, and brought out an edition of his father's works in 3 vols. 8vo, London, 1804, with a biography of the author. A life by Dr. Beddoes of Bristol, with a por- trait, was prefixed to the second edition (2 vols. 1795) of Brown's own En^i;sh ver- sion of his ' Elementa Medicinae.' S 3me 250 pages of vol. ii. of Professor John Thomson's * Life of Cullen ' (1832-59) are devoted to a laboured examination of the Brunonian epi- sode and the Brunonian doctrine, from the Edinburgh professorial point of view. The fortunes of the Brunonian doctrine, after the death of its author, occupy a con- siderable space in the history of medicine. The ' Elementa ' was reprinted at Milan in 1792, and at Hildburgshausen in 1794. The English version was republished at Philadel- phia in 1790 by Dr. Benjamin Rush ; a Ger- man translation of it was made at Frank- furt in 1795, and again in 1798 ; another at Copenhagen (three editions) ; there was also a French translation which was laid before Brown Brown the National Convention and honourably commended ; and one in Italian. A very per- sonal book, i An Inquiry into the State of Medicine on the Principles of Inductive Phi- losophy, &c./ ostensibly by Robert Jones, M.D. (Edin. 1782), but probably by Brown himself, was brought out in Italian by Joseph Frank, at Pavia, in 1795. An earlier ac- count of the doctrines had been published by Rasori, at Pavia, in 1792. An exposition of the system, with the complete Brimonian literature up to date, was published by Gir- tanner, at Gottingen, 2 vols. 1799. As late as 1802, the university of Gottingen was so convulsed by controversy on the merits of the Brimonian system, that contending fac- tions of students in enormous numbers, not unaided by professors, met in combat in the streets on two successive days, and had to be dispersed by a troop of Hanoverian horse. The stimulant treatment of Brown was for- mally recommended for adoption in the various forms of camp sickness in the Aus- trian army, although the rescript was re- called owing to professional opposition. Scott, in his ' Life of Napoleon/ narrates that the Brunonian system was often a subject of inquiry by the First Consul. For some years there were Brunonians and anti-Brunonians all over Europe and in the colonies ; until at length the sound and valuable part of Brown's therapeutic practice passed imper- ceptibly into the common stock of medical maxims. 'The History of the Brunonian System, and the Theory of Stimulation ' was once more written in German by Hirschel in 1846. [Lives by W. C. Brown and Dr. Beddoes as above; Haser's Greschichte der Medicin, ii. 750, 3rd ed. Jena, 1881.] C. C. BROWN, JOHN (d. 1829), miscellaneous writer, was an inhabitant of Bolton in Lan- eashire,isphere during the early part of this century he was engaged in miscellaneous lite- rary work. There he projected his ' History of Great and Little Bolton/ of which seven- teen numbers were published (Manchester, 1824-5). This work begins with an ' Ancient History of Lancashire/ which he maintains was peopled by colonists of a ' German or Gothic' origin, and frequent visits to the west of Europe confirmed him, he says, in this belief (Introduction, pp. 9, 10). He became about this time very intimate with the inventor Samuel Crompton, also a Bolton man, and, laying his l History of Bolton ' aside, drew up Â« The Basis of Mr. Samuel Crompton's Claims to a second Remuneration from Parliament for his Discovery of the Mule Spinning-machine' (1825, reprinted Man- VOL. VII. Chester, 1868). Moving to London, Brown there prepared a memorial on this subject, dated May 1825, addressed to the lords of the treasury, and numerously signed by the in- habitants of Bolton, with a petition to the House of Commons (6 Feb. 1826) on the part of Crompton, which briefly narrates the grounds of his claim (Appendix to Cromp- ton's Life, p. 281). 'There is abundant evidence/ says French, the biographer of Crompton, ' that Brown was indefatigable in his endeavours to procure a favourable consideration of Crompton's case from the government of the day.' He was, however, completely unsuccessful, owing, as he wrote to Crompton, to secret opposition on the part of ' your primitive enemy/ as he called the first Sir Robert Peel. Further efforts were rendered useless by the death of the inventor in June 1827, and Brown did not long sur- vive him. His life in the metropolis was in all ways unsuccessful, and in despair he committed suicide in his London lodgings in 1829. A posthumous work of his of sixty- two pages was published in 1832 at Man- chester. It is entitled ' A Memoir of Robert Blincoe, an orphan boy sent from the work- house of St. Pancras, London, at seven years of age to endure the horrors of a cotton mill.'

BROWN, JOHN (1754-1832), of Whit- burn, Scottish divine, was the eldest son of John Brown of Haddington [see BROWN\", JOHX, 1722-1787], where he was born on 24 July 1754. At fourteen he entered Edin- burgh University. He afterwards studied divinity at the theological hall of his de- nomination, was licensed to preach by the associate presbytery of Edinburgh, 21 May 1776, and was ordained to the charge of the congregation at Whitburn, Linlithgowshire. Here, after a lengthened and laborious minis- try, he died on 10 Feb. 1832. Brown was twice married, and was survived by his se- cond wife and the issue of both marriages. His works were : 1. ' Select Remains of John Brown of Haddington' (1789). 2. < The Evangelical Preacher, a collection of Ser- mons chiefly by English Divines' (Edin. 1802-6). 3. ' Memoirs of the Life and Cha- racter of the late Rev. James Hervey ' (Edin. 1806 ; enlarged editions were afterwards pub- lished). 4. ' A Collection of Religious Letters from Books and Manuscripts ' (Edin. 1813 ; enlarged ed. 1816). 5. ' A Collection of Let- ters from printed Books and Manuscripts, suited to children and youth' (Glasgow, Brown Brown 1815). 6. 'Gospel Truth accurately stated and illustrated ' (Edin. 1817 ; enlarged ed. Glasgow, 1831. This is a work on the ' Mar- row controversy'). 7. 'A brief Account of a Tour in the Highlands of Perthshire/ with a paper entitled ' A Loud Cry from the High- lands' (Edin. 1818). 8. 'Means of doing Good proposed and exemplified in several Letters to a Friend ' (Edin. 1820). 9. ' Me- moirs of private Christians ' (Glasgow, 1821 ?) 10. ' Christian Experience, or the spiritual exercise of eminent Christians in different ages and places stated in their own words' (Edin. 1825). 11. 'Descriptive List of Religious Books in the English Lan- guage, suited for general use' (Edin. 1827). 12. ' Evangelical Beauties of the late Rev. Hugh Binning, with account of his Life' (Edin. 1828). 13. 'Evangelical Beauties of Archbishop Leighton ' (Berwick, 1828). 14. ' Notes, Devotional and Explanatory, on the Translations and Paraphrases in verse of several passages in Scripture ' (Glasgow and Edin. 1831). 15. ' Memoir of Rev. Thomas Bradbury ' (Berwick, 1831). 16. ' Memorials of the Nonconformist Ministers of the seven- teenth century ' (Edin. 1832). Various works of Boston, Hervey, and others were, 'through his instrumentality, chiefly given to the public ' (List in Memoir, p. 168). [Memoir, with portrait, by Eev.

(1778-1848), of Langton, theological writer, was born at Glasgow, licensed by the presbytery of Glas- gow 8 June 1803, ordained minister of Gart- more 1805, translated to Langton, Berwick- shire, 1810, and joined the Free church 1843. He received the degree of D.D. from the university of Glasgow in November 1815. He died 25 June 1848. He was one of the early friends and promoters of evangelical views in the church of Scotland, and a con- tributor to the ' Christian Instructor,' under Dr. Andrew Thomson. Besides works of a slighter kind, he was author of two books which attained considerable fame, viz. ' Vin- dication of Presbyterian Church Government, in reply to the Independents,' Edinburgh, 1805, usually considered the standard treatise on its subject ; and ' The Exclusive Claims of Puseyite Episcopalians to the Christian Ministry indefensible,' Edinburgh 1842.

Thomas Brown, Edinburgh.] W. G. B. BROWN, JOHN, D.D. (1784-1858), of Edinburgh, divine, was the eldest son of John Brown of Whitburn [see BROWN, JOHN, 1754- 1832], where he was born on 12 July 1784. His mother, who was his father's first wife, was Isabella Cranston, a native of Kelso. He received his early education at Whit- burn, and then, with a view to the ministry, entered Edinburgh University, where he studied from March 1797 to April 1800. It is still common for Scottish students to maintain themselves during their ' course ; ' then it was almost universal. Brown, having received his father's blessing along with a guinea, set off for Elie in Fife, where he kept a school for three years. During the summer vacation he attended at Selkirk, under Dr. Lawson, the theological hall of the burgher church (August 1800 to September 1804). At this he was present for from one to two months each year. On 12 Feb. 1805 he was licensed to preach, and nearly a year after (6 Feb. 1806) was ordained to the charge of the burgher congregation at Biggar in Lanarkshire. Brown was diligent both as preacher and pastor, and the congregation prospered under his charge. In 1815 he pub- lished his first work, ' Strictures on Mr. Yates's Vindication of Unitarianism ' (Glas- gow, 1815. The Rev. James Yates was a Glasgow Unitarian divine, then engaged in a controversy with Dr. Wardlaw). Next year he was active in starting a periodical, ''The Christian Repository and Religious Register/ which served as the organ of his church. He edited this till five years later it was merged in the ' Christian Monitor,' which he also con- ducted till 1826. In 1817, in the 'Plans and Publications of Robert Owen of New Lanark,' he attacked the schemes of that thinker. Owen invited him to New Lanark, which is near Biggar. Here they had a con- ference which proved resultless. Brown was now much occupied with schemes for evan- gelising the highlands and other districts in Scotland where spiritual destitution pre- vailed. He himself preached and lectured in various places. His hearers approvingly said ' that they know almost every word, for that minister does not preach grammar.' This seemingly dubious compliment only meant that his manner of speaking was direct and simple. In 1820 the burgher and anti-burgher synods were united. Whilst favouring this union, Brown, with a few friends, attempted to get the severity of certain portions of the Westminster standards relaxed. This at- tempt was at the time unsuccessful, but re- Brown Brown suited in some change when the union men- tioned later on was accomplished. Two years afterwards he was called to Rose Street Church, Edinburgh. After labouring here for seven years, he was translated to Brough- ton Place Church. In 1830 he received the degree of D.D. from Jefferson College, Penn- sylvania; in 1834, when his church revised its scheme of education, he was elected pro- fessor of exegetical theology ; and when in 1847 his denomination by its junction with the relief body formed the United Presbyte- rian Church, he was moved from the junior to the senior hall. During these years Brown wrote several works, and was actively engaged in various agitations and discussions. The chief of these was the 'voluntary controversy' (1835-43), during which he eagerly supported the sepa- ration of church and state. In Edinburgh at that time an impost called the annuity tax was levied for the support of the city minis- ters. This he finally refused to pay, where- upon in 1838 his goods were twice seized and sold. In connection with this he was engaged in a controversy with Robert Hal- dane, who replied to his ' Law of Christ re- specting civil doctrine ' (1839) by a series of letters (see ALEXANDER HALDANE, Memoirs of R. and J. A. Haldane, Lond. 1852 ; and BKOWN'S Remarks on certain statements in it, Edin. 1852). A matter which affected him still more directly was the ' atonement controversy ' (1840-5). It was supposed by some parties in the church that he and his colleague, Dr. Balmer, held unsound views on the nature of the atonement. Finally, in 1845, he was tried by libel before the synod at the instance of two brother divines, Drs. Hay and Marshall. While both sides agreed that only the elect could be saved, Brown was accused of holding that in a certain and, as his opponents affirmed, unscriptural and er- roneous sense, Christ died for all men. The trial, which lasted four days, resulted in his honourable acquittal (Report of Proceedings in Trial by Libel of John Brown, D.D., Edin. 1845). During the years 1848-57 Brown was chiefly engaged in producing a number of exegetical works, which were widely read in this country and America. His jubilee, after a fifty years' ministry, was celebrated in April 1856 (see Rev. J. Brown's Jubilee /Services, Edin. 1856). A considerable sum of money was given to him on this occasion. This, after adding a donation of his own, he presented to the aged and infirm ministers' fund of his church. He died at Edinburgh on 13 Oct. 1858. Brown was twice married, and was survived by issue of both marriages. His eldest son was John Brown, M.D., author of ' Rab ' [q. v.], who in his ' Letter to Dr. Cairns ' has written the most enduring literary memo- rial of his father. Brown was a voluminous writer, but his works are somewhat common- place in thought and expression, and without permanent value ; yet they prove their author to have been a man of great industry and very wide and varied reading. His plan of exposition was ' to make the Bible the basis and the test of the system,' and not l to make the system the principal and, in effect, sole means of the interpretation of the Bible ' (Preface to treatise on Epistle to Galatians quoted in i Memoir,' p. 298) . He followed this method as far as circumstances permitted, and his work undoubtedly gave a healthy impetus to the study of theology in Scotland. For many years he was the most prominent figure among the members of his church. This position was partly due to his learning and ability ; it was still more due to his nobility of character and sweetness of disposition. Brown wrote a large number of sermons, short religious treatises, biographies, and other occasional works. Of these the chief are : ' On the Duty of Pecuniary Contribution to Religious Purposes,' a sermon before the London Missionary Society (1821) ; ' On Religion and the Means of its Attainment' (Edin. 1818) ; ' What ought the Dissenters of Scotland to do at the present crisis ?' (Edin. 1840) ; ' Hints to Students of Divinity ' (Edin. 1841) ; < Comfortable Words for Chris- tian Parents bereaved of little Children' (Edin. 1846) ; < Memorials of Rev. J. Fisher' (Edin. 1849). Brown's most important works were the following treatises : ' Expository Discourses on First Peter' (3 vols. Edin. 1848) ; ' Discourses and Sayings of our Lord Jesus Christ ' (3 vols. Edin. 1850) ; ' An Ex- position of our Lord's Intercessory Prayer ' (Edin. 1850) ; < The Resurrection of Life ' (Edin. 1852) ; ' The Sufferings and Glories of the Messiah ' (Edin. 1853) ; < Expository Discourses on Galatians ' (Edin. 1853); 'Dis- courses suited to the Lord's Supper' (1st ed. 1816, 3rd and enlarged ed. Edin. 1853); ' Parting Counsels, an exposition of the first chapter of second epistle of Peter' (Edin. 1856) ; 'Analytical Exposition of the Epistle of Paul to the Romans ' (Edin. 1857). After Brown's death his * Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews,' edited by David Smith, D.D., was published in 1862 (2 vols. Edin.)
