        "text": "Robert A. Scalapino (from Wikipedia)\n\nRobert Anthony Scalapino (19 October 1919 – 1 November 2011) (Chinese name: 施伯樂) was an American political scientist particularly involved in East Asian studies. He was one of the founders and first chairman of the National Committee on United States – China Relations. Together with his co-author Chong-Sik Lee, he won the 1974 Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for the best book on government, politics, or international affairs as awarded by the American Political Science Association. Scalapino's daughters include the renowned artist Diane Sophia and the poet Leslie Scalapino (1944–2010).[1]\n\nScalapino was born to Anthony and Beulah Stephenson Scalapino in Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1940, he completed his bachelor's degree at Santa Barbara College (now theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara) where he was student body president in his last year.[2] He married Ida Mae Jessen, the next year on 23 August 1941. Over time they had three children: Leslie, Diane, and Lynne.[1] Scalapino received his master's degree in 1943 and his doctorate in 1948, both from Harvard. During World War II he served in U.S. Naval Intelligence from 1943 to 1946, where he studied Japanese.[2][3] He reached the rank of lieutenant junior grade.\n\nHoward Hibbett （b. 1920）began his studies of Japanese as a sophomore at Harvard College 1942 before working as a language specialist for the US Army in 1942-46.\n\nAlso the International House of Japan has published a series of memoir-like essays about many of the people mentioned. I don’t remember if they were written by or about people like Seidensticker, Hibbett and others.\n\nKris\n\nRobert Borgen asked me to forward following message. For some reason, he was unable to send it from his present location (in Korea) to the PMJS server.\n\nFirst, I'd like to thank Ross for starting this discussion, even if so far it consists mostly of listing rather than discussing. I've long thought it remarkable how a vicious war created a core of serious scholars, fond of their former enemy, who would create, from virtually nothing, the academic study of that nation. The phenomenon merits more attention then we have given it.\n\nSecond, I suspect the professional concerns of those on this list have led us to omit scholars whose research was outside our interests. My impression is that, when I was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, all the senior faculty members were military language school alumni. That includes Robert Ward (political science), Richard Beardsley (anthropology, including archaeology), and Roger Hackett (modern history). I believe Donald Shively and John Hall were also in the military. The final three scholars were all children of missionaries who grew up in Japan, but I recall Prof. Hackett telling us that, until he went to military language school, his Japanese lacked an adult vocabulary.\n\nAnd finally, my impression is that most of the American Japan specialists who came out of military language schools went to the Navy school at the University of Colorado, not the army school at my alma mater. I wonder why?\n\nRobert Borgen\n\nP.S. Among English scholars, wasn't Ivan Morris a military language product?"
