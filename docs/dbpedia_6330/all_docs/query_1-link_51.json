        "text": "I've only just watched it, and so I'm still a little unsure of what I've just witnessed. Perhaps, I might benefit from some time to think it over. However, I feel as though it would benefit others if I were to give my opinion whilst I'm still emotionally affected.\n\nFrankly, I'm not really sure what to think about this movie. I mean, what is it's message? Are they attempting to frighten parents into thinking that alternative diets and lifestyles are some sort of cult that is after their children, or what?\n\nI'll admit that I could be a bit biased since I've been living a wholly plant-based lifestyle for over 20 years. I'm also a little offended by the suggestion that there could be anything wrong with it. A properly planned and diverse diet which provides adequate calories and nutrition shouldn't be lumped together with eating disorders. In fact, that's not exactly what is being depicted in the film, since they aren't properly following such a diet. However, I fear that some people might not see things that way, and this film will only serve to arouse latent prejudices.\n\nPersonal feelings on the subject matter aside, I felt as though their acting was quite good. In fact, every single person in this film gave a phenomenal performance. The set design and costumes were also quite good. It was all very believable, and immersive. It managed to keep me engaged despite the slow pacing.\n\nAlso, I felt myself becoming emotionally endeared to the characters. I couldn't help but care for their wellbeing, and wish for them to succeed. In fact, I was really looking forward to seeing where that success was leading to. Unfortunately, I can't tell you much lest it spoil the ending for you. However, I really liked the ending, and applaud them for not giving into the pressure to please their audience with much closure.\n\nI just hope I'm not missing the entire point, because I'd feel really stupid if I did. However, I honestly can't say whether I think there's much of a point to this movie, at all. It was an enjoyable ride, for me. I most certainly enjoyed the emotional journey. Indeed, I highly recommend it. However, I would caution that it's one that you'll probably want to save for when you're just really in the mood for a very gradual and thought-provoking ride with very few thrills along the way.\n\nHonestly, the fact that this is supposed to be satire isn't lost on me. I simply felt it could've been better if it weren't striving so hard to be entirely dead pan. The payoff just wasn't in it. Another reviewer summarized it as poorly executed with no takeaway, and I'm afraid I have to agree. Although, I feel as though it manages to remain a profoundly engaging and well-made movie in spite of its flaws."
