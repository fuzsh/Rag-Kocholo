        "text": "In 1923, almost two decades before the formation of its Second World War Special Duties (SD) squadrons, the RAF created a 'special force' of airmen who conducted highly unorthodox small-scale operations. Like all Special Forces operations, the tactical-level actions by these airmen generated operational level and strategic effects in uncertainb, often hostile, and politically sensitive regions. Between the World Wars, these special airmen, the RAF Special Service Officers, integrated air, civil, and social actions to ensure peace and stability on the frontiers of the empire and, in the process, helped to preserve the independence of the Royal Air Force.\n\nSeventy-five years after the Battle of Britain, the conventional wisdom remains that the Battle was won by the innovation of the ‘Dowding system’, which integrated radar and eight-gun fighters, and the skill and courage of the RAF's fighter pilots. This article examines the design of the London Air Defence Area in 1917-18, the formation of the Home Defence Air Force in 1922-23 and the reorientation of Britain’s air defences to face Germany in 1934 to demonstrate that Britain continuously developed strategic air defence from 1922 to 1940 because of the alignment of both political imperative, defence strategy and the RAF's institutional air defence expertise. While successive Chiefs of the Air Staff favoured strategic bombing, the RAF, formed in 1918 to prevent German raids on London, had many air defence experts and advocates. Therefore, while strategic bombing was largely unproven and its impact exaggerated, air defence was based on lessons from the First World War, and increasingly on science, operational research and operational evaluation. Furthermore successive British governments, not just Chamberlain's, pursued a deliberate defensive strategy, recognising Britain’s strategic vulnerability to the bomber and public anxiety, while seeking to use Britain’s technical, industrial and air strength in a long war and avoiding a bloody continental commitment. This combination ensured victory in the Battle of Britain but also contributed to the Fall of France, without which the Battle of Britain would not have been fought.\n\n\"The failure of Operation Jubilee, the raid on Dieppe, has partially been attributed to the failure of the RAF to provide the bomber support needed to support the landings. This fallacious argument, based on hindsight and a lack of understanding of the RAF’s capabilities at this point in the war, requires revision. This article examines the doctrinal and operational context of the RAF forces involved in Jubilee. Prewar combined operations doctrine stated that the key role for air power was the maintenance of air superiority. The absence of heavy bombers at Dieppe did not doom the operation. The RAF contributed significantly to the operation by seeking to battle the Luftwaffe in the manner that it did during Jubilee, and as such, it provided the most appropriate protection that it could for the assault forces.\"\n\nThe German invasion of Crete in 1941 and subsequent loss of the airfield at Maleme led, almost immediately, to the acceptance of a narrative that suggested significant RAF failure. Criticism, reinforced by the New Zealand official history, bemoaned the lack of fighter aircraft cover and questioned the fighting prowess of RAF ground crew. This article examines the New Zealand commanders’ errors of judgment, which resulted in inappropriate positioning of their soldiers to face the main thrust of the German attack, and argues that RAF airmen became convenient scapegoats for the failings of others. Further, Winston Churchill’s motives in questioning the ability and willingness of airmen to defend airbases are analysed, as is the ensuing political maelstrom, which led to knee jerk reactions and unnecessary reorganisation of RAF ground defence training.\n\nThe ever-expanding Lawrence literature overlooks the link between his concept of warfare and subsequent choice of the RAF for enlistment. Lawrence's fame stemmed from the cultural difference between Romantic heroism in the desert and the industrial warfare on the Western Front. Yet pare away the myth and enigma of 'Lawrence of Arabia' using the official archives and one finds a proponent of air power and a strikingly modern way in warfare, using machines rather than men, and combining aeroplanes and armoured cars with Arab regulars and irregulars. The experience resulted in Lawrence's subsequent postwar support of air power for colonial control in Iraq and probably influenced his choice of Service for enlistment.\n\nThis article investigates the impact of the Battle of France, 1940 on the British Army's subsequent investigations in the fighting impacted on the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the development of tactical air power in Britain. The investigations by the British Army placed the RAF in a difficult position with regards the provision of air support in Britain. This investigation was severely flawed from the outset with its being chaired by a senior officer who was well known to have a hatred of the RAF and joint-service solutions and blamed the failure of the British Expeditionary Force on a lack of air support from the RAF. It fundamentally misread German tactical and operational doctrine, particularly the application of air power. It will highlight the position of the RAF after the Battle of France and the discussions between the Air Ministry and War Office over the creation of an Army Co-operation Command. Through analysing how Army Co-operation Command was created by the RAF, the RAF's attitude towards tactical air support will be made clear. Army Co-operation Command was created to appear to be a solution to the problem of RAF-Army relations on the surface but as the Army began to work with Army Co-operation Command they realised it had been created to achieve very little in practice.\n\nThis article investigates the role played by the Royal Air Force's Army Cooperation Command in the development of tactical air power thinking in Britain during the Second World War and how far it was able to demonstrate to the army the impact of tactical air power at the operational level. In this it was relatively successful. Army Cooperation Command demonstrated this to the lower-level formations of the army through training exercises. They were unable to convince senior commanders such as General Sir Alan Brooke whose thoughts on tactical air power centred on close air support and resolving the tactical-level problems ground forces faced when in close contact with the enemy.\n\nThe paper seeks to explain the limited options available to Air Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory when planning the Royal Air Force portion of the combined operation raid on Dieppe in 1942. It proposes that a number of constraining influences, some self-imposed, reduced the air support options, so that only an air umbrella over the attacking forces could be provided. It argues that these influences were a consequence of the RAF’s cultural and conceptual environment, which perpetuated Trenchardian notions of offensive spirit in RAF doctrine, a naïve willingness to belief pilots kill claims and a refusal to consider options to extend the range of its fighter aircraft. The paper rejects claims that the raf’s effort at Dieppe was the natural evolution of combined operations doctrine and demonstrates that preemptive bombing of Dieppe was politically unacceptable."
