She later eloped with an older man, Captain Bowen, and travelled with him to St Domingo disguised as a footboy named John Taylor. Talbot retained her male attire in and was a drummer boy with the army in Flanders (1792 â 1793), where she took an active part in the capture of the city of Valenciennes. She later deserted the army and worked as a cabin boy in the navy, and was later wounded in battle (1794).\n\nAfter spending two years in a French prison disguised as a man, she was released, her true sex being discovered in England when she was seized by a press gang. Due her having been wounded in action Talbot was granted a small pension by the Crown. She later worked as a domestic servant in London in the household of the publisher Robert Kirkby who published an account of her life in his own Wonderful Museum(1804) and after her early death he then published her own narrative of her adventures as The Life and Surprising Adventures of Mary Anne Talbot (1809).\n\nTalbot, Dame Meriel Lucy Chetwynd â (1866 â 1956)\n\nBritish civil servant and womenâs welfare reformer\n\nMeriel Talbot was born (June 16, 1866) in Westminster, London, the third daughter of hon.

Her father was the illegitimate son of Ramiro I, King of Aragon (1035 â 1063). Talesa was married (before 1085) to Gaston IV, Vicomte de Bearn in Navarre, whose father desired a closer link with the ruling houses of Aragon and Navarre.\n\nThe Vicomtesse ruled Bearn as regent during her husbandâs absence on crusade in Palestine (1096 â 1101). Talesa inherited the vicomte of Montaneres which included the pays of Montaner and some estates in Riviere Basse in Bearn, which were then incorporated into the familial estates of the Bearn family. Talesa founded several religious houses which fact is attested by surviving charters including one dated to 1136 which recorded a grant of estates made to the Abbey of Saint-Jean de Sorde by vicecomitissa Bearnensi â¦ Atelesa. After her husband was killed in battle near Valencia, Talesa ruled Bearn as regent for their son Centule VI (1131 â 1134). When he was killed at the battle of Braga a few years afterwards (1134) Talesa then ruled as regent for his successor Pierre II (the son of her daughter) who was a child.\n\nTalesa supported Ramiro II of Aragon against the claim of his kinsman Alfonso VII of Leon. When this dynastic altercation was finally decided in favour of Ramiroâs son-in-law Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, Raymond wished to restore pleasant relations with Bearn and made a grant of the estates of Huesca and Bespen to Condesa Talesa. She was still living (Nov, 1155) when as Talesa vicecomitissa she granted property to her servant. Of her daughters Guiscarde de Bearn (died after 1154) became the wife of Pierre, Vicomte de Gavaret and left issue, whilst her unnamed sister was married to Bernard Aiz II, Seigneur dâAlbret (died c1164) and left issue.\n\nTalida (Talisdis) â (fl. c450 AD)\n\nGraeco-Roman Christian abbess and ascetic\n\nKnown as âAmma Talidaâ (Mother Talida), she became abbess of Antinois in the Thebaid region of Egypt.

Her only child, Louis Charles, Comte dâHostun predeceased her without issue (1739).

Blonde haired and angelically beautiful, with a perfect figure, Catherine was married firstly (1777) at Chandernagore, to George Francis Grand (c1745 â 1820), a gentleman employed by the British East India Company. The couple then settled in Calcutta where Madame Grandâs beauty attracted much attention. There she became entangled in an embarrassing scandal connecting her with Philip Francis (later Sir) (1740 â 1818), then a clerk in the war office. No criminal association was proved but Catherine was forced to leave her husbandâs house and return to her parents. Francis followed her and persuaded her to live with him as his mistress, which she did until 1781, when she went to Europe.\n\nIn England she resided with Thomas Lewin (1753 â 1837) of the Madras Civil Service as his mistress. The couple travelled to Paris where Catherine had her portrait painted by Madame Vigee-Lebrun. When they parted Lewin gave her a generous cash settlement. She then resided under the protection of various aristocrats until the horrors of the Revolution forced her to flee from Paris (1792). She arrived in Dover with her maid and little cash, though an admirer returned to France and gallantly recovered her fortune which had been hurriedly left behind. When she later returned to France, she was accompanied by the Genoese diplomat, Cristoforo Spinola. Madame Grand became the mistress (1797) of the former Bourbon minister, Charles Maurice, Prince de Talleyrand (1754 â 1838). Her marriage with Grand was annulled (1798) and they resided openly together. Napoleon later forced Talleyrand to regularize their relationship, which forced him to marry her (1802). There were no children. Despite her great beauty, which was universally admired, and her unwavering good-humour, the princesse was also profoundly simple and uneducated, and her stupidity became a legend in her own lifetime.\n\nThe princesse was later involved in a lengthy liasion (1808 â 1828) with the Spanish grandee, the Duque de San Carlos, but there remains no evidence of her husbandâs resentment. During her later years Catherine developed an unseemly arrogance which ill-became her, and led to both public and private mockery of her behaviour. This became an increasing source of embarassment to her husband. The couple travelled to Vienna in 1814, at which time the Comtesse de Boigne observed, â The remains of her great beauty still adorned her stupidity with a certain amount of dignity.â Finally the Prince de Talleyrand installed his niece, Dorothea, Duchesse de Dino as his official hostess in Paris, and Princesse Catherine was exiled to her estate at Pont-de-Sains, which had been settled on her at the time of her marriage. There she was ordered to remain, under threat of her allowance being stopped. She appealed to her husband through the Duke of Wellington, but this appeal fell on deaf ears. She never saw her husband again. During her later years she entertained the poet Thomas Moore and the writer Viennot at her Paris house in the Rue de Bourbon. Princesse de Talleyrand died (Dec 10, 1835) aged seventy-three, and was interred within the cemetery of Montparnasse. Her husband had remained absent from both her deathbed and her funeral.\n\nTallien, Therese de Cabarrus â (1773 â 1835)\n\nFrench adventuress and revolutionary political figure\n\nTherese de Cabarrus was born (July 31, 1773) at Caranbanchel Alto, near Madrid, Spain, the daughter of a Spanish banker, Francesco, Conde de Cabarrus (1752 â 1810), minister of finance under King Carlos IV of Spain. Therese was married firstly (1789) to the Bourbon peer, Jean, Marquis de Fontenay. With the outbreak of the Revolution the couple fled to Bordeaux but became seperated. Her husband emigrated but Therese remained in Paris and reverted to her maiden name, obtaining a divorce (1791).\n\nDuring the Terror instigated by Maximilien Robespierre, Therese was forced to go into hiding in Bordeaux. Arrested as the wife of an Ã©migrÃ©, she became the mistress of Jean Lambert Tallien (1767 â 1820), and was able to obtain through him the release of many innocent prisoners. She executed strong influences over Tallien in the politics of the National Convention.\n\nHowever Therese was then arrested by Robespierre and imprisoned in La Force and then at Carmes, where she met Josephine de Beauharnais, the future empress. She assisted with the rising against Robespierre and was released from prison after which she was publicly acclaimed a heroine as âNotre Dame de Thermidorâ (1795). She later became the mistress of Paul Barras and resided with him at the Luxembourg Palace. Her beauty attracted much attention and the Duchesse dâAbrantes compared her with the Capitoline Venus, noting âBut she was even more beautiful than Phidiasâstatue, for she possessed the same purity of feature, the same perfection of arms, hands, and feet, with the noted advantage of being alive. The outward form was the mirror of her soul, the reflection of her finest quality â kindness.â\n\nTherese later married Tallien but the marriage ended in divorce (1802) after which she established her own popular salon in Paris. The emperor Napoleon disliked her, possibly because she rejected his advances, and forbade her attendance at the Imperial court, once furiously upbraiding the Empress Josephine for receiving her during his abscence. Therese later remarried to Francois Philippe Joseph de Riquet (1771 â 1842), Comte de Caraman (1805) and later the Prince de Chimay, through whom she left many descendants.\n\nTallone, Gisele Marie MadeleineÂ Â Â see Â Â Pascal, Gisele\n\nTalmadge, Constance â (1898 â 1973)\n\nAmerican film star and commedienne\n\nConstance Talmadge was born (April 19, 1898) in Brooklyn, New York.
