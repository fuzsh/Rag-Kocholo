        "text": "The Pilgrims Society Membership\n\nThe Journal of History Fall 2011\n\nBelow, you will see names of members of a nefarious organization called The Pilgrims Society sometimes referred to as just The Pilgrims. Here are who some of our enemies are. The article is at http://silverstealers.net/tss.html\n\nThe Pilgrims Society was established in 1902 in the UK, and 6 months later in 1903 in the USA and continues today. I initially published an article in 2009 on this at http://www.truedemocracy.net/hj31/37.html\n\nThese elite’s dates of birth and death (as applicable) are just to the left of their name in this. If there is no second date listed, then this person is alive. One of them said that silver is for war.\n\nAccording to Charles Savoie, who has been performing research on this organisation his entire adult life, these people are determined to achieve the One World Government, i.e. Dark Ages.\n\nMembers whose names are in red are new, who I have found in this research. You’ll see names you’ll instantly recognize. Additionally, the British Broadcasting Corporation is affiliated with The Pilgrims Society. See on page 141 of http://silverstealers.net/tss.pdf\n\nAlso National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution are both Pilgrim Society run organisations. See http://www.silver-investor.com/charlessavoie/cs_may05_pilgrims.htm\n\nHere is another link that has last names of members some of whom are not in my list:\n\nhttp://vaticannewworldorder.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/pilgrim-society-hidden-structure-of-new.html It also has the true definition of the G in the Masonic Temple organisation.\n\nQuote: “Hey small folks! Do as I say not as I do! Don’t buy gold or farmland, stay in federal reserve dollars so we can make you poor! Hey Germany—no gold for you! Trust us, we know monetary science and all you know is bratwurst & beer! I was underling to a Pilgrims member 40 years ago. Am I a member now? He probably is Richard W.
