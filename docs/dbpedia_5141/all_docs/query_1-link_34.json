        "text": "What is new in the management of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGreenhall, George H.B.; Salama, Alan D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) results from severe crescentic damage to glomeruli and leads to irreversible kidney failure if not diagnosed and managed in a timely fashion. Traditional treatment has relied on glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, with additional plasmapheresis for certain conditions. Here we describe updates in the management of RPGN, according to the underlying renal pathology. However, there remains a paucity of trials that have enrolled patients with more advanced renal disease, dialysis dependence or with RPGN, and we are therefore still reliant on extrapolation of data from studies of patients with a less severe form of disease. In addition, reporting bias results in publication of cases or cohorts showing benefit for newer agents in advanced disease or RPGN, but it remains unclear how many unsuccessful outcomes in these circumstances take place. Since clinical trials specifically in RPGN are unlikely, use of biologic registries or combination of sufficient sized cohort series may provide indications of benefit outside of a clinical trial setting and should be encouraged, in order to provide some evidence for the efficacy of therapeutic regimens in RPGN and advanced renal disease.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in a culture of the abscess material. He was treated with anti-MRSA antibiotics and the MRSA infection improved. Four weeks after the onset of MRSA infection, he developed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with nephrotic syndrome (NS). A renal biopsy showed endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with IgA-predominant glomerular deposition. These clinicopathological findings were consistent with those in glomerulonephritis following MRSA infection (post-MRSA infection glomerulonephritis). The level of serum creatinine increased to 6.3 mg/dl, 7 weeks after the onset of RPGN. At that time, the eradication of MRSA infection was considered. He was given middle-dose steroid therapy. Thereafter, his RPGN with NS improved. MRSA infection did not recur. If the disease activity of post-MRSA infection glomerulonephritis persists after the disappearance of MRSA infection, the application of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may be useful.\n\nThe Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Promotes Glomerular Injury and Renal Failure in Rapidly Progressive Crescentic Glomerulonephritis; the Identification of Possible Therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBollÃ©e, Guillaume; Flamant, Martin; Schordan, Sandra; Fligny, CÃ©cile; Rumpel, Elisabeth; Milon, Marine; Schordan, Eric; Sabaa, Nathalie; Vandermeersch, Sophie; Galaup, Ariane; Rodenas, Anita; Casal, Ibrahim; Sunnarborg, Susan W; Salant, David J; Kopp, Jeffrey B.; Threadgill, David W; Quaggin, Susan E; Dussaule, Jean-Claude; Germain, StÃ©phane; Mesnard, Laurent; Endlich, Karlhans; Boucheix, Claude; Belenfant, Xavier; Callard, Patrice; Endlich, Nicole; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical a morphological expression of severe glomerular injury. Glomerular injury manifests as a proliferative histological pattern (âcrescentsâ) with accumulation of T cells and macrophages, and proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells. We show de novo induction of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in intrinsic glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) from both mice and humans with RPGN. HB-EGF induction increases phosphorylation of the EGFR/ErbB1 receptor in mice with RPGN. In HB-EGF-deficient mice, EGFR activation in glomeruli is absent and the course of RPGN is improved. Autocrine HB-EGF induces a phenotypic switch in podocytes in vitro. Conditional deletion of the Egfr gene from podocytes of mice alleviates the severity of RPGN. Pharmacological blockade of EGFR also improves the course of RPGN, even when started 4 days after the induction of experimental RPGN. This suggests that targeting the HB-EGF/EGFR pathway could also be beneficial for treatment of human RPGN.

SCG/Kj mice spontaneously develop RPGN-like symptoms, characteristic of crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis, associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). We evaluated the \"ameliorative\", not prophylactic, effects of immunosuppressive agents, deoxyspergualin (DSG), cyclophosphamide (CYC) and prednisolone (PDN), on RPGN in these mice. DSG at intraperitoneal doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, CYC at an oral dose of 12 mg/kg, or PDN at an intraperitoneal dose of 120 mg/kg was administered once a day for 21 days to female mice \"at the onset of hematuria\". A set of control SCG/Kj mice received only saline injections. DSG and CYC significantly prolonged survival, improved the proteinuria, hematuria and hyperuremia, and decreased the serum level of myeloperoxidase-ANCA. Moreover, DSG significantly suppressed the formation of crescents in glomeruli. PDN failed to affect any of the parameters. DSG might be useful for inducing remission in crescentic glomerulonephritis involved in RPGN.\n\nNK026680, a novel suppressant of dendritic cell function, prevents the development of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in SCG/Kj mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaiga, Kan; Tokunaka, Kazuhiro; Ichimura, Eiji; Toyoda, Eriko; Abe, Fuminori; Yoshida, Minako; Furukawa, Hiroshi; Nose, Masato; Ono, Masao\n\n2006-11-01\n\nNK026680 is a newly identified type of immunosuppressive agent that inhibits dendritic cell (DC) functions and consequently reduces the mortality of mice with experimental acute graft-versus-host disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate NK026680 suppression of DC functions in preventing development of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) in SCG/Kj mice. Oral administration of NK026680 to SCG/Kj mice began when mice were 8-10 weeks old, before the onset of disease, and continued for 56 days. The efficacy of NK026680 was evaluated using the mortality of mice, the results of urinalysis, histopathologic evaluation for glomerular injury, and immunofluorescence staining for the detection of immune complex (IC) deposition in glomeruli, and by assessing lymphadenopathy and measuring autoantibody titers. Oral administration of NK026680 at a dosage of 25 mg/kg once daily or 50 mg/kg once daily significantly suppressed 1) spontaneous mortality, 2) proteinuria and hematuria, 3) blood urea nitrogen levels, 4) glomerular damage characterized histopathologically, 5) IC deposition in glomeruli, 6) the development of pANCA and anti-DNA antibodies, and 7) lymphadenopathy. The newly identified DC inhibitor, NK026680, prevented the onset of RPGN, autoantibody production, and lymphadenopathy in SCG/Kj mice, suggesting a crucial role for DC function in these autoimmune phenotypes. NK026680 may be a potent immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of ANCA-associated renovascular disorders.\n\n[Glomerulonephritis and vasculitis as causes of arterial hypertension].\n\nPubMed\n\nEicken, Sibylle; Gugger, Mathias; Marti, Hans-Peter\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe various types of glomerulonephritis, including many forms of vasculitis, are responsible for about 15% of cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Arterial hypertension represents a frequent finding in patients suffering from glomerulonephritis or vasculitis and hypertension also serves as an indicator for these severe types of diseases. In addition, there are symptoms and signs like hematuria, proteinuria and renal failure. Especially, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) constitutes a medical emergency and must not be missed by treating physicians. This disease can either occur limited to the kidneys or in the context of a systemic inflammatory disorder, like a vasculitis. If left untreated, RPGN can lead to a necrotizing destruction of glomeruli causing irreversible kidney damage within several months or even weeks. With respect to the immunologically caused vasculitis, there are - depending upon the severity and type of organ involved - many clinical warning signs to be recognized, such as arterial hypertension, hemoptysis, arthalgias, muscle pain, palpable purpura, hematuria, proteinuria and renal failure. In addition, constitutional signs, such as fever and loss of body weight may occur concurrently. Investigations of glomerulonephritis or vasculitis must contain a careful and complete examination of family history and medications used by the respective patient. Thereafter, a thorough clinical examination must follow, including skin, joints and measurement of arterial blood pressure. In addition, a spectrum of laboratory analyses is required in blood, such as full blood screen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, creatinine, urea and glucose, and in urine, including urinalysis looking for hematuria, red cell casts and proteinuria. Importantly, proteinuria needs to be quantified by the utilization of a random urine sample. Proteinuria > 3g/d is diagnostic for a glomerular damage. These basic tests are usually followed by more specialized analyses\n\nGlomerulonephritis\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... glomerulonephritis; Glomerulonephritis - crescentic; Crescentic glomerulonephritis; Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis Images Kidney anatomy References Appel GB, Radhakrishnan J, D'Agati V.

The aim of this study was to describe the outcome of our patients with severe post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. This retrospective study was conducted in the department of pediatrics in Charles-Nicolle Hospital during a period of 13Â years (1997-2009). Twenty-seven children were identified. The mean age was 8.7Â years. All patients presented renal failure at presentation. The mean serum creatinine at presentation was 376.9Â Î¼mol/L. Six patients presented nephrotic syndrome. Twenty-six children had renal biopsies. Renal biopsies showed crescents in 24Â cases. Eighteen children received pulse dose of corticosteroids (66.6%) and 6Â children (22%) received pulse dose of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Eleven patients required dialysis. At last follow-up, 22Â patients (81.5%) had normal kidney function, 2Â had renal dysfunction and 3Â reached end stage renal disease. The only significant determinant for renal survival was the supportive dialysis (P=0.015). Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is uncommon. There have been significant advancements in supportive, as well as specific therapy, but the outcome continues to be poor. Copyright Â© 2015 Association SociÃ©tÃ© de nÃ©phrologie.

RPG can be caused by primary glomerular disease or can be part of a systemic autoimmune disorder. All RPG have a similar pathophysiology (proliferation of cells in Bowman's capsule and formation of crescents) and clinical evolution (rapidly progressive kidney failure with proteinuria and an active urine sediment). Immunosuppressive therapy and sometimes plasma exchanges are required. Overall- and kidney survival are closely linked to the blood creatinine level at presentation, the percentage of damaged glomeruli, and to the underlying cause. RPG is therefore a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency that needs quick referral to a nephrologist.\n\nCorrelation of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentrations with crescent formation and myeloperoxidase-specific anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer in SCG/Kj mice by treatment with anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody or mizoribine.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagao, Tomokazu; Kusunoki, Reina; Iwamura, Chiaki; Kobayashi, Shigeto; Yumura, Wako; Kameoka, Yosuke; Nakayama, Toshinori; Suzuki, Kazuo\n\n2013-09-01\n\nMyeloperoxidase-specific anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) is associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and glomerular crescent formation. Pathogenic factors in RPGN were analyzed by using SCG/Kj mice, which spontaneously develop MPO-ANCA-associated RPGN. The serum concentration of soluble IL-6R was determined by using ELISA and those of another 23 cytokines and chemokines by Bio-Plex analysis. Sections of frozen kidney tissue were examined by fluorescence microscopy and the CD3(+) B220(+) T cell subset in the spleen determined by a flow cytometry. Concentrations of IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were significantly correlated with the percentages of crescent formation. Anti-IL-6R antibody, which has been effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, was administered to SCG/Kj mice to elucidate the role of IL-6 in the development of RPGN. MPO-ANCA titers decreased after administration of anti-IL-6R antibody, but not titers of mizoribine, which is effective in Kawasaki disease model mice. These results suggest that IL-6-mediated signaling is involved in the production of MPO-ANCA.

Recently developed non-steroidal MRAs have distinct characteristics suggesting that they may be superior to steroidal MRAs. Therefore, we explored the benefits of a non-steroidal MRA in a model of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Accelerated anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis was induced in groups of C57BL/6J mice which received no treatment, vehicle or a non-steroidal MRA (BR-4628, 5mg/kg/bid) from day 0 until being killed on day 15 of disease. Mice were examined for renal injury. Mice with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis which received no treatment or vehicle developed similar disease with severe albuminuria, impaired renal function, glomerular tuft damage and crescents in 40% of glomeruli. In comparison, mice which received BR-4628 displayed similar albuminuria, but had improved renal function, reduced severity of glomerular tuft lesions and a 50% reduction in crescents. The protection seen in BR-4628 treated mice was associated with a marked reduction in glomerular macrophages and T-cells and reduced kidney gene expression of proinflammatory (CCL2, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³) and profibrotic molecules (collagen I, fibronectin). In addition, treatment with BR-4626 did not cause hyperkalaemia or increase urine Na+/K+ excretion (a marker of tubular dysfunction). The non-steroidal MRA (BR-4628) provided substantial suppression of mouse crescentic glomerulonephritis without causing tubular dysfunction. This finding warrants further investigation of non-steroidal MRAs as a therapy for inflammatory kidney diseases.\n\nAdenosine A2A Receptor Activation and Macrophage-mediated Experimental Glomerulonephritis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGarcia, Gabriela E.; Truong, Luan D.; Li, Ping; Zhang, Ping; Du, Jie; Chen, Jiang-Fan; Feng, Lili\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn immune-induced inflammation, leukocytes are key mediators of tissue damage. Since A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR) are endogenous suppressors of inflammation, we examined cellular and molecular mechanisms of kidney damage to determine whether selective activation of A2AR will suppress inflammation in a rat model of glomerulonephritis. Activation of A2AR reduced the degree of kidney injury in both the acute inflammatory phase and the progressive phase of glomerulonephritis. This protection against acute and chronic inflammation was associated with suppression of the glomerular expression of the MDC/CCL22 chemokine and down-regulation of MIP-1Î±/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1Î²/CCL4, and MCP-1/CCL2 chemokines. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, also increased. The mechanism for these anti-inflammatory responses to the A2AR agonist was suppression of macrophages function. A2AR expression was increased in macrophages, macrophage-derived chemokines were reduced in response to the A2AR agonist, and chemokines not expressed in macrophages did not respond to A2AR activation. Thus, activation of the A2AR on macrophages inhibits immune-associated inflammation. In glomerulonephritis, A2AR activation modulates inflammation and tissue damage even in the progressive phase of glomerulonephritis. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of A2AR could be developed into a novel treatment for glomerulonephritis and other macrophage-related inflammatory diseases. PMID:17898087\n\nProliferative glomerulonephritis with acute renal failure-a rare manifestation in seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDutta, P K; Khan, I H\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA 55 years old lady with advanced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presented with severe acute renal failure with significant proteinuria preceded by fever for 14 days. She had no history of taking drugs usually responsible for glomerulonephritis, neither had she any clinico-biochemical evidence of peri-infectious glomerulonephritis. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) was excluded by absence of eosinophilia and eosinophils in urine. Renal biopsy reveled absence of amyloidosis and showed Focal segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis (FSGN). Patient was successfully managed with methyl-prednisolone followed by steroid and immunosuppressive and patient came over renal failure. So FSGN should be considered as one of the causes of acute renal failure in a patient with seronegative RA which may respond to immune-therapy like rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\n\nUrinary cystatin C as a renal biomarker and its immunohistochemical localization in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nTogashi, Yuko; Imura, Naoko; Miyamoto, Yohei\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe usefulness of urinary cystatin C for the early detection of renal damage in anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis rats was investigated and compared to other biomarkers (Î²2-microglobulin, calbindin, clusterin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), alpha-glutathione S-transferase (GST-Î±), mu-glutathione S-transferase (GST-Î¼), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), osteopontin, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). Urinary levels of cystatin C increased in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis rats, whereas the conventional markers, plasma creatinine and UN did not, demonstrating its usefulness for the early detection of renal damage associated with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. As well as cystatin C, urinary Î²2-microglobulin, clusterin, GST-Î±, GST-Î¼, KIM-1, and NGAL also had the potential to detect renal damage associated with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical localization of cystatin C in the kidney was examined. Cystatin C expression was mainly observed in the proximal renal tubules in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis rats, and its expression barely changed with the progression of glomerulonephritis. Cystatin C expression was also observed in the tubular lumen of the cortex and medulla when glomerulonephritis was marked, which was considered to be characteristic of renal damage. In conclusion, urinary cystatin C, Î²2-microglobulin, clusterin, GST-Î±, GST-Î¼, KIM-1, and NGAL could be useful biomarkers of renal damage in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis rats. Immunohistochemical cystatin C expression in the proximal renal tubules was barely changed by the progression of glomerulonephritis, but it was newly observed in the tubular lumen when renal damage was apparent.

Here, we evaluated whether epoetin beta pegol (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator: CERA), which has a long half-life in blood and strongly suppresses hepcidin-25, exerts renoprotection in a rat model of chronic progressive glomerulonephritis (cGN). cGN rats showed elevated urinary total protein excretion (uTP) and plasma urea nitrogen (UN) from day 14 after the induction of kidney disease (day 0) and finally declined into end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), showing reduced creatinine clearance with glomerulosclerosis, tubular dilation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. A single dose of CERA given on day 1, but not on day 16, alleviated increasing uTP and UN, thereby delaying ESKD. In the initial disease phase, CERA significantly suppressed urinary 8-OHdG and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular damage marker. CERA also inhibited elevated plasma hepcidin-25 levels and alleviated subsequent iron accumulation in kidneys in association with elevated urinary iron excretion and resulted in alleviation of growth of Ki67-positive tubular and glomerular cells. In addition, at day 28 when the exacerbation of uTP occurs, a significant correlation was observed between iron deposition in the kidney and urinary L-FABP. In our study, CERA mitigated increasing kidney damage, thereby delaying CKD progression in this glomerulonephritis rat model. Alleviation by CERA of the exacerbation of kidney damage could be attributable to mitigation of tubular damage that might occur with lowered iron deposition in tubules.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation and in the pathology of various renal diseases. Erlotinib is a novel, oral, highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the EGF receptor. It is clinically used to treat non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers. Here, we investigated the effect of erlotinib on the progression of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in an experimental model. Mesangial glomerulonephritis was induced with anti-rat Thy-1.1 antibody in male Wistar rats weighing 150-160Â g. Rats were treated with erlotinib (10Â mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle only (polyethylene glycol). Native Wistar rat kidneys were used as histological controls. Serum creatinine levels were measured at day 7. Kidneys were harvested 7Â days after antibody administration for histology. Native controls showed no histological signs of glomerular pathology. In the vehicle group, intense glomerular inflammation developed after 7Â days and prominent mesangial cell proliferation and glomerular matrix accumulation was seen. Erlotinib was well tolerated and there were no adverse effects during the follow-up period. Erlotinib significantly prevented progression of the glomerular inflammatory response and glomerular mesangial cell proliferation as well as matrix accumulation when compared with the vehicle group. Erlotinib also preserved renal function. These results indicate that erlotinib prevents the early events of experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Therefore, inhibition of the EGF receptor with erlotinib could prevent the progression of glomerulonephritis also in clinical nephrology.\n\nPathogenesis diagnosis and management of paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLien, Yeong-Hau H.; Lai, Li-Wen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nParaneoplastic glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of malignancy that is frequently mistaken for idiopathic glomerulonephritis. Failure to recognize paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis can subject patients to ineffective and potentially harmful therapy. Pathology of paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis varies between different types of malignancies. This Review describes the association of glomerulonephritis with both solid tumors and hematological malignancies The pathogenetic mechanisms of many glomerular lesions seem to relate to altered immune responses in the presence of a malignancy Studies in the Buffalo/Mna rat model of spontaneous thymoma and nephrotic syndrome indicate that polarization of the immune response toward a T-helper-2 (TH2) profile has an important role in the development of thymoma-associated glomerular lesions. Furthermore, overexpression of the TH2 cytokine interleukin 13 in transgenic rats induces minimal change disease. Such findings from experimental studies might facilitate the identification of biomarkers that can distinguish paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis from idiopathic and other secondary glomerulonephritides. This Review describes potential pathogenetic mechanisms for paraneoplastic glomerulonephritides associated with different malignancies and highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis.

Patients with newly diagnosed AAV from 53 tertiary institutions were enrolled. Six-month remission, overall survival, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD)-free survival were evaluated. According to the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS)-defined disease severity, the 321 enrolled patients were classified as follows: 14, localized; 71, early systemic; 170, generalized; and 66, severe disease. According to the rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) clinical grading system, the patients were divided as follows: 60, grade I; 178, grade II; 66, grade III; and 12, grade IV. According to the Five-Factor Score (FFS) 2009, 103, 109, and 109 patients had â¤1, 2, and â¥3 points, respectively. No significant difference in remission rates was found in any severity classification. The overall and ESRD-free survival rates significantly differed between grades I/II, III, and IV, regardless of renal involvement. Severe disease was a good predictor of six-month overall and ESRD-free survival. The FFS 2009 was useful to predict six-month ESRD-free survival but not overall survival. The RPGN grading system was more useful to predict six-month overall and ESRD-free survival than the EUVAS-defined severity or FFS 2009.\n\nFamilial risks of glomerulonephritis - a nationwide family study in Sweden.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkrawi, Delshad Saleh; Li, Xinjun; Sundquist, Jan; Fjellstedt, Erik; Sundquist, Kristina; ZÃ¶ller, Bengt\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFamilial risks of glomerulonephritis (acute, chronic and unspecified glomerulonephritis) have not been studied. This study aims to determine the familial risks of glomerulonephritis. Individuals born from1932 onwards diagnosed with glomerulonephritis (acute [nâ=â7011], chronic [nâ=â10,242] and unspecified glomerulonephritis [nâ=â5762]) were included. The familial risk (Standardized incidence ratioâ=âSIR) was calculated for individuals whose parents/full-siblings were diagnosed with glomerulonephritis compared to those whose parents/full-siblings were not. The procedure was repeated for spouses. Familial concordant risk (same disease in proband and exposed relative) and discordant risk (different disease in proband and exposed relative) of glomerulonephritis were determined. Familial concordant risks (parents/full-sibling history) were: SIRâ=â3.57 (95% confidence interval, 2.77-4.53) for acute glomerulonephritis, SIRâ=â3.84 (3.37-4.36) for chronic glomerulonephritis and SIRâ=â3.75 (2.85-4.83) for unspecified glomerulonephritis. High familial risks were observed if two or more relatives were affected; the SIR was 209.83 (150.51-284.87) in individuals with at least one affected parent as well as one full-sibling. The spouse risk was only moderately increased (SIRâ=â1.53, 1.33-1.75). Family history of glomerulonephritis is a strong predictor for glomerulonephritis, and is a potentially useful tool in clinical risk assessment. Our data emphasize the contribution of familial factors to the glomerulonephritis burden in the community. Key Messages The familial risks (full-sibling/parent history) of glomerulonephritis (acute, chronic and unspecified glomerulonephritis) have not been determined previously. The familial risks of glomerulonephritis were increased among individuals with family history of acute, chronic or unspecified glomerulonephritis. The familial risks of glomerulonephritis were slightly increased among spouses indicating a\n\nApplication of the solid phase C1q and Raji cell radioimmune assays for the detection of circulating immune complexes in glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTung, K S; Woodroffe, A J; Ahlin, T D; Williams, R C; Wilson, C B\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe C1q solid phase and Raji cell radioimmune assays were used to determine the frequency of detectable circulating immune complexes in patients with glomerulonephritis. In this study, 46% of 56 patients with glomerulonephritis had evidence of circulating immune complexes. More important, circulating immune complexes were associated with some, but not other, types of glomerulonephritis. Thus, immune complexes were detected in lupus glomerulonephritis (9/9 patients), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (5/6 patients), and acute nephritis (5/6 patients), but not in IgA-IgG glomerulonephritis (0/7 patients), or membranous glomerulonephritis (0/8 patients). The Raji cell radioimmune assay and the C1q solid phase radioimmune assay showed concordance of 79% in the detection of circulating immune complexes. Serial determinations, in general, showed either persistence of a negative or positive result of conversion of positive to negative.

We aimed to evaluate the frequency of MEFV gene mutation to show possible coexistence of FMF in patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis (GN). A total of 64 patients with biopsy-proven primary GN were included in the study. MEFV gene mutations examined retrospectively. The mean age of patients was 39.6Â Â±Â 13.4 (range 18-69), 35 of patients were female and 29 of patients were male. Of the 64 patients, 17 were mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), 15 were IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 12 were membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), 11 were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), three were membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), three were immune complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN), two were minimal change disease (MCD), and one was IgM nephropathy (IgMN). MEFV gene mutation was detected in 35.9% (23) of these patients. The most frequently detected mutations were E148Q and M694V. Twelve cases (18.75% of GN patients) with MEFV gene mutation were diagnosed as FMF phenotype I. The frequency of MEFV gene mutation was detected at a high rate of 35.9%. Further studies with larger populations are needed to clarify the importance of these mutations on clinical progression of glomerulonephritis.\n\nAcute postinfectious glomerulonephritis associated with scabies in the elderly: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Di; Li, Li; Wei, Lei; Liu, Yingying; Sun, Shiren\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAcute postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN) secondary to scabies were mainly documented as early as in 1980s, and in all these published cases no histopathological evidence of renal biopsy were reported regarding scabies and renal damage. The delay in scabies treatment can result in a greater risk of secondary bacterial infections that can become invasive and/or lead to severe post-infective complications such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. In diagnostic procedures, the clinical presentation of scabies is often atypical especially in elderly people patients. However, early diagnosis is necessary to prevent disease progression. Here, we present a case of acute glomerulonephritis caused by scabies in a 79-year-old male patient who presented with papular rash, asthma, haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension and variable azotaemia. The aim is to provide more details of the clinical features and the histopathologic characteristics, and to increase the vigilance among physicians in patients with acute GN.

S.; White, R. H. R.\n\n1970-01-01\n\nThe clinical, laboratory, and histological findings of 50 patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis are described. Three-quarters of the patients, who were mostly older children and young adults, presented clinically with a mixture of ânephriticâ and ânephroticâ symptoms; the remaining quarter had no symptoms and were diagnosed after the discovery of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. Though this clinical picture may occur in other forms of glomerulonephritis, the patients described here were unified as a group by their glomerular morphological appearanceânamely, a combination of mesangial proliferation and capillary wall thickening, mainly due to subendothelial accumulations of mesangial matrix. In 68% serum C3 (Î²10-globulin) levels were reduced initially, while a further 16% subsequently showed a fall to abnormally low levels. All patients had substantial proteinuria, usually of moderately impaired selectivity, and all but one had haematuria in addition. Children frequently presented with an illness resembling acute nephritis, whereas adults usually had a nephrotic syndrome from the start. In 31 patients, followed for periods of one to eight and a half years, serial measurements of glomerular filtration rate were made. Sixteen have experienced no deterioration of renal function, though their proteinuria continues unchanged. Fifteen have shown progressive deterioration; six of them are still well, six are on regular dialysis treatment, and three have died. Treatment with corticosteroids, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination, did not seem to influence the course of the disease, and another two patients died from complications of steroid therapy. The disease usually runs a chronic course and appears to be progressive.

Kidney manifestations, particularly glomerulonephritis, are common sequelae of infectious endocarditis, with nearly half of all Bartonella patients demonstrating renal involvement. Although a pauci-immune pattern is a frequent finding in infectious endocarditisâassociated glomerulonephritis, it is rarely reported in Bartonella endocarditis. Antiâneutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity can be seen with many pathogens causing endocarditis and has been previously reported with Bartonella species. In addition, ANCA-associated vasculitis can also present with renal and cardiac involvement, including noninfectious valvular vegetations and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Given the overlap in their clinical presentation, it is difficult to differentiate between Bartonella endocarditis and ANCA-associated vasculitis but imperative to do so to guide management decisions. We present a case of ANCA-positive Bartonella endocarditis with associated pauci-immune glomerulonephritis that was successfully treated with medical management alone.

The greater the amount of anti-GBM antibody binding the antigen (type IV collagen of the glomerular basement membrane), the greater the number of crescents that develop in glomeruli, resulting in progression of renal impairment. Immunofluorescence staining reveals linear IgG depositions on glomerular capillary walls. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in middle-aged to elderly patients. Immune complex is deposited in the sub-epithelial space of the glomerulus resulting in the development of a membranous lesion. Immunofluorescence staining reveals granular IgG depositions on glomerular capillary walls. Coexisting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN are rare and, here we report a case of coexisting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN with preserved renal function. There are some cases of coexisting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN do not show severely decreased renal function. A 76-year-old Japanese woman presented with nephrotic syndrome, microscopic hematuria, and was positive for anti-GBM antibody. Kidney biopsy revealed linear and granular IgG depositions in glomerular capillary walls, crescent formations, and electron-dense deposits in the sub-epithelial space. She was diagnosed with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN. Steroid and cyclosporine therapy achieved complete remission, and kidney function was preserved. In conclusion, coexisting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN can have preserved renal function. IgG subclass of deposited anti-GBM antibody may be associated with the severity of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. In addition, in the case of nephrotic syndrome with hematuria, we should consider the possibility of coexisting anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and MN.\n\nPauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis complicating rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nQarni, M U; Kohan, D E\n\n2000-07-01\n\nNecrotizing glomerulonephritis associated with rheumatoid arthritis typically occurs in the setting of frankly apparent systemic vasculitic signs and symptoms. We report two recent cases that differed from this paradigm. Both patients had rheumatoid arthritis and deteriorating renal function due to P-ANCA positive pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, but minimal systemic symptoms. Delay in diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy may have contributed to the dialysis dependence of one of these patients. We suggest that heightened suspicion of an aggressive necrotizing glomerulonephritis should be maintained in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis who present with acute renal insufficiency even in the absence of frank vasculitis.\n\nMembranous glomerulonephritis associated with enterococcal endocarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIida, H; Mizumura, Y; Uraoka, T; Takata, M; Sugimoto, T; Miwa, A; Yamagishi, T\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAn autopsy case of membranous glomerulonephritis associated with enterococcal endocarditis was reported. Although enterococcal antigen was not identified in glomerular deposits, the eluate from the patient's renal tissue was shown to specifically recombine with cells of the enterococcus isolated from his own ante mortem blood. Hypocomplementemia, circulating immune complexes and antienterococcal antibodies were also observed. These findings suggest that enterococcus-related immune complexes played a role in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis associated with enterococcal endocarditis in this patient.\n\nPattern of biopsy-proven kidney disease in the elderly in a tertiary care hospital in India: a clinicopathological study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagchi, Soumita; Mittal, Parmod; Singh, Geetika; Agarwal, Sanjay Kumar; Singh, Lavleen; Bhowmik, Dipankar; Mahajan, Sandeep; Dinda, Amit\n\n2016-04-01\n\nAn aging population is an important demographic issue in India. The knowledge base about kidney diseases among the elderly Indians is inadequate. We aim to delineate the clinical profile and spectrum of biopsy-proven kidney disease in elderly patients. Records of all elderly patients (â¥60 years) who had undergone kidney biopsy in the nephrology department from January 2010 to December 2014 were reviewed. Their clinical details and laboratory investigations at the time of biopsy were noted. Details of kidney biopsy were recorded from their biopsy reports. In total, 1728 patients underwent kidney biopsy during this period and 124 were elderly (7.2%). Their mean age was 64.9 Â± 4.9 years, and they were predominantly males (63.7%). Mean serum creatinine was 3.0 Â± 2.8 mg/dl, proteinuria was 4.0 Â± 2.7 g/day, and 39.5% had microscopic hematuria. The most common indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (NS)--39.5% and acute kidney injury/rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (AKI/RPGN)--24.2%. Another 8.1% patients had NS with AKI. MN (39.0%) was the chief cause of NS, and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) (28.2%) was the leading cause of AKI/RPGN. MN, pauci-immune crescentic GN and acute on chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (A/CTIN) and acute tubular injury (ATI) were more common in the elderly, while MCD, FSGS, IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis were more frequent in the younger patients. 68.5% of the elderly patients biopsied were diagnosed with a renal disease which was potentially amenable to specific treatment. The spectrum of biopsy-proven kidney disease in the elderly Indians seen in our tertiary care hospital varies from the younger population. Kidney biopsy provides useful information with therapeutic and prognostic implications in these patients. The percentage of elderly patients among the total biopsied population is low in India, and these patients present late with renal dysfunction. Prospective studies are needed to assess the\n\nAmeliorative effects of arctiin from Arctium lappa on experimental glomerulonephritis in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Jian-Guo; Wu, Jin-Zhong; Sun, Lian-Na; Han, Ting; Du, Jian; Ye, Qi; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Yu-Guang\n\n2009-11-01\n\nMembranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) remains the most common cause of adult-onset nephrotic syndrome in the world and up to 40% of untreated patients will progress to end-stage renal disease. Although the treatment of MGN with immunosuppressants or steroid hormones can attenuate the deterioration of renal function, numerous treatment-related complications have also been established. In this study, the ameliorative effects of arctiin, a natural compound isolated from the fruits of Arctium lappa, on rat glomerulonephritis induced by cationic bovine serum albumin (cBSA) were determined. After oral administration of arctiin (30, 60, 120 mg/kgd) for three weeks, the levels of serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24-h urine protein content markedly decreased, while endogenous creatinine clearance rate (ECcr) significantly increased. The parameters of renal lesion, hypercellularity, infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN), fibrinoid necrosis, focal and segmental proliferation and interstitial infiltration, were reversed. In addition, we observed that arctiin evidently reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), suppressed nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity, and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. These findings suggest that the ameliorative effects of arctiin on glomerulonephritis is carried out mainly by suppression of NF-kappaB activation and nuclear translocation and the decreases in the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, while SOD is involved in the inhibitory pathway of NF-kappaB activation. Arctiin has favorable potency for the development of an inhibitory agent of NF-kappaB and further application to clinical treatment of glomerulonephritis, though clinical studies are required.\n\nIgG3 deficiency extends lifespan and attenuates progression of glomerulonephritis in MRL/lpr mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\n/lpr mice against glomerulonephritis-associated morbidity and mortality by slowing or arresting the progression to glomerulosclerosis.

This study was carried on 94 children, <15 years old with the diagnosis of AGN who were admitted to Qom and Yazd's hospitals between 2000 and 2006. Data were collected using hospital records on admission, progression notes and outpatient follow up. Among 94 patients, 55.3% were male and 44.6% were female. Mean age of patients was 8.2Â±2.7 years old. Acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) was reported in 92.5%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 4.2%, hemolytic uremic syndrome in 2.1% and IgA nephropathy in 1.06%. There was no significant differences between GN types and gender (P=0.54). Clinical manifestation included edema in 68.8%, oliguria in 36.3%, gross hematuria in 69.1%, HTN in 61.7% and anuria in 1.06%. Microscopic hematuria was detected in all patients. In the time of follow up none of patients had hypertension, 3.1% had proteinuria and 6.3% had microscopic hematuria. APSGN is the most common causes of AGN in Qom and Yazd's children. Early diagnosis and treatment of APSGN may protect children from long term morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life.\n\nEculizumab for dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBomback, Andrew S; Smith, Richard J; Barile, Gaetano R; Zhang, Yuzhou; Heher, Eliot C; Herlitz, Leal; Stokes, M Barry; Markowitz, Glen S; D'Agati, Vivette D; Canetta, Pietro A; Radhakrishnan, Jai; Appel, Gerald B\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe principle defect in dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis is hyperactivity of the alternative complement pathway. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to C5 to prevent formation of the membrane attack complex, may prove beneficial. In this open-label, proof of concept efficacy and safety study, six subjects with dense deposit disease or C3 glomerulonephritis were treated with eculizumab every other week for 1 year. All had proteinuria >1 g/d and/or AKI at enrollment. Subjects underwent biopsy before enrollment and repeat biopsy at the 1-year mark. The subjects included three patients with dense deposit disease (including one patient with recurrent dense deposit disease in allograft) and three patients with C3 glomerulonephritis (including two patients with recurrent C3 glomerulonephritis in allograft). Genetic and complement function testing revealed a mutation in CFH and MCP in one subject each, C3 nephritic factor in three subjects, and elevated levels of serum membrane attack complex in three subjects. After 12 months, two subjects showed significantly reduced serum creatinine, one subject achieved marked reduction in proteinuria, and one subject had stable laboratory parameters but histopathologic improvements. Elevated serum membrane attack complex levels normalized on therapy and paralleled improvements in creatinine and proteinuria. Clinical and histopathologic data suggest a response to eculizumab in some but not all subjects with dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis. Elevation of serum membrane attack complex before treatment may predict response. Additional research is needed to define the subgroup of dense deposit disease/C3 glomerulonephritis patients in whom eculizumab therapy can be considered.\n\n[Primary chronic polyarthritis with kidney involvement (mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ¼rkle, P A\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA 34 year old white male patient suffering from seropositive \"probable\" rheumatoid arthritis developed a severe hypocomplementemic mesangiocapillary glomerulo-nephritis. Rheumatoid factors (Latex test, Waaler-Rose titer) and IgM were markedly elevated in the serum. The third component of complement (C3) was markedly depressed, while the fourth component (C4) was within normal range. The rapid progression of the disease forced us to start an immunosuppressive drug therapy using azathioprine and steroids. Despite marked clinical improvement, e.g. normalisation of complement components, renal function, the disappearance of rheumatoid factor and proteinuria, the second biopsy taken two years later showed unchanged histological and immuno-histological changes of the glomerula.\n\nEculizumab for Dense Deposit Disease and C3 Glomerulonephritis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, Richard J.; Barile, Gaetano R.; Zhang, Yuzhou; Heher, Eliot C.; Herlitz, Leal; Stokes, M.

PMID:22403278\n\nCurrent pharmacotherapy for the treatment of crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTam, Frederick W K\n\n2006-11-01\n\nGlomerulonephritis is an important cause of end-stage renal disease. Crescentic glomerulonephritis is the most severe form of glomerulonephritis and, if untreated, patients will develop renal failure within days or weeks of diagnosis. Current immunotherapy consists of corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs and plasma exchange. Challenges include minimising toxicity of therapy, preventing relapse in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis and finding an effective treatment for crescentic IgA nephropathy. There are opportunities for more specific therapies using monoclonal antibodies to T cells (and their co-stimulatory receptors), B cells and cytokines, or pharmacological inhibitors of signal transduction. Their efficacy and safety remain to be established with controlled clinical trials. Recent development of urinary cytokine measurement provides a noninvasive biomarker of renal disease activity, which is useful in monitoring response to therapy and assessing prognosis.\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis in non-asthmatic Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaul, Anupma; Sharma, Raj Kumar; Jaisuresh, Krishna Swamy; Agrawal, Vinita\n\n2014-03-01\n\nA 58-year-old male presented with sensory motor polyneuropathy and rapidly progressive renal failure. Investigations revealed marked peripheral eosinophilia and elevated perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers. Renal biopsy showed pauci-immune cre-scentic glomerulonephritis with interstitial eosinophil infiltrates. He had no history of asthma. Computed tomography of the chest and X-ray of the paranasal sinuses were normal. On Day 1, the patient developed ileal perforation. Resected ileal segments showed small vessel vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils. A diagnosis of non-asthmatic variant of Churg-Strauss syndrome was made. Renal recovery was achieved in 12 weeks with a combination therapy of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide. The patient has been relapse-free for 12 months on oral prednisolone therapy.\n\nS100A8/A9 (Calprotectin) Is Critical for Development of Glomerulonephritis and Promotes Inflammatory LeukocyteâRenal Cell Interactions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPepper, Ruth J.; Wang, Hsu-Han; Rajakaruna, Gayathri K.; Papakrivopoulou, Eugenia; Vogl, Thomas; Pusey, Charles D.; Cook, H. Terence; Salama, Alan D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGlomerulonephritis is a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Infiltrating leukocytes interacting with renal cells play a critical role during the initiation and progression of glomerulonephritis, but the exact mechanisms are not clearly defined. By using the murine model of nephrotoxic nephritis, we investigated the role of S100A8/A9 [myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14, calprotectin] in promoting glomerulonephritis. In nephrotoxic nephritis, wild-type (WT) mice with glomerulonephritis have elevated serum levels of S100A8/A9, whereas mice deficient in MRP14 (S100a9â/â), and hence S100A8/A9, are significantly protected from disease. By using bone marrow transplants, we showed that MRP14 deficiency is required in both the hemopoietic and intrinsic cells for the protective effect. InÂ vitro, both the WT bone marrowâderived macrophages and renal mesangial cells stimulated with S100A8/A9 secrete IL-6, CXCL1, and tumor necrosis factor Î±; however, Mrp14â/â cells exhibit significantly blunted proinflammatory responses. The interaction of WT bone marrowâderived macrophages with renal microvascular endothelial cells results in increased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1, IL-8, and IL-6 cytokines, which isÂ attenuated in Mrp14â/â bone marrowâderived macrophages. Data shows that S100A8/A9 plays a critical role during glomerulonephritis, exerting and amplifying autocrine and paracrine proinflammatory effects on bone marrowâderived macrophages, renal endothelial cells, and mesangial cells. Therefore, complete S100A8/A9 blockade may be a new therapeutic target in glomerulonephritis.

These may be pauci-immune/vasculitic GN, post-infective GN, and sub-endothelial membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Each type of glomerulonephritis usually occurs in isolation. We report a case of infective endocarditis with dual existence of pauci-immune/vasculitic GN and post infective type of GN at the same time.\n\nFocal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarper, L; Cockwell, P; Howie, A J; Michael, J; Richards, N T; Savage, C O; Wheeler, D C; Bacon, P A; Adu, D\n\n1997-02-01\n\nWe report ten patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed a focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis (FSNGN) and extracapillary proliferation typical of vasculitic glomerulonephritis. Five patients also had extrarenal vasculitis. Renal presentation was with renal impairment (n = 9) (median creatinine 726 mumol/l, range 230-1592 mumol/l), microscopic haematuria (n = 8) and proteinuria (n = 10). Nine patients were seropositive for rheumatoid factor and nine had bone erosions. Serum from four of five patients tested by indirect immunofluorescence was positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) with perinuclear staining. Only three patients had penicillamine or gold therapy. Treatment was with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide (six patients, two of whom were also plasma-exchanged), prednisolone and azathioprine (two patients) and prednisolone alone (two patients). There was a marked improvement in renal function in eight patients. Two patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure recovered renal function, although in one patient this was transient and she required further dialysis 4 months later. Two other patients progressed to dialysis at 3 months and 1 year respectively. Four patients died, one remains dialysis-dependent, and four continue to have good renal function at 5 year follow-up (median creatinine 148.5 mumol/l, range 120-193 mumol/l). One patient was lost to follow-up at 5 years. FSNGN should be considered in all patients with RA and renal impairment, proteinuria and/or microscopic haematuria. This diagnosis appears to be more likely in patients with clinical extrarenal vasculitis, bone erosions or who are seropositive. In these cases, an urgent renal biopsy is indicated.\n\nRole of immunoflourescence in the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nNasir, Humaira; Chaudhry, Sarah; Raza, Wajiha; Moatasim, Ambreen; Mamoon, Nadira; Akhtar, Noreen\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo correlate the findings of immunoflorescence (IF) with morphology in renal biopsies of patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) of both primary and secondary nature. The cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at the Shifa International Hospital's Department of Pathology form March 2007 to August 2008, during which a total of 207 renal biopsies were done. Of them, the study included 92 cases which were diagnosed as primary or secondary glomerulonephritis under light microscope. Those cases were selected in which both light microscopy (LM) and immunoflorescence were done. Of the 92 patients, 79 (85.8%) were adults (> or = 19 years) and 13 (14%) were children (< 19 years). The mean age of adults was 36.44 +/- 11.55 (range 19-69 years) and that of the children was 10.54 +/- 3.85 years (range 4-18 years). immunoflorescence changed the morphologic diagnosis in 20 (21.73%) cases. The pattern of disease was: membranous glomerulonephritis in 24%, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 18.4%, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis in 2%, and minimal change disease (MCD) in 16% of the cases. Light microscopy alone can misdiagnose renal disease. This is especially important in cases of early stage membranous, IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Lupus nephritis and IgM nephropathy (IgMN), as these entities can only be diagnosed by correlating the microscopic, immunoflorescence findings and clinical details.\n\nGene expression profiling of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis model: the role of NF-kappaB in immune complex kidney disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Ju Han; Ha, Il Soo; Hwang, Chang-Il; Lee, Young-Ju; Kim, Jihoon; Yang, Seung-Hee; Kim, Yon Su; Cao, Yun Anna; Choi, Sangdun; Park, Woong-Yang\n\n2004-11-01\n\nImmune complexes may cause an irreversible onset of chronic renal disease. Most patients with chronic renal disease undergo a final common pathway, marked by glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. We attempted to draw a molecular map of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis in mice using oligonucleotide microarray technology. Kidneys were harvested at days 1, 3, 7, 11, and 16 after inducing glomerulonephritis by using anti-GBM antibody. In parallel with examining the biochemical and histologic changes, gene expression profiles were acquired against five pooled control kidneys. Gene expression levels were cross-validated by either reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, or immunohistochemistry. Pathologic changes in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis were confirmed in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains. Among the 13,680 spotted 65mer oligonucleotides, 1112 genes showing significant temporal patterns by permutation analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple testing correction [false discovery ratio (FDR) < 0.05] were chosen for cluster analysis. From the expression profile, acute inflammatory reactions characterized by the elevation of various cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, were identified within 3 days of disease onset. After 7 days, tissue remodeling response was prominent with highly induced extracellular-matrix (ECM) genes. Although cytokines related to lymphocyte activation were not detected, monocyte or mesangial cell proliferation-related genes were increased. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway were consistently activated along the entire disease progression, inducing various target genes like complement 3, IL-1b, IL-6, Traf1, and Saa1. We made a large-scale gene expression time table for mouse anti-GBM glomerulonephritis model, providing a comprehensive overview on the mechanism governing the initiation and the progression of inflammatory\n\nRituximab for Treatment of Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis and C3 Glomerulopathies\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a histological pattern of injury resulting from predominantly subendothelial and mesangial deposition of immunoglobulins or complement factors with subsequent inflammation and proliferation particularly of the glomerular basement membrane. Recent classification of MPGN is based on pathogenesis dividing MPGN into immunoglobulin-associated MPGN and complement-mediated C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and dense deposit disease (DDD). Current guidelines suggest treatment with steroids, cytotoxic agents with or without plasmapheresis only for subjects with progressive disease, that is, nephrotic range proteinuria and decline of renal function. Rituximab, a chimeric B-cell depleting anti-CD20 antibody, has emerged in the last decade as a treatment option for patients with primary glomerular diseases such as minimal change disease, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis, or idiopathic membranous nephropathy. However, data on the use of rituximab in MPGN, C3GN, and DDD are limited to case reports and retrospective case series. Patients with immunoglobulin-associated and idiopathic MPGN who were treated with rituximab showed partial and complete responses in the majorities of cases. However, rituximab was not effective in few cases of C3GN and DDD. Despite promising results in immunoglobulin-associated and idiopathic MPGN, current evidence on this treatment remains weak, and controlled and prospective data are urgently needed.

However, the effect of LLLT on internal organs has not been elucidated. The goal of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of daily external LLLT in an animal model of crescentic glomerulonephritis. Crescentic glomerulonephritis was induced in male Wister Kyoto rats by intravenous injection of antibody for glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The rats were irradiated with a low-reactive level diode laser with an infrared wavelength of 830Â nm from the shaved skin surface once a day for 14Â days (irradiation spot size on the skin surface, 2.27Â cm(2); power intensity, 880Â mW/cm(2); irradiation mode, continuous mode; irradiation time, 250Â s; energy, 500Â J; energy density, 220Â J/cm(2)). After laser irradiation for 14Â days, animals were killed, and the extent of inflammation was evaluated. Expression of gene for inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Crescent formation in glomeruli and infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes were assessed by histochemical observation. Injection of anti-GBM antibody induced severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation. Histological observations indicated that LLLT suppressed crescent formation and infiltration of ED1+ macrophages and CD8+ lymphocytes into the glomeruli. LLLT attenuated the levels of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± messenger RNA in the renal cortex. Externally directed LLLT suppresses the activity of rat anti-GBM crescentic glomerulonephritis in rats. LLLT has the potential to be used for direct treatment of glomerulonephritis.\n\nRituximab treatment for fibrillary glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHogan, Jonathan; Restivo, Michaela; Canetta, Pietro A; Herlitz, Leal C; Radhakrishnan, Jai; Appel, Gerald B; Bomback, Andrew S\n\n2014-10-01\n\nApproximately 50% of patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis (GN) progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 2 years of diagnosis, and no standard therapy exists. The data on rituximab therapy for fibrillary GN are limited and have inconsistent outcomes. Here, we report the largest case series to date using rituximab for fibrillary GN. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 12 patients with fibrillary GN who were treated with rituximab (1 g i.v. Ã 2 doses or 375 mg/m(2) Ã 4 doses) at the Center for Glomerular Diseases at Columbia University Medical Center. Non-progression of disease was defined as stable/improved serum creatinine (SCr) with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. The median SCr was 2.1 (range 0.7-2.7) mg/dL, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 39 (range 21-98) mL/min/1.73 m(2) and median proteinuria 4497 (range 210-7542) mg/day at the time of rituximab initiation. Four patients had received immunosuppression before rituximab, and nine received immunosuppression after rituximab, with four receiving a second rituximab course. Four of 12 patients were non-progressors, 3 of 12 had progressive renal dysfunction without reaching ESRD, and 5 patients reached ESRD. The median follow-up for patients who did not reach ESRD was 38 (range 14-76) months after rituximab treatment. Non-progressors had lower SCr values, higher eGFRs and shorter median duration from diagnosis to treatment than progressors. No serious adverse events were noted. Rituximab therapy was associated with non-progression of renal disease in 4 of 12 patients. At the time of treatment, these non-progressors had better renal function and shorter time from diagnosis to treatment than progressors. Â© The Author 2014.

Recombinant inbred SCG/Kj mice develop spontaneous crescentic glomerulonephritis, systemic vasculitis, and a lymphoproliferative disorder early in life. To determine whether the precipitous autoimmune disease of SCG/Kj mice could be treated by bone marrow transplantation, 30 SCG/Kj mice were engrafted with T-cell-depleted, bone marrow (TCDM) from allogeneic, MHC-compatible, autoimmune-resistant C3H/He donors, and 30 SCG/Kj mice served as controls and received TCDM from syngeneic, SCG/Kj donors. A significant survival advantage was evident from SCG/Kj mice engrafted with C3H/He TCDM (p < 0.005), and an 89% extension of median survival compared to recipients of SCG/Kj TCDM. Within 28 weeks post-transplantation, 62% of mice engrafted with SCG/Kj TCDM had died with clinical signs of fatal crescentic glomerulonephritis. This result compared with only 10% of mice engrafted with C3H/He TCDM. Mice engrafted with SCG/Kj TCDM developed significantly greater titers of autoantibodies to ss-DNA, ds-DNA, and myeloperoxidase (ANCA) (p < 0.001), had shorter latencies to the development of, and a greater incidence of proteinuria, hematuria, and peripheral lymphadenopathy, and a greater mean grade of glomerular lesion (p < 0.001), than mice engrafted with C3H/He TCDM. These findings indicate that the genetic defect of the SCG/Kj strain of mice resides within the hematopoietic stem cells and provokes the speculation that bone marrow transplantation might be a useful means of treating progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis in humans.\n\nTargeted delivery of celastrol to mesangial cells is effective against mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Ling; Luo, Shi; Du, Zhengwu; Zhou, Meiling; Li, Peiwen; Fu, Yao; Sun, Xun; Huang, Yuan; Zhang, Zhirong\n\n2017-10-12\n\nMesangial cells-mediated glomerulonephritis is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Here, we show that celastrol is effective in treating both reversible and irreversible mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in rat models, but find that its off-target distributions cause severe systemic toxicity. We thus target celastrol to mesangial cells using albumin nanoparticles. Celastrol-albumin nanoparticles crosses fenestrated endothelium and accumulates in mesangial cells, alleviating proteinuria, inflammation, glomerular hypercellularity, and excessive extracellular matrix deposition in rat anti-Thy1.1 nephritis models. Celastrol-albumin nanoparticles presents lower drug accumulation than free celastrol in off-target organs and tissues, thereby minimizing celastrol-related systemic toxicity. Celastrol-albumin nanoparticles thus represents a promising treatment option for mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and similar glomerular diseases.Mesangial cell-mediated glomerulonephritis is a frequent cause of kidney disease. Here the authors show that celastrol loaded in albumin nanoparticles efficiently targets mesangial cells, and is effective in rat models.\n\nCharacterisation of the macrophage transcriptome in glomerulonephritis-susceptible and -resistant rat strains\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaratou, Klio; Behmoaras, Jacques; Fewings, Chris; Srivastava, Prashant; DâSouza, Zelpha; Smith, Jennifer; Game, Laurence; Cook, Terence; Aitman, Tim\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis (CRGN) is a major cause of rapidly progressive renal failure for which the underlying genetic basis is unknown. WKY rats show marked susceptibility to CRGN, while Lewis rats are resistant. Glomerular injury and crescent formation are macrophage-dependent and mainly explained by seven quantitative trait loci (Crgn1-7). Here, we used microarray analysis in basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages to identify genes that reside on pathways predisposing WKY rats to CRGN. We detected 97 novel positional candidates for the uncharacterised Crgn3-7. We identified 10 additional secondary effector genes with profound differences in expression between the two strains (>5-fold change, <1% False Discovery Rate) for basal and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, we identified 8 genes with differentially expressed alternatively spliced isoforms, by using an in depth analysis at probe-level that allowed us to discard false positives due to polymorphisms between the two rat strains. Pathway analysis identified several common linked pathways, enriched for differentially expressed genes, which affect macrophage activation. In summary, our results identify distinct macrophage transcriptome profiles between two rat strains that differ in susceptibility to glomerulonephritis, provide novel positional candidates for Crgn3-7, and define groups of genes that play a significant role in differential regulation of macrophage activity.

In most cases, granulomatous tissue alters the production of vitamin D, which leads to hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis is another well-recognized pathological process associated with sarcoidosis. However, a glomerular pathology is very rarely noted, and only a few cases are reported to have cellular crescentic glomerulonephritis. We describe the case of a 26-year-old African American woman with systemic sarcoidosis, with a unique constellation of renal lesions, including noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous necrotizing interstitial nephritis, cellular crescent formation, and necrotizing vasculitis. Immunosuppressive therapy was helpful for alleviating her nephrotic syndrome and maintaining the stability of her renal function over a 30-month period. Glomerular involvement of sarcoidosis needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of rapidly progressive glomerular nephritis.\n\nEffects of CTLA4-Fc on glomerular injury in humorally-mediated glomerulonephritis in BALB/c mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKitching, A R; Huang, X R; Ruth, A-J; Tipping, P G; Holdsworth, S R\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe effect of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated molecule 4-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4-Fc) on humorally-mediated glomerulonephritis was studied in accelerated anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis induced in BALB/c mice. This strain of mice develops antibody and complement dependent glomerulonephritis under this protocol. Sensitized BALB/c mice developed high levels of circulating autologous antibody titres, intense glomerular deposition of mouse immunoglobulin and complement, significant proteinuria, renal impairment, significant glomerular necrosis and a minor component of crescent formation 10 days after challenge with a nephritogenic antigen (sheep anti-GBM globulin). Early treatment during the primary immune response, or continuous treatment throughout the disease with CTLA4-Fc, significantly suppressed mouse anti-sheep globulin antibody titres in serum, and immunoglobulin and complement deposition in glomeruli. The degree of glomerular necrosis was improved and proteinuria was reduced, particularly in the earlier stages of disease. Late treatment by CTLA4-Fc starting one day after challenge with sheep anti-mouse GBM did not affect antibody production and did not attenuate glomerulonephritis. The low level of crescent formation found in BALB/c mice developing glomerulonephritis was not prevented by the administration of CTLA4-Fc. These results demonstrate that CTLA4-Fc is of benefit in this model of glomerulonephritis by its capacity to attenuate antibody production, without affecting the minor degree of cell-mediated glomerular injury.

Charles; Preston, Gloria A.; Falk, Ronald J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLysosomal membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) is a target of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) in addition to the more commonly known targets proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. The prevalence of antiâLAMP-2 antibodies and their relationship to disease in ANCA glomerulonephritis are not well described. We measured antiâLAMP-2 reactivity in 680 sera samples (two academic centers) from patients with ANCA glomerulonephritis (n=329); those with ANCA-negative glomerulonephritis (n=104); those with fimbriated, gram-negative Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (n=104); disease controls (n=19); and healthy volunteers (n=124). With levels in healthy controls used to define a reference range, antiâLAMP-2 reactivity was present in 21% of ANCA sera from two of the centers; reactivity was present in 16% of the control group with urinary tract infection. Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy did not verify positivity. Titers of anti-myeloperoxidase and antiâproteinase 3 antibodies were 1500-fold and 10,000-fold higher than antiâLAMP-2 titers, respectively. There was no correlation between antiâLAMP-2 antibodies and disease activity. Furthermore, Wistar Kyoto rats injected with antiâLAMP-2 antibodies did not develop glomerulonephritis. In conclusion, antibodies that react with LAMP-2 may exist at very low titers in a minority of patients with ANCA disease. These data do not support a mechanistic relationship between antiâLAMP-2 antibodies and ANCA glomerulonephritis.

EAG was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by immunization with Bordetella pertussis vaccine and homogenate of homologous kidney tissue and Freund's complete adjuvant. Progressive arteriolonephrosclerosis (ANS) was observed in right (irradiated) kidneys following unilateral renal irradiation (1500 rad).

The primary reason for this is delayed diagnosis via blood examination, urine analysis, tissue biopsy, or ultrasound and X-ray computed tomography imaging. Blood, urine, and tissue-based diagnoses can be time consuming, while ultrasound and CT imaging have relatively low spatial resolution, with reduced sensitivity. Optical coherence tomography is a noninvasive and high-resolution imaging technique that provides superior spatial resolution (micrometer scale) as compared to ultrasound and CT. Changes in tissue properties can be detected based on the optical metrics analyzed from the OCT signals, such as optical attenuation and speckle variance. Furthermore, OCT does not rely on ionizing radiation as with CT imaging. In addition to structural changes, the elasticity of the kidney can significantly change due to nephritis. In this work, OCT has been utilized to quantify the difference in tissue properties between healthy and nephritic murine kidneys. Although OCT imaging could identify the diseased tissue, its classification accuracy is clinically inadequate. By combining optical metrics with elasticity, the classification accuracy improves from 76% to 95%. These results show that OCT combined with OCE can be a powerful tool for identifying and classifying nephritis. Therefore, the OCT/OCE method could potentially be used as a minimally invasive tool for longitudinal studies during the progression and therapy of glomerulonephritis as well as complement and, perhaps, substitute highly invasive tissue biopsies.

The possible reasons for these differences include the small number of patients in the different studies, differences in the indications for renal biopsies, referral bias, geographical differences, and, sometimes, the non-availability of the necessary diagnostic facilities in the reporting centers. In order to overcome these problems, a registry for glomerulonephropathy was attempted in Saudi Arabia. Six large referral hospitals from different regions of Saudi Arabia participated in this registry. Biopsy reports and clinical information of 1294 renal biopsies were obtained. There were 782 renal biopsies due to glomerulonephritis (GN) accounting for 77.2% of the total biopsies. Five hundred eighty seven (72.6%) were primary glomerulonephritidis. Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (21.3%) and membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) (20.7%) were the most common types found in the primary glomerulonephritidis. Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) was present in only 10.6% of the cases. IgA nephropathy was found in 6.5% of the cases. Of the secondary glomerulo-nephritides, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was the most common indication for biopsy (57.0%) and amyloidosis was found in only 3.2% of the biopsies. In conclusion, FSGS and MPGN were the most common forms of primary glomerulonephritis in adult patients in Saudi Arabia. MGN was not as common as in the western world. SLE was the commonest cause of secondary GN. Amyloidosis was not as common as in other Arab countries. There is a need for more centers from Saudi Arabia to join this national GN registry. Similar registries can be established in different Arab countries, which all would, hopefully, lead to a Pan-Arab GN registry.\n\nCentral venous catheter infection-related glomerulonephritis under long-term parenteral nutrition: a report of two cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkada, Mari; Sato, Mai; Ogura, Masao; Kamei, Koichi; Matsuoka, Kentaro; Ito, Shuichi\n\n2016-03-31\n\nAdvances in long-term parenteral nutrition via indwelling central venous catheter have improved the quality of life and mortality in patients with life-threatening gastrointestinal diseases complicated with severely impaired absorption. However, infection to central venous catheter is still a common and critical complication for such patients. We encountered two patients under long-term parenteral nutrition who developed glomerulonephritis associated with central venous catheter infection. Persistent bacterial infection in indwelling medical devices placed in the blood-stream such as a ventricular-atrial shunt is known to cause glomerulonephritis, a condition termed shunt nephritis. We reported the clinical manifestations, treatment and their pathological findings in the two patients with glomerulonephritis associated with central venous catheter infection. Both patients suffered from megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, a form of pseudo-Hirschsprung's disease. They had been receiving home parenteral nutrition via central venous catheter because of severe malabsorption. They presented proteinuria, hematuria, hypocomplementemia and positive PR3-antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody accompanied by Staphylococcus epidermidis infection in the central venous catheter. Their renal biopsy revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with positive C3 deposition. One of them recovered completely following the removal of catheter and administration of antibiotics, while another did not respond to the treatments. We then treated her with methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by prednisolone. She responded well, and achieved complete remission. As central venous catheter infection-related glomerulonephritis has a similar etiology to shunt nephritis, removal of the catheter and administration of antibiotics is fundamental to the treatment. If a patient is resistant to such conventional therapy, additional steroid and/or immunosuppressive agent\n\nThe Clinical Spectrum of Renal Insufficiency During Acute Glomerulonephritis in the Adult\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLemieux, Guy; Cuvelier, Amedee A.; Lefebvre, Rene\n\n1967-01-01\n\nTwenty-seven adults with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis were divided into two groups according to the severity of reduction in renal function: (1) 14 patients with mild depression of renal function, and (2) 13 patients with more severe renal insufficiency. In the first group the outcome was favourable, with complete clinical recovery in 11 patients. Only two patients in the second group have recovered. Five have died of renal failure and in six the chronic stage has developed. The most notable histopathological lesion observed in this group of patients was severe proliferative glomerulonephritis with a large number of epithelial crescents. According to the mode of development and time of onset of renal failure, these 13 patients could be divided into three sub-groups: (1) early renal failure without oliguria (three patients), (2) early renal failure with severe oliguria or anuria (three patients) and (3) delayed renal failure (seven patients). Although there are exceptions, the development of renal insufficiency in an adult patient suffering from acute glomerulonephritis is usually associated with a guarded prognosis.

Anti-GBM GN is caused by autoantibodies (classically type G immunoglobulin) directed against the Î±3 subunit of type IV collagen. Without any appropriate treatment, the disease is generally fulminant, and patient and kidney survival is poor. The current guidelines recommend the use of plasma exchanges and immunosuppressive drugs. Immunoadsorption (IA) can remove pathogenic IgGs from the circulation and do not require plasma infusions, contrary to plasma exchanges. IA has seldom been used in adult patients with good tolerance and efficiency. We report herein the first pediatric case successfully treated with IA combined with immunosuppressive drugs in a 7-year-old girl who presented acute kidney injury (estimated glomerular filtration rate 38 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ). A kidney biopsy revealed numerous >80% glomerular crescents and linear IgG deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. Ten IA sessions led to rapid and sustained clearance of autoantibodies and improvement of kidney function until 21 months after onset (glomerular filtration rate 87 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ). No adverse effect was noted. This report adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting IA as a therapeutic alternative to plasma exchanges in anti-GBM GN. The other 27 published pediatric cases of anti-GBM GN are reviewed.

According to the results achieved the determination of the renal processes furthering homoeostasis gives the possibility to demarcate the two diseases. A certain reduction of the creatinine clearance (to less than 90 ml/min) and of the maximum water diuresis (to less than 10.0 per 100 ml glomerular filtrate) is suitable for the latent form of the chronic glomerulonephritis. On the other hand, a reduction of the ammonia secretion (to less than 35 per 100 ml glomerular (filtrate) and of the total H+-ion secretion (to less than 50 per 100 ml glomerular filtrate) in the determination after Alkinton is characteristic for the chronic pyelonephritis. In the hypertensive form of the course of the chronic glomerulonephritis in contrast to the same form in chronic pyelonephritis a reduction of the maximum water diuresis to less than 7.5, of the clearance of the \"osmotically free\" water to less than 6.0, of the titrable acidity to less than 25 is the result. Here the ammonia quotient transgresses 45%. In chronic pyelonephritis the titrable acidity in considerably increased and the ammonia genesis relatively decreased (to less than 45%).\n\nHistopathology of humorally mediated anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Hir, Michel\n\n2004-07-01\n\nFrom a diagnostic point of view it would be important to learn more about the relationship between the immune responses underlying glomerulonephritis and the patterns of glomerular lesions. A murine model of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis in which inflammation is driven by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) has been studied extensively. The aim of this study was to uncover histological features that might be specific for anti-GBM glomerulonephritis driven by a humoral immune response. BALB/c mice were immunized with rabbit IgG in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Six days later, on day 0, they received rabbit anti-GBM serum intravenously. Proteinuria was assessed with dipsticks. Mice were killed on days 4, 8 or 14. Kidneys from days 4 and 8 were processed for immunofluorescence and histology. On day 14 mice were perfusion-fixed for electron microscopy. Proteinuria started on day 3. Autologous IgG and of C3 were found along the GBM. There was only slight infiltration with macrophages and no measurable infiltration by CD4 T cells, indicating the virtual absence of DTH. Besides infiltration with neutrophils there were little histological alterations on day 4. On day 8 many loops were hyalinized. On day 14, cellular crescents were found in 23% of glomeruli. Subendothelial spaces contained hyaline material, cells and fibrin. Podocytes displayed effacement of foot processes and apical microprotrusions. Podocyte bridges were common. These alterations were identical to those reported in the standard model that produces a DTH-like inflammation. The qualitative pattern of histological damage in a murine model of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis does not depend on the underlying immunological process.\n\nCyclooxygenase metabolites mediate glomerular monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 formation and monocyte recruitment in experimental glomerulonephritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchneider, A; Harendza, S; Zahner, G; Jocks, T; Wenzel, U; Wolf, G; Thaiss, F; Helmchen, U; Stahl, R A\n\n1999-02-01\n\nMonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been shown to play a significant role in the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages in experimental glomerulonephritis. Whereas a number of inflammatory mediators have been characterized that are involved in the expression of MCP-1 in renal disease, little is known about repressors of chemokine formation in vivo. We hypothesized that cyclooxygenase (COX) products influence the formation of MCP-1 and affect inflammatory cell recruitment in glomerulonephritis. The effect of COX inhibitors was evaluated in the antithymocyte antibody model and an anti-glomerular basement membrane model of glomerulonephritis. Rats were treated with the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin and the selective COX-2 inhibitors meloxicam and SC 58125. Animals were studied at 1 hour, 24 hours, and 5 days after induction of the disease. Indomethacin, to a lesser degree the selective COX-2 inhibitors, enhanced glomerular MCP-1 and RANTES mRNA levels. Indomethacin enhanced glomerular monocyte chemoattractant activity an the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages at 24 hours and 5 days. Our studies demonstrate that COX products may serve as endogenous repressors of MCP-1 formation in experimental glomerulonephritis. The data suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 products mediate these effects differently because the selective COX-2 inhibitors had less influence on chemokine expression.\n\nThe C3aR promotes macrophage infiltration and regulates ANCA production but does not affect glomerular injury in experimental anti-myeloperoxidase glomerulonephritis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGan, Poh-Yi; Kitching, A. Richard; Holdsworth, Stephen R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides are autoimmune diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. They often affect the kidney causing rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. While signalling by complement anaphylatoxin C5a though the C5a receptor is important in this disease, the role of the anaphylatoxin C3a signalling via the C3a receptor (C3aR) is not known. Using two different murine models of anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) glomerulonephritis, one mediated by passive transfer of anti-MPO antibodies, the other by cell-mediated immunity, we found that the C3aR did not alter histological disease severity. However, it promoted macrophage recruitment to the inflamed glomerulus and inhibited the generation of MPO-ANCA whilst not influencing T cell autoimmunity. Thus, whilst the C3aR modulates some elements of disease pathogenesis, overall it is not critical in effector responses and glomerular injury caused by autoimmunity to MPO.

In 1986, he was diagnosed as having interstitial pneumonitis. Although he tested positive for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor, he had no symptoms and was followed up without therapy. Five years later, the diagnosis of Graves's disease was made after complaints of body weight loss, diplopia "
