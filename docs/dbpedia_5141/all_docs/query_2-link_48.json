        "text": "Research on the influencing factors of reverse logistics carbon footprint under sustainable development.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Qiang\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWith the concerns of ecological and circular economy along with sustainable development, reverse logistics has attracted the attention of enterprise. How to achieve sustainable development of reverse logistics has important practical significance of enhancing low carbon competitiveness. In this paper, the system boundary of reverse logistics carbon footprint is presented. Following the measurement of reverse logistics carbon footprint and reverse logistics carbon capacity is provided. The influencing factors of reverse logistics carbon footprint are classified into five parts such as intensity of reverse logistics, energy structure, energy efficiency, reverse logistics output, and product remanufacturing rate. The quantitative research methodology using ADF test, Johansen co-integration test, and impulse response is utilized to interpret the relationship between reverse logistics carbon footprint and the influencing factors more accurately. This research finds that energy efficiency, energy structure, and product remanufacturing rate are more capable of inhibiting reverse logistics carbon footprint. The statistical approaches will help practitioners in this field to structure their reverse logistics activities and also help academics in developing better decision models to reduce reverse logistics carbon footprint.\n\nReversal of infectious mononucleosis-associated suppressor T cell activity by D-mannose\n\nPubMed Central\n\n1983-01-01\n\nEpstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis (IM) is associated with the activation of suppressor T lymphocytes that profoundly inhibit immunoglobulin (Ig) production in vitro. We have examined the nature of signals operating in the interaction between IM suppressor T cells and their targets, and explored the possibility that a lectin-like receptor molecule and its specific sugar might provide specificity to this interaction. When D-mannose or some of its derivatives, including alpha- methyl-D-mannoside, mannose-6-phosphate, and mannan, were added to suppressed cultures containing IM T lymphocytes and pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated normal mononuclear cells, a significant enhancement of Ig production was observed. These sugars had little or no effect on Ig production by the PWM-stimulated responder cells alone and thus the enhanced Ig production could be attributed to the reversal of suppression in the co-cultures by these sugars. This was further confirmed by the observation that the sugars were effective only if present during the first 24 h of culture, a time when IM suppressor T cells exert their principal effect. The effect of sugars on Ig production by suppressed cultures was similar to that achieved by decreasing by about fourfold the number of IM T cells in culture. The effect of the sugars is unlikely to represent a form of nonspecific toxicity, since inhibited cultures become responders in the presence of the sugar. Furthermore, toxicity restricted to the suppressor T cells is unlikely, since preincubation of the T cells with the sugars did not reduce their subsequent ability to suppress in secondary indicator cultures. In addition, there was no correlation between the effect of the sugars on T cell proliferation and their effect on T cell-mediated suppression. The reversal of suppression by sugars was dose dependent and demonstrated stereo-specificity in that L-mannose was without effect while D-mannose reversed suppression. These data indicate\n\nMedial Prefrontal Administration of MK-801 Impairs T-maze Discrimination Reversal Learning in Weanling Rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatson, Deborah J.; Stanton, Mark E.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSeveral executive functions rely on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the rat. Aspiration and neurotoxic lesions of the mPFC impair reversal learning in adult rats [1, 16, 34, 55]. Systemic administration of MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, impairs T-maze reversal learning in weanling rats but the role of mPFC NMDA receptor antagonism in this effect is not known in either adult or young animals. This set of studies showed that mPFC NMDA receptors are specifically involved in T-maze discrimination reversal in weanling rats. In Experiment 1, 26-day-old rats (P26) demonstrated a dose-dependent impairment following bilateral mPFC administration of either 2.5 or 5.0 Âµg MK-801 or saline (vehicle) during the reversal training phase only. In Experiment 2, P26 rats were trained on the same task, but 4 groups of rats received bilateral mPFC infusions during acquisition only (MK-SAL), reversal only (SAL-MK), both phases (MK-MK) or neither phase (SAL-SAL). MK-801 impaired performance only when infused during reversal. This suggests that NMDA receptor antagonism in the mPFC is selectively involved in reversal learning during development and this may account for the previously reported effects of systemic MK-801 on T-maze discrimination reversal in weanling rats.

CD4+ T cells rely on glycolysis for inflammatory effector functions, but recent studies have shown that mitochondrial metabolism supports their chronic activation. How these processes contribute to lupus is unclear. Here, we show that both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are elevated in CD4+ T cells from lupus-prone B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3 (TC) mice as compared to non-autoimmune controls. In vitro, both the mitochondrial metabolism inhibitor metformin and the glucose metabolism inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) reduced IFNÎ³ production, although at different stages of activation. Metformin also restored the defective IL-2 production by TC CD4+ T cells. In vivo, treatment of TC mice and other lupus models with a combination of metformin and 2DG normalized T cell metabolism and reversed disease biomarkers. Further, CD4+ T cells from SLE patients also exhibited enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism that correlated with their activation status, and their excessive IFNÎ³ production was significantly reduced by metformin in vitro. These results suggest that normalization of T cell metabolism through the dual inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism is a promising therapeutic venue for SLE.

XY female development has been associated with heterozygous mutations in several genes, including SOX9, WT1 and MAP3K1. In contrast, XY sex reversal in mice usually requires complete absence of testis-determining gene products. One exception to this involves T-associated sex reversal (Tas), a phenomenon characterized by the formation of ovotestes or ovaries in XY mice hemizygous for the hairpin-tail (Thp) or T-Orleans (TOrl) deletions on proximal mouse chromosome 17. We recently reported that mice heterozygous for a null allele of Map3k4, which resides in the Thp deletion, exhibit XY ovotestis development and occasional gonadal sex reversal on the sensitized C57BL/6J-YAKR (B6-YAKR) genetic background, reminiscent of the Tas phenotype. However, these experiments did not exclude the possibility that loss of other loci in the Thp deletion, or other effects of the deletion itself, might contribute to Tas. Here, we show that disruption to Sry expression underlies XY gonadal defects in B6-YAKR embryos harbouring the Thp deletion and that a functional Map3k4 bacterial artificial chromosome rescues these abnormalities by re-establishing a normal Sry expression profile. These data demonstrate that Map3k4 haploinsufficiency is the cause of T-associated sex reversal and that levels of this signalling molecule are a major determinant of the expression profile of Sry.

B.; Utari; Purnama, B.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis paper discussed about zero field reversal probability in thermally assisted magnetization reversal (TAMR). Appearance of reversal probability in zero field investigated through micromagnetic simulation by solving stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gibert (LLG). The perpendicularly anisotropy magnetic dot of 50Ã50Ã20 nm3 is considered as single cell magnetic storage of magnetic random acces memory (MRAM). Thermally assisted magnetization reversal was performed by cooling writing process from near/almost Curie point to room temperature on 20 times runs for different randomly magnetized state. The results show that the probability reversal under zero magnetic field decreased with the increase of the energy barrier. The zero-field probability switching of 55% attained for energy barrier of 60 k B T and the reversal probability become zero noted at energy barrier of 2348 k B T. The higest zero-field switching probability of 55% attained for energy barrier of 60 k B T which corespond to magnetif field of 150 Oe for switching.\n\nSEPARATION OF T-MAZ ETHOXYLATED SORBITAN FATTY ACID ESTERS BY REVERSE PHASE CHROMATOGRAPHY\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe method for determination of T-MAZ ethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters is described.

Saturating in the presence of a gradient encodes the frequency offset spatially across a voxel. This encoding can be resolved by applying a similar gradient during readout. Acquiring additional scans with the gradient polarity reversed effectively mirrors the spatial locations of the frequency offsets so that the same physical location of a positive offset in the original scan will contribute a negative offset in the gradient-reversed scan. Gradient-reversed ultrafast z-spectroscopy (GRUFZS) was implemented and tested in a modified, localized PRESS sequence at 7T. Lysine phantoms were scanned at various concentrations and compared with coventionally-acquired z-spectra. Scans were acquired in vivo in human brain from homogeneous and inhomogeneous voxels with the ultrafast direction cycled between read, phase, and slice. Results were compared to those from a similar conventional z-spectroscopy PRESS-based sequence. Asymmetry spectra from GRUFZS are more consistent and reliable than those without gradient reversal and are comparable to those from conventional z-spectroscopy. GRUFZS offers significant acceleration in data acquisition compared to traditional chemical exchange saturation transfer methods with high spectral resolution and showed higher relative SNR effficiency. GRUFZS offers a method of collecting ultrafast z-spectra in voxels with the inhomogeneity often found in vivo. Magn Reson Med 76:1039-1046, 2016. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A widely used approach employs deletion of a nonessential gene of interest (knockout), or multi-step recombineering to move a gene of interest under a repressible promoter (knockdown). However, these genetic methods are laborious, and limited for quantitative study. Here, we report a tunable CRISPR-cas system, âtCRISPRiâ, for precise and continuous titration of gene expression by more than 30-fold. Our tCRISPRi system employs various previous advancements into a single strain: (1) We constructed a new strain containing a tunable arabinose operon promoter PBAD to quantitatively control the expression of CRISPR-(d)Cas protein over two orders of magnitude in a plasmid-free system. (2) tCRISPRi is reversible, and gene expression is repressed under knockdown conditions. (3) tCRISPRi shows significantly less than 10% leaky expression. (4) Most important from a practical perspective, construction of tCRISPRi to target a new gene requires only one-step of oligo recombineering. Our results show that tCRISPRi, in combination with recombineering, provides a simple and easy-to-implement tool for gene expression control, and is ideally suited for construction of both individual strains and high-throughput tunable knockdown libraries.\n\nChanges in transport and confinement in the EXTRAP-T2 reversed field pinch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSallander, E.; Sallander, J.; Hedqvist, A.\n\n1999-09-01\n\nAt the EXTRAP-T2 reversed field pinch a non-intrusive approach has been undertaken to monitor transport driven by magnetic fluctuations. Correlations are presented between fluctuations observed in the core and at the edge of the plasma. The fluctuations are characterized and their effect on the confinement of core electron energy is estimated.\n\nCombination nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors for treatment of HIV infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkanbi, Maxwell O; Scarsi, Kimberly K; Scarci, Kimberly; Taiwo, Babafemi; Murphy, Robert L\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe combination of two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs) and a third agent from another antiretroviral class is currently recommended for initial antiretroviral therapy. In general, N(t)RTIs remain relevant in subsequent regimens. There are currently six nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug entities available, and several formulations that include two or more N(t)RTIs in a fixed-dose combination. These entities have heterogeneous pharmacological and clinical properties. Accordingly, toxicity, pill burden, dosing frequency, potential drug-drug interaction, preexisting antiretroviral drug resistance and comorbid conditions should be considered when constructing a regimen. This approach is critical in order to optimize virologic efficacy and clinical outcomes. This article reviews N(t)RTI combinations used in the treatment of HIV-infected adults. The pharmacological properties of each N(t)RTI, and the clinical trials that have influenced treatment guidelines are discussed. It is likely that N(t)RTIs will continue to dominate the global landscape of HIV treatment and prevention, despite emerging interest in N(t)RTI-free combination therapy. Clinical domains where only few alternatives to N(t)RTIs exist include treatment of HIV/HBV coinfection and HIV-2. There is a need for novel N(t)RTIs with enhanced safety and resistance profiles compared with current N(t)RTIs.\n\nReversible and non-reversible changes in nanostructured Si in humid atmosphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhigalov, V.; Pyatilova, O.; Timoshenkov, S.; Gavrilov, S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAtmosphere water influence in the nanostructured silicon (NSS) was investigated by IR-spectroscopy and electron work function measurement. Long-term non-reversible dynamics of IR-spectra was found as a result of 100% humidity influence on the nanostructured silicon. It was indicated that air humidity affects on the work function. Dynamics of the electron work function consists of reversible and non-reversible components. Reversible component appears as strong anti-correlation between work function and humidity. Work function change of NSS is about 0.4 eV while the humidity changes between 0% and 100%. Reversible component can be explained by physical sorption of water molecules on the surface. Non-reversible component manifests as long-term decreasing trend of work function in humid atmosphere. Transition curve during abruptly humidity changes alters its shape. Non-reversible component can be explained by chemisorption of water.\n\nDeveloping tTA Transgenic Rats for Inducible and Reversible Gene Expression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Hongxia; Huang, Cao; Yang, Min; Landel, Carlisle P; Xia, Pedro Yuxing; Liu, Yong-Jian; Xia, Xu Gang\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo develop transgenic lines for conditional expression of desired genes in rats, we generated several lines of the transgenic rats carrying the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) gene. Using a vigorous, ubiquitous promoter to drive the tTA transgene, we obtained widespread expression of tTA in various tissues. Expression of tTA was sufficient to strongly activate its reporter gene, but was below the toxicity threshold. We examined the dynamics of Doxycycline (Dox)-regulated gene expression in transgenic rats. In the two transmittable lines, tTA-mediated activation of the reporter gene was fully subject to regulation by Dox. Dox dose-dependently suppressed tTA-activated gene expression. The washout time for the effects of Dox was dose-dependent. We tested a complex regime of Dox administration to determine the optimal effectiveness and washout duration. Dox was administered at a high dose (500 Î¼g/ml in drinking water) for two days to reach the effective concentration, and then was given at a low dose (20 Î¼g/ml) to maintain effectiveness. This regimen of Dox administration can achieve a quick switch between ON and OFF statuses of tTA-activated gene expression. In addition, administration of Dox to pregnant rats fully suppressed postnatal tTA-activated gene expression in their offspring. Sufficient levels of Dox are present in mother's milk to produce maximal efficacy in nursing neonates. Administration of Dox to pregnant or nursing rats can provide a continual suppression of tTA-dependent gene expression during embryonic and postnatal development. The tTA transgenic rat allows for inducible and reversible gene expression in the rat; this important tool will be valuable in the development of genetic rat models of human diseases.

Therefore, understanding removal torque values is essential. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reverse torque values of indexed and nonindexed abutments of the Morse Taper system. Twelve Morse taper implants with their respective abutments were divided into 2 groups (n=6): group NI, nonindexed abutments; and group IN, indexed abutments. Each abutment received a sequence of 2 consecutive torques for insertion (15 Ncm) at an interval of 10 minutes, and 1 reverse torque, all measured with a digital torque wrench. The Student t test with a 5% significance level was used to evaluate the data. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in reverse torque values between nonindexed and indexed abutments (P=.57). When comparing insertion torque and reverse torque values between the groups, group NI presented a mean torque loosening percentage of 8% (P=.013), whereas group IN presented a loosening of 15.33% (P<.001). The use of indexed abutments for the Morse taper system presented similar biomechanical stability when compared with nonindexed abutments, both with a significant reduction in reverse torque values.

Accurate expression profiling is crucial for understanding the biological roles of miRNAs, and exploring them as biomarkers of diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings A novel, highly sensitive, and reliable miRNA quantification approach,termed S-Poly(T) miRNA assay, is designed. In this assay, miRNAs are subjected to polyadenylation and reverse transcription with a S-Poly(T) primer that contains a universal reverse primer, a universal Taqman probe, an oligo(dT)11 sequence and six miRNA-specific bases. Individual miRNAs are then amplified by a specific forward primer and a universal reverse primer, and the PCR products are detected by a universal Taqman probe. The S-Poly(T) assay showed a minimum of 4-fold increase in sensitivity as compared with the stem-loop or poly(A)-based methods. A remarkable specificity in discriminating among miRNAs with high sequence similarity was also obtained with this approach. Using this method, we profiled miRNAs in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) and identified 9 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with hypoxia treatment. Due to its outstanding sensitivity, the number of circulating miRNAs from normal human serum was significantly expanded from 368 to 518. Conclusions/Significance With excellent sensitivity, specificity, and high-throughput, the S-Poly(T) method provides a powerful tool for miRNAs quantification and identification of tissue- or disease-specific miRNA biomarkers.

This property depends on nuclear import of the intracellular reverse transcription and pre-integration complexes (RTCs/PICs). To identify cellular factors involved in nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, cytosolic extracts were fractionated by chromatography and import activity examined by the nuclear import assay. A near-homogeneous fraction was obtained, which was active in inducing nuclear import of purified and labeled RTCs. The active fraction contained tRNAs, mostly with defective 3' CCA ends. Such tRNAs promoted HIV-1 RTC nuclear import when synthesized in vitro. Active tRNAs were incorporated into and recovered from virus particles. Mutational analyses indicated that the anticodon loop mediated binding to the viral complex whereas the T-arm may interact with cellular factors involved in nuclear import. These tRNA species efficiently accumulated into the nucleus on their own in a energy- and temperature-dependent way. An HIV-1 mutant containing MLV gag did not incorporate tRNA species capable of inducing HIV-1 RTC nuclear import and failed to infect cell cycle-arrested cells. Here we provide evidence that at least some tRNA species can be imported into the nucleus of human cells and promote HIV-1 nuclear import.\n\nCurcumin reverses T cell-mediated adaptive immune dysfunctions in tumor-bearing hosts.\n\nPubMed\n\nBhattacharyya, Sankar; Md Sakib Hossain, Dewan; Mohanty, Suchismita; Sankar Sen, Gouri; Chattopadhyay, Sreya; Banerjee, Shuvomoy; Chakraborty, Juni; Das, Kaushik; Sarkar, Diptendra; Das, Tanya; Sa, Gaurisankar\n\n2010-07-01\n\nImmune dysfunction is well documented during tumor progression and likely contributes to tumor immune evasion. CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are involved in antigen-specific tumor destruction and CD4(+) T cells are essential for helping this CD8(+) T cell-dependent tumor eradication. Tumors often target and inhibit T-cell function to escape from immune surveillance. This dysfunction includes loss of effector and memory T cells, bias towards type 2 cytokines and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells. Curcumin has previously been shown to have antitumor activity and some research has addressed the immunoprotective potential of this plant-derived polyphenol in tumor-bearing hosts. Here we examined the role of curcumin in the prevention of tumor-induced dysfunction of T cell-based immune responses. We observed severe loss of both effector and memory T-cell populations, downregulation of type 1 and upregulation of type 2 immune responses and decreased proliferation of effector T cells in the presence of tumors. Curcumin, in turn, prevented this loss of T cells, expanded central memory T cell (T(CM))/effector memory T cell (T(EM)) populations, reversed the type 2 immune bias and attenuated the tumor-induced inhibition of T-cell proliferation in tumor-bearing hosts. Further investigation revealed that tumor burden upregulated Treg cell populations and stimulated the production of the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10 in these cells. Curcumin, however, inhibited the suppressive activity of Treg cells by downregulating the production of TGF-beta and IL-10 in these cells. More importantly, curcumin treatment enhanced the ability of effector T cells to kill cancer cells. Overall, our observations suggest that the unique properties of curcumin may be exploited for successful attenuation of tumor-induced suppression of cell-mediated immune responses.\n\nResistive wall modes in the EXTRAP T2R reversed-field pinch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrunsell, P. R.; Malmberg, J.-A.; Yadikin, D.; Cecconello, M.\n\n2003-10-01\n\nResistive wall modes (RWM) in the reversed field pinch are studied and a detailed comparison of experimental growth rates and linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory is made. RWM growth rates are experimentally measured in the thin shell device EXTRAP T2R [P. R. Brunsell et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 43, 1 (2001)]. Linear MHD calculations of RWM growth rates are based on experimental equilibria. Experimental and linear MHD RWM growth rate dependency on the equilibrium profiles is investigated experimentally by varying the pinch parameter Î=BÎ¸(a)/ in the range Î=1.5-1.8. Quantitative agreement between experimental and linear MHD growth rates is seen. The dominating RWMs are the internal on-axis modes (having the same helicity as the central equilibrium field). At high Î, external nonresonant modes are also observed. For internal modes experimental growth rates decrease with Î while for external modes, growth rates increase with Î. The effect of RWMs on the reversed-field pinch plasma performance is discussed.\n\nParameters influencing focalization spot in time reversal of acoustic waves\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZophoniasson, Harald; Bolzmacher, Christian; Hafez, Moustafa\n\n2015-05-01\n\nTime reversal is an approach that can be used to focus acoustic waves in a particular location on a surface, allowing a multitouch tactile feedback interaction. The spatial resolution in this case depends on several parameters, such as geometrical parameters, frequency used and material properties, described by the Lamb wave theory. This paper highlights the impact of frequency, geometrical parameters such as plate thickness and transducer's surface on the focused spot dimensions. In this paper a study of the influence of the plate's thickness and the frequency bandwidth used in the focusing process is presented. It is also shown that the dimension of the piezoelectric diaphragms used has little influence on the spatial resolution. Resonant behavior of the plate and its implication on focus point dimension and focalization contrast were investigated.\n\nA reversion of an IL2RG mutation in combined immunodeficiency providing competitive advantage to the majority of CD8+ T cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuijpers, Taco W; van Leeuwen, Ester M M; Barendregt, Barbara H; Klarenbeek, Paul; aan de Kerk, Daan J; Baars, Paul A; Jansen, Machiel H; de Vries, Niek; van Lier, RenÃ© A W; van der Burg, Mirjam\n\n2013-07-01\n\nMutations in the common gamma chain (Î³c, CD132, encoded by the IL2RG gene) can lead to B(+)T(-)NK(-) X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, as a consequence of unresponsiveness to Î³c-cytokines such as interleukins-2, -7 and -15. Hypomorphic mutations in CD132 may cause combined immunodeficiencies with a variety of clinical presentations. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a 6-year-old boy with normal lymphocyte counts, who suffered from recurrent pneumonia and disseminated mollusca contagiosa. Since proliferative responses of T cells and NK cells to Î³c -cytokines were severely impaired, we performed IL2RG gene analysis, showing a heterozygous mutation in the presence of a single X-chromosome. Interestingly, an IL2RG reversion to normal predominated in both naÃ¯ve and antigen-primed CD8(+) T cells and increased over time. Only the revertant CD8(+) T cells showed normal expression of CD132 and the various CD8(+) T cell populations had a different T-cell receptor repertoire. Finally, a fraction of Î³Î´(+) T cells and differentiated CD4(+)CD27(-) effector-memory T cells carried the reversion, whereas NK or B cells were repeatedly negative. In conclusion, in a patient with a novel IL2RG mutation, gene-reverted CD8(+) T cells accumulated over time. Our data indicate that selective outgrowth of particular T-cell subsets may occur following reversion at the level of committed T progenitor cells.\n\nStructural basis of reverse nucleotide polymerization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNakamura, Akiyoshi; Nemoto, Taiki; Heinemann, Ilka U.; Yamashita, Keitaro; Sonoda, Tomoyo; Komoda, Keisuke; Tanaka, Isao; SÃ¶ll, Dieter; Yao, Min\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNucleotide polymerization proceeds in the forward (5â²-3â²) direction. This tenet of the central dogma of molecular biology is found in diverse processes including transcription, reverse transcription, DNA replication, and even in lagging strand synthesis where reverse polymerization (3â²-5â²) would present a âsimplerâ solution. Interestingly, reverse (3â²-5â²) nucleotide addition is catalyzed by the tRNA maturation enzyme tRNAHis guanylyltransferase, a structural homolog of canonical forward polymerases. We present a Candida albicans tRNAHis guanylyltransferase-tRNAHis complex structure that reveals the structural basis of reverse polymerization. The directionality of nucleotide polymerization is determined by the orientation of approach of the nucleotide substrate. The tRNA substrate enters the enzymeâs active site from the opposite direction (180Â° flip) compared with similar nucleotide substrates of canonical 5â²-3â² polymerases, and the finger domains are on opposing sides of the core palm domain. Structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic data indicate that reverse polymerization appeared early in evolution and resembles a mirror image of the forward process.

The localized initial wave packet at time t = 0 diffuses as time proceeds until the time-reversal operation, together with the momentum perturbation of the strength Î·, is made at the reversal time T. The time irreversibility is measured by I = |Î ( t = 2 T) - Î ( t = 0)|, where Î is the participation ratio gauging the extendedness of the wavefunction and for convenience, t is measured forward even after the time reversal. When Î· = 0, the time evolution after T makes the wavefunction at t = 2 T identical to the one at t = 0, and we find I = 0, implying a null irreversibility or a complete reversibility. On the other hand, as Î· is increased from zero, the reversibility becomes weaker, and we observe enhancement of the irreversibility. We find that I linearly increases with increasing Î· in the weakly-perturbed region, and that the irreversibility is much stronger in the WS network than in the local regular network.\n\nThe specificity and flexibility of l1 reverse transcription priming at imperfect T-tracts.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonot, ClÃ©ment; Kuciak, Monika; Viollet, SÃ©bastien; Mir, Ashfaq Ali; Gabus, Caroline; Darlix, Jean-Luc; Cristofari, GaÃ«l\n\n2013-05-01\n\nL1 retrotransposons have a prominent role in reshaping mammalian genomes. To replicate, the L1 ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) first uses its endonuclease (EN) to nick the genomic DNA. The newly generated DNA end is subsequently used as a primer to initiate reverse transcription within the L1 RNA poly(A) tail, a process known as target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Prior studies demonstrated that most L1 insertions occur into sequences related to the L1 EN consensus sequence (degenerate 5'-TTTT/A-3' sites) and frequently preceded by imperfect T-tracts. However, it is currently unclear whether--and to which degree--the liberated 3'-hydroxyl extremity on the genomic DNA needs to be accessible and complementary to the poly(A) tail of the L1 RNA for efficient priming of reverse transcription. Here, we employed a direct assay for the initiation of L1 reverse transcription to define the molecular rules that guide this process. First, efficient priming is detected with as few as 4 matching nucleotides at the primer 3' end. Second, L1 RNP can tolerate terminal mismatches if they are compensated within the 10 last bases of the primer by an increased number of matching nucleotides. All terminal mismatches are not equally detrimental to DNA extension, a C being extended at higher levels than an A or a G. Third, efficient priming in the context of duplex DNA requires a 3' overhang. This suggests the possible existence of additional DNA processing steps, which generate a single-stranded 3' end to allow L1 reverse transcription. Based on these data we propose that the specificity of L1 reverse transcription initiation contributes, together with the specificity of the initial EN cleavage, to the distribution of new L1 insertions within the human genome.\n\nThe Specificity and Flexibility of L1 Reverse Transcription Priming at Imperfect T-Tracts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nViollet, SÃ©bastien; Mir, Ashfaq Ali; Gabus, Caroline; Darlix, Jean-Luc; Cristofari, GaÃ«l\n\n2013-01-01\n\nL1 retrotransposons have a prominent role in reshaping mammalian genomes.

Hypomorphic mutations in CD132 may cause combined immunodeficiencies with a variety of clinical presentations. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a 6-year-old boy with normal lymphocyte counts, who suffered from recurrent pneumonia and disseminated mollusca contagiosa. Since proliferative responses of T cells and NK cells to Î³c -cytokines were severely impaired, we performed IL2RG gene analysis, showing a heterozygous mutation in the presence of a single X-chromosome. Interestingly, an IL2RG reversion to normal predominated in both naÃ¯ve and antigen-primed CD8+ T cells and increased over time. Only the revertant CD8+ T cells showed normal expression of CD132 and the various CD8+ T cell populations had a different T-cell receptor repertoire. Finally, a fraction of Î³Î´+ T cells and differentiated CD4+CD27â effector-memory T cells carried the reversion, whereas NK or B cells were repeatedly negative. In conclusion, in a patient with a novel IL2RG mutation, gene-reverted CD8+ T cells accumulated over time. Our data indicate that selective outgrowth of particular T-cell subsets may occur following reversion at the level of committed T progenitor cells.

In contrast, the current study of subchronic TCE exposure showed that midway in the disease process both of these parameters of CD4+ T cell activation were reversed. This phase of the disease process may represent an attempt by the body to counteract the inflammatory effects of TCE. The decrease in CD4+ T cell production of IFN-Î³ following subchronic TCE exposure could not be attributed to skewing toward a Th2 or Th17 phenotype or to an increase in Treg cells. Instead, the suppression corresponded to alterations in markers used to assess DNA methylation, namely increased expression of retrotransposons Iap (intracisternal A particle) and Muerv (murine endogenous retrovirus). Also observed was an increase in the expression of Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase-1) and decreased expression of several genes known to be downregulated by DNA methylation, namely Ifng, Il2, and Cdkn1a. CD4+ T cells from a second study in which MRL+/+ mice were treated for 17 weeks with TCE showed a similar increase in Iap and decrease in Cdkn1a. In addition, DNA collected from the CD4+ T cells in the second study showed TCE-decreased global DNA methylation. Thus, these results described the biphasic nature of TCE-induced alterations in CD4+ T cell function and suggested that these changes represented potentially reversible alterations in epigenetic processes.

MIEE and 3Î²-taraxerol were evaluated for their ability to restore impaired glucose uptake and, expression of molecular markers in the insulin signaling pathway induced by DEX in 3T3L1 adipocytes using 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H] glucose uptake assay and ELISA. An insulin resistant model has been developed using a glucocorticoid, DEX on 3T3L1 adipocytes. Insulin resistant condition was observed at 24h of DEX induction wherein a maximum degree of resistance of about 50% was measured based on inhibition of glucose uptake, which was confirmed using cytotoxicity analysis. The developed model of insulin resistance was studied in comparison to positive control rosiglitazone. DEX induced inhibition of glucose uptake and the expression of insulin signaling markers GLUT4 and PI3K were found to be restored by 3Î²-taraxerol and MIEE, thus delineating its mechanism of action in the reversal of insulin resistance. 3Î²-Taraxerol effectively restored DEX induced desensitization via restoration of PI3K and GLUT4 expression. To conclude, since 3Î²-taraxerol exhibits significant effect in reversing insulin resistance it can be further investigated as an insulin resistance reversal agent. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Pre-post study in 8-14 years old overweight or obese and low active children from Vilafranca del PenedÃ¨s (Barcelona, Spain) randomized in control group (n = 51, 47.1% girls, nutritional intervention and â¤3h/wk physical activity) and ACTIVA'T group (n = 45, 37.8% girls, nutritional and physical activity â¥5h/wk intervention). Body mass index, waist/height index, and diet quality by means of KIDMED test at the beginning and at the end of the program were assessed. During the intervention, each participant was accompanied by a relative (father or mother) who performed the same activities as the children. Dietary recommendations have positively changed the habits of both ACTIVA'T and control group. The reversion in the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 93.8% and 58.6%, respectively, in the ACTIVA'T group, compared to 25.0% and 35.8% in the control group. Abdominal obesity was decreased from 42.2% to 17.8% in the ACTIVA'T group and from 47.1% to 27.5% in the control group. The program ACTIVA'T (nutritional education and physical activity promotion) improves the quality of diet and reverses the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the underactive child population.

Two homoplasmic mitochondrial tRNA mutations (m.14674T>C/G in mt-tRNA(Glu)) have been reported to cause severe infantile mitochondrial myopathy in the first months of life. If these patients survive the first year of life by extensive life-sustaining measures they usually recover and develop normally. Another mitochondrial disease due to deficiency of the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase (TRMU) causes severe liver failure in infancy, but similar to the reversible mitochondrial myopathy, within the first year of life these infants may also recover completely. Partial recovery has been noted in some other rare forms of mitochondrial disease due to deficiency of mitochondrial tRNA synthetases and mitochondrial tRNA modifying enzymes. Here we summarize the clinical presentation of these unique reversible mitochondrial diseases and discuss potential molecular mechanisms behind the reversibility. Understanding these mechanisms may provide the key to treatments of potential broader relevance in mitochondrial disease, where for the majority of the patients no effective treatment is currently available.\n\nReverse engineering of TLX oncogenic transcriptional networks identifies RUNX1 as tumor suppressor in T-ALL.\n\nPubMed\n\nDella Gatta, Giusy; Palomero, Teresa; Perez-Garcia, Arianne; Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto; Bansal, Mukesh; Carpenter, Zachary W; De Keersmaecker, Kim; Sole, Xavier; Xu, Luyao; Paietta, Elisabeth; Racevskis, Janis; Wiernik, Peter H; Rowe, Jacob M; Meijerink, Jules P; Califano, Andrea; Ferrando, Adolfo A\n\n2012-02-26\n\nThe TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factor oncogenes have a key role in the pathogenesis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This systems biology analysis defined T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1) and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, a network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as a key mediator of the T-ALL induced by TLX1 and TLX3 and predicted a tumor-suppressor role for RUNX1 in T cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 at the top of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, show the power of network analyses to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor-suppressor gene in T-ALL.\n\nTeaching foundational perspective-taking skills to children with autism using the PEAK-T curriculum: single-reversal \"I-You\" deictic frames.\n\nPubMed\n\nBelisle, Jordan; Dixon, Mark R; Stanley, Caleb R; Munoz, Bridget; Daar, Jacob H\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe taught basic perspective-taking tasks to 3 children with autism and evaluated their ability to derive mutually entailed single-reversal deictic relations of those newly established perspective-taking skills. Furthermore, we examined the possibility of transfers of perspective-taking function to novel untrained stimuli. The methods were taken from the PEAK-T training curriculum, and results yielded positive gains for all 3 children to learn basic perspective taking as well as for 2 of the 3 to derive untrained single-reversal I relations following direct training of single-reversal You relations. All participants demonstrated a transfer of stimulus function to untrained stimuli after the single-reversal deictic relations had been mastered.

Radial profiles of main plasma parameters are obtained and compared with those of the previous device Extrap-T2. The spontaneous setting up of a double shear layer of EÃB toroidal velocity is confirmed. The particle flux induced by electrostatic fluctuations is calculated and the resulting effective diffusion coefficient is consistent with the Bohm estimate. A close relationship between electrostatic fluctuations at the edge and non-linear coupling of MHD modes in the core is found.\n\nLocal and Systemic CD4+ T Cell Exhaustion Reverses with Clinical Resolution of Pulmonary Sarcoidosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHawkins, Charlene; Shaginurova, Guzel; Shelton, D. Auriel; Herazo-Maya, Jose D.; Oswald-Richter, Kyra A.; Young, Anjuli; Celada, Lindsay J.; Kaminski, Naftali; Sevin, Carla\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInvestigation of the Th1 immune response in sarcoidosis CD4+ T cells has revealed reduced proliferative capacity and cytokine expression upon TCR stimulation. In other disease models, such cellular dysfunction has been associated with a step-wise, progressive loss of T cell function that results from chronic antigenic stimulation. T cell exhaustion is defined by decreased cytokine production upon TCR activation, decreased proliferation, increased expression of inhibitory cell surface receptors, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. We characterized sarcoidosis CD4+ T cell immune function in systemic and local environments among subjects undergoing disease progression compared to those experiencing disease resolution. Spontaneous and TCR-stimulated Th1 cytokine expression and proliferation assays were performed in 53 sarcoidosis subjects and 30 healthy controls. PD-1 expression and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. Compared to healthy controls, sarcoidosis CD4+ T cells demonstrated reductions in Th1 cytokine expression, proliferative capacity (p < 0.05), enhanced apoptosis (p < 0.01), and increased PD-1 expression (p < 0.001). BAL-derived CD4+ T cells also demonstrated multiple facets of T cell exhaustion (p < 0.05). Reversal of CD4+ T cell exhaustion was observed in subjects undergoing spontaneous resolution (p < 0.05). Sarcoidosis CD4+ T cells exhibit loss of cellular function during progressive disease that follows the archetype of T cell exhaustion.

R.; Paccagnella, R.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nPrevious experiments in the EXTRAP T2R reversed field pinch device have shown the possibility of suppression of multiple resistive wall modes (RWM). A feedback system has been installed in EXTRAP T2R having 100% coverage of the toroidal surface by the active coil array. Predictions based on theory and the previous experimental results show that the number of active coils should be sufficient for independent stabilization of all unstable RWMs in the EXTRAP T2R. Experiments using different feedback schemes are performed, comparing the intelligent shell, the fake rotating shell, and the mode control with complex feedback gains. Stabilization of all unstable RWMs throughout the discharge duration of tdâ10Ïw is seen using the intelligent shell feedback scheme. Mode rotation and the control of selected Fourier harmonics is obtained simultaneously using the mode control scheme with complex gains. Different sensor signals are studied. A feedback system with toroidal magnetic field sensors could have an advantage of lower feedback gain needed for the RWM suppression compared to the system with radial magnetic field sensors. In this study, RWM suppression is demonstrated, using also the toroidal field component as a sensor signal in the feedback system.\n\nA Subset of Latency-Reversing Agents Expose HIV-Infected Resting CD4+ T-Cells to Recognition by Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJones, R.

These cells express little to no viral protein, and thus neither die by viral cytopathic effects, nor are efficiently cleared by immune effectors. Elimination of this reservoir is theoretically possible by combining latency-reversing agents (LRAs) with immune effectors, such as CD8+ T-cells. However, the relative efficacy of different LRAs in sensitizing latently-infected cells for recognition by HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells has not been determined. To address this, we developed an assay that utilizes HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell clones as biosensors for HIV antigen expression. By testing multiple CD8+ T-cell clones against a primary cell model of HIV latency, we identified several single agents that primed latently-infected cells for CD8+ T-cell recognition, including IL-2, IL-15, two IL-15 superagonists (IL-15SA and ALT-803), prostratin, and the TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4. In contrast, we did not observe CD8+ T-cell recognition of target cells following treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors or with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In further experiments we demonstrate that a clinically achievable concentration of the IL-15 superagonist âALT-803â, an agent presently in clinical trials for solid and hematological tumors, primes the natural ex vivo reservoir for CD8+ T-cell recognition. Thus, our results establish a novel experimental approach for comparative evaluation of LRAs, and highlight ALT-803 as an LRA with the potential to synergize with CD8+ T-cells in HIV eradication strategies.

This paper researched the influences of reverse outsourcing on green technological progress from the perspective of a global supply chain by using micro-data of enterprises. It worked out the rate of green technological progress from two innovative concepts: potential production technology and practical production technology. The empirical analysis results indicated that reverse outsourcing stimulates, and enterprise size and ownership type potentially affects, green technological progress. State-owned or foreign enterprises with high income levels would pay more attention to environmental protection, energy saving, and emission reduction, while small and micro enterprises with low incomes would choose to ignore environmental protection.

Though a significant number of works have been done on reversible combinational logic, the realization of reversible sequential circuit is still at premature stage. Reversible counter is not only an important part of the sequential circuit but also an essential part of the quantum circuit system. In this paper, we designed two kinds of novel reversible counters. In order to construct counter, the innovative reversible T Flip-flop Gate (TFG), T Flip-flop block (T_FF) and JK flip-flop block (JK_FF) are proposed. Based on the above blocks and some existing reversible gates, the 4-bit binary-coded decimal (BCD) counter and controlled Up/Down synchronous counter are designed. With the help of Verilog hardware description language (Verilog HDL), these counters above have been modeled and confirmed. According to the simulation results, our circuits' logic structures are validated. Compared to the existing ones in terms of quantum cost (QC), delay (DL) and garbage outputs (GBO), it can be concluded that our designs perform better than the others. There is no doubt that they can be used as a kind of important storage components to be applied in future low-power computing systems.\n\nReversible and irreversible heat engine and refrigerator cycles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeff, Harvey S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAlthough no reversible thermodynamic cycles exist in nature, nearly all cycles covered in textbooks are reversible. This is a review, clarification, and extension of results and concepts for quasistatic, reversible and irreversible processes and cycles, intended primarily for teachers and students. Distinctions between the latter process types are explained, with emphasis on clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) cycles. Specific examples of each are examined, including Carnot, Kelvin and Stirling cycles. For the Stirling cycle, potentially useful task-specific efficiency measures are proposed and illustrated. Whether a cycle behaves as a traditional refrigerator or heat engine can depend on whether it is reversible or irreversible. Reversible and irreversible-quasistatic CW cycles both satisfy Carnot's inequality for thermal efficiency, Î· â¤ Î· C a r n o t . Irreversible CCW cycles with two reservoirs satisfy the coefficient of performance inequality K â¤ K C a r n o t . However, an arbitrary reversible cycle satisfies K â¥ K C a r n o t when compared with a reversible Carnot cycle operating between its maximum and minimum temperatures, a potentially counterintuitive result.\n\nEffects of protein tyrosine phosphatase-PEST are reversed by Akt in T cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nArimura, Yutaka; Shimizu, Kazuhiko; Koyanagi, Madoka; Yagi, Junji\n\n2014-12-01\n\nT cell activation is regulated by a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that is under the control of kinases and phosphatases. Here, we examined the role of a non-receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-PEST, using retrovirus-mediated gene transduction into murine T cells. Based on observations of vector markers (GFP or Thy1.1), exogenous PTP-PEST-positive CD4(+) T cells appeared within 2 days after gene transduction; the percentage of PTP-PEST-positive cells tended to decrease during a resting period in the presence of IL-2 over the next 2 days. These vector markers also showed much lower expression intensities, compared with control cells, suggesting a correlation between the percent reduction and the low marker expression intensity. A catalytically inactive PTP-PEST mutant also showed the same tendency, and stepwise deletion mutants gradually lost their ability to induce the above phenomenon. On the other hand, these PTP-PEST-transduced cells did not have an apoptotic phenotype. No difference in the total cell numbers was found in the wells of a culture plate containing VEC- and PTP-PEST-transduced T cells. Moreover, serine/threonine kinase Akt, but not the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, reversed the phenotype induced by PTP-PEST. We discuss the novel mechanism by which Akt interferes with PTP-PEST. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To compare isotropic 3D T2-weighted (T2W) turbo spin-echo sequence (TSE-SPACE) with standard two-dimensional (2D) T2W TSE imaging for evaluating lumbar spine pathology at 3.0âT MRI. Forty-two patients who had spine surgery for disk herniation and had 3.0âT spine MRI were included in this study. In addition to standard 2D T2W TSE imaging, sagittal 3D T2W TSE-SPACE was obtained to produce multiplanar (MPR) images. Each set of MR images from 3D T2W TSE and 2D TSE-SPACE were independently scored for the degree of lumbar neural foraminal stenosis, central spinal stenosis, and nerve compression by two reviewers. These scores were compared with operative findings and the sensitivities were evaluated by McNemar test. Inter-observer agreements and the correlation with symptoms laterality were assessed with kappa statistics. The 3D T2W TSE and 2D TSE-SPACE had similar sensitivity in detecting foraminal stenosis (78.9% versus 78.9% in 32 foramen levels), spinal stenosis (100% versus 100% in 42 spinal levels), and nerve compression (92.9% versus 81.8% in 59 spinal nerves). The inter-observer agreements (Îºâ=â0.849 vs. 0.451 for foraminal stenosis, Îºâ=â0.809 vs. 0.503 for spinal stenosis, and Îºâ=â0.681 vs. 0.429 for nerve compression) and symptoms correlation (Îºâ=â0.449 vs. Îºâ=â0.242) were better in 3D TSE-SPACE compared to 2D TSE. 3D TSE-SPACE with oblique coronal MPR images demonstrated better inter-observer agreements compared to 3D TSE-SPACE without oblique coronal MPR images (Îºâ=â0.930 vs. Îºâ=â0.681). Isotropic 3D T2W TSE-SPACE at 3.0âT was comparable to 2D T2W TSE for detecting foraminal stenosis, central spinal stenosis, and nerve compression with better inter-observer agreements and symptom correlation.

Despite this, only 20% of patients respond to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Lack of induction of innate immunity through pattern-recognition receptors such as the stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) receptor may represent a significant barrier to the development of effective antitumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate robust control of a T-cell inflamed (MOC1), but not non-T-cell inflamed (MOC2), model of head and neck cancer by activation of the STING pathway with the synthetic cyclic dinucleotide RP,RP dithio-c-di-GMP. Rejection or durable tumor control of MOC1 tumors was dependent upon a functional STING receptor and CD8 T lymphocytes. STING activation resulted in increased tumor microenvironment type 1 and type 2 IFN and greater expression of PD-1âpathway components in vivo. Established MOC1 tumors were rejected and distant tumors abscopally controlled, after adaptive immune resistance had been reversed by the addition of PD-L1 mAb. These findings suggest that PD-1-pathway blockade may reverse adaptive immune resistance following cyclic dinucleotide treatment, enhancing both local and systemic antitumor immunity.

The very fast polarity-reversal with a rise time of 20ns is caused by direct grounding of a charged coaxial cable of 10m in length. Influence of voltage rise time on energy efficiency for NO removal is studied. Results of NO removal using a barrier-type plasma reactor with screw-plane electrode system indicates that the energy efficiency for the very fast polarity reversal caused by direct grounding becomes higher than that for the slower polarity reversal caused by grounding through an inductor at the cable end. The energy efficiency for the direct grounding is about 80g/kWh for 50% NO removal ratio and is about 60g/kWh for 100% NO removal ratio. Very intense discharge light is observed at the initial time of 10ns for the fast polarity reversal, whereas the intensity in the initial discharge light for the slower polarity reversal is relatively small. To confirm the effectiveness of the polarity-reversed pulse application, comparison of the energy efficiency between the polarity-reversed voltage pulse and ac 60Hz voltage will be presented.\n\nImpurity profiles and radial transport in the EXTRAP-T2 reversed field pinch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSallander, J.\n\n1999-05-01\n\nRadially resolved spectroscopy has been used to measure the radial distribution of impurity ions (O III-O V and C III-CVI) in the EXTRAP-T2 reversed field pinch (RFP). The radial profile of the emission is reconstructed from line emission measured along five lines of sight. The ion density profile is the fitted quantity in the reconstruction of the brightness profile and is thus obtained directly in this process. These measurements are then used to adjust the parameters in transport calculations in order to obtain consistency with the observed ion density profiles. Comparison between model and measurements show that a radial dependence in the diffusion is needed to explain the measured ion densities.\n\nSpontaneous quasi single helicity regimes in EXTRAP T2R reversed-field pinch\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrassinetti, L.; Brunsell, P. R.; Drake, J. R.; Menmuir, S.; Cecconello, M.\n\n2007-11-01\n\nIn recent years, good progress toward a better understanding and control of the plasma performance in reversed-field pinch devices has been made. These improvements consist both of the discovery of spontaneous plasma regimes, termed the quasi single helicity (QSH) regime, in which part of the plasma core is no longer stochastic, and of the development of techniques for active control of plasma instabilities. In this paper, a systematic study of spontaneous QSH in the EXTRAP T2R device [P. R. Brunsell, H. Bergsaker, M. Cecconello et al., Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 43, 1457 (2001)] is presented. In this device, QSH states can occur spontaneously and it is associated with magnetic and thermal structures. A statistical analysis to determine the most favorable experimental conditions to have a transition to the QSH regime will be presented. The results described here are useful to understand the underlying properties of QSH regimes in view of future applications of the QSH active control in EXTRAP T2R; they are also important to have a comparison with the QSH studied in other devices.\n\nInfluence of gold nanoparticles of varying size in improving the lipase activity within cationic reverse micelles.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaiti, Subhabrata; Das, Dibyendu; Shome, Anshupriya; Das, Prasanta Kumar\n\n2010-02-08\n\nHerein, we report the effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in enhancing lipase activity in reverse micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/water/isooctane/n-hexanol. The size and concentration of the nanoparticles were varied and their specific roles were assessed in detail. An overall enhancement of activity was observed in the GNP-doped CTAB reverse micelles. The improvement in activity becomes more prominent with increasing concentration and size of the GNPs (0-52 microM and ca. 3-30 nm, respectively). The observed highest lipase activity (k(2)=1070+/-12 cm(3) g(-1) s(-1)) in GNP-doped CTAB reverse micelles ([GNP]: 52 microm, ca. 20 nm) is 2.5-fold higher than in CTAB reverse micelles without GNPs. Improvement in the lipase activity is only specific to the GNP-doped reverse micellar media, whereas GNP deactivates and structurally deforms the enzyme in aqueous media. The reason for this activation is probably due to the formation of larger-sized reverse micelles in which the GNP acts as a polar core and the surfactants aggregate around the nanoparticle ('GNP pool') instead of only water. Lipase at the augmented interface of the GNP-doped reverse micelle showed improved activity because of enhancement in both the substrate and enzyme concentrations and increased flexibility in the lipase conformation. The extent of the activation is greater in the case of the larger-sized GNPs. A correlation has been established between the activity of lipase and its secondary structure by using circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopic analysis. The generalized influence of GNP is verified in the reverse micelles of another surfactant, namely, cetyltripropylammonium bromide (CTPAB). TEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and UV/Vis spectroscopic analysis were utilized to characterize the GNPs and the organized aggregates. For the first time, CTAB-based reverse micelles have been found to be an excellent host for lipase simply by doping with appropriately sized GNPs.\n\nEvidence from lava flows for complex polarity transitions: The new composite Steens Mountain reversal record\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJarboe, Nicholas A.; Coe, Robert S.; Glen, Jonathan M. G.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nGeomagnetic polarity transitions may be significantly more complex than are currently depicted in many sedimentary and lava-flow records. By splicing together paleomagnetic results from earlier studies at Steens Mountain with those from three newly studied sections of Oregon Plateau flood basalts at Catlow Peak and Poker Jim Ridge 70â90 km to the southeast and west, respectively, we provide support for this interpretation with the most detailed account of a magnetic field reversal yet observed in volcanic rocks. Forty-five new distinguishable transitional (T) directions together with 30 earlier ones reveal a much more complex and detailed record of the 16.7 Ma reversed (R)-to-normal (N) polarity transition that marks the end of Chron C5Cr. Compared to the earlier R-T-N-T-N reversal record, the new record can be described as R-T-N-T-N-T-R-T-N. The composite record confirms earlier features, adds new west and up directions and an entire large N-T-R-T segment to the path, and fills in directions on the path between earlier directional jumps. Persistent virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) clusters and separate VGPs have a preference for previously described longitudinal bands from transition study compilations, which suggests the presence of features at the coreâmantle boundary that influence the flow of core fluid and distribution of magnetic flux. Overall the record is consistent with the generalization that VGP paths vary greatly from reversal to reversal and depend on the location of the observer. Rates of secular variation confirm that the flows comprising these sections were erupted rapidly, with maximum rates estimated to be 85â120 m kaâ1Â at Catlow and 130â195 m kaâ1Â at Poker Jim South. Paleomagnetic poles from other studies are combined with 32 non-transitional poles found here to give a clockwise rotation of the Oregon Plateau of 11.4Â°Â± 5.6Â° with respect to the younger Columbia River Basalt Group flows to the north and 14.5Â°Â± 4.6Â° with respect\n\nReversible Reprogramming of Circulating Memory T Follicular Helper Cell Function during Chronic HIV Infection\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCubas, Rafael; van Grevenynghe, Julien; Wills, Saintedym; Kardava, Lela; Santich, Brian H.; Buckner, Clarisa M.; Muir, Roshell; Tardif, Virginie; Nichols, Carmen; Procopio, Francesco; He, Zhong; Metcalf, Talibah; Ghneim, Khader; Locci, Michela; Ancuta, Petronella; Routy, Jean-Pierre; Trautmann, Lydie; Li, Yuxing; McDermott, Adrian B.; Koup, Rick A.; Petrovas, Constantinos; Migueles, Steven A.; Connors, Mark; Tomaras, Georgia D.; Moir, Susan; Crotty, Shane\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDespite the overwhelming benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in curtailing viral load in HIV-infected individuals, ART does not fully restore cellular and humoral immunity. HIV-infected individuals under ART show reduced responses to vaccination and infections and are unable to mount an effective antiviral immune response upon ART cessation. Many factors contribute to these defects, including persistent inflammation, especially in lymphoid tissues, where T follicular helper (Tfh) cells instruct and help B cells launch an effective humoral immune response. In this study we investigated the phenotype and function of circulating memory Tfh cells as a surrogate of Tfh cells in lymph nodes and found significant impairment of this cell population in chronically HIV-infected individuals, leading to reduced B cell responses. We further show that these aberrant memory Tfh cells exhibit an IL-2âresponsive gene signature and are more polarized toward a Th1 phenotype. Treatment of functional memory Tfh cells with IL-2 was able to recapitulate the detrimental reprogramming. Importantly, this defect was reversible, as interfering with the IL-2 signaling pathway helped reverse the abnormal differentiation and improved Ab responses. Thus, reversible reprogramming of memory Tfh cells in HIV-infected individuals could be used to enhance Ab responses. Altered microenvironmental conditions in lymphoid tissues leading to altered Tfh cell differentiation could provide one explanation for the poor responsiveness of HIV-infected individuals to new Ags. This explanation has important implications for the development of therapeutic interventions to enhance HIV- and vaccine-mediated Ab responses in patients under ART.

The smallest unimolecular G-quadruplex belongs to the d(G2NnG2NnG2NnG2) family, which has the potential to form two stacked G-tetrads linked by Nn loop connectivities. Previous studies have focused on the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2), where Nn was T2 for the first and third connecting loops and TGT for the middle connecting loop. This DNA aptamer in K(+) cation solution forms a unimolecular G-quadruplex stabilized by two stacked G(syn)-G(anti)-G(syn)-G(anti) tetrads, adjacent strands which are antiparallel to each other and edge-wise connecting T2, TGT and T2 loops. We now report on the NMR-based solution structure of the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence, which differs from the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer sequence in having longer first (T4) and third (GT4) loops and a shorter (CA) middle loop. This d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) sequence in Na(+) cation solution forms a unimolecular G-quadruplex stabilized by two stacked G(syn)-G(syn)-G(anti)-G(anti) tetrads, adjacent strands which have one parallel and one antiparallel neighbors and distinct non-edge-wise loop connectivities. Specifically, the longer first (T4) and third (GT4) loops are of the diagonal type while the shorter middle loop is of the double chain reversal type. In addition, the pair of stacked G-G-G-G tetrads are flanked on one side by a G-(T-T) triad and on the other side by a T-T-T triple. The distinct differences in strand directionalities, loop connectivities and syn/anti distribution within G-G-G-G tetrads between the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer d(G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2) quadruplex reported previously, and the d(G2T4G2CAG2GT4G2T) quadruplex reported here, reinforces the polymorphic nature of higher\n\nReynolds and Maxwell stress measurements in the reversed field pinch experiment Extrap-T2R\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVianello, N.; Antoni, V.; Spada, E.; Spolaore, M.; Serianni, G.; Cavazzana, R.; BergsÃ¥ker, H.; Cecconello, M.; Drake, J. R.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe complete Reynolds stress (RS) has been measured in the edge region of the Extrap-T2R reversed field pinch experiment. The RS exhibits a strong gradient in the region where a high E Ã B shear takes place. Experimental results show this gradient to be almost entirely due to the electrostatic contribution. This has been interpreted as experimental evidence of flow generation via turbulence mechanism. The scales involved in flow generation are deduced from the frequency decomposition of RS tensor. They are found related to magnetohydrodynamic activity but are different with respect to the scales responsible for turbulent transport.\n\nSomatic mosaicism due to monoallelic reversion of a mutation in T cells of an ADA-SCID patient and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy on the revertant phenotype\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoncada-VÃ©lez, Marcela; VÃ©lez-Ortega, Alejandra C.; Orrego, Julio C.; Santisteban, InÃ©s; Jagadeesh, Jayashree; Olivares, Margarita; Olaya, Natalia; Hershfield, Michael S.; Candotti, Fabio; Franco, Jose L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPatients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency exhibit spontaneous and partial clinical remission associated with somatic reversion of inherited mutations. We report a child with severe combined immunodeficiency (T-B-NK- SCID) due to ADA deficiency diagnosed at the age of 1 month, whose lymphocyte counts including CD4+ and CD8+ T and NK cells began to improve after several months with normalization of ADA activity in PBL, as a result of somatic mosaicism due to monoallelic reversion of the causative mutation in the ADA gene. Our patient was not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy (GT); therefore enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with bovine PEG-ADA was initiated. The follow up of metabolic and immunologic responses to ERT included gradual improvement in ADA activity in erythrocytes and transient expansion of most lymphocyte subsets, followed by gradual stabilization of CD4+ and CD8+ T (with naÃ¯ve phenotype) and NK cells, with sustained expansion of TCRÎ³Î´+ T cells. This was accompanied by disappearance of the revertant T cells as shown by DNA sequencing from PBL. Although the patientâs clinical condition improved marginally, he later developed a germinal cell tumor and eventually died at the age of 67 months from sepsis. This case adds to our current knowledge of spontaneous reversion of mutations in ADA deficiency and shows that the effects of the ERT may vary among these patients, suggesting that it could depend on the cell and type in which the somatic mosaicism is established upon reversion.

Generally, spectrum of inhibition is limited to the same or closely related species to bacteriocin producer. Staphylococcin T is produced by Staphylococcus cohnii strain. The present study concerns influence of StT to 267 Enterococcus sp. strains growth isolated between 2003 and 2006 in Department of Microbiology University Hospital of dr. A. Jurasz in Bydgoszcz. S. cohnii T antagonistic ability evaluated towards bacteries on Mueller-Hinton Agar (bio MÃ©rieux) in aerobic conditions. After 24 and 48 hours tested enterococci suspensions were plated perpendiculary. Susceptibility to antibiotics was assessed by disc diffusion method according to the guideless of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and National Reference Centre for Antimicrobial Susceptibility. Among Enterococcus sp. strains tested 7.1% were sensitive to StT. The highest percentage of sensitive enterococci isolated from wound swabs, urine, blood and pus. Enterococcus faecium strains dominated (63.2%) among enterococci sensitive to StT. Moderate inhibition degree on S. cohnii T bacteriocin action was observed in majority sensitive enterococci strains. Enterococcus sp. sensitive to StT strains were frequently multidrug resistant (68.4%). According to the study results and increasing resistance to antibiotics, StT could be an alternative agent used to treat infections caused by Enterococcus sp.\n\nA titanium hydride gun for plasma injection into the T2-reversed field pinch device\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVoronin, A.

Four different tRNA(3Lys) constructs with a single 32P-labeled 4-thiouridine (4-thioU) residue at positions -1, 16, 36 or 41 were synthesized. After incubation with RT followed by irradiation, crosslinks were localized to either the p66 or p51 subunit of RT by digestion with nuclease and SDS gel fractionation. 4-thioU at position -1 or 16 transferred label to the p66 subunit almost exclusively (> 90%), whereas position 36 labeled both p66 and p51 (3:1). Position 41 yielded no detectable crosslinks. The region of p66 contacted by position -1 of tRNA(3Lys) was localized to the 203 C-terminal amino acids of RT by CNBr cleavage, whereas a 127 amino acid-CNBr peptide (residues 230-357) from both p66 and p51 was labeled by position 36. Functionality of the 4-thioU-modified tRNA(3Lys)(-1) crosslinked to RT in the presence of an RNA but not a DNA template was demonstrated by the ability of the tRNA to be extended. These results localize the 5' half of the tRNA on the interface between the two RT subunits, closer to the RNase H domain than to the polymerase active site, in accord with previous suggestions. They argue further that a specific binding site for the 5' end of the primer tRNA(3Lys) may exist within the C-terminal portion of the p66 subunit, which could be important for the initiation of reverse transcription.

The E(T)(30) scale has been used to propose a quantitative approach towards the relative stability of the electronic ground and excited state species. The extents of contribution of dipolar aprotic solvents towards the solvation of the excited species have been determined to be 42-48% for some of the dyes. Instead of a steady solvatochromism, all the dyes suffer a reversal in solvatochromism. The transitions of the solvatochromism, referred to as solvatochromic switches, are found to be at E(T)(30) values of approximately 50 for methyl and N,N-dimethylamino substituted dyes while at 37.6 for hydroxyl substituted dye and approximately 45 for 4-(1-methyl-2-phenylethenyl) pyridinium dye. A reversal in the trend of solvent effect in the later dye corresponding to 4-(4-methyl styryl)pyridinium dye has been attributed to an analogy of series and parallel electron flow.\n\nInduction and prevention of low-T3 syndrome in exercising women.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoucks, A B; Callister, R\n\n1993-05-01\n\nTo investigate the influence of exercise on thyroid metabolism, 46 healthy young regularly menstruating sedentary women were randomly assigned to a 3 x 2 experimental design of aerobic exercise and energy availability treatments.

After 4 days of treatments, low energy availability (8 vs. 30 kcal.kg body wt-1.day-1) had reduced 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) by 15% and free T3 (fT3) by 18% and had increased thyroxine (T4) by 7% and reverse T3 (rT3) by 24% (all P < 0.01), whereas free T4 (fT4) was unchanged (P = 0.08). Exercise quantity (0 vs. 1,300 kcal/day) and intensity (40 vs. 70% of aerobic capacity) did not affect any thyroid hormone (all P > 0.10). That is, low-T3 syndrome was induced by the energy cost of exercise and was prevented in exercising women by increasing dietary energy intake. Selective observation of low-T3 syndrome in amenorrheic and not in regularly menstruating athletes suggests that exercise may compromise the availability of energy for reproductive function in humans. If so, athletic amenorrhea might be prevented or reversed through dietary reform without reducing exercise quantity or intensity.\n\nEnhancement in Elastic Bending Rigidity of Polymer Loaded Reverse Microemulsions.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeethu, P M; Yadav, Indresh; Aswal, Vinod K; Satapathy, Dillip K\n\n2017-11-14\n\nElastic bending rigidity of the surfactant shell is a crucial parameter which determines the phase behavior and stability of microemulsion droplets. For water-in-oil reverse microemulsions stabilized by AOT (sodium 1,4-bis(2-ethylhexoxy)-1,4-dioxobutane-2-sulfonate) surfactant, the elastic bending rigidity is close to thermal energy at room temperature (k B T) and can be modified by the presence of hydrophilic polymers. Here, we explore the influence of two polymers polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), both having nearly same size (radius of gyration, R g ) but different dipole moment, on elastic bending rigidity of water-AOT-n-decane reverse microemulsions via estimating the percolation temperatures (T P ) and droplet radii using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques. Notably, an increase in T P is observed on introducing PEG and PVP polymers and is attributed to the adsorption of polymer chains onto the surfactant monolayer. The stability of the droplet phase of microemulsion after the incorporation of PEG and PVP polymers is confirmed by contrast matching SANS experiments. An enhancement in elastic bending rigidity of AOT surfactant shell amounting to â¼46% is observed upon incorporation of PVP into the droplet core, whereas for PEG addition, a smaller increase of about 17% is recorded. We conjecture that the considerable increase in elastic bending rigidity of the surfactant monolayer upon introducing PVP is because of the strong ion-dipole interaction between anionic AOT and dipoles present along the PVP polymer chains. Scaling exponents extracted from the temperature dependent electrical conductivity measurements and the frequency dependent scaling of conductivity at percolation indicate the dynamic nature of percolation for both pure and polymer loaded reverse microemulsions. The decrease in activation energy of percolation upon incorporating PEG and PVP polymer molecules also\n\nInfluence of reverse bias on the LEDs properties used as photo-detectors in VLC systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKowalczyk, Marcin; Siuzdak, Jerzy\n\n2015-09-01\n\nContinuous increasing share of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in a lighting market, which we observe during the last couple years, opens new possibilities. Especially, when we talk about practical realization the concept of visible light communications (VLC), which gains on popularity recently. The VLC concept presupposes utilization of illumination systems for a purpose of data transmission. It means, the emitters, in this case the LEDs, will not of a light source only, but also the data transmitters. Currently, most of the conducted researches in this area is concentrated on achievement of effective transmission methods. It means a transmission only in one direction. This is not enough, when we talk about the fully functional transmission system. Ensuring of feedback transmission channel is a necessary also. One of the ideas, which was postulated by authors of this article, is using for this purpose the LEDs in a double role. A utilization o"
