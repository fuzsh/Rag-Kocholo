Unless otherwise stated, reference numbers used in the column below entitled «Description» refer to the descriptions of dual-use items set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009.\n\n2. A reference number in the column below entitled «Related item from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009» means that the characteristics of the item described in the «Description» column lie outside the parameters set out in the description of the dual-use entry referred to.\n\n3. Definitions of terms between «single quotation marks» are given in a technical note to the relevant item.\n\n4. Definitions of terms between «double quotation marks» can be found in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009.\n\nGeneral Notes\n\n1. The object of the controls contained in this Annex should not be defeated by the export of any non-controlled goods (including plant) containing one or more controlled components when the controlled component or components is/are the principal element of the goods and can feasibly be removed or used for other purposes.\n\nNB: In judging whether the controlled component or components is/are to be considered the principal element, it is necessary to weigh the factors of quantity, value and technological know-how involved and other special circumstances which might establish the controlled component or components as the principal element of the goods being procured.\n\n2. The items specified in this Annex include both new and used goods.\n\nGeneral Technology Note (GTN)\n\n(To be read in conjunction with Section B of this Annex)\n\n1. The sale, supply, transfer or export of «technology» which is «required» for the «development», «production» or «use» of goods the sale, supply, transfer or export of which is controlled in Section IX.A of this Annex, is controlled in accordance with the provisions of Section B.\n\n2. The «technology\"\"required» for the «development», «production» or «use» of goods under control remains under control even when it is applicable to non-controlled goods.\n\n3. Controls do not apply to that «technology» which is the minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking) and repair of those goods which are not controlled or the export of which has been authorised in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n4. Controls on «technology» transfer do not apply to information «in the public domain», to «basic scientific research» or to the minimum necessary information for patent applications.\n\nIX.A.
