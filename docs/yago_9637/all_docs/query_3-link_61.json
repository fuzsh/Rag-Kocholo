Funded by The Princes Trust, and made with the help of the public, \"What's Next?\" provides a fresh angle on industry analysis given by the gamers themselves. Soundtracked by eleven underground musicians, the footage has been compiled into one documentary presented by TV presenter Emily Booth.\n\nThe DVD is due for release in December, but available now to pre-order.\n\nAbout United Games:\n\nUnited Games Media was founded in 2004, by Mr AJ Mehta and Mr ACE Okell, to commercialise the activities of United Games - previously a non-profit, fan-made magazine distributed at independent retailers.\n\nUnited Games Media's first product is \"What's Next?\", a DVD video documentary on the future of gaming, presented by Emily Booth (previously of Channel 4's BITS).\n\nUnited Games Media also encompasses United Games' Game eXtra Services, including VHS, DVD, Print, Advert Design, Web Design, and Content Licensing services.

The band have recently finished recording a session with XFM, due for broadcast from 10pm on the 7th of December, as part of Claire Sturgess' Exposure, Part 1.

She then made various memorable appearances on the L!VE TV cable channel, her work there included co-presenting the saucy film review show 'Blue Review'.\n\nHer early film & TV exploits were noticed by producers at Channel 4 and she was recruited to help write and co-present the popular computer game review show 'Bits' with Aleks Krotoski and Emily Newton Dunn. Emily appeared on Bits for four series right up until the show ended in 2001. More presenting work followed and notable appearances after Bits include the oft repeated paintball challenge show 'Mission:Paintball', the carnage-filled series 'Demolition' (filmed in Australia) and she even presented some segments on the late great Channel 4 morning flagship show 'The Big Breakfast'.\n\nOther credits include the excellent UK horror movie 'Cradle of Fear', the short film 'Inferno' ( BAFTA nomination for best short film ), 'outTHERE' for Bravo & Channel 5, 'Shock Movie Massacre' again for Bravo, bizarre betting gameshow 'Banzai' for E4, the documentary on the new 'Evil Dead' DVD box set, and Jake West's horror comedy \"Evil Aliens\"."
