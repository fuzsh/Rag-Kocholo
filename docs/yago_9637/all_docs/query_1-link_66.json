        "text": "NEW FLESH FILMS PRESENTS\n\nA NEW FLESH FILMS AND SPLIT SECONDS FILM PRODUCTION\n\nWRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY ALEX CHANDON\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA disparate group of young urban offenders and their care workers embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. A minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved. This is a demented horror film with nowt taken out.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nINBRED is the warped brain child of UK writer/director Alex Chandon, who is responsible for the independent cult feature films CRADLE OF FEAR (2001) and PERVIRELLA (1997) as well as numerous award winning shorts and music promos.\n\nThe script was written in 2009 and it immediately piqued the interest of New Flesh Films, who were looking for a strong feature to launch their company's slate of productions. Private investors loved the INBRED script and decided to back the movie and so the wheels were set in motion. Alex developed a few drafts of the script and the final draft is co-written by his long time collaborator Paul Shrimpton, who lives in Yorkshire, where the film was eventually set.\n\nIt was while staying with Paul that Alex decided that Yorkshire was the perfect location for the film; Paul’s hometown of Thirsk has some stunning locations and a community untouched by film-makers and so they were all eager to help and get involved.\n\nProducer Margaret Milner Schmueck previously worked on the production of Alex's CRADLE OF FEAR and had in the interim period produced a body of award winning shorts. Her strong connections with northern crew and talent sources made an interesting fit for INBRED so when Alex invited her on board as delegate producer to head up the production, Split Second Films (splitsecond-films.com) the Midlands based independent production company which Margaret co-founded became the UK production company.\n\nIn early June 2010 an 8 week pre-production period started for a 4 week shoot through August 2010. INBRED had a successful 26 day shoot and then the long post production stage went into progress. INBRED has over 170 shots that require some sort of digital visual effects. This process was undertaken by Alex Chandon and a select crew of talented artists and took 6 months to complete.\n\nINBRED premiered at the prestigious FRIGHTFEST FILM FESTIVAL in London, UK in August 2011 to rave reviews and then played at a select few European festivals in late 2011, which also generated great positive feedback, which resulted in Darclight Films becoming the sales agent for INBRED at the very end of 2011.\n\nSo we all hope that 2012 is indeed the year of the INBRED!\n\nCAST\n\nINBRED'S CAMEOS\n\nGEORGE NEWTON (Wilf)\n\nOn leaving school George Newton joined the British navy for a period before later spending time working in the British army, the British air force and the Gibralter police force. George undertook a number of professions before he was spotted in Sheffield in 2001 by his talent manager which resulted in a career in Film and Television.\n\nGeorge’s first film was playing Gypsy John in Shane Meadows acclaimed and award winning DEAD MANS SHOES (2003) which ignited a long lasting collaboration between them as George plays Banjo in THIS IS ENGLAND (2006) and the subsequent spin-off TV series financed by Film4.\n\nGeorge has played the studio manager in Anton Corbijn’s award winning CONTROL (2007), the poacher in Karl Golden’s PELICAN BLOOD (2010), a manager in Paul King’s BUNNY AND THE BULL (2009) and lead role Harding in award winning New Zealand writer/director Virginia Heath’s short film MY DANGEROUS LOVERBOY (2009).\n\nGeorge currently lives in Leeds where he works part time as a rehabilitation support worker for the Disabilities Trust specifically working with brain trauma injury victims and this he finds immensely rewarding.\n\nDOMINIC BRUNT (Podge)\n\nDominic Brunt was born in Macclesfield in 1970.He left school to become a sheet metal worker/ welder before retraining as an actor in 1989,attending Hyndburn college and then Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.\n\nDominic first appeared in short films SKIN, 28 and many TV drama's including INSPECTOR MORSE, SOLDIER SOLDIER, HOLDING ON and comedies including 2.4 CHILDREN and THE PAUL MERTON SHOW.\n\nDominic joined the ITV's hugely popular and multi-award winning soap, EMMERDALE, in 1997 as vet Paddy Kirk and has been a popular character and regular there ever since.\n\nHis love of horror was the reason he met up with Alex Chandon and offered to do a cameo in INBRED. What was to be a short cameo turned instead into a brilliantly memorable performance as one of the main Inbred henchmen, Podge.\n\nIn 2011 Dominic embarked on his own feature film project and directorial debut, the zombie film BEFORE DAWN which he also stars in. BEFORE DAWN is currently in the last stages of post production.\n\nMAT FRASER (Jacob)\n\nMat Fraser is an actor, performing artist, writer, and musician. Recent credits include the lead in the controversial new action film UNARMED BUT DANGEROUS, the new and popular character David Osbourne in Ireland’s FAIR CITY (RTE), Will in CAST OFF’S (Channel 4), a man dying of cancer in HOLBY CITY (BBC 1), a heroin dealer METROSEXUALITY (Channel 4), and a satanic orgy participant in CHEMICAL WEDDING. He has made numerous documentaries such as BORN FREAK, and award winning plays such as SEALBOY:FREAK, and THALIDOMIDE!! A MUSICAL. He is a black belt in Dynamic Self Defence.\n\nMatt is engaged to the legendary New York performer Julie Atlas Muz, and they have two current touring shows, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE FREAK & THE SHOWGIRL, which enjoyed sold out runs at the Amsterdam, Perth and Adelaide Fringe festivals. As well as his monthly co hosting of the legendary BBC’s OUCH! pod cast, Mat is also a popular International cabaret host & artiste. His British wit, subversive lack of political correctness around disability, the sideshow style, his playful sexuality, songs, comedy and outrageous antics onstage have all added to his infamy.\n\nFor more info on Mat and his work, please go to: www.matfraser.co.uk\n\nEMILY BOOTH (June)\n\nEmily Booth first bounced onto our screens as the lead in the 1997 movie PERVIRELLA which was Alex Chandon's first feature. Her early film and TV exploits were noticed by producers at Channel 4 and she was recruited to help write and co-present the popular computer game show BITS for all four series.\n\nIn 2001 she starred in Alex Chandon's feature CRADLE OF FEAR and the short film INFERNO which recieved a BAFTA nomination for the best short film. Emily has presented numerous diverse TV shows such as MISSION:PAINTBALL, the carnage-filled series DEMOLITION (filmed in Australia), outTHERE for Bravo & Channel 5, SHOCK MOVIE MASSACRE and segments on Channel 4's morning flagship show THE BIG BREAKFAST. Emily's versatility means she can switch between her presenting roles and dramatic roles in the movies. Her more recent film appearances include a lead role Jake West's horror comedy EVIL ALIENS (2005) and more recently played the part of The Snipper in his big budget zombie movie DOGHOUSE (2009).\n\nEmily currently writes and presents for the Horror Channel and is a genuine iconic UK 'scream queen', having worked with most of the main names in the UK horror scene.

I was joyously repulsed and knew I was watching something very heartfelt, albeit disgusting. My amazing DoP on INBRED, Ollie Downey shared my vision of making a film that would hopefully homage the style of film making of the 70's and 80's which I consider the benchmark of cinema.\n\nINBRED is my third feature but the first film where casting was the most important ingredient. We spent quite a while developing the script to make it really strong and as water tight as possible. I must thank Paul Shrimpton my co-writer who really made the final shooting script a joy to read and work with.\n\nThe script attracted great actors and working with such talent has been something I've dreamed of and I'm so happy they all understood where I was coming from. I feel the performances sell the story... then the gorgeous camerawork and the incredible special effects make it a whole.\n\nI consider myself fortunate enough to know loads of talented special make up effects and visual effects people in the UK and so we were able to get together and devise the sort of effects I for one have never seen in this level of film before. I feel INBRED is refreshingly raw but also comfortingly similar as we've tried to tick as many boxes that today’s' horror fans should enjoy.\n\nThis is the film I would love to sneak in and see aged 14 and feel very naughty doing so. It's very wrong but very right.\n\nAlex Chandon\n\nDIRECTOR'S BIOGRAPHY\n\nAlex Chandon has been making movies all his life, inspired by seeing JAWS aged 6, and then given a Super 8mm film camera aged 10. His film NIGHTMARE (1983) was inspired by Sam Raim's THE EVIL DEAD and was shown in competition at the BFI National Fim Theatre when Alex was 14.\n\nHe first became known for his VHS gore films BAD KARMA (1991) and DRILLBIT (1992) which were made during his Fine Art Painting Degree at Kingston University.\n\nAlex worked for many years in the 1990's for art director Gerry Judah on numerous commercials, idents and music promos including PAUL McCARTNEY, PAGE & PLANT MTV UNPLUGGED, SMIRNOFF, BMW, BENSON & HEDGES and GREENPEACE. Alex's work included model making, set design, construction and scenic painting. Alex's freelance art department work includes the original LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.\n\nIn between art department jobs Alex pursued his directing career, his VHS gore films had caught the eye of producer Josh Collins who was looking for a writer/ director for a pet project he had called PERVIRELLA , a low budget steam-punk sex comedy. Alex loved Josh's crazy ambitious idea that involved lots of models and miniatures and so they agreed to make PERVIRELLA together. Alex says, “It was a crazy film and featured so many sets and props and costume and everything had to be unique and individually made, this was before we had computers to help us indie fim makers. So it was a major effort and feat of love. It took us two years I think... from start to very end.” It was shot on Super 16mm by cinematographers John and Howard Ford (THE DEAD). PERVIRELLA famously features UK chat show host Jonathan Ross in his first film role (he hates it!) and introduced the world to the ample charms of a young Emily Booth, who played the title character, a rampant sex goddess.\n\nIn 1997 Alex wrote a script called SIAMESE COP which was eventually made into a film of the same name produced by David (HARRY POTTER films) Barron. Watered down script rewrites by the hired director who didn't share Alex's warped vision meant it didn't live up to the original taglines: “Good Cop. Bad Cop. Same Cop.” and “Two Cops. One Jacket.” Badly realised by its director it remains mostly unseen and wisely so.\n\nMeanwhile, PERVIRELLA had become an underground 'sleeper' hit with some hardcore fans and one of them introduced Alex to UK black metal band CRADLE OF FILTH. In 1999 Alex directed their first and seminal music promo FROM THE CRADLE TO ENSLAVE. The success of this inspired Alex to make CRADLE OF FEAR (2001) his second feature film. A dark and twisted anthology movie using Dani Filth (lead singer of COFilth) as a pivotal character linking the stories of death and horror, CRADLE OF FEAR became a huge success, selling over 100,000 units. Unfortunately not reading the small print meant that despite the film's success both critically and commercially the producers were left out of pocket. After the two years work it led to Alex becoming disillusioned with the film industry as a way of making enough to even pay for his basic needs like food and rent and made him focus on music promos, short films and digital visual effects for the next years.\n\nIn 2006 Alex was included in Saatchi and Saatchi's Young Directors Showcase for his multiple award winning short film BORDERLINE (2006), which was subsequently chosen for the UK BFI National Film Archive as a portrait of London in 2006.\n\nBORDERLINE showcases Alex's digital composite effects skills, which then became his main occupation for several years until he got his feature film mojo back with a vengeance in 2009, when he wrote 4 feature film scripts, one of which was INBRED. INBRED is the first feature film where Alex has been able to showcase his new visual effects skills alongside his writing and directing talents and it is the project he is most proud of.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHER'S STATEMENT : OLLIE DOWNEY\n\n\"When I first heard about INBRED in early 2010 I was coming off a run of commercials and promos where the primary aim had been to obtain suitably glossy images. So when I met Alex and he explained that he wanted to shoot INBRED in a minimal, naturalistic style, to homage the cinematic style of classic 70's films like STRAW DOGS, DON'T LOOK NOW and DELIVERANCE, I was instantly drawn to the project.\n\nAlex's script seemed pretty ambitious. My most obvious concern was his ability to pull off the extreme number of FX shots he had devised. Those concerns were put firmly to bed on our first meeting. His enthusiasm, attention to detail and total confidence in his approach was contagious. Alex's preparation and previous experience with all aspects of filming FX techniques convinced me that we'd be able to pull off the craziness that he had written.\n\nHis approach to visual FX harks back to the golden age of cinema with in-camera effects shots, split screens and simple, yet totally effective, compositing and mattes. We decided to shoot on the RED One because of its resolution and colour depth. With the amount of post work and compositing Alex would be doing himself we had to go digital even if it felt slightly counter intuitive given the look we wanted to achieve. Again when on set we had to play it a little safer than I would normally with exposure levels and not go too dark for the same reason. We had to trust that we'd get a good colourist in at the end of the process,and we were certainly very lucky to have Dado Valentic at Mytherapy (www.mytherapy.tv) come on board to pull it all together.\n\nWe used the Red one body, and a set of Ultra Primes. We decided to stick to the wider lenses - mainly the 24mm and the 32mm, only very occasionally going longer. The film is very much about environment so we were keen to open the backgrounds up as much as possible and at the same time get the camera as close as possible to the cast. The decision to frame the film in 2.35 was made right at the start. We shot in 4k at 16.9 and worked with a cropped image on the on set monitor. I've seen the film screened from DCP in the cinema and it looks great. We always wanted INBRED to be classically cinematic, with lots of big wides. Alex and I have very similar ideas of what constitutes interesting composition and this made filming INBRED a real pleasure.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be able to bring my own crew on board that I've worked with many times before, focus puller Jason Walker, gaffer Alex Edyvean and camera assistant Tom 'Turbo' O'Keefe (and a new addition in Nick Britt). This was vital - we wouldn't have stood a chance without them - we had to hit the ground running, the schedule was tight and Alex likes to work fast and shoot lots so the familiarity was key. I think we averaged about 35 slates a day over the 20 plus days. On one particularly memorable day we racked up 65 slates.\n\nBeing on the same wavelength as Alex meant less discussions about camera positions and gave Alex Edyvean and myself more time to concentrate on the lighting set ups. The real locations looked amazing but some of the smaller interiors proved more of a challenge, purely on the ammount of camera and lighting kit we crammed into those tiny places! The on set colour palette was deliberately muted with emphasis on creating a subtle mood rather than anything too contrasty or stylised. The natural textures of all the original locations and the wonderful work of our Production Designer Melanie Light were key to achieving the look.\n\nI'm very pleased with how INBRED has turned out. Particularly the effects shots - the area where a lot of genre productions make mistakes or over rely on CGI. I feel we were fortunate to have a very determined and talented crew of people on board, ably led and propelled forwards by Alex. The production team also worked tirelessly to provide us with the various kit we required required. The quality of the film is testament to everyone's bloody minded determination.\n\nINBRED was hard work and pretty damned challenging but ultimately immensely rewarding. I await the phone call for Alex's next film with a little trepidation and a lot of excitement…..\n\nOllie Downey\n\nwww.olliedowney.com\n\nVISUAL AND MAKE-UP SPECIAL EFFECTS\n\nOne of INBRED's big selling points is it's amazingly realistic special effects scenes. Director Alex Chandon's knowledge and expertise with composite visual effects techniques meant he was able to devise incredibly innovitive ways of filming the numerous scenes of bodily carnage that frequent INBRED. Alex was given expert assistance by two good friends, the highly talented Dominic Hailstone and Adrian Banton, who between themselves have an incredible body of highly respected work in the industry.\n\nAlex says, “The intention with INBRED was to try and avoid any CGI and film all the effects elements on set, and then combine the various shots into a hopefully seamless effect shot. This meant a lot of preparation and storyboarding to work out exactly how to shoot stuff... how many plates (clean background shots) are needed, if its a green screen or split screen shot... etc. We filmed various blood splatting and dripping against green screen so we could add more blood in post but it would look, as it was shot under the same lighting conditions with the same camera and lenses. It makes such a massive difference to a composite effects shot to have all the elements filmed in the same place at the same time.\n\nI would say we were 95% succesful... there were a couple of really tricky shots where the only option was to use a small bit of CGI to sell the gag. In hindsight we could have shot these elements so I don't feel its a massive cheat! I hope there are shots in INBRED that people have no idea how on earth we achieved.“\n\nAlex's long time appreciation of real make up effects and in camera effects was the reason he wanted to keep everything as real as possible. It was important that the make-up and prosthetic effects on INBRED was of the highest quality and so Alex worked closely with no less than three specialist make up effects crews each with different talents needed to bring the INBRED FX to life.\n\nDUNCAN JARMAN : PROSTHETIC MAKE-UP EFFECTS\n\nDuncan Jarman, assisted by Tristan Versluis, devised and fabricated the silicone prosthetic make up effects for the two most major effects set pieces in INBRED.\n\nDuncan's long and successful Make Up Effects career includes winning 2 Emmy's for Hallmark productions, work on Spielberg's BAND OF BROTHERS, the HARRY POTTER films, Tim Burton's SWEENEY TODD, Scorcese's THE AVIATOR and most recently Clint Eastwood's J EDGAR, where he was responsible for Leonardo Di Caprio's prosthetics.\n\nDuncan has been into special effects since he fell in love with Sinbad films and monster movies as a youngster. He met Alex while studying for a Fine Art Degree at Kingston Polytechnic in 1991. Their shared passion for horror films and special effects led to them making the VHS horror films BAD KARMA (1991) and DRILLBIT (1992) which helped them both forge a career in their chosen fields of directing for Alex and special make-up effects for Duncan.\n\nDuncan has produced make-up effects in one form or another for every movie that Alex has made, and they both hope to continue this trend into the future.\n\nLINZI FOXCROFT & TRAUMA FX : SILICONE WOUND EFFECTS\n\nLinzi Foxcroft and her company TRAUMA FX handles all of INBRED's silicone wound make-up.\n\nTRAUMA FX specialise in highly realistic casualty simulation for the Ministry of Defence, Police and Emergency Services. Their work has to be hyper realistic and they are have to be able to apply wounds on location for the re-enactments of actual accidents.\n\nThis made Linzi and her talented crew of expert make-up artists perfect for the numerous wounds on the actors in INBRED which couldn't be pre-cast and had to be perfect. Linzi is able to create bespoke realistic silicone wounds on set depending on what was needed. This level of flexibility was invaluable with so much action going on.\n\nwww.traumafx.co.uk\n\nGRAHAM TAYLOR & GT FX : BLOOD AND GORE EFFECTS\n\nGraham Taylor runs GT FX a small make-up effects company in the same town that INBRED was filmed, Thirsk in Yorkshire, and so he and his team were perfect to supply the gallons of blood needed for INBRED and also devise various ways of pumping that blood.... from garden sprayers to full on compressed air cannons that were specially fabricated for the scenes of bodily fluids exploding everywhere.\n\nGraham also fabricated latex body parts and miscellaneous innards and all the 'stunt-goreprops' that we blew to bits with a shot gun in front of a green screen.\n\nwww.gtfx.co.uk\n\nMELANIE LIGHT : PRODUCTION DESIGNER/ ART DIRECTOR\n\nINBRED's stunning real locations are complimented and enhanced by wonderful production design and art direction from Melanie Light. She and her team worked miracles to bring all aspects of Alex's warped vision to beautiful life.\n\nMelanie has been working on UK horror films since 2006. She started off working for Adam Mason (THE DEVILS CHAIR, BLOOD RIVER, BROKEN) and hasn't look back since. Her first production designed feature 'THE SCARCROW' won best Horror at the London independent film Festival 2009. She has worked on music promos for the likes of Cradle of Filth and Within Temptation and was production designer for the popular online Sci-Fi series 'KIRILL' for Endamol and MSN, which won a Digital Webby in 2009 and was nominated for a digital Emmy. Melanie was the art director for the first Hammer Films come back, BEYOND THE RAVE.\n\nShe has recently worked on the new Horror Comedy 'COCKNEY'S VERSES ZOMBIES' (2012) and production designed the urban girl gang thriller 'SKET ', which premiered at the London Film Festival 2011. She is currently involded in preproduction as art director for SFX man turned director Tristan Versluis' Sci-Fi feature film 'OMNI' and Horror film 'CLUB SKIN'.\n\nMelanie's showreel can been seen here www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZEejrUDMI\n\nMARGARET MILNER SCHMUECK: PRODUCER\n\nMargaret comes from Cork City where she left on graduation from University College Cork with BSc degree in Computer Science. Basing herself in the UK she started up an international IT business working across countries such as Germany, South Korea and Australia.
