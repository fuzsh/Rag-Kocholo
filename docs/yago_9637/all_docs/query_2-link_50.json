        "text": "I’ve lived in many parts of California, most of the different parts of west and east LA, but also Cypress, Temecula and Hemet with my grandparents. Hmm so I don't really have one place that feels grounded as home. Just different stages of life. Closer to the water is home.\n\nHonestly, I had to move away from California to come back and realize I had a greater appreciation for California. seeing different areas like Hemet and seeing the beauty in all the different surroundings each place had to offer. Just noticing point Dume bluffs felt like j was in Mexico last summer. The diversity this place has is incredible!\n\nHard to say. there so different that they don’t share really anything alike besides the people that trying to make the comparisons to each other to help them feel comfortable. LA for it's space and the opposite for NYC obviously\n\nHmm just something I always would play around with as a young teenager. I’m sure my dad and influence on me since he would show me ads of his own company in the 80’s. It was very around me when I was a kid with different people.\n\nHa! Hardest part, it never stops and constantly telling yourself “this was the right decision.\" Rewarding, Allowing yourself to be wrong and learn from those mistakes, pivot and grow.\n\nMight not be the right person to ask this question. Running a company isn't easy! As much as we hear, hard work pays off. There's a good amount of luck and timing that's involved with being a successful company.\n\nThere all difficult to put together. The easiest was swoosh. For the most part I dreaded making videos unless it was in the moment. They never came easy for me.\n\nThere were plenty of pros before me that did it. I would say, everythingwas just hyper focused on one style.\n\nI was inspired by those of late 80’s and early 90’s.I didn’t do anything different just right place right time.\n\nThank you, right now it’s just watching my baby boy. Excited to share all the things I’ve learn with him. I would like to get back into making more music and surfing a lot more but that will come!\n\nHmm good question. all the waterfalls hikes in the San Fernando area. most people that live in LA miss what California has to really offer and I would say really try going out of just LA because there’s a lot of amazing things this place has to offer from arts to Nature.\n\nFollow Alex at: @olsonstuff. We admire him and his unrelenting drive to continuously learn to the utmost extent!"
