        "text": "LATEST NEWS\n\nNicholas Barker, drummer for the band since its beggining has left Cradle Of Filth on January the 27th. It's a hard news for most of us, as he was considered by many as one of the best drummers ever. He will be replaced by Was Sarginson, drummer for The Blood Divine and December Moon (a side project of Robin).\n\nThis is what Robin had to say on the subject:-\n\n\"I am here to inform you that Nicholas, our long-time drummer, has decided to part ways with us. It was, really, a mutual, though amicable decision- he's got other things he'd like to concentrate on for the time being, so it was for the best. One William A. Sarginson (a.k.a. oddly enough WAS) has stepped in to fill Nick's role, and we feel satisfied with the choice, although we're certainly disappointed at losing such a stalwart skin-pounder as Mr. Barker. Rest assured though, we are still quite on good terms with Nick, and there is NO animosity about. Some of you may remember WAS's work with me on the December Moon album a while back; he's also played a bit for Extreme Noise Terror, and even played for CoF, believe it or not, aeons ago... in the band's infancy. He should be great.\"\n\n* Dani's Daughter is born he called her \"LUNA\"\n\nStunning News:\n\nNick the former drummer of Cradle Of Filth now plays with Dimmu Borgir, he is now official in the band, and already played 2 gigs with the band. More info about this subject later...\n\nMARCH 28\n\nMost should know now that Nick Barker left the band in January. He's been working on a few projects and most recently announced his joining Norway's Dimmu Borgir. He's currently on tour in Europe. Some have written that he isonly replacing the band's long-term drummer - not so. He is a permanent fixture.\n\nCradle just completed filming of their first proper promotional video in London. The shoot, according to guitarist Stuart Anstis, went well. The video will be in conjunction with the band's upcoming EP, set for release in Europe in May. No info on who is releasing it in the states yet. The ep features one new song plus two covers (Misfits and Anathema to be exact).\n\n(Big Thanx to Paula for the info!)\n\nAPRIL 4th\n\nNick left the band becouse he wanted different things than the band did. He was one of the long-staying members and just wanted to pursue other musicial options and tour a lot more.\n\nThe cover songs on the new EP \"From The Cradle To Enslave\" will be from the Misfits and Anathema, the cover from Anathema is \"Sleepless\" the cover of the misfits is not yet known.\n\nmore about this later.\n\nThe live video is still not approved. The band just filmed a promotional video that will be in conjunction with the ep.\n\n(Thanx again to Paula)\n\nApril 18th\n\nCradle Of Filth have announced their replacement for the long-suffering drummer Nicholas Barker.\n\nDave Hirschheimer (formerly of Infestation and Hangnail) will become an honorary Filthmeister as of the twentieth of march, when the band finish recording a new EP at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool with temporary drummer Was Sargison.\n\nEntitled 'From The Cradle To Enslave', the title track will be cut for a single and video release, filming for the latter beginning several days later at the prestigious Three Mills Studio in Bow, under the production therionship of cult movie director Alex Chandon. Chandon, responsible for the sex slick 'Pervirella' as well as underground gore shockers 'Bad Karma', 'Drillbit' and 'Siamese Cop', describes the collaboration as 'a marriage formed in hell', in what promises to be one of the more disturbing films of the millennium.\n\nThe new line-up will then commence work on the follow-up to 'Cruelty And The Beast' which is scheduled for an All Hallow's Eve release.\n\nOn a lighter note, additional information from the COF camp reveals that Dani has spawned another atrocity - a little baby girl. Born February 8th at 5 lbs 4oz, Luna Scarlett has already displayed signs of following in her father's footsteps, staying awake all night and screaming the house down !!!.\n\nApril 19th (Official info)\n\nCradle have completed their first-ever \"full production\" promotional video.

This time there will only be one (uncensored) version made.\n\nApart from the new CoF video, Alex Chandon is also working on a separate project with Dani. It is a 90 minute hardcore horror film called 'Cradle of Fear', consisting of five sick stories interwoven by Dani himself.
