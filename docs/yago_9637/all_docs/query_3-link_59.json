        "text": "Women in Horror project\n\nHorror film director and all-round spooky badass Melanie Light contacted me back in 2013 and asked if I wanted to get involved in a new project that she had envisioned. As she enthusiastically told me, she wants to introduce a wider audience to a rather particular niche: the women of horror films. As a proud champion of alternative cul-ture, it didn’t take much convincing to get involved. People often see women who sit ‘outside the norm’ as weird or scary, and we wanted to challenge that: yeah, maybe we’re a little weird, but we’re creative, talented and happy in ourselves, too.\n\nWe found a perfect location for the shoots: a studio named MurderMile (of course) in North East London. I had used the studio various times for my rock portraits and knew it well. As the budget was very tight, we shot all the images in two (long) days.Our all-female team worked well together, with no horror movie-worthy disa-greements to be found – impressive, when you take into account that one of the ac-tresses involved was an actual Cenobite…\n\nBiography – Tina Korhonen\n\nFinnish-born and London-based Tina Korhonen – also known as ‘Tina K’ – is a freelance portrait, music and editorial photographer with over 15 years of experience.\n\nKorhonen started taking pictures early on with her father’s camera, a Canon AE-1. Although mainly self-taught, Tina trained at the London College of Printing and also has an MA from the University of Helsinki. After completing her course Tina worked in a picture library, before stepping fully into the unknown, into her dream of earning her living solely from photography. Tina remembers the end of that era well: “I was let go from my job for my own good, because I was always changing my hours to accommodate New Musical Express’ demands. According to my very understanding boss he was doing me a favour. He also gave me a bonus on my last payday for my first digital camera fund. He saw where my heart was and that I could do this”.\n\nTina K’s style has been described as well-lit, colourful, eye-catching, punchy and vivid, both in style and subject matter. Although she loves black and white photography, her own photography is mainly in colour. Tina used cross-processing in the film era, long before mobile phone applications rediscov-ered that look. She loves symmetry and clean lines, but also slight madness and a ‘not-too-polished look’ when it comes to her rock portraits.\n\nTina is a regular photographer for music magazines such as Total Guitar, Metal Hammer, Bass Guitar Magazine and Prog Magazine, in addition to Helsingin Sanomat, the biggest newspaper in Scandina-via. Tina’s work has been published in numerous other magazines and newspapers including Classic Rock, Kerrang!, NME, Observer Music Monthly, Practical Photography and Rolling Stone. She is one of the photographers represented by a new photographic agency Female Perspective. She has also been a critic and a visiting columnist in Practical Photography and she has been seen occasionally in front of photography enthusiasts and students talking about her photography and career.\n\nOutside of editorial work, Tina’s current clients include record companies, musicians and instrument and clothing companies such as Rodrigo y Gabriela, Universal, Yamaha Guitars and Bonnie Tyler. Her pictures have been used in books, record covers and sleeves and posters. Tina’s images can been seen anywhere from extreme metal band Cradle of Filth’s t-shirts to The Hives’ tour posters, and in fashion publications such as Elle and Vogue.\n\nTina K has had eight photographic exhibitions in the UK, France and Finland to date, including an ex-hibition at Gibson Guitars showroom in London’s West End for five months in 2016. Before being nominated for Hundred Heroines campaign, Korhonen was nominated for Best Photographer at the 2018 Heavy Music Awards. She is currently working on a photographic book and personal project with a working title: Behind The Scenes’."
