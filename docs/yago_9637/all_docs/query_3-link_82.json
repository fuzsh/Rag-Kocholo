It's basically a late-night clips show, introduced by a female character called \"Eden\" - real name Miss Anneka Svenska.\n\nShe airs really unusual, cool, bizarre, grotesque, horrifying, hilarious and downright odd clips from the kinds of culty films that the average cinema-goer doesn't know of or doesn't care for.\n\nBasically, it's like the \"Eurotrash\" or \"Mondo Macabro\" of the movie world. Good late-night viewing, and this is the third series now!\n\nHere's Miss Svenska's website link:\n\nCLICK ON ME!\n\nPooch\n\nGarrett\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\nApr 21, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n57,196\n\nReaction score\n\n19,462\n\nPoints\n\n11,638\n\nLocation\n\nThe best thief you'll never see.\n\nNov 2, 2002\n\n#5\n\nI quite liked the naked lady telling the joke but at the end it said was a joke of the week, so I take she wont be on again .

She used to co-present \"Bits\" and appears in several low budget UK-made horror movies like Alex Chandon's Cradle of Fear and Pervirella, neither of which are any good but we won't hold that against Ms Booth. She was also in Nigel Wingrove's nunsploitation flick Sacred Flesh, which was a bit better than Chandon's crap films but not much.\n\nShe's far better looking than the oogly guys that put OutThere together and she's got a bit more personality than Anneka Svenska that used to present the show for the first couple of series. She looks great naked too (how she ends up in most of her films)\n\nJames45\n\nStandard Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 21, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n2,844\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n449\n\nAge\n\n46\n\nLocation\n\nTaking Care of Business\n\nNov 4, 2002\n\n#8\n\nwhich one was she in Bits?

I went further and tried to see the joke again but to see them you have to subscribe , but you can here a joke without the picture .
