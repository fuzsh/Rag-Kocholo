        "text": "Cultural Capital: Describe yourself in ten words or less:\n\nEmilly Booth: Torn, ambitious, mellow, at times dark, stupidly open and honest. Giggly. Need passion and romance but very independent. Is that over 10 words?\n\nCC: Tell us a bit about Inferno.\n\nEB: Inferno is about 2 young small time lovable crooks that get mixed up in something beyond their meager crime circle. They end up in a high tech surveillance prison. A games corporation taps into the criminal files and downloads their personalities into the next hyper real computer game called Inferno. It's like Quake but bigger, harder, faster. However, the game ends up not working because it is so real, the characters (who are self aware) don't actually want to fight back making the point of the game shooting, violence, fighting for the treasure futile - the characters don't respond. I play \"The Princess\" who they want to save - but I have no personality (thanks guys) so I just blow up everything.\n\nCC: What's your favourite sci-fi movie?\n\nEB: Sci Fi movie hmmm, I fell in love with Demon Seed when I was little - I think it has great atmosphere, but you can't beat Alien (1) either. There must be loads I still haven't seen. Ooh - Clash of the Titans and Dark Crystal are also nostalgic faves.\n\nCC: What's been your best ever part?\n\nEB: Probably Pervirella - she started it all off, and I had the best time of my life filming that film - it was absolutely hectic and bizarre and full of characters!\n\nCC: Who is your most admired actor/actress?\n\nEB: I love Sigourney Weaver, so watchable. Actor - still love Johnny Depp, but fave now is Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nCC: What's been your favourite or most memorable job while resting?\n\nEB: I do PR for a company called Salvation films in between jobs it's great as I'm surrounded by horror films that I get to promote, I go to screenings and use the phone lots.\n\nCC: What's been your most embarrassing moment?\n\nEB: Too many to describe. You have to be more specific!!\n\nCC: What's been the weirdest thing you've ever done?\n\nEB: Oh God - again loads! Whilst filming Bits I had to go up to old age\n\npensioners in the street and ask them if I could tie a plastic cup round their head with a pair of tights. Then I would ask them to catch paper balls that I threw at them in the cup on their heads - most of them did. The excuse was that we were testing their spacial awareness.\n\nCC: What do you like about London?\n\nEB: I've been finding it a bit hectic recently as I come from the seaside and enjoy small towns - you get better gossip and some real characters there - people are less wrapped up in themselves and careers - I find that tiresome sometimes. But I do love Soho in the morning in the summer - best atmosphere.\n\nCC: In light of the work you've done (horror, sci-fi and computer games) would you describe yourself as a geek?\n\nEB: I am a geek in some ways. I am a firm believer in reclaiming the word geek to mean something cool and positive. I wish I were more of a geek because they're the ones with actual talent and knowledge. You just have to make sure you can be sociable too and never be snobby about what you know - it is an instant turn off, and makes you look defensive and insecure. But yes I can be, and yes I love em. In fact it was my idea to run the Geek Watch campaign on Bits for Channel 4 to find the biggest Geek in Britain."
