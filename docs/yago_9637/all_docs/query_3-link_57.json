        "text": "CRADLE OF FEAR\n\nDirector: Alex Chandon\n\nStarring: Dani Filth, Eileen Daly, Emily Bouffante (Emily Booth), Rebecca Eden\n\nCradle of Fear is a spirited Urban Gothic-type British anthology movie from the director of Pervirella, here teaming up with the lead singer of Goth metal band Cradle of Filth (whose other members feature in cameo roles). Obviously made with a very modest budget, the film frequently seems amateurish (a microphone features prominently in an early shot, for example), but, on the more positive side, it has bucket-loads of gore, some pretty decent special effects courtesy of Hellraiser veterans Creature FX, and some cute babes running around with very little  if anything  on, so its generally very entertaining.\n\nAll the luverly gore comes courtesy of the BBFC, who, despite what you might have read elsewhere, have passed the film completely uncut: a sure sign that things have changed radically at Soho Square. The disc is coded for Region 0, in PAL format."
