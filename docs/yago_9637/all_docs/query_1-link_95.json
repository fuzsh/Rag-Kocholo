        "text": "TICKETS: https://cstpdx-com.seatengine.com/shows/84867\n\nClinton Street Theater, Friday Sept 14, 11PM\n\nStarring ‘Queen of Erotica’ Miss Kitten Natividad, cult retro rocker King Khan, Mexican Elvis El Vez, narration by Aussie rock devil Tex Perkins and a stomping sound track by some of Melbourne’s finest garage rockers, ‘Fags in the Fast Lane’ is set in a hyper-real world packed with bizarre characters, revolting villains, and larger than life heroes.\n\n“Producer/Designer/Writer/Director Josh Sinbad Collins is a trash-auteur par excellence who has built a world of gay superheroes, cock-worshippers, elderly hookers, and mutant burlesque queens that defies comparison, though one could certainly start with John Waters, Ted V Mikels, the Kuchar brothers, and certainly Russ Meyer. In fact, after first viewing the film, I described it to a friend as ‘what you might get if Russ Meyer were gay and tried to make a film on ten hits of acid.'” – Dangerous Minds\n\nWhen Beau and his Herculean sidekick set off to avenge a spree of violent attacks on their fellow gays, he is waylaid on a vital mission for his beloved mama, Kitten, when her GILF bordello is robbed by the giantess leader of a grotesque burlesque show. With the help of a lethal cross dressing Persian Princess and a Bollywood eunuch assassin, this unlikely team of avengers set off to retrieve the lost booty in a full-throttle, rock ‘n’ roll feast of camp destruction and dangerous dance numbers. Will they be able to recover Kitten’s beloved jewels and magical golden phallus? They’d better!\n\nBarreling straight out of the crazy mind of Josh Collins (Pervirella, Perv Parlor) like a revved up muscle car down a comic strip highway, ‘Fags in the Fast Lane’ is a movie put together with comedic charm, glue gun and lashings of lipstick.\n\n‘Fags in the Fast Lane’ takes off in the tradition of lost GBLT classics such as ‘The Gay Deceivers’, ‘The Pink Angels’, ‘Zorro the Gay Blade’ and Thailand’s recent and amazing ‘Miss Lady Boy’.\n\nCollins, who’s last film Pervirella was shot in London, has been a fan of the Trashploitation genre since his school days, stating “Trash cinema sticks a gaudy finger up at anyone who tows the line. It challenges, it outrages, it undermines the norm. Trash cinema is punk cinema. Why be good, when you can be bad.”\n\nPacked with old school special effects, trompe-oeuils illusions, detailed model work and distorted perspectives the film lavishes in the clichés of the movies of Hammer, Carry On, Mario Bava, John Waters and Russ Meyer. It will make you laugh out loud at its sheer silliness, sharp dialogue, bad taste and colorful sex scenes.\n\n“Trashploitation is not about realism,” states Collins, “rather using its own twisted version of reality to critique and lampoon contemporary comforts and morals. It seems to me that a thrill packed ride of genuine home made cinema that laughs at its own cheapness and yet triumphs over it in so many different ways is a welcome poke at our ever increasingly PC world.”\n\nFor ‘Fags in the Fast Lane’ the posters, costumes, effects and sets are slammed together in the most innovative way, everything is recycled and improvised to produce as loud, lurid, sexed up, and often gory a piece of entertainment as possible.\n\nCult film site Digitally Obsessed’s Jeff Ulmer said of Collins’ films, “Deviant charm is to be gleaned for those with an appetite for camp. If you macerate a Terry Gilliam-on-acid sense of machinery and atmosphere, a Bad Taste-era Peter Jackson sense of gore, with bathroom humour and knockoffs of Flesh Gordon, you’d be in the ballpark.”\n\nShot on a modest budget throughout 2015 and 2016, ‘Fags in the Fast Lane’ is a true original, stomping out paths carefully avoided by most of it’s contemporaries. The frenetic pace is kept going by an awesome sound track of disco, rock ‘n’ roll, garage and show-time numbers.\n\nContrary to the standard cinematic fare, there are no guns in Beau’s world, which means the many exciting and outrageous fight sequences use a variety of evil looking and improvised weapons, from Chimpo rolls and dinosaur skeletons to electro prongs and virtual fingers.\n\nUltra Stylish, Ultra Colourful, Ultra Cool, this is one hell of a sleazy underground movies!"
