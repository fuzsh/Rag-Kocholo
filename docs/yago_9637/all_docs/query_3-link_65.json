        "text": "My lifetime obsession with mid-century fashion, music and pop culture has inspired me to produce niche 1960s clothing and costumes since the 1980s.\n\nI'm excited to bring you these current designs and they are my favourite and most wearable to date. I will be adding more, as well as styles for men, so keep checking these pages.\n\nI design, cut the patterns, choose the fabric and make up the clothing all myself so you can be assured of my personal attention to detail with every item of clothing.\n\nI started with a stall in Camden Market, then during the 90s I ran the Babzotica Boutique and Mail Order clothing business from Shoreditch East London sharing premises with the famous analogue recording studio Toe Rag Music. I was lucky enough to be involved with the 1960s garage, mod and rockabilly music scenes during the late 80s & 90s.\n\nTogether with my partner-in-crime Josh Sinbad Collins we ran clubs, events and weekenders in UK, Spain and Las Vegas where I would create gogo outfits and costumes for the dancers, bands and acts that graced the stage.\n\n1960s films and music have always been a huge inspiration for my designs and I have produced costumes for several low-brow movie productions as well as independant music videos.\n\nInbetween making clothes I organise The Wild Weekend, the mid-century music and culture weekender, and I own The LuWOW Tiki cocktail bar in Melbourne.\n\nI'm a Londoner born and bred, however I now live in Melbourne. I still maintain close contacts with my home town. Barbara Blaze Collins"
