        "text": "As soon as she left Goldsmiths university with a film degree under her belt she was asked to audition for L!VE TV where she cut her teeth presenting studio shows learning talkback and autocue with much naturalism and gaining a large fanbase. This brought her to the attention of producers at Channel 4 who recruited her to write and co-present the popular computer game review show BITS with Aleks Krotoski and Emily Newton-Dunn. Emily went on to present Bits for four series until the show ended in 2001.\n\nMore presenting work immediately followed for Bravo (which later became DAVE) and notable credits include paintball challenge show Mission: Paintball, the carnage-filled series Demolition and her own cult film show Shock Movie Massacre. She gained the coveted role as a Music Festival Reporter for Channel 4’s flagship show The Big Breakfast. She then guested on Banzai for E4 and released a single with B-Movie actress Eileen Daly which they performed on the Channel 4 show Eurotrash.\n\nEmily’s versatility, enthusiasm and ability to jump at any project means she can switch from presenting to acting with equal aplomb working on several horror films as a lead actor including Cradle of Fear (2001), Evil Aliens (2005), Doghouse (2009 with Danny Dyer and Stephen Graham), Shed of The Dead (2019) co starring Ewen Mackintosh of The Office fame and Lauren Socha (Misfits) as well as horror giants Michael Berryman, Kane Hodder and Bill Moseley. More recently she starred in They’re Outside (2020) and Werewolf Santa (2021)\n\nHer love of B-movies landed her the role of Eden presenting the cult movie clip show OutTHERE for Channel 5 and Bravo. She then presented a spin-off from this series, Shock Movie Massacre, again for Bravo. For this globe-trotting series Emily not only presented and interviewed the likes of Dario Argento, Tinto Brass and Lloyd Kauffman but also contributed her own stunts and action sequences.\n\nEmily’s cult status and solid fan base led to director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) asking her to appear in his fake trailer ‘Don’t’ for the legendary Quentin Tarantino film Grindhouse.\n\nEmily has been the face and voice of the Horror Channel for 15 years, since 2007 which in MAY 2022 reached its natural end as a channel. Booth regularly reported from horror festivals around the UK with a strong relationship with Frightfest having presented there since 2007.\n\nShe has contributed to many documentaries such as Channel 4’s 100 Scariest Moments and The Perfect Scary Movie as well as a Radio One documentary with Colin Murray about torture porn.\n\nEmily stretched her wings once more when she wrote, produced and starred in her own short film SELKIE which premiered at Frightfest in 2014 to much acclaim.\n\nDuring Lockdown Emily also produced and presented her own podcast The Horror Booth interviewing big-name guests from the genre."
