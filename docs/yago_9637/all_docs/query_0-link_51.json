It's one of my go-to films when I want something entertaining to watch and I never get tired of seeing it's gross-out humour. It works equally well in a cinema as it does at home and having seen it play in film festivals in other countries, I can confirm that the comedy works in all languages.\n\nThe story is simple - a group of young offenders travel to a remote village in North Yorkshire to do community service, only to discover that the inbred locals have a taste for human flesh and like to put on a 'show' with the outsiders as the (unwilling) main attractions. The story is not new - teenagers on the run from psychotic murderers, but Inbred is carried off with such aplomb that it rises above many inferior Hollywood movies with much bigger budgets.\n\nJo Hartley (This is England) adds some weight to the largely unknown cast and plays the social worker cum action heroine very well. Dominic Brunt (Paddy from Emmerdale and also a huge horror afficionado) plays the role of Podge, the cross-dressing, chainsaw-wielding butcher with huge success. Previously known for the fairly risable Pervirella and Cradle of Fear (starring Cradle of Filth's Dani Filth and Emily Booth), director Alex Chandon returned after 10 years with an instant cult classic."
