        "text": "Film-makers hope to begin shooting the film in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, in July.\n\nThe plot revolves around a group of wayward teenagers who are sent into the countryside with their guardians to carry out community service.\n\nTrouble flares when they find the small fictional town of Mortlake filled with “inbred”\n\nlocals who do not like outsiders.\n\nThe black comedy horror has been described as a cross between television series The League of Gentlemen and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and has the tagline “They came in peace. They left in pieces”.\n\nThirsk Mayor Derek Adamson is worried some viewers may believe the Mortlake locals are based on real people.\n\nHe said: “We do not want that sort of publicity.\n\n“If the film is promoting the area or it is a historical piece, then that is fine and we have no problem with it.\n\n“It is quite probable that people will think the characters in the film are like real Thirsk people and that is not a good impression.”\n\nScriptwriter Paul Shrimpton, of Carlton Miniott, near Thirsk, and director Alex Chandon are working on the project.\n\nMr Chandon’s other films include Cradle of Fear and Pervirella, which featured an orgy.\n\nCouncillor Adamson said: “If it is anything like his previous work, then I do not think he will be really welcome here.\n\n“I think people will draw comparisons to real people, and if one of the crew lives here, I would hope they would want to put a more positive angle on it.”\n\nFunding for the project and most of the cast are in place, and it is hoped the film will be released next year.\n\nMr Shrimpton, 35, worked on the 2005 short horror movie Slow Rot, which was filmed in Thirsk.\n\nHe said: “Alex had three scripts which, for one reason or another, did not happen and then a fourth one came in and I re-wrote it.\n\n“This will give a boost to Thirsk and it will bring a few more people into the town.\n\n“Hopefully, this will lead to more films being made in Thirsk.\n\n“If the community gets behind it, we could make something we can be really proud of.”\n\nThe film crew is looking for a semi-derelict farmhouse near Thirsk to use as a location, as well as accommodation to stay in.\n\nAuditions for Thirsk residents who would like to appear as extras will take place at an open casting session, although details are yet to be finalised.\n\nGo to inbredmovie.com"
