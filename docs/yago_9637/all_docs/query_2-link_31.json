        "text": "When exploring the wineries of Napa Valley, Domaine Chandon is a must-see! You may recognize the name, and may be able to purchase some of their wines at your local store, but there are some wines that are only available at the winery’s Retail Shop. Plus, nothing beats a visit to the source where their incredible sparkling and still wines are created.\n\nBecause a wine can only be labeled as “champagne” if it is made in Champagne, France, the delicious bubbly from Domaine Chandon, made using the traditional method used in France, is labeled as sparkling wine. Founded in 1973 by Moet and Chandon, Domaine Chandon was the first French owned sparkling producer in Napa Valley. Along with sparkling wines, you’ll also find still wines created from the types of grapes used to create their sparkling.\n\nDiscover more, and taste for yourself, during a tour or a tasting at Domaine Chandon’s beautifully landscaped winery. If you have a group of less than 10 people, you can stop by their tasting room for a flight of sparkling and still wines. You can also purchase wines by the glass, and by the bottle, to enjoy during your visit while relaxing on the Terrace where tables are first-come, first-served. Or you can opt for the Sparkling Tour & Tasting where a Chandon ambassador will take you on a behind-the-scenes tour of the winery that ends with a tasting. Special, private tours and tastings are available by appointment for groups of 10 or more.\n\nThis California sparkling wine pioneer sold their one millionth bottle of sparkling wine by 1979. By their tenth anniversary, at least 7,000,000 bottled were sold. Now in their 43rd year, Domaine Chandon has vineyards throughout Napa Valley in Yountville, Carneros, and Mt. Veeder. Not only are their Estate vineyards Napa Green Certified Land, but their winery is also a Napa Green Certified Winery recycling 8 tons of metal and 3 tons of plastic a year.\n\nDomaine Chandon’s winemaking team reflects a dedicated, talented force! Senior Winemaker – Sparkling Wine, Tom Tiburzi, has spent more than 25 years creating outstanding wines at Domaine Chandon. Pauline Lhote, Winemaker – Sparkling Wine, has been at Domaine Chandon for 10 years. And, Joel Burt, Assistant Winemaker – Still Wines, has been with Domaine Chandon since 2009.\n\nExquisite wines, and welcoming hospitality make Domaine Chandon one of the best wineries to visit in Napa Valley."
