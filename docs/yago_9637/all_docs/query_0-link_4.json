Set in the mythical English land of Condon, the grotesque, power-mad Queen Victoria builds a wall around the country and establishes a \"Monarchy of Terror.\" Intellectuals and \"pervs\" are prosecuted and killed, or driven underground to form the \"Cult of Perv.\" Their leader, the Demon Nanny gives birth to a possible savior, then dies. The infant Pervirella grows to maturity with supernatural speed and shows amazing abilities, including raging nymphomania whenever her magical necklace is removed. Pervirella is sought by various rebels, agents of Victoria, the Cult of Perv, and a trio of witches. Eventually she teams up with Amicus Reilly, a James Bond spoof played to stiff, campy perfection by the late David Warbeck. Wild adventures ensue!",

Pervirella herself, Emily Booth, appeared in Edgar Wright’s mock trailer, Don’t. I was also duly surprised to see David Warbeck (The Beyond) as super spy Amicus Reilly.\n\nThe stop-motion animation and miniatures on fishing line are strangely charming, but this is mostly a gross, cacophonous mess, like Monty Python reimagined by Troma, but in the worst way possible. The convoluted plot concerns Queen Victoria’s “Monarchy of Terror” and the rebellious Cult of Perv, who help usher their savior, Pervirella, into the world for a series of globe-trotting steampornk “adventures.”\n\nThis might have been something with…\n\nCan I fault a movie for doing too much and trying too hard? For being so over the top that it uses three fake trailers before the movie to start the story? No, of course not. Those are the high points. Along with the lovely homemade steampunk aesthetic. Queen Victoria was great and the air ship and ministure city were made with love.\n\nWhere the movie failed is in its excesses. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with an orgy scene. It wasn't xxx if that were a problem (or for some it might be the problem). The issue is it goes on way too long and drags the third act to a halt. The movie has already started to bend…"
