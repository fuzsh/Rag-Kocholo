Pervirella is a classic comic book character based on Modesty Blaise, Barbarella and Penelope Pitstop: beautiful yet deadly. Growing into a voluptuous damsel from a baby within seconds, Pervirella's childlike innocence plays host to a lustful, deceitful sex demon of incredible powers!\n\nPowers coveted by the evil Cult of Perv and the plant sorcerers of Amazonia! Powers only held in check by an ancient amulet with a rather loose clasp! Powers which could corrupt her soul and plunge the world into turmoil!\n\nWe follow the erratic progress of a group of oddball adventurers as they fight their way across strange continents in even stranger vehicles. They flirt with danger all the way, in a desperate romp to save the luscious Pervirella!"
