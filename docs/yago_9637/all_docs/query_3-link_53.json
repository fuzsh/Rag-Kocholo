        "text": "If you are a UK Horror fan who follows the local film-making community, then the name ‘Emily Booth’ will certainly mean something to you.\n\nThe face of UK Horror alongside legends from the likes of the classic Hammer films of the past, Booth has certainly carried the baton, not only as the face of the Horror Channel on Freeview, but also carving a name for herself in genre work.\n\nAlways friendly and accessible as a person away from the camera, Film And TV Now had the pleasure of talking to Emily during a break from her schedule\n\nFILM AND TV NOW: You have become the face of Horror in the UK and you are such a prolific presence. How does it feel to be part of this genre of film-making?\n\nEMILY BOOTH: An absolute honour! I feel I should do more to earn that accolade though there’s hundreds of people doing amazing things in this genre, I’ve always loved this genre and am proud to be in it – the community and events alone make this genre unique – its more than just the films, the films have created the community and the passion.\n\nFTVN: How did you start out in the Arts?\n\nEB: I’m a bit of a funny one really as I have always straddled TV presenting with acting – though more on the presenting side of things, I think I always wanted to perform in some way but I never trained in anything specific so did not have the confidence to do acting alone! It really all started with moving to London and while on my Media degree at Goldsmiths I somehow wrangled the title role of Pervirella when I met the film makers! That led to Cradle of Fear and eventually a TV presenting position.\n\nFTVN: The independent film-making sector in the UK is something you are familiar with. Tell us a bit about your experiences in this sector.\n\nEB: Pervirella and Cradle of Fear really were ‘Guerilla style film making with a ‘skeleton crew’ (not literally obviously!) and getting away with as much as possible in public! The experiences that stood out for me are Cradle of Fear – being covered literally in animal meat and organs for my ‘baby bursting through the stomach’ scene (even though was Vegetarian at the time!) and having to walk through Oxford Street while they secretly filmed me randomly screaming in terror at various unsuspecting members of the public (I had to imagine I was seeing demons in the street a la Jacobs Ladder!)\n\nFTVN: In terms of behind the scenes, who do you admire on a film crew the most?\n\nEB: Do you mean generally?! That’s very hard to say! I remember interviewing Jake West when I shot my own behind the scenes video diary for the zombie film Doghouse\n\nYou can see them here – they’re really cool – all from an actors perspective.\n\nI asked Jake ‘What’s it like being a director?!’ And he said its really tough its like making a thousand decisions a day!” So of course I admire the director. But also the creatives you don’t see much like the special effects make up crew and wardrobe departments – they get yelled at a lot and put so much passion in! Usually because time is always short on set and make up department are constantly being asked on the radio “When will Emily be ready?!!!”\n\nFTVN: Do you have a specific process to guide you through your acting performances?\n\nEB: No! I wish I did! I am learning on the job. You just have to channel that person I suppose – and have the confidence to experiment a little with the character, give them idiosyncrasy. You need to know them, and their history and life experiences so you know how you might react. (it’s not acting its RE-acting!!) I did need 20 minutes to myself to work myself up into a tormented crying state for my role as Tracy in The Reverend though as I find it very hard to be in a constant state of terror or fear or desperation on set because everyone is light hearted and having fun, chatting away and you have to be completely out of that mind set and stay in your own. It sounds wanky but its true – and quite difficult or me as I’m used to being everyones best mate!\n\nFTVN: You have been a presenter of Horror content on places like the Horror Channel. How has that experience been for you?\n\nEB: I’ve loved being the face of Horror Channel, I’ve interviewed nearly everyone in the UK horror scene and indeed all over the world partly because of that job and doing 13 years working for them I’ve researched thousands of horror titles on IMDB so have increased my knowledge!\n\nFTVN: What is your favourite Horror film?\n\nEB: I don’t do favourites! Too hard. So many great ones but the standout films are always ones from your formative years so my general answer to that (even though these are not the best films – just ones that imprinted on my grey matter) Cat People (1982) The Company of Wolves, An American Werewolf in London, Jaws – in more recent years The Others, Hereditary, The Orphanage – and in terms of undiscovered gems I loved Starry Eyes, Spring, The Perfection. And tons more – its too hard to be specific!\n\nFTVN: Is there a particular dream role or project you would respectively love to play and see realised in your career?\n\nEB: I would like to be taken more seriously! I only ever get comedic roles or splatter stuff which is fine and amazing fun – but as I get older a DREAM role would be playing a tormented mother or something I relate to more now. If we are talking silly dreams – working with Neil Jordan as he writes women so well and I love his imagination and how it translates on film – I’d also love to be a bawdy Madam or do a period costume piece – I’m quite good with accents!\n\nFTVN: Are there other genres of film-making that you are looking to branch out into?\n\nEB: I have the germ of an idea as a writer but I am terrible with structure and fleshing things out – but I am looking to team up with a good writer to write a feature about a former scream queen and how she’s struggling with life and a daughter in a modern world – its all set at a big fan convention, where the shit really hits the fan! So its now in print no one better copy me – you saw it here first!!! Its my baby.\n\nFTVN: How has the whole #MeToo initiative affected you?\n\nEB Nothing directly to be honest. I think as women we can all, unfortunately relate to it all – we’ve all experienced harassment and to some – its to horrific levels, it is fantastic that its all coming out now because so much of it including unfair pay, unfair expectations and abuse has gone on and swept under the carpet way too long. Its fantastic that both men and women learn to change and improve as a society. As long as its doesn’t go too far and men are too scared to even give you a compliment or flirt with you – that’s just bloody ridiculous!\n\nFTVN: Tell us about your upcoming projects?\n\nEB: I recently wrapped on a feature film called They’re Outside with a fantastic producer Anthony Airell who has a whole slate of exciting projects coming up. ‘They’re Outside’ is kind of like The Blair Witch Project meets The Wickerman and I play Penny the quirky best friend of a very disturbed and agrophobic woman. Its shot found footage style but its more of a mockumentary with interviews and flash back footage. They shot guerilla style at my home town Hastings’ annual ‘Jack in the Green’ May Day festival so it all looks genuine – I can’t wait to see it as I play a very different kind of character – its all very natural / underplayed character acting – so totally different challenge for me! Its still in post production.\n\nFTVN: Finally, how do you feel the London Frightfest has contributed to the exposure of Independent Horror Cinema in both the UK and Internationally?\n\nEB: Its crucial. FrightFest provides a platform for people in the industry to become recognized! It can get you an agent, or a distribution deal – so everyone who makes a horror now wants it to premiere at FrightFest!\n\nFor more about Emily, visit:\n\nhttp://www.emilybooth.co.uk/\n\nFor more about Horror Channel, visit:\n\nhttp://www.horrorchannel.co.uk/\n\nFor more about Frightfest, visit:"
