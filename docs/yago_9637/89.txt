Emily Booth (aka Emily Bouff/Emily Bouffante) has been a feature of the low budget British exploitation scene for over 20(!) years now. Born in Chester, but raised in Hastings, Emily made her debut in Alex Chandons legendary low budget exploitation flick ‘Pervirella’. In the film she featured as the titular Pervirella. In the same year, she also had a small role (sadly cut) in the big budget sci-fi/horror flop Event Horizon.

After this, she split her time between exploitation film roles, and her burgeoning career as a TV presenter. During this time, she worked on shows as diverse as BITS (a videogame review show she co-wrote), The Big Breakfast, and Shock Movie Massacre. Possibly her best known role came in 2001, when she co-starred in ‘Cradle Of Fear’ alongside musician Dani Filth. She also starred in another cult favourite, Evil Aliens.

Most recently she could be seen in the Noel Clarke and Danny Dyer starring film Doghouse, as well as on the menu screens for Jake Wests epic video nasties documentary. She remains an icon of British horror & exploitation cinema.
