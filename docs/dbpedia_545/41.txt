Who's arresting who? Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson (left) with Borough Commander Dave Grant

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson visited Haringey borough's patrol base in Wood Green yesterday to talk to some of the officers and staff that provide a service to the people of Haringey.

One of the reasons for the Commissioner's visit was to recognise the work of Assistant Forensic Practitioner Cass Paton who is one of a team on the borough responsible for finding forensic crime scene evidence.

Cass has recently been recognised with a Borough Commander Commendation. In addition to her local work, she made a big difference to the lives of many families in the aftermath of the 2004 Tsunami in Asia, working seven days a week as part of the team involved in identifying victims through DNA and bringing a sense of closure for many families that she never even got to meet.
