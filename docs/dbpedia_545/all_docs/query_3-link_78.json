        "text": "Our featured publication for July and August is Hard Drive by Paul Stephenson, published by Carcanet.\n\nWhen his partner suddenly died, life changed utterly for Paul Stephenson. Hard Drive is the outcome of his revisiting a world he thought he knew, but which had been upended. In poems that are affectionate, self-examining, sometimes funny and often surprised by grief in the oddest corners, the poet takes us through rooms, routines, and rituals of bereavement, the memory of love, a shared life and separation. A noted formalist, with a flair for pattern and procedural writing, Stephenson has written a remarkable first book, moving and, despite everything, a hopeful record of a gay relationship. It is also a landmark elegy collection.\n\n‘This is a heart-stopping debut of real emotional force and poetic intelligence. Paul Stephenson approaches the elegy through a kaleidoscopic, inventive, and genuinely moving use of form. The disorientating world of grief is captured with a blade-like precision, and yet Hard Drive is also full of hard-won light. Stephenson looks death in the eyes, and holds his nerve like few others.‘ Seán Hewitt\n\n‘Like Douglas Dunn’s Elegies, Hard Drive is a masterpiece of love and grief. A brilliant and innovative formal poet, Paul Stephenson here applies his great gifts, with heart-breaking clarity and bravery, to the most unfaceable of subjects. The result is poetry of great impact and generosity which, by looking unblinkingly at every aspect of grief, allows us to know our own. The collection is a beautiful hymn to the human capacity for love and, like all great poetry, makes us feel less alone.‘ Jonathan Edwards\n\n‘Paul Stephenson’s debut collection is a wonder. He engages with the subject of grief with wit, intelligence and tenderness – and has imbued so much life and colour into the memory of someone who has passed. This is poetry for anyone who has ever lost someone. Warm and touching, this is poetry that celebrates and mourns those deep connections that we make in life.‘ Niall Campbell\n\n‘Bereavement is the saddest club to which to belong, the saddest territory to annexe. No one is ever prepared for stepping through this portal of loss. These meticulous and attuned poems spare neither reader nor the poet, nor should they. This collection is a stoic and grounded narrative telling of deep-rooted love and loss, of witness and grief. Grief is cast here as praise and loving appraisal upon the death of a life partner. With mordant and exact wit, with compassion and insight, this poet turns a wry and observing eye and sensibility upon regions of fathomless loss. Formally varied, adept in their imaginal reach, the poems honour life at every juncture, even as they mourn a life and a world thrown into sharp focus by the pitiless light shed by death. Equipoise is achieved throughout between personal and official dimensions of a death (these booby-trapped with forms and documentations). Paul Stephenson brings all the tender mechanisms of language to sustain the weight of grief: this is an extraordinarily moving and accomplished collection which I know will command the attention it so richly warrants.‘ Penelope Shuttle\n\n..\n\nMy Monarch\n\n…\n\nPreviously published in Atrium\n\n…\n\nSt. Pancras\n\n…\n\nPreviously published in Atrium\n\n..\n\nHard Drive\n\n…\n\nPreviously published in Irisi\n\n…\n\nHumorous Elbowings\n\n…\n\nPreviously published in Bad Lilies\n\n…\n\n…\n\nPaul Stephenson studied modern languages and linguistics then European studies.

From cities to wilderness, buildings to burrows, and coastlines to fish-tanks, these thirty-two poems and thirteen short stories explore emergence and existence, survival and self-mythology, and the liminal hinterland between humanity and animality.\n\nAnimal Apology\n\nSorry if I fling zoos at you, and when I do,\n\nforelegs spread, the bony tufts of giraffe heads\n\nrip up kitchen tiles, elongations of neck vertebrae\n\nswinging hard and fast like a blotchy orange 5-iron.\n\nYou should probably duck when lobbed elephants swirl\n\nthrough the living room’s low-watt sky, Zeppelins deflating,\n\ntrunks dangling like loose grey guy-ropes, brushing the blinds.\n\nAnd about the single-horned rhinos and hippos, yes, I know:\n\nall that stomping, stampeding, at some small thing you say,\n\nthe mud-soaked noses, nostrils flaring up like fireplaces,\n\nodd-toed ungulates charging into your hell-of-a-day,\n\nunleashing the fury of a fenced and caged species,\n\nthe paying visitors peering and gaping, leaning in\n\nto watch us both, not breeding here in captivity.\n\nPaul Stephenson\n\nBeetle\n\nSolace drove me to this place,\n\nits green hollows,\n\nsearching again for your form, love,\n\nfor it has been seven years –\n\nbilly-witch, bewitcher, solstice creeper,\n\nbold-blinded beast.\n\nI went to the road, its ranks of shimmering carmine,\n\nlooking for you at the edges of belief –\n\nyou, a Da Vinci sketch\n\ntesting the limits of flight\n\nahead of your time\n\nor back with the dinosaur brutes,\n\nout of this world of nets and cables and glare.\n\nI longed for you to cross my palm,\n\nscarab – smooth as a knee cap,\n\ncomplicated as a music box\n\nheld together with tiny pinions,\n\nthe intricate pins and tucks\n\nof your mechanics\n\nworking the unforgiving air –\n\nI took you apart in my mind, found nothing\n\nbut a mandible like a wishbone,\n\none serrated, iconic antler\n\nof bravado, lost bravado.\n\nI keep it for my rising son,\n\nour last mid-summer walks,\n\nhis tender voice breaking in the dusk.\n\nSarah Westcott\n\nNote\n\nThe larvae of the stag beetle, which is becoming increasingly rare, lives in the soil for seven years before it emerges into a fully-grown adult\n\nAnd Then I Was a Sheep\n\nand really, what a treat to find myself\n\namong these friend-shaped clouds or cloud-shaped friends\n\nwho breathe, who bleat, these lovely bits of meat\n\non legs, who take me as something to smell\n\nand imitate. How nice it was to wake\n\nand sing myself, to flounce and fling myself\n\ndown hillsides someone turned to trampolines\n\nquite suddenly. While others keep their snouts\n\nsteadfastly to the ground I blink, I count\n\nmy gifts: this four-wheel drive and this cuisine\n\nthat grows, the way that I can sigh and mean\n\nthat nature is my playground, baby. True,\n\nthe farmer, shearing, has looked into my eyes\n\na little longer than I’d like, as if\n\nhe’s sussed, he’s twigged, and yes, the sheepdog nips\n\nmore keenly at my ankles than the others’,\n\nbut on the whole, I’ve found, it’s easy really\n\nto blend right in, to not stand out. Sometimes,\n\nI miss the feel of the settee beneath me,\n\na glass of something good, but all in all\n\nI wouldn’t go back if I could. I’m less\n\nlonely than I was when I was human,\n\nthe world’s less cold, now that my winter coat\n\nis part of me, and what I really like\n\nare moonlit nights: us lot, the whole, the flock,\n\nhow we all cwtch together in this field,\n\none living mass of white, one fluffy cloud,\n\nthe awesome power of our communal brains –\n\nas if we’d turned the field into the sky,\n\nlike we could think it now, and it would rain.\n\nJonathan Edwards\n\nWelsh English\n\ncwtch cuddle or hug\n\nJellyfish\n\nShe wishes not to be a jellyfish:\n\na lightbulb always flicked on,\n\nunstoppable brain\n\ndribbling thoughts\n\nin tangled strands.\n\nNot to have this heavy head\n\nshe can only hold up\n\nin the dark\n\nunderwater.\n\nNot to flounder\n\non dry land:\n\nungainly blob,\n\ntendrils trailing,\n\nhelpless.\n\nNot to be\n\nthis plucked eye,\n\nalways weeping:\n\n“Do not touch me.\n\nPlease, do not\n\ntouch me.”\n\nMegan Pattie\n\nBuck and Doe\n\nLittle fleecy feet – velvet lucky paws dotty-dabble\n\nmoontide grass, hippey-skip, belly fuzzy-plump\n\nfrom all the nibbling. Cowslip, comfrey. Busy teeth,\n\ngnawy-gnash on root an’ stump, tasty tubers relished down\n\nin tiny gullet swallows, sweet with sugar juice.\n\nMy baby coney-kins, my leveret kith – tufty bullets\n\nquatting in the grass, long and blowy, perfect for this game\n\nof hidey-seek. Coloured mud like groundling truffles,\n\notter brown, gravel grey, knobby flash of banderole behind,\n\nlinty white. Digging thigh-bones muscled strong, footing\n\non the earth with knock-knocks – thumpy-stamp for danger.\n\nMealy unders richly warmed with down, woolsome-snug and kittened\n\nin the stomach of our nest, our darkling womb, our holey safe place\n\ntatted cosy-soft with dandie grasses. Elder-rabbits sage us\n\nwith fine words. Beware the silver necklaces of snares an’ keep\n\naway from Pink Eye with his winking froth of mixie tears.\n\nBuck an’ doe, dancing under wedding skies, kissing\n\nclefty mouths together – mothers innards full of litter dreams,\n\nan’ hope for all her sweetly nipples hung with babbies,\n\nsucking rich an’ growing hoppish strong, foxing clever.\n\nThey make their music – open up the mallow flesh\n\ninside their throats, slither music round their teeth.\n\nUn-soundable to human ear but heard by cloud\n\nand earth – this creature-sing, the joy in field and sky.\n\nthe taste of welter-song turf-spun rich upon our tongues.\n\nJane Burn\n\nHumanagerie contains both poetry and short fiction, and is available to purchase in either hardback or paperback directly from Eibonvale Press:\n\nhttps://www.eibonvalepress.co.uk/books/books_humanagerie.htm\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
