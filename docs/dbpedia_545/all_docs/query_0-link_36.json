        "text": "Priti Patel: \"Strong and decisive new leadership will be required to restore public confidence\"\n\nWriting in the Evening Standard, Priti Patel said the new Met commissioner must tackle policing culture.\n\nThe home secretary will select the next commissioner with help from London mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nShe said: \"Today, as I prepare to begin the process of choosing her successor, I want to reassure Londoners and people across the country of my commitment to selecting the right leader for the largest police force in the UK.\"\n\nOf the potential new candidate, she said: \"Following a series of appalling incidents and too many historical cases involving serving Met Police officers, it is clear that strong and decisive new leadership will be required to restore public confidence in our largest police force.\"\n\nCressida Dick departure will not affect 'Partygate' investigation\n\nThe Met's investigations into alleged Downing Street parties will \"not be affected\" by the change in leadership, a government minister said.\n\nRobert Courts, minister for the Department for Transport, told Sky: \"Police are very used to handling matters where there are different parties involved.\n\n“They are totally independent and I have absolute confidence in their ability to operationally carry out an investigation.\n\n“So they will do that and they will do that in a way that is independent - that will not be affected by the role at the top of the Met.”\n\nWhat is the process for appointing her successor\n\nDame Cressida will continue to serve for a short period to enable an orderly handover, although it is not clear how long this period will be.\n\nThe decision is made by the Home Secretary, currently Priti Patel, but the mayor’s views should be taken into account.\n\nThe Met's website says: \"Both have a role in appointing the Commissioner, with the decision taken by the Home Secretary following consultation with the Mayor.”\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said Boris Johnson must “publicly recuse” himself from involvement in the appointment of Dame Cressida Dick’s successor, due to the police investigation into Downing Street parties.\n\nIt is not thought that Ms Patel anticipates the Prime Minister’s involvement in the process.\n\nWho are the contenders to replace Cressida Dick?\n\nWhile there is no clear frontrunner, here are a couple of the likely candidates for Dame Cressida's job:\n\nMatt Jukes\n\nAn assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner currently working as head of counter-terrorism, is seen by many commentators as a likely contender. Mr Jukes first joined South Yorkshire Police as a Pc before moving to South Wales Police and working his way up the ranks. He rose to become chief constable of South Wales Police before returning to the Metropolitan Police as an assistant commissioner in 2020. So unlike Dame Cressida, who never ran her own force before becoming commissioner, he has prior experience at the helm.\n\nNeil Basu\n\nAnother assistant commissioner who previously worked as the head of counter-terrorism, is also thought to be a likely candidate.\n\nMr Basu has spent his entire career serving in the Metropolitan Police. In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, he said that if someone used the racially offensive comments Boris Johnson had, they would not be admitted into the police force. For some, the comments were seen as political and could prove detrimental to his chances of succeeding Dame Cressida. But Mr Basu is popular among officers and is still widely seen as capable. He is also the most senior police officer of Asian heritage and would be the first minority ethnic commissioner.\n\nLucy D'Ori\n\nThe Chief Constable of the British Transport Police. She previously worked as a senior officer at the Metropolitan Police. During her career, she was in charge of the police response to the Beaufort Park fire in 2006 and she headed up security during Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK in 2015. She would be following in Dame Cressida’s footsteps as the second woman to become Metropolitan Police commissioner.\n\nNick Ephgrave\n\nAssistant commissioner for frontline policing. Mr Ephgrave began his career at the Metropolitan Police but moved to become chief constable of Surrey Police in late 2015. In 2019, he returned to the Metropolitan Police as an assistant commissioner. Like Mr Jukes, he also already has experience leading a police force.\n\nSir Stephen House\n\nDeputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, just below Dame Cressida, and so is a natural contender for the job. The Scottish police officer has worked in several different forces and was appointed chief constable of Police Scotland in 2012. However, during his tenure leading Police Scotland he faced criticism for his use of armed patrols as well as stop and search. He eventually resigned in 2015 over the deaths of Lamara Bell and John Yuill, who lay undiscovered in a wrecked car for three days despite a call from a member of the public. But in 2018, he became an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police and was promoted to deputy commissioner by the end of the year.\n\nMurder victim's brother says Dame Cressida 'disappointed' his family on every level\n\nThr brother of a man killed with an axe in the 1980s said Dame Cressida has \"disappointed\" his family at every level.\n\nAlastair Morgan has spent decades campaigning for justice for his brother Daniel, who was killed with an axe in a pub car park in Sydenham, south-east London.\n\nHe said: “The first time I dealt with Cressida Dick was in 2012 and since then all she has done in relation to my family is just delay, obstruct and disappoint on a huge level.\n\n“Although I think it is a shame that we are seeing another commissioner disappear under a cloud of smoke, it is necessary.\n\n“My only anxiety now is who is going to replace her and face the massive job in front of them of rebuilding confidence in the Met.”\n\nBrother of Daniel Morgan says Cressida Dick 'disappointed' his family\n\nAlsatair Morgan, brother of Daniel Morgan who was found brutally murdered with an axe in the car park of a pub in South East London in 1987, has criticised the outgoing police chief.\n\nAn inquiry into his death last year stated that the Metropolitan Police force was 'institutionally corrupt' with Dame Cressida personally named.\n\nSpeaking to PA on Thursday evening, Alastair said: \"The first time I dealt with Cressida Dick was in 2012 and since then all she has done in relation to my family is just delay, obstruct and disappoint on a huge level.\n\n\"Although I think it is a shame that we are seeing another commissioner disappear under a cloud of smoke, it is necessary.\n\n\"My only anxiety now is who is going to replace her and face the massive job in front of them of rebuilding confidence in the Met.\"\n\nPriti Patel: Cressida Dick was 'devoted to serving the public'\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has paid tribute to Cressida Dick's 'devotion' to the force:\n\nShe said: \"I’d like to thank Dame Cressida for the nearly four decades of her life that she has devoted to serving the public, latterly as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\n\n\"She would be the first to say that she has held the role during challenging times; yet for nearly five years she has undertaken her duties with a steadfast dedication to protecting our capital city and its people – including during the unprecedented period of the pandemic.\n\n\"Leading the Met has also involved driving our national counter terrorism capability at a time of multiple threats while as the first woman to hold the post, she has exemplified the increasingly diverse nature of our police and demonstrated that all can aspire to hold leadership roles in policing in this country today.\"\n\nSarah Everard's murder 'damaged confidence in this fantastic police service'\n\nDame Cressida's statement acknowleged that the murder of Sarah Everard by former Met officer Wayne Couzens - who is know behind bars - had severely wounded Londoners' trust in the police.\n\nShe wrote: \"The murder of Sarah Everard and many other awful cases recently have, I know, damaged confidence in this fantastic police service.\n\n\"There is much to do – and I know that the Met has turned its full attention to rebuilding public trust and confidence.\"\n\nBut Dame Cressida insisted she is 'very optimistic' about the future of the Met, despite the maelstrom of controversy it found itself caught up in."
