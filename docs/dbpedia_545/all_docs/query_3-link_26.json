        "text": "Former Vote Leave Director of Communications Paul Stephenson continues to be held in high esteem by Tory MPs for his election campaign skills. At Hanbury Strategy, which he co-founded, the public affairs pro has pulled together an impressive client list as a result of his close ties with the governing party. And while he’s less media hungry than other Tory strategists, Stephenson’s campaign expertise is still drawn on extensively in SW1.\n\nCheck out the full Power 40 — London class of 2023 list, and read the Letter from the Editors for an explanation of the thinking behind the ranking."
