        "text": "Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has criticised the Prime Minister's use of \"strong phrases\" amid the ongoing violent protests sweeping the UK.\n\nSpeaking with Nick Ferrari at Breakfast, the former Met Commander said he was \"not hugely impressed\" with comments from politicians attempting \"to show they’re in charge of the situation\".\n\nSpeaking on the violent protests that continue to sweep areas of the UK, the former Met chief said that phrases like \"the full force of the law\" should be used as standard.\n\n\"'Standing army’, ‘ramping up the CJS (Criminal Justice System)’ and ‘full force of the law’ - I rather think communities expect the full force of the law to be used against thugs irrespective of who’s motivating them,\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the Prime Minister appeared to be caught up in a war of words with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, following posts made in the wake of the riots labelling 'civil war' in the UK 'inevitable'.\n\nSpeaking with Nick, Sir Mark continued: \"All the thugs on the streets who are causing this damage - and I include in that all the thugs, people who use banners and protecting communities to cause damage - all of them need to face the full force of the law.\"\n\n\"But that’s something that should be in place 24/7,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Hospital staff sent home and shops close early as disorder continues across UK cities - as more arrests made\n\nRead more: 'I haven't fled the UK': Tommy Robinson hits out at comments he is on the run after being spotted at luxury Cyprus hotel\n\nIt comes as six people were arrested in Plymouth after violent disorder overnight, and in Belfast, where police attacked.\n\nViolence across the UK has continued to escalate in recent days, with the PM having chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to plan a response with senior ministers and police representatives.\n\nSpeaking on the post, the Prime Minister's spokesperson said there was \"no justification for comments like that\"."
