        "text": "Former UK police commissioner Paul Stephenson has faced British MPs over the force's role in the phone-hacking scandal.\n\nThe head of Scotland Yard announced his resignation on Sunday after it emerged that the force had hired Neil Wallis, a former deputy newspaper editor now implicated in the scandal, as a media adviser.\n\nSir Paul told the parliamentary committee - which also heard from his former deputy John Yates, who resigned after deciding not to reopen an investigation into phone hacking - that distracting stories surrounding the issue left him no option.\n\n\"When I became aware that Mr Wallis was in some way connected I thought that was a very difficult story, I think it was unfortunate for me. I had no knowledge previously,\" he said.\n\n\"That, together with everything else, I thought it's going to be a significant story, and if I'm going to be a leader and do the right thing by my organisation, I think I've got to do something that's very painful.\"\n\nSir Paul also defended his resignation statement, telling the parliamentary committee that it was not an attack on the way prime minister David Cameron handled the phone-hacking crisis.\n\n\"I was taking no such swipe at the prime minister,\" he told the committee.\n\nIn his resignation statement, Sir Paul appeared to be contrasting his behaviour with that of Mr Cameron, who employed former News of the World tabloid editor Andy Coulson as his communications chief.\n\nHe told the committee he agreed with Mr Cameron that the two situations were not comparable.\n\n\"Of course, the employment of Mr Coulson and the employment by the Met (police) of Mr Wallis was entirely different,\" he said.\n\nSir Paul admitted that 10 members of the Metropolitan Police press office had worked at News International, the British newspaper operation of Mr Murdoch's embattled global business, News Corporation.\n\n\"I understand that there are 10 members of the [department of public affairs] staff who have worked in News International in the past, in some cases journalists, in some cases undertaking work experience with the organisation,\" he said.\n\nBut he denied there was any improper links between the force and the company.\n\nHe also told the committee he did not know the News of the World was engaged in phone hacking, but said in retrospect he was embarrassed the force had hired Wallis as a public relations consultant.\n\nAsked about his relationship with Wallis, who has been arrested over the phone-hacking scandal, Sir Paul said he had no reason to connect him with phone hacking when he was hired for a part-time job in 2009.\n\n\"I had no reason to be concerned about Mr Wallis,\" he told MPs.\n\n\"I heard senior News International figures saying this was a rogue few and people at a senior level didn't know anything about it.\"\n\nSir Paul also faced questions over a five-day break he accepted at a spa where Wallis was a consultant.\n\n\"The owner of Champneys is a family friend connection,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a generous offer, I paid for many treatments, it enabled me to get better very quickly.\n\n\"I do not think [it] was inappropriate in that circumstance. I think it was damnably unlucky, frankly, that it seems Wallis was connected with this and that was devastating news.\"\n\nHe said his stay at the spa was not a secret as he had declared it and added to his hospitality register.\n\nJohn Yates, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer who announced on Monday he too was resigning, also faced the parliamentary committee.\n\nMr Yates decided in 2009 not to reopen the investigation into the News of the World\n\nHe said he did not think the police should take the most blame for past failures on phone hacking and that News International executives were the real culprits because of their failure to cooperate."
