        "text": "Note: series can come and go from streamers, although there may be more stability on branded “channels” like Peacock & Paramount+. I have linked to the listing on JustWatch, an app and website I highly recommend, so you can see current options. You can also adjust search parameters: I’m looking at listings for the USA, but you could choose a different market. Some streamers may not have all of the seasons: JustWatch tells you which seasons are on which ones. This is a work in progress, especially at launch. I intend not only to add more series, but to enhance the listings I already have done. You may see some information about one series and not another as that develops.\n\nSpecial note: if you are IMDb credited on one of these series (cast or crew) and would like to say something to my readers about the show, I’d love to share it with them! Please either comment on this page or contact me on Twitter.\n\n[NOTE: if you’d like to see more recent series, go to Upcoming Additions at the bottom of this page]\n\nDefinitions:\n\nStreaming: I’m really talking about shows that are available On Demand digitally: you choose when you want to watch them\n\nGeek-friendly: this is my shorthand for works which are generally classified as science fiction, fantasy, and/or supernatural horror. There is a lot of impassioned debate about terminology here, but the unifying thing for me here is that they are presented as fiction and that the work would be impossible in current consensus reality. This will be somewhat subjective and I’m open to other opinions\n\nTV: short for “television”, the “tele” part has to do with it being at a distance. When you go to a movie theatre, you have traveled to somewhere to see the movie. With TV, the show has traveled to you. The “vision” part means that there are visual images…it isn’t just sound, like radio. Note that sitcoms existed before TV: there were movie series that were essentially sitcoms, and it was a popular genre on radio\n\nMooW: short for my term for a “Mermaid out of Water” show. A “fish out of water” story has someone in a culture which is unfamiliar to them. The humor often comes from them misunderstanding the local norms. A MooW ups that by having the “fish” have supernatural abilities, or be an extraterrestrial, robot, or possibly something transformed into a person. Their true nature is typically hidden from almost everybody, except their closest inner circle\n\nDiscovered Destiny: my term for a work in which typically the protagonist finds out that they have some special powers (they might be a witch, alien, werewolf…). It often changes their lives & they have to learn to adjust. They may also be opposed by something that doesn’t want those powers to be used\n\nQuest: the protagonist(s) is searching for something…it could be an object, a cure, a place. That makes them go from place to place\n\nFugitive: it’s somewhat similar to quest, but they are running away from something. In many cases, they have an assumed identity, and may help strangers out in a new location before having to move on\n\nGadget: typically, a small technological item that gives the user special abilities. In a geek-friendly TV series, one gadget often can perform a variety of tasks…a “Swiss army knife”\n\nBody Swap: the personality of one person is transferred into another person’s body\n\nGeekified: a geek-friendly element (sci-fi/fantasy (including talking non-human animals)/supernatural horror) is added to a mainstream work in a spin-off (for example, Gilligan’s Planet & Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space)\n\nConsulting Hero: this is a private sector individual with superior capabilities (often a scientist) who assists law enforcement or the military while not officially being part of it (although they might hold some honorary title)\n\nReluctant Hero: the character has some special ability, often unwanted, which makes them best suited for certain “missions”. They wouldn’t normally engage in that kind of activity, but may be influenced to do so by a traditional agency, sometimes in exchange for some sort of aid such as helping in a quest\n\nAnthology Show: rather than having continuing characters/situation/story line, each episode is a stand-alone, beginning and ending in the same episode (although 2-parters are possible). In a Hosted Anthology Show (HAS), the stand-alone stories are introduced by a host, who may also do wrap-ups at the end. These hosts may be famous creators and may be characters, and sometimes are the creators of the show\n\nCute Little Thingie (CLT): a non-human character who may be sentient, but is generally not seen to be on the level of a human and rarely speaks fluently, and who is there partially for comic relief, but may also rescue the group/main character\n\nInfiltration: an evil force (although it could be done by good forces for could reasons) is in positions of power, and the general population doesn’t know it. It could be that aliens have adopted human form (in the movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) or controlled the behavior of humans\n\nPuppetsuit: a costume that has elements that move other than by mimicking the movements of the person (or sometimes non-human animal) inside. For example, eyes might roll or a mouth might open & close\n\nNote: this guide is to help you find things to watch. I’m not specifically recommending all of them, just listing them. Unless it says it wasn’t found, though, I’ve probably seen at least one episode of each of them, and all of the episodes in many cases.\n\nI’m listing the series chronologically, largely based on USA distribution. If two series ran during the same years throughout their runs, I’ll list them alphabetically. If they ran for a different number of years, the shorter run one will be listed first (1966-1968 before 1966-1975, for example).\n\nStreamers\n\nI believe everything that I list is available either ad-supported or NAC (No Additional Cost: you are perhaps paying a monthly fee, or getting it as a perk, and then watching a specific show is not an additional specific fee). When I list availability, I’m not ranking one over another based on order.\n\nBritBox (subscription)\n\nCineverse\n\nCrackle (ad-supported)\n\nThe Film Detective\n\nFilmRise\n\nFunimation\n\nMax, formerly HBOmax, (subscription)\n\nHulu (subscription)\n\nIMDbTV (ad-supported: owned by Amazon), rebranded later as Freevee\n\nNBC (ad-supported: this is not the scheduled broadcast, but on demand, either through an app or at their website)\n\nMidnight Pulp (subscription…may also be an ad-supported tier)\n\nNetflix (subscription)\n\nParamount+ (subscription)\n\nPeacock (there is a free ad-supported tier: these shows are on that tier unless I label it as Premium, which is a subscription)\n\nPlex (ad-supported)\n\nPluto (ad-supported)\n\n(Amazon) Prime (subscription)\n\nRetroCrush\n\nRoku (The Roku Channel) (ad-supported: you do not need a Roku device, we watch it on a Fire TV)\n\nTubi (ad-suppported)\n\nYouTube: I’m cautious about listing things on YouTube, out of concern for possible copyright infringement. However, there are many things legitimately on YouTube, sometimes in the public domain (not under copyright protection), and sometimes posted by the rightsholder. As a rule of thumb, I figure that if it has been on YouTube for a few years and has had a substantial number of views, it is probably okay (since it hasn’t been taken down). If there’s an alternative, I’ll list that\n\n1940s\n\nThe Howdy Doody Show (1947-1960) | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\n“It’s Howdy Doody time…” Pioneering and landmark children’s television program, combining puppets and humans, and with a live audience of children (called “The Peanut Gallery”). “Buffalo Bob” Smith was the main human host, and Howdy Doody was the principal puppet/marionette. Initially evocative of a circus, the show evolved into being set in an old West town (“Doodyville”). There were lots of other characters, both human and puppet/marionettes, with the latter also including NHAs (Non-Human Animals), from an elephant to a turtle. Standouts included: Princess Summerfall Winterspring (who appeared as both a puppet and as played by Judy Tyler); Clarabell, a clown (1st played by Robert Keeshan, who would later play Captain Kangaroo), who didn’t speak until the last episode; Phineas T. Bluster, the unsympathetic Mayor (a puppet); and Flub-a-Dub, a fantasy chimera. The show had a big impact on pop culture and there was a lot of behind-the-scenes drama. Also known for its sing-along theme song\n\nCast: Bob Smith; Robert Keeshan; Dayton Allen; Judy Tyler; Lew Anderson; Allen Swift; guests include Fred Allen; Gabby Hayes; Spike Jones\n\nAwards: twice Emmy nominated, and a Peabody Award\n\nLights Out (1949-1952) | Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nFirst a popular OTR (Old Time Radio) show, four specials were televised in the early year of 1946. In 1949, it became this anthology series. It tended towards horror, but particular episodes could include science fiction. Burgess Meredith, Ross Martin, & John Carradine all appeared multiple times\n\nBefore the series: Old Time Radio show from 1934-1947\n\nAfter the series: a 1972 pilot for a revival\n\nCaptain Video and His Video Rangers (1949-1955) | Internet Archive, YouTube (last checked 14 January 2024)\n\nCaptain Video (mostly played by Al Hodge) was a consulting hero, a citizen scientist who nonetheless wore a military-type uniform and whose sidekick (Don Hastings) was just called “Ranger”, as though it was a rank. In over 1,500 episodes (most now lost), the Captain fought a variety of enemies (often recurring) in classic space opera fashion. One notable element was the use of Westerns which helped stretch the budget. Viewers were told that the short segment of a Western film was about one of the Captain’s agents on Earth, even though there would be no reference to Captain Video or space. A robot, I Tobor, appeared in 7 episodes.\n\nFandom, merch, pop culture references: Ed Norton on The Honeymooners was portrayed as a fan, even wearing a space helmet while watching the show. A home video chain was named Captain Video\n\nConcurrent spin-off: The Secret Files of Captain Video (1953-1954)\n\n1950s\n\nBuck Rogers (1950-1951) | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nSince this version of the space opera was broadcast live, it has for the most part not survived (although one episode, Ghost in the House, from 19-December-1950 is available. At this point, Robert Pastene was playing Buck & Lou (Lucy) Prentis was Wilma Deering). Eva Marie Saint played Wilma Deering in 3 episodes\n\nCast: Harry Kingston, Robert Pastene, Lou Prentis, Harry Sothern, Sanford Bickart, Eva Marie Saint, Earl Hammond\n\nCrew includes: director Babette Henry (8 episodes); writer Gene Wyckoff (7 episodes)\n\nTales of Tomorrow (1951-1953) | Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nAn anthology series, reportedly conceived in part by Theodore Sturgeon, and largely based on existing stories (some newer, some classic). Leslie Nielsen (in his pre-comedy days) appears in six episodes. Lon Chaney Jr. appears as the Frankenstein monster\n\nCaptain Z-Ro (1951-53, 1953-1956) | Tubi (last checked 9 June 2024)\n\nOriginally a 15 minute local show in San Francisco, it became a 24 minute nationally syndicated show: the latter is what appears to be available. While the look may have been space opera, is really a time travel show, and even a “continuity cop” show (correct deviations in the past to maintain the timeline the way you know it). Captain Z-Ro (Ray Steffens) has a time machine (the ZX-99). He & his teenage sidekick, Jet (Bruce Haynes) may observe some change in history, typically with a famous figure (including Genghis Khan and Leonardo da Vinci), then travel back to fix it\n\nNot found: Adventures of Superman (1952-1958) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nTopper (1953-1955) | Roku, Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nIn this “mermaid out of water” series, Leo G. Carroll takes over the role of Cosmo Topper from Roland Young in the movie series. He’s stodgy & settled, but haunted by the ghosts of an afterlife of the party couple, Marion Kerby (Anne Jeffreys) & George Kerby (Robert Sterling) & a St. Bernard named Neil who died trying to rescue them from an avalanche\n\nCast: Anne Jeffreys, Robert Sterling, Leo G. Carroll, Buck, Lee Patrick, Thurston Hall, Kathleen Freeman, Edna Skinner…; guests/recurring include: John Banner (2 episodes), Nancy Kulp (2), Steve Reeves, Lyle Talbot (2), Maudie Prickett, Natalie Schafer, Reginald Denny, Hugh Beaumont, Charles Lane, Jesse White, Jay Novello, Howard McNear, Phyllis Coates…\n\nCrew includes: director Lew Landers (19); screenwriter Stephen Sondheim (11)…\n\nBefore the show: 1926 novel & 1932 sequel (Topper Takes a Trip) by Thorne Smith; 1937 movie (Cary Grant/Constance Bennett/Roland Young) and sequels Topper Takes a Trip (1939) & Topper Returns (1941); radio series in 1945\n\nFandom, merchandise, pop culture references: one “special effect” used on the series was Topper walking an invisible Neil (by using a stiffened leash). Those leashes were sold in novelty shops, but I’m not sure if they were ever specifically tied to Topper\n\nRocky Jones, Space Ranger (1954) | Roku, Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nSpace opera with the heroic Space Rangers from Earth, led by Rocky Jones (Richard Crane). On his side: Winky (Scotty Beckett), then later alien Biff (James Lydon), his peppy sidekick; Professor Newton (Maurice Cass), and his ward, Bobby (Robert Lyden); and Vena Ray (Sally Mansfield), navigator. Ann Robinson (War of the Worlds) played both an ally and an opponent: Juliandra and her evil twin, Noviandra. A main baddie was Cleolanta (Patsy Parsons). Episodes have survived in part because the series was filmed, rather than performed live, as was common\n\nFlash Gordon (1954-1955) | Pluto, Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nSteve Holland plays Alex Raymond’s space opera hero Flash Gordon, with Irene Champlin as Dale Arden & Joseph Nash as Dr. Zarkov\n\nCrew: Bruce Geller, later the Emmy-winning producer of Mission: Impossible, wrote the Flash Gordon and the Return of the Androids episode\n\nBefore the series: 1934 comic strip by Alex Raymond. Three Buster Crabbe serials 1936-1940\n\nAfter the series: 1979-1980 animated series. 1980 Dino De Laurentiis movie. 1986 Defenders of the Earth animated team-up series. 1996 animated series. 2007 Sci-Fi Channel live action series\n\nCaptain Midnight (1954-1958) | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nThe character of Captain Midnight was effectively rebooted from comics to radio to a movie serial to this TV series, with significant changes to the pilot hero & the supporting cast and situation. However, kids could still send away for a secret decoder! In this version, Richard Webb plays consulting hero Captain Midnight, who has a rocketplane, but doesn’t go to other planets.\n\nBefore the series: 1938-1949 radio show; 1942- newspaper strip; 1942-1948 comic book; 1942 movie serial (Captain Midnight)\n\nQuartermass II (1955) | Cultpix (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nSheena: Queen of the Jungle (1955-1956) | Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024))\n\nIrish McCalla plays comic book jungle-dwelling hero Shena. Christian Drake plays ally Bob Rayburn…and Neal the Chimp plays Chim/Cham\n\nCast includes: Irish McCalla, Chrsitian Drake, Neal the Chimp; guests include: Virgil Richardson, Lee Weaver, Enrique Lucero, Claudio Brook, Robert Shayne, Nestor Paiva, John Banner\n\nBefore the series: 1938 comic book by Will Eisner & Jerry Eiger\n\nAfter the series: 1984 movie with Tanya Roberts; 2000 TV series with Gena Lee Nolin\n\nNot found: Science Fiction Theatre (1955-1957) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nNot found: Mighty Mouse Playhouse (1955-1967) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nNot found: Captain Kangaroo (1955-1984) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nNot found: Space School (1956) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nThe Gumby Show (1956-1968) | Prime (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\n“If you’ve got a heart, then Gumby’s a part of you.” Claymation series starring Gumby & his pony pal Pokey, too. Listing in progress\n\nColonel Bleep (1957-1960) | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\n“And now, stand by for adventure! 3…2…1 in the exciting story of…” It may seem odd that the devastating weapon, the atomic bomb, could inspire so much entertainment for children, but that was certainly the case for Colonel Bleep. The colonel, an animated alien, came to Earth from the planet Futura, attracted by atomic testing. The atomic blasts also awaken an amiable caveman named Scratch. They represent the past and the future and protect the Earth from menaces including Dr. Destructo and the Black Knight of Pluto. Representing the present is…a living puppet called Squeak. There was almost no dialogue in the shorts, just melodramatic narration by Noah Tyler\n\nThe Veil (1958) | Cultpix, IndiePix, Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\n“Good evening. Tonight I’m going to tell you another strange and unusual story of the unexplainable which lies beyond the veil.” HAS (Hosted Anthology Series) starring Boris Karloff (who also appeared in almost every episode). with the intro usually done in front of a fireplace. Interestingly, the Hal Roach Studios series never aired in 1958. The episodes were purportedly based on real events\n\nCast (all are guests besides Karloff) includes: Whit Bissell, Myron Healey, Patrick Macnee, George Hamilton, Morris Ankrum\n\nCrew: series directors include George Waggner, Herbert L. Strock, Arthur Hiller\n\nThe Invisible Man (1958-1959) | Freevee, Pluto, Roku, Tubi, Xumo (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nPutatively based on H.G. Wells novel, but not having much in common with it except for a scientist becoming invisible, the series is much more of an adventure thriller and the Invisible Man himself (here named Peter Brady, voiced by Tim Turner) is not a “monster”, but clearly a hero. Interestingly, he becomes known to the public, and people in trouble may seek his help. Peter’s sister Diane (Lisa Daniely) and young daughter Sally (Deborah Watling) are a big part of the show\n\nCast includes: Tim Turner, Lisa Daniely, Deborah Watling, Ernest Clark, Bruce Seton, Robert Raglan, Lloyd Lamble; guests include: Barbara Shelley, Charles Gray, Robert Brown, Patrick Troughton, Joan Hickson, Mai Zetterling, Hazel Court, Desmond Llewelyn, Dennis Price, Anton Diffring, Oliver Reed, Peter Swanwick\n\nCrew includes: producer Ralph Smart, writer Ian Stuart Black, writer Brian Clemens, writer Michael Pertwee\n\nnot found: The Unforeseen (1958-1960) (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nClutch Cargo (1959-1960) | Plex, Tubi (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nThe pulp style adventures of pilot Clutch Cargo (Richard Cotting), with his kid sidekick Spinner & a dog, Paddlefoot (both voiced by Margaret Kerry). Hal Smith, perhaps best known as Otis on The Andy Griffith Show, narrates and provides additional voices (including Clutch ally “Swampy”). They might encounter anything from dinosaurs to ghosts. The series was the first to use the “Synchro-Vox” technique, where real mouths are seen speaking the dialog on the faces of the animated characters. Also paired with The New 3 Stooges segments under an umbrella of Clutch Cargo & Friends\n\nCast includes: Richard Cotting, Hal Smith, Margaret Kerry\n\nCrew includes: producer Dick Brown, writer/creator Clark Haas, music by Paul Horn\n\nOne Step Beyond (1959-1961) | Dark Matter, Plex, Roku, Tubi, Xumo (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nJohn Newland introduced (and directed) the episodes of this anthology series with paranormal events supposedly based on real happenings\n\nCast includes: John Newland, Robert Doublas, Olan Soule, Albert Salmi, Alfred Ryder, Joanne Linville, Charles Aidman, Harry Townes, Richard Devon, William Schallert, Anzie Strickland, David Lewis\n\nThe Twilight Zone (1959-1964) | Freevee, Paramount+, Pluto (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\n“Picture if you will…” Rod Serling’s classic anthology series, not afraid to blend science fiction iconography with social commentary, became part of pop culture. Serling had already been a TV writer, and wrote or co-wrote the majority of the episodes, in addition to doing on-camera intros and outros for episodes. While only winning two Emmys during its run (one for writing & one for drama program), it often appears on lists of greatest shows and episodes\n\n1960s\n\nThe Strange World of Gurney Slade | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nAnthony Newley conceived of this series and stars in it as apparently a TV character who somehow escapes his show and then encounters other strange environments. It’s surrealistic & reflective, with us hearing Gurney’s thoughts in voiceover\n\nCast includes: Anthony Newley; Edwin Richfield; Bernie Winters; Una Stubbs; Geoffrey Palmer; Fenella Fielding; Tracy Reed; Christopher Banks; Marjie Lawrence\n\nCrew includes: writers Sidney Green, Richard Hills; director/producer Alan Tarrant\n\nThe New Adventures of Pinocchio (1960-1961) | YouTube (last checked 7 January 2024)\n\nEarly Rankin/Bass stop motion, with 5 minute segments\n\nlisting in progress\n\nTarget Luna/Pathfinders in Space… (1960-1961) | YouTube (last checked 14 January 2024)\n\nWhile this is presented as four separate serials, they really follow directly on each other and can be considered as what are called seasons in the USA (& series in England), segments of one show. It’s a kids’ show, which, at least in the beginning, is presented largely as hard science fiction. Adults, kids, & a pet (originally I understand that “Hamlet” was a hamster, but in the 3 stories I’ve seen, he’s a guinea pig) rocket into space, initially to the moon (Target Luna), then landing on it (Pathfinders in Space), then to Mars (Pathfinders to Mars), & finally, to Venus (Pathfinders to Venus). To me, it becomes increasingly fantasy…by the time of Venus, there are dinosaurs & a similar idea to Caspak in the Edgar Rice Burroughs series. One episode ends with a statement that the “mistakes” we see are not accidental, but are part of an experiment into kids’ perceptions!\n\nCourageous Cat and Minute Mouse (1960-1962) | Filmrise, Freevee, Pluto, Roku, Tubi (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nAnimated superhero parody co-created by Bob Kane (who, with Bill Finger, is credited with creating Batman) and Gerald J. Rappaport, it features anthropomorphic animals. Courageous Cat and his sidekick, Minute Mouse, are literally a cat and a mouse. In some ways, the series is seen as setting the stage for the 1966 Adam West Batman series. They have a “Cat Mobile”, and super specific weapons get them out of just about any circumstance (rather than coming out of a utility belt, though, it’s typically some kind of gun). There is a Cat Signal, a Cat Cave, and an Irish police officer. The villains are colorful with outsize schemes. The main villain is “The Frog”, whose voice is evocative of Edward G. Robinson. The cartoons are short, about 5 minutes, so there isn’t time for much except solving the current problem\n\nCast: Dal McKennon, Johnny Holiday\n\nCrew: produced by Loren M. Singer and Sam Singer; directors Sam Marcus, Reuben Timmins, Marvin Woodward\n\nFandom, merch, pop culture references: the New York Dolls have performerd the theme, and it has been sampled by Jay-Z & LL Cool J; there was a story LP at the time; sliding square puzzle\n\nThe Flintstones (1960-1966) | Max, (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\n“Yabba dabba doo!” A primetime animated sitcom, Fred is a noisy blue collar worker, Barney (married to Betty) is his buddy, and Wilma is his wife. The situation in this case is that they are a “modern stoneage family”: they live in the stone age, but they have the prehistoric equivalent of modern conveniences & suburban complications\n\nA for Andromeda (1960) | YouTube (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nCo-written by science fiction writer/astronomer Fred Hoyle (and John Elliott), A for Andromeda is what we would now consider a miniseries, with one story told through seven episodes (most of which are now lost). The plot has to do with a signal received from the Andromeda Nebula with instructions which are followed by scientists on Earth. The series featured Julie Christie in her breakout role\n\nAfter the series: 1962 sequel series, The Andromeda Breakthrough; 1971 Italian remake, a come Andromeda; 2006 remake, also A for Andromeda\n\nFandom, merch, pop culture references: Radio Times cover at debut; 1962 novelization\n\nDiver Dan (1961-1962?) | YouTube (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nSyndicated 7 minute live-action segments with a deep sea diver & puppet fish. It was packaged in a variety of ways, including combining a few episodes into a half hour show, or including them in episodes with other characters\n\nFandom, merch, pop culture references: vinyl LP, Diver Dan and the Bermuda Onion, with original material (1 of Bufo’s favorite records)\n\nListing in progress\n\nSupercar (1961-1962) | Freevee, Plex, Roku, Tubi (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nGerry & Sylvia Anderson Supermarionation show\n\nlisting in progress\n\nTop Cat (1961-1962) | Boomerang (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nHanna-Barbera cartoon series initially based on The Phil Silvers Show, Top Cat is the scheming lead of a gang opposing authority. In this case, they are anthropomorphic street-wise cats, trying to get the best of beat cop Officer Dibble. While the show was not successful in its original primetime slot, it became a popular rerun on Saturdays and an international hit.\n\nCast: Arnold Stang (originally doing an impression of Phil Silvers), Maurice Gosfield (who played a similar role on The Phil Silvers Show), Marvin Kaplan, Allen Jenkins, Leo DeLyon, John Stephenson\n\nThe Yogi Bear Show (1961-1962) | Boomerang, Max, Tubi (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nYogi had debuted on The Huckleberry Hound Show, but starred in this one, along with his little friend Boo Boo, Ranger Smith, and Cindy Bear.

It’s a typical mid-century sitcom: father George works in an office for a tough boss, mother Jane is a homemaker, teenage daughter Judy is into rock and roll, young son Elroy gets into some mishaps, there’s a family dog, and the maid is loving and wise. However, these are all seen through the lens of “progress”: the maid is a robot, George takes a flying car to work…these have even become aspiriational shorthand for a technological utopian future. The show isn’t afraid to put in a bit of social commentary: George gets worn out pushing buttons (despite only working a few hours a week); he deals with automation replacing humans when he gets a robot manager, Uniblab\n\nNot found: Space Patrol (aka Planet Patrol) (1963-1964) | (formerly on Prime) (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nAuthor Roberta Leigh, who had earlier worked with Gerry Anderson on adapations of her work, created this internationally popular marionette space opera. Earthers are allied with humans from Venus & Mars. The Venusians are a bit elfin. Col. Raeburn calls on heroic Captain Dart & his team, Husky (Martian) & Slim (Venusian) to deal with actual menaces & investigate weird happenings. 1 interesting thing is that they usually go into “The Freezer” (suspended animation) during space trips, sometimes for months (that never seems to slow the plot). Raeburn’s secretary is the super capable Venusian Marla, with a Radar O’Reilly like ability to anticipate his needs. They run into some very odd things, like a lake whose “water” makes inanimate objects move on their own\n\nAstro Boy (1963-1966) | Funimation (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nPioneering anime set decades in the future (at the time), in which a scientist’s son is accidentally killed and he tries to replace him with a super advanced robot. However, he becomes frustrated with the way “Astro” doesn’t grow like a child would, and sells him to a mean circus owner (this parallels to some extent Pinocchio). Robots are mistreated in the circus, but after Astro saves the owner from a fire, and a “Law of Robotic Rights” is passed, Astro lives with a professor who believes robots should be treated as equals. Among his other powers, Astro can fly through the use of rockets in his feet\n\nGigantor (1963-1966) | Crunchyroll, Freevee, Roku (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nAmericanized dub of a Japanese anime. A 12-year old kid (Jimmy Sparks in the American version) controls a giant robot called Gigantor. The robot is certainly powerful (useful against supervillains), but Jimmy is not your typical 12-year old: he drives a car and carries a gun! He is headquartered with his uncle, Dr Brilliant. Enemies run the gamut of science fiction foes\n\nThe Mighty Hercules (1963-1966) | YouTube (last checked 8 January 2024)\n\nBased loosely on Greek mythology, the short animated stories feature Hercules & his allies against evil forces. In this version, he gets his strength from a magic ring (as opposed to just being a demigod). When he activates it, it’s hit by lightning. His allies include: Newton, a young centaur who repeats every he says (a song of his on a vinyl LP of the show said, “I’m glad, I’m glad, to have, to have, a friend, a friend, like Hercules, like Hercules”); Tewt, who only communicates by using a pan flute (he is a satyr); Pegasus, his flying winged horse, & human allies. In this one, Hercules also gets along with his father, Zeus. The main villain is Daedalus, a wizard. Another recurring one is Wilhemine, the sea witch. It has been noted for it’s generally limited animation & catchy theme song, sung by Johnny Nash\n\nCast includes: Jimmy Tapp; Helene Nickerson; Jack Mercer (best known for Popeye); David Hartman voiced Hercules in 8 episodes\n\nCrew includes: director/creator Joseph Oriolo; writers George Kashdan, Jack E.

While known in part for their imaginative “bears” (aliens & monsters), it is also recognized for its writing (including by Harlan Ellison) & acting (Robert Culp starred in three episodes). There is no host, but Vic Perrin’s open & closing pieces as the unseen “Control Voice” were parodied. Not recognized by the major award shows at the time (it was nominated for one Emmy for Art Direction and Scenic Design), and not having strong ratings in the 2nd season, it nonetheless has strong fandom and has been revived\n\nDoctor Who (1963-1989) | BritBox, Tubi (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\nInitially played by William Hartnell, “The Doctor” (while the name of the show is Doctor Who, the character isn’t called that in-universe) is a time-travelling alien who likes Earth humans, and typically has “companions” onboard the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions in Space). One key element is that The Doctor “regenerates” periodically and is then played by a different actor. Each incarnation has a distinct character and way of dressing, but is still the same person. The show has been very successful, and after a TV movie in 1996, was revived in 2005 and at time of writing, is still running. That “New Who” (also stylized as “NuWho” seems to be licensed differently, so will be listed separately.

Elizabeth Montgomery stars as Samantha (& sometimes as her cousin Serena). Agnes Moorehead is her mother Endora. Dick York & Dick Sargent both played Darrin. David White was Darrin’s boss Larry Tate.

Dad Herman (sitcom vet Fred Gwynne) is a working “stiff” (so to speak), movie star Yvonne De Carlo is Mom Lily.

Jonny has a 24-hour a day bodyguard, “Race” Bannon (who was once voted top cartoon “Mom”), since if something happened to him, it would compromise Dr. Quest’s value. Dr. Quest also adopted Hadji, another 11-year old. Rounding out the Quest team is Bandit, Jonny’s pet bulldog. Their adventures often involve high tech (they use hovercrafts & jetpacks) and can pit them against the apparently paranormal and super-scientific adversaries\n\nCast: Tim Matheson (Jonny); Mike Road (Race); Don Messick (Dr. Quest, Bandit), Danny Bravo (Hadji); Vic Perrin (Dr. Zin & others); Herny Corden; Doug Young; John Stephenson (also voiced Dr. Quest among others); Everett Sloane; Nestor Paiva; Keye Luke; Jesse White; Daws Butler; J.

Originally, he got his powers from a Super Energy Pill he kept in his ring, but that was eliminated later. His love interest was reporter Sweet Polly Purebred who was often in peril.

Despite his father (who was also a white lion) having been killed by a human hunter, he believes that not only different types of NHAs (Non-Human Animals) should get along, but that there should be a rapport with humans and a respect for human culture. His growing up to be king & his leadership of a menagerie of species (some of whom are skeptical of his ideas) are key to the series. Among the other major NHA characters: Polly, a parrot who has lived in human society; Bucky, a Thomson’s gazelle; Dan’l Baboon, a wise mandrill who mentors Kimba; Tom and Dick, antagonist hyenas; and Kelly Phunt, an elephant\n\nCast: Yvonne Murray; Billie Lou Watt; Ray Owens\n\nCrew: Producer Ozama Tezuka\n\nBefore the series: manga\n\nConcurrent: Movie directed by Eiichi Yamamoto (1966)\n\nAfter the series; The New Adventures of Kimba the White Lion animated series (1989)\n\nThe Smothers Brothers Show AKA M Brother the Angel (1965-1966) | YouTube (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\n“There’s miracles to start, but they always come apart…” Mermaid out of Water situation comedy with Tom Smothers as an angel (he was lost at sea two years before the show starts) who interacts with Dick Smothers…those are also their character names.

While they do rescue people from more routine situations, tey also come up against villains, especially The Hood. In those situations, Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (& her butler, Aloysius Parker), may assist. Fandom is extensive and there has been a lot of merchandising. Followed by a remake series and a live-action film among other things\n\nThe Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show (1965-1967) | Boomerang (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\n“Up and at ’em, Atom Ant!” Atom Ant (backed by Precious Pupp and The Hillbilly Bears) and The Secret Squirrel Show (backed by Squiddly Diddly and Winsome Witch) ran both as independent shows and combined. Atom Ant was an atomic powered superhero who could fly (without wings), was superstrong, superfast, and invulnerable. Like Batman, the police would call on him especially to fight supervillains like Professor Von Gimmick. Originally voiced by Howard Morris, and then Don Messick. Ted Cassidy did the opening narration. Secret Squirrel (voiced by Mel Blanc) is a secret agent, assisted by Morocco Mole (voiced by Paul Frees doing Peter Lorre)\n\nLost in Space (1965-1968) | Hulu (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\n“Danger, Will Robinson!” Irwin Allen’s series features a pioneer family headed for another planet whose mission is sabotaged by a foreign agent. The agent is inadvertently stuck on the spaceship (the “flying saucer” shaped Jupiter 2) when it launches, which throws it off the calculated path. While that may sound grim, the show eventually incorpoated a great deal of humor and absurd situations (famously, an anthropomorphic evil carrot). The saboteur, Dr Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), became more of a buffoon, and his interactions with boy genius Will (Billy Mumy) & the ship’s robot (voice of Dick Tufeld), became the focus. Others include Will’s older sisters, bookish Penny (Angela Cartwright) and adult Judy (Marta Kristen), their parents, Professor John Robinson (Guy Williams) & Dr. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) as well as their pilot, Major Don West (Mark Goddard). Followed by a theatrical movie and a reboot series\n\nNot found: Roger Ramjet (1965-1969) | (formerly on Peacock) (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\n“Roger Ramjet, he’s our man, hero of our nation. For his adventures just be sure to stay tuned to this station” Adult hero pilot Roger Ramjet (voiced by Gary Owens) is assisted by a group of kids (The American Eagles), who also fly planes and often save Roger (who is undeniably a bit clueless) in this patriotic animated parody. Roger can take a “Proton Energy Pill” and gain the power of 20 atom bombs for 20 seconds…although that mostly means punching the bad guys. There were many recurring colorful villains (including a vampire & robots). Similar to a Jay Ward show, there was a lot of humor for adults\n\narchived official site\n\nThe Wild Wild West (1965-1969) | Pluto, Prime (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\nJames West (Robert Conrad) & Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) were Secret Service agents in the Old West, at the time of President Ulysses S. Grant. That may not sound geek-friendly, but the show definitely had science fiction and even fantasy elements. Part of that came courtesy of the series’ iconic villain, Dr Miguelito Loveless, played by Michael Dunn. The genius “mad scientist” eventually gets into some high strangeness, not just shrinking people in one episode, but enabling them to “enter into” two dimensional paintings\n\nCast includes: Robert Conrad; Ross Martin; Michael Dunn; Douglas Henderson (as Loveless’ hench, Antoinette: she and Dunn had a cabaret act outside the show); Richard Kiel (as Voltaire, another Loveless hench); Roy Engel (as President Grant); guests include: William Schallert; Arthur Batanides; Victor Buono; Nehemiah Persoff; Anthony Caruso; Theodore Marcuse; Arthur Malet; Robert Loggia; Alfred Ryder; John Dehner; Jeff Corey; Ruta Lee; Kathie Browne; Nick Adams; John Doucette; Thayer David; Harold Gould; John Hoyt; Richard Jaeckel; Sherry Jackson; Dabbs Greer\n\nCrew includes: producer Bruce Lansbury; producer Leonard Katzman; producer Fred Freiberger; producer Gene L.

Like the slightly earlier Bewitched, Jeannie tried not to use her magic, but often ended up doing so. Bill Daily was Tony’s friend & fellow astronaut who knew the secret, & Hayden Rorke was Dr. Bellows, who didn’t\n\nAfter the series: animated reimagined series in 1973, Jeannie\n\nNot found: The Interpretaris (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\n6-part series set in space.

The series deals with Adam Adamant (Gerald Harper) adjusting to the swinging sixties as a MooW (Mermaid out of Water). He is partnered primarily with mod Georgina Jones (Juliet Harmer), who knows of him as an historical figure. The foe who froze him, The Face, is revealed to also have been frozen and is revived, causing more problems. There are parallels between this and the Austin Powers film series, which takes a 1960s crimefighter and thaws him out in the 1990s…showing how what was the future world for Adam has also become outdated in thirty years (his main enemy, Dr. Evil, is also frozen and revived)\n\nCast includes: Gerald Harper, Juliet Harmer, Jack May, Peter Ducrow\n\nCrew includes: director Ridley Scott (3 episodes); director/writer Brian Clemens (2 episodes)\n\nAfter the series: Big Finish audio series, starting in 2020\n\nBatfink (1966-1967) | YouTube (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\n“Your bullets can not harm me. My wings are like a shield of steel.” Hal Seeger created this cartoon series which parodies Batman (Batfink is literally a superhero bat) and The Green Hornet (he has a martial arts expert sidekick, called Karate)\n\nlisting in progress\n\nIt’s About Time (1966-1967) | YouTube (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\nSherwood Schwartz created this broad sci-fi comedy which started out as sort of a reverse Mermaid out of Water show: two astronauts (played by Frank Aletter & Jack Mullaney) accidentally time travel to “caveman” days and get stuck there. Among the cave dwellers are couple Shag & Gronk (played by comedy veterans Imogene Coca & Joe E. Ross). The decision was made to switch it up, and the astronauts made it back to the 20th Century, bringing the cave family with them. The show then becomes a more typical MooW show, including the cave people making a pop song sort of unintentionally without the audience realizing the truth about them\n\nThe Time Tunnel (1966-1967) | YouTube (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\n“Tony Newman and Doug Phillops now tumble helplessly toward a new fantastic adventure, somewhere along the infinitie corridors of time.” Irwin Allen series about two scientists who are lost time travelers: Doug (Robert Colbert) ad Tony (James Darren) are lead developers of a top secret government project: a time machine. Project Tic-Toc works out of an underground base in the desert. When their funding is threatened if they don’t send someone through the machine (which is a large tunnel). The science team thinks the tunnel isn’t ready for that, but unauthorized, Tony enters it. Doug goes after him to try to retrieve them. Unfortunately, the “mission control” team (Whit Bissell as Lt. General Heywood, John Zaremba as technologist Dr. Swain, and Lee Meriwether as the medical expert, , Dr. MacGregor), don’t know how to get them back to the current time. Doug and Tony tend to end up in crisis points, like aboard the Titanic before it sinks. They eventually encounter stranger things, including aliens and ghosts\n\nCast includes: James Darren, Robert Colbert, Whit Bissell, John Zaremba, Lee Meriwether, Sam Groom, Wesley Lau; guests include: Malachi Throne, Michael Ansara, Vitina Marcus, Michael Pate, Lawrence Montaigne, Paul Carr, Rhodes Reason, Perry Lopez, Joe E.

Abbott)\n\nAfter the series: 2002 TV pilot\n\nUltra Q (1966-1967) | Pluto, ShoutTV, Tubi (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\n“For the next 30 minutes, you’ll experience a parting of mind from body and become swallowed into this mysterious time.” The sensibilities of the Toho giant monster movies (Gamera, not from Toho was also a popular kaiju) were brought to this half hour TV series. It’s clear the intent was to make it more like an anthology series: there is a serious intro voiceover, and talk about a world out of balance. There are regular characters who, somewhat like Carl Kolchak, encounter different creatures. One of them, Yuri, is a reporter (although they mostly focus on her photography). She also has an editor who yells a lot. She’s friends with Jun, a strong silent type who is a pilot (and amateur sci-fi writer) and has a small air service (there’s a helicopter and a Cessna single-engine plane). Ippei is the other pilot: he’s enthusiastic & silly & has a bit of a crush on Yuri. In many episodes, Yuri hears about the monster & gets Jun to fly her there to get the scoop. However, there are more serious episodes, & one, The 1/8 Project is more traditional science fiction. Kids also feature in several episodes, and there can be strong fantasy elements as well\n\nNot found: Batman (1966-1968) | (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\n“NuhnuhnuhnuhnuhnuhNUHnuh NuhnuhnuhnuhnuhnuhNUHnuh Batman!” William Dozier developed this as a camp take on the comic book hero. Initially split over two nights (with the episodes ending in a cliffhanger, like an old serial), the show had a huge cultural impact, with “Batmania” sweeping the nation & references to it in pop culture (Allan Sherman wrote a line in a song to emphasis how big a phenomenon it was with “They even took Batman off the TV screen!”). Adam West played Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Burt Ward was Dick Grayson/Robin, his young ward. The “batvillains” were a lot of the pull: Frank Gorshin was nominated for an Emmy for the first episodes. Many older stars wanted to take part. It continues to have strong fandom more than half a century later\n\nAdam West, Burt Ward (@Twitter), Alan Napier, Neil Hamilton, Stafford Repp, William Dozier, Madge Blake, Yvonne Craig, Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, Julie Newmar.

William Shatner as Captain Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as half-Vulcan Science Officer Mr. Spock, and DeForest Kelley as Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy form a friendship triangle. Other stars include Nichelle Nichols as Lt. Uhura, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, George Takei as Mr. Sulu, Walter Koenig as Chekov, and Majel Barrett as Nurse Chapel. The show was later revived in an animated series, movies, and many sequel series\n\nDark Shadows (1966-1971) | Crackle, Freevee, Peacock, Pluto, Prime, Roku, Tubi, Xumo (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\nDan Curtis’ struggling soap opera was threatened with cancellation so he took a chance and introduced a vampire. Barnabas Collins, played by Jonathan Frid made the show a fad, especially among school students (its main timeslot was 4:00 PM). The show was melodramatic with several story arcs over the years. In addition to Barnabas, the show included ghosts, a main character werewolf, time travel, and more. There were tie-in novels, theatrical movies, and follow-on series, Joan Bennett got the series’ only Emmy nomination\n\nNot found: Captain Nice (1967) (last checked 19 January 2024)\n\nNot found: Danny the Dragon (1967) (last checked 10 January 2024)\n\nJack Wild, Sally Thomsett, and Christopher Cooper are three children who find an alien…who looks like a fire-breathing dragon (Jack Le White).

He is gassed into unconsciousness and wakes up as a prisoner in what appears to be a pleasant resort (referred to as The Village), but where everyone has numbers instead of names & are either trapped or part of the establishment. He is now known as Number Six and is fiercely independent, despite efforts to get him to conform (and to reveal some unspecified information). The mystery of what The Village is, and who is Number One fascinated viewers.

McGavin does a noir-style narration (Kolchak’s notes into his portable cassette recorder), and almost always runs afoul of law enforcement and other authorities.

It stars Deirdre Hall (as Electra Woman) and Judy Strangis as her sidekick, Dyna Girl. Norma Alden plays scientist (techie helper) Frank Helfin.

Shull played Detective Holmes (no relation to Sherlock), who is a bit of a wild card which is a bad thing for his partners. His new partner, at first unbeknownst to him, is an android (who should therefore be safe with him), nicknamed Yoyo (played by John Schuck). It’s a broad slapstick Mermaid Out of Water comedy. Leonard Stern is an Executive Producer: he had worked on Get Smart, which had the somewhat similar android, Hymie\n\nCast: John Schuck, Richard B.

He builds a crime computer hidden in a sarcophagus in the museum. Somehow, it brings wax statues of three classic monsters to life: Dracula (Henry Pollic II), Frank N. Stein (the Frankenstein “monster”, played by Michael Lane), & a werewolf (named Bruce W. Wolf, played by Buck Kartalian). Although they come from wax statues, they have their full normal capabilities & memories: Dracula’s most common team attribute is reconnaisance in his bat form; Frank uses strength, often to break through walls; and Bruce has an incredible sense of smell. In order to make up for the evil they’ve done in the past (Drac now gets blood from a blood bank, although they revert to their wax forms during the day), they battle evil. That’s a series of absurd supervillains, including celebrity, often geek-friendly guest stars (Julie Newmar as Ultra Witch, Jonathan Harris as The Astrologer…). The series inclues humor aimed at adults & in-jokes (for example, a government base is named after series developer Stanley Ralph Ross\n\nCast includes: Fred Grandy; Henry Pollic II; Michael Lane; Buck Kartalian; Edward Andrews as Mayor Goldwyn; Paul Smith & Richard X.

She was a professional tennis player who was severely injured in a skydiving accident. She is given bionic legs, a bionic arm, and a bionic ear. While she does go on missions for Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson, crossing over from The Six Million Dollar Man), her “day job” is as a schoolteacher\n\nlisting in progress\n\nNot found: The Fantastic Journey (1977) | (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nA diverse group of travelers, from different times, are lost in the Bermuda Triangle and trying to find their way back to their own times. They travel from “zone” to zone, encountering different, often dystopian, societies. It’s a quest show, as they are trying to find “Evoland”, which will be the key to returning. Eventually, the show settles on a group of 5: Scott Jordan (Ike Eisenmann), a young teen son “of a famous scientist” who is from 1977, so contemporary with the audience; Dr. Fred Walters (Carl Franklin), who has recently graduated from med school…he is also from 1977 and was with Scott on the expedition that was lost; Varian (Jared Martin), who is from the 23rd Century: he’s the “specially immune” character, often unaffected by things that affect the others. He also has a device somewhat like Doctor Who’ sonic screwdriver (the “sonic energizer”) that focuses his thoughts to perform a variety of tasks, including healing; Liana (Katie Saylor), who is half Atlantean & half extraterrestrial, & can communicate with animals (especially a cat, Sil-El, she carries with her who often spies for them); and Jonathan Willoway (Roddy McDowall), an ultrarich tech inventor who often looks after his own interests…he starts as a villain, but becomes a respected (if sometimes suspect) member of the group\n\nCast: Jared Martin, Carl Franklin, Ike Eisenmann (@Twitter), Katie Saylor, Roddy McDowall\n\nCome Back Mrs. Noah (1977-1978) | YouTube (last checked 5 February 2024)\n\nSet in 2050, in this silly sitcom, Mollie Sugden plays Gertrude Noah who, as a result of winning a cooking contest held by the magazine Modern Housewife, is given a tour of the UK’s (now the predominant superpower in the world) new spaceship (the “Giant Space Wheel”, Britannia Seven). The ship is accidentally launched with Mrs. Noah on board, and not with the planned 500 person crew: there are two physicists (played by Donald Hewlett & Michael Knowles), and a low-level technician (he identifies himself as a lightbulb changer) (Joe Black), and a BBC reporter (Ian Lavender)\n\nSubjects: Accidental Astronauts\n\nListing in progress\n\nNot found: Logan’s Run (1977-1978) | (Formerly on Tubi) (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nWhile there is a bit of footage used from the movie, this is really a fresh adaptation (you don’t need to have seen the movie to understand the series). The start is the same: there is a “City of Domes” where, when people turn 30, they go to “Carousel”: the belief is that they’ll be renewed, but they are being killed. Jessica 6 (Heather Menzies) is a “Runner”, someone who wants to escape that fate. Gregory Harrison plays Logan 5, a “Sandman” who hunts down & kills Runners, but has a change of heart & ends up running with Jessica instead. The secret organization that runs the City of Domes sends another Sandman, Francis 7 (Randy Powell) after them. The series then becomes a quest show, with Jessica & Logan looking for the rumored Sanctuary, where they can be free, & Francis in pursuit. Also with Logan & Jessica is Rem (Donald Moffatt), an android who can act superior but does protect his human friends. D.C. Fontana was the story editor, and some episodes have a Star Trek feel\n\nNot found: Man from Atlantis (1977-1978) | (Formerly on Tubi) (last checked 17 January 2024)\n\nPatrick Duffy stars as a man adapted to living under the water, with webbed hands & feet, and the ability to breathe underwater. He has no memory of his origin (at least during the original TV movies & series: a later novel by Duffy made his connection to Atlantis more explicit). He partners with the Foundation for Oceanic Research, & especially Dr. Elizabeth Merrill (Belinda J. Montgomery) and C.W. Crawford Jr. (Alan Fudge). He is driven in part by ecological concerns, but also faces villains, in particular, Victor Buono’s Mr. Schubert\n\nNot found: Quark (1977-1978) | (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nBuck Henry created sci-fi parody starring Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark, the heroic commander of…a space-faring garbage scow. His second-in-command is Betty and her identical clone, played by the Barnstable twins (Cyb and Patricia Barnstable). The ship’s engineer is Gene/Jean, a “transmute”, who flips between stereotypically male and female personalities. It was nominated for one Emmy for costume design\n\nNot found: Tabitha (1977-1978) (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nIn this spin-off from Bewitched, Tabitha (now played by Lisa Hartman) is a young college graduate working at a TV station. Her brother Adam (now older than her, although he was younger on Bewitched) got her the job. She has magical powers & uses them freely and enthusiastically; he doesn’t, and doesn’t approve of her using them. This could, hypothetically, explain the switch in who is “older”: witches on Bewitched could live much longer lives than mortals. Other regulars are: Robert Urich as the superegotistical, womanizing, host of an interview show (Tabitha is a production assistant for him); Mel Stuart as the boss; and Karen Morrow as Aunt Minerva, a meddling, hip witch relative. Some actors reprised their roles from Bewitched in guest appearances, including Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay, and Sandra Gould & George Tobias as Gladys & Abner Kravitz\n\nCast includes: Lisa Hartman, David Ankrum, Robert Ulrich, Mel Stewart, Karen Morrow. Guests include: Mary Wickes (2 episodes, as Cassandra, a coven leader), Dick Wilson (2), Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay (2), Archie Hahn, Barry Van Dyke, Dack Rambo, Richard Libertini, Billie Hayes, Werner Klemperer, John Fiedler, Fritz Feld, Mary Grace Canfield, Sandra Gould (as Gladys Kravitz), George Tobias (as Abner Kravitz), Kenneth Mars, Cliff Norton, Fred Willard…\n\nCrew: directors include (William Asher, creator of Bewitched, 2 episodes), Bruce Bilson; producers include George Yanok, Jerry Mayer\n\nNot found: The Amazing Spider-Man (1977-1979) (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nNicholas Hammond live action\n\nNot found: The Incredible Hulk (1977-1982) (Formerly on NBC) (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\n“Don’t make me angry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.” Bill Bixby stars as David Banner (who was Bruce Banner in the Marvel comics), a scientist who doses himself with Gamma radiation, which unexpectedly causes him to turn into The Incredible Hulk, a green-skinned, rage driven behemoth. The Hulk is wrongly thought to have started a fire which killed Banner. Banner goes on the run, traveling from place to place, and helping people in each one while under a diferent assumed identity. His skills as a medical doctor often come into play. He’s also pursued by a tabloid reporter. Viewers looked forward to “Hulk outs”, when the Hulk was played by bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno (with vocal effects by Ted Cassidy of The Addams Family)\n\nListing in progress\n\nNot found: Battlestar Galactica (1978-79) | (Formerly on Tubi) (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nFollowing the success of 1977’s theatrical release, Star Wars, this series faced some back-and-forth legal challenges (the defense included that Star Wars had been based on earlier material). In this, extraterrestrial humans have basically lost a war against robots called Cylons. Lorne Greene plays the commander of the last battle(star)ship. He leads survivors through space in search of a lost group of humans, who had colonized Earth. They are still fighting the Cylons, and a human traitor, Baltar (John Colicos). Galactica’s fighter pilots include Apollo (Richard Hatch), Starbuck (Dirk Benedict), and Boomer (Herbert Jefferson Jr.). While initially a ratings success, the show was cancelled after one season, but then revived as Galactica 1980 for 10 more episodes. In 2003, the series was reimagined\n\nSpace Pirate Captain Harlock (1978-1979) | Crunchyroll, Pluto, Tubi (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nThis was the first adaptation of the manga and there have been others since. In the future, space travel from Earth is a reality, but there are aliens who oppose the Terrans. The majority of Earth’s population doesn’t engage with that much, but Captain Harlock and his crew do. It’s much more complicated than it might seem as first\n\nlisting in progress\n\nGodzilla (1978-1979) | YouTube (last checked 15 January 2024)\n\nChildren’s animated series perhaps most noted by fans for the presence of Godzooky, a nephew of Godzilla’s with small wings. A group of scientists are friends with Godzilla & can call on the Big G for help with a special signalling device if, for example, they are attacked by another kaiju (giant monster). They are based on a research ship called the Calico (note that the real-life researcher Jacques Cousteau’s ship was the Calypso). Ted Cassidy provided vocal effects for Godzilla\n\nCast includes: Ted Cassid"
