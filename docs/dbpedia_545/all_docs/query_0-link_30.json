It is by far the largest o f the police services that operate in greater London (the others include the City of London Police and the British Transport Police). The Royal Parks Constabulary have now become part of the Metropolitan Police Service. In 1829, when Sir Robert Peel was Home Secretary, the first Metropolitan Police Act was passed and the Metropolitan Police Force was established in London (for more information get to Appendix 1). The original establishment of 1,000 officers policed a seven-mile radius and a population of less than 2 million. Today, the Metropolitan Police Service employs 31,000 officers, 14,000 police staff, 414 traffic wardens and 4,000 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) as well as being supported by over 2,500 volunteer police officers. The Metropolitan Police Services covers an area of 609 square miles and a population of 7.4 million. The Commissioner, who heads the Metropolitan Police has traditionally answered directly to the Home Secretary. This dates back to the formation of the Metropolitan Police and reflects its difference from other police forces and its national and international responsibilities. The Metropolitan Police Service performs national functions, such as those in relation to the protection o f royalty and countering terrorism in Great Britain. In addition to these two, the MPS has a\n\n6\n\nnumber of other capital city, and national responsibilities such as the protection of certain members and ex-members o f the government and the diplomatic community and assisting with enquiries concerning British interests at home and abroad. These responsibilities make the Metropolitan Police Service unique among UK police forces. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is the territorial police force responsible fo r law enforcement within Greater London, excluding the City of London which is the responsibility of the City o f London Police. Task 3. Answer the following questions. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nWhich Act is the Metropolitan Police Service established by? What was the jurisdiction o f the original organization? What area does the Met cover today? Who heads the Metropolitan Police? What is the difference o f the Metropolitan Police from other police forces? 6.

It is organised into five main directorates: Territorial Policing, the Specialist Crime Directorate, Specialist Operations, Central Operations and administration and support. Each is overseen by an Assistant Commissioner, or in the case of administrative departments a director of police staff which is the equivalent civil staff grade. I. Territorial Policing: London's local police Following a recent restructuring, the Territorial Policing directorate is responsible for the day to day policing of geographical areas across Greater London, that comprise the Metropolitan Police District. It is divided into 32 Borough Operational Command Units (BOCUs). Each BOCU is commanded by a Chief Superintendent, apart from Westminster, which due to its high concentration o f Government facilities, is headed by a Commander. Each BOCU provides police officers who are responsible for patrolling, and responding to emergencies. Detectives of Criminal Investigation Department are also attached to a BOCU providing an investigative capability. Task 5. Answer the questions. 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nWhat does the structure of the Met reflect? What are the main directorates within the Met? Who heads each directorate? What is the Territorial Policing directorate responsible for? II. Specialist Crime Directorate\n\nIn addition to policing London’s streets, the Met has various specialist units dedicated to reducing all aspects o f serious and specialist crime. The intention o f Specialist Crime Directorate is to place a renewed emphasis on working collaboratively with communities, boroughs and partners to identify effective solutions to serious crime problems. The SCD is made up of 8 Operational Command Units (OCU), each specializing in a form of criminal investigations:\n\nHomicide and Serious Crime Command is responsible for the investigation of homicide, such as; murder, attempted murder, and infanticide, which are all investigated by Murder Investigation Teams. The Command also investigates missing persons and abduction cases, where there is substantive reason to suspect that life is in danger.

Along with providing good clearance certificates to members o f the public, who wish to travel to countries that require a good behavior certificate before they are authorized to enter. Forensic Services Command Unit is responsible for providing an on call, forensic science capability for the 32 Borough Operational Command Units, along with the rest of the Service. Within the Command several smaller units exist, such as; Forensic Investigation Specialist Crime Directorate, which deals with forensic science capabilities on crime scenes that are within the remit o f the SCD, such as homicide and armed robberies. Child Abuse Investigation Command is responsible for the investigation of crimes against minors, mainly, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Within the Command, Major Investigations Teams exist which investigate child homicide, a sexual crime unit, a Hi-Tech Crime Unit which deals with computer investigations, the Safeguarding Children and Development Unit which educates against offences, and deals with after-care o f victims. Economic and Specialist Crime Command is responsible for investigations of serious economic crime, made up o f many units within the command, such as; the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit, the Money Laundering Investigation Team, Financial Investigation Development Units, the Specialist Crime Operations Team, the Stolen Vehicle Unit, the Arts and Antiques Unit, the Wildlife Crime Unit, the Extradition and International Assistance Unit, and others. Trident & Trafalgar Operational Command Unit is responsible for the investigation o f gun related crimes within the black community o f London with focus on firearms related deaths, either where the suspect is black, or the victim. Also they conduct investigations where a firearms related incident within the black community led to no injury. Serious and Organized Crime Group is responsible for the investigations o f serious, organized and life threatening crimes. The group is made up o f the Central Task Force, the Projects Team, the Flying Squad, the Kidnap and Special Investigation Unit, the Hostage and Crisis Negotiations Unit and the Intelligence Support Unit.\n\n•\n\nCovert Policing/Intelligence is responsible for providing a undercover surveillance teams capability to the rest o f the force. Surveillance officers can be deployed anywhere within the Metropolitan Police District in 90 minutes, and are authorized to be deployed anywhere within the United Kingdom, with an armed capability available. The Unit is made up of the: Technical Support Unit, which maintains surveillance equipment; and The Authorities Office, which deals with gaining authorization to deploy and the Prison Intelligence Unit.\n\nTask 6.

The current New Scotland Yard building is located in Westminster. Administrative functions are based at the Empress State Building. The name o f the headquarters is derived from its original location on Great Scotland Yard, a street within Whitehall. The exact origins o f the name are unknown, but one explanation is that the site had once been used as a diplomatic mission owned by the Kings o f Scotland. The Metropolitan Police was formed by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel with the implementation o f the Metropolitan Police Act, passed by Parliament in 1829. Sir Robert Peel selected the original Scotland Yard for the new police headquarters. The Metropolitan Police's crime database is housed at New Scotland Yard. This database uses a national IT system developed for major crime enquiries by all UK forces, called Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, more commonly referred to by its acronym, HOLMES. In addition, the training program is called \"Elementary\" in honour o f the great fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. A number o f security measures were added to New Scotland Yard's exterior during the 2000s, including concrete barriers in front o f ground-level windows, as a countermeasure against car bombing. This was accompanied by a concrete wall around the entrance to the building, and the entrance itself having a covered walkway from the street to the building. Armed officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group were assigned to patrol the exterior o f the building along with Security Staff. In addition to duties common to all metropolitan police forces (including crime detection and prevention and traffic management), it is entrusted with civil defense in times of emergency, and it maintains a special branch for guarding visiting dignitaries, royalty, and political dignitaries. It keeps records on all known criminals in Britain, and other British police forces often seek its assistance. It also helps train the police o f Commonwealth nations.\n\n17\n\nTask 18. Answer the following questions. 1. What is New Scotland Yard responsible for? 2. Why doesn’t its jurisdiction cover the City district? 3. Where is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service located? 4. What is the origin of the name Scotland Yard? Do you know any other explanations? 5. What can you say about the establishment o f the Metropolitan Police? 6. Which IT system is used for major crime enquiries? 7. Why is the training system called “Elementary”? 8. What security measures are undertaken to protect the building? 9. What are the duties of Scotland Yard? Task 19 . Render the following article in English. Use the necessary word combinations from Task 17. Скотланд Ярд, Лондон Скотланд-Ярд— штаб-квартира полиции Большого Лондона (.Metropolitan Police Service), исключая лондонский Сити, который имеет свою полицию. Здание современного Скотланд-Ярда расположено в Вестминстере. Административные функции возложены на персонал, который базируется в Empress State Building. Крупнейшее полицейское учреждение в Англии. В нем работают 27 ООО человек, которые отвечают за территорию, равную 787 квадратным километрам, и население в 6 750 ООО человек, проживающих в Лондоне и окрестностях. Название Скотланд-Ярд происходит от его первоначального местоположения на улице Большой Скотланд-Ярд в районе Уайтхолла. Интересны и версии происхождения названия улицы. По одной из них в X веке король Шотландии Кеннет построил там резиденцию и посещал её ежегодно, отдавая тем самым дань уважения королевству Англии от лица Шотландии. Дворец оставался владением шотландских королей и считался территорией Шотландии. Со временем дворец потерял своё первоначальное предназначение. Его разделили на две части: первую назвали «Большой Скотланд-Ярд», вторую — «Средний Скотланд-Ярд». Их стали использовать как правительственные здания. Полиция Большого Лондона была сформирована министром внутренних дел сэром Робертом Пилем, во исполнение инициированного им же Закона о лондонской полиции, принятого Парламентом в 1829 году. Сэр Роберт Пиль выбрал первоначальным местом расположения Главного управления современный Скотланд Ярд.\n\n18\n\nБаза данных полицейского управления размещается в Новом Скотланд-Ярде. Здесь используется национальная IT система, разработанная для запросов всех силовых структур и называемая Главная поисковая система Министерства внутренних дел.

The City o f London Police is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement within the City o f London, England, including the Middle and Inner Temple. The service responsible for law enforcement within the rest of Greater London is the Metropolitan Police Service, a separate organisation. With around 1,200 employees, including 813 police officers, 85 Special Constables, 48 PCSOs and three police stations (located in Snow Hill, Wood Street and Bishopsgate), the City o f London Police is the smallest territorial police force in England and Wales, both in terms o f geographic area - the square mile centre o f London - and the number o f police officers. The City of London area has a resident population of 8,043 with 4,421 households. These numbers are increased by the daily influx o f approximately 300,000 commuters working in the City, with an additional 300,000 cars passing through the square mile a day, along with a number o f tourists.

The British Police T he B ritish p o lice o fficer - som etim es called the “b o b b y ” after Sir R obert Peel, the founder o f the p o lice fo rce - is a w ell-know n figure to anyone w ho has visited B ritain or w ho has seen the B ritish film s. P o licem en - and w om en - are to be seen in tow ns and cities keeping law and order, either w alk in g in the streets (“pounding the b eat”) o r driving in cars (know n as “pan d a cars” because o f th eir distinctive m arkings). Few people realize, how ever, that the police in B ritain are organized v ery differently from m any other countries. M ost countries, for ex am ple, have a national police force, w hich is controlled by central G overnm ent. B ritain has no national police force, although the central G overnm ent’s H om e\n\n20 O ffice governs police p olicy. Instead, there is a separate p o lice force fo r each o f 52 areas into w hich the country is divided. E ach has a police authority - a com m ittee o f local county councilors and m agistrates. T he forces co -o p erate w ith each other, but it is unusual for m em bers o f one force to operate in an o th er’s area u nless they are asked to give assistance. T his som etim es h appens w hen there has been a very serio u s crim e. A C h ie f C onstable (the m o st senior po lice officer o f a force) m ay som etim es ask for th e assistance o f L o n d o n ’s police force, based at N ew S cotland Y ard know n sim ply as “the Y ard ” . In m ost countries, th e police carry guns. T he B ritish po lice generally do not c a n y firearm s, except in N orthern Ireland. O nly a few police are reg u larly arm ed - for instance, those w ho guard p o liticians and d ip lo m ats or w ho patrol airports. In certain circu m stan ces specially trained police o fficers can be arm ed, but only w ith the signed p erm issio n o f a m agistrate. All m em bers o f the police m ust have gained a certain level o f academ ic qualifications at school and undergone a p erio d o f intensive training. L ike the arm y, th ere are a n um ber o f ranks: after the C h ie f C onstable com es the A ssistant C h ie f C onstable, C h ie f S uperintendent, C h ief Inspector, Inspector, S erg ean t and C onstable.

T he police are h elp ed by a num ber o f S pecial C o n stab les - m em b ers o f the public w ho w ork for the police v o lu n tarily for a few hours a w eek. E ach police force has its ow n C rim inal Investigation D ep artm en t (C ID ). M em bers o f C ID s are detectives, and th ey do no t w ear uniform s.

R obert Peel w as ed u cated at H arrow School and C hrist C hurch, O xford, w here he w on a double first in classics and m athem atics. In 1809 Sir R obert Peel rew arded his son academ ic success by buying him the p arliam en tary seat o f C ashel in T ipperary (exchanged for C hippenham in 1812).

A s H o m e Secretary, he introduced a num ber o f im portant reform s o f B ritish crim inal law: m o st m em orably establishing the M etropolitan P olice Force (M etropolitan Police A ct 1829). H e also refo rm ed the crim inal law, reducing the n um ber o f crim es punishable by death, and sim p lified it by repealing a large num ber o f crim inal statutes and consolidating their provisions into w h at are know n as P eel's Acts.
