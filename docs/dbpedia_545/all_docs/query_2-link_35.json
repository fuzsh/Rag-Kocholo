        "text": "The Met’s top comms man Dick Fedorcio is set to give oral evidence at 12.30pm today, after former Met commissioner Stephenson, who quit his post on Sunday after ongoing outrage over his connections to the phone-hacking saga.\n\nThe oral evidence session on unauthorised tapping or hacking of mobile communications is the latest hearing held by the Commons home affairs select committee chaired by Labour MP Keith Vaz.\n\nVaz said of the hearing: ‘Evidence to us last Tuesday from current and former employees of the Metropolitan Police Service left a number of unanswered questions.\n\n‘I have therefore invited Sir Paul Stephenson and Mr Fedorcio to give evidence to ensure the committee is in possession of all the relevant facts before we write our report.’\n\nStephenson resigned from his post on Sunday after coming under fire for hiring former News of the World executive Neil Wallis as a comms adviser. He also accepted a £12,000 ‘freebie’ stay at a luxury spa from Wallis’ client Champneys.\n\nStephenson said: ‘I carry ultimate responsibility. I wish we had judged some matters in this affair differently.’\n\nJohn Yates, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, also tendered his resignation on Monday afternoon amid reports he was about to be suspended pending ongoing investigations into the UK’s phone-hacking scandal."
