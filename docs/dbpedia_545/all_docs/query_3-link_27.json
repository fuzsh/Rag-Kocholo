        "text": "The Bristol Bus Boycott was a pivotal moment for the civil rights of black people in the UK. It was influential in the creation of the Race Relations Act 1965, which made “racial discrimination unlawful in public places” and the Race Relations Act 1968, which extended the provisions to employment and housing.\n\nPeople are now calling for a statue of civil rights activist Paul Stephenson to be erected in the place where the memorial of slave trader Edward Colston previously stood in Bristol.\n\nDuring the Black Lives Matter demonstration in the city on Sunday, protesters toppled the bronze sculpture of Colston and dumped it in the harbour.\n\nMore than 8,000 people have signed a petition calling on Bristol City Council to replace it with a statue of Mr Stephenson, who led the Bristol Bus Boycott in 1963.\n\nWhat happened at the Bristol Bus Boycott?\n\nIn the 1960s and prior years, the Bristol Omnibus company refused to employ black people.\n\nSome black individuals worked behind the scenes jobs, such as mechanics and cleaners, but were not allowed to be presented as the face of the company.\n\nAt first, no-one admitted that black people were banned from working on Bristol's bus crews.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nAnyone who was even vaguely acquainted with the service, however, was aware no non-white people worked there.\n\nThe cover was broken in 1961 when the Bristol Evening Post ran a series of articles alleging the existence of the \"colour bar\".\n\nPaul Stephenson, a youth worker, decided to challenge the company.\n\nAfter an advert appeared in the local newspaper recruiting trainee bus conductors, Mr Stephenson decided to send one of his pupils, Guy Bailey, who was also black, to try and get a job there.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nBlack Lives Matter: Is it illegal to go to BLM protests?\n\nAnthony Bryan: Who is Windrush Scandal victim?\n\nGeorge Floyd death: what did George Floyd do to get arrested?\n\nMr Bailey was rejected for the job, so Mr Stephenson contacted the local papers to inform them what happened, catching the bus company off-guard.\n\nThe boycott quickly gathered pace, and the people of Bristol refused to ride the bus.\n\nMarches and demonstrations were held across the city, and bus depots were picketed.\n\nEventually it attracted the attention of big politicians like Harold Wilson and Tony Benn who lent their support, and led to people of colour being allowed to work in front-facing jobs on public transport.\n\nWho is Paul Stephenson?\n\nBorn in 1937 to West Indian parents, Mr Stephenson is a well-known figure in Bristol for his activism.\n\nHe served his country as part of the Royal Air Force in the 1950s, and has worked in various race relations and activism roles throughout his life.\n\nIn the following year, Stephenson achieved national prominence when he refused to leave a public house without being served.\n\nHe was charged with failing to leave a licensed premises and was tried in a magistrates court.\n\nThe case was dismissed and the barman was dismissed by his employer.\n\nMr Stephenson was awarded an OBE for his work in 2009.\n\nHis story is similar to civil rights activist Rosa Parks, a black woman who refused to give her seat up to a white man on a bus in Alabama in 1955, sparking the civil rights movement in America."
