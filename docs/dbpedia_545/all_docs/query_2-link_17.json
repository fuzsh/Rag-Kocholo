        "text": "The Videos/Lyrics\n\nOn May 11, 2021, the United States notified Defendant of its intent to admit into evidence at trial, three publicly available YouTube music videos in which Defendant purportedly raps about his drug activities, as well as transcripts of those videosâ€™ lyrics. [Docs. 97, 99].2 In those videos, Defendant raps under the name \"BOC FREDO.\" The first video, titled \"TRAPALOT,\" was published on January 21, 2019.3 The second video, published on September 8, 2019, is titled \"SIDEWALK NI***,\"4 and presents Defendant rapping as a featured performer alongside another rapper who performs under the name \"BOC GOOLIE.\" The third video, \"TOP SHOTTAZ,\" was published the same date as the traffic stop, seizures, and arrest at issue in this case, July 6, 2020.5 In that video, Defendant performs alongside another rapper named \"B9.\"\n\nThe Motion in Limine\n\nDefendant immediately moved to exclude these videos as irrelevant and inadmissible. [Doc. 99]. On July 8, 2021, Defendant filed an amended motion in limine , raising additional arguments for exclusion of the rap videos. [Doc. 110]. First, Defendant argues that the rap songs are inadmissible hearsay pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 801 and 802. Id. at pp. 2-4. In fact, Defendant contends that the videos are fictional and a musical art form and are not meant to be interpreted literally. Id. at pp. 2-3. Next, Defendant argues that the videos will bring inadmissible bad character propensity evidence or gang association evidence through a backdoor into the trial and, therefore, it is inadmissible pursuant to Rule 404. Id. at pp. 5-10. Thirdly, Defendant argues that the videos should be excluded as unfairly prejudicial pursuant to Rule 403, because they include gratuitous profanity, refer to women in derogatory terms, and include references to violence. Id. at pp. 11-21. As an alternative, Defendant seeks exclusion of certain portions of the lyrics in the event the Court finds the videos are admissible. Id. at pp. 21-33.\n\nResponding to the original motion in limine , the United States argues that the lyrics were Defendant's own words and thus admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) as statements of an opposing party. [Doc. 99 at p. 1]. The United States also argues that the three YouTube videos are relevant because they have a tendency to prove facts of consequence, including that:\n\nthe defendant knew that the 429.68 grams of marijuana were in the bag in his car; (2) the defendant constructively possessed that marijuana; (3) he intended to distribute that marijuana; ([4]) the $19,785 in cash found in the same bag as the marijuana represented proceeds of drug sales or money intended to be used to purchase additional supply and thus facilitate narcotics trafficking; and (4) the defendant possessed the gun for the purpose of furthering his narcotics trafficking.\n\nId. at p. 7. The United States further argues that the videos are highly probative, on-topic, and important to the proof of Defendant's participation in criminal activity and that this case is far more similar to ones in which the admission of videos has been upheld. Id. at pp. 8-9. At the hearing, the United States argued that the recency or remoteness of the videos is irrelevant.\n\nAdmissibility of Out-of-Court Statements\n\nThe United States offers the three YouTube videos as statements offered against an opposing party pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(A). According to Rule 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against an opposing party and was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) ; United States v. Santos , 947 F.3d 711, 723 (11th Cir. ) (stating same). All three videos contain statements made by Defendant and are being offered against him in order to prove various elements of the offenses. Defendant's statements, to the extent they are understood, in the YouTube videos would qualify as non-hearsay statements. See United States v. Garmany , 762 F.2d 929, 938 (11th Cir. ) (finding that statements made by Defendant, as testified to by a government witness, were clearly admissible as admissions by a party opponent); United States v. Willis , 759 F.2d 1486, 1501 (11th Cir. ) (holding that the district judge properly allowed Defendant's statement to be introduced as a non-hearsay admission by a party opponent). However, Rule 801(d)(2)(A) does not allow for admission of those..."
