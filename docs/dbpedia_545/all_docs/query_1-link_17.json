The Metropolitan Police Authority has been replaced by the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPC).\n\nSee the MOPC website for further information.\n\nMPA appoints new Deputy Assistant Commissioner to the Metropolitan Police Service\n\n41/05\n\n8 August 2005\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Authority has appointed a new Deputy Assistant Commissioner (DAC) to lead the new Diversity and Citizen Focus Command in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\nThe new DAC is Commander Rose Fitzpatrick.\n\nA panel of five MPA members interviewed the candidates. Paul Stephenson, MPS Deputy Commissioner, acted as police advisor and Catherine Crawford, Chief Executive and Clerk to the MPA, was also in attendance.\n\nMPA Chair Len Duvall, who led the promotion panel, said:\n\nâI congratulate Rose Fitzpatrick on her appointment as Deputy Assistant Commissioner. She made an excellent impression on the panel and displayed an out standing track record of working with diverse communities, together with an ability to challenge, modernise and reform strategically critical areas of work, cutting across organisational boundaries.\n\nâPlaying a major role policing the capital is a challenge that exacts the highest degree of professionalism and expertise from all serving officers and I know that Ms Fitzpatrick will lead by example and promote confidence within our communities.â\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner, Paul Stephenson, said:\n\nâThe role of Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the MPS is a challenging one that demands strong leadership skills combined with sound policing experience at all levels. I wish DAC Fitzpatrick well in this strategically important role.â\n\nNotes to editors\n\n1. Rose Fitzpatrick - Biography\n\nRose Fitzpatrick joined the police service as a constable in the City of London Police in 1987. She served in the City in uniform operational posts at each rank to chief inspector, and in the mid-1990s also worked with Her Majestyâs Inspectorate of Constabulary, inspecting and supporting forces in England and Wales.\n\nIn 1998 Rose Fitzpatrick transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service as the superintendent responsible for operational policing in the culturally diverse East End borough of Tower Hamlets. In 2000 she was promoted to chief superintendent and appointed as the borough commander. At that time, Tower Hamlets was the most socially deprived borough in the UK, and had a history of poor police/public relations. In this challenging environment she worked with a committed and gifted team of colleagues to improve trust and confidence in local policing, and to deliver more effective policing services.\n\nIn 2002 Rose Fitzpatrick was appointed to the rank of commander in the MPS, to lead a team working closely with the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs to progress police and criminal justice reform. She was also responsible for developing the MPS approach to organisational growth and the initial business case for funding the creation of MPS Safer Neighbourhood Teams across London.\n\nRose Fitzpatrickâs most recent role as a commander has been to oversee operational policing and performance issues across the boroughs of North West London."
