        "text": "Sir Paul Stephenson, 55, has been acting commissioner of the Metropolitan Police since the beginning of December following the resignation of Sir Ian Blair.\n\nThe Lancashire-born son of a butcher's career sight was set on shoe salesmanship but when his brother joined the force, Stephenson followed in his footsteps in 1975. By 1988, Lancashire constabulary had promoted him to superintendent.\n\nDuring the course of his career, he joined Northern Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary during the Troubles, became assistant chief constable at Merseyside police and in the summer of 2002 became chief constable of Lancashire before leaving in March 2005 to become deputy commissioner of the Met.\n\nSaid to be Boris Johnson's favourite, many thought Stephenson had scuppered his chances after his involvement in the arrest of Damian Green, the shadow home secretary, last December. Described as a straight talker who is good with the media, some suggested that he was too close to the old Sir Ian Blair regime to be appointed to head up a force that employs 49,000 officers and staff.\n\nNicknamed Rusty in the force because of his permatan, he stuck his head above the parapet when he issued a statement to the tribunal investing claims of racial discrimination by assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, saying it was time for everyone to \"shut up\" and get on with their jobs.\n\nWith experience in counter-terrorism, he was an ideal candidate for the Met job - which pays Â£253,622 and is for a fixed five-year term - the advert for which said the new commissioner would need to have \"an outstanding track record in combating terrorism\".\n\nStephenson was awarded the Queen's Policing Medal for services to policing in May 2000 and he received a knighthood in the Queens Birthday Honours List of June 2008."
