Paul Stephenson is looking beyond the spreadsheet and asking what’s in your soul. As the world evolves how does leadership and businesses offer new opportunities?\n\nAt the heart of business is the leader and her/his team, so how do they become more heartfelt?\n\nWith the new world combined with new leadership we’re going to see a shift in how we administer our time. Paul will introduce his new world concept called cybertime."
