        "text": "Britain's two most senior police officers rounded on Boris Johnson's London administration tonight and vowed to fight for their independence from political interference in response to Tory claims that they had seized control of Scotland Yard.\n\nSir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, and Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, reacted angrily after the London mayor's deputy told the Guardian that the Conservatives in the capital now had their \"hands on the tiller\" of Britain's biggest force.\n\nThe remarks by Kit Malthouse drew a furious rebuke from Stephenson, who broke off from his holiday to flatly reject suggestions that his authority was being undermined. He sent an internal message to all staff at the Yard and in a letter to the Guardian made clear he was in sole charge of the force.\n\n\"I do not want anyone to be under the misapprehension that the Metropolitan police service is under the operational control of any political party,\" he said.\n\n\"While the Home Office and the police authority have a right and duty to set priorities, budget and hold us to account, I set the operational strategy and direction for the Met. All operational decisions are taken without fear or favour for any individual, political or other interest. I can reassure you that I have no intention or expectation of this changing now or in the future.\"\n\nSources at the Met said that Stephenson and his senior colleagues have become increasingly irked by the attitude of some of Johnson's team, who have been privately boasting they had been setting the agenda for the Met over the last few months. Stephenson is now considering using a speech to a policing conference later this month to warn of the dangers of politicising the police.\n\nHe was joined in his denunciation by Orde, who was formerly chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who said he opposed politicians overseeing policing with \"every professional bone in my body\".\n\n\"If people seriously think some form of elected individual is better placed to oversee policing I am interested to see the details of how that is going to work.Every professional bone in my body tells me that it is a bad idea that could drive a coach and horses through the current model of accountability.\"\n\nHeated phone calls between the Met, the Home Office, and the mayor's office resulted in Johnson reportedly claiming to be unaware of his deputy mayor's views. Later he said through a spokesperson that he had confidence in Malthouse.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), chaired by Johnson with Malthouse the vice-chair, said in a statement: \"The views expressed by Kit Malthouse are his own.\" The Conservative party, said by Malthouse to be studying the way policing is governed in London as a model for the rest of the country, stayed silent.\n\nIn an internal email to MPA members, its chief executive, Catherine Crawford, said the mayor's top aide had meant to express his support for Stephenson in the tape-recorded Guardian interview.\n\n\"The message he was trying to put across was that the authority now has more influence and is using that influence to best effect to strengthen the Met's performance against crime. Far from undermining Sir Paul, he was very supportive of his appointment and his approach to policing issues throughout the interview.\"\n\nDuring the interview Malthouse said the Tory regime was going public about the extent to which politicians, including the Labour-run Home Office, have for years influenced policing.\n\nCritics call it interfering but Malthouse said: \"Anyone who thinks that politicians have not been quietly involved with the police, or indeed that smart police officers have not been taking account of the views of politicians, is living in cloud cuckoo land.\"\n\nThe Home Office said: \"The claim that the Metropolitan police no longer answers to the Home Office is incorrect. Policing priorities for all forces, including the Met, are set by the Home Office â€¦ This is far too important to be used as a political football.\"\n\nKeith Vaz MP, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said: \"The deputy mayor's claims are astonishing. Any attempt by City Hall to alter the way in which the Met is run may have damaging consequences for policing in London.\""
