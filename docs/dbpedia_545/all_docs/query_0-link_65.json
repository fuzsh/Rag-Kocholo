        "text": "All blog posts 2012 + Original posts, from 2006 to 2012\n\nClick to tweet this post\n\nComment at end\n\n21st May 2012\n\nI just found the below in my archives and thought I should re-publish it. It is a compilation of some posts at this blog from January to November 2007, a particularly hot time for Tony Blair and his colleagues. Its contents may have some relevance today as Peter Mandelson made it clear at the Leveson Inquiry that he believes John Yates personally leaked information to the press as the Cash for Honours debacle of an investigation did its worst. (Most recent at top.) I’ve noticed that some of the links below no longer work. Interesting that.\n\n__________\n\n16th November 2007\n\nA few quick updates:\n\n1. The Met continues to have its worries over whether or not another Blair should be given the chop! Sir Ian Blair, Met Commissioner, following the Jean de Menezes affair. He shouldn’t go. Like the other Blair, we need him.\n\n2. And, the Cash For Honours fiasco cost the taxpayer almost one and a half million pounds!\n\n3. And Jonathan Evans, Head of MI5 is telling us what the politicians, in hock to the liberal press and the inner-city Muslim vote, are afraid to tell us. We are under long and short-term threat from jihadist brainwashers.\n\n__________\n\n26th Sep, 2007: Updated link:\n\nJohn Humphrys interview of Tony Blair, February 2nd 2007. “I’m not going to beg for my character”. [Note: This audio link may not work. BBC loses things! See transcript here]\n\n__________\n\nFriday 20th July, 2007\n\nIT’S OVER, MR BLAIR\n\nAs I write the CPS have made their official announcements on the ending of this ‘cash for peerages’ inquiry. So THIS time the leakers were on the ball. I expect it genuinely HAS ended. Should bl***y well think so too.\n\n“Insufficient evidence” it seems, according to some in the press. Sounds unlikely and inaccurate reporting that. Couldn’t be, could it, from our trustworthy press?\n\nGB/PM seems to want to draw a line under all of Tony Blair’s time in office, or perhaps a line THROUGH Blair’s time in office! In April 2007 the file went from the Met to the CPS. Mr Blair was questioned again, for a third term but not under caution, so he was never likely to be charged.\n\nTo be fair to the police, this £1,000,000+ inquiry, once it had started, was bound to go on until it had reached a conclusion. Whether they were wise to pursue this particularly high-profile inquiry I’m sure they will be wondering.\n\nThe bottom line to me has been that some kind of quid pro quo has been the norm for centuries as regards peerages. In the absence of full public political funding, and people do NOT seem to want to pay for democracy through taxes, that is to be expected.\n\nWas it an SNP-inspired political stunt as Tony McNulty insists? Possibly. If so it was irresponsible, since Angus MacNeil should have known that it could have brought down a Prime Minister and a whole government. And this was the government that had already made changes in party funding and in Lords reform – not BECAUSE of SNP allegations, but well BEFORE that.\n\n“Why is nothing going to happen after ALL this time, paperwork and money?” said Angus Robinson, of the SNP.\n\nYou might well ask.\n\nThis government – hardly the worst abusers of all time.\n\nHOW DAMAGING?\n\nWe will have to wait to see; but suffice it to say that the usual climate is that politicians are not trusted by many at the best of times.\n\nThe “whiter than white” hopes of Tony Blair on coming into Downing Street were a rod for his own back, of course. But it is shameful that he goes down in history as the ONLY sitting prime minister ever to have been questioned by the police. And not just once, but three times.\n\nIt’s been damaging – VERY damaging. And for me, losing my trusted prime minister under this cloud has made me question the propriety of the Scottish Nationalist party, the Press and even the Police.\n\n__________\n\nSunday 29th April, 2007\n\nBEWARE Yates, warns Palace\n\nFollowing the Paul Burrell case on the late Princess Diana’s artefacts, an inquiry investigated by Assistant Commissioner John Yates, The Observer reveals that Buckingham Palace was severely rattled by Yates’s approach.\n\nIt is understood the Queen’s Private Secretary, Sir Robin Janvrin told Jonathan Powell, the PM’s Chief of Staff, that they were unhappy with Yates’s “dogged approach” during the Burrell investigation. Powell was told that John Yates turned the royal household inside out during the Burrell affair.\n\nYates’s handling of the investigation that led to the trial of Paul Burrell, the former butler to the late Diana, Princess of Wales on charges that he stole some of her property, angered the Palace. The Palace felt badly bruised by the trial, which collapsed in 2002 after the Queen recalled a conversation with Burrell in which he said he was keeping some of the princess’s effects.A well-placed source claimed: ‘Jonathan was told Yates is a menace.’\n\nNumber 10 has probably realised that. In fact we have all been told that Yates is terrier-like in his tenacity. That’s been interpreted as a “good thing”; someone not intimidated by anyone at the top of government, even the PM. Someone who was “just following the leads”.\n\nBut Yates lost the Burrell case after all that work. And there is nothing quite so grizzly as a terrier with a bone in its mouth, who has had it removed – not just once, but twice.\n\nOne day we might ask if Yates was the right one to pursue the cash-for-honours investigation at all.\n\nWas he able to distance himself objectively from the failure in the Burrell case after the last-minute high-level recollection by the Queen, whereupon the case collapsed?\n\nWould he have been determined to compensate for that earlier failure?\n\nFor instance, were his interviews of the Prime Minister to make sure that Mr Blair would be less likely to recall something at the last minute to throw the whole case?\n\nIn other words would his investigations be fair and proportionate as well as thorough?\n\nI expect one day we’ll hear something about how Downing Street was turned upside down by Yates’s men in the great Quest for Truth and Justice that will go down in history as –\n\n*Tony Blair – First Prime Minister Questioned by Police – and TWICE*\n\n__________\n\nThursday 26th April, 2007\n\nTracing The Leak – Wet Fingers?\n\nToday the word is out that Scotland Yard itself, or members of, might have been leaking on the Birmingham terror event. And the Home Secretary has denied in a letter that anything was leaked from his department. So the Conservatives might have been running their fingers along the wrong pipework, going for the Government yesterday in Parliament. Today David Cameron is trying to make mileage out of the fact that Tony Blair said “no” to Cameron’s demand into an inquiry into this. What else is he going to say? “Yes, OK”? A week before the local elections? Come on, Mr Cameron. We can see right through you.\n\nAs I have said before, the leakers are not all necessarily in the government. The police and press are equally likely to be culpable. After Mr Blair goes, the next PM will have greater motivation and fewer constraints to getting to the bottom of this tripartite and powerful relationship. With the cash-for-honours nonsense still ongoing, and elections in the air, this is not the time.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday 25th April, 2007\n\nDAC Peter Clarke is complaining about leaks around the January Birmingham case, where several were arrested but as yet, no-one has been charged. The implication being drawn is that someone connected to the government is the leaker. Whether that is what he meant to imply, only he knows, and he has said he implied nothing. But it does make me wonder; if, as he says, the leak “endangered life” why, if these men (or the leak) were so dangerous, hasn’t someone been charged with the Birmingham “beheading video”? Can’t have it both ways. They were either dangerous or innocent.\n\nWho is distracting whom here. It’s bad enough that the opposition parties are using this for electoral advantage at this time, but worse still if the police are using it to cover up their inability to progress with charges against these “dangerous'” men. Hhmm..mm\n\n__________\n\nThursday 15th March, 2007\n\nInspector Yates today implied that he is going to go on and on, with no time limit on his inquiry. So that’s that then. Shut up and do as you’re told, the British government. You know who’s in charge. Click here for latest news\n\n__________\n\nFriday 9th March, 2007\n\nWho Runs This Joint?\n\nWell, it’s not QUITE a police state, but I’m still very concerned about the length of time they have taken to find “villains” in this destructive inquiry. Perhaps there aren’t any! At last MPs are beginning to raise this question. What kept them? Who runs this joint anyway? It seems they wish Inspector Yates to appear before their committee. Having suspended their own inquiry into the cash-for-honours issue last May, they, like the rest of us, had a right to expect that the police would have dismissed or got to the bottom of this by now. And now the Met, and particularly Yates, are getting desperate. And desperate men are not the most reliable.\n\n__________\n\nSunday, 4th March, 2007\n\nFollowing the Attorney General’s injunction to the BBC to prevent the broadcast of a ‘cash-for-honours” report, speculation is rife as to how long before charges are brought, on what and against whom. It seems the police are unhappy about “leaking” of e-mail information which, it seems, they hold as evidence against members of the Prime Minister’s inner circle.\n\nThree questions come to my mind.\n\n1 Do the police know for sure and without reasonable doubt that No 10 was leaking to the BBC?\n\n2 How did No 10 know about this imminent police angle on the e-mail? Is it a recent development or long-standing?\n\n3 Could this be a police ‘double bluff’ – with the police doing the leaking but blaming it on No 10? If the police suspect the e-mail evidence to be too flimsy to hold up, it is not beyond imagination that they are attempting to spread unfounded rumours of No 10 dirty tricks. Then No 10, or those associated, might be tempted to incriminate themselves, so breaking SOME law or other. The police know you use a sprat to catch a mackerel. And while I’m in this metaphorical mode, as someone once said, “you must lose a fly to catch a trout”.\n\nRemember, the injunction is still in place, so every party is (presumably) gagged. Does that apply to the police too?\n\nPowers of Arrest – Citizen’s Arrest\n\nI’ve been thinking about this powers of arrest business, both from the police point of view and from the angle of a “citizen’s arrest” arising from this page.\n\nWhen the honours suspects were arrested I couldn’t quite see why they needed to be arrested at all. And this BBC website seems to confirm that it was a bit over-the-top in the cases of those particular individuals, as they were hardly likely to abscond! But, it seems that the police have wide powers of arrest, though you could have fooled some of us, when we watch some criminals being cautioned gently rather than arrested. The BBC site says:\n\n“In reality, this means that the police have almost unlimited powers of arrest if they choose to exercise it. Unless you are carrying some kind of identity card, any offence could be regarded as arrestable.”\n\nSo, if they all had identity cards, and so could have confirmed their identity, perhaps they would not have been arrested!? I don’t think so somehow. The reason for the arrests had less to do with identification than with making some sort of statement, in my humble opinion.\n\nThe “citizen’s arrest” is something else which has aroused my interest. A BNP member’s website, from which I have quoted here, seems to be hinting at this legal process. (At least I THINK that’s what it’s hinting at!)\n\n“To paraphrase another serial killer, George W. Bush, if we can’t bring Tony Blair to justice, we must bring justice to Tony Blair.”\n\nCitizen’s Arrest – as on the BBC site\n\nThe police are not the only people with the power to make an arrest. Although there have been some highly publicised cases which suggest the power of the individual citizen is strictly limited, the law still recognises a citizen’s arrest. So a member of the public may arrest someone who is committing an arrestable offence such as theft or assault, or suspects that such an offence has been committed. They are allowed to use reasonable force in doing so.\n\nWhat exactly is “reasonable force”? And is a citizen’s arrest limited to such as “theft or assault”, presumably in which someone is caught red-handed? If so, the Conspirators on this page, with their ideas of justice, can put their ‘cuffs away . By the way, how many “citizens’ arrests” are made annually in this country? If you have any idea, please let me know.\n\n__________\n\nThursday 8th February, 2007\n\nAll leaks sorted! Wonder if the plumber will need to be called again any time soon?\n\n__________\n\nTuesday 6th February, 2007\n\nThe CPS has said there is insufficient evidence to press charges on Des Smith, the headteacher questioned by police at the beginning of the whole sorry business.\n\n__________\n\nMonday 5th February, 2007\n\nLeaks, leaks and yet more leaks. Somebody has a retention problem! The Times is today’s villain of the piece.\n\n__________\n\nSaturday 4th February, 2007\n\nIain Duncan Smith has gone up in my estimation. On Radio 4’s “Any Questions” he had the audacity to question the Police’s handling of this inquiry focusing so heavily as it has done, on the Prime Minister. Glad to see one member of parliament not afraid to raise his head above the parapet.At some stage in the future, perhaps we can expect more of this reasonable reaction from others. Come to think of it – I think that blond, mad but likable Tory – Boris Johnson said something about the length of time it is all taking on Andrew Neil’s sofa politics programme last night. You know, the one with Michael Portillo and Diane Abbott – This Week(?)So there you are then. I’m not the only one who’s noticed this police treatment of the PM as though he is beneath the law and can be treated any way, any how. So far the complainants have both been Conservatives! What’s going on here? Would they like Mr Blair to take over their party. Replace the Clone with Tone?\n\nFriday 2nd February, 2007\n\nThe police have released a statement backing up the Prime Minister’s stated reasons for the news blackout over his interview last Friday. It was at police request and for operational reasons. The Metropolitan Police issued a statement saying:\n\n“The prime minister has been interviewed briefly to clarify points emerging from the ongoing investigation. He was interviewed as a witness, not as a suspect and co-operated fully.\n\n“We requested the meeting was kept confidential for operational reasons. We are not prepared to discuss further.”\n\nAnd in an interview with John Humphrys on Radio 4’s “Today” programme the PM touched on some of the questions of his authority raised by the continuing inquiry as well as on matters of policy which he would like to complete before his time in office is over.\n\nVideo & Audio Reports\n\nUpdate to this – added 26 September, 2007.\n\nThis Humphrys interview below seems to have disappeared from the web! If anyone has a copy please let me know. In the meantime, listen to this report by the BBC’s Mark Sanders on the issue.\n\nRadio 4 Interview with John Humphrys – Audio (27m 33s)\n\nJH – “You could say, ‘I’m going to put an end to it’ … and then it wouldn’t be about Tony Blair the Prime Minister, would it? That’s the point. Why not stand down now?”\n\nPM – “It’s not a very democratic way to decide who the prime minister is …”\n\nJH – “You’ve already decided that, you’ve said that you’re going.” So why not stand down – why not put an end to it all?”\n\nPM – “Because I don’t think that’s the right way to do it and I think it would be particularly wrong to do it before the inquiry has run its course … so you’ll have to put up with me a bit longer”.\n\n——————————————————————————\n\nBBC News Video clip – Mark Sanders (1min 41sec)\n\nTB – “I’m not going to beg for my character in front of anyone”.\n\nMS – “Mr Blair blames the media for making a meal out of the affair”.\n\nThursday 1st February, 2007\n\nBLACKOUT Order by Police\n\nThe PM’s second interview as a witness is now public knowledge. The interview took place last Friday, four days before that of Lord Levy. It is important that we understand that Scotland Yard insisted that the interview was to be kept secret until today for “operational reasons”. This blackout was not the Government’s or the Prime Minister’s choice. In fact, it seems that very few people knew about the interview, most of the PM’s staff included.\n\nNow I know the political climate is such that NOTHING concerning the PM is taken at face value. But if the Police made this confidential request, which they have confirmed today, Mr Blair can take none of the blame for this withholding of information. The press are making much of this, as you might expect. They feel their noses out of joint. They criticise the fact that the PM’s official spokesman did not tell them anything at the daily press briefings (though it is clear that he was also kept behind the Police blackout order). If the Police wanted knowledge of the interview kept back “for operational reasons” and they were subsequently “completely satisfied” with Mr Blair’s co-operation, the resultant press furore is perhaps evidence that even the Police realise the damage their extensive and extended inquiry is causing through news commentary.\n\nAs to whether the goings-on have any underlying purpose from the Police’s viewpoint, I think the jury, no pun intended, is still out. I was expecting to read a statement by the Police as mentioned on No 10’s website today, but have as yet been unable to find one on The Met’s website, or elsewhere. Are the Police preparing the ground for an announcement that there will be no charges? Newsnight tonight raised this viewpoint as “from sources”. If so, their arguments could follow this line:“We interviewed the PM as a witness in December and then, (since the damage had already been done to his reputation – [though I doubt if that was a concern of theirs] ) again last Friday. Our questions have been answered satisfactorily. The other chief suspects in this investigations have also answered all of our questions. We have done all we can and will provide the CPS with our (limited) information. It is then in the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if there is a case to answer. Our investigation can no longer be accused of interfering with the smooth running of government.\n\n“Click here to read more of my musings on the police handling of this investigation which has repercussions for all of us, not just those in the glare of the media spotlight.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday 31st January, 2007\n\nNo 10 Call For Media Restraint\n\nMedia (and presumably Police) expression of opinion has been called upon to restrain its opinion and comment in the light of the fact that those under the spotlight are unable to defend themselves.\n\nSince I am one of the few who speak out in support of the government’s position I will happily go along with this, as soon as others do. In any case I do not have the readership of the dailies! At the moment I receive dozens of e-mail alerts from those convinced of pm/government guilt with each arrest or development. This includes national newspaper reports from anti-war / anti-Blair papers as well as bloggers and media reports on leaked snippets from Scotland Yard.\n\n**********\n\nPOLICE INQUIRIES – Terrorist Plots & Cash For Honours\n\nOur police are the best in the world. I believe that implicitly and unreservedly. It still amazes many that we have an unarmed force (largely) in this day and age.\n\nSterling work is going on this morning in the Birmingham terror raids. Earlier today a security specialist commented on the news that the eight arrested might have been looking at different terror tactics than the usual bombings.\n\nSince then the police have asked for restraint in speculation and analysis at this early stage. Fat chance of that! Perhaps police leaking of honour snippets is resulting in their protestations being largely ignored.\n\nThe earlier suggestion by SkyNews’s security specialist of, for example, political assassination, seems to be inaccurate. But the suspected plan of kidnapping a young Muslim soldier, possibly murdering him and then posting this act on the internet is still about as political as it gets!\n\nAnd co-incidentally, Mr Blair’s historic announcement of elections in Northern Ireland in March, after ten years of work to secure peace, was all but overshadowed yesterday by Lord Levy’s arrest. A bitter-sweet moment then for Mr Blair, and some backing for my thoughts on the present undermining of real politics by the relentless focus on No 10.\n\nHere comes the “but” …\n\nBut, while the Police are protecting us all against terrorism there is some justification for wondering what judgement is compelling Scotland Yard to pursue so relentlessly this country’s government. Even if there is ever proved to be a case to answer, even a charge of “conspiracy to pervert the course of justice”, a much more serious criminal charge than the original inquiry focus, who does this drawn-out pursuit serve in the real interests of justice in this country?\n\nUnless digging up the gardens at No 10 proves differently, this is a “victimless” crime. Is Yates of the Yard’s quest to show himself as “purer than pure” in his “… just following all the leads…” approach impeding his better judgement?\n\nThe reason I ask is that regardless of the particular party involved, and I am not a member of any party, it is our government and not just our governing party which is in danger of being seriously undermined or even collapse if this investigation drags out much longer.\n\nJohn Yates, who is supposed to be above politics, has shown himself a dab hand at the political/pr spin business too. This morning a pre-recorded interview was used by the Radio 4 Today programme. Pre-recorded – thus no questions could be asked of him. Pre-recorded – when? Presumably in the full knowledge that Lord Levy would have been arrested by the time of the broadcast. In the meantime the Prime Minister, the Government and No 10 staff are unable to comment, for obvious reasons. No pre-recorded statements, leaks or running commentary for them as this story unfolds.\n\nNick Robinson remarked today that “rarely has Tony Blair been so unable to control events“. Smirkingly satisfying to some that might be. But I’d prefer to know that our elected government, whose day will come soon enough in the ballot box, are in control of the Police rather than the other way round. That’s why we elect them.\n\nYes, I realise the Police are stuck between the proverbials; damned if they do, damned if they don’t. But having started the whole investigation, perhaps unwisely, they either have enough proof to sustain their original suspicions or enough proof to push charges on a cover-up to those suspicions. It is time the CPS cast its eye over the Police evidence. Even if the CPS decides not to press charges, Inspector Yates will almost definitely have managed to secure long overdue changes to the country’s system of honours. Not a bad legacy for a policeman. And with the damage already added to Mr Blair’s legacy by this ongoing business, and considering Yates’ length of service in post, the Inspector’s mark on politics may compare favourably to the perceived legacy of the Prime Minister. Unjust? I think so.\n\nIt is time we permitted the government to get on with its job. Character assassinations by implication and threats of further arrests do not serve any of us well.\n\nBack to top\n\nRelated articles\n\nVIDEO: ‘Like wrestling with a crocodile’ (bbc.co.uk)\n\nLeveson inquiry: Lord Mandelson and Tessa Jowell – live (guardian.co.uk)\n\nOriginal Home Page\n\nAll Contents of Site – Index\n\nComment at end\n\n11th July, 2009\n\nCPS to undertake ‘urgent review’ of evidence despite Yates’s “no further investigation required.”\n\nYATES DOES IT AGAIN – OR NOT, AS THE ‘CASE’ MAY BE\n\nSUDDENLY – PROMISES OF ‘EXPLANATIONS’ & ‘REVIEWS OF EVIDENCE’\n\nToday it is reported that the Home Office has asked Scotland Yard for an explanation of what they know: Senior Home Office official Sir David Normington has written to Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner John Yates asking him to elaborate on a number of points.\n\nAnd on Thursday The Guardian reported – ‘that the Crown Prosecution Service was undertaking an urgent review of evidence in the News of the World phone hacking case.\n\nKeir Starmer QC, the director of public prosecutions, said he had ordered an “urgent examination” of material provided by the police in the News of the World case three years ago. He added that the process will take time but he hopes to make a further statement in coming days.’\n\nThis was shortly after the Metropolitan Police under the leadership of John Yates, revealed it did not plan a further investigation of the allegations. (Yates’s full statement with 4 m video.)\n\nExcerpt:\n\n“I have been asked by the Commissioner today to establish the facts around our inquiry into the alleged unlawful tapping of mobile phones by Clive Goodman and Glen Mulcaire. I was not involved in the original case and clearly come at this with an independent mind.\n\n[…]\n\n“This case has been the subject of the most careful investigation by very experienced detectives. It has also been scrutinised in detail by both the CPS and leading counsel. They have carefully examined all the evidence and prepared the indictments that they considered appropriate.\n\n“No additional evidence has come to light since this case has concluded.\n\n“I therefore consider that no further investigation is required.”\n\nIust admit, it amazed me how quickly John Yates had decided on this one.\n\nNo sooner, or so the Guardian suggests, was he asked to look at the business of journalist hacking being endemic than he quickly thumbed through the notes from the 2006 inquiry and said everything at that time checked out. Following the Guardian’s accusations of the News of The World’s ‘phone hacking’, Mr Yates was on the job.\n\nThen he was off it (BBC report.)\n\nSo was he on the right job? Are/were ANY of them – DPP, Home Office, the MET on the right job? Are you left wondering if the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing? Or is this pure obfuscation for some as yet uncovered reason?\n\nWhatever the course of the investigation we can expect a right royal dual between the organs of the political Left & Right over the next few weeks.\n\nRECENT HISTORY OF ‘YATES OF THE YARD’\n\nJohn Yates was NOT leading the department involved with the Goodman/Mulcaire case in 2006. He was a little tied up at the time; busy with far more serious matters of state. Or rather matters which might – had they succeeded – have helped reduce the state (of government) to rubble.\n\nIf I were a conspiracy theorist I’d be tempted to ask if there aren’t a few people who might be getting their own back on Yates. The leap over his head by the DPP and the Home Office … ? Promises of cash for Labour’s depleted funds IF … if…?\n\nOr is Yates NOT in the firing line at all, but Cameron, via a disgraced Coulson?\n\nJust as well I don’t DO conspiracy.\n\n“JUST DOING MY JOB”.\n\nFor around 16/17 months Assistant Commissioner Yates tried to secure a case against Tony Blair and/or colleagues on the cash for honours debacle. Mr Blair was interviewed by Police THREE times over about 18 months, the first British Prime Minister to be questioned by police. And, particularly galling I should imagine for BOTH sides, in an investigation which the Police could not make stick – to ANYONE.\n\nMr Blair and colleagues did not know if charges would be dropped until AFTER he had left office.\n\nOn that investigative occasion it took Yates almost two years to fail. Now it’s taken him TWO minutes.\n\nAll of this nonsensical “just doing my job“-ness (whiffs of Brown too?) added to the distrust of government at that time. The press and the ourt of public opinion became judge and jury on the whole issue. They were encouraged in this responsibility by … you got it … the press.\n\nAhhh! THE PRESS. The press were often, oddly, in possession of information ONLY the Police could have known. Even the knowledge that there would likely be “no case to answer” on cash for honours. We were informed by the papers of this likely outcome weeks before the Police announced it officially.\n\nHow come? Are there bodies buried in the MET’S backyard too. PRESS bodies?\n\nAnd I just remembered this:\n\nwe were informed by The Daily Mail in February 2007 that Blair would be interviewed AGAIN. How did THEY know that? In fact he was interviewed for a third time months later just as he was leaving office in June 2007. But The MAIL KNEW IT ALL, didn’t they, in their usual two and two makes five fashion? Excerpt:\n\nTony Blair is set to be quizzed by police for a third time over the cash for honours affair, it has emerged.\n\nSources close to the inquiry confirmed the interview – likely to take place within weeks – could even take place under caution.\n\nSuch a development would mean the Prime Minister is being treated as a suspect in the case and would intensify demands for him to quit before the summer.\n\nWhat a crowd of disappointed faces there must have been when no charges were made to anyone in the end.\n\nRead Yates’ statement here on hacking\n\nA week on Tuesday, Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor, now the Tory communications chief, could be grilled by MPs in a Select Committee inquiry into the affair.\n\nNo-one is suggesting there is NO case to answer by the News of The World. For a start, why make an out-of-court settlement of £700,000?\n\nRELATED\n\nFrom CPS website: Re-starting a prosecution\n\nAnd from Brand Republic – the News of the World reminds those who are paying attention: ‘News International has issued a statement in response to The Guardian’s story. It said it was prevented by “confidentiality obligations” in discussing the allegations. The statement went on to outline the chronology of events, pointing out that the Information Commissioner in an report in December 2006 had highlighted a number of papers using private investigators, including The Guardian Media Group.\n\nANDY COULSON\n\nAnd what of David Cameron’s Alastair Campbell – Andy Coulson? The former editor of the News of the World is widely belived to have come up with the “hug a hoodie” phrase used to such damaging great effect by Tony Blair AGAINST Cameron when the NoW was Blairs babe? Now Cameron owes much of his recent progress to his spin doctor. But Coulson has some serious questions to answer on what he knew of any phone tapping policy while he was editor.

But even the huge majority of callers in to Any Answers seem to be unable to see anything other than the “reasons not”.\n\nAnd they are generally “we ALL know”-ers too. For instance:\n\n1. It may be a NATO intervention in Afghanistan – “to hunt down terrorists but why was it caused? Is it a result of our foreign policy?\n\n2. I want to know the exact instructions given to the military from Blair … was it regime change by force of arms?\n\n3. What about soldiers killed from other countries? We need to know. It might show us the senselessness of the present campaign. How many Spanish and other European soldiers have been killed every day? Why has Great Britain got to take the brunt of all this… financially and militarily? We should NOT have gone into Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n4. Unless we place same value on an Afghani civilian then we do not have the moral right to say we are doing it on behalf of the Afghanis.\n\n5. “For the benefit of Afghani people” – the Miliband statement – is as false as the WMD spin.\n\n6. I am with Lord Lamont. We should start planning an exit strategy. The govermnment is resorting to scare tactics. The cause of the war was the protection of the oil pipeline. Talk of terrorist training schools was nonsense.\n\nI only heard ONE caller in support of the campaign in Afghanistan. And remember – THIS is an internationally recognised LEGAL war, so charges of “illegality” cannot be added to the mix of reasons why NOT.\n\nWhat has happened to the British people that they are so willing to abdicate ALL responsibility to others? This is NOT the Britain or the spirit that the world admires.\n\nHome\n\nNEW BLOG! Bring Back Tony Blair – Nov 2007\n\nThe Guardian Cif-ers and Other Such …\n\nAll Contents of Site – Index\n\nGo to the start of Original Post, as at site’s launch\n\nGo to Blair Videos Page – to fill that Blair-shaped hole in politics\n\nWatch my videos on Tony Blair at YouTube\n\nReferencing this page: UK Politics\n\nQuick quote: “It’s amazing how much panic one honest man can spread among a multitude of hypocrites.” Thomas Sowell\n\nComment at end\n\n26th October, 2007\n\nON A POINT OF CLARIFICATION\n\nSince I’m a fine upstanding British citizen with not even a speeding ticket to my record, I was interested to note that a top solicitor’s organization had visited my site in recent days. I only realised that after I had noticed that this particluar page had been referred by others, one of whom had changed the title to “Blair Still in Yates’ Sights” rather than as it stands here.\n\nBeing an innocent in all of this internet innuendo and responsibility (Honest, Guv … didn’t know!) I began to wonder if someone was concerned over anything I’d said.\n\nSo, just in case, to set the record straight, I was not, DEFINITELY not implying that anyone was literally gunning for Blair. It was figurative use of language, of course, as it was when I said that Yates may have been concerned over having “Blair’s blood on his hands” had the latter felt forced to resign.\n\nBut I’m still of the humble opinion that the Police were more likely to be the leakers than No 10.\n\nREASONS:\n\n1. The Police knew what their evidence was first, before No 10 was informed, so had the first opportunity to dissipate it. It is also possible that Downing Street was not informed of any strong leads, until the press were, though they’d already been interviewed. No 10 may not have had time to leak anything, even if so inclined. The police were always one step ahead.\n\n2. If Downing Street had got wind, and put it out, WHY exactly? It could have been a false trail set off by the Met to lead them to leak false information, or to try to explain it, or to cover it before it was in the public domain. Downing Street would NEVER be likely to wish to compound the issue in this way, if they were already under scrutiny for “perverting the course of justice”, which of course they were.\n\nIn the end if the press collectively was used as a cipher for all of the information and misinformation, and seemed happy to be so used, the Met was in the end outwitted by the legal decoders at the heart of government, however and from wherever came the leaks.\n\n24th October, 2007\n\nYATES POINTS THE FINGER AT BLAIR – AGAIN\n\n“Just doing my job, Guv … er Chair”, said Assistant Commissioner John Yates of the Yard, the man whose million pound inquiry into the honours fiasco came to nothing while it helped destroy a prime minister’s reputation and almost brought down a government.\n\nI didn’t catch the whole two hour session in front of the Public Administration Select Committee whose own inquiry was put on hold, by police orders, when the Met decided the public interest would be better served by this throwback to the 1950’s trawling through the internal workings of Downing Street, diary by e-mail.\n\nYes, we KNOW you were just doing your job, Inspector Yates. And we caught the loaded hesitant answer at the end as to whether you had discovered a “trade in peerages”. And we noticed that you wouldn’t say WHO in Downing Street was not being completely helpful to your inquiry, except that it should be “obvious”.\n\nStill gunning for Blair, eh?\n\nWell, join the other millions on this fruitless quest.\n\nThe question of the time it took to complete this inquiry, while Tony Blair was already under attack by some in his own party, came up a few times. The reply was that it takes as long as it takes, as different avenues are followed. Right. Blind alleys, eh?\n\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?\n\nIt seems to me that since Inspector Yates was so sure there was a case to answer, and since he had been “in close contact” with his colleagues in the CPS throughout, he could have brought this to a close MUCH earlier. But, it seems he did NOT have a case which was strong enough for the CPS. WHY NOT? Why did he not know this months earlier, having been in such close contact with the CPS?\n\nCO-OPERATION FROM WITNESSES\n\nIt was clear listening to this that Yates was getting at Downing Street as being uncooperative.\n\nAnd yet – correct me if I’m wrong – it’s late and I’m not up to trawling the internet tonight – but I am SURE Yates said at the time that witnesses HAD been co-operative, including the then prime minister. They said they had interviewed Blair three times to follow up on points raised from other interviewees and to clarify slight discrepancies raised in subsequent interviews. Am I recalling correctly here?\n\nIf so, why is he changing his story now?\n\nWell, imho, to leave the stain on Mr Blair as the real villain of the piece, in order to keep his own sheet clean.\n\nPRESSURE FROM NUMBER 10\n\nOh, poor love. It’s nice to see that he and his colleagues too were under pressure as well as those who had to withstand public opprobrium for over a year, though in the end were charged with nothing!\n\nI still get angry about this ‘case’, mainly because it added to the press’s general approach to Blair, i.e. that if someone said he’d done it, then he must have.\n\nAnd yes, I know he was only interviewed as a witness. And to be fair to Inspector Yates he said he had expected to be informed of the impact that his line of pursuit might have on the country’s prime minister and, it seems, on the Police and “beyond”.\n\nExcerpt: The Western Mail:\n\n‘Mr Yates indicated that he had been warned that Mr Blair was prepared to step down as Prime Minister if he had been questioned as a suspect.\n\nAsked if Mr Blair or those around him had warned he could quit as a way of exerting pressure, Mr Yates said, “I would expect anybody looking after the interests of anyone at that level to set out a range of consequences to someone like me, in my position, who is managing the entire investigation, of the risk impact to the Metropolitan Police and beyond.’\n\nSo, it was hardly, as the anti-Blair papers liked to portray it, a threat from Downing Street that Yates could end up with Blair’s blood on his hands.\n\nYates said he was under pressure and it was “bloody difficult”, but that he was not put under undue pressure by Downing Street, and the pressure had made no difference to his handling of the inquiry.\n\nPRESS LEAKS\n\nFrom what I heard today we didn’t manage to work out who exactly was doing the persistent leaking. The press, of course, thought it was No 10, and I thought it was the Police. I still do. They were trying to frighten witnesses or those under scrutiny to “grass”. It was pretty clear then and it still is, imho.\n\nConsidering that Yates’s people were operating inside a highly secure padded cell, more or less, where every detail of anything was under lock and key and nothing could be brought in or taken out without the inspector’s say-so, it seems unlikely that Downing Street would have got their eyes on anything to leak to the press. And if they had, why use it?\n\nIf they had a “friendly” source inside the inspector’s padded cell, and had been found out being informed by him, would THAT have helped them to remain innocent? Course not!\n\nPERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE\n\nRemember this? Ruth Turner and Lord Levy getting into some confusion about their stories and Turner complaining to Jonathan Powell that she was being asked to provide a different story?\n\nWasn’t THAT what the press told us? The Mail and the usual (un)worthies?\n\nAnd yet even this tack, which always looked so hopeful to some sad souls in the media, came to nothing.\n\nI’ve written extensively about all of this at the time.\n\nWill put links here tomorrow, but if you’re up late, you’ll have to look through the Index page for Honours/Police/ Innocent etc type pages.\n\nI’ve had enough.\n\nAnd so should Inspector Yates have had enough as soon as the Scottish Nationalist MP brought him the ‘complaint’ in the first place. Yates’s reply that the police have a duty to follow up every complaint is patent nonsense.\n\nThe police do NOT follow up every case – domestic violence, street rowdies, nuisance neighbours, to name but a few – are routinely ignored.\n\nSo if Yates thought that Downing Street regarded this as a political inquiry, rather than a criminal one, who was right in the end, then, Inspector?\n\nYes, the ‘innocent until proven guilty’. They had no case to answer. It is clear now to all of us, as it was to Blair and his colleagues at the start, that the whole thing should have been knocked on the head before it got started.\n\nThe MPs’ committee will publish their report on this by December.\n\nI wonder if Mr Blair will tell us what he thought of all of it soon? I do recall he said he would be talking about it when it had all blown over. That was in his February Radio 4 interview with John Humphrys, where he said he would not beg for his character or plead for his integrity. You will recall that.\n\nIn the end he had actually left office before the inquiry was drawn to a close by the CPS.\n\nA shameful episode, resulting in a lot of money wasted over nothing and a PM disgraced by implication or association, and the first in British history to be questioned by the police. Party workers and fund raisers suspected of dastardly business! And all over raising some money for an election campaign and thus awarding peerages in the time-honoured way.\n\nTalking about Dixon of Dock Green – just realised how wrong I was about his sort of policing. He would have given those under suspicion a sharp talking to and sent them on their way.\n\nUnforgivable, Inspector.\n\nYour turn, Mr Blair."
