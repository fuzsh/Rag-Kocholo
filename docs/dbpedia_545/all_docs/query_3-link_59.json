During my second year break I had a 6 week work placement with local BBC radio and had a package I produced used on national Radio 1 and Radio 4. I got my first full time radio job in 2005 at MFR in Inverness and worked as a producer and presenter until 2020 when I was made redundant. I then launched a podcast series, where I interview world famous classic rock stars, called Vintage Rock Pod and from that came the Vintage Rock Show which I’m delighted to present every week for Radio Skye!"
