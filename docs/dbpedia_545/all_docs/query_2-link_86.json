        "text": "The most senior police officer in London announced his intention to quit yesterday afternoon after coming under fire for hiring former News International executive Neil Wallis.\n\nSir Paul has denied any wrongdoing over the employment of Mr Wallis – who was arrested last week as part of the ongoing phone hacking probe – but said he did not want questions over his leadership to cloud the investigation.\n\nIn his resignation statement, he said: “As Commissioner I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in.\n\n“With hindsight, I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn’t and that’s it.”\n\nHe added: “I and the people who know me know that my integrity is completely intact. I may wish we had done some things differently, but I will not lose sleep over my personal integrity.\n\n“Nevertheless, I must accept that the intense media coverage, questions, commentary and indeed allegations, as demonstrated by this weekend’s attempt to misrepresent my arrangements for my recovery from illness, not only provide excessive distraction both for myself and colleagues, but are likely to continue for some time.”\n\nMr Stephenson's departure came on the same day recently-departed News International chief executive and former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks was arrested in the phone hacking investigation.\n\nOther senior police chiefs were last week quizzed by MPs over their handling of the previous investigation into phone hacking, and on alleged payments from journalists to police officers.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Tim Godwin will take charge of the Met following Sir Paul's departure, until a permanent replacement is announced."
