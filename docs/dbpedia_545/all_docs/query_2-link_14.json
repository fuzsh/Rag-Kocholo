        "text": "In his resignation letter Stephenson denies any direct involvement in hiring Wallis and ignorance of the phone hacking scandal.\n\nHowever the letter goes on to suggest that British PM David Cameron's employment of former-NOTW editor Andy Coulson caused Stephenson professional difficulty -- putting yet more pressure on Cameron.\n\nThe Mayor of London Boris Johnson met with Stephenson several times over the last week and was considering taking serious action, according to reports. Stephenson's resignation is presumed to have been anticipating this action, reports the BBC.\n\nThe Telegraph is reporting John Yates, another of the UK's most senior police officers, will be suspended for his links to Wallis. Yates is also facing calls for his resignation though sources told The Telegraph he is not considering quitting."
