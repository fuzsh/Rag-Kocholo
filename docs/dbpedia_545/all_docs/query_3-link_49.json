        "text": "Paul was born and raised in the northern dockside British town of Hull and worked in shipbuilding and the music publishing industry before turning his hand to screenwriting.\n\nPaul achieved a Distinction from the Royal Holloway University of London in his screenwriting MA and often returns as a guest speaker. He thrives under pressure, loves to work hard, either alone or as part of a creative team and enjoys bringing his endless ideas and approaches to any project.\n\nAfter being long-listed in a Kenneth Branagh one-act play competition, Paul landed a seat in the BBC’s shadow scheme for its continuous medical Drama ‘Casualty’.\n\nPaul later secured an option for an international co-production crime drama set in Antwerp with Gub Neals’ Artists Studio and Jan Theys’ Skyline/De Mensen. This project was later re-optioned by Freddy Films and Circle Blue of Canada.\n\nPaul has a number of projects in development and recently joined forces with Evil Doghouse Studios where he was commissioned as lead writer to pen the returnable gangster series ‘THE BELFAST FIXER’. Paul has since been commissioned as lead writer on two more of his own creations with Evil Doghouse which are currently under development.\n\nPaul’s first movie commission THREE DAY MILLIONAIRE, reached Number 5 in Netflix’s Top 10 UK Films Chart and he has since been commissioned by SHUSH FILMS to pen a (circa £20M) period drama entitled RUM (brief: Wolf of Wall Street meets The Great Gatsby!). This project is about to go to market.\n\nAt the time of writing Paul is developing a one-hour ‘Film for TV’, in the form of a real-time two-hander which has an established A-list British actor attached."
