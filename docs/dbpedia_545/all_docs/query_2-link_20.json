        "text": "Finally. Someone who ran the Metropolitan Police that will actually speak to the media. Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson appeared on LBC today to give his thoughts on the riots that have spread across the UK. Quick to hit out at the Prime Minister himself, Stephenson was certainly pulling no punches…\n\nQuizzed about his thoughts on the widespread disorder that has led to damaged property and multiple arrests across the country – and the government’s response to it all – the ex-police chief was, in short, rather unimpressed. Suggesting that Cobra meetings are ‘called so that politicians can be seen to be doing something’, Stephenson also told listeners:\n\nI get that politicians have to make strong statements. But on a personal basis I’m not hugely impressed by it. I will be impressed by politicians continuing to support the police in the difficult job they do, but that has not always been the case, has it?… I’m not hugely impressed with politicians using strong phrases to show that they’re in charge of the situation.\n\nPointing at phrases the PM himself has used over the last week, the former Met boss listed off examples: ‘Standing army, “ramping up” the CGS, full force of the law…’\n\nHe went on:\n\nI rather think communities expect the full force of the law to be used against thugs irrespective of who’s motivating them. All the thugs on the streets who are causing this damage – and I include all the thugs, people who have used fictitious banners of protecting communities to go out and cause damage – all of them need to face the full force of the law.\n\nBlasting the ‘ugly face of racism’ for the violence on the streets, Stephenson added: ‘Racism isn’t confined to right or left… Most of the thugs involved in this couldn’t spell “right” or “left”, let alone think politically.’ Don’t hold back…\n\nIt’s more tough talk aimed at a Prime Minister barely a month into the top job. With his opponents slamming him for having ‘dithered and delayed’ over the last week, the pressure on Sir Keir to sort things out quick is only increasing…"
