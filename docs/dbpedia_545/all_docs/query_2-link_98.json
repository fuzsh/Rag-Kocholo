        "text": "The acting commissioner was unveiled as Britain's most senior police officer by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and London mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nThis morning's announcement marks the end of a race to head Scotland Yard that began with the resignation of Sir Ian Blair last October.\n\nSpeaking after the Home Secretary made the announcement, Sir Paul Stephenson said: \"I am such a hugely proud policeman today, to be asked to lead the Met in bringing safety to millions of Londoners, millions of visitors and lead the Met's national efforts.\n\n\"I am just enormously proud and I understand the challenge that awaits me.\n\n\"I think my job in the coming years is clear.\n\n\"I think what we have to do is ensure that we continue to cut crime and deal with crime.\n\n\"We've got to convince all the communities of London that we are on their side and doing what they want us to do.\n\n\"We have to be intolerant to violence, no matter where that violence comes from.\n\n\"We just simply have to make sure that we are delivering; that's our job, and it's my job to lead that delivery.\n\n\"I'm hugely confident of the ability of the Met to do it, maintain what we do well and make a lot of improvements in the process, and I'm just looking forward to the challenge.\n\n\"I'd just like to thank the people who have appointed me and shown the faith that they have in me. So thank you Home Secretary and thank you Mayor.\"\n\nMeanwhile Liberal Democrat Home Affairs and London spokesman, Tom Brake, said: \"I congratulate Sir Paul Stephenson on his new position.\n\n\"He will have to face tough challenges such as knife crime, on terrorism and the security for the Olympics.\n\n\"I am sure that his experience and his previous achievements in terms of tackling terrorism will be a clear advantage for the Met.\n\n\"The fact he was part of Sir Ian Blair’s old regime won’t count against him. Providing policing and not politics remain his priority.\""
