        "text": "Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, a former Chief Constable of Lancashire, resigned tonight.\n\nIt comes hours after News of the World former editor Rebekah Brooks was arrested at a London police station.\n\nSir Paul, who was born in Bacup, joined a growing list of victims of the controversy, including ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson, News Corp veteran Les Hinton, former News International chief executive Ms Brooks and the 168-year-old News of the World.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation, Sir Paul said: \"I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level and in particular in relation to Mr Neil Wallis, who as you know was arrested in connection with Operation Weeting last week.\"\n\nSir Paul insisted his integrity was intact despite pressure on him intensifying this weekend after it emerged he accepted thousands of pounds-worth of free accommodation at a luxury health spa.\n\nThe commissioner had already been under fire for hiring Mr Wallis as a PR consultant before the former tabloid executive was arrested for alleged mobile phone interception.\n\nBut, issuing his statement at Scotland Yard, he said: \"Let me state clearly, I and the people who know me know that my integrity is completely intact. I may wish we had done some things differently, but I will not lose sleep over my personal integrity.\"\n\nSir Paul said he had told Buckingham Palace, Home Secretary Theresa May and London mayor Boris Johnson about his decision.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said Ms May told Sir Paul she was \"sorry\" that he was resigning when he called to inform her of his decision.\n\nAnnouncing his departure, Sir Paul said he wanted \"to put the record straight\" over his relationship with Mr Wallis.\n\nHe said that when he met Mr Wallis in 2006 he had no knowledge of the original investigation into News of the World hacking that was taking place at the time."
