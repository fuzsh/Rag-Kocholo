        "text": "Vestavia Hills has a council-manager form of government in which the Council’s role is policy-making and considering those actions which require council approval. Daily operations of the City are the responsibility of the city manager. The Mayor and the four members of the Vestavia Hills City Council are elected at-large, meaning that each represents all residents of Vestavia Hills rather than those of a particular geographic area. Therefore, the Mayor and/or any member of the Council may address any issue, regardless of area.\n\nThe City Council typically meets monthly on the second and fourth Mondays with a work session typically held on the third Monday. Meetings and work sessions begin at 6pm and are open to the public, although comment may only be made at the invitation of the Mayor. Schedule changes may occur due to holidays, emergency closures, etc. For more information, contact City Clerk Rebecca Leavings at rleavings@vhal.org or 205.978.0131.\n\nThe City Council’s primary objective is to shepherd an environment that builds a strong economic base, a superior school system, an unsurpassed quality of life, and a moral character beyond reproach.\n\n– Ashley C.
