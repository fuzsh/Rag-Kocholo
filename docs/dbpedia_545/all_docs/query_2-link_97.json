        "text": "Former commissioner, Metropolitan Police\n\nBritain's top cop resigned on July 17, 2011, over mounting speculation about his links to Neil Wallis, former deputy editor of the News of the World. Police probing the phone-hacking scandal arrested Wallis on July 14, and it emerged that Stephenson had hired Wallis as a part-time p.r. consultant, paying him more than Â£1,000 ($1,600) per day. Stephenson used his resignation speech to turn on David Cameron, suggesting that the Prime Minister risked being \"compromised\" by his close relationship with Andy Coulson, the tabloid's former editor. Unlike Coulson, whom Cameron employed as his communications chief, Wallis did not resign from the News of the World following outside pressure and was not associated with the 2006 phone-hacking investigation.\n\nSee \"Bobby on the Tweet: British Police Try Twitter.\""
