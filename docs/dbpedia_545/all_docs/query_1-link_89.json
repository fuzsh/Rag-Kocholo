        "text": "‘’Come on, let’s be having me’’\n\nIN THE latest update of My Fair Lady – remaindered brand Rupert the Bare Murdoch as Professor Higgins, and Rebekah Brooks as Eliza Doolittle – attention has switched to a time-tested sub-plot, in which, on the stroke of midnight, the French windows from the tennis court burst open and a groveling retainer declares: “But this is late inspector.”\n\nLate indeed.\n\nBut it’s no ordinary plod. It’s none other than Sir Paul Stephenson, ex-assistant chief constable of Merseyside (1994-99), now Scotland Yard Commissioner, here to tell us why he is quitting his £250,000 a year job as Britain’s top cop.\n\nObviously not because he couldn’t afford £12,000 for a five-week stay at a luxury spa.\n\nBut more because it was free, given by a company which employed a former News of the World deputy editor to do its PR: The same guy now arrested for hacking allegations and whom Sir Paul had already hired as a police consultant.\n\nStephenson – known to his friends as ‘Rusty’ because of his near-permanent tan – may have been a straight-talking, personable officer – “a good bloke to have a chat with” as one of my ECHO colleagues put it.\n\nBut, like our dear prime minister, Silverspoon Cameron, who, reportedly “does not like bad news,” Sir Paul has been too late with the ritual washing of hands.\n\nAnd, again like the PM, he has demonstrated as much foresight as a hedgehog about to cross a motorway.\n\nThe time is nigh to find a new London police chief, and heading the field is former Merseyside chief constable Bernard Hogan-Howe (2004-9), who, although unsuccessful in getting the top job in Northern Ireland, or in becoming commissioner at the Met, was announced yesterday as the man chosen to lead the inquiry into the Met’s of the phone hacking scandal.\n\nAnother strong contender is his Merseyside predecessor Norman Bettison, currently running West Yorkshire police.\n\nWhoever gets the job has to oversee the Olympics, as well as the ever-present threat of terrorism, plus mend the ruptured relationship between Scotland Yard and parliament.\n\nAll part of the Murdoch maelstrom rapidly claiming more heads than the French Revolution."
