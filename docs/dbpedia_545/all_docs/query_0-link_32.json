        "text": "Four police officers who were \"branded abusive thugs\" for the way they arrested terror suspect Babar Ahmad have won the right to seek damages.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled the officers can sue the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.\n\nThey accused the Met of \"letting them down badly\" by not defending them against claims they beat Mr Ahmad.\n\nIn March 2009 the Met paid Â£60,000 to Mr Ahmad after admitting he had been subjected to an attack.\n\nThe Met initially denied Mr Ahmad's claim that he was punched, kicked and throttled during his December 2003 arrest.\n\nHowever, lawyers for the then commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson admitted at the High Court that Mr Ahmad had been the victim of \"gratuitous and sustained violence\" at his home in Tooting, south-west London.\n\nIn 2011 the four officers - PCs Rod James-Bowen, Nigel Cowley, Mark Jones and Det Con John Donohue - were charged over the assault, but were later acquitted."
