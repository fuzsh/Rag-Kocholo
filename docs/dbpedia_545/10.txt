ACPO president Sir Hugh Orde said:

"The resignation of Sir Paul Stephenson comes as a matter of huge regret to the service. He is man of integrity and it is a great sadness that he has felt the need to step down as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service.

"Throughout his time in the service, as Commissioner and in other roles, Sir Paul made an outstanding contribution to national policing, leading and developing work in areas including serious and organised crime, counter terrorism and neighbourhood policing. I've known Sir Paul since 1982 and he is one of the finest officers I have worked with.

"He has made clear he intends that this decision should ensure there are no distractions to the business of keeping the capital safe in a critical period for London. He has taken this step entirely in keeping with the unswerving commitment to the best interests of Londoners that he has shown throughout his leadership."
