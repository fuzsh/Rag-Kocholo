A nuclear power plant is basically a thermal power plant in which the heat source is an ongoing atomic fission reaction. A coolant removes the released heat and in a steam generator this heat is transferred to water in a secondary circuit where steam is generated. This steam powers a steam turbine that drives a generator to generate electricity.

Primary Circuit and Steam Generator

Secondary Circuit, Turbine and Generator

The secondary circuit and other related components are not part of the nuclear side of a nuclear power plant. Their functionality is identical to that of all thermal power plants. Steam generated in the secondary circuit is supplied to a turbine that may be up to 70 meters long and contain several stages. The first one is the high-pressure stage that is driven directly by the steam generated in the steam generator. After the steam passes through the high-pressure stage, it is pre-heated and supplied to a low-pressure stage (or possibly a medium-pressure stage) that has longer blades. The turbine spins at a speed of 3,000 rpm and drives a generator that generates the electricity.

The largest turbine in the world is the Arabelle that operates in the French nuclear power plant Chooz-B and has a power output of 1,500 MW.

Cooling

A nuclear power plant requires 3,000 liters of cooling water to produce1 MWh.

The power plantâ€™s tertiary circuit provides steam condensation at the turbine output. Condensation heat is removed through the cooling towers into the atmosphere.

Power Plant Power Output

There are three different ways to express the power output of a nuclear power plant:
