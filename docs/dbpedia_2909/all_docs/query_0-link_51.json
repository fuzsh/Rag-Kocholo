        "text": "Polar cranes, or reactor building cranes, serve essential roles in fuel assembly operations, reactor head removal and replacement, and versatile lifting requirements that cater to a range of maintenance and operational tasks with the utmost quality and safety. Operating on a circular runway, polar cranes are designed for heavy lifts and primarily used for reactor head removal and replacement as well as facilitating refueling outages.\n\nPAR has designed and built polar cranes that perform plant maintenance and operational functions from the dawn of the nuclear era. Our designs improve personnel safety, productivity, and reliability of the plant through custom tailored features for the application, safety mechanisms and precision positioning in a single failure proof design.\n\nNuclear cask handling cranes, also known as spent fuel handling cranes, are specialized lifting devices used in the nuclear industry to handle and transport heavy casks containing spent nuclear fuel or other radioactive materials.\n\nPAR has experience designing and building custom cask handling cranes to ensure the safety and efficient movement of nuclear casks throughout various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including storage, transportation, and disposal. We recognize the significance of effectively managing precise operations while prioritizing safety and dependability.\n\nFuel handling equipment is responsible for the loading and unloading of nuclear fuel into and out of the reactor core. PAR designs systems that transport fuel assemblies from storage to the reactor vessel and the precisely position and insert fuel assemblies into the core during refueling operations.\n\nOur systems ensure safe and efficient handling of nuclear fuel, including precise positioning and insertion of fuel assemblies, transfer to storage pools or dry cask storage systems, repairs or replacements, and separation of reusable materials. Our fuel handling systems have proven to improve operational efficiency, minimize downtime during refueling, and optimize the availability of nuclear power plants and SMRs.\n\nImage courtesy of Southern Nuclear"
