        "text": "The Diablo Canyon Decommissioning Engagement Panel will review information and provide direct input on behalf of the local community to PG&E on Diablo Canyon Power Plant decommissioning plans and activities.\n\nThe Panel will help inform PG&E’s site-specific decommissioning plan on future land use and repurposing recommendations. The consideration of the plan will be the subject of an ongoing regulatory process that will begin with the filing of the Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding in December 2018 at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). PG&E plans, pending CPUC approval, to continue to engage with the panel and solicit input from the public on its plan during this multi-year review process.\n\nThe Panel's Strategic Vision is a stand-alone document that is available to the community, stakeholders and regulatory agencies to provide information about the decommissioning process and recommendations from the Panel that reflect the community’s wishes for what will occur before, during and after decommissioning. Read the Strategic Vision.\n\nNew and extensive scientific re-evaluations performed at the direction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) continue to show that Diablo Canyon can safely withstand earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding that could potentially occur in the region.\n\nThis updated seismic evaluation provides additional confirmation the plant is designed to withstand the ground motions, or shaking, from earthquakes. As recently as 2019, the NRC determined that no plant systems, structures, and components important to safety were in need of updating to protect against earthquakes.\n\nPG&E's flooding hazard re-evaluation determined that the plant's key safety systems and components continue to be safe from tsunamis, including those generated from underwater landslides and earthquakes.\n\nAs part of its response to the Fukushima event in Japan in 2011, the NRC directed all U.S. commercial nuclear power plants to perform a reassessment of the potential seismic and flooding hazards to their facilities.\n\nThe seismic hazard analysis was performed using an NRC-mandated process known as the Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee, or SSHAC. Under the SSHAC process, existing and new seismic information was peer-reviewed and publicly evaluated by leading third-party, independent seismic experts.\n\nThe flooding hazard re-evaluation involved the use of the latest NRC guidance and methodologies and independent expertise to determine the maximum potential waves and rainfall that could impact Diablo Canyon. It also examined the plant's ability to withstand storm flooding.\n\nThe updated seismic assessment represents a more extensive evaluation of the seismic hazard than previously performed. Prior evaluations determined the ground shaking from an earthquake on a particular fault in the region, based on historical records and geological evidence, and then compared this information against structures, systems and components at the facility to ensure they could withstand seismic ground shaking.\n\nUsing the NRC's SSHAC process, independent seismic experts publicly re-evaluated existing and new seismic information, including data acquired during the advanced seismic studies recently performed near Diablo Canyon, to re-evaluate how earthquakes could potentially impact the facility.\n\nThis process included examining the probability of earthquakes occurring on individual and multiple geologic faults. The result is a more thorough assessment of the seismic hazard, providing additional confirmation that the plant is seismically safe.\n\nPG&E's flooding and tsunami hazard update involved the use of the latest NRC guidance and methodologies to determine the maximum potential waves and rainfall that could impact Diablo Canyon.\n\nThe re-evaluation, utilizing independent expertise, determined that the plant's key safety systems and components continue to be safe from tsunamis, including those generated from underwater landslides and earthquakes.\n\nThe plant's design is also deemed appropriate to withstand expected storm flooding. In addition, measures were identified and implemented to address a rare, theoretical event of excessive rainfall and a quick build-up of water in some plant locations that greatly exceeds any known precipitation event recorded in the site's history."
