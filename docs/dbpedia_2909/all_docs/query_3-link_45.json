        "text": "What is nuclear energy?\n\nNuclear energy is energy released when the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei. This reaction is called nuclear fission. Incidentally, when an atom splits and releases smaller neutrons, they will hit surrounding atoms and generate additional neutrons. More and more energy is released throughout this chain reaction. We can use all this nuclear energy to produce electricity safely, reliably and on a large scale.\n\nInside Alabama Power's Plant Farley\n\nAlabama Power's Plant Farley, located near Dothan, runs off of uranium fuel pellets. Through the process of fission, nuclear fuel is used to heat water into steam, which ultimately turns the turbine and creates electricity for the grid. One uranium fuel pellet, roughly the size of a pencil eraser, produces as much emission-free energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal or 149 gallons of oil. Because of the energy packed into nuclear fuel, nuclear power plants can run for 12-to-18 months straight without being taken offline for refueling, which means they’re producing electricity 24/7, 365 days a year. Combine that with the fact that nuclear plants are also among the safest structures in the country – designed to withstand major weather events and threats – and it’s easy to see why nuclear power is one of America’s most reliable energy sources.\n\nJoseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant\n\nAt Alabama Power, we have one operating nuclear power plant. The Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, located near Dothan in southeast Alabama, is responsible for generating 18% of Alabama Power’s total electricity. Our diverse mix of power sources makes our grid more flexible, resilient and stable in times of increased demand.\n\nAt Plant Farley, operated by Southern Nuclear Operating Company, each unit is capable of generating 900 megawatts of electricity, making up a total capacity of 1,800 megawatts. Starting in 1977, Plant Farley has generated more than 350 million megawatts. That's enough electricity to supply every Alabama Power residential customer for 25 years."
