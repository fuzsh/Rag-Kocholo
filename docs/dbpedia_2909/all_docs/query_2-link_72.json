Helping to power, protect and connect the modern world.\n\nAbout\n\nCreate your future with us\n\nHelp us deliver better power for our changing world.\n\nDoing more with less\n\nWe have a fundamental role in meeting the environmental and societal opportunities and challenges that the world faces.\n\nSustainability\n\nRolls-Royce Half Year results\n\nRolls-Royce announced Half Year results on Thursday 1 August 2024.\n\nView Press release\n\nNews centre\n\nUpdates and news from around the Rolls-Royce businesses.\n\nSign up to get the latest news\n\nWe are faced with an unprecedented demand for clean energy as global markets seek solutions to support their journey to net zero. The demand is for energy that is always on and which generates virtually no emissions.\n\nNuclear energy is the most powerful source of ‘always on’ clean energy, however, it must be deliverable, scalable and cost competitive for it to be widely embraced. Rolls-Royce SMR Ltd has designed a factory built nuclear power plant that will offer clean, affordable energy for all.\n\nWith the Rolls-Royce SMR technology, we have developed a clean energy solution which can deliver cost competitive and scalable net zero power for multiple applications - from grid and industrial electricity production to hydrogen and synthetic fuel manufacturing.\n\nFind out more at www.Rolls-Royce-SMR.com\n\nRolls-Royce SMR is a low-cost clean energy solution, using proven and commercially available technology to deliver a fully integrated, factory built nuclear power plant.\n\nWith a relentless focus on modularisation, and maximising the amount of work conducted under factory conditions, we are able to revolutionise how nuclear power gets delivered.\n\nThe need for clean energy has created a global demand for our SMR as countries look for ways to provide reliable ways to achieve net zero. Our SMR has been designed in direct response to that enormous global challenge and our ambitions are set to match that global market as we look to build a world class global product.\n\nBy design, our SMR is focused on attracting all forms of private capital to support the build out of global SMR demand. With a proven factory built commoditised approach, our SMR will offer investors and lenders a degree of confidence that will enable future customers to access a range of capital options to finance their SMR purchase.\n\nFor nuclear energy to play a meaningful and more significant role in our net zero ambitions, it must be financeable without the need for Government intervention in the long term.\n\nA Rolls-Royce SMR power station will have the capacity to generate 470MW of low carbon energy, equivalent to more than 150 onshore wind turbines. It will provide consistent baseload generation for at least 60 years, helping to support the roll-out of renewable generation.\n\nIn addition to stable base load power, Rolls-Royce SMRs will be able to provide energy for the net zero manufacture of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels to support the decarbonisation of transport.\n\nIt will occupy approximately one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear generation site, helping to reduce local environmental impacts. Rolls-Royce SMR will be factory built, enabling completed modules to be transported by truck, train or barge, reducing vehicle movements and completion risk and increasing build time certainty."
