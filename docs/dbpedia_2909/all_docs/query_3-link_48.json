        "text": "The pellets are aligned in linear arrays (fuel rods) that are interspersed with moveable control rods. The control rods act to dampen (or to stop) the the nuclear reactions so that the nuclear reactions do not get out of control or to service the reactor (ie. fuel rod change outs). The whole assembly (reactor core) is submerged in water to help keep the core cool. A power plant similar to Comanche Peak (photo above), might have as many as 13 million pellets in the reactor at a time, and they stay there for 3 to 4 years. To optimize power production, between one third and a quarter of the fuel rods are changed out every 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe reactor vessel is housed first in a radiation shield liner and then in a containment structure. This double walled design is to make certain that communities are safe from radiation leaks (unlike old Soviet style reactors). Containment structures (the large domes in the photo from Comanche Peak) are designed to withstand the impact of a large passenger planes and other possible major accidents/attacks.\n\nTypes of Reactors\n\nNuclear fission produces heat, and this heat is used to heat water and make steam. The steam powers turbines which turn generators. The generators produce electricity. Nuclear power generates electricity much like coal- or diesel-powered plants. What is different from the other two, is that nuclear doesn't produce greenhouse gases like the burning of fossil fuels. It does produce spent nuclear fuel that is radioactive, and this has disposal problems. Go to the page, Why Nuclear? for a discussion of the pros and cons of nuclear energy.\n\nThe two main types of reactors in use today are the pressurized (PWR) and boiling water (BWR) reactors. In the pressurized water reactor the water is heated by the nuclear reactions, but because the water is pressurized, it doesn't boil. The water in the reactor heats the water in the steam generator side, but it is on a different loop so they do not mix. In the boiling water reactor, the water comes to a boil due to the heat produced by nuclear fission. The water from the reactor powers the turbine. In both systems, the water is reused.\n\nThe Future of Nuclear Energy\n\nThe future of nuclear energy depends on safe and efficient reactor designs. In the past, the United States took the approach of having a few reactor types, but every plant was basically unique. This means that personnel can not easily switch facilities without relearning the plant's design. France, on the other hand, started out with a basic plant design. While they have improve the design with newer technologies, it still means that there is a much shorter learning curve to get personnel familiar with a new plant.\n\nIn the U.S., the next major change in plant design will be Generation IV reactors:\n\nThermal Reactors\n\nThere are the three types of very high temperature reactors (thermal) of the six preliminary designs that have been approved. Generally, they have graphite cores, are helium-cooled and can reach temperatures of over 1000Â°C. Because of the high temperatures, these reactors are also capable of producing hydrogen in addition to electricity. Also they are safer because the are built to withstand very high temperatures making accidents less likely as well as the gas being less dangerous than water-cooled plants (where the water is able to absorb neutrons).\n\nLinks to more information\n\nAny mention or link regarding a product, organization, company, or trade name is for information only and does not imply endorsement by the Bureau, NMT, or the State of New Mexico (see more)."
