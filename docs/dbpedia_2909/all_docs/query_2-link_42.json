        "text": "SRS History Highlights\n\nThe Savannah River Site was constructed during the early 1950s to produce the basic materials used in the fabrication of nuclear weapons, primarily tritium and plutonium-239, in support of our nation's defense programs. Five reactors were built to produce these materials. Also built were a number of support facilities including two chemical separations plants, a heavy water extraction plant, a nuclear fuel and target fabrication facility, a tritium extraction facility and waste management facilities.\n\nIf you wish to view an in-depth history (1950-2000), please explore SRS at Fifty, our 50th anniversary book.\n\nBrowse by Era: 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s • 2000s • 2010s"
