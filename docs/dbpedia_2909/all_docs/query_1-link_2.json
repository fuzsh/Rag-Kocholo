        "text": "The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\n\nThe NRC regulates and oversees the civilian uses of nuclear materials in the United States by licensing facilities that possess, use, or dispose of nuclear materials; establishing standards; and inspecting licensed facilities. This includes nuclear power plants. The NRC is responsible for implementing the EPA established standards at the facilities they oversee.\n\nMost states have signed formal agreements with the NRC, providing the states regulatory responsibility over small quantities of special nuclear material. These states are known as Agreement States. The radioactive materials license can be issued either by the NRC or an Agreement State.\n\nThe NRC Agreement State Program\n\nThis webpage provides information about the NRC Agreement State program and lists links to additional information.\n\nHow the NRC Protects You\n\nThis webpage provides information about how the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates and inspects sites where radioactive materials are used.\n\nNuclear Reactors\n\nThis webpage contains links to information about the NRC’s role in the nuclear power industry.\n\nStudent’s Corner: Nuclear Energy\n\nThis webpage provides information for students about nuclear energy, radiation emergencies, radioactive waste and more.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\nThe EPA uses its authority from the Clean Air Act to set limits on the amount of radioactive material released into the air from nuclear power plants. Under the Atomic Energy Act, the EPA sets environmental standards for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, high-level wastes.\n\nEnvironmental Radiation Protection Standards for Nuclear Power Operations (40 CFR Part 190)\n\nThis webpage provides information on the EPA’s environmental radiation protection standards for nuclear power operations, including a summary of the rule, rule history, and a link to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for this rule.\n\nRadiation: Facts, Risks and Realities\n\nIn this booklet, you can read about radiation and its health risks. You can learn about natural radiation and radioactive material used in medicine and nuclear power.\n\nOverview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution\n\nThis webpage provides information about the Clean Air Act and how air is monitored to help protect the public.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\n\nFEMA evaluates state and local emergency response plans for areas around nuclear power plants.\n\nNuclear Power Plant Emergencies\n\nThis webpage provides information on nuclear power plants and potential nuclear emergencies.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n\nThe DOE has oversight responsibilities related to the advancement of domestic nuclear energy production and the management of radioactive waste produced as a byproduct of energy production.\n\nThe Office of Nuclear Energy’s primary mission is advance nuclear power as a resource capable of making major contributions in meeting the nation’s energy supply, environmental, and energy security needs.\n\nThe EIA, a branch of the DOE, collects, analyzes, and releases information about different energy sources. They have a role in educating the public about energy.\n\nNuclear Energy Sources\n\nThis webpage provides a background information about nuclear power as an energy source used in the United States. Links are provided to learn more about reactor technologies and nuclear facilities.\n\nNuclear & Uranium\n\nThis webpage provides links to information and data about how much electricity nuclear power plants in the United States generate.\n\nEnergy Kids\n\nThis webpage provides information on how uranium is used to produce electricity in nuclear power plants.\n\nThe States\n\nEach nuclear power plant must have an emergency response plan for incidents that occur on-site. State and local authorities have emergency response plans for incidents that could release radiological material outside the plant property. These emergency response plans are designed to work together. State and local authorities practice their emergency plans every two years at every commercial nuclear power plant."
