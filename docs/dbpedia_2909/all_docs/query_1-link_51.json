        "text": "Our Story\n\nSouthern Nuclear is a leader among the nationâ€™s nuclear energy operators, running six units for Alabama Power and Georgia Power. For more than 40 years, the company has operated nuclear energy facilities at the highest levels of safety and reliability, creating carbon-free electricity for millions of homes and businesses.\n\nView Our Facilities\n\nOur facilities are held to the highest standards by the federal government. We have multiple safety systems to protect the plant against unexpected events.\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n\nThe protection of our natural environment is among our highest priorities. Each facility is surrounded by thousands of acres of plants, wildlife and native plants. We are committed to being good stewards of our surroundings so that essential habitat components are maintained, and species can thrive. Each plant in the Southern Nuclear fleet has been certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council as a wildlife habitat. The council is a non-profit international organization dedicated to protecting and enhancing wildlife habitats.\n\nEfficient Technology\n\nOne uranium fuel pellet is about the size of a pencil eraser and creates as much energy as one ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Each nuclear reactor is fueled with over 14 million fuel pellets and is designed to operate continuously for up to two years without refueling."
