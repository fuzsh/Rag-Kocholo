        "text": "Evolving Nuclear Technology for a Changing Climate\n\nWhen Westinghouse powered up the world’s first pressurized water reactor (PWR) at Shippingport in 1957, not even the most forward-thinking nuclear engineer could have conceived the technology that drives our cutting-edge AP1000® PWR system or even our game-changing eVinci™ microreactor.\n\nToday, it’s equally difficult to imagine what nuclear technology will look like 50 or 60 years from now. Yet, one truth is sure to remain constant: Westinghouse will be there.\n\nToday, we supply our cutting-edge technology to nearly half the commercial nuclear power plants in operation today – and that’s just the beginning. We’re also providing complete development, licensing, engineering, project management, component manufacturing and start-up support for new plants in Korea, China and the United States, and facilities built on our technology are on drawing boards in the U.K., throughout Europe and in other parts of the world.\n\nWe’re also a global leader in technology transfer. Even as we explore the next generation of power plant design, we are successfully transferring our design and manufacturing capabilities to countries such as France, Japan and Korea. In fact, thanks in part to our technology transfer efforts, Korea has become completely self-reliant in the design and construction of its nuclear power plants.\n\nGiven its scope and implications for the future, the challenge of a changing climate is likely one the world will be facing for decades to come. We invite you to learn more about how new plant design, services and equipment from Westinghouse will be part of the solution to creating an energy-abundant, carbon-free future."
