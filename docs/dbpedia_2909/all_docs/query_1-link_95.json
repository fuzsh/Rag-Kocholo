        "text": "The modern “Atomic Age” is attributed to the age of discovery and developments in the field of nuclear fission. After India’s 3 stage Nuclear Power Program that was conceived soon after Independence to meet the security and energy demands, India commissioned its first Nuclear power plant in Tarapur, Maharashtra. Students preparing for the IAS Exam must be aware of this and topics related to it.\n\nA nuclear reactor, part of the Nuclear Plant is an important concept in Science & Technology which is part of General Studies paper-3 in the UPSC Syllabus. In this article, one can learn about the types and working of nuclear reactors. We have also mentioned topics that can be related to Nuclear Reactors for the UPSC 2022 Exam.\n\nCandidates can find similar articles about everything related to science and tech by visiting the UPSC Science and Technology page!\n\nThe following links will also be of immense help in preparing for the Science and Technology segment of the UPSC Exams:\n\nSolve Science and Technology UPSC Previous Year Question Papers\n\nStay updated with Current Affairs\n\nUPSC Science and Technology Decoded\n\nUPSC MCQs for Science and Technology\n\nDownload UPSC Notes PDF (Free)\n\nGeneral Science Preparation Strategy for UPSC\n\nTake the IAS Mock Tests\n\nDownload NCERT Notes for UPSC PDF (Free)\n\nWhat is a Nuclear Reactor?\n\nA nuclear reactor is the most important part of a nuclear power plant. It is where the nuclear chain reactions occur that produce energy by fission. The heat thus produced can be used to produce electricity.\n\nThe main purpose of a reactor is to contain and control the energy released. Uranium is used as the nuclear fuel in the reactors.\n\nThe heat produced by nuclear reactions is used to convert the water into steam, which is further converted into carbon-free electricity with the help of turbines.\n\nMain Components of a Nuclear Reactor\n\nThe main components of a nuclear reactor are listed below.\n\nThe Core: It contains all the fuel and generates the heat required for energy production.\n\nThe Coolant: It passes through the core, absorbing the heat and transferring into turbines.\n\nThe Turbine: Transfers energy into the mechanical form.\n\nThe Cooling Tower: It eliminates the excess heat that is not converted or transferred.\n\nNeutron Moderator: Moderators are used for reducing the speed of fast neutrons released from the fission reaction and making them capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction.\n\nUsually, water, solid graphite, and heavy water are used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.\n\nCommonly-used moderators include regular (light) water (in 74.8% of the world’s reactors), solid graphite (20% of reactors), heavy water (5% of reactors).\n\nThe Containment: The enveloping structure that separates the nuclear reactor from the surrounding environment.\n\nNeutron Poison: A neutron poison (also called a neutron absorber or a nuclear poison) is a substance with a large neutron absorption cross-section.\n\nTypes of Nuclear Reactor\n\nBased on various components and working principles of Nuclear Reactors, one can distinguish them into the following types discussed below. Even though all the commercial nuclear power reactors use Nuclear Fission, they can be classified into two categories based on the energy of neutrons that sustain the fission chain reaction.\n\nThermal Reactors\n\nThermal reactors (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or thermal neutrons to keep up the fission of their fuel.\n\nBoiling water reactors (BWR), Pressurized water reactors (PWR), and Heavy water reactors (HWR) operate with thermal neutrons.\n\nFast Neutron Reactors\n\nFast neutron reactors use fast neutrons to cause fission in their fuel.\n\nVery rare due to complexity and costs. They are more difficult to build and more expensive to operate.\n\nFast reactors have the potential to produce less radioactive waste because all fissile is fissionable with fast neutrons [fuel is highly enriched in fissile material].\n\nTypes of Nuclear Reactors\n\nLight Water Reactors (LWR)\n\nLWR is a type of Thermal Neutron Reactor.\n\nUses Normal Water instead of Heavy Water as its coolant and Neutron Moderator.\n\nBWR & PWR are Light Water Reactors.\n\nThe BWR drives the steam turbine when the reactor core heats the water converting it into steam. Example: Fukushima Daiichi, Japan.\n\nThe PWR drives the steam turbine in two stages.\n\nPressurized water has a higher boiling point. The reactor core heats the water without producing any steam in the core.\n\nThis pressurized hot water then exchanges heat with a secondary low-pressure water unit which turns into steam.\n\nThis steam drives the steam turbine.\n\nHeavy Water Reactors\n\nHWR is also a type of Thermal Neutron Reactor.\n\nUses Heavy Water (deuterium oxide D2O) as its coolant and Neutron Moderator.\n\nThe HWR follows the working principle of the Pressurized Water Reactor.\n\nEven though Heavy Water is very expensive, it allows the nuclear reactor to operate without any fuel enrichment due to the enhanced neutron economy.\n\nThis also allows the Nuclear reactor to use alternate fuel cycles.\n\nGas-Cooled Reactors\n\nBWR, LWR, HWR & PWR can’t operate at very high temperatures and thus don’t provide great thermal efficiency.\n\nIn Gas-Cooled reactors, gas is replaced as a coolant and that drives the turbine.\n\nThese reactors are called High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs).\n\nGases like Helium & Carbon-Dioxide are used as coolants.\n\nHTGRs provide high thermal efficiency (Upto 50%) as they can operate at high temperatures.\n\nHTGRs can have multiple applications other than power production which involve heat processes like hydrogen fuel cells, water desalination, oil refineries, etc.\n\nGas being, not the most efficient coolant, HTGRs need a highly- efficient back-up coolant.\n\nFast Reactors\n\nThe reactors discussed above use moderators that slow the high-energy (fast) neutrons down to low-energy (slow).\n\nFast reactors don’t use moderators and use Fast Neutrons.\n\nTo sustain the fission reaction by fast neutrons, the fission material needs to be highly enriched.\n\nUranium enrichment is very expensive thus making the use of Fast reactors uneconomical.\n\nNuclear Reactors in India\n\nThe list of the locations of the installed nuclear reactors in India is given below.\n\nRajasthan (Rawatbhata)\n\nTamil Nadu (Kudankulam; Kalpakkam)\n\nGujarat (Kakrapar)\n\nUttar Pradesh (Narora)\n\nKarnataka (Kaiga)\n\nMaharashtra (Tarapur)\n\nThere are about five other projects under construction.\n\nAlso, read about the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant\n\nNuclear Reactors – UPSC Science & Tech:- Download PDF Here\n\nUPSC Questions related to Nuclear Reactors\n\nQ1\n\nWhat was the objective behind formulating the Three Stages Nuclear Power Program?\n\nIndia has only 2% of the world’s uranium reserves, on the other hand, India has 25% of the world’s thorium reserves.\n\nSince India was not part of some of the international nuclear treaties, India was prevented from taking part in international trade in the nuclear field.\n\nIndia has a huge population and a growing economy, so to meet the energy demands, India had to rely heavily on imports of coal and crude oil.\n\nHence, India had to devise methodologies to be self-sufficient in meeting energy demands arising due to a burgeoning population and economy; the 3 stage Nuclear Power Program was one of the answers to it.\n\nQ2\n\nWhat is Critical Mass?\n\nA critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.\n\nThe critical mass of a fissionable material depends upon its nuclear properties, its density, its shape, its enrichment, its purity, its temperature, and its surroundings.\n\nWhen a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining, the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power, temperature, or neutron population.\n\nFor more articles and UPSC preparation material follow the links given in the table below:\n\nRelated Links\n\nIAS Eligibility Indian Intelligence Architecture: An Overview List of Indian Spacecraft for UPSC Science and Technology India’s Three Stage Nuclear Power Program Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Government Exams Difference Between WWW and Internet UPSC GS4 Structure and Syllabus Booklist for IAS Exam Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6 The gist of Rajya Sabha TV Artificial Intelligence UPSC Prelims Plan Best Optional Subjects for UPSC UPSC Syllabus"
