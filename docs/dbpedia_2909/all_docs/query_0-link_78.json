        "text": "After the Tsunami\n\nOn March 11, 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was badly damaged by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami. At the time, Units 4,5, and 6 were shut down for refueling and maintenance. Once the earthquake arrived at 2:46 p.m., the control rods of units 1, 2, and 4 were immediately submerged completely in their corresponding reactor vessels. Automatically, emergency generators came online to power electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami quickly flooded the emergency generators and cut power to the pumps that circulated coolant water through the reactors. High-temperature steam in the reactors reacted with zirconium alloy to produce hydrogen gas. The gas escaped into the containment building, and the mixture of hydrogen and air exploded. Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce the hydrogen pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental or uncontrolled events.\n\nWatch the video above (13:01 minutes) and answer the questions below. This video is quite technical. Please focus on the questions and don't become overwhelmed with the comprehensive explanation of the reactor design.\n\n1) What two natural disasters occurred prior to the Fukushima nuclear disaster? How many people lost their lives due to these natural disasters?\n\n2) How many reactors were producing energy before the explosion? How many reactors were unloading fuel? Lastly, how many reactors were shutdown?\n\n3) What type of reactors were used at this site (RBMK, PWR, BWR, or AP1000)? Does the United States use this type of reactor?\n\n4) Where was the spent fuel stored in the reactor? Note: The United States does not store spent fuel in this location of the reactor.\n\n5) When the earthquake hit, did the control rods work?\n\n6) If a reactor site loses power, they need a backup power supply to keep the reactor core cool. Did Fukushima eventually lose back-up power? What did this do to reactors 1-3?\n\n7) Several times, the NRC and IAEA told Fukushima that their sea walls were too low. How did this contribute to the loss of back-up power?\n\n8) Not having enough coolant, led to the production of hydrogen gas. What is the danger of having this gas inside the reactor core?\n\n9) To reduce the pressure of the core, workers at Fukushima vented the radioactive gas into the atmosphere (similar to Three-Mile Island situation). How else did this radiation affect the planet?\n\n10) Workers at Fukushima used seawater to cool the core. What is the problem with using this substance?\n\n11) Did the containment of the reactors hold?\n\n12) What is a cold shutdown? Has this been achieved yet?\n\n13) Do Japan force its citizens to man and then clean-up Fukushima? Do you think the people involved understood the hazards of radiation (unlike Chernobyl)?\n\n14) At Fukushima, there were two deaths at the reactor site due to the natural disaster. There have been no reported deaths due to the meltdowns. How does this differ from Chernobyl?"
