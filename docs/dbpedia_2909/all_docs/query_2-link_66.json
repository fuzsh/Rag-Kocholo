        "text": "Nuclear power reactors1 are fueled with uranium that is slightly enriched in the isotope uranium-235.2 This isotope is capable of sustaining a controlled nuclear chain reaction that is necessary for production of electrical energy. The chain reaction results in the production of neutrons that induce radioactivity in the fuel, cooling water, and structural components of the reactor.\n\nRadioactivity is induced primarily through processes involving the capture of neutrons by uranium atoms in the fuel. Fission occurs when the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom (and less commonly a uranium-238 atom) captures a neutron, becomes unstable, and splits into two and (infrequently) three3 lighter nuclei; these nuclei are referred to as fission products. Uranium fission produces a bimodal mass distribution of fission products shown in Figure D.1. The most common fission products have mass numbers around 90 and 137 (for example, strontium-90 and cesium-137).\n\nThe fission products produced in a nuclear power reactor span the periodic table. They include:\n\nNoble gases, for example, krypton-85 and xenon-133.\n\nHalogens, for example, iodide-131.\n\nFIGURE D.1Mass distributions resulting from fission of uranium-235 by thermal neutrons.\n\nAlkali metals, for example, cesium-137.\n\nAlkaline earth metals, for example, strontium-90.\n\nLess commonly, hydrogen-3, more commonly referred to as tritium (T), from ternary fission of uranium atoms.\n\nNeutron capture can also induce radioactivity through the transmutation of one chemical element into another. The transmutation process results in the emission of nuclear particles (e.g., protons) and radiation from the nucleus. Some transmutation reactions and products of significance in power reactors include the following:\n\nProduction of nitrogen-16 through the capture of a neutron by the nucleus of an oxygen atom: oxygen-16 + neutron â€”> nitrogen-16 + proton (abbreviated as 16O(n, p)16N). Nitrogen-16 has a short (7-second) half-life and is primarily a hazard to workers at nuclear plants.\n\nProduction of carbon-14 through the capture of neutrons by the nuclei of nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon atoms: 14N(n, p)14C; 13C(n, y)14C; 17O(n, a)14C.\n\nProduction of tritium (T) by the capture of a neutron by the nu-cleus of a boron atom: 10B(n,2a)T. This is an important reaction in pressurized-water reactors, which use boron in cooling water to control reactivity.\n\nProduction of tritium through capture of a neutron by a deuterium atom that is naturally present in the cooling water of a reactor.\n\nNeutron capture can also induce radioactivity through activation. The capture of a neutron excites the nucleus, which quickly decays to a less energetic state through the emission of radiation. Some activation reactions and products of significance in power reactors include the following:\n\nProduction of cobalt-60 from cobalt-59 through the reaction 59Co(n, y)60Co.\n\nProduction of iron-55 from iron-54 through the reaction 54Fe(n, y)55Fe.\n\nCobalt-60 and iron-55 are common activation products in the structural components of reactors.\n\nThe isotopes produced by these neutron capture processes are almost always radioactive. Their decay involves the emission of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, to produce both radioactive and nonradioactive decay products. A decay reaction of particular importance in nuclear power reactors is the following:\n\nThis reaction produces plutonium-239 by uranium-238 neutron capture followed by two beta decays."
