        "text": "Sandia will continue to develop and perform cutting-edge testing and analysis to support an integrated solution to storage, transportation, and disposal challenges, with consideration of multiple clients and stakeholders.\n\nAreas of focused research and development include:\n\nStorage research and development\n\nTransportation research and development\n\nStorage Research and Development\n\nSandia’s storage R&D is focused on the performance and integrity of spent fuel and canisters in dry cask storage systems (DCSSs). We perform R&D to support the development of the technical basis for the extended storage and transportation of commercial SNF. The products are peer-reviewed research reports to be used by policy and regulatory decision makers.\n\nSpent Fuel Integrity\n\nSandia, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) have a decades-long collaboration to obtain data on how SNF ages while in long-term storage. Data obtained from this collaboration is being used to develop aging management plans to mitigate potential changes to the spent fuel over time to better ensure that the fuel maintains its integrity for as long as needed.\n\nSandia plays a leadership role in the DOE/EPRI High Burnup Spent Fuel Confirmatory Data Project which has loaded and is storing a TN-32 dry cask with 32 high-burnup commercial spent fuel assemblies. This cask was loaded and is being stored using the same procedures and conditions that a typical cask would experience, except that 63 thermocouples were inserted into the cask to collect internal cask temperatures for at least ten years. After ten years of storage, it is planned that this cask will be opened, and the fuel rods will be examined to document changes in fuel integrity over years of storage. In the meantime, 25 spent fuel rods with similar make-up and burnup histories are being tested at PNNL, ORNL, and ANL to quantify and document the baseline mechanical integrity of these rods. Learnings to date show that temperatures within the cask did not ever get hot enough to cause radial hydride formation, the major cause of fuel embrittlement. Further, hot-cell and glove-box testing at PNNL, ORNL, and ANL, also has shown robust mechanical integrity.\n\nStorage System Integrity\n\nSandia performs R&D on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of canisters in DCSS. Sandia’s R&D evaluates the three concurrent conditions required to cause stress corrosion cracking.\n\n1. Susceptible Material\n\nWe are investigating the formation and effects of SCC by:\n\nEvaluating a stainless-steel canister’s internal stresses that may exist from the fabrication of the canister, particularly in and around welds and heat-affected zones, which are most susceptible to SCC\n\nEvaluating via sampling and analysis of dusts collected from the surface of in-service storage canisters, and by experimental testing of brine stabilities under canister surface conditions\n\nEvaluating typical weld samples\n\nEvaluating by characterizing weld residual stresses in a full diameter canister mockup, manufactured using identical procedures as in-service storage canister\n\n2. Aggressive Environment\n\nTo test the effects of aggressive environments, several utilities provided dust samples from loaded canisters currently in service. Chloride salts, which can cause SCC, were found on canisters near the ocean. Sandia is in the process of collecting additional samples to determine:\n\nDeposited salt compositions\n\nSalt loads and compositions as a function of canister surface location and surface temperature\n\nHow those salt compositions change in representative temperatures and humidities\n\nWhat environmental conditions are needed to support or stop corrosion and potential cracking\n\n3. Tensile Stress\n\nTo evaluate tensile stress, which leads to expansion of materials, we used a full-diameter canister manufactured using identical procedures as in-service storage canister. Work is ongoing to understand incubation, pitting, transition from pit to crack, then crack growth rate, as well as what conditions lead to corrosion stifling. Also, monitoring and aging management practices at storage sites will be important to confirm storage system performance during extended service.\n\nThermal Hydraulic Experiments and Analysis of Dry Cask Systems"
