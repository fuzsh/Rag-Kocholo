        "text": "Nuclear energy supplies about 10% of the world’s electricity and approximately 20% of the electricity in the United States. It also makes up 26[DD(GPc1] % of clean electricity produced globally and ~50% in the United States.\n\nA total of 32 countries worldwide are operating 413 nuclear reactors for electricity generation, with another 56 under construction. The average capacity of the world’s operating reactors is just under 900 MW.\n\nWith the high costs and construction times required for large nuclear plants, there is beginning to be a transition to smaller reactors called small modular reactors or SMRs. Generally speaking, SMRs have capacities between 20–300 MW."
