        "text": "Preface\n\nThis regulatory document sets out the expectations of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) concerning the design of new water-cooled nuclear power plants (NPPs or plants). It establishes a set of comprehensive design expectations that are risk-informed and align with accepted international codes and practices.\n\nThis document provides criteria pertaining to the safe design of new water-cooled NPPs, and offers examples of optimal design characteristics where applicable. All aspects of the design are taken into account, and multiple levels of defence are promoted in design considerations.\n\nTo the extent practicable, the guidance provided herein is technology-neutral with respect to water-cooled reactors.\n\nRD-337 represents the CNSC’s adoption of the principles set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in NS-R-1, Safety of Nuclear Plants: Design, and the adaptation of those principles to align with Canadian expectations. The scope of RD-337 goes beyond IAEA’s NS-R-1 to address the interfaces between NPP design and other topics, such as environmental protection, radiation protection, ageing, human factors, security, safeguards, transportation, and accident and emergency response planning.\n\nSimilar to NS-R-1, RD-337 considers all licensing phases, because information from the design process feeds into the processes for reviewing an application for a Licence to Construct an NPP, and other licence applications.\n\nNothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any applicant or licensee from requirements associated with conventional codes and standards. In particular, while RD-337 may assist a proponent in making a licence application, it is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence conditions.\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this regulatory document is to set out the expectations of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) with respect to the design of new water-cooled nuclear power plants (NPPs or plants).\n\n2.0 Scope\n\nThis document sets out CNSC expectations with respect to the design of new water-cooled NPPs, and provides examples of optimal design characteristics. All aspects of the design are taken into account, and multiple levels of defence are promoted in design considerations.\n\nThe information provided herein is intended to facilitate high quality design, and consistency with modern international codes and standards, for new water-cooled NPPs. It is recognized that specific technologies may use alternative approaches. If a design other than a water-cooled reactor is to be considered for licensing in Canada, the design is subject to the safety objectives, high level safety concepts and safety management expectations associated with this regulatory document. However, CNSC review of such a design will be undertaken on a case by case basis.\n\nConventional industrial safety is addressed only from a high-level perspective, with a focus on design considerations that are related to nuclear safety.\n\nTo the extent practicable, this document is technology-neutral with respect to water-cooled reactors, and includes direction concerning:\n\nEstablishing the safety goals and objectives for the design;\n\nUtilizing safety principles in the design;\n\nApplying safety management principles;\n\nDesigning systems, structures, and components;\n\nInterfacing engineering aspects, plant features, facility layout; and\n\nIntegrating safety assessments into the design process.\n\nTo a large degree, this document represents the CNSC’s adoption of the principles set forth in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) document NS-R-1, Safety of Nuclear Plants: Design, and the adaptation of those principles to align with Canadian practices. The scope of NS-R-1 has been expanded to address the interfaces between NPP design and other topics, such as environmental protection, radiation protection, ageing, human factors, security, safeguards, transportation, and accident and emergency response planning.\n\n3.0 Relevant Requirements\n\nThe provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and regulations that are relevant to this regulatory document include:\n\nSubsection 24(4) of the NSCA prohibits the Commission from issuing, renewing, amending or replacing a licence, unless “in the opinion of the Commission, the applicant (a) is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee to carry on; and (b) will, in carrying on that activity, makes adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed”;\n\nSubsection 24(5) of the NSCA authorizes the Commission to include in a licence any term or condition that the Commission considers necessary for the purposes of the NSCA;\n\nParagraph 3(1)(i) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations stipulates that an application for a licence shall contain, in addition to other information, “…a description and the results of any test, analysis or calculation performed to substantiate the information included in the application”;\n\nParagraph 12(1)(f) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations stipulates that every licensee shall, “…take all reasonable precautions to control the release of radioactive nuclear substances or hazardous substances within the site of the licensed activity and into the environment as a result of the licensed activity”;\n\nParagraph 5(i) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for a licence to construct a Class I nuclear facility shall contain, in addition to other information, information on, “…the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the nuclear facility…”;\n\nParagraph 6(h) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain, in addition to other information, information on, “…the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the operation and decommissioning of the nuclear facility…”;\n\nParagraph 7(f) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for a licence to decommission a Class I nuclear facility shall contain, in addition to other information, information on, “…the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from the decommissioning and the measures that will be taken to prevent or mitigate those effects”; and\n\nOther sections of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, as well as sections of the Radiation Protection Regulations and the Nuclear Security Regulations that pertain to the design of a new nuclear power plant.\n\n4.0 Safety Objectives and Concepts\n\n4.1 General Nuclear Safety Objective\n\nIn support of the NSCA and associated regulations, the CNSC endorses the objective established by the IAEA that NPPs be designed and operated in a manner that will protect individuals, society, and the environment from harm. This objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of effective defences against radiological hazards in NPPs.\n\nThe general nuclear safety objective is supported by two complementary safety objectives dealing with radiation protection and with the technical aspects of the design. The technical safety objective is interdependent with administrative and procedural measures that are taken to ensure defence against hazards due to ionizing radiation.\n\n4.1.1 Radiation Protection Objective\n\nThe radiation protection objective is to provide that during normal operation, or during anticipated operational occurrences, radiation exposures within the NPP or due to any planned release of radioactive material from the NPP are kept below prescribed limits and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).\n\nThe design provides for the mitigation of the radiological consequences of any accidents.\n\n4.1.2 Technical Safety Objectives\n\nThe technical safety objectives are to provide all reasonably practicable measures to prevent accidents in the NPP, and to mitigate the consequences of accidents if they do occur. This takes into account all possible accidents considered in the design, including those of very low probability.\n\nWith achievement of these objectives, any radiological consequences should be minor and below prescribed limits, and the likelihood of accidents with serious radiological consequences is expected to be extremely low.\n\n4.2 Application of the Technical Safety Objectives\n\nThe NSCA and the technical safety objectives provide the basis for the following criteria and goals:\n\nDose acceptance criteria for events within the design basis; and\n\nSafety goals for beyond design basis accidents.\n\nSafety analyses are performed to confirm that these criteria and goals are met, to demonstrate effectiveness of measures for preventing accidents, and mitigating radiological consequences of accidents if they do occur.\n\n4.2.1 Dose Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical groups who are most at risk, at or beyond the site boundary is calculated in the deterministic safety analysis for a period of 30 days after the analyzed event.\n\nThis dose is less than or equal to the dose acceptance criteria of:\n\n0.5 millisievert for any anticipated operational occurrence (AOO); or\n\n20 millisieverts for any design basis accident (DBA).\n\n4.2.2 Safety Goals\n\nQualitative Safety Goals\n\nA limit is placed on the societal risks posed by nuclear power plant operation. For this purpose, the following two qualitative safety goals have been established:\n\nIndividual members of the public are provided a level of protection from the consequences of nuclear power plant operation such that there is no significant additional risk to the life and health of individuals; and\n\nSocietal risks to life and health from nuclear power plant operation are comparable to or less than the risks of generating electricity by viable competing technologies, and should not significantly add to other societal risks.\n\nQuantitative Application of the Safety Goals\n\nFor practical application, quantitative safety goals are established to achieve the intent of the qualitative safety goals. The three quantitative safety goals are:\n\nCore damage frequency;\n\nSmall release frequency; and\n\nLarge release frequency.\n\nA core damage accident results from a postulated initiating event (PIE) followed by failure of one or more safety system(s) or safety support system(s). Core damage frequency is a measure of the plant’s accident preventive capabilities.\n\nSmall release frequency and large release frequency are measures of the plant’s accident mitigative capabilities. They also represent measures of risk to society and to the environment due to the operation of a nuclear power plant.\n\nCore Damage Frequency\n\nThe sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to significant core degradation is less than 10-5 per reactor year.\n\nSmall Release Frequency\n\nThe sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to a release to the environment of more than 1015 becquerel of iodine-131 is less than 10-5 per reactor year. A greater release may require temporary evacuation of the local population.\n\nLarge Release Frequency\n\nThe sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to a release to the environment of more than 1014 becquerel of cesium-137 is less than 10-6 per reactor year. A greater release may require long term relocation of the local population.\n\n4.2.3 Safety Analyses\n\nTo demonstrate achievement of the safety objectives, a comprehensive hazard analysis, a deterministic safety analysis, and a probabilistic safety assessment are carried out. These analyses identify all sources of exposure, in order to evaluate potential radiation doses to workers at the plant and to the public, and to evaluate potential effects on the environment.\n\nThe safety analyses examine plant performance for:\n\nNormal operation;\n\nAnticipated operational occurrences;\n\nDesign basis accidents; and\n\nBeyond design basis accidents (BDBAs), including event sequences that may lead to a severe accident.\n\nBased on these analyses, the capability of the design to withstand postulated initiating events (PIEs) and accidents can be confirmed, the effectiveness of the items important to safety can be demonstrated, and requirements for emergency response can be established. The results of the safety analyses are fed back into the design.\n\nThe safety analyses are discussed in further detail in Section 9.0.\n\n4.2.4 Accident Mitigation and Management\n\nThe design includes provisions to limit radiation exposure in normal operation and AOOs to ALARA levels, and to minimize the likelihood of an accident that could lead to the loss of normal control of the source of radiation. However, given that there is a remaining probability that an accident may occur, measures are taken to mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents.\n\nThis includes such measures as:\n\nConsideration of inherent safety features;\n\nIncorporation of engineered design features;\n\nEstablishment by the operating organization of on-site accident management procedures; and\n\nEstablishment of off-site intervention measures by appropriate authorities.\n\nThe design applies the principle that plant states that could result in high radiation doses or radioactive releases have a very low frequency of occurrence, and plant states with significant frequency of occurrence have only minimal, if any, potential radiological consequences.\n\n4.3 Safety Concepts\n\n4.3.1 Defence-in-depth\n\nThe concept of defence-in-depth is applied to all organizational, behavioural, and design-related safety and security activities to ensure that they are subject to overlapping provisions. With the defence-in-depth approach, if a failure were to occur it will be detected and compensation made, or it would be corrected.\n\nThis concept is applied throughout the design process and operation of the plant to provide a series of levels of defence aimed at preventing accidents, and ensuring appropriate protection in the event that prevention fails.\n\nThe design provides all five levels of defence during normal operation; however, some relaxations may be specified for certain shutdown states. These levels are introduced in general terms below, and are discussed in greater detail in subsection 6.1.\n\nLevel One\n\nThe aim of the first level of defence is to prevent deviations from normal operation, and to prevent failures of systems, structures, and components (SSCs).\n\nLevel Two\n\nThe aim of the second level of defence is to detect and intercept deviations from normal operation in order to prevent AOOs from escalating to accident conditions, and to return the plant to a state of normal operation.\n\nLevel Three\n\nThe aim of the third level of defence is to minimize the consequences of accidents by providing inherent safety features, fail-safe design, additional equipment, and mitigating procedures.\n\nLevel Four\n\nThe aim of the fourth level of defence is to ensure that radioactive releases caused by severe accidents are kept as low as practicable.\n\nLevel Five\n\nThe aim of the fifth level of defence is to mitigate the radiological consequences of potential releases of radioactive materials that may result from accident conditions.\n\n4.3.2 Consideration of Physical Barriers\n\nAn important aspect of implementing defence-in-depth in the NPP design is the provision of a series of physical barriers to confine radioactive material at specified locations.\n\n4.3.3 Operational Limits and Conditions\n\nOperational limits and conditions (OLCs) are the set of limits and conditions that can be monitored by or on behalf of the operator, and that can be controlled by the operator.\n\nThe OLCs are established to ensure that plants operate in accordance with design assumptions and intent (parameters and components), and include the limits within which the facility has been shown to be safe. The OLCs are documented in a manner that is readily accessible for control room personnel, with the roles and responsibilities clearly identified. Some OLCs may include combinations of automatic functions and actions by personnel.\n\nSafe operation depends on personnel as well as equipment. OLCs therefore typically include:\n\nControl system constraints and procedural constraints on important process variables;\n\nRequirements for normal operation and AOOs, including shutdown states;\n\nActions to be taken and limitations to be observed by operating personnel;\n\nPrincipal requirements for surveillance and corrective or compensatory actions; and\n\nThe limitations to be observed and the operational requirements to be met by SSCs in order that their intended functions, as assumed in the safety analysis, can be met.\n\nThe basis on which the OLCs are derived will be readily available in order to facilitate the ability of plant personnel to interpret, observe, and apply the OLCs.\n\n5.0 Safety Management During Design\n\nThe NPP design:\n\nMeets Canadian regulatory requirements;\n\nMeets the design specifications, as confirmed by safety analysis;\n\nTakes account of current safety practices;\n\nFulfills the requirements of an effective quality assurance program; and\n\nIncorporates only those design changes that have been justified by technical and safety assessments.\n\nThe design process is carried out by technically qualified and appropriately trained staff at all levels, and includes such management arrangements as:\n\nA clear division of responsibilities with corresponding lines of authority and communication;\n\nClear interfaces between the groups engaged in different parts of the design, and between designers, utilities, suppliers, builders, and contractors as appropriate;\n\nProcedures that align with an established quality assurance program; and\n\nA positive safety culture throughout all levels of the organization.\n\n5.1 Design Authority\n\nDuring the design phase, formal design authority typically rests with the organization that has overall responsibility for the design. Prior to plant start-up, this authority may be transferred to the operating organization.\n\nThe design authority may assign responsibility for the design of specific parts of the plant to other organizations, known as responsible designers. The tasks and functions of the design authority and any responsible designer need to be established in formal documentation; however, the overall responsibility remains with the design authority.\n\nThe applicant confirms that the design authority has achieved the following objectives during the design phase:\n\nEstablished a knowledge base of all relevant aspects of the plant design and kept it up-to-date, while taking experience and research findings into account;\n\nEnsured the availability of the design information that is needed for safe plant operation and maintenance;\n\nEstablished the requisite security clearances and associated security measures to protect prescribed, designated, and classified material;\n\nMaintained design configuration control;\n\nReviewed, verified, approved (or rejected), and documented design changes;\n\nEstablished and controlled the necessary interfaces with responsible designers or other suppliers engaged in design work;\n\nEnsured that the necessary engineering and scientific skills and knowledge have been maintained; and\n\nEnsured that, with respect to individual design changes or multiple changes that may have significant interdependencies, the associated impact on safety has been properly assessed and understood.\n\n5.2 Design Management\n\nAppropriate design management is expected to achieve the following objectives:\n\nSSCs important to safety meet their respective design requirements;\n\nDue account is taken of the human capabilities and limitations of personnel;\n\nSafety design information necessary for safe operation and maintenance of the plant and any subsequent plant modifications is preserved;\n\nOLCs are provided for incorporation into the plant administrative and operational procedures;\n\nThe plant design facilitates maintenance throughout the life of the plant;\n\nThe results of the deterministic and probabilistic safety assessments are taken into account;\n\nDue consideration is given to the prevention of accidents and mitigation of their consequences;\n\nGeneration of radioactive waste is limited to minimum practicable levels, in terms of both activity and volume;\n\nA change control process is established to track design changes to provide configuration management during construction, commissioning, and operation; and\n\nPhysical protection systems are provided to address design basis threats.\n\n5.3 Quality Assurance Program\n\nA quality assurance program is established as part of the overall management arrangements by which the plant will function to achieve objectives. With respect to the plant design, this includes identifying all performance and assessment parameters for the design, as well as detailed plans for each SSC to ensure consistent quality of the design and the selected components.\n\nThe quality assurance program is such that the initial design, and any subsequent change or safety improvement, is carried out in accordance with established procedures that call on appropriate standards and codes, and that incorporate applicable requirements and design bases. Appropriate quality assurance also facilitates identification and control of design interfaces.\n\nThe adequacy of the design, including design tools and design inputs and outputs, are verified or validated by individuals or groups that are independent from those who originally performed the work. Verifications, validations, and approvals are completed before the detailed design is implemented.\n\n5.4 Proven Engineering Practices\n\nThe design authority identifies the modern standards and codes that will be used for the plant design, and evaluates those standards and codes for applicability, adequacy, and sufficiency to the design of SSCs important to safety.\n\nWhere needed, codes and standards may be supplemented or modified to ensure that the final quality of the design is commensurate with the necessary safety functions.\n\nSSCs important to safety are of proven designs, and are designed according to the standards and codes identified for the NPP.\n\nWhere a new SSC design, feature, or engineering practice is introduced, adequate safety is proven by a combination of supporting research and development programs, and by examination of relevant experience from similar applications. An adequate qualification program is established to verify that the new design meets all applicable safety expectations. New designs are tested before being brought into service, and are then monitored in service to verify that the expected behaviour is achieved.\n\nThe design authority establishes an adequate qualification program to verify that the new design meets all applicable safety design requirements.\n\nIn the selection of equipment, due attention is given to spurious operation and to unsafe failure modes (e.g., failure to trip when necessary). Where the design has to accommodate an SSC failure, preference is given to equipment that exhibits known and predictable modes of failure, and that facilitates repair or replacement.\n\n5.5 Operational Experience and Safety Research\n\nThe NPP design draws on operational experience that has been gained in the nuclear industry, and on the results of relevant research programs.\n\n5.6 Safety Assessment\n\nSafety assessment is a systematic process applied throughout the design phase to ensure that the design meets all relevant safety requirements. This includes the requirements set by the operating organization and by regulatory authorities. The basis for the safety assessment is the data derived from the safety analysis, previous operational experience, results of supporting research, and proven engineering practices.\n\nThe safety assessment is part of the design process, with iteration between the design and analyses, and increases in scope and level of detail as the design process progresses.\n\nBefore the design is submitted, an independent peer review of the safety assessment is conducted by individuals or groups separate from those carrying out the design.\n\nSafety assessment documentation identifies those aspects of operation, maintenance, and management that are important to safety. This documentation is maintained in a dynamic suite of documents to reflect changes in design as the plant evolves.\n\nSafety assessment documentation is presented clearly and concisely, in a logical and understandable format, and will be made readily accessible to designers, operators, and the CNSC.\n\n5.7 Design Documentation\n\nThe design documentation includes the following information:\n\nDesign description;\n\nDesign requirements;\n\nSystem classifications;\n\nDescription of plant states;\n\nSecurity system design, including a description of physical security barriers;\n\nOperational limits and conditions;\n\nIdentification and categorization of initiating events;\n\nAcceptance criteria and derived acceptance criteria;\n\nDeterministic safety analysis;\n\nProbabilistic safety assessment (PSA); and\n\nHazards analysis.\n\n6.0 Safety Considerations\n\n6.1 Application of Defence-in-depth\n\nDefence-in-depth is achieved at the design phase through application of design provisions specific to the five levels of defence.\n\nLevel One\n\nAchievement of defence-in-depth level one calls for conservative design and high-quality construction to provide confidence that plant failures and deviations from normal operations are minimized and accidents are prevented.\n\nThis entails careful attention to selection of appropriate design codes and materials, design procedures, equipment qualification, control of component fabrication and plant construction, and use of operational experience.\n\nLevel Two\n\nDefence-in-depth level two is achieved by controlling plant behaviour during and following a PIE using both inherent and engineered design features to minimize or exclude uncontrolled transients to the extent possible.\n\nLevel Three\n\nAchievement of defence-in-depth level three calls for provision of inherent safety features, fail safe design, engineered design features, and procedures that minimize the consequences of DBAs. These provisions are capable of leading the plant first to a controlled state, and then to a safe shutdown state, and maintaining at least one barrier for the confinement of radioactive material. Automatic activation of the engineered design features minimizes the need for operator actions in the early phase of a DBA.\n\nLevel Four\n\nDefence-in-depth level four is achieved by providing equipment and procedures to manage accidents and mitigate their consequences as far as practicable.\n\nMost importantly, adequate protection is provided for the confinement function by way of a robust containment design. This includes the use of complementary design features to prevent accident progression and to mitigate the consequences of selected severe accidents. The confinement function is further protected by severe accident management procedures.\n\nLevel Five\n\nThe design provides an adequately equipped emergency support centre, and plans for on-site and off-site emergency response.\n\n6.1.1 Consideration of Physical Barriers\n\nTo ensure maintenance of the overall safety concept of defence-in-depth, the design provides multiple physical barriers to the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials to the environment. Such barriers include the fuel matrix, the fuel cladding, the reactor coolant pressure boundary, and the containment. In addition, the design provides for an exclusion zone.\n\nTo the extent practicable, the design therefore prevents:\n\nChallenges to the integrity of physical barriers;\n\nFailure of a barrier when challenged; and\n\nFailure of a barrier as a consequence of failure of another barrier.\n\nThe design also allows for the fact that the existence of multiple levels of defence is not a sufficient basis for continued power operation in the absence of one defence level.\n\n6.2 Safety Functions\n\nThe NPP design provides adequate means to:\n\nMaintain the plant in a normal operational state;\n\nEnsure the proper short-term response immediately following a PIE; and\n\nFacilitate the management of the plant in and following any DBA, and in accident conditions beyond DBAs.\n\nThe following fundamental safety functions are available in normal operation, and during and following AOOs and DBAs:\n\nControl of reactivity;\n\nRemoval of heat from the core;\n\nConfinement of radioactive material;\n\nControl of operational discharges and hazardous substances, as well as limitation of accidental releases; and\n\nMonitoring of safety critical parameters to guide operator actions.\n\nThe above functions also facilitate response to BDBAs to the extent practicable.\n\nSSCs necessary to fulfill safety functions following a PIE are identified. This approach identifies the need for such functions as reactor shutdown, emergency core cooling, containment, emergency heat removal, and power systems, etc.\n\n6.3 Accident Prevention and Plant Safety Characteristics\n\nThe design applies the principles of defence-in-depth to minimize sensitivity to PIEs. Following a PIE, the plant is rendered safe by:\n\nInherent safety features;\n\nPassive safety features, or action of control systems;\n\nAction of safety systems; or\n\nSpecified procedural actions.\n\n6.4 Radiation Protection and Acceptance Criteria\n\nAchievement of the general nuclear safety objective (discussed in subsection 4.1) depends on all actual and potential sources of radiation being identified, and on provision being made to ensure that sources are kept under strict technical and administrative control.\n\nRadiation doses to the public and to site personnel are to be as low as reasonably achievable. During normal operation, including maintenance and decommissioning, doses are regulated by the limits prescribed in the Radiation Protection Regulations.\n\nThe design includes provisions for the prevention and mitigation of radiation exposures resulting from DBAs and BDBAs.\n\nThe design also ensures that potential radiation doses to the public from AOOs and DBAs do not exceed dose acceptance criteria provided in subsection 4.2.1. The calculated overall risk to the public from all plant states meets the safety goals in subsection 4.2.2.\n\n6.5 Exclusion Zone\n\nThe design includes adequate provision for an appropriate exclusion zone. The appropriateness of the exclusion zone is based on several factors, including (without being limited to):\n\nEvacuation needs;\n\nLand usage needs;\n\nSecurity requirements; and\n\nEnvironmental factors.\n\n6.6 Facility Layout\n\nThe design takes into account the interfaces between the safety and security provisions of the NPP and other aspects of the facility layout, such as:\n\nAccess routes for normal operational actions and maintenance;\n\nAccess control to minimize radiation exposures;\n\nActions taken in response to internal or external events;\n\nEgress routes;\n\nMovement of hazardous substances, nuclear materials, and radioactive materials;\n\nMovement of authorized and unauthorized personnel; and\n\nInteraction of building and support functions.\n\nIt is likely that some design requirements associated with these factors will conflict with others in the determination of facility layout requirements. The design therefore reflects an assessment of options, demonstrating that an optimized configuration has been sought for the facility layout.\n\n7.0 General Design Considerations\n\n7.1 Classification of SSCs\n\nThe design authority classifies SSCs in a consistent and clearly defined classification scheme. The SSCs are then designed, constructed, and maintained such that their quality and reliability is commensurate with this classification.\n\nIn addition, all SSCs are identified as either important or not important to safety. The criteria for determining safety importance are based on:\n\nSafety function(s) to be performed;\n\nConsequence of failure;\n\nProbability that the SSC will be called upon to perform the safety function; and\n\nThe time following a PIE at which the SSC will be called upon to operate, and the expected duration of that operation.\n\nSSCs important to safety include:\n\nSafety systems;\n\nComplementary design features;\n\nSafety support systems; and\n\nOther SSCs whose failure may lead to safety concerns (e.g., process and control systems).\n\nThe design provides appropriately designed interfaces between SSCs of different classes to minimize the risk of an SSC less important to safety from adversely affecting the function or reliability of an SSC of greater importance.\n\n7.2 Plant Design Envelope\n\nThe design authority establishes the plant design envelope, which comprises the design basis and complementary design features.\n\nThe design basis specifies the capabilities that are necessary for the plant in normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs.\n\nConservative design measures and sound engineering practices are to be applied in the design basis for normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs. This provides a high degree of assurance that no significant damage will occur to the reactor core, and that radiation doses will remain within established limits.\n\nComplementary design features address the performance of the plant in BDBAs, including selected severe accidents.\n\n7.3 Plant States\n\nPlant states are grouped into the following four categories:\n\nNormal Operation-operation within specified OLCs, including start-up, power operation, shutting down, shutdown, maintenance, testing, and refuelling;\n\nAnticipated Operational Occurrence-a deviation from normal operation that is expected to occur once or several times during the operating lifetime of the NPP but which, in view of the appropriate design provisions, does not cause any significant damage to items important to safety, nor lead to accident conditions;\n\nDesign Basis Accidents-accident conditions for which an NPP is designed according to established design criteria, and for which damage to the fuel and the release of radioactive material are kept within regulated limits; and\n\nBeyond Design Basis Accidents-accident conditions less frequent and more severe than a design basis accident. A BDBA may or may not involve core degradation.\n\nAcceptance criteria are assigned to each plant state, taking into account the expectation that frequent PIEs will have only minor or no radiological consequences, and events that may result in severe consequences are of extremely low probability.\n\n7.3.1 Normal Operation\n\nThe design facilitates safe operation of the plant within a defined range of parameters, with an assumed availability of a minimum set of specified support features for safety systems.\n\nThe design minimizes the unavailability of safety systems. The design addresses the potential for accidents to occur when the availability of safety systems may be reduced, such as during shutdown, start-up, low power operation, refuelling, and maintenance.\n\nThe design establishes a set of requirements and limitations for safe normal operation, including:\n\nLimits important to safety;\n\nConstraints on control systems and procedures;\n\nPlant maintenance, testing, and inspection requirements to ensure that SSCs function as intended, taking the ALARA principle into consideration; and\n\nClearly defined operating configurations, such as start-up, power production, shutdown, maintenance, testing, surveillance, and refuelling-these configurations include relevant operational restrictions in the event of safety system and safety support system outages.\n\nThese requirements and limitations, together with the results of safety analysis, form the basis for establishing the OLCs according to which the plant will be authorized to operate, as discussed in subsection 4.3.3 of this document.\n\n7.3.2 Anticipated Operational Occurrences\n\nThe design includes provisions such that releases to the public following an AOO do not exceed the dose acceptance criteria.\n\nThe design also provides that, to the extent practicable, SSCs not involved in the initiation of an AOO will remain operable following the AOO.\n\nThe response of the plant to a wide range of AOOs allows safe operation or shutdown, if necessary, without the need to invoke provisions beyond defence-in-depth Level 1 or, at most, Level 2.\n\nThe facility layout is such that equipment is placed at the most suitable location to ensure its immediate availability when operator intervention is required, allowing for safe and timely access during an AOO.\n\n7.3.3 Design Basis Accidents\n\nThe set of design basis accidents sets the boundary conditions according to which SSCs important to safety are designed.\n\nThe design is such that releases to the public following a DBA will not exceed the dose acceptance criteria.\n\nIn order to prevent progression to a more severe condition that may threaten the next barrier, the design includes provision to automatically initiate the necessary safety systems where prompt and reliable action is required in response to a PIE.\n\nProvision is also made to support timely detection of, and manual response to, conditions where prompt action is not necessary. This includes such responses as manual initiation of systems or other operator actions.\n\nThe design takes into account operator actions that may be necessary to diagnose the state of the plant and to put it into a stable long-term shutdown condition in a timely manner. Such operator actions are facilitated by the provision of adequate instrumentation to monitor plant status, and controls for manual operation of equipment.\n\nAny equipment necessary for manual response and recovery processes is placed at the most suitable location to allow safe and timely worker access when needed.\n\n7.3.4 Beyond Design Basis Accidents\n\nThe design authority identifies credible BDBAs, based on operational experience, engineering judgment, and the results of analysis and research. This includes events leading to significant core degradation (severe accidents), particularly those events that challenge containment.\n\nComplementary design features are then considered with the goal of preventing identified BDBA scenarios, and mitigating their consequences if they do occur.\n\nComplementary design features include design or procedural considerations, or both, and are based on a combination of phenomenological models, engineering judgments, and probabilistic methods.\n\nThe design identifies the rules and practices that have been applied to the complementary design features. These rules and practices do not necessarily need to incorporate the same degree of conservatism as those applied to the design basis.\n\nThe design identifies a radiological and combustible gas accident source term for use in the specification of the complementary design features for BDBAs. This source term is referred to as the reference source term, and is based on a set of representative core damage accidents established by the design authority.\n\nIn the case of multi-unit plants, the use of available support from other units is relied upon only if it can be established that the safe operation of the other units is not compromised.\n\nTo the extent practicable, the design provides biological shielding of appropriate composition and thickness to protect operational personnel during BDBAs, including severe accidents.\n\nSevere Accidents\n\nThe design should be balanced such that no particular design feature or event makes a dominant contribution to the frequency of severe accidents, taking uncertainties into account.\n\nEarly in the design process, the various potential barriers to core degradation are identified, and features that can be incorporated to halt core degradation at those barriers are considered.\n\nThe design also identifies the equipment to be used in the management of severe accidents. A reasonable level of confidence that this equipment will perform as intended in the case of a severe accident is demonstrated by environmental, fire, and seismic assessments.\n\nParticular attention is placed on the prevention of potential containment bypass in accidents involving significant core degradation.\n\nConsideration is given to the plant’s full design capabilities, including the possible use of safety, non-safety, and temporary systems, beyond their originally intended function. This applies to any system that can be shown with a reasonable degree of assurance to be able to function in the environmental conditions expected during a severe accident.\n\nContainment maintains its role as a leak-tight barrier for a period that allows sufficient time for the implementation of off-site emergency procedures following the onset of core damage. Containment also prevents uncontrolled releases of radioactivity after this period.\n\nThe design authority establishes initial severe accident management guidelines, taking into account the plant design features and the understanding of accident progression and associated phenomena.\n\nThe design considers prevention of recriticality following severe accidents.\n\n7.4 Postulated Initiating Events Considered in the Design\n\nPostulated initiating events can lead to AOO or accident conditions, and include credible failures or malfunctions of SSCs, as well as operator errors, common-cause internal hazards, and external hazards.\n\n7.4.1 Internal Hazards\n\nSSCs important to safety are designed and located in a manner that minimizes the probability and effects of fires and explosions caused by external or internal events.\n\nThe plant design takes into account the potential for internal hazards, such as flooding, missile generation, pipe whip, jet impact, fire, smoke, and combustion by-products, or release of fluid from failed systems or from other installations on the site. Appropriate preventive and mitigation measures are provided to ensure that nuclear safety is not compromised.\n\nThe design considers the possible interaction of external and internal events, such as external events initiating internal fires or floods that may lead to the generation of missiles.\n\nWhere two fluid systems operating at different pressures are interconnected, failure of the interconnection is considered. Either both withstand the higher pressure, or provision is made so that the pressure of the system operating at the lower pressure will not be exceeded.\n\n7.4.2 External Hazards\n\nThe design considers all natural and human-induced external events that may be linked with significant radiological risk. The subset of external events that the plant is designed to withstand is selected, and design basis events are determined from this subset.\n\nVarious interactions between the plant and the environment, such as population in the surrounding area, meteorology, hydrology, geology and seismology are identified during the site evaluation and environmental assessment processes. These interactions are taken into account in determining the design basis for the NPP.\n\nApplicable natural external hazards include such events as earthquakes, droughts, floods, high winds, tornadoes, tsunami, and extreme meteorological conditions. Human-induced external events include those that are identified in the site evaluation, such as potential aircraft crashes, ship collisions, and terrorist activities.\n\n7.4.3 Combinations of Events\n\nCombinations of randomly occurring individual events that could credibly lead to AOOs, DBAs, or BDBAs are considered in the design. Such combinations are identified early in the design phase, and are confirmed using a systematic approach.\n\nEvents that may result from other events, such as a flood following an earthquake, are considered to be part of the original PIE.\n\n7.5 Design Rules and Limits\n\nThe design authority specifies the engineering design rules for all SSCs. These rules comply with appropriate accepted engineering practices.\n\nThe design also identifies SSCs to which design limits are applicable. These design limits are specified for normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs.\n\n7.6 Design for Reliability\n\nAll SSCs important to safety are designed with sufficient quality and reliability to meet the design limits. A reliability analysis is performed for each of these SSCs.\n\nWhere possible, the design provides for testing to demonstrate that these reliability requirements will be met during operation.\n\nThe safety systems and their support systems are designed to ensure that the probability of a safety system failure on demand from all causes is lower than 10-3.\n\nThe reliability model for each system uses realistic failure criteria and best estimate failure rates, considering the anticipated demand on the system from PIEs.\n\nDesign for reliability includes consideration of mission times for SSCs important to safety.\n\nThe design takes into account the availability of off-site services upon which the safety of the plant and protection of the public may depend, such as the electricity supply and external emergency response services.\n\n7.6.1 Common-cause Failures\n\nFailure of a number of devices or components to perform their functions may occur as a result of a single specific event or cause. Common-cause failures may also occur when multiple components of the same type fail at the same time. This may be caused by such occurrences as a change in ambient conditions, saturation of signals, repeated maintenance error or design deficiency.\n\nThe potential for common-cause failures of items important to safety is considered in determining where to apply the principles of diversity, separation, and independence to achieve the necessary reliability. Such failures may simultaneously affect a number of different items important to safety. The event or cause may be a design deficiency, a manufacturing deficiency, an operating or maintenance error, a natural phenomenon, a human-induced event, or an unintended cascading effect from any other operation or failure within the plant.\n\nThe design provides sufficient physical separation between redundant divisions of safety support systems and process systems. This applies to equipment and to routing of the following items:\n\nElectrical cables for power and control of equipment;\n\nPiping for service water for the cooling of fuel and process equipment; and\n\nTubing and piping for compressed air or hydraulic drives for control equipment.\n\nWhere physical separation is not possible, safety support system equipment may share physical space. In such cases, the reasons for the lack of separation and justification for the space sharing arrangement is explained in the design documentation.\n\nWhere space sharing is necessary, services for safety and for other important process systems are arranged in a manner that incorporates the following considerations:\n\nA safety system designed to act as backup is not located in the same space as the primary safety system; and\n\nIf a safety system and a process system must share space, then the associated safety functions are also provided by another safety system to counter the possibility of failures in the process system.\n\nThe design provides effective protection against common-cause events where sufficient physical separation among individual services or groups of services does not exist. The design authority assesses the effectiveness of specified physical separation or protective measures against common-cause events.\n\nDiversity is applied to redundant systems or components that perform the same safety function by incorporating different attributes into the systems or components. Such attributes include different principles of operation, different physical variables, different conditions of operation, or production by different manufacturers.\n\nIt is important that any diversity used actually achieves the desired increase in reliability. For example, to reduce the potential for common-cause failures, the application of diversity is examined for any similarity in materials, components, and manufacturing processes, or subtle similarities in operating principles or common support features. If diverse components or systems are used, there should be a reasonable assurance that such additions are of overall benefit, taking into account associated disadvantages such as the extra complication in operational, maintenance, and test procedures, or the consequent use of equipment of lower reliability.\n\n7.6.2 Single Failure Criterion\n\nAll safety groups function in the presence of a single failure. The single failure criterion requires that each safety group perform all safety functions required for a PIE in the presence of any single component failure, and:\n\nAll failures caused by that single failure;\n\nAll identifiable but non-detectable failures, including those in the non-tested components; and\n\nAll failures and spurious system actions that cause (or are caused by) the PIE.\n\nEach safety group is able to perform the required safety functions under the worst permissible systems configuration, taking into account such considerations as maintenance, testing, inspection and repair, and equipment outage.\n\nAnalysis of all possible single failures, and all associated consequential failures, is conducted for each element of each safety group until all safety groups have been considered.\n\nUnintended actions and failure of passive components are considered as two of the modes of failure of a safety group.\n\nThe single failure is assumed to occur prior to the PIE, or at any time during the mission time for which the safety group is required to function following the PIE. Passive components may be exempt from this expectation.\n\nExemptions for passive components apply only to those components that are designed and manufactured to high standards of quality, that are adequately inspected and maintained in service, and that remain unaffected by the PIE. Design documentation includes analytical justification of such exemptions, taking loads and environmental conditions into account, as well as the total period of time after the PIE for which the functioning of the component is necessary.\n\nCheck valves are active components if they must change state following a PIE.\n\nExceptions to the single failure criterion are infrequent, and clearly justified.\n\n7.6.3 Fail-safe Design\n\nThe principle of fail-safe design is applied to the design of SSCs important to safety. To the greatest extent practicable, application of this principle enables plant systems to pass into a safe state if a system or component fails, with no necessity for any action to be taken.\n\n7.6.4 Allowance for Equipment Outages\n\nThe design includes provisions for adequate redundancy, reliability, and effectiveness, to allow for online maintenance and online testing of systems important to safety, except where these activities are not possible due to access control restrictions.\n\nThe design considers the time allowed for each equipment outage and the respective response actions.\n\n7.6.5 Shared Systems\n\nIn cases where a system performs both process functions and safety functions, the following design considerations apply:\n\nThe process and safety functions are not required or credited at the same time;\n\nIf the process function is operating, and a PIE in that system is postulated, it can be shown that all essential safety functions of the system that are required to mitigate the PIE are unaffected;\n\nThe system is designed to the standards of the function of higher importance with respect to safety;\n\nIf the process function is used intermittently, then the availability of the safety function after each use, and its continued ability to meet expectations, can be demonstrated by testing; and\n\nThe expectations for instrumentation sharing are met.\n\nShared Instrumentation for Safety Systems\n\nInstrumentation is not typically shared between safety systems.\n\nWhere justified, there may be sharing between a safety system and a non-safety system (such as a process or control system).\n\nReliability and effectiveness of a safety system will not be impaired by normal operation, by partial or complete failure in other systems, or by any cross-link generated by the proposed sharing.\n\nThe design includes provisions to ensure that the sharing of instruments does not result in an increased frequency in demand on the safety system during operation.\n\nThe design provides for periodic testing of the entire channel of instrumentation logic, from sensing device to actuating device.\n\nIf the design includes sharing of instrumentation between a safety system and a non-safety system, then the following expectations apply:\n\nSharing is limited to the sensing devices and their pre-amplifiers or amplifiers as needed to get the signal to the point of processing;\n\nThe signal from each sensing device is electrically isolated so that failures cannot be propagated from one system to the other; and\n\nIsolation devices between systems of different safety importance are always associated with the system classified as being of greater importance to safety.\n\nSharing of SSCs between Reactors\n\nSSCs important to safety are typically not shared between two or more reactors.\n\nIn exceptional cases when SSCs are shared between two or more reactors, such sharing excludes safety systems and turbine generator buildings that contain high-pressure steam and feedwater systems.\n\nIf sharing of SSCs between reactors is arranged, then the following expectations apply:\n\nAll safety requirements are met for all reactors during normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs; and\n\nIn the event of an accident involving one of the reactors, orderly shutdown, cool down, and removal of residual heat is achievable for the other reactor(s).\n\nWhen an NPP is under construction adjacent to an operating plant, and sharing of SSCs between reactors has been justified, the availability of the SSCs and their capacity to meet all safety requirements for the operating units is assessed during the construction phase.\n\n7.7 Pressure-retaining SSCs\n\nAll pressure-retaining SSCs are protected against overpressure conditions, and are classified, designed, fabricated, erected, inspected, and tested in accordance with established standards.\n\nAll pressure-retaining SSCs of the reactor coolant system and auxiliaries are designed with an appropriate safety margin to ensure that the pressure boundary will not be breached, and that fuel design limits will not be exceeded in normal operation, AOOs, or DBA conditions.\n\nThe design minimizes the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries. This includes timely detection of flaws in pressure boundaries important to safety in a manner that supports leak-before-break detection capability.\n\nUnless otherwise justified, all pressure boundary SSCs are designed to withstand static and dynamic loads anticipated in normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs.\n\nSSC design includes protection against postulated pipe ruptures, unless otherwise justified.\n\nThe operation of pressure relief devices does not lead to unacceptable releases of radioactive material from the plant.\n\nAdequate isolation is provided at the interfaces between the reactor coolant system (RCS) and connecting systems operating at lower pressures to prevent the overpressure of such systems and possible loss of coolant accidents. Consideration is given to the characteristics and importance of the isolation and its reliability targets. Isolation devices are either closed or close automatically on demand. The response time and speed of closure are in accordance with the acceptance criteria defined for postulated initiating events.\n\nAll pressure boundary piping and vessels are separated from electrical and control systems to the greatest extent practicable.\n\nPressure-retaining components whose failure will affect nuclear safety are designed to permit inspection of their pressure boundaries throughout the design life. If full inspection is not achievable, then it is augmented by indirect methods such as a program of surveillance of reference components. Leak detection is an acceptable method when the SSC is leak-before-break qualified.\n\n7.8 Equipment Environmental Qualification\n\nThe design provides an equipment environmental qualification program. Development and implementation of this program ensures that the following functions are carried out in post-accident conditions:\n\nThe reactor is safely shut down and kept in a safe shutdown state during and following AOOs and DBAs;\n\nResidual heat is removed from the reactor after shutdown, and also during and following AOOs and DBAs;\n\nPotential for release of radioactive material from the plant is limited, and the resulting dose to the public from AOOs and DBAs is kept within prescribed limits; and\n\nPost-accident conditions are monitored to indicate whether the above functions are being carried out.\n\nThe environmental conditions to be accounted for include those expected during normal operation, and those arising from AOOs and DBAs. Operational data and applicable design assist analysis tools, such as the probabilistic safety assessment, are used to determine the envelope of environmental conditions.\n\nEquipment qualification also includes consideration of any unusual environmental conditions that can reasonably be anticipated, and that could arise during normal operation or AOOs (such as periodic testing of the containment leak rate).\n\nEquipment credited to operate during BDBA and severe accident states is assessed for its capacity to perform its intended function under the expected environmental conditions. A justifiable extrapolation of equipment behaviour may be used to provide assurance of operability, and is typically based on design specifications, environmental qualification testing, or other considerations.\n\n7.9 Instrumentation and Control\n\n7.9.1 General Considerations\n\nThe design includes provision of instrumentation to monitor plant variables and systems over the respective ranges for normal operation, AOOs, DBAs, and BDBAs, in order to ensure that adequate information can be obtained on plant status.\n\nThis includes instrumentation for measuring variables that can affect the fission process, the integrity of the reactor core, the reactor cooling systems, and containment, as well as instrumentation for obtaining any information on the plant that is necessary for its reliable and safe operation.\n\nThe design is such that the safety systems and any necessary support systems can be reliably and independently operated, either automatically or manually, when necessary.\n\nThe design also includes the capability to trend and automatically record measurement of any derived parameters that are important to safety.\n\nInstrumentation is adequate for measuring plant parameters for emergency response purposes.\n\nThe design includes reliable controls to maintain variables within specified operational ranges.\n\nThe design minimizes the likelihood of operator action defeating the effectiveness of safety and control systems in normal operation and AOOs, without negating correct operator actions following a DBA.\n\nSystem control interlocks are designed to minimize the likelihood of inadvertent manual or automatic override, and to provide for situations when it is necessary to override interlocks to use equipment in a non-standard way.\n\nVarious safety actions are automated so that operator action is not necessary within a justified period of time from the onset of AOOs or DBAs. In addition, appropriate information is available to the operator to confirm the safety action.\n\n7.9.2 Use of Computer-based Systems or Equipment\n\nAppropriate standards and codes for the development, testing, and maintenance of computer hardware and software are applied to the design of systems or equipment important to safety that are controlled by computer. These standards and codes are implemented throughout the life cycle of the system or equipment, particularly during the software development cycle.\n\nA top-down software development process is used to facilitate verification and validation activities. This approach includes verification at each step of the development process to demonstrate that the respective product is correct, and validation to demonstrate that the resulting computer-based system or equipment meets its functional and performance requirements.\n\nIf software provided by a third-party vendor is used in systems or equipment important to safety, then the software-and any subsequent release of the software-is developed, inspected, and tested in accordance with standards of a category commensurate with the safety function provided by the given system or equipment.\n\nThe software development process, including control, testing, and commissioning of design changes, as well as the results of independent assessment of that process, is reviewable and systematically documented in the design documentation.\n\nWhere a function important to safety is computer-based, the following expectations apply:\n\nFunctions not essential to safety are separate from and shown not to impact the safety function;\n\nThe safety function is normally executed in processors separate from software that implements other functions, such as control, monitoring, and display;\n\nThe expectations associated with diversity apply to computer-based systems that perform similar safety functions-the choice of diversity type is justified;\n\nThe design incorporates fail-safe and fault tolerance features, and the additional complexity ensuing from these features results in an overall gain in safety;\n\nThe design provides protection against physical attack, intentional and non-intentional intrusion, fraud, viruses, and other malicious threats; and\n\nThe design provides for effective detection, location, and diagnosis of failures in order to facilitate timely repair or replacement of equipment or software.\n\n7.9.3 Post-accident Instrumentation\n\nInstrumentation and recording equipment is such that essential information is available to support plant procedures during and following accidents by:\n\nIndicating plant status;\n\nIdentifying the locations of radioactive material;\n\nSupporting estimation of quantities of radioactive material;\n\nRecording vital plant parameters; and\n\nFacilitating decisions in accident management.\n\n7.10 Safety Support Systems\n\nSafety support systems provide services such as electrical, compressed air, and water to systems important to safety. The safety support systems ensure that the fundamental safety functions are available in all plant states, including normal operation, AOO, DBA and, to the extent practicable, BDBA states.\n\nWhere normal services are provided from external sources, backup safety support systems are also available on the site.\n\nThe design incorporates emergency safety support systems to cope with the possibility of loss of normal service and, where applicable, concurrent loss of backup systems.\n\nThe systems that provide normal services, backup services and emergency services have:\n\nSufficient capacity to meet the load requirements of the systems that perform the fundamental safety functions; and\n\nAvailability and reliability that is commensurate with the systems to which they supply the service.\n\nThe emergency support systems:\n\nAre independent of normal and backup systems;\n\nProvide continuity of the service until long term (normal or backup) service is re-established;\n\nHave a capacity margin that allows for future increases in demand; and\n\nAre testable under design load conditions.\n\n7.11 Guaranteed Shutdown State\n\nThe design authority defines the guaranteed shutdown state (GSS) that will support safe maintenance activities of the NPP.\n\nThe design provides two independent means of preventing recriticality from any pathway or mechanism during the GSS.\n\nThe shutdown margin for GSS is such that the core will remain subcritical for any credible changes in the core configuration and reactivity addition. Where possible, this is achieved without operator intervention.\n\n7.12 Fire Safety\n\nThe design of the NPP, including that of external buildings and SSCs integral to plant operation, includes provisions for fire safety.\n\n7.12.1 General Provisions\n\nSuitable incorporation of operational procedures, redundant SSCs, physical barriers, spatial separation, fire protection systems, and design for fail-safe operation achieves the following general objectives:\n\nPrevents the initiation of fires;\n\nLimits the propagation and effects of fires that do occur by\n\nquickly detecting and suppressing fires to limit damage, and\n\nconfining the spread of fires and fire by-products that have not been extinguished;\n\nPrevents loss of redundancy in safety and safety support systems;\n\nProvides assurance of safe shutdown;\n\nEnsures that monitoring of critical safety parameters remains available;\n\nPrevents exposure, uncontrolled release, or unacceptable dispersion of hazardous substances, nuclear material, or radioactive material, due to fires;\n\nPrevents the detrimental effects of event mitigation efforts, both inside and outside of containment; and\n\nEnsures structural sufficiency and stability in the event of fire.\n\nBuildings or structures are constructed using non-combustible or fire retardant and heat resistant material.\n\nFire is considered an internal hazard. The essential safety functions are therefore available during a fire.\n\nFire suppression systems are designed and located such that rupture, or spurious or inadvertent operation, will not significantly impair the capability of SSCs important to safety.\n\n7.12.2 Safety to Life\n\nThe design provides protection to workers and the public from event sequences initiated by fire or explosion in accordance with established radiological, toxicological, and human factors criteria. With this protection:\n\nPersons not intimate with the initial event (including the public, occupants, and emergency responders) are protected from injury and loss of life; and\n\nPersons intimate with the initial event have a decreased risk of injury or death.\n\nThe following design provisions demonstrate that the above life safety objectives have been achieved:\n\nEffective and reliable means of fire detection in all areas;\n\nEffective and reliable means of emergency notification, including the nature of the emergency and protective actions to be taken;\n\nMultiple and separate safe egress routes from any area;\n\nEasily accessible exits;\n\nEffective and reliable identification and illumination of egress routes and exits;\n\nSufficient exiting capacity for the number of workers (taking into account the emergency movement of crowds);\n\nProtection of workers from fires and fire by-products (i.e., combustion products, smoke, heat, etc.) during egress and in areas of refuge;\n\nProtection of workers performing plant control and mitigation functions during or following a fire;\n\nAdequate supporting infrastructure (lighting, access, etc.) for workers to perform emergency response, plant control, and mitigation activities during or following a fire;\n\nSufficient structural integrity and stability of buildings and structures to ensure safety of workers and emergency responders during and after a fire; and\n\nProtection of workers from the release or dispersion of hazardous substances, radioactive material, or nuclear material as a result of fire.\n\n7.12.3 Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety\n\nThe design minimizes the release and dispersion of hazardous substances or radioactive material to the environment, and minimizes the impact of any releases or dispersions, including those resulting from fire.\n\n7.13 Seismic Qualification\n\nThe seismic qualification of all SSCs aligns with the requirements of Canadian national-or equivalent-standards.\n\nThe design includes instrumentation for monitoring seismic activity at the site for the life of the plant.\n\n7.13.1 Seismic Design and Classification\n\nThe design authority identifies SSCs important to safety that are credited to withstand a design basis earthquake (DBE), and ensures that they are qualified accordingly. This applies to:\n\nSSCs whose failure could directly or indirectly cause an accident leading to core damage;\n\nSSCs restricting the release of radioactive material to the environment;\n\nSSCs that assure the subcriticality of stored nuclear material; and\n\nSSCs such as radioactive waste tanks containing radioactive material that, if released, would exceed regulatory dose limits.\n\nThe design of these SSCs also meets the DBE criteria to maintain all essential attributes, such as pressure boundary integrity, leak-tightness, operability, and proper position in the event of a DBE.\n\nThe design provides that no substantive damage to these SSCs will be caused by the failure of any other SSC under DBE conditions.\n\nSeismic fragility levels should be evaluated for SSCs important to safety by analysis or, where possible, by testing.\n\n7.14 In-service Testing, Maintenance, Repair, Inspection, and Monitoring\n\nIn order to maintain the NPP within the boundaries of the design, the SSCs important to safety are calibrated, tested, maintained and repaired (or replaced), inspected, and monitored over the lifetime of the plant.\n\nThese activities are performed to standards commensurate with the importance of the respective safety functions of the SSCs, with no significant reduction in system availability or undue exposure of the site personnel to radiation.\n\nSSCs that have shorter service lifetimes than the plant lifetime are identified and described in the design documentation.\n\nIn cases where SSCs important to safety cannot be designed to support the desirable testing, inspection, or monitoring schedules, the following approach is taken:\n\nOther proven alternative methods, such as surveillance of reference items or use of verified and validated calculation methods, are specified; or\n\nConservative safety margins are applied, or other appropriate precautions are taken, to compensate for possible unanticipated failures.\n\nDetails of alternate approaches to SSC monitoring are provided in the design documentation.\n\nThe design provides facilities for monitoring chemical conditions of fluids, and of metallic and non-metallic materials. In addition, the means for adding or modifying the chemical constituents of fluid streams are specified.\n\nThe design also considers the needs for related testing when specifying the commissioning requirements for the plant.\n\n7.15 Civil Structures\n\n7.15.1 Design\n\nThe NPP design specifies the required performance for the safety functions of the civil structures under normal operation and accident conditions.\n\nCivil structures important to safety are designed and located so as to minimize the probabilities and effects of internal hazards such as fire, explosion, smoke, flooding, missile generation, pipe whip, jet impact, or release of fluid due to pipe breaks.\n\nExternal events such as earthquakes, floods, high winds, tornadoes, tsunamis, and extreme meteorological conditions are considered in the design of civil structures.\n\nSettlement analysis and evaluation of soil capacity includes consideration of the effects of fluctuating ground water on the foundations, and identification and evaluation of potential liquefiable soil strata and slope failure.\n\nCivil structures are designed to meet the serviceability, strength, and stability requirements for all possible load combinations under normal operation, AOO, and DBA conditions, and in the event of external hazards. The serviceability considerations include, without being limited to, deflection, vibration, permanent deformation, cracking, and settlement.\n\nThe design specifications also define all loads and load combinations, with due consideration given to concurrence probability and loading time history.\n\nEnvironmental effects are considered in the design of civil structures and the selection of construction materials. The choice of construction material is commensurate with the designed service life and potential life extension of the plant.\n\nThe plant safety assessment includes structural analyses for all civil structures important to safety.\n\n7.15.2 Surveillance\n\nThe design enables implementation of periodic inspection programs for structures related to nuclear safety to verify as-constructed conditions.\n\nThe design also facilitates monitoring in-service for degradations that may compromise the intended design function of the structures.\n\nIn particular, the design permits monitoring of foundation settling.\n\nPressure and leak testing is conducted on applicable structures to demonstrate that the respective design parameters comply with requirements.\n\nThe design facilitates routine inspection of sea, lake, and river flood defences and demonstrates fitness for service.\n\n7.15.3 Lifting of Large Loads\n\nThe lifting of large and heavy loads, particularly those containing radioactive material, is considered in the NPP design. This includes identification of the large loads, and situations where they need to be lifted over areas of the plant that are critical to safety. The design of all cranes and lifting devices therefore needs to incorporate large margins, appropriate interlocks, and other safety features to accommodate the lifting of large loads.\n\n7.16 Commissioning\n\nAll plant systems are designed such that, to the greatest extent practicable, tests of the equipment can be performed to confirm that design requirements have been achieved prior to the first criticality.\n\n7.17 Ageing and Wear\n\nThe design considers the effects of ageing and wear on SSCs. For SSCs important to safety, this consideration includes:\n\nAn assessment of design margins, taking into account all known ageing and wear mechanisms and potential degradation in normal operation, including the effects of testing and maintenance processes; and\n\nProvisions for monitoring, testing, sampling, and inspecting SSCs to assess ageing mechanisms, verify predictions, and identify unanticipated behaviours or degradation that may occur during operation as a result of ageing and wear.\n\n7.18 Control of Foreign Material\n\nThe design provides for exclusion and removal of all foreign material and corrosion products that may have an impact on safety.\n\n7.19 Transport and Packaging for Fuel and Radioactive Waste\n\nNPP design incorporates appropriate features to facilitate transport and handling of new fuel, used fuel, and radioactive waste. Related considerations include facility access, as well as lifting and packaging capabilities.\n\n7.20 Escape Routes and Means of Communication\n\nThe design provides a sufficient number of safe escape routes that will be available in all plant states, including seismic events. These routes are identified with clear and durable signage, emergency lighting, ventilation and other building services essential to their safe use.\n\nEscape routes are subject to the relevant Canadian requirements for radiation zoning, fire protection, industrial safety, and plant security, which include assurance of the ability to escape from containment regardless of the pressure in containment.\n\nSuitable alarm systems and means of communication are available at all times to warn and instruct all persons in the plant and on the site.\n\nThe design ensures that diverse methods of communication are available within the NPP and in the immediate vicinity, and also to off-site agencies, in accordance with the emergency response plan.\n\n7.21 Human Factors\n\nThe design includes a human factors engineering program plan.\n\nRelevant and proven systematic analysis techniques are used to address human factors issues within the design process.\n\nHuman factors considerations:\n\nReduce the likelihood of human error as far reasonably achievable;\n\nProvide means for identifying the occurrence of human error, and methods by which to recover from such error; and\n\nMitigate the consequences of error.\n\nThe human factors engineering program also facilitates the interface between the operating personnel and the plant by promoting attention to plant layout and procedures, maintenance, inspection, training, and the application of ergonomic principles to the design of working areas and working environments.\n\nAppropriate and clear distinction between the functions assigned to operating personnel and those assigned to automatic systems is facilitated by systematic consideration of human factors and the human-machine interface. This consideration continues in an iterative way throughout the entire design process.\n\nThe human-machine interfaces in the main control room, the secondary control room, the emergency support centre, and in the plant, provide operators with necessary and appropriate information in a usable format that is compatible with the necessary decision and action times.\n\nHuman factors verification and validation plans are established for all appropriate stages of the design process to confirm that the design adequately accommodates all necessary operator actions.\n\nTo assist in the establishment of design criteria for information display and controls, each operator is considered to have dual roles-that of a systems manager, including responsibility for accident management, and that of an equipment operator. Verification and validation activities are comprehensive, such that the design conforms to human factors design principles and meets usability requirements.\n\nThe design identifies the type of information that facilitates an operator’s ability to readily:\n\nAssess the general state of the plant, whether in normal operating, AOO, or DBA states;\n\nConfirm that the designed automatic safety actions are being carried out; and\n\nDetermine the appropriate operator-initiated safety actions to be taken.\n\nThe design provides the type of information that enables an individual in an equipment operator role to identify the parameters associated with individual plant systems and equipment, and to confirm that the necessary safety actions can be initiated safely.\n\nDesign goals include promoting the success of operator action with due regard for the time available for response, the physical environment to be expected, and the associated psychological demands made on the operator.\n\nThe need for operator intervention on a short time scale is kept to a minimum. Where such intervention is necessary, the following conditions apply:\n\nThe information necessary for the operator to make the decision to act is presented simply and unambiguously;\n\nThe operator has sufficient time to make a decision and to act; and\n\nFollowing an event, the physical environment is acceptable in the main control room or in the secondary control room, and in the access route to the secondary control room.\n\n7.22 Robustness against Malevolent Acts\n\nThe design provides physical features such as protection against design basis threats (DBTs), in accordance with the requirements of the Nuclear Security Regulations.\n\n7.22.1 Design Principles\n\nThe design is such that the NPP and any other on-site facilities with potential to release large amounts of radioactive material or energy are protected against malevolent acts.\n\nThreats from credible malevolent acts are referred to as DBTs. More severe but unlikely threats are referred to as beyond design basis threats (BDBTs). Both types of threats are considered in the design.\n\nThreats identified as DBTs have credible attributes and characteristics of a potential insider or external adversaries, who might attempt unauthorized removal of nuclear material or sabotage against which a physical protection system is designed and evaluated.\n\nBDBTs are threats too unlikely to warrant incorporation into the design basis, but for which the consequences are assessed in order to establish means of mitigation to the extent practicable.\n\nConsistent with the concept of defence-in-depth, the design provides multiple barriers for protection against malevolent acts, including physical protection systems, engineered safety provisions, and measures for post-event management, as appropriate. The failure of a preceding barrier should not compromise the integrity and effectiveness of subsequent barriers.\n\n7.22.2 Design Methods\n\nThe design authority develops a methodology for assessing the challenges imposed by DBTs and evaluating the capabilities for meeting these challenges (e.g., as identified in an initial threat and risk assessment). The methodology applies conservative design measures and sound engineering practices.\n\nThe plant design considers the role of structures, pathways, equipment, and instrumentation in providing detection, delay, and response to threats.\n\nVital areas are identified and are taken into account in the design and verification of robustness. For vital areas, the design should allow enough delay for effective intervention by the on-site or off-site response force, taking structures, detection, and assessment into account. These areas should be protected from inadvertent damage during the carrying out of defensive actions.\n\nThe design provides appropriate means for access control and detection, and for minimizing the number of access and egress points to protected areas. Such points include storm sewers, culverts, service piping, and cable routing that could be used to gain access to the facility.\n\nThe design also considers the placement of civil utilities to minimize access requirements for such activities as repair and maintenance, in order to reduce threats to the protected area and vital areas.\n\nThe design authority also develops a methodology for assessing the challenges associated with BDBTs. This methodology is applied to determine the margins available for shutdown and for containment of radioactivity. Significant degradation of engineering means may be permitted.\n\n7.22.3 Acceptance Criteria\n\nAll safety system functions and capabilities continue to be available for DBTs.\n\nThe design provides for the ongoing availability of fundamental safety functions during BDBTs; these provisions will depend on the severity of the threat.\n\nFor more severe events there is a safe shutdown path that comprises at least one means of:\n\nReactor shutdown;\n\nFuel cooling; and\n\nRetention of radioactivity from the reactor.\n\nThere should be sufficient structural integrity to protect important systems. Two such success paths are identified where practical.\n\nFor extreme events, there is at least one means of reactor shutdown and core cooling. Degradation of the containment barrier may allow the release of radioactive material; however, the degradation should be limited with the goal that the dose acceptance criteria are not exceeded. In these cases, the response includes on-site and off-site emergency measures.\n\n7.23 Safeguards\n\nNPP design is subject to the obligations arising from Canada’s international agreements, and to requirements pertaining to safeguards and non-proliferation.\n\nThe design and the design process ensure compliance with the obligations arising from the safeguards agreement between Canada and the IAEA. In general, these features are associated with the permanent installation of safeguards equipment and the provision of services required for ongoing operation of that equipment.\n\n7.24 Decommissioning\n\nFuture plant decommissioning and dismantling activities are taken into account, such that:\n\nMaterials are selected for the construction and fabrication of plant components and structures with the purpose of minimizing eventual quantities of radioactive waste and assisting decontamination;\n\nPlant layout is designed to facilitate access for decommissioning or dismantling activities; and\n\nConsideration is given to the future potential requirements for storage of radioactive waste generated as a result of new facilities being built, or existing facilities being expanded.\n\n8.0 System-Specific Expectations\n\n8.1 Reactor Core\n\nThe design provides protection against deformations to reactor structures that have the potential to adversely affect the behaviour of the core or associated systems.\n\nThe reactor core and associated structures and cooling systems:\n\nWithstand static and dynamic loading, including thermal expansion and contraction;\n\nWithstand vibration (such as flow-induced and acoustic vibration);\n\nEnsure chemical compatibility;\n\nMeet thermal material limits; and\n\nMeet radiation damage limits.\n\nThe reactor core design facilitates the application of a guaranteed shutdown state as described in subsection 7.11.\n\nThe design of the core is such that:\n\nThe fission chain reaction is controlled during normal operation and AOOs; and\n\nThe maximum degree of positive reactivity and its maximum rate of increase by insertion in normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs are limited so that no resultant failure of the reactor pressure boundary will occur, cooling capability will be maintained, and no significant damage will occur to the reactor core.\n\nThe shutdown margin for all shutdown states is such that the core will remain subcritical for any credible changes in the core configuration and reactivity addition.\n\nIf operator intervention is required to keep the reactor in a shutdown state, the feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of such intervention is demonstrated.\n\n8.1.1 Fuel Elements and Assemblies\n\nFuel assembly design includes all components in the assembly, such as the fuel matrix, cladding, spacers, support plates, movable rods inside the assembly, etc. The fuel assembly design also identifies all interfacing systems.\n\nFuel assemblies and the associated components are designed to withstand the anticipated irradiation and environmental conditions in the reactor core, and all processes of deterioration that can occur in normal operation and AOOs. At the design stage, consideration is given to long-term storage of irradiated fuel assemblies after discharge from the reactor.\n\nFuel design limits are established to include, as a minimum, limits on fuel power or temperature, limits on fuel burn-up, and limits on the leakage of fission products in the reactor cooling system. The design limits reflect the importance of preserving the cladding and fuel matrix, as these are the first barriers to fission product release.\n\nThe design accounts for all known degradation mechanisms, with allowance being made for uncertainties in data, calculations, and fuel fabrication.\n\nFuel assemblies are designed to permit adequate inspection of their structures and component parts prior to and following irradiation.\n\nIn DBAs, the fuel assembly and its component parts remain in position with no distortion that would prevent effective post-accident core cooling or interfere with the actions of reactivity control devices or mechanisms. The acceptance criteria for the fuel for DBAs are consistent with these expectations.\n\nThe expectations for reactor and fuel assembly design apply in the event of changes in fuel management strategy or in operating conditions over the lifetime of the plant.\n\nFuel design and design limits reflect a verified and auditable knowledge base. The fuel is qualified for operation, either through experience with the same type of fuel in other reactors, or through a program of experimental testing and analysis, to ensure that fuel assembly requirements are met.\n\n8.1.2 Control System\n\nThe design provides the means for detecting levels and distributions of neutron flux. This applies to neutron flux in all regions of the core during normal operation (including after shutdown and during and after refuelling states), and during AOOs.\n\nThe reactor core control system detects and intercepts deviations from normal operation with the goal of preventing AOOs from escalating to accident conditions.\n\nAdequate means are provided to maintain both bulk and spatial power distributions within a predetermined range.\n\nThe reactor control mechanisms limit the positive reactivity insertion rate to a level required to control reactivity changes and power manoeuvring.\n\nThe control system, combined with the inherent characteristics of the reactor and the selected operating limits and conditions, minimize the need for shutdown action.\n\nThe control system and the inherent reactor characteristics keep all critical reactor parameters within the specified limits for a wide range of AOOs.\n\n8.2 Reactor Coolant System\n\nThe design provides the reactor coolant system and its associated components and auxiliary systems with sufficient margin to ensure that the appropriate design limits of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded in normal operation, AOOs, or DBAs.\n\nThe design ensures that the operation of pressure relief devices will not lead to unacceptable releases of radioactive material from the plant, even in DBAs. The reactor coolant system is fitted with isolation devices to limit any loss of radioactive coolant outside containment.\n\nThe material used in the fabrication of the component parts is selected so as to minimize activation of the material.\n\nPlant states in which components of the pressure boundary could exhibit brittle behaviour should be avoided.\n\nThe design reflects consideration of all conditions of the boundary material in normal operation (including maintenance and testing), AOOs, and DBAs, as well as expected end-of-life properties affected by ageing mechanisms, the rate of deterioration, and the initial state of the components.\n\nThe design of the moving components contained inside the reactor coolant pressure boundary, such as pump impellers and valve parts, minimizes the likelihood of failure and associated consequential damage to other items of the reactor coolant system. This applies to normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs, with allowance for deterioration that may occur in service.\n\nThe design provides a system capable of detecting and monitoring leakage from the reactor coolant system.\n\n8.2.1 In-service Pressure Boundary Inspection\n\nThe components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are designed, manufactured, and arranged in a manner that permits adequate inspections and tests of the boundary throughout the lifetime of the plant.\n\nThe design also facilitates surveillance in order to determine the metallurgical conditions of materials for which metallurgical changes are anticipated.\n\n8.2.2 Inventory\n\nTaking volumetric changes and leakage into account, the design provides control of coolant inventory and pressure to ensure that specified design limits are not exceeded in normal operation. This expectation extends to the provision of adequate capacity (flow rate and storage volumes) in the systems performing this function.\n\nThe inventory in the reactor coolant system and its associated systems are sufficient to support cool down from hot operating conditions to zero power cold conditions without the need for transfer from any other systems.\n\n8.2.3 Cleanup\n\nThe design provides for adequate removal of radioactive substances from the reactor coolant, including activated corrosion products and fission products leaking from the fuel.\n\n8.2.4 Removal of Residual Heat from Reactor Core\n\nThe design provides a means (i.e., backup) of removing residual heat from the reactor for all conditions of the RCS. The backup is independent of the configuration in use.\n\nThe means of removing residual heat meets reliability requirements on the assumptions of a single failure and the loss of off-site power, by incorporating suitable redundancy, diversity, and independence. Interconnections and isolation capabilities have a degree of reliability that is commensurate with system design requirements.\n\nHeat removal is at a rate that prevents the specified design limits of the fuel and the reactor coolant pressure boundary from being exceeded.\n\nIf a residual heat removal system is required when the RCS is hot and pressurized, it can be initiated at the normal operating conditions of the RCS.\n\n8.3 Steam Supply System\n\n8.3.1 Steam Lines\n\nThe steam piping up to and including the turbine generator governor valves and, where applicable, the steam generators, allow sufficient margin to ensure that the appropriate design limits of the pressure boundary are not exceeded in normal operation, AOOs, or DBAs. This provision takes into account the operation of control and safety systems.\n\nThe main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) will be installed in each of the steam lines leading to the turbine, and located as close as practicable to the containment structure.\n\nWhere MSIVs are credited with preventing steam flow into containment, they are capable of closing under the conditions for which they will be credited.\n\nWhere MSIVs provide a containment barrier, they meet the containment requirements that apply to those conditions for which they are credited.\n\nThe MSIVs are testable.\n\nSteam lines up to and including the first isolation valve and, where applicable, steam generators, are qualified to withstand a design basis earthquake.\n\n8.3.2 Steam and Feedwater System Piping and Vessels\n\nAll piping and vessels are typically separated from electrical and control systems to the extent practicable.\n\nThe auxiliary feedwater, boiler pressure control, and other auxiliary systems, prevent the escalation of AOOs to accident conditions.\n\n8.3.3 Turbine Generators\n\nThe design provides over-speed protection systems for the turbine generators to minimize the probability of turbine disk failure leading to generation of missiles.\n\nThe axes of the turbine generators are to be oriented in such a manner as to minimize the potential for any missiles that result from a turbine break-up striking the containment, or striking other SSCs important to safety.\n\n8.4 Means of Shutdown\n\nThe design provides means of reactor shutdown capable of reducing reactor power to a low value, and maintaining that power for the required duration, when the reactor power control system and the inherent characteristics are insufficient or incapable of maintaining reactor power within the requirements of the OLCs.\n\nThe design includes two separate, independent, and diverse means of shutting down the reactor.\n\nAt least one means of shutdown is independently capable of quickly rendering the nuclear reactor subcritical from normal operation, in AOOs, and in DBAs by an adequate margin, on the assumption of a single failure. For this means of shutdown, a transient recriticality may be permitted in exceptional circumstances if the specified fuel and component limits are not exceeded.\n\nAt least one means of shutdown is independently capable of rendering the reactor subcritical from normal operation, in AOOs, and in DBAs, and maintaining the reactor subcritical by an adequate margin and with high reliability for even the most reactive conditions of the core.\n\nRedundancy is provided in the fast-acting means of shutdown if, in the event that the credited means of reactivity control fails during any AOO or DBA, inherent core characteristics are unable to maintain the reactor within specified limits.\n\nWhile resetting the means of shutdown, the maximum degree of positive reactivity and the maximum rate of increase are within the capacity of the reactor control system.\n\nTo improve reliability, stored energy should be used in shutdown actuation.\n\nThe effectiveness of the means of shutdown (i.e., speed of action and shutdown margin) is such that specified limits are not exceeded, and the possibility of recriticality or reactivity excursion following a PIE is minimized.\n\n8.4.1 Reactor Trip Parameters\n\nThe design authority specifies derived acceptance criteria for reactor trip parameter effectiveness for all AOOs and DBAs, and performs a safety analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the means of shutdown.\n\nFor each credited means of shutdown, the design specifies a direct trip parameter to initiate reactor shutdown for all AOOs and DBAs in time to meet the respective derived acceptance criteria. Where a direct trip parameter does not exist for a given credited means, there are two diverse trip parameters specified for that means.\n\nFor all AOOs and DBAs, there are at least two diverse trip parameters unless it can be shown that failure to trip will not lead to unacceptable consequences.\n\nThere is no gap in trip coverage for any operating condition (i.e., power, temperature, etc.) within the OLCs. This is ensured by providing additional trip parameters if necessary. A different level of effectiveness may be acceptable for the additional trip parameters.\n\nThe extent of trip coverage provided by all available parameters is documented for the entire spectrum of failures for each set of PIEs.\n\nAn assessment of the accuracy and the potential failure modes of the trip parameters is provided in the design documentation.\n\n8.4.2 Reliability\n\nThe design permits ongoing demonstration that each means of shutdown is being operated and maintained in a manner that ensures continued adherence to reliability and effectiveness requirements.\n\nPeriodic testing of the systems and their components is scheduled at a frequency commensurate with applicable requirements.\n\n8.4.3 Monitoring and Operator Action\n\nOnce automatic shutdown is initiated, it is impossible for an operator to prevent its actuation.\n\nThe need for manual shutdown actuation is minimized.\n\nThe means for monitoring shutdown status and manual actuation is provided in the main control room.\n\n8.5 Emergency Core Cooling System\n\nAll water-cooled nuclear power reactors are to be equipped with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The function of this safety system is to transfer heat from the reactor core following a loss of reactor coolant that exceeds makeup capability. All equipment required for correct operation of the ECCS is considered part of the system or its safety support system(s).\n\nSafety support systems include systems that supply electrical power or cooling water to equipment used in the operation of the ECCS, and are subject to all relevant requirements and expectations.\n\nThe design considers the effect on core reactivity of the mixing of ECCS water with reactor coolant water, including possible mixing due to in-leakage.\n\nThe ECCS meets the following criteria for all DBAs involving loss of coolant:\n\nAll fuel in the reactor and all fuel assemblies are kept in a configuration such that continued removal of the residual heat produced by the fuel can be maintained; and\n\nA continued cooling flow (recovery flow) is supplied to prevent further damage to the fuel after adequate cooling of the fuel is re-established by the ECCS.\n\nThe ECCS recovery flow path is such that impediment to the recovery of coolant following a loss of coolant accident by debris or other material is avoided.\n\nMaintenance and reliability testing that is conducted when ECCS availability is required can be carried out without a reduction in the effectiveness of the system below the OLCs.\n\nIn the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant is required, it is not readily possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place.\n\nAll ECCS components that may contain radioactive material are to be located inside containment or in an extension of containment.\n\nECCS piping in an extension of containment that could contain radioactivity from the reactor core is subject to the following expectations:\n\nAs a piping extension to containment, it meets the requirements for metal penetrations of containment;\n\nAll piping and components of the ECCS recovery flow path piping that are open to the containment atmosphere are designed for a pressure greater than the containment design pressure;\n\nAll ECCS recovery flow paths are housed in a confinement structure that prevents leakage of radioactivity to the environment and to adjacent structures; and\n\nThis housing includes detection capability for leakage of radioactivity, and the capability to either return the radioactivity to the flow path, or to collect the radioactivity and store or process it in a system designed for this purpose.\n\nIntermed"
