        "text": "SMRs are defined as small nuclear reactors with a maximum output of 300 Megawatt electric (MWe) and can produce 7.2 million kWh per day. By comparison, large-size nuclear power plants have an output of over 1,000 MWe and can produce 24 million kWh per day.\n\nSMRs can vary in size from less than 10 megawatts electric (MWe) up to 300 MWe and can use a range of possible coolants including light water, liquid metal or molten salt, depending on the technology. SMR is the generic term to name such kinds of reactors, but the ones based on non-light water technology are also often called advanced modular reactors (AMRs). They all use nuclear fission reactions to generate heat that can be used directly or for generating electricity.\n\nSMRs comprise the latest technological features and safety advantages and many companies, and start-ups are looking into SMR projects.\n\nSMRs are harnessing the operating experience from traditional large reactors, as well as the use of small-scale reactors in nuclear submarines and other nuclear-powered vessels, such as icebreakers.\n\nSMRs have passive (inherent) safety systems, with a simpler design, a reactor core with lower core power and larger fractions of coolant. These altogether increase significantly the time allowed for operators to react in case of incidents or accidents.\n\nSMRs safety principles mostly rely on simple phenomena like natural circulation for the cooling of the reactor core, even during incident or accident situations requiring very limited, or even no operatorsâ€™ actions to bring the reactor to a safe state in case of need.\n\nThese passive safety systems also allow elimination of a range of components, valves, safety grade pumps, pipes and cables limiting de facto the risk of their failure."
