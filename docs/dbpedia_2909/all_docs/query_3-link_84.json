        "text": "Tab/Accordion Items\n\nBefore a Nuclear Power Plant Emergency\n\nThe following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property from the effects of a nuclear power plant emergency:\n\nBuild an emergency supply kit, which includes food that won’t go bad or expire, water, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio, extra flashlights and batteries. You should add plastic sheeting, duct tape and scissors to the kit.\n\nMake a family emergency plan. Your family may not be together when an emergency strikes. It is good to know how you will contact one another, how you will get back together, and what you will do in case of an emergency.\n\nGet public emergency information materials from the power company that runs your local nuclear power plant or your local emergency services office. If you live within 10 miles of the power plant, you should receive the materials yearly from the power company or your state or local government.\n\nDuring a Nuclear Power Plant Emergency\n\nLocal authorities would sound warning sirens and announce safety instructions through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on local television and radio stations if an accident at a nuclear power plant happened. Listen to orders from local officials. They will tell you the best way to stay safe. You may be told to leave or stay indoors.\n\nThere are four primary ways to limit the amount of radiation you are exposed to:\n\nShielding – put as many layers as possible between you and the radioactive material.\n\nIf instructed to stay indoors, take cover immediately. Go as far below ground as possible. Any shield or shelter will help protect you from the immediate exposure.\n\nClose windows and doors. Turn off air conditioners, heaters or other airing systems.\n\nDistance – the farther away you are away from the blast and the fallout, the lower your exposure.\n\nSome areas may be told to leave. Follow orders from local officials.\n\nIf you are told to leave, keep car windows and vents closed. Use re-circulating air.\n\nTime - decreasing time spent exposed will also lower your risk.\n\nPotassium Iodide – if there is a significant radiation threat, health care authorities may or may not tell you to take potassium iodide. Think about keeping potassium iodide in your emergency kit. Learn what the correct doses are for each of your family members.\n\nAfter a Nuclear Power Plant Emergency\n\nAfter a nuclear power plant emergency, local authorities will provide safety orders through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on local television and radio stations and through local news media. Listen to orders from local officials. They will tell you the best way to stay safe. You may be told to leave or stay indoors.\n\nGo to your designated public shelter or reception center if you have been told to leave.\n\nAct quickly if you have come in to contact with or have been exposed to dangerous radiation.\n\nFollow decontamination directions from local authorities. You may be told to take a thorough shower.\n\nChange your clothes and shoes. Put exposed clothing in a plastic bag. Seal it and place it out of the way.\n\nSeek medical treatment for unusual symptoms, such as nausea, as soon as possible.\n\nHelp neighbors who may need special help – infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs. People who care for them or who have large families may need extra help in emergency situations.\n\nReturn home only when authorities say it is safe.\n\nKeep food in covered containers or in the refrigerator. Food not previously covered should be washed before being put in to containers.\n\nMore Information\n\nThere are three types of radiation:\n\nAlpha – the least penetrating, can be stopped by a piece of paper.\n\nBeta – can be stopped by a thin piece of aluminum.\n\nGamma – can be stopped by lead, water or concrete.\n\nMore information on nuclear safety and protection from radiation can be found at:\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\n\nDepartment of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nListen to Local Officials\n\nLearn about the emergency plans that have been made in your area by your state and local government. In any emergency, always listen to the orders given by local emergency management officials."
