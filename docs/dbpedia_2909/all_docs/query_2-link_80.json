        "text": "With more than 50 years of safe and reliable operation in the U.S., nuclear energy is a proven and innovative technology. Georgia Power recognizes the role nuclear power plays in increasing our nation's energy independence, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nCurrently, more than 440 reactors operate in 31 countries and provide over 11 percent of the world's electricity as continuous, reliable power to meet base-load demand, with no carbon dioxide emissions. Globally 60 more reactors are under construction. Further, 55 countries operate a total of approximately 250 research reactors, and a further 180 nuclear reactors power approximately 140 ships and submarines.\n\nGeorgia Power has developed waste minimization/pollution prevention plans to make the wisest and most environmentally responsible use of resources. Each nuclear energy site places priority on identifying cost-effective opportunities to prevent pollution from all operations at its facilities. This focus on prevention of pollution at the source, combined with the minimal impact of nuclear energy processes to air, water and land, make nuclear energy a key element of Georgia Power's environmental performance.\n\nFor more details on nuclear energy and the environment, visit nei.org.\n\nFission is the splitting of atoms into smaller parts. Some atoms, themselves tiny, split when they are struck by even smaller particles, called neutrons. Each time this happens more neutrons come out of the split atom and strike other atoms, causing a chain reaction. The nuclear energy facility is able to control the chain reaction to keep it from releasing too much energy too fast. Through the chain reaction, fission becomes self-sustaining.\n\nFew natural elements have atoms that will split in a chain reaction. Iron, copper, silver and many other common metals will not split. There are isotopes of iron, copper, etc. that are radioactive. This means that they have an unstable nucleus and they emit radioactivity. However, just being radioactive does not mean that they will fission, or split. But uranium will. So uranium is suitable to fuel a nuclear energy facility.\n\nRadioactivity means giving off radiation. Radiation is a spontaneous emission of energy from the nuclei of atoms. It is naturally occurring, but it is also a byproduct of the fission process. Uranium is radioactive and when it splits, the atoms that are produced are also radioactive. Also, some metals that do not split when struck by a neutron will absorb the neutron and then become unstable or radioactive.\n\nAfter the steam is made, a nuclear energy facility operates much like a fossil fuel plant: the turbine spins a generator. The whirling magnetic field of the generator produces electricity. The electricity then goes through wires strung on tall towers you might see along a highway to an electrical substation in your neighborhood where the power is regulated to the proper strength. Then it goes to homes and businesses providing electricity to power lights, heaters, air conditioners, computers and more.\n\nPlant Vogtle units 3 and 4 are the first new nuclear units in the United States in 30 years. The new units will be the first in the industry to use the Westinghouse AP1000 advanced pressurized water reactor technology. This advanced technology allows nuclear cores to be cooled even in the absence of operator interventions or mechanical assistance. The AP1000 is the safest and most economical nuclear power plant available in the worldwide commercial marketplace, and is the only Generation III+ reactor to receive Design Certification from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\n\nIn the event of an emergency, new nuclear systems rely more heavily on forces like gravity and natural heat convection and less on pumps, valves, diesel generators and operator actions. New nuclear plants are designed to effectively and safely shut down using the natural forces of gravity, natural circulation and compressed gases to keep the core and containment from overheating.\n\nThe AP1000's simplified plant design results in a plant that is easier and less expensive to build, operate and maintain. The plant's design has:\n\n50 percent fewer valves, 35 percent fewer pumps, 80 percent less piping, 45 percent less building volume, and 70 percent less volume than earlier-generation nuclear plants. The modular design also allows for faster construction."
