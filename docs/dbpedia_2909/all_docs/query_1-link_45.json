        "text": "During 26 months of confinement, he tried to escape on five separate occasions. On his sixth attempt, he reached the Swiss border, scaled a 15-foot-high barbed wire fence, and crossed the Rhine River to Switzerland and freedom. In 1963, United Artists produced “The Great Escape,” a film which was based in part on Mr. Vogtle’s war-time experiences.\n\nAfter being captured in North Africa, Lt. Vogtle was transported to a prisoner-of-war camp in the heart of Germany. He escaped after six months of imprisonment, but he was recaptured in the Czechoslovakian town of Bakov.\n\nFrom Luft Stalag III, he made three more unsuccessful escape attempts. Then, on January 27, 1945, the Germans evacuated the camp and sent the prisoners by boxcar to Moosburg, Germany. Lt. Vogtle escaped from the train but was recaptured in Dunharr. He was sent to Moosburg for imprisonment but, in only a few weeks, he made his sixth and final escape through southern Germany to Diepoldsau, Switzerland.\n\nAlvin Vogtle, Jr. died in 1994.\n\nVogtle 3 & 4 are an essential part of Georgia Power’s commitment to deliver safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy for customers. The units will also play a significant role in supporting Southern Company’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nNuclear power units like Vogtle are the most reliable energy source, able to generate electricity at full power 24/7 – more than twice as much as solar and wind resources. Nuclear power units also require fewer maintenance outages than coal or natural gas, making electricity even more reliable for Georgians.\n\nAfter enough U-235 has been used up in the fission process, the fuel assemblies need to be removed and replaced with new fuel assemblies. However, the used fuel is highly radioactive. At most plants, used fuel is stored in large, steel-lined, concrete pools filled with water. These pools are known as spent fuel pools. Both water and concrete are excellent radiation shields. In these spent fuel pools, the water acts as an absorber, which prevents radiation from escaping from the pool. The water also keeps the fuel cool while the fuel decays, or becomes less radioactive over time. The water itself never leaves the inside of the plant’s concrete auxiliary building."
