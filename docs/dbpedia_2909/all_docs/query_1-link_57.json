        "text": "About the ASME Nuclear Component Certification Program\n\nASME has played a vital role in supporting the nuclear power industry since the first publication of the ASME BPVC, Section III, \"Rules for Construction of Nuclear Facility Components\" in 1963. The commencement of the ASME Nuclear Certification Program in 1968 has only strengthened that support.The Code continues to remain relevant and can be applied to small modular reactors(SMR), microreactors, and advanced reactors.\n\nCertificates Offered\n\nN-type and G-Type Certificates of Authorization issued by ASME signifies that a Certificate Holder has been through a rigorous survey to verify the adequacy and effective implementation of the quality assurance program. These Nuclear Certificates of Authorization allow Certificate Holders to certify and stamp newly constructed components, parts, and appurtenances used at a nuclear facility with the Certification Mark in accordance with Section III of the ASME BPVC. The Society issues different Nuclear type certificates such as N-type, G-type certificates, and an owner's certificate that authorizes the following scope of activities:"
