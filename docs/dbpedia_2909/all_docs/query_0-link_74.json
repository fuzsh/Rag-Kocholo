        "text": "The main nuclear products of Hitachi Zosen are transport casks and storage casks for spent nuclear fuel generated from nuclear power plants, as well as auxiliary equipment such as heat exchangers for nuclear power plants, and vessels and equipment used in reprocessing plants. In particular, we have a track record of more than 40 years in spent fuel transportation and storage casks, beginning with the development and manufacturing of the HZ-75T, our first domestically-produced product, in 1978. In 2011, Hitachi Zosen obtained the N Stamp for containers and equipment related to nuclear facilities and equipment of ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), and we will actively work on the production of nuclear equipment for nuclear power plants in the future."
