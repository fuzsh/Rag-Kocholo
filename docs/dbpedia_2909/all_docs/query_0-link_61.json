        "text": "There are many reasons why people prefer American-made items over imported goods. It seems that many individuals and businesses are increasingly going out of their way to purchase items that have the label “Made in USA.” Could the reasons be because of quality? Because of jobs staying in America? Because of pride in America? We believe it is all of these reasons and more!\n\nWe are proud to support the American industry by engineering, manufacturing, selling, and servicing our products right here in the USA.\n\nWe create quality jobs within our company, and through our high-quality products, we help the military, law enforcement, and a broad spectrum of industries, businesses, and workers throughout the nation to complete their jobs more efficiently and safely!\n\nYes, there are some minor parts that we are forced to purchase, which are not made anywhere in the USA; and that is unfortunate.\n\nDVC Dry Vapor Cleaner produces items to MIL-SPEC (‘military specifications’ – a U.S. Department of Defense standard and certification), and we maintain these standards on each and every product we make.\n\nOur philosophy has always been and will remain: We’re going to do it here in the U.S., and we’re going to do it better than anyone else. We’ve proven we can do that, and by the grace of God, we will continue to do so. Thank you for your support of our company. God bless you and your families, and God bless America!"
