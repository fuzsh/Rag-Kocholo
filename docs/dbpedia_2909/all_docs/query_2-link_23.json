        "text": "A nuclear reactor is a system that contains and controls sustained nuclear chain reactions. Reactors are used for generating electricity, moving aircraft carriers and submarines, producing medical isotopes for imaging and cancer treatment, and for conducting research.\n\nFuel, made up of heavy atoms that split when they absorb neutrons, is placed into the reactor vessel (basically a large tank) along with a small neutron source. The neutrons start a chain reaction where each atom that splits releases more neutrons that cause other atoms to split. Each time an atom splits, it releases large amounts of energy in the form of heat. The heat is carried out of the reactor by coolant, which is most commonly just plain water. The coolant heats up and goes off to a turbine to spin a generator or drive shaft. Nuclear reactors are just exotic heat sources.\n\nOn this page\n\nComponents of nuclear reactors\n\nAnimated reactor system\n\nThe nuclear core\n\nTypes of nuclear reactors\n\nAnimated reactor system\n\nThe animation above (reproduced from the NRC) shows a nuclear reactor heating up water and whirling a generator to produce electricity. It captures the essence of the system well. The water coming into the condenser and then going right back out is water from a river, lake, or ocean. It goes out the cooling towers. As you can see, this water does not go near the radioactivity, which is in the reactor vessel.\n\nTypes of Reactors\n\nThere are many different kinds of nuclear fuel forms, moderators, and cooling materials can be used in a nuclear reactor. As a result, there are thousands of different possible nuclear reactor designs. Here, we discuss a few of the designs that have been built before, but donât limit your imagination; over a million other reactor designs are possible. Dream up your own! Or, for fun you can try our Random Reactor Concept Generator or see a list of over a million options.\n\nA incomplete subset of reactor types broken down by coolant and moderator is shown below. For simplicity, we limit it to reactors that have either been built, are under construction, or have been the subject of significant experimentation and/or study. Reactors concepts in all boxes have been proposed, and some reactors that donât fit in the below boxes have been operated (e.g. LAPRE, LAMPRE, etc.)\n\nCoolant ↓ Moderator →\n\nWater Heavy water Graphite Not moderated Beryllium Organic Hydrogen / Hydride Water\n\nLight-water reactors (LWR)\n\nPWR\n\nVVER\n\nBWR\n\nSLOWPOKE\n\nWinfrith\n\nFugen\n\nGentilly-1 CANDU-BLW\n\nAdvanced CANDU (ACR)1\n\n9 Pu-production reactors at Hanford\n\nRBMK (e.g. Chernobyl)\n\nAMB-100 and AMB-200\n\nSteam-cooled fast reactors1\n\nTRIGA\n\nHeavy water\n\nCANDU\n\nSavannah River Pu-production reactors\n\nHanford Pu Recycle Test Reactor\n\nMolten sodium metal\n\nSodium-Deuterium Reactor1\n\nSodium-Graphite Reactors (SGR)\n\nSRE\n\nHallam\n\nSodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR)\n\nFermi-1\n\nEBR-II\n\nFFTF\n\nPhenix\n\nBN-800\n\nSodium-Beryllium Reactors\n\nSubmarine Intermediate Reactor (SIR/S1G)\n\nSeawolf\n\nSNAP-10A (NaK)</td> </tr>\n\nMolten lead metal\n\nLead-cooled fast reactors\n\nBREST-300\n\nAlfa-class submarines3\n\nMolten salt\n\nMolten Salt Reactor (MSR)\n\nMSRE\n\nTMSR-LF1\n\nFluoride High-temperature Reactors (FHR)1\n\nFast MSR\n\nMolten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR)1\n\nAircraft Reactor Experiment2\n\nCO2\n\nHeavy Water Gas Cooled Reactors (HWGCR)\n\nEL4 in France\n\nBohunice A1 KS-150 in Slovakia\n\nLucens\n\nECNG-FWCNG1\n\nGas-Graphite reactors\n\nEarly French UNGG reactors (like EDF1)\n\nEarly UK Magnox reactors\n\nAdvanced Gas Reactors (AGR)\n\nAir\n\nHeat Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE) 1-3\n\nCP-1\n\nORNLâs X-10 reactor\n\nUKâs Windscale piles\n\nBrookhaven Graphite Reactor\n\nLow-power fast reactor experiments, like ZPPR\n\nAGN-201\n\nHelium\n\nHigh-temperature gas reactor (HTGR)\n\nPeach Bottom\n\nFort St. Vrain\n\nHTTR\n\nDragon\n\nHTR-10\n\nHTR-PM\n\nAVR pebble bed\n\nTHTR-300\n\nUltra-High Temperature Reactor Experiment (UHTREX)\n\nHelium-cooled fast reactors1\n\nEBOR\n\nNitrogen\n\nGCRE\n\nML-1 mobile reactor\n\nOrganic (e.g. terphenyl)\n\nWhiteshell Reactor 1 (WR-1)\n\nHWOCR\n\nOrganic moderated reactors (OMR)\n\nOMRE\n\nPiqua\n\nArbus\n\nEOCR4\n\nLiquid Hydrogen\n\nNuclear Thermal Rockets\n\nNERVA\n\n</tbody> </table> </div>\n\nProposed and studied, but never built.\n\nThe ARE had sodium metal coolant in the reflector but was primarily molten salt cooled.\n\nThe Alfa-class submarines are fairly unknown, but had sufficient Be to consider them moderated reactors, not fast.\n\nConstructed but never fueled or operated\n\nAnother view of the options is shown below:\n\ngraph TD TRL([Choose\\ntechnology\\nreadiness\\nlevel]) --> High --> Construction TRL --> MedT[Medium] --> Construction TRL --> Low --> Construction Construction([Choose\\nconstruction\\nstyle]) --> Modular --> Size Construction --> Stick --> Size Size([Choose\\nsize]) --> Micro --> Cycle Size --> Small --> Cycle Size --> Medium --> Cycle Size --> Large --> Cycle Size --> Gargantuan --> Cycle Cycle([Choose\\npower cycle]) --> Rankine --> Moderator Cycle --> Brayton -->Moderator Cycle --> Stirling -->Moderator Cycle --> Piston --> Moderator Cycle --> Chemical --> Moderator Cycle --> Thermionic --> Moderator Cycle --> Ion[Ion capture] --> Moderator Cycle --> Inturbine[In-\\nturbine\\ncombustion] --> Moderator Cycle --> Other --> Moderator Moderator([Choose\\nmoderator]) --> MWater[Water] --> FFM Moderator --> MHW[Heavy Water] --> FFM Moderator --> None --> FFM Moderator --> Graphite --> FFM Moderator --> Beryllium --> FFM Moderator --> MOrganic[Organic] --> FFM Moderator --> Hydride --> FFM FFM([Choose\\nfuel\\nform]) --> Oxide --> FC FFM --> Metal --> FC FFM --> Nitride --> FC FFM --> Carbide --> FC FFM --> TRISO --> FC FFM --> MSF[Molten salt] --> FC FFM --> LMF[Liquid metal] --> FC FC([Choose\\nfuel\\ncycle]) --> LEU[LEU converter] --> Coolant FC --> NU[Natural uranium\\nconverter] --> Coolant FC --> HALEU[HALEU converter] --> Coolant FC --> HEU[HEU burner] --> Coolant FC --> PU[Plutonium burner] --> Coolant FC --> UPU[U-Pu breeder] --> Coolant FC --> THU[Th-U breeder] --> Coolant Coolant([Choose\\ncoolant]) --> Gas --> CO2 Gas --> Nitrogen Gas --> He Gas --> Air Coolant --> Water --> LW[\"Light\\nwater\"] --> BWR LW --> PWR LW --> Steam Water --> HW[\"Heavy\\nwater\"] Coolant --> LM[Liquid Metal] --> Na[\"Sodium/\\nNaK\"] LM --> Lead[\"Lead/\\nPbBi\"] LM --> Mercury Coolant --> Salt[\"Molten\\nSalt\"] Salt --> Fluoride Salt --> Chloride Coolant --> Organic Coolant --> Sulfur Coolant --> LH[\"Liquid\\nHydrogen\"] Coolant --> HP[\"Heat\\nPipe\"] Coolant --> OTH[\"Other\\n(Sulfate,\\nplasma,\\ndust)\"]\n\n</div> </div>\n\nPressurized Water Reactor\n\nThe most common type of reactor. The PWR uses regular old water as a coolant. The primary cooling water is kept at very high pressure so it does not boil. It goes through a heat exchanger, transferring heat to a secondary coolant loop, which then spins the turbine. These use oxide fuel pellets stacked in zirconium tubes. They could possibly burn thorium or plutonium fuel as well.\n\nPros:\n\nStrong negative void coefficient â reactor cools down if water starts bubbling because the coolant is the moderator, which is required to sustain the chain reaction\n\nSecondary loop keeps radioactive stuff away from turbines, making maintenance easy.\n\nVery much operating experience has been accumulated and the designs and procedures have been largely optimized.\n\nCons:\n\nPressurized coolant escapes rapidly if a pipe breaks, necessitating lots of back-up cooling systems.\n\nCanât breed new fuel â susceptible to \"uranium shortage\"\n\nBoiling Water Reactor\n\nSecond most common, the BWR is similar to the PWR in many ways. However, they only have one coolant loop. The hot nuclear fuel boils water as it goes out the top of the reactor, where the steam heads over to the turbine to spin it.\n\nPros:\n\nSimpler plumbing reduces costs\n\nPower levels can be increased simply by speeding up the jet pumps, giving less boiled water and more moderation. Thus, load-following is simple and easy.\n\nVery much operating experience has been accumulated and the designs and procedures have been largely optimized.\n\nCons:\n\nWith liquid and gaseous water in the system, many weird transients are possible, making safety analysis difficult\n\nPrimary coolant is in direct contact with turbines, so if a fuel rod had a leak, radioactive material could be placed on the turbine. This complicates maintenance as the staff must be dressed for radioactive environments.\n\nCanât breed new fuel â susceptible to âuranium shortageâ\n\nDoes not typically perform well in station blackout events, as in the Fukushima Daiichi accident.\n\nCanada Deuterium-Uranium Reactors (CANDU)\n\nCANDUs are a Canadian design found in Canada and around the world. They contain heavy water, where the Hydrogen in H2O has an extra neutron (making it Deuterium instead of Hydrogen). Deuterium absorbs many fewer neutrons than Hydrogen, and CANDUs can operate using only natural uranium instead of enriched.\n\nPros:\n\nRequire very little uranium enrichment.\n\nCan be refueled while operating, keeping capacity factors high (as long as the fuel handling machines donât break).\n\nAre very flexible, and can use any type of fuel.\n\nCons\n\nSome variants have positive coolant temperature coefficients, leading to safety concerns.\n\nNeutron absorption in deuterium leads to tritium production, which is radioactive and often leaks in small quantities.\n\nCan theoretically be modified to produce weapons-grade plutonium slightly faster than conventional reactors could be.\n\nSee Also\n\nCANTEACH â The most comprehensive public domain educational and reference library on CANDU technology.\n\nSodium Cooled Fast Reactor\n\nThese reactors are cooled by liquid sodium metal. Sodium is heavier than hydrogen, a fact that leads to the neutrons moving around at higher speeds (hence fast). These can use metal or oxide fuel, and burn a wide variety of fuels.\n\nPros:\n\nCan breed its own fuel, effectively eliminating any concerns about uranium shortages (see what is a fast reactor?)\n\nCan burn its own waste\n\nMetallic fuel and excellent thermal properties of sodium allow for passively safe operation â the reactor will shut itself down safely without any backup-systems working (or people around), only relying on physics.\n\nCons:\n\nSodium coolant is reactive with air and water. Thus, leaks in the pipes results in sodium fires. These can be engineered around but are a major setback for these reactors.\n\nTo fully burn waste, these require reprocessing facilities which can also be used for nuclear proliferation.\n\nThe excess neutrons used to give the reactor its resource-utilization capabilities could clandestinely be used to make plutonium for weapons.\n\nPositive void coefficients are inherent to most fast reactors, especially large ones. This is a safety concern.\n\nNot as much operating experience has been accumulated. We have only about 300 reactor-years of experience with sodium cooled reactors.\n\nMolten Salt Reactor\n\nUpdate! There is now a full page discussing MSRs in detail. Molten Salt Reactorâs (MSRs) are the internetâs favorite reactor. They are unique so far in that they use fluid fuel.\n\nPros:\n\nCan constantly breed new fuel, eliminating concerns over energy resources\n\nCan make excellent use of thorium, an alternative nuclear fuel to uranium\n\nCan be maintained online with chemical fission product removal, eliminating the need to shut down during refueling.\n\nNo cladding means less neutron-absorbing material in the core, which leads to better neutron efficiency and thus higher fuel utilization\n\nLiquid fuel also means that structural dose does not limit the life of the fuel, allowing the reactor to extract very much energy out of the loaded fuel.\n\nCons:\n\nRadioactive gaseous fission products are not contained in small pins, as they are in typical reactors. So if there is a containment breach, all the fission gases can release instead of just the gases from one tiny pin. This necessitates things like triple-redundant containments, etc. and can be handled.\n\nThe presence of an online reprocessing facility with incoming pre-melted fuel is a proliferation concern. The operator could divert Pa-233 to provide a small stream of nearly pure weapons-grade U-233. Also, the entire uranium inventory can be separated without much effort. In his autobiography, Alvin Weinberg explains how this was done at Oak Ridge National Lab: âIt was a remarkable feat! In only 4 days all of the 218 kg of uranium in the reactor were separated from the intensely radioactive fission products and its radioactivity reduced five billion-fold.â\n\nVery little operating experience, though a successful test reactor was operated in the 1960s\n\nHigh Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor\n\nHTGRs use little pellets of fuel backed into either hexagonal compacts or into larger pebbles (in the prismatic and pebble-bed designs). Gas such as helium or carbon dioxide is passed through the reactor rapidly to cool it. Due to their low power density, these reactors are seen as promising for using nuclear energy outside of electricity: in transportation, in industry, and in residential regimes. They are not particularly good at just producing electricity.\n\nPros:\n\nCan operate at very high temperatures, leading to great thermal efficiency (near 50%!) and the ability to create process heat for things like oil refineries, water desalination plants, hydrogen fuel cell production, and much more.\n\nEach little pebble of fuel has its own containment structure, adding yet another barrier between radioactive material and the environment.\n\nCons:\n\nHigh temperature has a bad side too. Materials that can stay structurally sound in high temperatures and with many neutrons flying through them are hard to come by.\n\nIf the gas stops flowing, the reactor heats up very quickly. Backup cooling systems are necessary.\n\nGas is a poor coolant, necessitating large amounts of coolant for relatively small amounts of power. Therefore, these reactors must be very large to produce power at the rate of other reactors.\n\nNot as much operating experience"
