        "text": "Inside the reactor buildingEach reactor building is a concrete cylinder with a domed ceiling and houses all radioactive parts of the system including the core. The concrete shell is built to withstand the impact of a Boeing 747 crash.\n\nThe core in the middle of the reactor building houses all the radioactive parts of the system including the core containing 150-250 fuel assemblies, each with 200-300 fuel rods. The inner lining of the core and fuel assembly need to be replaced as they degrade over time.\n\nThe circulation pumps surrounding the core need to be replaced almost every 10 years, and the heat exchangers surrounding the core must be inspected for leaks so that the radioactive water from the core does not mix with water circulating through the turbine hall.\n\nThe water pipes leading out of the reactor building may need to be replaced every 1-2 years as the metal expands and contracts adjusting to extreme changes in temperature.\n\nInside the turbine hall, where heat is turned into electricity\n\nThe turbine hall is a long rectangular building a few stories high, with a steam turbine in the middle and pipes leading in and out.\n\nThe steam turbine with propeller wheels takes the steam from the heat exchanger in the reactor building. Its components are checked routinely.\n\nThe steam passing through the turbine turns the generator making electricity. Generators are usually only replaced when they break down or are swapped for a more efficient model.\n\nThe steam turbine sits on top of the condenser system, another type of heat exchanger that transfers heat to the cooling tower.\n\nInside the cooling tower\n\nA massive cylindrical chimney with a flared base, the tower is the most recognisable part of a nuclear plant. It is separate from the radioactive parts of the system contained in the reactor building.\n\nCold air from outside gushes through the gaps between the diagonal columns to aid in cooling.\n\nCold water in the tower removes heat transferred from the turbine hall. Because there is no radioactivity in this part of the system, water can be safely circulated from nearby water bodies like rivers.\n\nSteam escaping through the top of the tower carries away heat.\n\nThe panels of the towerâs concrete shell can be easily replaced if they wear down or break.\n\nIllustration showing nuclear waste disposal process.\n\nFuel Assembly\n\nNuclear reactors contain bundles of fuel rods that contain uranium pellets. These bundles, about 4.3 metres (14 feet) tall and containing about 200 rods in a pressurised water reactor, are removed after five-to-six years of use.\n\nCooling pool\n\nSpent fuel cools in a pool at the reactor site for 5-10 years. The fuel bundles are placed in the storage rack at the bottom of the pool and are cooled by a supply of circulating water. The pool is about 12.2 metres (40 feet) deep and is made of reinforced concrete and lined with steel, making it capable of withstanding earthquakes.\n\nDry cask storage\n\nOnce the heat and radiation levels are sufficiently low, the fuel assemblies are vacuum dried and moved to a long term onsite storage facility. Each cask is a 5.2 metre (17 feet) tall cylinder with concrete walls to shield radiation and withstand extreme events around a steel canister containing the spent fuel assemblies.\n\nGeological disposal\n\nFor long-term disposal, deep geological repositories are being designed to bury and contain nuclear waste within stable geologic environments around 500 metres underground. Spent fuel assemblies (5 metres tall) are placed in nodular cast iron inserts, contained in copper canisters with 5 cm thick walls that can withstand corrosion and bedrock movements.\n\nThe canisters are embedded in moisture and shock-absorbent clay such as bentonite. The buffer also prevents any radioactive material from escaping into the bedrock."
