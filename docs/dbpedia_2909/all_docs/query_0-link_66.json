        "text": "In June 2020, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) finalized Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.2361 for plants evaluating the rod ejection accident (or reactivity-initiated accident [RIA]). The regulatory change is an enhancement of the precursor (RG 1.772 ) requiring a more detailed transient analysis that cannot be completed in the old onedimensional (1D) kinetics analysis methodology.\n\nTo resolve flow induced acoustic resonance in piping systems, Westinghouse can perform plant specific subscale testing to determine the source of the resonance and the optimal design change required to prevent it. For many plants, this design change involves the implementation of an acoustic side branch (ASB) in the existing piping system. Westinghouse has experience in testing and designing ASBs for several plants with flow induced acoustic resonances. The implementation of ASBs has proven to be an effective solution in reducing the magnitude of mechanical stress in the system and audible tones produced as a result of the resonance.\n\nWestinghouse has developed the Advanced Logic System® (ALS®) platform as a new approach to safety-critical control systems. It is a universal platform that targets safety-critical control systems, where reliability and integrity are of the highest importance. The ALS platform is a logic-based platform that does not utilize a microprocessor or software for operation, but instead relies on simple hardware architecture.\n\nThe advanced plastics processing system (APPS) represents a new approach to plastics waste minimization in nuclear power plant waste treatment and in other areas where radioactive waste arises. Some customers currently sort plastics waste in sorting boxes, place it into compactable drums and then compact or supercompact it. Because compacted plastic has a deformation memory, “spring back” results after compaction, making it difficult to achieve optimal waste reduction. A Westinghouse APPS installation is based on proven techniques that are currently used in the plastics industry worldwide. Westinghouse innovates to enhance them for the nuclear application. Maximum waste reduction is achieved without changing the chemical composition of the plastics.\n\nThe Westinghouse Solid State Rod Control System (SSRCS) has been in operation at many plants for over 30 years. This system has been very reliable but obsolescence concerns are increasing and personnel experience for the analog control system is difficult to maintain in the modern, digital world. The system also has limited diagnostics and can be time consuming to troubleshoot, increasing downtime.\n\nThe accumulation of deposits in the secondary side of steam generators (SGs) increases the potential for accelerated tube degradation and flow oscillations. As these deposits harden and form crevices, they can cause conditions that lead to tube corrosion. To improve upon traditional mechanical deposit removal techniques and avoid the potential drawbacks of traditional SG chemical cleaning, advanced scale conditioning agent (ASCA) technology was developed in 2000.\n\nAging management is a technical process that provides reasonable assurance that the aging of important nuclear power plant systems, structures and components (SSC) is being managed so they will continue to perform their intended function(s). Outside the United States, the aging-management process is being utilized to confirm the aging-management elements of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Periodic Safety Review (PSR) process. Most member states require a PSR review once every 10 years for continued plant operation. In the United States, the aging-management process provides compliance with the requirements for obtaining a renewed operating license. License renewal is a regulatory process that allows a nuclear plant in the United States to extend its operating license for an additional 20 years (beyond the 40 years of its original license). Whether applied to the PSR or license renewal, this process provides an extremely cost-effective way to assure available generation capability into the future.\n\nBackground All metal filter modules (AMFM), developed by Dominion Engineering, Inc. (DEI) and offered by Westinghouse, were originally intended to collect large quantities of activated corrosion products liberated during ultrasonic fuel cleaning activities. While still in use for those applications, AMFMs are also now being installed as a cost-effective alternative to plastic filters for general filtration and vacuuming applications in the spent fuel pool and reactor cavity.\n\n\"Irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking of reactor vessel internals is an important consideration as nuclear plants reach extended lifetimes. One component that is critical to maintaining the structural integrity of the internals and that has been shown to be susceptible to aging mechanisms is the baffle-to-former bolts (or baffle bolts).\"\n\nBackground For more than 35 years, Westinghouse has cut reactor vessel internals. For some plants, this was done in the frame of reactor pressure vessel internals (RPVIs) replacement as part of life-cycle extension programs. In some other cases, Westinghouse cut internals in plants under decommissioning. The underwater mechanical cutting technique has been used in all boiling water reactors (BWRs) since 1999.\n\nSmall leaks in pressurized water reactor (PWR) head penetrations can prevent a nuclear power plant from returning to power and cause expensive delays until a fix is devised. An increasing number of plants are reporting primary coolant leaks in the field-welded canopy seal area. To control these kinds of leaks, Westinghouse offers a full range of products and services including a unique mechanical clamp assembly named the Canopy Seal Clamp Assembly (CSCA™).\n\nCombustion Engineering (CE) Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) coils have been in use for more than 40 years with a respectable operating history. However, the upper gripper coil, which is normally energized continuously in order to hold the control rod at the full out position, has been found to be under particular stress. As a result, the CE CEDM upper gripper coil is prone to early failures, accelerated by excessively high voltage or exposure to temperatures above its design value.\n\nWestinghouse has developed replacement Combustion Engineering (CE) Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) High Temperature (HT) Upper and Lower Gripper Coils that have much higher temperature capability than the original CEDM gripper coil design. CE CEDM coils from the standard CE design have been in use for more than 40 years with a respectable operating history. However, the upper gripper coil, which is normally energized continuously in order to hold the control rod at the full out position, is under particular stress. As a result, the CE CEDM Upper Gripper Coil may fail after several years of service. Its failure is accelerated by excessively high voltage or exposure to temperatures above its design value.\n\nIf radioactive liquid or solid waste needs to be converted into a product suitable for final storage, cementation is one of the methods commonly used. Cement is readily available and inexpensive for use in solidifying liquid or wet solid waste, and also for encapsulating solid waste generated during operation of a power plant as decontamination and decommissioning waste and legacy waste. Using cement for immobilizing radioactive waste offers a wide range of possibilities for optimizing the properties of the final end product. Recipes for the end product can be tailor-made to suit particular waste streams – from the highest possible compression strength to the maximum amount of waste at a certain level strength – combined with low leachability.\n\nRemoval of particles from liquid waste is one of the most important steps in liquid radioactive waste treatment to get rid of particle-bound activity and protect downstream processes. The Westinghouse chamber filtration system consists of a chamber filtration unit, a feed tank with pump, a permeate tank with pump, a filtration additive tank with pump and a reject system with a Westinghouse-design docking station for the drums. Chamber filtration can tolerate various solid concentrations and build up its own filter layer; therefore, it is particularly well suited for sludge and other similar fluid mixtures. Filter additives can be used, if necessary and no filter cartridge waste is created.\n\nBackground Computerized procedures were developed to help operators execute normal and emergency operating procedures. Westinghouse has designed, developed and implemented a datadriven, software-based computerized procedures system (CPS) that guides operators through plant operating procedures. It monitors plant data, processes the data and then, based on this processing, presents the status of the procedure steps to the operator. The system can be used for normal operating procedures, abnormal operating procedures and emergency operating procedures. Computerized procedures allow the operator and computer to complement each other for more accurate and efficient procedural execution.\n\nIn 1995, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) provided an Option B to Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, Appendix J, which is a performance-based approach to leakage testing requirements that allows licensees with acceptable test performance history to change surveillance frequencies. Addressed with the performance-based approach are the surveillance frequencies for Type A, B and C tests. The Type A test assesses the overall leakage of containment. The Type B test assesses leakage for containment penetrations. The Type C test assesses leakage for containment isolation valves. At that time, provisions were made for extending the Type A test (integrated leak rate test [ILRT]) frequency from 3-in-10 years to 1-in-10 years.\n\nThrough its acquisition of ABB Combustion Engineering Nuclear Power in 2000 and its current KWN joint venture in Korea, Westinghouse supports the supply of 14x14 and 16x16 Control Element Assemblies (CEAs) for Combustion Engineering Nuclear Steam Supply System (CENSSS) plants, including those based on System 80 design technology. Westinghouse supplies all of the various full strength and part strength CEA design types used by the current operating fleet of CE-NSSS reactors.\n\nThe thermocouple nozzles on Westinghouse reactor vessel heads have two primary pressure boundary seals that have to be disassembled during each refueling outage: an upper and a lower Conoseal® joint. Each of these joints uses a Conoseal metal seal for the pressure boundary. If a seal fails during a refueling outage, the system has to be depressurized and drained below the seal elevation. After replacing the seal, the system must be refilled and vented, adding more than a day to critical path work and resulting in a significant increase in man-rem exposure.\n\nAnalog and digital control systems frequently perform poorly due to improperly selected control setpoints that resulted from on-the-fly tuning. To help address tuning problems, Westinghouse has developed a Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS)/Feedwater (FW) control system & plant model for use in modeling evaluations. It can also be used for support of on-site control system tuning. The NSSS/FW control system model has been developed for use with Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering (CE), and non-Westinghouse designed plants worldwide.\n\nWestinghouse decontamination and segmentation boxes are used to segment and decontaminate equipment, parts and other material that arise during operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities. The boxes are designed and developed to meet our customers’ specific needs regarding the capacity, plant layout, functional requirements, logistics, dose rate of material and degree of automation by focusing on as-low-as-reasonably-achievable principles.\n\nDrums that use a waste package with an elevated dose rate need to be capped automatically to avoid a dose rate exposure of workers. A Westinghouse-design drum capping system provides fully-automatic drum lid storage and fully-automatic capping of waste drums. The system can be installed in buildings, as part of a larger facility, and also in mobile systems.\n\nRadioactive waste shall be without free liquid for storage or disposal to avoid chemical reactions and corrosion. A drum dryer removes moisture from solid waste, such as sludges. The drum dryer was especially developed for the conditioning of waste contained in drums, but also other special containers.\n\nIdentifying the content of waste packages is an essential part of waste management activities to document the waste package parameters necessary to meet the storage or disposal requirements. Westinghouse provides a customizable drum radiation monitoring system for the non-destructive analysis of waste drums. We can provide a smooth integration of this system into a larger processing system.\n\nDry cask storage in/on an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) is the preferred solution for used nuclear fuel until a permanent geologic repository is established by, or for, the US Government. Westinghouse, through our acquisition of CB&I Stone and Webster, has extensive experience in design, analysis, licensing, and construction of an ISFSI. We also have the experience and expertise required to evaluate dry storage options along with design and construction of ISFSI expansions.\n\nThe oil level indicating system on Westinghouse reactor coolant pump (RCP) motors monitors the oil inventory within the bearing oil reservoir. The concept behind the original system used on the lower oil reservoir on RCP motors was a simple transference of oil level from inside the bearing oil reservoir to an alarm reservoir and sight glass that is external to the lower oil reservoir.\n\nCombustion Engineering (CE) Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) coils have been in use for more than 40 years with a respectable operating history. However, the upper gripper coil, which is normally energized continuously in order to hold the control rod at the full out position, has been found to be under particular stress. As a result, the CE CEDM upper gripper coil is prone to early failures, accelerated by excessively high voltage or exposure to temperatures above its design value.\n\nThe Westinghouse BOP and Design Engineering Product Line has performed major engineering and design, plant modifications and upgrade work at many PWR and BWR nuclear stations. We have proven experience and detailed lessons learned developed from many projects that provide our clients with an extensive pool of resources best prepared to apply industry best practices honed through hands-on background.\n\nMany nuclear utilities are struggling with high inventory levels and cost, while still facing vulnerabilities of not stocking parts critical to safety and plant operation. Enhanced Inventory Management addresses these challenges by reducing inventory levels and associated costs. The service is a key element of the OptiLifeTM Service Center which utilizes Westinghouse’s industry-best data capabilities and engineering subject matter experts to optimize inventory for our customers.\n\nThe enhanced performance rod cluster control assembly (EP-RCCA™) was developed to provide enhanced performance relative to previous control rod designs through the selection of materials and surface treatment that enhance the product’s resistance to wear and irradiation. The materials were selected with the intent to perform well with regard to corrosion and dimensional stability over the EP-RCCA design lifetime.\n\n\"The eVinci Micro Reactor’s innovative design combines new technologies with 50+ years of commercial nuclear design and engineering and creates a cost competitive and resilient source of power with superior reliability and minimal maintenance. Its small size allows for transportability and rapid, on-site deployment in contrast to plants requiring large amounts of construction. eVinci can produce 5MWe with a 15MWth core design. The reactor core is designed to run for eight or more full power years before refueling.\"\n\nThe eVinci™ Microreactor's innovative design combines new technology advancements with 60+ years of commercial nuclear design and engineering, creating a cost-competitive and resilient source of zero-emissions power and heat with superior reliability and minimal maintenance. Its small size allows for transportability and rapid, on-site deployment. eVinci can produce 5MWe with a 13MWth core design. The reactor core is designed to run for eight or more years at full power before refueling.\n\nThe eVinci microreactor's innovative design combines new technologies with 60+ years of commercial nuclear design and engineering and creates a cost competitive and resilient source of power with superior reliability and minimal maintenance. Its small size allows for transportability and rapid, on-site deployment in contrast to plants requiring large amounts of construction. eVinci can produce 5MWe with a 13MWth core design. The reactor core is designed to run for eight or more full power years before refueling.\n\nThe world is gearing up for our next visit to the moon- but this time we plan to stay. It's time to grow, innovate, and build sustainable habitats beyond our planet. The moon has critical elements required for deep space exploration including water, rocket fuel, hydrogen, and oxygen which can be used to supply difficult missions to Mars and beyond. The eVinci Space Microreactor provides the energy security necessary for humans to thrive on the moon and continue exploration of the solar system.\n\nAll nuclear power plants must consider and evaluate external flooding risks such as flash flooding from rain, river flooding, dam failure, hurricane and tsunami. These events challenge off-site power, threaten many on-site plant mitigation components, challenge the integrity of plant structures and limit plant access. Plants must understand the impact of these events in order to fully comprehend and prepare for these plant risks. Existing plant mitigation procedures may not be adequate to deal with these types of events.\n\nSince the late 1980s, industry data has consistently identified the feedwater system as one of the top two major system contributors to the number of automatic reactor trips, with poor feedwater control as a significant root cause. In response, Westinghouse has provided leading feedwater control upgrade technology as the basis for numerous retrofits currently operating in dozens of nuclear units worldwide, dating back to its first wave of digital upgrades in the late 1980s that initially utilized the WDPF® Instrumentation and Control (I&C) platform.\n\nSafe and expedient pressure release from reactor containment to the atmosphere must occur so that containment integrity can be maintained if pressure builds up in containment during a severe accident. A filtered containment venting system (FCVS) is necessary to perform such a containment depressurization effectively while minimizing the radioactivity released into the environment.\n\nA Fire PRA is required to implement plant transition to NFPA 805, as well as to meet NRC Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.200 requirements (i.e., technical adequacy of PRA results for risk informed activities). NFPA 805 is a standard developed by the National Fire Protection Association that provides a risk-informed, performance-based alternative to a plant’s current fire protection program. NUREG/CR-6850 is the NRC-endorsed guidance for developing a Fire PRA that meets the Fire PRA Standard, ANS 58.23.\n\nWestinghouse has been providing its Flux Mapping System (FMS) for pressurized water reactors (PWRs) since the beginning of the commercial nuclear power industry. The FMS provided by Westinghouse and systems based on the Westinghouse technology and design are in operation in nearly 50 percent of the operating plants worldwide. Replacement systems and upgrades also have been provided to PWR FMSs.\n\nPaR Nuclear, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, provides all types and sizes of cranes for use in nuclear power plants, with particular expertise and experience in outagecritical cranes. An outage-critical crane, a polar crane or reactor building crane, is one whose performance has the potential to impact refueling outage duration. As nuclear plants progressively reduce refueling outage durations, crane performance increasingly affects critical-path outage time.\n\nWestinghouse, offers pre- and post-installation service and support for both fuel-handling and outagecritical cranes. A year-round support program, it was developed to focus on this equipment before, during, and after an outage. By targeting these areas, our procedures remain current, maintenance items are addressed quickly, spare parts are optimized, and upgrades are evaluated.\n\nThe new FuelMaster® boiling water reactor (BWR) mast, designed by PaR Nuclear, Inc., a subsidiary of Westinghouse, is a freefloating, free-swinging, telescoping mast developed as a replacement mast on existing BWR refueling and fuel-handling platforms. Made of 304 stainless steel tubing, the mast is a square, tubular design with one stationary section and three moving sections. PaR Nuclear designed this mast with the following objectives in mind: simplicity, ease of maintenance, interchangeability of components, and suitable clearances to prevent binding and crud traps.\n\nAs its name implies, the state-of-the-art FULL SPECTRUM™ LOCA (FSLOCA™) evaluation model can analyze the full spectrum of LOCA break sizes with improved capability and analysis results compared to prior LOCA technologies. The FSLOCA evaluation model is NRC-approved for application to Westinghouse 3-loop and 4-loop PWRs. Extensions of the methodology to Westinghouse 2-loop PWRs, plants equipped with direct vessel injection, and CE PWRs are ongoing such that the methodology will soon be NRC approved for all Westinghouse and CE PWR designs.\n\nRegulatory Guide (RG) 1.200 endorses the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) consensus standard for internal events probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), which includes a set of minimal requirements for PRA modeling of large early release frequency (LERF). As the use of PRA in the nuclear industry matures, the capability of plant-specific LERF models, particularly those used in regulatory operations, must meet these standards.\n\nWestinghouse Electric Canada provides a suite of customized solutions and specializes in the design, development and manufacturing of high-reliability, custom-engineered systems for the nuclear industry. Our commitment to nuclear is demonstrated by over 45 years of experience, including more than 2,500 contracts for CANDU® utilities both in Canada and globally.\n\nWestinghouse uses treatment and conditioning processes to convert a wide variety of radioactive waste materials into forms that are suitable for their subsequent management— including transportation, storage and final disposal. The use of specially formulated grouts provides the means to immobilize radioactive material that is in various forms of filter cartridges, super-compacted pellets or in other forms of non-compactable radioactive waste.\n\nWestinghouse has provided quality products and services to the nuclear industry for more than a decade. Using this experience, and incorporating unique concepts, it has developed a high-flow backwashable filtration system that can process at high flow rates and at filter sizes to the sub-micron range. These systems provide a cost-effective way to meet diverse filtration demands.\n\nThe Westinghouse Hot Resin Supercompaction (HRSC) process is applied for volume reduction of organic bead and/or powder resin. It was developed more than 20 years ago to address the specific waste characteristics of one nuclear power plant. The presence of both powder and bead resins was considered in developing the process to address the needs of both pressurized and boiling water reactors. The most critical issue for a successful process configuration is the duroplastic behavior of resins, in particular of the bead resins. This behavior prevents the resins from building a homogenous, solid block and, in the worst case, bursting the metal surface of the pellet, known as the spring-back effect. Various laboratory and full-scale trials had to be performed to adjust the process parameters to address this issue.\n\nWestinghouse has more than 40 years of experience providing integrated specialty maintenance and technical services. We provide experienced project management and union and non-union labor who understand the demands of our customers and deliver quality I&C, Electrical Maintenance and Specialty Services. Our capabilities include MWO reduction, implementation testing and procedure writing as well as training services.\n\nCameras play a key role in the safety of workers and equipment in the nuclear industry. They are used to remotely monitor activities such as job coverage, personnel monitoring, fire watch, dose reduction, inspections, and monitoring of controls, gauges, and site glass. Due to the ever-changing demands for video quality, usability and the obsolescence of components, Westinghouse has launched its latest Power over Ethernet (PoE) compact and robust high definition (HD) pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) video camera; the ICH 5 Thunderforce Camera.\n\nDrying processes are used for volume reduction of liquid radioactive waste. The final product of this process is a solid waste product. The Westinghouse in-drum dryer dries liquid, non-combustible waste such as evaporator concentrates. During the drying process the solid content in the drum increases and precipitates while the liquid is evaporated and condensed subsequently. By falling below a certain drum filling level, liquid waste is automatically re-dosed. The drying process is complete once a certain condensate flow is no longer reached. The result is a quality dry product that can withstand long-term storage without chemical or biochemical reactions occurring over the subsequent storage period.\n\nWestinghouse provides an independent review of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) program studies to help customers show that their PRAs meet applicable technical-quality requirements. Per Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide 1.200, PRAs used for risk-informed regulatory applications must meet certain technical adequacy and quality requirements, as determined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Nuclear Society (ANS) PRA Standard (RA-S-2008).\n\nBackground During a severe accident or a beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA), the reaction of water with zirconium alloy fuel cladding, radiolysis of water, molten coriumconcrete interaction (MCCI) and post-accident corrosion can generate hydrogen (H2). The total mass of H2 produced in-vessel depends on several factors. For most reactors, it is on the order of 1,000 kilograms. High peak rates for H2 release to the containment of up to several kg/s can result from discontinuous releases from the reactor pressure vessel. The detonation of H2 can result in damage to structures such as containment buildings or spent fuel buildings. In all reactor designs, H2 monitors can be utilized to monitor the risk of containment or spent fuel building damage due to H2 detonations.\n\nWestinghouse is uniquely qualified to perform turn-key services utilizing its OEM experience, state-of-the-art technology and skilled workforce to help utilities successfully complete outage campaigns. We have excelled in performing these services for over 40 years, on five continents, resulting in top-quartile performance for our clients. Together, we have achieved safe operations, extended component life, and maximized power output.\n\nAn internal flooding (IF) risk assessment refers to the quantitative probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) treatment of flooding as a result of pipe and tank breaks inside the plants, as well as from other recognized flood sources. The industry consensus standard for Internal Events Probabilistic Risk Assessment (American Society of Mechanical Engineers/American Nuclear Society [ASME/ANS] RA-Sa-2009) includes high-level and supporting technical requirements for developing an internal flooding PRA (IF-PRA).\n\nWestinghouse’s bulk supply program has one main goal; to save our customers time and money. Rather than purchasing one item at a time, let our team of experts design a bulk solution for your needs. Our dedicated team of engineers, supply chain specialists and technicians create made-to-order kits designed to reduce processing and handling time, overhaul duration and inventory at site.\n\nWith nuclear power plants (NPPs) extending their licenses, there is a large backlog of work that must be performed prior to entering the period of extended operation. After the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) grants a plant a new license, the plant must fulfill a significant number of commitments before entering the period of extended operation. To satisfy all the commitments, many smaller tasks must be completed. Reductions in staff and a subsequent loss of experience are issues when completing the required commitments.\n\nPellet clad interaction (PCI) is a serious concern for operation of nuclear power plants under transient conditions such as those that occur during startup, temporary down power for maintenance activities, load follow or dropped rod recovery. Under these conditions, fuel failure can occur if the core is ramped too quickly. However, the definition of “too quickly” depends on fuel operating history; thus, if a single “rule of thumb” ramp rate is used it will be necessarily conservative and the plant will be delayed in getting maximum power on to the grid.\n\nTo keep your plant operating for the long-term, you need to think beyond the problems of today. To empower your colleagues, your neighbors and your community to reach your net-zero goals, you need strategic solutions that will elevate your capabilities for whatever comes next. Your organization must make critical investment decisions based on a variety of factors – from economic, infrastructure and material to social and political conditions. But to keep your plant running successfully into the future, you need more than an investment plan – you need a partner.\n\nWestinghouse has extensive global experience in the design, licensing, construction supervision and operational support of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste management facilities. The types of facilities that process both low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste typically must meet two fundamental objectives: providing immediate and deferred protection for both people and the environment and allowing the site to eventually be used freely and without radiological limitations. Westinghouse design for the disposal process is based on a multiple-barriers system that accomplishes both objectives.\n\nAt its nuclear parts operations shop in New Stanton, Pennsylvania (USA), Westinghouse provides full machine shop capabilities, offering both computer numerically controlled (CNC) and manual machine lathes as well as vertical milling machines (two-axis and three-axis CNC machining). The full-time tool and die makers who operate the machine shop have a combined 250 years of experience and can accommodate prototyping, one-piece runs and both low- and high-quantity production runs. The Westinghouse machine shop is certified for American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) machining.\n\nWestinghouse has developed a modular approach to designing custom main control rooms (MCRs) as part of an instrumentation and control (I&C) system modernization program for new plant designs. The MCR modernization program comprises the human systems interface (HSI) building blocks to modernize an MCR, as well as the integration of standard, software-based HSI resources using the building-block approach. Examples of MCR configurations are based on this approach, which supports new plant construction and existing plant modernizations.\n\nThe ability to measure is critical to the successful execution of any kind of project. Work of any kind requires precise measurement systems to provide repeatable, accurate measurements. Westinghouse, through its welding and machining group of companies, understands the importance of this need, and offers a wide array of metrology services.\n\nThe nuclear industry continues to experience significant pressure to reduce costs, yet the safe and efficient operation of nuclear power plants requires well-trained, highly competent staff. Research evidence from Mind, Brain and Education (MBE) science can improve the efficiency of nuclear industry training practices; but, instructors and instructional designers must first understand these findings to align content and instruction with how people learn most effectively and efficiently.\n\nSupercompaction is a proven and effective technology for volume reduction of nearly all the different kinds of solid radioactive waste such as metals, electronic parts, small equipment, piping, plastics, insulation material, filters, dried resin, sludge and asphalt. Westinghouse mobile supercompactors have been in worldwide operation since 1985. The supercompactor allows reliable and proven volume reduction as a mobile solution. The supercompactor provides customers with cost- effective, flexible and independent campaign planning and optimum space management on their sites, for both equipment and waste volume.\n\nThe Westinghouse Next-Generation Rod Cluster Control Assembly (NG-RCCA™) has been developed to provide further performance enhancements and increased longevity of the control rod assembly. The NG-RCCA builds upon proven and reliable Enhanced-Performance Rod Cluster Control Assembly (EP-RCCA™) design, which has had a service history of more than 30 years and more than 3,000 assemblies delivered globally to a wide variety of plants designs.\n\nBackground With more than 30 years of extensive nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) non-loss-of coolant accident (LOCA) safety analysis experience, Westinghouse is at the forefront of developing and maintaining state-oftheart methods. Westinghouse now offers a non-LOCA safety analysis methodology and technical transfer package that incorporates the RETRAN-02 computer code with Westinghouse software (FACTRAN, TWINKLE, OPTOAX), along with a set of analysis methods approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\n\nWestinghouse is a global leader in the supply and support of nuclear plant instrumentation and control (I&C) upgrades, engineering services, plant modernizations and new plant design. The Westinghouse Nuclear Automation product portfolio covers all areas of system operation over the life of the plant. Products include instrumentation, safety systems, control systems, plant information systems, diagnostics and monitoring systems, engineering services for functional upgrades, control system analysis and optimization, and operating margin recovery.\n\nWestinghouse core designers spend considerable time and effort developing high-performing loading patterns (LPs). However, redesigns are sometimes necessary, and even well-designed loading patterns can be adversely affected by fuel issues. When this occurs, months worth of design effort must be compressed into weeks or even days. Utilities can incur substantial costs waiting for a new loading pattern to be developed, analyzed and verified before continuing with the reload.\n\nOver the past 40 years, Westinghouse educational specialists and subject matter experts have provided training in fuel, services, technology, plant design and equipment to utility and industrial customers in the worldwide commercial nuclear electric power industry. Our passion for the nuclear industry, its plants and its people allow Westinghouse to leverage learning for global success by developing relationships that allow a better understanding of utility cultures which, in turn, results in nuclear safety and performance improvement.\n\nIn today’s competitive environment, utility employees must maintain high safety standards while achieving economic efficiency. It is imperative that utilities reduce plant operating and maintenance costs, minimize fuel costs and achieve the greatest return on advanced technology investments, while maintaining safety. To achieve this difficult balance, utility engineers must have a thorough understanding of nuclear fuel design methods and plant operating requirements. Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel Training Services can help utility personnel meet these needs by offering catalog courses and developing special customized courses.\n\nThe Westinghouse Solution INPO IER 21-4 recommends the implementation of a sustainable parts quality process that considers an item’s consequences of failure or degradation to address a steady trend of equipment-related consequential events in the industry. The Westinghouse Parts Quality Program (PQP) was developed under our world-class Quality Program and leverages Westinghouse’s extensive nuclear plant component and system knowledge, parts engineering expertise and specialized testing capabilities to deliver on the INPO Parts Quality Recommendation. The 100,000 sq. ft. Westinghouse Parts Business technical center in New Stanton, PA (USA) is fully equipped and ready to supply original Westinghouse parts in line with your site Parts Quality Initiative.\n\nIndustry studies indicate that the reactor pressure vessel may be a limiting component with respect to attaining the desired life and life extension (i.e., long-term operation/subsequent [second] license renewal [LTO/SLR]) for many nuclear power plants. The primary reactor vessel life attainment issue is concerned with the prevention of nonductile failure of the reactor vessel welds, which are subject to neutron radiation-induced embrittlement effects. For those vessels where this concern exists during their anticipated operational life, the implementation of neutron flux reduction programs can play a significant role in attaining desired reactor lifetimes. Because fluence impacts to these welds build up over time, effective fluence reduction requires implementing a program as early as possible to minimize the amount of incremental fluence reduction needed in each future cycle after program implementation (see graph).\n\nThe annulus gap between the reactor vessel and the containment cavity floor must be sealed to permit the flood-up required for refueling and reactor internal maintenance activities. This sealing is accomplished by installing a temporary pool seal into the annulus gap. The installation of these “temporary” seals is a critical path process that lengthens outage duration as well as increases worker exposure. These seals have also been known to experience leakage, which negatively impacts both outage and normal operation processes.\n\nOperators of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) with reactor vessel (RV) nozzle dissimilar metal (DM) safe-end welds, which are susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking, are required to examine those welds with increased frequency unless mitigating actions are taken. Requirements for these examinations are specified in American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section XI, Code Case N-770 latest approved revision specified in 10CFR50.55a.\n\nThe Plant Process Computer system (PPC), or plant computer, is a plant-wide information system for new and retrofit plants. The PPC consists of data acquisition and presentation layer components, with configurable, reusable software programs for performing nuclear plant performance and monitoring applications. PPC uses a redundant network design with advanced connectivity features that provides high capacity data transmission and reliable external system communications via standard and custom protocols.\n\nThe plant protection system monitors plant temperatures, pressures, levels, flows and nuclear instrumentation system outputs. If these parameters exceed plant safety limits, the system issues “partial reactor trip” and “engineered safeguards” commands. The plant protection system sends isolated analog output signals to the plant control system, the data processing and monitoring system, and the main control board. It also provides alarm outputs to the plant annunciator system. The plant protection system can be supplied with an interface to the data processing and monitoring system, or implemented as a standalone upgrade to the existing plant system. When supplied with an interface, a phased approach permits small stand-alone upgrades to be eventually integrated into a total plant information network.\n\nPaR Nuclear, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, provides all types and sizes of cranes for use in nuclear power plants, with particular expertise and experience in outage-critical cranes. An outage-critical crane, a polar crane or reactor building crane, is one whose performance has the potential to impact refueling outage duration.\n\nIn 2010, an international plant was shut down due to primary coolant leakage from a serviceinduced crack in a deformed pressurizer heater well insert (HWI). Intergranular stress corrosion cracking had initiated on the outside diameter surfaces of the heater sheaths, allowing primary water to enter the heater elements. The primary water then reacted with the magnesium oxide insulation inside of the heater internals, resulting in volume increase and subsequent splitting of the heater sheaths and HWIs.\n\nWestinghouse’s PRIME™ advanced fuel features help to improve fuel performance, enhance fuel reliability, enable better fuel cycle economics and provide additional margin at uprated conditions and higher burnup. The package of features includes an optimization of enhancements based on proven Westinghouse fuel reliability and world-class leadership in the design and manufacture of nuclear fuel. PRIME fuel features are available for the 17x17 Robust Fuel Assembly 2 (RFA-2), 17x17 Optimized Fuel Assembly (OFA) and 15x15 Upgrade Westinghouse fuel designs.\n\nThe POMS Suite is the leading software for obsolescence management in the nuclear industry, with data from 190+ worldwide nuclear units. It is a web-based software tool, that has been in operation for over 15 years, which centralizes obsolescence issue identification and solution sharing into a one standard nuclear industry platform.\n\nStarting with the first commercial Westinghouse-design nuclear power plants, Westinghouse has been involved in the development of generic, as well as plant specific, guidance for response to plant events. Following the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued NUREG-0899, which provided requirements for utility preparation and implementation of emergency operating procedures (EOP), including development, writing and maintenance. This was followed by NUREG-1358, in which the NRC reinforced its expectations with respect to the plantspecific technical guidelines, EOP writers guide, EOP verification and validation (V&V) and EOP training. Together, these regulations comprise the plant-specific procedure generation package (PGP).\n\nOperators of nuclear power plants frequently face problems that require accurate characterization and analysis of radiation. The wide-ranging difficult issues that can arise can be far beyond the scope of typical radiation analyses, such as nuclear fuel design and accident analysis services. The Westinghouse team of radiation experts can answer the tough questions on radiation analysis, and Westinghouse offers a suite of products to assist with radiation and thermal measurements.\n\nIn today’s market, the primary focus is to “do more with less.” Utilities no longer have the luxury of keeping all functions needed to run their businesses in-house. With the deregulation of the electric utility industry and the continuous push to lower costs associated with the production of electricity, many utilities need to outsource more and more of the functions they once performed themselves to remain competitive. As the foremost nuclear service supplier, Westinghouse offers a comprehensive, costeffective solution to a utility’s long-term viability.\n\nPrimary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) of Alloy 600 materials and instrument nozzle Alloy 182/82 welds has become a top industry concern for PWR plants. PWSCC has produced significant losses in power generation and attracted considerable regulatory attention. There are many locations within the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) that can contain Alloy 600 base metal or weld metal that can be susceptible to PWSCC over time. Additionally, previously replaced instrument nozzles may also leak due to weld flaws.\n\nDuring the life of a nuclear power plant, more than just routine inspections of a reactor coolant pump (RCP) motor are necessary to help prevent unscheduled or extended outages. It is recommended that RCP motors be sent to a service center to be disassembled.\n\nWestinghouse has designed, manufactured and refurbished hundreds of reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) for the global market, allowing Westinghouse to amass extensive experience and expertise in providing dependable RCPs, for the continued success of its customers. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Westinghouse maintains and has ready access to the original as-built records, which provide the resources to:\n\nAs an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of RCPs, Westinghouse is uniquely qualified to provide full-scope and technical advisory service for all facets of pump and motor field maintenance and repair. With over 60 years of quality service and technological knowhow, we perform dozens of jobs for utilities worldwide each year. In addition to providing routine and full-scope services, technological expertise and customer commitment has made Westinghouse the vendor of choice in critical emergency repair situations. Field services for routine maintenance and emergency repair use the extensive resources of the Westinghouse network of pump- and motor-related facilities and personnel.\n\nWestinghouse has provided refueling training services for pressurized water reactor plants at its Waltz Mill site in Madison, Pennsylvania (USA), for more than 20 years. This training, conducted in the site’s D-bay, is intended for refueling senior reactor operators, fuel/insert movement technicians, site refueling coordinators and fuel equipment engineers. All of the training programs combine formal classroom instruction with handson lab exercises to maximize student learning and skills development. The refueling training facility at the Waltz Mill site includes a complete and fully operational array of actual refueling equipment identical to that found in a typical reactor containment structure.\n\nPrimary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) of Alloy 600 materials and bottom mounted instrumentation (BMI) Alloy 182/82 welds has become a top industry concern for pressurized water reactor (PWR) plants. PWSCC has produced significant availability losses and attracted considerable regulatory attention. There are many locations within the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) that contain Alloy 600 base metal or weld metal that could be susceptible to PWSCC over time.\n\nNuclear power plants with reactor vessel closure heads (RVCHs) containing Alloy 600 base materials and Alloy 182 weld materials are susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC). In response to this concern, a number of PWR utilities have replaced their RVCHs. Replacements also provide an ideal opportunity to implement upgrades; this significantly reduces outage duration and dose, as well as addresses personnel safety issues that may exist during reactor disassembly and reassembly. To offer our customers a solution to this problem, Westinghouse has created a program to develop and implement RVCH upgrades integrated with the design and installation of a new RVCH that uses Alloy 690 and Alloy 152. Because these alloys aren’t prone to PWSCC, this is a risk- reducing option.\n\nThe Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program (RELAP) is a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission-developed tool for analyzing loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs) and system transients in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) or boiling water reactors (BWRs). It is a suite of codes for analyzing thermal hydraulic events using state-of-the-art two-phase flow models, which has broad capabilities in both nuclear and non-nuclear systems. RELAP5 is widely used worldwide in transient analyses for light water reactors (LWRs).\n\nWestinghouse has an advanced, diverse and proven portfolio of products to optimize the final phase of your refueling outage. In response to industry demand to reduce cost and effort associated with low power physics testing (LPPT) – including options to eliminate explicit tests when feasible – Westinghouse has developed new approaches to core design validation following refueling, adding to its reliable, world-class LPPT technology and services based on the Dynamic Rod Worth Measurement (DRWM™) technique. The Alternate Rod Worth Verification (ARWV) methodology and Subcritical Physics Testing (SPT) leverage aspects of Westinghouse’s extensive prior LPPT methods and experience to provide customers with a full range of advanced solutions to support post-reload startup test requirements.\n\nRemediation planning is a critical event at the end of life for a nuclear plant. The International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) “Integrated Approach to Planning the Remediation of Sites Undergoing Decommissioning, “(IAEA NW-T-3.3) report outlines a broad spectrum of considerations associated with this activity. Westinghouse has a range of remediation experience with plant sites, facilities and uranium mines and mills both privately and nationally owned.\n\nWhen it is not possible to perform a metallographic examination by taking a sample directly from a part to be checked, an investigation can be performed through a replica process. After a proper surface preparation, cellulose acetate sheets are used to make a copy or “replica” of the microstructure of the metal surface to be examined.\n\nThe Dose & Air Activity Check Point displays real time radiological data in an easy to view format on a mobile all-in-one system display. Westinghouse’s RMS software runs the application on the built-in PC and connects to area monitors and/or air activity monitors via wired or wireless connection.\n\nReactor Vessel Closure Head (RVCH) disassembly and reassembly activities are major considerations when it comes to a refueling outage’s critical path schedule, personnel radiation exposure, critical containment resources, foreign material exclusion (FME) control, personnel safety and cost. Ductwork associated with the cooling of the control rod/element drive mechanisms has to be disassembled every outage and then reassembled again prior to start up. To help our customers improve this process, Westinghouse offers a solution that reduces outage duration, polar crane dependency, personnel risk, dose and overall manhours.\n\nThe Westinghouse Double Encapsulated Secondary Source Assemblies (SSAs) were developed to provide an adequate source of neutrons for reload core fuel movement reactivity monitoring and subsequent cycle startups while further protecting the source material from erosion to the primary coolant system. The double encapsulated SSA design is the direct result of Westinghouse applying knowledge learned from over 4500 reactor-years of operational performance experience of the previous single encapsulated SSA design\n\nFollowing the Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) developed a plan (NUREG-1050 – August 1985) to resolve the severe accident generic issue. This plan identified that utility commitment to excellence in risk management, including prevention and mitigation, is key to protection of public health and safety; it also identified the need for new severe accident research.\n\nWestinghouse developed the SHIELD® passive thermal shutdown seal as a passive means of protecting the reactor core. It prevents a loss of reactor coolant system (RCS) water inventory should an event occur that causes a loss of all seal cooling. The SHIELD passive thermal shutdown seal is proven to significantly reduce or eliminate leakage from the reactor coolant pump (RCP) seal with no operator action, power or control logic required.\n\nIndustry studies indicate that the reactor pressure vessel may be a limiting component with respect to attaining the desired life and life extension, i.e., Long Term Operation (LTO) / Subsequent (Second) License Renewal (SLR), for many nuclear power plants. The primary reactor vessel life attainment issue is concerned with the prevention of non-ductile failure of the reactor vessel welds, which is subject to neutron radiation-induced embrittlement effects.\n\nReactor head disassembly and reassembly activities are major considerations when it comes to the refueling outage critical path schedule, personnel radiation exposure, critical containment resources, personnel safety and cost. The Westinghouse integrated head package (IHP) is an enhanced equipment design that offers a significant improvement in outage time. The IHP includes features specifically designed to reduce the efforts associated with disassembling and reassembling the reactor head in support of plant refueling.\n\nSolving corrosion-related issues is a major challenge for the worldwide ageing fleet of nuclear power plants, looking for LTO (long-term operation). While utilities can proceed to replacements for many pipes affected by corrosion, a replacement strategy is not always possible. Other maintenance solutions are required for inaccessible or embedded pipes. Moreover, for those pipes which cannot be replaced, internal inspection and corrosion removal become an even greater technical challenge if the pipe’s diameter is small and when the remote access to the zone of interest requires to travel through bended sections and elbows.\n\nSocket welds are used in numerous applications throughout the nuclear industry and due to the unique configuration, size and other limitations, ultrasonic inspection can be challenging. Westinghouse Inspection Services has the equipment, qualifications, and personnel to perform socket weld inspections for the thermal and vibration fatigue degradation mechanism. Even a slight stress flaw is detectable with the help of Westinghouse’s experience and advanced technology.\n\nWestinghouse has developed new printed circuit cards for use in the solid state protection system (SSPS). The replacement printed circuit cards are the same in form, fit and function as the original cards, but also address obsolescence of the Motorola High Threshold Logic (MHTL) devices, which are designed to enhance reliability and include improvements for maintenance.\n\nWestinghouse’s has several hundred Specialists and Subject Matter Experts (SME) many of which are nationally recognized experts who support a broad client base to resolve emergent technical issues. Our SME’s provide expert advice, analyses and or engineering and design to implement plant modifications or resolve or improve plant performance issues.\n\nWestinghouse is a market leader in providing services and technology to utility customers who are managing their independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). ISFSI operations and canister-loading campaigns continue to be low margin for error for operating utilities and will remain as challenging for end of life plants. Westinghouse has a response to meet this challenge.\n\nOver decades of operation, foreign material accumulates under the spent fuel pool storage racks, creating increased dose rates and operational challenges. This material can be in the form of particulate/sludge like material as well as foreign objects. Foreign material can be disturbed by water motion caused by fuel handling and spent fuel pool filtration. Water disturbance affects pool clarity and visibility, increasing the potential for human performance issues, schedule delays, and fuel damage.\n\nOwners need augmented technical and managerial support from time to time to support both planned projects and emergent plant issue(s). Staff or management augmentation support to our clients can take various forms and can accommodate diverse options unique to the client’s organization and situational needs.\n\n\"Our standard inspections provide robust and precise solutions.

Westinghouse offers a direct visual inspection system capable of accurately assessing Thermal Sleeve and adaptor wear, as well as locating any flange debris in the adaptor housing. The inspection tools are delivered by a tool carrier for an ALARA-optimized inspection.\n\nIn response to the events at Fukushima Daiichi, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an interim staff guidance document (JLDISG-2012-01) that places increasing emphasis on analysis of external events including high winds. Additionally, the U.S. NRC issued Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2015-06, “Tornado Missile Protection,” that addresses conformance to a plant’s current site-specific licensing basis for tornado-generated missiles and notes its acceptance of License Amendment Requests using probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methodologies and computer tools to simulate tornado-generated missiles.\n\nThe TracWorks® fuel data management system is a source of comprehensive, and integrated fuel and component-related information for a nuclear plant’s operators, engineers and administrators. The TracWorks system provides life-cycle tracking, data management and reporting for all fuel assemblies or bundles and components for both pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) units.\n\nWestinghouse has developed common turbine control solutions for pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs). The highly reliable Westinghouse turbine control protection system (TCPS) provides redundant control functions such as speed and overspeed control, load control, steam pressure control, valve testing, frequency control and turbine protection. The base control system can easily be expanded to provide additional functionality such as automatic turbine startup (ATS), moisture separator reheat (MSR) and the generator monitoring and turbine protection system (TPS).\n\nWestinghouse Electric Company continues to lead the way in the treatment of uranium-bearing residues, using several large-scale global facilities with a diverse range of capabilities to process hundreds of residue types. As a fuel manufacturer, Westinghouse has the ability to recycle uranium and return it to the fuel cycle.\n\nThe goal of Valve Program Management (VPM) is to maintain the safety-related and important-to-safety-related valves’ reliability so that they can perform the design basis requirements for the life of the plant. While this may be simply stated, the actual management and implementation of the program is a complex and comprehensive task that, if performed effectively, results in increases in both plant reliability and capacity factors.\n\nAs a full-service integrated valve and actuator maintenance company, Westinghouse performs preventative and predictive maintenance services and diagnostic testing on valves and actuators of all manufacturing types. We leverage our industry-recognized training programs, integrated project management approach and our First-Time Quality process to ensure that our customers’ most complex valve projects are completed on time and on schedule.\n\nThe lower canopy seal Weld is a weld between the reactor vessel head control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) latch housing and the reactor vessel head (RVH) penetration adapter. This weld has a tendency to develop cracks as a result of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and/or original weld defects. These cracks spread through the walls and create leakage.\n\nThe Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assembly (RWFA) design has rapidly become the Westinghouse standard fuel product for the VVER-1000 units in Ukraine. The RWFA design is an evolution of Westinghouse's previous VVER-1000 fuel design, WFA, which was first introduced as Lead Test Assemblies in South Ukraine Unit 3 in 2005.\n\nWestinghouse has proven expertise in the field of active waste handling, transport and storage. We are committed to developing custom designs and equipment to address the unique and challenging needs of our customers. We have a wealth of experience in the area of high-level waste vitrification, filtration, decontamination, , shielding, packaging and handling. Equipment operation in these radioactive environments demands extreme reliability and ease of maintenance.\n\nTreatment of radioactive waste into acceptable forms for storage or disposal is mandatory for waste producers. Waste from operating nuclear facilities and/or a decommissioning and decontamination (D&D) activity is produced in various forms (e.g., liquid, solid, gas) and thus requires different treatment to transfer it into acceptable waste forms.\n\nWestinghouse Electric Company now offers access to the largest state-of-the-art water jet machining center in the Northeastern United States, providing clients with a faster cutting solution for a wide array of material types, sizes and thicknesses. Customers can now have their large or difficult projects completed in a fraction of the time and cost.\n\nBackground Westinghouse is known around the world for game-changing technologies and innovation. We are maintaining that legacy today by making notable strides in the research, development and implementation of advanced manufacturing solutions for the nuclear industry. With these advanced technologies, Westinghouse is developing new products and services to provide innovative solutions for our customers. These technologies are driven by safety, quality and manufacturing excellence, and are resulting in lead-time and manufacturing cost reductions.\n\nMany nuclear utilities installed their post-accident monitoring instrumentation using technology from the late 1970s and early 1980s. In this rapidly changing technological environment, component obsolescence and ever increasing operations and maintenance (O&M) costs are a growing concern. To address this, Westinghouse is pleased to offer a modernized PAMS using its common qualified (Common Q™) platform.\n\nWith one of the largest safety-related installed bases in the world, the Westinghouse Common Qualified — or Common Q™ — safety-grade instrumentation and control (I&C) platform is approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other nuclear regulators worldwide for both new plant build applications and operating plant safety system upgrades.
