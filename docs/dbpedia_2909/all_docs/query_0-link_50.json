        "text": "San Onofre produced clean, firm power for Southern Californians for more than 40 years, at its peak generating enough electricity for 1.5 million homes. But the plant was retired in 2013 after defects were found with replacement components. SCE is now in a decades-long process of slowly, carefully, safely decommissioning the plant, a process that won’t be complete until the federal government fulfills its promise to clear the site of 123 canisters of spent nuclear fuel now stranded at San Onofre.\n\n“The communities around San Onofre did not consent to the long-term storage of fuel here,” said Manuel Camargo, SCE principal manager of Strategic Planning. “We need help from the federal government — to deliver on its contractual obligation to take the spent fuel. We’re working hard on that.”"
