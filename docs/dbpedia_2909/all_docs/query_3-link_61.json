        "text": "The energy that holds together the nucleus of an atom is called nuclear, or atomic, energy. Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. The nucleus is the central part of an atom.\n\nWhen nuclear energy is released, it changes into other forms of energy. These forms of energy are called radiation. Heat and light are examples of radiation.\n\nNuclear energy can be released through processes called nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. Nuclear fission happens when the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more parts. Nuclear fusion happens when two nuclei join to form a single nucleus. The nuclei of certain kinds of atoms can give off nuclear energy without fission or fusion taking place. These atoms are called radioactive.\n\nNuclear fusion happens naturally in stars such as the Sun. There atoms are constantly combining and creating nuclear energy. That energy is the source of the heat and light that Earth gets from the Sun.\n\nIn the 1930s scientists discovered that they could make nuclear fission happen in certain kinds of atoms. They made their discovery while working with atoms of the substance called uranium. They split the nucleus of a uranium atom in two by bombarding it with particles called neutrons. Nuclear fission releases a lot of energy. For example, the fission of 1 pound (0.5 kilogram) of uranium produces as much energy as burning 3,000 tons of coal.\n\nDuring World War II (1939–45) countries worked to build a weapon that used nuclear energy. The result was the nuclear, or atomic, bomb. The United States dropped the first nuclear bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945. The explosion destroyed most of the city and killed more than 70,000 people instantly. Scientists later discovered how to use nuclear fusion to make an even more powerful bomb, the hydrogen bomb.\n\nNuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes, too. In many countries nuclear fission is used in nuclear power plants. The heat it produces runs machines to create electricity.\n\nNuclear fission in nuclear power plants produces radioactive waste. This waste gives off radiation that can be harmful. Nuclear power plants are designed to be safe. But accidents have happened. In 1986 a very serious accident happened at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is now the country of Ukraine. Radioactive gases leaked out of the plant and into the air. They ruined crops and livestock and caused harm to many people. A similar accident happened when a tsunami damaged a power plant in northern Japan in 2011."
