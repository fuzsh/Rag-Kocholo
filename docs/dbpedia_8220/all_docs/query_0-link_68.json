        "text": "\"Mountain Breeze\" redirects here. For the localized wind phenomenon, see Mountain breeze and valley breeze.\n\nIn addition to PepsiCo's Mountain Dew, Coca-Cola's Mello Yello or Dr Pepper's Sun Drop, there are a variety of smaller or regional brands for citrus soda. Several of these brands include the word \"Mountain\" in their name to help describe their product, a nod to Mountain Dew's leading market position.\n\nCitrus Drop/Citrus Drop Xtreme\n\nBig K Citrus Drop is the generic version of Mountain Dew sold at Kroger stores. Its name plays another citrus drink, Sun Drop, which claims that its introduction in 1928 makes it the first soft drink marketed in this category, earlier than Mountain Dew. The brand's slogan is \"Pop the Drop\" which is analogous to Mountain Dew's former \"Do the Dew\" slogan. Citrus Drop contains 26.2 mg of caffeine per 12 US fl oz (350 ml) can, while Diet Citrus Drop contains 25.1 mg. The Xtreme version tastes the same, but contains more caffeine than the original Citrus Drop, and comes in a 'tribal' themed can. According to Kroger's customer service, Diet Citrus Drop Xtreme has 70.9 mg of caffeine. The slogan is \"Citrus With Attitude\".\n\nCitrus Pop\n\nThis is the Stewart's Shops equivalent to Mountain Dew available in upstate New York and Vermont.\n\nFountain Mist\n\nThis was the Sodastream version of Mountain Dew, sold as a syrup for their home carbonation device.

Fountain Mist was discontinued as part of their brand overhaul in mid-2015.\n\nHannaford Mountain Lion\n\nHannaford makes Mountain Lion and it has a flavor similar to Mountain Dew but the color is a bit lighter green then Mountain Dew and it costs less it is very similar to Food Lion’s Mountain Lion\n\nIngredients: CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, ORANGE JUICE FROM CONCENTRATE, NATURAL FLAVORS, CITRIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE (A PRESERVATIVE), GUM ACACIA, POTASSIUM CITRATE, CAFFEINE, Calcium disodium EDTA (TO PROTECT FLAVOR), YELLOW 5, BROMINATED VEGETABLE OIL.

The taste falls somewhere between Mello Yello and Mountain Dew.\n\nKickapoo Joy Juice\n\nKickapoo Joy Juice is a citrus-flavored soft drink brand owned by the Monarch Beverage Company.
