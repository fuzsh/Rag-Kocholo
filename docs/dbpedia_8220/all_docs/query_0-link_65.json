        "text": "The contract for the first U. S. operational jet aircraft was the impetus for Lockheed management to allow Kelly to start a research and development department that became the now famous Skunk Works.\n\nKelly was given the nod to head up the project because he was very interested in the jet engine as a propulsion device for aircraft and he had the organizational skills necessary to pull it all together. Kelly's basic concept to getting things done was to cut all the red tape that so commonly plagues large organizations and create a direct relationship between the design engineers and the manufacturing side of the house. The engineer was responsible for all facets of his design including procurement of material, overseeing the machining parts to functionally testing his design. These rules were set down and later became a blueprint for Kelly's 14 rules of Skunk Works operations. The skunk works operation was kept at the highest security level possible and this of course led to some problems. The first Skunk Works building was far from being state-of-the-art but was in fact a temporary building framed from salvaged lumber with a circus tent acting as a roof. It was located adjacent to the B-1 wind tunnel and lacked all the things we think of as necessary today, air-conditioning, sufficient lighting and adequate space. The weather in Brbank often reaches over 100(F in the summer so it was miserable until they installed some cooling equipment. During this time since secrecy was at a very high level surrounding their work even in a defense plant many people had a natural curiosity of what was going on. All they knew was that something was brewing in that area over by the wind tunnel. So the group got tagged with the name Skonk Works derived from the Al Capp cartoon strip Snuffy Smith where the main character made moonshine with skonks (skunks), and other miscellaneous ingredients in the woods where the revenuers couldn't find them. The name Skonk Works stuck until Al Capp complained and then it was changed to Skunk Works.\n\nA nice exposition of another take on the metaphor by"
