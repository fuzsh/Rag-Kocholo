When a batch \"needs more body\", the formidable pair simply goes out and clubs \"a body\" (often a moose), and tosses it in.[4] Over the years, the \"recipe\" has called for live grizzly bears, panthers, kerosene, horseshoes and anvils, among other ingredients.\n\nProduct\n\n[edit]\n\nThe real-life drink was introduced in 1965 under NuGrape, a former brand of the Monarch Beverage Company.[1] That year, Nugrape worked out a deal with Al Capp, the owner of the \"Kickapoo Joy Juice\" rights, to produce the beverage as a carbonated soft drink. Capp, however, would have the last word on all advertising and promotion.[1] Kickapoo Joy Juice's early advertising campaign was very similar to Mountain Dew's of the time – using characters from Li'l Abner to create and market a hillbilly feeling.[13] Although the product is distributed largely in Asian markets (Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia and Bangladesh), the can still comes decorated with a vintage Li'l Abner drawing.[14]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had a regular feature on mixed drinks, and once published in it a recipe for Kickapoo Joy Juice. The backstory is that it had been illicit hooch ginned up by soldiers during World War II, often starting from alcohol intended for fuel for torpedoes and the like.\n\nVariants\n\n[edit]\n\nKickapoo Joy Juice (original)\n\nKickapoo Fruit Shine (sangria flavored)\n\nKickapoo Fuzzy Navel (peach flavored)\n\nKickapoo Malibu (piña colada flavored)\n\nKickapoo Lemonade (lemon flavored)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDrink portal\n\nKickapoo people\n\nList of soft drinks by country\n\nThe song of the same name by The Rivingtons\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
