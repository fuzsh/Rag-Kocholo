        "text": "This past week I was asked more about some of the components of the soils that we use to make our soils products.\n\nFor me it’s like asking Granny in the L’il Abner comic strip about her recipe for her Kickapoo Joy Juice. I hope you know who I’m talking about and explain it to the yung-uns amongst you.\n\nThe point is that this worm stuff has so much wonderful material in it that your plants will thank you all season long when you use it. If we had more worm stuff in our soils, then our soils would have more nutrients available, the water would get deeper in the soil and more soil shredders like worms would help our plants and would make the plants stronger.\n\nIs it worth it to have soil that is rich in nutrients?\n\nWhen you set up a worm-bin, where you are feeding your worms you are going to want to have a balance of browns (carbon-rich) with greens (nitrogen-rich) and wet materials with absorbent materials. Bottom line is that we are to create an environment that is ideal for our worms and allow them to be as healthy and efficient as possible.\n\nWhat you need to keep in mind is that our little buddies are not really feeding on the material that is placed in the container or the environment that they are found in, worms are for the most part predators, and feeding on the microscopic life in the container that is feeding on the material in the container, which only begins to colonize the material after a short period of time or about two weeks.\n\nSo this green and brown material has been partially processed through not just the worms themselves but also through the microbe rich life that has been in the container longer than the worms who were introduced later in the process. This means that the nutrients that you find in the worm stuff is not just worm stuff, but also microbe stuff allowing the nutrients to be more available when plants are planted in that worm stuff.\n\nThis environment is not all that difficult to create. The challenge is that it really is a two-step process to be most efficient. These microbes should have had a little time before the worms are really happy.\n\nVermicomposting is different from regular composting in several ways.\n\nRegular composting you have reached temperatures that will have destroyed harmful seeds, insects and fungal diseases in the soil, and you will have expended a large amount of energy in layering the different materials and turning the material to allow the compost to be exposed to the air.\n\nAfter the initial browns or bedding material and the greens the foods have been layered in their proper proportions and the worms brought in latter and begin feeding on the microbes both the beneficial microbes and the harmful microbes, we see lower temperatures and less expenditure of energy in turning of the composting materials.\n\nThe basic challenge is that you just don’t have as much of the vermi-compost or worm stuff as you would of the regular compost.\n\nWith the vermi-composting you are going to naturally have some of the worm eggs in the compost and some of the left over microbial life, which makes the vermi-composting more alive than the regular compost.\n\nWorm stuff or vermi-composting is a continuous process verses the hot composting or traditional composting being a batch process, which means that you will have continuous material from the worms verses a large amount of material from the regular compost.\n\nThe very nature of worms with their burrowing allows the compost to have more oxygen in the soil naturally and able to handle water better as compared to the regular compost. This worm compost should be considered as a part of any good soil mix.\n\nHope you have a nice stroll through your garden this week. If you have any issues in your garden email me at ewlarson546@yahoo.com I shall do my best to answer the questions. Thank you for your participation. You can also reach me at my website www.ohiohealthyfoodcooperative.org soon and connect with me there or at the blogs or Facebook pages that are linked to the website.\n\n— Eric Larson, a Jeromesville-based landscape designer, writes the weekly A Stroll Through The Garden column."
