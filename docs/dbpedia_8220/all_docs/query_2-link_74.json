Fly of Austin: “Chester Gould was the creator of the popular ‘Dick Tracy’ comic strip. My pen name, Fly, comes from Flyface in the strip.\n\n“This morning I remembered one of his characters, Gravel Gertie [Gertrude Plenty]. Back in the day, his readers got involved. Gould had a contest to name this uncomely lady with a face like 5 miles of bad road. Evidently ‘Gravel Gertie’ was the winning name.\n\n“The Tracy strip also had a drink that was called Kickapoo Joy Juice. I think Li’l Abner drank that.”\n\nBULLETIN BOARD SAID: “Well, yes, Li’l Abner did drink Kickapoo Joy Juice — but not in ‘Dick Tracy.’ He drank it in a little comic strip, by Al Capp, called … ‘Li’l Abner’!”\n\nWe presently heard from The Cab Driver of South St. Paul: “If you went and did a Google search on ‘Li’l Abner,’ I think you’d then remember that Li’l Abner was pure as the driven snow: He’d never touch a drop of Kickapoo Joy Juice! The characters in the strip who did drink Kickapoo Joy Juice wouldn’t pass the politically correct standards of today. And that’s fact!”\n\nAnd from Mattzdad of Rochester: “W.i. Fly’s ‘Dick Tracy’ comments put me in mind of my favorite ‘DT’ character, Mumbles the bandleader, who would book a gig and then rob the party and escape, usually with Tracy somehow in pursuit. Gould had a way of creating great names and great cartoon characters.”\n\nMuse, amuse\n\nLeading to: What’s in a name? (responsorial)\n\nIGHGrampa: “Speculation about what the child of Alley Oop and Betty Boop would be named [BB, 2/17/2016]:\n\n“Since he is named after his father, he would be Alley, Jr. If he became a newspaper reporter and got a nickname, he might become Alley ‘Scoop’ Boop-Oop, Jr.\n\n“Given the unusual appearance of his parents, I wonder what he might look like. Alley, Sr. was a big, hairy guy with oversized forearms and lower legs. (Might he be related to Popeye?) Betty was a petite little lady with a large head, dark curly hair and a very small chin. So Alley, Jr. might be a big hairy guy with oversized forearms and lower legs with an oversized head, small chin and dark, curly hair.\n\n“Alley Oop did have a girlfriend, whose name was Ooola. If she and Alley ever got married, then she’d be Ooola Oop. If they had a son who became a tuba player, he might be Ooompa Booompa Oop.”\n\nThe unrespected, respected! (resp’l)\n\nFirst, Friendly Bob of Fridley: “A big thanks to IGHGrampa for his recognition of the tuba player in polka bands (BB, 2/15/2016). This really struck a nice chord with me, a veteran old tuba player.\n\n“I started playing the tuba in fourth grade, and continued with school bands through 12th grade, and even in my Navy boot-camp band (where I had lighter duty, being in a ‘special’ company). While I was still in high school, and later, before I joined the Navy, I played for a couple of years with a polka band that usually consisted of an accordion player, a drummer, and me. I also subbed with a few other bands on occasion, and all of those gigs were great fun.\n\n“One of my real joys as a young feller was when I got to play with well-known local artist and Minnesota Music Hall of Famer Roman Rezac, from the Lonsdale/Webster area. I managed that through several musician connections, and was a bit stunned when my friend Mert asked me to step in. Roman died in 2010, and I am sure that many of his recordings survive. I have several old vinyl records of his music, mostly under the Pleasant Peasant label.\n\n“For most of my polka playing, I used my own Reynolds Sousaphone, which I purchased in New Ulm (where else?) in the late 1960s. I still have that old horn, though I have not tooted it for years. After I left the Navy, I did have a couple more gigs, but nothing regular. Sure, it is a bit heavy, but at least with the Sousaphone, that weight can be borne on a shoulder.\n\n“I am ‘considering’ joining my heavy-brass brothers at next year’s Tuba Christmas, but I am not sure the lips still work. I am at least confident I can still do the fingerings that got thoroughly ingrained in my brain from playing all those years.\n\n“Thanks again for the stroll down Memory Lane.”\n\nTaxman: “The Bride (a.k.a. DebK of Rosemount) is at our little farm while I’m busy in town trying to earn a living. So she doesn’t get the paper until I deliver it. It felt pretty good to toss Monday’s paper in her lap and warn her not to miss BB. I get that same warning pretty often. (Yes, sometimes I have to be encouraged to read even the stories written by The Bride herself — but, really, I already know everything she writes about.) Anyway, it didn’t take long for The Bride to figure out that I wanted her to focus on the piece from IGHGrampa, which revealed that I am NOT alone in liking ‘Funtime Polka’ on Pioneer Public TV.\n\n“She’s a good cook and all, but The Bride is a music snob and has been known to make fun of my taste in music, especially of my enjoyment of old-time music. Over the years, we have compromised. She gets to listen to the Saturday opera on MPR, and I get my Saturday fix of ‘Funtime Polka.’ When my show is on, The Bride pretends to be focused on her crossword puzzle. But I see her toes tapping.”\n\nThe Permanent Paternal Record\n\nThe Gram With a Thousand Rules: “My kids bought some old Hula Hoops at a garage sale back in the early ’70s. They were not having much luck mastering them when my dad arrived. Dad jumped out of his car and grabbed one of the Hula Hoops and said: ‘Here’s how you do it!’\n\n“Now, my dad was in his 80s, and I had never seen him with a Hula Hoop. He was great at softball, terrific at pool, merciless at family touch-football games, and a pretty good bowler — but Hula Hooping?\n\n“Daddy took the Hula Hoop, set it on end and gave it a hefty roll. As it rolled across the yard, we were all stunned to watch him as he darted in and out, in and out, in and out of the rolling hoop all the way to the end of our lot.\n\n“The kids were kept busy all the rest of the summer, trying in vain to duplicate his feat.\n\n“There was nobody like my dad. He really was the only one.”\n\nVanity, thy name is…\n\nRed’s Offspring, north of St. Paul: “This personalized plate was on a GMC in the parking lot of the Shoreview Target: ‘SCOOBYD.’ The bracket for the plate was somewhat dog-eared, but no other clue about the vehicle’s possible occupant(s) was visible.”\n\nNorsky: “Came upon a black Lexus SUV at a traffic light on Radio Drive in Woodbury Friday afternoon. The license plate read ‘ICUUCME.’ Reminded me of a line in one of those Ben Stiller/Robert De Niro movies, like ‘Meet the Fockers’: ‘I’m watching you watching me.’ ”\n\nBULLETIN BOARD SAYS: It’s “Little Fockers.” Watch him watching him watching him, at tinyurl.com/watching-watching.\n\nOur times\n\nBirdwatcher in La Crescent: “While I was in the car today, I had the radio on and wasn’t paying too much attention to what was being said, but my ears pricked up when I heard the person saying that the worst part of being a parent is the potty training. Huh? I disagree; I think the worst part is raising a teenager — but I am sure not all parents will agree with me. He went on to say that there is now such a thing as a Potty Training School where they will teach you how to go about this training, how to discipline for accidents, and how to reward for not dirtying the pants. They will even come out to the house to help and instruct.\n\n“I can’t believe I was able to potty-train four children without professional help, and they succeeded in about two weeks. I must have been a genius.\n\n“What is this world coming to?”\n\nOur birds, ourselves\n\nIncluding: Today’s helpful hint\n\nDee of Inver Grove Heights: “It was mentioned in BB that a person doesn’t often see two pileated woodpeckers at once. We live in Inver Grove Heights, and we saw two pileateds this a.m. Also: Another day previously, two were here.\n\n“We make our own suet, and birds love it. Pileateds come at mealtime — 8, 12 and 4. They have a schedule, too!\n\n“Bird suet:\n\n“1 cup crunchy peanut butter\n\n“2 cups oatmeal\n\n“2 cups cornmeal\n\n“1 cup lard\n\n“1 cup flour\n\n“Melt peanut butter and lard. Add rest of ingredients. (Hubby adds some bird seed, optional.) Birds love it, bird lovers!”\n\nBand Name of the Day: Ooola Oop and Her Hula Hoops\n\nWebsite of the Day, from Double Bogey Mike:\n\nThe Flower Carpet of Brussels, at flowercarpet.be/en"
