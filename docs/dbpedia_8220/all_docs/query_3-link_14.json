        "text": "Category Archives: Soda history\n\nSoda & Softdrink Saturday – Solo\n\nSolo was even sold in Sweden, not many Norwegian products was\n\nin the first decades after WWII\n\nSolo was launched in Norway in 1934. Solo “father” in Norway, Torleif Gulliksrud, worked in the 1930s in the Swedish firm K.B. Nordic Import. It was he who brought his recipe for Solo from Spain to Tønsberg Brewery. The name Solo was taken from the mother drink, “Naranjina Solo” (just orange), which was developed by Dr. Trigo Valencia before it began its flight towards the north. Solo quickly became available nationwide. Solo had until 1960 the largest market share in Norway, but was then overtaken by Coca-Cola. In 1999 it was also overtaken by Pepsi and was no. 3 with a market share of 7 percent. Solo is for many the symbol of Norwegian soda. It contains 8 percent raw orange juice.\n\nThe brand was in 1940 taken over by Nora Factories and became the first national brand of soft drinks in Norway, but production continued at the local soda factories. Producers formed the Solo Association in 1948 and in 1965 the marketing company AS Solo, owned (per 2006) by Ringnes Oslo (again owned by Danish Carlsberg), Oskar Sylte mineral factory in Molde (44% Ringnes-owned), Aass Brewery in Drammen and Mack Brewery Tromso. These bottles and distributes Solo in Norway.\n\nSolo on YouTube\n\nBjørn Thorvaldsen, communication consultant with Ringnes: “It is not we who have posted movies on YouTube, but that the films are on YouTube has to mean that consumers like them. We know that television viewing goes dramatically down, new medias are the future.”\n\nRingnes has no plans on using YouTube, on the other hand it does not seem they need to either –Ted\n\nTo the left: Solo promotion hot air baloon over Spain\n\nTo the right: Solo building the world largest message in a bottle\n\nKlick the images to see the videos\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Tizer\n\nTizer is a red-coloured soft drink sold in the United Kingdom. The name originally comes from the phrase ‘Tizer the Appetizer’. It was launched in 1924 by Fred Pickup of Manchester when it was known as ‘Pickup’s Appetizer’. After the death of Pickup it was owned by the Armour Trust before being sold to the Scottish drinks company A.G. Barr plc. for £2.5 million in 1972. As is the case with Barr’s other famous drink Irn-Bru, Tizer’s exact recipe has not been made public, although a list of ingredients and nutritional data is given on the product’s packaging. In 2003, Tizer decided to sell other-flavoured versions of Tizer, such as “Purple” and “Green” versions There was also a brief “fruitz” variation of Tizer. From 1996 to 2007, Tizer was stylised as T!zer.\n\nIn 2007 they stopped using “Ed the Head” mascot. Tizer was re branded with the slogan ‘Original Great Taste’ and a classic Tizer recipe with fewer additives and no E numbers. It was also given classic 1976 style packaging. However, despite the relaunch making great play of the addition of real fruit juice and the absence of artificial flavourings, colourings and sweeteners, the recipe was reverted in 2009 to remove the real fruit juice and reintroduce natural flavourings, natural colours and sweeteners (Acesulfame-K). Tizer was rebranded in 2011 with a new logo and the slogan “The Great British Pop”.\n\nTizer sponsored a roller coaster in Southport called the ‘Traumatizer’. The ride was closed with the park in 2006 and relocated to Blackpool, where it became known as Infusion.\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – White Rock Beverages\n\nWhite Rock Beverages (White Rock Products Corporation) is an American beverage company located in Whitestone, NY. The company was established in 1871 by pharmacist H.M. Colver in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Potawatomi Indians and settlers believed that the nearby White Rock natural spring had special medicinal powers, so White Rock Beverages started out as destination for vacationers and health seekers. By 1876, the company was bottling and distributing the natural spring water throughout the country.\n\nMarketing with Santa Claus\n\nCoca-Cola is frequently credited with the “invention” of the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in red-and-white garments – however, White Rock predated Coca-Cola’s usage of Santa in advertisements for soft drinks. In 1923, the company used Santa to advertise its ginger ale after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915.\n\nDrink maker history\n\nBy 1923 White Rock Beverages was one of the largest producers of mineral water in the United States. The company also produced ginger ale and other soft drinks. Its property value was then calculated at $7, 311, 767. This included land holdings and bottling plants.\n\nIn 1941 the company which manufactured White Rock soft drinks was called White Rock Mineral Springs Company.\n\nWhite Rock Brand portfolio\n\nSeltzer: Plain, Mandarin Orange, Lemon Lime, Black Cherry, Raspberry\n\nOrganic: Passion Orange, Raspberry Crème,Red Peach\n\nSoda: Cream Soda, Black Cherry, Root Beer, Grape, Orange, Lemon-Lime, Cola\n\nMixers: Club Soda, Diet Ginger Ale, Ginger Ale,Diet Tonic Water, Tonic Water\n\nText from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Jarritos\n\nJarritos (English: “Little Jugs”) is a popular brand of soft drink in Mexico. Jarritos was started by Don Francisco “El Güero” Hill in 1950. The Jarritos brand is currently owned by Novamex, a large independent-bottling conglomerate based in Guadalajara, Jalisco, property of the Hill & ac. Co. although it is also distributed in some areas of Mexico by the Pepsi Bottling Group or Cott.\n\nJarritos is made in fruit flavors and is more carbonated than popular soft drinks made in the United States or Canada. Many Jarritos varieties are naturally flavored. The word “jarrito” means “little jug” in Spanish and refers to the Mexican tradition of drinking water and other drinks in clay pottery jugs. Jarritos comes in 12.5 and 20-ounce glass and plastic as well as 1.5 liter bottles.\n\nHistory\n\nJarritos broke with Mexican soft drink standards by offering a larger 400 ml bottle with a coffee-flavored drink. Shortly after launching the first Jarritos in Mexico City, Francisco Hill developed a process to remove tamarind juice extract to create the first tamarind-flavored soft drink in Mexico: Jarritos Tamarindo. Hill quickly followed with Mandarin, Lemon, and Fruit Punch flavors gaining greater market share and becoming the national soft drink of Mexico. In 10 years, Jarritos became available in 80 percent of Mexico.\n\nIn 1989, the first importation of Jarritos to retail stores in the U.S. began. By 1997, Jarritos became the most popular soft drink in the U.S. among Latino consumers. The 2009 edition of the book Mexico Greatest Brands confirms that each minute 6000 bottles of Jarritos are introduced to the United States.\n\nText from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – La Casera\n\nLa Casera is a traditional Spanish brand of soda. It is one of the most popular soft drinks in Spain.\n\nIt is a sweet fizzy drink known in Spanish-speaking countries as gaseosa. It can be served as a regular soda, although it is also customary to mix it with wine, receiving the name of “Tinto de Verano”, or beer, being called a Clara or Rubia. La Casera is also used to prepare the typical sangria.\n\nThe Company was founded in 1949 by the Duffo family in Madrid and its successful advertising campaigns soon made La Casera one of the leading beverage brands in the country. In Spain, the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any citrus soda, regardless of the brand.\n\nNowadays it is part of the Cadbury-Schweppes group, who bought it in 2001.\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Mission Orange Soda\n\nThe company that created Mission soft drinks went through several name and location changes over the years. Initially, California Crushed Fruit in Los Angeles produced the first soft drinks. Their Mission Orange soft drink was so successful that in 1933 they formed The Mission Dry Corporation and started bottling Mission Orange soda in a unique black bottle. By the 1950’s they had become Mission of California, Inc. with offices based in New Haven, Connecticut. Throughout their total history, they manufactured soft drinks from about 1929 to 1970.\n\nAround 1950 they began putting their soda into 1-quart cone top cans. Some of these cans can be very valuable. One website states that in 2000 a Mission Root Beer quart cone top can went for over $3000 at auction. They also put their soft drinks into flat top cans in the 50’s, but they didn’t really catch on with the consumer until the 60’s.\n\nFlavours that Mission soda was available in included Orange, Lemon-Lime, Coco-Pina, Black Cherry, Cream and Root Beer, among others.\n\nMission soda production was based in California but was bottled all over the US.

Lucozade (along side Ribena) is currently being produced at the Royal Forest Factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean, United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\n\n“Glucozade” was first manufactured in 1927 by William Owen, a chemist fromNewcastle who experimented for several years to provide a source of energy for those who were sick with common illnesses, like the common cold or influenza. It became available throughout Britain for use in hospitals under the name Glucozade. This was changed to Lucozade in 1929.\n\nIn 1953, a factory for the production of Lucozade products was opened in Brentford, England, which, until 2004, had an iconic sign seen on the side of the M4 motorway (now in Gunnersbury Park Museum). Local people were reportedly upset when the sign was removed. A new and identical sign replaced the old sign in 2010.\n\nLucozade has a research arm known as The Lucozade Sports Science Academy, which has been carrying out nutritional research for over 30 years. It works in partnership with leading universities, coaches, nutritionists, and sports professionals.\n\nLucozade was sold in a glass bottle with a Cellophane wrap until 1983, when Lucozade was rebranded as an energy drink to shift the brand’s associations away from illness. The slogan “Lucozade aids recovery” was replaced by “Lucozade replaces lost energy”. The glass bottle was replaced by a plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) one. After the rebranding, between 1984 and 1989 UK sales tripled to almost £75 million.\n\nIn 2013, Lucozade along with Ribena was put up for sale by its founderGlaxoSmithKline. Sir Andrew Witty (Chief Executive of GlaxoSmithKline) said that “there has been a lot of interest for the two brands”. Analysts say that the deal could reach £1bn.\n\n1946 – Carbonated Water Back in Stock / Kullsyreholdig Vann Tilbake på Lager\n\nSparkler, ade and ice cream soda recipes from an ad\n\nfor Canada Dry Water published in 1946\n\nFrom the ad text: The most delicious of summer drinks are yours for the making when you have a big sparkling bottle of Canada Dry Water on hand!

The name was originally introduced in Li’l Abner, a comic strip that ran from 1934 through 1977. Although L’il Abner‘s Kickapoo Joy Juice was an alcoholic drink, the real world beverage is a lightly carbonated soda pop.\n\nLi’l Abner\n\nThe name, “Kickapoo Joy Juice”, was originally coined as a “volatile brew” in Li’l Abner, an American comic strip. Al Capp, the cartoonist, described the drink as “a liquor of such stupefying potency that the hardiest citizens of Dogpatch, after the first burning sip, rose into the air, stiff as frozen codfish”. The concoction was brewed by Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe, two of the comic strip’s backwood poachers. Capp asserted in 1965 that the cartoon “never has suggested that the drink is moonshine”, in response to claims that the Kickapoo Joy Juice of L’il Abner was an illicitly distilled liquor.\n\nProduct\n\nThe real world drink was introduced in 1965 under NuGrape, a former brand of The Monarch Beverage Company. That year, Nugrape worked out a deal with Al Capp, the owner of the “Kickapoo Joy Juice” rights, to produce the beverage as a carbonated soft drink. Capp, however, would have the last word on all advertising and promotion. Kickapoo Joy Juice’s early advertising campaign was very similar to Mountain Dew’s of the time – using characters from L’il Abner to create and market a hillbilly feeling. Although the product is currently distributed largely in Asian markets (Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Bangladesh), the can still comes decorated with a vintage L’il Abner drawing.\n\nText from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Grapico Grape Soda – A Southern Tradition\n\nGrapico is a caffeine free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When introduced in 1914, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it did not. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman’s Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J. Grossman’s Sons’ improper practice of implying that Grapico contained real grape juice and lost the right to use the word “Grapico” to designate their artificial grape drink in 1929.\n\nGrapico was first sold in 1914 in New Orleans, Louisiana by J. Grossman’s Sons. In the Summer of 1917, businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works purchased Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman’s Sons and bottled and sold Grapico to the Alabama soft drink market. Present Grapico distributor Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama, purchased the Grapico business in 1981. The J. Grossman’s Sons’ Grapico retail sales line ended in 1929 and the present Grapico traces its roots to the Summer of 1917 in Birmingham, Alabama through R. R. Rochell’s Grapico.\n\nAlthough the J. Grossman’s Sons line of the brand had ended, the Grapico brand continued on through Alabama businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works. R. R. Rochell had first become a wholesale syrup customer of J. Grossman’s Sons in the Summer of 1917 to serve the Alabama soft drink market. By the time Pan Americanhad lost their artificial grape drink name in 1929, Rochell was selling bottled Grapico in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n\nRochell received the federal trademark on Grapico in 1940, giving his Grapico Company of America the right to use the name “Grapico” everywhere in the United States. In 1955, Grapico Company of America attempted to expand its fruit flavored brands with Orangico, a sister product to Grapico that included real orange juice. The orange juice based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired. In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama. Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999 for an artificially flavored orange drink and introduced Diet Grapico in 2005. Grapico is presently produced at Buffalo Rock’s Columbus, Georgia bottling facility, Sun Fresh Beverages, Inc.\n\nGrapico in popular culture\n\nGrapico is mentioned in Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, 1987 best selling novel by Fannie Flagg. Anne George’s 1996 novel Murder on a Bad Hair Day: A Southern Sisters Mystery, and the 2004 novel Making Waves by Cassandra King, Grapico mixed with Absolut Peppar jalapeño flavored vodka is a drink called the Ex-girlfriend. It’s called the Ex-girlfriend because “it’s sweet and seems like a good idea, but eventually it’s going to burn you and make you sick.” Grapico and coconut rum is called a “grapicolada.”\n\nRead the whole Grapico story on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Almdudler\n\nAlmdudler is the brand name\n\nof a popular Austrian soft drink.\n\nThe original Almdudler is a sweetened carbonated beverage made of grape and apple juice concentrates flavoured with herbs. Its flavour is similar to ginger ale or elderflower cordial, but with a somewhat fruitier and more bitter flavour. Almdudler has been called the “national drink of Austria”. Its popularity in Austria is second only to Coca Cola. About 80 million litres of the beverage are produced per year.\n\nAlmdudler was developed in 1957 by Erwin Klein, who derived the name from the then-common phrase auf der Alm dudeln, which means “singing in the (alpine) meadows”. The drink was originally created and marketed as an alternative to alcoholic beverages or as a mixer for alcoholic drinks. It is currently sold in traditional, light (sugar-free), “still” (uncarbonated), and g’spritzt (mixed with carbonated mineral water) versions. A Radler variety (mixed with beer), is available as Almradler. In the wine-growing regions of eastern Austria, it is a popular mixer with locally produced white wine.\n\nAlmdudler is exported to Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia and the United States.\n\nThe slogan of the Almdudler advertising campaign, in the Austro-Bavarian dialect, has become a well-known phrase in Austria: Wenn de kan Oimdudla haum, geh’ i wieda ham!(Standard German: Wenn die keinen Almdudler haben, gehe ich wieder heim! English: If they don’t have Almdudler, I’ll go back home!) This advertising slogan was written by advertising creative legend and Englishman Simon North while in Austria.\n\nText from Wikipedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Wink Grapefruit Soda\n\nWink is a primarily grapefruit-based soft drink, although it also contains other citrus flavours. It is currently owned and manufactured by Canada Dry in North America, a subsidiary of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. It was introduced by Canada Dry in 1965.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Wink‘s advertising billed it as “The Sassy One”. The jingle went “Wink, it’s the sassy one, from Canada Dry.” For a brief period, Wink introduced a Dr. Seuss-like character called the Wink Gink. There was a Diet Wink Low Calorie version in the mid to late 60’s.\n\nAvailability\n\nIn the United States, Wink is available from some bottlers in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nAdditionally, Wink is also available in some areas of Canada, and is sold as part of the CPlus brand (the Canadian version of Sunkist).\n\nIn 2004 Wink was temporarily discontinued in Canada, as part of a re-launch of the product. Wink was re-introduced several months later as with new packaging as CPlus Wink Twist, a re-formulation that is slightly sweeter than the original.\n\nText from Wikipedia,\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Mello Yello\n\nMello Yello is a high-caffeinated, citrus-flavored soft drink produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company which was introduced on March 1, 1979 to compete with Pepsi’s Mountain Dew.\n\nMello Yello was withdrawn from Australia in the early 1990s, being replaced with the similar but uncaffeinated Lift.\n\nThere have been three flavored variants of Mello Yello in North America. Mello Yello Cherry was released in response to Mountain Dew Code Red. The other two variants were Mello Yello Afterglow (peach-flavored) and Mello Yello Melon. All three were only available for a limited time.\n\nIn early 2010, Coca-Cola announced new images of new packaging that it would be re-branding Mello Yello to resemble the packaging in 1979. This re-branding has included an expanded distribution of the product, into such areas of the United States that have not had the product in years such as the Northeast United States and the Western United States. In 2011, Mello Yello began to replace Vault on Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\n\nText from Wikipedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Clicquot Club Ginger Ale\n\nThe Clicquot Club Company, also known as Clicquot Club Beverages, pronounced “Klee-Ko” and sometimes spelled “Cliquot”, was a national beverage company that sold several varieties of soda. After 80 years of operation, the company was bought and shut down by Canada Dry in 1965.\n\nFounded in 1881 in Millis, Massachusetts, the beverage company was built by Henry Millis from money he had received from his father Lansing Millis. The company produced mainly sparkling cider for the first few years but later on Millis would experiment in other flavors as well. The sparkling cider was soon dropped and the company began focusing mainly on ginger ale. In 1885, the town of Millis was founded in his family name. During this time the soda company hired a significant amount of the town’s residents and would continue to do so for years to come. Millis continued to improve upon his beverages through his philosophy of making the drinks as though he were making them for his own friends. He imported high-quality exotic ingredients including Jamaican ginger, and Cuban pure refined sugar. These two were the key ingredients to his ginger ale making the company stand out in this field.\n\nEven though word of his soda spread over southeastern New England in the next few years, the cost of such fine ingredients eventually forced Henry Millis to sell his company in 1901. The new proprietors took advantage of every form of advertising, including a musical variety radio program, The Clicquot Club Eskimos, led by banjo player Harry F. Reser. Such clever marketing expanded the company until the factory in Millis became 1/3 of a mile long, even with its own private train station. The section around this massive factory became known as “Millis-Clicquot, Massachusetts.” Even with this huge building the company still staggered to meet its demand. In 1938 the company became the first to sell its beverages in a can, at this time known as a “cone-top” can, making it easier to manufacture. With the establishment of a new network of Clicquot Club Bottling Plants in 1938 the company soon had dozens of factories across the country. This number grew rapidly until in 1952 the company had plants in over 100 cities all across the United States, from Maine to California. In the 1950s the company began distributing internationally, in places such as Nassau, Jamaica, the Bahamas, virtually all of South America, and the Philippines. The company began to decline in sales worldwide thanks to other soft drinks and was purchased in 1960 by the Cott Beverage Corporation of Connecticut. By 1965, the Cott Corporation was acquired by Canada Dry, who sold off all product surplus before shutting down Clicquot. Today the original plant in Millis remains mostly abandoned, although one-third of it is (as of June 2006) occupied by garden and hardware stores. Although there has been contemplation of starting the company back up again in recent years, no attempts have ever gotten further than the drawing board.\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Gold Spot\n\nGold Spot was one of the three brands of carbonated soft drink started in India by Parle under the initiative of its founder Ramesh Chauhan in 1977 after the exit of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo from the Indian market. Gold Spot was introduced along with Thums Up and Limca.\n\nIt was artificially flavoured and coloured orange. Parle sold Gold Spot along with Thums Up, Limca, Citra and Maaza to Coca-Cola in 1993 (which had just relaunched in the Indian market), reportedly for $ 40 million. In spite of its wide popularity, Gold Spot was withdrawn by Coke from the market in order to re-make space for Coca-Cola’s Fanta brand.\n\nGold Spot had a catchy punch line – “The Zing Thing.”\n\nAs per data available from the Ministry of Food Processing Industries of India (MoFPI), Gold Spot has a market share of 2% among all soft drink companies (Cola + Non-Cola drink Manufacturers) during the year 2009-10.\n\nText from Wikipedia\n\nYet another popular local soda tried killed by Coca-Cola Co. – Ted 😦"
