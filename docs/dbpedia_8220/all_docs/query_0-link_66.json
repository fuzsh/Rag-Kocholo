It also helps citrus-flavored drinks maintain their citrus taste.\n\nFor all the news that the Hudson Valley is sharing make sure to follow Hudson Valley Post on Facebook, download the Hudson Valley Post Mobile\n\nFound In Over 70 Protects Sold In The United States\n\nMany beverage makers already reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient.
