        "text": "As someone who isn't the biggest fan of soda (or pop as Iowans call it) this isn't too devastating to me.\n\nGrowing up, the main drink that my parents would place on the dinner table in front of my plate would be water or apple juice. I drank so many of those Juicy Juice boxes as a kid, I swear my blood must've been made up of 80% apple juice.\n\nWhile I'm not the biggest fan of soda/pop, I know plenty of people who love it. When I moved out to Iowa three years ago, I quickly learned that people in the Midwest are obsessed with one of these drinks!\n\nUnhealthiest Drinks on the Planet\n\nA new study came out from the website EatThis that ranked \"The 25 Unhealthiest Drinks on the Planet.\"\n\nThis entire list is ranked based off of sugar and how much of it is in these drinks. (47%).\n\nMen should be consuming nine teaspoons of added sugar a day, and women should be consuming six teaspoons.\n\nLet's put that into perspective...\n\nThe average twelve-ounce soda can contain about eight teaspoons of this added sugar. According to the AHA, that's about 32 grams.\n\nIowa's Favorite Drink Ain't Gonna Cut It\n\nA few years ago, we determined Iowa's favorite pops!\n\nAnd unsurprisingly, the ultimate soft drink in Iowa is....\n\n*drumroll*\n\nMOUNTAIN DEW!\n\nThe drink was originally made in Tennessee back in the 1940s and has become a huge staple for any Midwesterner's fridge.\n\nAccording to the report from EatThis, Mountain Dew is the seventh unhealthiest drink on this list. The average bottle has about forty-six grams of added sugar.\n\nWhat Are Some of the Other Drinks on this List?\n\nNaked Mighty Mango Juice, 57 grams of sugar\n\nNaked Blue Machine Juice, 55 grams of sugar\n\nMonster Energy Drink, 54 grams of sugar\n\nAriZona Sweet Tea, 53 grams of sugar\n\nNaked Green Machine, 53 grams of sugar\n\nStarbucks Frappucino, 47 grams of sugar\n\nMountain Dew, 46 grams of sugar\n\nWelch's Grape Juice, 44 grams of sugar\n\nBarq's Root Beer, 44 grams of sugar\n\nAriZona Green Tea, 42 grams of sugar\n\nStay up to date with everything going on in Eastern Iowa by downloading the free station app from your app store.
