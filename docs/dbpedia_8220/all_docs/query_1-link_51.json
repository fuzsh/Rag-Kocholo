        "text": "Soft drink giant Coca-Cola is acquiring the beloved New England soda Moxie.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Coca-Cola is acquiring the brand from Cocoa-Cola of Northern New England, and independent bottling partner based in Bedford, New Hampshire.\n\nMoxie, which has been around since the 19th century, was one of the first mass-produced soft drinks in the United States. It is the official state beverage of Maine.\n\nThe AP reported that bottling of the soda will remain in New Hampshire. The soda is also bottled under a licensing agreement by Worcester-based Polar Beverages, which produces much of the Moxie sold in Massachusetts. MassLive has reached out to the company for comment.\n\nWashington-based Orca Beverages also bottles Moxie, using glass bottles and cane sugar as the original recipe called for. When reached by phone Tuesday, an employee said the company just learned about the sale and is not sure whether it will affect their operations. The Orca Beverages-bottled Moxie is also available at Cracker Barrel shops.\n\nCoca-Cola declined to disclose the price of the sale to the AP. The sale is expected to close later this year.\n\nMoxie was invented by Dr. Augustin Thompson, a Civil War veteran from Union, Maine who first produced the drink as a cure-all nerve tonic. It was first bottled for the masses in 1884 and has a storied history in Massachusetts, where the company headquarters existed for much of the 20th Century, first in Lowell and then later at a huge bottling plant in Roxbury called Moxieland.\n\nThe drink outsold Coca-Cola in the 1920s and was a pioneer in using sports figures to advertise its product. Reproductions of the company's famous \"Make mine Moxie\" ads with Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams are still popular today.\n\nIn the 1960s the company was acquired by Atlanta, Georgia-based Monarch Beverage Corporation, which owned a variety of regional soft drinks such as Kickapoo Joy Juice. The company ceased national advertising, but continued with a strong and loyal following in its birthplace in New England.\n\nIn 2007 Monarch sold the company to Cornucopia Beverages of Bedford, New Hampshire, returning ownership once again to New England. Cornucopia changed its name to the Moxie Beverage Company in 2007, fully embracing the brand, and was viewed by many fans of the drink as good steward of the product. The company briefly changed the labels of the drink after purchasing it, eliminating the classic \"Moxie Man\" logo. After public outcry the company quickly reversed its decision and brought back the iconic Moxie Man that remains on the bottles today.\n\nA Moxie Festival is held every year in Lisbon Falls, Maine, and draws thousands, but has been run independently of the brand owner.\n\n________"
