        "text": "Well, I have decided to write about Kickapoo Joy Juice, and I’m already regretting it. Sentence one, and I have all but given up hope. You see, usually there isn’t much documentation on these sodas I write about, so I can just make stuff up. There is an abundance of information about Kickapoo Joy Juice, however, so I may actually have to do a little bit of work. Oh well, here we go…\n\nKickapoo Joy Juice was introduced as a fictional drink in the cartoon strip, “Li’l Abner” in 1934. It was alcoholic and claimed, “A liquor of such stupefying potency that the hardiest citizens of Dogpatch, after the first burning sip, rose into the air, stiff as a frozen codfish.” And also, that the fumes alone were strong enough to melt the rivets off battleships. My favorite part about Kickapoo Joy Juice is that it was supposedly brewed by Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat, who certainly would not pass the political correctness standards of today. These dudes were backwoods poachers and of course Hairless Joe has tons of hair and Lonesome Polecat looks like the offensive Cleveland Indians’ mascot.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kickapoo Joy Juice no longer sports the two awesome poachers on the label, which is a big strike against it in my book. Sure, the name is great, but it looks like any other soda now. You see where progress gets you? Dumb, that’s where.\n\nAs far as the flavor goes, it definitely will get put in the Mountain Dew category. It has a touch of lemon, a touch of lime, and just a hint of Mom’s basement LAN Halo 2 Capture the Flag.\n\nYou can get this soda or many other weird flavors seven days a week at B & G Tasty Foods. There is no Mountain Dew on tap, so just get this one and be happy. If you really like it, you can find all sorts of goofy stuff on eBay related to it."
