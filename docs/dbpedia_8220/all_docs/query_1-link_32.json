        "text": "Tag Archives: Drikkehistorie\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – White Rock Beverages\n\nWhite Rock Beverages (White Rock Products Corporation) is an American beverage company located in Whitestone, NY. The company was established in 1871 by pharmacist H.M. Colver in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Potawatomi Indians and settlers believed that the nearby White Rock natural spring had special medicinal powers, so White Rock Beverages started out as destination for vacationers and health seekers. By 1876, the company was bottling and distributing the natural spring water throughout the country.\n\nMarketing with Santa Claus\n\nCoca-Cola is frequently credited with the “invention” of the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in red-and-white garments – however, White Rock predated Coca-Cola’s usage of Santa in advertisements for soft drinks. In 1923, the company used Santa to advertise its ginger ale after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915.\n\nDrink maker history\n\nBy 1923 White Rock Beverages was one of the largest producers of mineral water in the United States. The company also produced ginger ale and other soft drinks. Its property value was then calculated at $7, 311, 767. This included land holdings and bottling plants.\n\nIn 1941 the company which manufactured White Rock soft drinks was called White Rock Mineral Springs Company.\n\nWhite Rock Brand portfolio\n\nSeltzer: Plain, Mandarin Orange, Lemon Lime, Black Cherry, Raspberry\n\nOrganic: Passion Orange, Raspberry Crème,Red Peach\n\nSoda: Cream Soda, Black Cherry, Root Beer, Grape, Orange, Lemon-Lime, Cola\n\nMixers: Club Soda, Diet Ginger Ale, Ginger Ale,Diet Tonic Water, Tonic Water\n\nText from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda &Soft Drink Saturday – Lucozade\n\nLucozade is an umbrella name for a series of energy and sports drinks that are produced by GlaxoSmithKline. Lucozade (along side Ribena) is currently being produced at the Royal Forest Factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean, United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\n\n“Glucozade” was first manufactured in 1927 by William Owen, a chemist fromNewcastle who experimented for several years to provide a source of energy for those who were sick with common illnesses, like the common cold or influenza. It became available throughout Britain for use in hospitals under the name Glucozade. This was changed to Lucozade in 1929.\n\nIn 1953, a factory for the production of Lucozade products was opened in Brentford, England, which, until 2004, had an iconic sign seen on the side of the M4 motorway (now in Gunnersbury Park Museum). Local people were reportedly upset when the sign was removed. A new and identical sign replaced the old sign in 2010.\n\nLucozade has a research arm known as The Lucozade Sports Science Academy, which has been carrying out nutritional research for over 30 years. It works in partnership with leading universities, coaches, nutritionists, and sports professionals.\n\nLucozade was sold in a glass bottle with a Cellophane wrap until 1983, when Lucozade was rebranded as an energy drink to shift the brand’s associations away from illness. The slogan “Lucozade aids recovery” was replaced by “Lucozade replaces lost energy”. The glass bottle was replaced by a plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) one. After the rebranding, between 1984 and 1989 UK sales tripled to almost £75 million.\n\nIn 2013, Lucozade along with Ribena was put up for sale by its founderGlaxoSmithKline. Sir Andrew Witty (Chief Executive of GlaxoSmithKline) said that “there has been a lot of interest for the two brands”. Analysts say that the deal could reach £1bn.\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Kickapoo Joy Juice\n\nKickapoo Joy Juice is a citrus-flavoured soft drink brand owned by The Monarch Beverage Company. The name was originally introduced in Li’l Abner, a comic strip that ran from 1934 through 1977. Although L’il Abner‘s Kickapoo Joy Juice was an alcoholic drink, the real world beverage is a lightly carbonated soda pop.\n\nLi’l Abner\n\nThe name, “Kickapoo Joy Juice”, was originally coined as a “volatile brew” in Li’l Abner, an American comic strip. Al Capp, the cartoonist, described the drink as “a liquor of such stupefying potency that the hardiest citizens of Dogpatch, after the first burning sip, rose into the air, stiff as frozen codfish”. The concoction was brewed by Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe, two of the comic strip’s backwood poachers. Capp asserted in 1965 that the cartoon “never has suggested that the drink is moonshine”, in response to claims that the Kickapoo Joy Juice of L’il Abner was an illicitly distilled liquor.\n\nProduct\n\nThe real world drink was introduced in 1965 under NuGrape, a former brand of The Monarch Beverage Company. That year, Nugrape worked out a deal with Al Capp, the owner of the “Kickapoo Joy Juice” rights, to produce the beverage as a carbonated soft drink. Capp, however, would have the last word on all advertising and promotion. Kickapoo Joy Juice’s early advertising campaign was very similar to Mountain Dew’s of the time – using characters from L’il Abner to create and market a hillbilly feeling. Although the product is currently distributed largely in Asian markets (Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Bangladesh), the can still comes decorated with a vintage L’il Abner drawing.\n\nText from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Grapico Grape Soda – A Southern Tradition\n\nGrapico is a caffeine free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When introduced in 1914, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it did not. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman’s Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J. Grossman’s Sons’ improper practice of implying that Grapico contained real grape juice and lost the right to use the word “Grapico” to designate their artificial grape drink in 1929.\n\nGrapico was first sold in 1914 in New Orleans, Louisiana by J. Grossman’s Sons. In the Summer of 1917, businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works purchased Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman’s Sons and bottled and sold Grapico to the Alabama soft drink market. Present Grapico distributor Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama, purchased the Grapico business in 1981. The J. Grossman’s Sons’ Grapico retail sales line ended in 1929 and the present Grapico traces its roots to the Summer of 1917 in Birmingham, Alabama through R. R. Rochell’s Grapico.\n\nAlthough the J. Grossman’s Sons line of the brand had ended, the Grapico brand continued on through Alabama businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works. R. R. Rochell had first become a wholesale syrup customer of J. Grossman’s Sons in the Summer of 1917 to serve the Alabama soft drink market. By the time Pan Americanhad lost their artificial grape drink name in 1929, Rochell was selling bottled Grapico in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n\nRochell received the federal trademark on Grapico in 1940, giving his Grapico Company of America the right to use the name “Grapico” everywhere in the United States. In 1955, Grapico Company of America attempted to expand its fruit flavored brands with Orangico, a sister product to Grapico that included real orange juice. The orange juice based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired. In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama. Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999 for an artificially flavored orange drink and introduced Diet Grapico in 2005. Grapico is presently produced at Buffalo Rock’s Columbus, Georgia bottling facility, Sun Fresh Beverages, Inc.\n\nGrapico in popular culture\n\nGrapico is mentioned in Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, 1987 best selling novel by Fannie Flagg. Anne George’s 1996 novel Murder on a Bad Hair Day: A Southern Sisters Mystery, and the 2004 novel Making Waves by Cassandra King, Grapico mixed with Absolut Peppar jalapeño flavored vodka is a drink called the Ex-girlfriend. It’s called the Ex-girlfriend because “it’s sweet and seems like a good idea, but eventually it’s going to burn you and make you sick.” Grapico and coconut rum is called a “grapicolada.”\n\nRead the whole Grapico story on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSwitchel; the Original Energy-Ade\n\nAn 18th century energydrink found on savouringthepast.net\n\nJas. Townsend and Son who runs SavouringThePast writes What do you drink if you’re worn out and need a little kick? An Ade, soda, an energy boost? In the 18th century, before supermarkets had shelves lined with this stuff, many people drank a delicious beverage called Switchel.\n\nBeverages similar to Switchel date all the way back to ancient Greece, and were drank all the way around the world. This recipe was typical of those popular in America from New England all the way to the Caribbean.\n\nOf course regional influences made for local flares. In Vermont, for example, Switchel was made with Maple Syrup and mixed with oatmeal. (The oatmeal was eaten as a snack once the beverage was finished.) While in Trinidad the drink was almost always mixed with special branches from the quararibea turbinata plant. (Also known as the swizzlestick tree.)\n\n–\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Wink Grapefruit Soda\n\nWink is a primarily grapefruit-based soft drink, although it also contains other citrus flavours. It is currently owned and manufactured by Canada Dry in North America, a subsidiary of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. It was introduced by Canada Dry in 1965.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Wink‘s advertising billed it as “The Sassy One”. The jingle went “Wink, it’s the sassy one, from Canada Dry.” For a brief period, Wink introduced a Dr. Seuss-like character called the Wink Gink. There was a Diet Wink Low Calorie version in the mid to late 60’s.\n\nAvailability\n\nIn the United States, Wink is available from some bottlers in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nAdditionally, Wink is also available in some areas of Canada, and is sold as part of the CPlus brand (the Canadian version of Sunkist).\n\nIn 2004 Wink was temporarily discontinued in Canada, as part of a re-launch of the product. Wink was re-introduced several months later as with new packaging as CPlus Wink Twist, a re-formulation that is slightly sweeter than the original.\n\nText from Wikipedia,\n\nSoda & Soft Drink Saturday – Clicquot Club Ginger Ale\n\nThe Clicquot Club Company, also known as Clicquot Club Beverages, pronounced “Klee-Ko” and sometimes spelled “Cliquot”, was a national beverage company that sold several varieties of soda. After 80 years of operation, the company was bought and shut down by Canada Dry in 1965.\n\nFounded in 1881 in Millis, Massachusetts, the beverage company was built by Henry Millis from money he had received from his father Lansing Millis. The company produced mainly sparkling cider for the first few years but later on Millis would experiment in other flavors as well. The sparkling cider was soon dropped and the company began focusing mainly on ginger ale. In 1885, the town of Millis was founded in his family name. During this time the soda company hired a significant amount of the town’s residents and would continue to do so for years to come. Millis continued to improve upon his beverages through his philosophy of making the drinks as though he were making them for his own friends. He imported high-quality exotic ingredients including Jamaican ginger, and Cuban pure refined sugar. These two were the key ingredients to his ginger ale making the company stand out in this field.\n\nEven though word of his soda spread over southeastern New England in the next few years, the cost of such fine ingredients eventually forced Henry Millis to sell his company in 1901. The new proprietors took advantage of every form of advertising, including a musical variety radio program, The Clicquot Club Eskimos, led by banjo player Harry F. Reser. Such clever marketing expanded the company until the factory in Millis became 1/3 of a mile long, even with its own private train station. The section around this massive factory became known as “Millis-Clicquot, Massachusetts.” Even with this huge building the company still staggered to meet its demand. In 1938 the company became the first to sell its beverages in a can, at this time known as a “cone-top” can, making it easier to manufacture. With the establishment of a new network of Clicquot Club Bottling Plants in 1938 the company soon had dozens of factories across the country. This number grew rapidly until in 1952 the company had plants in over 100 cities all across the United States, from Maine to California. In the 1950s the company began distributing internationally, in places such as Nassau, Jamaica, the Bahamas, virtually all of South America, and the Philippines. The company began to decline in sales worldwide thanks to other soft drinks and was purchased in 1960 by the Cott Beverage Corporation of Connecticut. By 1965, the Cott Corporation was acquired by Canada Dry, who sold off all product surplus before shutting down Clicquot. Today the original plant in Millis remains mostly abandoned, although one-third of it is (as of June 2006) occupied by garden and hardware stores. Although there has been contemplation of starting the company back up again in recent years, no attempts have ever gotten further than the drawing board.\n\nThe History of Bovril\n\nBovril is the trademarked name of a thick, salty meat extract, developed in the 1870s by John Lawson Johnston. It is sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar. Bovril is made in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire; owned and distributed by Unilever UK.\n\nBovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water, or less commonly, with milk. It can be used as a flavouring for soups, stews or porridge, or spread on bread, especially on toast in a similar fashion to Marmite and Vegemite.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1870, in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III ordered one million cans of beef to feed his troops. The task of providing all this beef went to a Scotsman living in Canada named John Lawson Johnston. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as ‘Johnston’s Fluid Beef’, later called Bovril, to meet the needs of Napoleon III. By 1888, over 3,000 UK public houses, grocers and dispensing chemists were selling Bovril. In 1889, the Bovril Company was formed.\n\nBovril continued to function as a “war food” in World War I and was frequently mentioned in the 1930 account “Not So Quiet… Stepdaughters of War” by Helen Zenna Smith (Evadne Price). One account from the book describes it being prepared for the casualties at Mons where “the orderlies were just beginning to make Bovril for the wounded, when the bearers and ambulance wagons were shelled as they were bringing the wounded into the hospital”.\n\nA thermos of beef tea was the favoured way to fend off the chill of winter matches for generations of British football enthusiasts; to this day, Bovril dissolved in hot water is sold in stadiums all over the United Kingdom. Bovril beef tea was the main warm drink that Ernest Shackleton’s team had to drink when they were marooned on Elephant Island during the Endurance Expedition.\n\nWhen John Lawson Johnston died, his son George Lawson Johnston inherited and took over the Bovril business. In 1929, George Lawson Johnston was created Baron Luke, of Pavenham, in the county of Bedford.\n\nBovril’s instant beef stock was launched in 1966 and its “King of Beef” range of instant flavours for stews, casseroles and gravy in 1971. In 1971, Cavenham Foods acquired the Bovril Company but then sold most of its dairies and South American operations to finance further take-overs. The brand is now owned by Unilever.\n\nBovril holds the unusual position of having been advertised with a Pope. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted Pope Leo XIII seated on his throne, bearing a mug of Bovril. The campaign slogan read: The Two Infallible Powers – The Pope & Bovril (See picture #2 at the top of the post).\n\nCultural significance\n\nSince its invention, Bovril has become an icon of British culture. It is commonly associated with football culture, since during the winter British football fans (mainly in local league level or division two) in stadium terraces often drink it from thermoses (or disposable cups in Scotland, where thermoses are banned from football stadiums).’\n\nDuring a 2011 episode of Top Gear, James May drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a snowplough in Norway and commented: “We all know that when it’s snowing and it’s cold you have Bovril. That’s a rule of life.” Bovril reappeared in another episode of Top Gear in the form of Jeremy Clarkson’s V8 Food Blender, wherein it was used to make a “Man’s V8 Smoothie” complete with raw beef and brick.\n\nText from Wikipedia"
