        "text": "Growing up in Texas, especially the Texas Panhandle this particular beverage was always around. When it comes to growing up as adults you tend to look back on your childhood and think of the things that made you happy or were a highlight of so many memories when you were a kid.\n\nWe've always had the name brands of soft drinks, and there has always been a battle of who is the best, Coke or Pepsi. In Texas, and now all over, Dr. Pepper was also a thing. Long before there were knockoff beverages created by every company there was one brand that was a big part of most of our childhood memories.\n\nShasta\n\nShasta came in every flavor under the sun. From grape to cherry, orange to root beer, cola, and even diet. The fun thing about Shasta was you bought them individually, and they were cheaper than any soda so you could get more for your money, and they tasted great.\n\nYou could find Shasta in a cooler at just about any family get-together, from picnics to barbeques, church functions, the pool, the beach, and all around the neighborhood.\n\nIf you were lucky your parents or grandparents let you pick out your favorite flavors at the store.\n\nEven though this seemed like a Texas thing Shasta was nationwide, the first soft drink Shasta made was Ginger Ale in 1931. However, Shasta was very alive in the homes of most Texans back in the day. It was the taste of childhood for those that grew up in the 80s and early 90s.\n\nShasta is still available today, although it looks slightly different from how it did in childhood. Nowadays, instead of opting for Shasta as a more affordable alternative to branded sodas, there are several options for cheaper, non-branded sodas."
