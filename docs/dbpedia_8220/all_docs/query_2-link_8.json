        "text": "Another beverage given to me by the MMAgician and hailing from Singapore is Kickapoo Joy Juice. Judging by the green and yellow coloration of the can I’m going to assume this is similar to a Mountain Dew (or MTN DEW) product. Now on the can and this where it gets weird, are two characters from the now defunct comic strip Li’l Abner. Character number one is “Lonesome Polecat”. Lonesome Polecat is drawn how you would think a Native American would be drawn back when Li’l Abner was a comic strip. That would be from 1934-1977 for reference. The second character in charge of making this Kickapoo Joy Juice is “Hairless Joe”. Hairless Joe is a caveman that lives in modern times. He’s got a giant club, a leopard skin outfit, and even though his name suggests it he is most certainly not hairless. Now that you know the cast of characters let me tell you what they’re doing on this logo. Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe seem to be sitting in a tub of Kickapoo Joy Juice that has created an explosion so large (a mushroom cloud is visible) that they have rocketed themselves out of Earth’s orbit. Underneath said picture read the words “Original USA Joy Juice Recipe”. So at least we know we’re getting the real deal here. The ingredients are as follows, Carbonated Water, Sucrose, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Stabilizers (what?), Flavouring, Preservative, Colour E102, and Caffeine. With all that said, let’s try out some of Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe’s mixture… which according to the Li’l Aber Wiki page is made in a cave.\n\nAs I assumed this is certainly a Mountain Dew-esque beverage, or at least the smell would have me believe that. If I had to pick a scent which stands out over the other citrus aromas that are escaping the can I’d go with lemon. Time to hopefully enjoy my 10.9 fluid ounces of Kickapoo Joy Juice!\n\nThe top of this can reads “Get That Kick!” and I certainly would have loved to have “Gotten it” but it’s not in the cards for Kickapoo Joy Juice. Kickapoo Joy Juice, which I enjoy typing out, tastes like a diluted Mountain Dew. If it were just a diluted Mountain Dew I could probably sign off on it fairly easily but there’s more. With every drink there’s another flavor, sorry, flavour that sits on your tongue like a fat cat sits on a warm windowsill. While this flavour isn’t horrible it is unmoving and very noticeable to me. The rest of your mouth becomes a moderately fun party with each sip and your tongue is the grouchy neighbor downstairs who keeps ruining it through various means… and begin scene using characters from Zelda.\n\nLink - “Hey guys! Ummmm, no one could really make it to the party today, so I’m glad you came. Want to drag out the old pop-o-matic bubble for a rousing game of Trouble?”\n\n**knock knock knock**\n\n“Oh hi officer, what can I do for you?”\n\nOfficer Armos - “We got a call from the Old Man downstairs saying that you were making far too much noise up here.”\n\nLink – “But we were just about to play a bo….”\n\nOfficer Armos – “I don’t really care; just keep it down would you?”\n\nLink – “Ok, sorry [closes door]. So where were we?\n\nZelda – “Actually Link I think Ganon and I are gonna head out.\n\nLink – “…but he’s going to kidna… nevermind. Just make sure he doesn’t get all feely with your triforce.”\n\nAaaand scene! Ok, that example that went on for too long was more enjoyable than the flavor that is still sitting on my tongue. I guess the best way to describe Kickapoo Joy Juice is this. Kickapoo Joy Juice is a soda. It’s nothing special in the slightest but still consumable.\n\n~A"
