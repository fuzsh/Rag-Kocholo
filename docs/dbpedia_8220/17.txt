A new addition to Cracker Barrel Retail Stores, Monarch Beverage’s Kickapoo Joy Juice now is available in 635 Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores in 42 states. The citrus-flavored carbonated soft drink is made with real sugar and natural flavors, the company says. Kickapoo Joy Juice was inspired by Al Capp’s comic strip “Li’l Abner,” which appeared in U.S. newspapers from 1934 to 1977, the company says. The name originally was coined by Capp and described in the comic strip as “a volatile brew,” it adds. Packaged in green 12-ounce glass bottles, Kickapoo Joy Juice retails in Cracker Barrel stores for $1.49 a bottle.
