        "text": "Security and storage giant Symantec has announced the acquisition of cloud email archiving company LiveOffice. The acquisition price was $115 million.\n\nLiveOffice is a SaaS provider of email archiving, compliance and hosting. In addition to providing cloud based email archiving, LiveOffice also archives email which is on-premise. By hosting email archives with LiveOffice, customers can migrate from their current provider to a cloud provider without having to deal with the possibility of losing sensitive information.\n\nNot only does LiveOffice archive your email, but if a client’s primary cloud-based hosting service experiences an outage, it doubles as a backup. If an email provider does experience an outage, LiveOffice’s users are still able to send and receive messages, including attachments, from the archive while the provider is down.\n\nFounded in 1998, LiveOffice has 20,000 clients and processes and protects millions of messages a day. The company’s backers include Summit Partners. LiveOffice CEO Nick Mehta was a former Symantec exec, and served as vice president and general manager of the Enterprise Vault information archiving and discovery software business at the company."
