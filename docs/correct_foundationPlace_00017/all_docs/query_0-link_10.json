        "text": "An example of a matching gift in action would be a donor, who works for Intuit, who donates $100 to Fairwood Explorer Alliance. The donor then submits the proper matching gift forms to his employer's HR department or through an exclusive employee portal. Intuit receives the request and matches the donation 1:1 by writing a check for $100 to Fairwood Explorer Alliance.\n\nAsk your HR department if your company provides matching funds for charitable donations today!\n\nVolunteer Grants\n\nWhat is a Volunteer Grant?\n\nVolunteer grant programs are corporate giving programs created to encourage volunteerism in communities where employees live and work. Through these programs, companies provide monetary grants to organizations where employees volunteer on a regular basis. Companies either provide a set monetary donation for every hour an employee volunteers or provide grants once employees reach certain thresholds.
