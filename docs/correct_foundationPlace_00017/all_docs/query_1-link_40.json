        "text": "Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC) has been named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, a leading international think-tank dedicated to the creation, advancement, and sharing of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility, anti-corruption and sustainability. The complete list of rankings can be found at http://www.ethisphere.com/wme/.\n\n“Ethics and compliance requires participation by employees at all levels of the organization. At Symantec, we’ve devoted resources and energy to building a strong ethical corporate culture and we continually assess our programs and evaluate what we can and should be doing better,” said Enrique Salem, president and CEO at Symantec. “Receiving this award for the fifth consecutive year is an endorsement that we are doing things right. It sets an expectation for our employees and other stakeholders that we will continue to work on building a culture of ethics and integrity and exercise good business judgment.”\n\nAt Symantec, ethics and integrity are the foundation of the company’s business success. The company strives to demonstrate innovation and leadership in corporate governance, compliance, sustainability, and corporate responsibility, with the goal of continuously improving ethics and compliance programs and policies. Learn more about our global corporate responsibility initiatives at http://www.symantec.com/corporate_responsibility/.\n\nIn its sixth year, the World’s Most Ethical Companies list highlights companies exhibiting a strong commitment to ethical leadership and compliance practices. The companies chosen go beyond making statements about doing business “ethically” and translate those words into action, introducing innovative ideas to benefit the public and compelling their competitors to follow suit. They incorporate ethics into business practices and have been able to thrive despite an ever-changing global regulatory environment. Ethisphere reviewed nominations from companies in more than 100 countries and 36 industries and the methodology includes reviewing codes of ethics, litigation, and regulatory infraction histories; evaluating the investment in innovation and sustainable business practices; analyzing activities designed to improve corporate citizenship; and studying nominations from senior executives, industry peers, suppliers, and customers.\n\n“Symantec recognizes that a strong ethics program is a key component to a successful business model and over the last five years we have really watched this come to life as they continually scrutinize their ethical standards to keep up with an ever-changing regulatory environment,” said Alex Brigham, executive director of the Ethisphere Institute. “Each year the competition for World’s Most Ethical Companies intensifies as the number of nominations submitted for consideration grows. Ethisphere congratulates Symantec on being one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for 2012.”\n\nIn addition, Symantec was also recently recognized in Brazil by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the “Best Companies to Work For,” and also by ComputerWorld magazine as one of the “Top IT and Telecom Companies” in the country.\n\nAbout Symantec\n\nSymantec is a global leader in providing security, storage and systems management solutions to help consumers and organizations secure and manage their information-driven world.
