Our engineers applied the patches all the time on our sharepoint server for Symantec.\n\nOnly thing you have to make sure that they exclude certain folders from AV scanning. here is the KB\n\nBut if you have an opportunity to test it in different farm then do the testing 1st.\n\nanswered Mar 30, 2017 at 12:53\n\nWaqas Sarwar MVPâ™¦Waqas Sarwar MVP\n\n56.9k1717 gold badges4343 silver badges7979 bronze badges"
