        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom, Inc., (NASDAQ: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today announced an agreement to acquire the enterprise security business of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) for $10.7 billion in cash. The addition of Symantec's enterprise security portfolio will significantly expand Broadcom's infrastructure software footprint as it continues to build one of the world's leading infrastructure technology companies.\n\nHock Tan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom, said, \"M&A has played a central role in Broadcom's growth strategy and this transaction represents the next logical step in our strategy following our acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies. Symantec's enterprise security business is recognized as an established leader in the growing enterprise security space and has developed some of the world's most powerful defense solutions that protect against today's evolving threat landscape and secure data from endpoint to cloud. We look forward to expanding our footprint of mission critical infrastructure software within our core Global 2000 customer base.\"\n\nWith product lines across endpoint security, web security services, cloud security and data loss prevention, Symantec's enterprise security business offers its customers a best-in-class suite of integrated enterprise security solutions. Deploying Symantec's enterprise security suite through Broadcom's channels will strengthen its differentiated portfolio license agreement (PLA) strategy of offering significant overall savings to customers, while creating a predictable, recurring revenue stream for its business that will drive returns for shareholders.\n\nThe transaction is expected to drive more than $2 billion of sustainable, incremental, run-rate revenues and approximately $1.3 billion of Pro Forma EBITDA, including synergies. The transaction is expected to generate more than $1 billion of run-rate cost synergies within 12 months following close. Additionally, Broadcom expects to achieve double-digit cash-on-cash returns on its investment.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nUnder the terms of the asset purchase agreement, which has been approved by the Broadcom Board of Directors, Broadcom will pay Symantec$10.7 billion in cash at closing. Broadcom intends to fund the transaction with proceeds from new committed debt financing.\n\nBroadcom expects its current dividend policy of delivering 50% of its prior fiscal year free cash flow to shareholders to remain unchanged. However, Broadcom now intends to utilize excess cash flow beyond its dividend payments to focus on rapidly paying down debt as opposed to stock repurchases. Broadcom believes access to the investment grade credit market is fundamental to its strategy and fully intends to maintain its investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of Broadcom's fiscal year 20201, is subject to regulatory approvals in the U.S., EU and Japan and other customary closing conditions.\n\nFollowing the closing of the transaction, Broadcom will own and incorporate the Symantec brand name into the Broadcom portfolio.\n\nReaffirms Fiscal Year 2019 Revenue Guidance\n\nBroadcom today also reaffirmed its fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance of $22.5 billion, with $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software, as last provided in its second quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings release on June 13, 2019.\n\nConference Call\n\nBroadcom will host a conference call to discuss details of the transaction. A live webcast and the accompanying presentation relating to the transaction will be available in the \"Investors\" section of Broadcom's website at https://investors.broadcom.com in advance of the conference call.\n\nConference call date: August 8, 2019\n\nTime: 2:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Eastern)\n\nDial in #: US (866) 610-1072, International +1 (973) 935-2840\n\nPasscode is 7958018\n\nA replay of the call will be available for one week by dialing (800) 585-8367 (US) or +1 (404) 537-3406 (International) and the passcode is 7958018.

This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenue, and excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, debt-related costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on dispositions of acquisition-related assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations and non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Broadcom believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBroadcom is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial information presented herein to the relevant projected GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of Broadcom's GAAP to non-GAAP historical financial data is available in the Investor Center on its website.\n\nContacts\n\nBeatrice F.
