        "text": "The Federal and State agencies that have all been hosed by various APT’s and ransomware all buy Symantec AV off the GSA schedule. It’s only used by people that have no other choice due to bureaucratic failures.\n\nCrowdstrike Falcon, Sophos Intercept-X and SentinelOne were the choices I made for our NGAV replacement of Cylance. Sentinel One, won.\n\n@CrowdStrike\n\nI used Symantec up until about 1.5 years ago. Their Symantec.Cloud product was actually pretty good. My reason for leaving was after the Symantec AV and EPP products were acquired by Broadcom things became a mess. During the transition people were due for renewals and couldn’t even renew the product with Broadcom for months. Others couldn’t buy additional licenses to add-on more users. Communication about it all was atrocious. And when they decided to migrate the web portal it was supposed to be unavailable for a couple days, but instead was unavailable for a week.\n\nLuckily those things didn’t affect me too much, but once the licensing issues were happening to other people I saw the writing on the wall and worked on moving away from Symantec/Broadcom. For me, I can’t trust my companies assets to a leadership/customer support that botched the Symantec buyout and transition that badly. What confidence would I have in the actual product/service at that point?\n\nGuys which one protects better? This is for work for 100+ clients. I am trying to get a Crowd Strike trial license installed with no luck. Their support team needs to step up. I haven’t talk to Symantec support in ages. We have Symantec Antivirus for 12+ years and far Symantec Antivirus does the job but as mentioned in the previous comments the company was bought and we don’t know how it will be in the coming months and years.\n\nSo what will make you move from your current Antivirus to another Antivirus? Price/Support/Protection/Ease of Use?\n\nThank you\n\nAnything but Symantec. We ripped out SEP years ago, one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. As soon as we started deploying ESET it started finding things that Symantec missed, enhanced security system wide, and has for more features and is easier to use and manage than SEP ever was.\n\nOur main reason for jumping ship? Business relations. They wouldn’t get back to us on licensing, renewals, any kind of assistance with actually purchasing their product and getting it ready for use.\n\nWhat do we use now? ESET because that’s just what we went with, anything would be better than Symantec.\n\nI’ve never used Crowd Strike, but as a 5 year user of SEPP…I’d suggest Crowd Strike.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with SEPP, but if something goes wrong (that you haven’t already taught yourself to fix) and you have to rely on support? Good freakin’ luck with that. Oh, and by the way, I have to believe that the support center that Broadcom uses for SEPP is the same one that Veritas uses for Backup Exec…they both suck…they compete about equally for the worst in the business.\n\nWrong question. Remember, it’s not “if”, it’s “when”, so stop thinking about the \" Protect \" function, and start thinking about “Discover”. AV software has it’s place, but because of it’s inherent limitations, it will fail eventually.\n\nEDR or NextGen AV products look for activity that is evidence of those failures. Since the methodology of doing that is complex (and often a closely guarded trade secret) comparisons and tests don’t work as well as they do against signature based legacy AV software.\n\nIMO, nothing compares to CrowdStrike. Yes, there are other fine EDR tools out there, but it’s performance and low admin overhead alone set CrowdStrike apart. It’s a big ticket item, especially at the Pro or Enterprise levels of functionality, so do your homework. Develop a solid requirements list and start shopping. Narrow the contenders to two or three and then evaluate."
