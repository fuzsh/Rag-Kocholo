        "text": "World's Most Ethical Companies by the\n\nEthisphere Institute\n\nSymantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC) has been named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, a leading international think-tank dedicated to the creation, advancement, and sharing of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility, anti-corruption and sustainability. The complete list of rankings can be found at www.ethisphere.com/wme/.\n\n“Investment in ethical and responsible operations is an essential aspect of being a successful and sought-after employer, partner, and solutions provider. Symantec employees at all levels of the organization are devoted to creating a culture of ethics and integrity,” said Steve Bennett, president and chief executive officer, Symantec. “Receiving this award for the sixth consecutive year is a testimonial to our strong ethical corporate culture. It sets an expectation for our employees, customers, shareholders and society as a whole that we will continue to exercise good business judgment and devote resources and energy to these programs.”\n\nAt Symantec, ethics and integrity are the foundation of the company’s business success. Its ethical framework reflects a programmatic approach to doing business ethically every day in any part of the world. The company’s ethics & compliance program benchmarks the highest corporate governance criteria, integrating internal controls, policies and processes that enable employees to exceed the standard compliance requirements. Employees and partners alike are empowered to lead all organizational objectives and strategies with conviction knowing they’re operating within an ethical conduct model that provides them the tools and guidance beyond compliance with baseline laws and regulations. The company strives to demonstrate innovation and leadership in corporate governance and compliance with the goal of continuously improving ethics and compliance programs and policies. Learn more about our global corporate responsibility initiatives at www.symantec.com/corporate_responsibility/.\n\nIn its seventh year, the World’s Most Ethical Companies list highlights companies that outperform industry peers in exhibiting ethical behavior. The companies chosen go beyond making statements about doing business “ethically” and truly embrace ethical business practice and demonstrate industry leadership to benefit the public and compelling peers to follow suit. Through in-depth research and a multi-step analysis, Ethisphere reviewed nominations from companies in more than 100 countries and 36 industries. The methodology for the World’s Most Ethical Companies includes reviewing codes of ethics, litigation and regulatory infraction histories; evaluating the investment in innovation and sustainable business practices; looking at activities designed to improve corporate citizenship; and studying nominations from senior executives, industry peers, suppliers and customers.\n\n“Not only did more companies apply for the World's Most Ethical Companies recognition this year than any year in the past, which demonstrates that ethical activity is an important part of many of these companies' business models, but we are also seeing more companies be proactive and create new initiatives that expand ethics programs and cultures across entire industries, such as industry-based ethics associations and other activities,” said Alex Brigham, executive director of Ethisphere. “We are excited to see the 2013 World's Most Ethical Companies take these leadership positions, and embrace the correlation between ethical behavior and improved financial performance. Ethisphere congratulates Symantec on being one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for 2013.”\n\nA record number of nominations and applications in 2013 is evidence of both the World's Most Ethical Companies' growing recognition by various stakeholder groups and companies’ desire to be recognized for their integrity standards and ethical cultures.
