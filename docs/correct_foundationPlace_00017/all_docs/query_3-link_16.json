        "text": "Symantec Buys Intel's Anti-Virus Business\n\nSymantec licenses Intel Systems Management technology to integrate into Norton AntiVirus Product Line; Intel to integrate Norton AntiVirus into Intel LANDesk Management Suite\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., Sept. 28, 1998 - Symantec Corporation (Nasdaq: SYMC) announced today that it has bought Intel Corporation's anti-virus business. Symantec has also licensed Intel systems management technology which it will combine with its own antivirus technology to create best-of-breed anti-virus solutions for corporate organizations.\n\nNorton AntiVirus engine technology will be integrated into a new anti-virus product that Intel has had under development for most of this year. The product will be fully integrated with Intel LANDesk Management Suite and will be launched as a Norton AntiVirus product later this year to provide an obvious and smooth upgrade path for current LANDesk Virus Protect customers.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Symantec will support Intel's 18,000 registered anti-virus customers and Intel will recommend Norton AntiVirus to its corporate customers worldwide as the anti-virus solution of choice. Intel will also market the Norton AntiVirus product line through its extensive reseller channel worldwide.\n\n\"For nearly seven years LANDesk Virus Protect has been the leader in providing the robust systems management capabilities that businesses need in their anti-virus solution,\" said Ed Ekstrom, vice president, Intel New Business Group and general manager, Systems Management Division. \"By licensing these technologies to Symantec, we can focus entirely on our core competency - systems management leadership - while continuing to provide our customers with a world-class anti-virus solution. This alliance means Symantec will be the only anti-virus vendor to incorporate LANDesk management technologies into their utilities product line and to offer true integration with LANDesk products.\"\n\n\"Our relationship with Intel is a key component of our overall strategy to meet the needs of corporate customers and follows on the heels of other significant alliances including IBM, Entrust Technologies and PLATINUM technology,\" said Gordon Eubanks, Symantec's president and CEO. \"Integrating Intel LANDesk management technologies provides Norton AntiVirus customers with the best management solutions available and gives them the confidence they have the most manageable and flexible solution to fit within their existing network management architecture.\"\n\nSymantec will use the Intel systems management technology it has licensed to help build the Digital Immune SystemÂ™ that Symantec is developing with IBM. The Digital Immune System combines Symantec's award-winning products with neural network technology from IBM to provide corporate customers with an automated, trouble free environment to keep systems up and running. The Intel technology will enable network administrators to implement and manage the Digital Immune System across the enterprise.\n\nAvailability and Support\n\nThe relationship with Intel is ongoing. Starting immediately, Norton AntiVirus engine technology will be integrated into a new anti-virus product that Intel has had under development for most of this year. The product will fully integrate with Intel LANDesk Management Suite and will be launched as a Norton AntiVirus product later this year to provide an obvious and smooth upgrade path for current LANDesk Virus Protect customers.\n\nThe client portion of this product will be bundled with future versions of LANDesk Management Suite. Symantec will have a license to LANDesk Virus Protect software including all the common elements that make this product integral to LANDesk Management Suite. Versions will be fully compatible with the existing version of Norton AntiVirus and LANDesk Management Suite and will include complete management functionality such as distribution, configuration, lockdown, remote operations from one console, and event management and logging.\n\nCustomers migrating to this new version of Norton AntiVirus will receive support directly from Symantec. During this transition period, Intel will continue to honor all existing support and maintenance agreements for the current versions of LANDesk Virus Protect and will continue to provide anti-virus pattern files. Until the new version is available, Intel and Symantec will continue to sell LANDesk Virus Protect 5.0.\n\nFor additional information regarding support for current products, customers can contact Intel at www.intel.com. For information regarding the transition program, customers can contact Symantec at 1-800-745-6054.\n\nAbout LANDesk Management Suite\n\nIntel LANDesk Management Suite, the flagship product in the LANDesk family, provides integrated remote problem resolution, hardware and software inventory, server monitoring, software distribution, virus protection and other leading desktop system management functions. It also takes advantage of the Intel-led and industry-supported Wired for Management Initiative.\n\nAbout Norton AntiVirus\n\nSymantec's multi-tier virus protection strategy is the basis for products that protect the enterprise at the desktop, groupware, server, Internet and gateway levels. The Norton AntiVirus product line uses innovative Bloodhound heuristic technology to detect and remove both known and unknown viruses. Norton AntiVirus also includes LiveUpdate, which automatically updates users with the latest engine updates and virus definitions over the Internet.\n\n* Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others."
