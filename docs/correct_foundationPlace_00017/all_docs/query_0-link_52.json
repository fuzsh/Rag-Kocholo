        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enterprise cloud storage provider Zetta today announced that it has raised $9 million in its third round of funding, bringing the total funding to $31.5 million. Both existing investors Foundation Capital and Sigma Partners participated. Funds from this new investment will be used for sales, marketing and product development that will help the company increase market share of its award-winning cloud backup services in the small-to-medium business (SMB) market.\n\n“As more small-to-medium organizations make the decision to move their data in the cloud, Zetta becomes an obvious choice, solving their data protection challenges in a cost-effective and extremely secure way,” said Greg Gretsch, managing director at Sigma Partners. “We are very pleased to see the growing customer roster and the progress that the company made this past year.”\n\n“I don’t worry about the backups getting done anymore,” said Larry Steinke, technology director at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California, and a Zetta user for almost a year. “I get email alerts if something might be wrong, and Zetta tech support is there to help. It is pretty much a hands-off operation.”\n\n“As an investor in Zetta from the beginning, it is exciting to see the company’s growth and customer acceptance,” said Ashmeet Sidana, general partner at Foundation Capital. “The storage industry is experiencing a fundamental shift, where an increasing number of organizations are embracing cloud backup over traditional backup solutions. Zetta’s solution ensures mission-critical data is protected offsite in the most secure way possible.”\n\n“We have increased our customer footprint by more than ten times in the past year,” said Ali Jenab, Zetta CEO. “We are seeing great interest from organizations who know that backing up their data in the cloud is the best way to solve ongoing data protection challenges. We are glad to see once more that our progress has prompted the original investors to add to the previous investments they made in Zetta.”\n\nAbout Zetta"
