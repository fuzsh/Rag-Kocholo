        "text": "Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) today announced Veritas Storage Foundation 5.0, the next generation of its industry-leading storage management and virtualization technology. The unique set of solutions will provide IT organizations with unprecedented visibility and control of the diverse server and storage assets in their data centers, with significant product enhancements including new centralized management capabilities, enhanced storage virtualization, and full support for enterprise applications and databases. Storage Foundation 5.0 will be released synchronously across operating system platforms and will enable IT organizations to standardize storage operations throughout the data center.\n\n\"Integrated solutions such as Veritas Storage Foundation 5.0 reduce complexity and make a lot of people's lives in IT much, much easier,\" said Steve Duplessie, founder and senior analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. \"With the absurdly high rate of new data creation, combined with all the independent tools required to manage the data -- and the infrastructure -- it's a wonder how IT ever sleeps. Symantec has given back control to IT managers whose data centers were unmanageable. The 5.0 release promises to streamline management requirements enabling people to focus on what's really important, the data, with efficiencies that have never before been experienced. There isn't anyone in IT that won't find this completely cool and highly valuable.\"\n\nIf IT organizations are to meet the growing demands placed on them, and at the same time keep costs under control, they must find ways to dramatically reduce the complexity of their data center infrastructure, and make optimal use of valuable data center assets such as servers, storage hardware, and their IT staff. This requires the ability to transform storage management beyond a single application, or a single server, or a single storage device.\n\nSymantec has re-architected its leading Veritas Storage Foundation offering to provide IT organizations with the first-ever capability to view application and storage resources across the entire data center, across every major operating system and storage hardware platform -- and an unrivalled ability to take proactive control of their storage environment. No other vendor provides such a capability even for a single operating system or storage hardware platform, and Symantec is introducing this capability to support all major operating system environments and all major storage hardware devices.\n\n\"Veritas Storage Foundation is a revolutionary step in Symantec's commitment to help our customers optimize their multi-platform data center environments,\" said Kris Hagerman, senior vice president of Symantec's Data Center Management Group. \"Leveraging our cross-platform heritage, we have delivered the only solution in the industry that provides data center-wide visibility into the entire storage environment, with unprecedented power to control and manage that environment.\"\n\nDifferentiated Capabilities to Master Complexity\n\nVeritas Storage Foundation 5.0 will include Storage Foundation Management Server, a completely new technology providing centralized multi-host management capabilities across Unix, Linux, and Windows. This unique offering enables enterprise-wide visibility, control, and standardization of the data center infrastructure. It enables IT organizations to centrally manage their application, server, and storage environments, leading to faster application deployment times, simplified data migrations, higher service levels, reduced risk of human error, and more comprehensive visibility and control throughout the environment. Storage Foundation Management Server supports Veritas Storage Foundation 4.x and 5.0, which means customers can view and manage all such instances of Storage Foundation, across their entire data center, through a single, unified tool.\n\n\"The Chicago Board Options Exchange processes an average of 400,000,000 quote transactions each day and it is vital that we protect and optimize our critical trading systems. Veritas Storage Foundation Management Server gives us unprecedented visibility and control of our storage and application resources to support this huge volume of information, while helping drastically reduce data center operational costs,\" explained Curt Schumacher, chief technology officer, Chicago Board Options Exchange. \"We've used Veritas Storage Foundation for eight years to provide a standard management layer to reduce complexity in our data center. With this latest release, Symantec continues to help us increase our efficiency, so we can focus on initiatives that benefit our customers.\"\n\nSymantec is also introducing Veritas Storage Foundation Basic, a free version of Storage Foundation designed for edge-tier and infrastructure workloads that make it easier and more affordable for customers to enjoy the dramatic benefits of standardizing their data center infrastructure software. Veritas Storage Foundation Basic combines the industry-leading Veritas File System, Veritas Volume Manager, and advanced Dynamic Multi-pathing, for system configurations that do not exceed 4 volumes, 4 file systems and/or 2 processors in a single physical system. An enterprise support offering for Storage Foundation Basic, which is optional, is offered on a subscription basis. Like Veritas Storage Foundation 4.x and 5.0, Veritas Storage Foundation Basic can be managed centrally with Storage Foundation Management Server, extending the power of Symantec's approach to a unified storage management platform beyond mission-critical environments to every server and application workload in the data center.\n\nDynamic Storage Tiering (DST), a feature of Storage Foundation, enables data mobility so that companies can reduce storage costs by matching the appropriate storage hardware tier to the application, and moving information to different tiers of online storage as the value and priority of the information change over time. Administrators can use policies to move data across multiple tiers of storage within an application, in a live multi-platform environment, without affecting production systems or impacting users.\n\nDynamic Multi-Pathing (DMP), part of Veritas Storage Foundation 5.0, is an advanced multi-pathing technology that delivers enhanced I/O performance, device discovery and path failover throughout the SAN. Storage Foundation Management Server will fully support DMP management, resulting in increased visibility into the storage environment, and reduced risk. For example, IT managers can execute storage array and HBA upgrades simultaneously, scaling across multiple hosts, and minimize the potential for human error by checking connections, redundancy, and other factors before initiating tasks.\n\nAs part of Symantec's high availability/disaster recovery (HA/DR) solution, the management of Veritas Volume Replicator has been significantly enhanced by the introduction of Storage Foundation Management Server. By enabling centralized management of systems protected by Veritas Volume Replicator, IT organizations can efficiently scale HA/DR operations. In addition, with its new Bunker Replication feature, Veritas Volume Replicator enables synchronous data replication to a 'bunker' site, while simultaneously replicating asynchronously to a remote location. Bunker replication ensures no application transactions are lost in the event of a failure and supports replication over any distance. Veritas Volume Replicator fully supports heterogeneous Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems and heterogeneous storage, providing IT organizations with unrivalled choice and flexibility in selecting the most appropriate and cost-effective platforms for their needs.\n\nVeritas CommandCentral Storage, a storage resource management and SAN management solution, is now part of the Veritas Storage Foundation product family, and provides comprehensive storage management, storage capacity planning and reporting, and business visibility into the storage infrastructure, supporting SAN, NAS, and DAS architectures. CommandCentral Storage scales to meet the needs of the world's largest storage environments, and offers industry leading storage management capabilities enabling administrators to understand more clearly how storage resources are being utilized and to take control and maximize storage utilization and value.\n\nServices for Veritas Storage Foundation\n\nSymantec Global Services provides a broad portfolio of consulting services that allow customers to take full advantage of the advanced new capabilities in the Veritas Storage Foundation product family, to reduce data center complexity and infrastructure cost, increase data center availability and agility, and address storage-related IT risks. Symantec consultants offer comprehensive storage assessments, design, enablement and expert on-site services to help customers manage and standardize their storage infrastructures. Symantec's storage experts can also help customers reduce IT costs by optimizing Tiered Storage and Storage Migration initiatives. More information on Symantec service offerings can be found at www.symantec.com/consulting.\n\nPricing and Product Availability\n\nVeritas Storage Foundation Basic and Veritas CommandCentral Storage are generally available now at www.symantec.com. Veritas Storage Foundation 5.0 is scheduled to be generally available in calendar Q3, 2006. Products are available through Symantec's direct sales force, enterprise VAR channel, system integrators and select OEM partners."
