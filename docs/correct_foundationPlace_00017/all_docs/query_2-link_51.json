        "text": "Broadcom, parent of the Symantec enterprise business, has acquired cyber risk analytics software provider Bay Dynamics, according to Silicon Valley Business Journal. Financial terms were not disclosed.\n\nThe deal could benefit Symantec security partners that specialize in Data Loss Prevention (DLP), ChannelE2E believes. Indeed, Bay Dynamics competes in the User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) security software market. UEBA is a process to detect insider threats, targeted attacks and financial fraud, according to Gartner. UEBA solutions look at patterns of human behavior, and then apply algorithms and statistical analysis to detect meaningful anomalies from those patterns—anomalies that indicate potential threats, Wikipedia says.\n\nWith those goals in mind, Bay Dynamics develops risk fabric software that allows customers to \"rapidly identify leading threats to your organization’s protected information through automatic prioritization and clear visualization of those users and entities that represent risks,\" the company says.\n\nBay Dynamics software integrates with a lengthy list of security infrastructure, risk management and identity and access management (IAM) tools. Key partners include ArcSight, Atlassian, BitSight, CyberSponse, Forcepoint, IBM's Resilient, Radar, Jamf, McAfee, Micro Focus, Qualys, Rapid7, ServiceNow, Skyhigh, Splunk, Symantec, Tenable, Veracode and VMware's Carbon Black, the company says.\n\nBroadcom Acquires Bay Dynamics: Symantec Partner Benefits\n\nThe Bay Dynamics website does not mention a formal partner program or MSSP (managed security services provider) engagements.\n\nStill, the deal could be good news for Symantec's enterprise partners -- including MSPs and MSSPs focused on Data Loss Prevention (DLP).\n\nIndeed, Symantec and Bay Dynamics have had a formal partnership since July 2017. At the time, the companies disclosed plans to integrate Risk Fabric with Symantec's Data DLP offering. The result was a \"central point of behavioral analytics that dynamically delivers top mitigation actions to help prevent malicious insiders from stealing sensitive data,\" the duo said at the time.\n\nSymantec Business Evolution, Breakup\n\nBroadcom acquired the Symantec enterprise business for $10.7 billion in 2019. Meanwhile, rumors persist that the former Symantec consumer business, now known as NortonLifeLock, may also be acquired.\n\nChannelE2E has not independently confirmed the Broadcom-Bay Dynamics deal."
