        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA and SUNNYVALE, CA, June 12, 2016 – Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) and Blue Coat, Inc. today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Symantec will acquire Blue Coat for approximately $4.651 billion in cash. The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2016.\n\nGreg Clark, Chief Executive Officer of Blue Coat, will be appointed Chief Executive Officer of Symantec and join the Symantec Board upon closing of the transaction.\n\nBlue Coat is the #1 market share leader and share gainer in Web Security with a widely recognized portfolio of integrated technologies serving as a trusted platform to deliver Cloud Generation Security to more than 15,000 customers worldwide. For Blue Coat’s fiscal year ending April 30, 2016, GAAP revenue was $598 million and non-GAAP revenue was $755 million, with 17% year-over-year growth, supported by new products and new customers. For the same time period, the company had non-GAAP operating margins of 22% and cash flow from operations of $135 million. Also for this time period, GAAP operating margins were -42%.\n\nDefining the Future of Cybersecurity\n\nWith the acquisition of Blue Coat, Symantec will enhance its leadership position to define the future of cybersecurity and set the pace for innovation industrywide. The combined company will:\n\nProtect customers against more cyber threats, with best-in-breed protection, detection and remediation across endpoint, email, web, network and servers. This transaction will combine Symantec’s leading threat telemetry with Blue Coat’s networks and cloud security offerings to provide differentiated security solutions across hundreds of millions of endpoints and servers, and billions of email and web transactions.\n\nHelp enterprises securely embrace the cloud. Symantec will be able to deliver security for the cloud generation of users, data and apps, for the cloud, from the cloud and to the cloud. The company’s leading data loss prevention capabilities will be applied at the web proxy and to over 12,000 cloud applications.\n\nBring together a formidable scale of investment in cyber R&D and threat research. These investments span over 3,000 engineers and researchers, as well as nine Threat Response Centers.\n\n“With this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals. Together, we will be best positioned to address the ever-evolving threat landscape, the massive changes introduced by the shift to mobile and cloud, and the challenges created by regulatory and privacy concerns,” said Dan Schulman, Chairman of Symantec. “Greg and the entire Blue Coat leadership team have done an exceptional job of strengthening, growing and scaling their business. In addition to a proven track record of delivering scale and profitable growth, Greg brings significant leadership experience, deep security expertise and a history of successfully integrating companies into a single portfolio; he is the right person to lead Symantec as we advance our position as the leader in cybersecurity.\n\n“On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Ajei Gopal for his decisive and insightful leadership as our Interim President and COO; he has been central to creating and driving our business momentum during a time of transition and has been an integral part of the team engineering the Blue Coat acquisition. I also want to thank Thomas Seifert and Scott Taylor, and the rest of the Symantec management team, for their fortitude and hard work, which has helped enable us to announce this transformational acquisition,” Mr. Schulman added.\n\nGreg Clark, Chief Executive Officer of Blue Coat, said, “Today, Symantec keeps global enterprises, governments and individual consumers protected with solutions across threat protection, information protection and managed services. Likewise, Blue Coat is the trusted source for protecting billions of web transactions daily and is the clear leader in the growing cloud security market. Once combined, we will offer customers around the world – from large enterprises and governments to individual consumers – unrivaled threat protection and unmatched cloud security. With employees of Blue Coat and Symantec coming together, we will be well positioned to drive meaningful growth and push the boundaries of innovation. I am very excited about the opportunity to join Symantec as CEO and look forward to working with the strongest, deepest team in security to realize the many strategic and financial benefits this transaction will create.”\n\nThomas Seifert, Chief Financial Officer of Symantec, said, “With the $150 million in expected annual net cost synergies, in addition to our previously announced $400 million in planned net cost savings, this transaction will allow Symantec to improve our profitability while continuing to invest in innovation and drive growth. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to our non-GAAP earnings creating meaningful value for our shareholders. We are reiterating our first quarter guidance and maintaining our commitment to our previously announced $5.5 billion capital return program, of which the remaining $1.3 billion will be returned by the end of the current fiscal year. We will also continue our practice of paying a quarterly dividend to our shareholders.”\n\nDelivers Attractive Financial Benefits to Symantec Shareholders\n\nOn a pro-forma, non-GAAP basis, the combined company would have had $4.4 billion in revenues in fiscal year 2016, of which 62% would come from enterprise security. By the end of fiscal 2018, Symantec\n\nexpects to realize $550 million in run-rate cost savings, of which $400 million will come from Symantec’s previously announced cost efficiency program.\n\nCreating a Strong Organization and Leadership Team, Focused on Integration Planning\n\nThe Board of Directors will continue to be led by Symantec’s current Chairman, Mr. Schulman. Mr. Clark will serve as CEO and Mr. Seifert will continue as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nMembers of Blue Coat’s management team have not only agreed to join Symantec but also made the decision to rollover a substantial portion of their cash and options into the combined entity.\n\nMr. Schulman added, “The Board would like to thank Symantec’s management team for their continued dedication and commitment to our company and welcome Blue Coat’s executive team to Symantec.”\n\nThe integration of the two companies will be led by executives from both Symantec and Blue Coat, with integration planning to begin immediately. The companies expect an efficient and successful integration given their complementary product offerings and distinct customer footprints, as well as Blue Coat’s management team’s track record of integration. The combined company will be headquartered in Mountain View, California.\n\nInvesting in the Future of Symantec\n\nIn connection with the transaction, Silver Lake has agreed to make an additional investment of $500 million in 2.0% convertible notes due 2021 of Symantec, doubling its investment in Symantec to $1 billion. In addition, Bain Capital has agreed to make an investment of $750 million in the convertible notes. The convertible notes are noncallable and unsecured, and have an initial conversion price of approximately $20.41 per share.\n\nIn connection with this investment, David Humphrey, a Managing Director of Bain Capital Private Equity, will be appointed to Symantec’s Board of Directors, effective at the close of the transaction.\n\nFinancing and Path to Completion\n\nSymantec intends to finance the transaction with cash on the balance sheet and $2.8 billion of new debt. The company is focused on paying down a significant portion of this debt within the next several years with cash on the balance sheet and through cash generation.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to be completed in the third calendar quarter of 2016, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals.\n\nAdvisors\n\nJ.P.

The results of operations of Blue Coat have undergone significant change due to the impact of purchase accounting on revenue from prior acquisitions, stock-based compensation, restructuring, transition and integration matters, charges related to the amortization of intangible assets, and certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to the Company’s core operations. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Symantec’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our press release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at: http://www.symantec.com/invest.\n\n1 Purchase price of $4.65 billion based on estimated Blue Coat debt and cash balances at time of close and before estimated transaction expenses.\n\nGAAP RESULTS RECONCILED TO NON-GAAP RESULTS (1)\n\n(Dollars in thousands, unaudited)\n\nYear Ended April 30, 2016\n\nNon-GAAP revenue\n\nGAAP net revenue $ 598,337\n\nPlus:\n\nImpact of purchase accounting on net revenue 157,037 Adjusted non-GAAP net revenue $755,374\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n\nGAAP operating loss (252,478)\n\nGAAP operating margin % -42% Plus: Impact of purchase accounting on net revenue 157,037 Amortization of intangible assets and purchased technology 165,326 Acquisition write-up of acquired inventory sold 29,210 Stock-based compensation expense 22,565 Restructuring and other charges 2,857 Acquisition fair value adjustments to earn-outs (970) Acquisition transaction costs 30,417 Acquisition integration, transition and other 3,537 Financial sponsor fees 5,839 Non-GAAP operating income $ 163,340 Non-GAAP operating margin % 22%\n\n(1) For more information about our non-GAAP financial measures, please see Appendix A.\n\nGAAP RESULTS RECONCILED TO NON-GAAP RESULTS CONTINUED (1) Fiscal Year Ended April 1, 2016 (2) (Dollars in thousands, unaudited) Non-GAAP pro forma net revenue Symantec Blue Coat Pro Forma GAAP net revenue $ 3,600,174 $ 598,337 $ 4,198,511 Plus: Impact of purchase accounting on net revenue - 157,037 157,037 Non-GAAP net revenue $ 3,600,174 $ 755,374 $ 4,355,548 (1) For more information about our non-GAAP financial measures, please see Appendix A. (2) Blue Coat's fiscal year end differs by less than 94 days from Symantec's fiscal year end, therefore Blue Coat's net revenue from its fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 is combined with Symantec's net revenue from its fiscal year ended April 1, 2016.\n\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Measures Appendix A\n\nObjective of non-GAAP measures of Symantec: Symantec Corporation (“Symantec”) supplements the financial results and projections that it provides in accordance with generally accepted accounting\n\nprinciples, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Symantec believes its presentation of pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our future results. Symantec’s management team uses these pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Symantec believes that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of its performance to prior periods and to its peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of the pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures. Pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNo reconciliation of the forecasted range for non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2018 is included in this release because the acquisition and other charges associated with the Blue Coat acquisition that may impact the GAAP measure, as well as non-cash compensation expense and other non-cash charges, are not yet known and subject to change, and the variability of these charges could have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on Symantec’s future GAAP financial results.\n\nObjective of non-GAAP measures of Blue Coat: Blue Coat, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) believes its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance to prior periods and to the Company’s peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nImpact of purchase accounting on net revenue: We define adjusted net revenue as net revenue excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The Company regularly monitors these measures to assess its operating performance. On February 15, 2012, in connection with the Thoma Bravo Acquisition, and on May 22, 2015, as part of the Bain Acquisition, the Company was required to write down its deferred revenue balances due to purchase accounting in accordance with GAAP. In addition, in connection with the Company’s other acquisitions, the Company was also required to make similar adjustments to write down its deferred revenue balances due to purchase accounting in accordance with GAAP. The impact on revenue related to purchase accounting as a result of these transactions, particularly as a result of the Bain Acquisition, limits the comparability of revenue between periods. While the deferred revenue written down in connection with the Company’s acquisitions will never be recognized as revenue under GAAP, we do not expect the Bain Acquisition to have an impact on future renewal rates of the contracts included within the deferred revenue write-down, nor do we expect revenue generated from new service and subscription contracts to be similarly impacted by purchase accounting adjustments.\n\nAccordingly, we believe presenting adjusted net revenue to exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, including the deferred revenue write-down, aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing the Company’s overall operating performance. If these adjustments were not made, the Company’s future revenue growth rates could appear overstated. Adjusted net revenue has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for net revenue. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets and purchased technology: When acquiring a business, the Company is required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and purchased technology. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost the Company would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges from the Company’s non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.\n\nAcquisition write-up of acquired inventory sold: In connection with the Company’s Bain Acquisition, and other acquisitions, the Company was required to write up its inventory balances to fair value in purchase accounting in accordance with GAAP. Recording inventory at fair value in purchase accounting had the effect of increasing inventory and thereby increasing the cost of revenue in subsequent periods as compared to the amounts the Company would have otherwise recognized. The acquisition write-up of acquired inventory sold represents the incremental cost of revenue that was recognized as a result of purchase accounting. We exclude these expenses because we believe they are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred and not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\nStock-based compensation: This generally consists of expenses for common stock options and restricted stock determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock-based compensation. For comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate the comparison of the Company’s results to the results of the Company’s peer companies. Furthermore, unlike cash-based compensation, the value of stock-based compensation is determined using complex formulas that incorporate factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond the Company’s control.\n\nRestructuring and Other Charges. In connection with certain acquisitions and global realignments intended to reduce the Company’s combined operating cost structure and eliminate operating redundancies, the Company incurred restructuring and other charges that primarily consisted of severance and related costs resulting from the reduction of headcount. We believe they are not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\nAcquisition fair value adjustments to earn-outs: In July 2015, the Company acquired Perspecsys, Inc. and estimated an acquisition date fair value of the contingent earn-out of $1.0 million, which was subsequently adjusted to zero and recognized as a benefit through the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended April 30, 2016. We exclude these benefits because we believe they are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred and not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\nAcquisition transaction costs: Acquisition transaction costs include financial advisory, legal and accounting professional services costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions during the period. We exclude these expenses because we believe they are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred and not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\nAcquisition integration, transition and other costs: These consist of employee-related integration and transition costs, and the amortization of the write-up of our operating leases that are incurred as a result of our acquisitions during the period. We exclude these expenses because we believe they are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred and not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\nFinancial sponsor fees: These consist of financial sponsor fees. We exclude these expenses because we believe they are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred and not directly related to the operation of the Company’s business.\n\n1 Purchase price of $4.65 billion based on estimated Blue Coat debt and cash balances at time of close and before estimated transaction expenses."
