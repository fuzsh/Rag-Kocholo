Documents the motives of Symantec and the entrepreneurial companies to do the acquisition. Describes the major difficulties in the process. Also documents Symantec’s method of valuation.\n\nThis material is available for download by current Stanford GSB students, faculty, and staff, as well as Stanford GSB alumni.
