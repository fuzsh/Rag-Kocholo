        "text": "Here's a multi-step method I've developed for it if it helps\n\nSo after talking with Symantec, it's clear that their tech support doesn't seem to know Mac stuff too well. I've reached out to Mike Romo, the lead Mac developer at Symantec who has demonstrated that he knows the Mac very well. Haven't heard back from him yet, but he's the guy that Mac SysAdmins need to report their issues if they are getting no where with Symantec Tech Support.\n\nAnyway, while waiting for a response, I have developed a workaround that I wanted to share with JAMFNation:\n\nStep 1: Get Java 6 out to your workstations. In Mac OS X 10.8, it is not installed and will need to be if LiveUpdate is to work. That should be easy, upload the package to Casper Admin and deploy however you normally would.\n\nStep 2: Run the uninstaller script from this Symantec article on your machines. http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH103489\n\nMake sure you look toward the bottom of the page. There are two scripts...one designed to be run interactively by a user and the one further down that is able to be run by products such as ARD or in our case, Casper.\n\nStep 3: Upload the PKG WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOLDER to Casper Admin like you would any other package. When you install this package without the Additional Resources folder, it is the equivalent of installing Symantec Endpoint Protection to your Mac clients in unmanaged mode.\n\nStep 4: Use Composer to build a new package. You are going to take the sylink.xml file located in the Additional Resources folder and package it up. Basically you need to get this file to /Library/Application Support/Symantec/SMC as per Symantec article http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH131585 which talks about converting an unmanaged client to a supported managed client.\n\nStep 5: Upload this package that you just created to Casper Admin and assign it a priority number that is one less than the priority you assigned to the main package in Step 4 of this post. THE MANAGEMENT PACKAGE NEEDS TO COME ON BEFORE YOU PUSH THE MAIN PACKAGE. You should also have the workstation reboot after installing both of these package.\n\nThis can all be built to deploy to existing workstations via a policy in Casper or as part of your imaging workflow. I set up my policy to first run the uninstall script, second run Java 6 installer (I'm trying to get this going on 10.8), third install SEP package, fourth install the sylink.xml package. Fifth, I update inventory and reboot. If I wanted to be fancy, I could scope it to all machines that have any Symantec product installed, but in our environment all managed clients do so I didn't have to think too hard on how to scope. I triggered it appropriately and tested and it worked one some sample machines.\n\nI invite feedback on this post too from anyone who modifies this to simplify, automate or remove a reboot if someone has gotten that far. I'm fine with the reboot, but others might not be.\n\nI'm laughing myself about them releasing a \"fully-integrated Mac client\". I honestly thought version 11.0.6 was supposed to be...the \"integration\" is lacking in the ability to push out new definitions even still in 12.1.2.\n\nAs for why our department uses it on the Mac...the simple answer involves a school district regulation that states \"All personal computers are required to have anti-malware software.\" My philosophies and background on the Mac is irrelevant in such matters. I do have some basic input on what we choose for antimalware keeping in mind how we are weighted (90% Windows, 10% Mac). The Windows guys preferences will obviously carry greater weight.\n\nIt also comes down to money for that matter. So we can use SEP for Mac very cheaply since we purchased the enterprise kit for Windows. If I had us acquire my personal preference (Intego) we would have spent way more money.\n\nNow, all this having been said, I'll attempt to help jkgrosh with his quandary. Basically, both methods function well. What I was going to do prior to figuring out this method was similar to Brian.Flynn's method. Essentially, I was going to create a PKG package with postinstall script that would dump Symantec's PKG and the \"Additional Resources\" folder to a temporary location, install Symantec's PKG (which would have the \"Additional Resources\" where the installer expected to find it) and then at the end of the postinstall script, delete the installer files from the temp location. That method should work to, but honestly a little more \"roundabout\" to me. My method of installing the Sylink.xml file (as part of a package) and installing the unmanaged package allows a bit more flexibility in using Casper to deploy and has many fewer variables (Did the stupid installer get deleted from the temp location once it was done? Will there be any annoyances calling an installer package from a postinstall script from another installer package?)\n\nAgain it's a matter of administrator's preference, but I can say that my method was successful on 200 + Macs and was totally automatable through a Casper Policy.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nblackholemac"
