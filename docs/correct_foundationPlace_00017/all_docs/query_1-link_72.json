        "text": "Tokyo, February 02, 2010\n\nFujitsu (TSE: 6702) and Symantec Corporation (Nasdaq: SYMC) today announced that they intend to expand their global strategic partnership and better serve their customers in the areas of data protection, storage management, and information security.\n\nUnder this arrangement, Fujitsu plans to combine its high-performance and highly reliable ETERNUS storage systems and PRIMERGY servers with Symantec's industry-leading data management and storage management software products including NetBackup, Backup Exec, Backup Exec System Recovery and Storage Foundation, and its global de facto security solution, Symantec Endpoint Protection. Fujitsu and Symantec will jointly identify and provide solutions integrating both companies' products and services to help customers streamline datacenter management and fully utilize their existing IT investments. Both companies aim to help a wide range of customers — from medium-sized companies to large enterprises — reduce their costs, and better meet their diverse information and risk management needs.\n\nWhile building on each company's strengths and increasing synergies between the two, Fujitsu and Symantec aim to further expand their businesses worldwide with the possibility of joint product development targeting the global market.\n\nCorporate Senior Executive Vice President Masami Yamamoto stated, \"By combining Fujitsu's strengths in storage and server products with Symantec's leading software for storage/server management and data protection, I am confident that we will be able to offer a more competitive range of solutions to our customers.\"\n\nFujitsu is currently extending its infrastructure business in global markets, developing unified global brands, product lines and services for server and storage infrastructures.\n\n\"Our customers continue to face flat or decreasing budgets in light of exponential information growth,\" said Enterprise Products Group President Greg Hughes of Symantec. \"With this enhanced relationship, Fujitsu and Symantec intend to more tightly integrate our solutions and services to help customers improve hardware utilization, reduce complexity, and improve operational visibility.\"\n\nSymantec aims to maximize the value of its solutions for its customers through its alliances with key global partners, including the leading hardware vendors and systems integrators. With this expanded relationship with Fujitsu, Symantec will be able to help customers further reduce their costs, minimize risk and more effectively secure and manage the information that drives their businesses."
