        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) announced today its acquisition of Appthority, a privately held company that offers comprehensive Mobile Application Security Analysis. This technology gives Symantec customers the critical ability to analyze mobile apps for both malicious capabilities and unsafe and unwanted behaviors, such as vulnerabilities, risk of sensitive data loss, and privacy-invasive actions.\n\nThe acquisition of Appthority demonstrates Symantec’s continued commitment to securing modern (e.g. iOS, Android) endpoints and operating systems, as it brings innovation to its portfolio that addresses this vital security need. Last year, Symantec acquired Skycure, a leading Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) technology, that enabled the launch of Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile (SEP Mobile). Appthority’s technology will be built into SEP Mobile, further enhancing Symantec’s ability to protect the broadest spectrum of modern endpoints and operating systems. This extends Symantec’s leadership in delivering the most comprehensive endpoint security solution available (recently named a leader by the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms, Forrester Wave for Endpoint Security Suites, and AV-Test Institute Best Protection Awards). With its Integrated Cyber Defense platform, Symantec now stands as the only company that offers solutions that can protect modern and traditional endpoints (Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android) at the device, application, network, identity and cloud layers. Today, Symantec also announced its acquisition of Javelin Networks, furthering its commitment to endpoint innovation. Javelin Networks is a privately held company that offers advanced software to help enterprises defend against Active Directory-based attacks.\n\n“ Mobile apps are a critical threat vector that every company must address to protect their enterprise security,” said Adi Sharabani, SVP, Modern OS Security. “ The Appthority technology extends SEP Mobile’s capabilities in limiting unwanted app behaviors, supporting regulatory compliance, and assessing vulnerabilities.”\n\nStarting today, the Appthority team and its technology becomes part of Symantec’s endpoint security business. The privately held company was founded in 2011 and has employees based around the world. The company has been recognized by CB Insights as an AI 100 leader and its products have won several industry awards from CRN Magazine and others.\n\n“ Mobile users increase the enterprise attack surface with each app they install. This acquisition unites Appthority with Symantec’s comprehensive endpoint security portfolio, which is the first solution on the market that can protect all traditional and modern endpoints and now apps,” said Domingo J. Guerra, Appthority Co-founder.\n\n“ Armed with Symantec’s industry-leading security research and tools, SEP Mobile integrated with Appthority technology is expected to deliver the most comprehensive Mobile Threat Defense solution, with enhanced app analysis capabilities, both in real-time and on-demand,” added Anne Bonaparte, Appthority CEO.\n\nPrior to the acquisition, Appthority was a Symantec Ventures portfolio company. Symantec Ventures drives innovation in the Symantec ecosystem by investing in early stage cyber security startups that solve hard problems for enterprises and consumers. Over the past two years, Symantec has made significant investments to bring innovation to its endpoint security portfolio, further enhancing the company’s ability to protect all modern endpoints and operating systems (e.g. iOS, Android). Recent product additions to Symantec’s endpoint security portfolio include SEP Hardening Application Isolation, deception and Targeted Attack Analytics. The Appthority technology is a key addition to Symantec’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. This acquisition delivers on the promise of broader mobile security that combines the best of mobile app analysis and mobile threat defense to enhance overall security and workflow.\n\nAbout Symantec\n\nSymantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC), the world's leading cyber security company, helps organizations, governments and people secure their most important data wherever it lives. Organizations across the world look to Symantec for strategic, integrated solutions to defend against sophisticated attacks across endpoints, cloud and infrastructure.
