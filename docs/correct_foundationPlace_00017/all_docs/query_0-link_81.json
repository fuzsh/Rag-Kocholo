Approximately 80% of Symantec's net revenues are\n\nderived from products that operate on Microsoft Corporation's (\"Microsoft\") MS-\n\nDOS or Windows operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers.\n\nSymantec also offers products for use on the Apple Macintosh and IBM OS/2\n\noperating systems.\n\nThe Company's predecessor, C&E Software, Inc., a California corporation, and\n\nthat predecessor's operating subsidiary, Symantec Corporation, a California\n\ncorporation, were formed in September 1983 and March 1982, respectively. The\n\nCompany was incorporated in Delaware in April 1988 in connection with the\n\nSeptember 1988 reincorporation of the Company's predecessor and its operating\n\nsubsidiary into a single Delaware corporation.\n\nSince Symantec's initial public offering on June 23, 1989, the Company has\n\ncompleted acquisitions of the following companies:\n\nSoftware or Activity\n\nSoftware or Activity\n\nCompanies Acquired Date Acquired Acquired\n\n- --------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ---------------------\n\nIntec Systems Corporation (\"Intec\") August 31, 1994 Applications\n\nCentral Point Software, Inc. (\"Central Point\") June 1, 1994 Utilities\n\nSLR Systems, Inc. (\"SLR\") May 31, 1994 Development Tools\n\nFifth Generation Systems, Inc. (\"Fifth Generation\") October 4, 1993 Utilities\n\nContact Software International, Inc. (\"Contact\") June 2, 1993 Applications\n\nCertus International Corporation (\"Certus\") November 30, 1992 Utilities\n\nMultiScope, Inc. (\"MultiScope\") September 2, 1992 Development Tools\n\nThe Whitewater Group, Inc. (\"Whitewater\") September 2, 1992 Development Tools\n\nSymantec (UK) Ltd. (\"Symantec UK\") April 3, 1992 Marketing Entity\n\nZortech Ltd. (\"Zortech\") August 31, 1991 Development Tools\n\nDynamic Microprocessor Associates, Inc. (\"DMA\") August 30, 1991 Utilities\n\nLeonard Development Group (\"Leonard\") August 30, 1991 Applications\n\nPeter Norton Computing, Incorporated (\"Norton\") August 31, 1990 Utilities\n\nAll of these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interest.\n\nAccordingly, all financial information has been restated to reflect the combined\n\noperations of these companies and Symantec with the exception of Intec, SLR,\n\nMultiScope and Whitewater, which had results of operations that were not\n\nmaterial to Symantec's consolidated financial statements.\n\nSymantec's strategy is to develop and market products that are, or may become,\n\nleaders in their respective categories, maintain a broad product line across\n\nmultiple platforms and develop and market a strong product offering for the\n\nenterprise or networked computing environment. Symantec's early products were\n\nprimarily productivity applications, such as Q&A, a non-programmable database,\n\nand Time Line, a sophisticated project management program. In 1989, Symantec\n\nexpanded its business into utility products, initially with Macintosh utilities\n\nproducts, and then into DOS utilities in fiscal 1991 with the acquisition of\n\nNorton, the developer of Norton Utilities and Norton Commander. In fiscal 1992,\n\nSymantec acquired DMA, the developer of pcANYWHERE and in fiscal 1993, Symantec\n\nacquired Certus, the developer of Novi, an Anti-virus product that was merged\n\ninto The Norton AntiVirus. In fiscal 1992 and 1993, Symantec acquired three\n\ndevelopment tools companies (Zortech, Whitewater and MultiScope) and expanded\n\nits development tools business into the DOS and Windows object oriented\n\nprogramming markets. In fiscal 1994, Symantec continued this expansion into the\n\napplication development market with the acquisition of certain technology for\n\ndeveloping an architecture and tools to build client-server applications from\n\nDataEase International, Inc. Also in fiscal 1994, Symantec added to its\n\ninternal development of network utilities with the acquisition of Fifth\n\nGeneration, which had certain network utility\n\n1\n\nproducts under development. The acquisition of Contact in fiscal 1994 expanded\n\nthe Company's product line with the addition of ACT!, a contact management\n\nproduct. The acquisition of Central Point in fiscal 1995 added a number of\n\ndesktop and enterprise utility products to Symantec's product offerings,\n\nincluding Mac Tools, PC Tools, XTree Gold and Central Point Antivirus. Many of\n\nthe products acquired through the acquisition of Central Point were duplicative\n\nof products marketed by Symantec prior to the acquisition. As a result, the\n\ncomparison of future Company revenues to historical revenues on a pooled basis\n\nmay be adversely impacted by the elimination of duplicative products.\n\nThe Company believes that the prevailing trends in the software industry are\n\nmovements by companies to downsize from mainframes and minicomputers to\n\nmicrocomputers; a continuation of the move to graphical user interfaces, as\n\ndemonstrated by the strong demand for Windows products; a move to networked\n\nenvironments of microcomputers; and a move to object-oriented programming among\n\nsoftware developers. As a result, Symantec is currently expanding its\n\ndevelopment of network management utilities and applications that support\n\nnetwork and workgroup computing and is continuing its development of object-\n\noriented programming tools.\n\nWhile Symantec's diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in\n\nquarterly net revenues, such fluctuations have occurred recently and are likely\n\nto occur in the future. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of\n\nfactors, including new product introductions and product upgrades, reduced\n\ndemand for any given product, the market's transition between operating systems,\n\n(including the market's acceptance and transition to Microsoft Corporation's new\n\noperating system \"Windows 95\" when released) and a transition from a desktop PC\n\nenvironment to an enterprise-wide networked environment.\n\nSymantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references\n\nas of and for the periods ended March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 reflect amounts as\n\nof and for the periods ended March 31, 1995, April 1, 1994, and April 2, 1993,\n\nrespectively.\n\n2\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\n\nSymantec's products, comprising both application software and system software,\n\nare currently organized into seven product groups: advanced utilities, security\n\nutilities, network/communications utilities, contact management, development\n\ntools, project management/productivity applications and client-server\n\ntechnology. The following table summarizes Symantec's principal products by\n\nproduct group and the operating system(s) on which they run:\n\nPrincipal Products Operating System(s)\n\n- -------------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nADVANCED UTILITIES\n\nThe Norton Utilities-Registered Trademark- Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh\n\nThe Norton Utilities-Registered Trademark-Administrator Windows, MS-DOS\n\nThe Norton Commander-Registered Trademark- MS-DOS\n\nThe Norton Desktop-TM-for Windows Windows\n\nPC Tools-TM- Windows, MS-DOS\n\nMac Tools-Registered Trademark- Macintosh, Power Macintosh\n\nSuperDoubler-TM- Macintosh\n\nSuitcase-TM- Macintosh\n\nXTreeGold-TM- Windows, MS-DOS\n\nSECURITY UTILITIES\n\nThe Norton AntiVirus-Registered Trademark- MS-DOS, Windows\n\nThe Norton AntiVirus-Registered Trademark-for NetWare Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh\n\nCentral Point Antivirus Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh, OS/2\n\nSymantec-Registered Trademark-AntiVirus for Macintosh (SAM-TM-)Macintosh\n\nSymantec-Registered Trademark-AntiVirus for Macintosh (SAM-TM-) Administrator Macintosh\n\nThe Norton Enterprise Backup-TM- Windows, MS-DOS\n\nThe Norton Backup-TM- Windows, MS-DOS\n\nFastback Plus-TM- Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh\n\nThe Norton Disklock-Registered Trademark- Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh\n\nNETWORK/COMMUNICATIONS UTILITIES\n\nThe Norton pcANYWHERE-TM- Windows, MS-DOS, OS/2\n\nThe Norton pcANYWHERE-TM-Access Server OS/2\n\nThe Norton Administrator for Networks-TM- Windows\n\nCONTACT MANAGEMENT\n\nACT!-TM- Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh,\n\nMacintosh\n\nACT!

The MS-DOS\n\nand Windows version includes enhanced 32-bit development support, including 32-\n\nbit MFC on CD-ROM. It supports full template debugging and features a\n\nhierarchical project management system with full dependency tracking. The\n\nMacintosh version includes a new version of THINK Class Library (TLC 2.0), which\n\nallows developers to write applications that are portable to PowerPC\n\nmicroprocessor-based Macintoshes. Symantec C++ for Macintosh also includes\n\nBedrock exception-handling and THINK Inspector that allows quick debugging.\n\nTHINK C provides users with an integrated set of tools, including a C compiler,\n\nto develop software in C for the Macintosh. The product consists of five main\n\ncomponents: a text editor that allows a programmer to enter and modify text\n\nfiles of statements in human-readable C programming language (source code); a\n\ncompiler that translates files of statements in C source code into binary\n\ninstruction modules that a computer can execute (object code); a linker that\n\nenables separate object code modules to be combined to form a complete program;\n\na source level debugger to support the testing of software while it is being\n\ndeveloped; and a project manager that automates the management of all of these\n\nprocesses.\n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT/PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS\n\nTIME LINE is a SQL-based client-server solution that integrates multi-project\n\nmanagement with a business environment. It is a project organizing, scheduling\n\nand resource allocation program. Time Line uses the critical\n\n5\n\npath method to determine project schedules, performs resource leveling and\n\nlead/lag scheduling and presents information in PERT, Gantt and actual versus\n\nplanned formats.\n\nQ&A is an easy-to-use, integrated database management and word processing\n\nprogram with sophisticated report generation capabilities. Q&A also has a\n\nnatural language interface that allows the user to request reports from a\n\ndatabase using plain English sentences instead of database commands.\n\nCLIENT-SERVER TECHNOLOGY\n\nSYMANTEC ENTERPRISE DEVELOPER is the next generation of client-server\n\napplication development tools for creating complex distributed database\n\napplications. Enterprise Developer utilizes a repository based, business model\n\ndriven development approach that allows a corporation to model its business\n\nneeds. Symantec Enterprise Developer's SCALE architecture leverages these\n\nmodels to automate the application development process. Since the company's\n\nbusiness needs are captured in a centralized model stored in a repository, they\n\ncan easily be maintained and modified as needed.\n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES AND SUPPORT.\n\nSymantec markets its products domestically and in major foreign markets,\n\nprimarily through independent software distributors and major retail chains.\n\nDOMESTIC SALES\n\nSymantec's sales strategy is to use a direct field sales force that works with\n\nbusinesses to encourage them to adopt Symantec's products as corporate\n\nstandards. Symantec also employs a distribution sales group to work closely\n\nwith its major distributor and reseller accounts on the management of orders,\n\ninventory level and sell-through to retailers, as well as promotions and selling\n\nactivities. Symantec's telemarketing sales group manages and supports major\n\ndealer and corporate end user accounts. Symantec's sales personnel are located\n\nin major metropolitan areas. At March 31, 1995, Symantec had approximately 110\n\npeople in its domestic direct field sales and telemarketing groups.\n\nWith the expansion to enterprise-wide computing systems markets, Symantec\n\nbelieves that it must develop relationships with customers and deliver products\n\ndeveloped for this market segment.\n\nSymantec maintains distribution relationships with a number of major independent\n\nsoftware distributors, including Ingram Micro D, Inc. (\"Ingram Micro D\") and\n\nMerisel Americas, Inc. (\"Merisel\"). These distributors stock Symantec's\n\nproducts in inventory for redistribution to independent dealers, consultants and\n\nother resellers. Symantec also maintains relationships with many of the major\n\ncomputer and software retailing organizations in the United States, including\n\nEgghead Discount Software (\"Egghead\"), Corporate Software, Inc., Software\n\nSpectrum, Inc. and PC Connection, Inc. Symantec markets to each of these retail\n\naccounts either directly or through one of its authorized national distributors.\n\nLike many other software companies, Symantec also sells product upgrades and\n\ncertain of its products directly to end users through direct mail campaigns. In\n\naddition, Symantec has site licensed many of its products to corporate\n\ncustomers.\n\nApproximately 33% of Symantec's net revenues in the year ended March 31, 1995\n\nwas derived from Symantec's two largest accounts - Ingram Micro D and Merisel.\n\nIngram Micro D represented 22%, 17% and 15% of Symantec's net revenues in fiscal\n\n1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Merisel represented 11%, 13% and 13% of\n\nSymantec's net revenues in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.\n\nSymantec's return policy allows its distributors, subject to certain\n\nlimitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for\n\ncredit towards future purchases. Individual end users may return products\n\nthrough dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of\n\npurchase for a full refund, and retailers may return older versions of products.\n\nVarious distributors and resellers may have more liberal return policies that\n\nmay negatively impact the level of products which are returned to Symantec.\n\nProduct returns occur when the Company introduces upgrades and new versions of\n\nproducts or when distributors order too much product. In addition, competitive\n\nfactors often require the Company to offer rights of return for products that\n\ndistributors or retail stores are unable to sell. Symantec has experienced and\n\nmay experience in the future, significant increases in product returns above\n\nhistorical levels from customers of acquired companies after the acquisition is\n\ncompleted.\n\n6\n\nSymantec prepares detailed analyses of historical return rate experiences in its\n\nestimation of anticipated returns and maintains reserves for product returns.\n\nIn addition to detailed historical return rates, the Company's estimation of\n\nreturn reserves takes into consideration upcoming product upgrades, current\n\nmarket conditions, customer inventory balances and any other known factors that\n\ncould impact anticipated returns. Based upon returns experienced, the Company's\n\nestimates have been materially accurate. The impact of actual returns net of\n\nsuch provisions has not had a material effect on the Company's liquidity as the\n\nreturns typically result in the issuance of credit towards future purchases as\n\nopposed to cash payments to the distributors.\n\nSymantec's marketing activities include advertising in trade, technical and\n\nbusiness publications; cooperative marketing with distributors, resellers and\n\ndealers; periodic direct mailings to customers and prospective customers; and\n\nparticipation in trade and computer shows. Additionally, the Company typically\n\noffers two types of rebate programs, volume incentive rebates and rebates to end\n\nusers. Volume incentive rebates are made available to Symantec's largest\n\ndistributors and resellers whereby the distributor or reseller earns a rebate as\n\na pre-determined percentage of their purchases of the Company's products.\n\nVolume incentive rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded. The amount of\n\nthese rebates has been consistent for all periods presented and has not had a\n\nmaterial impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company also from time to time\n\noffers rebates to end users who purchase the Company's products. During fiscal\n\n1995, Symantec offered rebates to end users who purchased either pcANYWHERE or\n\nThe Norton AntiVirus. End user rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded.\n\nThese end user rebates have been offered on a limited basis and have not been\n\nmaterial to the Company's results of operations or liquidity in fiscal 1995,\n\n1994 and 1993.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SALES\n\nInternational revenues represented approximately 35%, 33% and 31% of Symantec's\n\nnet revenues in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. At March 31, 1995,\n\nSymantec had approximately 117 sales, marketing and related personnel in its\n\ninternational sales organization.\n\nMost of Symantec's revenues from Canada are derived from sales by affiliates of\n\nSymantec's major United States distributors. In other countries, Symantec sells\n\nits products through authorized distributors. In some countries these\n\ndistributors are restricted to specified territories. Symantec typically adapts\n\nproducts for local markets, including translating the documentation and software\n\nwhere necessary, and prepares comprehensive marketing programs for each local\n\nmarket.\n\nSymantec has established offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany,\n\nHolland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the\n\nUnited Kingdom. These local offices facilitate Symantec's marketing and\n\ndistribution in international markets. The Company's international operations\n\nare subject to certain risks common to foreign operations, such as government\n\nregulations, import restrictions, currency fluctuations, repatriation\n\nrestrictions and, in certain jurisdictions, reduced protection for the Company's\n\ncopyrights and trademarks. Information with respect to international operations\n\nand export sales may be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nincluded in Part IV, Item 14 of this Form 10-K.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\nDuring the March 1994 quarter, Symantec introduced a new product support program\n\nthat provides a wide variety of free and fee-based technical support services to\n\nits customers. Symantec provides its customers with free support via electronic\n\nand automated services as well as 90 days complimentary free telephone support\n\nfor selected products. Symantec accrues the cost of providing this free support\n\nat the time of product sale. In addition, Symantec offers both individual users\n\nand corporate customers a variety of fee-based options designed to meet their\n\nindividual technical support requirements. Fee-based technical support services\n\ndid not generate material revenues in fiscal 1995 or 1994 and are not expected\n\nto generate material revenues in the near future.\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITIONS.\n\nSymantec uses a multiple products sourcing strategy that includes internal\n\ndevelopment, acquisitions of product lines or companies and licensing from\n\nthird-parties. Development of new products and enhancement of existing products\n\nare typically performed by Symantec in individual product groups. Each group's\n\nresponsibilities include\n\n7\n\ndesign, development, documentation and quality assurance. Outside contractors\n\nare used for certain aspects of the product development process.\n\nSymantec uses strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to provide certain\n\ntechnology and products for its overall product strategy. Symantec has\n\ncompleted a number of acquisitions of companies and products and expects to\n\nacquire other companies and products in the future. In addition to the\n\nsignificant business risks associated with acquisitions, which include the\n\nsuccessful combination of the companies in an efficient and timely manner, the\n\ncoordination of research and development and sales efforts, the retention of key\n\npersonnel and the integration of the acquired products, Symantec frequently\n\nincurs significant acquisition expenses for legal, accounting and financial\n\nadvisory services and other costs related to the combination of the companies.\n\nThese costs have in the past had and may, with respect to possible future\n\nacquisitions, have a significant adverse impact on the Company's profitability\n\nand financial resources. There can be no assurance that any of the Company's\n\nacquisitions will be successfully assimilated into the Company's operations. In\n\naddition, the comparison of future Company revenues, expenses and profitability\n\nto historical revenues, expenses and profitability on a pooled basis may be\n\nadversely impacted by the elimination of duplicative products and operating\n\nactivities.\n\nThe Company is devoting substantial efforts to the development of software\n\nproducts that are designed to operate on Microsoft's new operating system\n\n(\"Windows 95\"), which is currently under development and testing. The Company\n\nis also devoting substantial efforts to the development of products for\n\nnetworked operating environments and network management. Due to the inherent\n\nuncertainties of software development projects, there can be no assurance that\n\nany products currently being developed by Symantec, including products being\n\ndeveloped for Windows 95, will be technologically successful, that any resulting\n\nproducts will achieve market acceptance or that the Company will be effective in\n\ncompeting with products currently in the market. There can also be no assurance\n\nthat Symantec will elect to develop software products for the operating\n\nenvironments that ultimately are accepted by the marketplace, including\n\nWindows 95. Development for networked operating environments is more complex\n\nthan development for the desktop and requires a higher level of research and\n\ndevelopment expenditures. As a consequence of the complexity of developing\n\nproducts for networked operating environments and operating systems using\n\ngraphical user interfaces and Symantec's emphasis on technical excellence,\n\nSymantec has experienced delays in the development and delivery of its products\n\nand is likely to experience such delays in the future. Any such delays could\n\nresult in a loss of competitiveness of Symantec's products and could adversely\n\naffect Symantec and its financial results.\n\nSymantec's total research and development expenses were approximately $62.8\n\nmillion, $64.1 million and $71.1 million in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993,\n\nrespectively. Research and development expenditures are charged to operations\n\nas incurred. The decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 1995\n\nis principally due to the consolidation of product development efforts resulting\n\nfrom the acquisition of Central Point. Financial accounting rules requiring\n\ncapitalization of certain software development costs have not materially\n\naffected the Company.\n\nNorton Commander, Norton Backup and elements of certain other programs are\n\nlicensed from third-party developers.\n\nCOMPETITION.\n\nThe microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to\n\nrapid changes in technology and in the strategic direction of major\n\nmicrocomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers. The\n\nCompany's competitiveness depends on its ability to enhance its existing\n\nproducts and to offer new products on a timely basis. The Company has more\n\nlimited resources than certain of its competitors, and must restrict its product\n\ndevelopment efforts to a relatively small number of projects. Further, the\n\nCompany has less experience in the enterprise/network market than many of it\n\ncompetitors and fewer relationships and less experience with systems integrators\n\nand other third-party vendors that provide consulting and implementation\n\nservices necessary to sell many of these products.\n\nHistorically, much of the Company's revenues were derived from products using\n\nthe MS-DOS operating system and its character-based interface, which has been\n\nlargely supplanted by the Microsoft Windows operating environment. With the\n\nanticipated introduction of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, the\n\nCompany's ability to generate revenue from many of its current products will\n\ndepend on its ability to develop new versions and\n\n8\n\nenhancements of those products in a timely manner for the Windows 95 operating\n\nsystem and/or other operating systems that may gain market acceptance. The\n\nCompany has experienced delays in the development and delivery of its products\n\nand may experience such delays in the future, which would result in a loss of\n\ncompetitiveness of the Company's products and could adversely affect the Company\n\nand its financial results.\n\nOperating system vendors such as Microsoft have added features to new versions\n\nof their products that provide some of the same functionality traditionally\n\noffered in Symantec's utilities products. Symantec believes this trend may\n\ncontinue. Microsoft may incorporate advanced utilities in Windows 95 that may\n\ndecrease the demand for certain of the Company's products, including those\n\ncurrently under development. While Symantec plans to continue to improve its\n\nutilities products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over what\n\nmay be provided in operating systems, there is no assurance that these efforts\n\nwill be successful or that such improved products will be accepted by software\n\nusers. Symantec will also attempt to work with operating system vendors in an\n\neffort to make its utilities products compatible with those operating systems,\n\nyet differentiate those utilities products from features included in the\n\noperating systems. However, there is no assurance that these efforts will be\n\nsuccessful.\n\nBecause of the breadth of its product line, Symantec competes with at least one\n\nproduct from many of the major independent software vendors, including Borland\n\nInternational, Inc. (\"Borland\"), Cheyenne Software, Inc. (\"Cheyenne\"), Claris\n\nCorporation, Computer Associates International, Inc. (\"Computer Associates\"),\n\nGupta Corporation (\"Gupta\"), Intel Corporation (\"Intel\"), Lotus Development\n\nCorporation (\"Lotus\"), McAfee Associates, Inc. (\"McAfee\"), Microsoft, Novell,\n\nInc. (\"Novell\") and Software Publishing Corporation (\"Software Publishing\").\n\nFor example, The Norton Enterprise Backup competes with ARCserve from Cheyenne,\n\nNetwork Archivist from Palindrome and Backup Exec from Arcada Software, Inc.\n\nThe Norton Administrator for Networks competes with Microsoft System Management\n\nServer from Microsoft and LanDesk from Intel. Symantec Enterprise Developer\n\ncompetes with PowerBuilder from Sybase, Inc. and SQL Windows from Gupta. Norton\n\nUtilities and Norton Backup compete with operating systems, such as Microsoft's\n\nMS-DOS, IBM's DOS and Novell's DR-DOS, which offer file recovery, anti-virus and\n\nbackup features as well as products from independent utilities vendors. Norton\n\nAntiVirus and Central Point Antivirus compete with Viruscan from McAfee.\n\nSymantec's The Norton pcANYWHERE competes mainly with Laplink from Traveling\n\nSoftware, Carbon Copy from Microcom, Close Up from Norton Lambert and NetRemote\n\nfrom McAfee. ACT! and 1st ACT! compete with Lotus Organizer for Windows from\n\nLotus, Maximizer from Modatech Systems, Inc. and many other personal information\n\nmanagers produced by various software developers. Symantec C++ competes with\n\nC++ compilers from Borland and Microsoft. Norton Desktop for Windows and PC\n\nTools for Windows compete with Dashboard from Starfish Software. Time Line\n\ncompetes most directly with Microsoft Project from Microsoft, SuperProject from\n\nComputer Associates and Harvard Project Manager from Software Publishing. In\n\naddition, these and other Company products compete less directly with a number\n\nof other products that offer levels of functionality different from those\n\noffered by Symantec's products or that were designed for a somewhat different\n\ngroup of end users.\n\nSymantec also competes with microcomputer hardware manufacturers that develop\n\ntheir own software products. Further, Symantec competes with other\n\nmicrocomputer software companies for access to the channels of retail\n\ndistribution and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in\n\ncorporate accounts. Finally, Symantec competes with other software companies in\n\nits efforts to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed\n\nby third parties. Symantec believes that, in the next few years, competition in\n\nthe industry will intensify as most major software companies expand their\n\nproduct lines into additional product categories. Some of Symantec's competitors\n\nhave substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources than\n\nSymantec.\n\nPrice competition is significant in the microcomputer business software market\n\nand may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future,\n\nresulting in reduced profit margins. Additionally, should competitive pressures\n\nin the industry increase, Symantec may have to increase its spending on sales\n\nand marketing as a percentage of revenues, resulting in lower profit margins.\n\nMANUFACTURING AND BACKLOG.\n\nSymantec's product development organization produces a set of master diskettes\n\nand documentation for each product. Most of Symantec's domestic manufacturing\n\nis performed by outside contractors under supervision of\n\n9\n\nSymantec's manufacturing organization. Purchasing of most raw materials and\n\nmost fulfillment of orders is done by Symantec personnel in Symantec's\n\nSunnyvale, California facility. The manufacturing steps that are subcontracted\n\nto outside organizations include the duplication of diskettes and CD-ROM's,\n\nprinting of documentation materials and assembly of the final package. Symantec\n\nperforms diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in its Dublin,\n\nIreland, manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the\n\nUnited States and Canada.\n\nSymantec is often able to acquire materials on a volume-discount basis and has\n\nmultiple sources of supply for certain materials. To date, Symantec has not\n\nexperienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its software\n\nand related documentation and packaging. However, shortages may occur in the\n\nfuture. For example, shortages of certain materials may occur when Microsoft\n\nintroduces new operating systems such as Windows 95.\n\nSymantec normally ships products within one week after receiving an order.\n\nThus, Symantec does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future\n\nperformance.\n\nPRODUCT PROTECTION.\n\nSymantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of\n\ncopyright, patents, trade secret and trademark laws, license agreements and\n\ntechnical measures in an attempt to protect its rights. Despite these\n\nprecautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects\n\nof Symantec's products or to obtain and use information that Symantec regards as\n\nproprietary. All of Symantec's products are protected by copyright, and\n\nSymantec has several patents and patent applications pending. However, existing\n\npatent and copyright laws afford limited practical protection. In addition, the\n\nlaws of some foreign countries do not protect Symantec's proprietary rights in\n\nits products to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Symantec's\n\nproducts are not copy protected.\n\nAs the number of software products in the industry increases and the\n\nfunctionality of these products further overlaps, Symantec believes that\n\nsoftware developers will become increasingly subject to infringement claims.\n\nThis risk is potentially greater for companies, such as Symantec, that obtain\n\ncertain of their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions, since\n\nthey have less direct control over the development of those products.\n\nAdditionally, an increasing number of software patents are being issued, some of\n\nwhich are very broad in nature. This increases the risk that Symantec's\n\nproducts may be subject to claims of patent infringement. Although such claims\n\nmay ultimately prove to be without merit, they can be time consuming and\n\nexpensive to defend. Symantec is currently involved in several lawsuits\n\ninvolving trade secret or patent disputes (See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements included in Part IV, Item 14 of this Form 10-K).\n\nEMPLOYEES.\n\nAs of March 31, 1995, Symantec employed 1,442 people, including 596 in sales,\n\nmarketing and related staff activities, 458 in product development and 388 in\n\nmanagement, manufacturing, administration and finance. None of the employees is\n\nrepresented by a labor union and Symantec has experienced no work stoppages.\n\nSymantec believes that its employee relations are good.\n\nCompetition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense.\n\nSymantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to\n\nrecruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and technical personnel.\n\n10\n\nITEM 2: PROPERTIES.\n\nSymantec's principal locations, all of which are leased, are as follows:\n\nApproximate Expiration\n\nSize of\n\nLocation Purpose (in square feet) Lease\n\n- ---------------------------- ----------------------------------- ---------------- -----\n\nDOMESTIC\n\nCupertino, California\n\nCorporate Headquarters Administration, sales and marketing 87,000 1998\n\nand research and development\n\nDevelopment Tools Development 42,000 2000\n\nSunnyvale, California Manufacturing 78,000 1998\n\nSanta Monica, California Research and development and 81,000 1998\n\nmarketing\n\nSanta Monica, California Research and development 31,000 2000\n\nNovato, California Research and development and 28,000 1996\n\nmarketing\n\nBedford, Massachusetts Research and development and 13,000 1997\n\nmarketing\n\nEugene, Oregon Customer service and technical 167,000 1999\n\nsupport\n\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana Research and development 48,000 1995\n\nand marketing\n\nBeaverton, Oregon Research and development and 51,000 1997\n\nmarketing\n\nHuntington, New York Research and development and 11,000 2000\n\nmarketing\n\nRichardson, Texas Research and development and 4,000 1998\n\nmarketing\n\nShelton, Connecticut Research and development and 21,000 1998\n\nmarketing\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri Research and development 3,000 1996\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\nLeiden, Holland Administration, sales 7,000 1997\n\nand marketing\n\nDublin, Ireland Manufacturing and 44,000 2026\n\ntranslations\n\nSymantec's principal administrative, sales and marketing facility as well as\n\ncertain research and development and support facilities are located in\n\nCupertino, California. The Company leases a number of additional facilities for\n\nmarketing and research and development in the United States and for marketing in\n\nEurope, Australia, Japan and Canada.

The high and low closing sales prices set forth below are as reported on\n\nthe Nasdaq National Market.\n\nFiscal 1995 Fiscal 1994\n\n-------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------\n\nMar. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30,\n\n1995 1994 1994 1994 1994 1993 1993 1993\n\n-------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHigh $ 23.75 $ 19.00 $ 16.13 $ 16.88 $ 18.38 $ 20.25 $ 20.00 $ 18.13\n\nLow 16.13 14.88 10.75 10.06 13.50 15.50 10.88 12.63\n\nAs of March 31, 1995, there were approximately 824 stockholders of record. The\n\nCompany has never paid cash dividends on its stock with the exception of cash\n\ndistributions to stockholders of acquired companies. Symantec anticipates that\n\nit will continue to retain its earnings to finance the growth of its business.\n\nIn addition, the Company's bank line of credit and outstanding convertible\n\nsubordinated debentures limit the payment of cash dividends on common stock (See\n\nNotes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 14\n\nof this Form 10-K).\n\n14\n\nITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\n\nThe following selected financial data is qualified in its entirety by and\n\nshould be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated financial\n\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere herein. During fiscal 1995,\n\nSymantec acquired Intec Systems Corporation (\"Intec\"), Central Point Software,\n\nInc. (\"Central Point\") and SLR Systems, Inc.

Founded in\n\n1982, the Company has offices in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and\n\nEurope.\n\nDue to a number of factors and risks, including the rapid change in hardware and\n\nsoftware technology, market conditions, seasonality in the retail software\n\nmarket, the timing of product announcements, the release of new or enhanced\n\nproducts, the introduction of competitive products by existing or new\n\ncompetitors and the significant risks associated with acquisitions of companies,\n\ntechnology and software product rights, historical results and percentage\n\nrelationships will not necessarily be indicative of the operating results of any\n\nfuture period. The pending release of Windows 95 by Microsoft is a particularly\n\nimportant event that increases the uncertainty and will likely increase the\n\nvolatility of Symantec's results and common stock price over the next twelve\n\nmonths.\n\nThe Company's earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject\n\nto significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Symantec has\n\npreviously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected\n\nby securities analysts, which had an immediate and significant adverse effect on\n\nthe trading price of the Company's common stock. This may occur again in the\n\nfuture. Additionally, as a growing percentage of the Company's revenues are\n\ngenerated from enterprise software products which are frequently sold through\n\nsite licenses which often occur late in the quarter, the Company may not learn\n\nof revenue shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an\n\neven more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's\n\ncommon stock. Finally, the Company participates in a highly dynamic industry,\n\nwhich often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock\n\nprice.\n\nDuring the last three fiscal years, Symantec has acquired the following\n\ncompanies:\n\nShares of Acquired\n\nSymantec Company\n\nCommon Stock\n\nStock Options\n\nCompanies Acquired Date Acquired Issued Assumed\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------ --------- --------\n\nIntec Systems Corporation (\"Intec\") August 31, 1994 133,332 --\n\nCentral Point Software, Inc.

The increase in fiscal 1995 net revenues from the prior year is\n\nprincipally due to an increase in site license and distribution product revenues\n\nwhich was partially offset by a decrease in upgrade and OEM product revenues.\n\nThe increase in site license revenues during fiscal 1995 is primarily due to the\n\nrelease of several new enterprise products which are generally sold through site\n\nlicenses. The decrease in upgrade revenues is primarily due to several products\n\nwhich were intentionally not upgraded in anticipation of the release of the\n\nWindows 95 operating systems.\n\nNet revenues decreased 5% from $344.6 million in fiscal 1993 to $328.3 million\n\nin fiscal 1994. The decrease in fiscal 1994 net revenues from the prior year is\n\nprincipally due to the decrease in Central Point product revenues and lower\n\ndistribution and OEM revenues which was partially offset by increased revenues\n\nfrom new product introductions, increased international revenues and increased\n\nupgrade and site license revenues.\n\nIn March 1994, due to the market's concerns regarding Central Point's long-term\n\nviability and the announced acquisition of Central Point by Symantec, Central\n\nPoint was unable to reasonably estimate future product returns from its\n\ndistributors and resellers. In addition, there were high levels of inventory in\n\nthe distribution channel which had been shipped into the channel prior to the\n\nacquisition. Central Point believed that there was a high risk\n\n17\n\nof this inventory being returned. In accordance with Statement of Financial\n\nAccounting Standards No. 48, Central Point revenue and the related cost of\n\nrevenue for fiscal 1994 for software shipments to Central Point's distributors\n\nand resellers was deferred until sold by the distributors or resellers to the\n\nend user.\n\nAs a result, revenues relating to product inventory at Central Point's\n\ndistributors and resellers as of March 31, 1994 were deferred until sold by the\n\ndistributors or resellers to end users. This revenue and cost of revenue\n\ndeferral resulted in a decrease in domestic net revenues of approximately $5.0\n\nmillion and international net revenues of approximately $10.0 million and an\n\nincrease in the fiscal 1994 loss before provision for income taxes of\n\napproximately $12.3 million. Symantec's marketing and sales programs were\n\nsuccessful in moving the domestic deferred channel inventory through to end\n\nusers. Symantec has also been analyzing returns related to the Central Point\n\nproducts for the last four quarters to determine when such products were being\n\nsold through to end users and in the March 1995 quarter Symantec was able to\n\nassess the remaining Central Point product returns in the domestic distribution\n\nchannel and as a result recognized approximately $3.0 million of domestic net\n\nrevenue previously deferred by Central Point.\n\nSymantec expects to recognize the associated remaining international deferred\n\nrevenue when Symantec is able to verify that the remaining international product\n\nsell-through has occurred and is able to estimate any remaining return\n\nexposures. Symantec expects to recognize the remaining deferred revenue\n\nassociated with this international distributor inventory in the June 1995\n\nquarter.\n\nThe Company's products include enterprise products which are frequently sold\n\nthrough site licenses where a license for multiple workstations is sold to a\n\ncustomer at a negotiated price and desktop software products which are generally\n\nsold through the distribution channel or directly to end-users. Enterprise\n\nproduct revenues are typically comprised of lower volume, high dollar site\n\nlicense transactions compared to desktop product revenues which are typically\n\ncomprised of higher volume, low dollar pre-packaged product transactions. The\n\nprices of site licenses tend to vary based upon the individual products\n\npurchased, the number of units licensed and the number of workstations at the\n\ncustomer's site. There was no material impact to net revenues resulting from\n\nchanges in desktop product pricing.\n\nPrice competition is significant in the microcomputer business software market\n\nand may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future,\n\nresulting in reduced profit margins. Should competitive pressures in the\n\nindustry continue to increase, Symantec may be required to increase its spending\n\non sales, marketing and research and development as a percentage of net\n\nrevenues, resulting in lower profit margins. In addition, aggressive pricing\n\nstrategies of competitors in other software markets, some of whom have\n\nsignificantly more financial resources than Symantec, may further cause the\n\nCompany to reduce software prices and/or increase sales and marketing expenses\n\non a number of the Company's products.\n\nNet revenues from international sales grew from approximately $106.8 million in\n\nfiscal 1993 to $109.3 million in fiscal 1994 and to $115.6 million in fiscal\n\n1995 and represented 31%, 33% and 35% of net revenues, respectively. The\n\nincrease in international sales from fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1995 is largely due\n\nto the favorable impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates during\n\nfiscal 1995.\n\nDuring fiscal 1995, Symantec released several new or upgraded enterprise\n\nproducts, including The Norton Administrator for Networks v. 1.5, The Norton\n\nEnterprise Backup v. 1.0, The Norton pcANYWHERE Access Server v. 1.0, The Norton\n\npcANYWHERE for Windows v. 2.0, Symantec Enterprise Developer v. 2.0, The Norton\n\nAntiVirus for Netware v. 2.0, ACT! Mobile Link for Windows v. 2.0, Symantec C++\n\nv. 7.0 for Windows, Time Line for Windows v. 6.1, NetControl v. 1.0 and Symantec\n\nAntiVirus for Macintosh Administrator v. 4.0. The Company also released a\n\nnumber of new desktop products during fiscal 1995, including More PC Tools for\n\nDOS and Windows, Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh v. 4.0, MacTools Pro v. 4.0,\n\nACT! v. 2.0 for Macintosh and ACT! v. 1.1 for the HP Palmtops, Disklock MAC v.\n\n3.0 and The Norton Utilities for Macintosh v. 3.1.\n\nEnhanced product releases typically result in net revenue increases during the\n\nfirst three to six months following their introduction due to upgrade purchases\n\nby existing users, usually at discounted prices, and initial inventory purchases\n\nby the Company's distributors. In addition, between the date the Company\n\nannounces a new version or new product and the date of release, distributors,\n\ndealers and end users often delay purchases, cancel orders or return products in\n\nanticipation of the availability of the new version or new product.\n\n18\n\nThe Company's pattern of revenues and earnings may also be affected by a\n\nphenomenon known as \"channel fill.\" Channel fill occurs following the\n\nintroduction of a new product or a new version of a product as distributors buy\n\nsignificant quantities of the new product or version in anticipation of sales of\n\nsuch product or version. Following such purchases, the rate of distributors'\n\npurchases often declines in a material amount, depending on the rates of\n\npurchases by end users or \"sell-through.\" The phenomenon of \"channel fill\" may\n\nalso occur in anticipation of price increases or in response to sales promotions\n\nor incentives, some of which may be designed to encourage customers to\n\naccelerate purchases that might otherwise occur in later periods. Channels may\n\nalso become filled simply because the distributors are unable to, or do not,\n\nsell their inventories to retail distribution or end users as anticipated. If\n\nsell-through does not occur at a sufficient rate, distributors will delay\n\npurchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order\n\nto reduce their inventories. Such order delays or cancellations can cause\n\nmaterial fluctuations in revenues from one quarter to the next. The impact is\n\nsomewhat mitigated by the Company's deferral of revenue associated with\n\ninventories estimated to be in excess of levels deemed appropriate in the\n\ndomestic distribution channel; however, net revenues may still be materially\n\naffected favorably or adversely by the effects of channel fill. Channel fill\n\ndid not have a material impact on the Company's revenues in fiscal 1995, 1994 or\n\n1993 but may have a material impact in future periods, especially in periods\n\nwhere a large number of new products are introduced. The Company expects to\n\nrelease a large number of new products when Microsoft releases Windows 95.\n\nSymantec believes that many of its customers are moving toward an enterprise-\n\nwide computing oriented environment where more desktop personal computers will\n\nbe interconnected into large local-area and wide-area networks administered by\n\ncorporate MIS departments.\n\nSymantec's entry into the enterprise software market is relatively new and as a\n\nresult, Symantec is beginning to compete with companies with which it has not\n\npreviously competed. As a result, there is uncertainty regarding customer\n\nacceptance of the Company's products as Symantec has not been a major supplier\n\nin the enterprise market. These factors increase the uncertainty of forecasting\n\nfinancial results. While the Company expects the market's shift toward\n\nenterprise products to continue, there can be no assurance that the Company's\n\nenterprise products will be successful or will gain customer acceptance.\n\nWith the expansion to enterprise-wide computing systems markets, Symantec\n\nbelieves that it must continue to develop relationships with systems integrators\n\nand other third-party vendors that provide consulting and integration services\n\nto customers and deliver products developed for this market segment.\n\nFurthermore, the length of the sales cycle with respect to enterprise products\n\nis longer and customers of enterprise products may take delivery of a product\n\nsubject to integration and acceptance by the customer. In addition, a very high\n\nproportion of enterprise product sales are completed in the last few days of\n\neach quarter, in part because customers are able, or believe that they are able,\n\nto negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms. Each of these factors\n\nincrease the risk that forecasts of quarterly financial results will not be\n\nachieved.\n\nApproximately 22% and 11% or a total of 33% of the Company's net revenues in\n\nfiscal 1995 were from sales to two large distributors. These customers tend to\n\nmake the great majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter, in\n\npart because they are able, or believe that they are able, to negotiate lower\n\nprices and more favorable terms. This end-of-period buying pattern means that\n\nforecasts of quarterly and annual financial results are particularly vulnerable\n\nto the risk that they will not be achieved, either because expected sales do not\n\noccur or because they occur at lower prices or on less favorable terms to the\n\nCompany. The Company's distribution customers also carry the products of the\n\nCompany's competitors, some of which have greater financial resources than the\n\nCompany. The distributors have limited capital to invest in inventory and their\n\ndecisions to purchase the Company's products is partly a function of pricing,\n\nterms and special promotions offered by the Company as well as by its\n\ncompetitors over which the Company has no control and which it cannot predict.\n\nWhile Symantec's diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in\n\nquarterly net revenues, these fluctuations have occurred recently and are likely\n\nto occur in the future. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of\n\nfactors, including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced\n\nversions of its products and product upgrades, the introduction of competitive\n\nproducts by existing or new competitors, reduced demand for any given product,\n\nthe market's transition between operating systems, and the transition from a\n\ndesktop PC environment to an enterprise-wide environment and may cause\n\nsignificant fluctuations in sales revenues and, accordingly, operating results.\n\n19\n\nThe Company is devoting substantial efforts to the development of software\n\nproducts that are designed to operate on Microsoft's new operating system\n\n(\"Windows 95\"), which is currently under development and testing. Microsoft may\n\nincorporate advanced utilities in Windows 95 or in future releases of Windows 95\n\nthat may decrease the demand for certain of the Company's products, including\n\nthose currently under development. Further, should Microsoft incur further\n\ndelays in the development or release of Windows 95, which is scheduled by\n\nMicrosoft to be released in August 1995, should Windows 95 not achieve market\n\nacceptance, or should Symantec be unable to successfully or timely develop\n\nproducts that operate under Windows 95, Symantec's future revenues and,\n\naccordingly, profitability would be immediately and significantly adversely\n\naffected. In addition, as the timing of delivery and adoption of many products\n\nis dependent on Microsoft's delivery of beta and final versions of Windows 95\n\nand the adoption rate of Windows 95, which the Company and securities analysts\n\nare unable to predict, the Company's and securities analysts' ability to\n\nforecast the Company's revenues is being adversely impacted. Also, the Company\n\nexpects that demand for certain of its existing utility products will decline in\n\nadvance of the Windows 95 release. It is difficult for securities analysts or\n\nthe Company to forecast the extent of this decline. For all of the preceding\n\nreasons, there is a heightened risk that revenues and profits will not be in\n\nline with analysts' expectations in the periods preceding and following the\n\nintroduction of Windows 95.\n\nThe length of Symantec's product development cycle has generally been greater\n\nthan Symantec originally expected. Although such delays have undoubtedly had a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on Symantec's business, Symantec is not able to quantify\n\nthe magnitude of revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any\n\nparticular delay because Symantec is not able to predict the amount of revenues\n\nthat would have been obtained had the original development expectations been\n\nmet. Delays in product development, including products being developed for\n\nWindows 95, are likely to occur in the future and could have a material adverse\n\neffect on the amount and timing of future revenues. Due to the inherent\n\nuncertainties of software development projects, Symantec does not generally\n\ndisclose or announce the specific expected shipment date of the Company's\n\nproduct introductions.\n\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that any products currently being\n\ndeveloped by Symantec, including products being developed for Windows 95, will\n\nbe technologically successful, that any resulting products will achieve market\n\nacceptance or that the Company's products will be effective in competing with\n\nproducts either currently in the market or introduced in the future.\n\nDuring fiscal 1993, Symantec believes revenues were adversely affected by an\n\nunexpected substantial price reduction in 486-based personal computers that\n\ncaused a shift in customer spending from software to personal computer hardware.\n\nSymantec also believes that the shift was caused by the introduction of Windows\n\n3.1, which requires more computing capability. If the next class of personal\n\ncomputers, including those based on Intel's Pentium or P6 microprocessor or\n\nMotorola's Power-PC, are also rapidly reduced in price, there may be another\n\nunexpected shift in customer buying away from software and Symantec's products,\n\nwhich could result in significantly reduced revenues and a material adverse\n\neffect on operating results. Symantec has noted that Pentium processors are\n\nbeing marketed aggressively by Intel. The introduction of Windows 95 and a\n\ndecline in the price of Pentium processors could cause a shift in customer\n\nspending from software to personal computer hardware and could adversely impact\n\nthe Company's net revenues.\n\nThe Company estimates and maintains reserves for product returns. Increased\n\nproduct returns occur when the Company introduces product upgrades and new\n\nproducts and discontinues certain software products. In addition, competitive\n\nfactors require the Company to offer increased rights of return for products\n\nthat distributors or retail stores are unable to sell. The Company has set its\n\nreserves for returns in accordance with historical product return experience.\n\nSetting reserves involves making significant judgments about future competitive\n\nconditions and product life cycles. Those judgments involve evaluating\n\ninformation that often is incomplete, unclear and in conflict. Symantec\n\nprepares detailed analyses of historical return rate experiences in its\n\nestimation of reserves for product returns. In addition to detailed historical\n\nreturn rates, the Company's estimation of return reserves takes into\n\nconsideration upcoming product upgrades, current market conditions, distributor\n\nand \"superstore\" inventory balances and sell-through volume and any other known\n\nfactors that may impact anticipated product returns. Based upon returns\n\nexperienced, the Company's estimates have been materially accurate. However,\n\nthere can be no assurance that historical experience will be an accurate guide\n\nfor the future because the rate of returns is primarily a function of the\n\ncompetitive state of the market in the future and thus, in large part, is a\n\nfunction of the actions of the Company's competitors, which the Company cannot\n\naccurately anticipate. The Company's product return\n\n20\n\nreserve balances typically fluctuate from period to period based upon the level\n\nand timing of product upgrade releases. Product return reserve balances at\n\nMarch 31, 1995 were lower than reserve balances at March 31, 1994. The decrease\n\nis primarily due to Central Point product shipments which were previously\n\ndeferred and subsequently sold through to the end users. The level of actual\n\nproduct returns and related product return reserves is largely a factor of the\n\nlevel of product sell-in (gross revenue) from normal sales activity and the\n\nreplacement of obsolete quantities with the current version of the Company's\n\nproduct. As a result, gross revenues generally move in the same direction as\n\nproduct returns. Changes in the levels of product returns and related product\n\nreturn reserves are generally offset by changing levels of gross revenue and,\n\ntherefore, do not typically have a material impact on reported net revenues.\n\nThe Company operates with relatively little backlog; therefore, if near-term\n\ndemand for the Company's products weakens in a given quarter, there could be a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on revenues and on the Company's operating results.\n\nSymantec maintains a research and development facility in Santa Monica,\n\nCalifornia that was damaged during the January 1994 earthquake in Southern\n\nCalifornia. Much of the Company's administration, sales and marketing,\n\nmanufacturing facilities and research and development efforts are located on the\n\nwest coast of the United States. Future earthquakes or other natural disasters\n\ncould cause a significant disruption to the Company's operations and may cause\n\ndelays in product development that could adversely impact future revenues of the\n\nCompany.\n\nAlso, Symantec's order entry department is located in Oregon, with shipments\n\nbeing made from a warehouse in California. Order entry and shipping is\n\nsimilarly separated in Europe. A disruption in communications between these\n\nfacilities, particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter would likely result in\n\nan unexpected shortfall in revenues and could result in unexpected losses.\n\nDuring the March 1994 quarter, Symantec introduced a new product support program\n\nthat provides a wide variety of free and fee-based technical support services to\n\nits customers. Symantec provides its customers with free support via electronic\n\nand automated services as well as 90 days complimentary free telephone support\n\nfor certain of the Company's products. In addition, Symantec offers both\n\nindividual users and corporate customers a variety of fee-based support options\n\nfor certain of the Company's products, designed to meet their individual\n\ntechnical support requirements. Fee-based technical support services did not\n\ngenerate significant revenues in the years ended March 31, 1995 and 1994 and are\n\nnot expected to generate material revenues in the near future.\n\nGROSS MARGIN.\n\nGross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues\n\nconsists primarily of manufacturing expenses, manuals, packaging, royalties paid\n\nto third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write-off of\n\ncapitalized software. Amortization of capitalized software, including\n\namortization and the write-off of both purchased product rights and capitalized\n\nsoftware development expenses, totaled $6.4 million, $17.8 million and $17.5\n\nmillion for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The decrease in\n\namortization and write-off of capitalized software costs in fiscal 1995 over\n\nfiscal 1994 and 1993 is due to the write-off of certain previously capitalized\n\nsoftware costs by Central Point during fiscal 1994 and by Fifth Generation in\n\nfiscal 1993.\n\nGross margins increased to 82% of net revenues in fiscal 1995 from 76% and 70%\n\nin fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively. The increase in the gross margin\n\npercentage in fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994 was largely due to the growth\n\nin higher margin enterprise products which are typically sold through site\n\nlicenses and is also due to Symantec's ability to manufacture Central Point\n\nproducts with a lower cost structure than Central Point was able to prior to the\n\nmerger. In addition, the decrease in amortization expense of capitalized\n\nsoftware contributed to the increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal\n\n1995. The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 1994 compared to\n\nfiscal 1993 was due to improvements in the gross margin percentage of Fifth\n\nGeneration's products and the gradual shift in Symantec's product mix from\n\ndesktop products toward higher margin enterprise products in fiscal 1994 which\n\nwas partially offset by the decline in Central Point's gross margin percentage\n\ndue to its software write-offs. This improvement in the gross margin percentage\n\nof Fifth Generation's products was largely due to the absence of significant\n\nsoftware amortization and write-off of capitalized software by Fifth Generation\n\nduring fiscal 1993. Additionally, Symantec was able to produce the Fifth\n\nGeneration products with a lower cost structure than Fifth Generation was able\n\nto prior to the merger. Symantec believes that the gross margin percentage will\n\nremain near the current level unless there is a significant change in Symantec's\n\nnet revenues.\n\n21\n\nThe microcomputer business software market has been subject to rapid changes\n\nthat can be expected to continue. Future technology or market changes,\n\nincluding the release of Windows 95, may cause certain products to become\n\nobsolete more quickly than expected and thus may result in capitalized software\n\nwrite-offs and an increase in required inventory reserves and, therefore,\n\nreduced gross margins and net income. In addition, the modifications to\n\ncomputer software, including the correction of software bugs, may result in\n\nsignificant inventory rework costs, including the cost of replacing inventory in\n\nthe distribution channel.\n\nOn December 31, 1993, Symantec acquired certain technology for developing an\n\narchitecture and tools to build client-server applications from DataEase\n\nInternational, Inc. in exchange for 391,456 shares of Symantec common stock and\n\ncancellation of the principal and accrued interest on a $1.0 million outstanding\n\nnote receivable. The Company capitalized approximately $7.7 million of\n\npurchased product rights as a result of this transaction.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased 2% to $62.8 million or 19% of net\n\nrevenues in fiscal 1995 from $64.1 million or 20% of net revenues in fiscal\n\n1994, and was $71.1 million or 21% of net revenues in fiscal 1993. The decrease\n\nin research and development expenses in fiscal 1995 is principally due to the\n\nconsolidation of product development efforts resulting from the acquisition of\n\nCentral Point. The decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 1994\n\nwas primarily due to lower spending on the Company's security utility product\n\ndevelopment efforts resulting from the consolidation of the development efforts\n\nof Symantec and Fifth Generation and a $2.0 million decrease in spending\n\nrelating to Central Point products.\n\nSymantec believes increased research and development expenditures will be\n\nnecessary in order to remain competitive and expects research and development\n\nexpenses to increase in dollar amount.\n\nResearch and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred.\n\nFinancial accounting rules requiring capitalization of certain internal software\n\ndevelopment costs did not materially affect the Company in the periods\n\npresented.\n\nSALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased 11% to $147.6 million or 44% of net\n\nrevenues in fiscal 1995 from $165.1 million or 50% of net revenues in fiscal\n\n1994. The decrease in fiscal 1995 was principally due to the elimination of\n\nduplicative sales organizations as a result of the acquisition of Central Point.\n\nSubsequent to the acquisition of Central Point by Symantec in fiscal 1995,\n\nvarious duplicative sales organizations were eliminated as a result of the\n\ncombination of the companies. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 1994\n\ndecreased 8% over fiscal 1993 due to the elimination of duplicative sales\n\norganizations as a result of the acquisitions of Fifth Generation and Contact\n\nand the reduction of sales and marketing expenses incurred by Central Point.\n\nSymantec believes substantial sales and marketing efforts are essential to\n\nachieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance Symantec's competitive\n\nposition. Accordingly, with the continued expansion of its international\n\noperations, as well as the introduction of new and upgraded products, including\n\nproducts currently being developed for Windows 95, Symantec expects the expenses\n\nassociated with these efforts to increase in dollar amount and to continue to\n\nconstitute its most significant operating expense. There can be no assurance\n\nthat these increased sales and marketing efforts will be successful. Symantec\n\nbelieves that the Company's sales and marketing expenses may increase\n\nsignificantly in the September 1995 quarter to support the introduction of\n\nWindows 95 products. These sales and marketing expenses may become committed,\n\nand may be unable to be reduced, even if Microsoft announces a delay in Windows\n\n95. This situation would have a material adverse impact on profitability.\n\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 33% from $25.2 million or 8% of\n\nnet revenues in fiscal 1994 to $17.0 million or 5% of net revenues in fiscal\n\n1995. This decrease was principally due to benefits resulting from the\n\nconsolidation of the general and administrative functions of Symantec and\n\nCentral Point. Subsequent to the acquisition of Central Point by Symantec in\n\nfiscal 1995, various duplicative general and administrative functions were\n\neliminated as a result of the combination of the companies. In addition,\n\ngeneral and administrative expenses\n\n22\n\ndecreased due to the settlement of two class action lawsuits in fiscal 1994\n\nresulting in a decrease in legal expenses during fiscal 1995.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 19% from $31.1 million or 9% of\n\nnet revenues in fiscal 1993 to $25.2 million or 8% of net revenues in fiscal\n\n1994. This decrease was principally due to benefits resulting from the\n\nconsolidation of the general and administrative functions of Contact and Fifth\n\nGeneration at Symantec's corporate headquarters, which was partially offset by\n\nincreases in legal expenses associated with two class action lawsuits (See\n\nNote 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nFuture growth of the Company is expected to result in an increase in the dollar\n\namount of general and administrative spending from current levels.\n\nACQUISITION, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES.\n\nACQUISITION EXPENSES. In connection with the various acquisitions completed in\n\nfiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and\n\nNote 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), significant acquisition\n\nexpenses were incurred. These acquisition expenses principally included fees\n\nfor legal, accounting and financial advisory services, the write-off of\n\nduplicative capitalized technology, the modification of certain development\n\ncontracts and expenses related to the combination of the companies, including\n\nthe elimination of duplicative and excess facilities and personnel. These\n\ncharges approximated $9.5 million, $25.9 million and $5.1 million in fiscal\n\n1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Central Point and SLR, Symantec recorded\n\ntotal acquisition charges of $9.5 million in fiscal 1995. The charges included\n\n$3.2 million for legal, accounting and financial advisory services, $1.0 million\n\nfor the write-off of duplicative product-related expenses and modification of\n\ncertain development contracts, $0.9 million for the elimination of duplicative\n\nand excess facilities, $3.1 million for personnel severance and outplacement\n\nexpenses, and $1.3 million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain\n\noperational activities and other acquisition related expenses.\n\nSymantec has completed a number of acquisitions and expects to acquire other\n\ncompanies in the future. In addition to the significant business risks\n\nassociated with acquisitions, including the successful combination of the\n\ncompanies in an efficient and timely manner, the coordination of research and\n\ndevelopment and sales efforts, the retention of key personnel and the\n\nintegration of the acquired products, Symantec typically incurs significant\n\nacquisition expenses for legal, accounting and financial advisory services, the\n\nwrite-off of duplicative technology and other expenses related to the\n\ncombination of the companies. These expenses may have a significant adverse\n\nimpact on the Company's future profitability and financial resources.\n\nRESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. During fiscal 1994, Symantec implemented a plan to\n\nconsolidate and centralize certain operational activities (See Note 10 of Notes\n\nto Consolidated Financial Statements). The plan was designed to reduce\n\noperating expenses and enhance operational efficiencies by centralizing certain\n\norder administration, technical support and customer service activities in\n\nEugene, Oregon. In fiscal 1994, the Company recorded a charge of $4.7 million,\n\nwhich included $1.1 million for the elimination of duplicative and excess\n\nfacility expenses, $1.5 million for the relocation of the Company's existing\n\noperations and equipment, $1.1 million for employee relocation expenses and $1.0\n\nmillion for employee severance payments. The Company's centralization has been\n\ncompleted.\n\nDuring fiscal 1994, Central Point incurred $16.0 million of expenses related to\n\nthe restructuring of its operations in order to reduce its overall cost\n\nstructure and to redirect its software development and marketing efforts away\n\nfrom the personal desktop computer market toward personal computer network\n\nmarkets. The charge included $6.2 million for employee severance, outplacement\n\nand relocation expenses, $5.6 million for the write-off of certain excess fixed\n\nand intangible assets, $1.8 million for lease abandonments and facility\n\nrelocation and $2.4 million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain\n\noperational activities and other related expenses. This restructuring has been\n\nsubstantially completed.\n\nDuring fiscal 1993, Symantec recorded a $4.4 million charge for expenses related\n\nto the restructuring of certain operational functions within the Company. The\n\nplan was designed to reduce operating expenses and reallocate resources from DOS\n\nproducts to Windows and Development Tools products. This charge included $1.0\n\nmillion for the elimination of excess facilities, $0.4 million for the\n\nrelocation of certain employees and $3.0 million for\n\n23\n\noutplacement expenses and severance payments associated with the reduction in\n\nstaffing. This restructuring has been completed.\n\nDuring fiscal 1993, Central Point incurred $0.7 million of charges related to\n\nthe restructuring of its operations, including the sale of its manufacturing\n\noperations, personnel relocation and severance, and the write-off of certain\n\nproperty and equipment. This restructuring has been completed.\n\nOTHER EXPENSES. During fiscal 1994, Symantec reached an agreement with the\n\nplaintiffs and Symantec's insurance carriers to settle two securities class\n\nactions and a related derivative lawsuit brought by stockholders of Symantec\n\n(See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The combined\n\nsettlement amount of the cases was $19.0 million, approximately $12.5 million of\n\nwhich was paid by Symantec's insurance carriers. Symantec recorded a charge in\n\nfiscal 1994 of $6.5 million, representing Symantec's portion of the settlement.\n\nDuring fiscal 1993, the Company recorded a $2.6 million charge for estimated\n\ntotal legal fees expected to be incurred in connection with the Borland civil\n\nlawsuit and the related criminal prosecution (See Notes 10 and 11 of Notes to\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements).\n\nSymantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative\n\nproceedings incidental to its business (See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements). The Company intends to defend all of these lawsuits\n\nvigorously and although an unfavorable outcome could occur in one or more of the\n\ncases, the final resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate,\n\nis not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of\n\nthe Company. However, depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable\n\nresolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's future results\n\nof operations or cash flows could be materially adversely effected in a\n\nparticular period.\n\nIn fiscal 1994, Central Point purchased from unrelated parties certain in-\n\nprocess software technologies for $3.0 million which was immediately expensed.\n\n(See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nAs of March 31, 1995, total accrued acquisition and restructuring expenses were\n\n$8.6 million and included $1.1 million for the modification of certain\n\ndevelopment contracts, $1.4 million for the elimination of duplicative and\n\nexcess facilities, $1.3 million for employee severance, outplacement and\n\nrelocation expenses and $4.8 million for the consolidation and discontinuance of\n\ncertain operational activities and other acquisition related expenses.\n\nINTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).\n\nInterest income was $3.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 1995,\n\n1994 and 1993, respectively. The increase in interest income in fiscal 1995\n\nover fiscal 1994 is due to higher average invested cash balances and higher\n\naverage interest rates on invested cash. Interest expense was $2.4 million,\n\n$2.5 million and $1.4 million in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The\n\nincrease in interest expenses in fiscal 1995 and 1994 over fiscal 1993 is\n\nprincipally due to interest expense on convertible subordinated debentures which\n\nwere issued on April 2, 1993, which was partially offset by the retirement of\n\nacquired company debt. On April 26, 1995, convertible subordinated debentures\n\ntotaling $10.0 million were converted into 833,333 shares of Symantec common\n\nstock. As a result, interest expense is expected to decrease in fiscal 1996.\n\nOther expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange losses from\n\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company conducts business in various foreign currencies and is therefore\n\nsubject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate\n\nmovements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are recorded and\n\nthe date that they are settled. Symantec utilizes some natural hedging to\n\nmitigate the Co"
