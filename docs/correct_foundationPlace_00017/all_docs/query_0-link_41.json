These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied in this presentation. Such risk factors include those related to: maintaining customer and partner relationships; the anticipated growth of certain market segments, particularly with regard to security and storage; the competitive environment in the software industry; changes to operating systems and product strategy by vendors of operating systems; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the timing and market acceptance of new product releases and upgrades; the successful development of new products and integration of acquired businesses; and the degree to which these products and businesses gain market acceptance. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward‐looking statements in this presentation. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10‐K for the year ended March 29, 2013. Any information regarding pre-release Symantec offerings, future updates or other planned modifications is subject to ongoing evaluation by Symantec and therefore subject to change. This information is provided without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Customers who purchase Symantec offerings should make their purchase decision based upon features that are currently available. We assume no obligation to update any forward‐looking information contained in this presentation.\n\n3. 3 Use of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information Our results of operations have undergone significant changes due to a series of acquisitions, the impact of SFAS 123(R), impairment charges and other corporate events. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non‐GAAP financial measures. The method we use to produce non‐GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Our non‐GAAP results are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our non‐GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non‐GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non‐GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to the financial review presentation, and which can also be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at www.symantec.com/invest.\n\n4. 4 Founded in 1982 More than 20,000 Employees Operations in 48 Countries 100 Percent of the Fortune 500 are Customers More Than 1,900 Global Patents $7 Billion Revenue\n\n5. 5 Protects More Than 1 Billion Systems Reviews 8 Billion Email Messages and 1.4 Billion Web Request a Day Protects More Than 135 Million Consumers with Norton Security Products The Largest Backup and Recovery Company on the Planet\n\n6. 6\n\n7. 7 Key Symantec Strengths Strong Assets Deep Expertise and Capability Portfolio of Leading Products Strong Brands Reach and Installed Base 7\n\n8. 8 Financial Strength – FY13 Business Snapshot Revenue Mix by Geography Americas EMEA APJ 54% 27% 19% Segment Revenue $ (in millions) Y/Y Growth (FX adjusted) User Productivity & Protection $2,976 2% Information Security $1,301 10% Information Management $2,629 5% FY13 $6.9 billion 3%* Revenue Mix by Segment 8*Organic FX adjusted Y/Y Revenue Growth UPP 43% 19% IS 38% IM (Americas includes the U.S., Latin America, and Canada)\n\n9. 9 Corporate Responsibility Investing in the community, workplace and environment • STEM Education, Online Safety, Diversity, Environment • $24M philanthropy in FY13 • More than 25,000 hours volunteered • Annual Code of Conduct training • Signatory UN Global Compact • 100% Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index • Signatory, Women’s Empowerment Principles • FTSE4Good Global Index • Dow Jones Sustainability Index – North America and World • 2013 World’s Most Ethical Companies • Energy-saving Green IT solutions • 20 LEED-certified buildings globally • 12 Energy Star buildings globally • Established employee Green Teams • #40 NewsWeek Green Rankings\n\n10. 10 Reliability of the Public Infrastructure Control of Identities & Privacy Financial Integrity Intellectual Property Protecting What Matters 10\n\n11.
