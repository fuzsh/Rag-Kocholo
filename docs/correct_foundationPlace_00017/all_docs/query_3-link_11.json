        "text": "Cupertino-based Symantec is not the relatively small company that Enrique Salem joined in 1990 — back when it acquired Peter Norton Computing, where Salem was a lead engineer working on PC utilities and anti-virus programs.\n\nNow one of the world’s leading software vendors, with annual sales of $6 billion, Symantec is still known for its Norton PC tools, the biggest seller in the consumer market. But more than two-thirds of its revenue comes from data management, storage and security software for businesses and large data centers.\n\nThe 43-year-old Salem, who officially took the reins as Symantec’s CEO on Saturday, has been chief operating officer since January 2008 and was seen as a likely successor even before CEO John Thompson announced his retirement plans in the fall. Salem had left the company in 1999, but returned in 2004 when Symantec acquired BrightMail, where he was CEO. Since then, he’s held a series of top posts while Symantec acquired more companies and expanded further into data storage and other areas.\n\nSome of that growth carried a price: Symantec posted a $6.8 billion loss for its last quarter, after taking a “non-cash” write-down for the decline in goodwill value of some assets. Companies typically do this when stock prices fall and past acquisitions become less valuable than their purchase price. But the write-down didn’t faze Wall Street analysts, who noted that without it, Symantec had increased profit by 20 percent and beat earnings expectations in a recessionary period.\n\nSymantec also has a small but growing consulting service for business clients and is expanding its consumer offerings to include online storage and a program that lets parents track their kids’ Web surfing in real time. In a recent conversation, Salem said the company’s top priorities are helping customers with security, managing their data and providing software as a service.\n\nThe following transcript of the Mercury News’ conversation with Salem has been edited for clarity and length:\n\nQ: How will your role change when you become chief executive? You recently announced a realignment of top managers, but you didn’t name a replacement for yourself as chief operating officer.\n\nA: I’m not going to put a COO in place right now. I think we’ve put an organization together now that has the right alignment. With the culture that we’re putting in place, around high levels of authority and accountability, I feel I will have time to be more externally focused. I’ll be spending more time with customers, investors, analysts, press and partners.\n\nQ: So right now, are your biggest challenges related more to the economy or to the technical issues of serving your customers?\n\nA: There’s never only one thing. In this environment, the good news is that what we do is still very important to companies. They can’t stop securing their business, they can’t stop backing up data. The economy’s going to be what the economy’s going to be.\n\nQ: How are your business customers reacting to the recession?\n\nA: They’re looking at: “How do I use what I’ve got?” They don’t want ROI (return on investment) that goes out more than six or 12 months. Sales cycles are a little longer and we’ve got to show clear return on investment.\n\nThe good news is we can do that. I’ve been saying to people, “Stop buying storage. Buy no more hardware. Our software can help you make better use of what you have.” They can save a ton of money and that’s what they’re looking for.\n\nQ: Your last earnings report had a substantial write-down for goodwill impairment. Was that primarily due to the Veritas purchase? (Symantec, in its largest acquisition, bought the storage software maker for $10 billion in 2005.) Does it suggest that deal was a mistake?\n\nA: Not at all. We’ve done 30 acquisitions in recent years. Veritas was our largest, but if you look at the amount of goodwill on our balance sheets, it actually touches all the segments. The write-down was across the board.\n\nIt really is driven by accounting. When the equity markets go down, you get forced to evaluate the goodwill on your balance sheet, based on how the whole company is valued. But there was no change to the strength of our fundamental business.\n\nQ: On the consumer side of your business, you’ve called the growing popularity of netbooks “an exciting new opportunity.” You’ve got a deal to ship Norton software on computers made by Asus (one of the first PC makers to introduce a scaled-down laptop). Are you seeing a big revenue potential there, as overall PC sales are slowing?\n\nA: If you go online, you’ve got to be protected. There are bad people out there. Whether it’s a netbook or a standard PC or a Mac, for that matter, we know it needs to be protected.\n\nQ: Microsoft got some attention a few years ago when it started selling security software. Now they’ve switched to giving away a free product. Are you concerned that a competitor that size can hurt your business?\n\nA: We feel like they haven’t been successful in security and that’s why they’re going to a new strategy. If anybody else did what they’ve done, people would say they lost.\n\nQ: What do you think are the biggest security threats today?\n\nA: While you’ve got to be protected against the hackers — people who are trying to take over your computer and use it to launch attacks on others — the real issue is the insider, the employee who’s got credentials, who can get into your computer and steal information and wreak havoc.\n\nWe have technologies that understand what it is you are trying to protect, and if anybody tries to copy your information, or move it inappropriately, you can detect that. I don’t want to minimize (the danger posed by hackers), but I think insiders are a bigger threat.\n\nContact Brandon Bailey at bbailey@mercurynews.com or 408-920-5022."
