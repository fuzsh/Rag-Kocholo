        "text": "Symantec, RapidSSL, Thawte and GeoTrust acquired by DigiCert\n\nOn October 31, 2017, DigiCert, Inc. acquired Symantec Corporation the business of providing and supporting Symantec’s Website Security and PKI products and services. All CAs like Thawte, Symantec, RapidSSL and GeoTrust will be issued using DigiCert infrastructure starting at 1st DEC 2017. That was done to prevent any conflicts with Google.\n\nGoGetSSL is sure that its a great news to all, since together Symantec and DigiCert would increase quality of services, products provided globally and would lead the SSL market for many upcoming years. It is very sad to observe managed actions by many other CAs trying to grab/snatch at least some customers from Symantec during Google distrust problem. Symantec was and stays one of the most professional CA in the World.\n\nGoogle Proposal Background\n\nOn July 27, 2017, Google posted a time-sensitive plan regarding Symantec-issued SSL/TLS server certificates. There are critical dates that will impact your operations:\n\nOn August 1, 2017, Mozilla stated that it intends to follow the timeline proposed by Google and Google reconfirmed the plan above in its most recent post on September 11, 2017.\n\nWhat action is required\n\nSymantec certificates issued prior to June 1, 2016 must be replaced by March 15, 2018. GoGetSSL will replace all affected orders during 8th January 2018 for free. Follow us on Twitter for more updates. Some considerations:\n\nCertificates That Should be Reissued Later\n\nSome customers will have certificates that should be reissued by our Certificate Authority partner, DigiCert, once it begins operations on our behalf on or before December 1, 2017. As we assess the implications of Google’s proposal and upcoming dates, we do not believe you need to take action on additional certificates until that time.\n\nWe will provide a progress update as soon as we have more information, and specific recommendations on the best timing to reissue your remaining certificates."
