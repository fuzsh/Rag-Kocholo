        "text": "Symantec Acquires Software Defined Perimeter and Zero Trust Innovator Luminate Security to Extend the Power of Integrated Cyber Defense in the Cloud Generation\n\nLuminate Delivers Private Secure Application Access to All Users, Regardless of Device, Location or Infrastructure; Significantly Extends Symantec’s Leadership in Cloud Security Beyond Alternative Approaches\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – Feb. 12, 2019 – Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC), the world’s leading cyber security company, today announced the acquisition of Luminate Security, a privately held company with pioneering Software Defined Perimeter technology. Luminate’s Secure Access Cloud™ technology further extends the power of Symantec’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform to users as they access workloads and applications regardless of where those workloads are deployed or what infrastructure they are accessed through.\n\nToday’s sophisticated threats and attacks present unique challenges that require a new mindset, one that moves past a perimeter-based approach reliant on architectures that never contemplated cloud. Luminate’s Secure Access Cloud™ is natively constructed for today’s cloud-oriented, perimeter-less world. This technology allows enterprises to scale private, \"no DNS\" access control, granting user connections only to the specific applications and resources for which they are authorized.\n\n\"Now and in the future, we anticipate more and more corporations will operate their business on infrastructure that is managed by multiple third parties such as Azure, AWS and Google. In this rapidly evolving world, trust in external infrastructure must be carefully considered as corporations can outsource infrastructure but must also remain responsible for data and users. Luminate incorporated into Symantec’s Integrated Cyber Defense puts us at the forefront of security in the cloud era,\" said Greg Clark, president and CEO, Symantec. \"Secure and private access is a cornerstone of cyber defense. We are excited to partner with the Luminate team and look forward to rapid delivery of this unique capability to our customers and continuing to provide quantifiable value to their cloud journey.\"\n\nCompanies and users want frictionless access to applications, whether they are in the cloud or on-premises. At the same time, this access must be protected by best-of-breed security technologies. Stitching security vendors together to achieve this goal is hard and has created complexity for enterprises, exposing new security risks. Symantec’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform unifies cloud and on-premises security across endpoints, networks, email and cloud, protecting against even the most sophisticated threats and reducing cost and complexity.\n\n\"As corporate applications continue to move to the cloud, IT organizations need innovative approaches to address the complexity and security challenges of providing users anywhere, anytime access,\" said Art Gilliland, EVP and GM Enterprise Products, Symantec. \"Luminate Security’s agentless, cloud-delivered service solves these problems and adds a powerful Software Defined Perimeter capability to our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform.\"\n\n\"As a partner, our integrations with Symantec were successful in reducing complexity and increasing security for joint customers. With this next step, we look forward to fully integrating across the entire portfolio and delivering even more innovation to offer complete security for the Cloud Generation,\" said Ofer Smadari, CEO, Luminate Security.\n\nThe acquisition of Luminate continues Symantec’s strategy of acquiring and building best-of-breed security across its portfolio, with a particular focus on \"born in the cloud, for the cloud\" innovations. Symantec made first-mover acquisitions in CASB (cloud access security broker) and web isolation technologies and has delivered a broad set of cloud innovations and integrations across its entire portfolio.\n\nThe Secure Access Cloud service is available immediately.
