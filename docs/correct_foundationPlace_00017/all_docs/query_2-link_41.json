        "text": "Broadcom is acquiring Symantec's enterprise security business for $10.7 billion in cash, the chip and cybersecurity companies confirmed today. The deal does not include Symantec's consumer Norton LifeLock business, which will continue forward on its own.\n\nSymantec apparently plans to lay off about 7 percent of its staff before the deal closes.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom, said:\n\nSymantec did not include its Consumer Cyber Safety business -- Norton LifeLock -- in the deal. That business is \"steady, predictable and we believe can grow at mid-single digits, generating strong cash flow and earnings,\" the company said. The consumer offerings involve Device Security, Identity Threat Protection and Privacy software that protects consumers and small businesses.\n\nThe Norton LifeLock business is expected to grow revenue in the mid-single digits, with continued strong cash flow from operations and expanded earnings growth, the company indicated."
