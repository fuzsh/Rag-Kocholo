Meaning and history

Symantec’s journey began in 1982 when Gary Hendrix founded the company with a grant from the National Science Foundation. Initially focusing on artificial intelligence-related projects, Symantec quickly pivoted to the burgeoning field of computer security software. The company’s first significant breakthrough came with the launch of Norton Antivirus, which set the standard for antivirus protection and computer security. Over the years, Symantec expanded its portfolio through strategic acquisitions and innovative developments, becoming a dominant force in the cybersecurity industry.

The company’s main achievements include pioneering advances in endpoint security, email security, and cloud-based services. Symantec’s Norton Security product has become synonymous with consumer digital safety, protecting millions of users worldwide against malware, phishing, and other cyber threats. In the business sector, Symantec has provided robust security solutions that safeguard enterprises’ data and infrastructure, enabling secure digital transformation initiatives.

Currently, as a part of Broadcom Inc., Symantec continues to lead in the cybersecurity domain, evolving to address the complex challenges of today’s digital landscape. Its commitment to innovation and security excellence ensures that Symantec remains at the forefront of protecting digital information in an increasingly interconnected world.

What is Symantec?

It’s a leading cybersecurity company that offers solutions for digital protection to individuals, businesses, and governments globally, ensuring safety against cyber threats.

1982 – 1990

The first logo features the company’s name in a stylized font, with a unique treatment of the letter ‘A’ that resembles an inverted ‘V.’ The typeface is playful and somewhat futuristic, with curves that give it a friendly and approachable feel.

1990 – 1999

In this logo, the Symantec name is enclosed within a rectangular box, maintaining the same stylized treatment of the ‘A.’ The background for the text is black, which contrasts sharply with the white lettering. This design carries a more traditional corporate look, suggesting solidity and establishment. The boxed-in style represents security, alluding to the company’s focus on protecting digital information.

2001 – 2010

The logo marks a significant departure from the typographic focus of the previous two. It is a graphic element – a circle of two multi-colored parts. The element consists of yellow and gray gradients, which gives it a dynamic and three-dimensional look. The black text looks sleek and modern, and the lowercase text adds a modern touch. This design suggests movement and transformation, hinting at the company’s adaptability and forward-thinking in cybersecurity.

2010 – 2019

The Symantec logo is instantly recognizable all over the globe. Composed of an emblem and a wordmark, it hasn’t changed its style after the company’s name was changed.

The iconic yellow and black “checkmark” was taken by the brand in 2010 from the VeriSign acquisition. And later, in 2019, it stayed as an emblem for NortonLifeLock.

The Symantec emblem is a yellow circle with a black tick inside. The symbol of protection and quality, it looks bright and makes users confident in the product.

The Symantec wordmark, placed in the right of the emblem is executed in a bold sans-serif typeface, which looks simple yet professional in black color.

The Symantec logo is minimalist yet bright and meaningful. It evokes a sense of protection and reliability, showing a strong and confident company, with huge expertise and a perfect reputation.

2019 – 2022

When the company’s name was changed to NortonLifeLock, the wordmark was redesigned. Now it featured two typefaces: the traditional and bold sans-serif for “NortonLife” and a more square and thin for “Lock”.

2022 – now

The logo depicted is for Gen Digital, which represents a significant chapter in the evolution of a company with deep roots in the cybersecurity industry. Originally known as Symantec, the company was a powerhouse in the field of digital security, offering a wide array of products, including the well-known Norton antivirus software. In a strategic move to refine its brand identity and better reflect its broadened scope, Symantec was rebranded as NortonLifeLock. This change signified a commitment to providing comprehensive digital protection for consumers, going beyond traditional antivirus solutions to include identity theft protection and other security services.

The journey of transformation did not stop there. NortonLifeLock later merged with Avast Software, another titan in the cybersecurity space, known for its own antivirus and security services. This merger marked a union of two industry leaders with complementary strengths and visions for the future of digital security. As a result of this merger, the company underwent another rebranding, emerging as Gen Digital. The new identity, Gen Digital, reflects the synergy of NortonLifeLock’s and Avast’s combined technologies and expertise, aiming to lead the next generation of cyber safety.

The logo’s design is contemporary and minimalist, featuring the name “Gen” in bold, blue capital letters with a trademark symbol, set against an olive green background. The choice of the name “Gen,” a prefix associated with concepts like “generation” and “innovation,” signals a forward-looking approach, while the blue color denotes reliability and professionalism—qualities that are paramount in the cybersecurity industry. This logo encapsulates the company’s legacy and its forward momentum into a new era of digital protection.
