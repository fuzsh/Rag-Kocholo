With extensive tundra wetlands (mostly crowberry and sedges) and bogs, the area is important to migrating and breeding birds, particularly the bean goose (Anser fabalis). The rivers are important spawning grounds for golden trout.[52] Volga River Delta Astrakhan Oblast\n\n[ Borders (PP)] 8,000 L, Q\n\n(PDF) IBA[55] The delta of the Volga River as it enters the Caspian Sea from the northwest, is the largest inland river delta in Europe. The terrain is a network of riverine floodplains, and islands. The site features rich biodiversity in both fish and birds. A portion of the delta is protected by the Astrakhan Nature Reserve.[56] Wetlands in the Lower Bagansky District area Novosibirsk Oblast\n\nBorders (PP) 269 Q, R, P, N\n\n(PDF) IBA[57] Located in an herb and feather-grass steppe zone, the lower Bagan River features many small lakes with varying levels of salinity and permanence. Vegetation includes halophytic (salt-tolerant) species, reed-beds, and meadows. Water levels vary from year to year, and the importance of the site also varies for migrating and breeding birds as it is an alternative when the Chany Lakes site (50 km to the north) experiences a dry year.[58]"
