        "text": "Iceland is an incredible country with stunning landscapes and geological formations. Included in the top 20 largest islands globally, Iceland is located in the North Atlantic Ocean in the northern hemisphere. The country is known for its incredible beauty and unique land of fire and ice.\n\nThis list of top 100 locations in Iceland is carefully listed to ease your travels. We have divided the sections into categories spanning from North and East to South and West, and popular spots. This detailed listing contains everything a traveler wants to know. These choices are based on individual experiences and data compiled from different online sources.\n\nThe South Coast is a picturesque amalgamation of glacier lagoons, a national park, lava fields endlessly dried, awe-inspiring cliffsides, and unforgettable fishing villages. Numerous volcanic lava flows during the Ice Age make the coast geologically young. The Hekla and Eyjafjallajökull are two of the most active volcanos in the region.\n\nThe Quake 2008 exhibition at the Hveragerði displays the splitting of the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. South Iceland is easily accessible through Ring Road Route-1, and most of the attractions in the region lie within 2-hours of driving distance via jeep, car, or bus from Reykjavik.\n\nFed by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano’s glacier cap, the Seljalandsfoss waterfall goes directly into a pretty meadow. The attraction running beside the Southern Coast offers a mesmerizing view of the surroundings while walking behind it and is often a tour staple stop. The waterfall has been a part of Justin Bieber’s “I’ll Show You” music video.\n\nRenowned for the legend of a treasure chest and 60-meters drop, Skógafoss waterfall offers a rainbow view during summers. Five hundred twenty-seven steps lead to the observation platform and surround it with photogenic landscapes. Unfortunately, the base rocks become icy and dangerously approachable during winters.\n\nA small peninsula and a former volcanic island separated from the mainland, Dyrhólaey offers a spectacular view of birdlife from the cliff and a scene dominating the rock arch. You can view Puffins and Arctic Terns, except during the nesting months, May and June. The 120-meter promenade also has sights of glittering Atlantic waves, mountainscapes, and black sand beaches.\n\nA village, souvenir shopping hub, and lunch stop, Vík í Mýrdal houses no more than 300 people and lies on the southern side of Mýrdalsjökull glacier. Inexperienced with eruptions, Vik offers Katla volcano excursions for natural ice cave explorations. Situated 186 km from Reykjavík, Vík has the warmest temperatures by two degrees compared to other country regions.\n\nRenowned as Iceland’s Crown Jewel, Jökulsárlón offers scenic views of icebergs, seal colonies, ice caps, and Vatnajökull National Park mountains. The Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon is rapidly enlarging because of the large ice chunks and has expanded up to 18 square km since 1934-35. As a result, Jökulsárlón seems more like a lake formed with glacier outlet meltwater.\n\nLying amidst Öræfi or the Wasteland, Skaftafell nature reserve, a former national park, is home to Hvannadalshnúkur and Morsárfoss, the tallest peak and waterfall of the country. The fertile green birch land also coincides with the Vatnajökull glacier, making it a hiking hub. The rich and growing flora between the glaciers and sands is an amazing contrasting scenery for most visitors.\n\nTransformed over 9,000 years, the Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon has a 2 km and 100-meter deep river, narrow pathways, and steep walls. The ice age palagonite bedrock and Fjaðrá river arriving from Mt. Geirlandshraun have made a winding canyon shape. The dramatic canyon lies next to the historic Kirkjubæjarklaustur town.\n\nLocated 23 km east of the Seljalandsfoss waterfall, the Seljavallalaug outdoor pool dated 1923 and remained the most extensive country pool with a 25-meter length and 10-meter width until 1936. Algae grow underneath and on the sides of the pool and are reachable by driving east from the Ring Road while arriving through Reykjavík.\n\nThe Reykjadalur valley is home to many hot springs and is famous as “Stream Valley.” The hot springs are surrounded by lush green hillsides, waterfalls, and geothermal springs. The Reykjadalur hot springs lie beside the 2,500 people town Hveragerði. The hot spring lies 45 km from Reykjavík and is part of the Hengill area.\n\nA small waterfall beside Seljalandsfoss, Gljúfrabúi, is hidden inside the ancient sea cliff’s gorge. Photographers often appreciate the surrounding greenery and water drawing from the Gljúfrabúi, a.k.a. Canyon Dweller, from a height of 131 feet. The waterfall is situated at Hamragarðar, and its cliff faces the Atlantic Ocean and the South Coast.\n\nThe 98-feet Kvernufoss waterfall is partially hidden in the gorge and lies on the eastern end of the Skógafoss waterfall. A 20-minutes hike beginning from the Skógasafn museum to Kvernufoss by the river also offers a view of gorge and gravel. Then, the trek leads towards the Kvernugil gorge and the Kvernuhólsá river.\n\nA vast gravel and sand area amidst modern shoreline and interior cliffs, Sólheimasandur was constructed due to a glacier burst. The site offers scientific unpredictability and glacier flood vulnerabilities. Sólheimasandur offers haunting and ethereal beauty with black sand resembling a lunar landscape. One of the most prominent attractions of the place is the DC-3 plane wreckage sight.\n\nLying 1.5 km uphill from the Visitor Centre in Skaftafell, Svartifoss waterfall is accompanied mainly by viewing other gorge waterfalls. Invisible from the road, the magnificent waterfall takes 90-minutes to hike both ways and is an oasis. The 20-meter tall waterfall is an oasis and surrounded by columnar basalt structures.\n\nA historic farm, Foss á Síðu inhabited since the Settlement Era of Iceland is associated with a cursed man’s mysterious 16th Century legends. The place is 10 km from Kirkjubæklaustur village, former piety, and religious center. Foss á Síðu is also mentioned in the Book of Settlements.\n\nThe Öræfi regions Hofskirkja is one of the six Icelandic turf churches bearing the traditional style and was built by Páll Pálsson. The 16th or 17th-century Danish tin candle lights are visible inside St. Clement dedicated attraction. The chancel screen divides the church into two parts, namely choir, and nave.\n\nThe iceberg-filled Fjallsárlón glacier lagoon lies in the vicinity of the Vatnajökull glacier and Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. The glacier snout of Fjallsárlón offers a better view than Jökulsárlón, and diminished height gives a chance to go close to the ice cap. The Fjallsjökull glacier outlet of the Vatnajökull reaches the lagoon surface.\n\nOne of the most visited places in Iceland, the Katla ice cave offers colorful and shimmering ice formations with a sight of surrounded gravel & snow roads and rivers. The cave forms unique ice formations every year during winter. The snow walk towards the cave provides unforgettable views.\n\nRugged ridges, crevasses, and sinkholes form the Sólheimajökull glacier lying at the Mýrdalsjökull glacier’s tongue. A hiker paradise, the glacier is constantly changing and retreated almost a kilometer in the past decade. The rich sulphuric acid smelly Jökulsá river runs here, and Sólheimajökull may not exist after a few decades.\n\nThe Svínafellsjökull glacier stretches 8 km in length and 800 meters in width. The ice monster seems more awe-inspiring than the Vatnajökull and Öræfajökull glaciers. Walkers can experience sublime blue colors while glacier climbing for viewing the ice tongue. Svínafellsjökull is in the Skaftafell Nature Reserve, and the reserve was formerly a National Park.\n\nLocated near Kirkjubæjarklaustur on Ring Road 1, Stjórnarfoss is famous for its waterfall and surrounding rock formations. Stjórnarfoss’s sloping water sounds and captivating surrounding landscapes make it a perfect camping and picnic spot. You can find a campsite next to the waterfall called Kleifar. On warm summer days, you will find the locals jump in the waterfall for a swim. The water gets warmer in the evening when the sun has been shining all day.\n\nA basalt column formation, Dverghamrar, a.k.a. The Dwarf Cliffs, lies 10 km east of Kirkjubæjarklaustur village. The hexagonal basalt cliff columns also have horseshoe-shaped cube-jointed basalt at the top formed during the ice age and associated with folklore. The columnar basalt is a result of cooled lava flow and the building of contraction forces. When you stand at Dverghamrar you can see Foss á Síðu between the cliffs.\n\nA lesser-known Icelandic waterfall, Fossálar, is captured around geological foundations that seem like a landscape painting. The eye-capturing sight lies 16 km east of Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The waterfall is located a few meters from the Ring Road so you will see them as you drive along the road. You can adore the scenic view of a gentle and tumbling cascade through the gigantic cliffs. The graceful cascade and Fossálar river are easy to reach by walking from the nearby parking lot. However, the sight is not well marked and the parking lot is very small.\n\nVestmannaeyjar is a volcanic island located just south of Iceland. Incredible natural beauty is everywhere around in Vestmannaeyjar and if you are a history enthusiast, this place will surely be of interest. The population of the island is around 4300 people. See where the eruption in Eldfell volcano happened in 1973 and forced a month long evacuation of the entire population of Vestmannaeyjar. Explore the magnificent cliffs, restaurants and see the puffins in their natural environment.\n\nThe Golden Circle is Iceland’s finest example of magnificent landscapes, geological forces, and rich culture. The route is often a precursor to South Coast exploration and Ring Road detour. The vicinity to Iceland’s capital city and visiting the most famous attractions make the Golden Circle a favorite.\n\nGolden Falls, a.k.a Gullfoss, is a loved Hvítá river canyon attraction with a total height of 70 meters from the Gullfossgjúfur canyon. You can drench in mighty waterfall sprays through 140 and 109 cubic meters of surging water during summers and winters. The waterfall is one of the most popular attraction in Iceland and for a good reason. The photos of the waterfall are breath taking, but it is nothing like seeing it in real life. The feel is totally different. You can even add nearby activities like Langjökull glacier and ice cave visitation or snowmobiling on the Gullfoss tour itinerary.\n\nIn a geothermal area called Haukadalur valley, Geysir erupts water up to 70-meters and surrounds the area with fumaroles and yellow sulphuric stains. Geysir, also known as The Great Geysir, is one of the most famous hot springs in the world. Geysir lends its name to all the geysers that are present around the world. The famous Geysir is rarely active, but the site has many hot springs, including Strokkur who erupts 30 meters up in the air every 5-10 minutes.\n\nÞingvellir National Park is The Field of Parliaments also known as Alþingi, the globe’s first elected parliament through democracy, in 930 AD. In addition, the place is home to Silfra fissure where you can snorkel between the continents. Þingvellir National Park is a part of UNESCO World Heritage sites. The ground also has remains of 10th Century and 18th & 19th Century agricultural remains.\n\nThe 3000-year-old and 55-meter deep Kerið crater lies in the Tjarnarhólar area, a home for crater hills. Kerið has a bowl lake believed to rise and fall in the Mt. Búrfell, and is a natural protected site. The crater is in the vicinity of the Golden Circle attractions and appears vividly red.\n\nThe Hruni hot spring or Hrunalaug remains open throughout the year and has a temperature of 40°C. Dramatic artificial improvements surround the eight-person capacity hot spring, and a private land attraction lies in the vicinity of the Secret Lagoon. The best time to visit the hot spring is during the early morning as it allows you to stay away from the crowd.\n\nFaxi waterfall, sometimes called Vatnsleysufoss waterfall lies 12 km from Geysir and 20 km from Gullfoss waterfall. A part of the Golden Circle, the waterfall is a vast, impressive, and natural sight. You can experience the drizzle up close and even enjoy the peacefulness, unlike the Gullfoss waterfall.\n\nThe Thingvellir National Park’s snorkeling in Silfra is one of the most famous activities that take people through glacier-like crystal clear waters and offer an experience of incredible rock formations. Silfra fissure allows snorkeling between the slowly drifting Eurasian and North American continental tectonic plates and provides an unforgettable sub-aquatic life experience.\n\nThe water of the Þingvellir National Park’s artificial Öxarárfoss waterfall arrives through the Öxará river and runs towards the Þingvallakirkja church. The 44-feet high and 20-feet wide waterfall has a rock-filled base, and the water freezes during winter. The waterfall is surrounded by lava fields and the ravines of the national park. It is the ideal stop if you are visiting Thingvellir National Park.\n\nThe geothermal baths of Laugarvatn Fontana are in the midst of the Golden Circle route. The geothermal springs offer a healing experience, and you even admire the natural lake pool besides steam baths with temperatures between 40°C and 50°C. Geothermal energy changes the temperature of the green beaches, pools, and streams.\n\nCovering approximately 22,721 square kilometers, East Iceland houses almost 16,000 people and is a peaceful and beautiful area. The site has a dramatic coastline, small villages, narrow fjords, mountains, and waterfalls. Since East Iceland is located farthest away from Reykjavik, it is not visited by travelers as much as some of the other parts of Iceland. Because of this, you will not find as many travelers at the best tourist locations and everything is more quite and peaceful.\n\nThe most significant Icelandic rhyolite foundations of Borgarfjörður Eystri with inhabited area accessibility are visible in East Iceland. The region is also known for colored mineral deposited magma chambers visible and reachable from the east coast. In addition, creatives and millennials from around the globe make it a hub for arts and music festivals.\n\nA town with 668 people, Seyðisfjörður lies in the fjord’s inner corner surrounded by waterfalls and snow-capped mountains. Prone to avalanches, the small village is 17 km from Skalanes nature reserve and was a base for Allied Forces in World War II. The ferry that comes from Europe to Iceland stops at Seyðisfjörður so it is a first stop for many travelers. Seyðisfjörður is known to be the best place in Iceland for art and you can find young artist all over the town.\n\nStokksnes is home to the black sand beach at Stokksnes peninsula and Mt. Vestrahorn. The landmark is surrounded by black sea beaches, stunning lagoons, and cliffs. Lying on Mt. ​​Kastarárfjall’s south side, the place also houses the H3 Radar Station. The Stokksnes peninsula dates back to the 9th Century and is associated with the first Horn settlement. The view from the black sand beach and over to Vestrahorn Mountain is simply amazing. It is one of the most popular location in Iceland for photographers.\n\nA 2,000 people fishing town, Höfn is a natural harbor located in the southest part of East Iceland. The city has three-sided ocean surroundings, and Vatnajökull glacier, the largest glacier in Europe,vlies within the town’s vicinity. The town is one of the few Icelandic places with a domestic airport.\n\nA 130 people village, Borgarfjörður Eystri is famous for fish works, fishing, and sheep farming, especially during summer. The area is even a popular hiking hotspot, especially on the Stórurð and Dyrfjöll. Braedslan music festival, has been held annually in Borgarfjörður Eystri since 2005 June.\n\nEgilsstaðir is the largest East Icelandic town with 2,464 residents. The town lies on the Lagarfljót river banks within the Fljótsdalshérað district valley. The town is near Hallormsstaðaskógur forest and Lagarfjlót lake. Egilsstaðir is a famous reindeer region and unspoiled nature. It serves as a service center for East Iceland, being the largest town in the area.\n\nRunning through the Hengifossá river​​ in East Iceland, Hengifoss waterfall has a length of 128 feet. It is one of the highest and most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland. The waterfall trail is one of the most notable Icelandic hiking routes. Basaltic strata layers and red clay surround the waterfall. Geologists even discovered that the layers have fossilized trees that showcase evidence of warmer tertiary periods.\n\nFound on the Hengifoss trail, Litlanesfoss is a two-tier waterfall with a length of 30-35 meters. The waterfall is also known as Stuðlabergsfoss because it is surrounded by 20-meter high basalt columns and is hidden from the hiking trail. Litlanesfoss, a.k.a, Basalt Column Falls, are renowned for these marvels.\n\nFolaldafoss waterfall is a hidden waterfall in East Iceland. The waterfall has a 20-meter drop and is visible from the main road over Öxi. A quick walk towards the attraction from the parking lot takes you into a serene environment of Icelandic scenery with high cliffs and Route 939 landscapes. The waterfalls divert the water of the southern flowing stream almost northwards and land in an attractive pool.\n\nA hidden black sand beach, Fauskasandur is a perfect stop for self-drivers. The black sand beach in East Iceland is renowned for green top standing monolith with a demeanor colored in black and a massive rock amid the ocean. The dark black sand, stone, side basalt rocks, and sea create a glimmering contrast.\n\nStuðlagil Canyon has become one of the most popular location in Iceland in the recent years. And for a good reason. This magical place is on top of every photographers list. The basalt columns light up in the sun and the water streaming below is simply beautiful.\n\nWhale watching is best experienced in north Iceland, and the tours take on picturesque journeys of the North Atlantic cetaceans. However, one of the most commonly missed places is the Árskógssandur’s beer spa located in a community on the Eyjafjörður Fiord shores.\n\nSituated near the Skjálfandafljót river, the Goðafoss waterfall has a 12 meet drop and 30-meter width. Formerly referred to as “God’s waterfall,” Goðafoss has become a part of the Diamond Circle close to the Mývatn lake, Ásbyrgi canyon, and other landmarks.\n\nSituated on the northern side of Mývatn lake, Krafla caldera is an explosive volcano with 29 eruptions since settlement. The caldera is known for 90 km fissure zone extensions and has a peak height of 818 meters, and lies in the vicinity of Ásbyrgi horseshoe structured canyon.\n\nLocated near Mývatn lake is a small lava cave named Grjótagjá, famous for its geothermal hot springs within its depth. The 18th-century landmark is no longer a bathing hotspot but televised in the Game of Thrones TV series.
