        "text": "Doel:\n\nLet me just say, again, this is Ron Doel and this is Session 2 with Henry Kohler. We are continuing this recording on the twenty-eighth of May, 1996, in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia. One of the things that I’m very curious to hear about is how you first came to know about the possibility of sailing with the Vema. When did that first take place?\n\nKohler:\n\nIn 1957. I believe it was in June. My good friend who was the managing director of his own firm here — my good friend Jim [James] Kinley called me. Both natives in Lunenberg and I think mutual admirers. I was on shore at that time with — rather the end — the demise of the Canadian merchant marine. And I —\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m sorry. What was happening with the Canadian merchant marine at that time?\n\nKohler:\n\nThe Canadian merchant marine was then being, to use the term, downsized and flagged out. All the companies were taking their ships to England at that time. They were putting them under British flag for a cheaper operation. I had my offer to go in command of a British ship — Canadian owned — and didn’t want to do that. I came home and promoted a large fishing vessel and I sailed it. I’d never been a fisherman, but I sailed it successfully for four or five months.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas this the scalloping operation?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. I passed it over to a young man whom I knew would do well with it. I was then awaiting a commitment of an appointment to British American Oil on a foreign-going tanker as a captain. That seemed slow coming along and my friend Jim Kinley called. He asked if I would be interested in the Vema. I knew something of the Vema, just from knowing she’d been in Lunenberg. I saw her here on one occasion. I knew her former owner. So he said would you be interested in going with Columbia University as master of the Vema? I said, “Well I certainly would be interested, but I have to ta& to the people.” He had been called by Mr. [Sigourney] Romaine who was marine manager at that time. I don’t know what his real title was, but that’s really what he was doing. He was a very fine man. Romaine I think. And, so he was — Jim was the liaison I guess. I went down to New York, and they picked me up I went over to the institute and I had a meeting with Joe [J. Lamar Worzel] and Doc [W. Maurice Ewing] and Chuck [Charles L.] Drake and John [John I. Ewing] and a few others — they sized me up. They gave me a pretty good grilling.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat were your impressions of them?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, my impressions were — I wasn’t afraid of it. I hadn’t quite dealt with people in this field. My impressions were it was like I was on trial.\n\nDoel:\n\nMore than you’d ever been in any previous interview?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Yes. And then they wanted to know how long I’d been at sea. Well, I said I’ve been at sea now more than twenty years. Joe says, “There’s a lot around here who trod the deck for twenty years.” I said, “That’s nice,” which you can well believe. They seemed to be quite satisfied with the answers which I gave. They asked if I knew anything about sailing, and I told them my experience with sailing ships. That seemed to please them very much. They were taken by that. Then eventually they asked me to stay another day. They took me into New York City for a physical because of my disability which was obvious and which I had told them. That seemed — the result of that was fine. So I came home — I —think we settled it all there. When it came to salary and believe it or not, then the Canadian dollar was worth more than the American dollar by six cents. So I insisted that I get paid in the Canadian funds. That was all right. They didn’t overpay me, but it was a decent living.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt compared favorably to the past salary and wages?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. I said I expect what I would get as master of a Canadian foreign-going steamship. That’s exactly what I got at that time. It was six hundred dollars a month. And that was good pay. So, we made the agreement that as soon as the vessel got there, I would come down and join her. She was on her way home from, maybe from Argentina. I don’t remember. I did just that. She came up to Piermont, and then I went over. I believe it was Captain [Valvin] Sinclair who picked me up and took me to the — maybe Mr. Romaine. Sinclair wasn’t there yet. He took me to the ship but I wasn’t impressed with what I saw. I thought she was in a hell of a state.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. I’m curious, particularly about what you were thinking about when you saw?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I sized it up, and I thought this ship is in one hell of a state. She wasn’t well maintained at all. She was in a very advanced condition of I’d say deterioration in many respects. I was quite capable of making, I made my own survey. But I thought well —\n\nDoel:\n\nYou mean the condition of the hull as well as the interior and the —\n\nKohler:\n\nEverything. That may not be complimentary to some of the people at that time, but that’s the way I found it. We did our best to make her seaworthy and reasonable for one trip. I had only planned to go for six months or more. But, in retrospect, maybe I didn’t do enough. The decks were very, very bad. She had wooden decks. They were beautiful decks in their time. But the fastening of the deck to the frames was very bad with bronze. Most were in a condition where they just weren’t holding that deck down as it should be. It leaked badly — very badly. I used to feel sorry, particularly, where the scientists were living because as soon as we had water on deck — they had wet bunks. They used shower curtains strung up over their bunks. It wasn’t good. After our first long voyage, we started trying — and I must say that I got support. I didn’t get everything I wanted, but you can’t expect that either. But I did get support. They were kind of tight-fisted in this respect. They wanted their money to go into research. But the vehicle they needed also needed maintenance. I can’t say that they treated me badly in that respect. But we started trying to bring the vessel up. Even during the voyage we did a lot of work, in this port and that port — In Cape Town and places like that. Every trip we improved her — then came the very major things. They did get big money for it. There was a program that was going on for about seven or eight years — possibly ten — whereby we strengthened the hull in different areas. We doubled the keel. We put doubled plates all around the water line for a width of eight feet which was tremendous stiffening. The vessel had complete new decks installed — steel decks which was very good. Eventually in the plan the masts were removed and we did away with the sails because they weren’t really compatible. It was romantic but not compatible with the way they worked. We eventually had a brand new main propulsion plant installed. It was very, very satisfactory. Total electrical systems in every respect. A generated system and electrical system. We had new deck houses. We went through the ship over those — I guess might have been eight years. There was tremendous money spent on until she was a real sound vessel when we finished.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. I didn’t want to interrupt you on that. But that was very interesting in that you say this was part of a master plan. That you knew early on the entirety of what you wanted to do with the Vema. This is through the 1960s that this happened?\n\nKohler:\n\nInto the seventies.\n\nDoel:\n\nInto the seventies.\n\nKohler:\n\nThey had a Norwegian marine engineer as their marine engineering supervisor. He was a very fine man by the name of Hank [Haakon] Skjerding. And he was — they thought very highly of him as I did too. I always found reasons to get — had some pretty hot controversies all around, and that doesn’t mean I was right. I lost a few rounds too. But they were good people. They had some good people around them. He was a remarkably good man, and then Captain Sinclair came into the picture. He was a retired U.S. four ring captain, a senior captain. He was very knowledgeable and very practical. What made it so nice with Captain Sinclair — and this reflects on a very sad incident recently took place. Captain Sinclair joined the U.S. Navy as an enlisted man at eighteen years old. Eventually, he went into Annapolis. He went to senior captain to retire as a rear admiral which he refused. He said, “I earned my four ring captain as commanding officer during the war and that’s the way I’m going to retire. So it reflects back on what happened with the CNO recently who — it was a very sad event.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou’re referring to the suicide recently —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Terrible. He had been an enlisted man who advanced to that station. However, Captain Sinclair was a great supporter of me. From his lifetime of training and naval experience his viewpoint was in a very short, few words. He made it very well known at meetings we’d have at end of voyages with the scientists and so on telling him this and that. And then he’d say, “You must all remember the ship, the captain and the crew are the front line. We are the reserve lines. And if we don’t support them and give them what they need to do the job, it will not be done.” He was a wonderful man. I’m sure you’ve heard of him.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’ve heard of him.\n\nKohler:\n\nTough little fellow too. He meant business when he talked. He was only short, but boy he was powerful. In stature, he was small. But I’ll tell you in personality, he was big.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid you say he was already there at the time that you arrived? Or did his appointment come later?\n\nKohler:\n\nHe may have been there but not in the capacity of — I’ll say marine superintendent. He may have been there working with the geologists. When he retired from the Navy, he went to University of Missouri and took a degree in geology. That’s how he ended up there. I think he may have been there at Lamont, at that time and I didn’t know him or heard about him. Then when Mr. Romaine eventually — I don’t know if he left or — actually, I think Romaine first went there gratis and worked as a manager. I think he would have come from some wealthy family in New York. He was really a Wall Street bond salesman. He was a fine man. Didn’t quite fit in that — there wasn’t a niche there for him to fit into. I mean that — at Lamont we were hard driving — rough attitude in many cases. He was a public Wall Street man. He was respected and he could handle numbers.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid he work with Arnold Finck then?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, of course. He would have.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nSo, eventually when he was — no he died quite young. When he was no longer there, Captain Sinclair moved into that position. I’m pretty sure I’m right. Captain Sinclair was there for many years until he retired. I sure had his support. You know it’s interesting — do you want me to continue that line or leading question?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. Yes, please.\n\nKohler:\n\nThen in later years, they had a few people in managerial positions in that marine end of the operation. They weren’t good people. They were not good people.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat didn’t they have — the later people — that people like Sinclair or Romaine had?\n\nKohler:\n\nI think they had people who — number one didn’t have the ability to do a good job. Secondly, I don’t think they were sincere people at all. Thirdly, I know they were not honest people. I know they were milking the outfit. I blew the whistle on them every chance I got. But they were always after me. I could weather that storm real easy. You know when they finally fired the one — we’ll say port captain or marine manager — do you know what he said to Manik Talwani? I’m surprised it took you so long to catch me.\n\nDoel:\n\nIs that right?\n\nKohler:\n\nOnly because they were generous. They knew long before that they should have got rid of him. Then they had an engineer to replace Hank Skjerding, who died in service — died of cancer. He was a very good friend of both Laney and I. They brought in a retired lieutenant commander from the Navy. He was a real bad egg. He knew I was a threat to his position. He made it very clear he was coming out to Guam to fire me.\n\nDoel:\n\nTo fire you?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. He didn’t have the authority — and number two, when he got back to New York he was finished.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas this again under the Talwani — when Manik Talwani was —\n\nKohler:\n\nIt was during Talwani’s tenure. The Navy and the other was a merchant marine captain. Smart and intelligent — but no integrity — no real strength of character either. They were milking the system. They were bleeding it in every respect. There were some things that went on that I’m sure people at Lamont now either never knew or can’t remember. One incident involved the tail shaft of the Robert D. Conrad.\n\nDoel:\n\nThe other ship — the main ship.\n\nKohler:\n\nWe believed — and I was involved in some shore operations too. We believed that was in storage and repaired in storage and approved in New York. We could never find it when we needed it. The ship was found. She was in dry-dock in New York. The report back to the people at Lamont — like Joe and those people — was, “Well she had a new tail shaft installed.” This was twenty years ago, maybe more. You know, that’s a twenty-five thousand dollar job in those days. But when she came back after a long trip, and that tail ship was withdrawn for inspection, it was the old one just patched. It was not really repaired and approved for the American Bureau. It was just patched to cover up — slid back in. It could have easily failed. It wasn’t the new one at all. So, we knew we had to find the one in storage. We couldn’t locate it. Eventually that tail shaft was found in South Africa. It had been sold out — not by the university and not by Lamont. That sort of intrigue was going on. It didn’t do a couple of people very much good.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m sure it didn’t. How did that affect your position at Lamont when that sort of thing started to happen?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I think, I think if it needed to be strengthened, it only strengthened the fact that I was never really involved in that sort of thing. I felt that these people were treating me good. I was always brought up to represent the owners of a ship properly, and I tried to do that. So I’ll leave that. You can give me any leading questions.\n\nDoel:\n\nWell, I’m very curious about what you mentioned a moment ago — that the one person had come out to Guam. I gather the Vema was sailing there.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe thought — he thought he could. He had no authority whatsoever.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes, but how did this whole incident develop? What was the reason for —\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I had never met this man, but he had heard of me.\n\nDoel:\n\nHe was at Lamont?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, working as an engineering superintendent after Hank Skjerding died. I guess he realized I may be a threat to his position. Oh man, this guy really, really ripped him. He was — everything he did — he didn’t do anything unless he got a big payoff from a contractor. You know the sort of thing that you read about.\n\nDoel:\n\nSure.\n\nKohler:\n\nSo, to me he was an unpalatable character in every respect. But he tried to use me a little rough in Guam. I guess that might have backfired.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut on what grounds did he even feel that he could try to intimidate you?\n\nKohler:\n\nGrounds?\n\nDoel:\n\nOr accusations or anything that he — I'm just curious what he was trying to say.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe said that I was not conforming to the things that he wanted done. Operators — he wanted me to operate. I knew who I was operating for.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd this was under the Talwani period?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, definitely.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas there a real change? Was this sort of problem already developing at the end of the Maurice Ewing’s term?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, when Manik was there, I certainly had full support from him. Now who would be choosing those people? When Manik was there, certainly Denny [Dennis E. Hayes] was associate director. But who was choosing those people? I don’t know. But in some cases they chose unwisely. In the case of one shore captain — he had been captain of the Robert D. Conrad I think, and they promoted him from there. You know any time you go hiring people over any period of time; you’re never going to have a hundred percent successes. I can speak of ship’s companies. When you hire an entire ship’s company, it could be fifty, it could be a hundred, it could be thirty. You’re real lucky if you get — if you make fifty percent real good choices. You’re always going to have a percentage of bad choices. And it takes time for the men to prove or disprove themselves. That’s the way I see it. I think in that case they had a succession of people who presented themselves and credentials that looked good. That’s very common. But they didn’t prove themselves very well.\n\nDoel:\n\nDo you think it really wasn’t so much the change of administration, as just, this sort of thing, as you say, happens?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. I think Manik Talwani went along on the same lines in my operation. I don’t know the science operation. In the same lines that Doc and Joe did. I really do. I can see no great change.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd this just was an unfortunate set of hiring’s that happened that just coincided —\n\nKohler:\n\nI think in recent years they’ve had great success with people in those positions. There’s an American captain there now. I talk to him on the phone. I understand that he’s very satisfactory. You may have met the man. You may know his name. I can’t remember his name.\n\nDoel:\n\nI don’t. But again, names we can add to the transcript once that’s prepared.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou know, all that is very interesting. Did it discourage you when those things happened?\n\nKohler:\n\nNot really. I guess maybe I had the right properties to be a fighter on the job. I knew I was going in the right direction. I’d take my own path and pursue what I believed was the right direction.\n\nDoel:\n\nI want to get back earlier in a moment — but thinking about this time. When Doc Ewing left and when Joe Worzel left — at that point did you deal directly with Manik Talwani on issues of this sort?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Oh yes.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo that it was directly you and he.\n\nKohler:\n\nJust the same. And I could get to them any time. Him, or Doc or Joe, I could get to them any time. Right there, on the estate or from any part of the world. I could call and get to them any time. They’d always have time for me. Manik operated in the same manner. I wanted to make another point in response to your question. I forget the question now. Did I see change was part of it?\n\nDoel:\n\nI was thinking particularly of whether you had noticed a major change at all between Ewing’s time and Manik Talwani’s time?\n\nKohler:\n\nI, no, I didn’t see it. Not in my operation. It was just — it was interesting, and in my opinion, the same pattern. In that case I dealt a lot with Denny Hayes. You see, oh — I know the point I was going to make. Doc and Joe were not in Texas very long before they offered me a job. They offered me a job as captain of a ship. They offered me a job on shore. And I — because there was no change at Lamont, because I knew all the people, because I got full support, I didn’t see that I should leave. I was tempted, very tempted. Because I knew them well too. I didn’t do it and I’m glad I didn’t do it. Because it wouldn’t have been as long term as everybody thought it might be for a multitude of reasons. Of course, Doc died. I think that was —\n\nDoel:\n\nThat occurred very quickly.\n\nKohler:\n\nWhat year was that?\n\nDoel:\n\n1974, wasn’t it?\n\nKohler:\n\nWas it? I was in Rio de Janeiro at the time. I can tell you it hit me and hurt me real hard. Doc Ewing treated me. He couldn’t have treated his son better. We were honest with each other. I can remember sailing one time out of New York. At Piermont you had to catch the right tide to get out of the berth and into the Hudson River. You had to have the peak of the tide. And, scientists, as always — they were late. Doc was down, in the back of a truck. He was unloading gear and getting aboard just like a stevedore. Suddenly he was on deck. We passed the peak of the tide. I went to him, and I said, “Doc, I’m sailing. If you don’t get the hell ashore, you’ll have to sail with me.” Away he went, happy as could be. He was only doing stevedore work, you know, which my sailors would have done. He was always respected. So, I didn’t see a good reason to move. But they made several offers. Money-wise it was interesting.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt was a better offer than what you were getting?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Oh yes.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas this already at the time that they —\n\nKohler:\n\nI never was really — Excuse me —\n\nDoel:\n\nNo, please go ahead.\n\nKohler:\n\nI was never really clear why Doc Ewing left. I think he must have fallen out with Columbia University executive or administration or whatever you care to call it. Did you ever hear?\n\nDoel:\n\nI heard a number of stories. I was curious, did he ever talk to you about difficulties that he was having with Columbia?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. With presidents of Columbia.\n\nDoel:\n\nMcGill was the president. William [J.] McGill at the time that he left.\n\nKohler:\n\nI believe so. Well, I can see that Doc’s operation — he would find it hard to accept that somebody was saying — would convey to him, “Well you can’t operate like that — that’s not within the policy of Columbia University.” I can understand and put that together. That may have been the grounds of the whole thing. But one way or another, he formed it; Columbia got great prestige because of us — in that field. I guess he feeling was that, “If you don’t let me run it the way I want to run it; I’ll get the hell out.”\n\nDoel:\n\nOf course his retirement — the mandatory retirement — was coming up.\n\nKohler:\n\nWas it? Yes, that’s right. I forgot that point. I forgot that point. Yes. That probably was part of it. But I know there was friction and stress.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. There certainly was. Do you recall any particular conversations with him on those —?\n\nKohler:\n\nMany of course.\n\nDoel:\n\nParticularly say on that —\n\nKohler:\n\nOn that particular subject?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. For the moment.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe might have mentioned to me — we used to have good discussions, sometimes the two of us. Not related to the ship operation, but just friendly discussions and —\n\nDoel:\n\nWhere would you meet when you did that? Was it at Lamont or would it be on the ship?\n\nKohler:\n\nSometimes on board the ship. Sometimes at his home at Lamont. Yes, he certainly mentioned it. I think he was a dictator. But that’s my term. He certainly mentioned that he couldn’t accept somebody in the administration telling him how he should be operating or what he should be doing with the money. Because they did a lot of funny things with money. They were honest. But I think some of these big wheel accountants at a university would say, “Oh, but you have a contract to do this and you’re doing something else with it.” They were doing that all the time, as you know. They were good at it. Nobody contested it much because I think they were very honest and they got damn good results. They could come up with papers on a subject that they weren’t contracted for. I remember John Ewing telling me — they went as a group to Moscow, to some great international convention for scientists. John said, “You know, Lamont put on just a disgusting display of power and carried away the whole thing.” They had taken a large group, [Wallace S.] Broecker, and Joe [J. Lamar Worzel], and John [Ewing] and Doc and all these old senior men — maybe [Gordon] Hamilton and the other one, [Jack E.] Oliver. Even though they weren’t at the Lamont then. But this is how John described it.\n\nDoel:\n\nDescribed it, yes.\n\nKohler:\n\nI think he was right too.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat did he mean by disgusting? Was he concerned at all about the way Lamont presented?\n\nKohler:\n\nI don’t know. They just overpowered it.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt was just that strong —\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. They were so strong. But they enjoyed it too.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m sure they did.\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. I used to meet a lot of very senior men from other institutions like from Scripps and from Woods Hole and so on. Sometimes they’d be very critical of Lamont people, but they held them in awe. No question about it.\n\nDoel:\n\nDo you remember any of those conversations particularly? Who it was that you met from Scripps and Woods Hole?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, not to the point of exact memory, but I do know that at different times, when maybe Doc or some of his people were having trouble with say at the Navy or National Science Foundation where they were getting — these old senior guys who were criticizing one another, they’d all come together and support one another.\n\nDoel:\n\nIndeed. Yes.\n\nKohler:\n\nI’m trying to think of some of the names — Revelle.\n\nDoel:\n\nRoger Revelle, clearly was there. Columbus Iselin was up in —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Iselin. They were great competitors. But boy when the chips were down, they’d support each other. They’d be mutual admirers, every time. As tough as Doc could be, he’d sit down and he’d talk glowingly about these men. I —\n\nDoel:\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKohler:\n\nNo, go ahead. That’s all.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. I was curious if you got to know any of them well enough to have impressions of them? Roger Revelle for instance?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. No. I’m trying to think of a few senior people that I did know. I can’t think of their names, particularly Woods Hole people. Can’t think of —\n\nDoel:\n\nAllyn Vine was up there.\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Yes. He was a great competitor I believe of Bruce [C.] Heezen. I’m not sure that’s the right term. But they could work together and they could also work against each other. When it was going for piece of money — one piece of money — they could really be competitors. That reminds me of Bruce — highly respected, an unusual man, a nice man. But, boy he could be mean at times. He worked like a slave — he and Marie.\n\nDoel:\n\nMarie Tharp [Flanagan], yes.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. It was interesting to go to Marie’s house.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’d love to hear about what that was like.\n\nKohler:\n\nI’ll tell you one little story. Oh, I told you yesterday—\n\nDoel:\n\nBut again, that was not on tape.\n\nKohler:\n\nThey were all drunk and eating Mongolian Hot Pot. I guess they ate it and liked it. One said, “By God Marie, this is good.”\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. Now again, unfortunately that came up at our discussion last night and isn’t on tape. I wonder if you could say a few more words about — that you had gone over as part of a party at Marie’s.\n\nKohler:\n\nI wasn’t part of that party. My young third officer was there who worked very closely with Marie and Bruce. When he was ashore or on leave, they’d get him over there. He was a good worker and a bright young man. Then every week or so they’d have a party somewhere. So, this time Marie had the party in a big house down by the river. I think it was a three-story house — maybe twelve rooms. It was a mess. It was a mess. But anyway, this time, Mike O’Connor — this young third officer — he was there. Everybody was drinking and having a good time. Marie was in the kitchen making the Mongolian Hot Pot. She was putting this in and putting that in. She grabbed a box and gave it a big shake and Mike O’Connor said, my God Marie that’s Duz — the soap powder. She said, “Oh, oh, put it back.” She said, “Don’t tell.” So after a while, they’re sitting down, eating it. Guys like Marc [Marcus] Langseth and them — some hungry students then. They said, “My God Marie, this is good.” But her house — every room — the walls were covered with maps. The floors were covered with charts and maps. And little pathways — every room. Right into her bedroom. Everywhere there were maps and charts. Is she still alive?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes, she is.\n\nKohler:\n\nAnd working?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nShe’s no young woman. She could hold her own when it came to taking a drink with us — that gang. Like you said yesterday — they played hard.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. When was this roughly that you remember going over to Marie’s? Was it in the 1960s?\n\nKohler:\n\nI was in her place several times. But that would be in the sixties and seventies.\n\nDoel:\n\nWell, of course, if Marc is still a graduate student at the time, that’s still the early 1960s.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat helps to place it. That’s very interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe was a smart fellow too.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou raised an interesting point too, I thought, a little while ago about the funding. A number of people have commented that there seemed to be more slack in the funds that came in. That indeed scientist would borrow from one fund and use it for another. And that this also affected the machine shop after a time — which the general funds couldn’t be used. It needed to be — if one wanted to develop an instrument, it needed to be in the budget.\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, one thing that always annoyed me — we knew — particularly after Robert Conrad came into the scene; we were operating at half her cost and producing more. But, it might be Wally Broecker or it might be people from the core lab. I forget whose operation that was.\n\nDoel:\n\nDave [David B.] Ericson was there for a time.\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly. Those people. They would — I’ll give you an example. Maybe we’d be shipping home about — could be five tons of cores. I’d have them all. I looked after those things well. They didn’t have to bother with them. I’d see that they were all accounted for, crated, shipped properly and everything. Then, when the damn things would get to New York, the accounts would be billed against the ship. That really upset me.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m sure it did.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. I never knew the end results. I used to write long letters about this to whoever might be director or associate director, and let them know that this account must be charged against — we’ll say the core lab account. I don’t know how to describe that properly, but that’s the idea.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. No, that’s good.\n\nKohler:\n\nThey do that in driving up the ship’s operating expenses. That was very common.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas it common from the beginning or was this —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. If they could get away with it. I think they did get away with it, a lot before I got there. That was — leaving them with their contract money to do more of their own work. While the ship’s operating money and costs —\n\nDoel:\n\nSure. That’s perfectly clear.\n\nKohler:\n\nThat used to really upset me.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m sure.\n\nKohler:\n\nEven in foreign parts they’d get this piece of gear built or that piece of gear. Then the ship paid for it through the agents — initially. It was a hell of a job to get money out of them back at the lab to cover it.\n\nDoel:\n\nWith something like that, how would you get — who would you contact to get the matter straightened out?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I would always go back to Joe when he was there.\n\nDoel:\n\nAs the associate director.\n\nKohler:\n\nAnd Denny. I told Doc too. I used to send him copies of everything I did. Everything. So and the same with the machine shop. Angelo [Ludas] suffered that way too. They would get him to build expensive equipment and then leave it with his machine shop accounts.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid he fight as hard as you to get the charges cleared?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. He didn’t always win either. Because maybe the guy had all his contract money used up.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis would happen.\n\nKohler:\n\nThen they’d bleed it off from one department to another, too — core lab, chemistry, machine shop. Oh yes, always fighting among themselves about it. I was thinking — we talked about Wally Broecker last night. I was thinking about the incident when I had a very unpleasant experience — I guess for both of us. It was due to this son of his. He thought the sun shined out of his rear end. I knew the boy had done a lot in the area where they were living that wasn’t what it should be. I knew some of the places he was frequenting on the voyage out to Singapore I think. When he got trouble, Wally didn’t want to believe that this boy would do anything that was things that were not quite right. But, I think eventually Wally realized — and then I got the boy and I’d take him in hand. He had various diseases that were not really nice to be among other people. I insisted that he change his laundry daily, wash his own laundry, segregated his cutlery — his dishes were segregated. Wally didn’t like that but it worked. We got him cleaned up. I didn’t take him into port either.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut this is the sort of thing that you as a captain had to deal with.\n\nKohler:\n\nRight. People like Wally didn’t quite understand that initially. But I’m sure he did later. I’m not speaking unkindly or unpleasantly. I’m just being honest.\n\nDoel:\n\nSure. I understand. You know, in thinking back to the very earlier periods and indeed to the time when you first came on to Lamont. What did you hear about the earlier voyages — the first series of voyages that had gone on with Vema?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, they accomplished it a lot as I understand. But it was a rough operation. [Captain] Kennedy was not the type of person to — they bought the ship from him. They had one charter I think.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat sounds right. We need to change —\n\nKohler:\n\nThey had one charter a few months.\n\nDoel:\n\nLet me just change the tape.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat sort of person was Kennedy?\n\nKohler:\n\nHe should have been born in Henry Morgan’s [Caribbean pirate] time. He was a very competent, hands-on — Marlinspike type, seaman and ship captain. If he were slicing up a cake, you got a pretty small slice. He also couldn’t accept the way that people were operating. He loved to get the money from Columbia. However, he only lasted one short voyage, I think, after they acquired the vessel. Kennedy was sort of a storied, flamboyant, swashbuckler type of a ship captain. As I said, he really should have been born in Morgan’s time. If any different from that, he might have operated nicely in the nineteenth century. He was as crooked as could be. Man oh man, what a crook. Anyway, he was so flamboyant that he — I was a good friend of him, you know.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou had known him here?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. He came here in 1930 as a boy. He bought a ship and was unqualified. He had no certificates. I’m not saying he was stupid, but he always sailed outside of where it would be required. I don’t know if you need to know any more about him. He came here on one occasion, through his series of small ships — the sailing ships that he owned. He actually stole one out of the U.S. — the Sea Fox. For years he couldn’t go back to the U.S. He and two men from Lunenberg — she was a big vessel. They sailed her to Barbados. That’s how he acquired the Sea Fox. He became so unpopular in Barbados for being crooked and using the local sailors and people so badly that he couldn’t go back to Barbados either. He married a Barbadian girl. She lives out in LeHave River now where they had their home. I don’t think she has — I think she’s probably not too sound up here now.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. You’re pointing to your head when you’re saying that.\n\nKohler:\n\nPardon?\n\nDoel:\n\nYou’re pointing to your head as you say that.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. So, I don’t know what more to tell you about him. He had a series of old sailing vessels from 1930 right through to the 1950s? Yes, Vema would’ve been was the last of them. Then he moved to the Bahamas and had small yachts down there. He was capable of anything to make a dollar. But he blew it as fast as he made it.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. Yes. Did you —\n\nKohler:\n\nFlamboyant living.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid you talk to him during the time that he owned the Vema and made the first charter to Columbia?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. I wasn’t home. No. I wasn’t home during those years at all.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo you really hadn’t heard about what was going on with Columbia. Or had you before?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, mostly from scientists.\n\nDoel:\n\nOh, you had known before you were contacted by —\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes, I knew a lot of their operations — from scientists and from the engineer that Kennedy took there with him.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd who was that?\n\nKohler:\n\nJohn Coffill.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe was with me for twenty years.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat sort of person was John Coffill?\n\nKohler:\n\nJohn was an extremely intelligent man. He was very competent, but he didn’t have the guts to go up to the black end of the stick. He was honest with me. He served me remarkably well. But he always had to have somebody as his backup. He had no — what shall I say — courage of his convictions. Intelligent as could be. In crisis, I’d have to say, “John, tell me what needs to be done? I’ll support you. Get busy and do it.” He couldn’t change a light bulb unless he took a third engineer with him to hold the cloth for him. That type of person. I enjoyed him and I appreciated him. Anything I said is not derogatory.\n\nDoel:\n\nUnderstood.\n\nKohler:\n\nYou want me to be honest. There were very many humorous incidents with John. You will hear that particularly from people like Denny and so on. They won’t say anything bad about John. Finally he became ill — I think I sent him home from Japan. I’m not sure of that. His second engineer had been with Kennedy on other ships and he was there with me in Vema for twenty-two years. He was a wonderful man — a single man, he was very, very competent. He came home. He was a hunter and a fisher, woods owl type. He fell down in the woods. Up at his own camp, on the shore with his little boat, and his creel full of fish. He had a heart attack and died. He was a wealthy man, wealthy. He never spent anything — he was single. He inherited very valuable property on the LaHave River. He was happy. He got what he wanted from life.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nHis name was Clarence Pentz. We had a lot of good engineers on that ship.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd they were all largely Nova Scotian or all Nova Scotian?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes.\n\nDoel:\n\nClarence was and John Coffill?\n\nKohler:\n\nI had engineers for eight years, nine years, twenty years, twenty-two years. Occasionally I had some foreign ones that didn’t work out well at all in junior positions. I just got rid of them quickly. Manning the vessel was not easy — which I took on.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis is a very important topic. Why was there a succession of captains for the Vema prior to 1957 when you were called?\n\nKohler:\n\nOkay. Let me tell you. I think I can answer that. Well Kennedy you know something about. Do you need to know any more?\n\nDoel:\n\nIt sounds as if there’s something you’re thinking about that might be helpful.\n\nKohler:\n\nNot necessarily except what a dishonest and colorful character he was.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid the folks at Lamont, like Doc Ewing and Joe Worzel, appreciate Kennedy’s character when they first started to deal with him?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. No. These men had integrity and Kennedy didn’t. I think that describes it. They were willing to use him if he’d have served properly. Then —\n\nDoel:\n\nBut it became apparent, in other words, fairly quickly once he —\n\nKohler:\n\nThen came a man that I’ve never met, but people spoke favorably about him. A young man by the name of Don Gould. He was only there for Vema IV, which was from July ‘54 to December ‘54. People spoke very favorably about him. He was competent, he was young, and I never heard criticism of him. But I think what he did — he lost his job and he went maybe to Kings Point [Merchant Marine Academy]. I’m not sure.\n\nDoel:\n\nHe went to attend the Academy.\n\nKohler:\n\nTo further his qualifications and career, no doubt. Then came a man by the name of Kleinschmidt, on Vema 6. I’ve met Kleinschmidt. The problem with Kleinschmidt was that he was an alcoholic. I think he again was a competent person, but he was alcoholic. There were times when they didn’t even see him. He was in his room for a week — drunk. I met him in Honolulu where he restored The Falls of Clyde. I don’t think he was off the booze then either. I certainly didn’t see evidence of it other than I used to visit there a couple of times and in the morning he was pretty sick. He always had his bottle of aspirins and coffee. And I thought, “Well, you’re doing a good job here, but you’re still not off the booze.” Then came a man by the name of Brack on Vema 7. And then came Brack and he was an elderly man I understand. Totally unsuitable and incapable of doing the job and he was only there for three or four months. Totally unsuitable and incompetent. Then came a man by the name of [Captain] Fred [S.] Usher from Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, just across — ten miles from here.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nFred Usher and I served in — he was an Englishman and a good man. He served in the same company that I was in for years — the Federal Navigation out of Montreal in the foreign trade. I think that he also was available because — I don’t know who would have recommended Fred Usher — maybe John Coffill. I never really thought about that. He was satisfactory. But he became ill with cancer of the lung. He was there eight and nine and I think during Vema 9 he became — and that’s running into ‘56 — yes. He was taken off of the ship somewhere along the — no, it was number 10, in cruise 10. He — in cruise 11, he was still there. Cruise 12? Yes, now it’s coming back to me. Fred Usher came off in Trinidad and was repatriated. Then a young man who was his chief mate by the name of Bill [William] Smith — a bright young man — brought the vessel home. I can’t remember if Bill Smith made a trip with me or not. I believe he did. I really don’t know where I’d look for that. Because I lost those — I didn’t save the crew lists — much to my regret.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou had mentioned of course you saved many other things from the Vema — but the crew lists. But there may be copies of those in the Ewing papers.\n\nKohler:\n\nMaybe microfilm. Because when I went through some log books for some reason or another, I only — they mailed me down two which I have here. But they told me all those things had been microfilmed. But did they microfilm the crew lists? I doubt it. That was Vema 12 and then we went out on Vema 13, on October 19 — November 3. For that short cruise when they were sizing me up.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis was the shakedown.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. This was the shakedown.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat was that cruise like?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, it was a hell of a surprise to me. It was hard work. They made sure that it went through the whole bag of tricks. We worked in the Hudson Canyon. We worked up and down the shelf, I’d say between Sandy Hook and maybe up to Nantucket and back. We did a lot of work in Long Island Sound. They made sure they got an opportunity to ask me to get all the — to put her under sail and get all the sail on her. I can remember doing that on one occasion. We had a fresh breeze and we put all the sail on the ship. Then the — the jib was not on her. So someone came and asked me to put the other jib on, and I said, “Yes we’ll do that.” The crew had been working very hard and the scientists had just been looking on.\n\nDoel:\n\nWho was there among the scientists?\n\nKohler:\n\nThe ones that I remember very well would be Joe Worzel, Sam [Robert S.] Gerard and John Ewing. I don’t remember the rest.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay.\n\nKohler:\n\nI said, “Sure.” But I said, “My crew’s been very hard and I’m not putting the other jib on her unless the scientists get the hell up there and work too.” Because this jib is stored way in the aft end of the ship. We had to get it out, get it way forward, order it about, bend it on. It was a lot of work. They did. So we sailed a while. I don’t know how long, maybe a day — I can’t remember. And, well, we think we’ll go back to New York now. So then we took in all our sails — stored them properly — and nobody talked about it. So then came myself, in ‘57. I was there, of course, as you well know. The only person that relieved me — I think Sid [Sydney S.] Griffin, who was the port captain for some time — relieved me for leave on one occasion. He’s the one that said to Manik Talwani, “I’m surprised it took you so long to catch me.”\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay.\n\nKohler:\n\nI had a lot of trouble with him because he was always trying to undermine me. I don’t think he was trying to squeeze me out, but he was trying to undermine me constantly. I was pretty rough on him. He was always pleasant. He’s now captain of a U.S. cargo carrier, in and out of Halifax. My son-in-law, Peter, has piloted him. He’s always pleasant and he sends his best wishes to me. Because Peter had sailed with him while Griffin was relieving me. He’s a very bright young man, but not at all stable. He wasn’t a drunk. But totally — not a stable man.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou mean in terms of his character?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. He was very unpredictable I think. Anyway, he was the only one who ever relieved me — I think once. Then in the latter years, Peter [Cunningham] relieved me. After he got his foreign-going masters certificate.\n\nDoel:\n\nWe should say this is your son-in-law, Peter, which we’re talking about.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes.\n\nDoel:\n\nHe had sailed with you on the Vema for twelve years?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. He joined as ordinary seaman. He was a university boy, Dalhousie, I guess. He came to me through a friend in Halifax and joined me in Puerto Rico as an ordinary seaman. He did very well. He’s very smart and very personable.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nYou haven’t seen this abstract log of mine.\n\nDoel:\n\nNo, I haven’t. I should say that’s what you’re referring to. Yes, it would be a valuable addition to –\n\nKohler:\n\nI have the record here of all the chief scientists of every cruise and every leg. That may be of value to you.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nI haven’t found the original in hand writing.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou had mentioned that — possibly off-tape. You mentioned that you have some additional comments that you likely wrote in that that would be interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nWell this is Vema 15. This one seems to start with a real abstract log. I’m sure that my original one started when I joined it. This tells you where we’ve been, what we did, and other ships that we worked with. From port to port, date to date, total lists, and total fuel, total speed, chief scientists and very brief remarks such as: “Vessel encountered severe North Atlantic storm, fuel, water, and explosives jettisoned for safety. The main engine had piston seized in cylinder and extension, and heavy water damage.” I remember it well, very well. That was a bit of a bone of contention, why I dumped the fuel and the explosives. We had to lighten the vessel — fresh water — and eventually went into Savannah. But I’m sure that vessel would never have survived. It was near Cape Hattaras and, I say, it was a severe North Atlantic storm. I believe it was hurricane weather on the edge of the Gulf Stream. We had very, very confused seas. They were coming in over the bow, the stern, and both sides all at the same time. We were just about getting ready to be overwhelmed and I gave the order to dump the bloody water. I think we lightened her up by a hundred tons.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou needed that buoyancy at that point.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Fuel, water, and the other thing they were very upset about. We dumped all the detonator caps. They were very hard to transport. Not hard for them to get, but to transport. If I find the original, I’ll certainly get a copy for you. I know it’s here, but I — I’m sure it was in the filing cabinet. What have we got here?\n\nDoel:\n\nTell me which cruise you’re looking at. I just happen to notice, for instance, that Vema 14 — the first leg of that began just –-\n\nKohler:\n\nThat was fourteen.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat was fourteen that you’re referring to. Okay.\n\nKohler:\n\nFifteen.\n\nDoel:\n\nThank you.\n\nKohler:\n\nWhat do you got there on fourteen?\n\nDoel:\n\nI was just noticing that Vema fourteen begins less than a week after Vema thirteen ends.\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo, what happened during that period of time? You got back on that first leg of the Vema. How did you feel about staying on with the Lamont people at the time?\n\nKohler:\n\nAfter that first two or three weeks?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nI had no reservations about it. I thought, “Well that’s all right, I can live with this.” I knew that I had to make a lot of changes and improvements. I also was aware it couldn’t all be done at once. That’s exactly how I felt about it.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. You mentioned earlier about the — what you saw that needed to physically be fixed on the ship. What else were you making in your mind an accounting of what needed to be changed?\n\nKohler:\n\nThey had no real, organized administration for the operation of any ship — none. I started to tie together a lot of things. It took me a long time — procedures and standing orders. Have you ever seen my standing orders?\n\nDoel:\n\nNo.\n\nKohler:\n\nWell I’ll give you a copy. I’m going to go to the lavatory first and then I’ll call Mike Barker.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay, we’ll take a pause right here then. [Interruption]\n\nDoel:\n\nWe’re resuming here after a brief pause. You’ve pulled a few more things out from a number of the filing cabinets in the meantime.\n\nKohler:\n\nVema standing orders. Now I want to pull out the right ones for you.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. You mentioned you wanted to —\n\nKohler:\n\n“Captain Courageous,” this was written by Harry Bruce for —\n\nDoel:\n\nFor “Reader’s Digest” Magazine.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, for “Readers Digest.”\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. Although, as you say, it wasn’t published.\n\nKohler:\n\nIt wasn’t accepted. They asked him to do it. He had done things for them before.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut, and I should say “Captain Courageous” is a piece about you. About your role in sailing on the Vema. So that’s good. It’ll be good to see the copy of this when that becomes available.\n\nKohler:\n\nI’ll get a copy.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou might want to talk about the standing orders that you mentioned.\n\nKohler:\n\nWell that was part of — it took a while to work this up.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis is what you had in mind that you wanted to do once you saw the Vema and its operation.\n\nKohler:\n\n‘78. Those may have been the final ones. I revised them a couple of times as things change and so on. I had a set of regulations whereby data was put together that I was acquiring for scientists. But the buggers, you know, they weren’t too trustworthy. They’d grab anything they could get and shove it in their briefcase and go home.\n\nDoel:\n\nThe scientists you mean?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yeah. We kept corrected tracks of the vessel on our navigation charts. We also made charts and imposed the soundings on them regularly. It goes twelve years I think, before it was done by some wondrous machinery. They always got copies of it. We did a lot of copying. I kept a copy and Doc Ewing got a copy. Then the original track charts. Some of these guys before I realized it — well, I did realize it. If I wasn’t watching them as we were arriving port and they were leaving and going home, they’d go up in my chart room and gather all this stuff and take it with them. It just infuriated me. I got to the point, on one occasion, I used to take them down and shove them under my mattress so they couldn’t find them. They could have copies.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut not the originals.\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. It was very wrong — things like that. Well, it took me a while to get that together and to get it through to a lot of them that I was really working with them — not working against them. I know that I gave them a great deal which they wouldn’t have gotten from many people — not all people, but many people.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt sounds as if this just hadn’t been made as procedure during the earlier Vema voyages.\n\nKohler:\n\nThey had none.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo this kind of chaos then is present when you —\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly. Exactly. I trained that way. Right from the time I first worked with my father and I sailed in big companies. They were well organized. I was trained to do it properly and keep proper records and that sort of thing. It just shocked me the way I saw them. We had scientists who thought they had the full run of the ship. They could do whatever they wanted to do. I didn’t allow that. Going in and out of ports they wanted to stand around on the bridge — be up on the mast or someplace. I cleaned that up real quick. They didn’t like it.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut it sounds like that was allowed during the interim voyages?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Oh yes. I chased Joe Worzel too down off the bridge. I chased a lot of them. But eventually all accepted my way in that respect because they knew I was working with them and producing. I remember once with Dr. Ewing — if you want to hear this incident?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nIt wasn’t a ranger shot. It was some demand that he be in Washington to the President’s Scientific Advisory Committee. Doc was chief scientist. We were way out, well out, in the Western Pacific — in the Deep South latitudes, west of the Magellan Straits. Received a radio message for Dr. Ewing to be in Washington. He didn’t want to be, but he knew he had to be. He came to me and he said — at that time we had a Chilean liaison officer aboard — a lieutenant commander in the Chilean Navy. And Doc came to me and said, “Do you think you can get me into Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, on such and such a date?” I said, “Well, I can certainly try.” We were having horrible weather and heavy westerly gales. So we put the ship oh a course we thought might be right. We didn’t have satellite navigation at that time. We put the ship on the course which we felt was — I felt — was a good course to get into the western end of the Magellan Straits and on into Punta Arenas where there again be a plane waiting for him. We approached that coast which is a terrible coast to approach under bad weather. Because if you get in too close, you’re not getting out. It’s all over. And to find that entrance at all — oh, it’s a very difficult entrance to find. We had radar, but not very good radar. It didn’t give a radar picture on such a coast that you could see an entrance — if you can visualize what I’m saying. Just outside of that entrance is a rock bound island with a Chilean lighthouse called, the Island of Cuarenta Dias. Forty days they waited to get ashore just to service the light on one occasion. That gives you an idea of weather conditions there. Anyway, we’re approaching the coast under very tense conditions, very tense. I knew my responsibility. I was working very hard at it. I was certainly watching this radar to see if I could recognize anything. Doc was interested, of course. He was there hanging over my shoulder and so was the Chilean liaison officer was hanging over my shoulder and he had something to say. Finally, I said, “Look, both you, get out. I may only be captain here ‘til we get to Punta Arenas but until we do — get out.” Then went away and they didn’t say anything. The Chilean sulked quite a bit. But Doc didn’t — away he went. I got him to Punta Arenas. It was a very trying experience.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt sounds like that was.\n\nKohler:\n\nExtremely trying. But he could appreciate that. He didn’t mind that. You know I admire that in people.\n\nDoel:\n\nAs director of Lamont, he certainly had to delegate his own time and attention.\n\nKohler:\n\nOh, he certainly did. Because it was my responsibility and I didn’t need anybody looking over my shoulder. Because that doesn’t allow you to do your best work? He accepted it with grace. I put him ashore and he said, “I’ll be back in nine days — be here.” He was back in nine days and he still had the coat or the ass of his pants — I don’t remember which — stapled up.\n\nDoel:\n\nHe was clearly not in his best clothes when he left and he was in the same ones —\n\nKohler:\n\nI don’t think he had any good clothes. I never saw any.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou never saw — [Laughter]\n\nKohler:\n\nIt didn’t mean much to him.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas that really unusual that he was called from ship back to a Washington meeting in your experience? Or did that happen elsewhere?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I had two experiences with it, because of his appointment to President Eisenhower’s committee on science.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo this was happening right around the IGY [International Geophysical Year] period?\n\nKohler:\n\nI can find it in here. I think it might have been before.\n\nDoel:\n\nMaybe even before?\n\nKohler:\n\nWhen did President Eisenhower first take office? Was it after Truman?\n\nDoel:\n\nIt was after Truman — from 1953 he came on.\n\nKohler:\n\nIt would be in his second term.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd then through 1961. But it wasn’t a frequent occurrence? It was just very occasionally when this happened?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo, no. It only had to be of that significance that he would leave. Because when he came he didn’t come for a month. He only came for three months. Now the scientists used to shiver because they had to work with him for three months. Because he worked them and he worked them. They’d fall down in their tracks. But it didn’t bother me. It didn’t change my work, really, when he was there. I did the same work for all of them. I can remember one occasion — I can’t remember the exact incident. I can remember the incident, but not the time. We sailed for somewhere, I think it might have been Cape Town. He was looking for a sample of some particular sediment — some age — on I believe on the Agulhas Bank, which wasn’t far from Cape Town. Some of the scientists had performed in port — a lot of drinking and were in bad shape going to sea. He said to me, “I’ll work their ass off tonight.” And he did. He was real annoyed with them. Because they weren’t in shape to go to work. But they worked.\n\nDoel:\n\nWere these younger scientists?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Graduate students and younger scientists and so on. Oh yes, he didn’t pull any punches.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas there anyone else at Lamont who worked as hard as Ewing as you saw it on the ship?\n\nKohler:\n\nI would say, Joe Worzel — with no question. To measure the effort versus the end results, I would say, Doc, of course, was an eminent scientist. He probably got better results out of his work. But for pure physical effort, I don’t think — that crew who started it up, they were all alike. They were cut in his pattern. Drake and Worzel and all those people. They were all alike. You probably have heard those same things. Maybe it just confirms some of the things that you’ve heard before.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut, coming from your perspective, it’s a different one.\n\nKohler:\n\nI see. Q; I think it’s a real important insight that you’ve got.\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, my viewpoint and perspective may not always be accurate or the real true one. But at least I’m telling you the way I saw it. In retrospect — the way I felt about it. Which I think is quite important to the kind of work you do.\n\nDoel:\n\nAbsolutely. I think ultimately that’s what things do — [Cross talk] one thing I was curious about — go ahead.\n\nKohler:\n\nThere are times that Doc would go ashore and have drinks with you too, you know. Generally in port, he worked as hard as at sea. You could go look in his room at two, three o’clock in the morning and he’s writing papers. But there was a time he’d go ashore and have a good time for a few hours and then go back and work. Whereas other people, like myself, had to go back and have a few hours rest — not him. So, I interrupted.\n\nDoel:\n\nNo. No. Were there particular — could you tell when Doc Ewing would take a break like that or was it just when he felt like relaxing?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo, you could not predict it at all. In my case, I was in my room in the evening. He might just suddenly appear and say, “I’m very tired.” We’d just sit down and have a drink and have a nice conversation. He would go over a lot of things which he’d done in his earlier days: Developing seismic work for the oil companies, and generating the bathythermograph for the Navy. I believe that was his development. Am I right?\n\nDoel:\n\nHe was the first to make it a workable instrument after Athelstat Spillhouse [unclear].\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly. He would talk about those things. He would talk about his days at Woods Hole and his trips in the Atlantis. That sort of thing. He’d reminisce a bit.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid he do that with others or do you feel that in some ways, given your position and your character, he did that particularly with you?\n\nKohler:\n\nI feel, and I may be flattering myself — complimenting myself. I feel that he had a very good feeling for me. I sometimes think he felt if he wanted somebody to talk to when he was there in the ship; he could come and talk to me. He could talk on any level to me — not on a scientific level. But he would, many times, tell me some of the things he was trying to achieve. I always found him interesting.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m particularly interested in what you recall about those sorts of things that he would tell you. You mentioned the recollections from Woods Hole.\n\nKohler:\n\nHe enjoyed sailing very much. He’d talk about that. He’d have his sailboat at Woods Hole and kept the sails under his desk.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid he really? [Laughter] That’s interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nOf course, the Atlantis was a very fine sailing ship. He did a lot of sailing there. When he died, they sent me a message — I was in Rio de Janeiro. I must say it really upset me. I had a very, very emotional reaction to the news. It was sort of like my father had died. I felt really upset. It brought tears to my eyes. I can still remember. I was with people and I had to leave because I was too upset. I felt this man had been so good to me. I also felt he had so much he wanted to do — I wouldn’t know what it was. I’m sure that when he was struck down by that stroke, that he still had a lifetime of work looking down the road.\n\nDoel:\n\nHad you seen any signs of his health deteriorating?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh, he wasn’t in good health. He had real problems. At sea sometimes we had to look after him. I believe he had urinary tract problems. He went to sea with that and lived with it. We had, for several years, a medic from the Argentine Navy who was very good at it too. He used to look after Doc very well. He also had a heart problem of some kind. Because I remember once in very bad weather, he lost his pills. He was really upset. You know they were all over the damn place. They fell off of something. He was doing some cussing and swearing. He said, “If I don’t find those god damn pills, I’m going to die before I get ashore.” That sort of thing. Oh yes, his health was not good. He was just burned up and worn out.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nRon, that model, you know, they had built for me.\n\nDoel:\n\nI was going to ask you, in fact, about that. Now, we’re pointing to a model that is here in your office at home. A beautiful scale model of the Vema behind glass. The early Vema — with the sails -–\n\nKohler:\n\nOh, yes. When I took her, she didn’t have the topmasts, she had the lower sails.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nThe topmasts were taken off by the Merchant Marine School at Kings Point. The story behind the model: At the decommissioning — shortly after they commissioned a lady who worked there and I think she has died since. Her name is in there. I believe it’s an Armenian name. I knew her. She was an authority on model building of ships. She actually taught it at Mystic. That list up there is the scientists who contributed to pay for this model.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s very interesting. In fact, let me go there just to take a look at that —\n\nKohler:\n\nWhen the model was completed, Manik Talwani called me and said the model was completed and they wanted to bring it down to Nova Scotia and have a presentation. So between us we put something together. Manik brought it in his car. It wasn’t in that box; it was in a plywood box. I had that one made —\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd we’re talking about a glass casing.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, I had that built later — that’s Plexiglas. However, we then organized a dinner party at the Lord Nelson Hotel in Halifax. So I invited about, oh, it must have been fifty of my friends locally — all couples mostly. Manik and who else was here? Denny? I can’t remember. I don’t have —\n\nDoel:\n\nWas Chuck Drake here?\n\nKohler:\n\nPardon?\n\nDoel:\n\nWas Chuck Drake?\n\nKohler:\n\nI don’t — I can’t remember. But boy we put on some performance.\n\nKohler:\n\nEverybody I contacted — and there was a very modest fee for a couple for dinner of fifty dollars — nobody turned me down. I put on a party before dinner and the party after dinner. They were both real wing dings. What a performance.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow many people were from Lamont who came up for that?\n\nKohler:\n\nI can’t remember that. There were some from Lamont. There’s no question about that. I have photos of that party.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat would be interesting to see.\n\nKohler:\n\nA lot of nice speeches — very, very good — a bit of roasting. But that’s the list who commissioned this lady to do the model.\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. I’m reading now from the plaque which is on the wall. “The chief scientists of Lamont certificate of agreement on this twelfth day of March of the year 1981”. By and between — Porteat Takakian [unclear] and I believe this is the woman that you had in — “Ship model builder and a former chief scientist of Lamont to build for Captain and Mrs. Henry C. Kohler a model of the research vessel Vema.” There are more than about two dozen signatures on here. Looking down the list: Marc Langseth, Bob Houtz, Ken Hunkins, Denny Hayes, Marie Tharp, and Sam Gerard. Quite a few names — I can’t read quite all of them. But then Manik Talwani was included, Bryan, John Ewing, Jack Nafe, Joe Worzel and quite a few others. It is a beautiful model.\n\nKohler:\n\nIt’s well done.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt’s approximately — it’s a little over two and a half feet long.\n\nKohler:\n\nI have a lot of folders from that night, but I won’t get them out now because you have other things you want to do.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat we ought to do is get to that a little bit later in the interview, I think. Let me just pause for one. [Interruption] We’re resuming after another brief pause. Both of us right now are standing very near the model of the Vema. Was this how the Vema was essentially when you —\n\nKohler:\n\nThat is the original profile of a high class yacht.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow different was it by the time, in 1957, when you became captain?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, in 1957 the topmast and topsails had been taken away by the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. They had a fatal accident I think with a young man and they took the topmasts away. She had the lowermasts and the lower sails and this, of course, couldn’t be there because it was a jib topsail.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. Were the masts lower then?\n\nKohler:\n\nThose were separate. This is the mainmast and that’s the topmast. The sail area was reduced somewhat. But she could still sail like a witch. She was built for sailing — she was a naval sea boat. She was very, very capable.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow did you find her as a ship compared to all the other vessels that you sailed?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell it’s hard to compare because in this manner she was an able sea boat, more so than a heavy loaded freighter or a lightly loaded freighter. Some are better than others. Some are more comfortable than others. She wasn’t all that comfortable, but she was extremely safe.\n\nDoel:\n\nComfortable in the sense of roll action in the ocean?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. You could roll your guts out on her. But there’s no doubt about it, she was always safe.\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m noticing a few things here that we’ve spoken about both on and off tape. For instance, the steering wheel at the rear of the vessel.\n\nKohler:\n\nThat was the one that was given to Dr. Ewing. It really should have been left at Lamont — and I don’t think it was. The bell was also presented to him at the time of his leaving Lamont. It was a rather big bell and it was well mounted. I believe Denny Hayes might have carried it home. I’m not sure. Or Phil Rabinowitz — one of them.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd this was the bell that’s mounted here —\n\nKohler:\n\nNo, the bell always had been up on the bow. I don’t see it there. Not on the original.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay. And what was the bell used for?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, it was part of ship’s equipment. You can’t get a certificate for the ship unless you got a bell. It was used in anchored in fog. It was used for many things — time keeping.\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. It was the general purpose bell. What else had changed by the time that you came on in ‘57?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, on the deck, not too much. The bridge had been rebuilt, really in a very poor manner, but at least it was enclosed.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat was poor about it? This was prior to the time that you were —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, it wasn’t done very — it was enclosed, but it was done not really by experts. I don’t know who did it. But it was very badly done. But at least it kept people out of the rain and the snow. But it wasn’t satisfactory at all, and eventually we did it much better. We closed it in from the bridge there to this house. Which was renewed in steel.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay.\n\nKohler:\n\nThen we had a second house on top which included our chart room and the exhaust funnels and so on. But those changes did not take away any of her sea keeping qualities. Eventually the American eagle figurehead as you know was taken off and now is at Lamont. We changed the profile of the bow slightly, not greatly, but slightly. The bowsprit, of course, was taken away when the mast was taken out and the sails were done away with. But otherwise the hull form hadn’t changed. The after lab section was made much bigger.\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. You’re pointing to the rear cabin that was built on top.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis was expanded?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. A great deal. It left us with an electronics lab and a wet lab for wet work — like core work and water analysis and so on.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat changes were going on below decks during the time that — the first years you were there?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, trying to improve the almost primitive accommodations for scientists. And I think we did that within reason. There were great changes in the galley. It was very utilitarian and poorly equipped. In early years we changed that very much so. The design of it and also the equipment. Other than that — the officers’ quarters in the forward section of the lower deck had not been changed. They were always the same. From the time she was built until the time she was decommissioned.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo the scientists tended to be — their bunks, their quarters were in the stern of the ship.\n\nKohler:\n\nMore or less from the mid ships section aft.\n\nDoel:\n\nAnd the crew and the officers were quartered —\n\nKohler:\n\nThe crew was in what would be known as the forecastle. It was crowded, but they had very good accommodations — well heated. They had showers. They — well cared for. Scientists had their own mess, the officers had their own mess and the sailors ate in the forecastle.\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. How often did the groups mix then at dinner? Was it common for scientists ever to come to the officers’ table or vice versa?\n\nKohler:\n\nNever. No, no. They didn’t mix at meals. That’s all done away with in modern day shipping. Modern day shipping — finest big ships and the crew have — the entire ship’s company will have one great cafeteria and that’s the way it is.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow do you feel about that change?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, I don’t think it’s a change for the better. By any means whatsoever. It’s a change done for economics. It was also made a much lower cost operation such as the staff and so on. But it’s not good for morale. It’s not good at all. Of course I’m a traditionalist. I’m old fashioned. But I do not believe that I want to hear everything that the crew is talking about. And I don’t think the crew should know everything the officers are talking about at all. I feel very strong on the point. That it’s not a good operation.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut throughout the time that you were in command of the Vema, it still stayed essentially?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. And I never had any objection to this. They all ate the same food and the scientists and seamen went on the cafeteria line and they were served. Went to their two different areas to eat. And the officers sat in the officer’s wardroom and were served their meals.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay. That’s interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nHave you talked with Sam Gerard?\n\nDoel:\n\nI’ll meet him next week.\n\nKohler:\n\nSam should be interesting. He’s a very good talker. A long time employee as a scientist at Lamont and very competent in many, many things.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhen you say that, you feel that he had a broader range of talents than some of the other scientists?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. He exercised. He had talents in many, many directions and he exercised them. He was basically, I think, trained of a geographer. But he also appeared to me many times as sort of an inventor of equipment. He wore many hats through his service at Lamont which must have been thirty years at least. A lot of talent — easy to live with. I always looked at him as sort of an inventor.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid he talk to you about the things he was working on?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Oh yes. Sam is quite a talker. You’ll enjoy him.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat sort of inventions do you recall him discussing?\n\nKohler:\n\nI would think like instruments for measuring currents. He was always into something like smaller instrument development.\n\nDoel:\n\nMaking them more compact and easy to use.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. He’d bring them to the ship — current meters and that sort of thing. He’d work with testing them. He’d sail as chief scientist occasionally. He is a very good man.\n\nDoel:\n\nDid it take particular character to successfully be a chief scientist on Vema?\n\nKohler:\n\nUnfortunately, they didn’t always have the best kind of people available. There were — quite often they would have to send somebody that didn’t quite have, what shall I say, have the understanding of how to run their operation. In my opinion, there were times we had people who really only came and acted like a straw boss. Giving direction and, “Do this, do that,” — and they tried to do that. But there were times that they didn’t have people aboard who was the timbre of Denny Hayes or that kind of people or Wally Broecker anyhow. That happened quite often. There was one occasion when I was left alone. I have a letter here to that effect. In the Antarctic — I think it was Doc Ewing who left us. I served as chief scientist as a straw boss and kept records. From, and you come over here I’ll show you.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay.\n\nKohler:\n\nI can find all that in my records here. Let me show you very quickly.\n\nDoel:\n\nThank you. Now, I should say, we’ve left our chairs again, and we’re looking at the chart — the Vema cruise tracks from ‘53 to ‘81 that’s hanging on your wall.\n\nKohler:\n\nSo we worked with the Argentine Navy in this area and had a rough time for months. Then here in the South Sandwich Islands we rendezvoused with one Argentine Navy ship and an Argentine Navy transport. I’m pretty sure and I can prove that in my records. Doc Ewing left us and went back to Buenos Aires on the transport. I was to continue onward from here and we were too late in the season again.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou really wanted to be out of there much earlier.\n\nKohler:\n\nTo Cape Town. He gave me his program and I straw bossed it. With the scientists, we did the things that he wanted done whenever it was possible. We had a terrible passing. Actually we were fifty-four days from here, out to here, to the Saunders Island.\n\nDoel:\n\nFrom the tip of South America to the —\n\nKohler:\n\nTo Schweire and out to Saunders Island. From Saunders Island on to Cape Town. It was just something horrible — the weather we experienced. But we got through it and we did our work and did what we could and he felt it was reasonably well done. Late in the season and we almost got trapped here in ice.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat I wanted to hear about particularly. This might be a good time —\n\nKohler:\n\nAnother incident I almost got trapped in the Deception Island in ice which would have meant we were going to spend the winter there.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut this is a separate incident that —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat happened here when you almost got trapped?\n\nKohler:\n\nWell, we went down at uninhabited volcanic peaks. South Sandwich. The Argentine Navy, of course, they, Argentina has a claim on them. However, they were there a day ahead of us. She was a small ship working with us [unclear]. They sent a boat ashore and they got in the surf and lost their boat and the men got on the beach. They had nothing except seals. They shot a few seals and they made a fire with seal fat. They survived on seals. When I arrived then, the [unclear] was still there. [Telephone interruption] I don’t know whether they were afraid to go in and try to get their men off or they didn’t have a boat to do it. I don’t know. I can’t condemn them one way or another. Believe me, they’re not the best seamen in the world. The Argentineans are social giants, delightful people, but they’re not really producers of seamen.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou didn’t want to trust your life to —\n\nKohler:\n\nSo they asked me could I get these men off of the island for them. We had a lot of good boats on the ship. We had a navy whale boat. We had several small boats and we had several Lunenberg dories.\n\nDoel:\n\nThese are all with the Vema when you were sailing?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. I had men who fished in the dories from the big schooners on the Grand Banks. They knew how to handle a dory. They went in, went through the surf, made three of four trips, and brought the Argentine seamen out — no trouble.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s interesting. Then, was it afterwards that you had the problem with the ice?\n\nKohler:\n\nThen they all went back to Argentina because it was all over in the Antarctic. We were there too late. I was to go on to Cape Town. So we were anchored on this sand bar — a very small place to get your anchor on — and ready to sail at daylight. Through the night the officer on watch came down and said, “Captain, the wind has changed and the ice is coming in on us.” I thought if the ice comes in on us heavy enough, we’re going up on that sand bar. So I got my chief engineer out and his engineer was in the engine room, and we made ready to get our anchor home and get underway. I thought should I bring the entire ship’s company, including the scientists, on deck and let them know they should be worried — that we were in deeply serious trouble. I understand ice navigation very well and I also — so I only had myself, my officer on watch, my boson out, chief engineer, and the second engineer. Nobody else knew that we were in a very, very critical situation. It was doubtful if I made the right decision.\n\nDoel:\n\nAbout trying to get out?\n\nKohler:\n\nBecause — well, I had to try. But should I have had these people forewarned and on standby that we were in deeply serious trouble because the other two ships had gone. There was nobody left in the Antarctic. I said, “Well now,” and talked it over with my mate — “We’ll give it a try.” So we hauled our anchor home and we wiggled our way for hours out through the ice. It was pitch dark — pitch black, of course. We finally got her out to open water.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow did you navigate out? Did you have a bow light that you were using to spot the ice?\n\nKohler:\n\nNo. We completely blacked the ship out — everything. We didn’t have a good search light and it wasn’t the place to use it. I believed — and it’s always been very successful to black it out completely and depend on your eyesight — have the eyesight at its best by not having lights around.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s very interesting. So you used it as dark —\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly. No lights whatsoever.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou just had the natural light —\n\nKohler:\n\nOf which there was none. But I could see the ice and I could see little channels through the ice and wiggled out through that. It took many hours. I’d say by eight o’clock in the morning — this might have been two — by eight o’clock in the morning we could see the ice was lightening up. The wind was changing. We were getting out to a little more open water. From then on we had daylight. But we had a hell of a passage. Snow and gales of wind and real bad time.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo, then you were on the track from —\n\nKohler:\n\nFrom there to Cape Town.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou were still heading, generally, in an easterly direction, and then up and —\n\nKohler:\n\nI’m trying to think. Inaccuracy — that doesn’t show — into Cape Town. Oh yes, here it is.\n\nDoel:\n\nUltimately —\n\nKohler:\n\nHere it is. In the Deception Island we had a bad experience in the ice. Because Deception Island is a huge, huge harbor with a very, very narrow entrance. That great harbor is the crater of a huge volcano. That erupted a few years ago. However, on Deception, the British had a claim, the Argentines had a claim, and the Chileans had a claim. They all had their little navy bases. So, we decided we’d go in and actually it’s the people on these remote stations — they’re not unfriendly to each other. They were there establishing or maintaining their claims. While Chile and Argentina were having a hot war in here.\n\nDoel:\n\nRight. But they were still cordial enough —\n\nKohler:\n\nBut you know every weekend they got together for a football game. Maybe Chile camp one weekend, Argentina — all off the record — the next weekend. They’d have a dinner and so on. It was very, very nice.\n\nDoel:\n\nRoughly when was this that —\n\nKohler:\n\nI can give it to you.\n\nDoel:\n\nSure.\n\nKohler:\n\nYou want me to look now?\n\nDoel:\n\nNo, not now. But I just want to make sure we don’t lose —\n\nKohler:\n\nOkay. So we are going around this — first, to the Argentine base, then to the Chilean base. I was going back to the British base; the wind had changed again, and started to show ice at the entrance which was very, very narrow. The man in charge of the British base calls on the radio and asks, “Could we take their mail?” Of course I said we could take their mail. By the time we got to the entrance or exit — I have a chart of that. I might have it right here. I have a chart of that — my Deception Island Chart. I know I can find it very easily for you. If you want to make a note and we don’t get it today. Make a note for the Deception Island Chart. So, by the time we got to the entrance we’re very close to the British base — the ice was coming in very fast and very heavy. I can’t remember. I think we put the small boat out on the ice, maybe. I can’t remember the exact detail. But we did get their mail, but couldn’t stop and visit them. I had people — I was pretty well equipped then. I had long, long poles with spears on them — points on them — to push ice away from the propeller. Finally we got to the point where there’s nothing to do except to try to force our way out. The Vema was not a very strong vessel in that respect, when you consider ice. But she also, as you can see — her bow is nicely rounded.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt is.\n\nKohler:\n\nSo, I drove her real hard and hit the ice. She came and rode up on top of the ice to here.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s almost a third of the way down.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Then she broke down through it. And after that we were able to wiggle our way out through.\n\nDoel:\n\nBut, you really were worried that you might end up stuck?\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. I had my chief officer, not anywhere else except down below, in the bowels of the bow, to be sure that we didn’t spring her a leak.\n\nDoel:\n\nThis is John —\n\nKohler:\n\nNo, that was the chief engineer. I can’t remember who my chief officer was then. I can’t remember off hand. I had a few, of course. But it’s good for you — good for me, that you’re prompting my memory, or prompting me to the point that it refreshes my memory a great deal. I should have been doing a lot of this before.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas this incident with —\n\nKohler:\n\nAnother —\n\nDoel:\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKohler:\n\nWe had another very serious situation we got into in the Antarctic. We were then working with the Chilean Navy. We went to — were working down in here. This is the Palmer Peninsula.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes.\n\nKohler:\n\nThis is the Branfield Strait.\n\nDoel:\n\nThe extension from Antarctica that we’re referring to now.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, and Branfield Strait. We went to a little Chilean naval base which was at the foot of a huge glacier — Grinich Islands. We went there — not with our work — but the Chileans asked us to go there with them. Again, late in the season, too late. To pick up the body of the commanding officer of their little base, who had skied out over the edge of the glacier to the beach and killed himself. So we went there. It was a small harbor — very, very deep. Too deep to anchor, but it had one beacon. I don’t have the chart of that. The Chilean went in and anchored. He said, “You can come in and tie up alongside of me.” I said, “Fine.” So we did that. Then when I tied up alongside of him I just dropped my anchor on the bottom. I was not properly anchored because there wasn’t enough space to get an anchor in. We went ashore to the base and we had a nice meeting with them. Suddenly, the commanding officer of the base said, “Uh oh.” I think he said the wind is coming from the east. It started to snow. He said, “We’re in for a real blizzard.” Well, both the Chilean captain and myself said, “We got to get out of here — get out of this bay.” So we left and got to our ships I would say within an hour, two hours. It was bad conditions. It was a very, heavy blizzard gale of winds. Then what made it so hazardous — the glacier started calving. It was calving huge chunks which were drifting down on our ships. The temperature went way below zero — freezing real hard. I’ll elaborate, but I’ll not exaggerate.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. No, I’d like to hear what you experienced.\n\nKohler:\n\nThe vessel started to ice up. I’ve always had great respect for ice because if the vessel ices up above deck, you lose your stability.\n\nDoel:\n\nBecause the weight added on can make it —\n\nKohler:\n\nAt this time we had a lot of top hamper and a lot of rigging that would gather ice quickly.\n\nDoel:\n\nWere the sails still on at that time?\n\nKohler:\n\nI can’t remember that. I suspect because I was very concerned about beating the ice off of the rigging. So, I started. We were forty people aboard, including scientists. I have the record of who would be the chief scientist, but I didn’t have any problem with him. However, I split the forty people in two twenty man watches. I said, “Now we’re going to keep the vessel clear of ice.” Scientists didn’t think we should go on deck and pound ice and shovel it overboard. They quickly learned — they did.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat convinced them besides you’re telling them?\n\nKohler:\n\nI just told them they were going to do it and that was the end of it. There were some protests. Then I told them again and they went at it. I explained to them so they didn’t think it was a stupid thing we were doing, as it looked first. I understood that part of it. Then —\n\nDoel:\n\nThe storm is meanwhile continuing at the same intensity.\n\nKohler:\n\nIt was terrible. So, the Chilean ship — they barred up their doors and they all went inside and you couldn’t see anybody on deck. She was icing heavily. Then after a while — I was on the bridge of our ship and we were laying alongside of his. The captain came out on his bridge, and he said to me — he was that close to shout across. He said to me, “Captain, now you’ll have to go.” Then, we were using our engines to hang on where we were. We were two ships tied together. We had two anchors down — they’d just dropped on the bottom. They were not doing a lot. His was well-anchored.\n\nDoel:\n\nBecause he was on the mount.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, first. He planned to stay. So did I. I can remember the situation really well. It was one of the very critical ones of my work. I said, “Go, go where?” There was nowhere to go. It was a bad place to get out of. And I said, “I’m not going.” He said, “Oh, you’ll have to go. There’s only room for one ship.” I thought, you son of a gun. I thought worse than that. So, my people were pounding ice and his wasn’t. So I finally said to my boson — who was at one end of the ship and somebody on the other — maybe one of the mates and the crew were working, pounding and shoveling ice. I said, “Look, the first person that comes out on that ship to cast our lines over.” This is a quote. I’m quoting myself I guess. I said, “Hit him with a fire ax. We are not leaving here.” I knew it was fatal if we left. I knew that. Nobody came out. Nobody came out. We survived that one. So when the weather moderated enough that we could get out of this enclosed area, which mostly was formed by this huge glacier — they did have the body of their officer on board. Then it was possible for us to get out. Here is the passage I told you about.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow long did it take, by the way, for the storm to clear out during that —\n\nKohler:\n\nI’d say it was thirty-six hours or more. This is the passage we had to make — from near here, to get back to Schweire. That was the passage I told you about when our electronics failed. Our electrical system failed. We had a terrible time — terrible time. But you have to take from that what you want. That’s as close as I can remember it, without exaggerating, in a very, very critical situation.\n\nDoel:\n\nIn your experience in sailing, that ranked as one of the most critical —\n\nKohler:\n\nMemorable — you have many if you spend your life at sea. But that’s memorable. This is the one. My wife was with me.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay. And we’re pointing now below —\n\nKohler:\n\nCape Town. I think it’s twelve hundred miles. We went down to the ice.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s the extent of the ice pack in the — right about sixty degrees. A little past zero degrees south longitude.\n\nKohler:\n\nIn effect, we worked from this latitude here to north of Spitzbergen up here. My wife was in both of those areas with me.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s very interesting. North of Spitzbergen — we’re talking about over eighty degrees north as well.\n\nKohler:\n\nI think we made eighty thirty. And then no more.\n\nDoel:\n\nWas that generally easier a time for you when you were up in the Spitzbergen area?\n\nKohler:\n\nIn the north, the weather systems pass by much more quickly. They’re more constant here. Up here you get a violent one but it passes quickly. It passes very quickly. You don’t get the horrendous sea conditions. The great westerlies swung right around the world.\n\nDoel:\n\nIndeed. You have no land mass there and so —\n\nKohler:\n\nExactly. So the buildup of seas is what takes place there. I don’t know if I’m telling you too much or not enough.\n\nDoel:\n\nI think this is very interesting.\n\nKohler:\n\nThis is Scorsby Sound [Greenland].\n\nDoel:\n\nYou’re pointing up at the eastern coast of Greenland.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. You can see our track right close here. Scorsby Sound — Greenland at that time was still a Danish territory. Scorsby Sound was very isolated. The east coast is greatly isolated compared to the west coast. Anyway, we’re working up close in here and the little Danish station there is calling me — talking with me. I guess they’re so isolated they like to talk to anybody and love to see anybody. They invited us very carefully to come in and spend the night. I was really tempted. It’s a historic place and a beautiful sound and it was clear. Well, I studied my weather reports — such as we used to get by radio. I could see there were certain systems. It was a very dangerous place. There were systems nearby and I thought we may get caught there again. So I worked right into, almost the entrance — five miles off. Finally I knew I shouldn’t do it. It was all clear and they were telling us that there was no ice in the sound. Everything was clear. They said, “You’ll be all right until tomorrow.” I didn’t go. The next morning when we working off shore, they called me. I asked them, “Well, how are the conditions in the sound now?” They said, “She’s blocked solid with ice.” We’d have been in there.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s very interesting. It was possible to consider doing things like that during the evenings when one had the tracks spotted along the —\n\nKohler:\n\nOh yes. Oh yes. It would even be worthwhile examining the bottom, you see, for scientists to see what the sediments are — to take cores and so on.\n\nDoel:\n\nThat’s true. Right.\n\nKohler:\n\nUp here — twice we’ve been into this — Longyearbyen is the name. As you probably know, Spitzbergen or Skalbar [unclear], as the Scandinavians call it, has been a protectorate of Norway and Russia to some extent. But no declared sovereignty. So we were into the Norwegian base twice in that deep Longyearbyen Sound. It was very interesting — past the Russian base — and they invited us to stop. But I wouldn’t go into their base. Not at that time.\n\nDoel:\n\nSo this was in the height of the Cold War?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. So we put into Murmansk. We did some good work. That’s over here. This is the “K-O-L-A,” no inland. Here it is. Here’s where Murmansk is. Do you see Murmansk there? I don’t think —\n\nDoel:\n\nI’m actually looking for Archangel. Murmansk is here and that’s where the —\n\nKohler:\n\nYes, this is the Kola inlet. That was a very interesting experience in playing games with Russians.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat was that — What happened there? I heard about that before.\n\nKohler:\n\nWe got to Murmansk. And we got to — not quite Vladivostok — Nakatar, a Siberian port in the Japan Sea. It was at the time of President Nixon’s policy of “detente,” and certainly U.S. flag ships couldn’t get in. We were flying the Panamanian flag, but it was —\n\nDoel:\n\nBecause of the Panamanian registry of the Vema.\n\nKohler:\n\nThe scientific community here and in the U.S. was starting to work together a good bit. We worked with a couple of their ships. We had some of their people on board whom I know were there for different purposes than what they said they should be there. Should I take the time to tell you about our visit into Murmansk?\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. I really would like to hear it.\n\nKohler:\n\nOkay. We were working in the Bering Sea and we were doing seismic work independently. But we had the Russian submarines following us around all the time. We knew that. Anyway, I was scheduled to go into Murmansk and we went in — right up. It’s a long inlet — Kola inlet. We went into Murmansk. I think we were there four days. It’s in Manik’s time, I guess.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhen this happened?\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. I believe. He certainly came there anyway, with a large delegation from Lamont.\n\nDoel:\n\nInteresting. Okay.\n\nKohler:\n\nThe Russian science community — whatever you want to call them — they sent a big delegation. They had meetings there. Number one: We did measure some things for Joe Worzel’s gravity program. I’m sure they didn’t know we were measuring gravity. It was very, very important at that time. I believe the data — and you can correct me when you might find somebody else — was used in the navigational instruments of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of those days.\n\nDoel:\n\nIndeed. That’s exactly right.\n\nKohler:\n\nWe were measuring gravity. That was an important factor, I believe. I don’t think they knew it.\n\nDoel:\n\nThey didn’t know that you were doing that?\n\nKohler:\n\nThey knew many other things we were doing.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow did you get a sense that they didn’t know that you were doing the gravity work?\n\nKohler:\n\nThey might have known the equipment was aboard, but I don’t believe they knew it was running. I can’t tell you exactly. Maybe Manik told me. I’m not sure of that. However, along with all this, we did some socializing with them. They were extremely suspicious, as all Russians are. I guess the people we were dealing with were third generation Communists. There were no loyalties to anything except Lenin. Not even to family. It was perfectly obvious too.\n\nDoel:\n\nYou mean you could see the way they were treating family members?\n\nKohler:\n\nOn yes. The first amusing incident: They came aboard with some port officials. They were very pleasant and cooperative. We went through our formalities in our ward room. I would have had a couple officers around me, possibly Manik. I don’t remember. The man in charge had a deputy with him. She was a very beautiful blonde girl — real Russian. But she didn’t say much. So, we were going through and they gathered all the permits and all the passports. Everything would be laid on and regulated by them for shore leave and all that sort of thing. But then the man in charge said, “But Captain, we won’t take your permit — your passport. And all crew members will be brought back to the ship at midnight. But if you want to stay ashore, you can stay ashore.” That’s what the girl was — the bait. My wife was sitting right down the alley way. Obviously, they were trying to set up to get me ashore to pump me. Well, it didn’t work. The next humorous incident: We had with the scientific staff — a real nice guy — an American black man. He was a real black man. And he used to laugh at everything. At the berth we were in — at the pier or wharf — at the bow of the ship was an armed guard carrying machine gun or a sub-machine gun. At the stern was one. At the gangway was too. Across the water, at the other dock was four or five — all armed, watching us? Whenever the people went ashore, they had to stop, of course, and go through all the passports and look at this man. They’d say, “That’s okay.” But, there was always a bus waiting to take them to the Seaman’s Club or take them to the store for foreigners and so on. But this black man used to really laugh. He’d say, “You know every time I go ashore, they get those passports out and they look at mine and they look at me.” And he said, “I’m sure I’m the only black man north of Moscow.” [Laughter] He had a great sense of humor. I remember him well.\n\nDoel:\n\nWhat was his name? Do you recall? We can add that to the transcript later.\n\nKohler:\n\nI can’t remember. However — we did on one occasion — they had a symposium and it was very interesting. They had a lot of presentations and papers read. Of course, they had interpreters, but some could speak English. They said after — I think it was four o’clock and our work was finished.” We said, “We’ll have Russian tea.” It was fine. Russian tea, of course, turned out to be a lot of nice things to eat — and vodka. A lot of vodka. So we had quite a party. Now these young men that I had there from the scientific staff — they brought ashore a tape recorder and American music. That would be rock music at that time?\n\nDoel:\n\nProbably so.\n\nKohler:\n\nIn the seventies. It was ‘69 or ‘73. I don’t remember. They loved it. They had a dance and they had a hell of a time — including us. My wife was with me. We had a good time. The next day we put a party on board Vema. The Russians are big boozers. And boy, if they get Scotch whiskey, they won’t look at vodka. They only drink vodka because they can get drunk. But they love Scotch whiskey, and I had a lot of it. We were pouring it into them by the glassful. They weren’t badly behaved. We had a wonderful time. We had a nice big buffet dinner for them and everything was fine.\n\nKohler:\n\nThis one man, a Russian scientist, who could speak English. He was sort of following my wife around. After a while my wife asked him where he lived. Well, his home was in Leningrad. But he’d been up there a long time. After a while she said to him, “It looks to me like you better get back to Leningrad.” [Laughter] I think he had designs on her. But, I did say to Manik one morning after that party — I said, “Manik, there’s a lot of guys here who are not scientists.” “Oh no,” he said, “they’re KGB.” But, he said, “Don’t worry about it.” When they had that big ship in New York, we had a hundred CIA aboard.\n\nDoel:\n\nIs that right?\n\nKohler:\n\nThat’s what he told me — a hundred CIA aboard. They were posing as scientists.\n\nDoel:\n\nYes. When was that ship in New York? That’s relatively new for me.\n\nKohler:\n\nI forget her name but it certainly was in the time of the early part of President Nixon’s detente. Denny and those people could tell you.\n\nDoel:\n\nOkay.\n\nKohler:\n\nThat is certainly recorded.\n\nDoel:\n\nIt was the Soviet ship’s visit into New York harbor.\n\nKohler:\n\nYes. Yes. It was all very interesting. Then, not the same voyage or the same year, we were into the Sea of Japan and the Siberian port of Nakarta [unclear]. It’s like being in a concentration camp.\n\nDoel:\n\nHow’s that?\n\nKohler:\n\nThey played huge search lights on us twenty-four hours a day. They did take our crew ashore. They did drunk them up. I mean really drunk them up. But these young men didn’t have anything to tell them, but the Russians thought they had. When we sailed from there, a Russian ship tagged us for a week or more. We had on board a Russian who was supposed to be a scientist — but he wasn’t. We learned that somehow he "
