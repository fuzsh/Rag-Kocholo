        "text": "The employee tunnels are an unmarked location in Nuka-World in 2287.\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe employee tunnels below Kiddie Kingdom became a refuge for the workers in this section of Nuka-World for many years after the Great War, including Oswald the Outrageous, Rachel Watkins, Dean Becker, Mitchel Sikes, Fran Fowler, Evan Barnes, Herman and Bradley Benson, and others. Radiation storms, attacks by mobs of desperate civilians and raiders, starvation, and \"The Affliction\" (which turned many survivors into feral ghouls) gradually took their toll on the community, such that as of 2287, only Oswald and his painted feral companions remain.[1][2][3]\n\nLayout[]\n\nThere are four entrances to the tunnels in Kiddie Kingdom. One entrance is north of the Fun House in a small alcove in the tunnel where the Nuka-Racers pass under King Cola's Castle in the northeast corner of the zone. The second (Expert-locked) entrance is just northeast of the Blast Off! ride behind a wooden fence marked \"Employees Only\". The third entrance is south of the Blast Off! ride at the end of a short alley to the left of a poster featuring Nuka-Girl. Finally, the fourth (Advanced-locked) entrance is west of the Nuka-Racers track in the northwest corner of the zone. The Kiddie Kingdom tunnels key found in King Cola's Castle Tower can be used to unlock the two locked entrances.\n\nEntering through the door south of the Blast Off! ride leads to a wide tunnel heading north. At the end of the tunnel, one of the exterior exits is at the top of a stairwell to the south. Continuing west through a farm area then north leads to a central room featuring the refugee terminal, a cooking stove, an Expert-locked trunk, some bunk beds, a mattress, and a sleeping bag. To the west at the end of a utility corridor is another exterior exit. To the east through a hole in the wall is an employee lounge with a pool table. North of the lounge is another stairwell to the east ascending to the final exterior exit.\n\nOswald the Outrageous will be seen through a window near the stairwell talking to a painted ghoul; Oswald will vanish after the dialogue. Continuing west and down a set of stairs to the north leads to a flooded radioactive room with pumps and a pipe to the secure beverageer lab. A metal grate blocks the entrance to the pipe, with the Novice-locked terminal opening the grate only accessible from the lab.\n\nIn the southeast corner of the flooded room on the upper level is the pump control room, which contains the pump control system terminal and a bed. The Kiddie Kingdom radioactive sprayers can be deactivated using the terminal, but if Oswald is still in the area, he will reactivate them after the player character leaves the tunnels.\n\nNotable loot[]\n\nKiddie Kingdom tunnels key - In the pump control room, on the console next to the pump control system terminal.\n\nNuka-Cola lunchbox - In the pipe leading to the secure beverageer lab, on a metal shelf in the small alcove with the Novice-locked terminal.\n\nTwo Nuka-Cola Quantum - In the pipe leading to the secure beverageer lab, in a wooden crate in the small alcove with the Novice-locked terminal.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nThe employee tunnels appear only in the Fallout 4 add-on Nuka-World.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe tunnels are based on the \"utilidor\" tunnel system that runs underneath Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.\n\nGallery[]"
