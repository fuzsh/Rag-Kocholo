        "text": "Environmental Conditions\n\nThe climate is greatly affected by the presence of the White Sea. This sea freezes in winter (as opposed to the north of the Kola Gulf in Murmansk), which results in the much greater continentalism of the climate (Aune et al. 2011). The White Sea influence, however, brings about much higher humidity and more frequent precipitation in the summer. Summers in Kandalaksha are very short and the winter is colder than in Murmansk, although the snowfall is much smaller (especially when the White Sea freezes). Spring comes only at the end of April and winter starts in October. The average January temperature is − 12 °C, while its summer counterpart is + 14 °C (Møer et al. 2001, Murmansk Visitor center). However, the slightly more southern location of the city enables the height of trees to become much higher than in Murmansk. In the neighborhood of the city, pine appears up to 10 m high (Figs.3 and 4). Also nearby is the Kandalaksha Tundra — the hills are overgrown with forest that passes rapidly into the forest and the tundra in the peaks of the mountains (Fig. 5A and B). On the shortest day of the year, the sun shines for 1 h and 13 min, while the polar day occurs between June 2 and July 11. The vegetation of these mountains consists of three floors: spruce forest reaching from 400 to 600 m above sea level, birch forest reaching from 550 m above sea level, alpine (tundra) reaching from 600 m above sea level.\n\nFlora of Kandalaksha Region\n\nAbout 360 species of vascular plants can be found in this area. Arctic, Subarctic, and Arctic-Alpine species constitute as much as 51% of all flora, while 41% are Boreal species. Artoalpine species, however, at 16.7%, dominate in areas of higher elevation (Konstantinova 1999; Konstantinov et al. 2014; Koroleva 1994; Trutnev and Kamelin 2008), while throughout the region, Arctic and Subarctic species account for 22% of all plant listings. Apart from the vascular plants, 400 species of mosses and 350 lichen species are known to exist here (Fig.3B). The Kandalaksha flora is a combination of typical Subarctic and Boreal flora with a distinct coastal component, and coniferous forests, tundra, meadows, coastal marches, and rock vegetation coexist. The most diverse place is Barynya Rocks, where the cotoneaster (Cotoneaster cinnabarinus Juz.) and mezereum (Dáphne mezéreum) grows, and in a miniature cave in the rock — the northern Asplenium (Asplénium septentrionále) has a presence. Moreover, a resident of more southern regions will be surprised to see the famous wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) growing in rocky outcrops. In the vicinity of Kandalaksha, the explorer can also find one of the most spectacular northern orchids, the Common Shoe (Cypripedium calceolus), which is found in soils rich in carbonates (Konstantinova 1999; Konstantinov et al. 2014, Koroleva 1994, Trutnev and Kamelin 2008). In addition, one of the most fragrant species of northern orchids, Platanthera bifolia (L.) is known to grow here, while the elegant Calypso bulbosa (L.) has been spotted.\n\nThe treeless sea islands, called Pomors Luds, are sometimes covered with very lush thickets of golden root (Rhodiola Rosea). This valuable medicinal plant has long been used by the Sami and Pomors as an adaptogenic agent, not inferior to the famous ginseng. Its pronounced adaptogenic effect has led to a reduction in its number due to uncontrolled gathering. The rocky shores of the islands are also inhabited by such spectacular species as maritime (Maritime mertension), and black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) (Konstantinova 1999; Konstantinov et al. 2014; Koroleva 1994; Trutnev, Kamelin 2008). Many plants of the coastal flora have a succulent appearance, resembling the plants of hot deserts rather than the Arctic. This feature is connected with the necessity of economical use of water on the rocky and sandy shores of the White Sea.\n\nThe seaside rocks during the flowering period are unforgettable views. Thymus (Thymus vulgaris L.) and sedum (Sedum acre L.), Rubus chamaemorus L. (Fig. 2A), and in the coastal zone just above the water, open inflorescences of salt aster (Tripolium pannonicum subsp. Heracleum sibiricum L.) are common on the supralittoral. Unlike its aggressive relative, Sosnovskiy Borschikovik, this last species is not phytotoxic and its young leaves were used by Pomors in the preparation of green soups. Tripolium (L.) Greuter can also be seen. This plant reveals its inflorescences right under the water. Several edible plants have made up a significant part of the Kola Pomors’ diet. Dragonfly (Cochlearia officinalis L., Scots lovage (Ligusticum scoticum), sorrel (Rúmex acetósa), and garlic chives (Allium schoenoprasum) (Konstantinova 1999; Konstantinov et al. 2014; Koroleva 1994; Trutnev, Kamelin 2008) commonly grow here and were seasonally harvested.\n\nHistorical View\n\nDuring the 4–3 millennium BC, groups of northern peoples came to the Arctic who were ethnically related to the Volga-Oki tribes (Aleksandrova and Ekaterina Aigina 2014; Garkotin 2013, Murmansk Visitor Center, History of the Kola Territory). They settled along the banks of rivers and lakes in the inner part of the Kola Peninsula. Because their ceramics were decorated with deep pits and comb marks, they were called “pottery culture” tribes. They used boats and nets, bone hooks, and advanced harpoons (with a rotating tip) for fishing. In the sea bays, they hunted seals, and on land — deer and elk. At the end of the second — the beginning of the first millennium BC — the Arctic climate became warmer and drier, and deciduous trees advanced north up to Khibina. During this time, tribes known for their asbestos ceramics came to the Kola Peninsula from the Northern Urals (in the production of their cooking-ware, they added crushed asbestos to the clay, and a grid-like ornament was applied). These belonged to the Finno-Ugric group. As a result of the amalgamation of newcomers with the old population of the region, the Finnish-speaking people — the ancient Saami — gradually developed. They were Europeans in physical appearance, but they also had expressed features of eastern origin.\n\nThe first written information about the Saami came from the Norwegian sailor “Other,” from the ninth century, who sailed along the shores of the Kola Land, but more detailed descriptions by Russian settlers soon appeared, according to which the Saami did not have huts but lived “in stone chasms” and ate “only animals, birds and fish sea,” they knew no bread or vegetables, and the clothes were sewn from wild deer skins. The Novgorod Russians paved the way to the Far North. Thus, the chronicle reports about Veliky Novgorod, who in 1032, with his people reached the White Sea (Aleksandrova and Ekaterina Aigina 2014; Garkotin 2013, Murmansk Visitor Center, History of the Kola Territory). Following the initial pioneers, the Novgorodian officials came to the Terski coast and imposed a fief on the Saami. The first evidence for these accounts is in the chronicles of 1216.\n\nThe right of Veliky Novgorod to the Arctic was, however, questioned by the Swedes. In 1251, Alexander Nevsky managed to conclude an agreement with them, which specified the procedure and the amount of tribute collected from the Saami. However, this agreement was often broken, resulting in clashes between Russians and Swedes, such as the Novgorod campaign in 1323, when the Russians, the Karelians, and the Sami, following ships along the northern coast, made their way west and captured and burned the palace of the Swedish rulers.\n\nIn the mid-fifteenth century, the first Russian villages appeared on the Tersky coast — Varzuga and Umba. Settlers came from southwestern Pomerania, which was part of the Novgorod region. Russian settlers noticeably overtook the Sami in production and everyday life. They brought with them a more complex system of social relations. All this had influence upon the development of the Sami people. Thanks to the exchange of goods with the Russian population, metal products, fabrics, fishing equipment made of hemp yarn, and agricultural products penetrated the Sami economy. They had the opportunity to borrow production skills and join Russian culture. As a result of communication with the Russian population, the Laplanders gradually changed their religious beliefs, developed individual ownership of fisheries, and the tribal system was weakened. The incorporation of the Kola Peninsula into the lands of Novgorod and bringing the Sami closer to the Russian people became an important stage in the development of the region (History of the Kola Territory).\n\nGeological Structure\n\nThe Lapland Granulite Belt is an important element of the Lapland-Kola Mobile Belt, separating the Archean zones of the Kola — in the north and the Belamoryian Blocks in the south (Bayanova et al. 2002; Daly et al. 2006; Huber 2001, 2013; Huber 2014a, b; Jong 2009; Kilistyn et al. 1999; Kozlov 1990; Kozlov and Ivanov 1991; Kozlov et al. 1995; Mints et al. 1999; Mitrofanov 2000; Pozhilienko et al. 2002). The unit has the character of being highly fragmented, tectonized rock blocks. It is exposed to a large extent on the northern stairs of the Kola region and in Finland, and in a small belt of heavily shelled and reduced blocks in the Kandalaksha region. Observations made by the author in the years 1999–2009 showed that the rocks of the Lapland Granulite Belt in the Kandalaksha area and the surrounding formations were piled up and tectonically rejuvenated, eventually forming a chain of low hills reaching up to 900 m above sea level. These are located in the central part of the Lapland-Kola collision zone (Barbey et al. 1984; Bernard –Griffiths et al. 1984; Bridguoter et al. 1999; Filatova 2002; Glebovitsky 2005; Huber 2014a).\n\nThe geology of the Lapland Kola Granulite Belt (LPG, Figs. 4 and 5) as a collision zone is roughly known, although the detailed aspects of the position of LPG, its structure, and the mutual relations of individual rocks, especially intrusions, are still undefined. The LPG is a unit with the character of an elongated crescent, visible in the eastern region of the Kola zone and within Finland and Norway, while in the Kandalaksha region it is seen as a very reduced strip 20 km wide and 100 km long (Bayanova et al. 2002; Huber 2014a, b; Jong 2009; Kozlov 1990; Mitrofanov 2000; Pozhilienko et al. 2002). From the northwest side, LPG Kola borders with rocks belonging to the so-called Piechenga greenstone structure. In turn, from the south, LPG borders on the granite gneisses of the crystalline Belamoryian block, while from the west it contacts the gabbroid intrusion rocks of Monchetundra and Monchepluton. In the vicinity of Kandalaksha, LPG Kola is surrounded from the north by the metamorphic Imandra-Varzuga complex, from the east by the crystalline rocks of the Kola block, and from the south and west by the crystalline rocks of the White Sea block. This belt can be divided into two large zones: the northwest more extensive and thick, and the southeast much smaller, but more geologically diverse, lying on the White Sea. Between these units, in the Monchegorsk area and also south of this massif, these rocks disappear. The LPG area is a structure made of metamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic and metaintrusive rocks (Kozlov 1990; Kozlov and Ivanov 1991; Kozlov et al. 1995). This structure includes the Tannaelv-Javroziero rock belt (built of metavolcanic-intrusiverocks, metamorphosed in amphibolite facies (Barbey et al. 1984, 1990; Kozlov 1990; Kozlov and Ivanov 1991; Kozlov and Martynov 1992; Kozlov et al. 2010), the central part with rocks of the sedimentary and plutonic sequences that are metamorphosed in granulite facies (Kozlov 1990), and a belt of intrusive rocks containing xenoliths (Huber 2014a). In the Kandalaksha region, a series of meta-volcanics, mainly represented by amphibolites with garnets, and the accompanying formations of metamorphosed tufa-sedimentary rocks (amphibolite shales and amphibolite-quartz-garnet schists) were separated, forming in each area, 4 complexes of overlapping rock layers (Huber 2014a). They are classified into the Kandalaksha Layer and the Luvienga Layer (metasediments) LPG profiles. Above them are the Poria Depth stratigraphic layers, exposures of which are found in the region of Kolvitsa, in the south-eastern region in the vicinity of the Poria Depth and east of it. These are represented by metagabbro-anorthosites.\n\nThe rocks located within the Kandalaksha part of LPG can be classified as amphibolites (amphibole schist, Fig. 6A and B) and granulites (ortho- and para-metamorphic) and are accompanied by amphibole-plagioclase gneisses (metaintrusive) (Bayanova et al. 2002; Bushmin et al. 2007; Jong 2009; Korikovsky and Aranovich 2014; Kozlov 1990; Mitrofanov 2000; Pozhilienko et al. 2002). These rocks bed upon each other, and in many exposures, a continuous transition of one type of rock to another is visible.\n\nThe garnet containing amphibolite has a black-red color and a grano-lepido-nematoblastic structure. They are of a dense texture, are disorganized, and include less directional schists, small gneissics, or eyelets (Fig. 6C). The mesh texture is generally associated with the occurring forms of pomegranates, surrounded by a quartz-plagioclase band, often with tremolite inclusions. They are built mainly of amphiboles (50–80%), plagioclases (3–20%), pomegranates (20–45%), and accessory and ore minerals.\n\nThe common hornblende is sometimes accompanied by small mica blades up to 1 mm. It is generally a high-titanium biotite, which, like titanite, is stuck in amphibole interventions. In some samples, diopside crystals appear next to the hornblende or biotite. The garnets form a solid solution of almandine with a grossular and andradite molecule, less often a pyrope one. In interstitions of these minerals, blast minerals from the group of chlorite, epidote, acid plagioclases, and carbonates are also observed, especially in zones where the rocks in question have been subjected to chloritization and saussuritization processes. These minerals are most often associated with grenades and hornblendes appearing in their interventions. Epidote occurs most often in shear zones and micro-fractures of shear nature and is accompanied by clinozoisite. The ore minerals mentioned above are usually iron oxides and sulfides (magnetite, pyrite, chalcopyrite) and titanium oxides and silicates (rutile, ilmenite, titanite).\n\nThe granulites that are associated with the amphibolites in the northern zone are massive yellowish-pink-greenish rocks, with large pyroxene and pomegranate blasts reaching up to several millimeters, in the background of plagioclase-quartzite (Fig. 6D). The structure of these rocks is grano-lepidoblastic; the texture is random or directional. Some of these rocks have relict textures reminiscent of layering and fractional graining, highlighted by quartz blasts (Huber 2014a). They are made of the following: pyroxenes (approx. 5%), pomegranates (approx. 20%), plagioclases (up to 40%), quartz (up to 59%), amphiboles (up to 5%), and ore minerals, mainly rich in titanium (up to 8%). In these rocks, leucocratic minerals predominate. Microscopically, in the granulate, a leucocratic rock background with single glomeroblasts of melanocratic minerals is visible, which are represented by quartz and plagioclase crystals. They are arranged in the rock in an orderly manner, creating laminates built of blasts with different gradations of grain diameter, less often randomly. These are in the form of glomeroblastics, sometimes spindle-blasted, and quartz minerals that often have suture boundaries. Plagioclase is mainly represented by oligoclase (47% An). Albite has also been found in some samples with advanced secondary processes. Interstitions of these minerals contain clusters of grenades and pyroxenes, developed in a xenomorphic way. The diameter of the garnet blasts sometimes exceeds a few millimeters. Rutile and ilmenite occur in these minerals and their interactions. Orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes are represented by diopside and hypersthene (dominant). Some of these show anomalous wavy dimming of light and so-called crystallization shadows resulting from dynamic interactions.\n\nIn the area of the shores of the White Sea, dikes of ultramafic alkaline rocks are exposed. These are plagio-nepheline-bronzite olivine. The background of the rock is formed by olivine, the anhedral crystals of which are in contact with each other (Fig. 6I). In the vicinity of these minerals, serpentinization zones are visible, sometimes emphasized by the presence of small magnetite crystals. Together with olivine, the rock also contains bronzite, which forms much larger crystals. Apart from these minerals, small crystals of nepheline and apatite are noticeable. These are accompanied by single crystals of plagioclase and are strongly deformed. In addition, small amounts of carbonates are present in this rock.\n\nIn the Kolvitza plateau region, small bodies of intrusions made of meta-gabbroid with olivine meta-websterites are exposed (Fig. 6J and K). These are rocks in which the background is formed by large orthopyroxene crystals usually of anhedral shape. Next to this mineral, clinopyroxene is visible in the rock, usually polysynthetically approximated. Between them, there are single crystals of strongly corroded olivine, surrounded by crowns made of phlogopite and magnetite. Phlogopite also appears in the form of fusions in the orthopyroxene. Next to these minerals, common hornblende is visible in the rock. These rocks are accompanied by ilmenite-magnetite ores and sulfides represented by pentlandite and pyrrhotite, and platinum mineralization represented by such minerals as zvyagintsevite, insizwaite, and sobolevskite, which is accompanied by hessite (Voytehovsky et al. 2015).\n\nIn the further vicinity of these rocks, kimberlites also occur (Fig. 6L). These are augite-phlogopite rocks. The background of the rock is filled with femic minerals forming a post-mycilitic structure in the discussed rock and occurring in the form of breccia. Usually, augite (augite and aegirine) can be seen, which is surrounded, and sometimes replaced completely by phlogopite. Crystals of calcite forming similar inclusions are evident next to these minerals. The rock background is composed of breccia of crushed femur minerals, between which nepheline, prehnite, and plagioclase can be noticed. Small ore crystals (magnetite) are also present in the rock. In some varieties, there are post-olivine miaroles filled by chalcedony. Diamonds can be found in these kimberlites.\n\nThe metavulcanites found in the Kandalaksha region were established as 2.4–2.7 Ga years old (Barbey et al. 1984); Bridguoter et al. 1999; Huber et al. 2013). Their protolith was extrusion-lava compositions of today’s andesites and basalts (Huber 2001; Kozlov et al. 1995; Mints et al. 1999). In the Kandalaksha area, four complexes were added, one on top of the other. Within these rocks, there are small intrusive bodies of gabbroid and anorthosites, the age of which is 2.47–2.45 Ga (Bayanova et al. 2002). The large known intrusions of gabbro-anorthosite rocks, like the discussed gabbro-anorthosites of the Kolvitsa region (Fig.6E), were set at 2.452 + 7 Ga (Mitrofanov 2000; Pozhilienko et al. 2002), while the highest degree of metamorphism was determined for a time interval of 1.9–1.94 Ga (Mints et al. (Mints et al. 1999, Huangshan Geopark in China) and it is also associated with the emergence of Charnockite intrusions formed from the rendered leucocratic phases of rocks subjected to the greatest degree of metamorphism. The age of this has been determined to be 2.0 Ga (Bayanova et al. 2002). The much younger intrusive works located within the rocks of the Lapland Granulite Belt are the result of intrusions of the granitoid of the Yuvoaivinsky and Umba massif. These are estimated to be 1.8 Ga years old (Pozhilienko et al. 2002; Bea et al. 2001) (Fig.5G).\n\nThe youngest rocks found in the vicinity of the discussed deposits are numerous small deposits related to the impact of Paleozoic alkaline magmatism forming veins, dikes. and small igneous bodies within and adjacent to the rocks in question, as well as throughout the region of the Kola region. Among them, there are numerous prehnite-albite-calcite and tremolite-biotite-scaling veins (Fig. 6H). Research by Bayanova (Bayanova et al. 2002) determined the kimberlites found in this area (in Kola and Arkhangelsk) to be about 465 million years old (Arzamastsev et al. 2006; Britvin et al. 1995; Huber et al. 2007). These materials are already included in the alkaline formations, which in the space of 0.1 Ga created several intrusions in the Kola region (Arzamastsev et al. 2006; Britvin et al. 1995; Huber et al. 2007). In the Kandalaksha region, the rocks of this unit are a shelled tectonically mixed fragment of the structures discussed, which as a result of various geological processes, has been significantly shortened (covering an area about 10 times smaller than the rocks located in the eastern region of the Kola Peninsula (Huber 2014; Kozlov 1990).\n\nThe youngest geological formations in the region are the formations of Pleistocene glaciation, formed during the sculpting of these mountains by the ice sheet and then by mountain glaciers in the valleys. Numerous glaciers and U-shaped valleys were formed at this time. In the Holocene, as a result of the isostatic uplift of Scandinavia, the seashores retreated. This resulted in fossil bottom deposits in the valleys. In the present time, numerous screes, colluviums and blocky and weathered rocks have been formed due to ongoing weathering processes (Korsakova 2009; Jamorska et al. 2020).\n\nGeomorphology of the Kandalaksha Region\n\nThese hills have a relatively high relative height because they are close to the White Sea. However, they are isolated, with sharp steep slopes and deeply intersecting U-shaped valleys (Aleksandrova et al. 2014; Korsakova 2009; Korsakova et al. 2008; Molodkov and Yevzerov 2004; Grøsfjeld et al. 2006; Pękala 1998). In a further perspective, they form bands with a multi-stage culmination and are also visible in the north-eastern region of the discussed Kandalaksha region, as well as in the north Kolvitza Peninsula. Due to glaciation, the area was covered by an ice sheet. This can be seen in the form of large smoothings in the region of the mountain necks. Small ponds and raised bogs were sometimes formed in these zones. Moreover, numerous stone runes made of sharp-edged rock fragments are visible in their slopes. Below them are strongly sharpened valleys of glacial character. The bottom zones of these valleys in the early Holocene were sea bays, as evidenced by the sediments found there and the fossil seashore (Korsakova 2009, 2021). Currently, due to uplift of an isostatic nature, small streams, marshes, and rock blocks of various sizes are visible in them. Various postglacial deposits are evident and are sometimes exploited for local needs (markers, gravels). Some of these blocks are erratic, made of different rocks than those found in the field, and are found both in the peak zones and in the valleys (Lunkka et al. 2018; Zaretskaya et al. 2021). These formations can also be exposed when planning hiking trails as they serve to exemplify the youngest history of the area in question.\n\nTouristic Infrastructure\n\nThe discussed area has a lot of tourist and heritage values that should be properly exposed and protected. At present, the lack of infrastructure is noticeable. The trails are unmarked, trodden by tourists “spontaneously.” In the area of Volosianaya Mountain, a network of hotel cottages for rent is being built, which is a private initiative. In turn, on the top of Krestovaya Mountain, there is a chairlift and a TV tower. The “Babylon” labyrinth near Kandalaksha is relatively well protected, but the access road to it is unmarked. This situation negatively affects the environment, because the stream of tourists is not subject to any control. On the other hand, this state of affairs makes it difficult to gain acquaintance with the richness of the area. At the moment, the most important issue is to mark out potential trails and to build information placards enabling the tourists to read information regarding the objects they pass. In a more economical variant, we can use poles with QR codes, which will give a link with links on the Internet portal (Kavčič and Peljhan 2010; Koizumi and Chakraborty 2016; Cayla 2014). On the portal in different languages, information can be placed about the objects that have been marked in this way. These codes can also be positioned on plaques or directly on the rocks.\n\nAnother important factor is the placement of small infrastructure such as bridges, steps, and handrails in difficult locations (Piranha et al. 2011; Gravis et al. 2020; Sinnyovsky et al. 2020). Allowing hikers to enjoy the views from platforms positioned on the mountaintops is another important point. The view of the Kandalaksha Riviera from the peaks, watching the distant lights of trains running in the evening, or ships sailing on the sea, gives a unique impression. In such places, it is also worth building shelters that will allow tourists to rest, prepare dinner, etc.\n\nAccess to the islands is possible only by sea. This route can also take the visitor to Kolvitza and further on to Umba. The possibility to admire the coast and the mountains from the sea will widen the range of available attractions. The tourist will be able to observe birds and animals such as the seals that often choose the beaches of the islands and the Kolvitza area to lie in the sun.\n\nThe opportunity to observe the waterfall in the Kolvitza area should be made available via a marked trail with a specific approach so as not to damage the unstable sandy ground along the river banks.\n\nAn important element of the proposed infrastructure is its monitoring, which would enable tourists to check the conditions in the terrain, plan their route, and prepare themselves accordingly. Monitoring would also help to observe tourist traffic and to provide help in difficult situations, as well as to protect existing objects against vandalism. An important element should be the possibility of contacting the help services. This currently exists to a limited extent in the hills because of cell phone coverage, while in the valleys, there is no communication. The situation is even worse in the Kolvitza area, where the remoteness from Kandalaksha makes the phone coverage weak even in the villages and to disappear completely outside it.\n\nAn interesting proposal is the construction of several platforms directly on the seacoast, allowing the observation of tides that reach up to 1 m, as well as the vegetation of the littoral zone. Such platforms could also be built in scenic places in the mountains on the shores of lakes, in some valleys to allow observation of unique vegetation and the glaciers. The slopes of the valleys could be made accessible to more physically fit visitors to acquaint them with the exposed rock formations. Such access requires the use of ladders, chains, and appropriate information about the difficulty of the route. In the further future, it would be important to build a geocenter and a tourist shelter so as to allow tourists to rest and have a meal. The fact that such facilities are needed is confirmed by private initiatives to build various guesthouses in the area. It is important to coordinate these efforts by maintaining a tourist portal, which would enable efficient tourist navigation around available facilities, as well as planning of the route.\n\nThe proposed route is divided into several sections. The main trail (green) runs from Kandalaksha village to Kolvitsa, through the Kandalaksha and Luvieng mountains. These places can be bypassed (blue trail) or the hike can be extended to include Siennaya Kurtiazhnaya and Sredny Mys peaks (red trail). This trail has an approximate length of 40 km and can be hiked over several days or in stages. The second proposal is to follow the blue route towards the coast of the White Sea and the islands of the White Sea, which can be done also by car or train (the black line in Fig. 8). The approximate length of the trail (blue on the map) is about 20 km. The tourist traffic on the islands is strictly regulated as they are strongly protected due to their marine birds and fauna (strict reserve) (Korsakova 2009). The islands can also be reached directly from Kandalaksha. These routes are described below along with points of interest. In Table1 (below), the geographical details of the Sites in question are given. Table 2 and Fig. 9 show the values of the sites. Geo-touristic values such as interesting rock outcrops, geomorphological formations, and possible panoramic views dominate. Next to these are values connected with interesting vegetation, less often there are values connected with tourist infrastructure and historical objects. However, even though there are relatively few historical values, they are very important, as they concern the archeological monuments of indigenous peoples and examples of urbanization — the location of early Russian colonizers from the thirteenth century. This area, due to the multitude of various objects, including examples of geological and geomorphological forms, is unique and unrepeatable. The individual sites are discussed below and approximate walking times to the individual sites are given (Table 3).\n\nCharacteristic of the Sites\n\nSite 1: Kandalaksha\n\nThe city of Kandlaksha is situated in the south of the Kola Peninsula on the White Sea (object #1, Fig. 8, Tables 1 and 2), and it has important international road and rail connections. Due to this fact, there are factories connected with railway rolling stock reconstruction and port development that are situated on the shore of the White Sea. This city is historically connected with the sea — which in the old days was the only transport and communication link of this region to the outer world. Archeological research shows that in the near distance of the city, there are stone labyrinths of the Stone Age. There is also a close documented ethnographic link between the Kandalaksha and the Karels who inhabited the city and nearby Kolvitza.\n\nThe settlement has existed since the eleventh century. In the thirteenth century (Aleksandrova and Ekaterina Aigina 2014; Garkotin 2013, Murmansk Visitor Center, History of the Kola Territory), it was attached to the Republic of Novgorod, and since the fifteenth century, to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The first church was erected here in 1526. At that time, the main connections of the city to the outer world took place by sea from Archangelsk and further along the coast of the Baltic Sea, where towns such as Umba, Varzuga, and others were established. This situation changed at the beginning of the twentieth century when a railway line connecting Murmansk with St. Petersburg was built, which runs in the neighborhood of the city. This has contributed to the development of its industry, which is mainly focused on railway maintenance and logistics, port logistics, and the processing of non-ferrous metals (mainly aluminum). Kandalaksha was granted city rights in 1938 and now has nearly fifty thousand inhabitants (Garkotin 2013).\n\nSite 2: Niva River\n\nAs of 1938, the city has been administratively attached to Murmansk District (formerly within the borders of the Republic of Karelia). It is also worth noting that in 1934, on the Niva River, the first hydroelectric power plant was built on the Niva. The city center is noted for its wooden houses. These are accompanied by neoclassic style brick buildings, which are located along the main arteries of the city. Much of the city’s architecture, however, consists of apartment blocks built in the Soviet style. There are also some investments started in the twenty-first century, though their quantity is small (Table 3).\n\nAfter leaving Kandalaksha and crossing the road (towards Umba), one passes a bridge over the Niva river. This geographically constitutes the border of the Kola peninsula from Lapland located to the west. In the bottom of this river, one can also conventionally assume the tectonic boundary of the structure of the Lapland Belt, which in this area is exposed in a condensed, flakey way. Descending towards the seashore, you can see glacial outcrops, zones of isostatic relaxation, and the modern seashore with a visible tidal belt (purple trail branch, object #2).\n\nSite 3: Stone Labyrinth\n\nThis structure is located on the tip of a small peninsula, periodically cut off from the mainland by the sea at high tide. In this place, there is an archeological reserve in which the ancient stone labyrinth “Babylon” is placed. It is the work of the indigenous Sami people who inhabited the area, probably about 2000 years ago (Fig. 10D) (Murmansk Visitor Center, History of the Kola Territory). In the Kola area, there are more such objects of archeological interest such as the seids and rock petroglyphs. However, most of these objects are far from towns and access to them is very difficult. In this case, it is relatively easy to approach and see the labyrinth (orange branch, object #3) (Korsakova et al., 2008).\n\nSite 4: Road Ditch\n\nFurther along the road, about 10 km from the town, between the Kriestovaya and Volosianaya mountains, there is a pass in which a road ditch was made. In the walls of this ditch, which reach up to 10 m in places, amphibolites with garnets belonging to the Lapland Kola Granulite Belt (object #4) are exposed. They contain lenses of quartz and breccias filled with carbonatite material that show different stages of the formation of the discussed area, from base deposition, through their metamorphism and later reworking through tectonic processes and vein filling in the Paleozoic. In this place, there is also a nice view both to the east over the White Sea bay, numerous islands and Kolvitza peninsula in the distance, and to the west over the city of Kandalaksha.\n\nSite 5: Volovianaya\n\nOn climbing the Volosianaya mountain massif (475 m above sea level, object #5), one can admire the panorama of the town from the nearby ski slope on the hill located in the extreme south that meets the sea. In the summit parts, there are also some rocky outcrops forming picturesque objects. There are “sieids” — large boulders located on smaller ones. These are connected the legend that they were built by indigenous peoples as so-called “Stones of Power” (Fig. 10D). These objects are scattered all over the Kola Peninsula and some can weigh even several tons. It is not excluded that some of them may have been created by human action (several cases of the creation of such blocks in the twentienth century for tourist purposes are known, these can usually be found by the side of a road or a hotel). Mostly, though, they have arisen naturally and been objects of veneration. Regardless of the genesis of their creation, they are picturesque objects and are usually found on the slopes of mountains. In the Volosianaya area, there are also two small ponds between which there is a narrow isthmus (probably allowing water to flow between the rocks). A small hostel-like house has recently been set up nearby, which can be rented for a night. This has a panoramic view of the town and the Kandalaksha Gulf of the White Sea.\n\nSite 6: Zhieleznaya 1\n\nOn the northern side, the Volosianaya Massif is cut by a deep U-shaped valley with glaciers on both sides of the valley (Fig. 10C). In the slopes of the Zhieleznaya massif lying to the north, rock cliffs with faults are visible. These form walls 1000–200 m high. In the bottom of the valleys, colluviums and blocks, partly overgrown, and deposits of the fossil seashore are visible (object #6). It is easy to get there by descending the western gentle slopes of the mountains.\n\nSite 7: Zhieleznaya 2\n\nFurther on, the culmination of the Zhieleznaya massif is exposed (575 m above sea level for the southern culmination and 591 m above sea level for the northern culmination) having the form of a cleft (object #7). Massive amphibolites and quartz-amphibole-feldspar crystalline schists — sometimes with biotite — form a metamorphosed complex of extrusive and lava rocks occur there. Among them, in the break in the massif, one can see granites (metamorphosed snatches, volcanic bombs) and a small patch of gabbro-anorthosite, with mantle xenoliths now metamorphosed in the form of eclogites (strongly amphibolitized, object #7). The entire rock complex is intersected by veins of quartz, granitoid, and carbonatite composition of various ages. In the upper parts of the massif, there are also local depressions with raised bogs and small ponds. From the summits, the entire panorama of the Kandalaksha Mountains, the city and the White Sea can be enjoyed (Fig. 10A).\n\nSite 8: Zhieleznaya 3\n\nThe northern culmination of this massif again reveals interesting panoramic views of the Kandalaksha Mountains, the city, and the White Sea. In addition, below the mountain — to the northeast — one can see in the valley the crumb formations exploited in the nearby gravel pit (object #8). There is also a link (orange) to the red trail, which can be used to return from the north along an unpaved road through the forest to the town of Kandalaksha (see object #11 below).\n\nSite 9: Siennaya Kurtiazhnaya and Sriednyi Mys\n\nHeading in the northeast direction, another mountain massif begins. This has two culminations: Siennaya Kurtiazhnaya to the west (609 m) and Sriednyi Mys (571 m) to the northeast. Both are composed of granulites of the Lapland Granulite Belt (object #9). These form relatively high hills and in the bends between them, ponds and high peat bogs can be seen. There are also numerous boulder fields and moss-lichen tundra in their upper parts. Due to the location of these hills to the north of Kandalaksha Mountain, there is a view of all the above-mentioned peaks and the White Sea to the south. In good weather, the Khibiny Mountains, the highest mountain range on the Kola Peninsula, can be seen towards the north. Below the peaks, the tundra changes into forest-tundra and then into spruce-pine forest as the altitude decreases. In these parts of the mountains, one can find several hundred-year-old trees standing out against the background of the stand, as well as numerous examples of fauna, including brown bears.\n\nSite 10: Sriedneluviengskoe Lake\n\nFurther north towards Lake Sriedneluviengskoe, there is a zone of tulip-shaped tectonic boundary faults, forming numerous gullies, sometimes muddy (object #9, Fig. 10F). Metamorphosed mylonites can also be seen there. There is a sandy road by the lakeshore which one can, by following the red trail, go straight to the suburban railroad station and Kandalaksha (see object #1). Turning south through the massif of Luvienga mountains (652 m), one can enjoy a panorama of numerous hills and the islands on the White Sea. The whole route ends in Luvienga village, which can be reached by bus from Kandalaksha. The character of the mountains in question is a range of shear and fault-crossed rock scales of varying thickness. They constitute the cumulative character of the Lapland Granulite Belt. In admiring the view of the White Sea, one can see in the scissor-like closing bay, the aulacogene that fills the basin of this bay, together with the collision hills occurring from the side of Kandalaksha and further framing this bay from the south in Karelia. This whole is included in the Kola-Lapland Mobile Belt stretching from the far north (Pechenga area), through Kandalaksha to Karelia (in the south).\n\nSite 11: Post-1176 Railway Station\n\nGoing from Kandalaksha towards the north, you can find a small station where suburban trains stop. This is a branch line coming off the St. Petersburg–Murmansk mainline. From the station, an earth road runs parallel to the northern asphalt road Kandalaksha-Umba. This road allows passing Kandalaksha Mountains from the north (red trail in Fig. 8) to climb up to the Zhieleznaya Mountain (object #8) or to proceed from the side of the Sreidneluviengskoe Lake (object #10) to the Sennaya Kurtiazhnaya and Sredny Myss Mountains (object #9). The road is picturesquely located at the foot of these mountains, and it stretches in the tectonic zone of folds and faults discussed at object #10 among the pine and spruce forest, between the streams. It is an easy road to traverse, but because of the remoteness and wild animals, it is better to take it in a larger group. The train station located at the beginning of this road does not have its own ticket office. This must be taken into account when planning the return trip, as trains there usually stop 1–2 times per day. However, it is located about 5 km from the main station of Kandalaksha and this section can be covered on foot or by using public transport.\n\nSite 12: Luvienga\n\nLuvienga is a small village with the character of an estate of a few multi-family houses. The village has a nodal character as busses on the Kandalaksha-Kolvitza-Ubma route stop here and there is also a grocery store. Therefore, it can be a transfer point en route for further trekking.\n\nSite 13: Ultrabasic — Alkaline Rock Intrusion\n\nSlightly further east of the village of Luvienga, on the shores of the White Sea, alkaline and ultramafic alkaline rocks can be observed. These form small intrusive bodies in the area in question (red branch of the trail, object #10). Their exposures are not described by roadside marker and one has to use GPS data to find the path. However, upon stopping at this place, after walking several dozen meters down towards the sea, one can see much darker rocks in comparison with the amphibolites, which are seen as weathering forms protruding from the ground surface. Next to these rocks is a beautiful view of the Kolvitza Bay of the White Sea and the towering hills of this peninsula, which at this point is only less than a kilometer from the shore (Fig. 10B).\n\nSite 14: Kolvitza\n\nContinuing along the road, we come to the village of Kolvitza. Kolvitza, as well as Kandalaksha, has a long history dating back to the thirteenth century. This is immortalized on the obelisk in the town square (Fig. 9H). The village architecture is dominated by wooden houses, just like many centuries before. The urbanization of the village and the picturesque views that stretch from this place are also a monument. Kolvitza is where Kandalaksha residents have their summer homes due to the north winds being blocked the Kolvitza hills. This is also the place where most bus routes terminate. You can also shop in the local store and continue your sightseeing by heading towards the Kolvitza River or the Kruglaya massif hills.\n\nSite 15: Kolvitza Waterfall\n\nAt a distance of about 1 km, east of the city is a waterfall on the Kolvitza River. This river originates in Lake Kolvitza, which collects water from the nearby hills and was a bay of the White Sea at the beginning of the Holocene. Because of the differences in elevation and the size of the lake, the river tends to have a fairly abundant flow. Encountering rocky thresholds in the vicinity of the village, it falls noisily in several cascades, the highest of them forming a waterfall reaching 5 m in height (red branch, object #12, Fig. 10E). It should be noted that the whole route towards the waterfall is very picturesque, as the path follows the riverbank in a pine and spruce forest. However, it is a relatively poorly organized route without any tourist infrastructure (bridges, handrails, toilets), which, unfortunately, at the moment is not very positive for tourists, who in this region in summer are usually much more numerous than in other places described above due to the relatively easy access of attractions.\n\nSite 16: Kruglaya\n\nWalking from the village of Kolvitza in the southern direction, you can ascend the Kolvice Mountains. These are made up of metamorphosed gabbro-anorthosite rocks that also contain titanium, iron, and platinum oxide bodies. The approach is steep in places, with numerous rock folds, thresholds, and small stream waterfalls, but from the top of Kruglaya Mountain (636 m), one can enjoy the beautiful view of the Kolvitsa peninsula, as well as Kandalaksha and the nearby hills passed earlier (object #13). In the zone of this peninsula, the rocks are metamorphosed into amphibolite and even granulite facies.\n\nSite 17: Beloe More Railway Station\n\nThe second proposed trail goes towards several islands in the White Sea; in following it, you can enjoy the panorama of Kandalaksha mountains and the Kolvitz oasis. These objects are visible against the background of the numerous sea islands in this area. The road leads through a pine and spruce forest. This station can be a junction from where you can start the next stage of your tour and you can stock up on products there, as there is a small estate of houses in the vicinity of the station. The Beloe More train station is a small facility that is served by suburban trains. In walking from this station towards the sea, one can come across pools of healing clays in the local swamps. Unfortunately, some of these sites are devastated due to uncontrolled tourist traffic and littering.\n\nSite 18: Telachiy Island\n\nTelachy Island, located within Kandalaksha Bay, is part of the Kandalaksha Reserve, which protects the breeding zones of seabirds. Access to this island can be arranged from Beloe More or directly from Kandalaksha. This island is smaller than the neighboring island, but it has a variety of gabbro-anorthosite rocks, alkaline, and other metamorphic rocks. These islands also offer nice views of Kandalaksha and the surrounding mountains.\n\nSite 19: Oleniy Island\n\nThis island is several times larger than Telachiy, having several small lakes and rock outcrops with interesting formations (described in object #18). Along with observing the rocks on the islands, one can also watch numerous birds nesting in the area. This island, as well as the neighboring island, can only be reached by boat, which can be rented in Beloe More or Kandalaksha."
