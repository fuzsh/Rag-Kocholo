Foreword 6. Dedicated to the memory of Soviet submariners Who died in peacetime 7. Many gaps in the history of the Soviet Navy, above all of the submarine fleet, have been and still are a sealed book. Behind these gaps are hidden not only blunders of the command element and of our designers, but also the courage and heroism of seamen who overcame all difficulties which arose for them along the paths of mastering and operating diesel and nuclear powered submarines. 8. To this day many in the fleets, especially the young generation, do not know the details of the first accidents and the number of submariners who have APPROVED FOR RELEASE CIA HISTORICAL RELEASE PROGRAM JUNE 2017 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union [HSU] in postwar times, or for what this title was conferred. (All this was hidden by secret orders and by classified edicts of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium.) 9. Lately the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK has lifted the curtain somewhat over individual tragic events by publishing memoirs about the raising of the submarine S-80 and the accident on the missile-armed submarine K-19. These articles about 30-year-old events generated lively interest among readers. 10. But there are burial places of deceased submariners in the fleets about which not everyone knows. The fact is there are seven such sacred places in the Northern Fleet alone. People come to these monuments on major holidays, but in winter they are covered by snow. 11. A memorial complex dedicated to the memory of deceased submariners was erected in November 1991 in the garrison from which the nuclear powered submarine \"Komsomolets\" departed on her last deployment. It rises majestically above the city which is the cradle of the Soviet nuclear powered fleet, and it became not simply another sight to see, but a reminder of the greatness, strength of spirit, courage and heroism of seamen who performed their military duty to the end. 12. The digest \"Po sledam podvodnykh katastrof\" is the first endeavor to throw light upon the tragic events which occurred in the Navy. 13. To Avoid Catastrophes, by Rear Admiral (Reserve) G. Kostev and Captain 1st Rank I. Kostev, candidate of naval sciences, professor 14. Just what occurred in far-off 1956? That was a time of searching for a new submarine engine. The first nuclear powered submarine was just being built and submarines with a power plant capable of supporting lengthy underwater operation were being tested in parallel, but its design potentially was a fire and explosion hazard. This is why these submarines unofficially were called \"cigarette lighters\" in the Navy. Liquid oxygen was used on them to support the diesel's underwater operation. 15. One was commanded by Captain 3rd Rank Yu. Vavakin. As was the case with the \"Komsomolets,\" there was a senior commander aboard in addition to Vavakin on that tragic day when the submarine sank in the Baltic. A fire which broke out in the power plant compartment was the primary cause of the catastrophe. The submarine immediately came up to a surface condition and personnel were moved up on deck, since specialists believed a power plant explosion was likely. Five hours after the fire began the submarine suddenly lost longitudinal stability and in a matter of seconds went under with a large trim by the stern. People ended up in waves of a stormy sea. Only seven persons managed to be saved because of the stormy weather. An analysis showed the submarine sank because water entered the pressure hull as a result of its loss of seal because of the fire, but no explosion followed. Subsequently some accused the crew of passiveness and others believed that creation of such a power plant was ahead of its time and so the personnel were not sufficiently ready to service such sophisticated equipment.

Why Compartments Burn, by Rear Admiral (Reserve) G. Kostev and Captain 1st Rank I. Kostev, professor, deputy commander of submarine formation 22. The first Soviet nuclear powered submarine, \"Leninskiy komsomol,\" was only being built. Diesel submarines with engines capable of supporting fast, lengthy underwater movement were being tested in parallel. Among them also was an M-Class (\"Malyutka\") submarine of a new design. Liquid oxygen was used on her for underwater diesel operation and a considerable store of liquid oxygen was aboard in a special tank. A second \"Malyutka\" commanded by Captain 3rd Rank Vavakin put to sea to test the new power plant. Suddenly a fire started in the power plant compartment and the submarine came up to a surface condition. What could be the consequences of a fire, considering the presence of a large mass of liquid oxygen aboard ship and the novelty of the engine installation? Submariners considered an explosion to be the most probable. Most likely this is what can explain a certain passiveness of the crew in submarine damage control: main efforts were concentrated on saving the personnel. Nevertheless a fatal outcome was not avoided. 23. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 15 February 1991 24. From Underwater Captivity, by Colonel (Retired) E. Leybovich, former chief of Black Sea Fleet Search and Rescue Service 25. On 22 August 1957 a Black Sea Fleet submarine arrived in a combat training area and received the okay to submerge, but did not surface at the appointed time (1700 hours). A general alarm was announced in the Fleet. Just what happened? 26. After receiving the report on closure of the flap valve supplying air to the diesels, submarine commander Captain 3rd Rank R. Belozerov gave the command \"Quick dive,\" but this commonplace command led to an accident. 27. The trunk closure signal, which was imperfect in its design, deceived the commander. Water gushed into the sixth diesel compartment through the not fully closed flap valve. The submarine fell swiftly into the marine abyss and several minutes later her stern went deep into the sandy bottom at a 60? angle. 28. Water from the half-flooded sixth compartment seeped into the seventh Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 after compartment through a damaged bulkhead and fire broke out in the seventh from a power panel short circuit. Seventh compartment was de-energized to stop the fire. Sixth compartment was two-thirds flooded, and the sea continued to gush into the submarine. The entry of water managed to be checked only two hours later. People from the end compartments were received by comrades in fifth compartment through flooded hatches. 29. The situation analysis was summed up in the control room: 40 tonnes of water had been received in the after compartments and was impossible to pump out with a trim of 600, submergence depth was near maximum, breathing equipment was sufficient for 70 hours and food for two days, and there was no confirmation about the emergency signal buoy surfacing. 30. The commander made the following decision: try to reduce trim by the stern and then pump out the water. Everyone including officers got into single file and passed buckets and cans of water from hand to hand from after to forward compartments. The heavy work caused increased oxygen intake. People were losing consciousness, but the chain still functioned. Twelve tonnes of water were transferred to a height of 35-40 m, all possible loads were taken and moved to forward compartments, but the trim did not decrease- the bottom firmly held the submarine's stern. 31. Captain 1st Rank N. Smirnov, commander of Black Sea Fleet Submarine Forces, was first to arrive in the area of the submarine accident. The commander of the submarine in distress briefly reported what happened to his flag officer by underwater sound communication. Telephone communication with rescue ships which had arrived also was established via the emergency buoy, which, as it turned out, had surfaced after all. 32. CinC Black Sea Fleet Admiral V. Kasatonov exercised overall direction of the rescue operation. Captain 1st Rank N. Chiker, a USSR State Prize laureate and a founder of the Rescue Service, headed up the submarine's immediate rescue. 33. It was decided to pass a reliable line under the submarine's forebody, wrest her from the bottom by the pull of tugboats, and supply high-pressure air for blowing the main ballast tanks, after which the submarine would be able to surface on her own. 34. The main burden in saving the submarine rested on the divers' shoulders. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA told about their courage and heroism in January 1958 in connection with publication of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium Edict \"On Awarding Orders and Medals\" to Captain 2nd Rank P. Nikolskiy; warrant officers M. Karagayev, A. lvlev, F. Kremlyakov, N. Litvinov, D. Karpayev and B. Masnev; and petty officers P. Shlyakhetko, Yu. Baranov and V. Stopkin. 35. Air supply and suction hoses were passed to the submarine. Warm underwear, wine, chocolate and canned food were transferred through the torpedo tubes in special containers. The submariners themselves also continued to struggle for life-they made fast property, checked hatch seals, and removed ammunition and combustible materials to safe places. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 36. Stormy weather broke up the rescuers' plans and made unforeseen corrections to them. A capron line which snapped broke the leg of Captain 2nd Rank Anisimov, one of the most experienced divers, and several divers got decompression sickness. A break in the emergency buoy cable deprived them of two-way communications with the submarine. Problems which were arising in the course of rescue operations were reported to Marshal of the Soviet Union G. K. Zhukov, and large combatant ships of the Navy were sent out. They used their hulls to damp waves around the rescue ship \"Beshtau,\" from which rescue operations were being conducted. 37. Captain 2nd Rank P. Nikolskiy went down, as it was necessary to fasten a tow line. The capron line broke during towing in battering waves. Then, despite fatigue after the previous dive, Nikolskiy again went down and attached a steel tow line. 38. It was the night of 25/26 August. There was combat readiness above and beneath the water. A tugboat slowly took up the slack and the submarine's trim decreased under tow line tension. Minutes stretched out for a painfully long time between reports from the submarine: \"Pump took up water...\", \"...sixth and seventh almost fully drained...\", \"...personnel taking places for special emergency surfacing...\", \"...blowing main ballast tanks...\" 39. At 0230 hours on 26 August the surface of the sea seethed in the beams of ship searchlights, releasing the submarine and her crew from underwater captivity. In the morning the submarine was towed to base, where the submariners were greeted as victors with the traditional roast pig. 40. Photo captions 41. Monument to submariners who died on 11 January 1962, Polyarnyy 42. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 1 September 1990 43. Forgotten Explosion, written from the words of Captain 1st Rank N. Styulkevich, eyewitness to the tragedy, now submarine formation radiotechnical service flag officer 44. The crew of the diesel submarine B-37 (commander Captain 2nd Rank Begeba, executive officer Captain 3rd Rank Simonyan) was preparing for a lengthy cruise. 45. On 11 January 1962, after completing the naval ritual of hoisting the naval ensign aboard the submarine, the crew executed the command \"Begin jacking over weapons and technical equipment on power\" as usual. It seemed nothing portended tragedy, but at 0822 hours there was an explosion aboard ship, the reasons for which still have not been clarified. Although the commission for investigating reasons for the tragedy did work and make a certain finding, no one has returned to that tragedy for the last 30 years and nowhere has material on it been published in the open press. There were different versions. 46. One is as follows: a torpedo was mechanically damaged while ammunition Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 was being loaded aboard the submarine, and the torpedo caught fire during welding work in first compartment. A large-volume fire in the compartment a minute before the explosion was most likely. As a result of the explosion the submarine was completely demolished through the forward bulkhead of third compartment and sank practically instantaneously. The S-350 standing nearby received damage to her pressure hull, first and second compartments were flooded, and she was subsequently towed to a shoal and the compartments drained. Everyone on the dock, aboard the submarine, and at the torpedo-technical base (a total of 122 persons) died as a result of the explosion. The dead were buried at a cemetery in Polyarnyy. 47. NA STRAZHE ZAPOLYARYA, 6 January 1991 48. Raised from the Depth 49. One of the first diesel powered missile submarines sank on a combat training range in the Barents Sea north of Rybachiy Peninsula in February 1961. She was the lead submarine of this design. Design deficiencies of machinery supporting the submarine's submerged operation on diesels became the primary cause of the crew's death. More precisely, a control valve of the sensor of the presence of water in the air duct proved to be closed. It was learned later that miscalculations also were made by the personnel in the emergency situation. None of the submarine crew headed by Captain 3rd Rank M. Sitarchik remained alive. Captain 3rd Rank A. Nikolayev, second-crew commander who was aboard, also died. 50. HSU Vice Admiral A. Petelin, who took part in the search for the sunken submarine and who descended in a bathyscaphe, discovered that the submarine was on an even keel and determined the possibilities of raising her. She was raised in 1969 and towed to an inlet. The state commission for investigating reasons for the submarine's loss was headed by Marshal of the Soviet Union K. Rokossovskiy. After familiarizing himself with the work of submariners, the outstanding military leader did not agree with those who tried to place all the blame on the navymen. His suppositions were confirmed eight years later when the operation to raise the ship was successfully carried out. In those years the submariners' tragedy did not become public property. 51. Only 30 years later did KRASNAYA ZVEZDA include a small note about the accident and a photograph of the submarine. 52. A modest obelisk was placed on the grave in Olenya Inlet in which crew members' remains lie. Seamen come to it before going on a lengthy cruise, and flowers are placed on it on holidays and on the anniversary of the day the submarine sank. 53. Photo captions 54. After an eight-year stay beneath the water. 24 June 1969 55. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 6 September 1990 56. How the S-80 Sank, by Senior Warrant Officer V. Kazanov Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 57. A monument stands in a remote garrison, modest and unassuming. It is apparent that it was made by a seaman who was a skilled craftsman. There is a mournful row of names on tombstones. 58. \"In eternal memory of submariners of the crew of the submarine S-80 who died in line of duty,\" goes the inscription on the stele. What lies behind these words? Only now has it become possible to reveal the secret of the S-80's loss. 59. It was January 1961. The S-80, which had departed for the range to rehearse combat training missions, did not come up in communications at the appointed time. A search did not produce the desired result. The state commission which worked under the direction of USSR Ministry of Defense Chief Inspector Marshal of the Soviet Union K. Rokossovskiy just was unable to learn the reasons for the submarine's loss. 60. But work of searching for the S-80 did not stop. Help unexpectedly came from fishermen, who reported that some kind of underwater object had been discovered in a fishery area. 61. A check showed that in fact a metallic object was located at a great depth and corresponded to a submarine in all parameters. 62. Having descended beneath the water in a submersible vehicle in the summer of 1969, HSU First Deputy CinC Fleet Vice Admiral A. Petelin saw a picture which chilled the soul: picked up in a searchlight beam, a submarine lay on the bottom with fishing nets hanging on the conning tower. There was no doubt this was the S-80. 63. The S-80 managed to be snatched from underwater captivity on 25 July 1969. A sunken submarine was raised from a depth of almost 200 m for the first time in world practice. 64. Rear Admiral N. Chiker, chief of the Navy Salvage and Rescue Service, directed salvage operations, Engineer-Captain 1st Rank Yu. Senatskiy was chief engineer, and the expedition was headed by Captain 1st Rank S. Minchenko. 65. Rear Admiral Chiker had colossal experience in raising sunken ships. As a young beginning engineer he worked out the operation to raise the cruiser \"Oleg,\" sunk by the British in 1919. This was his first ship, but others later followed where Nikolay Petrovich Chiker's talent and deep technical thinking were revealed. 66. The operation to raise the S-80 was carefully conceived. Large forces of the Fleet Search and Rescue Service were involved. An entire group of engineers and designers became State Prize laureates for developing the device and everything new used in freeing the S-80 from underwater captivity. 67. A device resembling large tongs would go beneath the water from the salvage ship \"Karpaty\" and a diver would precisely lead it to the submarine, simultaneously performing the role of slinger. Having securely gripped the Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 cigar-shaped body of the S-Class sub, the \"tongs\" would wrest her from the bottom and then, dragging her closer to shore, salvagers would finally raise the submarine to the surface. After this the state commission headed by HSU Vice Admiral G. Shchedrin would be able to establish the true cause of the submarine's loss. 68. It was not by chance that the role of chairman was entrusted to Grigoriy Ivanovich. What was required above all was a specialist who knew submarines to the last rivet. Vice Admiral Shchedrin, who had gone through a stern school of submarine service in the Northern Fleet in the war years, was such a person. The S-56 which he commanded was decorated with the Order of Red Banner and became a Guards submarine on 23 February 1945. 69. Recently I phoned Grigoriy Ivanovich Shchedrin and asked him to recall events of 30 years ago. Here is what he related: 70. \"The S-80, which was commanded by Captain 3rd Rank Sitarchik, put to sea to rehearse missions. The presence aboard ship of a second commander, Captain 3rd Rank Nikolayev, enabled speaking about the presence of a second crew allegedly aboard the submarine. This was not so. 71. \"The tragedy occurred at 1420 hours on 27 January 1961. This submarine had a design feature: her snorkel mast was wider than on other S-Class subs. On that day the sea was stormy and there was a good little freeze. The S-80 was charging using the snorkel. Apparently waves were sweeping over the mast and ice froze on the upper cover. After having charged, the submarine submerged and the cover naturally did not close. Water gushed in. People in the control room could have stopped it, but there they made a mistake and instead of closing the cover, which was in third compartment, they opened it. Water rushed further into fifth compartment, where two seamen attempted to save the ship from disaster, but it was already too late. That is how we found them, together. I briefed the CinC Northern Fleet, CinC Navy and the CPSU Central Committee based on results of the commission's work. The tragedy showed once again that submariners have a very difficult profession which does not tolerate carelessness and lack of discipline. Everyone aboard a submarine is responsible for each other. This simple truth cannot be forgotten. We pointed out in the report that industry must be precise and accurate in a ship's specifications. There must be no vagueness here. From this comes something else as well. Military acceptance must be very demanding, for the personnel pay for every design deficiency. What happened to the S-80 was subjected to a thorough analysis at a technical conference with submariners in Polyarnyy, to which I traveled and where I spoke. 72. \"The submarine had to be blown up, since there were torpedoes in the torpedo tubes and no one knew how they would behave. 73. \"In my view it is necessary to elevate the submariner's professionalism and prestige. He must not appear to be in the role of one begging alms on the church porch. Believe me in this; after all, I spent many years in a pressure hull.' And what kind of years! When they pour depth charges on your head, when there is nothing to breathe and it is impossible to surface. We were helped in defeating the fascists by love for the Motherland and professionalism. Do not Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 lose these qualities. This is my wish for Northern Fleet navymen.\" 74. And so we managed to complete one more sad page of history. But not completely. Possibly one of the relatives of the deceased or veteran submariners will respond who will supplement the story about the crew of the S-80. 75. NA STRAZHE ZAPOLYARYA, 17 February 1990 76. And They Still Raised the Submarine: (From Notes of a Special Purpose Expedition Commander), by Captain 1st Rank (Retired) S. Minchenko 77. Several circumstances prompted me to take up the pen. 78. First of all, the natural change of generations involuntarily leads to loss of a portion of the experience gained by veterans. 79. Secondly, there are few who now know the features of the 1969 raising of a Northern Fleet diesel submarine which sank in the Barents Sea. At that time this was the first time in world ship-raising practice this operation was accomplished using deep-water apparatus and television cameras and without diving labor in working at a depth of around 200 m. For the first time in our Navy's history, a special unit of central subordination, a Special Purpose Expedition, was established to raise a submarine, and the author of these lines was entrusted with commanding it. 80. Thirdly, Rear Admiral N. Chiker, former chief of the Navy Salvage and Rescue Service, planned to describe the work of the Special Purpose Expedition in detail, but unfortunately did not have time to do so. 81. It must be noted that the Expedition functioned in a period when the Navy Salvage and Rescue Service had been consolidated with the Auxiliary Fleet. Such a union of organizations that were totally different in nature of missions accomplished and makeup could not be deemed proper. It apparently was explained by that reorganizing itch with which all our country's national economy was gripped at that time. This was understood both by Salvage and Rescue Service specialists as well as by the majority of heads of fleets, but it took an entire 15 years to revise an incorrect decision. 82. The submarine in question sank on a combat training range in January 1961. An intensive search for her lasted until fall. Up to 40-50 ships, vessels, aircraft and helicopters took part, but failed to find the submarine with the means then existing in the Navy. 83. As often happens, that tragedy accelerated the creation of more effective equipment for hunting and inspecting objects which have sunk at great depths. 84. 1965-1967. The fleet received test models of a special search sonar, underwater television unit, hydrographic echo sweep and towed magnetic metal detector. The new equipment underwent comprehensive tests, including in a test exercise to find a real submarine which had been specially bottomed at a depth of 220 m. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 85. It was confirmed in the exercise that the most effective means for detecting a submarine lying on the bottom at great depths were the sonar for hunting sunken objects mounted on a salvage vessel, and hydrographic echo sweeps and magnetic metal detectors towed by ocean minesweepers. 86. Reference recordings obtained on this gear's automatic recorders subsequently permitted competently analyzing contacts with underwater objects. 87. Finally a salvage vessel in the search area received a positive contact registered from five directions and then confirmed by ocean minesweepers. A comparison of recordings of the contact with reference recordings obtained in the test exercise left no doubt that a submarine was on the bottom. 88. Thus after mastery of new equipment and rehearsal of search methods, the sunken submarine was discovered and inspected in 1968 using a descent observation chamber from the salvage vessel \"Altay.\" Experienced divers and specialists Chief Petty Officer Zamoshchin, Petty Officer 1st Class Grigoryev, Petty Officer 1st Class Krasnokutskiy and Captain 3rd Rank Ivashchenko had to work under difficult, dangerous conditions during the inspection. They made a total of nine operator descents in the observation chamber, each lasting 2-4 hours. 89. As a result of the inspection they determined that the submarine which had been located was lying on the bottom with a 30-400 list with no apparent trim. Messenger buoys were absent from recesses, diving planes were positioned for surfacing and the vertical rudder was positioned 200 to port. Outer and pressure hulls had no apparent damage. There was a large number of parts of fishing trawls and nets on and near the submarine, and one net was being held vertically by floats at a height of 15-20 m. This net was a serious hindrance in the descents, since it created a constant threat that the observation chamber, uncontrolled beneath the water, would become entangled in the net. 90. The author directed inspection of the submarine, and he has special recollections connected with this period. It is common knowledge how difficult it is for a ship commander and any leader to work in the presence of higher-ups, especially if there is danger to people's lives. I too ended up in that situation when HSU First Deputy CinC Northern Fleet Vice Admiral A. Petelin arrived aboard our salvage vessel. After familiarizing himself with inspection results and learning that operators' contradictory reports about the position of masts and status of the submarine's conning-tower hatch were of special concern, the vice admiral decided to descend personally in the observation chamber. He believed that as a submariner it would be easy for him to understand the situation on the submarine. This placed me in an extremely difficult spot, especially as safety of observation chamber descents was not guaranteed because of the fishing net hanging over the submarine hull. And although Petelin was senior in position and rank and so his decision was subject to unquestioning execution, I was responsible for organization and safety of observation chamber descents. With consideration of all these circumstances I had to report to the First Deputy CinC Fleet that it was impossible to carry out his decision. The vice admiral took my arguments in an extremely negative manner. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 91. In order somehow to avoid an imminent conflict in which my behavior might be regarded as lack of diligence or discipline, I instructed flag specialists who were aboard- diver Captain 3rd Rank I. Ivashchenko and physiologist Zolotavin-to give Petelin the complete quiz, check his preparedness as an operator as well as his state of health, and to make an appropriate entry in the diving log about this. But my hopes for negative findings were not borne out. Under the rear [sic] admiral's pressure, the flag specialists authorized him to make a descent after giving him a detailed briefing on actions and safety measures. The descent took place. The admiral lacked necessary underwater work experience and could not immediately understand the situation, determine his position relative to the submarine, and recognize the submarine masts, which had become encrusted with seaweed and mussels and had changed their customary appearance. After some time Petelin got his bearings. After a thorough inspection he reported that the conning-tower access hatch was closed, the periscope was lowered, and the radio communications and radar antenna as well as the snorkel mast were raised. The inspection mission thus was accomplished. Nevertheless, after becoming comfortable in the underwater situation, the admiral began demanding that the observation chamber be shifted to the submarine afterbody to continue the inspection. Considering that the effective time of regeneration equipment in the chamber was coming to an end, I did not meet this demand and hoisted the chamber aboard the vessel. Petelin expressed his extreme dissatisfaction to me... Despite this, I was happy that the descent had ended safely and asked Petelin that he not advertise his descent, since I had committed a violation. He made a promise but did not keep it, and I had a serious conversation with then First Deputy CinC Navy, Admiral of the Fleet V. Kasatonov. 92. A finding was compiled based on results of the series of inspections and a possible version of the submarine's loss was formulated which basically was confirmed after she was raised and inspected by a commission. The submarine had been proceeding under periscope in a snorkel mode with a sea state of 5-6 and reduced visibility due to periodic snow flurries; she had negative buoyancy of 5-8 tonnes in accordance with existing instructions. At some point in time those aboard discovered the submarine was closing dangerously with a vessel. They put the rudder over to \"hard to port\" position to pass, but the danger of a collision remained and they decided to crash dive to avoid it. Malfunctions in the snorkel lines' valve-closing system led to taking on water in the pressure hull, which increased the submarine's negative buoyancy even more. By the steps it took, the crew managed to stop or reduce entry of water into the pressure hull, decrease trim, and restrain the fast dive. The submarine descended smoothly to the bottom. Attempts to surface produced no positive results in view of the expenditure of high pressure air reserves. 93. After results of the submarine's inspection were reported to Moscow, the decision was made to raise her in 1969 using the ship-raising salvage vessel \"Karpaty,\" whose construction was being completed. Creation of a special unit, the Special Purpose Expedition, was provided for to prepare and perform this not very common work. It was initially planned to appoint Rear Admiral N. Chiker, the most experienced specialist in the Navy Salvage and Rescue Service, as Expedition commander and me as chief of staff, but after detailed studies and coordination of the Special Purpose Expedition's table of Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 organization and other organizational and technical documents, Nikolay Petrovich Chiker nominated me for the position of commander, leaving overall direction for himself. Thus I became commander of the Special Purpose Expedition, which was quite an unusual unit manned by specialists not only of the Northern Fleet, but also of other fleets and even of central naval entities. 94. A number of directive documents were issued through channels of the Ministry of Defense, Navy, Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry, and Northern Fleet in fulfilling the government decision to raise the submarine. Considering that the sunken submarine's design did not provide for ship-raising stocks, the decision was made to specially design and build a gripping device, a cumbersome structure weighing around 400 tonnes overall. It was to be lowered onto the submarine hull and was to grip her with its clamp-fenders. 95. The Research Institute was assigned to develop the project for raising the submarine using the gripping device and the salvage ship \"Karpaty\" and to issue necessary technological data and provide consultations for Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry planning organizations. 96. The Northern Fleet Rear, other Fleet entities, and ship repair yards were assigned to support Special Purpose Expedition activity with everything necessary, including to equip the work area at sea with anchorage buoys for stationing vessels; supply additional ship-raising gear and equipment and facilities; organize specific hydrometeorological support and so on. 97. In this period the Special Purpose Expedition table of organization structure, functional duties of appointed persons of its headquarters, the staffs of the engineer service, and the salvage parties were established; the Expedition's ship makeup was determined and substantiated; and documents were drawn up for preparing and conducting test exercises. Considering that favorable weather permitting ship-raising operations could be expected in the Barents Sea only during June-July, strict control was established over observance of time periods for performing all planned measures. 98. But in real life not everything turned out as planned... 99. Neither the importance and special nature of the work nor the compressed time periods which had been established generated great concern or desire in a large number of staff officials in the center and in the Fleet to resolve all questions promptly. The Special Purpose Expedition table of organization did not manage to be coordinated in Ministry of Defense central entities for a long time. Representatives of these entities did not wish to understand the complexity and importance of tasks being assigned the Expedition. Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry planning organizations and yards were more concerned with the size of the bonus for unscheduled work than for its timely fulfillment... 100. Some chiefs of the directorate and departments in the Northern Fleet considered our Expedition an alien body which was simply hampering accomplishment of current Fleet missions. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 101. Almost all established deadlines were missed as a result. Manning the Special Purpose Expedition with officers was completed in March 1969 and with petty officers and seamen in March instead of January; and it was brought up to strength in vessels in April (by plan prior to 1 February 1969). The \"Karpaty\" arrived in the Northern Fleet in June instead of May and the gripping device was delivered to the Northern Fleet only in September 1969, already after completion of raising operations. 102. In recalling all the organizational shortcomings, I would like to make kind mention of Northern Fleet officers who actively assisted our Expedition despite being very busy with principal functional duties. They were Rear Admiral (later Admiral) V. Sidorov, commander of a seaward defense ship formation; Captain 3rd Rank (later Captain 1st Rank and Chief Engineer of the Navy Search and Rescue Service) N. Burkov, a salvage operations specialist; and others. 103. The possibility and results of raising operations depend on a number of objective and subjective factors, one of the most important being weather conditions, and sea state above all, since even to this day performance of ship-raising operations as a rule is possible only with a sea state up to 2-3. Swells are a special hindrance. The sunken submarine was in an open area of the always restless and crafty Barents Sea. Therefore a portion of the preparatory measures, including preparation of roadstead equipment (six sets, each consisting of a mooring anchor, line mooring bridle, chain mooring bridle, and buoys), removal of the fishing net from the submarine and clearing the hull of trawl pieces, was planned to be done prior to 1 June. The success of ship-raising also depends to a considerable extent on proper choice of the raising option (optimum for a given situation) and on the quality with which its plan is worked out. 104. Considering industry's delay in fabricating the gripping device, which was a raising option, reserve options also were studied in which it was decided to use forward and aft underkeel slings in place of the gripping device. It was planned to raise the submarine on them to a depth of 70 m using hoisting gear of the \"Karpaty\" and tow her in a suspended condition to a sheltered coastal area for subsequent raising to the surface using pontons and divers. 105. ***GRAPHICS uma0240 ***Scheme for raising and towing the submarine to a coastal area *** GRAPHICS uma0240 *** 106. Despite its seeming simplicity, the reserve option which we chose contained significant variants of risk: 107. ? safety margins in these ship-raising devices were considerably less than for the gripping device envisaged by the main option; ? it was inevitable that the slings would cut through the submarine's outer hull, which might be accompanied by a break of the slings themselves; ? the forward sling was situated in the vicinity of a torpedo tube; if the sling slipped toward the submarine bow with the trim necessary for passing the aft sling over, this might lead to deformation of torpedo tubes and explosion of torpedoes; ? it Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 was more likely that the submarine would slip from the slings than from the gripping device on the sea transit; 108. We carefully analyzed all this and outlined steps to reduce risk, but new problems arose after a failure in a test exercise. In the exercise an attempt was made to raise a submarine mock-up made of two 400-tonne pontons and to test the capability of modified lowering and hoisting devices of \"Karpaty\". One sling 65 mm in diameter broke due to great dynamic overloads with a sea state of 3, and the mock-up sank. 109. Thus the test exercise showed that without reliable shock absorbers to compensate for wave effect it was impossible to raise the submarine in the restless Barents Sea and move her to a sheltered coastal area over a distance of up to 100 nm. 110. Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry research institutes and planning organizations refused to develop shock absorbers for heavy loads, motivating this by the fact that there were no such shock absorbers in world practice. Navy research institutes also did not find a solution to this problem. An impasse formed which cast doubt not only on the deadlines, but also on the possibility of raising the submarine at all using \"Karpaty.\" 111. We began seeking a solution and rested on an idea of Captain 1st Rank Yu. Senatskiy, Special Purpose Expedition chief engineer, who proposed using the capron lines found aboard salvage vessels for fabricating shock absorbers. A sketch of such a shock absorber was sent to scientific and planning organizations of the Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry and the Navy, where it received no support. Then we decided to make and test a mock-up sample ourselves. The mock-up passed the test positively with a sea state of 3-4 over a five-day period. After this we had Special Purpose Expedition salvage party personnel fabricate similar homemade capron shock absorbers, and some parts were ordered from a ship repair yard. Another serious problem had been solved. 112. It was June 1969. Summer had come to the Arctic. For the Barents Sea this is a period of polar night and favorable weather conditions. 113. In the first days of June almost all preparatory measures involving the shore were completed and we received a fundamental \"okay\" to raise the submarine according to the chosen reserve option. 114. Within the scope of brief notes there is no opportunity to tell in detail about what was done in raising the submarine. This was most intensive labor. We began work on 9 June and on 5 July had raised the submarine 5 m above the bottom, moved her 60 m to one side, and again laid her on the bottom to prepare for towing to a coastal area. Her towing in a suspended state beneath \"Karpaty\" at a speed of 2.5 knots began on 10 July. Thirty-eight hours later, on 12 July, the submarine was lowered to the bottom at a depth of 51 m in Zavalishina Inlet of Teriberskaya Bay. 115. The first phase of the operation had ended. Everyone was satisfied with its result: Fleet command element, heads of the Navy and of the Navy Salvage and Rescue Service and, finally, we the immediate participants in the raising. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 116. The second phase was conducted using pontons and diver labor and also ended successfully. The submarine was raised to the surface on 24 July. 117. Thus the submarine, which was at a depth of 200 m in an open part of the Barents Sea, was raised in only 34 working days. During this time there were 67 descents of the deep-water work chamber with an overall stay beneath water of 172 hours, and 20 descents of the observation chamber (67 hours under water). Divers went down 54 times. Their work time under water was 68 hours and decompression time was 175 hours. Stormy weather and other sometimes unforeseen circumstances at times placed us in a critical situation, but it should be noted especially that correct decisions were found in all difficult situations. 118. At the completion of raising the submarine, a special commission arrived aboard \"Karpaty\" chaired by well-known submariner HSU Vice Admiral Grigoriy lvanovich Shchedrin. The commission completed work on the submarine on 12 August and made a finding about the inadvisability of performing restoration work. The submarine was later cut up for scrap. 119. Our Expedition was disbanded in October 1969. Vessels returned to their own formations and officers were placed at the disposal of personnel entities of those fleets from which they were assigned. At the recommendation of the Special Purpose Expedition command element, all participants in raising the submarine were commended in CinC Northern Fleet and CinC Navy orders. Some participants received valuable gifts. The Navy leadership did not petition for presenting state awards to those who especially distinguished themselves, motivating this by the fact that the Navy sank the submarine and raised her itself, and so there was no one to reward. It is clearly impossible to agree with such a practice. Heroic deeds of salvagers must not remain in the shadows, as often happened when some leaders tried to find shortcomings in salvagers' actions and the latter had only unpleasantness in place of commendation. 120. For objectivity's sake it should be noted that work to create the salvage ship \"Karpaty\" and to raise the submarine were twice submitted for the USSR State Prize competition at the initiative of the Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry. Included as coauthors from the Navy were N. Chiker, S. Minchenko and Yu. Senatskiy. The documents submitted to the Committee for Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR stated: \"...There was not a single instance in world practice of raising sunken submarines by nondiver means. Submarines have been raised from a depth down to 93 m by conventional methods, with a time of up to 180 days spent on these raisings. The method submitted for competition was used to raise a submarine with a displacement of 1,160 tonnes from a depth of 200 m in 34 days in 1969...\" 121. But the awarding of prizes depended wholly on allocations from above, and the number of awards and prizes was strictly limited... A positive decision made earlier on our work was rescinded. 122. And that is how this complicated, risky ship-raising operation ended. Its success was won under those difficult conditions thanks to the selfless Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 labor of all participants of the Special Purpose Expedition, and above all the officers of its staff engineer service. Among them were Yu. Senatskiy, chief engineer of the Special Purpose Expedition and chief of engineer service; V. Basistyy, his senior assistant; V. Bakharev and I. Svistunov, senior shipbuilding engineers; Ye. Cherednichenko, flag engineer officer; L. Koloshko, chief of staff of the Special Purpose Expedition; E. Chirimanov, flag diving specialist; N. Gusskikh, his assistant; N. Tkachenko, flag hydrometeorologist; Yu. Kitkov, salvage party officer; as well as Navy Research Institute scientific associates L. Chistyakov, V. Molchanov, P. Nikolskiy, A. Sergeyev and V. Bogdanov. 123. It would appear that the experience of organization and work in the Special Purpose Expedition will be useful even now in preparations to raise the submarine \"Komsomolets\" and in other work being done by naval salvage personnel. 124.

A Quarter Century Before Chernobyl, by V. lzgarshev 129. It happened in the Atlantic on 4 July 1961 aboard a Soviet nuclear powered submarine: a reactor accident! The seamen did not falter. They worked to save the ship regardless of their own lives, and they saved her. The secret\" of the exploit was kept for 29 years. 130. In April 1989, some time after the loss of the nuclear powered submarine Komsomolets, two veteran submariners-N. Zateyev and G. Kuznetsov-appeared in the PRAVDA military department. Both now are retired captains 1st rank. Zateyev spent eight years underwater just as a submarine commander. He sailed all the seas and oceans. He performed duty abroad. Three orders recognize his services to the Navy. Captain 1st Rank Kuznetsov's biography is no less impressive. 131. \"Have you had a chance to read the novel 'Eternal Flame'?\" was the question with which Nikolay Vladimirovich Zateyev began our conversation. 132. Unfortunately you can't keep up with everything printed, as they say. 133. \"Here's the point,\" explained Zateyev. \"In the prologue the author wrote that the events told about in the novel are fictitious, but if something similar were to happen in reality Soviet seamen would act just as courageously and selflessly as the heroes of Eternal Flame'...\" \"But the events did occur in real life-aboard the nuclear powered submarine which I commanded,\" continued Zateyev. 134. \"That means the lines of the foreword were necessary just for Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 censorship?\" 135. \"Very likely...\" 136. After completing a difficult phase of Exercise \"Arctic Circle,\" the nuclear powered submarine commanded by Nikolay Zateyev was proceeding to a new area of the North Atlantic assigned by the senior commander. There were to be missile launches with emergence from beneath the Arctic ice. Service on the ship, one of the firstborn of the Soviet nuclear powered submarine fleet, proceeded with faultless precision according to a rhythm worked out on a lengthy training cruise. The ocean was quiet and motionless in the depths. All machinery and the main power plant functioned normally and nothing presaged trouble. The next sheet on the calendar in the commander's cabin already had been uncovered since evening-4 July 1961. 137. At 0415 hours the port reactor emergency protection system suddenly was actuated. An emergency? It seemed so. Monitoring devices showed a sharp drop in first loop pressure to zero. The main and auxiliary pumps that supported the loop's coolant circulation stopped (or more accurately, they jammed as a result of the pressure drop) and the level in the pressurizers fell. 138. I quote all these technical terms from the submarine commander's words: he gives them smoothly. 139. And so the unforeseen occurred aboard the nuclear powered submarine. The instruction manual contained no recommendations for this instance, although its likelihood had been envisaged. What was to be done? How should they act so as not to allow fuel-element meltdown, destruction of the reactor and a catastrophic spread of radiation? The instruction manual suggested removing the heat being given off by the fuel elements by running (pumping) water through the core. But how? In what way? The design of the first reactors had no special systems and devices for this purpose. A critical situation was forming. A council of department heads and engineers decided to assemble a nonstandard cooling system and use the onboard fresh water reserve for this. 140. The fight for the life of ship and crew began. In two hours the cooling system became operational and the threat of reactor destruction was eliminated. But at what cost? It was clear that everyone called upon to work on the reactor would receive very large radiation doses. 141. \"Boris, do you know what you're getting into?\" Zateyev asked Lieutenant Korchilov. 142. \"I know, Commander. But I can think of no other alternative.\" 143. The commander clearly realized there simply was no other alternative. 144. Here are the names of those who, in sacrificing themselves to save the crew and ship, did not falter and performed their duty to the end in the reactor compartment, adjacent compartments and control room: 145. Lieutenant Boris KORCHILOV, Petty Officer 1st Class Yuriy ORDOCHKIN, Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Petty Officer 2nd Class Yevgeniy KASHENKOV, Seaman Semen PENKOV, Seaman Nikolay SAVKIN, Seaman Valeriy KHARITONOV, Captain-Lieutenant Yuriy POVSTYEV, Chief Petty Officer Boris RYZHIKOV. 146. I quote the list in the sequence given by Zateyev. Captain 3rd Rank Anatoliy Kozyrev, Captain-Lieutenant Vladimir Yelin [sic], Chief Petty Officer Ivan Kulakov and Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Krasichkov received very large doses. 147. Not one crew member avoided his share of rems. Ship's doctor Major A. Kosach and chemical department head Captain N. Vakhromeyev had an excessive amount of work. All cares of assisting victims fell on their shoulders. It was the first time they had encountered such patients or such an unbelievable situation. It is impossible to tell about the tortures of those who received an above-permissible radiation dose. People's faces changed and speech failed... 148. A fire broke out twice in the reactor enclosure. A steam blanket was discovered beneath the reactor compartment deck (it is sealed). Pipes turned into a dangerous radiation source as the reactor was flooded with water. \"They glowed,\" said Zateyev. 149. The commander instructed that seamen not engaged in rescue operations or the watch be taken onto the upper deck. 150. But it is not said for nothing: It does not rain but it pours. The submarine's lengthy cruise at great depths with the forcing of ice fields had affected the structure of the main transmitter antenna insulator: the ship was left without communications with shore. Moreover, she was in a deserted corner of the ocean, in isolation. It was 1,500 nm to base. 151. Head home? But this would take so much time on one reactor in a surface condition that even if they all transferred to the upper deck, the consequences of people being in the presence of such a radiation level were unpredictable. By the way, they were fully predictable. No one would be left with any hope of survival. 152. Zateyev made the decision to reverse course to close with our other ships in the exercise area. There was one consideration: to contact them using the emergency low-power transmitter and ask that they transmit an incident report to shore. There was of course no small amount of risk: the submarines might have departed the exercise area. But there was no alternative and, after announcing his decision to the crew, the commander ordered turning to the reverse course. 153. The risk justified itself. A rendezvous occurred. Captains 3rd rank Grigoriy Vasser and Zhan Sverbilov, commanders of two diesel submarines, S-159 and S-270, responded to the emergency signal. At their own responsibility and risk, without the command element's authorization, they both immediately left the area where training missions were being performed and hastened to assist the damaged ship during a storm which had begun and which was so common in these places. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 154. With the arrival of Vasser's submarine contact was made with the Navy and Northern Fleet command centers. The diesel submariners tried to take the damaged submarine in tow, but the attempts failed because of the storm. 155. The seriously ill and seamen not engaged in duties managed to be evacuated with great difficulty from the nuclear powered submarine to Sverbilov's submarine, which had arrived. The odyssey of the submariners who had gotten into trouble continued. Alarming radio reports went to shore. The shore gave advice to feed the irradiated seamen fresh vegetables and fruits and give them juices to drink. Of course there had been no vegetables, fruit or juice aboard for a long time. 156. The next to last radio message... Zateyev requested permission for the personnel to abandon ship. Shore was silent. Realizing that he could not wait for authorization and that being on the nuclear powered submarine without risk to life already was simply foolhardy, Zateyev ordered everyone to evacuate to the diesel submarine. 157. But first the crew placed all machinery and systems in an inoperative condition. In short, everything was done to ensure the nuclear powered submarine's survivability afloat and ecologic safety for the ocean. 158. As prescribed by regulation, Zateyev abandoned ship last. Captain-Lieutenant Vladimir Pogorelov, electrical engineering division officer, was with him. 159. An entry was left in the ship's log of Vasser's submarine that at the nuclear powered submarine commander's suggestion, two live torpedoes were prepared on the diesel submarine in case they had to sink the nuclear powered submarine if any uninvited foreign representatives made any attempts to get aboard her. Well, such were the times-general suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation of a far from fictitious enemy. 160. Fortunately torpedoes were not required. 161. It was a difficult, stormy passage home. Transfer to a destroyer which arrived... The radiological decontamination procedure. And then hospital ashore. The seriously wounded were dispatched to the Biophysics Institute. And there was the ridiculous fall of one of the helicopters with sick submariners aboard before the eyes of the entire hospital and all those seeing them off. True, there were no victims. Fate had prepared a different ordeal for the submariners. The sick died from the atom. 162. And there were also many days of investigation of actions by the commander and other appointed persons, with records, testimony, explanations, night summons... 163. The fate of those who received extremely heavy radiation doses was decided within a week. The others had to lie a long time in hospital beds. 164. One street in the Zapolyarnyy naval garrison bears the name of Boris Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Korchilov. The commander recommended the lieutenant for the Hero of the Soviet Union title. The Navy command in Moscow decreed otherwise: \"An accident.. An order will do.\" 165. Modest monuments stand in Moscow's Kuzminskiy Cemetery over the graves of Yu. Ordochkin, Ye. Kashenkov, S. Penkov, N. Savkin and V. Kharitonov. At Krasnenkiy Cemetery in Leningrad there are monuments on the graves of B. Korchilov and Yu. Povstyev. B. Ryzhikov is buried in Zelenogradskiy Cemetery near Leningrad. 166. And the other crew members? They scattered throughout the country by ground and air. The fate of some is unknown. With respect to the Muscovites, they gather at Kuzminskiy Cemetery each year. And on Navy Day they come with wives, children and grandchildren to the suburban Moscow settlement of Skhodnya, to ulitsa Kirov, 5. This is the address where Petty Officer 1st Class (Reserve) Viktor Strelets, former proprietor of the nuclear powered submarine's storage battery, lives. The first meeting in Skhodnya took place at the request of Strelets many years ago. The petty officer turned to colleagues for help in finishing his house. Everyone came and helped. This was on the day of the navymen's holiday. Since then meetings in Skhodnya have become traditional, considering that there is a house for this. 167. A special government commission acknowledged that the personnel's actions in eliminating the emergency situation aboard the ship were correct. The navymen's capable actions were recognized once again somewhat later at an important conference in October 1961 where the question of continuing construction of the nuclear powered submarine fleet was decided. It was said that the sacrifices suffered by the crew had not been in vain. 168. The lesson was of benefit. Authorized emergency water flooding systems were installed and provided for on all operating or planned deck-type reactors. 169. Many seamen, petty officers and officers were decorated (some posthumously) with orders and medals for courage and heroism. The entire crew was recognized with valuable engraved gifts of the Minister of Defense. 170. During presentation of orders and medals, Admiral I. Baykov, who at that time was commander of the Leningrad Naval Base, \"heartened\" the navymen, who had not yet recovered from the shock: \"Well, why do you consider yourselves heroes? Injury accidents also happen here in Leningrad.\" By the way, some submariners got no award at all. 171. Perhaps now it is worthwhile to return to this question of awards. I realize it is not the important thing, but it is never too late to render people their due, for they were the first who did battle with the atom and conquered it. 172. Then, at the dawn of the atom, none of them yet knew the consequences to which a reactor explosion might lead for all living things and for our entire mother Earth. People learned of this after Chernobyl. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 173. But at that time 25 years still remained until Chernobyl. 174. The commander now has one concern-to find every one of the crew and learn how and on what they are living. Perhaps assemble them in that same hospital in the Military Medical Academy? Let the specialists have a look and check how those disastrous rems affected the heroes' health... 175. He writes to the Navy command, to the USSR Ministry of Defense and to high places. And by the way, he finds support. It is up to the navymen. Where are you, comrades? Respond. 176. \"Well, but what happened to the submarine?\" the reader asks. She is in the Northern Fleet order of battle. At that time she was brought to base by the \"Aldan,\" a fleet rescue ship. The shipbuilders fixed and corrected everything and the nuclear powered submarine continues her service. 177. Photo captions 178. Captain 1st Rank N. V.

Monument to crew members of nuclear powered submarine K-19, which was lost [sic] [Inscription: Glory to you and eternal memory] 180. PRAVDA, 1 July 1990 181. An Emergency Which Did Not Happen, by Zh. Sverbilov 182. This was in July 1961. The submarine S-270, which I commanded at that time, was in the North Atlantic participating in Exercise \"Arctic Circle.\" There were over 30 submarines in this area. Having come up to a depth of nine meters for a routine communications session, my radiomen received a message: \"Have reactor accident. Personnel overexposed. Need help. Latitude 66? north, longitude 4?. Commander, K-19.\" 183. Assembling the officers and petty officers in second compartment, I read them the coded message and expressed my opinion: our duty was to go help the submariners. The officers and petty officers supported me. 184. There was doubt only as to the location of the submarine in distress: the radio message did not specify whether the longitude was east or west. At this time our S-270 was on Greenwich, i.e., the zero meridian. 185. Then Executive Officer Ivan Svishch recalled that about seven days ago we had intercepted a radio message in which the commander of the K-1 (which now has been lost) was reporting the condition of ice in Denmark Strait to the commander of this submarine. We thus surmised that the longitude of the submarine in distress was west. 186. We came up to a surface condition and headed for the presumed rendezvous point at full speed. The weather was good, the sun was shining, and the ocean was calm. There was only a rough swell. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 187. After about four hours we made out a dot on the horizon. In closing we recognized it to be a submarine in full surface condition. We received a disorderly salvo of varicolored flares in response to our green-flare identification query. It was the sub. Before this we, i.e., I and my officers and seamen, had not had occasion to see the first Soviet nuclear powered missile submarine. Her entire crew was assembled on the forward superstructure. Having learned my first name from the commander, people were waving their hands and shouting: \"Zhan, come on!!!\" 188. The radiation level began increasing as we approached the submarine. While it was 0.4-0.5 roentgens per hour at a distance of 0.1 nm, it rose to 4-7 roentgens per hour by her side. We moored alongside at 1400 hours. Submarine commander Nikolay Zateyev was on the bridge. I asked what help they needed. He asked me to take aboard 11 seriously ill persons and provide him with radio communications with the flag command center, i.e., with shore, since his radios already had oxidized and were inoperative. 189. Among the excited people on the K-1 9's forward superstructure were three with swollen faces lying on stretchers. A problem immediately arose of how to transfer the people to our submarine, as submarines leave access boards on the pier in base in putting to sea. I suggested that Zateyev rig out the bow planes and, moving forward along his side, I led the S-270's stempost beneath them. Now it was possible to transfer the three persons on stretchers along the planes as along access boards. These were Lieutenant Boris Korchilov, Chief Petty Officer Boris Ryzhikov and Petty Officer 1st Class Yuriy Ordochkin. Eight persons ran across on their own. 190. Hardly had these eleven persons been accommodated in first compartment when 9 roentgens per hour immediately appeared in it. When I reported this to Kolya Zateyev, he suggested undressing the lads and tossing the clothing overboard. After this procedure there were 0.5 roentgens per hour in our compartment. But these lads themselves were radiating considerably more, especially when they vomited. Our doctor, Yuriy Saliyenko, processed each one with alcohol and dressed them in our emergency clothing. I sent a radio message to the Fleet command center: \"Standing alongside K-19. Took aboard 11 seriously ill. Providing K-19 with radio communications. Await instructions Commander, S-270.\" In approximately an hour messages came addressed to me from CinC Navy and CinC Northern Fleet with almost the same content: \"What are you doing alongside K-19? Why did you leave the screen without authorization? You will answer for unwarranted action. \" 191. I asked Zateyev to draw up a coded message on the condition of his submarine in order to transmit it to the Fleet command center with my radio. An hour and a half after the coded message went ashore, the Fleet command center ordered the S-159 commanded by Grigoriy Vasser and S-270 [sic] commanded by Gennadiy Nefedov to proceed to the submarine in distress and help Sverbilov take off the people. 192. And we continued standing alongside. Doctor Yura Saliyenko was working on the patients in first compartment. Executive Officer Ivan Svishch together with Zateyev's assistant Volodya Yenin led the mooring lines from our stern to Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 their bow in order to try to tow the submarine, but as soon as we got under way, the stretched lines snapped like strings. All attempts were in vain-nothing came of the towing. 193. And we continued standing there. The diesel generator was started on the damaged submarine and radioactive smoke began pouring into our faces with the spray. Naturally I asked Zateyev to stop the machinery. Then he called me to the bow for top secret talks. Only then I learned that he had colossal thermal conditions in the reactor and from minute to minute he was awaiting... a nuclear explosion. It remained to be happy that we were in the epicenter and if anything happened we would not be left as cripples. 194. No foreign aircraft were flying over us, but just in case, Zateyev and I also ran through the following option: if an American warship should appear, everyone would transfer to our submarine and we would sink the K-19. To this end the command was given to our submarine torpedo department head Boris Antropov to prepare two live torpedoes. Fortunately this action did not have to be taken. There were neither aircraft nor ships in the time we were standing there. 195. By 0300 hours on the following day the submarines of Vasser and Nefedov had approached. A command came from the Fleet command center for all personnel of the damaged submarine to transfer to Sverbilov, Vasser and Nefedov, to withdraw 1 nm from the K-19 and observe her until the arrival of our surface ships. Kolya Zateyev was last to leave the ship. 196. In receiving the people, we undressed them. They went along the planes naked, carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles, but Ivan Svishch and Borya Antropov tossed these weapons overboard with a spinning motion. Money and party and Komsomol cards were placed in a sealed locker. Another 68 persons came over to our submarine in addition to those 11. Among them were two of the commander's understudies-Vladimir Pershin and Vasiliy Arkhipov. Large bags of secret documents also were dragged onto our submarine. Kolya Zateyev transferred over to Grisha Vasser's submarine with the remaining people. 197. The Fleet command center ordered me and Vasser to proceed to base at full speed by the shortest route. All this time radio messages of various content were coming addressed to us. The chief of the Fleet medical service recommended feeding the irradiated persons fruit, fresh vegetables, juices and antibiotics, but by that time even potatoes already had run out for us. A representative of the special department inquired as to who from the crew could sensibly explain the reason for the accident. To this query, assistant Volodya Yenin suggested \"sending\" the inquirer as far away as possible, but I responded that I had 79 persons aboard who needed medical help. A radio message came which announced that by the end of the third day of the route we would be debarked onto destroyers coming to meet us. 198. The weather worsened. A storm broke with high waves, rain and wind. On the third day we discovered we were being tracked by radars and realized these were the destroyers. We headed to meet them and soon discovered the three destroyers. The storm broke loose and we and the destroyers were flung in turn high into the sky. It was impossible to approach. I transmitted this to the Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 commander of the destroyer detachment (he was aboard one of them) by VHF/UHF [Translator note: could be either VHF or UHF]. He responded that he had a categorical CinC Fleet order to receive the people from me and suggested passing close by the side of the destroyer \"Byvalyy\" and assess the situation together with her commander. At this time Doctor Yura Saliyenko emerged onto the bridge and said: \"Comrade Commander, they're dying; I'm doing everything I can.\" Then I decided to approach. I transmitted over VHF/UHF that \"Byvalyy\" should swing to a heading against the waves and the other destroyer should cover us from the bow by standing athwart the waves. That is what they did. I approached \"Byvalyy's\" starboard side with my port side. Under cover of the second destroyer this maneuver succeeded. 199. The topside crew on \"Byvalyy\" was dressed in chemical outfits and protective masks. \"Byvalyy's\" commander also wore a protective mask. They threw us mooring lines from the destroyer and passed an access board to the top of our sail. We first assembled the people from the damaged submarine in our control room and conning tower. Thirty of the healthiest managed to run across to the destroyer. When the ship covering us from the bow began falling foul of us the destroyer got underway. 200. All the seriously ill remained with us. Our wonderful engineer officer, Tolya Feoktistov, came up to the bridge and reported that we were left with no more than 7-8 percent metacentric stability and in order to right the submarine it was necessary to partially fill the starboard main ballast tanks and with constant operation of compressors to blow out the port tanks, which were filling from the motion. 201. After righting the submarine in that manner, we began moving toward base, no longer at full speed, but at 6 knots, at an acute angle to the waves. Our submarine's seamen, petty officers and officers did everything possible to ease the suffering of the sick. We gave up all our bunks to them, dressed them in our emergency and diving gear, and prepared hot food in the galley only for their crew. Doctor Saliyenko did not leave the patients. The torpedomen in first compartment spoon-fed the patients. The commander's understudies, Volodya Pershin and Vasya Arkhipov, were put up in my cabin. 202. Another two days went by. The weather began to improve and the water to abate. We received a radio message that we would debark the people onto other destroyers in the vicinity of North Cape. On approaching the rendezvous point we discovered two Type 30-BIS destroyers. By this point in time Grisha Vasser's submarine also had caught up with us. 203. In order not to finish off and sink my damaged submarine once and for all, I suggested to the commander of one of the destroyers that we proceed to the nearest fjord and that he receive the people from us there on calm water. That is what we did. We entered a narrow fjord near Nordkyn. It was very deep. There were sheer cliffs 110-120 m to the left and right reflecting a powerful echo. Despite our intelligence summaries, we discovered no observation posts or missile-gun emplacements on the coast of this fjord. I moored to the destroyer in quiet water and debarked the 49 remaining persons. Vasser debarked people onto the other destroyer in boats. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 204. After this we swung to a course for base and began radiological decontamination in compartments. We washed sides, bulkheads, plating, instruments and so on. On the approach to Kola Bay all posts hoisted the signal \"Entry granted for the commander\" without our requesting it. We signalled the Kildin post: \"Request provide mooring. Have no mooring lines.\" 205. We moored in base at third pier. On descending to the pier I did not know to whom to report our arrival-it was the first time I had seen that many admirals and generals in a relatively small area. The generals basically were medical people. Finally I caught sight of Northern Fleet Chief of Staff Anatoliy Ivanovich Rassokho among the admirals and reported our arrival to him. A medical general addressed me with the question of whether or not we had a ship's doctor and if we did, could he be invited to the pier. We summoned Doctor Saliyenko. On seeing the big medical luminary, Yura, who had conducted himself so boldly and selflessly at sea, became so confused that he saluted the general with his left hand. The general took the doctor's hands into his own and said: \"How do you do, Colleague.\" Our doctor blushed and went with the general to the end of the pier to chat on their professional subjects. 206. We began unloading the bags of secret documents from the submarine. I was standing next to the Fleet chief of staff watching our seamen pile these bags on the pier and the Fleet Radiation Safety Service took measurements of radiation levels. The Fleet flag security officer approach Rassokho and asked what to do with the documents. \"Is there much on them?\" asked Rassokho. \"Much,\" the other responded. \"Burn them immediately!!!\" said Major General of Medical Service Tsipichev, chief of the Fleet Medical Service, intervening in the conversation. 207. Then the executive officer formed up our submarine crew on shore. I thanked the seamen, petty officers and officers for their service. They responded, not quite in concert, with the traditional \"We Serve the Soviet Union,\" and all of us went to the bathhouse for decontamination. We washed long and thoroughly. There was a table in the dressing room at which a female registering clerk sat, and next to her stood a chemical rating with a beta-gamma radiometer and Northern Fleet flag chemical officer Captain 1st Rank Kuvardin. 208. Our radar operator, Petty Officer 2nd Class Bokov, was first out of the washroom. He approached the table and they measured his level-2,700 for beta particles. \"How many does he have?\" asked Kuvardin. \"2,700,\" responded the girl. Kuvardin slapped Bokov on his wet shoulder and said: \"You're lucky, lad! 3,000 is the norm.\" When the next one turned out to have 4,200, Kuvardin cheered him up, too and said that the norm was 5,000. For us, the officers who stood on the bridge, beta particle levels in the vicinity of the thyroid gland were from 8,000 to 11,500. They took away all our clothing and issued white seamen's robes-we did not have our own clothing. The tender \"Pineda\" was hurried in for my crew and Vasser's. Aboard her the seamen were accommodated in bunkrooms freed up especially for us and the officers were shown cabins. 209. Officer friends from submarines standing in base came to see me in the cabin and brought alcohol, which in all fleets of the Soviet Union is called murder,\" evidently because murder will out [Translator's note: literally Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 \"awl,\" but \"murder\" fits the saying better]. They brought appetizers and we drank to the health of those whom we rescued and to the health of people in our crew. Our guests questioned us about how it all happened. They were interested in the details of what happened and who behaved how in this extreme situation. And there was something to tell. 210. Against the background of general decency and boldness, if you like, there was a fact of cowardice. Briefly about the essence of the matter. When we moored to the side of K-19, the first to run across to our submarine was a fully healthy person, and it was after that that we carried across the three who were seriously ill. In handing me an encrypted message form for transmission to Fleet command center submarines, Kolya Zateyev requested that the form be sent back to him as a secret document requiring strict accounting. Well, when the radio message had been transmitted I asked this seaman who was first to leave the submarine to pass the form to Zateyev and heard in response that he was not a seaman but an officer and was a representative of one of the Fleet staff directorates and would not go back aboard the damaged submarine. Then I ordered him to proceed to first compartment where the 11 seriously ill persons already were located, and he responded that he also would not go there and would report my arbitrariness to the Fleet command. I regarded his disobedience as mutiny on a warship, of which I informed him and everyone present on the bridge. After this I ordered Executive Officer Ivan Svishch to bring a pistol to the bridge and shoot the mutineer at the ensign. Ivan began descending to the control room for the pistol. The staff officer realized we were not joking and, mouthing threats, went to first compartment. Subsequently he was first to run across to \"Byvalyy.\" I am not giving this person's first and last name only because, as both Volodya Yenin and my political officer Sergey Safonov said, he was not a coward, but simply \"began leaking morally.\" I also am not giving his name because he was decorated with an order for this cruise, and orders are not handed out to us for nothing. That is how we were taught. We spoke and drank a lot that night. Later we sang Smelyakov's \"Should I Fall III\" to a guitar. We parted at four in the morning. Before falling asleep I thought about the fact that we, i.e., our crew and I as its commander, had done a sacred job. 211. I awoke from someone shaking me by the shoulder. I was being aroused by Kim Batmanov, flag signalman of one of the submarine formations. \"We Fleet officers,\" he said, \"are all for you, Zhan; Butoma, the highest-up in Soviet shipbuilding, has arrived in the Fleet. Everyone tiptoes before him, for he is a Central Committee representative. Well then, he declared that the industry supplies superb equipment to the Fleet, and the Fleet is crap, it does not know how to operate it. That Zateyev is a panic-monger and you, Zhan, are an accomplice to panic. You are accused on three points. First-Why did you leave the screen without an order? Second-On approaching the side, why did you not send a signal about a submarine accident on the appropriate radio net? Third-Why, in standing alongside K-19 and receiving the people, did you not provide for radiological protection of your crew?\" On hearing these points, it was with great difficulty I forced my morning-after head to come to a working state so that thoughts proceeded \"from the right by twos\" as for a normal serviceman. \"On the first point,\" I said, \"we departed the screen since I decided this was a radio message from the Fleet command center, i.e., that the shore was backing up Zateyev's radio message. On the second point, Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 the signal about the accident was supposed to be given by Zateyev through my radio, since he suffered the accident. And on the third point, there are certain norms for all rubber chemical sets and protective masks. Time spent in them is figured in hours and not days. Five days in them would not have added to our health.\" Batmanov was satisfied by my explanation, wrote everything down and said that a mountain had fallen from his shoulders, that he had been given a most unpleasant assignment and was not accustomed to \"setting up\" comrades. 212. I was ordered to report to CinC Fleet Admiral Andrey Trofimovich Chebanenko by 1400 hours. I reported to the CinC Fleet at the appointed time in the white seaman's robe: \"Comrade Admiral, commander of S-270, Captain 3rd Rank Sverbilov, reporting as ordered.\" He asked why my appearance was such. I responded that they took away our uniforms for burial. He immediately summoned Deputy CinC Fleet for Rear, Rear Admiral Polikarpov and issued an order to have new uniforms sewn for our officers. Then I briefed him about all our actions from the moment of receiving the radio message about the accident. 213. The commander in chief conversed with me in a very warm and friendly manner. At that time I did not know how much blood Butoma had spoiled for him, having accused the Fleet of everything and shielded the industry. 214. That evening Ivan Svishch met me on base and said that I alone had not been measured in the tailor's shop. They also measured me and the uniform was ready on the following day. 215. Our submarine had to be placed in the dock for fixing the torn port side, but representatives of the Antiradiation Service refused to accept such an order inasmuch as workers could spend only 20 minutes each on a work shift in our first compartment, around an hour in second compartment, two hours in the control room and so on. Representatives of that service declared to me that soap-and-brush radiological decontamination would not help. It was necessary to cut out the \"ekspanzit,\" remove linoleum and cut out all the wood. This is what our crew did for all the following six days. 216. We visited the navymen from the damaged submarine who were in the local hospital. All the very serious ones were dispatched to Leningrad. Political Officer Sergey Safonov watched them load 11 persons on stretchers into a helicopter. The helicopter lifted off about three meters from the seamen's stadium, the tail rotor brushed a \"The sea loves the strong\" poster and crashed down on its wheels. 217. The medical general was first to leap through the wide-open door shouting curses and then after him they carried out the recumbent lads. Fortunately no one was hurt. It was necessary to use the cheap sea route; they were delivered to Severomorsk aboard the commander in chief's cutter and then by aircraft to Leningrad. Volodya Yenin remained in the hospital. Safonov and I asked him what to do with their party and Komsomol cards, money, and all that we had preserved in the sealed locker. He suggested turning in the cards to the formation political department and taking the money to the lads in the hospital since it had not lost buying power. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 218. When Safonov and I placed the pile of party and Komsomol cards on the desk of Captain 1st Rank M. Repin, chief of the formation political department, he looked at them as if they were an unexploded grenade. \"Why did you bring them here?\" he asked. \"And where were we supposed to bring them?\" we asked. Then he summoned a young civilian secretary and ordered her to lock them in the safe. I do not know the further fate of these party cards. 219. The crew worked on the submarine daily for many hours. It was necessary to get into the dock. On meeting me on the pier, Karaushev, chief of the submarine formation personnel department, said that award documents had been prepared for our crew. According to him, I had been recommended for the Hero of the Soviet Union title. But a month would go by (the submarine already was in the dock) and Gleb Karaushev would say that our award would not take place since, without looking into whose submarine had the accident, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev would write on my recommendation: \"We do not reward for accidents. N. Khrushchev.\" 220. Not a single entry about radiation doses received remained in medical records of navymen of our three crews. 221. I accidentally met a funeral procession while on leave in Zelenogorsk in late July 1961. Those in the procession told me they were burying a submariner from the North. I asked: \"And what did he die of?\" \"He was electrocuted,\" they responded. \"What is the name of the deceased?\" \"Ryzhikov.\" Yes, it was that same Chief Petty Officer Boris Ryzhikov who was among the first three on stretchers transferred to our first compartment. When will bitter experience teach us something? 222. Meanwhile, after the accident the damaged submarine was given the sad nickname \"Hiroshima.\" Subsequently there was another accident on the \"Hiroshima,\" also with loss of life, but let eyewitnesses recall and write about this. 223. It would have been possible to end my tedious odyssey with this if an article by V. lzgarshev \"A Quarter Century Before Chernobyl\" had not been published in PRAVDA on 1 June 1990, 29 years after the occurrence. I thank lzgarshev for making public that which had been classified and for speaking well of the participants of this catastrophe. But there are slight inaccuracies in this article; specifically, we were first to approach the damaged submarine and Vasser's first name is not Lev, but Grigoriy. But for the rest, thank you. 224. At the invitation of my comrade, the present commander of K-19, I flew to the base, where we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the first Soviet nuclear powered missile submarine from 12 through 14 July 1990. Members of this submarine's first crew arrived from all corners of the country. Her first commander, Nikolay Zateyev, arrived. His assistant Volodya Yenin came. He had had two bone marrow transplants. At that time he \"took\" a great deal. The meetings were very cordial. People embraced and cried. I was asked: \"Nevertheless, at that time just why did you leave the screen and go to us without order? For that smelled of the tribunal for you.\" I explained that all this was from my inborn lack of discipline. Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 225. And only now, after the passage of many years, I realized why the shipbuilding leadership at that time received us so poorly-we did not just bring back the sick, we brought back material proof of design imperfection, incomplete development of assemblies and the absence of a precise methodology for operating the new nuclear powered submarine. 226. Captain-Lieutenant Yu. Povstyev, Lieutenant B. Korchilov, Chief Petty Officer B. Ryzhikov, Petty Officer 1st Class Yu. Ordochkin, Petty Officer 2nd Class Kashenkov and seamen Penkov, Kharitonov and Savkin died of radiation sickness in July 1961. 227. Captain 1st Rank A. Kozyrev, the engineering department head, died in 1970 from aftereffects of irradiation. 228. Eternal memory for them! 229. And the others are all alive! 230. ZVEZDA, No 3, 1991 231. Twenty Nine Years Later, by P. Lysenko 232. By publishing a small article, \"A Quarter Century Before Chernobyl\" (1 July 1990), PRAVDA finally told the entire country about how in July 1961 the crew of a nuclear powered missile submarine commanded by Captain 2nd Rank N. Zateyev did battle against the atom, which had gotten out of control, and won, albeit at a dear price. 233. Today one can regret that for long years the details of this exploit were known to very few even in the garrison that was the cradle of the nuclear powered submarine fleet, and that of the members of this crew who displayed courage and self-sacrifice, only the name of Lieutenant Boris Korchilov was more or less familiar to many generations of Northern Fleet navymen, accompanied by a meager wording: He performed his duty to the end in an emergency. But it is impossible only to regret. Our duty, albeit with a delay of almost 30 years, is to render to the heroes what is due them and to do everything possible so the truth about their exploit remains in people's memories. 234. A. S. Ilin, a participant of those tragic events, continues to serve in the Northern Fleet to this day. He now is a rear admiral. We offer for your attention his story as well as excerpts from memoirs of Vladimir Pogorelov, former electrical engineering division head of the nuclear powered submarine, which Ilin passed on to the editors. 235. On 3 July 1961 the submarine was proceeding northeast in order to go beneath the edge of the pack ice and perform missile firing with a practice weapon in the role of the probable enemy. Two diesel submarines located to the south and playing the role of \"Red\" forces had the mission of detecting the nuclear powered submarine, \"attacking\" her and preventing her from executing a missile salvo. Missilemen of the nuclear powered submarine headed by Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 missile-gunnery department head Yuriy Fedorovich Mukhin were ready to demonstrate their proficiency and conclude the deployment with a successful firing, but... 236. From Memoirs of V. Pogorelov 237. 4 July. 0400-Went on watch. 0407-Report from console of remote control group watch commander Yuriy Yerastov: \"Pressure falling in first loop of after apparatus (reactor-Author). Auxiliary circulating pump started...\" 238. Pressure falling. Emergency protection system dropped. Pump No ... started for maintaining loop water level. Pressure falling. Chief of chemical department Nikolay Vakhrameyev [sic] reports increased activity in turbine compartment. Quarters played aboard ship. 239. Under the direction of engineering department head A. Kozyrev and propulsion division officer Yu. Povstyev, all possible steps were taken to restore first loop pressure and stabilize radioactivity in the power compartments. But a little more than an hour later it became clear that the process of cooling down the damaged reactor was getting out of control and there was a realistic threat of destruction of core channels and melting of fuel elements, which could lead to the reactor's thermal explosion. The only solution was to set up a nonstandard system for flooding (pumping through) the reactor to remove heat from fuel elements. 240. The submarine surfaced at around 0600 hours. Preparation of sixth compartment to perform damage-control work was in full swing. 241. ...Back at the yard during the ship's acceptance, Kozyrev and Povstyev tried to prove to builders that it was necessary to provide such a main line for emergency shut-down cooling of the reactor... Why do we learn only from catastrophes and people's deaths?! 242. ...A steam cloud filled the enclosure after the reactor cover air valve [vozdushnik] was opened. Ionized hydrogen ignited from the flame of electric welding. Such a possibility had been foreseen, fire extinguishing equipment was at the ready, and the fire was put out in a matter of minutes... 243. The sixth compartment damage-control party- Lieutenant Boris Korchilov, Chief Petty Officer Boris Ryzhikov, Petty Officer 1st Class Yuriy Ordochkin, Petty Officer 2nd Class Yevgeniy Kashenkov, and seamen Semen Penkov, Nikolay Savkin and Valeriy Kharitonov- worked in shifts of 2-3 persons. The glass of the self-contained breathing protective masks instantaneously steamed up in the steam and heat of the reactor enclosure and the workers ripped them off and breathed the superradioactive gas -this devilish mixture cannot be called air. 244. As compartment officer, Korchilov went into the enclosure in the most intense moments outside of any sequence, although he knew full well the degree of danger. Kozyrev, Povstyev and Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Krasichkov, a control station man, directly headed work in sixth compartment. Senior lieutenants A. Vasilyev and G. Glushenkov stood watch at propulsion motor Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 control panels in adjacent compartments. 245. Approximately an hour after work began, cooling was supplied to the damaged reactor core according to the nonstandard scheme. In another hour temperature in channels had dropped to a safe level and relatively stabilized. 246. In a sick bay set up in first compartment, Major of Medical Service A. Kosach assisted those who took a direct part in work on the reactor as much as he could. And... he himself was irradiated excessively since, having received enormous doses above that permissible, they essentially became powerful sources of radioactive contamination themselves. 247. PRAVDA told in a rather detailed manner about how two diesel submarines, which had established communications with the Navy and Northern Fleet command centers, came to assist the nuclear powered submarine, how attempts to take the damaged ship in tow ended in failure, and how first the seriously ill, then all the others except party members and those providing control were evacuated to one of the diesel submarines. 248. At approximately 1500 hours Ivan Kulakov, damage-control team leader, discovered a leak in the nonstandard cooling main. They-he himself, assistant commander Vladimir Yenin, and missile-gunnery department rating Leonid Berezov-entered the literally \"glowing\" reactor room and fixed the leak. 249. At around 2300 hours Captain 2nd Rank Zateyev reported to shore yet another time about the ship's condition, the radiation situation and his intention to evacuate remaining crew members to the diesel submarine by 0300 hours on 5 July. 250. 0300-Shore silent. 0400-Shore silent. I leave the ship among the last six persons. Once more I cast a glance at our own submarine rocking on the hollow swell. Our flag is fluttering over her sail. 251. After some time our commander is informed about receipt of a decrypted message from Fleet: Commander Zateyev is to report condition of the ship, number of crew members remaining aboard, and possibility of proceeding to base independently. It is not difficult to guess what the commander said on reading this belated opus, to put it mildly. 252. Later came the rendezvous with a destroyer. It is impossible to express in words how solicitously her crew treated us submariners. The destroyer did not come from base; she was sent after us from sea. Therefore they did not even have reserve clothing for everyone (everything was immediately removed from us and destroyed). Officers, warrant officers and personnel removed their own clothing and gave it to us. Old-time seamen gave up new boots which they had saved for discharge. We said: \"Don't, we are dirty,' this will have to be discarded.\" But they still brought them. They collected money and purchased cigarettes and candy for us in the ship's store... 253. On arrival in Polyarnyy we were put in the hospital, whose staff treated us exceptionally warmly and solicitously. The most seriously injured-Korchilov, Ordochkin, Kashenkov, Penkov, Savkin and Kharitonov-were Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 sent by helicopters to Severomorsk. 254. In the hospital we were met by a Navy Political Directorate representative. After questioning us about the events he began saying that it still was necessary to look carefully into all our actions... Something further was said about objectivity of the critique and about the possibility of heroism of individual submariners... It must be admitted that all these cautious passages were already beyond our understanding. We simply felt distrust. A day later the attitude toward us changed sharply. Delicacies and overseas fruits already appeared at breakfast. After dinner the personnel people suddenly appeared to prepare award citations for all who distinguished themselves. We learned from the words of staff officers that the \"godfather\" of nuclear powered submarines, Academician A. P. Aleksandrov, had visited with a commission the area where the nuclear powered submarine was adrift and, convinced of the safekeeping of the submarine, assessed our actions as proper and courageous. 255. Later it also became known that N. S. Khrushchev phoned several times and inquired about our condition. 256. During 9-10 July those in worst shape were transferred to Leningrad for treatment. The others were sent to a base in Shchukozero on 17 July and then to a sanatorium in Zelenogorsk on 22 August. 257. Unfortunately, despite all their efforts, the physicians did not succeed in saving Boris Korchilov, Yuriy Ordochkin, Yevgeniy Kashenkov, Nikolay Savkin, Valeriy Kharitonov and Semen Penkov. They died in the Moscow Biophysics Institute. Yuriy Povstyev and Boris Ryzhikov passed away several days later. 258. I must admit that today it is surprising to hear that our countrymen are going abroad for bone marrow transplants, for already then in 1961 it was a bone marrow transplant performed by our medical personnel which helped save Ivan Kulakov, Anatoliy Kozyrev, Vladimir Yenin and Mikhail Krasichkov. Just why, 30 years later, can we not save our own patients without the help of foreign physicians? 259. I will not be wrong if I say that many of us who remain alive are obligated to the decisiveness and truly civic position of Commander Nikolay Vladimirovich Zateyev. But years go by and we become fewer. Engineer Anatoliy Kozyrev died suddenly in late 1968. Later Leonid Berezov and Nikolay Vakhromeyev passed away. 260. I recall how back in the hospital after consulting with the officers, the commander decided to recommend Boris Korchilov, Yuriy Ordochkin and Semen Penkov for the Hero of the Soviet Union title. 261. On 5 August 1961 49 crew members were decorated with USSR orders and medals, but not even Korchilov became a Hero and the rank of awards was reduced for the others for unknown reasons. I recall that on 5 August of that same 1961 the country was honoring Hero of the Soviet Union Pilot-Cosmonaut German Titov. Without belittling the services of cosmonaut-heroes, I cannot Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 Approved for Release: 2017/06/16 C00078940 agree that the conscious dash of our comrades to the \"embrasure\" of the reactor was a less heroic act. It deserves the memory and respect of posterity. 262. Photo Captions 263. Engineer-Captain 3rd Rank A. S. Kozyrev, engineering department head of K-19. Photo from early 1980's 264.

NA STRAZHE ZAPOLYARYA, 25 July 1990 266. Thirty Years Later 267. Few today know how a nuclear reactor explosion aboard one of the first Soviet nuclear powered submarines managed to be averted 30 years ago. This page of the \"peaceful atom\" has been kept secret all these years. A difficult lot fell to participants of those far-off events who remained alive. One of them now lives in Minsk. This is Ivan Petrovich Kulakov, who received a radiation dose of over 500 rems during the accident aboard the nuclear powered submarine. 268. At that time Kulakov, chief petty officer of the nuclear powered submarine, was 25 years old. In July 1961 the submarine set a course for a given area of the North Atlantic. All machinery was operating normally, not presaging misfortune. But on 4 July the reactor's emergency protection system"
