Even with the supplement of avia–\n\ntion, inland waterways are still of prime importance wherever roads and railways\n\nhave not as yet been built. It is, therefore, of consequence in relation to\n\nthe Arctic to note on a globe, or on a pole-centered map of the Northern Hemis–\n\nphere, that the Arctic Sea is a mediterranean sea, central with relation to\n\nEurasia and North America, the great rivers so radiating from it that they\n\nfurnish to boats in summer transportation routes to the heart of their conti–\n\nnents. At least four of them have a relation to the Arctic Sea which is like\n\nthat of the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. The Mackenzie reaches 2,000\n\nmiles south into North America; the Ob, Yenisei, and Lena reach equally far\n\nor farther south into Asia.\n\nTo Europeans the rivers, lakes , and the ocean have had their chief trans- —\n\nportation use as liquid highways. If they froze at all, they froze so briefly\n\nthat wein Third person? have thought in terms of navigation seasons and have left the inland\n\nwaterways idle the rest of the year. We have felt similarly about the northern\n\nocean, as valuable around the edges for boat rather than sleigh transportation.\n\n002 | Vol_VII-0632\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice\n\nBut as our culture moves farther north, and as our thinking looks\n\nfarther and farther ahead, it becomes Increasingly hard to reconcile ourselves\n\n[ ?] to using water transport facilities only during summer. In the case of\n\nthe great north-flowing rivers, the season of navigation is less than half\n\nthe year; with the Mackenzie it is considerably less, for that stream runs\n\nthrough Great Slave Lake, and big northern lakes hold their ice in spring\n\nseveral weeks longer than the rivers. Some northern lakes are free of ice\n\nonly a third of the year; the time for sea navigation is in places even briefer.\n\nAccordingly, It is the more important the farther north we are to consider\n\nhow the waters may be used during those parts of the year when they are not\n\nwholly liquid. There are also lands partly or wholly covered by ice, derived\n\nfrom snow which has not melted. This article, then, considers some of the\n\nuses of ice, under thres heads: L l ake and river ice, sea ice, salt water ice, and inland or snow — —\n\nice. We have in mind chiefly the lands and seas north of 60° N. latitude,\n\nand chiefly the uses connected with transportation but also those which re–\n\nlate to encampment or residence.\n\nAVIATION USES\n\nLength of Ice Season . Excepting parts of the south coast of Alaska, the\n\nwhole of Iceland, and portions of the Scandinavian p P eninsula, lake ice north\n\nof 60° can be used fox airplane descents landing take-offs for six or more\n\nmonths a year, and river ice almost as long. In some parts, lake ice is\n\nusable for eight months and even longer.\n\nCoastal salt water ice is good for airplane use along few coasts for\n\nmore than seven to eight months. The variation ranges from no availability\n\nat all in southern Alaska, around Iceland , and around the northern shores of —\n\n003 | Vol_VII-0633\n\nEA-I. Stefansson Uses of Ice\n\nthe Scandinavian peninsula, to a maximum of perhaps ten months around Peary\n\nLand and Northern Land (Severnaya Zemlya).\n\nSalt water drift ice, as distinguished from pack ice (for definitions\n\nsee Glossary), is never, properly speaking, usable for air fields, although —\n\nit may serve for emergency landings — has, in. fact, been so used on many\n\noccasions.\n\nIn the pack region of the Arctic Sea, the season for air - base use varies —\n\nbetween seven or eight months near the outer edge of the pack to nine or ten\n\nmonths near its center. This refers to landing strips that can be maintained\n\nin first-rate operating condition. Air bases for what type aircraft? can function through, the twelve months\n\nin the central pack, with the qualification that from late June to early\n\nSeptember it will be difficult to maintain good landing conditions.\n\nInland or glacier ice, with exceptions which will be brought out, is\n\nsuitable for planes at all times of year. This form of ice has been found\n\nespecially useful in summer; during winter it has generally proved more\n\nconvenient to land upon river, lake , or coastal sea ice. The unavailability —\n\nof these three ice forms in midsummer is compensated for, in some places,\n\nby the permanent availability of glaciers. For instance, at the most northerly\n\nair base permanently occupied before World War II — Rudolf Island in the\n\nFranz Josef group — planes used sea ice during winter but land ice during\n\nsummer.\n\nRarity of Land Ice in Arctic . It is important to keep in mind, with\n\nregard to the Arctic, that land ice is by no means as common or persistent\n\nas we used to believe. Irrespective of latitude, ice which is formed from\n\nsnow does not endure from one winter to the next in large sheets, except on\n\n004 | Vol_VII-0634\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice\n\nmountains or near enough to them so that glaciers can spread from the high to\n\nthe low land. Even small sheets are rare in the Arctic, for in only a few\n\nplaces do snowdrifts persist, then usually in east-west ravines which are so\n\ndeep that the sun does not strike, or, in rare cases, along the north slopes\n\nof hills, (The reason that a northward slope often fails to preserve snow,\n\nin the most northerly countries, is that the night sun strikes from the north.)\n\nLAKE AND RIVER ICE\n\nAir Stations Dependent on Rivers —\n\nAir Stations Dependent on Rivers . The use of river ice for airplane landings is well known to all who have\n\nbeen connected with pioneer flying in lands of cold winters; for such fields\n\nhave no doubt exceeded in number all others combined, during the pioneer stage.\n\nAlthough better than rivers, lakes have been less used because trading\n\nposts and villages are usually located along rivers. There was the advantage,\n\ntoo, that (in the days before radio aids) airplanes could find their way along\n\nvalleys or by hitting them at some predetermined angle.\n\nAmong the well-known river landing fields in Canada were those at Fort\n\nNelson, on the Nelson River, and at Fort Norman and Norman Wells, on the Mac–\n\nkenzie. In Alaska, the ice of the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Colville, Canning, and\n\nother rivers furnished the usual winter landing fields, although lake ice was\n\nused by a few towns. The history was similar in northern Eurasia.\n\nDrawbacks of r R iver Ice Fields . In comparison with lake fields, which can —\n\nusually be laid out so that they are wide enough for take-offs in any direction,\n\na river field has the disadvantage that descents and take-offs are necessarily\n\n005 | Vol_VII-0635\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice\n\nupstream or downstream. However, this difficulty is mitigated by the circum–\n\nstance that in deep valleys the winds usually blow up or down, not crosswise\n\nof the river bed.\n\nAnother disadvantage of river fields, in comparison to lakes, is that\n\nwhere currents are at all strong it is likely that thin ice will form in autumn\n\nand then break, to refreeze with many of the ice blocks standing on edge at\n\nvarious angles. If this sort of broken ice cannot be avoided, it has to be\n\nleveled with pickaxes or by other methods. Usually this ice is so fragile\n\nthat it is not difficult to break with machinery of the bulldozer type, or\n\nto crush with heavy rollers.\n\nExcept for the difficulties already implied, the problem of keeping a\n\nriver ice field level in winter is the same as that of keeping a neighboring\n\nland field in good condition.\n\nLengthening the Season . If nature is allowed to take its course on a\n\nriver, there is the special difficulty that after the freeze-up a heavy snow–\n\nfall may come along which puts down an insulating blanket such that the river\n\ncurrent eats the ice away to a point where it becomes unsafely thin, or may\n\neven disappear, leaving no roofing over the water, in certain spots, except\n\nthe snow. This trouble can be obviated by, removing, rolling or tramping ? tamping down the snow\n\nafter each fall, to change it from a poor to a good conductor.\n\nCare in tramping down or rolling the first snowfall permits the use of\n\nthe field earlier in autumn. This is only half the advantage; for the gradual\n\nbuilding up of compressed snow, snow concrete (see (Glossary), will lengthen\n\nthe use of the field from a week to three weeks in the spring. The advan–\n\ntages come chiefly under two heads, those of the avoidance of both thaw–\n\nwater puddles and candle-ice formation.\n\n006 | Vol_VII-0636\n\nEA I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nAvoidance of Puddles . If the landing strips are rolled after each snow–\n\nfall you gradually build thorn up higher than the surrounding ice and snow.\n\nThen, when the spring thaws come, the water trickles to where it can gather\n\nin the low places, thus draining off the landing s trips, with resulting —\n\nlessened trouble from slush and standing water.\n\nBesides, the thicker the ice the longer it takes to thaw, and the ice\n\nbeneath will be much thicker where the snow has been rolled than in other\n\nplaces alongside where the better Insulation against atmospheric chill, due to\n\nsnow fluffiness, will have prevented the ice from thickening as rapidly. This\n\nadvantage, however, may prove to be less than that from the prevention of\n\ncandling.\n\nCandle Ice . One of the differences between fresh and salt water ice is\n\nthat when salty ice thaws the process is gradual and works from the outside,\n\nafter a manner to which we are accustomed through seeing ice melt in a water\n\nglass. Bat large outdoor formations of fresh water ice, in addition to thawing\n\nin the way we look upon as normal, will disintegrate through a process known.\n\nas candling. This is the formation of ice crystals that are sort of pencil–\n\nshaped and vertical, each of them with a length (at right angles to the surface\n\nof river or lake) equal to the full thickness of the ice. These candles are\n\nseparated by films of water so that, when the condition is just right, you\n\ncould go out on fresh - water ice which is three or four feet thick and push —\n\na rod of wood, such as a broom handle, right down through into the water\n\nbeneath.\n\nFew things are more surprising to the inexperienced than the behavior of\n\n007 | Vol_VII-0637\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\ncandle ice. For instance, it may happen during the break-up of a river that\n\nchunks of ice as big as pianos will be thrown up on the river bank. If these\n\nare composed of candle ice, then as you walk past them you can give each a\n\nsmart blow with a light club and the whole ice boulder will slide apart,\n\nflattening out into a heap composed of Innumerable ice candles. —\n\nEven more striking is it to watch a dog that has been thrown into open\n\nwater adjoining a field of candle ice, which may be as much as three feet\n\nthick. When the dog swims toward the ice and gets his front paws up on it,\n\npreparatory to climbing out, the candles will give way and he will sort of\n\nswim or scratch his way Into the apparently solid ice, making a canal for\n\nhimself of perhaps several feet, or even yards, before he comes to the point\n\nwhere the ice has enough supporting power to enable him to get on top of it.\n\nBut snow concrete, formed on a lake or river airfield by the compression\n\nof repeated snowfalls, does not candle. The field then has on its runways\n\na different sort of ice from that on either side of them. This structural dif–\n\nference can by itself make a favorable seasonal time difference, in the\n\nlasting of runways in the spring, of anything from a few days to one or two\n\nweeks.\n\nIt appears that candling (of each ice as will candle) takes place only\n\nunder the influence of direct sunlight. River and lake ice seemingly does\n\nnot candle so long as it has an unthawed snow cover.\n\nQualifying Statements . It is only in a few places that rivers break up\n\nby direct thawing from sunlight delivered at a given spot; they more usually\n\nbreak up by relatively warm streams beginning to flow on top of the ice, which\n\nstreams derive their water from small tributaries and from rivulets flowing\n\n008 | Vol_VII-0638\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice\n\ndown the banks. It is, therefore, on lakes rather than rivers that the\n\nfull effects which we have tried to describe are noted.\n\nAs we shall bring out later, it is possible so to locate two or more\n\nlake fields in the vicinity of an airport that one shall be receptive to\n\nflying boats when another is in condition to receive wheel or ski planes.\n\nThis is scarcely possible on a river. Rivers therefore have longer periods\n\nthan lakes during which the ice is not strong enough for land craft and\n\nthe water not open enough for sea craft.\n\nNaturally it is often possible to have a river airport so located that\n\na lake suitable for airplane landings descents is near; then the difference in\n\nfreezing dates of autumn, and again of thawing dates in spring, can be uti–\n\nlized so as to lengthen the active season of that airport.\n\nAir Stations Dependent on Lakes\n\nAir Stations Dependent on Lakes. In most of the Arctic, and in much of the Subarctic, the ground is per–\n\nmanently frozen below a certain level. Where the subsoil is frozen there\n\ncan be no underground drainage and, without that sort of drainage, there\n\nare bound to be innumerable lakes. In hilly country, where the main determi–\n\nnants are the contours, these lakes will average large but will cover usually\n\nless than 25% of the ground. Where the land is gently rolling or level, the\n\nlakes may cover more than 50% of the surface; but these lakes will average\n\nsmaller and more shallow.\n\nAlternative Landing Fields for a Single Air Base . In rolling country,\n\nit is usually possible to locate hangers and other structures so that there will\n\nbe available in different directions alternative lake landing fields. Many\n\n009 | Vol_VII-0639\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nlakes differ so in freezing and thawing characteristics , that the time gap —\n\ncan be closed, nearly or quite, which on rivers intervenes between the\n\nperiods of safe ice and safe open water.\n\nDeep lakes freeze slowly, shallow ones more rapidly. If a base has\n\nnear it both a deep and a shallow lake, then it may be possible to continue\n\nin autumn using the deep one for water gear, perhaps nearly or quite to the\n\npoint where the shallow lake becomes safe for land gear. (Naturally, in\n\norder to make the shallow lake usable earlier, the snow will be rolled after\n\nevery fall and converted into concrete so as to prevent its acting as a\n\nblanket that [ ?] slows down ice formation.)\n\nIn the spring, shallow lakes thaw out faster than deep ones. Although\n\nwe are being repe t itious, overlapping the river ice section of this paper, —\n\nwe go here into some detail as to how the thawing of the ice on the deep\n\nlake can be delayed while the thaw on the shallow lake is being advanced.\n\nProtecting the Deep Ice Lake . As explained already in the river dis–\n\ncussion, a main consideration in spring, to prolong the ski and wheel landing\n\nseason, is to prevent the ice from candling. On a lake, even though no more —\n\nthan two or three strips running in different directions are needed upon which\n\nto descend and take off, it might be advisable to roll the entire field,\n\ntherefore , several square miles. This need not be difficult, for very heavy —\n\nrollers are not required to compress snow if the rolling is done immediate l ly —\n\nafter each snowfall. Since the rollers are light, they can be very wide,\n\nand the number of back-and-forth trips in covering the whole field will not\n\nbe great.\n\nIf the airfield, then, has several [ ?] square miles of ice, all of them\n\n010 | Vol_VII-0640\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nwith an upper layer of snow concret e , then there will be sufficient strength —\n\nso that, even if the untreated ice round about becomes very weak or even —\n\ndisintegrates, there still is an ice island from which planes can operate.\n\nObviously, we do not have in mind here indefinite operation, but merely the\n\nlengthening of the possibility of the use of land gear by a few days.\n\nAccelerating the Thaw on the Shallow Lake . To advance the thawing of\n\nan ice airfield, the principle is [ ?] employed that the sun delivers no heat\n\nhut only light that is converted into heat by absorption. This absorption\n\nis least on spotless white snow; it is greatest on a black surface. Several\n\nmethods then suggest themselves for speeding up the thaw on a shallow lake,\n\nso as to prepare it for an early reception of water-equipped airplanes.\n\nIf there is sand anywhere nearby, the easiest thing may be to hitch\n\na sand sprinkler to the rear of a tractor and sprinkle the lake, or the parts\n\nof it where early melting is wanted. Sand must be lightly spread and Care must be taken to use just the\n\nright amount of sand. Each grain Each grain or pebble must be separated ? must be separated from all others;\n\nfor if the deposit is a continuous layer it forms a blanket over the ice,\n\nwhich, true enough, gets hot with the sun but which has an insulating power\n\nthat tends to protect the ice beneath it from thawing.\n\nThe chief difficulty about using this process is the possibility that\n\nsnow will fall just after the field has been sprinkled with sand. A thing\n\nof importance, then, is the accuracy of weather forecasting; there should\n\nbe at least a day of sunshine between the sprinkling operation and the next\n\nsnowfall. When the snowfall does come, the new snow will have to be sprinkled,\n\nto give the sun a purchase.\n\n011 | Vol_VII-0641\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nBetter than sand may be black, dirty oil, like crankcase oil. The plan\n\nwould be, then, throughout the winter, to save all the dirty grease possible,\n\nfor use in the spring as a blackener, In place of sand.\n\nA third way, and perhaps the best, Is to sprinkle lampblack, or some\n\nother dark powder, over the snow from airplanes in the manner used when\n\ndusting an orchard with insecticide, or, Indeed, after the manner of laying\n\na smoke scree n . —\n\nThe method just described; ordinarily with sand, has been used by polar\n\nexplorers when they have wanted to destroy in the spring the ice which was\n\nImmediately around ships that were wintering, so that each ship could come to\n\nfloat in a basin of water while the ice round about was still strong. It —\n\nhas not been uncommon for ships to float free several weeks before the ice\n\nthawed generally in the bay where they were wintering.\n\nOne place where melting with dirty oil has been in long use is Lake\n\nBennett on the Yukon River, downstream from Whitehorse. What they have done\n\nthere, in springs, is to trundle beck and forth with their sprinklers until\n\nthey have covered a belt about two or three times as wide as a steamer. This\n\nbelt thaws out, making [ ?] a canal through the ice. In some years this Lake Bennett canalizing has worked very well, giving\n\npassage to steamers across the lake from one to three weeks ahead of the\n\ngeneral thaw. (In the North, rivers thaw from one to several weeks ahead of\n\nlakes through which they flow ). .) In other years the canal scheme has not worked —\n\nwell because the ice on one side o f r the other of the channel became loose from\n\nthe shore and floated in, closing the thoroughfare.\n\n¶ To prevent this sort of\n\nthing, one would preferably use, for an air base landing field, a lake of\n\n012 | Vol_VII-0642\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nsuch moderate size that it would be feasible to sprinkle the whole of it\n\nfor early melting. Even so, it would not really be necessary to melt away the whole sur–\n\nface. It would be enough to clear one end : for lake ice does not move except —\n\nunder the pressure of the wind, which means that, with a south wind, there\n\nis open water in the southern part of the lake; with a north wind, the north\n\nend of the lake would he open. Planes would then descend at whichever end\n\nwas ice-free.\n\nThe Cooperation of Rivers and Lakes . Instead of using two lakes, one\n\nshallow and the other deep, the same result can be attained by using a deep\n\nlake which has a considerable river that enters one side or end, there being\n\nno corresponding stream which enters opposite. n the spring the river pours\n\nwarm water upon the lake ice in its vicinity, melting out in one part a space\n\nsuitable for pontoon craft and flying boats, while at the far side the ice\n\nremains relatively firm. This arrangement may reduce or even close the spring\n\ntransportation gap by having wheeled planes descending on ice far from the river\n\nalmost or quite up to the time when watercraft can use the river mouth.\n\nKeeping Lake Ice Level . Unless a lake is very large, say ten or more miles\n\nin diameter, ice will form on it smooth and level in the autumn, except per–\n\nhaps right near shore. There will be, then, no such problem in leveling it\n\noriginally as one may have on a river.\n\nIf the lake is in a forest, or other sheltered location, there will be\n\nlittle bother from winds and snowdrifts, so the only problem will be to roll\n\nthe field after each snowfall. But many lakes are so windy that snowdrifts\n\n013 | Vol_VII-0643\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nwill form. Then the problem of leveling the drifts, and keeping the ice field —\n\nin the right condition, will be the same as on land.\n\nVariable Time Element . The freeze-up of rivers and lakes is so dependent\n\nupon a number of things other than the season that a separate timetable is\n\nneeded for each section of a river and for each lake. A good library will have\n\nthis information available for many rivers and lakes. In the Arctic?\n\nLakes are even more variable than rivers. For instance, there will be a\n\ndifference of several weeks between the freeze-up of McTavish Arm, in Great\n\nBear Lake, and that of small lakes in the immediate neighborhood which are,\n\nnevertheless; big enough for air base purposes.\n\nAn example of the difference between lakes and rivers is that, where the\n\nMackenzie River passes through Great Slave Lake, the ice on the lake will\n\nhinder steamboat navigation in some seasons for more than a month after the\n\nriver, both north and south of the lake, is free of ice.\n\nSpeaking roughly, the ice of lakes in northern Greenland, or in the more\n\nnortherly Eurasian and Canadian islands, can be used by ski and wheel planes\n\nnine or ten months per year. In the middle Canadian islands the lake ice can\n\nbe used seven or eight months. In the northern part of the North American\n\nor Asiatic mainland it can be used six or seven eight months.\n\nSALT WATER ICE\n\nCoastal Ice\n\nCoastal ice falls into three main subdivisions: I i ce foot, bay and lagoon —\n\nice, and landfast ice.\n\n014 | Vol_VII-0644\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nIce Foot . This type, as distinguished from the more general landfast ice,\n\nis found on shores which have considerable [ ?] rise and fall of tide.\n\nMost arctic shores have small tides; for instance, the north coast of Alaska\n\nand of northwestern Canada into Coronation Gulf, and the channels which run\n\neastward from the Gulf , have tides that range between six inches and two —\n\nfeet, insufficient to form a proper ice foot. But other coasts have consi–\n\nderable tides. There, in autumn, a certain width of ice will adhere to the\n\nland, freezing to the bottom and refusing to fall and rise with the tide.\n\nThis is the ice foot.\n\nThe ice outside the tide crack, which does rise and fall, will never\n\nbe higher than the ice foot; for, if it were, then there would be a flooding\n\nof water inward along the top of the shorefast ice, this water freezing\n\nand adding enough to its thickness for making the surface of the ice foot level\n\nwith the highest tide.\n\nThere are not many places where the ice foot is wide enough so that an air–\n\nfield could be laid out which has landing strips at right angles to the shore.\n\nUsually such runways would have to be parallel to the shore. This ice is seldom\n\nvery level originally, and so would have to be leveled with pickaxes or mechani–\n\ncal levelers.\n\nBay and Lagoon Ice . Bays and lagoons are usually of such limited size that\n\nlarge waves do not form, so their ice is normally level; or else it has small\n\nsnags of broken ice, like those of rivers which have a strong current, and they\n\nare easily leveled with pickaxes or machinery.\n\nBay ice occurs on practically all coasts in the Arctic. The lagoon variant\n\nof bay ice is found chiefly off low coasts. There are some lagoons to the south-\n\n015 | Vol_VII-0645\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nwest of Point Barrow, on Alaska’s northwest shore. To the southeast of Barrow\n\nis first a chain of lagoons which runs toward Cape Simpson, and then another\n\nchain which begins east of the Colville River and extends to Flaxman Island,\n\nwith smaller lagoons east toward the international boundary. We discuss these\n\nas typical for many other coasts.\n\nBetween the sand bars and islands of the chain that fences off the\n\nnorthern Alaska lagoons are openings deep enough for floe ice to drift in during\n\nsummer. Some years there will be a considerable number of these vagrant hum–\n\nmocks scattered through the lagoons, particularly in such places as behind Cross\n\nIsland, east of the Colville, where the entrance channels are fai l r ly deep.\n\nIt will not be difficult, however, to find areas free from the drifting chunks\n\n(that have been set fast when the bay ice formed) aid which are big enough for\n\nlanding fields containing strips laid out in any direction.\n\nIn selecting a bay or lagoon landing field, one would keep in mind, among\n\nother things, that the location should be ordinarily reachable by drifting sand;\n\nfor, as explained, sand grains on ice produce an early break-up in the spring,\n\nshortening the season during which the field can be of use. And, for a similar\n\nreason, a field should not be off the mouth of a river, for the warm water from\n\nit will break up the ice early in the spring.\n\nThere is, however, the same consideration here as with lake ice, that it\n\nmay be desirable to have in mind landing facilities for both wheeled planes and\n\nflying boats. Usually a bay or lagoon field can be so located that, although\n\nnot exposed either to drifting sand or to river water , , it will nevertheless be —\n\nonly a reasonable distance from another area base which has early melting\n\ndue to sand storms or river flow. The base would then have, in spring, on one\n\n016 | Vol_VII-0646\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nside of it ice still strong enough for wheeled planes, while on the other side\n\nthere would be water lending facilities.\n\nFor hay and lagoon operations, as for those oa on an ice foot, hangars and —\n\nother buildings will no doubt be on an adjacent shore. The field must be\n\nfar enough from all buildings so that snowdrifts formed in their ice do not\n\nextend out upon the landing strips.\n\nLandfast i I ce . Apart from the special variants already discussed, winter —\n\nice [ ?] in the Arctic which is landfast may vary in breadth, as measured from\n\nthe shore, between a few feet and several hundred miles. Among places which\n\nhave only a few feet or a few yards of landfast ice, even toward the end of\n\nwinter, are promontories like Cape Lisburne in northwestern Alaska, Cape Lyon\n\nin northwestern arctic Canada, Nelson Head, at the south tip of Banks Island,\n\nand various promontories among the Svalbard and Franz Josef Islands. Off the\n\nmouth of the Mackenzie River lie, in winter, from thirty to sixty miles of\n\nlandfast ice. The greatest known width of this type is in the New Siberian\n\nIsland section of the northeastern Soviet Union, where the landfast ice may\n\nbe up to 270 miles in [ ?] width toward the end of winter, as off the mouth of\n\nthe Yana River.\n\n“Typical” Landfast Ice . A case history of the formation of landfast ice\n\nis more explanatory than a description.\n\nWith no slush previously in the sea, the first frost of the year may pro–\n\nduce only a few inches or a few feet of very thin ice which adheres to the\n\nshore along one edge, the rest of it, as a floating apron, rising and falling\n\nwith any gentle wave motion. For salt water ice is not brittle like glass,\n\n017 | Vol_VII-0647\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nbut is more of the consistency of ice cream, and, in that sense, flexible.\n\nMore often, however, there is adrift in the sea near shore a mass of sludge\n\nice, a kind of ice porridge, and a night of calm frost may produce a harden–\n\ning of this to the width of several feet or yards, and sometimes hundreds of\n\nfeet or hundreds of yards. This belt of landfast ice may continue growing\n\nfor several nights until an expense of it one or several miles wide fringes\n\nthe lend, none of it strong enough for a man to walk upon , but all of it, —\n\nnevertheless, a single sheet.\n\nNow in case of an offshore wind, particularly if accompanied by a rise\n\nof water, all this ice — excepting a few inches or feet near shore — will\n\ngo adrift and disappear seaward. But if the wind blows from the sea, and\n\nparticularly if there are drifting floes offshore, the ice apron will be crushed\n\nup and pressed toward land. We have, then, in case of only a moderate pressure,\n\nthe formation of smell ice ridges, from a few inches to a few feet in height\n\nand lying mainly parallel to the shore, but with others at various angles.\n\nIf this sort of pressure is followed by a calm, there is a cementing to–\n\ngether of the various blocks, which have been pressed upon edge with their\n\nflat sides meeting each other. This makes such a strong fortification of the\n\nshore that, even though stiff gales come later from seaward, and even if these\n\nbring in heavy drift ice, the apron of shore ice will likely become permanent\n\nfor the year.\n\nWhat usually takes place in such a case as we are describing is that a\n\nbig pressure ridge forms anything from several hundred yards to several miles\n\nfrom shore, this ridge becoming firmly grounded because of being heaped so\n\nhigh that its weight presses heavily against the sea bottom. For the time\n\n018 | Vol_VII-0648\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nbeing at least, this ridge marks the outer edge of the landfast ice.\n\nOn the outside of the heavy pressure ridge is the shore lead, or whet the\n\nYankee whalers in northern Alaska used to call the shore flaw (so written, but\n\npronounced usually as if spelled floe or flow). This flaw is, then, the meet–\n\ning place of the landfast ice with the moving pack, and may be represented\n\nat different times by an open lead several miles wide, by [ ?] a narrow water–\n\nfilled, crack, by grinding ice that is moving past the landfast ridge, or by\n\nice frozen to the shore ridge and temporarily immobile but ready to go\n\nadrift, particularly with a combined rise of water and increase of wind.\n\nTake Flaxman Island as an example: The original flaw may be three or\n\nfour miles from shore and this may continue throughout the winter. However,\n\nit can happen, under special circumstances, that heavy pressure will pro–\n\nduce another ridge half a mile, or even a mile, farther out at sea, which\n\nwill be so firmly grounded that the ice between the original and the new\n\nflaw may remain immobile all winter.\n\nBut experience has taught the seal hunters to the north of Alaska that\n\nthis second ridge, and second belt of shore ice, cannot be relied upon to\n\nstay put. There was, for instance, the case of the Stefansson party of\n\n1914 when they were about to start sledge travel northward from the coast of\n\nAlaska at Martin Point and were five or six miles from land upon ice that\n\nhad formed between the first and second ridges — ice that normally would\n\nhave stayed the whole year. In thin case a gale sprang up so violent and\n\nwith such a rise of “storm tide” (probably six or seven feet) that the second\n\npressure ridge floated free of the sea bottom end went adrift, with its\n\n019 | Vol_VII-0649\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nadjacent Ice, carrying the party with it, so that when the gale cleared the next\n\nday they were twenty or thirty miles from land and forty or fifty miles east\n\nof where the camp had been pitched originally.\n\nThe picture we have tried to draw applies to the formation of land ice\n\nthat is going to be five miles wide, as off Flaxman Island, fifty miles wide,\n\nas off the Mackenzie delta, or two hundred miles wide, as off northeastern\n\nSiberia. Of course, the process is more complicated the wider the shelf of\n\nlandfast ice.\n\nTo make a reasonable determination as to whether shore ice is safe\n\nfor the building of temporary winter airports, we need more knowledge and\n\nexperience than can be reduced to writing in a brief statement, if it be\n\ndesired to have the base as far as possible from shore. However, an\n\nobserver can tell by mere common sense, even without much experience, that\n\ncertain parts near shore are definitely safe.\n\nLeveling an Airfield . A landing field on shore ice is, in its pris–\n\ntine stage, usually different from bay or lagoon ice in that a good deal\n\nof it will require leveling with picks or machinery. Leveling an ice field\n\nis simple, compared to leveling a rough field composed of frozen earth.\n\nTrue, salt ice (unless very young and therefore slushy) is tougher than fresh\n\nice, and does not splinter so easily; but this difference between fresh and\n\nsalt ice is negligible compared with the extreme toughness and unworkability\n\nof frozen muck.\n\nThe problem of using heavy machinery for leveling fields on sea ice\n\nwill be discussed in relation to stations maintained on the pack.\n\n020 | Vol_VII-0650\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nThe Time Element . On lagoons and bays, such as those along the north\n\ncoast of Alaska, the ice near shore may become firm enough for dog - sledge —\n\ntravel in middle or late September. There is, in this respect, a seasonal\n\nvariation of perhaps five or six weeks. The very earliest sledging season\n\nbegins in this locality around or just before the middle of September, while\n\na corresponding stage may not be reached in another year until late in October. , —\n\nEven for the lightest ski planes, the season will be a bit later than\n\nfor dog sledging. There will be few years when heavy wheeled planes can\n\nsafely descend land on northern Alaska lagoons before late October. However, the\n\npreparation of the landing strips can begin before the ice is strong enough\n\nfor planes to use it. This preparation, as already indicated, is in the main\n\nto roll the field after each snowfall, to produce a snow concrete surfacing.\n\nIn a very [ ?] early spring, difficulty with the ice on North Alaska\n\nlagoons may start the first or second week of May. Fields properly selected\n\nand tended, as discussed heretofore, may nevertheless be usable into late May.\n\nOn ice that extends far offshore, autumn use will start a little later\n\nthan on coastal lagoons --in practice, at least a month later, because the\n\nrisk to men and equipment of working far from land is considerable during the\n\nearly part of the season, while near shore the risk is small. Similarly, the\n\ndanger that ice may go adrift under a violent gale and a sharp rise of storm\n\ntide also is considerable. The general principle will be, then, that for\n\nboth earliness of season and for safety it is better to have the air field —\n\non a bay or lagoon than to have it on shore ice, unless very near a beach\n\nthat has shoal water offshore.\n\nBut a field located on shore ice immediately outside of a lagoon may, in\n\n021 | Vol_VII-0651\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nsome years, be usable later into the spring season than if on lagoon ice, with\n\na possible maximum difference of two or three weeks. So the leader of an ex–\n\npedition may think it worth while to level off, outside of the lagoons, a\n\ntemporary field for use during two or three extra weeks in the spring.\n\nThe foregoing is with reference to northern Alaska and northern Canada;\n\nthe autumn freeze-up begins, however, somewhat earlier to the east of Cape\n\nParry, and the spring break-up a little later. On the Siberian shore ice, the\n\nsparing break-up will be a little later than off the Canadian mainland, and\n\nthe autumn freeze-up a bit earlier.\n\nProceeding north among the Canadian islands, the autumn freeze-up be- —\n\ncomes earlier and the spring break-up later. For a rough comparison with the\n\neastern north coast of Alaska, the season of usable bay ice will be a month\n\nlonger near islands like Banks and Victoria, two months longer on the north\n\ncoast of Melville Island, and a bit longer still in islands farther north\n\nthan Melville.\n\nDrift Ice\n\nOutside the shore flaw is the belt of drift ice which separates the nor–\n\nmally stationery shore ice from the heavy pack. This middle area will contain\n\nin winter somethng less than 20% of all the ice of the northern sea. The floes\n\nand fields which make up the drift are in such rapid motion, and are so rela–\n\ntively fragile, that we do not consider them as po possible air stations of semi–\n\npermanence, even if only a month or two were in mind.\n\nBut the floes and fields of the drift are nevertheless of aviation sig–\n\nnificance, for many of them have received safe descents by airplanes in dis-\n\n022 | Vol_VII-0652\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\ntress. Take-offs have usually proved successful also, when it proved feasible\n\nto remedy the trouble which brought the plane down. We do not follow this up,\n\nhowever, for we deal here not with the general problem of flight safety in the\n\nArctic Sea but only with the feasible use of semipermanent airports.\n\nPack Ice\n\nTriple Classification of Sea Ice . On the basis of how things are in late\n\nwinter, the ice of the northern polar sea may be classified under three heads:\n\n( 1 1 ) about 15% or 20% landfast; ( 2 2 ) about 15% or 20% drifting and of such —\n\nnature that next summer it will be penetrable by stout surface vessels; ( 3 3 ) —\n\nthe remainder, 60% or 70%, also in motion though more sluggish than the “drift”\n\nsection, and of such nature that it will not be penetrable next summer even\n\nby the best icebre k a kers we now have.\n\nAs already brought out, we consider that air bases can be maintained\n\nsatisfactorily on the landfast ice for a considerable part of the year, on\n\nthe drift ice for no part of the year, and on pack ice for the whole year —\n\nwith the provision that landing conditions in the pack are not going to be\n\ngood during the “summer months,” which poor season is of longer duration near\n\nthe edges of the pack than toward its center.\n\nNatural Thickening of Ice . As to the safety of drifting air bases and\n\nresearch stations, and the ease and safety of operations like hunting, sledge\n\ntravel , and emergency landings, it is important to consider how sea ice thickens —\n\nwith age and changes in character.\n\nIt has been considered that, with a “normal” amount of snow covering, sea\n\nice far from land will develop a thickness of from seven to nine feet the first\n\nyear, two additional feet the second year, with a [ ?] maximum of thirteen feet no\n\n023 | Vol_VII-0653\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nmatter how many years are involved. These figures must be treated as rather\n\nvague approximations, for there is no defining what is a “normal” amount of\n\nsnow covering.\n\nFrom considerations already advanced, it appears that additional snow\n\nhinders the thickening of ice. Also, the insulating qualities of snow vary\n\nwith the kind of snow — a fluffy cover of three inches would probably have\n\na greater insulating power than a wind-packed snowdrift of six inches.\n\nThen, snow undergoes a granulating change during winter; the more granular\n\nthe snow, the less efficient it is as an insulator.\n\nPaleocrystic Ice . For that semipermanence which is desired for an air\n\nbase in the pack, and for safety, an extensive field of paleocrystic ice\n\nwould be chosen. For this ice, five years or more old, combines the two\n\nnecessary qualities: the greatest available thickness and the relative fewness\n\nof snags and high projecting ridges.\n\nThere are considerable areas within the pack where paleocrystic ice re–\n\npresents 5%, 10%, or even more, of the total surface, occasional fields of\n\nit being several miles in diameter — some perhaps twenty or even thirty\n\nmiles wide. It is rare, however, that these vast fields are wholly paleo–\n\ncrystic, for most of them have cracked here or there, with resulting pressure\n\nridges formed one or several years ago. These ridges have not yet been\n\nrounded down fully by rain and sun and thus have not attained true paleocrystic\n\ncharacter.\n\nThickness of Paleocrystic Ice . No one questions that, for average thick–\n\nness, paleocrystic floes excel all others, but this is about all that is known\n\ndefi d nitely. However, there is some apparently reliable theory.\n\n024 | Vol_VII-0654\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nA true paleocrystic floe or field, of some age above five years, in the\n\nheaviest ice that can be found within the basin of the arctic mediterranean;\n\nand, it more than 200 miles from land, is in a district of relatively gentle\n\npressures. Paleocrystic ice presents, on a lower scale, the same visual ef–\n\nfect as a snow-covered rolling prairie, such as in western Kansas, the Dakotas,\n\nor Saskatchewan. All sharp angles have disappeared, the pressure ridges that\n\nformerly appeared like small, jagged mountains now remind of gently rolling\n\ngrassland that is sufficiently snow-covered to hide the grass.\n\nThe greatest upward extensions of paleocrystic ice, the knolls, are swept\n\nclear of snow by each considerable wind that blows. From the known greater\n\ntemperature conductivity of ice than snow, it is to be assumed that, wherever\n\nthere is an upward swell of ice to make a knoll, there is a corresponding\n\ndownward swelling on the submerged side of the ice. For the low surface\n\nspots are filled with relatively non - conducting snow almost level with the —\n\ntops of the knolls. These knolls were originally the diminutive but craggy\n\nmountain ranges of broken blocks forming pressure ridges. Each upward–\n\nprojecting peak was likely repr e sented originally by a deep and ma xx ss ive base, —\n\ncaused by pressure at the time the ridge was formed. Each knoll or peak may\n\nhe thought of as pyramid-shaped, with the wide base submerged.\n\nIt does not follow, then, from the known laws of ice buoyancy, that for\n\nevery one foot of emerging ice there are five, six, or seven feet of submerged\n\nice. Actually a pressure ridge that rises 60 feet above sea leve l may not\n\nindicate more than perhaps 100 feet of draft. The observation of the Stefans–\n\nson expeditions is that sea ice rarely, if ever, grounds in more than about\n\n120 feet. Admiral Peary was consulted on this and replied that 20 fathoms\n\n025 | Vol_VII-0655\n\nEA I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nwas the greatest depth in which he had ever noticed sea ice aground (sea ice\n\nhere not including ice foot chunks and, of course, not including icebergs).\n\nIf a pyramid-shaped or wedge-shaped pressure ridge has, soon after its\n\nformation, a maximum draft of 120 feet, it appears safe to assume that some\n\nyears later, in the paleocrystic stage, it would draw at least half of this.\n\nTo be very conservative, we will divide that estimate by two and assume here\n\nonly a quarter of the draft indicated by the Peary and Stefansson observa–\n\ntions. We would then have a rounded knoll which rises 10 feet above sea\n\nlevel with a submerged portion of 30 feet, making a total maximum paleo–\n\ncrystic floe thickness of 40 feet.\n\nIn the case of those portions of paleocrystic floes which are thickly\n\ncrowded on their top surface with knolls, we might assume that the base sec–\n\ntions of the various wedges or pyramids would coalesce on the under surface,\n\nor nearly so. However, the glare knolls are separated on their upper surface\n\nby bowl-shaped and channel-formed intervening spaces that are filled in winter\n\nwith snow insulator. From the universal agreement that the sea ice does not\n\nbecome more than 13 feet thick through successive freezings, it would seem\n\nthat a thickness greater than 13 feet would not persist in areas which during\n\nsummer are covered with puddles of water, and therefore during winter with\n\nthick snow insulation.\n\nThere is, then, something of a contradiction between two theories. Accord–\n\ning to one, the thawing of submerged parts of the ice equals the freezing, after\n\n13 feet have been attained; according to the other (a view based partly on\n\nobservation), paleocrystic floes would ground in 30 or 40 feet.\n\nTrue, the assumption that melting equals freezing, after 13 feet have been\n\nattained, is based on assuming the mentioned indefinite “normal snow cover.”\n\n026 | Vol_VII-0656\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nThis leaves us free to assume that the glare knolls, at any rate, are repre–\n\nsented below the surface by extensions considerably greater than the submerged\n\nportion of a 13-foot ice cube.\n\nTaking the view that is least optimistic, from the angle of those who\n\nwant to maintain a base station semipermanently, we find that, when ice rests\n\nuniformly on water, its supporting power is adequate for anything we desire\n\nto erect, with the exception of possibly a very heavy hangar or machine shop.\n\nPerhaps the beet positive evidence of carrying power in paleocrystic ice\n\nso far published in some detail is related to e case which is reported on\n\npages 514-515 of Stefansson’s The Friendly Arctic :\n\n“On all our ice trips and at every distance from shore we have found ice\n\nwith a certain amount of earth or gravel upon it and sometimes fragments of\n\nrock or small boulders. The day after coming upon the sandy hummock we found\n\non top of some ice that was two years old or over, a gravel and boulder ridge\n\neighteen paces long. At its highest point it was about [ ?] five feet higher\n\nthan the ice on which it rested and had an average width of between ten and\n\nfifteen feet. The ridge was composed of mud, gravel, slate and boulders, the\n\nlargest weighing over a hundred pounds. Some lumps of soil with lichens I\n\ntook to show that it had been formed by a landslide from some steep and not\n\nentirely barren land. Apart from this earth ridge, the ice was a perfectly\n\nordinary old floe. It was now lying thirty or forty miles from the nearest\n\nland and the depth of water underneath it was probably over thirty fathoms,\n\nalthough we were unable to sound right at that point; no sounding we got in\n\nthe vicinity showed lees than twenty-six fathoms ( [ 156 feet ) ] .” — —\n\n027 | Vol_VII-0657\n\nEA-I Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nThere are other stories, in a way more impress lye than this report, but,\n\nsince they are less specific with regard to the weight carried by the [ ?]\n\npaleocrystic ice, they are not repeated here. The reports taken together\n\nattest to the “incredible” load-carrying power which resides in a field of\n\nheavy sea Ice.\n\nAir Search for a Base Location . Although, by definition, the outermost\n\nfloes and fields of the pack can be reached by a well-navigated and stout ice–\n\nbreaker, we nevertheless consider that, if an air base is to be located in\n\nthe pack, it will have to be established by air transport; for good judgment\n\nwould dictate that the location selected be at least 100 miles farther in than\n\nan icebreaker could penetrate. The alternative would be establishment by sub–\n\nmarine, which, though considered feasible with the right sort of undersea\n\nvessel, is not dealt with here.\n\nFrom an airplane the relief of a white surface is most readily discerned\n\nwhen the sky is perfectly clear and the sun relatively low, to cast effective\n\nshadows. Fortunately, the winter sun is much lower in the Arctic than nearer\n\nthe E uq qu ator, and, at any rate, it will be low mornings and evenings — except, —\n\nof course, right at the North Pole where its height is practically the same\n\nthroughout the twenty-four hours.\n\nA moon near its full throws even clearer shadows than the sun, and moon–\n\nlight is, in some respects, even better than sunlight for ice - scouting purposes. —\n\nSearch for a likely air - base site should, therefore, be made by the full —\n\nmoon or by the light of a sun that is not too high. The beet month of all\n\nfor this type of flying is March, with ample daylight in skies as yet usually\n\nclear. February and April are the next best months, although daylight is a\n\nbit scarce in early February while fogs and snowfall increase gradually through\n\nApril.\n\n028 | Vol_VII-0658\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nThe tentative choice of a base will be a paleocrystic field through which,\n\nor along which, runs a wide and long-frozen lead. The prospecting plane will\n\nbe mounted on skis, with a fairly low landing speed, and there should be no\n\ndifficulty about a safe descent landing if the flyer is of the “bush pilot” type, used\n\nto snow surfaces. After descending upon the comparatively thin level ice\n\nof the lead, the plane will taxi up onto the safer paleocrystic ice. (By\n\ndefinition, a lead is a crack in sea ice too wide for a man to jump over —\n\na sailor may define it as wide enough for a ship to pass through. A lead\n\nmay be several miles wide and scores of miles long.)\n\nPaleocrystic Traits . As stated previously, a true paleocrystic floe or\n\nfield, of some age shove five years, is the heaviest ice that can be found\n\nwithin the basin of the Arctic Sea, sod, at distances of more than 200 miles\n\nfrom land, is subjected to relatively gentle pressures. Still there is no\n\nguarantee that the chosen floe or field may not crack under an effectively\n\napplied stress from wind or current.\n\nHowever, if the floe does crack right across an air field, repairs are —\n\nmuch easier than one would think, analogizing from land. Nor is it likely,\n\nif ten bases were scattered throughout the suitable part of the Arctic Sea,\n\nthat more than two or three of them would be seriously injured each six months.\n\nHere the experiences of drifting ships near land are not applicable — such\n\nships as De Long’s Jeannette and Stefansson’s Karluk . For enlightening ex- —\n\nperience read the accounts of Nansen’s Fram and of any of several Soviet\n\nvessels that have drifted far from land. One of the best accounts, from our\n\npresent point of view, is Storkers e o n’s unpublished narrative in the National —\n\nArchives of Canada, for he drifted far enough from land and had no ship. The\n\n029 | Vol_VII-0659\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nfield on which his party camped six months, living by hunting, was a near\n\nanalogue to an airfield that might find itself temporarily out of touch with\n\nsupply agencies. (A brief account by Storkerson is found as an appendix in\n\nStefansson’s The Friendly Arctic .)\n\nThe surface of the paleocrystic floe is rolling, as we have said. The\n\ntops of the knolls look blue, for they are glare ice. The hollows are so\n\nnearly filled with snow that, superficially, the field looks nearly level,\n\nalthough , the snow in the hollows is too soft for a landing with wheels.\n\nLeveling a Paleocrystic Field . To prepare the field, then, it is neces–\n\nsary to tramp down the snow in the hollows and cut down some of the hillock\n\ntops with miners’ pickaxes. Picks weighing from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 pounds are\n\nprobably the hast. Accustomed as we are to heavy machines of spectacular\n\nefficiency, we may want to consider the use of one or another of these for\n\nleveling paleocrystic floes. However, it must be remembered that, in addi–\n\ntion to the difficulty of transporting such machines to the drifting air base,\n\nthere is the danger involved in case of e breakage of the ice. It is not so\n\nmuch that the machines would be likely to sink into the water as that they\n\nmight get separated from the base and drift off on another floe. Besides,\n\nthere is the almost magical efficiency of miners’ picks when used on ice.\n\nIf the need is for a really level paleocrystic field, for extensive and\n\nlong use, pumps will no doubt he employed to raise sea water from below the\n\nice to where it fills the hollows end freezes in them level with the pickax - — —\n\nlowered hillock tops.\n\nThe field once level, the problem of keeping it level will be the same\n\nfor a land field in any arctic or subarctic locality.\n\n030 | Vol_VII-0660\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nAlternative . If, for any reason, the trouble of leveling a paleocrystic\n\nfield is considered too great, the alternative suggestion is to select a lead\n\nof this year’s ice that runs through or past a paleocrystic field. Descents\n\nwould be upon the lead ice, the planes taxiing up on o nearly paleocrystic\n\nfloe where they would be tethered or placed in hangars.\n\nProblem of Snowdrifts . The Arctic Sea is not stormy, as demonstrated\n\nwhen Nansen’s ship, the Farm , drifted for three years (1893-96) at distances\n\nof several hundred miles from the margin of the pack to the north of Siberia.\n\nWriting up his scientific reports later, he considered it one of the chief\n\ndiscoveries of his expedition that the interior of the Arctic Sea is one of\n\nthe least windy regions in the world.\n\nAll later explorers have confirmed this finding and the credit usually\n\ngoes to Nansen — perhaps rightly, because he was the first to formulate it\n\nand emphasize its scientific and practical importance. However, the first\n\nmen to put the same thing on record may have been Lieutenant Commander George\n\nW. De Long, of the U.S. Navy, whose ship, the Jeannette , drifted a course simi–\n\nlar to that of the Fram about fifteen years earlier, in 1879-81. One of his\n\ndiary entries says that it is strange how seldom the wind blows and how gently\n\nit blows when [ ?] it does.\n\nSince the difficulty of keep i ng a land strip level enough in a snow country\n\nis large y ly a matter of the winds, it will appear that this trouble should not\n\nbe inordinate when a base has been located several hundred allies from land or\n\nfrom any extensive open water.\n\nTiming . Practically anything can be done in the Arctic at any time of the\n\nyear, if one knows the ropes ropes and is willing to recognize the difficulties and\n\n031 | Vol_VII-0661\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nadapt himself to them. However, a first consideration is to discover the\n\neasiest and best way. For locating an air base within the moving pack, about\n\nthe most important consideration is the time of year.\n\nWinter is the Best Season . For practically every form of travel and work,\n\nthe beat season within the pack runs from the middle of February to the middle\n\nof April. We list the chief reasons, with part of the supporting evidence.\n\nNansen reported from his three-year drift in the Fram that, in the region\n\nof light winds, deep within the pack, there is practically no fog during the\n\nmonths December to March, inclusive, and that overcast skies are then rare\n\nand snowfalls light. These Nansen conclusions have been confirmed since.\n\nPeary laid down the principle that, for traveling afoot over the pack, the\n\ngood season is from middle to late winter. In autumn and early winter, the\n\nsnowfalls, though not as heavy as in places like New England, are still much\n\nheavier than in midwinter. The spring season is snowy, too, with clouds\n\nand fog, though there is more daylight than during the fall months.\n\nSnow is a Handicap . Fluffy new-fallen snow acts as an insulator over\n\nyoung ice, protecting it from the chill of the air and enabling the relative\n\nwarmth or the sea water beneath to interfere seriously with the strengthening\n\nof the ice, even in some cases producing a thinning — if there is both a\n\nheavy snow cover above and a current below. Moreover, the snow blanket makes\n\nit difficult or impossible to tell visually whether the ice beneath is strong.\n\nAs winter advances, the snowfall becomes lighter and the cold more intense.\n\nIt is, however, less the cold itself than the decrease of precipitation which\n\naccelerates the thickening of the ice; for snow is severalfold better as an\n\ninsulator than ice can be. Moreover, the flakes that fell some months ago have\n\nnow become granular, furnishing relatively poor insulation as compared with\n\nfeathery, new-fallen snow.\n\nUnpaginated | Vol_VII-0662\n\nEditor:\n\nIn this pgf.

Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nBy Christmastime the snowfall is approaching its minimum and the cold\n\nin gradually working toward that maximum which develops either in January\n\nor February and remains substantially through March.\n\nThe Use of Moonlight . With the winter decrease of clouds the effective–\n\nness of moonlight increases.\n\nA questionnaire sent out in 1934 by Stefansson, on behalf of Pan American\n\nAirways, to a number of bush pilots in Alaska and northern Canada, brought\n\nreplies to indicate that most of the experienced flyers in Alaska considered\n\nthe full moon about as favorable as sunlight for airplane landings and take–\n\noffs, and gave the length of adequate light at two or three days either side\n\nof the full. Canadian pilots tended to be more favorable to moonlight than\n\nthe Alaskans, giving a longer period for the moon’s effectiveness, some voting\n\nthe moon to be as good as the sun for six days either side of the full, thus\n\nfor just under half the lunar month.\n\nThe difference in verdict between the Alaskan and Canadian pilots is it–\n\nself enlightening. You do not readily appreciate, without seeing it you r self,\n\nthe extent to which small patches of black (forests, willow clumps, rocks,\n\nground swept bare by wind) will decrease the effectiveness of the moonlight.\n\nSteep hills throw shadows when the moon is low, and these also detract from\n\nthe over-all effect of reflected moonlight. Alaska is, on the average, more\n\nrugged than northern Canada, has more rock exposures and more patches of willow,\n\neven beyond the forests. It was the subtractive effect of these, no doubt,\n\nwhich caused the Alaska pilots to give the moon only about half the effective–\n\nness rating that was given it by the Canadians.\n\nFlyers whose experience is mainly or wholly in the Antarctic are usually\n\nskeptical of the value of moonlight. This seems strange at first, for the moon\n\n033 | Vol_VII-0665\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nought to be even more effective there than in the Arctic, since the snow sur–\n\nface is more nearly uniform. The reason for the difference of opinion is\n\nclearly that in the Antarctic, so far, most journeys, whether afoot or by\n\nair, have been made in the sunlight of summer; there has been little travel–\n\ning by moonlight. Pilots who have never landed by moonlight seem nearly\n\nalways to underestimate its usefulness.\n\nThe Values of Cold . The Eskimo point of view is that most winter conditions\n\nare more favorable than those of summer. So the winter is with them the chief\n\ntraveling season, the more so the farther north. Whites at first disagreed\n\nwith this; but finally the explorers were won over. The first complete con–\n\nvert was Peary. It was gradually established by him that, for purposes like\n\nhis, winter is the time of travel, summer the time of rest or preparation.\n\nThe reason, of course, is the mobility of the arctic ice and the importance\n\nto the traveler of having a solid footing, without the danger of breaking\n\nthrough into liquid water. In the Antarctic, travel afoot has been on land\n\nand in a climate where little thawing takes place, even in midsummer. The\n\nexplorers there could afford to idle away the winter, for they knew that the\n\nlong summer was coming as an uninterrupted working season.\n\nFrom For planes the Peary generalization applies almost as well as for sledges. —\n\nThe flying is better when clouds are few, when snowfall is rare, and fogs are nearly —\n\nabsent. So the good flying weather deep inside the pack starts in late Novem–\n\nber and improves through December and January. From the light angle, there is\n\nonly the moon during the early part of this time, with the daylight steadily\n\nincreasing after the New Year, (It is only north of 80° that daylight is wholly\n\nabsent on the shortest day. There are various ways of figuring; some would\n\n034 | Vol_VII-0666\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nput the limit of total absence of daylight on the shortest day at around 83°\n\nN. latitude.)\n\nBehavior of Moon and Sun . At the season when the Arctic Sea depends on\n\nmoonlight, it is important for advance planning to remember that in high\n\nlatitudes the moon behaves much like the midnight sun of summer that disappears\n\nin winter. For daring part of each lunar month the moon circles in the sky\n\nwithout setting; during another part it circles below the horizon without\n\nrising.\n\nAt the very pole the sun is above the horizon a little more than half the\n\nyear; but almost as much light (say 80% as much) is lost through having the\n\nsun below the horizon nearly half the year. In the case of the moon, the\n\nloss is negligible through having it below the horizon, for this occurs at\n\nthe new phase, when no appreciable light is yielded in any case. The period\n\nof constant revolution without setting is at and near the full, when the moon\n\nis giving its maximum light.\n\nTo a flyer looking for a suitable landing place or air - base site in the —\n\npack, few things are therefore more Important than to have in mind a clear\n\npicture of this part of the moon’s behavior. In addition, he should have with\n\nhim tables or a graph showing what to expect from the sun at any high latitude\n\nat any time. There are available several such graphical presentations. One\n\nwas published by the international journal Arktis , 1/2, 1930; Wilh. Meinardus:\n\n“The Seasonal Change of Illum i nation in the Polar Regions” (title translated).\n\nAnother, and perhaps the best yet published, was worked out by Dr. Edward M.\n\nWeyer, and published in the Geographical Review , of the American Geographical\n\nSociety of New York, in July 1943. This presentation has since been further im–\n\nproved by Dr. Weyer and is included in Encyclopedia Arctica .\n\n035 | Vol_VII-0667\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nDaylight in the Pack . As February advances, daylight increases a good\n\ndeal more rapidly than indicated by conventional astronomical calculations;\n\nfor they usually neglect, among other things, refraction, snow reflection,\n\nand the appreciable diameter of the sun. Without any increase of clouds or fog,\n\nthere is, then, through February a steady improvement both in the thickening\n\nof this year’s ice and in the increase of daylight.\n\nIn most of the area which is for other reasons tentatively suitable for\n\nthe establishment of semipermanent air stations, 24-hour daylight is available\n\nroughly from the last week of February.\n\nBest Scouting and Building Time . It follows from the above that, in normal\n\ntimes, the scouting for a prospective air - base site would begin in early —\n\nFebruary and the building of it late in February or early in March.\n\nClouds and fog will begin to interfere [ ?] the earlier in the season the\n\nnearer the base is to the margins of the pack. In this matter latitude is\n\nof some consequence but distance from open water is more important. Distance\n\nfrom land is also material; for when the sun begins to strike dark surfaces\n\non the islands or continents and to create heat, the humid air from them, pass–\n\ning out to sea, works for the deterioration of flying weather. There is\n\ngoing to be ice deterioration, too, but this unfavorable development lags\n\nbehind the weather.\n\nThe Lands Produce Summer Fog . On the lands which surround the polar sea\n\n(partially excepting the few which are mountainous and therefore extensively\n\nglacier-covered), evaporation increases rapidly as the sun mounts.\n\nThe slowness of evaporation when temperatures are around 50 ° F. below\n\nzero is indicated graphically by the drying of a linen handkerchief. Hang\n\none up soaking wet at that temperature and it becomes stiff almost instantly,\n\n036 | Vol_VII-0668\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nregaining its softness only in a period of between one and two weeks; while\n\nat around zero the handkerchief would be soft in a day or two — at most\n\nthree or four days, depending, of course, also on wind and sun.\n\nThe invisible steaming of surfaces, indicated by the drying of our\n\nfrozen handkerchief, increases rapidly when the temperatures begin to swing\n\nbetween thaws in the day and frosts at night, and this produces local fogs\n\nover the lands that surround the polar sea. The third Stefansson expedition\n\nfound, in charting the coasts of the islands which they discovered (Brock,\n\nBorden, King, Meighen, Lougheed) and those of the neighboring islands, that\n\nin May there is unlikely to be more than one clear day per week. However,\n\nthis extreme fogginess is of more significance for stations located on shore\n\nthan for drifting stations out in the pack.\n\nFogs are Low . Arctic fogs average lower than those of the temperate\n\nzones. It was a common experience of the whalers north of Alaska and western\n\nCanada that when ships could not see each other from the deck or bridge the\n\ncaptains and lookouts could see each other from the mast heads, which were\n\nfrom 60 to 100 feet higher. It is common, too, on the arctic prairie for an\n\nobserver to be surrounded by a thick fog on every hand, while, on looking\n\nskyward, he can see birds flying overhead, practically as if there were no fog.\n\nAccordingly, a flyer searching for an established base in the pack would have\n\nno difficulty in seeing it dark against the white landscape, if the plane\n\nwere passing over the base and able to look vertically down, or nearly so. This\n\nis a corollary of the general proposition that fogs are less of a handicap\n\nto arctic aviation than would be inferred from a study of the old-fashioned\n\nweather records, as they were taken up to a few years ago.\n\n037 | Vol_VII-0669\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nDrift Bases Will Not Be in Foggy Areas . The like in true at sea, where\n\nfogs are many (and dense, horizontally speaking), especially in the drift\n\nice that fringes the pack. However, we are postulating that the drifting\n\nbases will be one or several hundred miles from the margin of the pack, so\n\nthat none of them will be in the very foggy area until toward the end, when\n\neach is about to drift into the open water between Greenland and the Franz\n\nJosef Islands, as indicated in this discussion, post , under “Drift of Base\n\nStations.”\n\nEven Central Pack More Foggy in Summer . While the margins of the pack\n\nare foggier than its center, and while conditions from the flying point of\n\nview improve at any time of the year as you approach the middle of the pack,\n\nstill it is true that, even near the Pole of Inaccessibility, or Ice Pole,\n\nthere is as summer advances an increase of cloudiness, of precipitation , and —\n\nof fog.\n\nAs said, this increase begins earlier near the margins, perhaps sometime\n\nin April, and reaches the center of the pack within the next few weeks. So\n\nMay is a bad month near the margin of the pack but good near its center; June\n\nis a bad month throughout the pack; July and August are worse. Still, con–\n\nsidering the over-all flying conditions, it may be that things are at their\n\nworst in October, for then occurs a rapid decrease of daylight without a\n\ncorrespondingly rapid decrease of [ ?] clouds and fog.\n\nSnowfall in the Pack . It is probable that, taking the pack as a whole,\n\nthe snowiest spring month is May or June and the snowiest autumn month either\n\nSeptember or October.\n\nRain in the Pack . In 1937 k , liquid rain liquid rain – is this a good term? took the place of snow as precipi–\n\ntation for about five weeks in the immediate vicinity of the North Pole, as indicated by the reports —\n\n038 | Vol_VII-0670\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nof the Papanin expedition. No one has yet spent a summer in the vicinity of\n\nthe Pole of Inaccessibility, which is about 400 miles from the North Pole in\n\nthe direction toward Bering Strait; but in all probability the season of\n\nliquid rain liquid rain ? is there about the same as at the geographic pole — thus between\n\nthree and six weeks in different years. The rain season grows longer as the\n\nmargins of the pack are approached.\n\nSummer Deterioration of Ice . Rain produces maximum deterioration of the\n\nice in s given time, but the direct sun is nearly as bad.\n\nSome conditions which are inimical to foot travel are also handicaps in\n\nair operation. The third Stefansson expedition found, when traveling by sledge\n\nover the pack some 300 miles north of Alaska, that movement afoot began to be\n\nseriously impeded by the climate in May. As the season grew warmer, the\n\nthickening of the young ice on leads became slower. A lead which would have\n\nfrozen over in two days during March, giving ice strong enough to support\n\nmen and sledges, took three or four days to freeze over in April, five or six\n\ndays in early May, and a week or two in late May.\n\nThis slowing up of ice formation was only in part due to the decreasing\n\nchill; it was in greater part due to the increased depth of new snowfalls\n\nwhich blanketed the ice and protected it against the freezing effect of the air.\n\nThere was also the added problem that the level uniform snow cover made it\n\nvisually difficult to tell whether you were about to enter upon safe or unsafe\n\nice surfaces.\n\nJudging Ice from Aloft . These same difficulties apply to the aviator. No\n\nmatter how skilled and experienced he is, no matter how sound his judgment, he\n\nwill find it increasingly hard to judge from above whether he is about to land\n\non safe ice. Its strength may not be what he thinks, and snags will be hidden\n\n039 | Vol_VII-0671\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nboth by the thickness of the new snow and by its uniform whiteness. For there\n\nis a difference in color between snow and ice if both are exposed, while color\n\ndifferences disappear, and only shadows serve, if the ice is snow-covered; and\n\neven the shadows are decreased by the uniform and considerable reflection of\n\nlight from the snow — the light that casts [ ?] shadows no longer comes in the\n\nmain direct from the sun but now increasingly from surrounding objects, by\n\nreflection. The more numerous and effective the snow reflectors, the less\n\nclear-cut the shadows.\n\nChanges in Snow . As the temperatures grow higher, thare are two [ ?]\n\npronounced changes in the snow — it melts and it turns granular.\n\nTo the traveler afoot, granular snow is more of a nuisance than liquid\n\nwater. He splashes easily through ponds which are at first ankle-deep or at\n\nmost knee-deep; then he comes to snowdrifts of several feet in depth. Across\n\nthese, dogs, sledges , and men used to pass when the weather was cold, leaving —\n\nbarely a trail. But now the drifts are slush, and the dogs sink to their\n\nbellies, the men to their hips; the sledge runners cut in until the body\n\nof the sleigh drags like a plow.\n\nThe aviator who wants to come down landing under these conditions in spring will have to allow for un–\n\nsafe ice, ponds of water , and snow that no longer behaves like snow. —\n\nDegradation of Pack Ice . Water runs down any slope, so there are little\n\nrivulets trickling down the sides of the miniature mountains that have been\n\nformed during winter by the crushing of ice under pressure. Most of these\n\nridges are low, but some reach the extreme height of 60 or 70 feet above the\n\nlevel of the surrounding ice.\n\nNear the edges of the pack, these small-scale mountain ranges of crushed\n\n040 | Vol_VII-0672\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nblocks may crisscross each other every which way at distances varying from a\n\nfew yards to a few hundred. Well out in the pack the pronounced ridges are\n\nlikely to be separated by miles rather than yards. Whether close set or far\n\napart, the thaw produced by rain and sun changes them gradually from the\n\nangular peaks and pinnacles of the first year to the rolling prairie contours\n\nof the fourth or fifth year.\n\nIce is not as white as snow and therefore melts sooner through more of\n\nthe sun’s light being transformed into heat. Surfaces at right angles to the\n\nsun melt more easily than those which receive slanting rays; ice slopes melt\n\nfaster than similarly tilted snowbanks and the snow persists while the ice\n\ndisappears. This in turn means that instead of open water in the hollow places\n\nyou have mushy, water-soaked snow.\n\nThe conditions which we are describing appear sooner near the margin\n\nof the pack and also, to a certain extent, earlier the farther south. Be–\n\ncause most people overestimate the effect of southerliness, we emphasize\n\nthat with the midnight sun, which means a twenty-four - hour light delivery, —\n\nthere are potentials of heat creation that approach the tropical. (This is,\n\nof course, why the U.S. Weather Bureau has recorded temperatures as high as\n\n100° F. in the shade north of the Arctic Circle. That figure has been reached\n\nofficially at one spot only, Fort Yukon, Alaska; but records of 95° F. in the\n\nshade are available from many arctic localities, while 90° is a common figure\n\non all arctic continental lowlands that are far from the sea. ) —\n\nAccording to some calculations, the sun delivers a little more potential\n\nheat each twenty-four hours at the top of the atmosphere over the North Pole\n\non the longest day of the year than it delivers over the Equator. By atmospher [ ?] ic\n\n041 | Vol_VII-0673\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nabsorption, it is considered that this is reduced, so that near ground level\n\nthe heat delivery (light convertible into heat) is a little less than at the\n\nEquator. But only a little less.\n\nThat we do not have a [ ?] sudden melting away of all the ice and snow in the\n\npolar sea under this terrific downpour is naturally because most of the light\n\nis never turned into heat, but is reflected back by the snow and, to a less\n\nextent, by the ice.\n\nBut all over the polar sea are dark spots and patches that do not reflect\n\nthe light effectively. Some of these are produced by dead crustaceans, fish,\n\nseals, polar bears, or other forms of animal life, and some by the excrement\n\nof live animals, including birds. Other dark spots result from vegetable\n\nmatter — seaweed and that sort of thing. Then there are plants that grow and\n\nprosper in snowbanks, most conspicuous ly or are the algae that produce “pink snow” or —\n\n[ ?] “crimson snow.” Whenever there is such a dark or darkened patch or spot,\n\nthe sun gets stronger play, turning more of its light into heat; and these\n\ndark things, heated, melt their way down into pockets in the ice.\n\nWhen the black object has sunk beyond the direct reach of the sun, the\n\nthaw nevertheless continues to be facilitated, for we have now a bowl of water\n\nwhich reflects less light than the snow does — apparently also less than the\n\nice. Besides, there are considerable snowfalls at this time of year, so that\n\nthe ice is constantly being clad with a thinner or thicker snow mantle that\n\nstays undampened enough to be white for hours or even days; but the snow that\n\nfalls in water melts at once, or at least darkens upon becoming soaked, so that\n\nthe surface there creates more beat by the increased absorption of light.\n\nIn the whole of the polar sea there is animal and plant life beneath the\n\n042 | Vol_VII-0674\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice\n\nice. One animal which lives there, the seal, has the ability to make holes up\n\nthrough the ice with his teeth. Each hole so made becomes a funnel down into\n\nwhich flow the thaw waters of spring. As it flows, the water enlarges the\n\nhole of the seal, while the network of affluent streams drains a small sur–\n\nrounding area of ice.\n\nThere are other holes in the ice, produced, as we have indicated, by melt–\n\ning that [ ?] starts around some dark object. As each pit finally breaks\n\nthrough and becomes a hole, a new drainage area is set up, with rivulets\n\ncoming in from all sides.\n\nWe have said already that there is no floe or field in the entire pack\n\nwhich is so strong that it may not crack under pressure. Some of these crocks\n\nwere made early last in winter and are now healed by six or seven feet of ice; —\n\nothers are covered with thinner and thinner ice, according to their relative\n\nyouth, and the thinner the ice the more likely it is to have numerous seal\n\nholes in it. Accordingly, there is an intensified drainage wherever leads\n\nare covered with relatively new ice.\n\nThen, of course, any fresh lead that forms by cracking of the ice after\n\nthe beginning of the thaw period is a ready-made drainage outlet. Little\n\nstreams begin at once to pour their thaw water into these leads.\n\nWhen a lead forms in cold weather, it divides a floe into pieces which\n\nfreeze together again quickly into a floe of new composition, perhaps bigger\n\nthan the old. But toward s spring the ability of the ice to heal its own —\n\nwounds in this way decreases. Under very slight pressure the floes will now\n\nbreak along their lines of growing weakness, and these breaches cannot heal\n\nbefore autumn. The number of leads increases steadily as summer advances ; , so —\n\n043 | Vol_VII-0675\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nthat ice fields of ten, fifteen, or twenty miles in diameter become more and\n\nmore rare.\n\nToward the end of summer there are probably not many fields in the polar\n\nsea which are more than ten or fifteen miles in their minimum diameter. ‘The\n\naverage diameters are, of course, greatest near the center of the pack and de–\n\ncrease toward its edges. At the extreme margins of the pack, wave motion, not\n\nappreciable without precision instruments if you are more than ten or w s o miles —\n\nfrom open water, begins to cooperate in the breaking of fields into floes and\n\nof floes into cakes.\n\nLanding Places in Summer . From the point of view of travelers afoot, every\n\nseal hole that provides drainage and every open lead in a blessing, for now\n\nthe water is draining from the slushy snow, and some of the slu s h itself flows —\n\nalong with the miniature currents into the drainage holes. The ice along the\n\nshores of leads now seems dry and it becomes relatively easy to walk and sledge\n\nalong their banks.\n\nFor a pilot in case of a forced landing, or a desire to land, the beat\n\nhope now — practically the only one — is to come down alongside and parallel\n\nto a lead. This must not be a lead through paleocrystic ice, for the hilliness\n\nof the very old floes is now at its maximum. To find even tolerably smooth\n\nice, the pilot will have to select a new lead that runs through an older lead.\n\nAs the summer advances , the drainage channels, which were a blessing to foot —\n\ntraveler or aviator, have less and less merit. For instead of remaining a few\n\ninches wide they become a few feet wide, and instead of being a few inches\n\ndeep they are now several feet deep. These channels, however, are seldom wider\n\nthan four or five feet, nor is the water in them often deeper than three or four.\n\n044 | Vol_VII-0676\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nBut the channels come from or run through small ice-surface lakes. If\n\nthe ice is paleocrystic, the lakes are innumerable, but seldom of a diameter\n\nof more than a few score yards and usually only a few yards, though relatively\n\ndeep. On the third Stefansson expedition men sometimes had to wade across lakes\n\nof this type that were hip-deep. (They used empty kerosene or gasoline con–\n\ntainers lashed to the sleds to float them across? the dogs had to swim.)\n\nWhere the channels between lakes cut through ice ridges they may be four\n\nor five feet deep, although the water in them would not likely be deeper\n\nthan two or three feet. Where the lakes within the pack have been formed on\n\nrelatively level ice, they are much larger, at times several hundred yards\n\nwide; but they are shallow, seldom deeper than two feet.\n\nNear the margins of the pack this process continues until the channels\n\nhave cut their way right through the ice in which the waters flow, or until\n\nthe ice is so weakened that a minor stress breaks it. Toward the center of\n\nthe pack the likelihood decreases that a stream will cut all the way through\n\nto the sea below.\n\nAt this stage of ice deterioration even a ski plane can hope for little\n\nbetter than a crash landing. It may be that it can descend along the edge\n\nof a lead and slide along far enough to reduce its speed considerably before\n\nit stubs the toe of a ski into an obstruction.\n\nPossibly special types of skis could be designed for this sort of lead–\n\nshore landing, ones more curved up at the tip than now usual.\n\nLeads Carry Fresh Water in Summer. The condition we have described is\n\nat its worst — or at least at its height — toward the end of summer. The\n\nleads are then fresh-water rivers, or canals. If, when traveling afoot, you\n\n045 | Vol_VII-0677\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\ncome to a lead which is less than a few hundred yards across, you can scoop\n\nup drinking water with confidence that there will be not a trace of salt\n\ndiscernible to the palate.\n\nFor the third Stefansson expedition a rough measure of the depth of this\n\nfresh layer was furnished by the seals that were shot. When dead, the seals\n\nwould sink through the fresh-water layer and float on the top of the salt\n\nocean water beneath. They were seen at depths of ten and twelve feet. Probably —\n\nin some instances the fresh water that lies upon the salt water in a lead\n\nhas a depth of more than twenty feet.\n\nBut if leads are one or several miles wide they are not fresh at the\n\nsurface, except that they are relatively fresh after a calm of several days.\n\nFor in a wide lead the winds produce a wave action that stirs up the sea,\n\nmixing the fresh water with the salt.\n\nAutumn in the Pack . When autumn frosts come in clear weather, ice forms\n\nrapidly over the lakes and channels; but if snow falls, to rest upon the new\n\nice, thickening is retarded. The combination of thin ice with thick snow makes\n\na situation that is doubly dangerous for men afoot, insofar as getting one’s\n\nfeet wet is concerned; for the flow of thaw water continues through the\n\nchannels as the lakes are being drained. When the lake is big the ice, with\n\nits weight of snow, will collapse down into the water; but if the lakelet\n\nis small, only a few feet across, the ice may be strong enough to act as a\n\nroof, maintaining an air space of an inch or several inches between itself and\n\nthe water. W T hen a man afoot readily breaks throug h , even if he is walking on — —\n\nsnowshoes.\n\nAs winter advances, the freezing of the small lakes is slow, for they are\n\nlocated, in bowls that are filled with drifting snow. In some cases the\n\n046 | Vol_VII-0678\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\ntraveling parties of the third St e fansson expedition were able to get fresh —\n\nwater out of such lakes six or eight weeks after they originally froze over.\n\nSkis vs. Snowshoes . There is enough rough ice on the pola e r sea to inter–\n\nfere with skiing. Several members of various traveling parties of the\n\nexpedition were Norwegians, or otherwise accustomed to the use of skis, and\n\nthe sledging parties always had skis with them; but they carried snowshoes\n\nalso. It was only on rare occasions (when traveling before a fair wind,\n\nand usually in the early spring) that skis were used at all. Snowshoes are\n\neasier to carry, and should be preferred, unless both are carried.\n\nNatural and Artificial Strengthening of Ice . We described some way back\n\nhow a base can be located on a paleocrystic floe or field. We might explain\n\nhere how a floe that is being used as a long-term camp site may be strengthened —\n\nfor safer residence.\n\nAs indicated, there are weaknesses in a typical floe or field at the end\n\nof summer, due to the lakes which have been absorbing more sunlight than\n\nthe surrounding ice, and due to the network of channels connecting the lakes\n\nand leading to drainage points. These weaknesses tend to be perpetuated as\n\nwinter advances; for the lowest places, where the ice lo thinnest, have the\n\nsoftest and deepest snow that most retards the thickening of ice.\n\nNow if there is a crew of men around an air base or scientific station,\n\nthey can be sent out after each snowfall, armed with long poles that have at\n\ntheir ends some kind of knob or masher. They can follow along the “river”\n\nchannels, walking on the solid old ice at the sides, and can break the snow\n\nand ice roofings, pounding them down into the water, where the snow gets\n\nsaturated immediately and becomes a good conductor, a quick freezer.

Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nsensible adaptation of method, you can do similar things with the lakes.\n\nLater, when the ice roofing on the channels and lakes has become too\n\nthick for breaking, the men can stamp the soft snow down after each snowfall;\n\nthey can roll it with a mechanical roller or drive back and forth over it\n\nwith a track-laying tractor. Thus they will promote an equality of freez–\n\ning, the weak parts of the floe being strengthened to where they nearly or\n\nquite match the originally strong parts.\n\nWhen midwinter approaches, with decreased snowfall and intensified cold,\n\npumps would be used to fill with water the little lakes and the stream beds.\n\nThis will produce not merely a floe with a surface level above but also one\n\nwhich can be visualized as fairly level below, on its water side. For thin\n\nice will conduct cold a little faster than thick ice, with consequent equaliza–\n\ntion of the freezing, the hollows on the lower side of the ice being gradually\n\nfilled in.\n\nSpecial Applications . The principle of helping along the thickening of\n\nice by removing snow or tramping it down has long been known. Special appli–\n\ncations of this have been reported by Soviet explorers. There is, for instance,\n\nthe creation of a drydock in ice.\n\nIf a disabled ship which is not too large is wintering in the pack, the\n\ncrew may, for drydock reasons, promote the thickening of the ice around the\n\nvessel in the manner we have indicated. When the ice is thick enough, they\n\ncan cut it away from around the sides of the ship and expose parts where repair\n\nis needed. (This method is described and diagrammatically illustrated in “Ice\n\nDock,” by Engineer K. Zhukov, Teknika Molodezhi ( Techniques for the Young ),\n\n1944.)\n\n048 | Vol_VII-0680\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nDrift of Base Stations\n\nIn discussing the locating of air fields on sea ice we must keep in mind —\n\nthat there are two sections of the arctic mediterranean in which the general\n\ntrend of ice motion is problematic. One of these is the region to the north–\n\nwest and west of the islands from Ellesmere to Prince Patrick; the other is\n\nthe area of probable, or at least possible, eddy to the north of Alaska, east\n\nof the Point Barrow meridian. For all other sections we have enough drift\n\nrecords to make the trend of ice movement reasonably clear.\n\nIce Motion North of Greenland . On his various sledge journeys toward\n\nand eventually to the North Pole, Peary found that, as he advanced farther\n\nand farther north from the Greenland-Ellesmere region, the drift to the east–\n\nward became more and more rapid, until he got to that zone of maximum frac–\n\nture which he calls the Big Lead. Since the intensity of ice motion, and\n\nsometimes even the direction, will depend in most parts of the Arctic Sea\n\nupon winds blowing at the time, or during the preceding few days, the Big\n\nLead will not necessarily be at the same distance from Greenland at the same\n\ndate of successive years, nor at different dates of the same year. However,\n\nthis “lead” can he reckoned as being roughly 70 miles offshore from Ellesmere\n\nIsland and 35 miles offshore from the Peary Land part of Greenland. It doubtless —\n\ncontinues approaching nearer land the farther east we go. We can safely think\n\nof it as practically hugging the shore when we get as far southeast as North–\n\neast Foreland, Greenland.\n\nSpeed of Ice Drift . The betl belt of greatest ice speed, in the direction\n\nof the Greenland-Norway gap, will be along the poleward side of the Big Lead.\n\nSoviet writers have spoken of 3/4 mile per hour as the maximum speed, and this\n\n049 | Vol_VII-0681\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nmay be right for any motion that depends in the main on winds of large scope.\n\nBut, under the pressure of the violent local gales which blow near land, a\n\nmotion estimated by the third Stefansson expedition at two 2 miles per hour has —\n\nbeen observed to the north of Alaska — this being the notion, of the pack in\n\nrelation to landfast ice.\n\nIt may be that what Soviet writers have in mind is that, within the pack, —\n\nthe greatest differential motion of opposite sides of a load, with respect\n\nto each other, is 3/4 mile per hour. But in such case it is possible that\n\nthe ice on both sides of the lead .is moving in the one direction and that\n\nthe absolute motion with respect to the sea bottom is, in the case of one\n\nside of the lead, 2 miles per hour, against 1-1/4 miles per hour for the other\n\nside of the lead.\n\nCharles D. Brower, who had more experience than any other Alaska white man\n\nin whaling off Cape Smythe (Barrow), used to speak of ice drifting at two 2 —\n\nmiles per hour. However, his estimate, and the mentioned one by members of\n\nthe third Stefansson expedition, should be marked down as no more than esti–\n\nmates. It may be that they represent considerable exaggeration.\n\nIf there is anywhere in the Arctic a motion of wide streams of ice as\n\nhigh as two 2 miles per hour, even for a few hours at a time, this will most —\n\nlikely occur in the gap between Northeast Foreland and Spitsbergen, in Bering\n\nStrait, or in some other of the straits leading out of the arctic basin into\n\nneighboring waters.\n\nDirection of Ice Drift . We know, then, that to the north of the islands\n\nAxel Heiberg, Ellesmere, and Greenland the motion of the ice, although occa–\n\nsionally reversed by a contrary wind, is to the east, and that the speed in-\n\n050 | Vol_VII-0682\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\ncreases as we approach the slacking-out region between Greenland and the Franz\n\nJosef Islands. Since theoreticians have long believed, and since the Papanin\n\nexpedition demonstrated, that the drift from the North Pole is in the direction\n\nof Iceland, we may consider ourselves to know that any floe which at a given\n\ntime is located east of a line drawn from Axel Heiberg Island to the Pole, will\n\nmove thence in a general Spitsbergen direction and with increasing speed.\n\nA doubtful area in this quarter, mentioned above, would then begin not\n\nfar to the west of the Heiberg meridian. Little is known about the movement\n\nof ice in that region except what was learned from two sledge journeys, those\n\nof MacMillan at to the northwest of Heiberg in 1914 and of Stefansson north–\n\nward from Borden Island in 1917. Both journeys indicate that there was little\n\nmovement, or at any rate slow, with evidence on direction inconclusive.\n\nBut the Stefansson sledge trip of 1915, to the northwest of Banks Island\n\nand in the region west of southern Prince Patrick Island, showed a definite\n\nthough slow movement southerly. This trend is open to alternative interpreta–\n\ntions, that the main pull was toward M’Clure Strait, or that it was toward\n\nAlaska. It is known that the movement of water ail the year, and of ice\n\nwhen Melville Sound is not frozen fast, is easterly through the waterway\n\nrepresented by M’Clure Strait, Melville Sound, Barrow Strait, Lancaster\n\nSound, to Baffin Bay; therefore it might be contended that southward movement\n\nof ice located westerly from southern Prince Patrick was only an effort by these\n\nfloes to get into the eastbound stream running through M’Clure Strait.\n\nHowever, that the movement observed in 1915 to the west of southern Prince\n\nPatrick and northern Banks i I slands was really toward Alaska rather than toward —\n\nM’Clure Strait becomes evident when those observations are studied together\n\n051 | Vol_VII-0683\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nwith the ones taken to the west of northern Banks Island by the Stefansson\n\nsledging party that made a fishhook-curve track in 1914 from Martin Point,\n\nAlaska, to northwestern Banks Island, especially the observations of late\n\nMay to June 20. (See the separate route maps for 1914 and 1915 in Stefansson’s\n\nThe Friendly Arctic .)\n\nSince it is obvious that there cannot be much movement of water easterly\n\nthrough the tortuous and shallow channels just north of the Canadian mainland,\n\nit follows that the ice which moves southerly along the western coast of Banks\n\nIsland must turn west and drift parallel to the north coast of Alaska. P el le nty —\n\nof evidence of this was found by the Stefansson party on their mentioned\n\njourney north from Martin Point, Alaska, in 1914; but this was only confirma–\n\ntion of what had long been known, from the British explorers of the middle\n\nnineteenth century, from the Yankee whalers between 1889 and 1907, from the\n\nLeffingwell-Mikkelsen expedition of 1906-07 — all of which was re-enforced\n\nby the drift of Stefansson’s Karluk from the Colville mouth to the vicinity\n\nof Wrangel Island in 1914. This westward movement from southern Banks Island,\n\nparallel to Alaska, appears to be chiefly along a line running westward at\n\na distance of 150 or 200 miles north from the mainland shore.\n\nStations in Doubtful Area . Since there is between the Axel Heiberg\n\nmeridian and a point northwesterly from Prince Patrick Island a region where\n\nit is anybody’s guess what the trend of drift would be, an air base established\n\non a floe in that realm of uncertainty might take either of two courses. It\n\nmight drift woard toward the Spitsbergen-Greenland a aperture, and then probably at —\n\nfirst with a rate of a mile or two per day; or it might start out southwesterly,\n\nand then probably at a much slower rate, perhaps half a mile or less per day.\n\n052 | Vol_VII-0684\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nThe Y-drift n N orth of Barrow . It has been demonstrated by the drift of a —\n\nnumber of vessels caught in the ice, among them the Baychimo and the Karluk ,\n\nthat there is a Y in the current to the north of Point Barrow. A ship caught\n\nin the ice between Bering Strait and Point Barrow will drift northeasterly\n\npar a llel to the coast, while another ship caught in the ice along the north\n\ncoast of Alaska between Barrow and the Colville, will drift northwesterly;\n\nthe tracks of the two will meet at a point north of Barrow, when both will go\n\nnortherly for a while, then turn west, to pass north of Wrangel Island, likely\n\nat some distance between 50 and 150 miles.\n\nThe Karluk Drift . The Karluk drift of 1913-14 began at a point about 20\n\nmiles offshore just east of the mouth of the Colville and took s northwesterly\n\ncourse parallel to the land, She stopped frequently and occasionally reversed\n\nherself, but in the long run she forged ahead so as to pass Barrow only a\n\nlittle out of sight of land — having been in sight from the lowland to the\n\neast of Barrow theretofore. With many zigzags the vessel continued westerly\n\nfrom Barrow until she sank about 50 miles north and a little east from Wrangel\n\nIsland. This drift occupied the time from September 1913 to January 1914.\n\nThe Jeannette Drift . The previously mentioned 1879-81 drift of De Long’s —\n\nJeannette started east of Wrangel Island. She first moved northerly until the\n\nisland was well cleared and then began a trend somewhat north of west, which\n\ncourse she followed during the next year and a half, getting a little farther\n\noffshore constantly, until she was crushes in the ice off the islands she\n\ndiscovered — Jeannette, Henrietta , and Bennett. —\n\nThe Fram Drift . In the 1890’s it was the belief of Nansen, based largely\n\non De Long’s work, that a ship placed in the ice in the vicinity of the New —\n\n053 | Vol_VII-0685\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nSiberian Islands would drift approximately across the North Pole on her way\n\nto the North Atlantic. During 1893-1996 his ship the Fram actually continued\n\nin the sort of spiral curve which is forecast by plotting on a map and con–\n\nnecting the Karluk and Jeannette drifts. This line does not trend offshore as\n\nmuch as Nansen would have liked and does not go across the immediate vicinity\n\nof the Pole. The Fram’s drift curve is actually about 300 miles from the Pole\n\nat its nearest point, where the trend became westerly and then southwesterly,\n\ncoming into open water to the west of Spitsbergen.\n\nDrift of Soviet Vessels . In the 1930’s and later a number of ships be–\n\nlonging to the Soviet Union were caught in the ice in the New Siberian Island\n\nregion and carried on Fram -like drifts. One of them, the Sedov , followed a\n\ncourse roughly parallel to that of the Fram but consistently farther from\n\nAsia, and made an approach closer to the North Pole by about 50 miles.\n\nThe Storkerson Drift . In late midwinter 1918 a party of four men of the\n\nthird Stefansson expedition traveled by sledge roughly 200 miles north from\n\nCross Island, which itself is about 20 miles off the north coast of Alaska,\n\nsomewhat east of the south of the Cl Colville. The leader of the party,\n\nStorker Storkerson, decided that they were then probably in the most favorable\n\nlocation for drifting westward on a course that would be parallel to and off–\n\nshore from that of the Karluk . So they made camp on a stout floe, planning\n\nto drift either one or two years, living by hunting.\n\nIt turned out that the drift was not nearly as straightforward as had been\n\nexpected on the basis of the Karluk and Jeannette tracks, so that, with a total\n\ndrift in various directions measured by Storkerson at around 400 miles, the\n\nparty made good only about 90 miles during six months in a resultant direction\n\nsomewhat north of west — thus, however, approximately parallel to the trend\n\n054 | Vol_VII-0686\n\nEA-I. Stefansson: Uses of Ice.\n\nof the Alaska coast.\n\nTravel Afoot Over Pack Ice . When the party had been encamped on the\n\ndrifting floe about half a rear, Storkerson developed asthma, with repeated\n\nattacks of increasing severity. For this reason, but no doubt also because\n\nthe drift was not so rapid or clear-cut in direction as he had hoped, he\n\ndecided to take the party ashore, the landward journey is instructive in that\n\nit was made at what is for foot travelers the worst time of year — there was\n\nlittle daylight, much snowfall and a depth of newfallen snow which both\n\nhindered the thickening of young lee and concealed Its weakness.\n\nThe report of Storkerson is therefore one of the most significant in\n\nthe annals of polar exploration: “We started on the 9th of October and reached\n\nshore the 8th of November, without any trouble.” So, for men experienced as\n\nStorkerson and his companions were, even a 200-mile ice - pack journey by sledge —\n\nat the worst time of year has only routine difficulties and is without great\n\ndanger. Storkerson believed that the risk to life was perhaps comparable\n\nto that of coal mining or taxi driving.\n\nAn Eddy in the Pack ? As said, there is, in addition to the doubtful\n\narea north and west of Axel Heiberg Island, a second area where the direction\n\nof drift is highly problematic. From the zigzag nature of the Storkerson\n\ndrift, from his making good only 90 miles in six months (when the Karluk , a\n\nlittle to the west, cleared 600 miles in four months), and for other reasons,\n\nsome think there may be an eddy between the Point Barrow meridian and Banks\n\nIsland such that, if a floe were caught thereby, it might continue drifting\n\naround and around for many years, doubtless, however, to emerge finally south–\n\nbound through the Greenland-Franz Josef gap.\n\n055 | Vol_VII-0687\n\nEA-I.
