GAZETTEER Names of physical and cultural features appearing in JANIS 40, European USSR are those recommended by the United States Board on Geographic Names. These names are incorporated in the Preliminary NIS Gazetteer: USSR. 131. MAP APPRAISAL Cartography in Russia may be divided into two eras: 1) The period under the Tsarist Regime prior to 1919, and, 2) The period of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic dating from the revolution to the present. Political disruptions in Russia have resulted in many changes of cartographic policies. The year 1919 is selected as the dividing line of mapping eras inasmuch as that year marked the beginning of the first major change-over in Russian cartographic, geodetic, and topographic policies. A. General topographic maps (1) First era For nearly a century (1816-1910) prior to 1919, mapping of Tsarist Russia was desultory, uncoordinated, and with- out far-sighted planning for continuity. Triangulation was performed by the Tsarist Corps of Military Topographers, only as required sectionally, with- out planned consideration for the preservation of network bench marks. Apparently a vast majority of the bench marks, developed over scores of years, were completely lost because of improper security. About 28,000 miles of triangulation leveling were accom- plished and 3,900 astronomical positions were determined; yet of this considerable volume of data collected, probably less than 2,000 miles of leveling was usable later and only a few astronomical definitions have survived *. It is claimed that the only survey data taken over and used by the Soviets were those of the last ten years for certain areas including the triangulation network in the Caucasus. Included in the following study are topographic maps published under the direction of the Corps of Military Topographers (known as K.V.T. prior to 1919), with longi- Page XIII-1 tudes variously based on Pulkovo, Paris, or Ferro. Be- cause of the general obsolescence of the older verst ** sheets, series published contemporarily by other than Rus- sian authorities are not mentioned. (a) Maps at scale of 1:420,000: European Russia, 1:420,000, K.V.T. 1. DESCRIPTION.-This ten-verst set covered all of European Russia. As the series was constructed on Gauss's conical projection using Meridian Pulkovo with standard parallels 40? and 59?, there is considerable dis- tortion of distances near the sheet edges. Individual maps cover an area of approximately 3?30' E-W and 2'N-S. The actual source of the compilation and of the survey base is not indicated. Probably the old 1:42,000 one- verst survey was used because the required reduction of sheet lines fitted exactly. Originally the maps were steel-engraved monochromes, but as early as 1875 certain ones were printed in five colors. Relief is shown by hachures, augmented with spot eleva- tions. The vertical datum was based on the tide gage at Kronshtadt. Vegetation is portrayed by solid green overprinting with- out classification. Hydrography is shown in the usual manner with water-lining added. Urban areas are outlined and line-striped to scale. Buildings are shown in solid black. The population break- down, shown in legends of earlier sheets, is classified ac- cording to size and style of type, as well as by the number of buildings in communities. Later editions show popula- tions of communities in figures on the face of the map. Transportation facilities and utility lines are classified. The individual maps were originally designated by Arabic numbers, but as the series expanded, the addition of Roman numerals and capital letters was required. The lower margins of the maps include fairly compre- hensive general symbol legend and the verst-fractional scale. 2. EVALUATION.-Several facts contribute to the obsolescence of the above series : the impracticability of reconciling sheet lines and distance values to modern pro- jections, the haphazard methods of Tsarist sectional sur- veys, the differences in control datum values, the poor physical representation, and especially the general an- tiquity of the series. * According to a report by the Soviet State Geodetic Service, 1944. Original Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Chapter X111 Page XIII-2 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 JANIS 40 (b) Maps at scale of 1:126,000: European Russia, 1:126,000, K.V.T. 1. DESCRIPTION.-The three-verst maps were an in- dependent series from several viewpoints. Having been constructed on Bonne's projection, with Meridian Pulkovo, distances were true only at the intersection of the central parallel which was 550 N. Individual sheets cover an area of approximately 1?20' E-W and 27'N-S. Original nineteenth-century editions were steel-en- graved monochromes, while later Soviet-revised editions were multicolored lithographs. Meridians referring to Paris are ticked along the north and south neatlines of each map. Original coverage included most of the territory within the scope of this report with the exception of a few large areas in the northeast. Relief is shown by hachures with occasional spot heights given in sazhens*. Hydrographic drafting is orthodox. Vegetation is sym- bolized without classification. Urban areas are outlined to scale with population fig- ures added. Buildings are shown in solid black. Roads and railroads are indicated without classification. Later editions show a substantial amount of revision, particularly in communication alinement and hydro- graphic positions. 2. EVALUATION.-As can be seen from the above de- scription, the reliability of this set is very doubtful. The unequal values of the Bonne projection, together with hachured relief and general inaccuracies, make the map series a questionable source of information. (c) Maps at scale of 1:84,000: European Russia, 1:84,000, K.V.T. 1. DESCRIPTION.-This set is a two-verst intermedi- ary scale map series, originally published just before and during World War I. The maps were compiled from the older 1:21,000 and 1:42,000 K.V.T. sheets, in conjunction with a special survey made by Mende covering eight administrative areas. The projection was polyhedric, as described in 131, A, (1), (e), 1. Two sheet sizes were used, covering areas 20' N - S by 30'E-W and15'N-Sby27'E-W. The first editions were monochromes, followed later by multicolor printing. Relief is shown by contours at intervals of four sazhens, controlled by spot elevations and triangulation points. The general representation agrees. with that of the 1:126,000 series described in 131, A, (1), (b), 1. Sheets published during and after World War I carry a military grid. No legend is given. 2. EVALUATION.-Inasmuch as more accurate and informative sheets of much later date were published and are available, the two-verst series is interesting only from a historical viewpoint and does not hold a front-line posi- tion in the array of modern, reliable maps. (d) Maps at scale of 1:42,000: European Russia, 1:42,000, K.V.T. 1. DESCRIPTION.-The one-verst maps were con- structed on the polyhedric projection and covered an area 15' N- S by 10' E - W. Originally the printing was in monochrome; however, the productions revised by the Soviets were multicolored and were later used as a base for the 1:50,000 set described later in this study. Relief is shown by contour lines at intervals of two and four sazhens, coordinated to spot elevations and triangu- lation points. Source for compilation is not indicated, but, inasmuch as the one-verst scale was one of the primary survey bases, it is assumed that the sheets were compiled directly from field work. The general representation is similar to that of the 1:84,000 series described in 131, A, (1), (c), 1. 2. EVALUATION.-Time has definitely nullified any reliability of the original one-verst map. Probably the relief and drainage of many of the revised maps published later by the Soviets were fairly well done, but here again, the value of this set is overshadowed by later highly re- vised 1:50,000 maps covering the same area. (e) Maps at scale of 1:21,000: European Russia, 1:21,000, K.V.T. 1. DESCRIPTION.-These maps, known as the one- half-verst field sheets, were constructed on a polyhedric projection. The sheet corners were calculated separately for each map, which produced an overlap on the adjoin- ing sheet. The essential difference between this and the polyconic projection is that the north and south lines are drawn as a straight line connecting sheet corners, rather than following a true parallel. Individual maps of this set cover an area 7'15\" E - W by 5' N - S. While the base source is not explained, they were probably compiled from original surveys of the same scale. The maps do not appear in continuous series, but ap- parently were prepared for important areas near large cities. Relief is shown by contours at intervals of two sazhens, supplemented by spot elevations and triangulation points. The general presentation, while embracing more detail, is comparable to the description of the 1:84,000 set given in 131, A, (1), (c), 1. 2. EVALUATION.-While the polyhedric projection used is sound and presents no difficulty in recompilation, physical changes over the long lapse of time, plus doubt- ful accuracy of the original preparation, relegate this se- ries to the collector's folio. (2) Second era On March 5, 1919, following the historic revolution, the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree, signed by Lenin, creating the Supreme Geodetic Administration (V.G.U.). It was the task of this organization to make an exhaustive topographic study of all of the USSR, with the idea of bringing about a definite improvement in the development of economic possibilities. The highly optimistic decree authorized the V.G.U. pro- gram as follows : 1) Unification and coordination of the geodetic activity of all agencies of the republics. 2) Unification of all surveys in order to compile and publish maps of nation-wide importance at various scales. This necessitated elimination of duplication, and the collection, and collation of all data resulting from astronomical, geo- detic, and topographic surveys. 3) Formulation of specifications and policies for the stand- ardization of cartographic methods, computations, prepara- tions, and publications. The Administration was unable to support the decree by providing modern cartographic equipment or experienced specialists, nor would it give V.G.U. top authority for the project over equally powerful agencies which also sought recognition.

In the meantime, starting with V.G.U., one after another of the various top cartographic administrations suc- cumbed in the scramble for power. Eventually, in 1939, all map-producing agencies employ- ing civilian personnel were placed under the jurisdiction of the Chief, Administration of Geodesy and Cartography, (G.U.G.K.). Parallel to this political group, the Military Topographic Division of the General Staff, Red Army, functioned independently. Obviously, during World War II and in the period preceding it, these two top authorities worked, and still work, in full cooperation. While some standard-scale sheets appeared that were of necessity compiled from old material, generally, from 1939 forward General Staff Red Army maps of European USSR are of sound basis, apparently the result of able cartography. Many of the maps described later may have a good re- liability rating, but it must be remembered that certain military or critical information has likely been withheld. This is evidenced by a comparison of German photo- and field-revised sheets with their USSR prototypes. This policy of withholding critical information in map compila- tion is further confirmed by the secret Soviet order of 5 September 1940 entitled, \"Chief Administration for Ge- odesy and Cartography, General Instructions on Map- Making.\" Because of the magnitude of an exhaustive map ap- praisal of all scales by all authorities, it will be the policy in this section to review only later-date standard maps which show a substantial coverage available in the AMS library. Maps published by other than USSR authorities will be appraised according to a selection based on com- parable value. (a) Maps at scale of 1:1,000,000 1. EUROPEAN USSR, 1:1,000,000, GENERAL STAFF, RED ARMY a. Description.-The State Map of the RSFSR, published by G.U.G.K. and the General Staff, Red Army, after 1939, is constructed on the altered polyconic projec- tion, Prime Meridian Greenwich, in accordance with standard International Map of the World practice. The maps cover an area 6? E - W by 4? N - S, excepting those falling above the sixtieth north parallel, which are usually printed in pairs to include 12? E - W. Individual maps are identified with a letter according to latitude and a number according to longitude. They are also named after the most important urban area within the sheet lines. Example: The sheet falling in area 56? to 60? N and 30? to 36? E is named Leningrad and is numbered 0-36. In the color representation black indicates culture sym- bols, nomenclature, communications; brown, first-class roads; blue, hydrography; gray, relief; green, woodland; orange, graticule grid net. Relief is shown with labelled contour lines at 50-meter intervals, augmented by first-order triangulation points and occasional spot elevations. Hydrographic representation is orthodox. Shorelines and narrow streams receive the dark blue color; large rivers and lakes are light blue. The break-down includes canals and swamp areas. Vegetation appears in solid green tint, classified simply as woodland. In the legend, urban areas are classified in eight cate- gories, according to a combination of symbols and type, Original Page XIII-?3 which indicate urban population ranging from the small- est villages through cities of more than 75,000 inhabitants and which distinguish administrative centers. Communications are classified as follows: four types of railroads are indicated : double track, single track, narrow- gage lines, and those under construction. Three classes of roads are shown : main highways, gravelled and irri- proved dirt roads, and dirt roads. Maps are line-cut with a numbered and referenced graticule net coordinated to the geographical grid. Boundary lines include political and administrative de- marcations from international down to okrug. In the border of each map, aside from the sheet desig- nation and publishing authority, are found: a compre- hensive symbol legend, an index to adjoining sheets dia- gram, a standard kilometer bar scale, an index to bound- aries diagram, and a credit note which, in many cases, lists all source compilation material. Type face and style used in nomenclature is a fairly legible, roman bold variety in both verticals and italics. The above description applies directly to the later sheets of the series on file at Army Map Service, published be- tween 1939 and 1944. Previous editions, published by various civilian agencies somewhat responsible to the Gen- eral Staff, Red Army, present some differences in represen- tation, but are, in general, of the same type. A few sheets published directly by G.U.G.K., during this time, have hypsometric layer tints as a relief feature and indicate a variety of vegetation cover. Also, the nomen- clature is completely revised by the use of modern gothic type faces. In production of this wartime series, drafting skill was sacrificed to speed, and the poor quality of paper stock used in printing did not add to the quality of the finished maps. b. Evaluation.-This so-called State Map received special consideration from the topmost Soviet cartogra- phers. Under their influence it was developed from a com- mon general-utility map to the top spot of all Soviet carto- graphic work. While certain vital information such as airfields and communications has been omitted, as a base source at the scale involved, the USSR 1: 1,000,000 Red Army Mal) stands alone. 2. EUROPE, 1:1,000,000, GSGS, 2758 a. Description.-This topographic million set, compiled under the direction of the Geographical Section, General Staff, British War Office, was published provision- ally in several editions at the start of World War II. Occasional differences in cartographic policy, no doubt activated by wartime expediency, account for noticeable inconsistencies between editions. However, the genera[ description in this section pertains to the majority of sheets in the Army Map Service library. Individual sheets were plotted on standard I.M.W. modi- fied polyconic meridians and parallels, and covered a geo- graphic area of 6? E - W by 4? N - S. Those sheets above the sixtieth north parallel were extended E - W to include two or more standard maps. Sheets are designated by name and number according to I.M.W. practice. Representation, in four colors, uses: black, for symbols, railroads, nomenclature; red, roads, graticule grid references; blue, hydrography; and brown, for relief. Contoured relief is shown at 1.00-meter intervals for al- titudes under 200 meters, and at 200-meter intervals for altitudes above. Occasional spot elevations and triangu-.

Inasmuch as maps were com- piled primarily from smaller-scale sources, contouring is, of course, well generalized. First- and second-class urban areas are outlined to scale. Five other symbols indicating relative population are shown, including one which denotes administrative im- portance. Three classifications each of roads and railroads are shown. Soviet place names are transliterated. Generics and modifiers are romanized from original Russian form and are translated in a glossary of topographical terms and abbreviations appearing in the border of each sheet. Boundaries are referenced back to the year 1.914. Besides the usual legend, bar scales, and imprinting, the sheets carry an index to adjoining sheets diagram, an in- dex to boundary diagram, a glossary, and a credit note listing compilation sources. Sources given, which are entirely of non-modern Russian vintage, include : 1:420,000 Special Series 1:1,050,000 Strategic Set 1:1,680,000 Hypsometric 1:2,000,000 Atlas 1:2,520,000 Communications Guide b. Evaluation.-Comparison of individual sheets of this set with highly revised recent Soviet works reveal that factual representation is strictly outmoded. Relief is substantially inconsistent; hydrography shows much variance in alinement and shapes; communications are either missing or inaccurate, and much detail is lack- ing for the scale used. In short, the British Million set, published prior to the modern revised series, which is in compilation stage at this time, should be used with caution except as reference ma- trial. 3. SPECIAL EDITION, 1:1,000,000, GENERAL STAFF, GERMAN ARMY a. Description.-The maps of the Special Edition follow the sheet lines of the International Map of the World, with the geographic net drawn in full degrees of longitude and latitude. Each sheet covers an area of 6? longitude and 4? latitude. In maps of the far north, two adjacent sheets were frequently printed as a single map. In certain areas, probably deemed strategic, Zusam- mendru'cke-sheets were published, which consisted of four sheets incorporated into one. In this case a footnote qualifies the format as a combined reproduction of the four basic 1:1,000,000 Special Editions. Individual maps are identified by name, letter, and number. The USSR 1:1,000,000 State Map was the basic source material used for all maps in the European USSR area. However, in practically all cases, this source was aug- mented by the use of larger-scale Soviet topographic maps and smaller-scale Soviet atlas sheets. Relief is represented by contour lines and gradient tints. The contour interval used is 100 meters for irregular ter- rain and 25 meters in low areas. Numerous spot eleva- tions appear, as well as occasional trigonometrical points. Color representation carried by the Special Edition is: sepia for cultural features; blue, hydrography; red, roads; green, woodlands; brown, contours; and violet for bound- aries. Layer tints are shown by light green, shading to dark red-brown. USSR place names, as well as other notations and ab- breviations, have been replaced with German translitera- tions. Six categories of urban population are designated, also six types of administrative centers. Population symbols range from one for villages of under 10,000 to one for cities of over 100,000. Railroad symbols represent multiple track, single track, industrial or narrow gage, and lines under construction. Roads are shown by five categories, ranging from motor- express highway to winter trail. Symbolic representation for the scale used is more com- prehensive than in other series, including such features as factories, telegraph lines, ruins, mounds, and forest breaks. In this set, occasional vital information appears which is omitted in the original Russian sources. While the veracity of such information is not particularly doubted, no explanation of source is quoted. In fact, it may be assumed that the revised areas of these maps are a direct result of the vast amount of aerial photography completed by the Germans over the western portion of European USSR. Material in the map borders is comparable to that of the General Staff, Red Army, maps described in 131, A, (2), (a), 1, a. b. Evaluation.-As a supplementary general source of information, the Special Edition German Mil- lion may be considered fairly reliable. If used for re- drafting maps, however, caution should be used, because the Germans in recompiling from Soviet sources were not too accurate in portraying gages of symbols, such as width of streams, etc. In certain. areas, where aerial photography was avail- able, communications and other planimetric information may be accepted as being more reliable than on the origi- nal USSR base maps. (b) Maps at scale of 1:500,000 1. EUROPEAN USSR, 1:500,000, GENERAL STAFF, RED a. Description.-Primarily known as the Military Operational Series, the 1:500,000 maps were conceived in 1933 as the result of a demand for something comparable to the outmoded but popular 1:420,000 ten-verst sheets. The special requirements of the 1:500,000 map which was finally evolved were that it must fit modern sheet lines and projections; it must be sufficiently elaborate to suit the highly technical problems of the new army; and it must serve as a basis for economic development. The area covered by each map is 3' longitude by 2 ? lati- tude. Constructed on an improved polyhedral projection, Prime Meridian Greenwich, each sheet covers one-quarter part of the I.M.W. 1:1,000,000 area in which it falls and is correspondingly named and numbered. Example: Sheet NO-40-B would be the northeast quarter of the 1:1,000,000 sheet NO-40. Various sources for base compilation were used, depend- ing on available material, but generally source maps at scales between and including 1:10,000 and 1:500,000 were used. Maps are lithographed in colors: black indicates culture symbolization, roads, shorelines of bodies of water and of wide streams, railroads, nomenclature, elevations, bound- ary lines, sand areas; brown, contour lines; orange, main highways, graticule grid; blue, hydrography; and green, woodland. Relief is indicated by contour lines at intervals of 40 meters. To aid in quick reading of relative relief, the lowest contour line in a series is numbered. Size and shape of urban areas, which are drafted rather generally to scale, indicate their relative population. On later sheets, figures placed under city names apparently indicate population in hundred-thousands.

CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 MAP APPRAISAL Page XIII-5 of type face used for names of smaller towns indicate their administrative importance. Population break-down of urban areas includes nine categories ranging from cities over 500,000 to those of less than 20,000, and towns over 2,000 to those under 100. Cultural symbolization includes important industries, agricultural works, economic institutions, collective farms, and churches. The road symbolization break-down includes all-weather highways, improved dirt roads and those of lesser im- portance such as plain dirt roads and trails, all without structure or width analysis. Double track, single track, and narrow gage or indus- trial, are categories of railroads which are indicated. A noticeable variance from the usual method of depict- ing shorelines of lakes and double-line streams appears in this set, in that these appear in black. Otherwise, general delineation of hydrography is orthodox. In this set of maps it seems quite apparent that an un- cluttered appearance and legibility were more desirable than excessive naming of smaller urban areas and river tributaries. Generally, the maps are quite easy to read. Many of the maps show a military grid system. Heavy orange lines enclose an area 1 ? longitude by 30' latitude, which in turn is subdivided, with light lines, into nine small numbered rectangles. At the top border of the maps, from left to right, appear: 1) The administrative oblasts covered. 2) General Staff, Red Army, publishing authority. 3) The sheet title. 4) The sheet letter, number, and section. At the lower border, from left to right, appear: 1) The legend, apparently tailored for each map. 2) An index to adjoining sheets diagram. 3) A bar scale, usually of 30-kilometer length. 4) The contour interval. 5) A magnetic variation note. 6) An index to boundaries diagram. 7) A credit note, indicating compilation dates and source material information. b. Evaluation.-The planning and development of this set directly reflect its value. Within the limits of the reproduction scale, it is a well-organized general plan- ning and military operational series. Allowing for prob- able Red Army omissions, the individual sheets may be considered generally reliable. 2. DEUTSCHE WELTKARTE, 1: 500,000, GENERAL STAFF, GERMAN ARMY a. Description.-This set is evidently redrafted from captured USSR 1:500,000 maps, with the same sheet lines used. The Gauss-Kruger projection was used, with Prime Meridian Greenwich, which for all practical pur- poses is similar to the modified polyconic projection used on the original Soviet maps. Individual sheet names have been romanized and trans- lated into German, and in the sheet-numbering system, NO, NE, SO, and SE, have been substituted for the Soviet quarter-sections, A, B, C, D. While the maps are copies of captured USSR originals, scattered revisions or additions were made by the Germans just prior to printing, probably from intelligence or air reconnaissance sources. Maps are lithographed in color: black indicates culture symbolization, roads, shorelines of bodies of water and wide streams, railroads, nomenclature, elevations, boundary lines; orange, main highways and urban areas; brown,: relief; blue, hydrography and names thereof; green, wood-11 and pink, graticule grid. Contour lines at intervals of 40 meters portray variations of relief. As on the original USSR maps, the lowest con- tour line in a series is numbered. The only material differences in the German portrayal of urban areas lie in the drafting, which has been some- what generalized, and in the color. All urban areas of populations between 2,000 and 500,000 are shown by red fill. The population break-down varies slightly from sheet to sheet, but generally indicates classification down to villages of less than 100 inhabitants. Roads are classified as motor highway, motor highway under construction, road with substructure, dirt road, village road, caravan route, track-trail, winter road, or forest road. Classifications of railroads are electrically operated, double track, single track, narrow gage, under construc- tion, planned, or abandoned. The Germans have retained the Soviet method of show- ing shorelines in black for bodies of water. The single deviation from the original USSR maps lies in the names of hydrographic features, which are printed in blue in this series. The superimposed military grid reference system is similar to the Soviet type; however, a different key refer- ence numbering method is used. Quite a radical change was made in the composition of map marginal information. The Germans have placed a very comprehensive symbol legend, consisting of 117 separate items, in the right-hand margin. Below the legend appears a list of abbreviations used on the face of the map. The lower margin carries the usual credit note, index to boundaries, 30-kilometer bar scale and index to ad- joining sheets diagram. In addition, below the bar scale is a list of Gauss-Kruger grid values for the four corners of the sheet. b. Evaluation.-It is probable that, in many in- stances, the Germans were able to make spot revisions of the existing USSR cartography from intelligence data or photography; however, the source used is not listed in the credit notes. In general, spot revisions may be accepted as authentic, particularly on maps falling west of a rough line drawn as follows: beginning at a point at the extreme northwest tip of Kandalakshskaya Guba, above the Arctic Circle, run- ning southward along the west shore of Lake Onega, veer- ing west of Leningrad, thence generally southeasterly skirting west of Moscow, making an are to include Stalin- grad, then southward nearly to Groznyy, then veering di- rectly west at this point to Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. Not only were the Germans in prolonged possession of much of this area, but their engineers and terrain special- ists were systematically engaged in revising the mapping of the area of conquest from on-the-spot observation. German air reconnaissance supplied a great deal of ma- terial for map revision, even some distance east of the area of ground control, but to what extent is not known at this time. Generally the information supplied in this map series can be accepted as reliable. (c) Maps at scale of 1:300,000 1. SPECIAL EDITION, USSR, 1:300,000, GENERAL STAFF, GERMAN ARMY a. Description.-This main strategic map series used by the Germans during the invasion of the USSR was published under the control of the German General Staff, in several varieties of Special Editions. Original Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Page XI-II-6 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 JANIS 40 Inasmuch as all these later editions used similar geo- graphic sheet lines, numbering systems, and base mate- rial, this description can be generally accepted for all edi- tions under such general titles as Deutsche Heereskarte Osteuropa, Ubersichtskarte von Mitteleuropa, Sonderaus- gaben Nordeuropa and Osteuropa, and subtitles as Flie- gerausgabe, Fuhrungskarte, or Zusammendrucke. Together the sets cover a solid block area of European USSR extending from the western USSR boundary to 64?20' E of Greenwich between the 44th parallel on the south and the 70th parallel on the north. Individual sheets are constructed on a Gauss-Kruger projection according to full degrees of latitude and longi- tude, and cover an area 2 ? E - W by 1 ? N - S. However, since the original structure of the basic 1:300,000 set was projected on Prime Meridian Ferro (17?40' W of Green- wich), the Germans apparently converted the geographic values for the later sets to fit a projection based on this meridian. The result was that the longitudinal values of each sheet fell 20' east of even degrees Greenwich. Sheet names were taken from the most prominent popu- lated place within the sheet lines. Sheet number indi- cates the latitude north of the equator in degrees, and a sheet letter indicates its longitudinal position on an arbi- trary grid index. The extreme westerly limit of this ar- bitrary grid, labeled A, was set at 11 ? 40' W of Greenwich, apparently allowing sufficient longitude to clear the west- erly land limits of Europe in case of an extension to the series. Example : the map designated as Leningrad, V-60 oc- cupies a geographic position 28?20' E to 30?20' E and 59? to 60? N. In printing the Zusammendrucke edition, several sheets were joined and published as a single map. Individual sheets of several other published sets were combinations of four or six smaller sheets. In all cases, the Zusam- mendrucke was named and numbered according to the names and number of the upper left and lower right base sheets. Examples: sheet designated X52 - Y-50, Kono- top - Charkow, comprised of six base maps covering an area 32?20' E to 36?20' E of Greenwich and 49? to 50? N. The usual multicolor lithography is: sepia representing culture, communications, boundaries, general nomencla- ture; brown, relief; blue, hydrography and names thereof; green, woodland; and orange, main highways, urban areas, military grid. Apparently the Germans selected a sepia tone instead of black to preclude overemphasis of any par- ticular color. General nomenclature of the map bodies has been trans- literated into German and all abbreviations are listed in the sheet order. However, a tendency to overname that has resulted from the anxiety to depict every possible strategic feature, necessitates a wide variety of type sizes. Wherever it was justified from source material, a 20- meter contour interval was standardized for this set. Even though the base material was taken occasionally from 1:1,000,000 or smaller-scale maps having 100-meter contour intervals, the Germans interpolated for 20 meters. This usually occurred, in areas above the 60th parallel. Substantiating their contour scheme, a selected number of bench marks and triangulation points were sufficiently interspersed on the sheets to provide fairly good control. Apparently the 1:100,000 standard USSR topographic maps were considered the ideal base for the structure of this set and were used wherever obtainable. However, the larger-scale maps at 1:50,000 and 1:200,000 were used in considerable number, supplemented with smaller-scale topographic, political, economic, and Soviet Atlas maps including 1:5,000,000 for areas where larger-scale cover- age was not available. - Ground cover has been indicated, wherever known, in twelve classifications including such features as forest, tundra, sand or rocky wastes, grasslands and marsh. Road classification, conditional to area, includes through highways, roads with good substructure, roads with little substructure, improved dirt roads, other roads, paths or forest trails, winter roads, and corduroy roads. Rail communications include multiple and single track in standard USSR broad gage, industrial and secondary rail lines, narrow-gage lines, railroads under construction or abandoned, and station sites. A simplified break-down of populated places indicates large cities above 100,000, medium cities between 30,000 and 100,000, small cities between 5,000 and 30,000, small towns under 5,000, and large and small villages. The size of type face naming urban areas indicates the position of each area in the above break-down. All urban areas have been outlined and accentuated with an orange fill. Iso- lated buildings are shown in solid sepia. Depiction of streams, waterways, lakes, etc., is entirely comprehensive in standard treatment, larger bodies of water being shown by solid light-blue fill. Wells, springs, water tanks, canals, and dry river beds are included in this picture. Besides a standard 10,000-meter military grid showing on all sheets, the Filegerausgabe maps include a rose- colored flight grid based upon a 1 ?-square geographic graticule, which in turn is numbered and subdivided to show 10' E - W by 5' N-- S reference squares. The top border gives the series number, a special edition classification, the general set name, an edition number, and the sheet number and name. Material in the right and lower borders is exceptionally comprehensive. In the right border appears a symbol legend including 91 sepa- rate items. Below that is printed a list of other items used on the map proper. Next, a coordinate scale for the army grid is shown with instructions for use in designa- tion of control points. From left to right in the lower border the following items are shown : source material credit note, base map data diagram, base map correction diagram, political bound- aries diagram, 15-kilometer bar scale, map authority and date, index to adjoining sheets diagram, declination pro- tractor scale, declination diagram and note. b. Evaluation.-Within certain limits, particu- larly where a combination of late Soviet large-scale sources was used together with intelligence and aerial photog- raphy, these sheets may be used with considerable con- fidence. - The supply of good source material diminished as the Germans extended this set toward the east and north; the reliability of the set reduced accordingly, particularly where physical features are concerned. Yet in mapped areas where the relief portrayal is strictly unreliable or even non-existent, the planimetric portrayal is considered fairly reliable, probably due to capable intelligence. In general, any use of these maps should be primarily based on an individual examination of source material listings. 2. MILITARY GEOGRAPHY MAP, EASTERN EUROPE, (MIL-GEO-KARTE) 1:300,000, GENERAL STAFF, GERMAN ARMY a. Description.-Basically this set is identical with the Special Edition, 1:300,000, described under 131, A, (2), (c), 1, a. In fact, the Mil-Geo material was simply overprinted on the latest available sheets of that set. Original Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 MAP APPRAISAL As an adjunct to the aforementioned set the Germans simultaneously assembled and compiled military geo- graphic and intelligence material particularly adaptable to a substantial number of standard sheets. This mate- rial was assembled on a single color plate and applied by purple overprint on the map proper, the enlarged border, and the reverse side, including separate legends and city plans. The overprint type was designed as a large, single- stroke, futura style to assist reading over the type of the original base map. Inasmuch as the greatest value of individual maps in this set is based entirely on the German portrayal of im- portant military information by combining text and sym- bols, the following description concerns this method of portrayal. As the policies and symbolization specifications for the Mil-Geo maps were developed, the Germans published ex- planatory booklets regarding the use of signs and symbols for use both by the map compiler and by the user. Three of these are noted: 1) Kartenzeichen fur Militargeographische Sonderkarten, Entwurf 1941. (Conventional Signs for Military-Geograph- ical Special Maps, Plan 1941). 2) Signatures fur Militargeographische Sonderkarten, vor- laufiger Entwurf 1943. (Symbols for Military-Geograph- ical Special Maps, Provisional Plan 1943). 3) Kartenzeichen fur Militargeographische Karten mit An- hang: Verzeichnis von Abkilrzenyen in Mil-Geo-Texten, Entwurf 1944. (Conventional Signs for Military-Geograph- ical maps, with Supplement: Index of Abbreviations in Mil- Geo Text, Plan 1944). A more intelligent interpretation of the set as a whole is possible through the use of the above booklets, par- ticularly the latest edition which supersedes the two pre- vious editions. Following is a classified listing of Mil-Geo signs and symbols which appear, where applicable, in the purple overprint : 1) Land forms and vegetation. 2) Coastal features. 3) Harbor types. 4) Waterway obstructions. 5) Water feature detail. 6) Bridge types. 7) Highways, roads, railroads, and traffic features. 8) Military, buildings. militarily useful, and public establishments or 9) Utilities (supply establishments). 10) Cultural features (an exhaustive grouping of economic and agricultural features). Primarily, the border material on the individual map is the key to its interpretation; without it the map would be a confusing mass of numbers and symbols. This map- qualifying information is listed in order of appearance on the border of each map : 1) General Description: a) Agricultural organization. b) Land forms description. c) Soil description. d) Vegetation description. e) Climate data. f) Water features. g) Populations and settlements. h) Agriculture. i) Communications. 2) Coastal Description: under this heading certain lengths of coast are located and described. 3) Town Description: under this heading the largest, or often a group of the largest or most important urban areas, are described textually. These areas will also be found on the reverse side of the sheet in large-scale blowups. Original Page XIII-7 4) Numerically Keyed Military Object Gazetteer: under the German heading, Objectverzeichnis appears a listing of numbers together with accompanying text, followed by an atlas coordinate reference. These numbers appear once in the map proper next to a special symbol, and the text describes the object at that position. The atlas reference is simply the German military grid squares which have been referenced in standard form along the map neatlines with a letter on one side and a number on the other. Apparently the Germans considered bridges of top im- portance for this type of detailed map, because all bridge locations were exhausted in the first section of this keyed list before descriptions of other types of objects were in- troduced at the end. This listing was of such length, often running into hundreds of objects, that it was con- tinued to the reverse side of the map. As mentioned above, the reverse side of these maps usually carries at least one large-scale city plan of the im- portant cities in the area. These were not always com- piled from up-to-date sources, but they do include a sub- stantial amount of military information in the purple overprint. Each city thus represented has its own nu- merically keyed text for locating sites and objects. Other indices include : 1) A general legend of symbols most frequently used; 2) A legend of economic symbols peculiar to each separate map; and 3) A glossary of ab- breviations used in the text. The reader should bear in mind that, in many cases, the Germans were unable to compile exhaustively informative maps; therefore, while some sheets are literally covered on both sides with purple overprint, others show little ad- ditional information or are lacking city plan back-ups. b. Evaluation.-In view of the fact that field- check verification is impossible and that available aerial photography (out-of-date) has not been subjected to a careful comparison with the German 1:300,000 Mil-Geo set, a precise evaluation is withheld and a probable evalu- ation submitted. It is believed that certain characteristics are portrayed accurately, such as agricultural organization, land forms description, soil and vegetation, climatic data and other characteristics that develop over the years and do not change suddenly. Neither do road networks nor other communications de- velop or disappear overnight; however, their condition may change quite rapidly, which is highly important from a military viewpoint. Probable or even certain location of bridges may be ac- cepted simply by inspecting the drainage pattern, yet the characteristics of construction, load values, etc., are not permanent, particularly in an area where general military destruction has occurred. When positive military knowledge is sought, however, such facts, together with descriptions and locations of economic structures such as typed industrial plants, heavily based on intelligence reports during a time of war, should be accepted as probabilities only. (d) Maps at scale of 1:200,000: European USSR, 1.200,000, General Staff, Red Army 1. DESCRIPTION.-The Soviets apparently produced this intermediary-scale set for strategic and economic as- sessment purposes. Compilation incorporated surveys dated from 1932 to 1942, also 1:100,000 and 1:50,000 USSR maps dating from 1924, with corrections and printing proceeding from 1939 to late 1942. Based on a modified polyconic projection, the set uses Prime Meridian Greenwich. The Gauss-Kruger military grid is used in 10,000-meter intervals. Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Page XIII-8 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 JANIS 40 The standard maps cover an area 1 ? E - W by 40' N - S, following I.M.W. sheet lines, thereby assuming a geo- graphic area equal to 1/36th of a standard I.M.W. sheet. During the early period of World War II, many standard sheets were combined to form double and quadruple maps, probably for strategic planning purposes.- In the usual lithographic representation brown repre- sents relief; blue, hydrography; red, roads; green, wood- land; black, cultural. symbolization, communications, and nomenclature; and purple, boundaries. Maps published in 1942 carry a red fill for main high- ways and a yellow fill for secondary highways; other roads are shown in black. Relief on earlier sheets is shown by contours at 10- and 20-meter intervals, tied to triangulation and astronomic points and survey markers. Contouring of later sheets is shown at 40-meter intervals with 20-meter auxiliaries. A comprehensive classification of vegetation is shown, as well as peatbog, marsh, swamp, sand, and steppe. For- ests are portrayed by symbols for deciduous and conifer- ous trees, with distinction made for burned and cut-over areas and scrub growth. Streams, as well as ferries and fords are indicated, and wells, springs, deep and shallow navigable canals, glaciers, intermittent streams, irrigation canals, and above-ground and underground water conduits complete the hydro- graphic portrayal. Roads are fairly well classified as two classes of high- ways, improved and regular dirt roads, corduroy roads, tracks, and.winter trails. Railroads, include single- and double-line trackage, nar- row-gage, lines under construction or dismantled, and electrified lines. Populated urban areas are classified by symbols and type sizes into eight groups, ranging from settlements of under 100 inhabitants to cities of over 100,000. Conventional symbols are used to indicate location of isolated buildings or objects, high-tension lines, mines, airdromes, factories, etc. Aside from a very representative symbol legend, the sheet borders are not especially informative. The lower border contains information regarding the map author- ity, a 10-kilometer bar scale, an index showing the map position in reference to the million-scale map in which it falls, and occasional information regarding boundaries, but base source material used in compilation is seldom indicated. 2. EVALUATION.-Since this is the only topographic set at 1:100,000 scale covering a major, portion of Euro- pean USSR, it is considered valuable for general reference and for the factual data within limits of the scale. Some caution is advised in the use of sheets of earlier date as the Soviet compilation was not particularly ac- curate. However, the compilation of maps published about 1942 is apparently well-executed and may be used with a considerable degree of confidence. While individually the maps do not portray the wealth of information found in the German 1:300,000 set, from a topographic standpoint they do bridge the gap between the Soviet 1:100,000 and 1:500,000 sheets. (e) Maps at scale of 1:100,000 1. EUROPEAN USSR, 1:100,000, GENERAL STAFF, RED a. Description.-This set was produced mainly for military use at close range and was intended for dis- tribution to lower-ranking officers during real or simulated warfare. Surveys dating from 1875 through 1929 were used in the compilation of this set. A substantial number of the sheets of later date simply quote the USSR 1:50,000 (1926 to 1941) as source base, but many sheets give compilation credit to available aerial photography. However, included in the make-up of this set is material drawn from 1:25,000 and 1:42,000 topographic maps, together with a mixture of smaller scale 1:126,000 and 1:250,000 political and planimetric sheets of 1883 vintage onward, plus revision data from 1916 to 1941. As with the USSR 1:200,000 map, a polyhedric projec- tion based on Prime, Meridian Greenwich was used, to- gether with the Gauss-Kruger military grid net. These maps include an area 30' E - W by 20' N - S and fit standard I.M.W. sheet lines, being numbered from 1 to 144 under the parent I.M.W. designation, such as N-36-144. Relief is shown by contours at 20-meter intervals with 10-meter auxiliaries in flat areas. While the accuracy of the contouring is not proven, it is well supported by numer- ous trigonometrical points and a variety of bench marks which suggest a well-controlled mapping process. The description in the succeeding paragraphs will also apply to the German 1:100,000 and both the Soviet and German 1:50,000 maps, which are appraised further in this study. In order to make an intelligent reading of the map proper, the user should have access to one of the published explanatory-symbol pamphlets prepared particularly for this scale range. Because of the abundance of symbol classifications used, it was impossible to include a symbol legend in the map border. Three pamphlets are available in the Army Map Service library. 1) Uslovnyye Znaki i obraztsy Shriftov dlya topograftcheskikh Kart, Masshtabov 1:25,000, 1:50,000, 1:100,000.

Army Map Service Technical Man- ual No. 17. 1st ed., November 1946. On distribution to authorized agencies. While many monochromes were published, these maps are predominantly in four colors: black indicates culture, communications, nomenclature; blue, hydrography; brown, relief; and green, woodland. A complete catalog of all abbreviations used in the maps will be found in the original Soviet or German explanatory symbol pamphlets. The following paragraphs list the principal symbol classifications with a brief description of features that may be included in each category. Populated Places: In this category may be found cities of all description, rural and scattered settlements, indi- vidual dwellings, camps, state farms, homesteads, nomad settlements, permanent fort sites, barns, and ruins. Industry, Agriculture, and Other Objects: In this cate- gory may be found numerous examples of industrial and economic plants, mines, storage tanks, radio stations, air- ports, tractor stations, meteorological stations, rocks, caves, volcanos, monuments, churches, cemeteries, etc. Orientation and Fixed Points : A wide range of geodetic control is included in this grouping as well as many fixed objects such as chimneys, towers, pinnacles, buoys, light- houses, submerged rocks, wells, windmills, etc. Boundaries and Enclosures: In this grouping are found national, administrative, and rayon boundaries, telephone and telegraph lines, low and high-tension lines, oil lines, fences, walls, hedges, embankments, and trenches.

This category also includes tracks, trails, winter trails, and caravan trails. Gardens, Industrial Plantations: Included here are parks, orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and larger planta- tions of rice, cotton, tobacco, etc. Forests : Besides showing the location of the two main genera of trees, burned-out or cut-over areas are indicated, as well as age of forests, swampy forests, brushwood, glades, etc., together with an indication as to the degree of passability. Meadows, Marshes, Steppes, Sandy Deserts: Various combinations of symbols in this grouping qualify the above break-down into areas showing actual terrain conditions. Rivers and River Crossings: A very exhaustive symboli- zation under this heading gives a complete picture of all types of rivers, canals, ditches, conduits, etc., including widths, navigability, obstacles, etc. Also shown are bridges, ferries, landings, docks, shoals, rapids, etc. Soils and Terrain Formations: A fairly complete listing of relief configuration and types is indicated here. Sym- bolization encompasses contour lines, spot elevations, soundings, karst, areas of perpetual snow, glaciers, slopes, rocky formations, ledges, gorges, sand and gravel condi- tions, and mountain passes. In the top border of the 1:100,000 scale map is usually found the edition number, the responsible authority, sheet number and the administrative area of the map. Appear- ing in the lower border are the names of cartographers and editors who prepared the map, a gradient-key diagram, occasionally an index to adjoining sheets, a 6- or 8-kilo- meter bar scale, a declination diagram and a short credit note of source material. b. Evaluation.-Considering the extent of avail- able coverage, the exhaustive symbolization and the com- pilation material involved, the 1:100,000 USSR map is the best large-scale map for over-all topographic purposes. In any case, the user should consider the economic changes which have occurred since these maps were published. To date, the accuracy of contouring has not been checked, but it seems that errors probably exist, inasmuch as all the original surveys were not based on the same geodetic data. In their eastern advance, the German Army surveyors were able to check a portion of the USSR 1:100,000 map with the following results: Trigonometric points . . . . ? 20 m. Remainder of the point field . , . -?- 40-60 m. Accuracy, of contour lines . . . . ? 2.5 m. 2. EUROPEAN USSR, 1:100,000 GENERAL STAFF, GER- MAN ARMY, TROOP AND SPECIAL EDITIONS a. Description.-In the German attempt to pro- duce an outstanding troop map of the USSR, at 1:100,000 scale during the early stages of World War II from good captured base maps, it was necessary to use odd-scale mis- cellaneous maps for preliminary compilation. The result- ing maps, called \"Special Editions,\" were used until such time as newly captured USSR maps, gradually made avail- able, enabled the Germans to supplant this edition with well-based Troop Editions. Original Page XIII-9 The maps are geographically similar to their Soviet counterparts, with the same type of projection and mili- tary grid net. The original Special Editions were compiled of necessity from all types of map sources, including USSR 1:100,000,, 1:200,000, 1:500,000, 1:84,000 and 1:420,000. Finnish maps at 1:50,000, 1:100,000 and 1:400,000 were also used. in border areas. The early Troop Edition consisted of hasty, pirated im- pressions of newly captured USSR maps,without transla- tion. Gradually these sheets were revised, transliterated, and published for troop operations. Later-dated sheets generally indicate a USSR 1:100,000 source with occasional sheets based on 1:50,000 maps. , As the frontier advanced, German aerial photography .came into use and many cap- tured maps show complete photo revision. By and large, these maps might well be called duplicates of the USSR 1:100,000 sheets in color and symbolization. The only practical difference lies in the transliteration of Russian names and abbreviations into German. Until the Germans were able to reproduce a symboliza- tion pamphlet guide for these maps, they printed a partial symbol legend in each sheet border. However, the borders of later 1943 and 1944 maps contain only source credit note, revision area diagram, declination diagram, 6-kilo- meter bar scale, index to adjoining sheets diagram, contour diagram, and publisher's note. In addition to the Troop Edition (Truppenausgab,e) and Special Edition (Sanderausgabe) this set includes the Zusammendrucke (combined maps) of both editions. Aside from slight variations in border information, the Zusammendrucke sheets carried identical information and simply covered a greater area; strategic planning, no doubt, was the reason for their appearance. b. Evaluation.-Wherever possible, ,these maps should be compared individually with the Soviet originals in order to avail a selection of desired pertinent informa- tion. Where the Germans simply made a photo-lith copy of the original captured USSR map, the latter should be given primary consideration, inasmuch as some detail was lost and original drafting became somewhat indistinct in re- production. When only the German map is available, it should be used with caution determined by the extent of-information given in the credit note. In many cases, through control of territory or aided by aerial photography, the Germans were able to improve on the factual and planimetric representation of the original Soviet maps; however, this may best be judged after an individual sheet examination. (f) Maps at scale of 1:50,000 1. EUROPEAN USSR, 1:50,000, GENERAL STAFF, RED a. Description.-This is the largest-scale set pro- duced by the Soviets as a correlated series prior to 1938, published for practical military application at close range. It is still in production. Individual maps were compiled from combined surveys and available material dated from 1891 to 1933 with many later revisions and recompilations. Survey bases used in compilation included material at scales of 1:21,000, 1:42,- 000, 1:25,000, and 1:50,000. Certain sheets were revised from 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 field reconnaissance, and others were photo-corrected from interpolations at the, scales of 1:10,000, 1:50,000, and 1:100,000. The map series was constructed on the Gauss-Kruger projection, using Prime Meridian Greenwich, together with Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Page XIII-10. Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 JANIS 40 omw a 1,000-meter military grid pattern. Geographically the individual maps cover an area 15' E - W by 10' N - S, fitting I.M.W. sheet lines. At this sheet size it requires 576 1:50,000-scale maps to make one standard Million Map. Portrayal of general relief is by contour lines at 10-meter intervals with 5-meter auxiliaries in flat or steep areas. Geodetic control, particularly on later maps, is profuse. Some sheets, compiled during the transition from the old verst maps, and published by U.V.T. (Administration of Military Topographers) about 1934, retained the orig- inal contouring at 4-sazhen (8.53 meters) intervals. How- ever, these maps carry a metric conversion graph in the border to facilitate altitude reading. In the body of the map, the contours are labeled to the nearest meter, such as 213 or 222. These maps are mentioned because an occasional one is needed to fill a gap in the standard set. For description of the map proper see previous descrip- tion for the 1:100,000, USSR maps, 131, A, (2), (e), 1, and 2. The only material difference in the sheet border is the bar scale which in this case is for two and four kilometers. b. Evaluation.-For clarification of topographic detail the 1:50,000 set is a valuable companion to the 1: 100,000 scale close-range sheet. It is also possible, in some cases, that the 1:50,000 sheets may contain later revisions than indicated on the available smaller-scale maps covering the same territory. 2. GERMAN ARMY MAP, TROOP EDITION (DEUTSCHE HEERESKARTE), USSR, 1:50,000, GENERAL STAFF, GERMAN ARMY a. Description.-The first 1:50,000 maps of USSR territory, published by the Germans, were monochrome printings of original captured maps, mostly of early vin- tage. In their haste to print them, the Germans were able to insert only a few name transliterations, a warning re- garding the military grid, and a reproduction date. Gradually an improved series of maps was compiled. using USSR 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 bases dating mainly from 1923 to 1929. Communications were corrected from 1:500,000 maps of later date, and a substantial amount of photo-revision was done from air-photo data up to the end of the war. The Gauss-Kruger projection and military grid were re- tained with the addition of 'an orange overprint accentuat- ing grid lines. Nomenclature of the maps of later date has been entirely transliterated.. For a comprehensive description of the character of the map proper see that written for the USSR 1:100,000 map previously appraised, 131, A, (2), (e), 1, and 2. The sheet border is substantially similar, in detail, to the border of the smaller-scale German 1: 100,000 map, with the exception of the bar scale, which is of 4-kilometer length. b. Evaluation.-The value of this series as a whole is not great. Individual maps may be of extreme importance, primarily when the Soviet counterpart is not available. Certain sheets which carry revision detail of later date, particularly when obtained from acceptable sources such as aerial photography, may well have a positive value beyond any other available map, depending entirely on the type of information sought. B. Aeronautical charts The USAF Aeronautical Chart Service is responsible for all aeronautical charts of western USSR produced in the United States, except the V-30 series of the U.S. Hydro- graphic Office. The Army Map Service, however, has re- printed the British Europe (Air) series at 1:500,000 and 1:250,000, but these large-scale charts provide only partial coverage of the area. The most useful aeronautical charts are three series published by the Aeronautical Chart Serv- ice: the World Aeronautical Chart series at 1:1,000,000 for large-scale coverage, the Aeronautical Planning Chart series at 1:5,000,000 for strategic planning, and the USAF Equidistant Chart Centered near Sverdlovsk, USSR at 1:24,327,708 for its highly specialized use. In the following discussion aeronautical charts are listed according to scale, the smallest scale being considered first. German and locally produced air charts are omitted be- cause they add little to the information given on the maps selected. Any additional information they may contain is being used in the revision or recompilation of USAF maps at all scales. (1) The Aeronautical Planning Chart series, 1:5,000,000; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service These sheets described-Russia 5W, base compiled July 1945; aeronautical information September 1945; isogonic data 1945 and Iran 12W, base compiled March 1945; aero- nautical information February 1946; isogonic data 1943- are on the Lambert conformal conic projection with a 1-degree grid. The base shows hydrographic features in excellent detail, gradient tints, spot elevations in feet, rail- roads, roads, international boundaries and boundaries of union republics as of 1937, cities classified roughly by size, and a table of geographic equivalents. Airports are classi- fied as land or sea bases and according to administration, facilities, and length of longest runway. The quality and extent of railroads and roads is somewhat exaggerated. Original USSR maps without supporting trimetrogon air surveys were used for most of the Soviet Union. Re- vised editions of the 1: 5,000,000 series are planned, but not for release in the immediate future. The new editions will be compiled from the World Aeronautical Chart series at 1:1,000,000. (2) The Long Range Air Navigation Chart series, 1:3,000,000; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service This series contains the following maps: No. 5, Scandinavia; base data compiled February 1944, revised April 1945; aeronautical information July 1945; Lambert conformal conic projection, magnetic variation for 1943. No. 6, Novaya Zemlya; base compiled March 1944; aeronauti- cal information April 1944; Lambert conformal conic pro- jection. No. 14, Western Europe; base compiled January 1944; aero- nautical information May 1944; Mercator projection with true scale along 50? N. No. 15, Caspian Sea; base compiled March 1944, aeronautical information April 1944; Mercator projection with true scale along latitude 50? N. Detailed radio and airport information is presented on a base showing contour gradients, spot elevations in feet, 1938 international boundaries, towns classified by popula- tion, railroads, and generalized hydrography. The draft- ing is poor, especially for the larger rivers, newly estab- lished Soviet cities are omitted, and the alignment of recently constructed railroads is inaccurate. (3) The V-30 Air Navigation Chart series, 1:2,188,800; U. S. Hydrographic Office These naval plotting charts, sheets 4, 6, 14, and 15, are on the Mercator projection. The base for sheets 4, 6, and Original Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 MAP APPRAISAL 15.was compiled in 1943; that for sheet 14 in 1946. Aero- nautical data are for the period 1943-47. Shorelines and elevations show conspicuously on a background giving rivers, contour lines at 1,000-foot intervals, cities, and in- ternational boundaries. Magnetic variation is shown. Twelve types of land and seaplane bases are indicated and described according to length of longest runway and radio facilities. (4) The World Aeronautical Chart series, 1:1,000,000; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service Twenty-eight sheets on the Lambert conformal conic projection cover the entire area. The base was compiled in 1944-45; the aeronautical data, 1944-47. Spot elevations in feet and gradient tints give elevation in western USSR with the exception of relatively small areas in the northeastern part of European USSR, where hachures are used. In addition to navigation lights, radio stations and detailed aiifield data, all sheets show rail- roads, three types of roads, and towns classified by popu- lation. International and union republic boundaries as of `1937 appear on all sheets and oblast boundaries on some. The sheets are not consistent with each other or within themselves. On a single sheet the legends and contents of the map do not always agree. Internal boundaries should be given on all sheets of the set or on none. The Murmansk railroad, shown on the other sheets, has not been continued on sheet 51. This error is corrected on the new base as of 1946. Town classification of smaller places, alinement of newer railroads, and road classifi- cation are not adequate. In spite of these criticisms, a high degree of selectivity has been maintained throughout the set; and, for the most part, recent large-scale source material has been used in compilation. The latest edi- tions show considerable improvements in the presentation of physical as well as cultural detail. Since no trimetrogon photography or flight checking is available for the USSR, it is difficult to evaluate relia- bility of these charts. The program of chart revision now in progress involves a .careful. evaluation of all new source material and the inclusion of whatever data seems pertinent. (5) The USAF Pilotage Chart series, 1:500,000; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service The 24 sheets of this set cover all European USSR south of 56?N and west of 38?30'E; base compiled 1943-45; mag- netic variation for 1943; aeronautical data 1945-46; Lam- bert conformal conic projection. Hydrographic features and contour gradients are shown in considerable detail. Spot elevations are in feet; towns are classified according to population; and distinction is made between single- and double-track railroads, and between primary and second- ary roads. Type and symbols used in the legend to desig- nate different classes of towns are not always consistent with those used on the charts. Except for Memel, which is shown as part of East Prussia, international and repub- lic boundaries shown are as of 1937. Although these sheets at 1:500,000 are not being cur- rently revised, they are of great value because of their large scale, the large extent of area covered, clarity, and high degree of reliability. (6) Europe (Air) series, 1:500,000; GSGS 4072 This set covers the Baltic States together with the area south of '56?20'N and west of 38?20'E. Fifteen sheets of Original Page XIII-11 the Baltic States and the area west of 28?20'E were pre- pared by the British War Office, 1942-44; the others in July 1944 by Palestine Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers. All 27 sheets were published as. GSGS 4072 and reprinted by the U. S. Army Map Service, 1943-45. Four classes of roads and three of railroads, gradient tints, and spot elevations in meters are shown. Isobaths, with depths in fathoms, cover the coastal waters west of Narva. Woods are indicated only for the Baltic and other areas west of 28?20'E. Sheets covering the area south of 56?20'N between 30?20'E and 38?20'E are enlargements of the 1:1,000,000 maps. On these eastern sheets, drainage and other physical features are crudely presented, and the town-classification and internal-boundary symbols given in the legends differ radically from those shown on the maps. Throughout the set, roads are classified as major or minor in the legend but not on the maps. Interna-' tional boundaries are for 1937 except on the Danzig sheet, which uses 1939 boundaries, and on a few other sheets, which omit the Poland-USSR boundary. On these latter sheets use of Polish and USSR names follows the pre-1939 territorial alinement. Air information is more detailed for sheets west of 28?20'E than for those farther east. In general, presentation is not clear and the entire series is deficient in aeronautical information. Magnetic dec- lination and British military grid are carried throughout. (7) Europe (Air) series, 1:250,000; GSGS 3982 Only a small area along the current Poland-USSR border north of 50?N is covered by these 10 sheets, pre- pared by Great Britain, War Office, 1938-43; published as GSGS 3982 and reprinted by Army Map Service, 1942-44. The series has been discontinued and is not being replaced by air maps at a similar scale. All sheets show gradient tints, spot heights in meters, woods, magnetic declination, and pre-1939 international boundaries. On the Bialystok sheet, boundaries are given on an inset. All except the Danzig sheet have military grids. The three northern sheets distinguish four types of roads and three of railroads. Other sheets give two classes of roads and of railroads. Towns are classified according to relative importance or population, but the difference between the two types of classification is slight. The legend on many of the sheets includes an impressive amount of detailed air information, but data actually shown on the maps are scant for the Baltic coastal region. (8) USAF Equidistant Chart Centered near Sverdlovsk, USSR ZD9 (ZD9N-Nomograph); 1:24,327,708, September 1946; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service This azimuthal equidistant chart covers the territory within a radius of 5,300 nautical miles from 57?N, 60?E. International boundaries are for 1946 and in most cases favor the powers currently in control of disputed areas. Detail of hydrographic features and cities shown becomes increasingly sparse toward the periphery of the chart. Great Circle courses and distances between two points remote from the center of construction may be determined with the nomograph made for the chart. ZD9-1 shows 1,000-mile concentric circles around Sverdlovsk. This overprint is omitted on ZD9. (9) Special Air Navigation Chart, S-140 England-India, 1:5,000,000 along 40? N; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service The base for this chart was compiled November 1944, aeronautical information December 1944, isogonic data 1943. Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 Page XIII-12 Approved For Release 2003/05/14: CIA-RDP79-01144A000200010013-5 JANIS 40 The Mercator projection with a 1-degree grid is used. The chart extends northward to 53?N.. Both hydro- graphic features and gradient tints are highly generalized. International boundaries given are for different dates in the late 1930's: Spot elevations in feet, railroads poorly selected and in many cases inaccurately located, and towns classified by population are included on the base. Al- though aeronautical and radio facilities are presented in considerable detail, these data are to a large extent out of date. (10) Special Air Navigation Chart series, 1:1,000,000 along 56? N; USAF Aeronautical Chart Service The two charts described are, S-122 Kiev to Berlin: base compiled June 1944, aeronautical information June 1944, isogonic data 1943; and S-123 Budapest to Sevastopol': base compiled August 1944, aeronautical information, May 1944, isogonic data :1944. Both of these, charts are on the Mercator projection with 10' grids. Detailed hydrographic features, gradient tints of form-line accuracy, spot elevations in feet, single- and double-track railroads, mines, towns classified roughly by importance, and international boundaries as of 1937 are shown. Special air information given consists of three types of air bases, marine navigation lights, and radio broadcasting stations. C. Hyrographic charts Th,hydrographic charts described in this section are limited in general to the official charts of the countries responsible for the most recent surveys or corrections. As a result, USSR charts predominate except for the Baltic area. The U.S. Hydrographic Office, however, has issued emergency reproductions of the British Admiralty charts and a few original charts. Together they cover the Mur- man Coast, and the White, Baltic, and Black Sea coasts of the USSR (including major harbors). Since these charts follow the standard pattern and are listed in the catalog of the Hydrographic Office, only those based on recent Soviet surveys are noted specifically. Current cor- rections, use of the English language, and ready availa- bility make the U.S. charts particularly useful. In some cases, it may be advisable to compare these charts with their foreign counterparts, especially for geographic posi- tion and cultural features. The British, in addition, issue some large-scale charts of Soviet ports, which are based on older, unrevised Rus- sian surveys. Consequently the charts are of doubtful value. The same is true of the older, unrevised Russian charts. Both have been omitted from this discussion. A large number of German, Finnish, Latvian, and Esto- nian charts are listed for the Baltic area, partly because annexations in the area have been too recent to permit extensive Soviet surveys and partly because the USSR has shown an unwillingness to share information with other countries. Comparatively recent, small-scale charts of the entire Baltic coast have been issued by the USSR and Germany. Medium-scale German charts at 1:500,000 and 1:400,000 and larger-scale German charts at 1:200,000 and 1: 150,000 also cover the entire coast. Finnish charts at 1:285,012 are limited to the Gulf of Finland. The Latvian and Estonian charts listed are all at large scale and cover only comparatively small sections of the south- ern Baltic coast. Except for Gavan' Pyarnu (Parnu Harbor), 1:10,000, USSR No. 4129, and Dantsigskaga Bukhta (Danzig Bay), 1:100,000, USSR No. 4064, the Soviet charts are less de- tailed than those of ' other nations. The first of - these charts shows considerably more detail than Latvia No. 9 from which it was taken. The additional material may have come directly from the Latvian Hydrographic Office after the Soviet seizure of that country. The second chart shows topography in great detail. If similar information is available for other Soviet areas, it has been carefully concealed from Americans. Actual evidence of Soviet restrictions concerning infor- mation on their territorial waters is provided by the Ger- man reprints of Yuokankskiye Ostrova (Yuokankskiye Island), 1:25,000, USSR No. 2523, and Yugorskiy Shar (Yugovskiy Strait), 1:50,000, USSR No. 1570, as well as by the large-scale German compilations for the Leningrad area. The details shown on all of these charts were taken from Soviet charts that have never been listed in Soviet hydrographic catalogs or exchanged with the United States. Another type of restriction is illustrated by Dvinskiy Zaliv (Dvina Gulf), 1:200,000, USSR No. 1660, corrected 1943. The chart omits the port of Molotovsk, although American merchant marine captains were using the port at the time the chart was issued. All of the nautical charts described in this section have some features in common. All show aids to navigation, such as lights. Heights and depths are given in meters unless otherwise noted. Sounding in Arctic waters are reduced to lowest low water, except on small-scale charts where such reductions would be lost in generalization and on charts of the Vaygach island sector, for which all sur- veys seem to be preliminary. In other waters, tides are of little or no significance and soundings are reduced to average mean low water level. All charts carry subma- rine contours. For at least a short distance inland, they include drainage, place names, towns, and on the larger- scale charts individual buildings. Absence of cultural fea- tures on charts indicates that they are non-existent, as in the more remote parts of the Arctic coast. International boundaries given are those used by the issuing country at the date of issue or correction. Unless otherwise indi- cated, all of the maps described use the Mercator pro- jection. The charts described in TABLES XIII-1 to XIII-5 cover the USSR coastal waters but do not include Novaya Zemlya or Franz Josef Land. Because the coastal waters are not continuous, they have been divided into five major areas-the Arctic Ocean (TABLE XIII-1), the Baltic Sea (TABLE XIII-2), the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov (TABLE XIII-3), the Caspian Sea (TABLE XIII-4), and the inland lakes (TABLE XIII-5). Because of the great number of large-scale charts available, the Arctic is further subdi- vided into the Murman Coast, the White Sea, and the coast east of the White Sea. Each of the inland lakes is considered separately. Under the major and minor subdivisions, the charts are grouped first by the country of issue, and then listed according to scale, the smallest-scale charts being con- sidered first. Each chart is described according to scale, title, pub- lisher, date of compilation or latest edition, date of latest correction, language used, date of magnetic variation, method of presenting terrain, area covered, and source material used in compilation.
