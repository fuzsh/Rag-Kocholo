Murman Lann, North-Sami. MurmÃ¡nska) is a city in the north-west of Russia, the administrative center of the Murmansk region. Population - 270 384 people. (2021). A city corresponding to the category of regional significance forms an urban district.\n\nMurmansk is the world's largest city located beyond the Arctic Circle. Murmansk is located on the rocky eastern coast of the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea. One of the largest ports in Russia. Thanks to the warm North Atlantic current, Murmansk is an ice-free port, which distinguishes it favorably among the ports of the North and North-West of Russia.\n\nOn May 6, 1985, Murmansk was awarded the title of Hero City for defense against German troops during the Great Patriotic War. He was awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and the Gold Star medal.\n\nFrom January 1, 2021, at the level of the municipal unit, the city district was named the Hero City of Murmansk.\n\nClimate in Murmansk\n\nIn the Far North, Murmansk experiences cold winters with temperatures routinely dropping below â20 Â°C (â4 Â°F). The brief summer offers mild temperatures between 10â15 Â°C (50â59 Â°F). Strong winds are common, especially at the higher parts of the city.\n\nTravel Destinations in Murmansk\n\n1ââArea Five Corners (Pyatina). Central square of the city. On the square is the 17-storey business center Arktika, the highest in Murmansk, and, as they say, beyond the Arctic Circle. Around the square, in particular along Lenin Street, you can find nice well-groomed buildings from the time of Stalin.\n\n2 Sea trading port. Murmansk Commercial Sea Port occupies a special place among the northern ports of Russia. Unique natural and climatic conditions and geographical position beyond the Arctic Circle, a relatively close location to the ports of Western Europe, and it is here that access to the Northern Sea Route is made. After all, the Murmansk port, unlike other ports of the North-West region of Russia, does not freeze all year round. Also, all Russian nuclear icebreakers are assigned here, and if you are lucky, you can see one of them. Here you can take a walk, inspecting the ships standing at the pier and in the roadstead, observe the daily work of the port and take many wonderful photos.\n\n3 Nuclear icebreaker \"Lenin\", Portovy pr-d, 25 (Pontoon berth of the Marine Station) You can get there on foot from the railway station via a pedestrian crossing over the railway track or by bus. â +7 911 3456777, (8152) 55-35-13, 55-35-12. Adult 400â½, child 100â½. The nuclear icebreaker \"Lenin\" is the world's first surface vessel with a nuclear power plant, built in the USSR, at a shipyard in Leningrad. Put into operation in 1959. The ship worked for 30 years and in 1989 was put on eternal parking in Murmansk. In 2009, work began to transform the ship into a museum. This is the second most visited object in the Murmansk region; in a year, the first-born of the nuclear fleet is examined by about 50 thousand people. The organization of visiting the ship is inconvenient: you can get on the icebreaker only with excursions that are held at strictly defined times from Wednesday to Sunday - 12:00, 13:30, 15:00 (2023). The queue here is like a real Lenin in the Mausoleum, and the number of people is limited (no more than 20 people in a party, as a rule, up to three parties), so dress warmly and take a seat in advance. The tour is very informative and lasts about an hour.\n\n4ââMemorial \"To the Defenders of the Soviet Arctic\" (\"Alyosha\"). A huge sculpture on a 7-meter pedestal, commonly referred to as \"Alyosha\", the second highest sculpture in Russia (only the Volgograd \"Motherland\" is higher). The cape on which it is installed rises 173 m above sea level, thanks to which the monument can be seen from almost anywhere in the port part of the city, which makes a particularly strong impression. Near the monument there is an eternal flame, an alley of memorial plates of hero cities and two anti-aircraft guns - at the location of an anti-aircraft battery that protected the sky over the port during the war years.\n\n5ââMemorial complex in memory of sailors who died in peacetime. The central place in the complex is occupied by a lighthouse built in 2002. Inside the lighthouse there is a hall of memory: there are commemorative plaques and books of memory - everything about the sailors who died in peacetime. Near the lighthouse, there is a cabin of the infamous nuclear submarine K-141 Kursk, which crashed in 2000, with a commemorative plaque telling about all submarine accidents that occurred in peacetime. Above the memorial complex is the Church of the Savior on the Waters, and below you can find an excellent observation deck with views of the port part of the city.\n\nMonuments\n\n6ââMonument \"Waiting\".\n\nCivil architecture\n\n7ââPalace of Culture and Technology.

Later, this name was transferred to the land where events took place with the participation of foreigners. \"Murman\" began to be called the coast of the Barents Sea, neighboring Norway, and then the entire Kola Peninsula. Accordingly, the name \"Murmansk\" means \"the city on Murman\".\n\nAccording to the Kola local historian, doctor of historical sciences, I.F. Ushakov, the word \"murman\" comes from the word \"norman\", which means \"northern man\" in Scandinavian languages. The sound \"n\" on Russian soil changed into \"m\" due to complex dissimilation-assimilation of nasal sounds in neighboring syllables: n-m-n > m-m-n. As for the pronunciation of the sound \"o\", it is still pronounced in this word as \"u\" in Norwegian and Swedish.\n\nHistory of Murmansk\n\nPlans for a port city beyond the Arctic Circle appeared in the 1870s. The first prospectors came to Murman to explore new places in 1912. Three years later, on April 3 (16), 1915, during the First World War, on the eastern shore of the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea, the Murmansk sea port was founded and, with it, the port village of Semyonovsky, named after the bay where the berths were built. The creation of the port was associated with the desire of Russia to get access to the Arctic Ocean through an ice-free bay in order to uninterruptedly deliver military cargo from the Entente allies in the conditions of the blockade of the Black and Baltic Seas. The idea of ââcreating the city of Romanov was voiced in the report of the Minister of Railways A.F. Trepov âOn the establishment of a city on the Murmansk coastâ, which was approved on June 29 (July 12), 1916 by Emperor Nicholas II. On July 6 (19), 1916, Nicholas II imposed a resolution to name the new city Romanov-on-Murman. The official founding date of the city is September 21 (October 4), 1916. On this day, on a low hill, where the Palace of Culture and Folk Art named after S. M. Kirov is now located, a solemn ceremony of laying the foundation stone of the temple in honor of the patron saint of navigators Nikolai Mirlikisky was held. The city became the last city founded in the Russian Empire. In the winter of 1916-1917. Entente warships anchored in the Kola Bay. On April 3 (16), 1917, after the February Revolution, it received its current name - Murmansk.\n\nRevolution and intervention\n\nIn 1917, after the October Revolution in Petrograd, in Murmansk, a provisional revolutionary committee was created, headed by the Bolsheviks. But in connection with the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, in March 1918, an armed landing was landed from the military courts of the Entente - this was the beginning of the intervention. In 1919, power in the city passed to the Whites, and the Provisional Government of the Northern Region recognized the supreme power of Admiral Kolchak. In the autumn of 1919, the Entente troops were forced to evacuate from Murmansk. On February 21, 1920, an anti-White Guard uprising took place in the city, Soviet power was established in the city on March 13 with the arrival of regular units of the Red Army.\n\nPre-war years\n\nBy the early 1920s, Murmansk had less than 2,500 inhabitants and was in decline. The industry was represented mainly by handicraft artels, the fishing industry fell into decay. The urban landscape was made up of two or three streets of one-story houses, overcrowded workers' barracks, a disorderly cluster of shacks, railway cars adapted for housing, and \"suitcases\" abandoned by the interventionists - houses made of corrugated iron with a semicircular roof. One of the districts of the city was nicknamed the \"Red Village\" because of the red caravans adapted for housing.\n\nIn the 1920s-1930s, due to changes in the administrative-territorial division, the city changed its status several times. In 1921, Murmansk became the center of the province of the same name.\n\nFrom the second half of the 1920s, the city began to develop rapidly, since the Soviet Union had a strategic need to equip a large port, transit through which would not depend on relations with neighboring countries. Streets were laid with wooden sidewalks and rows of one- and two-story log houses. In 1927, the first multi-storey brick building appeared, which has survived to this day. Since 1927, Murmansk has been the center of the district of the same name as part of the Leningrad Region. Since 1933, Murmansk has been one of the supply and ship repair bases for the Northern Fleet. In addition to military-strategic goals, sea communication was carried out through the port with the Norilsk MMC under construction, the development of the Murmansk port also pursued the task of increasing fish catches: in the city, on the site of the former military enterprise for fish processing and ship repair, a fishing port was created, which began to develop rapidly and after a few For years, it provided supplies to other regions of the USSR of two hundred thousand tons of fish annually.\n\nIn 1934, the first shuttle bus went through Murmansk - from the northern outskirts to the southern part of the city. At the same time, the Polar Arrow express train began to run to Leningrad along the railway line. Since 1938 Murmansk has been the center of the Murmansk region. In 1939, for the first time in the city, asphalt laying began on Leningradskaya Street.\n\nMurmansk in the Great Patriotic War\n\nBy the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, there were already several dozen brick and stone buildings in Murmansk, and the population of the city reached 120 thousand inhabitants. During the Great Patriotic War, Murmansk was repeatedly attacked from the air, starting on June 22, 1941. On June 24, anti-aircraft gunners of the army and the Northern Fleet opened their combat score by shooting down 2 German bombers. To protect the city, the port and the railway junction, the Murmansk Air Defense Brigade District was created. The 150,000-strong German army stationed in the Arctic had Hitler's directive to seize the city and the port of Murmansk, through which cargoes from the allied countries went to supply the country and the army under Lend-Lease. According to the calculations of the German command, Murmansk was to be taken in a few days. Twice - in July and September, German troops launched a general offensive against Murmansk, but both offensives failed. After the Soviet troops on the distant approaches to the city repulsed the offensive, the Germans proceeded to the methodical destruction of the city, the port and the railway junction by aviation forces, making up to fifteen to eighteen raids on separate days and dropping a total of 185 thousand bombs during the war years and making 792 raid. In terms of the number and density of bombings inflicted on the city, Murmansk is second only to Stalingrad among Soviet cities. As a result of the bombing, three-quarters of the buildings were destroyed, wooden houses and buildings were especially damaged. From June 1941 to the beginning of June 1942, every third administrative, industrial and residential building in the city was destroyed, 7 warships, 10 allied transports and 31 other ships were sunk in the port. Convinced that there were no hopes of capturing the city in the summer campaign of 1942 either, the Germans tried to completely destroy the city by undertaking 4 massive bombardments one after another. The heaviest bombing was on June 18, 1942, when about 12,000 incendiary and about 60 high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. German planes dropped mainly incendiary bombs on the predominantly wooden city; in order to make it difficult to fight fires, mixed bombardments were used using fragmentation and high-explosive bombs. Due to dry and windy weather, the fire spread from the center to the northeastern outskirts of Murmansk. After these raids, over 80% of all buildings in the city were destroyed. In total, during the war years, 103 German aircraft were shot down over Murmansk (8 in 1941, 59 in 1942 and 36 in 1943).\n\nOn October 7, 1944, Soviet troops launched the Petsamo-Kirkenes offensive operation in the Arctic, and the threat to Murmansk was removed.\n\nPostwar years\n\nBy the end of the Great Patriotic War, the city was almost completely burned down. Only port facilities and the central part of the city, consisting mainly of stone houses, have survived. In November 1945, by decision of the government, Murmansk was included among the fifteen cities of the country, along with Moscow and Leningrad, the restoration of which was declared a priority. 100 million rubles were allocated for the development of the city. In the first post-war years, industrial enterprises, mooring lines, social infrastructure facilities, and a television complex were built. The city was rebuilt by the early 1950s. On September 30, 1958, the working settlement of Nagornovsky was included in the city.\n\nBy 1952, the volume of living space in the city had reached the pre-war level, and ten years later the housing stock had tripled. After the house-building plant was put into operation in 1962, standard panel houses began to be built instead of brick houses.\n\nA significant expansion of the territory of Murmansk occurred in the 1970s - early 1980s. The feat of volunteer builders who rebuilt the city during the war is immortalized in the monument \"In honor of the builders who died in 1941-1945\", opened in 1974.\n\nModernity\n\nThe active construction of residential buildings in the city was interrupted in the early 1990s. During this time, the Eastern microdistrict was erected, the city expanded from three sides - north, east and south. Later, in the 2000s, large hypermarkets and supermarkets were built in empty places. In 2016, Murmansk celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nIn 2015, the urban-type settlement of Roslyakovo was included in the city from the ZATO of Severomorsk.\n\nAwards\n\nIn 1971, the city was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for the successes \"achieved by the working people of the city in fulfilling tasks for the development of industrial production.\" In 1982, for the courage and steadfastness shown by the inhabitants in the fight against the German invaders during the Great Patriotic War, the successes achieved in economic and cultural construction, the city was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree. In 1985, for outstanding services in the Great Patriotic War, the city of Murmansk was awarded the title of \"Hero City\" with the award of the highest award of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal.\n\nThe city is marked on the alleys of hero cities in many cities that received this title, on the Alley of World War II Veterans in Washington (USA).\n\nTransportation\n\nGet in\n\nBy plane\n\nMurmansk Airport (MMK IATA). Has multiple daily flights to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and limited services to other Russian cities including Arkhangelsk, Sochi and Rostov-on-the-Don. There are also several flights per week from TromsÃ¸ and Kirkenes. Seasonal flights are available from Helsinki too.\n\nThe airport is about 40 km (25 mi) south of Murmansk, near the town of Murmashi. Taxis to the city center cost RUB600-700 and make the trip in about 40 minutes. Catching a taxi waiting outside the airport is more expensive, expect to pay up to RUB800, depending on your language and negotiation skills. For cheaper (and official) taxi service, you have to order a taxi, expect to wait up to 30â40 minutes for it to arrive, though. Bus 106 goes to the train station, stopping at Detsky Mir near the Poliarnie Zori Hotel on its way, is less expensive but much more sluggish than a taxi.\n\nBy boat\n\nDuring the summer months, Murmansk Shipping Company offers occasional trips to and from Barentsburg on Svalbard. They also serve remote villages along the northern coast of the Kola peninsula, most notably the isolated naval base of Ostrovnoy, with 2-3 trips per month.\n\nA few cruise lines also visit the city during the summer season. The pier facilities are nil, basically a bare pier in a freight handling area, but with areas for buses, taxis, etc. Any scheduled ship will be greeted by port and immigration/customs officials.\n\nBy train\n\nMurmansk can be reached from most places in north-west Russia by train. Moscow is 35â40 hours away and Saint Petersburg 27â30 hours, depending on the train. The Arktika (ÐÑÐºÑÐ¸ÐºÐ°) branded train is the fastest option, with first-class wagons and a restaurant on board. All long-distance trains make stop-overs in cities such as Kandalaksha and Petrozavodsk on their way. Other night trains reach Murmansk from cities as far east as Arkhangelsk or from Minsk and Brest in the west. Trains from Saint Petersburg and Moscow are daily, most others 2-3 times a week. During summer additional routes are added, mostly to Ukraine and the Black Sea.\n\nMurmansk railway station is in the city center, one block downhill from Five Corners Square on ul.

The city stretches for more than 20 kilometers along the rocky eastern coast of the Kola Bay, 50 kilometers from the exit to the open sea. Murmansk is located 1490 kilometers north of Moscow and 1020 kilometers north of St. Petersburg. The city of Severomorsk, the base of the Northern Fleet, is located 16 km northeast of the city. Between Severomorsk and Murmansk is the satellite village of Safonovo, which belongs to the ZATO. The nearest neighbor from the south is the ancient city of Kola. Murmansk, expanding, has already reached the southern microdistricts of the outskirts of this city. From the west and east the city is surrounded by forests. The highest point of Murmansk is the Solnechnaya Gorka hill on the eastern border of the city, 305 meters high.\n\nTimezone\n\nMurmansk is located in the MSK (Moscow time) time zone. The offset of the applicable time relative to UTC is +3:00. According to the applicable time and geographic longitude, the average solar noon in Murmansk occurs at 12:48.\n\nClimate\n\nThe city is located in the Atlantic-Arctic temperate zone. The climate of Murmansk is formed by the proximity of the Barents Sea (below is the table of its water temperature), the influence of which is enhanced by the warm North Atlantic Current. This factor contributes to the strong difference between the climate of Murmansk and the climate of most cities located beyond the Arctic Circle. Unlike many northern cities, Murmansk experiences high winter air temperatures for the North. The average January-February temperature in Murmansk is about -10 ... -11 Â°C. Severe frosts are rare, and occasionally there are thaws. Due to the proximity of warm air masses carried by the Gulf Stream, the onset of cold weather in Murmansk usually occurs about one month later than in other northern regions. The wind in Murmansk has a monsoonal character - in winter, southerly winds from the mainland prevail, bringing dry frosty weather to the city, and in summer - northerly winds from the Barents Sea, bringing increased air humidity and rather cool summer weather to Murmansk. The change of winds occurs around June and September. The average July temperature is approximately +12â¦+13 Â°C, while rainy and cloudy weather lasts two thirds of the month, and the air temperature is highly variable. However, from time to time, hot continental air masses from the south or southeast reach the city, and then the temperature rises to +25 Â°C, very rarely - above +30 Â°C for a short time. Most of Murmansk's precipitation of about 500 mm per year falls from June to September, with the peak of cloudy and rainy days in August. Snow lies in the city for an average of 210 days and completely disappears by May (in the vicinity of the city, snow can lie until June). Snowfalls are not uncommon in the first half of June. The minimum temperature of -39.4 Â° C was recorded in Murmansk on January 6, 1985 and January 27, 1999, the maximum temperature of +32.9 Â° C - on July 9, 1972. The polar night at the latitude of Murmansk lasts from December 2 to January 11, the polar day - from May 22 to July 22.\n\nRelief\n\nThe city is located on the eastern shore of the Kola Bay, on 4 terraces.

A small river Rosta flows in the northern part of the city.\n\nPlanning and development\n\nThe city is located on the hills, with strong differences in height, which determines the features of planning and development. Many houses standing on slopes have a stepped foundation and a variable number of storeys. Most of the houses in the city do not exceed the height of 9 floors. The tallest building is the eighteen-story Arktika hotel and business center. The main buildings of the Pervomaisky district and the eastern part of the Oktyabrsky (informally allocated to a separate, \"Vostochny\" district) are nine-story panel buildings. The city center is dominated by Stalinist buildings, the main part of the Leninsky district consists of \"Khrushchev\", in some places you can find post-war wooden one-story and two-story semi-barracks. Nine-story panel buildings are often decorated with multi-colored mosaics, painted stones can be found on the streets of the city - this is how Murmansk residents fight color starvation: in winter in Murmansk, the main colors are white and black, and winter can last almost eight months.\n\nEcological state\n\nThe average radiation in the city is 8-13 microR/h, which corresponds to the norm.
