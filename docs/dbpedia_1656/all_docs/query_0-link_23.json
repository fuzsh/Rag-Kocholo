Please check the online class schedule listing for the most accurate scheduling information\n\nSpring 2023 Courses\n\nSpring 2024 Courses\n\nSpring 2023 Courses\n\n200-Level Courses\n\nEH 205-QLA: Intro to Creative Writing\n\nInstructor: Slaughter\n\nThis course is an introduction to the practice of creative writing, with a particular focus on poetry and fiction writing. By the completion of the course students will:\n\nEmploy the crucial vocabulary and terms necessary to discuss, read and write poetry and fiction;\n\nPractice and apply a range of techniques to help students write original, image-driven, polished poetry and fiction;\n\nDiscover the incredible amount, quality, and range of writing being produced by living writers via contemporary online literary journals;\n\nRevise their creative writing and recognize that successful creative writing is always the result of a lot of hard work.\n\nTo this end, expect to devote considerable attention to strategies for observation and focus, modeling, accurate language choice, achieving a precise image, and the elements of structure.\n\nEH 213-1A: Ideas in Literature: Latino/a/e/x Lit\n\nInstructor: Santiago\n\nHispanic? Latino? Latine? Latin@? Latinx? While the blanket terms used to define this diverse population are often contested, what is inarguable is the fact that Latinos constitute the largest ethnic minority group in the United States—a fact that has profound political, social, and cultural implications. Importantly, Latine experiences are not monolithic; there are as many experiences and perspectives about Latinidad as there are ethnicities and nationalities. In this course we will study selected works from the rich body of literature produced by Latinx authors residing in the U.S.A. and writing in English. Particularly, we will examine questions of home, identity, ethnicity, and nationality as manifested in Latine literature. These texts often ask:\n\nWhat does it mean to be Latin American?\n\nHow do race, ethnicity, and nationality overlap? How do these identities interact with those related to gender, class, religion, and ability?\n\nHow do does one remain authentic when straddling multiple identities?\n\nWhat does it mean to be an American who lives on literal or metaphorical borderlands?\n\nAs we explore these questions we will encounter multiple genres of classic and contemporary texts—from Sandra Cisneros to Bad Bunny—while examining their historical and social contexts. Assignments and expectations will be typical of 200-level lit courses.\n\nEH 213-1CB: Ideas in Literature: Queer Literature\n\nInstructor: Butcher\n\nThough often portrayed as a single, unified group, the LGBTQ+ community is filled with diverse—and sometimes competing—voices. We will examine fiction, creative nonfiction, graphic literature, film, documentary, poetry, and social media as we explore queer identities and queer experiences in writings by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, nonbinary, and asexual authors. Along the way we will learn some queer history and consider the impact of social and institutional forces on queer lives—as well as the ways that queer lives can impact society and institutions.\n\nWhether you are gay, straight, ally, or simply curious, this course is designed as an introduction to LGBTQ+ literature and issues. Students need bring only a willingness to read carefully, discuss openly, and think carefully about the topics and texts at hand. As with other 200-level courses, assignments may include tests, essays, quizzes, and journals.\n\nEH 213-1EB/1FA: Ideas in Lit: Money and Happiness\n\nInstructor: Temple\n\nIn this class, we will read American literary explorations of connections between money and, for lack of a better term, “happiness.” By reading from writers such as Benjamin Franklin, Elizabeth Stoddard, Horatio Alger, Ralph Ellison, Richard Yates, and Cormac McCarthy, we will discuss issues such as the moral/ethical ramifications of the pursuit of money; the effects of race and gender on access to money and the pursuit of happiness; and the kinds of communities, institutions, pastimes, and even perversions that result from a society structured around the goal of private accumulation. Assignments will include two essays, an out-of-class final exam, and periodic study questions.\n\nEH 213-2A/2B: Ideas in Literature – Sweet Home Alabama?\n\nInstructor: Major\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” was written in response to two songs by Neil Young—“Southern Man” and “Alabama”—that deal with themes of racism and slavery in the American South. The song’s lyrics, which call Neil Young out by name in a rebuke of his Yankee criticisms in some places and are problematically vague in other places, are controversial—heralded by some as admirable, defiant pride and criticized by others as a strutting defense of old Confederate values. In many ways, the tensions and complexities embodied within this song reflect conversations that are still very much alive today about pride, identity, and the ways in which Alabama’s troubling past continues to manifest itself in the present.\n\nThis class will begin by placing a question mark after the Southern rock anthem’s title: “Sweet Home Alabama?” What is this place and its people about? What are the different narratives that contribute to Alabama’s mythology? What does it mean to call Alabama home? What, if anything, is sweet about that experience? We’ll attempt to answer these questions by examining the contemporary literature of the place. Our approach will be kaleidoscopic: we’ll read a wide range of texts from a diverse group of authors who are from (or who spent significant time in) various places in Alabama and whose writing was deeply influenced by and directly responds to that experience. We’ll read this material critically and in the context of the cultural ethos from which it comes, and we’ll discuss and write about texts both individually and in relation to each other. As we do this, we’ll consider significant themes of contemporary Alabama writing and explore how this complicates, deepens, or explodes our understandings of place and identity—and why that matters in both historical and current political and social contexts.\n\nThis course is appropriate for anyone interested in Alabama, contemporary Southern literature, Alabama history, the Civil Rights Movement, social justice, or theories of place and identity.\n\nEH 213-2C/2D: Literature at the Movies\n\nInstructor: Ellis\n\nThis course will explore intersections between literature and film by studying stories that take their characters to the movies, poems about cinema, and the ways films interpret literature by adapting stories for the screen. We will examine films about the study of literature and author biopics, as well as criticism and reviews of film, film theory, and screenplays as literary texts. Looking through both page and screen as lenses, we will consider identification, spectatorship, psychoanalysis, narrative, and the cinema as cultural institution. Works may include selections from Agee, Anzaldua, Baldwin, Ellison, Farrell, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, King, Morrison, Puig, and Schwartz.\n\nEH 223-2E: Witches\n\nInstructor: Dwivedi\n\nThe issue of representation is problematic, particularly for witches; this semester, we will explore the identity of witches as violators/violated. We will study two novels (Maguire’s Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, and Conde’s I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem), a few fairy tales, and some excerpts to understand how authors have resisted the established discourse on witches and appropriated the witch narrative in their own writing.\n\nThere will be short supplemental materials, which will be posted on Canvas, and which will help you understand the context and how the narrative has changed. For instance, we will read chapter 12 from Wizard of Oz, which is about the Wicked Witch of the West, and then start reading Wicked. In terms of major assignments, there will be a literary analysis essay, a midterm exam, and a final project.\n\n300-Level Courses\n\nEH 301-1E: Reading, Writing, and Research\n\nInstructor: Grimes\n\nEnglish 301 is a methods course focusing on the practice of reading literary texts, locating and studying the critical and historical contexts of those texts, and writing well-crafted and well-informed critical essays that explore the meaning, value, and significance of those texts. Having taken EH 301, students will be able to:\n\nRead closely such that they can recognize and describe the significant features of a given literary text. This skill presumes that the student has command over the basic terminology used in literary and rhetorical criticism and has a fundamental understanding of the major literary genres and periods of literary history.\n\nConduct effective library research in secondary sources using databases such as the Modern Language Association International Bibliography (MLAIB) and the Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature (ABELL). They should also be able to use JSTOR and other full-text repositories of critical materials, and they should be able to locate and use materials from the Sterne Library collection. Students who have developed these abilities will also recognize both the legitimate uses and the limitations of such tertiary sources as \"SparkNotes\" or other students' guides.\n\nWrite critical essays which situate an original thesis in an appropriate and well-informed scholarly context. Students should be able to incorporate both primary and secondary source material into their own writing and then document the essay accurately but unobtrusively using the MLA documentation system.\n\nRecognize the aims and principles of some of the central theoretical approaches to literary analysis that have been prominent in recent critical writing. While EH 301 is not a course in literary theory, students should gain sufficient exposure to prominent theoretical approaches so as to be able to recognize when a critic is writing within, for example, a psychoanalytic or feminist or poststructuralist (or other) context.\n\nEH 305-2D: Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop\n\nInstructor: Vines\n\nEH 305 is a poetry writing workshop that emphasizes reading, writing, and critiquing poetry. Throughout the semester, we will explore the fundamental elements of poetry and closely examine poetry by writers with various styles and sensibilities. Our discussions will employ the types of vocabulary and considerations specific to poetry and poetry criticism. These discussions should help you to articulate your impressions and criticisms—a facility you'll need for workshopping the poems of your peers and for writing critical responses and original poetry.\n\nRequired Texts\n\nChad Davidson and Gregory Fraser, Writing Poetry: Creative and Critical Approaches\n\nTwo contemporary poetry collections\n\nEH 315-1B: Introduction to Professional Writing\n\nInstructor: Wells\n\nIn this course, students will explore and practice the work of professional writers. We will study how professional writers use research to better understand their rhetorical situation, which often includes the organization(s) for whom they are writing. From there, we will study how professional writers make choices about their writing based on what they have learned about their audience, purpose, and context. Students will practice processes of invention, audience analysis, document design, drafting, giving feedback, revising, and editing.\n\nEH 327-2B: Finding the Lost Generation\n\nInstructor: Young\n\nExtended Title: Modernist Expatriates in Early-Twentieth-Century Paris\n\n“You are all a lost generation.”\n\nThis is the epigraph from Ernest Hemingway’s 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. He credits the comment to his literary mentor, the iconoclastic American writer Gertrude Stein. The idea of a lost generation may not have been new in 1926, however. Indeed, in his posthumous memoir A Moveable Feast, Hemingway recounts that Stein overheard a French garage owner use the phrase with exasperation as he berated a mechanic. But when Stein says it, she does so with an eye toward the young, mostly American writers and artists who populate her Paris salon. At once pithy and enigmatic, Stein’s observation provides a way for these artists to self-identify and to explain what they are seeking—in their work and in Paris. They are looking for themselves. And in that search, they find each other.\n\nIn this course, we will explore texts by writers who made up the artistically fertile early-twentieth-century expatriate community in Paris. We will not limit ourselves to works by American writers but will also consider those of writers from other English-speaking countries as well as performing artists. Our work will deepen our understanding of what literary scholar Donald Pizer calls the “Paris moment” specifically and Modernism generally and will allow us to draw connections with our own historical and cultural moment.\n\nWe will read fiction, non-fiction, and poetry produced by writers like T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and Gertrude Stein, though we will certainly add selections by others.\n\nMajor assignments will include two exams and a multimodal project.\n\nEH 345-1S ST: Rhetoric of Human Rights\n\nInstructor: Minnix\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a situation where words matter more than in the advocacy, activism, law, and policy-work that seeks to secure and protect the rights of our human community. In fact, we might say that a significant part of the work that takes place in social movements, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOS), legislative bodies, and other key organizations is rhetorical work, work designed to compel the recognition of human dignity and rights through the power of persuasive speech.\n\nIn this course, we will explore this fascinating work in two ways. First, we will explore the rhetorical history of some of the most enduring and important rhetorical and philosophical statements of human rights. Second, we will take a case-study approach that asks us to explore what we know about practicing rhetorical history and the history of human rights. We will examine specific cases of human rights activism and advocacy, and students will have the opportunity to pursue a research project that allows them to develop their own rhetorical case-study of a particular human rights movement, event, law, or conflict that interests them. In addition, students will have the opportunity to meet and discuss the practice of human rights rhetoric with practitioners, activists, and advocates.\n\n400/500-Level Courses\n\nEH 402/502-7P: Writing in Popular Periodicals\n\nInstructor: Ryan\n\nRequired Texts and Materials\n\nAnthology of recent periodical writing.\n\nAssigned journal articles and book chapters available through Sterne Library Databases and provided by the instructor.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course will introduce you to the conversations that flourish in a plethora of periodical forms: print and digital, consumer and trade, historical and contemporary. Throughout this course, we’ll be examining:\n\nThe cultural phenomenon of the “popular periodical” in global cultures, including the early history of newspapers and magazines and the role/s they played, and continue to play, in civil society\n\nApproaches to understanding periodical audiences and their consumption habits Strategies for pitching and producing effective prose for targeted periodicals\n\nCourse Assignments and Percentages\n\nAssignments to be completed in this course include the following:\n\nReading Journal (15%): a series of mostly in-class and occasional out-of-class short writing assignments based on class readings and discussions. Additional requirements may be given to students in EH 502 for several of these assignments, including a required discussion leader exercise worth 15 points. Since reading journal prompts will be assigned throughout the semester, the grade for this portion of the course will be incomplete until the end of the semester. The instructor will, however, send updates about the number of points earned/points available at intervals throughout the semester.\n\nSlice of History Paper (20%): paper examining an aspect of popular periodicals in historical context (e.g., representation of a particular historical issue in the pages of a single title). Research required. EH 402: 5-7 pages EH 502: 8-10 pages Final Project (30%) and Final Project Oral Pitch (10%): completion of a project drawing on each student’s interests in the periodical industry.

Research required\n\nEH 427/527-1C: Money and Happiness\n\nInstructor: Temple\n\nIn Volume I of Capital, Marx describes money as “the alienated essence of man’s labor and life.” In Marx’s view, the work we do as subjects of capitalism, our aspirations in life, and even the judgments we make about the moral character of others, are fundamentally connected to money, an abstract and essentially arbitrary symbol that “dominates us” as we “worship it.”\n\nMarx’s critique of capitalism and its primary goal, the accumulation of ever-increasing profit, was not universally shared, however. In fact, writers from a seemingly limitless array of disciplines and perspectives have examined the social ramifications of capitalism since at least the early decades of the nineteenth century. In this class, we will read American literary explorations of connections between money and, for lack of a better term, “happiness.”\n\nBy reading from writers such as Benjamin Franklin, Elizabeth Stoddard, Horatio Alger, Ralph Ellison, Richard Yates, and Cormac McCarthy, we will discuss issues such as the moral/ethical ramifications of the pursuit of money; connections between competitive individualism, the American dream, and inequality in America; the effects of race and gender on access to money and the pursuit of happiness; and the kinds of communities, institutions, pastimes, and even perversions that result from a society structured around the goal of private accumulation.\n\nEH 427/527-1C: Poems\n\nInstructor: Grimes\n\nThis is a course in the “appreciation” of British and American poetry. Our aim will be to develop a comprehensive sense of the emergence and evolution of poetic techniques and traditions from the Early Modern period to the present. We will do this by close-reading a small sample of poems that have been influential in shaping the historical trajectory of poetry in English. By the end of this class students should have a detailed and comprehensive grasp on the history of English poetry, an intimate familiarity with a number of highly influential poems, and (if all goes well) a few new favorite poems.\n\nEH 429/529-QL: Memoir in Film and Spoken Word\n\nInstructor: Madden\n\n\"What would you write if you weren't afraid?\" asks Mary Karr in her book, On Memoir. This is a memoir class. You will be mining your life's stories to create a memoir. We will be reading memoirs and watching films based on those memoirs, so you will also get to see the possibilities in adapting your memoir to film. Your memoir may be about a single period in your life, or it may be a series of connected stories.\n\nThrough a series weekly writing sparks and readings, you will begin to discover the story you want to tell. Every memoir has a container. The container in Cheryl Strayed's memoir, Wild, is the Pacific Crest Trail, but it is actually the story of her late mother gone too soon. The container in Sarah Broom's The Yellow House is Broom's childhood home in New Orleans East, but it's really a story about family, loss, and the devastation wrought by Katrina. Art is the container in Allie Brosh's hilarious memoir, Hyperbole and a Half, about her crippling anxiety.\n\nFrom graphic to traditional memoirs, we'll be reading memoirists like Alison Bechdel, Vivian Gornick, Amy Tan, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Mary Karr, Jesmyn Ward, Amos Oz, Tobias Wolff, Sally Mann, Jeannette Winterson, Tara Westover, and many others in our workshop. This class is an opportunity for you to consider how to shape part of your life experience into a narrative, and by the end of the workshop, you will have approximately 30-60 pages of a memoir. You will also create a Submittable Account to begin the process of submitting short and long essays to literary journals seeking the voices of new writers.\n\nEH 442/552-2F: Literary Theory/Criticism: 20th Century to the Present\n\nInstructor: Bach\n\nIn this class, we will read some of the greatest hits of literary theory. We will start with Psychoanalytic Theory and Marxist Theory, and move on to Feminism, Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Animal Studies, Postcolonial Theory, Ecocriticism, and Science Studies. That trajectory will help students to understand both the history of literary theory and the ground on which current theorists are building their texts. Students will learn how to take apart difficult theoretical texts and use their insights to read in new ways.\n\nCourse Requirements:\n\nA reading journal collected weekly\n\nThree exams\n\nEH 455/555-2D: Digital Publishing\n\nInstructor: Bacha\n\nBeginning with the shift from print to digital publication practices, students in this course analyze how the act of text production is changing and learn rhetorical strategies necessary to publish information in newer communication contexts. Specifically, students explore how newer trends and technologies for digital communication are influencing how people read, write, interact with, and share publicly available information.\n\nStudents in this course are also introduced to a variety of industry standard communication technologies designed to help them prepare and publish interactive information (including web-based and video productions) designed to function in a number of different communication contexts. No prior experience with any type of technology is required for this course.\n\nEH 476/576-2E: Shakespeare Across the Centuries\n\nInstructor: Bach\n\nIn this class, we will read four Shakespeare plays intensively, and we will look at how those plays have been responded to and transformed since they were written more than four hundred years ago. We will read early editors of Shakespeare and talk about how and why his plays have been heavily edited. We’ll also read responses to Shakespeare from 19th and 20th century authors. We’ll talk about how his plays have been rewritten to conform to later ideas about gender, sexuality, and race. Students will learn to read the plays carefully in relation to their original cultural context, and they will learn what has happened to Shakespeare and his plays over the last four hundred years.\n\nPlays\n\nAs You Like It\n\nTwelfth Night\n\nOthello\n\nThe Tempest\n\nCourse Requirements:\n\nSix 750-word Responses\n\nOne 8-page Paper\n\nA Final Exam\n\nEH 478/578-2F: Milton\n\nInstructor: Chapman\n\nSometime in the late 1650s, the blind poet John Milton began writing to “justify the ways of God to man.” Specifically, he was trying to understand why there is evil in the world and how a loving God can allow suffering and death. The resulting poem, Paradise Lost, retells the fall of Adam and Eve, although Milton does not confine his imagination just to the Garden of Eden. The poem also includes the landscapes of Heaven and Hell, and the vast, wind-battered realms of Chaos.\n\nMany readers over the centuries have considered Paradise Lost the single greatest poem in the English language, and our main goal this semester will be to read it in its entirety. Along the way, we will sample other works by Milton and his contemporaries in order to develop a broader sense of seventeenth-century ideas about gender, theology, justice, ecology, and politics.\n\nAssignments for undergraduates will include a number of low-stakes reading responses, two short papers (which may include creative or multimedia work), and a final exam. Graduate students will write a longer final essay in place of the exam.\n\nEH 496-QLA: English Capstone\n\nInstructor: Wells\n\nIn the Capstone Seminar, students will reflect on their experiences as English majors, explore options for careers and continued education, and practice finding and analyzing job ads. Additionally, students will learn to describe their skills and experiences in documents like résumés and personal statements and study how to manage their professional identities and networks in online spaces like LinkedIn. Students will receive peer and instructor feedback on their job materials and will have many opportunities to revise.\n\n600-Level Courses\n\nEH 646 7P: Practicum in Teaching Writing\n\nInstructor: Mina\n\nThis course is designed to prepare graduate students to teach writing at the college level. The course focuses on the theories, research, and pedagogies of teaching and learning college composition through readings, discussions, reflection, and mentored practices. Students will observe instructors, practice commenting on papers, design writing assignments and units, and plan and teach a class session while being mentored by an experienced instructor. Students will also produce their own teaching materials using the conceptual learning and classroom experiences accumulated during the course of the semester all while reflecting on their learning and teaching knowledge and practices.\n\nEH 693-7M: Death in Medieval Literature\n\nInstructor: Clements\n\nThis graduate seminar is centered on the topic of death in the early Middle Ages with a particular focus on dying and the dead in medieval literary texts. Students will be introduced to death’s historical and material contexts to explore how medieval cultures managed the event of dying and the various physical and spiritual stakes related to the handling of the body, burial, and mourning. We will use this contextual work to examine how early medieval writers addressed or represented death in a range of textual genres, from homilies and sermons to carved inscriptions and epic poetry.\n\nStudents will read both primary and secondary sources each week, learning the history of scholarship on this topic over the last two centuries. Each student will present prepared material and lead discussion and will complete a culminating research project that explores this theme more deeply in a given text.\n\nAssignments will include midterm and final essays, an out-of-class final exam, and a critical presentation. Graduate students will be expected to produce more sophisticated, critically and theoretically nuanced, and consequently longer essays than their undergraduate classmates.\n\nSpring 2024 Courses\n\n200-Level Courses\n\nEH 213-2B and 2C: SciFi Lit and Film\n\nEH 213-2B and 2C: SciFi Lit and Film\n\nInstructor: Ronald Guthrie\n\nOver the course of the semester, we will discuss what it means to be human in the 21st century by analyzing science fiction short stories and films from both past and contemporary authors and directors. We will also read several nonfiction pieces, including news stories, to give context to the fictional readings and movies. During the first half of the semester, we will look at works focused on robotics and artificial intelligence with an eye toward the possible ramifications of giving machines “human” rights or imposing laws to control them, especially if they become self-aware. During the second half of the semester, we will focus on cyborgs by examining how society has already adapted and will have to adapt even more to people who are both human and machine in light of the predictions made by speculative fiction and film.\n\nThis course will require considerable reading, writing, and classroom discussion. Students should be aware that some of the texts and films include uncomfortable and controversial subject matter such as prejudice and discrimination, religion, sex, drug use, and violence.\n\nEH 213 QLE and QLF: Storytelling\n\nEH 213 QLE and QLF: Storytelling\n\nInstructor: Aparna Dwivedi\n\nThis class will be about: 1) exploring how stories determine who we are by studying story shapes: where they come from and how they shape our understanding of ourselves and others 2) evaluating strategies of impactful storytelling by considering the elements of point of view, voice, humor/tone, and structure in a range of genres; and 3) identifying resources for finding stories as well as telling personal stories. The course will be an invigorating unpacking of issues pertaining to stories: who tells them, whose stories are told, how stories are told in genres ranging from fiction/creative nonfiction to stand-up comedy, mockumentaries, podcasts etc., how to identify which stories to tell etc. Reading materials will include: The Book of Unknown Americans by Cristina Henriquez (purchase); selections from Alice LaPlante’s The Making of a Story (on Canvas); Michelle Zauner’s Crying in H Mart (purchase); Cathy Park Hong’s, Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning (downloadable ebook on Canvas); personal essays by Adichie, Sedaris and others; and episodes from podcasts like The Moth, This American Life, and Alabama Folklife. In terms of major assignments, there will be one multimodal project, an essay, and a final research/creative project; there will be weekly journal writing and group posts on the discussion board.\n\n300-Level Courses\n\nEH 301 7M: Reading, Writing, and Research for English Majors\n\nEH 301 7M: Reading, Writing, and Research for English Majors\n\nInstructor: Leonard Kyle Grimes\n\nIntended chiefly for prospective English majors, EH 301 will introduce students to advanced methods in reading and interpretation, to the techniques of library research on literary and historical topics, and to the practices and conventions of writing about literature. Having completed EH 301, students will be able to... ...conduct effective library research in secondary sources using the Modern Language Association International Bibliography (MLAIB) and other such resources. They should also be able to use JSTOR and other full-text repositories of critical materials, and they should be able to locate and use materials from the Sterne Library collection. Students who have developed these abilities will also recognize both the legitimate uses and the limitations of such tertiary sources as \"SparkNotes\" or other students' guides. ...write a critical essay which situates an original thesis in an appropriate and well-informed scholarly context.

We will study how professional writers use research to better understand their rhetorical situation, which often includes the organization(s) for whom they are writing. From there, we will study how professional writers make choices about their writing based on what they have learned about their audience, purpose, and context. Students will practice processes of invention, audience analysis, document design, drafting, giving feedback, revising, and editing.\n\nEH 320 2D Multimodal Writing\n\nEH 320 2D Multimodal Writing\n\nInstructor: Meagan Malone\n\nThis course provides students with foundational skills in understanding, analyzing, and critiquing multimodal texts. Specifically, students will analyze how multimodal components add meaning to written text, learn how to critique the effectiveness of multimodal texts, and apply what they learn in the production of their own multimodal texts. Students will also be introduced to ethical issues inherent in multimodal composition, such as questions of fair use, licensing, and copyright.\n\nThis course is a requirement for the new Writing and Media BA and it fulfills a Professional Writing Elective for the English BA.\n\n400/500-Level Courses\n\nEH 427/527 2D (Post-1800); Sex and Gender in American Literature\n\nEH 427/527 2D (Post-1800); Sex and Gender in American Literature\n\nInstructor: Gale Temple\n\nWhen the Puritans first set up a colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620, their concepts of gender and sexuality were very different from those that circulate in the western world today. One of the most noteworthy of these differences is that early Americans did not recognize “sexuality” as a discreet category of identity (gay, straight, etc.); in other words, although a person might engage in a specific sex act, or feel intimacy towards men or women or both, those behaviors or predilections did not then classify that person as a “type,” or to use Michel Foucault’s famous formulation, a “species” whose entire being could be understood based on sexuality alone. Another way our culture contrasts with that of the Puritans is that what we think of as “sex” – or sex “acts” – were not necessarily performed or experienced separately from other aspects of cultural life. Sex may have been far more restricted among the American Puritans, but it was less compartmentalized as a strictly private concern, and specifically “sexual” desire was not necessarily separable from other forms of desire or passion (for God’s love, for example). Early Americans also had specific beliefs about gender norms that starkly contrast with those that exist today, beliefs that began to change in drastic ways beginning in the mid-eighteenth century. Despite these differences, however, early American literary, medical, legal, and theological writings can tell us a great deal about the sexual culture we inhabit today. In this class we will study early American writing in order to trace the evolution of these changes, while also reflecting on how our ideological assumptions about sex and gender today still retain many of the beliefs, fears, hopes, and anxieties of earlier phases of history. Writers we will study include Hannah Webster Foster, Theodore Winthrop, Herman Melville, Harriet Jacobs, T. S. Arthur, and Henry James.\n\nRequirements:\n\nCourse requirements include a mid-semester essay, a final term paper, and an archival project in which you will find and report on a material artifact (literary text, advertisement, medical case history or treatment, invention or object, etc.) that has some bearing on the themes of the class. There will also be periodic reading quizzes, in-class writings, and study questions that will count towards your final grade.\n\nEH 431/531 2F Film Visions\n\nEH 431/531 2F Film Visions\n\nInstructor: Daniel Seigel\n\nIn this course we will dive into the work of three major filmmakers: Robert Altman, whose genre mash-ups break every Hollywood rule; Agnès Varda, whose films shine a light on people and communities with all their customs and quirks; and Hirokazu Kore-eda, who explores the deep emotional currents of modern life. We’ll discuss the different elements that enter into a director’s works—personal history, cultural background, political beliefs, thematic obsessions, visual style, philosophy—and the alchemy that combines them into what we might call the director’s “vision.”\n\nYou are welcome and encouraged to take the course even if you’ve never studied film before! Every week students will view films outside of class and write informal responses. For your formal work, you will learn how to use digital tools to create your own video commentaries.\n\n442/552 2EA Literary Theory\n\n476/576 2CA Shakespeare Across the Centuries\n\n476/576 2CA Shakespeare Across the Centuries\n\nInstructor: Rebecca Bach\n\nIn this class, we will read four Shakespeare plays intensively, and we will look at how those plays have been responded to and transformed since they were written more than four hundred years ago. We will read early editors of Shakespeare and talk about how and why his plays have been heavily edited. We’ll also read responses to Shakespeare from 19th and 20th century authors. We’ll talk about how his plays have been rewritten to conform to later ideas about gender, sexuality, and race. Students will learn to read the plays carefully in relation to their original cultural context, and they will learn what has happened to Shakespeare and his plays over the last four hundred years.\n\nUndergraduates will write six responses, one eight-page paper, and take a final exam. Graduate students will write six responses, and a fifteen-page research paper.\n\nEH 483/583 1M British Romanticism\n\nEH 483/583 1M British Romanticism\n\nInstructor: Leonard Kyle Grimes\n\nThe literature of the Romantic period presents one of the major turning points in Western social, political, and literary culture. This was the age of revolutions (the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, etc.) in which a recognizably modern world was born. The chief aim of this course is to help students become conversant with the canonical works and the canonical writers of the Romantic period: Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley & Keats. These writers—the poets are frequently called the \"Big Six\"— dominated the discussion of Romanticism through much of the 20th century; a knowledge of their work is still essential to students of the period. At the same time, however, recent criticism has raised a number of compelling reasons to question both the legitimacy and the effects of the dominance of the writers traditionally labeled as the \"major\" or canonical romantics. There are a number of approaches to this emerging critique of canonical Romanticism, and I have included works such as Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets and Beachy Head, Byron's Don Juan, Thomas Love Peacock’s Nightmare Abbey, and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (themselves canonical texts, though Romantic misfits) in order to introduce this critique. As a result, students should emerge from the class with a comprehensive grasp on the traditional definitions of Romanticism as well as a heightened critical sense of the significance—and the limitations—of these traditional definitions.\n\nA note about the Spring 2024 schedule: EH 483/583 is slotted into the 1M time period, MWF from 3:35-4:25. I will plan to offer an online option for most of the Friday sessions, and, depending on the needs and inclinations of the class, perhaps some of the Wednesday sessions as well.\n\nEH 496 QLA English Capstone Seminar\n\nEH 496 QLA English Capstone Seminar\n\nInstructor: Jaclyn Wells\n\nIn the Capstone Seminar, students will reflect on their experiences as English majors, explore options for careers and continued education, and practice finding and analyzing job ads. Additionally, students will learn to describe their skills and experiences in documents like résumés and personal statements and study how to manage their professional identities and networks in online spaces like LinkedIn. Students will receive peer and instructor feedback on their job materials and will have many opportunities to revise.\n\n600-Level Courses\n\nEH 646 Practicum in Teaching Writing\n\nEH 646 Practicum in Teaching Writing\n\nInstructor: Lilian Mina\n\nThis course is designed to prepare graduate students to teach writing at the college level. The course focuses on the theories, research, and pedagogies of teaching and learning college composition through readings, discussions, reflection, and mentored practices. Students will observe instructors, practice commenting on papers, design writing assignments and units, and plan and teach a class session while being mentored by an experienced instructor. Students will also produce their own teaching materials using the conceptual learning and classroom experiences accumulated during the course of the semester all while reflecting on their learning and teaching knowledge and practices.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nAt the conclusion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nUnderstand the connection between composition theories and pedagogies\n\nDevelop a variety of teaching writing materials\n\nRespond with revision-oriented feedback to student writing\n\nUse rubrics to grade student writing\n\nPractice reflection on own learning and practices\n\nDesign classroom activities to facilitate the teaching of writing\n\nArticulate a personal teaching philosophy informed by the course readings, discussions, and practices\n\nEH 693 9I Three London Writers\n\nEH 693 9I Three London Writers\n\nInstructor: Daniel Seigel\n\nFor centuries, London has been a city of contradictions, a center of both tradition and change. Royal palaces have stood cheek by jowl with railyards and shipping docks; monumental cathedrals have towered over crowded slums; parks and green spaces have competed for real estate with council flats; fashionable shoppers and theatre-goers have rubbed elbows with street vendors and crossing-sweeps. Moreover, London has always been profoundly multicultural, as the political center of a far-flung Empire and the home of many generations of immigrant communities.\n\nThis course will survey some of the most significant literary treatments of London over the last two centuries, in the novels of Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, and Zadie Smith. Students will examine the way that London splashes the pages of these novels with its distinctive characters, scenes, and dialects; at the same time, we’ll consider the ways in which these novelists have attempted to give shape and meaning to the chaotic, evolving life of the city."
