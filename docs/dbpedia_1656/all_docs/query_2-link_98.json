For a deeper dive into Seattle Pro Musica's 50-plus-year legacy of singing, visit our History page.\n\n2023-2024 Season\n\nMay 2024 • A Sea Symphony by Ralph Vaughan Williams\n\n“All souls…all nations…all identities…”\n\nWalt Whitman’s lyrics are a stirring embrace of all of humanity. Combined with the music of Ralph Vaughan Williams, A Sea Symphony uses the vastness and power of the sea as a backdrop for our search for meaning. Written for chorus, soloists, and orchestra, A Sea Symphony will fill you with a sense of awe and wonder in the face of a boundless universe. Seattle Pro Musica presented this work in collaboration with Auburn Symphony Orchestra and their conductor, Wesley Schulz.\n\nSPM opened the concert with Canticum Calamitatis Maritimae by Finnish composer Jaakko Mäntyjärvi. This haunting work draws on folk song, news reporting, and the Requiem Mass to recount the ill-fated 1994 journey of the MS Estonia. A Sea Symphony featured soloists Susan Payne O’Brien, soprano, and John Seesholtz, baritone.\n\nMarch 2024 • Journey of Song with Composer Eric Tuan\n\nWe were thrilled to have special guest Eric Tuan join us for our New American Composers Series. Eric is both an exciting composer and conductor of the renowned Piedmont East Bay Children’s Choir. His music is deeply emotional, as heard in the world premiere of Let them not say, his plea for action against climate change. Student singers from local schools joined us for Eric’s Journey of Song, a celebration of how singing unites people across nations and cultures. Our audiences got to hear Eric’s music, meet Eric himself, and were moved by music that honors the beauty of our fragile world.\n\nThis concert featured works by Eric Tuan, Morten Lauridsen, Fanny Hensel, Johannes Brahms, and more.\n\nDecember 2023 • A Celtic Winter: Music from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales\n\nOur audiences were invited to ring in the winter holidays with the joyous sounds of Celtic choral music! Our spirits rose as we filled our gorgeous concert halls with lush harmonies from Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. Rousing carols, soothing lullabies, soaring spaces, and a candlelight procession. What better way to celebrate the season? We performed at Seattle First Baptist Church and Bastyr University Chapel. As a special treat, audience members at the Seattle First Baptist performance werewelcomed with a short program from the Northwest Boychoir, Apprentices.\n\nThis concert featured works by Judith Weir, James MacMillan, Tarik O’Regan, Paul Mealor, and more, with texts in Welsh, Gaelic, and English.\n\n2022-2023 50th anniversary season\n\nMay 2023 • Smyth/Mozart\n\nBritish composer Ethel Smyth’s Mass in D for choir, orchestra, and soloists is a monumental achievement. Written in the mid-19th century, it was dismissed by critics who deemed women composers unequal to their male counterparts. Seattle Pro Musica hails this stunning and seldom-heard piece as more than equal. We paired this groundbreaking work with Mozart’s beloved “Great” Mass in C minor for one performance only in the magnificent acoustic of St. James Cathedral, and featured soloists Tess Altiveros, soprano; Miriam Gnagy, soprano; Dawn Padula, mezzo; Zachary Finkelstein, tenor; Charles Robert Stephens, bass.\n\nMarch 2023 • The Glimmer\n\nThe Glimmer was the last of our New American Composers concerts for the 22-23 season, and featured composer Jerod Impichchaachaaha’ Tate.

Garrett. Marques focuses on traditional music of the African diaspora, as well as contemporary choral music by Black composers.\n\nFor his Seattle Pro Musica commissioned work, Marques chose a text by the Black American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, with its evocative text asking to ”teach this tongue the singer’s soulful art.”\n\n2021-2022 season\n\nMay 2022 • The Way Home\n\nThe Way Home honored America’s multicultural heritage with music that seeks to foster respect for all persons and groups, especially immigrants and refugees.

Our celebrity guest was storyteller and KING-FM announcer Lisa Bergman.\n\n2016–2017 SEASON\n\nMay 2017 • Dona Nobis Pacem\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams’ masterful cantata for soloists, choir, and orchestra, is one of the most important anti-war compositions of the 20th century. Written between World War I and II, Dona nobis pacem (Grant us peace) is one of Vaughan Williams’ most significant works. We performed this impassioned plea for peace that blends Biblical text with the emotionally-charged anti-war poetry of Walt Whitman to create a searing indictment of the tragedy of war.\n\nFebruary 2017 • Chichester Psalms\n\nBernstein’s beloved Chichester Psalms was paired with James MacMillan’s deeply moving Cantos sagrados in this concert of sacred music for choir and organ. Both works explore the theme of liberation –the desire of humankind to seek social justice and peace.
