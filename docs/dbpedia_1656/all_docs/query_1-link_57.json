In her current research projects, she examines the patent law doctrine of inequitable conduct frm a comparative perspective, considers the federal courts’ response to litigant misconduct, and explores the specialized conflicts issues increasingly encountered in intellectual property practice. Examples of recent works relating to the courts and law and the media, respectively, are “One Patent, Two Paths: Federal Circuit Review of Divergent USPTO and District Court Decisions,” published in a 2011 issue of the ABA’s Landslide magazine, and “The United States Patent System in the Media Mirror,” which was selected for publication in the 2009 edition of Patent Law Review from Thomson Reuters.\n\nDuring a sabbatical leave from Syracuse University, she served as a law clerk to the Hon. Paul F. Michel, Judge (Ret.), United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. She has served since January 2005 as a member of the Federal Circuit’s Advisory Council.

After graduating from law school, he clerked for Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel and subsequently spent several years as a civil litigator with Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco. Before coming to Syracuse University, Professor Anand was a Visiting Associate Professor of Law at Chicago-Kent College of Law, during which time he taught classes in legal ethics and criminal law, and received the 2004 Faculty Member of the Year award.\n\nProfessor Anand’s scholarly interests lie at the intersection of legal theory and legal ethics. More specifically, Professor Anand is writing a series of papers on the “cultural study of the lawyer” (cultural study understood as a form of philosophical-anthropology). The organizing principle of this project is that law in America is a cultural practice and the national commitment thereto — to living as a community under the rule of law — gives rise to a variety of professional obligations for a lawyer, first and foremost of which is that he or she must serve We the People. This argument directly challenges conventional wisdom, which looks not to the American dedication to self-government, but to moral conscience, the adversarial processs, or economic self-interest, among other things, when taking up questions of a lawyer’s ethics. A complete list of Professor Anand’s published writing can be found on his bio page at the Syracuse University College of Law site under publications. These publications can be downloaded from his SSRN author page. Those interested in a detailed introduction to the cultural study of the lawyer should read Legal Ethics, Jurisprudence, and the Cultural Study of the Lawyer, 81 Temp. L. Rev. 737 (2008).\n\nAmy Bach, Research Fellow\n\nbach@measuresforjustice.org\n\nAmy Bach founded a non-profit Measures for Justice in April 2011 to address problems she researched for her book, Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court, which won the 2010 Robert F. Kennedy Book Award and other acclaim. A graduate of Stanford Law School and member of the New York Bar, Bach began to research the book in 2001 and was quickly struck by widespread patterns of errors, invisible to the very people who work with these problems every day. She realized that victims, defendants and their families had no way to prove they’d been treated unfairly. Their only recourse to justice seemed to be via a larger measuring apparatus that could expose the treatment they and millions like them were suffering in the courts. Bach decided she had to do more than just write about the myriad injustices she witnessed, and launched Measures for Justice. Echoing Green, a premier seed investor for social entrepreneurs, selected her as a 2011 Fellow out of 3,000 candidates worldwide.\n\nBach was previously a Knight Foundation Journalism Fellow at Yale Law School, a Soros Justice Fellow, and a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. This year she received Gideon Award from Florida’s Palm Beach County Public Defender office, which recognizes exemplary work supporting equal justice for indigent communities.\n\nJeremy Blumenthal, Faculty Fellow\n\nProfessor Blumenthal passed away on December 18, 2014.

He earned his Juris Doctor and graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was Editor-in-Chief of the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law and received several writing prizes. Most recently, he was a Faculty Fellow at Seton Hall Law School, teaching 1L Property and Law and the Social Sciences. Previously, he clerked for the Honorable Maryanne Trump Barry of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and was an Associate for Latham & Watkins, LLP, in the Newark, NJ office. Professor Blumenthal has published widely on topics in law and psychology, including demeanor evidence, the reasonable woman standard, victim impact statements, and more generally on the role of social science in assisting the legal system. His article, “Who Decides? Privileging Public Sentiment about Justice and the Substantive Law”discusses how lawmakers can best achieve a fair society in which individuals respect and comply with the rule of law and how they can ensure that the framework of law that they develop is just. He has also published in the areas of evidence and comparative law. His most recent publications focus on the role of emotions in the legal system; current research projects address topics in capital punishment, empirical work in law and psychology, and topics in property theory.\n\nIan Gallacher, Faculty Fellow\n\nigallach@law.syr.edu, 315-442-4105\n\nIan Gallacher received a bachelor’s degree in music, with honors, from the University of Leeds, a Master of Fine Arts degree in orchestral conducting from Carnegie-Mellon University, and a J.D., magna cum laude, from the Washington College of Law.
