        "text": "HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY! To all the women out there in the world. To the woman in the healthcare profession, to the woman in tech, to the woman in sports, and the woman who is an entrepreneur, a singer, a dancer or even a painter. To the work-from-home mom, the housewife or even the single mother. We all complete the circle of life and society, and have our responsibilities to play in this societal ecosystem--none of which is trivial. While it may seem that some of us must have cracked the code to being Maya Angelou's Phenomenal woman or the Bible's Proverbs 31 woman hence have every detail of our lives put in place, we must first remember that the only code to crack is the code of LOVE. Love for ourselves, for one another and for our communities. This year's theme-- Invest in women: Accelerate Progress-- is a timely reminder for us to invest in our mental and physical health, our professional development as well as valuable relationships. In the end, every family and society that invests in its women will have accelerated progress as their returns. Even though it is International Women's Day today, I also want to thank all our brothers, fathers, husbands and friends who have not 'clipped our wings' or caged us but have given us the permission to soar and personally, I also want to use today to acknowledge all the women and men who have invested in me in the past and present. Cheers to INSPIRING INCLUSION! #IWD2024 #INSPIRINGINCLUSION\n\n🌟 Happy International Women’s Day! 🌟 Today, we celebrate the strength, resilience, and achievements of women around the world. 🙌 As we honor the progress made, let’s also recognize the work that remains ahead. 💪 🌸 Here are some inspiring words to uplift and empower you: • “Empowered women empower women.” Let’s lift each other up, share knowledge, and create a supportive network. 💕 • Believe in your dreams, break barriers, and pave the way for generations to come. 👑 • Trust in your abilities, embrace challenges, and make your mark. 🌟 • “In a world where you can be anything, be kind.” Kindness is a superpower that transcends boundaries. 🌎 • “Behind every successful woman is a tribe of other successful women who have her back.” Let’s build that tribe! 🤝 🌼 How can you make a difference? • 𝗔𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗩𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Share stories of remarkable women who inspire you. Use your platform to raise awareness about their achievements. 🗣️ • 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽: Offer guidance and mentorship to aspiring women in your field.

Let’s inspire change! 💪💕 #IWD2024 #WomenEmpowerment #Inclusion #Equality\n\n\"Embracing Womanhood: My Journey of Discovery and Empowerment\" Reflecting on my upbringing, I recall a time when I envied the perceived freedom afforded to boys. It seemed they could navigate the world with ease, while I, as a girl, encountered constant reminders of societal expectations and limitations. These constraints weighed heavily on me, fostering a sense of inadequacy and frustration. Throughout my formative years, I grappled with the notion that my gender defined my capabilities and opportunities. The disparity in treatment between boys and girls left me feeling overlooked and undervalued. The pressure to conform to conventional standards of femininity only served to exacerbate these feelings, leading me to question my worth and potential. Despite these challenges, my journey toward self-discovery and empowerment began when I realized the inherent strength and resilience that comes with being a woman. I learned to embrace my femininity not as a limitation, but as a source of power and authenticity. It was a transformative shift in perspective that allowed me to reclaim my narrative and define success on my own terms. As we commemorate International Women's Day, I am reminded of the countless women who have blazed trails and shattered glass ceilings, paving the way for future generations. Their courage and tenacity serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for women everywhere. To my fellow women, I urge you to embrace your uniqueness and recognize the boundless potential that resides within you. Together, let us challenge outdated norms and redefine what it means to be a woman in today's world. We are strong, resilient, and capable of achieving anything we set our minds to. Here's to celebrating the strength, courage, and resilience of women around the globe. Happy International Women's Day! ❤️ #iwd2024 #iwd\n\nHappy International Women's Day! Today, as we celebrate the remarkable achievements of women around the world, I want to turn our attention to the future. Empowering the next generation of women leaders is not just a goal; it's a responsibility we all share. As we look ahead, it's crucial to invest in our daughters, nieces, sisters, and mentees, ensuring they have the tools, support, and opportunities to thrive in any field they choose. From STEM to business, politics to the arts, the potential of young women is boundless. I want to encourage them to dream big, to pursue their passions fearlessly, and to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. As we work towards a more equitable and inclusive future, let's remember that empowering women isn't just the right thing to do; it's also the smart thing to do. Diverse perspectives lead to innovation, resilience, and progress. So, on this International Women's Day, let's commit to lifting each other up, to being mentors and allies, and to creating a world where every girl can reach her full potential. Together, we can shape a brighter, more inclusive future for all. I am very proud to be working for #DXCTechnology who supports this goal globally by offering equal opportunities, flexible working and incredible supportive environment not just for women but for all underrepresented groups. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2024 #InspireInclusion #WomenLeaders #Diversity #FutureLeadership\n\nThe U.N. is celebrating International Women's Day with a powerful theme: \"Invest in women, accelerate progress.\" It's a big rally cry with three big gaps that need to be closed to actualize its potential... 1. Opportunity to be hired, promoted, and rewarded for our earned wisdom, skills, and experience. Women over 45 are not old. They're expensive and invaluable. 2. Equality spanning all manner of areas from our gender, rights, and pay, to the financial investment we need to support the businesses we can create and lead that will stimulate opportunity and the world economy. 3. Agency over our bodies and career trajectories. Opportunity, equality, and agency will take time. But that doesn't mean we have to wait. 🔥We can support and invest in one another right now. History's taught us there's nothing but upside when we come together with shared vision. 🔥As I look to the future, it is ours to create. Everything is possible, if we believe it is and we believe we deserve to realize it. Reflecting on where we've been fuels me with a ridiculous amount of determination, strength and inspiration. 🔥Countless women have unapologetically blazed trails and changed the course of history. They stepped into their power so you and I could travel a little easier and manifest even greater opportunities. 🔥If you and I are audacious enough to believe that we can, we can and we will accelerate progress. We are the women making history now. The way we think, persist, and contribute every day matters. We are creating legacies for every woman who will come behind us. Our possibilities are endless. 🔥Showing up for ourselves with curiosity, courage, and fierce determination is the starting point that gets the flywheel turning. 🔥By supporting and investing in each other, we can build the future and show the world what's possible. On a very personal note, I am beyond grateful for the smart, talented, inspiring, and overall badass women in my life. Thank you for your love and support. Happy #iwd2024 to you! May we all prosper and change the world together. How have you been supported by another woman? How are you investing in the women in your life? #womensupportingwomen #investinwomen\n\n🎉 Celebrating the Remarkable 🎉 🌐 Women Who Shape Our World 🌐 Today, on International Women's Day, we should all take a moment to celebrate the incredible women who inspire us every day.

On this occasion of International Women’s Day, I applaud the depth and vulnerability which may be seen as a weakness as an expression of strength, her resilience, the epitome of love and the emotional range of women who can hold space for all. I celebrate the women who continue to prove that it is not only possible to achieve those dreams, but it is possible to exceed the expectations of what is possible. There are no limits unless those you create for yourself. Women have always been at the forefront of nurturing dreams and fiercely striving to be seen, heard, and included in a world they hold dear. So, let us invest in and accelerate her progress, amplify her voice, and recognize she is a force. It is fair to acknowledge that slowly society is making space for inclusion and there have been cultural shifts to accommodate and acknowledge women who push beyond the borders of gender, making room for those who dare to dream. However, we can do better and invest more in women. The world we envision lies on the other side of inclusion and acceleration of women. So, we continue to lend our voices to the conversations of inclusion and empowerment of women. Also, making our impacts in society, leading and uplifting the younger generation of women to limitless possibilities. We can create an enabling environment where women can thrive and ultimately change the narrative of what a woman is allowed to be. For there are no limits to what a woman can be or should be if we invest in her and accelerate her progress. To every woman out there trying to fit into the image of who she wants to be, know what she can be, you should know there are no limits unless those you set for yourself. The dreamers, the achievers, the nurturers, the backbones, the woman who wants it all, know you can have it all; love, success, and impact. You no longer have to choose one, the world you hope exists isn't a facade. Keep pushing beyond borders. Happy International Women's Day. #iwd2024 #iwd2024womenleadingtheway #inspireinclusion\n\n🌟 Happy #IWD2024! 🌟 Today, as we celebrate International Women's Day, let's draw inspiration from the empowering words of the phenomenal Michelle Obama. \"When you recognize your light, you are better prepared to share it.\" These words resonate deeply, reminding us of the importance of acknowledging our own strengths and potential. As women, it's crucial to realize the unique brilliance we each possess and to embrace it fully. Michelle's wisdom reminds us that breaking barriers and tearing down walls requires a profound self-awareness. We must understand our limits, value our time, nurture our health, and maintain spiritual balance. It's from this place of inner strength that we can truly rise and take action. So today, I extend an invitation to all women to step into leadership roles within their businesses and personal lives. Whether it's pioneering a new project, advocating for change, or simply leading by example, let's be catalysts for progress and empowerment. Let's be the action! Happy International Women's Solidarity Day to all the incredible women out there! 💪🌸 #IWD2024 #WomenLeadership #Empowerment\n\nHappy International Women’s Day, to all the women there who are pushing boundaries defying stereotypes and making a positive impact in the world!
