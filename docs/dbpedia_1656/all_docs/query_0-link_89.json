This was my decision and not a result of pressure from the AAS Staff, the AAS Board of Directors, or EAA contributors. My reasons for resignation include the cumulative effects of decades of exceptionally heavy year-round workloads, a desire to spend more time with my family, and because of my age, aspirations to be of service to others in different ways that would be impossible without increased time opportunitie...\n\nFeature Article\n\nTeaching about Myanmar and the Rohingya through One Man’s Eyes\n\nTeaching about Myanmar and the Rohingya through One Man’s Eyes Introduction by EAA Editorial Office Background Facts for Teachers and Students Physical and Human Geography [caption id=\"attachment_24503\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"] Image 1: Myanmar (Burma) superimposed on the United States.

In the three graphic novels discussed below, the hardships that the protagonists and their families endure do not end when they arrive in another land. The migrants struggle to integrate economically and culturally into societies that view them with skept...\n\nFeature Article\n\nMuseums, Monuments, and Memorials: Commemorating the American War in Vietnam\n\nThe Vietnam War was the first major conflict that the United States lost.1 This theme of loss is made corporeal by a smooth black granite wall on the National Mall into which is etched the names of the more than 58,000 Americans who died. Unlike the monuments nearby that celebrate America’s victory over fascism in World War II or heroic troops cast in steel depicted bravely weathering the elements in Korea, the memorial to Vietnam is in effect a collective headstone.

This class uses examinations of material objects (not only museums, monuments, and memorials, but also archives, school curriculum, and oral histories) to explore how history does not exist as a passive, fixed account, but is instead an active and ongoing struggle to shape narratives, preserve memory, and influence collective consciousness. In this class, we explore history as a living, contested te...\n\nFacts About Asia\n\nFacts About Asia: The Modi Government and Religious Freedom\n\nCONTEXT India’s population is approximately 1.39 billion (2023 estimate), making it the second-most populous country in the world.

Daughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden is the first volume I have seen describing the parallel lives of family members separated accidentally in 1949, and reunited decades later.

Gender inequality is inherent in my culture and begins with the birth of a female child that is unwanted and comes to this world against the wishes of parents for a male offspring. In a patriarchal society there is an interplay of culture, religion, and law that always restricts women’s rights. For example, the Islamic religion and Pakistani legal system clearly specify the laws of inheritance for women, but culturally, Pakis...\n\nFeature Article\n\nDaughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden in the Classroom\n\nZhuqing Li’s Daughters of the Flower Fra­grant Garden offers an exciting new twist on a classic Civil War motif, the “brother against brother” narrative. This story is not about two brothers who chose to fight on opposite sides of a bitter war against each other on personal or moral grounds, but rather two sisters who, con­trary to their own desires, and even at odds with their own convictions, were separated from each other by a conflict that lasted most of their adult lives. The Civil ...\n\nFeature Article\n\nA Family Separated by the Bamboo Curtain\n\nAs a child in Mao-era Fuzhou, Zhuqing Li’s walk to school followed a path that took her past a secluded compound built atop Cangqian Hill. Only residents of the complex—high-level administrators at a teach­er’s college—could pass through the gate guard­ed by sentries and see what lay hidden behind solid stone walls. “Like something from a fairy tale,” Li remembers, the compound loomed over the city below it, “forbidding and aloof.” One day, Li pursued a runaway ball through ..."
