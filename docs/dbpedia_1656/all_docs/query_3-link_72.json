The course concludes with a contemporary novel chosen by the students in the class.\n\nStudents must complete the readings, explore archival material on the web for selected authors and attend all lectures.\n\nStudents must enroll in a section in order to take the course; attendance at section will not only enhance the intellectual benefit and pleasure of the course (and will fill out 5% of your grade) but will also help you in preparing the papers. Your papers and exams will be graded by your TF.\n\nWritten work will consist of:\n\n1. Two graded papers: each a literary analysis of a single text, minimum 5 pages, maximum 8 pages.\n\n2. Final exam: will cover the whole semester; identifications, passage readings, and one essay. The papers, lectures and section discussions, if pursued with energy and attended regularly, should prepare you well for the exam."
