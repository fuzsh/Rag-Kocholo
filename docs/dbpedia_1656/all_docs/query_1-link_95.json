        "text": "I write primarily in my home office. If I was to go to a café or other public place, I would be far too distracted. However, I do sometimes do a little writing at groups such as South Shield’s Fiction Writers at The Word. My office however remains my number one spot. On my desk, which is usually much messier than this… I have my Apple I-Mac – I had always wanted one and received this as a present from my wife, Amy for my fortieth birthday. Sitting on the right of my computer is a beautiful get well soon card from Amy and our Labrador, Laddy. I keep it there because of the image on the front. I have my lamp – for when I am writing late into the night or early in the morning. A phrenology head because who doesn’t think they are ace?! They tell you what parts of the brain are responsible for what thought processes – amazing.\n\nOn the left I have a photograph of my nanna, who the book is dedicated to along with Amy. She looks like a movie star. It’s a photo I think she would have approved of, rather than clip me around the ear for sharing it with everyone. In front of her is a little green buddha that Amy bought for me when we were Santa Monica. We went there for my Stem Cell Replacement Therapy when I was deathly poorly. My nanna loved Bubbhas and always rubbed their bellies three times before bingo! I do it before reading emails etc haha. There is also a little elephant ornament because my nanna loved them. There’s a wishing well, my mum’s mum, my nan had one in her garden (not a real one), and a well-done trophy for the Bloody Scotland pitch perfect competition – that Amy bought me (they are hidden behind my computer).\n\nUnderneath nanna is a photograph of my mum looking very thoughtful, it was taken when she was battling cancer and reminds me of what it means to be strong and resilient. She survived thank goodness, but it was a terrifying time. There’s a love heart stress reliever - do writers get stressed? Erm… YEP! There are dictionaries, thesauruses, a pot of pens, Morbid Anatomy of the Human Body (that I bought in Barters Books in Alnwick). I also have a little book entitled ‘words to help you be strong’. There’s a funny book called Revenge of the Librarians, cartoons by Tom Gauld – I bought it recently in The Accidental Bookshop in Alnwick. My writing bibles are The Real CSI by Kate Bendelow – every crime writer should have a copy. Forensics by Val McDermid. The Mind of a Murderer by Dr Richard Taylor – bought after listening to him speak at Bloody Scotland, what a fascinating man. The Writer’s Handbook, a guide to crime writing. New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors, bought after a recommendation by Mari Hannah.\n\nI also have copies of Save the Cat by Blake Snyder and Save the Cat Writes a Novel by Jessica Brody. However, when I decided I needed to learn how to plan I asked Diane Chamberlain for advice as I simply could not master it. Diane recommended I look up Alexandra Sokoloff who she knew from a writing group and who had taught the group her method. Diane explained she had ‘never looked back’. I then met Alex at Harrogate’s Peculiar Crime Writing Festival and subsequently took her online course. I can now plan! However, my method remains quite free and spontaneous. I plan an outline – using the eight sequences, three act structure then I know I won’t get too lost. Sometimes the characters and story surprises me and what is on the plan is likely to be fairly different to what is in the final draft. While writing The Raven’s Mark I did not use this method at all. In future I think I will use a mixture. Most of my planning is in retrospect. I tend to write around three quarters of the book then reread and plan the ending – again with fluidity. It allows my characters to breathe and decide for themselves.\n\nWhen I write I get into ‘the zone’ - I live and breathe the world I am creating. I speak the dialogue as I write, so that I know it sounds natural and because it helps me stay in the story. Amy says I sound and look like a mad woman because my voice and expression changes with the characters. I feel as though I am almost channelling them, and they are dictating the story. I know that sounds utterly bonkers but it’s true, after a while the characters really do take me on their journey. Sometimes they surprise me and there’s a twist I didn’t anticipate and suchlike. It makes for an exciting process.\n\nIf I am ever a bit ‘stuck’ I will go for a drive, when I am concentrating on driving and freeing my mind of worries and other things my brain suddenly unlocks. Then there are the many times I am trying to sleep and my brain decides to work out a story issue. After that I usually give in, get up and get writing… hence the much-needed desk lamp. Sometimes I am sitting by the beach at one of the many gorgeous seafronts around here and my mind is free to wander, or I am walking around in a ‘story daze’. At some point things seem to ‘click’ and I can go back to my desk with a clear idea of where the story is currently heading.\n\nNext to my desk is a footstool I never utilise for its correct purpose. Instead, as you can see, I use it as a handy shelf. On it at the moment are books covering the timeframe of the standalone novel I have just finished writing. It is a psychological crime thriller that has dual timelines told from two character’s POVs. It is 1990 and 1962 and onwards until the stories come together. When I am writing in another time period, I like to ensure the details are correct. The character might be watching television and I want to know what was on TV on that specific day. I want to know what songs will have been on the radio, or in the charts. What kids will have been into. What was on the news. What they would have dressed like, what furniture they would have had. I think about things such as if a character is not wealthy, they might well have second-hand furniture which will mean it is from an earlier style. Research, fact checking then more research and fact checking… Whatever I write I want to be in the know.\n\nIn my office currently are three beautiful boxes containing the most precious cargo; my book. I LOVE what Joffe have done with The Raven’s Mark cover, it is original, eye catching and gorgeous. I can’t stop looking at them. The most surreal moment for me thus far has been flicking through the pages and allowing it to resonate that it’s my story, my words out of my head. And it is all in a book, an honest to goodness book! Wow, this is what dreams are made of!\n\nI have a LOT of bookcases in my office but the most special one contains all my signed books. I love being surrounded by the authors who inspire me. I find that if I am reading a lot then writing comes more easily. My TBR pile could probably keep me going if I ever needed to create a fall-out shelter and hide for years. It doesn’t mean I stop buying books – I simply can’t. Something amusing to share with you as a little aside is that when we moved a few years ago the moving men complained about all the books. They said we should have warned them beforehand. We were asked to mention any large items such as furniture and white goods, they didn’t say anything about extremely heavy boxes – oops. And that was years ago – my collection has since swelled out of control. Maybe I shouldn’t move again? And we do live in a farmhouse with no neighbours, only cows and sheep. We have a view of Lindisfarne/Holy Island. It’s pretty much perfect for a writer and an artist, which my wife is. So, yes, maybe staying put is for the best.\n\nI have created a huge planning board after learning the method from Alexandra Sokoloff. The extra notes on it, which are on white card are little characteristics and dates of birth etc. I also create a character bible and interview my characters to get to know them better. I need to know how they would react in any given situation. I need to know how they take their coffee or if they are more of a tea drinker. I need them to feel alive to me so that they will be alive for my reader. And, if my story is particularly complicated to write then I need to ensure I don’t leave plot holes or suddenly change someone’s eye colour – for example.\n\nAbove my computer, on the wall, is a white board that Amy writes inspirational notes on for me to read when I sit down to write. Very sweet.\n\nI love the quote that Amy printed and framed – ‘A professional writer is an amateur who didn’t quit.’ By Richard Bach. How true is that? Hanging on it are lanyards from the Peculiar Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate and the Capital Crime Writing Festival in London.\n\nI have a framed image of the Capital Crime Writing Festival list of authors from 2022. When I attended the first Capital Crime, I was teetering on the edge of giving in. I didn’t think someone like me could be an author and I had only been out of intensive care for a few days – after surviving Sepsis for the third time. Amy had bought the tickets for my birthday, so I was determined to go. I arrived in a wheelchair; I was a mess and feeling terrible. But the buzz I got from the panels, being around other aspiring authors, book enthusiasts and most of all my writing heroes was immeasurable. It felt as though the festival was pumping adrenaline into my veins. By the end of the weekend, I was out of the wheelchair, rushing from one panel to the next. I was a sweaty state but my God, did I love it. The best thing about it was realising they were extraordinary but ordinary people at the same time – that I could be an author if I put the work in.\n\nI went home more determined than ever. I joined every writing group anywhere near us, I attended the Crime and Publishment weekend in Gretna Green after a recommendation from M W Craven. I joined Jericho Writers, and I studied on whatever courses I could afford. I read books and did my research. I also attended Swanwick Writers’ Summer School after meeting Kate Bendelow at Crime and Publishment, we quickly became friends, and she suggested I attend.\n\nSince then, I have won the Joffe Books Prize and signed with my agent, Northbank Talent Management. I appeared at Capital Crime as a speaker this year, just as the lanyard on the left of the image says. My name is on the bottom left-hand side of the list of authors. I came full circle. And I want to thank everyone who helped me get here.\n\nTHE RAVEN’S MARK BY CHRISTIE J. NEWPORT IS OUT NOW"
