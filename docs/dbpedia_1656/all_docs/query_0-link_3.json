        "text": "Main category: American novelists\n\nThis is a list of novelists from the United States, listed with titles of a major work for each.\n\nThis is not intended to be a list of every American (born U.S. citizen, naturalized citizen, or long-time resident alien) who has published a novel. (For the purposes of this article, novel is defined as an extended work of fiction. This definition is loosely interpreted to include novellas, novelettes, and books of interconnected short stories.) Novelists on this list have achieved a notability that exceeds merely having been published. The writers on the current list fall into one or more of the following categories:\n\nAll American novelists who have articles in Wikipedia should be on this list, and even if they do not clearly meet any other criteria they should not be removed until the article itself is removed.\n\nWinner of a major literary prize, even if the winning work was a story collection rather than a novel: The Pulitzer Prize, The PEN American Center Book Awards, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Orange Prize, and some others. (Note: The only Pulitzer winner for Fiction not on the list is James Alan McPherson, who has never published a novel.)\n\nHaving a substantial body of work, widely respected and reviewed in major publications, and perhaps often nominated or a finalist for major awards.\n\nA pioneering literary figure, possibly for the style or substance of their entire body of work, or for a single novel that was a notable \"first\" of some kind in U.S. literary history.\n\nHad several massive bestsellers, or even just one huge seller that has entered the cultural lexicon (Grace Metalious and Peyton Place, for example).\n\nA leading figure—especially award-winning, and with crossover appeal to mainstream readers, reviewers, and scholars—in a major genre or subcategory of fiction: Romance, science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, western, young adult fiction, regional or \"local color\" fiction, proletarian fiction, etc.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nVictoria Aveyard (born 1990), Red Queen series\n\n\"The Great American Novel\"\n\nAmerican literature\n\nColonial American literature\n\nSouthern literature\n\nAfrican American literature\n\nJewish American literature\n\nLGBT literature\n\nLists of writers\n\nList of short story authors\n\nList of novelists by nationality\n\nList of women writers\n\nList of African-American writers\n\nList of Asian-American writers\n\nList of Jewish American authors\n\nList of writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas\n\nAwards\n\nPulitzer Prize for the Novel (1918–1947)\n\nPulitzer Prize for Fiction (1948 to present)\n\nNational Book Award\n\nBestsellers\n\nPublishers Weekly lists of bestselling novels in the United States (The top ten each year from 1900 to 2008)\n\nNelson, Emmanuel S.
