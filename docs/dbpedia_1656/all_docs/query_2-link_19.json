He is an ‘ukulele virtuoso, slack key guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, singer-songwriter, producer, audio engineer, and record company owner. He is a six-time Grammy Award winner, twelve-time Grammy Award nominee, six-time Taiwanese Golden Melody Award winner, and recipient of multiple Hawaiian Music awards.\n\nHis collaborations transcend genres – from traditional and contemporary Hawaiian Music to World Music with Taiwanese aboriginals and Mongolian nomads, to duets with Pepe Romero the maestro of classical guitar, to contemporary jazz and rock with Tak Matsumoto of the Japanese supergroup, B’z. Daniel’s music has been featured in film and television in projects such as The Descendants, Soul Surfer, the TV series Hawaiʻi Five-O, and NHK (Japan). A notable mention is his performance of a Hawaiian-language rendition of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” for the end credits of the 2008 movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\n\nAlways looking to inspire and share, Daniel performs concerts and teaches workshops throughout the US and internationally. As an American Cultural Ambassador, he has toured Japan, Australia, Brunei, and Thailand. He is the co-designer of the Romero Creations Tiny Tenor ‘ukulele, the Ohana Bongolele and Shakerlele line of percussion instruments, and his ‘ukulele is currently on display at the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles. A new skill picked up during the pandemic: music video production! Daniel has been channeling creativity into filming and editing music videos that add a new and energetic dimension to his repertoire."
