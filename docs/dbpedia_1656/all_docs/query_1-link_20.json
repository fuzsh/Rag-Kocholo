        "text": "Nutrition myths in the vegan community | Ginny Messina\n\nIn Episode #217, I sit down with dietician Ginny Messina to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet. “It is not difficult to meet nutrient needs on a vegan diet, but it is not intuitive either.” With an abundance of nutrition “information” presented to us any time we use social media, it becomes difficult […]\n\nCholesterol denialists are wrong | Dr Alan Flanagan\n\nWe are reposting this episode because it’s now available in full-length video on YouTube. In Episode #159 I sat down with Alan Flanagan to talk about cholesterol and the diet-heart hypothesis, with a specific focus on the work of Ancel Keys. “What was quite brilliant about the seven countries study was the regional diversity, even […]\n\nLower your cholesterol with these foods | Dr David Jenkins\n\nIn Episode #216, I sit down with Dr David Jenkins to discuss the relationship between blood cholesterol levels and health. Cholesterol levels are concerningly high among populations consuming a standard Western diet – as I write in my book The Proof is in the Plants LDL cholesterol levels in both Australia and America are about […]\n\nIs fructose driving metabolic disease? | Dr Richard Johnson\n\nIn Episode #215, I’m joined by Dr Richard Johnson to discuss obesity, fructose, and metabolic disease. “Obesity itself isn’t the problem – it’s the things that accompany obesity.” “Fructose” has become something of a fear word in modern diet culture. It is often positioned as the villain, without the in-depth breakdown of where we are […]\n\nProducing animal proteins without animals | Josh Tetrick\n\nIn Episode #214, I sit down with Josh Tetrick to discuss reshaping our food system towards plant-based products and slaughter-free meat alternatives. “We’ve created a food system that has made it remarkably easy to do unkind things.” As animal-free proteins grow in popularity, technologies for creating them are too. Josh Tetrick wants to reshape our […]\n\nBuilding a strong immune system | Dr Jenna Macciochi\n\nIn Episode #213, Dr Jenna Macciochi joins me for a deep dive into the human immune system. “Your body needs time to heal, and time cannot be found in supplements and protocols – it’s something we need a culture change for.” “Immunity” has become a buzzword in health spheres at the moment. From supplement marketing […]\n\nFermented foods, fibre and immunity | Dr Justin Sonnenburg & Dr Christopher Gardner\n\nWe are reposting this episode now because it’s now available in video on YouTube. In Episode #191 I sat down with Stanford University Professor’s Dr Christopher Gardner and Dr Justin Sonnenburg to talk about fermented foods, fibre, gut health and immunity. This conversation was organised following the results of their latest randomised controlled trial ‘Gut-microbiota-targeted […]\n\nCreatine for brain health & physical performance | Dr Eric Rawson\n\nIn Episode #212, Dr Eric Rawson joins me to examine the muscular and cognitive effects of creatine. “[Creatine] allows us to train harder, recover better in the weight room, and improves quality of life because it enhances strength and conditioning.” Performance supplementation is a flooded field. With supplementation sceptics on one hand and relentless marketing […]\n\nThe future of dairy | Dr Jared Raynes\n\nIn Episode #211, I sit down with Dr Jared Raynes to discuss precision fermentation and the future of dairy. “We need technologies like this to be able to actually feed the world in the coming decade.” As our world becomes more populated and animal agriculture continues to unsustainably expand, we need to examine alternatives to […]\n\nUsing science to build muscle and grow stronger | Dr Stuart Phillips\n\nIn Episode #210, Professor Stuart Phillips returns to expand on our conversation about using science to improve training outcomes. “In young, healthy people who are physically active, you are actually very efficient at getting the protein that you need digested and absorbed.” One very common criticism of a plant-based diet is that it’s difficult to […]"
