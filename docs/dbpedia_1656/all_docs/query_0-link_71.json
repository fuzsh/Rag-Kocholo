        "text": "OLLI FALL SEMESTER 2016 - COURSES\n\nWe are pleased to present these descriptions of our fall semester courses, arranged by subject area. (Note: These categories recognize the predominant discipline, but many of these courses are interdisciplinary in their focus.)\n\nAll courses meet for 8 weeks unless otherwise noted in the description. An overview of class meeting times can be found here. All courses meet at OLLI’s location in the M2 Building, 301 North Neil Street (Suite 201), downtown Champaign.\n\nBrowse courses by subject\n\nArts and Culture\n\nContemporary Issues\n\nFilm Studies\n\nHistory\n\nLaw and Government\n\nLiterature and Storytelling\n\nMedicine\n\nMusic\n\nReligious Studies\n\nScience and Technology\n\nWellness and Aging\n\nWriting\n\nARTS AND CULTURE\n\nBob Dylan, Songwriter\n\nWillis Goth Regier\n\nThursday, 11:00-12:30; September 15 through October 6 (4 weeks)\n\nThis is a 4-week course that meets during the first half of the semester\n\nDylan is 75 this year and still active.Â He has released sixty albums, including six retrospectives. No one asks any longer why he calls his current round of public performances his “Never Ending Tour.” In a 1968 interview he said, “I’m a firm believer in the longer you live, the better you get.” Forty-eight years later we can ask whether he was right. We will discuss Dylan’s career, lyrics, and public persona, among other topics. We will ask: In what genres did Dylan excel? Are there distinct phases in his career?Â Which performers covered a Dylan song better than Dylan did? We will compare favorite albums and songs. If you’ve lost track of Dylan, this is a chance to catch up. If you’ve lived with Dylan most of your life, please share. OLLI members who’ve attended Dylan’s concerts are especially encouraged to enroll.Â\n\nInstructor: Willis Regier retired in 2015 as the Director of the University of Illinois Press. At the University of Nebraska Press he originated Bach Perspectives, Beethoven Forum, and Brahms Studies and published books by Richard Wagner, Arnold Schoenberg, BÃ©la BartÃ³k, Woody Guthrie, and Pete Seeger; at the University of Illinois Press he published The Beethoven Sketchbook Series, edited by Professor William Kinderman.Â Regier is the author of three books and editor of another.Â His reviews and essays have appeared in American Academic, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Modern Language Notes, World Literature Today, and other journals. His recent OLLI courses on Aesop and Samuel Beckett received strong reviews for the instructor’s broad knowledge and skillful teaching.\n\nLiving and Dancing in New Harmony - Cancelled\n\nJonathan Sivier\n\nPicasso’s Influence on Contemporary Art\n\nRosalyn Schwartz\n\nTuesday, 11:00-12:30; September 13 through October 4 (4 weeks)\n\nThis is a 4-week course that meets during the first half of the semester.\n\nUndoubtedly Picasso was one of the most brilliant artists of the twentieth century but as Jonathan Jones writes in his essay for The Guardian, “We view Picasso not as a curious historical figure but as a living force, accessible, universal. What makes him so contemporary?” In this 4-week course, we will see just how Picasso’s art is still so influential and relevant to contemporary painting today. The first two sessions will present an overview of Picasso’s oeuvre and discuss his prodigious evolution; in the remaining two sessions, students will learn about contemporary painters, including Anton Henning and Michelle Wasson among others, who directly or indirectly continue to use Picasso’s work for inspiration today, more than forty years after his death.\n\nInstructor: Professor Emerita of Art Rosalyn Schwartz taught painting and drawing for twenty years at the University of Illinois. In May 2008, Ms. Schwartz chose to take an early retirement so that she could devote herself full-time to working in her studio. She is the recipient of a number of prestigious grants including a Bush Foundation Fellowship, a McKnight Foundation Fellowship, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. In 2010 she had a mid-career survey exhibition of her paintings at Gallery 210 on the campus of University of Missouri-St. Louis. In 2013 she had a solo exhibition at the McNay Museum of Art in San Antonio, Texas titled “Rosalyn Schwartz: A Brief History of Seduction” and in 2014 her work was included in a group exhibition titled “Beauty Reigns: A Baroque Sensibility in Recent Painting.” A catalogue was published for this exhibition with essays by noted art critics Lilly Wei and Stephen Westfall. Her OLLI courses on contemporary art have received strong evaluations for her insightful presentations and well-chosen examples.\n\nCONTEMPORARY ISSUES\n\nAll the President’s Men to Spotlight: Investigative Journalism in Film\n\nBrant Houston\n\nTuesday, 9:00-10:30; October 4 through October 25 (4 weeks)\n\nThis is a 4-week course that meets on an irregular schedule.\n\nThis 4-week course will look at the films that have most accurately portrayed the work of investigative journalists with in-class discussions about the films.Â We will view excerpts from films that include All the President’s Men, The Insider, Page One, and Spotlight and talk about the differences between stereotypes of investigative journalists and how the journalists actually work. The course also will include a historical overview of investigative journalism, how it has developed in sophistication and approaches, and its presentation in films over the past 80 years.\n\nInstructor: Professor Brant Houston holds the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation Chair in Investigative and Enterprise Reporting and teaches investigative and advanced reporting in the Department of Journalism in the College of Media at Illinois. Houston became the chair after serving for more than a decade as the executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), a 3,500-member organization, and as a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. Before joining IRE, he was an award-winning investigative reporter at daily newspapers for seventeen years. His OLLI courses have received outstanding reviews for the instructor’s insights and the many resources that he shares with students.\n\nThe Changing US Footprint in Africa: Special Ops, Drones, and the Occasional School\n\nJanice Jayes\n\nMonday, 11:00-12:30; September 12 through October 31\n\nWhile much of the U.S. public’s foreign policy attention has been focused elsewhere, the quiet expansion of US military activities in Africa has showcased the way in which security strategy has changed in the last decade. Fear of failed states, organized crime networks, health crises, and destabilizing climate change has led the U.S. to interact with regional organizations and local governments in new ways. The collapse of Libya in 2011 further spurred the use of Africa as both a frontline and a laboratory for the U.S. military. This class examines the ways in which U.S. partnerships and activities depart from older models of US defense.\n\nInstructor: Janice Jayes, Ph.D., taught politics and history at Al Akhawayn in Morocco in 2008-2009 before moving to Champaign. She teaches Middle Eastern History at Illinois State University. She earned her Ph.D. in History (with a specialization in U.S. foreign relations) from The American University, and her M.S. in International Relations from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. She was a Fulbright Teaching Scholar at the American University of Cairo in Egypt. She is interested in contemporary foreign relations and has worked in Latvia, Argentina, Kyrgyzstan and Egypt. Her past OLLI courses have drawn outstanding reviews for her exceptional teaching style and deep knowledge of the subject.\n\nPolitical Humor\n\nTom Neufer Emswiler\n\nWednesday, 3:30-5:00; September 14 through November 2\n\nIn the fall of 2016, we need all the political humor we can get! We will be examining comedians and cartoonist who are noted for their comments on politics beginning with court jesters and going from there to political cartoonists. We will then feature comedians who have actually run for President such as Gracie Allen, Pat Paulson, and Dick Gregory. Our next focus will be on individual comedians such as Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Michael Loftus, and Trevor Noah. We will view samples of their work and discuss how they may be influencing the current political scene.Â\n\nInstructor: Tom Neufer Emswiler is a retired United Methodist minister and author or co-author of ten books. He has always been a student of humor and has taught several humor courses at OLLI including “Laugh Louder, Live Longer: the Healing Power of Humor” and “Humor as a Spur to Creativity” - which have received high marks for originality and the variety of examples shown. One of Tom’s majors as an undergraduate was Political Science and he has maintained a keen interest in it all his life.\n\nPutin 3.0: A Resurgent Russia in a Dangerous World\n\nRichard Tempest\n\nThursday, 1:30-3:00; September 15 through November 3\n\nVladimir Putin’s election to a third term as Russia’s president in 2012 was followed by fundamental policy shifts that strengthened his hold on power and re-invigorated his charismatic appeal. The Putin government’s economic compact with the Russian population was replaced by a nationalist one: with an economy that could no longer guarantee ever-rising living standards, Russia adopted a revanchist and irredentist posture that led to the annexation of the Crimea (2014), armed intervention in eastern Ukraine and the shoot down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (2014), and military involvement in the Syrian civil war (2015). It now positions itself as a “Eurasian” power and seeks to create an anti-Western alliance that would include China, the Shia forces in the Middle East, and assorted authoritarian regimes. At home these moves have been accompanied by a barrage of flamboyantly pro-Putin propaganda, the suppression of civil society, and the jailing of opposition activists. This course will look at Putin’s short- and long-term prospects during his “autumn of the patriarch,\" examine the manner in which his public image and leadership style have evolved, discuss possible scenarios for the succession, and assess the outlook for Russia’s relationship with the United States, the European Union, NATO, and China in an increasingly volatile and perilous international situation.\n\nInstructor: Richard Tempest is the Acting Head of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Illinois and a former Director of the University’s Russian, East European and Eurasian Center (2007-2012). He holds a B.A. and M.A. in Philosophy and Modern Languages, and a Ph.D. in Modern History, all from the University of Oxford. He is currently working on a book-length study of charismatic and non-charismatic leadership across the cultures, with special emphasis on Vladimir Putin and other political and public figures in the post-communist world. His OLLI courses on Putin and leadership have been among the most popular and well-received offerings of recent semesters.\n\nFILM STUDIES\n\nThe Films of Warren Beatty\n\nChuck Koplinski\n\nWednesday, 5:30-8:30; September 14 through November 2\n\nOne of the most enigmatic filmmakers of our time, Warren Beatty is perhaps the most reluctant movie star of the 20th Century. Realizing he was floundering after taking Hollywood by storm in the early 1960’s, the actor took control of his career by tinkering with his screen persona and producing his own movies before stepping behind the camera to direct.Â In the process, he helped revolutionize the way American films were made and contributed to the end of the studio system while amassing an eclectic filmography consisting of both groundbreaking works and devastating failures.Â This course will look at the key films in Beatty’s career as well as the way in which his personal and professional lives have collided both on and off the screen. Films will include Bonnie and Clyde, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Parallax View, Shampoo, Heaven Can Wait, Dick Tracy, Love Affair, and Bulworth.\n\nInstructor: Chuck Koplinski has been a film critic for over 20 years, writing for various independent newspapers in the community.Â He currently reviews films for the News-Gazette, the Illinois Times, WCIA-TV and MIX 94.5 FM.Â A member of the Broadcast Film Critics Association and the Chicago Film Critics Association, he’s an annual presenter at the Embarras Valley Film Festival as well as a frequent collaborator with the American History Teachers Collaborative. He has taught six previous OLLI courses, which have received four-star reviews for their sharp insights and well-chosen films.\n\nHitchcock: The Overlooked or Under-Appreciated Films\n\nConnie Hosier\n\nMonday, 3:30-6:30; September 12 through October 31\n\nNearly anyone can list famous Hitchcock movies such as Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo, and The Birds. But how many of the director’s earlier works come to mind? The film career of the master of suspense began during the height of the silent era and as sound was just being introduced. Many of Hitch’s early features are virtually unknown to the general public, but those films demonstrate that he already was fascinated with themes that would define his later career, including stories of women in peril. Hitchcock’s imperiled women characters have often been seen as victims, and too often their intelligence, resilience, and resourcefulness have been dismissed. This course is a brief introduction to some of the Hitchcock canon â and characters â that can fall under the radar but still are fine examples of film as art. Films will include Blackmail, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Lifeboat, Spellbound, and Notorious. And earlier version of this course was offered in spring 2013.\n\nInstructor: After receiving an M.A. in Language and Literature from Columbia University, Connie Hosier taught in the NYC public school system, then moved to Arizona, again teaching at-risk students, then on to Champaign and Parkland College, where the courses she taught included film studies. Retired for over a decade, she now reviews movies for our local community radio, WEFT 90.1 FM, and continues her love of teaching film classes at OLLI â where students regularly hail her well-structured, meticulously prepared courses.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Eighth Judicial Circuit: Lincoln’s Base for His Twin Careers, Law and Politics\n\nGuy Fraker\n\nThursday, 9:00-10:30; CHANGE: The course will begin on September 15 and end on November 3, for 8 consecutive sessions. There will be class on September 29.\n\nAbraham Lincoln practiced law on the Eighth Judicial Circuit (including Champaign County) from 1837 until his nomination for the presidency in May 1860. This course will address important aspects of Abraham Lincoln’s life and career, including the pivotal role that the Eighth Judicial Circuit had on molding his sense of legal practice and justice. It will include an overview of the geography and early history of the circuit, the birth of the Republican Party in Illinois, and Lincoln’s political rise and its effects on the circuit. This course has been offered twice at OLLI, most recently in spring 2014; it is suitable for both new and returning students.\n\nInstructor: Guy C. Fraker, an attorney in Bloomington, Illinois, has written extensively and lectures frequently on the Eighth Circuit. He was the consultant on the award-winning PBS documentary, Lincoln, Prelude to the Presidency, and co-curated Prologue to the Presidency: Abraham Lincoln on the Illinois Eighth Judicial Circuit, a traveling exhibit also on permanent display at the David Davis Mansion, a state historic site in Bloomington. He served as an advisor to the National Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, and he is currently Chairman of the Board of Looking for Lincoln, an action arm of the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, created by Congress in 2009. A graduate of the University of Illinois College of Law, he is a past president of the McLean County Bar Association. His bestselling book, Lincoln's Ladder to the Presidency: The Eighth Judicial Circuit, was published in October 2012 and is now in its third printing. He is writing a guidebook of the Eighth Judicial Circuit that is scheduled for release in fall 2017. He has taught numerous popular OLLI courses on Lincoln’s career, with student evaluations calling the classes “entertaining, informative, and inspiring.”\n\nEndgame 1864-65: The Civil War in the West and Deep South\n\nFred Christensen\n\nWednesday, 1:30-3:00; September 14 through November 2\n\nThis course will examine the Civil War’s final year in those areas where the main armies did not go.Â The Deep Southâthe “Cotton Kingdom” of Alabama, eastern Mississippi, and western Georgiaâwas the heartland of the Southern way of life and the plantation economy, between the Mississippi River to the west (patrolled by Union gunboats), Sherman’s armies to the east (advancing on Atlanta and beyond), and Farragut’s fleets in the Gulf of Mexico. This was the South’s last reservoir of agricultural and industrial goods, increasingly cut off from the rest of the Confederacy and defended by defiant small armies. West of the great river, Missouri was held by Union garrisons but wracked by vicious guerrilla warfare. The class will emphasize social, cultural, and economic factors as well as military events, to portray the end of a way of life for black and white Southerners.Â Although Grant, Lee, and Sherman didn’t operate here, others did: Forrest, Price, Farragut, Rosecrans, William Quantrill, “Wild Bill” Hickok, and Jesse James.\n\nInstructor: Fred Christensen is a former history instructor at the University of Kentucky and assistant professor of military science at the University of Illinois. He teaches noncredit classes for OLLI, Parkland College, and other venues, in five areas of history and archaeology: Britain, Germany, early America, Israel/the Holy Land, and military history in general.Â His many OLLI courses have received strong evaluations, with one representative review noting his most recent course’s “combination of historical clarity and visual vividness.”\n\nIllinois at 150: Celebrating the U of I Sesquicentennial\n\nJoe Rank and Ryan Ross\n\nWednesday, 9:00-10:30; September 14 through November 2\n\nThe University of Illinois was the product of a revolution in American life. The industrial revolution and rapid advances in science in the 19th century created the need for a new kind of university that would transcend the classics model to embrace professional and utilitarian education to meet the needs of society at large. In the intervening 150 years, additional revolutions prompted by wars, prosperity, hard times, scientific discovery, and globalization have continued to shape our University. This course will focus on its fascinating history, traditions, and culture and preview the new Campus Welcome Center slated to open in fall 2017 at the Alice Campbell Alumni Center.\n\nInstructors: Joe Rank, retired vice president and historian at the University of Illinois Alumni Association, is an Urbana native who earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Advertising in the UI College of Media. A 20-year career naval officer, he served as assistant professor of naval science at Illinois, where he was named to the list of excellent instructors. Following his Navy career, he joined the staff of the Alumni Association. His keen interest in University of Illinois history and traditions led him to propose the development of a campus Welcome Center to open at the Alice Campbell Alumni Center in conjunction with the university’s 2017 sesquicentennial celebration. This is his first OLLI course.\n\nRyan Ross (Coordinator, History and Traditions Program, U of I Alumni Association) is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a B.A. in English who also holds a M.S. degree from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science. Prior to joining the Alumni Association staff in 2015, he was an archivist and researcher at the University of Illinois Foundation and at the University Library, where he created 2012 exhibits celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Land Grant Act displayed in the Main Quad buildings. This is his first OLLI course.\n\nThe Pacific War\n\nJohn McCord\n\nTuesday, 3:15-4:45; September 13 through November 1\n\nOn December 7th, 1941 the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.Â The war that followed was unlike any fought before.Â It was a separate war whose relation to the overall era was mostly limited to resource allocation.Â Its causes were unrelated either to the European conflict or the causes of that conflict.Â This course will look at the war in the Pacific as both a separate conflict without direct relation to the events in Europe and as a strategic dilemma for the U.S. by virtue of its concurrent commitments in Europe.Â It will look at the unique strategic problems, tactics, and psychology which set this war apart.\n\nInstructor: From 1990 to 1993, John McCord was in charge of the Navy and Marine Corps planning and implementation of the Panama Canal Treaties for the turnover of U.S. installations and relocation or closure of our various activities. He has served as an instructor at the U.S. Naval Officer Candidate School at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Rhode Island, teaching Administration, Military Law, Naval Warfare and Tactics, and Seamanship/ He holds a B.S. in history from the United States Naval Academy and a law degree from the University of Illinois College of Law. His previous OLLI course on the Panama Canal received enthusiastic evaluations for his many useful illustrations and examples.\n\nGerman Resistance against Hitler within the Third Reich 1933-1945\n\nKarl-Heinz Schoeps\n\nMonday, 3:30-6:30; September 12 through October 31 (this course will run for the full allotted time on selected dates when a film is shown, but will end earlier on other dates)\n\nEven some 70 years after the end of the Third Reich not much is widely known about the resistance against Hitler and the Nazi-regime within the Third Reich - except for some expert specialists. This is especially true for the United States. How many people in this country have heard, for example, of Georg Elser, Herbert Baum, Martin NiemÃ¶ller, Mildred Harnack, Kurt Huber, Hans Oster, or Henning von Treschkow? There were indeed numerous resistance organizations and many attempts on Hitler’s life; alas none were successful. In this course we will discuss some of the groups and individuals who resisted and more often than not paid for it with their lives. There will be presentations, discussions, and films. Class sessions will meet for the full time period on some dates when films are shown in their entirety; other sessions will be shorter. This course was offered in spring 2015, with very strong evaluations for the instructor’s deep knowledge of the subject; the course is intended primarily for new students.\n\nInstructor: Karl-Heinz Schoeps is a retired professor of German at the University of Illinois where he taught German cultural history and German literature of the 20th century, including courses on the playwright Bertolt Brecht, literature within the Third Reich, and East German (DDR-GDR) literature. He has published numerous books and articles on these subjects, including three books on Bertolt Brecht and two books on literature and film in the Third Reich.\n\nLAW AND GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Modern United States Presidency - CANCELLED\n\nRobert F. Rich\n\nRare Books, Crime, and Punishment - CANCELLED\n\nTravis McDade\n\nLITERATURE AND STORYTELLING\n\nAmerican Folklore\n\nKathleen Brinkmann and Dan Keding\n\nTuesday, 1:30-3:00; September 13 through November 1\n\nTake a journey into American folklore and see the United States through the lenses of stories, ballads, and superstitions. Hear regional folktales from the Appalachia, New England, southern states, the Midwest, and the Wild West told by storytellers Dan Keding and Kath Brinkmann. Learn about superstitions, home remedies, proverbs, and riddles across our country. Folk songs and dances will be experienced through multimedia sources.\n\nInstructors: Kath Brinkmann has co-taught three storytelling classes at OLLI to enthusiastic participants and has been a guest lecturer at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS). She holds a master’s degree in Folktales and Storytelling from the University of Illinois at Springfield. Her book, The Gift of the Unicorn and Other Animal Helper Tales, co-authored with Dan Keding will be published in June 2016. As a founding member of the CU Storytelling Guild, she performs locally as well as regionally in the Midwest.\n\nDan Keding is an adjunct lecturer at GSLIS and a professional storyteller and musician. He has performed at some of the most prestigious story events in the world including the National Storytelling Festival (USA); the Cape Clear Storytelling Festival (Ireland); the Festival at the Edge (England); and the Winnipeg International Storytelling Festival (Canada). He has authored six books and recorded over a dozen CDs. He was inducted into the Circle of Excellence of the National Storytelling Network in 2000.\n\nCharlotte BrontÃ«’s Jane Eyre - CANCELLED\n\nBao Bui\n\nCrime and Judgment in Film and TV: Detection, Then Courtroom Drama\n\nJohn Frayne\n\nFriday, 1:30-4:30; September 16 through November 4\n\nFamous detective series, whether in novel or film, specialize in finding the guilty person, but such stories generally stop at the doors of the courthouse. There, another drama begins with a battle of wits and experience between defense and prosecution. In mystery stories, the detective is to some degree convinced of the guilt of the suspect. In legal dramas, the defense offers the best case for the accused. This course will offer balance and contrast between the detective story and the courtroom drama, watching and discussing examples of both. Screenings will include Garrow’s Law, Rumpole of the Bailey, Kavanagh, Q.C., Sad Cypresses, A Certain Justice, Witness for the Prosecution, and Dial M for Murder.\n\nInstructor: John Frayne was from 1965 to 1997 Professor of English, Comparative Literature, and Film Studies at UIUC, and is now an Emeritus Professor. He specialized in Modern British Literature and Film Studies. From 1985 to present, he has been radio host on Saturdays (formerly also on Sundays) at radio station WILL-FM, where he hosts “Classics of the Phonograph” and Opera Broadcasts. Since 2000, he has been classical music critic for the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette. In recent years, he has volunteered at the Champaign Public Library FriendShop, serving on the Board and the FriendShop committee. His OLLI courses over the years have been hailed for their insightful treatment of topics from literature and film to classical music.\n\nFrance and Islam: Identity and Otherness in Literature\n\nNancy Blake\n\nThursday, 3:15-4:45; September 15 through November 3\n\nSince its medieval beginnings the French nation has defined itself in opposition to the Muslim world.Â We will begin by considering the foundational epic poem The Song of Roland in the context of the Crusades, which did so much to set the stage for today’s conflicts.Â We will next examine the use that Enlightenment philosophers made of Islam as a backdrop to defining the values of the Modern State, which would prepare the Revolutions in America and in France.Â Next we will look at the concept of Orientalism which has its origins in Napoleon’s project of understanding Egypt through invasion, and which flowers in The Romantic movement’s love of the Exotic. When we get to the Twentieth Century, Existential philosophy again seizes the figure of the Arab in order to define the human condition.Â Finally, in the 21st century Francophone North-African authors have written back to the French literary canon with their versions of the story. Â We will look at the work of a man and finally that of a woman from North Africa, both writing in French.Â For whom are they writing? That will be just one of the questions we are asking.\n\nInstructor: Professor Nancy Blake received doctorates in French and in English literature from the University of Paris, and specializes in comparative and world literature. She is also a trained psychoanalyst now on the faculty of the University of Illinois Comparative Literature Program. She has taught several successful OLLI courses on a variety of topics, with students regularly citing the scholarly rigor and skillful presentation of complex materials.\n\nA Poetry of Violence and Enchantment: W.B. Yeats\n\nVicki Mahaffey\n\nWednesday, 11:00-12:30; September 14 through November 2\n\nIn a disenchanted age, it is important to consider the unexpectedly ethical potential of enchanted moments. In this course, we will look at enchantment as a moment of wonder that can trigger ethical responses; as a musical metaphor (enchantment comes from the French “chanter,” to sing); and as a figure for national paralysis or colonization in Ireland. We will trace how magic gives way to violence as the main impetus behind Yeats’s poems, ending with his magnificent rage against old age. Each class will begin with relevant background material followed by a detailed examination of 5-10 poems.\n\nInstructor: Vicki Mahaffey, Clayton and Thelma Kirkpatrick Professor of English and Gender and Women’s Studies at the University of Illinois, has taught at Illinois since 2008. She is the author of three books--Reauthorizing Joyce (Cambridge); States of Desire: Wilde, Yeats, Joyce and the Irish Experiment (Oxford), and Modernist Literature: Challenging Fictions (Blackwell)âand she has edited a collection of essays on Joyce’s Dubliners, Collaborative Dubliners: Joyce in Dialogue (Syracuse University Press). She has received several teaching awards and is a Guggenheim fellow. She is an elected member of the Board of Trustees of the James Joyce Foundation and serves on the advisory boards of the James Joyce Quarterly and Joyce Studies Annual. She lectures on Irish literature all over the world, and has been featured on the BBC, the RTE, and Australian public radio. Her OLLI courses have been among the most popular and enthusiastically-reviewed offerings of recent semesters, with students noting the academic excellence and exceptional instruction of both courses.\n\nMEDICINE\n\nOne Health: People, Animals, and the Environment\n\nWanda Haschek-Hock\n\nThursday, 9:00-10:30; September 15 through November 3\n\nThis course describes the interconnectedness of people, animals and the environment in the health arena. While this concept has existed for centuries going back to Hippocrates in 400 BC, it has recently gained momentum because of the continuing increase in the human population, geographic expansion of people into wild animal habitats, ease of global travel, climate change, environmental contamination, etc. It is estimated that at least 75% of emerging and re-emerging diseases are either zoonotic (spread between humans and animals) or vector-borne (carried from infected animals to others through insects). Zoonotic diseases include roundworms, tuberculosis, influenza, rabies and toxoplasmosis. Recent examples of emerging/remerging diseases are Zika virus and Ebola virus.\n\nInstructor: Wanda Haschek-Hock, a veterinary pathologist and Professor Emerita at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine, has over 30 years of experience in comparative pathology. She received her BVSc (DVM equivalent) from the University of Sydney and her Ph.D. from Cornell University. She then held an appointment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before taking a position at the University of Illinois in 1982. Her appointment included teaching professional and graduate students, research, and service. Wanda has over 100 scientific publications and is senior editor of the Handbook of Toxicologic Pathology and Fundamentals of Toxicologic Pathology published by Elsevier. This is her first OLLI course.\n\nPlague du Jour\n\nJames G.

The oldest living inhabitants of Earth, microbes have been around for over 3.5 billion years. They have colonized and adapted to all sorts of environments, including our human bodies; although we are largely unaware of them, microbial cells in our own bodies outnumber human cells by 10 to 1. They are largely responsible for fashioning the environment and play critical roles in health and disease. In this course we will look at microbes as they relate to the human experience. Who are our microbial enemies? Who are our microbial friends? Given the recent, and powerful, advances in molecular biology and our deeper understanding of our microbial companions, how can we harness the power of microbes to solve issues related to health and the environment?\n\nInstructor: Claudia Reich holds a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

It was developed as a holistic art for nurturing a healthy mind, body and spirit. Over the millennia it has evolved into a wide variety of forms, which have played important roles - spiritual, social, political, military and medicalâ in Chinese cultural history. The practice of taijiquan, more commonly known in the West as tai chi, is a relatively new application of the principles of qigong to the purpose of martial arts. Tai chi was created as an internal martial art in the 17th century, and has since flourished as a general health practice as it is practicable for people of all ages and physical abilities. Each of the 8 sessions will be structured to provide an overview and acquaint students with the principles and practices of tai chi and qigong. This course is intended for students who have not taken tai chi at OLLI in the past.\n\nInstructor: Mike Reed has been studying and practicing Tai Chi and Qigong since 1998. He has shared his experience and understanding for the past 16 years with local students at OLLI, at the Savoy Recreation Center, and with research participants at the U of I and in a variety of other settings.\n\nWRITING\n\nConsider the Object: Writing Memoir through Objects\n\nGale Renee Walden\n\nWednesday, 9:00-10:30; September 14 through November 2\n\nWhat are these things we live with?Â Why is my grandfather’s cow creamer with a bell still in my dining room hutch when I am lactose intolerant and haven’t used it for years?Â Why have I moved it with me from Arizona to Boston to Urbana when I don’t really like it that much?Â Why don’t I get rid of it?Â Is there a forgotten memory attached?Â Is this anything I want to pass on to anyone else or do I just want to find the memory and pass that on? How exactly does this cow creamer fit into my life? This course will entail considering objects in our lives and our attachments to them, writing about this in order to construct a larger life story. Each student will be asked to bring in at least three objects to consider during the first three weeks of the class (or pictures of those objects that are too big to transport), and we will think and write about those objects. The course will include in-class writing exercises, and invites both experienced and new writers to participate. The primary purpose of this course is to record more about your story through a specific focus.Â If it works as it should, your understanding of the object, and perhaps other things, should also change within the eight weeks."
