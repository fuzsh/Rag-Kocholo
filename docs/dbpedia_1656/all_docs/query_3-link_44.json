        "text": "Below you'll find our list — compiled following lively debate by Powell's staff — of 25 women writers you absolutely must read in your lifetime.\n\nIn one sense, singling out a small group of female writers as eminently worthy of attention feels like an injustice to a gender who has published an immeasurable amount of profound, enduring literature. At the same time, recognizing great female authors is an exercise we here at Powell's are dedicated to undertaking again and again — emphatically, enthusiastically, unapologetically.\n\nAnd so we present to you 25 female authors we admire for their vision, their fearlessness, their originality, and their impact on the literary world and beyond. To get you started, we've included a book recommendation for each author."
