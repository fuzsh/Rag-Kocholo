        "text": "Full List\n\nWriters Guilds of America West (WGAW) and Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) members voted to determine WGA’s 101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (*so far). Announced on December 6, 2021, the list’s noted writing credits are based on that date\n\nList entries written by Paul Brownfield, Dylan Callaghan, Peter Hanson, and Lisa Rosen.\n\n1 Get Out (2017)\n\nWritten by Jordan Peele\n\n“I realized early in the writing that Get Out is so much more than simply what happens when you have a black male protagonist at the center of a horror film,” Jordan Peele told Written By. Get Out, which won the 2018 Writers Guild Award for Original Screenplay...\n\n2 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nWritten by Charlie Kaufman, Story by Charlie Kaufman & Michel Gondry & Pierre Bismut\n\nThe germ of the idea came from conceptual artist Pierre Bismuth, via director Michel Gondry: What if you sent postcards to people informing them they’d been erased from someone’s memory? How would they react? Charlie Kaufman’s narrative...\n\n3 The Social Network (2010)\n\nScreenplay by Aaron Sorkin, Based Upon the Book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich\n\nWe begin the story of the decline of Western civilization with a Harvard sophomore who suffers from an acute case of logorrhea returning to his dorm room after a bad date. Blowing off steam with a light bit of hacking, he soon creates a platform to rate coeds called FaceMash...\n\n4 Parasite (2019)\n\nScreenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin Won, Story by Bong Joon Ho\n\nIn Bong Joon Ho’s dark satire, the yuppie Park family lives in architectural splendor in the hills about Seoul. The scrappy Kims fold pizza boxes in a subterranean apartment prone to flooding. When one of the Kims begins tutoring one of the Parks...\n\n5 No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nWritten for the Screen by Joel Coen & Ethan Coen, Based on the Novel by Cormac McCarthy\n\nSet on the plains of West Texas, the Coens’ screenplay, winner of the 2008 Writers Guild Award for Adapted Screenplay, is a master class in the power of the unsaid on the page. In place of words are cryptic, existential musings and brief encounters...\n\n6 Moonlight (2016)\n\nScreenplay by Barry Jenkins, Story by Tarell Alvin McCraney\n\nBarry Jenkins’ 2017 Oscar- and Writers Guild Award-winning screenplay, divided into three, equally compelling coming-of-age chapters in the life of a young Black man in Miami, is an adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney’s unpublished play...\n\n7 There Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nScreenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson, Based on the Novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson’s epic, turn-of-the-century, neo-historical tale of oil baron Daniel Plainview feels as essential to understanding the DNA of California as Robert Towne’s Chinatown. Anderson told interviewer Henry Rollins that he began writing...\n\n8 Inglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nWritten by Quentin Tarantino\n\nQuentin Tarantino wrote the story years before revisiting it as a script, he told Filmmaker magazine. “I thought, Okay, maybe I could do it as a miniseries, but let me try to tame this, to make it into a movie.” Tarantino’s World War II characters...\n\n9 Almost Famous (2000)\n\nWritten by Cameron Crowe\n\nThe quintessential rock ’n’ roll coming-of-age film is based on Cameron Crowe’s experiences as a 17-year-old correspondent for Rolling Stone. In reliving his home and road life, Crowe captures both the times and his heady place in it with heartfelt aplomb...\n\n10 Memento (2000)\n\nScreenplay by Christopher Nolan, Based on the Short Story by Jonathan Nolan\n\nIn an old YouTube video, Christopher Nolan stands at a chalkboard and diagrams the plot of his film for an interviewer. He explains where the “backward” narrative structure goes, alongside co-existing timelines told from objective and subjective points of view...\n\n11 Adaptation (2002)\n\nScreenplay by Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman, Based on the Book The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean\n\nCharlie Kaufman shared screenplay credit with his imaginary identical twin brother: Have we mentioned that Adaptation is a painfully funny illustration of writer’s block? In the script, the fake Kaufman brother pitches a serial killer script, while the “real” Kaufman...\n\n12 Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nWritten by Annie Mumolo & Kristen Wiig\n\nAt long last, Hollywood was inclined to believe that a studio comedy fronted by female characters who were not in active pursuit of a man and not trying desperately to have a baby could work. The screenplay, presumably minus the infamous bridal dress sequence...\n\n13 Brokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nScreenplay by Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana, Based on the Short Story by Annie Proulx\n\n“They were raised on small, poor ranches in opposite corners of the state.” So begins Annie Proulx’s 1997 New Yorker short story, set in Montana, about modern-day cowboy lovers Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar. In an interview with the American Film Institute...\n\n14 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)\n\nWritten by Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson\n\nThree child prodigies; a father, Royal, devoted to dissipation; and a memoirist/archeologist mother, Etheline—these are the broken pieces of the family Tenenbaum. The movie, a kind of comic novel in the visual language of film...\n\n15 Sideways (2004)\n\nScreenplay by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor, Based on the Novel by Rex Pickett\n\nThe story of two friends on a road trip through wine country is also an examination of the male ego in crisis. Miles is a broken-hearted unpublished novelist and wine connoisseur, Jack is a washed-up actor, living off the fumes of a career in daytime soaps...\n\n16 Lady Bird (2017)\n\nWritten by Greta Gerwig\n\n“I let all of these characters talk to me, and talk to each other. I overwrite,” Greta Gerwig told Written By of the genesis of her screenplay for Lady Bird, about 17-year-old Sacramento Catholic schoolgirl Christine McPherson, aka “Lady Bird...\n\n17 Her (2013)\n\nWritten by Spike Jonze\n\n“There’s definitely ways that technology brings us closer and ways that it makes us further apart—and that’s not what this movie is about,” Spike Jonze told The New York Times about the film that won the 2014 Writers Guild Award for Original Screenplay...\n\n18 Children of Men (2006)\n\nScreenplay by Alfonso Cuarón & Timothy J. Sexton and David Arata and Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby, Based on the Novel The Children of Men by P.D. James\n\nSome of the most celebrated shows in the so-called “bleak TV” era (The Handmaid’s Tale, The Leftovers, The Walking Dead) seem to owe a debt to Children of Men. Co-screenwriter Timothy Sexton told Colorado Public Radio that it was the post-9/11 zeitgeist...\n\n19 Lost in Translation (2003)\n\nWritten by Sofia Coppola\n\nArguably the best role ever written for Bill Murray, in terms of capturing his ineffable qualities—the goofball, the empath, the ironist.
