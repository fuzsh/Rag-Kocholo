        "text": "The 70s have changed the way we play music. The evolution of music is a complex topic, and it’s necessary to look as far back as the 1970s to see how things have changed. What was once very one-sided has now turned into an all-out musical revolution! Take a look at some interesting lingo about this period in time and how it’s been so influential on modern musicians.\n\nThe Emerging Rock Scene\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of some new music genres that have become staples of the modern era. Punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal, and soft rock all had their origins in these ten years. While these genres are still around today, they are very different from what was being created decades ago. Artists like Billy Joel have inspired many musicians, pianists especially. With the help of available sheet music for Piano Man, young musicians could pick up a new skill and share their talents with the world. Rock music also pays homage today to artists like Queen, who were able to reach a wide variety of music fans with their orchestral kind of sound. While rock artists were cultivating new melodies and rhythms, musicians were experimenting with jamming all together into one band. What we know today as the rock band was created these ten years. Closely associated with heavy metal and hard rock, the band was a new kind of musical ensemble that involved multiple musicians working together to produce a unique and unified sound.\n\n70s Jazz\n\nIn addition to rock, jazz music also received some fame in the 1970s. The classic jazz band, led by John Coltrane, debuted its first studio album in 1968 titled “A Love Supreme”. Jazz would later spread throughout Europe thanks to artists like Miles Davis and Chet Baker, who toured across Europe and produced albums like “Kind of Blue” and “Chet is Back!” that reached many ears. Jazz also became well known in Japan and continued to influence musicians worldwide for the rest of the decade. 70s jazz is also highly influenced by instruments such as the electric piano, Moog synthesizer, and tubular bells, which were used in jazz music even today. 70s jazz also had some popularity in disco clubs, where more of 70s jazz-funk sound influenced dance music artists.\n\nThe Birth Of Hip-Hop\n\nThe 1970s gave rise to a new genre called hip hop, which was influenced by disco music. DJs would find a way to speed up old songs, so they could create a new kind of dance party sound. It wasn’t until 1979 when people were able to buy their copies of records, so they could play this modified version themselves. Shortly after, other artists experimented with other genres, from rock n’ roll classics to soulful R&B vocals found in Marvin Gaye’s hit song “Got To Give It Up”. Hip hop in the 70s became a staple of pop culture and continues to be an influential aspect of our music scene today.\n\nGreatest Hits From The 70s\n\nIn the 70s, the classic rock band was born. Steve Miller, Queen, Marvin Gaye, and even ABBA all contributed to our current music scene with their unique sounds that have stood the test of time. This decade also gave rise to hip hop, which was created by DJs who would speed up old songs, so they could play them at parties. Greatest hits include songs like “Born to Run” by Bruce Springsteen, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” by Queen, “Got to Give it Up” by Marvin Gaye, and “FM” by Steely Dan.\n\nMusic As Art And Business\n\nThe 1970s did not only witness the emergence of new genres of music, but also a shift in how it is presented to audiences. During this decade, the record store was the dominant way to get your hands on albums and cassettes. They were highly prized for their ability to be played on compact disc players that would later become popular. Record stores are still around today, though more likely as online shops rather than physical locations. This change in a presentation led to an important development in musical artistry: promotional concerts known as “record releases”. Companies often threw big parties for bands who had just finished recording an album. It allowed them to show what they had been working on and give the public a chance to hear it before its release date, thus getting publicity for their work.\n\nHow The 70s Changed Music\n\nThe 70s have changed the way we play music. The evolution of music is a complex topic, and it’s necessary to look back to the 1970s to see how things have changed. What was once very one-sided has now turned into an all-out musical revolution! Bands like The Beatles brought about a new kind of sound that involved multiple members working together to produce a unique sound. Also, genres like punk rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can all thank their origins to this decade. This decade saw the formation of many music genres that are still popular today. These bands are also famous for their involvement with modern musical equipment like synthesizers and guitars. The evolution of music is certainly a complicated topic that requires some thorough research on the part of musicians new and old. Without knowledge of this period, it’s difficult to keep up with the latest kinds of music being produced by professional artists like Kenny G or The Jackson 5ive, who all had their start in these ten years."
