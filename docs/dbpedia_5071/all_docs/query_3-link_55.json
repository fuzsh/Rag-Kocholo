        "text": "The 2000's continued many of the trends that emerged in the mid and late 1990's. Hip hop music had taken the place of rock music and the pop world of music was primarily controlled by major brand executives that were building groups using formulas created in the 1990s. In Pop music you saw a blended sound of rock, pop, hip hop and country music as artists like Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson take center stage next to many of the popular groups of the 1990s.\n\nBy the end of the 2000's Pop music was so broad that country music had grown in popularity throughout the United States thanks to artists like Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood that gained popularity with a new more mainstream sound, exposure using the internet and television programming and aggressive marketing to the youth markets.\n\nMany artist experimented with various genres throughout the 2000's and some like Taylor Swift successfully made the transition. Another example of this was Alternative artist Darius Rucker who left his band Hootie and the Blowfish to begin a solo career in country music. For those artists that still could not find a genre that fit, Emo filled that void with bands like Dashboard Confessionals and Fall Out Boys.\n\nBut, by far the most successful genre in music in the 2000's was hip hop with revolutionary artists like Kanye West and Eminem redefining the industry and infusing a sound and a message many of the youth and young professional could relate to. The Hip Hop industry would continue to thrive throughout the 2000's and become increasingly mainstream. By the time the 2010's arrived hip hop music was the most popular form of music in America.\n\nThe years from 2001 to 2006 were defined by collaborations against type and regional stars finally reaching the mainstream. Kanye West led the charge, rapping about both social issues and material success with a flow that redeemed the oft-maligned Mason Betha, and doing so with the co-sign of Jay-Z and Common. Itâ€™s easy to see his wide range of customers and collaborators as a result of his hunger: the Kanye we know would understand that the road to stardom is paved with production credits for Made Men album cuts and uncredited Nas loosies. But his pragmatism framed all of hip-hop as a continuum, and his ability to tailor his style to everyone from Trina to Consequence displayed common ground between previously unthinkable realms of rap.
