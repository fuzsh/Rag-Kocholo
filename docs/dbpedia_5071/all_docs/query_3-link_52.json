        "text": "Some of the greatest bands and singers have hit the stage over the last 20 years. Green Day, Fall Out Boy, Amy Winehouse, Beyoncé, OutKast, Sam Smith, Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, Arcade Fire, Nirvana, TLC and Kanye West all have provided excellent examples of what music is supposed to accomplish: unite people from all over the world using lyrics, rhythms, harmonies and melodies.\n\nBut music and lyrics are an especially poignant look at a culture at any given time. Lyrics in particular represent the general societal values and views of the time. Events that cause someone to have an emotional response usually are what inspire the lyrics to some of the most popular songs. Since people in the same generation experience similar events within their lifetimes, song lyrics tend to follow certain trends based on the decade that they are written in.\n\nInspired\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of grunge and alternative music both in pop and rock, whereas the early 2000s had more emotional undertones, dealing with themes like life after 9/11 and loss. According to a 2014 study done by the A.V. Club, most ’90s songs involve “loss, inspiration” and “escapism,” whereas songs of the 2000’s are about “inspiration, pain” and “desperation.”\n\nThink about how true this is. Take Coolio’s 1995 song “Gangsta’s Paradise” for example. The opening line of the song talks about how Coolio is looking at his life so far and seeing how much he has lost.\n\n“As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realize there’s nothin’ left,” Coolio raps, “’Cause I’ve been blasting and laughing so long,/That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone.”\n\nHe tries to give warning to other people in similar situations in order to inspire them to watch their actions.\n\nAnother example of ’90s lyrical trends is in Cher’s 1998 “Believe.” This song in particular deals with the theme of loss (in this case, loss of love). Throughout the song, Cher is wondering if she should go back to her former lover or if she should move on.\n\nFinding the light\n\nThen at the turn of the millennium, inspiration became a key theme of songs in the early 2000s, which some associate with the swirling emotions of post-9/11 life.\n\nU2’s song “Beautiful Day” is an example of positivity. Even though it was released a year before the events of 9/11, it conveys the inspirational message of looking on the bright side of each day. By the end of 2001, it had the 75th spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nGoing back to Cher for a moment, her powerful 2002 “Song for the Lonely” was dedicated to all of those who were involved in or affected by 9/11. The song did not get very high on the charts, but it does provide an example of artists using their music to inspire others in times of need.\n\nOne of the best examples of life in the early 2000s is Green Day’s iconic 2004 album “American Idiot.” The punk rock opera concept album tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia and life after 9/11, but it’s also emblematic of teenage life in the suburbs and the disillusionment of a generation, especially one sending people to war.\n\nThe 2000s also saw the rise in popularity of emo pop punk bands. Bands such as the All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Jimmy Eat World, Paramore and My Chemical Romance emerged into the mainstream with their honest and outgoing lyrics. Songs like “Move Along” and “The Middle” spoke to a generation of teens who were struggling to express emotions of disillusionment, angst, anxiety and depression.\n\nIn the now\n\nBeginning in the late 2000s to the early 2010s, songs became more about different aspects of people’s lives. Pop music took on more fun, bubbly and sometimes lighthearted qualities in stark contrast to the hard lyrics of the early millennium. Years of war and sadness forced music to go in the opposite direction, with artists singing about positivity and fun. It also marked a change in sexual exploration. For example, Katy Perry rose to prominence primarily for her song about bi-curiosity. Lady Gaga’s first big hit was about being so drunk that all she could do was dance.\n\nSome of the best songs of the past five years are about living in the now. In a recent billboard.com article, songs such as Carly Rae Jepson’s “Call Me Maybe,” Fun.’s “Some Nights,” Sia’s “Chandelier,” Nicki Minaj’s “Super Bass,” Miley Cyrus’ “We Can’t Stop” and Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams’ “Get Lucky” were included as the some of the best songs of the first half of this decade. And though each of these songs have a very different sound, they all have the same lyrical theme of living in the moment.\n\nSome, though, have different views on the lyrics of today’s pop music. Many studies point out that most of the music playing on Top 40 radio stations are about sex, drugs or alcohol, seen in songs like “Tik Tok,” “Blurred Lines,” and “Blame it on the Alcohol.”\n\nMusic has changed a lot since 1995. Whether it’s in the way people listen to it or discover new music or the way that it is expressed, music today is dramatically different from the music of 20 years ago.\n\nAt the heart of it, lyrics, and really music as a whole, are the embodiment of what life was like at a particular point in time and give a glimpse into the artist’s head in a way that nothing else can. That is what makes music so special and why it has been one of the defining features of the past 20 years.\n\n— Michael Donelan is a junior at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School."
