        "text": "TECHNICALLY, and this is a bit of a stretch, it can be argued that Emo is an offshoot of Punk. Emo originally meant \"Emotive Hardcore\", such as Fugazi, and not \"Emotional Music\", which would really be any music.\n\nEmo has gone from being a more expressive, technical form of Punk to being a label used almost exclusively on whiny, poppy music that appeals to suburban teenagers, and seeing how genre labels progress with time, that would make sense.\n\nNow, as far as Green Day being Punk Rock, by the time Insomniac came out, they were no longer a pure Punk Rock act. They had drifted into alternative rock territory, and have never really come back from that. They're Pop Rock or Power Pop at current.\n\nDid they used to be a Punk Rock band? Yes. Dookie and the preceding two albums (imo, Dookie isn't even particularly \"Punk\"), were a great example of the Lookout style of bratty Pop-Punk that other bands such as Screeching Weasel and The Queers were playing.\n\nBut, to answer your question, in 1988, yes, Emo was an offshoot of Punk Rock. Today however, no. It's become a totally different genre than it once was. Look at Outlaw Country vs. the Nashville Sound. Both Country, but both totally different.\n\njust MHO but I'll be glad when emo finally bites it and those kids go back to their polo shirts and khakis\n\nEmo kids are often confused with \"Scene\" kids. They look similar, but not the same.\n\nEmo kids actually believe in what they listen to; Scene kids think everyday's a fashion show.\n\nThe Emo subculture as it stands will be around for a while longer, however the \"scene\" only has another two years. Think of it as the hair metal for the mid-late 2000s. Hair Metal got big in '84ish, Scene music (screamo/metalcore/whatever) got big in '04ish; Guys that look like girls, vapid excess, bright colors, etc.\n\nI figure, by 2011, the next \"Nevermind\" will have come out, and we can finally get past this horrible era of music and fashion.\n\nI just tried to skip over it.\n\nEmo kids are often confused with \"Scene\" kids.

The amount of artists that the average listener is aware of has exploded in the last few years due to the internet, specifically sites like youtube, myspace, etc. And so it seems it would be much harder for one of today's albums to change popular music to such a degree.\n\nTECHNICALLY, and this is a bit of a stretch, it can be argued that Emo is an offshoot of Punk.

As in from 30 second songs to 4 minute jams where there was some real playing proficiency.\n\nBy today's standards, no, Fugazi isn't Emo. But by the original definition of Emo, Fugazi was a more complex outlet for Ian MacKaye's feelings about the D.C. Scene. I'd say they'd be more supplemental to the early Emo than, say, Rites of Spring, but still, the kind of music they were playing fit stylistically with many of the early Emo bands.\n\nEmo wasn't always a dirty word. I mean, hell, Jawbreaker is even considered to be early Emo.\n\nWhat started as Hardcore with an Indie twist has become Indie with a Pop-Rock twist, aimed at whiny suburban teenagers.\n\nscene kids....emo...it doesn't matter to me I agree with Rattus... rich white kids with issues.... issues like oh no mommy took the keys to my Expedition. I know that emo came from punk, Rites of Spring and other such bands long before the modern emo pap came about but like pretty much every other scene that gets popular it gets diluted by all the people who have to be cool and jump on board. IMHO emo may have started out as part of punk but those days are long since gone and now it is just another form of pop music... how threatening to mainstream society is a kid in black pants and mascara who is afraid to do anything but whine about how sh***y life is.... too me punk is bands like The Dead Kennedy's and The Stooges and hardcore had something to do with Henry Rollins lol.... and IMHO one of the best \"punk\" albums ever was The Refused \"Shape of Punk to come\".... I remember getting that a week or so after it came out and none of the \"punk\" kids around here thought it was good but to me it was fresh and violent and fun and anti-government... which is what punk is supposed to be\n\nBTW I'm not a punk( anymore... oh the days of blue hair when I was a kid...in rural TN no less lmao) lol I just happen to like and agree with alot of the early punk ideas and energy"
