        "text": "Test your knowledge\n\nWhat is \"Emo Music\"?\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of English describes it as \"a style of rock music that developed from punk, but has more complicated musical arrangements and deals with more emotional subjects\", and that is technically right, although this definition doesn't cover everything this noun means. Everyone (me included) understands this word in a different way, which usually depends on what wave of this genre you grew up with.\n\nA Quick Summary Of The History Of Emo\n\nFirst Wave\n\nThe first wave of Emo was born in the 80's in Washington D.C, after the hardcore punk band Minor Threat broke up and their vocalist, Ian MacKaye started a new one called Embrace. This band had more complex melodies and arrangements, and the lyrics focused on feelings rather than on society, like other punk bands did.\n\nIn 1985, the term Emo-Core (Emotional-Hardcore) was born, and although not everyone liked it (Ian MacKaye once called it \"the stupidest f*****g thing Iâ€™ve ever heard in my entire life\"), it spread across the USA and soon became just Emo. Bands like Embrace, Rites of Spring and Moss Icon were the most representative of this wave.\n\nSecond Wave\n\nBy the 90's, Emo had grown a lot, but instead of going towards the mainstream (like bands like Nirvana, that had the same hardcore origin as Emo but didn't follow the steps of other emo acts), it became an alternative and DIY genre.\n\nWhile in the Northeast, bands specialised in heavy melodies and lots of screaming, the Midwest developed a whole genre of its own.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when trying to describe the new style of this wave is its twinkly guitars and math rock sound, first introduced by Mike Kinsella, who was a member of two of the most popular emo bands of that period. These bands were Cap'n Jazz (probably the most influential for future fourth wave emo acts) and American Football, whose self-titled album of 1999 was ranked 6th in the Rolling Stone list of the 40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time (a little snippet of the album).\n\nThis new sound consisting of odd time signatures and complex rhythm structures would then be heavily used in the fourth wave, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nBy received directly from the record label that holds the copyright to the image with explicit permission to use it. Link\n\nThird Wave\n\nSo the hometown of the first wave was Washington D.C., then we moved to the Midwest for the second wave, and for the third, we return to the Northeast, more specifically to the Tri-State area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut).\n\nThe twinkly guitars and complex melodies disappeared, and pop-punk reached the mainstream. Bands like Saves the Day and Taking Back Sunday became the representatives of the new, simple and catchy sound of the 2000's and made it to MTV, that served as a conductor to reach the new generations of teens all over the world.\n\nIn this moment, the genre separated into two: a \"pure\" pop-punk, lead by bands like New Found Glory; and a darker, maybe angstier genre that would still be known as Emo. While pop-punk had a more laid back, skater boy aesthetic and talked about love, friends and heartbreak, the second relied heavily on dark clothes and eyeliner, and tackled topics like suicide, mental health, loneliness, unjustice and death, taking some of the first steps towards normalizing this issues. Some of the most popular bands inside this genre are \"the Holy Trinity of Emo\": Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco, Paramore and Sleeping with Sirens among others.\n\nFourth Wave\n\nThe Emo Revival\n\nSo, eyeliners are no longer in, My Chemical Romance breaks up, both Paramore and Fall Out Boy take a really long break and Panic! at the Disco is poppier than ever. What's next for emo?\n\nIt's 2012 and Modern Baseball releases their debut album \"Sports\". They may not know it but they are about to become the architects of the fourth wave of emo. It would be unjust to just pinpoint a single band as the creator of a whole era, and I am not trying to do so. Lots of other bands before them already made a change in the emo scene, like Algernon Cadwallaver and Tigers Jaw, who practically created it; empire! empire! (I was a lonely estate); and The Hotelier. However, Modern Baseball served as an influence for a great majority of the bands that came after them with their DIY sound and creative lyrics.\n\nHere are some of the lyrics to one of their most famous songs, \"Tears over beers\":\n\nImg By Source, Link\n\nThat girl who's next to me,\n\nshe don't know her worth in this town\n\nBecause her face starts to shine\n\nwhen that meat head behind me\n\nIs grinning as he's checking her out\n\nOH COME ON\n\nI said, \"All I can hope for is for you to get better\n\nBecause all I can take is no more\n\nSo I'll hide where I can, away from you and your friends\n\nLeaking tears over beers once again.\"\n\nThe cool thing about the Emo Revival is that there isn't just one word to describe it. Weather you want a math rock-y sound like Tiny Moving Parts', dramatic lyrics over a folk punk sounding guitar like The Front Bottoms does, or a bit of both like Panucci's Pizza, this genre has you covered."
