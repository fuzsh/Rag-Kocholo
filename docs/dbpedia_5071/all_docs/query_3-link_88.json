        "text": "Because there is a lot of confusion in what really is emo and what is not, people started tagging real emo artists and artists which are not emo with the appropiate tags.\n\nEmo is music derived from punk or alternative with emotionally fraught themes and lyrics.\n\nEmo began in the middle of the 1980s as a post-hardcore subgenre in the DC hardcore scene influenced by hardcore punk bands like Bad Brains, Scream, The Faith and Minor Threat as well as early post-hardcore bands like Hüsker Dü, Gray Matter and Dag Nasty. The pioneers of emo were Rites of Spring. Then soon more emo bands came in DC and Maryland like Embrace, One Last Wish, Rain, Happy Go Licky, Moss Icon, The Hated and others. At first emo was first shortened for emotional hardcore/emotive hardcore, but Guy Picciotto from Rites of Spring didn't like the emo label. Ian MacKaye from Embrace, hated the emocore label, and once at an Embrace gig he spoke about the term. In the 1990s, the DC hardcore scene faded a little which split all the emo bands, so then emo was remade being in genres like alternative, indie and pop punk. Although Jawbreaker later became an emo band with their 2nd album with the emo-punk as an emo revival. Bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, Dashboard Confessional, The Promise Ring had the alternative/indie traits while bands like The Movielife, The Get Up Kids and Jimmy Eat World had the pop punk traits (calling it \"emo pop\"). Many 1980s emo fans didn't accept this regeneration as emo at all. Even in the 1990s the genre screamo came up with bands like Heroin, Saetia, and Pg. 99. These bands were influenced a lot by hardcore punk but added extremely raw songs and even had screaming. 1990s screamo was often nicknamed as skramz. Other screamo artists include The Saddest Landscape, Alexisonfire, Neil Perry and Circle Takes the Square. In the early 2000s, emo then came up with bands like Jimmy Eats World and The Get-Up Kids, who both had mostly a pop punk sound and the indie emo band Dashboard Confessional. Becoming a popular music style, emo then even expanded later with bands from even genres like post-hardcore and alternative rock. Before 2005, some other emo artists/bands even included My Chemical Romance, Hawthorne Heights, The Used, Senses Fail and Silverstein. Some of these bands had got famous. Most of them have a lot of 1990s emo traits but made their own style and some even began off sounding very old-school emo. Today, many bands are mislabeled as emo. Although many people restrict emo the strictly only the punk-influenced, underground or something type of bands, or bands that don't have fans who have a hair fringe and stuff. But emo still went into many genres of music and these so-called \"fake emo\" bands play that.\n\nEmo bands:\n\nRain\n\nRites of Spring\n\nThursday\n\nTitle Fight (sometimes)\n\nJawbox\n\nGlassjaw\n\nHeroin\n\nHot Cross\n\nPolicy of 3\n\nJawbreaker\n\nAlkaline Trio (sometimes)\n\nSilverstein\n\nBright Eyes\n\nSaves the Day\n\nMatchbook Romance\n\nDrive Like Jehu\n\nSenses Fail\n\nSunny Day Real Estate\n\nAmerican Football\n\nMidtown\n\nThe Movielife\n\nThe Get Up Kids\n\nJimmy Eat World\n\nCap'n Jazz\n\nScary Kids Scaring Kids\n\nSaosin\n\nHawthorne Heights\n\nThrice\n\nAlexisonfire\n\nI Hate Myself\n\nIndian Summer\n\nYou & I\n\nDashboard Confessional\n\nThe Promise Ring\n\nWeezer\n\nThe Wrens\n\nBreak the Silence\n\nThe Hated\n\nMoss Icon\n\nThe Used\n\nUnderoath (After first two albums especially their 3rd album.)\n\nThe Starting Line\n\nLoud?\n\nBraid\n\nTexas is the Reason\n\nSaosin\n\nBrand New\n\nJoan of Arc\n\nHey Mercedes\n\nSomething Corporate\n\nTransit\n\nBayside\n\nThe Story So Far\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nSuch Gold\n\nCaptain, We're Sinking\n\nJets to Brazil\n\nSaetia\n\nOrchid\n\nThe Saddest Landscape\n\nPg. 99\n\nOne Last Wish\n\nHappy Go Licky\n\nSeaweed\n\nMy Chemical Romance (Earlier work.
