        "text": "Emo. In the current pop culture climate, “hipster” is the only buzzword likely to inspire more mocking derision and scorn. From an Ian MacKaye-sponsored hardcore subgenre to an eclectic underground phenomenon amongst the milieu of underground phenomena in the 90s alt-rock boom which, at the time, was looked on with suspicion at best by outsiders, to the most laughable and maligned form of teen culture of the 21st century, emo has had a complicated history of bands with such disparate styles that it’s hard to pin down just what it is, musically. But if one thing is to be certain from messageboards and hate-filled comment sections all over the internet, it’s certainly not a highly respected form of music. Or at least it wasn’t, it seemed, until quite recently, when bands stopped denying the label, and even came to self-apply it, disarming critics of their most potent weapon (to be called an emo band was an artistic death sentence in the genre’s heyday, a fate which ensured that Superchunk is usually remembered as indie rock paragon while peers The Get Up Kids are resigned to the status of being named as one of Fall Out Boy’s biggest influences, if they’re remembered at all). And when the cynicism associated with the term, and the irony of calling oneself such wore off, it became quite obvious that these were serious musicians with huge potential, and once albums like ‘Whenever, If Ever’ and ‘Is Survived By’ started to crack the Billboard album charts, the music press could no longer dismiss them as naïve nostalgia-peddlers. Emo was back, and this time it had indie media’s seal of approval.\n\nFrom Stereogum to Pitchfork to Vice, the so-called emo revival is making waves among the tastemakers of the alternative music industry, but the artists they champion and their fans are less than convinced about their sincerity. As Evan Weiss of Into It. Over It. Points out, this is no revival – he’s been at it so long, when he started, the headliners of Warped Tour included the likes of Eminem, Kid Rock, and Papa Roach, a time long before pop-punk had the cultural capital it does now. And the current scene he’s a part of, admittedly much newer, can be traced, at its earliest, to a time when Fall Out Boy were putting albums at the top of the charts. It’s only a revival because they only just decided to pay attention to it. In fact, 10-15 years ago, Pitchfork seemed hell bent on destroying the genre they’re currently championing – The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World, and Samiam all got critically torn apart by the site, with Travis Morrison’s ‘Travistan’ getting a 0/10, one of the few albums to ever get that dishonor. And while they did dole out some praise and recognition here and there, the historical revisionism here is so blatant it’s nearly impossible to take seriously. And if the bands aren’t careful, this kind of half-hearted mainstream interest could be the death of them, chewing them up and spitting them out, as the industry is wont to do with fresh young bands part of an easily identifiable and marketable label.\n\nBut a concern that I’ve yet to see addressed among dedicated followers of the genre is the way that they themselves can be just as dismissive of certain aspects of the genre as the music critics. Everyone involved maintains that the revival is an illusion and that the genre has always been going strong, but only in the sense that the artists that influenced them have not broken up. Nobody seems to acknowledge that any emo band that achieved mainstream success in the 2000s was, in fact, emo. Indeed, a torrent of comments on articles addressing the subject maintain that “My Chemical Romance ain’t even emo!!!11!” In the previously cited Vice article, Dashboard Confessional’s Chris Carrabba and emo demigod Mike Kinsella are mentioned in the same breath. Granted, it was to make a point about the idiosyncratic longevity of those artists, to compare one to the other in any respect would have been blasphemy just a decade ago, likely to get you executed in some parts of the upper Midwest. Yet now it seems appropriate to venerate Carrabba as a pioneer of the genre, where once he was deemed as something along the lines of emo’s Nickelback? Something’s fishy about this brand of revisionism. Followers of Mineral or Braid drew a line in the sand in the late 90s, across which fans of Saves The Day and the like dared not cross for fear of being sycophantically mocked to death. Pop-punk piety won out in the end, though, and emo purists were forced to retreat from the spotlight for a while, content to consistently dismiss the newer wave of artists as heathens that ruined the scene for everybody, and it only got worse as we saw My Chemical Romance and Panic! At The Disco come to dominate MTV as perhaps the last coherent rock music movement to do so.\n\nBut why is there such a divide in the first place? The genre evolved a long way from the time Rites of Spring revolutionized DC hardcore in the mid 80s to the time The Promise Ring made it safe for lisping frontmen everywhere in the late 90s, so it only seemed natural for it to continue to evolve from there, from its primarily soft, twinkly sound oriented towards college kids to its more polished, teen-angsty iteration. And let us not forget, emo zealots in the second-wave were mocked with equal ferocity, from media such as video and interactive flash games. Perhaps it was the relatively narrow scope of the subject matter and sonic palette from which those newer artists drew, perhaps it was the, to put it lightly, eccentric fashion sense culled straight from Hot Topic, perhaps it was the melodramatic and egocentric fashion with which the younger generation conducted themselves that failed to endear themselves to the older, more sophisticated crowd, but little by little, then all at once, emo was condemned wholesale.\n\nTo me though, it seems just a bit hypocritical for fans of the current wave of emo to accept the bands once readily dismissed by those they idolize, yet do the exact same thing to an entire era of the genre’s history. Fall Out Boy is to You Blew It! as Jimmy Eat World were to American Football, and I think such generalizations are undeserved, then and now. Now, I will admit, I have something of a history with so called third-wave bands (for the uninitiated, first-wave emo generally runs from 1985 – 1990, second wave runs from 1991 – 1998, third wave runs from about 1999 – 2008, and fourth-wave emo picks up from there to the present day). I made myself many a playlist during my high school career, starting with “Sugar We’re Going Down” when the first phases of any vapid crush began, and ended with “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” when the object of my affection inevitably doted upon someone else. I’m not here to defend the musical merits of musicians that may or may not have graced the cover of Alternative Press in the past 10 years. I’m just saying, it seems that history is coming to repeat itself for emo, with music press feigning legitimate interest in artists, and many among the genres ranks picking on some group they deem heretics, perhaps somehow validating their self-applied outsider status by legitimizing their artistic merits in contrast to a more degenerate mutation of the “real” emo.\n\nSo, as fourth-wave emo begins to peak, having rid itself of the theatricality of the previous generation, focusing on themes of nostalgia and adulthood and thereby silencing any criticism from the likes of Jessica Hopper, and as bands like Joie De Vivre openly embracing and self-applying the term emo where their forebears would vehemently deny it, some things change, and some things stay the same. While there is some recognizable cross-pollination between the seemingly uncrossable divide between third- and fourth-wave artists (the influence of latter-day Brand New on The World Is A Beautiful Place is can be just as noticeable as the influence of the Kinsellas, and the bands even went on tour together recently, proving that perhaps the generation gap isn’t as big as its made out to be), the loudest and most convicted of emo fans seem to be of the “burn down Hot Topic!” variety. But who’s to say that by the time emo’s fifth-wave inevitably rolls around, the very same people won’t be singing the praises of Paramore and longing for a time when Pete Wentz was hobnobbing with the likes of Kanye West?\n\nThe 90s seem to be back in full force in 2013. Boy bands have returned via One Direction and N’Sync reunions, Portlandia has evangelized the slacker-congratulating “Dream of the 90s,” and perhaps most excitingly, alternative music is fucking awesome again. Be it the Midwest emo revival of Joie De Vivre and Dowsing, the lo-fi buzz of Wavves, or a renewed interest in aggressive music made by men from places like Seattle and DC, bands are reaching back to a time before post-hardcore meant Kellin Quinn and Warped Tour, and grunge had yet to fall out of favor, much less make superstars out of its damaged leading lights. And the results are spectacular. The Men recently put out the impressive ‘New Moon,’ channeling Dinosaur Jr. and Meat Puppets, Ty Segall took a turn for the dark and gritty on ‘Sleeper,’ released last week, and finally we come to Balance & Composure and a little album called ‘The Things We Think We’re Missing.’\n\nBalance & Composure are a band from Pennsylvania, home state to other recent hardcore acts like Pissed Jeans, though they occupy a different space, being nominally associated with a movement within post-hardcore called “The Wave,” which draws influence from classic 90s post-hardcore bands like Jawbox, while building upon contemporary developments and expanding their sonic palate. Much like grunge and other jokingly applied names to musical movements, “The Wave” is rather loosely defined, with bands sounding different enough that the term describes more of an aesthetic than a sound. This results in plenty of room for variation, not just from band to band, but in B&C’s case, from album to album. Their previous album, ‘Separation,’ was a very well-received debut from a band who had established a heady reputation through their EPs. This album, though, is a vast improvement. Where their last album was the sound of bitter lashing out, this is an album of brooding and reflection – which, as things would have it, is the name of the first track they released from the album.\n\n“Reflection” sums up the theme of the record quite nicely. As singer and guitarist Jon Simmons puts it;\n\n“It’s me wanting something to hold on to, perhaps someone, or answers to my questions about life. I’ve also noticed we spend all this time in life wanting more and more. Whether it be materials or success, we think we need these things constantly. At the end of the record I had some kind of epiphany where I realized that this was no way to live my life. I should be happy with what I have. I’m alive and I’m breathing and I should embrace that. There are things we think we need in our lives and maybe one day they will come, but right now we are on earth experiencing life and we should be caught up in the moment and just live.”\n\nHowever, based on the musical ambition present on this track and the album as a whole, it seems abundantly clear that the band is not content with resting on their laurels from their last album, nor will they take for granted what they’ve been handed down within their genre. No, B&C want something more, and they get damn close to getting it all on this record. “Reflection” starts off with a moody guitar line before building up into a brutal assault by the full band. The dynamic changes, from loud to even louder, to tense quiet, to punishingly loud again are stunning. “Burn all the wreckage/and start it all over/we’re building a message” seems as much a manifesto for the band and its lofty intentions as it is a reflection of personal growth, and is indicative in where B&C’s strengths lie, in the intensity of emotional expression.\n\nThe album opener “Parachutes” follows a similar musical formula of starting with a bit of sparse guitar overture before launching into a grunge-guitar assault, spicing up the dynamics with alternating loud and quiet sections, which makes for excellent pacing. While the technique is a favorite of the band on a number of the songs, it never seems tired, misused, or predictable, and they manage to mix it up enough, like on “Lost Your Name,” which, in contrast to “Parachutes,” is relatively subtle in the verse, picking up in the chorus and the bridge.\n\n“Tiny Raindrop” is, by B&C standards, is a tender track, offering such sweet sentiments as “come close, stay far/I’ll be your tiny raindrop/I’ll fall down now/you left me feeling shameful,” showing off a less intense side of the band. “Notice Me” is another absolutely excellent track, with powerful chord changes, a surprisingly tuneful melody, and a positively bouncy chorus that is the most reminiscent piece of the past they draw such poignant inspiration from on the album. “I’m Swimming” is another incredible offering, projecting an almost shoegaze type of vibe as it meanders from brooding verse to trudging chorus, while giving up some great lyrical wordplay and rhythmic ingenuity, particularly in the “caught me swimming in a daydream” section. The drums on “When I Come Undone” give a palpable sense of impending cataclysm that catches immediate and sustained attention. “Dirty Head” sees the band relent from the distorted attack, favoring an acoustic treatise on loneliness. Closing out the album, “Enemy” is a dark number, giving a great contrast to the relatively more intense, angry tracks that preceded it.\n\nThe production and mixing boasts contributions from Will Yip (producer of contemporaries like Title Fight and Circa Survive), mixing from Brad Wood (Sunny Day Real Estate, Smashing Pumpkins), and master engineering from Emily Lazar (Foo Fighters, Against Me!), which seems like a recipe for success. But listening to the album, while I acknowledge the intensity of the music, the album as a product can at times be a bit much, with drums and guitar mushing together to form an unsatisfying product, and after looking at that roster, I can see why. While it’s not a huge one, this is my biggest complaint, and while B&C are clearly trying to go as far with the music as they can, hopefully they will soon learn that less is more when it comes to this kind of music.\n\nWith “The Things We Think We’re Missing,” Balance & Composure show us promise that the band and bands like them can soon make the jump from tight-knit underground scene to attention-grabbing game changers. They join the rank of bands like Cloud Nothings in showing us that grunge as an influence did not die when Creed took up the mantle, that its power is not limited to a specific point in musical history. Meanwhile, they save genres like post-hardcore and emo from suffering a similar fate in the public consciousness by harshly proving to us that depth is still possible in the genre they find themselves in, and if the band continues the trend of fearless experimentation, paired with a keen eye for melody and refined songwriting, we may find ourselves in a 90s-esque renaissance of alternative music. But this isn’t the 90s, and they’re never coming back. Instead we have bands that recognize the impetus of its spirit, seeking to make it all their own and come up with something, unique, powerful, awe-inspiring, and harshly beautiful.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Notice Me, Reflection, I’m Swimming, Enemy\n\nGRADE: 9/10\n\nThe word emo has been something of an insult over last 15 years or so, but a new generation of artists is seeking to reclaim the word for indie rock, and one of its leading lights, The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die, recently landed their debut LP, ‘Whenever, If Ever,’ at 196 on the Billboard 200, indicating that this new wave of bands may be on to something, and the world of alternative music may soon have to start paying attention to emo again. I sat down with band member Greg Horbal to talk about the album.\n\nI hear from some reputable sources that you’re know within the band as “Shitty Greg.”How did you get that nickname?\n\nIt’s funny, I went to dinner with my friend last night and he told me the “Shitty” Greg thing has gone too far. I don’t remember, probably because I made people do stuff they didn’t want to do. I was always the one doing stuff, and you’ve got to fight sometimes to get things done. I’m less shitty and more just doing what I’m supposed to do in the band.\n\nWith the time that’s passed since you put out your first full-length LP in May, what do you think of the impact that it’s had? I remember one of the first reviews I read of it from Under The Gun gave it a 10/10, which shows that people are really starting to take the band seriously.\n\nYeah, it’s cool, but I think we’re all over the record, just because we were recording it for so long. I think for anyone it’s like, you make something, then you’re ready to move on to the next thing. It’s awesome that people like it a lot, but we’re all ready to just move on to the next thing now. We’re going to be touring a lot for the rest of the year, but I think we’re going to start working on a lot of new records, so we’re excited to do that and excited for people to hear the new stuff.\n\nHas your success resulted in taking the band more seriously yourselves?\n\nWe all quit our jobs to do this before the record, and we all knew that this is what we were going to be doing for a while. We’re pretty damn serious about it now; we’re going to see how far we can go with this. It’s still fun. If it weren’t fun, we wouldn’t want to do it anymore. Even with how serious we’re taking it, everything is still wildly stressful, but that pays off in the return you get from making art that people like. That’s the part that’s worth it.\n\nDo you have any plans for EPs or splits in the near future, or has the experience of making an album taken a while to recuperate from? I believe I heard some talk about compiling your EPs into one LP at some point soon.\n\nWe were talking about compiling the EPs, we might do that when we go to Europe. Topshelf still has a lot of covers printed out for the early stuff, so we’ve got to get rid of those before we do the collection thing. But we’ll probably end up doing that down the line. We might even just do that as a European release, that’s something I was going to look into. That collection is definitely happening in Japan on Stiff Slack Records at some point, I just don’t know when. For newer stuff, we’re probably going to do an ambient record for our friend Chris Zizzamia who does spoken word with us sometimes. We’re going to do a split 7” series, which will be the next thing we start to hammer out. We’re supposed to do a split 7” with Into It. Over It. where we both cover Minor Threat songs, and we’re doing another LP. So we’ve got a lot of stuff to work on. The LP will probably be the last thing. We’ll probably just start writing and then decide where each thing is going to go.\n\nThe lineup of the band seems to be subject to frequent change. Has that contributed more to the creative spirit and having a really dynamic sound? Do you have more problems with focus and direction?\n\nThe LP took so long because the lead singer of the band Tom (Diaz) was running into a lot of medical issues. It was really hard for him to be on the road and practice for a while. We were getting ready to tour last year, and at the last minute he had to cancel the entire thing. He had to step down after that because he felt he was holding the band back. He still helped record on a lot of the record, and our new guy Dave (Bello, lead vocals) is also on it, I sing a lot on that record, Katie (Shanholtzer-Dvorak, keyboards) and Derrick (Shanholtzer-Dvorak, guitar) also do. It’s kind of a smorgasbord of everybody. It’s kind of a transition for us. We’ve never done an 8-piece band before – there’s actually 10 people that play on the record. It was written as the group that we were during the split. The way the writing goes, no one ever comes in with a fully written song. People work in a coupe small groups to come up with a general idea. Having so many people changes the direction for sure, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing. It keeps everything flowing, and I feel that as the unit that we are now, we’re the most focused that we’ve ever been.\n\nIs there equal input from everybody, including the newest members, or are there primary songwriters?\n\nJulia (Peters, Cello) for example, didn’t write anything. She wasn’t really in the band at the time the record was written and recorded. Same with the horn players on the record. The core band that worked on writing that record are the same people who have always been in the band from the beginning. In the future we’re going to be incorporating a lot more instrumentation as we write as opposed to writing as just a rock group, so we want to try different things constantly. We’re going to try to be very experimental in the writing process.\n\nWhat do you think was the biggest difference in the songwriting process for this album as opposed to past releases?\n\nJust how long it took, there’s no other difference. With everything that was going on, we almost broke up a couple times, as people just became more disinterested than they had been in the past. There were a lot of times where we thought we were never going to finish the record. Lyrics were not written for a very long time, which was different. That’s what really held everything up. We had all the instrumentation done, but the adding of the keyboards and vocals usually comes later, and that was really delayed. Also, almost everybody contributed to writing keyboard parts for this record, and same with vocal parts. There was a very communal sense going on. There were a lot of long nights with the people who sang on the record just working together in a room and working to get happy with what we had.\n\nFor the screaming parts, was there one person who was mainly contributing that, or were there several people contributing to that?\n\nDerrick does a lot of the screaming. I usually sing, but I screamed the parts on “Getting Sodas.” The basic ideas for that were mine, screaming-wise, and Derrick helped there with the lyrics. In the end, I just sounded better doing it because I knew exactly how it wanted to sound, but generally Derrick does that. But now I understand why he doesn’t like screaming: it hurts. It sucks!\n\nSo if someone has an idea for something, they generally just go for it themselves?\n\nWell, that’s true sometimes. But, for example, the vocals in the first part of “You Will Never Go To Space,” I wrote, but Dave ends up singing them, because he was just better at it. It’s less of a selfish thing and more like, “You’re better at this, so you should do it.” Everything is very communal. We do whatever is in the best interests of the group. There’s no set rule for what we do, we just do whatever feels best.\n\nWhat would you say is your favorite part of the album?\n\nThis record was very stressful the entire time, so it was just nice having it finished. We had a really big snow storm in Connecticut. We got 3 feet of snow, and we got held up at my house, which was covered in snow, with myself, John from the band Dads, Julia, and Chris Teti our trumpet player. Just before that, I had the record sent to me. It was nice to have the finished product in my hands. Just being stuck inside that day listening to the record felt like the culmination of that whole process. I feel like anything we make from here on out won’t be anywhere near as stressful. There’s not going to be a feeling that we could break up at any moment before we finish recording the next thing because we’re all so frustrated with how it’s coming along. So it’ll be nice to continue on and have more of a level head about everything.\n\nDoes it feel like whenever things get so stressful, you start to ask yourself why you’re doing this at all?\n\nI don’t agree with that necessarily. Nothing easy is worth doing. My girlfriend was just talking to me about this, how she’d never really taken college seriously until she’d started taking some really hard classes, which motivated her to feel like “I’m going to kick this thing in the ass!” I think that’s a good approach to anything. Work is more rewarding when you’re pushing yourself. Especially when it comes to something you love to do, and this is something we all love to do. And we’re not going to be a band that puts out the same record six times, every time, we’re hopefully going to challenge ourselves to do something new.\n\nI heard you’re filming a music video, can you talk about that a little?\n\nWe’re filming it right now! I’m in Philadelphia right now, but tomorrow I’m driving back to my hometown to this quarry, where there’s just going to be people jumping off of cliffs. That should be a good time. We’re going to rent an underwater camera so we can get some cool shots of people hitting the water. It’s for the song “Low Light Assembly.” Alex Henry who works for Run For Cover Records is going to be directing the video. He’s my roommate. I’m pretty excited to do it. I like everything that he’s done, especially that Daylight video he just did (for their song “Life In A Jar” from the album ‘Jar’), fucking great.\n\nWhat are some bands you’re listening to a lot lately? Are they an influence on any songs you may be writing?\n\nWe’ve all kind of taken a mental vacation from actively writing right now. I don’t think most of us have even seen each other since we got back from our summer tour, so we’re seeing each other for the first time next week, and after that we’ll really start writing again. Personally, I’ve been listening to a lot of The Minutemen. Some other stuff would be, like, Gonjasufi, who’s been awesome lately, Built To Spill, Modest Mouse. I’ve been listening to this Connecticut band called Ovlov, who are this grungy, nasty band. They’re recordings are pretty lo-fi, but it’s awesome. I’ve been listening to a lot of Pile, and this band who’ve put out a new record, they’re called Porches. Their album is called ‘Slow Dance In The Cosmos.’ It just went up on Stereogum, it’s awesome, so I’ve been listening to that a lot. The new Pity Sex album (‘Dark World’), and the new Dads album (‘American Radass’), and Topshelf just did a record for this UK band called Crash Of Rhinos (‘Knots’), and it’s fucking phenomenal. Julia Brown, Teen Suicide, both really good. Radiator Hospital from Philadelphia, put out a record called ‘Something Wild,’ and it’s awesome. We’re going to be playing with the band Toe soon, so I’ve been listening to a lot of that. A lot of Do Make Say Think. Everyone else in the band are huge Brand New fans except me, and we’re going on tour with them soon, so I’ve been listening to their album ‘The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me’ a bunch, and I’m really into it, so I’m excited to play with them now, it should be a great time. Also the Pixies. I went on a trip to Vermont recently, and every store or establishment I went to, they were either playing the Pixies or Built To Spill, and that was awesome, so that made me go on a real serious Pixies kick.\n\nSpeaking of Brand New, you’ve got some shows coming up with them next month, and they’re a band that are part of what many call the third wave of emo, whereas you’re part of the so-called fourth wave. What would you say the connection is between third wave bands like that and fourth wave bands like The World Is, or do fourth wave bands tend to ignore the third wave and go straight to second wave bands?\n\nThis is a generalization, but a lot of people in the fourth wave scene tend to do the Kinsella thing (Tom and Mike Kinsella were members of influential second wave emo bands Cap’n Jazz, Joan Of Arc, and American Football, among others); the finger tapping, the twinkling sound, and all that kind of stuff. We draw influence from that too, but we’ve also take serious influence from Brand New. Everyone but me is a huge fan of that band, I was the nerd who was listening to ska when I was growing up. But those bands all played a big influence on us growing up. At this point we’re not really trying to replicate anybody. We just listen to what we feel like. When you’re in a band you take influence from everything you’re listening to, and in our little fourth-wave emo scene, the bands that are going to be remembered are the ones that aren’t trying to replicate any one band.\n\nIn the fourth wave, there’s been criticism about how bands are too focused on the past and take too much from the bands that influenced them. How do you guys think you’re innovating, as opposed to just being an “emo revival” band?\n\nWe just kind of make whatever we like. That’s really as simple as it comes down to. We just try to write a song and hope nobody thinks it sucks. Just add a delay pedal to it!\n\nIndie labels like Topshelf seem to place a lot of importance on putting out releases on vinyl. How does the vinyl format continue to be relevant in the digital age? Is it a crucial part of who you are as a band?\n\nWe all just like to collect records. It’s something we’re all happy to have. But it really just makes more sense when it comes down to it to have the digital format. I don’t have every record that I like on vinyl. You can have a year’s worth of music on your computer as opposed to having vinyl take up two rooms in your house. But at the same time it’s nice to have that whole package. I still listen to vinyl records regularly, and I enjoy it. I think of myself as a music enthusiast, music is wildly important to me, and for people like me, it’s nice to have that physical representation. I like to just eat dinner and put on a record, or go do some work and listen to a record while I’m doing it. I don’t know if releasing on vinyl is something we’ll be doing forever. I’m sure at some point it will no longer be logical, but we’ll see. There’s really no way to tell.\n\nDoes the sequencing of your records happen with vinyl in mind (side A and side B having certain musical schemes, for example)?\n\nBoth ‘Whenever, If Ever’ and ‘Josh Is Dead’ were done that way, although ‘Josh Is Dead’ was done a little more poorly. There’s a song called “blank #6” that’s on both sides. It starts on side A, then fades out, and when you flip the record it finishes. And the delay between part two of that song and ‘Be Neon With Me’ is not as instantaneous as it should have been, so if we ever press that again we’ll fix that. But ‘Whenever, If Ever’ was done very consciously. The record has a very serious flow to it, and everything was done with the idea of “this is how it’s going to be on the LP.” The last few songs on side A run together, and side B is pretty seamless for the most part. The transitions were worked out so you listen to the album as one whole thing. When we got the test pressing for the album, the song “The Layers Of Skin We Drag Around” was on side B when it was supposed to be on side A, and it was really frustrating, because we felt that if we didn’t approve that pressing, the record wouldn’t be ready for the tour. So Topshelf made 500 retail copies of the incorrect pressing, and every other copy has the songs sequenced correctly. But I think it’s very important to have an LP flow, and I like it when bands do that.\n\nWhat does the future hold for The World Is?\n\nWe just want to see how long we can do this for. We all quit our jobs, so we’re all entrenched in this, and I work at Topshelf booking tours for bands. I was a civil engineer before this, and I had to make a decision to throw away my stable life and be a child for a little bit longer. But it’s fun, nobody else I know does this, so I’m happy to be doing it. I’ve always wanted to do this, we all have, and the chance is finally here, so we’re taking advantage of it while we can.\n\nDo you have any advice for up-and-coming bands who want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nWrite music that you like, play shows, make friends, don’t have any serious aspirations in mind, and just see what happens. If it’s going to work, it’s going to work. We all played in bands that went nowhere, but they were fun anyway. As long as you’re making art that you enjoy, it really shouldn’t matter other than that.\n\nAnything else you’d like to add?\n\nWe’re going on tour again soon, and hopefully you can all see us and it doesn’t suck!\n\nIndie. Such a formless word these days. In days of yore, it described not a sound, but an attitude concerning music. “Major labels have what they want you to hear, but we don’t want to play that – we’re going to make music that we want to make,” said bands like Sonic Youth, Pavement, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Now, the word “indie” has become a synonym for the most controversial buzzword of 21st century pop-culture: “hipster.” It brings to mind a hegemonic sound, rather than the unity-in-disparity of yesteryear. Today, indie tends to mean bands composed of frail young white men with faux-secondhand designer clothes ripping off Sylvia Plath and William S. Burroughs, playing either a standard rehashing of acoustic power-folk backed by “baroque” woodwind and the token first chair cello of your community college orchestra, or the arpeggiating sketches of a first-time Casio keyboard owner who bought one Kraftwerk album after their cool older brother’s friend recommended it to them. Now, anyone who’s willing to whistle the chorus melody of their song out into mainstream radio while licensing their music to the likes of Hollister and Apple can have their fifteen minutes of fame on Pitchfork and MTV2. They may even be so lucky as to date quirky movie stars and have songs written about them (ahem, Ben Gibbard, James Righton, Conor Oberst, etc.). The harsh truth is, what you know as “indie” has been co-opted no less perversely than grunge, new wave, and emo (yes, there was a time when emo was a respectable genre of music) before it, it’s at the heart of why you’re complaining that “no good music was made after [insert year], Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber are the devil!” And guess what – you’re to blame.\n\nBut let’s take a step back, because it might be worth it to educate ourselves on the history of indie. There have been indie labels since popular music began (major labels, you see, did not coagulate into what they are today overnight; Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and James Brown were all indie musicians in their day), but indie as it’s known now really has its origin in the punk rock movement of the late 1970s. While punk’s earliest vanguards like The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Clash were signed to major labels, they touted a DIY ethos that inspired a wave of music lovers after them. Soon, labels started by independent record stores like Rough Trade in London, fanzines like Touch and Go in Chicago, and even the bands themselves like SST and Dischord were popping up in droves, inspired by the idea that anyone can be an artist, regardless of skill, financial means, and especially association with mainstream consumer culture.\n\nThe artists placed a premium on actually interacting with fans and building relationships, both on principle and necessity. While major labels in the 1980s made money on album sales, actually losing money on tours in support of the album, the business model of the indie label was just the opposite. Album sales were too low to justify that kind of approach, so relentless touring is what allowed indie bands to make what meager living they did, and for indie labels to stay afloat. The close relationship between band and fan is part of what sparks the authenticity debate today. With indie bands, there’s a kind of unspoken agreement that if the fan shells out money to buy records, t-shirts, and concert tickets, and in some cases with rising stars, food and a place to stay while out on tour when they can’t afford basic necessities, the band will be totally upfront, down-to-Earth, and retain artistic integrity over its music. When the band transcends this in order to make money by having their now-bland music in an ad for Coca-Cola, there is thought to be a betrayal of personal trust. “You were never interested in the fans at all, it was just some clever marketing ploy!” says the music fan. On the other hand, bands do have to eat, and it’s extremely difficult to maintain a day job when one is forced to accommodate a regular touring schedule. Thus, if a band wants to continue to make music, and make a living at it, therefore theoretically providing for more creative energy being put into making good music, at some point indie bands tend to transcend the limitations of the indie label, with the exception of outliers like Fugazi. Indie heroes like The Replacements, Hüsker Dü, Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, and virtually all the grunge bands eventually signed to a major label. Some bands achieved commercial success and retained critical adoration (Sonic Youth), others sold out their sound in favor of more lucrative sales (The Replacements), while other attempts simply flopped, but the point is this: retaining “indie” status and respect, while not technically being signed to an indie label, and living above the poverty line are, historically, not mutually exclusive, which we will touch on later.\n\nIndie labels themselves have a delicate balance they have to strike between independence from the influence of corporate monoliths, and financial stability. Indie labels start based on the basic principle talked about earlier, that anyone with a passion for music and a distaste for its commercial bastardization should have the ability to find an alternate route. Thus, they not only have to make money – because they are indeed a business – they have to maintain authenticity just like their artists, which seem to be two aims constantly at odds. Why do some labels succeed and make a profit without accepting money from major labels and their distributors like Merge Records, while others either have to lose their status as a truly indie label like Sub Pop and Vagrant did, or wither away like SST? One problem that indie labels often encounter is associating themselves too closely with scenes, essentially musical fads that don’t last forever. Grunge was already a passing trend when Nirvana left Sub Pop, and soon the label found itself struggling to remain relevant. When Nirvana’s ‘Nevermind’ revitalized the ailing scene and catapulted it into the mainstream, Sub Pop found its artists leaving the label in order to capitalize on new prospects of success. Sub Pop, in order to stay afloat, entered into a joint venture with Warner Bros. Records, thereby ending its status as an entirely independent label, going on to have success in the last decade with the likes of Fleet Foxes. SST suffered a similar fate, putting all its eggs in one basket with Black Flag, the band that label owner and founder Greg Ginn played in, as well as hardcore punk in general. A combination of forcing all its other bands to play second fiddle to Black Flag and sidelining them enough to force them to leave the label, Black Flag itself eventually breaking up, and lacking any new bands interested in signing with them, SST, while not going bankrupt, faded into obscurity, only ever releasing albums by Greg Ginn’s side projects to this day. On the other hand, Merge Records, founded by Superchunk members Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance, has only grown more successful with time, weathering the eventually passing of the 90s lo-fi craze to see one of their bands, Arcade Fire, top the Billboard album charts. The key to their success includes treating bands fairly, but also having realistic expectations about album sales, and perhaps most importantly, building up their brand. Unlike Sub Pop, who attached themselves to bands in order to ride on the grunge wave, bands attach themselves to Merge, because Merge has a solid reputation of putting out quality releases. What makes them truly independent, though, is that they only sign bands they like. They don’t throw money at bands in the hopes that that will be enough to make them successful, they don’t impose any creative or financial restrictions on their bands, and they don’t sign bands they don’t like just because they may be a financial safe bet. This is why Merge is truly an independent label.\n\nBut the musical climate that Merge, Sub Pop, and SST came about in is quite different from the one we have today. Rather than having bands slaving away for years trying to build a following in order to achieve only modest recognition, without any hope of getting mainstream success, let alone wanting it much at all, there are bands like MGMT that can write a bubblegum hit on their first LP and Panic! At The Disco (technically on an indie label at the time) getting signed without even playing a gig. What is the cause of this drastic difference in indie viability? In short; Nirvana. While a number of complex factors played a part in actually getting them to the point that they were when they broke, with bands like REM creating a touring circuit in which to play and allowing the band to create a following, or Sonic Youth providing a model by which one conducts business, it was Nirvana who blew the doors down for underground music by building on the trailblazing success of its predecessors. The story has been done to death so I won’t go into more detail here about it, but suffice to say that before Nirvana, indie bands couldn’t really make it on their own, and the ones that did sign to a major label either completely alienated their fanbase and broke up, or, at best, sold maybe 250,000 copies, not the 16 million that ‘Nevermind’ eventually achieved. After the grunge explosion, major labels sought to capitalize on this new form of youth culture, snatching up any unsigned, underground, or indie band they thought might crack the top 40. And while it may have made it hard for bands like Pavement and Fugazi, who refused to compromise their sound, to be accepted on their own, for those willing to play along, it was now possible to graduate from the theater to the stadium regardless of underground roots. Green Day and the punk revival also played a part, commercializing anti-authority postures and allowing any niche music genre, no matter how abrasive, to be seen as a viable commercial endeavor by major labels. Thus, the stratification of rock music began, with third-wave ska, garage rock revival, post-punk revival, alt-country, folk, dance-punk, screamo, blues rock, pop punk, and everything else you could think of getting their moments in the sun over the last 15 years.\n\nThat brings us right up to today, where we have things like Coachella, allowing yuppies to forget their student loans and day jobs for the weekend while they live it up listening to their favorite bands that they totally heard before they got famous. Things like Pitchfork and Brooklyn Vegan and Stereogum, which are all too happy to tell you which band is authentic and innovative, and which bands are simply not cool enough to make it onto your iPod. Things like Urban Outfitters, which sells Minor Threat t-shirts for $30 apiece. Things like Starbucks compilations which you can play in your Prius as you drive home from the co-op. You get the picture. Indie is now as commercial as hip hop, and the best part about it is, it’s just so subtle. Unlike Nirvana and the rise of the technically distinct “alternative rock” movement (if you think there isn’t a real difference between alternative and indie for the sake of simple classification, just ask yourself whether or not there was a time that indie was ever an appropriate label for the Red Hot Chili Peppers), there wasn’t a single moment where indie “broke.” It just kind of seeped into collective consciousness as people grew cynical towards nu-metal at the turn of the century and wanted to be connected to something that, on the surface, had a deeper level of meaning to it. It’s just taken for granted that indie is a label that you can apply to yourself to prove your authenticity and adopt the stereotypical mannerisms and, most importantly, purchasing habits of your standard indie rocker. Teens got emo, adults got indie, and everyone was content to shop till they dropped for their cultural identity, manufactured or not. Without a definitive before and after point, it wasn’t anyone’s place to say who was and who was not “real indie.”\n\nAnd what’s wrong with this? Why does it even matter that indie has been codified and commodified to oblivion? Why does it sound like I’m writing with such spite in the “things like” section of the last paragraph? Well, for one, it’s all just so boring. The bands aren’t original, but Deap Vally is being touted as the “next big thing” before they even drop an album, and despite there being a band that sounds exactly like them almost every year preceding them back to its point of originality, the White Stripes. Purity Ring is being trumpeted as the biggest thing since chillwave, but synthpop done by greasy looking art school dropouts has been done to death over the course of the last decade to the point where nothing this band could do would save it. The first time the hype machine got a hold of bands like these, it was new, exciting, and refreshing. The second time around, it seemed like media outlets had it a bit off, but we were still excited anyway because it seemed like the next Nirvana or the next Radiohead or the next Daft Punk was just around the corner. By the third, fourth, fifth, or whatever cycle of indie hype we’re currently on in 2013, it’s just so hard for anyone to really care anymore. NME seems to have predictions every few months about the newest underground band that’s going to storm the charts and incite musical-cultural revolution, but not once have the predictions come true. All the bands rise and fall in the span of two years, and you just get so cynical and sick of it, it’s tempting to dismiss indie entirely as meaningless corporate drivel. At this point, what differentiates these bands from the lists that Buzzfeed posts about inane subjects like “35 Things ONLY People From Hawaii Will Understand!” It’s shoveling unoriginal nonsense at you, devoid of substance, in order to drive traffic to the site, or, in this case, album sales and concert tickets and t-shirts.\n\nAnother issue I take with the indie status quo (other than the enraging fact that there is an indie status quo at all) is that hiding behind an aura of underground authenticity while signing with major labels and being featured in hipster hits like Juno or whatever movie Michael Cera is bumbling his way through right now is a bit of a slap in the face to those who actually invest themselves in underground culture. It’s like saying, “hey, see this thing that’s meaningful to you? It never had any meaning at all. This band you like is no different than Mickey Mouse or the Marlboro Man – it’s a meme, a cultural icon by which we can sell things to invented demographics and make a profit.” It’s not like people naively and wantonly attach meaning to random things just because it’s outside of the mainstream, either. It’s because, contrary to what The OC would have had you believe, there are people who are genuinely dissatisfied with mainstream consumer culture. There are people who see things that are wrong with the way things operate in our business-as-usual society. They aren’t one of the popular kids, not because they can’t be, but because they don’t want to be. They are not corrupted so easily. And in the context of indie music, they think that you don’t need to be a huge name superstar like Michael Jackson to live out your dream as a music artist, that music made with sincerity and passion is just as valid whether it’s being played to 10, 100, or 100,000 people a night. While the mainstream wants to shut them out because they don’t fit the mold, because they could never make it past the audition round of American Idol, because they don’t want to headline Bonnaroo, because they don’t want to have their lead singer be part of a public meltdown involving Britney Spears and several members of the paparazzi and have their personal lives lampooned and made a spectacle of, the underground welcomes them for this attitude. But when it turns out that the band you staked this belief on was just acting on the whims of a representative of the mainstream that both rejects you for being different and that you reject for being corrupt, it is a betrayal of deeply held beliefs. When Elizabeth Grant changes her name to Lana Del Rey, wears flowers crowns, artificially constructs an image of indie authenticity but in reality being born to a very wealthy family, and after having her new image constructed for her, paying to have a pop album she released prior removed from shelves so that there was no trace of a pre-pre-fab Lana Del Rey – when all that happens, all bets are off. That is why indie in its current state is such a cultural abomination.\n\nBut of course, someone has to be buying these albums, right? It’s not like record companies just will these bands into popularity. It’s the culturally oblivious who couldn’t care less about real authenticity, they only care about capital-A Authenticity, the kind you can buy at American Apparel or on iTunes. Does any of this anger, upset, or enrage you? Well, what are you doing about it? Are you complaining about it on YouTube, bemoaning that “they just don’t make them like they used to!” Are you torrenting the latest EP from the local new bands rather than buying them? Are you casually just going to shows because it’s nothing more than a social function? Then let me enlighten you: you are the reason the music scene sucks. The amount you invest yourself in emerging artists is directly proportional to their success. Do you think that new band playing downtown makes better music than anything they play on the radio, and could actually have a chance of making it? Then do them, yourself, and the whole music-consuming culture a favor, and get involved! Go to shows, make connections with the bands, support them by buying their music and maybe a t-shirt, unless the band is like Fugazi and feels like t-shirts are an obnoxious way of branding yourself and play a part in corrupting music. Maybe even start a band of your own if you’re really that dissatisfied. Don’t worry, in the underground community, willingness to play is more important than ability to play, so literally anyone can jump right in and do it if they have the drive. Or if that’s not your thing, start a zine, a blog, a label, do something to take an active role in supporting good new underground music. You’re doing nobody any favors by talking shit about modern music while staring at your ass and wondering why there aren’t any good new bands to change that.\n\nSo, to conclude, what does the future have in store for indie? Well, on the one hand, the state of “indie” as a cohesive cultural identity is dismal. On the other hand, prospects are good for bands who are actually independent. With options like home recording software to get the same quality you would get at a studio, Kickstarter to fund things like album pressings, tours, and the like, the rise of the YouTube cover song trend assuring internet popularity before actually writing your own song, allowing you to work with a bona fide hit in order to learn the craft of songwriting and composition, not mention YouTube, Last.fm, and Spotify all but destroying the relevance of commercial radio and MTV, and with all the social media applications of building fan bases like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. – it’s easier than ever for a band to get their music heard, get exposed, and be successful as truly independent musicians. At this point, labels are only relevant for their connections. Bands don’t need to be hired by record labels so much as record labels need to be hired by bands. Selling out is no longer necessary, all one needs to do is buy in.\n\nSources:\n\nBubble Gum Indie: http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/2011/08/bubble-gum-indie.html\n\nHow Indie Finally OFFICIALLY Died: The Broken Indie Machine: http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/node/8599\n\nDeconstructing: The OC and Indie Rock Gentrification: http://www.stereogum.com/1426101/deconstructing-the-o-c-and-indie-rock-gentrification/top-stories/lead-story/\n\nStuff White People Like #41 Indie Music: http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/30/40-indie-music/\n\nDeconstructing: Liz Phair and Indie Rock Poptimism: http://www.stereogum.com/1390261/deconstructing-liz-phair-and-indie-rock-poptimism/top-stories/\n\nThe state of Merge records, after a Grammy win and a mini label festival: http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-state-of-merge-records-after-a-grammy-win-and-a-mini-label-festival/Content?oid=2173093\n\nIs Miku Hatsune A More Authentic Pop Star Than Lana Del Rey?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3c8STXjQ20\n\nOur Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes From The American Indie Underground 1981 – 1991 by Michael Azerrad\n\nGet In The Van: On The Road With Black Flag by Henry Rollins"
