        "text": "Rock and Roll Genre\n\nLove Music? Think theres nothing better than your favourite rock and roll? Think again ..\n\nRock is only a word that generalise the many different genres within it. As rock is our main obsession here at CrescSound, we thought we like to explore a little around our most loved music and give out a brief history lesson if you will. We will also do a little special feature information on the becoming popular genre known as Emo.\n\nRock is one of the most popular music formed with a prominent vocal melody accompanied by guitar, bass and drums. And for some bands in making their own style may also include other instruments like saxophone, violin, sitar, flute, or piano/keyboard. In thinking the main stereotype of rock music, it usually has a strong, back beat, and it almost always revolves around the main instrument of the music which is the Guitar. That sound can either be solid electric, hollow electric or even acoustic.\n\nQuoted from the All Music Guide:- In its purest form, Rock and Roll has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat and a catchy melody."
