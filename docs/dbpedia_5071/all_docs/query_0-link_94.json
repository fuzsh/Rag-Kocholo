        "text": "In 2009, Dashboard Confessional released what its frontman Chris Carrabba felt might be the band’s sixth and final album, “Alter the Ending,” a capstone to a decade-long run that saw the band go from emo innovator to genre standard-bearer to elder weathering the end of an era.\n\nThe group’s 2003 album, “A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar,” and “Dusk and Summer,” from 2006, both went to No. 2 on the Billboard 200, perhaps the symbolic peak of emo’s pop breakthrough. Mr. Carrabba’s songs — scarred wails pulsing with nervy punk energy — were among the genre’s most recognizable, but all that wailing took its toll. By the time of “Alter the Ending,” Mr. Carrabba was tired, and the scene he’d helped build had seemingly run its course.\n\nIn the down years, Mr. Carrabba, 42, worked on outside projects including the bands Twin Forks and Further Seems Forever. But a few years ago, emo began to experience a revival. Younger bands embraced him as a touchstone. Some, like nothing,nowhere., asked for collaborations, bringing Mr. Carrabba into a modern sound that built a hip-hop hybrid on his emo foundation.\n\nThe zeitgeist has come full circle, and on Feb. 9, Dashboard Confessional will release “Crooked Shadows,” its seventh album and first since 2009.\n\nLast month, Mr. Carrabba spent a quiet evening at the Palm steakhouse in Manhattan, where he ordered fish and spinach. His hair was swept back with pomade, as it long has been, and he was wearing a hoodie advertising a Bethlehem, Pa., bakery called Vegan Treats. He was contemplative.\n\nOver three hours he talked about retreating from the spotlight, the persistence of emo and accusations of sexual assault that have roiled the genre. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
