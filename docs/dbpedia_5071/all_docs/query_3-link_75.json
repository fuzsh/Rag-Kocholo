It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as \"emotional hardcore\" or \"emocore\" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.\n\nAs the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.\n\nEmo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre \"screamo\". In recent years the term \"emo\" has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds.\n\nIn addition to music, \"emo\" is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior.\n\nStereotypes\n\nEmo has been associated with a stereotype that includes being particularly emotional, sensitive, shy, introverted, or angst-ridden.[156][157][158] It has also been associated with stereotypes like depression, self-injury, and suicide.[159][160] Emo has also been constantly confused before with Goth.\n\nGender bias\n\nEmo has been criticized for its androcentrism.[161] Andy Greenwald notes that there are very few women in emo bands, and that even those few do not typically have an active voice in the songs' subject matter: \"Though emoand to a certain degree, punkhas always been a typically male province, the monotony of the labels' gender perspective can be overwhelming.\"[162] The triumph of the \"lonely boy's aesthetic\" in emo, coupled with the style's popularity, has led to a litany of one-sided songs in which males vent their fury at the women who have wronged them:[162] Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments in a veneer of pop music.[163]\n\nHowever, despite emo's frequent portrayal of women as powerless victims, fans of the style are from both genders, and some acts have even greater popularity with women than with men.[164] One explanation for this is that the unifying appeal of emo, its expression of emotional devastation, can be appreciated equally by both sexes regardless of the songs' specific subjects.[165]\n\nSuicide\n\nEmo music has been blamed for the suicide by hanging of teenager Hannah Bond by both the coroner at the inquest into her death and her mother, Heather Bond, after it was claimed that emo music glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with My Chemical Romance was said to be linked to her suicide. The inquest heard that she was part of an Internet \"emo cult\" [177] and her Bebo page contained an image of an \"emo girl\" with bloody wrists.[178] It also heard that she had discussed the \"glamour\" of hanging online[177] and had explained to her parents that her self-harming was an \"emo initiation ceremony\".[178] Heather Bond criticised emo fashion, saying: \"There are 'emo' websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves.\" After the verdict was reported in NME, fans of emo music contacted the magazine to defend against accusations that it promotes self-harm and suicide.[179]\n\nSource: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo\n\nHow to Be Emo\n\nYou're wondering what it takes to be emo. Being an emo is not, as many people think, about being lonely, isolated and depressed. Being an emo means to express yourself in creative ways through music, poetry, reading, writing, and the way that you look. Read on to find out what a real emo is like.\n\nThe Emo Lifestyle\n\nEmo is a state of mind. But like \"hipster,\" \"punk,\" and \"leftist,\" it can mean any number of different things. Mostly, you'll just need the right attitude. Being emo is all about emotional reflection, an acknowledgment of personal anxiety, and a passion for expressive music.\n\nAlthough others might consider it an easy way to call someone emotional, they aren't strictly correct. Every human is emotional, though compared to an emo every other human might as well be a Vulcan. People who are emo are simply prepared and comfortable enough to showing their natural human emotions.\n\nUnderstand what emo is. The meaning of emo comes from music  \"emo\" is short for emotive hardcore, a sub-genre of post-hardcore, which still has roots in indie rock, alternative or pop punk today. So its ties to music are especially strong, and they provide the basis for our common understanding of what it means to be emo. But someone who is emo have number of different ways of relating to one another and standing out. Emo is a lot of things. The music was underground in the 1980s and 1990s. Although, Jawbreaker did have a little bit of fame as they released their classic emo album \"Dear You\" and were on a major label. It then got big by the early 2000s with Jimmy Eat World's albums Clarity and Bleed American and even with bands like Dashboard Confessional and The Get-Up Kids.\n\nSo while the guy with dark hair and guyliner listening to Dashboard Confessional in Portland might be considered emo by a lot of people, the California blonde who surfs and listens to Dashboard Confessional might consider herself emo as well. There's no one judge about who's emo and who isn't.\n\nPeople who are emo identify themselves through fashion, but not always. Emos have a way of dressing and expressing themselves through clothes. Some people believe that emo is a way of life and others believe it is a teenage grow out fad. Some people believe there are rules to being emo things such as never calling yourself \"emo\" and listening to the right bands. Others think that all you need is the right emotional outlook.\n\nMusic\n\nAppreciate Emo music. It's an essential thing in emo! Emo started in Washington DC with bands like Rites of Spring, The Hated and Embrace during the middle of the 1980s. Originally short for emotional hardcore, these bands were influenced by punk rock. In the early 1990s, when the emotional hardcore bands faded. Emo was reinvented for a more indie/alternative/pop punk style with bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Jimmy Eat World, Weezer and Dashboard Confessional. Bands like Jawbreaker, however, had a punk-influenced style. Today, bands can have punk influences (My Chemical Romance [early], The Used, Senses Fail), alternative/indie influences (Brand New), or pop punk influences (Paramore, Fall Out Boy).\n\nProbably the first and most important thing to do in order to be considered emo is to listen to emo bands. Test yourself. Try listening to emo music and see if you end up liking it. If you finish wanting to download or buy the songs after youre done with the album, youre probably a true emo. If you don't like the music, that's okay too. You can still express your emotions through fashion and lifestyle. You can try many styles of emo like old emo, emotional hardcore, indie-emo, emo-pop, screamo, new emo, emoviolence, etc.\n\nIf you don't like normal emo, try listening to screamo. Screamo is closely related to emo but with more hardcore punk influence and screaming. Some screamo bands include: I Would Set Myself On Fire For You, Portraits of Past, Orchid (not to be confused with the metal band), Pg.99, Alexisonfire, I Hate Myself, the Saddest Landscape, Indian Summer, Break the Silence, Neil Perry, Alexisonfire, Heroin, Underoath (2002), The Used (not very often though), From Autumn to Ashes, Circle Takes The Sqaure, Funeral Diner, City of a Caterpillar, Anomie and Piano Become The Teeth. If you end up liking the music, it doesn't really matter what you call it.\n\nYou could also try emoviolence, which is screamo that has a ton more hardcore punk influences in it and even some influneces from powerviolence. Try bands like Orchid, Reversal of Man and United Nations.\n\nConsider picking up an instrument. Being able to play music by yourself or in a band would give you huge credibility. Remember, though, that it takes quite a while for most people to learn an instrument and to start being able to play songs.\n\nYou can try emo-pop, too. Emo-pop is emo with a pop punk style. Pioneered by bands like The Get-Up Kids, Midtown, The Starting Line, The Movielife and Jimmy Eat World, other bands include Paramore and Fall Out Boy. Pop punk, in case you didn't know is loud, punk-influenced pop rock. Pop punk bands (not saying these are emo) can include Sum 41, New Found Glory and Good Charlotte.\n\nTry playing the bass or guitar, or perhaps even the violin, which sounds amazing in emo songs if you invest enough time in it. The drums might also be a very good instrument. You can even write poetry and turn your words into songs. The most important thing is that you're involved somehow in music.\n\nFind out which emo bands you like. There are tons of emo bands out there, each sometimes with a different musical style. Explore what styles you like and which bands sound good to you. Examples of emo bands include:\n\nNevertheless, there are tons of bands nowadays mislabeled as emo. Today, often metal music gets tagged as emo, as well as metalcore, hard rock, trancecore and others. Some bands who have been mislabeled as emo include Black Veil Brides, A7X, BFMV, BMTH, As I Lay Dying, Cannibal Corpse, Job for a Cowboy, Suicide Silence, Asking Alexandria, Attack! Attack, Devil Wears Prada, Murderdolls, Children of Bodom, Pierce the Veil, I See Stars, Green Day, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Blink-182, August Burns Red, Motionless in White, Cradle of Filth, Vampires! Everywhere, Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, For All Those Sleeping, Of Mice and Men, etc. These bands are in different genres.\n\nYou can also listen to other music. Here's a list of other genres emos can listen to.\n\nPost-hardcore (The Sleeping, Hüsker Dü, Gray Matter, Hot Water Music, At the Drive-In, Fugazi)\n\nPunk (Ramones, Misfits, Green Day [old], Alkaline Trio, Title Fight, NoFX)\n\nAlternative rock (Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Jane's Addiction, Coldplay)\n\nIndie rock (Mumfords and Sons, Of Monsters and Men, Pavement, The Strokes)\n\nHorror punk (The Misfits, AFI, Aiden, Samhain)\n\nHardcore punk (Minor Threat, Comeback Kid, Black Flag, Teen Idles, The Faith, Bad Brains)\n\nPop punk (Blink-182, New Found Glory, Sum 41, Good Charlotte, Lit, Simple Plan)\n\nRock (Avenged Sevenfold, Foo Fighters, Black Veil Brides, Nirvana)\n\nPop rock (Avril Lavigne, Forever the Sickest Kids)\n\nModern metalcore (Killswitch Engage, BMTH, BFMV, Avenged Sevenfold)\n\nFashion (optional)\n\nThere are two emo fashions: old and modern.\n\nOld\n\nWear glasses (preferably thick-rimmed with black rims)\n\nHave cropped or short hair. However, if you're female, you don't need to.\n\nWear tight jeans.\n\nIf you want, you can also have some koi-fish tattoos and/or home-made emo band patches\n\nWear chuck taylor all-star shoes\n\nTry band-shirts and sweater vests.\n\nModern\n\nIf you wear glasses, try thick-rims.\n\nWear chuck taylor all-star shoes, converse shoes or vans.\n\nGet a hair fringe: The hair will be straight and flat and will have hair covering the sides and back of the head along with medium to long length bangs. If you want, you could also dye the hair black.\n\nWear a pair of tight-fitting jeans. If you're female, you might want a pair of drainpipe jeans. If you're male, try a pair of tight jeans for guys. If you can't fit in slim jeans, just wear it simply tight.\n\nIf you want, have a mouth piercing.\n\nWear a white belt. Studded belts are recommended. If you want, you can wear more than one at the same time.\n\nWear some short-sleeved t-shirts (especially emo band shirts such as shirts of Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, Rites of Spring or Sunny Day Real Estate)\n\nIf you wear eyeliner, it should be preferably thin and tracing the eyes. You don't have to wear eyeliner though. Don't wear too much of it! Otherwise you'll look like Gene Simmons, Jake Pitts or Marilyn Manson! You can wear cherry-colored makeup if you want. Makeup, however, isn't really too common for the emo look, unlike what many think.\n\nDuring the winter, you can also wear a hoodie.\n\nTips\n\nRemember that being emo doesn't mean you must wear black. Emos, in fact, can often wear lighter colors.\n\nDon't feel like you need to wear eyeliner to look emo. Many people who dress emo, in fact, don't wear eyeliner. Especially guys. You'll notice that looking at emo boys on Google Images. You shouldn't feel forced to paint your nails black. Most emos don't paint their nails black, especially guys. It's actually quite apparent.\n\nIf you're applying eyeliner, do not be afraid to apply to the inside of the lids and under the bottom lash-line.\n\nIf someone asks you if you cut yourself or are depressed, just ignore or deny it if you don't. If they asked you, chances are, their opinions are already made and then your approval isn't going to change it much.\n\nWhen shopping, remember that you don't want anything what is too expensive. Emo really isn't about the clothing, you don't even have to go shopping to get what you need. Simple clothes are fine.\n\nRemember, if you are going to wear a band T-shirt, it should be an emo band. Bands like Black Veil Brides, Asking Alexandria, Cannibal Corpse, Arch Enemy, Make Me Famous, Green Day, Suicide Silence, etc are not emo bands, but have been tagged emo by the media.\n\nOther stuff. There isn't really any \"emo\" stuff since it was just a music genre and then nothing else. You could buy some thick rimmed glasses or wrist bands as these are common amongst emos.\n\nSome stores to get emo clothes at include Gap, Diesel and most of all, the thrift store.\n\nRead blog sites like mylifeisaverage.com and fmylife.com.\n\nTry sites like livejournal.com or myspace.com.\n\nWarnings\n\nYou may be subjected to negative criticisms by your non-emo friends and possibly the majority of society if they aren't emo, so just ignore them.\n\nDon't become emo unless it's your true self. Find your own style and expand it.\n\nDon't confuse emo with scene. Scene is just a term for the people who look kind of like Dot Dot Curve and Brokencyde. They have neon tight jeans or cigarette pants, party shades, neon colors, big hoodies and the same hair only more stylized. They like music like Blood on the Dance Floor, Breathe Carolina and 3!OH3.\n\nDon't confuse emo with goth, either. Goths are the ones who are into music like Joy Division, Samhain, The Cure or Bauhaus and their look is usually wearing more black and stuff.\n\nSome people (mostly online) will harass you for your style.\n\nIf you apply emo makeup, don't wear too much or really big makeup if the makeup is black! You will look more like Alice Cooper, Gene Simmons or Marilyn Manson.\n\nEmo is absolutely not about cutting yourself, angst or depression. It will not make you more emo.\n\nSometimes there are emo purists who restrict emo to only the origins of emo like Rites of Spring, or whatever is underground or doesn't have fans with a hair fringe or has to have punk influences. A lot will say emo is always derived from punk, then they say Sunny Day Real Estate or American Football are emo, when they obviously sound nothing like punk. Don't listen to these people. Emo was originally short for emotional hardcore or emotive hardcore, but then was remade for an alternative rock style. Even bands would derive their sound from pop punk and indie music.[1] For example, bands like Dashboard Confessional, Sunny Day Real Estate, American Football, etc tended to sound more like alternative rock and indie, while emo-pop (also known as emo pop punk) was made in the late 1990s by bands like Jimmy Eat World and The Starting Line.[2] Jimmy Eat World's Clarity album blatantly did have some pop punky tracks and Bleed American was very alike to Clarity. Then they may say that The Get-Up Kids are real emo when the band have some emo pop songs like on their 1999 album. Some say My Chemical Romance never were emo and had hardcore punk influence, despite that their first album had some similarities with old school emo and emotive hardcore. You can hear that in songs like \"Our Lady of Sorrows\", \"Skylines and Turnstiles\" or \"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us\". Some say that emo can't be mainstream. However, that's ironic because it is a genre of music, not a popularity contestant. Thus, only the music counts. Even bands like The Get-Up Kids[3][4] and Jimmy Eat World[5] were mainstream in the late 1990s and early 2000s and were really famous. Jawbreaker even got signed to a major label once. However, the band wasn't ever that mainstream. Some say it can't be because it derived from punk. However, punk actually means resisting tyranny in any form.[6] Going against whatever is mainstream isn't rebellious and it is conforming to a fad of trying to be mainstream. While these people aren't being themselves and relaxing, they are conforming to this fad and are just as mainstream-friendly as anyone else who they call out to be so. Also, ironically, punk bands like The Ramones,[7][8] The Clash[9] and The Sex Pistols[10] were mainstream and still are famous. Some modern emo bands they will say are just post-hardcore, despite that Rites of Spring and stuff actually were post-hardcore, too. In fact, post-hardcore began with bands like Fugazi, At the Drive-In and Soulside.[11][12] Many new emo bands tend to have at least a handful things in common with 1990s emo. Many modern bands combined influences of punk, alternative, post-hardcore and sometimes indie. A lot of these bands are, in fact, influenced by some hardcore and punk. Many bands tend to sound the most emo and undeniably emo in their early years. Examples include: The Used's debut album (songs like \"A Box Full of Sharp Objects\" and \"Poetic Tragedy\" work), Fall Out Boy's Take This to Your Grave or a song like \"Growing Up\" which literally sounds like Jawbreaker and a little bit of early Jimmy Eat World, My Chemical Romance's debut album which sounds super old-school and has lots of hardcore influences, Thursday's debut album, Silverstein's early work like their Summer's Stellar Gaze EP, Hawthorne Heights' demo album back when they were \"A Day in the Life\" (like songs like \"Photograph\" or \"Until Her Heart Stops\"), Alexisonfire's early work like the song .44 Caliber Love Letter, From Autumn to Ashes' debut (although it does have a little bit of metalcore influences, which is also influenced by hardcore punk), etc. Some tag certain bands as pop punk, but many bands turn out to not be even close to pop punk since pop punk refers to bands like Good Charlotte and Blink-182. Some call certain bands metalcore when they don't sound like bands like Converge or Texas in July. Also, they don't even tend to often sound like As I Lay Dying either. These bands don't have any metal influences. These people usually should be ignored. In a nutshell, emo changed just like how metal went from bands like Black Sabbath to Judas Priest to Metallica to Death to Pantera to Lamb of God and how punk went from The Ramones to Black Flag to Rancid and The Offspring and how rap went from Run DMC to Biggie Smalls to Eminem. Bands of today tend to make their own unique style of emo and emo just changed. It didn't die. There are many emo bands with an old sound today like Snowing and The Saddest Landscape.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\niPod/MP3 with emo music on it\n\nParents warned over the new EMO goth danger\n\nFlicking through the autumn glossy fashion magazines, I noticed that some of the models did not look very well.\n\nA few of them appeared to be dead. This is because one of the key looks, especially at the younger end of the fashion spectrum, is Goth.\n\nFaces are chalky white, eyes and lips black. You can wear any colour you like so long as it's black.\n\nTo achieve that just-got-out-of-acoffin look, you need corsets, capes, Celtic crosses, an unseeing stare and a prop such as a slightly mutilated china doll dragged along in one hand.\n\nFor those of us who have lived through Siouxsie And The Banshees and the Rocky Horror Show, the look is depressingly retro.\n\nFashion acknowledges those of us who lived through it first time round - Elder Goths, as opposed to Baby Bats, who are the under-30s.\n\nIt even nods to a working population, permitting Corporate Goths, who wear black trouser suits.\n\nThere is a also a term which is new to me and amounts to a much more dangerous teenage cult.\n\nThe Emos - short for Emotional - regard themselves as a cool, young sub-set of the Goths.\n\nAlthough the look is similar, the point of distinction, frightening for schools and parents, is a celebration of self harm.\n\nEmos exchange competitive messages on their teenage websites about the scars on their wrists and how best to display them. Girls' secondary schools have for some time been concerned about the increase in self harm.\n\nOne governor of a famous boarding school told me that it was as serious a problem as binge drinking, but rarely discussed for fear of encouraging more girls to do it.\n\nAlthough it is invariably described as a 'secret shame', there is actually a streak of exhibitionism about it.\n\nThe internet has many sites dedicated to Emo fashion (dyed black hair brushed over your face, layering, black, black, black), Emo bands (Green Day, My Chemical Romance), Emo conversation (sighing, wailing, poetry).\n\nThe Instant Emo Kit site gives advice on identity. Wear a child's T-shirt with a slogan such as 'Unhappy Chick' and drive a Vespa. Above all, 'show your inner despair by looking like you are too sad to eat. Obesity and emocity do not mix.'\n\nAdult Goths refer to the Emos disdainfully as 'the spooky kids' or 'moshers'.\n\nThe Emo song, by the American band Adam And Andrew, has cult status on the internet, appearing on many personal websites. It is called Dear Diary and is both witty and alarming.\n\nThe chorus goes: 'Stop my breathing and slit my throat, I must be an Emo.\n\nI don't jump around when I go to shows, I must be an Emo.\n\nDye in my hair and polish on my toes, I must be an Emo. I play guitar and write suicide notes, I must be an Emo.'\n\nThe courting of misery and death is a long-established teenage tradition. How many bedroom walls have been plastered with posters of drippy pre-Raphaelite heroines, or Marc Bolan or Kurt Curbain?\n\nWhen death is a long way off, you can afford to be more morbid about it.\n\nFilm-makers note that horror films are now more popular than romance among young women.\n\nIn particular, Goths and Emos are a rebellion against sporty, manly cultures - which is perhaps why they flourish particularly in North European countries or North America.\n\nThe androgynous nature of the Goths is appealing to the young because it is sexually unthreatening.\n\nTeenage girls are frightened of manliness: they like boys who look like girls. Kate Moss, the girl who never grows old, understands youthful taste completely.\n\nThere is also a deadly glamour about the Goths. The word femme-fatale is Goth based.\n\nMany of the alluring women of our time - Nigella Lawson, Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Lily Allen - have a touch of the Goth about them.\n\nThey have a sophistication and depth lacking in the blonde, bouncy chav faces which dominate our television screens and nightclubs.\n\nWho are the male pin-ups for young girls? Johnny Depp and the comedian Russell Brand, who is about 90 per cent Goth. Lord Byron, of course, was the greatest Goth of all time.\n\nEmos have a strong arts graduate bias and are among the few that read poetry (if only of the romantic, morbid kind).\n\nSome pretty terrible Emo poetry is offered on websites. A cartoon of two Emos has a bubble which says: 'What rhymes with razor blade?'\n\nBut compared to the music, the poetry is positively cheerful. The Gothic bands have names such as Bloody, Dead And Sexy or Colder Than Death.\n\nThere is a genre, popular in Germany, known as Death Pop. Bands include The Knives In The Attic and Love Equals Death.\n\nAlthough Goths are from the same family tree as punks, they are a lot less fun to be with. While I loved punk for its energy, Goths were too bloodless to lift a finger.\n\nOne of the most annoying characteristics of teenagers is their refusal to open their curtains. Their world is dark and airless.\n\nIf this environment is coupled with the psychological traits of self-pity, introspection, self-dramatisation and hormone imbalance, you have a fully-fledged Emo, even without the small Tshirt and black hair.\n\nThe wondrous thing about being an adult is that you have so much more to worry about that you stop striking poses and get on with it.\n\nUnless you are an Elder Goth - in which case you have fashion on your side and everybody else against you.\n\nWhat worries me is that teenagers are less equipped to manage strong emotions and a cult of suicide could have real and horrible consequences.\n\nIt is irresponsible for the fashion and music cultures to encourage it. If you want retro style, I recommend Ian Dury's song Reasons To Be Cheerful.\n\nSource: www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-400953/EMO-cult-warning-parents.html\n\nHistory - Opinions Differ\n\n1. Short for \"emotive\". Coined by Ian MacKaye, commonly known from Fugazi and Minor Threat.\n\n2. Type of music characterized by heartfelt, although sometimes whiny lyrics.\n\n3. Person who listens to afformentioned type of music. Stereotypically wears too-small sweaters and tight jeans, black horn-rimmed glasses, and straight black hair, although this is not always true. Sometimes a vegan, sometimes straight edge.\n\nThe Music\n\nIn the early 90s there was a movement in the hardcore genre that came to be known as \"Emotive Hardcore,\" spearheaded by Rites Of Spring. Harder-core-than-thou kids, who swore by Dischord Records a la Minor Threat, actually coined the term \"Emo\" as something of a put-down for the kids who really liked Rites Of Spring, Indian Summer and this new wave of \"Emotive\" Hardcore bands. That's right, \"Emo\" was once not something kids called themselves. The field exploded outwards from there - Level-Plane Records has always been the most famous Emo label. Acts like Yaphet Kotto, I Hate Myself, Saetia, Hot Cross, A Day In Black And White, Funeral Diner, I Would Set Myself On Fire For You, You And I, and hosts of others came in the next decade. Most emo bands have since broken up, but there's still the occasional hold-out (again, the majority of Level-Plane Records' roster has been a procession of emo acts). Like most DIY hardcore/punk of the time, a majority found its way onto vinyl and not much else. Some people consider bands like Fugazi, and later Sunny Day Real Estate, a progression of emo.\n\nOften, more recently, this gets intertwined with post-hardcore, and understandably so - that's nothing to make an issue of at least it's close.\n\nSince the late 90s, though, bands have been emerging in the vein of Taking Back Sunday, Dashboard Confessional, and the thousands of their clones. As far as I can tell, some lazy journalist somewhere, writing an article about them, decided \"Well, no one knows what emo is anyway, so I'll call these bands \"emo\" - sounds more appealing than bubblegum pop rock...\" and the spiral continued downwards into the current amalgomation of bands MTV has told everyone is \"emo.\"\n\nSomehow, people decided that \"emo\" meant \"emotional,\" which is obviously not true, as 99% of bands make music to illicit emotion, which would make \"emotional\" a completely all-encompassing genre from classical to opera to pop to rap.\n\nSource: www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emo # 6 definition half-way down\n\nThe Difference between Emo And Goth\n\nEmos Hate themselves. Goths hate Everyone\n\nEmos Want to Kill themselves. Goths Want to kill Everyone\n\nEmo is a somewhat ambiguous, controversial slang term most frequently used to describe a fashion or subculture which is usually defined to have roots in punk fashion and subculture, as well as some attributes of gothic fashion and subculture. It is loosely defined, and its meaning varies by region, but most definitions share a number of similarities.\n\nSome definitions of emo hold that typical \"emo persons\" are likely to inflict self-injury, most often by means of cutting, burning, or otherwise mutilating themselves. The theme of self-injury is also common in emo poetry.\n\nGrammar\n\nAs a slang word, \"emo\" is not defined by standard English dictionaries, and thus, its grammatical usage is not either. In popular usage, it can be used as either a noun or adjective.[\n\nExamples of usage\n\nAdjective (1): All my friends are emo.\n\nAdjective (2): I feel emo today.\n\nNoun: Sally is such an emo.\n\nSelf-Injury\n\nSelf-injury (SI) or Self-harm (SH) is deliberate injury inflicted by a person upon his or her own body. Some scholars use more technical definitions related to specific aspects of this behavior. These acts may be aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable emotions, sensations of unreality and numbness. Self-injury is generally considered a social taboo. It is listed in the DSM-IV-TR as a symptom of borderline personality disorder and is sometimes associated with mental illness, a history of trauma and abuse, eating disorders, or mental traits such as low self-esteem or perfectionism. There is a positive statistical correlation between self-injury and emotional abuse.[\n\nSource: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-injury\n\nDress\n\nSome pointers about emo fashions:\n\nThe Emo Romulan look - short, thick, greasy, dyed-black hair with bangs cut straight across the forehead, and cut high over the ears or hair covering half of the face.\n\nactually, any greasy dyed black hair. Bangs in front and spikes in back is very emo too.\n\nhorn-rim glasses, or at least thick black frames.\n\nbald head, furry face (boys only). Goes especially well with horn-rims.\n\nheavy slacks, often too tight and short.\n\nthin, too-small polyester button-ups in dark colors, or threadbare children's size t-shirts with random slogans. Button the collar if you've got one.\n\nclunky black shoes\n\nscarves\n\ngas station jackets. This has diffused a lot over the years though, it's no longer exclusive to emo kids. Nowadays, you may want to select a nice corduroy denim jacket.\n\nalso classic outerwear but quickly diffusing to normality: the famous Blue Peacoat\n\nbarrettes on boys\n\nmake-up (male or female)\n\ntoo-small cardigans and v-neck sweaters\n\nargyle\n\nanorexic thinness. Veganism helps here.\n\nSource: www.fourfa.com/"
