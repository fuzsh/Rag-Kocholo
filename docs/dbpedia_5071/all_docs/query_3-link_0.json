        "text": "When asked to think of the word “emo,” one may imagine a black-haired teen wearing a band tee, dark skinny jeans, and too much eyeliner. While this style of dress dominated the 2000s emo era, not all emos fit this stereotype.\n\nBorn from punk rock, emo is known for its raw, passionate lyricism, sensitivity, and emotional vulnerability. The popularity of emo music has ebbed and flowed over the years, but the recent reemergence of bands such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Paramore proves that there is still a place for emo in popular culture. From emo rap to screamo, emo has inspired many subgenres and continues to influence today’s most famous musicians.\n\nEmo, then known as emocore, first appeared in Washington D.C.’s hardcore punk scene in the 1980s. Cited as the first emo act, Rites of Spring took inspiration from the punk band Minor Threat and expanded upon hardcore conventions by combining rock with deep, sentimental lyrics. For instance, in “For Want Of,” vocalist Guy Picciotto expresses his pain through the use of melancholic imagery: “I - I bled / I tried to hide the heart from the head / I - I bled / in the arms of a girl I'd barely met.” While their legacy today is largely forgotten, Rites of Spring’s willingness to experiment pushed other D.C.-based bands to follow suit during the Revolution Summer of 1985.\n\nBy 1986, most emo bands associated with the D.C. scene had broken up. The emo subculture, however, was brewing in other major U.S. cities. In New York City, punk band Jawbreaker expanded on Rites of Spring’s approach to lyricism and developed a cult following in the process. Lead singer Blake Schwarzenbach’s lyrics brimmed with personal and metaphorical musings and introduced poetry to the punk world.\n\nIn the 90s, emo, overshadowed by other punk genre derivatives, remained underground. During this period, punk rock and grunge went mainstream due to the success of Nirvana’s sophomore album, Nevermind. Bands such as Green Day were propelled into the spotlight, and many punk and alternative rock records were certified platinum. Meanwhile, Weezer released Pinkerton, a moody, genre-defining album about disenchantment, and the Midwest became a hotspot for the emo scene.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, record labels like Deep Elm Records and Drive-Thru Records helped increase emo’s popularity by signing lesser-known artists and selling band merchandise in Hot Topic. Notably, Vagrant Records used the internet and extensive touring schedules to market emo to wider audiences, benefitting bands like Dashboard Confessional and Saves The Day. Warped Tour, a traveling alternative rock festival, also played a vital role in bringing emo to the masses until it became defunct in 2019.\n\nBy the time MySpace popped up in the mid-2000s, emo had become more than just a music genre. Teenagers began to adopt the aesthetic of bands like Panic! At the Disco and Bring Me The Horizon and nurtured the development of subcultures such as scene. Emo became the parent genre of screamo, emo rap, and pop punk and continued to influence related genres. By the late-2000s, pop punk acts like Paramore, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, and My Chemical Romance became the face of the emo scene. Famous songs such as “Misery Business,” “Dance, Dance,” and “I Write Sins Not Tragedies'' rose to the top of the charts and were universally loved by old and new fans. In particular, My Chemical Romance’s The Black Parade may be considered the quintessential emo album, and “Welcome to the Black Parade” may be the quintessential song. Opening with an iconic G note, “Welcome to the Black Parade” represented the culmination of the 2000s emo movement; soon after its release, the public began to reject emo because of its association with self-harm and suicide.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the return of emo to the underground. Most emo bands rejected the emo label, segued into a different genre, or disbanded. Despite this, bands like Modern Baseball and Title Fight attempted to revive emo in the 2010s; they emulated the original emo icons of the 90s and made emo more inclusive by combining it with other genres such as math rock and shoegaze.\n\nWhile emo fizzled out, some of its derivative genres gained recognition. Emo rap materialized from SoundCloud rap, a lo-fi version of hip-hop popularized on the music platform SoundCloud. Precursors of emo rappers, including Gym Class Heroes, collaborated with hip-hop artists and pop-punk bands to produce music inspired by both genres in the 2000s. A decade later, Bones and Yung Lean pioneered emo rap, but groups such as GothBoiClique made the genre thrive. Lil Peep, GothBoiClique’s most famous member, rebranded emo for contemporary audiences by rapping about depression, drug use, and other intimate topics. As a result, music critics believed he represented the future of emo, but his career ended abruptly; Lil Peep died from an overdose in 2017. With his death, as well as the deaths of other prominent emo rappers like XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD, emo rap disappeared from the limelight.\n\nWhen the music industry thought emo was finally dead, Machine Gun Kelly appeared. While transitioning from rap to pop punk, MGK collaborated with established and emerging emo musicians. In 2022, he released “Emo Girl” in collaboration with WILLOW; the song, while integral to the 2020s pop-punk revival, was described as generic and hollow by critics. Other artists like Olivia Rodrigo, with her hit single “Good 4 U,” and Origami Angel also paid homage to pop-punk.\n\nEmo rap inspired the resurfacing of 2000s emo fashion; scenesters evolved into e-girls and e-boys, for better or worse. While e-kids originated from Tumblr, they became popular on TikTok and were identifiable by their kawaii-style makeup and bleached stripe hair.\n\nThroughout its four-decade history, emo has reinvented itself to stay relevant. While emo music and fashion have never looked the same, one character facet has always remained: its expression of personal thoughts and feelings, no matter how dark. This ability to be vulnerable and expressive has profoundly impacted its listeners, proving that there will always be a need for emo, regardless of its form."
