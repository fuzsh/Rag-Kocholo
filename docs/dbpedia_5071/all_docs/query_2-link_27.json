        "text": "My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and Panic at the Disco. The Emo Trinity once coined by Tumblr users and has gone through the ‘bandoms’ over the years. I was once one of these users. I called myself emo because, well, I listened to these bands. I would wear my oversized sweater, black converses, and had my thousands of band bracelets on my wrist. I was under the impression that this was the definition of emo. Whenever I would search emo on Tumblr, a girl with heavy eyeliner and a band tee would appear. This was the set norm for me. Like everybody, my emo phase disappeared. I still wore band tees and skinny black jeans, but I didn’t have those bracelets from Hot Topic. I wasn’t reblogging fanfic or making cringy memes. I never questioned, if I was truly in a emo phase. Until, I found myself listening to bands like Midwest Pen Pals, Chinese Football, and Niiice, all tagged under the genre : emo. Wait, what? This doesn’t sound like Fall Out Boy, not even Panic. I found myself lost but finally asked myself :\n\nWhat really is emo?\n\nEmo 101-ish\n\nTo understand where did the emo genre originated from, we must start from the beginning. During the 1980’s, post-hardcore group from Washington, D.C. Rites of Spring came about. Their lyrics became the stomping grounds for the emo scene. Magazines, such as Thrasher, often referenced to them as ‘emo-core’, a mix of emotional expressed lyrics with influence from post-hardcore. Many bands rejected the term as it didn’t define them as a whole. With the 80’s coming to an end, many emo-core bands started to fall apart but new groups appeared. Emo-core dropped the core and was politely called Emo. The genre spread as fast as wildfire and hit all over the United States, especially the Midwest. This birthed the subgenre of Emo known as Midwest Emo. What often distingish Midwest Emo from regular Emo music was the genres distants from it’s post-hardcore roots and more of a softer tone. Many groups drifted from the post-hardcore elements of Emo and shifted to a more softer, yet raspy vocals to suit their sound. Bands like The Get Up Kids and Sunny Day Real Estates became the voice of a new generation. However, Emo started to mix with other genres such as Math Rock.\n\nThe 90’s came and went. The 2000’s became the third wave of emo-sort of. The 2000’s was filled with teen angst and break up songs. Pop-Punk started to receive more attention yet it couldn’t fill the void of a broken teenagers heart. Until, Brand New and Jimmy Eat World hit the scene. Their emotional lyrics and poppy sound hit the hearts of every teenager. However, they didn’t stick to the emo quota. Pop was far from what Emo was but it seems it opened a new subgenre, Emo-Pop. As Pop-Punk bands blasted through the radios, MTV took part in this new scene and played music videos or concerts from emo influenced bands. At this time, My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy were also popular in the music scene. They were receiving attention from MTV, radio stations, and MySpace.\n\nThe birth of all the scene kids and their misunderstanding of the term Emo. The heavy eyeliner, skinny black jeans, and badly cut side bangs defined the Emo genre as a culture. Granted, it is a culture but not represented like this. Heavily, the Emo scene was defined as a bunch of sad teenagers looking awkward and posting depressing lyrics as their captions. However, this was far from the actual Emo scene. MySpace, MTV, and any media outlet defined Emo as anything emotional and/or anything appearing to be emotional. My Chemical Romance had the intense and sad lyrics present in their sound, however, Three Cheers and The Black Parade didn’t fully present the emo culture. You can argue Bullets has some emo influence but we’re not getting ourselves too deep, are we? The same can go to Fall Out Boy but they present more as Pop-Punk, especially in their early work. Here’s when it gets tricky. During the same time, Panic! At The Disco was also making its rounds in the Emo scene. However, they aren’t remotely even considered Emo. They are Pop-Punk, with a mix of Pop Rock and Alternative. Again, the media portrayed Panic! as Emo due to the bands attire. The guy-liner, the side bangs, everything. The same can be said for Fall Out Boy. Pete Wentz was defined as the Emo Dad with his jet black hair, guy-liner, and attire. This became the desired look for many teenagers going through their Emo phase. They were given the norm that this was Emo. This is what defined Emo to a whole. Even now, there’s still teenagers going through their Emo phase but with a twist. Now, a lot of current Emo teens consider Twenty One Pilots as part of the Emo quartet. Even in this Rolling Stones article, My Chemical Romance is the face for one of the greatest Emo albums.\n\nThe Emo scene has gone through some changes in it’s sound, culture, and meaning. Emo wasn’t meant to be set in stone genre, of course it was going to have subgenres. The culture behind it as been twisted and turned so many times that it’s lost the meaning behind why the genre was born. The raw and powerful emotions of the lyrics, the heavy guitar, and the raspy or soft voice defined the genre as a whole. Now, Emo has sort of found its way back home. With bands like Midwest Pen Pals and La Dispute defined the Emo sound to a new level. Midwest with their Midwestern Emo sound and heart-rending lyrics gave new emotions for the subgenre. La Dispute debuted with their spoken-word Emo sound.\n\nRecently, Emo has influenced the rap scene and inspired upcoming artists. Late rapper Lil Peep has mentioned that Emo music made a big difference in his music and even samples of Emo songs are present in his songs. Emo is evolving as we speak. New bands are constantly influenced by the past and present of Emo yet they will add their own twist to it. Teens experiencing their Emo phase are still under the mindset that their Hot Topic band is the definition of Emo. However, I was once them and I discovered what Emo really meant. Yet, Emo won’t have a set in stone definition. For now, we can listen to the founding fathers and their precursors on what was the stepping stone for Emo."
