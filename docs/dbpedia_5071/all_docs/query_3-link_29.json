        "text": "Just for fun, think of your favorite Emo (they may call themselves Punk, but don’t be fooled - The Clash was Punk, Good Charlotte is Emo) group and add the following to the end of their song titles “, Mom!”\n\nWorks great for Panic! At the Disco and Fallout Boy.\n\nI Write Sins, not Tragedies, Mom!\n\nBut it’s Better if You Do, Mom!\n\nThe Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage, Mom!\n\nMy Songs Know What You Did in the Dark, Mom!\n\nOur Lawyer Made Us Change the Name of this Song so We Wouldn’t Get Sued, Mom!\n\nSorry, it’s been a slow day…\n\nDeclaration: Massive Emo/Post-Hardcore guy.\n\nLove the mom add. Esp when added to something like MCR!!!\n\nMost ‘emo’ breaks down into about 4 or so categories.\n\nEmo-Pop - This is the emo that everyone has actually heard, sadly, and is easily the worst of it all =/ Panic, Good Charlotte, FOB, Ataris, Click Five, even MCR.\n\nEmo-Punk/Mid - This is your Yellowcard, most of the other Christian Emo, TBS, even AFI and The Used tend to fall closer to this than to the following.\n\nEmo-PostHardcore - Screamo. Underoath, Bring Me The Horizon, and is easily the largest group. Too many to name.\n\nEmo-Sad - This is what everyone ‘thinks’ is emo. Dashboard Confessional, Jacks Manaquin, your whiny type.\n\nThere are a few outliers. Jimmy Eat World being the influence that it was and depending on the album, floats around. You’ve got your slightly satirical ones too, Blink-182 and Bowling for Soup, but they can fall under Emo-Pop.\n\nRecently, you have two semi-new types showing up.\n\nElectroni-core - Enter Shikari mainly. Jaime’s Elsewhere and Attack Attack! have taken massive influence from these guys. I’m excited to see where this one goes, as I love the hybridization of both genres.\n\nMelodic-Emo - Mainly Sleeping with Sirens and Pierce the Veil. This is what you get when you combine Beiber with emo. I dig Pierce the Veil, and Sleeping with Sirens is growing on me.\n\nI will now state something blasphemous: We would have none of this if not for Nirvana. Poor guy, prolly rolling in his grave. Don’t get me wrong, there was plenty of punk music before him, but none of it left as big of impact on the music scene as Nirvana did, nor as emotionally negative up until Kurt. RIP.\n\nWhat music scene are you talking about? Pop(ular) MTV-crowd music? Ok, I can give you that one, given all of the bands you mentioned. But, the independent American rock scene in the late 80’s to 90’s, no way.\n\nAgain, I’m the old man who was around for the 1st wave, and participated in the 2nd wave of “emo”, and would never call any of those bands emo. In fact, the originators hated the term, and we actually stopped using that word by 1995. (By the way, isn’t all music emotional?)\n\nI’m going to continue to shake my fist at you youngsters for not knowing your history\n\nWe all started somewhere. I just happen to be very passionate about these styles and the scenes, I’ve been involved in them for just shy of 2 decades now so like you, I get passionate and like to discuss things. I’m not trying to belittle anyone’s tastes or anything at all, just disagreeing with certain classifications. When it comes down to it, you could call everything you listen to eclecto-punk-mardi-gras for all I care, at the end of the day it only matters if you’re passionate about it.\n\nI think the mistake was classifying bands to begin with, it kinda opens those doors - if we just took song titles period, you can make them pretty entertaining no matter what genre the band happens to fall under. I’d argue other genres can be even more entertaining. Example:\n\nJay-Z - “Show me what you got, mom!”\n\nDisturbing? Yes. Wrong? Yes."
