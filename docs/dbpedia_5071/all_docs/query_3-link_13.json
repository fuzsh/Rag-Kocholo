        "text": "List of notable musical artists associated with the music genre and/or subculture of emo\n\nThis is a list of notable musical artists associated with the music genre and/or subculture of emo.\n\nEmo is a style of rock music characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as \"emotional hardcore\" or \"emocore\" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts had emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.\n\nEmo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the sales success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, with the genre's popularity continuing in the mid-to-late 2000s with bands such as My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.\n\nList\n\nSee also\n\nList of screamo bands\n\nList of emo pop bands\n\nList of post-hardcore bands\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nGreenwald, Andy (2003).
