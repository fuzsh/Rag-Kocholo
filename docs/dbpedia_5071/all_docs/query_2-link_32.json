        "text": "History\n\nEmo\n\nEmo first was a subgenre of post-hardcore and stood for emotional hardcore (or emocore). It began in 1985 in DC and Maryland with bands like Rites of Spring, Embrace, The Hated, Policy of 3 and Moss Icon, who tended to be signed to the punk label Dischord Records. Emo began in June 1985 as Rites of Spring took the punk and hardcore style and influence of post-hardcore bands like Hüsker Dü and The Minutemen and some inspiration from DC hardcore bands like Minor Threat with lyrics full of emotion. Dischord Records owner Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi) then went to form his emo band Embrace. Many of these bands shortly were around. Then Guy Picciotto from Rites of Spring joined Ian MacKaye's post-hardcore band Fugazi.\n\nEmo kind of died out in the early 1990s, even though the band Policy of 3 was still around. Although, Jawbreaker, a regular punk rock band, became more emotional during their second album. Their last album \"Dear You\" was instead 100% emo.\n\nWhile emo was faded, in the 1990s, emo instead was remade. During the 1990s, bands who were part of the regeneration of emo sounded nothing like punk rock and more like indie rock (Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, Braid, Texas is the Reason) or pop punk (Jimmy Eat World, The Get Up Kids, Midtown). In the early 2000s, emo became popular with bands like The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional. Then many more emo bands got some fame. Some of these bands originally started off with an old-school emo sound. For example, My a Chemical Romance first sounded like Rites of Spring and Texas is the Reason on their debut, then became popular with their second album \"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\" which was where they made their own style of emo. They later on went more pop punk. Some of these bands, such as Silverstein even fused post-hardcore with indie rock or played both. Emo pop then became popular with bands like Fall Out Boy, who had one EP that sounded like Jawbreaker, but then went more poppy with their debut album. Paramore, another band, began with an indie rock-emo sound but on their second album as they became mainstream they became emo pop. Another band, The Used, originally had a 1990s emo style with some screaming and influences from screamo but then changed. The band Hawthorne Heights, an emo band originally called \"A Day in the Life\", released their debut album \"The Silence in Black and White\", which had lots of 90s indie rock/post-hardcore/emo characteristics with some screaming. By their second album, they grew more poppy and even more with the third album. When it comes to emo purism, emo purists tend to reject newer emo as emo, as 1980s emo fans rejected 1990s emo as emo for not sounding punk enough.\n\nScreamo\n\nScreamo was a hardcore punk-influenced genre of emocore which had some screaming in it. It began in 1991 in San Diego with the band \"Heroin\". Many 1990s screamo bands were nicknamed \"skramz\". Other screamo bands include Saetia, The Saddest Landscape, Neil Perry, Pg. 99, Orchid, I Hate Myself and Antiotch Arrow.\n\nScene\n\nScene first was used for a Chav subculture that was around in the late 1990s in United Kingdom. In the mid to late 2000s, it changed completely. Instead, it was a label for people who had straight, crazy hair with a fringe (sometimes dyed bright colors), neon clothing, gauges, baseball caps, tattoos (guys), makeup (girls only), neon skinny jeans, hoodies, sunglasses, slogan shirts, hair spray, etc. Scene then became a fad in around 2009.\n\nMusic\n\nEmo bands/artists\n\nSunny Day Real Estate\n\nFinch\n\nRites of Spring\n\nHawthorne Heights\n\nThe Get Up Kids\n\nThe Movielife\n\nSuch Gold\n\nAlkaline Trio\n\nJawbreaker\n\nEmbrace\n\nMoss Icon\n\nThe Hated\n\nThe Saddest Landscape\n\nMatchbook Romance\n\nJimmy Eat World\n\nAmerican Football\n\nMidtown\n\nDashboard Confessional\n\nWeezer\n\nBrand New\n\nSaves the Day\n\nThursday\n\nThe Promise Ring\n\nSenses Fail\n\nSaetia\n\nSmall Brown Bike\n\nTexas is the Reason\n\nBraid\n\nMineral\n\n\"Scene\" music\n\nAlthough scene isn't really a type of music.
