Spade money (Chinese: 布幣 or bù bì) is a rare form of early Chinese proto-money that entered the historical record around 1200 BCE, before the widespread adoption of coins in China.

They demonstrate a link between bartering with farming tools and the use of true money, as early forms of spade money were meant to resemble functional tools and even included sockets to be fitted onto wood handles. Gradually though, spade money became thinner, flatter, and less utilitarian, a path that would lead to the evolution of standard coinage.

Spade money was abolished in favor of Ban Liang coins during the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE. However, the currency was briefly reintroduced during the Xin dynasty under the rule of Wang Mang, who seized China from the Han dynasty for about 14 years. The piece of spade money shown in this listing comes from this time period.
