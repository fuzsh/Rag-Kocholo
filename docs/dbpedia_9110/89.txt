The Xin Dynasty (9 A.D. to 23 A.D) was created when Wang Mang killed the previous ruler, 13 year old Emperor Ping, with poisoned wine. Mang was considered by some an influential leader who introduced modernistic ideas of both public and private economies, outlawed slavery and introduced income tax during his short rule. He also strived to simplify and modernize the monetary system by demonetizing all previous coinage and had these copper/bronze “cash” coins produced. These quarter sized coins with a square hole in the center were convenient to use and were contemporary with the Roman Imperial coinage of Augustus and Tiberius. We offer nice examples of this 2,000 year old coin.
