        "text": "Guide to Reading Chinese Characters on Coins and Charms\n\nOne of the biggest problems a coin or charm collector faces is trying to decipher Chinese characters so as to identify a coin or to understand the purpose and meaning of a charm.\n\nThe following is a guide or primer for non-Chinese readers which should help you to determine how the Chinese characters on the coin or charm should be read in the proper order.\n\nOnce the correct sequence of characters has been determined, a comprehensive listing of charm inscriptions with English translation is provided to give you the meaning of the inscription or legend.\n\nIf you already know how to read Chinese coins and charms and are only looking for a translation, please refer directly to this list of inscriptions.\n\nHow to Read the Characters (Symbols) on a Chinese Coin\n\nMost Chinese coins are round with a square hole and have four Chinese characters on the obverse side.\n\nThe old coin at the left is an example of a typical Chinese cash coin which was cast during the Qing (Ch'ing) Dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD).\n\nIt has four Chinese characters (symbols). The characters on a typical Chinese coin are read in the following order: top, bottom, right, left.\n\nThe inscription (legend) on this coin would therefore be read as 康 (character at top), 熙 (character at bottom), 通 (character at right) and 寶 (character at left).\n\nIf you were to write these characters on one line you would write them from left to right as: 康熙通寶 (This particular coin, incidentally, has a very interesting history which is discussed at Ancient Chinese Coins with Charm Features.)\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, the character at the top and bottom refer to the \"period title\" (nianhao 年号) of the emperor under which the coin was cast. In this example, the \"period title\" is \"康熙\" (top character and bottom character) which means the coin was minted during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (kangxi 康熙) of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn a few cases, the inscription is read clockwise beginning at the top which means the \"period title\" characters would be the top and right characters.\n\nThe other two characters (usually the right and left) on the coin have the general meaning of \"currency\" and do not really need to be translated.\n\nHowever, if you wish to be very literal in your translation, these two \"currency\" characters can be translated as follows:\n\n通寶 \"universal currency\" or \"circulating currency\" (pronounced tong bao)\n\n元寶 \"original currency\" (pronounced yuan bao)\n\n重寶 \"heavy currency\" (pronounced zhong bao)\n\n(For an interesting story on the origin of these terms for \"currency\", please see the bottom of this page.)\n\nOn the above coin, the two characters meaning \"currency\" are the right (通) and left (寶) characters. The literal translation would thus be \"universal currency\" (tong bao 通寶).\n\nAs mentioned above, the inscriptions on a few coins are read clockwise beginning with the top character. In these cases, the two characters indicating \"currency\" would be the bottom and left characters.\n\nHow to Identify a Chinese Coin\n\nChinese cash coins (round copper or bronze coins with a square hole in the middle) were made for more than 2,000 years. There are hundreds of different types with thousands of varieties.\n\nOf course, those who can read Chinese and are familiar with Chinese coins, or have reference books available, can easily identify a particular coin.\n\nIdentifying a Chinese coin can be a real challenge, however, if you cannot read Chinese and are not an experienced collector.\n\nIf you are not an \"expert\" but happen to have an old Chinese cash coin and would like to know a little more about it, the following simple guidelines may be helpful.\n\nIt is very likely that your coin is one of these common types:\n\nIf the coin has a character that looks like a coiled line or curlique similar to the character at the left then the coin is from the Qing (Ch'ing) Dynasty (1644-1911).\n\nThis character (\"boo\") is written not in Chinese but in the Manchu script. \"Boo\" translates as \"building\". However, when used in the inscription of Qing dynasty coins the character is a transliteration of the Chinese character bao (å®) meaning \"treasure\".\n\nSome coins produced at the end of this dynasty were copper instead of bronze and were stamped by machines instead of cast in molds.\n\nPlease see Qing Dynasty Coins for examples of these coins along with historical information.\n\nIf the coin has the Chinese character 開, such as the example at the left, then it is a kai yuan tong bao (開元通寶) from the Tang Dynasty (618-907).\n\nImages and more information on this coin may be seen at Tang Dynasty Coins.\n\nIf the coin has only two characters and one of the characters resembles an hourglass or an \"X\" with a horizontal line on top and bottom then it is a wu zhu (五銖) coin most likely from the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD).\n\nWu zhu coins were actually made over a period of about 700 years.\n\nMany examples of this coin may be seen at Wu Zhu Coins.\n\nFinally, if your coin is not one of the above then there is a very high probability that it is from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).\n\nPlease see examples at Northern Song Coins and detailed historical information at Chinese Coins.\n\nHow to Read the Characters (Symbols) on a Chinese Charm\n\nSimilarly, most Chinese charms and amulets are also round with a square hole and have four Chinese characters on their obverse side.\n\nSince charms and amulets are not legally circulating coins, most do not include the two \"currency\" characters mentioned above.\n\nThe old charm to the left is a typical Chinese charm most likely cast during the Qing (Ch'ing) Dynasty. As is the case with the above cash coin, there are four Chinese characters (symbols) which are read in exactly the same way, i.e. top, bottom, right, left.\n\nThe legend would therefore be read as 天 (top), 下 (bottom), 太 (right) and 平 (left).\n\nWritten out on a single line from left to right the inscription would be 天下太平.\n\n(This specific charm is discussed in detail at Ancient Chinese Peace Charms).\n\nHow to Find the Meaning of the Inscription\n\nTo help you understand the meanings of Chinese character (symbol) inscriptions or legends, I have created a list entitled Chinese Charm Inscriptions which includes many of the most common inscriptions you will see on Chinese charms and amulets.\n\nA very small part of the list is shown at the bottom of this page for instructional purposes.\n\nI considered several ways to group or categorize the inscriptions but all of these methods seemed to just complicate the matter.\n\nUsing the above example let us try to find the meaning of 天下太平.\n\nThe first column in the partial list below is \"Charm Inscription\" (\"Charm Inscript\").\n\nIn our example, this would be the Chinese characters in the order we determined: 天下太平.\n\nYou should scan down the \"Charm Inscription\" column looking for any inscription that begins with the first character of the inscription. In this example the first character is 天.\n\nOn the second row down you will see an inscription that begins with 天.\n\nIf you look at the second character of this entry you will discover that it is 官 which is not the second character (下) of our charm's legend.\n\nTherefore, you must continue searching down the list.\n\nOn Row 3 you will find that the first character is 天 and the second character is 下.\n\nYou will also see that the third character (太) and the fourth character (平) are exactly the same as those of our charm.\n\nTherefore, we have found the correct entry and the English translation in the fourth column says the meaning is \"Peace under heaven\".\n\nThere are many charms which have the same Chinese character(s) at the beginning so it is important to make sure that you find the one with all the characters in the proper sequence.\n\nThe second and third columns in the table are simply to provide you with a little additional information.\n\nThe second column is \"Simplified Chinese\" (\"Simplify Chinese\"). In order to make learning a little easier for the Chinese people, some of the more complicated Chinese characters which take many strokes to write have been \"simplified\" to have fewer strokes.\n\n\"Simplified Chinese\" is the Chinese now used in China. You will see that in most cases the \"charm inscription\", which uses the old traditional way of writing characters and is still in use today in Hong Kong and Taiwan, is the same or very similar to the \"simplified\" version.\n\nThe third column provides the pronunciation (\"Pronun.\")of the inscription or legend using pinyin which is the romanization system used in China\n\nThe fourth column, as you have seen, provides the translation (\"Translate\").\n\nHow to read Two Character and Eight Character Inscriptions\n\nReading an inscription with two characters follows the same basic rules as reading a four character inscription.\n\nIn the example to the left, the characters should be read top to bottom: 福壽\n\nTo find the meaning you would search the first column looking for an entry beginning with 福 and with the second entry as 壽.\n\nIf you are successful in your search (Row 4), you should find that the meaning is \"happiness and longevity\".\n\nThis charm is discussed in more detail at gourd charms.\n\nSome charms and amulets have eight character (symbol) inscriptions such as the example at the left.\n\nIn reality, these are just two inscriptions of four characters each.\n\nTherefore, you would use the same technique we have just learned except that you will be doing it twice, once for each of the four character inscriptions.\n\nSince the inscription is circular with equal spacing between characters the problem is discovering which Chinese character is the first character in either of the inscriptions.\n\nThere is no period, comma, or other punctuation to give you a clue.\n\nThis is not really unusual since ancient Chinese texts actually use no punctuation as we know it. Basically, you will just have to keep guessing and trying different characters to see which one successfully begins one of the four-character inscriptions in the list.\n\nThe only advice I can give as to discovering which is the first character in either of the two four-character inscriptions is to try to determine the \"top\" of the charm.\n\nIn the example to the left, you would not be able to decide this by looking at this side of the charm.\n\nIf you are fortunate, however, the other side of the charm may have pictures which would help you determine the \"top\".\n\nAlso, please note that on this particular charm all the Chinese characters are written with the bottom of the character at the outside rim and the top of the character at the round hole in the middle. As you hold this charm, only the Chinese character at the very bottom will be upright and in the proper position to read. To read the next character, just rotate the charm counterclockwise so that the next character is at the very bottom of the charm.\n\nIn this example, one of the four character inscriptions begins at the 12 o'clock position. Reading clockwise, the four characters are 長命富貴.\n\nFollowing this inscription and continuing to read clockwise you will find that the second four-character inscription is 金銀滿堂.\n\nAccording to the list of translations, the first four characters (Row 5) mean \"longevity, wealth and honor\" and the second four characters (row 6, not row 1) mean \"may gold and silver fill your halls\".\n\nPlease note that the second inscription (金銀滿堂) on this charm is found on Row 6 of the list and is slightly different from the inscription on Row 1 (金玉滿堂).\n\nThe only difference is the second character so it is important to make sure that all the characters are correct in their proper order.\n\nIn this particular example we were very \"lucky\" that one of the four character inscriptions began at the very top of the charm. In many cases this will not be the case and you will just have to try starting with another character until you are successful.\n\nThe reverse side of this charm happens to be most interesting. Please see \"Eight Character Charms\" at Charms with Auspicious Inscriptions for the discussion.\n\nHow to Read Inscriptions Written Horizontally\n\nTo the left is a lock charm with five Chinese characters (symbols). There are actually two inscriptions. One inscription is composed of the two smaller characters at the upper right (三) and the upper left (仙 ).\n\nThe second inscription consists of the three larger characters written across the main body of the charm.\n\nWhen inscriptions are written horizontally they are read right to left, which is consistent with the way we have been reading the four character inscriptions (top, bottom, right, left).\n\nFor example, the two-character inscription on this charm is 三仙 (reading right to left) and not 仙三 (reading left to right).\n\nWhen we are looking up the inscription in the list, however, the characters are still written left to right.\n\nAccording to our translations below, the inscription (三仙) on Row 8 shows the meaning as \"Three Immortals\".\n\nSimilarly, the three-character inscription on the charm is read 福祿壽 (reading right to left) and not 壽祿福 (reading left to right).\n\nThe list (Row 7) informs us that the meaning is \"happiness, emolument and longevity\".\n\nIncidentally, these lock charms have a very interesting history. Please see lock charms for a detailed discussion.\n\nHopefully, this little guide will enable you to read inscriptions and legends more easily and thereby allow you to have a better understanding of the deeper meaning of Chinese coins and charms.\n\n(If you are interested in how the terms \"tong bao\", \"yuan bao\" and \"zhong bao\" came to be used in the inscriptions (legends) of Chinese coins to mean \"currency\", please continue reading to the bottom of this page).\n\nChinese Charm Inscriptions (Partial List)"
