        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe artificial rating accuracy of ancient Chinese coin is low, the cycle is long and the labor cost is high. At present, computer image processing technology is mostly used for coin denomination recognition or coin corrosion area recognition, and there is little research on the rating of ancient Chinses coins by image processing method. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of ancient Chinese coins rating based on the combination of image color and continuity features. The text adopts k-means algorithm to recognize the ancient Chinese coin region of the image, and extracts the variance and skewness characteristics of the H and I channel in the HSI color space of the ancient Chinese coin region. In this paper, Canny algorithm is adopted to extract the characters and edges of ancient Chinese coins, and the continuity characteristics of the raised characters and edges are quantitatively measured, and jointly constitutes the feature vector of ancient Chinese coins with color features. The rating score of ancient Chinese coins image is predicted by BP neural network model. Experimental results show that this method can accurately and quickly classify ancient Chinese coins by image information.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nChu X.
