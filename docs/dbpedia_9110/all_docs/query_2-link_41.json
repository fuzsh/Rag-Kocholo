        "text": "History of Chinese Invention - The Invention of Monetary Coins\n\nBarter is the exchange of resources or services for mutual advantage, and dates back to the beginning of humankind.\n\nFrom about the twelfth century BCE monetary use was made of grain, cloth, animals, ornaments and metals, most functional of which were cowry shells and bronze tools. The first coins were cast bronze imitations of these monetary objects, hoes, knives and cowries. The earliest coins were inscribed imitation hoes issued by the Zhou kings in the late sixth century BCE ... In the third century BCE a practical solution to the problem of handling irregularly shaped coins was found by replacing hoe and knife coins with flat disc-shaped coins with a central hole, so they could be carried in bulk on strings.\n\nChina pioneered over 500 years of early paper money , spanning from the ninth through the fifteenth century CE. From the ninth century to the fifteenth century CE, in China, the first actual paper currency was used as money. Through this period the amount of currency skyrocketed causing severe inflation. Unfortunately, in 1455 the use of the currency vanished from China. European civilization still would not have paper currency for many years.\n\nc. 3000 BCE: Development of Banking in Mesopotamia\n\nBanking originates in Babylonia out of the activities of temples and palaces which provided safe places for the storage of valuables. Initially deposits of grain are accepted and later other goods including cattle, agricultural implements, and precious metals. Cappadocian rulers guarantee quality in weight and purtiy of silver ingots helps their wider acceptance as money.\n\nc. 1000 BCE: First Metal Money and Coins\n\nBronze and Copper and iron imitations of cowrie shells were manufactured by China about 1000 BCE and could be considered some of the earliest forms of metal coins. Metal tool coins, in shapes such as swords and spades, were also first used in China. These early metal monies developed into primitive versions of round coins. Chinese coins were made out of base metals, often containing holes so they could be put together like a chain. The earliest writer on Chinese coinage was Kuan Tzu, (645 BCE) one of the most renowed Chinese statesman of antiquity. During the Southern Sung dynasty, in 1146, Yang Hung Tsun's Chhuan Chih or A Treatise on Coinage which is widely considered the first comprehensive numismatics works in any language.\n\nFrom about the twelfth century BCE monetary use was made of grain, cloth, animals, ornaments and metals, most functional of which were cowry shells and bronze tools. The first coins were cast bronze imitations of these monetary objects, hoes, knives and cowries.

In the third century BCE a practical solution to the problem of handling irregularly shaped coins was found by replacing hoe and knife coins with flat disc-shaped coins with a central hole, so they could be carried in bulk on strings.\n\n500 BCE: Modern Coinage\n\nOutside of China, the first coins developed out of lumps of silver. They soon took the familar round form of today, and were stamped with various gods and emperors to mark their authenticity. These early coins first appeared in Lydia, which is part of present-day Turkey, but the techniques were quickly copied and further refined by the Greek, Persian, Macedonian, and later the Roman empires. Unlike Chinese coins which depended on base metals, these new coins were made from precious metals such as silver, bronze, and gold, which had more inherent value.\n\nReferences\n\nA Survey of Primitive Money\n\nThe Beginnings of Currency\n\nwritten by Quiggin, A.
