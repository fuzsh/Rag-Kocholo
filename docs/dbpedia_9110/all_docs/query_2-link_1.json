These first “coins” were followed by what became the basic form for Oriental coinage for the next 2,300 years: a round cast metal disc with a hole in the center.",

        "text": "No one is quite sure when money was invented in China. This is because the first emperor of the unified Chinese Empire (founded in 221 B.C.), Qin Shi Huang (259 B.C. – 210 B.C.), destroyed as many records of earlier Chinese kingdoms as he could to ensure the stability of his new empire. With the establishment of a unified empire under the Qin dynasty in 221 B.C., Chinese money settled on a single form — the classic round pan liang (or ban liang: “½ ounce”) coin with a square hole in the middle. These bronze coins incorporated a two-character legend that identified the weight of the coin.\n\nIn 118 B.C. the Han emperor Wu Di issued a new form of coin known as wu zhu (“5 grain”), which incorporated a raised rim on the outer and inner edges of the coin. This coin style became standard for the next 700 years.\n\nThe Tang dynasty in A.D. 621 introduced the classic form of Chinese coin with four characters that identified the date of issue and its intent as a circulating currency. This format became fixed in Chinese coinage until the end of the empire with only minor variations between dynasties.\n\nChinese Dynasties\n\nDid You Know?\n\nNo one is quite sure when money was invented in China. This is because the first emperor of the unified Chinese Empire (founded in 221 B.C.), Qin Shi Huang (259 B.C. – 210 B.C.), destroyed as many records of earlier Chinese kingdoms as he could to ensure the stability of his new empire."
