History Of Money in China The Department of Chinese Culture Tsinghua University, Beijing, China On the A brief introduction to History of MONEY In CHINA December 25th 2012 By Tayyab Farooq (阿里) Student ID: 2012280158 1|Page\n\n2. History Of Money in China History of Money in China Money is basically an agreement between people. Money is any clearly identifiable object of value that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts within a market or which is legal tender within a country. It is an agreement that this much of some kind of metal (usually gold, silver, or bronze) or paper will be worth this much bread, and this much cheese. The earliest metal coins came from China, where people used small pieces of bronze to trade things starting around 1500 BC. Coins with guarantees were invented around 650 BC. This kind of coin is marked with a promise by somebody (often a government) that this coin is worth what it says it is worth. So you don't have to weigh each coin before you accept it (if you trust that government). The first coins of this kind were from Lydia, in West Asia. They were used to pay mercenary soldiers. But many people preferred to keep on trading one thing for another (bartering) instead The Emergence of Money:- Anatolian obsidian as a raw material for stone-age tools was distributed as early as 12,000 B.C., with organized trade occurring in the 9th millennium. In Sardinia, one of the four main sites for sourcing the material deposits of obsidian within the Mediterranean, trade in this was replaced in the 3rd millennium by trade in copper and silver. Both grain and cattle as money are known in use 9000 BC as two of the earliest things understood as available to barter (the first grain remains found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC). The importance of grain to value and money is true whereby in language there is, surviving the transition of the material of currency, the description of gold in a smaller state described as a \"grain of gold\". In the ancient earlier instances of trade with something as money, the things with the most desirable; useful and their reliability in terms of the confidence a person would have had in the re-use and re-trading of these things (their marketability), decided in the minds of the prospective individuals concerned the nature of the object or thing chosen to exchange. So as in agricultural societies, all those things needed for efficient and 2|Page\n\n3. History Of Money in China comfortable employment of energies for the production of cereals and the like were the most easy to transfer to monetary significance, for direct exchange. As more of the basic conditions of the human existence were met to the satisfaction of human needs, so the division of labor increased to create new activities for the use of time to solve more advanced concerns. As people’s needs became more refined, so indirect exchange becomes more likely as the physical separation of skilled laborers (suppliers) from their prospective clients (demand) required the use of a medium common to all communities, to facilitate a wider market. Aristotle's opinion of the creation of money as a new thing in society is: “When the inhabitants of one country became more dependent on those of another, and they imported what they needed, and exported what they had too much of, money necessarily came into use. Money in CHINA The first objects to be used as money by the people of China were NATURAL SEASHELLS. This marked the beginning of a transition from the old system whereby goods were traded and bartered to a new age of monetary symbols. Then came the Bronze Age, during which the Chinese used their skills and wisdom to create a resplendent bronze culture. Bronze coins replaced shells as the currency of the age, and were supplemented by the circulation of precious metals such as gold and silver. With the emergence, growth and increase of marketplace trading, all kinds of money appeared and went into broad circulation. Following the historical developments of modern civilization, they gradually developed into the perfectly integrated credit and currency systems in place today. The history of money in China goes back more than 4000 years, and the types of money that have been used are many and varied, including ancient forms of money, gold and silver currency, copper coins, and paper money. The emergence of money gave people more freedom of movement and association. During every historical period or phase, the different materials and methods used in coining reflected not only political strength, but also the state of the economy and the level of technological development. Money has always been closely linked to the development of society. The changes and replacements of currencies tell a vivid story of the vicissitudes of nations, the rise and fall of dynasties, but also amply reflect the skill and imagination of the coiners who have made money into a rich, unique and exquisite art form. We sincerely hope that visitors to this exhibition will be able to further their knowledge and understanding of 3|Page\n\n4. History Of Money in China Chinese history and culture through an appreciation of the long history of Chinese money. How coins were made in ancient China the earliest coining method used by the ancient Chinese was a very complex process. First a copper 'mother' mould was cast, then clay was used to make layer upon layer of pottery 'child' moulds. The mother and child moulds were fitted together, and liquid bronze was poured in though a hole. When the coins had hardened the pottery moulds were smashed, and the bronze coins removed. Finally, the edges of the coins were filed and polished to make them smooth and round. By the Song Dynasty, the manufacture of money was already tending towards a higher degree of effectiveness, and pottery moulds were being replaced by sand casting. In this process, VISCID SAND was formed into two sand boards, and finished mother coins placed between them. Pressure was exerted on the boards to form a series of obverse and reverse coin moulds, and molten bronze was then poured in through an aperture. After the sand boards had been broken open and the coins removed, the fragments of sand could be reformed into new boards and used again, saving both working hours and raw materials. When sand-casting was used in coining, the grains of sand were first filtered through a SIEVE, to ensure that the granules were of even size. The 'mother' coins were then used to push out the coin shapes. 'Hawk's beak' clamps were used to squeeze shut the container before the molten bronze was poured into the shaped coin moulds. Once the coins had been cast, they still needed to be smoothed and polished. The unfinished coins were threaded onto a long stick, and their edges were rubbed smooth on top of a flat slab. Conclusion Tiny ancient coins attract so much attention from so many people because they permeate the historical events that have shaped the political, economic and cultural evolution process of every dynasty and period in Chinese history. This is what is meant by the phrase, 'The rise and fall of dynasties are all in money'. While you are enjoying looking at Chinese money in all its different forms, shapes and sizes, you will at the same time gain a deeper understanding of China's history and culture. Indeed, that is the purpose and intention of this exhibition: to explain the development of Chinese history from its beginnings to the present day through the medium of money. 4|Page\n\n5. History Of Money in China The earliest money used by mankind:- Money, a product that possesses considerable MAGIC POWER, came into being amid mankind's earliest exchange of goods. In China, 4000 years ago, natural seashells were the first form of currency to be used. Seashells were chosen because they were easy to count, and also because they were difficult to come by in inland towns. Imitation shells and metal coins:- As goods began to be exchanged with increasing frequency, the supply of seashells often lagged behind the demand for them, and so imitation shell money began to be manufactured from various materials including stone, jade, bone and copper. One example of this was bronze shell money, the appearance of which marked the beginning of metal coining. The abundance of coins created in this way greatly accelerated the development of commodities exchange, and gave a huge boost to the growth of commerce and even the formation of cities The place of shells in ancient China Among the thousands of characters that make up the Chinese written language, the majority of characters that are related to wealth have the lateral radical ‘bei’, meaning COWRIE SHELL. From this we can see that when the Chinese written language was first taking shape, the cowrie shell was already a symbol representative of money and wealth. The four big currencies of pre-Qin China:- During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (770 ~ 221 BC), as a result of the rapid development of the commodity economy, several different kinds of ancient coins started to appear, their shapes based mostly on the tools or utensils that were used at the time. Among the different currency sets, the four big ones were:  Cloth coins (bu bi)  Knife coins (dao bi)  Inscribed bronze shells (daiming tongbei)  Round coins (huan qian). 5|Page\n\n6. History Of Money in China Fig: four big currencies of pre-Qin China These coins varied from different region to region and from city to city, and they provide evidence of traces left by the agricultural production of primitive societies, and of the earlier trade and barter systems used by mankind. The Qin Dynasty unification of currency systems:- The Qin Dynasty (221 ~ 207 BC) was the first feudal dynasty to unify China, and has become famous throughout the world because of emperor Qin Shi Huang and the Terracotta Army discovered in his mausoleum. Not only did Qin Shi Huang unify the Six States, he also unified their written languages and currencies, bringing the Ban Liang (half tael - 半兩) coins into use across the whole nation. These coins were circular in shape with a square hole through the middle, a shape that expressed the ancient Chinese belief that heaven was round and the earth was square. From then on, round coins with square holes continued to be used in China for more than two thousand years, until the late Qing Dynasty. 6|Page\n\n7. History Of Money in China Fig: Ban Liang Various kinds of Qin Ban Liang coins:- Commercial activities flourished during the Han Dynasty (202 BC ~ 220 AD). In the early stages civilians were permitted to mint their own coins, but this led to counterfeit and inferior currency becoming a serious problem. Han Wu Di stands out in Chinese history as an emperor of many achievements, and it was during his reign that this situation was remedied. In 113 BC his government established the world's first national mint, Shanglin Sanguan (上林 三官), in the capital Chang'an (today's Xi'an), thus centralizing the minting of money. To stop people stealing bronze by filing down the coins, the coins were cast with a raised edge, and this was the earliest measure taken to prevent counterfeit money in human history. Fig: Shanglin Sanguan (上林 三官) 7|Page\n\n8. History Of Money in China Currency inflation during the Xin Mang Period:- Currency inflation has been around since ancient times, although its causes were different. For Example:  Coins could decrease in weight  Becoming so thin and small that they would float on water  They were easily broken when handling During the Xin Mang Period (9 ~ 25 AD), a brief dynasty between the two Han Dynasties, a large number of coins of nominal value were distributed, such as 'yi dao ping wu qian-一刀平五千’ (one dao equal to five thousand), a coin that was equal in value to five thousand small ping coins. This led directly to poverty and disadvantage in people's lives, economic collapse and social upheaval, and further hastened the demise of the dynasty. Fig: yi dao ping wu qian-一刀平五千 How the Chinese made money 2000 years ago:- China was one of the earliest countries to start using bronze technology, and early Chinese coins were also cast from bronze. Coins were cast from hard moulds, until after the Tang Dynasty (618 ~ 907 AD) when sand moulds began to be used. As sand moulds were destroyed in the casting process, and could not be preserved, it is mostly hard moulds that have survived and can be seen by us today. There were various types of hard mould such as pottery, stone and copper, and the different coining methods used included 8|Page\n\n9. History Of Money in China  Casting (mo)  Moulding (fan)  Single-layer vertical casting (dan ceng li shi jiao zhu xing)  Repeat casting (die zhu). The Chinese term mofan (model or mould) comes from this. The consequences of upheaval in the country. The Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu and Wu (220 ~ 266 AD) each did things in their own way; as a result of this and of the unstable political situation of the succeeding Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties (281 ~ 589 AD), monetary policies were uncoordinated between the different states and dynasties, to the point where goods such as grain and silk were being used as currency at the same time as coins. Upheaval in the country caused division between monetary systems, and the fact that grain and cloth were being used in place of money shows the regression caused by these divisions. Devaluation of currency in the Sui Dynasty:- During the Sui Dynasty (589 ~ 681 AD), canals were constructed to solve the problem of transporting grain between north and south. The long-term benefits of this undertaking were undeniable, but national finances could not bear the burden of several massive engineering projects running simultaneously. The extravagance and corruption of Sui Yang Di, a famously despotic emperor, resulted in inflation and currency devaluation. The origins of credit:- The Tang Dynasty saw China's feudal society at the height of its power and splendour, economically prosperous and culturally productive, with many great works of art and literature brought into being. The influence of the Tang Dynasty on Chinese culture was huge; even now, overseas Chinatowns are known as 'Streets of the Tang people' in Chinese, and traditional Chinese dress is called 'Tang costume'. Tang Dynasty coins, called Kaiyuan Tongbao-开元通宝, were no longer recorded in weight, and were thus the earliest credit money in the world. The name Kaiyuan Tongbao meant, 'a new era has begun; coins are circulating treasure'. We can see that the ancient Chinese people's ideas about money were already quite open. 9|Page\n\n10. History Of Money in China Fig: Kaiyuan Tongbao-开元通宝 Deflation at the height of the Tang:- The early period of the Tang Dynasty, as far as the purchasing power of money was concerned, was a period of low prices. Prices were low mainly because it was a peaceful time during which production increased. In the 4th year of the Wude era (621 AD) the ‘Wuzhu-无助 coin’ was discontinued, and later other types of coins were also withdrawn, leaving the Kaiyuan Tongbao as the principal currency in circulation. v Fig: Wuzhu-无助 coin The Silk Road:- The Silk Road, like the fuse that sets off an explosion, ignited the world's yearnings for China. From its beginnings in the Western Han (202 ~ 9 BC) until its height in the Tang Dynasty (618 ~ 907 AD), the Silk Road's history spanned more than a thousand years. Setting out from Chang'an (today's Xi'an), the political and economic centre of the time, the route passed through many Central Asian countries on its way to Europe and Africa. As merchants travelled back and forth along the road, large quantities of Chinese money, as well as silk and other goods, passed between the various countries, while Western money and merchandise flowed into China. 10 | P a g e\n\n11. History Of Money in China Money and Calligraphic Art:- The beauty of symmetry, an important tenet of traditional Chinese aesthetics, is also reflected in money. The most typical example of this is the Duipin coins that were common during the Northern Song (960 ~ 1127 AD) that were inscribed with characters identical to the variant forms used in calligraphy. Coins were minted in great quantities during the Song Dynasty, but what is even more worth mentioning is that Song Dynasty money was designed with a high degree of artistry, drawing on many different styles of calligraphy and taking Chinese monetary culture to a new height. The earliest year-marked coins in the world:- The ‘Chunxi Yuanbao - 淳熙元宝’coins produced during the Southern Song (1127 ~ 1276 AD) have the character 'seven' in capital form on their reverse sides as a record of the year, the 7th year of the Chunxi era (1180 AD). After that year, the ordinary non-capitalized form was used for numerals. This system of year-marking coins was used up until the end of the Song, and is an important characteristic of Song money. Chinese money started to be year-marked more than three hundred years before a similar practice was adopted for European coins. Fig: Chunxi Yuanbao - 淳熙元宝 The emergence and significance of paper money:- The monetary systems of the two Song dynasties still relied mainly on coins, but by 11 | P a g e\n\n12. History Of Money in China that time silver was greatly increasing in importance, and the production and promotion of paper money was the most notable contribution to the monetary system of that era. The paper money was a typical credit currency, printed using carved woodblocks and guaranteed by the state. The emergence and circulation of paper money was the beginning of a new era in the history of money in China. It had a great impact on the development of society and economy, and a profound and lasting influence on the ages to come. Money of the Liao, Western Xia and Jin dynasties:- Existing concurrently with the Song were a few regimes established by minority peoples in the north, namely The Liao, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. In many ways they were considerably influenced by the Han nationality culture of the Central Plains. They used Han characters on their money, and also adopted the Han monetary system and minting methods. Their governments followed the Han system, and tendencies towards assimilation could also be seen in education, clothing and social customs. Yuan Dynasty currency:- The Yuan Dynasty (1271 ~ 1368 AD) was a feudal dynasty dominated by Mongolian nobles, established by Kublai Khan on the foundation of Genghis Khan's unification of Mongolia. From its inception the Yuan Dynasty vigorously pushed the Baochao, a form of paper money that could not be freely converted. Paper money took over from copper coins as the basic currency in use, and gold and silver were prohibited from circulation. From the Yuan Dynasty onwards, China switched to using silver as the measure of monetary value. Fig: Zhiyuan Tongxing Baochao- 之源通行宝钞 12 | P a g e\n\n13. History Of Money in China Zinc refining technology and brass money:- While the Ming Dynasty (1368 ~ 1644 AD) was in power, a mixture of paper money, copper coins and silver was used. By the time of the Jiajing era (1522 ~ 1566 AD), the technology for refining zinc was already well developed, and an evolutionary breakthrough occurred in the minting of money. Chinese money had previously been made from bronze. In the Jiajing era, zinc started to be added to the bronze to produce brass, another alloy from which coins could be minted. From this we can see the influence of science and technology on money. The early Ming fails to prohibit the use of silver:- In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, the government prohibited the use of gold and silver in order to promote the use of paper money within the monetary system, and even imposed a Ban on the mining of silver. But this proved a difficult change to make, as people had already been using silver as currency for several centuries, since the time of the Five Dynasties (907 ~ 960 AD), and its use was also influenced by Central Asian currency systems. In the middle period of the Ming, Zheng He undertook his voyage to the West, opening up a connection between China and the West. Most of the Western countries that set up international trade relations with China used money made of silver or other precious metals, and so the Ming government had to lift the ban on silver. Qing Dynasty money:- The Qing Dynasty (1644 ~ 1911 AD) was the last dynasty of the Chinese Empire. By the early Qing, China was already a vast empire with a territory more extensive than it had commanded during the Han and Tang dynasties, and second only to the Yuan dynasty. The Qing government was established and dominated by the Manchurian aristocracy. A process of absorption and assimilation occurred between the Manchu and Han cultures, evidenced by the money of that period on which Manchurian and Chinese scripts appear side by side. A peak period for minting the emperors Kangxi (1662 ~ 1722 AD) and Qianlong (1736 ~ 1795 AD) were grandfather and grandson. Their long reigns were a time of peace and prosperity throughout the country, during which the people led relatively stable and affluent lives, and are known as 'The Golden Age Of Kangxi And Qianlong'. While Kangxi and Qianlong were on the throne, coins were cast in a wide range of forms and in great quantities. It was an age that proved to be another peak 13 | P a g e\n\n14. History Of Money in China period in the history of minting money in China. Draft Banks:- Draft banks (piaohao- 票号 ) came into being because of the need to transfer funds. In the early years of the Daoguang Emperor (1821 ~ 1850 AD), merchants from Shanxi Province were trading in Chongqing, Tianjin, Beijing and other places, and they often experienced the difficulties and dangers of carrying cash on long journeys. To solve this problem, Lei Lutai, a native of Pingyao, Shanxi, converted the Xiyucheng Pigment Shop (洗浴城颜料店) into the Rishengchang Draft Bank (日升昌 票号), specializing in exchange and remittance of funds, thereby creating the first draft bank. Fig: piaohao- 票号 The Qing under the shadow of war after going through two Opium Wars, the Qing dynasty lost strength and gradually went from prosperity to decline. On October 18th 1860, the British-French Allied Forces burned down the Yuanming Yuan, the old Summer Palace known as the 'Garden of Gardens', and forced the Manchu Qing rulers to sign the 'Treaty of Peking', to cede territory and pay indemnities. This caused a drain on silver, and the copper coins that were minted were also of increasingly poor quality, causing severe currency devaluation. The declining empire:- In 1901, the Eight-Power Allied Forces made up of British, American, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Austrian and Italian forces invaded China, and modem China was thenceforth reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. Following this downturn in the national strength, the coins minted by the Qing deceased in weight as the embarrassing situation grew gradually worse. A few regimes established by 14 | P a g e\n\n15. History Of Money in China peasant rebellions also started to mint money autonomously, both for civilian use and to reinforce military supplies. The Westernization Movement and machine-made money:- Before the end of the Qing dynasty (1910), following the foreign invasion of China, the Westernization Movement began to advocate the use of advanced foreign technology to strengthen the country and bring wealth to the people. During the reign of the Qing Emperor Guangxu (1875 ~ 1908), the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces Zhang Zhidong introduced modern Western methods of coin minting that made use of advanced technology. He bought coining machines from Britain, and established a mint in Guangzhou (Canton), taking the lead in mechanizing the minting process. The machine-made money produced was regular, uniform and of fine quality, similar to the money we use today. The crystallization of folk culture - Yan Sheng money:- Money that was specially made for the purpose of driving away evil spirits already existed in China over two thousand years ago. It was not circulated as currency, but was made in lively and interesting designs, and people called it Yan Sheng money. As well as being officially minted by the government, it also came from all levels of society. Yan Sheng money reflected many folk fashions and customs, as well as the likes, dreams and beliefs of the broad masses of the people. It provides valuable data for the study of folk customs. The influence of Chinese coining on Oriental monetary culture:- The Oriental currency system refers to the group of currencies that can be represented by Chinese historical money, and includes the currencies of Korea, Japan, Vietnam and parts of South-East Asia. Prior to the Qing Dynasty, China's economy and culture had long been a big influence on the East and South-East Asian region. The influence was especially strong on the politics, economy and culture of Vietnam, Japan and Korea, and the currencies of those countries largely emulated China's methods of coinage. Merging with China's monetary culture, together they formed a unique Oriental monetary culture system. 15 | P a g e\n\n16. History Of Money in China Money during the Republican ERA:- During the existence of the Republic of China (1912 ~ 1949), China's financial enterprises underwent an unprecedented shake-up as the forms of money went from chaos to conformity. The age-old system of silver Taels (Liang) was abandoned, and Silver Dollars (Yuan) started to be used in their place. Silver dollars were in turn replaced as legal tender by non-cashable banknotes, and gradually a currency system evolved in which paper money was primary and coins secondary. Fig: Taels (Liang) Fig: Silver Dollars (Yuan) The emergence of banks In Tang Dynasty China a phenomenon known as 'flying money' (飞钱 - feiqian) appeared that was in fact a banking system in embryonic form, six or seven centuries earlier than Europe's financial institutions. In the Song Dynasty there was public-private convenience exchange (guansi bianhuan -官司变换), and in the Ming and Qing Dynasties the private banks (qianzhuang -钱庄) and draft banks (piaohao - 票号 ) emerged; these financial institutions were all bank-like in nature. The birth of China's modern banks came a full 50 years after banks for foreign capital were established in China. In 1897, the Qing government authorized the founding of China's first bank - THE IMPERIAL BANK OF CHINA - 中国通商银行(the name was changed to ‘Commercial Bank of China’ in 1912) - which started issuing banknotes the following year, marking the start of China's own banking system and banknote issue. THE IMPERIAL BANK OF CHINA - 中国通商银行 16 | P a g e\n\n17. History Of Money in China Modern State Banks:- In 1905, the Qing government established the first state bank in Chinese history, the 'Da Qing Bank - 大 清 银 行 '. Later they went on to found the Bank of Communications as well as some merchant banks and local banks. After the Revolution of 1911 broke out on October 10th 1911, the Da Qing Bank was renamed Bank of China. The state banks of the National Government In 1927, the National Government was established in Nanjing. In 1928 the Central Bank was proclaimed a state bank by the new government and started operations. The Central Bank was of a different nature to other ordinary banks and state-owned enterprises, and doing business was not its main purpose. After its establishment the Central Bank steadily increased in strength and developed very rapidly, laying an important foundation for the financial monopoly of bureaucratic capital. China's banking industry in the early 20th century From the 1930s onwards, the Chinese banking industry achieved an unprecedented rate of growth. 137 new banks were established during that period despite, and although there was a financial crisis from 1934 to 1935, not only did the number of new banks not decrease during those years, but banks also occupied a leading position, with local banks issuing a whirlwind of banknotes and encouraging business. It was the local banks in Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai and other cities and provinces that developed at the fastest rate. Republican finance during wartime Because of the War of Resistance against Japan (1937 ~ 1945) and the civil war raging within China (1927 ~ 1949), the Kuomintang government's financial deficit rose sharply and the ‘Fabi -法币’ (paper money issued from 1935) became unsustainable, a situation the Kuomintang sought to remedy through 'Monetary Reforms'. But prices continued to rise by the day, even by the hour, and soon whole bundles of banknotes were little more than waste paper - they were even used by ordinary people to plaster their walls - setting a world record for the highest currency inflation ever to occur in monetary history. First Version of Renminbi:- The first version of the ‘Renminbi – 人民币’ - the founding of the People's Republic of China on December 1st 1948, the ‘People's Bank of China’ was founded and 17 | P a g e\n\n18. History Of Money in China started to issue Renminbi. Because at that time the flames of war had still not subsided, and it took time for the Renminbi to be introduced, no fractional currency or metal coins were issued with the first version of the Renminbi. On October 10th 1949, ‘Chairman Mao Zedong’ stood on the ‘Tian'anmen Gate Tower’ and solemnly declared the founding of the People's Republic of China; this signified some momentous changes for China. Fig: First Version of Renminbi The second version of the Renminbi:- The pace of construction From March 1st 1955 the People's Bank of China issued new currency (the second version of the Renminbi), and recalled the old (the first version). The conversion rate between the new and old currencies was such that ‘1 yuan of the new currency was equal to 10,000 yuan of the old currency’. Design-wise, this version of the Renminbi was clear in its ideology: the fen notes showed images of industry and transportation, while the jiao notes depicted the mechanization of agriculture, the improvement of production and scenes of construction, reflecting the new look of China's socialist construction. 18 | P a g e\n\n19. History Of Money in China Fig: The second version of the Renminbi Coupons:- Evidence of the change from planned economy to market economy In 1950s China, people's material life and means of production were still very deficient, and in order to manage the overall distribution of resources, in 1953 the Chinese government began to practice planned supply throughout the whole country. Coupons then became a 'second currency' used by people in their daily lives. Early in 1992, following a gradual improvement in quality of life and means of production, and a big increase in the supply of material goods, the various coupons that had been in use for almost forty years finally left China's economic stage. The Third Version of the Renminbi:- The third version of the Renminbi is issued In order to boost the development of industry and agriculture, increase the circulation of commodities and facilitate the people's use of currency, on April 20th 1962 the People's Bank of China began to issue the third version of the Renminbi, with authorization from the State Department. The designs printed on this version focused on China's national economic policies of the time - which the economy should be based on agriculture, led by industry, with the simultaneous development of agriculture, light industry and heavy industry. Long live the great unity of the Chinese people:- 'Long live the great unity of the Chinese people - 中国人民大团结万岁’ was the draft title of Mao Zedong's speech for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 30th 1949. The designs on the new 10-yuan note of the third version of the Renminbi illustrated this idea with images of China's various nationalities and of workers, peasants and soldiers, which led to the notes being nicknamed 'great unity' by the masses. They symbolized Chinese people from different ethnic groups living and working together in peace, unity, stability and contentment. Images of the people In China, workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals and tradesmen are the basic elements that constitute the working population. They form the main body of the vast workforce, with workers and peasants accounting for the largest percentage. The new Renminbi notes were printed with designs that showed 19 | P a g e\n\n20. History Of Money in China China's working people, as represented by workers and peasants. Ping-Pong diplomacy and Foreign Exchange Certificates the famed 'Ping-Pong Diplomacy' is a uniquely fascinating phenomenon in the history of international relations. A little white ball bounced around the world, breaking the thick ice of Sino-American, Sino-Japanese and East-West relations, and turning a new page for the PRC's foreign affairs. As China's foreign relations became increasingly frequent, on April 1st 1980, authorized by the State Department, the Bank of China began to issue the 1979 edition of ‘Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC)’ in seven denominations, and in 1990 issued two new 1988 edition certificates in different denominations. Foreign Exchange Certificates were issued as a special currency that foreigners could use to purchase commodities in China. Fig: Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC) The Fourth Version of the Renminbi:- The spirit of 'reform and opening up' since the policy of 'reform and opening up', China's urban and rural commodity economy has developed rapidly, the retail turnover of social commodities has increased by a large extent, with a corresponding increase in the demand for currency. From April 27th 1987 the People's Bank of China began to issue a new edition of the Renminbi. This, the fourth version, made definite innovations and breakthroughs in design, style and printing techniques. 20 | P a g e\n\n21. History Of Money in China Fig: The fourth version of Renminbi Hong Kong and Macao On May 2nd 1994, Hong Kong dollars in five denominations were issued for the first time by the Bank of China, and went into official circulation in Hong Kong. On October 16th 1995, the Bank of China Macao Branch issued Macao dollar banknotes in five denominations. The new Hong Kong dollars and Macao dollars issued by the Bank of China were used together with the old Hong Kong dollars and Macao dollars that were already in use. 21 | P a g e\n\n22. History Of Money in China Fig: Hong Kong Dollar and Coins The Renminbi weathers Asia's financial storm:- In 1997 a monetary crisis suddenly erupted in Thailand and developed into a financial and economic crisis; what's more, it quickly spread to other countries and regions of East and South-East Asia. In the midst of the Asian financial crisis, China maintained the status of the Renminbi without depreciation, safeguarding China's economic development and financial stability, and also winning much praise from international society. The Renminbi and China's modern finance:- The main body of China's financial system is made up of six state-owned exclusive investment commercial banks, under the supervision of the People's Bank of China, the Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Securities Regulatory Commission and other financial administrative and regulatory bodies. Additionally, there are ten national commercial banks, 112 local or regional banks, and a large number of rural credit cooperatives covering China's financial domain. There are more than 180 financial organizations that deal in foreign capital operating in China, including more than 80 non-banking organizations under the supervision of the central banks that are also very active, such as trust and investment companies, lease companies and financial service companies. Precautions Taken Against The Forging Of Banknotes:- The earliest measure taken in China as a precaution against forgery was the affixing of signatures to paper money. Later, because paper money was being produced in much larger quantities, the affixing of signatures also could only be accomplished as part of the printing process. To guard against the production of counterfeit money, 22 | P a g e\n\n23. History Of Money in China when the printing plates were being engraved, some secret marks would frequently be placed in inconspicuous places, and furthermore the paper used for printing money would often be watermarked beforehand. Modern banknotes also contain different quantities of thin metal strips, a method that has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the anti-forgery precautions. Bankcards of all colors and designs:- Under the driving force of the market economy, the scope of operations of every bank in the Chinese financial system continually expanded, and a diverse array of bankcards emerged to meet the demands of the times. Bankcards reduced the frequency of currency exchange in people's lives, reduced the amount of wear and tear on currency, and simplified all kinds of banking operations, making banking a more convenient business for the people of China. The popularity of coin collecting China is one of the four great ancient civilizations of the world, a nation with a long history and profound culture. In the twenty-first century, China is economically and culturally in the ascendant. Collecting has become an important way for Chinese people to enrich their personal cultural lives and improve their cultural understanding and accomplishments. There are already many enthusiastic collectors and hobbyists in China and around the world who have taken to collecting the various historical forms of money that have been used in China during past dynasties or in more recent eras. The Renminbi marches towards internationalization The effect of high-speed political, economic and cultural development is that China's status in international society is constantly rising, and China is engaging more frequently in cultural and economic exchange and cooperation with other nations of the world, a situation that is reflected in the numerous commemorative coins issued by Chinese banks in recent years. At the same time, the influence of the Renminbi in the international financial world has been steadily increasing, and it is now well on the way to becoming an internationally recognized currency.
