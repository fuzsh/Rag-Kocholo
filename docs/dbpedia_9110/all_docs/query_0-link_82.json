        "text": "English: Kingdom of Yān (11th century B.C. – 222 B.C.) 🎑\n\n燕\n\n1) An Yī Huà (一化) coin produced by the Kingdom of Yān between 300 B.C. and 220 B.C. to circulate alongside Knife Money🔪. This coin actually predates the Chinese Empire.\n\nHan Dynasty (206 B.C. – 220 A.D.) 🀄\n\n漢朝\n\n2) A Bàn Liǎng (半兩) from the Han Dynasty, these were earlier minted by the Kingdom of Qin, and later by the Empire of Qin. Han Dynasty Bàn Liǎng coins generally tend to be diminutive compared to Qin era Bàn Liǎng coins. The inscription “Bàn Liǎng” means ½ Tael, though at the time of the Han Dynasty these coins were minted at varying weights. In 119 B.C. these were replaced by the Sān Zhū (三銖) coins.\n\n3) An Wǔ Zhū (五銖) coin, these replaced the Sān Zhū (三銖) coins in 118 B.C. Wǔ Zhū coins continued to be produced by varying countries for the next 700 years. 🕯\n\nXin Dynasty (9 - 23) 😵💴😵\n\n新朝\n\n4) A Huò Quán (貨泉) coin issued by Wáng Mǎng (王莽), these coins were introduced alongside a chaotic system of round coins, cowrie shells 🐚, turtle shells 🐢, knife money 🔪, and spade money. As the people preferred this coin it would be continued to be made even after the fall of the Xin Dynasty with a mould from the year 50 (fifty) being found.\n\nTang Dynasty (618 – 690 ; 705 – 907) 📚\n\n唐朝\n\n5) a Kāi-Yuán Tōng-Bǎo (開元通寶) coin, fist issued in August 621 under the reign of Emperor Gāozǔ (高祖), these coins would be produced for around 300 years during most of the Tang Dynasty. 🏮\n\nSong Dynasty (960 – 1279) 🎖\n\n宋朝\n\n6) A Dà Guān Tōng Bǎo (大觀通寶) coin from the (Northern-)Song Dynasty cast under the reign of Emperor Huīzōng (徽宗) from 1107 until 1110. The inscription is written in what David Hartill describes as \"Slender-gold script\", and it is said that the inscription was stylised by the Emperor himself. ✍🏻🤴🏻 A Dà Guān Tōng Bǎo coin appears as the cover of David Hartill’s 2005 classic “Cast Chinese coins”. 📖\n\nMongol Empire (1206 – 1368) / Yuan Dynasty (1271 – 1368) 🏇🏻\n\n元朝 / ᠶᠡᠬᠡ ᠦᠨ ᠤᠯᠤᠰ / Их Юань Улс\n\n7) A Mongol Zhì-Dà Tōng-Bǎo (至大通寶) coin cast under the reign of Külüg Khan (武宗) from 1307 until 1311, under the Mongol Empire paper banknotes would become a more common medium of exchange than metallic currencies. 💸\n\nMing Dynasty (1368 – 1644) 🌞\n\n明朝\n\n8 A Yǒng-Lè Tōng-Bǎo (永樂通寶) cash coin cast under the Yǒng-Lè Emperor (永樂帝), these were cast in great quantities for export to neighbouring countries like Japan (the Ashikaga Shogunate), and the Ryūkyū Kingdom, as well as further countries like the Majapahit Empire (an island realm ruled from Java) where these coins are still commonly dug up today (as of 2017). Domestically the Chinese preferred to use paper money (left over from Mongol rule) and in the preceding years copper coinage had remained a rarity on the domestic market.\n\nQing Dynasty (1644 – 1912) 👲🏻\n\n清朝 / ᡩᠠᡳᠴᡳᠩ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ\n\n9) A Manchu Qián-Lóng Tōng-Bǎo (乾隆通寶) 1 wén coin produced under the Qián Lóng Emperor (乾隆帝), despite reigning from 1735 until 1796 these coins continued to be cast in Xinjiang (East-Turkestan) until the Wuchang Uprising & Xinhai Revolution restored Chinese independence in 1912.\n\nRepublic of China* (1912 – Present) 🌇\n\n中華民國 / 臺灣 / 台灣\n\n10) A Mín-Guó Tōng-Bǎo (民國通寶) cash coin of 1 wén produced in Dongchuan, Yunnan. These were among the last series of cash coins to be cast in China being cast in the denominations of 1 wén, and 10 wén (當十). The Province of Fujian also produced cash coins during the early Republican era but these would later be succeeded by machine-struck non-holed coins. 🔚\n\nUploaded from my Microsoft Lumia 950 XL with Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile 📱."
