Gradually though, spade money became thinner, flatter, and less utilitarian, a path that would lead to the evolution of standard coinage.\n\nSpade money was abolished in favor of Ban Liang coins during the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE. However, the currency was briefly reintroduced during the Xin dynasty under the rule of Wang Mang, who seized China from the Han dynasty for about 14 years. The piece of spade money shown in this listing comes from this time period.\n\nEx-Classical Numismatic Group item."
