        "text": "Plaque Info Time Period Qin Dynasty Geographical Region Northern China List of Symbols\n\nUnification of China\n\nGreat Wall\n\nTomb of Qin Shi Huangdi\n\nTerracotta Army\n\nCrossbow\n\nStandardization of the Coin System\n\nStandardization of the Road, Wheel Systems\n\nThe Qin Dynasty, although renowned for its brutality and paranoid emperor, should also receive a legacy of great achievements given its astonishing and monumental impressions embedded in Chinese history. Despite overshadowed by his less appealing side, one should not overlook the ambitions of China’s first emperor, Shi Huangdi, who integrated geographical and social aspects into one state, which would constitute the ideology of unification for future dynasties. The idea of “China” would not exist today without the successful consolidation of power by the Qin Dynasty.\n\nThe territorial map of the conquests under the Qin symbolizes probably its greatest accomplishment, the unification of the Seven Warring States in 221 BC. The dashed lines represent the former boundaries of the individual kingdoms prior to Ying Zheng’s (Shi Huangdi) conquests. The location of the Qin Dynasty’s landscape on the plaque conveys one specific message: without the central goal of establishing a single state, no other unified architectural, political, or social projects could exist.\n\nThe Great Wall, consistently seen as the quintessential symbol of Chinese culture, possessed origins during the Qin Dynasty. After securing control of the Qin Empire, Shi Huangdi sought to protect his territory from the northern barbarians. His solution was to construct a wall spanning the empire’s northern border, hence the image’s location on the top of the plaque. Although serving as a defensive fortification, the wall also represented a unity of a people. The Great Wall did not exist solely as a newly erected structure, rather a great part of its construction laid in the joining of previously built walls prior to Qin’s unification. In addition, the wall separated an agricultural Chinese culture from the nomadic tribes. What the Great Wall conveys in this plaque is the integration and isolation of a common lifestyle as well as a geographical boundary.\n\nPrior to his death, Emperor Shi Huangdi ordered the design and construction of his final resting place. The underground tomb, possibly one of the greatest burial sites in history, emulates much of the divine aspects Shi Huangdi expressed in his imperial rule. Sources say a map of the Qin conquests comprised the floor of the complex, including natural features, such as rivers flowing with mercury, in addition to a palace and a ceiling filled with gems to symbolize the heavens. The presence of Shi Huangdi’s tomb in this plaque projects the idea that the Qin possessed great technological advancements and resources to be able to construct such an impressive feat of engineering.\n\nIn addition to the lavish tomb itself, Shi Huangdi also commanded builders to create clay soldiers to take to the afterlife, hence the origins of the terracotta army. Each soldier, with lifelike human qualities and armor, as well as genuine military equipment, served to protect the emperor even in death. The terracotta army holds a position in this plaque to signify the importance of the military during the Qin period. It was the army that accomplished unification and gave Shi Huangdi his power. The military proved an integral part in China’s foundation, thereby earning a position in the Qin’s greatest achievements.\n\nThe widespread use of the crossbow during the Qin period provided its army with a deadly weapon, given its easy use greater power than a traditional bow. But why should a common weapon used throughout Chinese history be given such prestige in the Qin Dynasty? Given the importance of the military, the crossbow proved an effective piece of equipment to assist Ying Zheng’s army in establishing his dream of a unified empire. The Qin’s ability to successfully mass-produce and equip its armies with this weapon, despite its complex design, demonstrates the advanced production capability of this early dynasty.\n\nWith the foundation of the Qin Dynasty completed, Ying Zheng then needed to build its economy. With seven different kingdoms under his control, the emperor work towards standardizing the currency. Known as the banliang, the circular coin boasted a square hole in its center and replaced earlier forms of financial methods of payment, thus the appearance of China’s first unified currency. The single form of payment therefore centralized trade and commerce within the new empire. The Qin Dynasty gave birth to numerous “firsts” in Chinese history, and the banliang proved no exception given its use under later dynasties.\n\nAs with the creation of a single currency, the Qin also desired to ease the accesses to trade and commerce across a vast territory. To accomplish this task, the dynasty took part in a road construction project that rivaled that of ancient Rome. In addition, the wheel also received a standardized measurement in relations to the width of the roads as means to make transportation more efficient. The system of roads and the establishment dimensions of the wheel projected the Qin’s desire to make the empire a smaller and accessible place.\n\nThe goal of this plaque serves to portray the positive, lasting effects of the Qin Dynasty. Aside from the chaos that took place under Emperor Shi Huangdi, one can learn of the great consolidation tactics within the military, economic, and social reforms. Whether the construction of a massive fortification or the production of a simple coin, the idea of unification prevailed throughout the Qin Dynasty, and eventually paved the way for the rise of future Chinese dynasties.\n\nI am Garwin Leung, and I study history as my college major with a focus on East Asia.

The shaded line implies the border of the continent. The simple lines inside the realm are the main rivers flowing through. The lines with squares in the north indicate the Great Wall. The triangle-like figures in the southwest imply mountains, because that part was the Province of Tibet (in modern time). Beyond the Great Wall are some symbols looking like grass, and those indicate the steppe. The horse and the bow above its back implies the “barbarians”, or in another word, the nomads. They are famous for their horse and horse archery, that why I used those two symbols. And they were stopped by the Great Wall, so they cannot go any further to the south.\n\nThe big, black hat in the middle of the map is the “Jiuliu Mian”. It is a “mian”, which can be roughly translate as “crown”, attached by “Jiuliu” on each side, which can be roughly translate as “nine (jiu) pearl strings (liu)”. Actually the kind of hat with pearl strings is widely use in Qin and Han dynasty for royal court officers and nobles. But only the Emperor can use the hat with nine strings, because the number “nine” has a dignified meaning and always relate to the emperor. I drew that hat really big and put it in the center of the map to imply the dominance of the first and the only emperor at the time: the Qin Shi huangdi, Ying Zheng. He defeated all the other six kings in the Warring States and complete the first unification of China in the history.\n\nThose two soldier are the symbol of Qin soldiers. Their armor is similar to those discovered on terra-cotta soldiers which were excavated at the tomb of Qin Shi huangdi, so this armor could indicate their identities. I did not drew their lower body because there is no armor or other significant clothing there so we will not receive any necessary information from their pants. And their hairstyle is a common hairstyle for the Qin soldier. The long weapon on the left is “ge”. That was a well-known melee pole arm used in Zhou, Qin and even the Han dynasty. Its structure is just like a spear attached with a side blade. And this kind of weapon became “ji”, or in another word, the halberd in the later time. The weapon on the left is a crossbow, a symbolic ranged weapon of the Qin army. According to the record, when Qin army engages an enemy in the battlefield they usually attack with the crossbow squad first to “deteriorate enemy’s morale”. So that why the crossbow became a symbol of the Qin military force.\n\nThose three measuring tools are the symbols of three measurement: length (“du”), capacity (“liang”) and weight (“heng”). And these three things together indicate one of the feats of Qin Shi huangdi: Unification of measurement. He banned all those different measuring system existed in different region during the Warring State period and created a new and the only one. Those coins showed on the right and those Chinese characters at the right bottom corner has the similar meanings: Those coins are the ones used by the other region during the Warring state, and after Qin established the only legal currency is the single one which showed under them—bronze, a round shape with a square hole in the center. Those Chinese characters at the right bottom corner showed how the writing is unified into the Qin Zhuanshu. And actually all these seven character has the same meaning: horse (“ma”).\n\nTIANYAO ZHAO is a Chinese undergraduate student majors in BME in the University of Rochester.

Iron was first introduced and widely used under the times of the Eastern Zhou dynasty. The earliest trace of iron in China is dated back to the Spring and Autumn time, and the technology of blacksmithing developed significantly during the warring states period. Iron are used in all sorts of ways. For example, they can be used to make excellent agricultural tools for farming, or weapons for war. However, despite its superiority against bronze, iron tools and weapons did not overtake the position of bronze tools and weapons, because crafting with iron requires a higher technology and better skills.\n\nThe second picture, the currency used in the state of Qi, demonstrates the location where the individual is from. In fact, this is the currency that the man used during his time in the state of Qi. During Eastern Zhou dynasty, rulers of individual states had the right to create their own money as currency. The states of Qi, Zhao and Yan had their currencies in the shape of a knife, and each of them had slight variations. Because every state had different currencies, and different measuring systems, sometimes it is rather inconvenient for merchants that conduct trade in different states. This specific one drew here is that was used in the state of Qi. It is different than those that are used by Zhao and Yan as it is slightly longer and heavier.\n\nThe third picture is a broken Ding. Ding is an instrument that originally used to cook, however as time passes it starts to symbolize power. According to legends, when Yu the Great established the first dynasty, the legendary Xia dynasty, he ordered his men to build nine bronze Ding, symbolizing his position as their ruler. Also, there is a strict regulation of the number of Ding one can own, and the regulation is based on one’s status. For example, dukes can own up to seven Ding, and lesser governors can own five, according to some text. Therefore, Ding is also an instrument for “Li”, a set of rules and rituals that must be followed for the harmony of the society, according to Confucius. This broken Ding here symbolizes the lack of “Li” and the lack of centralized power in the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Due to invasions of barbarians, the central government of Zhou was forced to move its capital, and its power have had diminished. Overtime, the dukes of states became more powerful than the central government, hence the Zhou, though still in existence, is muck like a broken Ding, which is incomplete and unstable. Similarly, the orders and the rituals established during the peaceful years of Western Zhou is abolished, as the local governments became stronger and started waging war on each other. The ritual rights, or the “Li”, is often violated by the powerful governors as well.\n\nThe fourth symbol used depicts a horseman charging against an incoming chariot. This image signifies two things. Firstly, it represents the never ending warfare in Eastern Zhou dynasty. At the beginning of Spring and Autumn, there were roughly 140 states, and at the time of Warring states period, the main states only included the Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qin, which constantly fought against each other. The chaos and war lead to the death of many soldiers as well as civilians, but it also inspired new ideas. Therefore, the picture also symbolizes the introduction of horse back riding and how it slowly replaced chariots during this period of time. For example, the introduction of horse riding. Also, the war and chaos inspired philosophers to discuss and debate about the nature of governing and life, creating countless classes of philosophy that have long lasting impacts.\n\nThe fifth symbol is an ancient Chinese instrument called Zhong. In this case, it represents Confucianism, a school of philosophy that had huge impact during the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Zhong the instrument is often used as a symbol of ordered society, and “Li”, rituals and manners, which the Confucians believed is crucial to have for an ordered society. The Confucian scholar believed that people must listen to proper music and have a certain number of “Zhong”, fitting their ranks in the society, in order to achieve harmony. Apart from “Li”, there were also many other sets of rules that Confucians followed, which they believed to be able to end the chaos of the Eastern Zhou dynasty and retrieve the society back to what it was like during the Western Zhou dynasty. In order to do so, argues Confucian scholars, a series of practice must performed. For example, filial piety, or “Xiao”, says that children must respect and follow the parents, such to establish order within family. And also there is the idea “Ren”, which means humane, the right way for a ruler to treat his people. Confucians believed that harmony within a family can be achieved by having wives obeying husbands and children obeying parents, the harmony of country can be achieved by subjects obeying rulers, and the ruler shall rule with “Ren”.\n\nThe sixth symbol shows a man sitting in the wilderness, with trees and mountains in the background. This represents Taoists, another influential philosophy during the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Daoists preferred the hermit’s path, and enjoyed life in the wilderness, just like the man in the picture, rather than holding a position in the court. Another aspect of this symbol is that it shows the Daoist philosophy to rule. The philosophers believed that rulers should rule by doing nothing, like the man in the picture, because the people knows how to rule themselves, hence the government should limit their interference with its people.\n\nThe last symbol is a criminal that is undergoing the prosecution known as “Che Lie” (having five cows or horses tied to limbs and head to rip the criminal apart). It symbolizes legalism, another school of philosophy that flourished during the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Legalists believed that the best way to end the chaos of its time is to impose harsh laws on the people to prevent criminal acts. They are famous for having harsh punishments, and one of their most famous punishments was “Che Lie”. One of the most famous cases of somebody being prosecuted in such a way was Shang Yang, a legalist who served under the Qin and reformed the state’s law. He was the one who established the laws in Qin, but ironically he was prosecuted under the laws he proposed. Though legalist thoughts were widely recognized as inhumane and is often strongly opposed by Confucianism, it made Qin the strongest state of its time.\n\nHi!

It was a dangerous place to live. China needed unity and peace. This plaque shows the transition from a divided China to a unified China. The transition brought peace to the land at the cost of lives lost in war, but the benefits of a unified and peaceful China outweighs the cost. Also, this plaque illustrates the new policies brought about by the Qin Dynasty government with symbols indicated by arrows stretching from the map of unified China to the symbols. Some policies helped Qin Shi Huangdi to establish order and uniformity, and others, such as burning of certain books, suppressed dissent in the empire. Although these changes negatively impacted some Chinese, the benefits outweighed the cost—suppression dissent kept China out of civil war, standardization of roads, currency and measurements of length and volume provided uniformity in the empire, and a united China could put up better defense against the northern barbarians.\n\nOn the top section of the plaque, rice farmers from the kingdom of Qin are shown to have become foot soldiers that fought to unite China under the Qin. Because they were just farmers drafted into the Qin army, they didn’t have horses, and so they became foot soldiers.\n\nThese farmer-foot soldiers of Qin were represented by terracotta statues found in Qin Shi Huangdi’s imperial tomb. The terracotta soldiers in Qin Shi Huangdi’s tomb are placed to the right of the drawings of the rice farmers. The arrow between the rice farmers and the terracotta soldiers means that the farmers became soldiers who fought to unite China.\n\nQin Shi Huangdi is represented by the line drawing to the right of terracotta soldiers that guarded his tomb. His image has a plus sign to the left such that the plus shows that Qin Shi Huangdi and the terracotta soldiers belong together in their own dynasty. The “di” in his name is translated into “emperor” or “highest deity” according to the Hansen textbook, 2nd edition, thus in my drawing of Qin Shi Huangdi, he is depicted as a deity standing on the cloud. His title emperor in Chinese is to his right. The first Chinese character of his title is “da” (meaning great) and the second Chinese character is “wang” (meaning king). The “wang” character is composed of 3 horizontal lines linked with a vertical line, because the horizontal line represent heaven, people and earth, the vertical line represent the emperor, who rules all three.\n\nMap of the Warring States Period with its Seven Kingdoms. There were only seven kingdoms fighting with each other whereas earlier in history, there were many more warring kingdoms. The arrow pointing to the map to the right shows that the land divided by the 7 kingdoms became unified under the Qin into one empire.\n\nMap of the territory boundary of the newly established Qin Dynasty of the unified China/Empire.\n\nArrows stretch out from the map of the Qin Dynasty and point to various symbols on the plaque that are representative of the uniqueness of the Qin Dynasty.\n\nThe symbol towards the bottom left of the plaque shows that in the Qin Dynasty, the widths of roads and the length of the axle connecting the 2 wheels together were standardized. The double-headed arrows show the standardized length of the axle and the standardized widths of the roads.\n\nThe book and the fire symbol show that Qin Shi Huangdi ordered people to burn books, especially Confucian books. These books were bamboo scrolls. Please note that not all books were burnt because some of them survived. So in reality, historical statements that the Qin burnt all the Confucian books are too cut-and-dry to be true.\n\nQin Shi Huangdi started to build walls that would protect his empire from the Xiongnu of the North (barbarians who wanted invade China). The wall built in the Qin Dynasty was not the Great Wall of China, which was built later. The wall that the Qin built was a lot shorter than the Great Wall, which was lined with bricks. The wall of the Qin Dynasty was built with rammed-earth framed with wooden supports and stone. The significance of the wall of Qin was that it was the first wall in recorded history. They were built to protect China from the northern barbarians, and it inspired the building of the Great Wall of China in the Ming Dynasty.\n\nIn the Warring States Period, people used coins shaped into miniature swords or miniature bells to exchange on the market for real swords and bells. But in the Qin Dynasty, these miniature coins were outlawed. These miniature coins were melted down into hot metal, thus my plaque uses an arrow to shows these outlawed miniature coins were put back on fire to be destroyed and melted into hot metal. The coins that were allowed for use in the Qin Dynasty were circular coins that could be stringed together. I have depicted a string of four circular coins on my plaque.\n\nFinally, the Qin standardized measurements of length and volume. My symbols for this are a ruler and a container of water with marked volume.\n\nIn conclusion, this plaque shows that Qin Shi Huangdi established a unified China, putting China at peace and the new policies implemented—standardization of roads and axle length, standardization of currency, standardization of measurements of length and volume, burning of books that could cause people to oppose the Qin government, and the building of a wall that protected China from the northern barbarians. The benefits of unifying China and establishing the new policies outweighed the costs. China became unified and peaceful at the cost of deaths of Qin’s enemies. The elimination of currency in the form of miniature objects caused some people to become poorer, but new currency in the form of circular coins facilitated proper trade and monetary exchanges. The standardization of measurements of length and volume as well as road width and axle lengths brought uniformity at the cost needing to modify older vehicles. The burning of Confucian books got rid of potential dissent and allowed Qin to stay in power and to keep China peaceful. The building of the wall protected China at the cost of deaths of laborers building the wall.\n\nJIEYUAN DING is a senior at the University of Rochester (class of 2016).
