        "text": "Da Quan Wu Bai—“Big Coin 500 (cash)” c. AD 236–? First cast by Emperor Da, Sun Quan, temple name Wu Taizu (ruled AD 200–252 The Wu territory had existed, though not officially as an independant state, under the control of the Sun family since the mid 190s when Sun Ce, Quan’s brother, consolidated his father Sun Jian’s former forces and allies from when Jian had been a general first under Han and then in service of Yuan Shu. Ce turned against Yuan Shu and began forging his own sphere of influence. Ce died in AD 200 and Quan took power, at one point acceding to Cao Pi’s requests for acknowledgement of legitimacy and being bestowed the title King of Wu before turning against Pi and establishing his own rival claim to the empire and took the title of Emperor Da of Wu in AD 222). Some historical records report that these coins continued to be used by the Jin dynasty that reunited China in AD 280 after Shu-Han had fallen to Wei, and Wei and Wu had fallen to Jin. As such I will list also the other Emperors of the Wu dynasty: Sun Liang, the Prince of Guiji, known posthumously as both Feidi and Youdi (AD 252–257); Emperor Jing, Sun Xiu (AD 258–263); and Emperor Mo, Sun Hao, temple name Guiminghou (AD 264–280)\n\nThis particular specimen demonstrates a well-known trait of many Wu dynasty coins, namely that most were cast from near-pure copper and copper corrodes very easily. There were apparently two mints in operation, one in Hubei and the other in Nanking, the ones at Hubei being of poorer quality with weaker characters. This specimen would seem to be from this mint."
