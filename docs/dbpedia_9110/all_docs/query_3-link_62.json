        "text": "Xin dynasty coinage (Traditional Chinese: 新朝貨幣) was a system of ancient Chinese coinage that replaced the Wu Zhu cash coins of the Han dynasty and was largely based on the different types of currencies of the Zhou dynasty, including knife money and spade money. During his brief reign, Wang Mang introduced a total of four major currency reforms which resulted in 37 different kinds of money consisting of different substances (tortoiseshell, cowries, gold, silver, copper), different patterns (knife, spade, coin), and different denominations (values of 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1,000).\n\nEventually Wang Mang was forced to abolish the revived Zhou dynasty coinages in favour of cash coins. But after the fall of the Xin dynasty, the restored Han dynasty reintroduced the Wu Zhu cash coins, but the Huo Quan (貨泉) cash coins introduced during the Xin dynasty would continue to be produced for some time after its fall."
