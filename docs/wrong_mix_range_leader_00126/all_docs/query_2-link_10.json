        "text": "The president is chief of state and is directly elected to up to two five-year terms. Faustin-Archange Touadéra was reelected in December 2020 with 53.1 percent of the vote. In January 2021, the Constitutional Court rejected appeals presented by the opposition and confirmed the election’s legality, despite significant electoral flaws.\n\nThe election was characterized by delays and voter-registration irregularities, and was held following more than a week of intense fighting outside Bangui. While the government and its international partners described the election as credible and legitimate, opposition parties denounced the polls as marred by widespread ballot-box stuffing and vote buying. Many citizens were prevented from voting due to threats and attacks perpetrated by a rebel coalition. There were no international independent observers outside of Bangui.\n\nThe prime minister is the head of government and is appointed by the president. In February 2022, Touadéra appointed then economy minister Félix Moloua as prime minister, after the resignation of Henri-Marie Dondra.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) are directly elected to five-year terms in the 140-seat National Assembly. The constitution adopted in 2015 stipulated the creation of a Senate, which has not been established.\n\nThe first round of legislative elections took place in December 2020 alongside the presidential election, and was plagued by insecurity, voter intimidation, and allegations of fraud. In January 2021, the Constitutional Court nullified some first-round results, citing electoral irregularities, violence, and intimidation. Another three rounds were held to fill the lower house’s seats.\n\nThe ruling United Hearts Movement (MCU) ultimately won 61 seats. No other party won more than 10. The MCU’s parliamentary group expanded to 86 by September 2021 as MPs defected to its banner. According to UN reports, that year’s polls were flawed but turnout was high and the elections were largely peaceful.\n\nRepeatedly postponed, local elections are now scheduled for July 2023.\n\nElectoral laws permit multiparty competition, and adult citizens enjoy universal and equal suffrage. However, electoral authorities operate opaquely. A 2020 law regulating the National Elections Authority (ANE) introduced mechanisms to enhance its independence. However, the ruling MCU still controls the ANE’s board.\n\nThe MCU and its allies made several attempts to amend the constitution during 2022 so that Touadéra could seek a third term. In August, Touadéra notably announced a constitutional referendum and created a committee to draft a new document. In September, the Constitutional Court ruled that the committee’s formation was unconstitutional; in response, Touadéra dismissed court chief Danièle Darlan by decree in October.\n\nA government-organized reconciliation initiative made little progress in 2022, with major opposition parties and rebel groups boycotting it in March.\n\nWhile political parties are legally able to form and operate, party members conducting political activities risk intimidation and violence by the national police and progovernment militias in Bangui, and by armed groups and security forces outside the capital.\n\nThreats against Touadéra’s political opponents increased in 2022 in parallel with initiatives to amend the constitution. Progovernment movements called on supporters to use violence against political opponents.\n\nSeveral opposition parties hold seats in the National Assembly. However, most of the candidates in the 2020–21 elections were unable campaign outside Bangui due to widespread violence and direct threats and aggression by armed rebel groups.\n\nAfter the elections, administrative and judicial authorities severely restricted the rights of several prominent opposition leaders, who were prevented from leaving the country and threatened with the loss of their parliamentary immunity. Others have chosen voluntary exile in France for fear of arrest. The government has reportedly considered banning dual nationals from serving as president or as an MP, a move that would affect two prominent opposition figures.\n\nCitizens are vulnerable to pressure and intimidation from national police and nonstate armed groups. Due to enduring insecurity, voters outside Bangui are largely unable to participate in political processes.\n\nThe Russian regime maintains significant influence over the RCA’s political affairs. President Touadéra assigned his security to the Wagner Group, a Russian security company with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Wagner mercenaries have supported military operations and directly fought armed rebel groups, reportedly winning them public support.\n\nIn March 2022, Russian diplomat Yevgeny Migunov told then Constitutional Court chief Darlan that the presidential term limit must be changed. Diplomats from Western countries later claimed that Moscow had called for the constitutional referendum announced in August.\n\nIn 2021, the European Union sanctioned the Wagner Group, citing serious human rights abuses and destabilizing activities in the RCA. In March 2022, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, then the UN high commissioner for human rights, accused security forces and the Wagner Group of engaging in human rights violations.\n\nMembers of many ethnic, religious, and other minority groups are prevented from achieving political representation due to discrimination and an accompanying lack of access to the political process. Sectarian violence against Muslims affects their ability to participate in public space.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in politics, with only 18 women sitting in the 140-seat National Assembly, though the electoral law passed in 2019 requires that 35 percent of candidates be women. Societal and legal discrimination against LGBT+ people prevents them from advocating for their interests via the political process.\n\nDue to the long-lasting tribalization of politics, the country’s public institutions and army are dominated by the Gbaya ethnic majority, to which former president Bozizé belongs. President Touadéra has promoted members of his group, the Mbaka-Mandja, to key positions and to the presidential guard.\n\nThere is little support for independent media. In Bangui, outlets are increasingly aligned with national politicians and foreign governments, especially Moscow. Media outlets and social media channels often carry material meant to incite hate, discrimination, or violence, mainly against minority groups and opposition leaders. Although the High Commission of Communication plays an active role in media regulation, the situation has not improved.\n\nSecurity and progovernment militia forces regularly threaten journalists. The government prevents international media workers from traveling outside Bangui. Incidents of harassment and intimidation by government forces often go unreported for fear of reprisals.\n\nIn February 2022, journalist Jean Saint-Clair Maka Gbossokotto died after meeting an individual affiliated with the RCA government and the Wagner Group; friends feared Gbossokotto was poisoned. In September, Communications Minister Serge Ghislain Djorie threatened to close Radio Ndékèluka if it continued to discuss Touadéra’s efforts to amend the constitution.\n\nAlthough extremely dysfunctional, the educational system is generally free of extensive political indoctrination. However, clientelism and corruption are widespread in many schools and universities. Russian-language studies were expanded at the university level in 2021, as Moscow continued to exert influence in the RCA. In June 2022, Moscow issued scholarships to provide Russian-language training to Central African professors.\n\nOutside the capital, the school year is often disrupted, including by a lack of available teachers and the occupation of school buildings by a variety of armed actors.\n\nAlthough freedom of assembly and the right to political protest are constitutionally guaranteed, these liberties are curtailed due to government repression of the opposition in Bangui, and threats posed by armed groups, FACA forces, and Russian mercenaries elsewhere.\n\nWith the exception of an opposition rally held in August 2022, only progovernment, pro-Russian, and anti-French gatherings are authorized in Bangui.\n\nCourts are generally inefficient and frequently hampered by corruption. The government has limited authority to enforce judicial decisions. Judicial salaries have often gone unpaid. Judicial personnel are often untrained and are reluctant to be deployed outside of the capital.\n\nThe Special Criminal Court (CPS), created in 2015, is struggling to fulfill its mandate. The Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission, created in 2020, has yet to start its work.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was subjected to political interference during 2022. In March, a Russian diplomat called on then chief Danièle Darlan to help secure a third term for President Touadéra. In October, Touadéra dismissed Darlan by decree.\n\nArbitrary detention and lengthy pretrial detention are commonplace, and the justice system has limited presence beyond Bangui. Impunity for violence, economic crimes, and human rights violations are widespread.\n\nNational and international courts made some steps in trying those accused of violence. In March 2022, Chadian authorities arrested antibalaka leader Maxime Mokom Gawaka, who was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and handed him to the ICC. In June, a French prosecutor launched a preliminary investigation into whether the France-based Groupe Castel was involved in war crimes in the RCA. In September, the ICC opened the trial of former Séléka leader Mahamat Said Abdel Kani. In October, three rebels who had been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity were found guilty at the CPS.\n\nIn Bangui, the officials of the Central African Office for the Repression of Banditry and progovernment militias are often accused of abuse of power and excessive use of force. Elsewhere, armed nonstate actors operate with impunity. These groups are responsible for violent attacks against civilians, international peacekeeping forces, and humanitarian workers. FACA and Russian mercenary forces have also been accused of human rights violations.\n\nSecurity forces and insurgent groups compete to control territory and natural resources, causing widespread internal displacement. Conflicts between farmers and nomadic pastoralists have also destabilized the country.\n\nIn July 2022, the UN Security Council exempted the RCA’s security forces from an ongoing arms embargo.\n\nSame-sex activity is illegal, and punishable by fines and imprisonment. While enforcement of these laws is uncommon, societal discrimination against LGBT+ people remains acute. In September 2022, the interior minister expelled two Cameroonian nationals for engaging in same-sex activity.\n\nMuslims, nomadic pastoralists, and the Ba’aka minority group face continued discrimination. The Gbaya majority, to which former president Bozizé belongs, is also targeted, while the Mbaka-Mandja are favored by Touadéra.\n\nThe independent High Authority for Good Governance is tasked with protecting the rights of members of minority groups and people with disabilities, though its reach is limited."
