        "text": "Timing and scope of renewal The elections were the first to be held since the March 2013 coup, which ousted President FranÃ§ois BozizÃ© and dissolved the National Assembly. A National Transitional Council (CNT) was established in April 2013 to oversee a transitional period (twice extended) and to draft a new constitution, which was adopted by referendum on 13 December 2015.\n\nThe parliamentary and presidential elections initially took place on 30 December, but several candidates claimed that the elections were rigged. On 25 January, the Transitional Constitutional Court invalidated the first round of the parliamentary elections due to \"many irregularities and the implication of candidates in these irregularities\". Fresh parliamentary elections were held on 14 February 2016 in parallel with the run-off presidential elections. Delays in the announcement of the first round results meant that run-off parliamentary elections were held on 31 March, four days later than planned.\n\nThe 2016 elections returned a fragmented parliament. Independent candidates took 55 of the 140 seats in the new National Assembly. The National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP ), led by Mr. Michel Amine, became the largest single party, winning 13 seats. The Central African Union for Renewal (URCA) of former Prime Minister Anicet Georges Dologuele took 11 seats. Former President BozizÃ© led the National Convergence \"Kwa Na Kwa\" (KNK) which took seven seats.\n\nIn the presidential elections, Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera (independent) - the last prime minister under President BozizÃ© - defeated Mr Dologuele (URCA), who had won the most votes in the first round of voting on 30 December. On 30 March, Mr. Touadera was sworn in as the new President. He succeeded Acting President Catherine Samba-Panza, who had overseen the transitional period since January 2014, succeeding Acting President Michel Djotodia, who led the 2013 coup. The convening of the National Assembly on 6 May 2016 marked the end of the three-year long transitional period.\n\nDate of previous elections: 23 January & 27 March 2011\n\nDate of dissolution of the outgoing legislature: 26 March 2013*\n\n*Dissolved by a coup.\n\nTiming of election:Delayed elections\n\nExpected date of next elections: February Â March 2021\n\nNumber of seats at stake: 140 (full renewal)\n\nNumber of candidates: Not available.\n\nPercentage of women candidates: Not available.\n\nNumber of parties contesting the election: Not available.\n\nNumber of parties winning seats: 17\n\nAlternation of power: Not applicable*\n\n*The first elections after the 2013 coup.\n\nDate of the first session of the new parliament: 6 May 2016\n\nName of the new Speaker: Mr. Karim Meckassoua (independent)"
