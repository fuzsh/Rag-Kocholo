        "text": "David Dacko (born March 24, 1930, Bouchia, Moyen-Congo, French Equatorial Africa [now in Central African Republic]—died November 20, 2003, Yaoundé, Cameroon) was the president of the Central African Republic from 1960 to 1965 and from 1979 to 1981.\n\nDacko, a former teacher, held ministerial posts under Barthélemy Boganda, the prime minister of the autonomous Central African Republic. Claiming a family relationship, Dacko succeeded to the prime ministership in 1959 after Boganda’s death. In 1960 the republic gained its full independence, and Dacko became the country’s first president. He ruled the Central African Republic as a one-party state and in 1962 easily won the presidential elections. Dacko was unable to improve the country’s failing economy, however, and, with the Central African Republic facing bankruptcy, he was overthrown by Jean-Bédel Bokassa on the night of December 31, 1965/January 1, 1966."
