Speech at the Tunku Abdul Rahman Hall, 26 January 1960. 27 Document 454, FO 371/129342, No 8, ‘The outlook in Malaya up to 1960’: a note by the commissioner- general’s office, [May 1957], BD/III, p. 391. 28 Boyce, Malaysia and Singapore, p. 37. 29 Ibid., p. 38. “… the Malayan position in international affairs has, generally, been one which supports the objectives and actions of the West, at least in broad principles.” Milton Osborne, Singapore and Malaysia (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, July 1954), Data Paper Number 53, Southeast Asia Program, Department of Asian Studies, p. 68. Osborne also noted Malaysia’s “firm support to the Indian position in the Sino-Indian border dispute and to the Diem regime in South Vietnam.” 30 He had discussed the ASA proposal with President Garcia of the Philippines in 1960 and the latter was apparently supportive of it but his successor, President Macapagal, dropped the whole idea in view of their claim to Sabah. Sheppard, Tunku: His Life and Times, pp. 119-120. 31 See Peace, Justice & Prosperity: What the Alliance Offers YOU—Greater National Wealth, More Individual Earnings”, 1959 Parliamentary Election Manifesto, [Kuala Lumpur: Alliance Party Headquarters, August 1959], pp. 17-19. 32 PD/DR, 30 November 1959, col. 659. 33 Ibid., cols. 668-680. 34 See www.savetibet.org/advocacy/un/resolutions/resolution1353.php accessed 27th February 2007. 35 PD/DR, 3 December 1959, col. 956. 36 Doc 398, [Defence aspects of constitutional talks]: minutes (NDMS/M(56)1) by the Ministry of Defence of an inter-departmental meeting on 9 January 1956, BD/III, p. 250. 37 Mr Choo Kia Peng to the Tunku, 5 March 1958, MTARP/SM1293, Tunku Abdul Rahman Papers, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Memorial, Kuala Lumpur. Choo Kia Peng was 78 years old then and had built his fortune in tin mining. 38 Copy of letter from the Tunku to Mr Choo Kia Peng, 13 March 1958, MTARP/SM1294, op. cit. 39 See Tan Siew Soo, The Malayan Special Force: In the Heart of Africa, (Kuala Lumpur: Pelanduk Publications, 1989). Lt Col Tan, who was then a newly commissioned second lieutenant in the Federation Reconnaissance Regiment, was one of the officers sent with the Malayan Special Force which served with great distinction under the command of Lt Col Ungku Nazaruddin, later General and Chief of the Army. 40 See Chandran Jeshurun, Malaysia: Fifty Years of Malaysian Diplomacy, 1957-2007, Petaling Jaya: The Other Press, 2007, pp. 48-49. 41 He was Wee Kim Wee of The Straits Times. Wee (1915-2005) was later to become Singapore’s High Commissioner to Malaysia (1973-1980) and the fourth President of the Republic (1985-1993). 42 “Congo Force – Tun Abdul Razak welcomes back men of the initial battalion”, The Straits Times Annual of 1962, (Singapore: The Straits Times Press, 1962), pp. 14-15. 43 PD/DR, 4 December 1962, col. 2105. The Tunku was responding to Opposition criticism of his “Save Democracy Fund” to send relief aid to Indian refugees who had been affected by the Sino-Indian border clash earlier that year. Nehru accorded the Tunku an unusually friendly gesture when the latter was visiting New Delhi in 1962. The Indian Prime Minister drove over personally to the Tunku’s palatial guest house saying to him “What is protocol among friends.” Sheppard, Tunku: His Life and Times, p. 117. 51 Diplomatic Profile Series 44 Mahathir bin Mohamad, “Trends in Foreign Policy and Regionalism” in Patrick Low (ed.), Proceedings and Background Paper of Seminar on Trends in Malaysia, Trends in Southeast Asia, No. 2, (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1971), pp. 33-34. 45 PD/DR, 8 January 1962, cols. 2339-2340. 46 PD/DR, 19 January 1962, cols. 3295-3296 (in Malay). 47 PD/DR, 4 December 1962, col. 2108. 48 Dr Tan Chee Khoon (1919-1996) served three terms in the Dewan Rakyat and was popularly known as “Mr Opposition” as he was Leader of the Opposition from 1964 to 1978. Highly respected by both the Government and Opposition MPs, he was a rare recipient of the honorific title of “Tan Sri” from the King. See R.K. Vasil, Tan Chee Khoon: An elder statesman, (Petaling Jaya: Pelanduk Publications, 1987); Tan Chee Khoon, Tan Chee Khoon: From village boy to Mr. Opposition, an autobiography, Petaling Jaya, Pelanduk Publications, 1991. 49 PD/DR, 12 October 1964, cols. 2013-2014. 50 PD/DR, 15 October 1964, cols. 2343-2346. 51 PD/DR, 14 December 1962, cols. 3058-3059. 52 PD/DR, 14 October 1964, cols. 2175-2176. 53 PD/DR, 3 December 1964, cols. 3468-3469. 54 PD/DR, 3 December 1964, cols. 3450-3454; 3461-3464. 55 PD/DR, 25 November 1964, cols. 2638-2639.

Patterson], Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs (Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office, 2001). [Hereafter referred to as US/XXVI]. The variation in the original figures cited by Tunku Abdul Rahman in 1961 is probably due to contributions that were made at a later date. 62 PD/DR, 10 November 1965, col. 1929. 63 See Abdullah Ahmad, Tengku Abdul Rahman, pp. 60-61. 64 PD/DR, 10 November 1965, col. 1929. 65 PD/DR, 10 November 1965, col. 2072. 66 PD/DR, 11 November 1965, cols. 2193-2194. 52 Tu n k u A b d u l R a h m a n P u t r a A l - H a j 67 PD/DR, 11 November 1965, cols. 2193-2195.

See Sheppard, Tunku: His Life and Times, pp. 146-151. 74 FAM, I/3, 1966, pp. 1-2. 75 FAM, I/3, 1966, pp. 62-70. 76 No. 274, Memorandum From Secretary of State Rusk to President Johnson, Washington, D.C. 15 October 1966, US/XXVI. 77 No. 276, Telegram from the Embassy in Kuala Lumpur to the Department of State, 17 November 1966, US/XXVI. 78 “Malaysia’s foreign policy”, FAM, I/3, 1966, p. 7. 79 Ibid., pp. 6-7. 80 FAM, II/1 and 2, 1969, pp. 29-35. 81 FAM, II/1 and 2, 1970, pp. 39-40. 82 Sheppard, Tunku: His Life and Times, p. 179. 83 FAM, III/2, 1970, p. 21. 84 These natural traits were much admired by the younger staff of Wisma Putra as was recently revealed by one of them, Tan Sri Zainal Abidin Sulong. “I was told that the Tunku after prayer would turn at random to a few pages of the Koran and what he read would be his inspiration and guidance for the day. As regards Tunku’s natural charm, he had really an immense capacity to put people at ease in his disarming ways either at a press conference, at the poker table or at his barbecue parties … At press conferences, the press corps often imposed a self-restraint or censorship without publishing many of Tunku’s gaffes or unkind remarks.” Personal letter from Tan Sri Zainal Abidin Sulong, Chairman, Malaysian Industrial Development Authority to Tan Sri Hasmy Agam, Executive Chairman, Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations, 9 October 2008. 85 Tunku, Looking Back, pp. 72, 200. 86 IAR/5/1/61, Confidential, Notes by the Ambassador. 53 Diplomatic Profile Series Bibliography Primary Sources 1.
