        "text": "UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg.By David C. Cassidy.Illustrated. 669 pp. New York:W. H. Freeman & Company.\n\nIN 1925 the world's view of science was radically transformed by quantum mechanics -- a new mathematical theory of atomic structure outlined by Werner Heisenberg in a 15-page article in Zeit schrift fur Physik. Then 23 years old, Heisenberg had just graduated from the University of Munich, where his father was professor of Byzantine studies. With his flaxen hair and bright blue eyes, he reminded his mentors, the physicists Max Born and Niels Bohr, of a Bavarian farm boy. But he was no simple farm boy. His rise in German academia was meteoric: at the age of 26 he became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Leipzig, and at the age of 32 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics. But even though Heisenberg would make many important contributions to nuclear physics and quantum theory, his later work would never equal the revolutionary brilliance of his first paper on quantum mechanics.\n\nDavid C. Cassidy, a historian of science who teaches at Hofstra University and is the associate editor of the \"Collected Papers of Albert Einstein,\" has written a fascinating, well documented biography of Heisenberg. \"Uncertainty: The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg\" is best on the historical background, particularly the rise of Nazism in Germany, and Heisenberg's relations with the Nazi Party and with his contemporaries; it is less successful, though, in conveying the beauty of his mathematical physics and the importance of his philosophical ideas.\n\nThe title of the book, \"Uncertainty,\" refers to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which Heisenberg derived from quantum mechanics in 1927. It states, for example, that it is impossible to specify precisely and simultaneously the position and the velocity of a particle. In other words, our knowledge of the present state of a particle does not permit us to predict with any certainty its future states. From this, Heisenberg concluded that quantum mechanics had destroyed the determinism of classical physics and established the final failure of causality.\n\nMr. Cassidy, however, uses the term more loosely; he believes that a sort of uncertainty principle may apply also to Heisenberg's life and character. Werner Heisenberg grew up in Munich before World War I. According to Mr. Cassidy, \"European culture reeked in those years of bourgeois hypocrisy and duplicity.\" And the Heisenberg family did not escape it. For them, Heisenberg once wrote, \"Christianity was 'just an empty form' used merely for appearances.\" Though ambivalent as an adolescent about various systems of thought, Werner managed to throw himself into a number of causes. He was just young enough to escape the army during the war, but afterward he served as an auxiliary in the \"white\" forces that crushed the \"red\" revolution in Bavaria. Later he became a fuhrer in the New German Pathfinders, an organization of teen-age boys devoted to \"Gemeinschaft (community), Fuhrer (leader) and Reich (empire).\" The pattern here continued throughout his life: Heisenberg was always at the center of a worshipful group of younger males.\n\nThe opposite sex seemed to hold little attraction for him until his marriage at the age of 35. As a young man Heisenberg was a fine pianist and he met Elisabeth Schumacher, a recent graduate of the University of Freiburg in German literature, at a musical evening in Leipzig in January 1937. It was love at first sight and two weeks later they were engaged. Although Mr. Cassidy tells us that Heisenberg wrote to Niels Bohr about the problems of combining matrimony with physics, this biography tells us practically nothing about Heisenberg's life as husband and father, except for the fact that he and his wife had seven children. Presumably the author has given such matters short shrift because he does not think they are part of the history of science.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
