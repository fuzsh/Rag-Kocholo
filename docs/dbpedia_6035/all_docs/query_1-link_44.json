        "text": "By Alex Gordon\n\nHAIFA, Israel — On May 8, 1924, two German Nobel Prize winners in physics, Philipp Lenard (1905) and Johannes Stark (1919), endorsed Hitler’s Nazi party’s program in the Great German Newspaper.\n\nLenard and Stark were a member of a group of 30 physicists who put forward the concept of “German physics.” They rejected the new quantum physics and the theory of relativity as dogmatic theories irrelevant to reality. They argued that the correct approach to explaining physical phenomena should be based on classical physics, which was being crowded out by the “false” theory of relativity and quantum mechanics invented by the Jews.\n\nLenard and Stark believed that the correct description of reality is provided by analyzing the experiment within the framework of visual representations of classical physics, undermined by abstract “Jewish physics.” They and their associates believed that the “correct classical” understanding of physics was given only to Aryans. Lenard and Stark’s group called themselves “national explorers.” They called quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity “the world’s Jewish bluff.” In their view, a Jewish conspiracy against the truth had developed in physics. “German physics” was a concept introduced by Lenard in the title of his textbook German Physics in four volumes (1936).\n\nWhen Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in November 1922, Lenard sent a strong protest to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. After the “beer putsch” that Hitler organized on November 9, 1923, Stark became an admirer of Hitler. He stated, “His honesty and inner integrity, which we met in the great explorers of the past – Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Faraday, admire us in Hitler and his comrades. We recognize in them people close to us in spirit.”\n\nIn July 1937, in the official organ of the SS newspaper Black Corps Stark published an article White Jews in physics. It made a division between erroneous Jewish (theoretical) and correct Aryan (experimental) physics. Lenard wrote: “It is extremely important to review all discoveries in physics made by non-Aryans. For this purpose, it is best to turn to the discoveries of their most prominent representative, the pure-blooded Jew Albert Einstein. His theory of relativity was supposed to change physics. In fact, that theory has been completely bankrupted. Moreover, it could never have been correct. Jewish physics is a perversion of the foundations of Aryan physics.” Lenard, the founder of “Aryan physics,” believed piously in this distinction, considered it fundamental and basic: “You ask – German physics? I could also call it Aryan physics or the physics of people of the Nordic type, the physics of explorers of reality, seekers of truth, the physics of those who founded natural science. In reality, science, like everything that people create, depends on race, on blood.”\n\nLenard and Stark published an article entitled The Spirit of Hitler and Science, in which they displayed an almost religious attitude toward the Führer, writing that Hitler and his associates “have come to us as gifts from the Lord from earlier times, when races were purer, men more majestic, and minds unclouded. […] He is here and has revealed himself as the true Führer. We must follow him.”\n\nThe Austrian Jewish journalist Robert Jungk, in his book Brighter than a Thousand Suns about the history of the American nuclear bomb (1958), wrote: “The scientific world of the Weimar Republic did not take seriously the excursions of a few of its members into the obscure realms of demagogic racism. Professional achievement was still valued more than anything else. The adherents of ‘German physics’ who turned agitators briefly attracted attention, and no importance was attached to their ‘nonsensical shouting’.” Intelligent Jewish physicists paid no attention to the nationalist screamers. They were rationalists. They believed that absurdity could not win. But absurdity won: the irrational Nazis took over reason.\n\nOn April 17, 1933, the Jewish Nobel Prize winner in Physics (1925), James Frank, remarked in his retirement: “We Germans of Jewish origin are now regarded as strangers and as enemies in our own country.” The full emancipation of Jews in the Weimar Republic was inconclusive: “Germans of Jewish descent” turned out to be aliens. Before his retirement, Frank worked as director of the Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Jews from the university there, the following incident involving the celebrated German mathematician David Hilbert occurred. Jungk tells about it in his book: “The scientists who remained in Göttingen, among them outstanding researchers, during the Third Reich were not able to continue their scientific work at the high level of the twenties. The elderly mathematician Hilbert felt this decline the most. About a year after the “purge” in Göttingen, Hilbert sat at one of the official festivities in a place of honor next to the new Minister of Science, Upbringing and Public Education Berngard Rust. Rust carelessly asked the old scholar, “Is it true, Mr. Professor, that your institute has suffered great harm since the Jews left?” Sharp of tongue and as frank as ever, Hilbert replied, “Great harm? No harm has been done to the institute, Mr. Minister, it just doesn’t exist anymore!”\n\nHitler deeply respected Lenard, and the latter, in turn, “explained” to the Führer that the theory of relativity and nuclear physics are used by Jewish scientists to extract money from the government and the decomposition of the German people. After this explanation, received from the scientific luminary, Hitler called nuclear physics nothing other than “Jewish physics.” In June 1942, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer reported to Hitler on the progress of work on the nuclear bomb. But since German physicists were proving that nuclear physics was a Jewish fiction, Hitler did not give any importance to the work on the nuclear project. And here it turned out that “Jewish physics” existed and that it declared war on “Aryan physics”.\n\nOn August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein sent a letter to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The initiator of this letter was a Hungarian Jew, Leo Szilard, who in early 1939 had learned of the discovery of the chain reaction in uranium and realized the possibility of its effective military application by the Nazis. The authors of much of the text were expatriate physicists, Jews from Hungary, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller. The letter drew the president’s attention to the fact that Nazi Germany was conducting active research that might soon result in a nuclear bomb; the letter also called for the initiation of large-scale nuclear research in the United States.\n\nEinstein’s message was delivered to Roosevelt by Lehman Corporation director Alexander Sachs, a native of the Russian Empire (Lithuania), an influential economist, banker, and unofficial advisor to the president. On October 11, 1939, Sachs met with Roosevelt and delivered Einstein’s message. “Alex, what’s this about?” – the president asked. All of the finance expert’s explanations to Roosevelt failed. But Sachs secured an invitation to the president’s breakfast the next day.\n\nIn the morning, the president again asked about his new ideas. Then Sachs told Roosevelt a story about inventor Robert Fulton. In 1803, Fulton attempted to test his first steamboat on the Seine River in Paris. He reported his work to Napoleon. But the latter only replied with irritation: “You want to make the ship sail against the wind and against the current, building a fire under his deck? I have no time for such nonsense!” Thus, Napoleon missed his lucky break in the struggle against England for naval supremacy. President Roosevelt was silent for a few seconds, then summoned his aide and said: “This matter calls for action.”\n\nWith this letter began the revolt of the “subhuman” ̶ Jewish physical scientists against the “superhuman” Nazis, the revolt of the “inferior” non-Aryans against the “racially pure” Germans. “Aryan physics” was defeated. At Los Alamos, the American nuclear project “Manhattan” was created, which was successful and led to the creation and use of two nuclear bombs against Japan. Los Alamos was the site of an unmentioned battle of Jewish physicists against Nazism. The pacifists discarded pacifism, realizing that the devil is fought with the devil’s weapons. In working on the Manhattan Project, the only true Jewish conspiracy in history, a conspiracy of European Jewish exiles against the Nazis, took shape. It was an undetected and undescribed conspiracy of the Elders of Zion."
